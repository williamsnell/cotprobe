Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about gel electrophoresis is incorrect. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through.

Gel electrophoresis is a method used to separate DNA fragments based on size. I remember that DNA is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups in its backbone. So, when you apply an electric field, the DNA should move towards the positive electrode. That makes me think about option A, which says DNA migrates from positive to negative. Wait, no, if the DNA is negative, it would move towards the positive charge. So the direction is from negative to positive. So statement A sounds incorrect because it says DNA moves from positive to negative. Hmm, that might be the wrong statement.

Let me look at the other options to make sure. Option B says smaller DNA travels faster. That makes sense because smaller fragments can move through the gel matrix more easily than larger ones. So B is correct.

Option C: DNA migrates only when current is running. Oh right, because the electric field is what causes the movement. If the current is off, the DNA stops moving. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The longer the current runs, the farther DNA travels. Wait, but in gel electrophoresis, you usually run it until the dye (like bromophenol blue) reaches the bottom. If you run it too long, smaller fragments might even leave the gel. But the idea is that longer run times give more separation because the DNA moves further. So D is correct as well.

So the incorrect statement should be A. Because DNA moves towards the positive charge, so it's from negative to positive, not positive to negative. So A is the incorrect statement.

The incorrect statement about gel electrophoresis is:

A: DNA migrates from positive charge to negative charge.

In gel electrophoresis, DNA is negatively charged and moves towards the positive electrode when an electric field is applied. Therefore, it migrates from negative to positive, not positive to negative. The other statements (B, C, and D) are correct based on the principles of how DNA behaves in an electric field and the mechanics of gel electrophoresis.
