Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve: x dy + (y - x e^x) dx = 0. Hmm, I remember that differential equations can sometimes be tricky, but let's see what I can do here.

First, I should probably rewrite this equation in a more familiar form. Maybe I can express it as dy/dx equals something. So, let's rearrange the terms. The original equation is x dy + (y - x e^x) dx = 0. If I divide everything by dx, I get x dy/dx + y - x e^x = 0. That makes sense.

So, rearranging for dy/dx, I subtract (y - x e^x) and divide by x. So, dy/dx = (x e^x - y)/x. Wait, that simplifies to e^x - y/x. So, dy/dx = e^x - y/x.

Hmm, that looks like a linear differential equation. The standard form for a linear DE is dy/dx + P(x) y = Q(x). Let me see if I can write this in that form. Let me rearrange dy/dx + (1/x) y = e^x. Yes, that fits because I can move the y term to the left.

So now, P(x) is 1/x, and Q(x) is e^x. To solve this, I think I need an integrating factor. The integrating factor mu(x) is usually e raised to the integral of P(x) dx. So, integrating 1/x dx gives ln|x|, so mu(x) would be e^{ln x} which is just x. Wait, because the integral of 1/x is ln x, so e^{ln x} is x. So the integrating factor is x.

Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor x, so:

x * dy/dx + x*(1/x)*y = x*e^x

Which simplifies to x dy/dx + y = x e^x.

Wait a minute, that's the original equation I started with. Oh, right, because when I multiplied by the integrating factor, I get back to the original equation. So perhaps I should proceed by recognizing that the left side is the derivative of (mu(x) y), which is x y in this case.

So, d/dx (x y) = x e^x.

To find x y, I need to integrate both sides with respect to x.

Integrating the left side gives x y. The right side is the integral of x e^x dx. I remember that integrating x e^x requires integration by parts. Let me set u = x, dv = e^x dx. Then du = dx, and v = e^x.

So, integral of x e^x dx = x e^x - integral of e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C.

So putting it all together, x y = x e^x - e^x + C.

Now, solve for y. Divide both sides by x:

y = (x e^x - e^x + C) / x.

Simplify that: y = e^x - (e^x)/x + C/x.

Wait, let me check that step. So, x e^x is divided by x, which gives e^x. Similarly, -e^x divided by x gives -e^x / x. So yes, that's correct.

Now, apply the initial condition: y = 0 when x = 1.

Substituting x=1, y=0 into the equation:

0 = e^1 - (e^1)/1 + C/1.

Simplify that: 0 = e - e + C. So 0 = 0 + C, which means C=0.

So the solution is y = e^x - e^x / x.

Wait, that simplifies to y = e^x (1 - 1/x) = e^x ( (x -1)/x ) = e^x (x-1)/x.

Okay, so the function f(x) is e^x (x-1)/x.

Now, the question asks for f(2). Let's compute that.

f(2) = e^2 (2-1)/2 = e^2 (1/2) = e^2 / 2.

Looking at the options, option D is e^2/2. So the answer should be D.

Wait, let me double-check the steps in case I made a mistake. Starting from the DE: I rearranged it to dy/dx + (1/x) y = e^x, found integrating factor x, multiplied through, recognized the left side as d/dx (x y), integrated to x y = x e^x - e^x + C. Applied initial condition x=1, y=0: 0 = e - e + C => C=0. So solution is y = e^x (1 - 1/x).

At x=2: y = e^2 (1 - 1/2) = e^2 (1/2) = e^2/2. Yes, that's correct.

To solve the differential equation \( x \, dy + (y - x e^x) \, dx = 0 \) with the initial condition \( y = 0 \) when \( x = 1 \), we first rewrite it in standard linear form:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{x} y = e^x.
\]

The integrating factor is given by:

\[
\mu(x) = e^{\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx} = e^{\ln x} = x.
\]

Multiplying through by the integrating factor \( x \), the equation becomes:

\[
x \frac{dy}{dx} + y = x e^x.
\]

The left-hand side is the derivative of \( x y \), so we integrate both sides:

\[
\int \frac{d}{dx} (x y) \, dx = \int x e^x \, dx.
\]

Using integration by parts for \( \int x e^x \, dx \) (with \( u = x \) and \( dv = e^x \, dx \)), we find:

\[
\int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C.
\]

Thus, the solution is:

\[
x y = x e^x - e^x + C.
\]

Dividing through by \( x \), we get:

\[
y = e^x - \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{C}{x}.
\]

Applying the initial condition \( y = 0 \) when \( x = 1 \):

\[
0 = e - e + C \implies C = 0.
\]

So the solution simplifies to:

\[
y = e^x - \frac{e^x}{x}.
\]

To find \( f(2) \), substitute \( x = 2 \):

\[
f(2) = e^2 - \frac{e^2}{2} = \frac{e^2}{2}.
\]

Thus, the value of \( f(2) \) is \( \frac{e^2}{2} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
