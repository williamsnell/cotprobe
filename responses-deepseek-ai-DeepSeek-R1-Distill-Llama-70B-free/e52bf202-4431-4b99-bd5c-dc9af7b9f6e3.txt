Okay, so I've got this question about the inheritance pattern of G6PD deficiency. Hmm, I remember that G6PD is an enzyme, and its deficiency is a genetic disorder. But wait, what's the pattern here?

I think G6PD deficiency is related to the X chromosome. Oh right, because I remember that more males are affected than females. Because males have only one X chromosome, so if it's recessive, they'd show the trait, whereas females would need two copies. That rings a bell.

So the options are A through J. Let me go through them. Option E is X-linked recessive. That seems right. But wait, what about the other options? Like, could it be autosomal? No, because if it were autosomal, males and females would be equally affected, right? But in G6PD, it's more common in males, which points to X-linkage.

Wait, sometimes females can have it if both their X's have the mutation. But they're carriers usually. So the pattern is that the gene is on the X chromosome, and the condition is recessive. So females need two defective copies, males just one.

Looking at the options again, E is X-linked recessive. G is X-linked dominant. I don't think G6PD is dominant because then females with one copy would show the trait, but I think it's less common. So E makes more sense.

So the answer should be E.

The inheritance pattern of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is X-linked recessive. This is because the gene responsible for the enzyme is located on the X chromosome, and males, having only one X chromosome, are more frequently affected. Females, who have two X chromosomes, typically need both copies to be defective to show the condition, making it less common in them. Among the given options, E: X-linked recessive correctly describes this pattern.

Answer: E
