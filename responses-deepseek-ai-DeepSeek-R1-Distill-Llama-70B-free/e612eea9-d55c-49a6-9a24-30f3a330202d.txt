Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer between coffee and a cup. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when two substances exchange heat without any loss to the surroundings, the heat lost by the hotter one equals the heat gained by the cooler one. Right, that's the principle of calorimetry.

The problem says a camper pours 0.300 kg of coffee into a 0.120 kg aluminum cup. The coffee is initially at 70.0°C, and the cup is at 20.0°C. We need to find the equilibrium temperature. Oh wait, and coffee has the same specific heat as water. Got it.

So, I think the formula is Q = mcΔT, where m is mass, c specific heat, and ΔT the change in temperature. Since heat lost by coffee equals heat gained by the cup, Q_coffee = -Q_cup. But since we're setting them equal in magnitude, I'll write it as Q_coffee = Q_cup.

Wait, no, actually, the heat lost by the coffee will equal the heat gained by the cup. So, m_coffee * c_water * (T_initial_coffee - T_eq) = m_cup * c_aluminum * (T_eq - T_initial_cup).

Right, because the coffee is cooling down, so its temperature change is initial minus equilibrium. The cup is warming up, so equilibrium minus initial.

I need to find the specific heats. I remember that the specific heat of water is 4186 J/(kg·°C). What about aluminum? Oh, I think it's around 900 J/(kg·°C), maybe 901 or something close. Let me check my notes... Yeah, it's 900 J/(kg·°C).

So, plugging in the numbers:

m_coffee = 0.300 kg, c_water = 4186 J/kg°C. T_initial_coffee is 70°C.

m_cup = 0.120 kg, c_aluminum = 900 J/kg°C. T_initial_cup is 20°C.

So the equation is:

0.300 * 4186 * (70 - T_eq) = 0.120 * 900 * (T_eq - 20)

Let me compute each side step by step.

First, calculate the left side (coffee's heat):

0.300 * 4186 = let's compute that. 0.3 * 4000 is 1200, so 0.3*4186 is 4186*0.3=1255.8. So 1255.8 (70 - T_eq).

Right side (cup's heat):

0.120 * 900 = 108. So 108*(T_eq -20).

So the equation becomes:

1255.8*(70 - T_eq) = 108*(T_eq -20)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: 1255.8 *70 = let's calculate that. 1255.8 *70 = 1255.8*7*10 = (878.06)*10 = 8780.6. So 8780.6 - 1255.8 T_eq.

Right side: 108*T_eq - 108*20 = 108 T_eq - 2160.

So putting it all together:

8780.6 -1255.8 T_eq = 108 T_eq - 2160

Bring all terms to one side. Let's get all T_eq terms on the right and constants on the left.

8780.6 +2160 = 108 T_eq + 1255.8 T_eq

Adding 8780.6 and 2160 gives 10940.6.

And 108 +1255.8 = 1363.8 T_eq.

So:

10940.6 = 1363.8 T_eq

To find T_eq, divide both sides by 1363.8.

T_eq = 10940.6 / 1363.8

Let me compute that. Hmm, let me see. 1363.8 * 8 = 10907.2. Because 1363*8 is 10904, approximately. So 8 *1363.8 is 10907.2.

So 10940.6 is 33.4 more than 10907.2. So 33.4 divided by 1363.8 is approximately 0.0245. So T_eq is approximately 8.0245°C? No, that can't be right because the initial temperatures are 70 and 20. The equilibrium should be between them, around maybe 60s or so.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I did 0.3 *4186: 0.3 *4000 is 1200, 0.3 *186 is 55.8. So 1255.8, that's correct. So 1255.8*(70-T) is correct.

0.120 *900 is 108, correct.

So equation is 1255.8*(70-T) = 108*(T-20)

Wait, let me recompute the expansion.

Left side (coffee): 1255.8*(70 - T) = 1255.8*70 - 1255.8*T.

Wait 1255.8*70: Let me compute 1255 *70. 1255 *70 is (1200 +55) *70 = 1200*70=84,000 and 55*70=3,850. So 84,000+3,850=87,850. Then 0.8*70=56. So 87,850 +56=87,906? Wait, wait, no, 1255.8 *70.

Wait, 1255.8 *70 = (1255 + 0.8) *70 = 1255*70 + 0.8*70.

1255 *70: 1255*7 = 8,785. So times 10 is 87,850.

0.8 *70 = 56. So total is 87,850 +56=87,906. So 87,906 -1255.8 T.

Right side: 108*(T-20)=108T - 2160.

So equation is:

87,906 -1255.8 T = 108 T -2160.

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other:

87,906 +2160 = 108 T + 1255.8 T

87,906 +2160 = 90,066.

108 + 1255.8= 1363.8.

So 90,066 =1363.8 T.

So T=90066 /1363.8.

Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by perhaps 100: 900.66 /13.638.

Hmm, perhaps approximate.

Let me see how many times 13.638 fits into 900.66.

13.638 *60 = 819.28.

Subtract: 900.66 -819.28=81.38.

Now, 13.638 *6=81.828. Oh, so 6 would be about 81.828, which is just a bit more than 81.38.

So 60 + 6=66, but wait, 60 +6 is 66, but 6*13.638=81.828 which is larger than 81.38. So maybe 65.9?

Wait, maybe a better way. Let me compute 1363.8 *66.

Compute 1363.8 *60=81,828.

1363.8 *6=8,182.8.

So 81,828 +8,182.8=89,  89,010.8? Wait, 81,828 +8,182.8 = 90,010.8.

Wait, but our numerator is 90,066.

So 1363.8 *66=90,010.8.

The difference is 90,066 -90,010.8=55.2.

So 55.2 /1363.8 ≈0.0405.

So T≈66 +0.0405≈66.04°C.

Wait, but wait, the options are given, let's look. The options are A:70, B:62, C:55, D:75, E:58, F:50, G:60, H:68, I:66, J:65.

So 66.04 would be around 66, which is option I.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the calculation, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Because 0.300 kg coffee cooling from 70 to 66 would lose heat, and the cup would gain that heat.

Alternatively, perhaps I should do more precise calculations.

Let me compute 90066 divided by 1363.8.

First, 1363.8 *65 = ?

1363.8 *60=81,828.

1363.8 *5=6,819.

So 81,828 +6,819 =88,647.

But 88,647 is less than 90,066.

The difference is 90,066 -88,647=1,419.

Now, 1,419 /1363.8 ≈1.041.

So 65 +1.041≈66.041°C.

So around 66.04°C, which would round to 66.0, option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 66.0, which would be the correct choice.

To determine the equilibrium temperature when 0.300 kg of coffee at 70.0°C is poured into a 0.120-kg aluminum cup at 20.0°C, we use the principle of calorimetry: the heat lost by the coffee equals the heat gained by the cup. The formula is:

\[
Q_{\text{coffee}} = Q_{\text{cup}}
\]

The heat transfer equation is:

\[
m_{\text{coffee}} c_{\text{water}} (T_{\text{initial,coffee}} - T_{\text{eq}}) = m_{\text{cup}} c_{\text{aluminum}} (T_{\text{eq}} - T_{\text{initial,cup}})
\]

Given:
- \( m_{\text{coffee}} = 0.300 \, \text{kg}, \, c_{\text{water}} = 4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)} \)
- \( T_{\text{initial,coffee}} = 70.0 \, \text{°C} \)
- \( m_{\text{cup}} = 0.120 \, \text{kg}, \, c_{\text{aluminum}} = 900 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)} \)
- \( T_{\text{initial,cup}} = 20.0 \, \text{°C} \)

Substituting these values:

\[
0.300 \cdot 4186 \cdot (70.0 - T_{\text{eq}}) = 0.120 \cdot 900 \cdot (T_{\text{eq}} - 20.0)
\]

Simplify the coefficients:

\[
1255.8 \cdot (70.0 - T_{\text{eq}}) = 108 \cdot (T_{\text{eq}} - 20.0)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
87806 - 1255.8 T_{\text{eq}} = 108 T_{\text{eq}} - 2160
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
87806 + 2160 = 108 T_{\text{eq}} + 1255.8 T_{\text{eq}}
\]

\[
90066 = 1363.8 T_{\text{eq}}
\]

Solve for \( T_{\text{eq}} \):

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = \frac{90066}{1363.8} \approx 66.0 \, \text{°C}
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature is approximately **66.0°C**, corresponding to option **I**.
