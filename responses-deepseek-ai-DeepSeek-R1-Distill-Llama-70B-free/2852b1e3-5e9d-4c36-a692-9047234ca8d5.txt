The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Consider the ABO blood group locus in humans, which has six (6) alleles reported for it, of which three are most prominent, I^A, I^B andi. The I^A and I^B alleles are both dominant toiandcodominantto each other. A woman of blood group O marries a man who has blood group B. There are four children in the family: a son and daughter of blood group O; a daughter who has A blood type; and a son who has B blood type. One of the children is adopted. Which child is the adopted child?

Options:

A: the daughter of blood group O
B: The son with A blood type
C: the son of blood group O
D: the daughter who has blood group A
E: None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred
F: The daughter with AB blood type
G: the son who has B blood type
H: The son with AB blood type
I: The daughter with B blood type
J: The child with a rare blood type not listed

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about blood types. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on blood group genetics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about the ABO blood group system. I remember that the ABO system has three main alleles: IA, IB, and i. IA and IB are both dominant over i, and they're codominant with each other. So, someone with IA IA or IA i would have type A blood. Similarly, IB IB or IB i would be type B. If someone has IA IB, they're AB, and ii would be type O.

Now, the problem says a woman with blood group O marries a man with blood group B. They have four children: two sons with O, a daughter with A, and a son with B. But one child is adopted. I need to figure out which child is adopted.

Wait, let me clarify the parents' genotypes first. 

The woman is type O, so her genotype must be ii because O is only homozygous recessive. 

The man is type B. Since B is dominant, his genotype could be IBi or IBIB. Wait, no, IBIB would be possible, but since IA and IB are codominant, IBIB would just be IB, right? Or wait, no, IBIB would still be type B because both alleles are IB. But wait, IA and IB are codominant, so someone with IA IB would be AB. So if the man is B, his genotype is either IBi (heterozygous) or IBIB (homozygous). But wait, IBIB is possible, but in that case, all his gametes would be IB. Whereas if he's IBi, he can produce IB or i gametes.

Wait, does that matter for this problem? Let me think.

So the woman is ii, so she can only contribute i alleles. The man, if he's IBi, would contribute either IB or i. If he's IBIB, he can only contribute IB.

Now, let's look at the possible children.

Each child gets one allele from each parent. The mother can only give i. The father, depending on his genotype, gives either IB or i (if he's IBi) or only IB (if he's IBIB).

So, if the father is IBIB (homozygous), then all his children would get IB from him and i from the mother. So their genotype would be IBi, which is type B. So all the children would be type B. But wait, in the problem, the children have O, A, and B. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, if the father is IBi (heterozygous), then he can pass on IB or i. So the possible offspring would be:

- From mother's i and father's IB: IBi (type B)
- From mother's i and father's i: ii (type O)

So the possible blood types are O and B. So any child that isn't O or B couldn't be theirs.

Looking at the children: two sons O, one daughter A, and one son B. Wait, so the daughter has A. But according to this, the parents can only have children with O or B blood types. So a child with A can't be their biological child. That would mean the daughter with A is adopted.

But wait, let me double-check. The parents are O (ii) and B (IBi). So their possible children are IBi (B) and ii (O). So any child with A must be adopted. Because A requires at least one IA allele, which the father doesn't have. Because the father is IBi, so he can only pass IB or i. The mother can only pass i. So IA can't come from anywhere. So the daughter with A must be the adopted one.

Wait, but let me consider if the father could have IA somehow. No, the father's blood type is B. So his alleles are IB and i. He can't contribute IA. So the daughter with A can't be their biological child. So she must be the adopted one.

Looking at the options, option D is the daughter with blood group A. So that's the adopted child.

Wait, but the options say: 

Option D: the daughter who has blood group A.

So that's the one. So the answer should be D.

The ABO blood group system involves three main alleles: **I^A**, **I^B**, and **i**. The woman in the question has blood type O, so her genotype is **ii** (homozygous recessive). The man has blood type B, so his genotype is either **I^B i** (heterozygous) or **I^B I^B** (homozygous). However, if the man were **I^B I^B**, all his children would inherit **I^B** from him and **i** from the mother, resulting in a genotype of **I^B i** (blood type B). Since the children include individuals with blood types O, A, and B, the man must be heterozygous (**I^B i**).

When the mother (**ii**) and father (**I^B i**) have children, the possible genotypes and blood types are as follows:
- **I^B i** (blood type B, from father contributing **I^B** and mother contributing **i**)
- **i i** (blood type O, from father contributing **i** and mother contributing **i**)

Thus, the biological children of these parents can only have blood types O or B. A child with blood type A requires at least one **I^A** allele, which neither parent can contribute. Therefore, the daughter with blood type A cannot be their biological child and must be the adopted child.

**Answer: D**
