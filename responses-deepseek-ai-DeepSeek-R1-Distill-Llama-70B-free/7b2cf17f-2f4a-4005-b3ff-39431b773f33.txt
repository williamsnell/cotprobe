Hmm, okay, so I have this question about natural selection, and I need to figure out the smallest unit it can affect. Let's see, the question is asking which of the options is the smallest unit that natural selection can change. The options are from A to J, and each represents a different biological concept.

Wait, natural selection works on variation in populations. I remember that natural selection acts on phenotypes because the environment affects the traits that individuals have. So the process is about survival and reproduction based on how well an organism's traits fit the environment. But the actual change over time happens at the genetic level, like in allele frequencies.

So the smallest unit... Let me think. Individuals have phenotypes and genotypes. But natural selection can't act on a single individual's genotype directly. It's more about how the population's gene pool changes over generations. Oh wait, but the question is about the smallest unit that can be changed. So maybe we're looking for the level at which selection can cause a change.

Wait, natural selection can act on individuals. Because individuals with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes. But the effect is seen in the population's gene frequencies. So the unit that's changing is the population's gene frequency because that's how the overall genetic makeup shifts.

Looking at the options, option I is a population's gene frequency. That makes sense because natural selection leads to changes in allele frequencies in a population, which is the basis of evolution. So this would be the unit that changes as a result of selection.

Wait, but what about other options? Option F is species' gene frequency. But species are much larger groups, so it's the population level that's the immediate unit. So I think I is correct.

Natural selection acts on individuals based on their phenotypes, as their traits influence survival and reproduction. However, the changes resulting from natural selection are reflected at the population level, specifically in the alteration of allele frequencies over generations. Among the options provided, the smallest unit that natural selection can change is the population's gene frequency, as this directly represents the genetic shifts driven by selection.

Answer: I
