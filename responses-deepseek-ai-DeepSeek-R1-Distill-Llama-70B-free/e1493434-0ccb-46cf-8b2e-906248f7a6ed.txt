Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about depreciation using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. Hmm, I remember that depreciation is about spreading the cost of an asset over its useful life. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method here. Let me think.

The problem says Hershberg's Accounting Service bought a computer for $6,300,000. It will last 35 years and then be worthless. We need to find the depreciation for the first three years using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method.

Wait, sum-of-the-years'-digits. Oh right, that's a type of accelerated depreciation method. I think it means that the depreciation is higher in the early years and less in later years. So how does the calculation work?

From what I remember, the sum of the years' digits is calculated by adding up the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the useful life. So for 35 years, the sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 35. Oh wait, I think there's a formula for that. The sum is (n(n+1))/2. Let's plug in n=35. So (35 * 36)/2 = (1260)/2 = 630. So the sum is 630.

Right, so each year's depreciation is a fraction of the total cost. The fraction for each year is the year's digit divided by the sum. So for the first year, it's 35/630, second year 34/630, third year 33/630, and so on until the 35th year, which is 1/630.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me get this straight. The digits are from 1 to 35, so the first year is 35, the second 34, etc., because the digits are being summed in reverse. So the first year's depreciation is 35/sum, which is 35/630. So each year's depreciation rate is (35 - year +1)/630. Or wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, the sum is 630. Each year's depreciation is (remaining years including current) divided by sum. So for the first year, it's 35/630. Second year, 34/630, third year 33/630, etc. Because in the first year, you have 35 years of life left, so the digit is 35, then 34, down to 1.

So the first year's depreciation would be (35/630) * cost. The cost is $6,300,000. So 35 divided by 630 is like 35/630 = 1/18. So 630 is 35 * 18, right? 35*18=630. So 35/630 is 1/18. So 6,300,000 * (1/18) = 350,000. So first year is $350,000.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 6,300,000 divided by 18. 6,300,000 / 18 = 350,000. Yeah.

Then the second year: 34/630. Let me compute that. 34/630. Let's see, 630 divided by 34 is approximately 18.529, but maybe it's better to compute 34/630 as a fraction. 34 and 630 are both divisible by 2, so 17/315. Hmm, I can compute that as a decimal. 17 divided by 315. Let me see, 315 goes into 17 zero, then 170 divided by 315 is about 0.539. Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 34/630 * 6,300,000.

Wait 6,300,000 is 6.3e6. So 34/630 * 6.3e6 = (34 * 6.3e6) /630. Let's compute 6.3e6 /630 first. 6,300,000 /630 = 10,000. Because 630 *10,000 is 6,300,000. So 6.3e6 /630 is 10,000. So then multiply by 34: 34 *10,000 = 340,000. So second year is 340,000.

Similarly, third year would be 33/630. So 33/630 *6,300,000. Again, 6.3e6 /630 is 10,000, so 33 *10,000=330,000. So third year is 330,000.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 350k, 340k, 330k. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 310,300,290

B: 360,350,340

C:300,290,280

D:330,320,310

E:400,390,380

F:320,310,300

G:340,330,320

H:350,340,330

I:370,360,350

J:380,370,360

Hmm, so the first three years would be 350k, 340k, 330k. Looking at the options, H is 350, 340, 330. So that would be option H.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. Because sometimes I might get the order wrong. Wait, in the sum-of-years digits, the first year is the highest, then decreases each year. So yes, 35,34,33 as the digits for the first three years. So yes, the first year is 35/630=1/18, which is 350k, then 34/630, which is 340k, then 33/630= 330k.

So the first three years are $350,000, $340,000, $330,000. So the correct answer should be option H.

To calculate the depreciation for the first three years using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the sum of the years' digits**:  
   The useful life of the computer is 35 years. The sum of the digits is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{35 \times 36}{2} = 630
   \]

2. **Calculate the depreciation for each year**:  
   The depreciation for each year is calculated as a fraction of the asset's cost, where the fraction is the year's digit divided by the sum of the years' digits.  
   - **First year**:  
     \[
     \text{Depreciation} = \frac{35}{630} \times 6,300,000 = 350,000
     \]
   - **Second year**:  
     \[
     \text{Depreciation} = \frac{34}{630} \times 6,300,000 = 340,000
     \]
   - **Third year**:  
     \[
     \text{Depreciation} = \frac{33}{630} \times 6,300,000 = 330,000
     \]

3. **Match the results with the options**:  
   The depreciation for the first three years is $350,000, $340,000, and $330,000. Comparing this with the given options, the correct choice is **H**.
