Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a farsighted student and his glasses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let's try to work through this. 

Alright, the question says the student is farsighted and uses glasses to read a book at 20 cm from his eyes. His near-point distance is 63 cm, and the glasses are 1.5 cm from his eyes. I need to find the refractive power of the glasses' lenses.

Wait, I remember that farsightedness, or hyperopia, means someone can see distant objects clearly but struggles with nearby objects. So the near point is the closest point where they can focus. In this case, the near point is 63 cm without glasses, but with glasses, he can read at 20 cm. 

So the glasses must be correcting his vision. I think this involves the lens formula. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. But wait, for a corrective lens, the image is formed at the near point when the object is at the reading distance. 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The student's near point is 63 cm without glasses. So, when he wears glasses, the glasses create a virtual image of the book (which is at 20 cm) at his near point (63 cm). Because for a farsighted person, the eye can't focus on close objects, so the glasses must make the object appear farther away. 

Wait, no, wait. Oh right! When a farsighted person uses glasses, the glasses are converging lenses. The idea is that the glasses take the near object (at 20 cm) and form an image just beyond their near point. So the object is at 20 cm, and the image is at 63 cm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the image is formed at the near point of the eye, which is where the eye can focus.

But wait, the object distance in the lens formula is the distance from the lens to the object. But the glasses are 1.5 cm from the eyes. So the actual object distance for the lens would be 20 cm minus 1.5 cm? Or is it 20 cm as given?

Wait, no, the object is 20 cm from his eyes, but the glasses are 1.5 cm in front. So the distance from the lens to the object is 20 cm minus 1.5 cm, which is 18.5 cm. Because the object is on the same side as the eye, so it's a real object. 

And the image formed by the lens must be at the near point, which is 63 cm from the eye. But the image is formed on the same side as the object, because it's a converging lens creating a virtual image. Or wait, for a converging lens used to correct hyperopia, the image is formed behind the lens, which would be virtual. Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, converging lenses can form real or virtual images. For a hyperopic eye, the image formed by the cornea and lens falls behind the retina. So the corrective lens makes the image appear closer, so that the eye's lens can focus it. So in this case, the glasses create a virtual image of the book at the near point, which is 63 cm from the eye. But since the glasses are 1.5 cm away, the image distance from the lens would be 63 cm minus 1.5 cm, which is 61.5 cm. But wait, image distance for a virtual image is considered negative in the sign conventions. So di would be -61.5 cm, perhaps? Or do I just take the magnitude?

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me get the lens formula straight.

The formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Here, do is the object distance, di is the image distance.

In this scenario, the object is at 20 cm from the eye, which is 18.5 cm from the lens (since the glasses are 1.5 cm away). So do = 18.5 cm.

The image formed by the lens needs to be at the near point, which is 63 cm from the eye. But since the image is virtual and on the same side as the object (because the lens is converging and the object is within the focal length?), wait no, wait. Wait, when the object is placed within the focal length of a converging lens, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. Oh wait, no: for a converging lens, if the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual, upright, and on the same side as the object. So in this case, if the object is 18.5 cm, and the lens has a certain focal length, the image would be virtual.

Wait, but the near point is 63 cm from the eye, which is on the same side as the object. So the image distance from the lens is 63 cm minus 1.5 cm, which is 61.5 cm. But since the image is virtual, di would be negative. So di = -61.5 cm.

Wait, no. Wait, the image is formed at 63 cm from the eye, which is on the same side as the object (because the book is in front of the eye). So for the lens, the image is virtual, so di is negative. Let me calculate do and di.

do = 20 cm (distance from eye) minus 1.5 cm (glasses distance) = 18.5 cm. So do is 18.5 cm.

The image must be at 63 cm from the eye, which is 63 cm - 1.5 cm = 61.5 cm from the lens. But since the image is virtual (because it's a converging lens and the object is inside the focal length?), wait, no. Wait, the image is virtual, so di is negative. So di = -61.5 cm.

Wait, no, wait. The image is virtual, so in the lens formula, di is negative. So the image distance from the lens would be -61.5 cm.

So plugging into the formula: 1/f = (1/18.5) + (1/(-61.5)).

Wait, let me calculate that.

Compute 1/18.5 ≈ 0.05405, and 1/(-61.5) ≈ -0.01627.

Adding them gives 0.05405 - 0.01627 ≈ 0.03778.

So 1/f ≈ 0.03778, which means f ≈ 26.53 cm.

Wait, but the question is asking for the refractive power, which is 1/f in diopters. Since 1 diopter is 1/m, so if f is in meters, then 1/f is diopters.

So f is approximately 26.53 cm, which is 0.2653 meters. So 1/f ≈ 3.77 diopters.

Wait, wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 1/26.53 is approximately 0.0377, which would be 3.77 diopters. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 3.846, option E is 4.346, option I is 3.5, option J is 3.0, etc.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Calculate 1/18.5:

18.5 = 37/2. So 1/18.5 = 2/37 ≈ 0.054054.

1/61.5: 61.5 = 123/2. So 1/61.5 = 2/123 ≈ 0.016278.

Wait, but di is -61.5, so 1/di is -1/61.5 ≈ -0.016278.

So 1/f = 0.054054 - 0.016278 = 0.037776.

So f = 1 / 0.037776 ≈ 26.53 cm. So 26.53 cm is 0.2653 meters.

Refractive power D = 1/f (in meters) = 1 / 0.2653 ≈ 3.77 D.

Looking at the options, I don't see 3.77. Let's see the options again.

Options are: 

A:4.5, B:2.0, C:3.846, D:4.0, E:4.346, F:2.5, G:2.846, H:5.0, I:3.5, J:3.0.

Hmm, none exactly match 3.77. The closest is C:3.846 and I:3.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the setup. Did I get the image distance right?

Wait, the image is formed at the near point, which is 63 cm from the eye. So the image distance from the lens would be 63 cm minus the 1.5 cm (distance between eye and glasses). So 63 -1.5 = 61.5 cm. But since the image is virtual, di is negative, so di = -61.5 cm.

Wait, but wait another thing: when dealing with the near point, the image is formed at the near point of the eye when the object is at the reading distance. So for a farsighted person, the image without glasses would fall behind the retina. The glasses create a virtual image that the eye can focus on.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the image distance from the lens as being equal to the near point distance minus the distance between the glasses and the eye. Wait, but the near point is the closest point the eye can focus without glasses, so with glasses, the image is formed at that point.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The student can read a book at 20 cm when wearing the glasses. So the object distance (from the lens) is 20 cm minus 1.5 cm, which is 18.5 cm. The image formed by the glasses must be at a point where the eye can focus, which is 63 cm from the eye. But the image is formed on the same side as the object, so di is negative.

Wait, but another approach: the formula for the power needed for reading glasses is D = (1/(do)) + (1/di), where do is the object distance from the lens, and di is the image distance from the lens.

Alternatively, the near point di is given as 63 cm from the eye, which is 61.5 cm from the lens. So di is -61.5 cm (since it's a virtual image).

So let me plug these into the formula:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

do is 18.5 cm, di is -61.5 cm.

1/do = 1/18.5 ≈ 0.054054.

1/di = 1/(-61.5) ≈ -0.016278.

Adding them: 0.054054 - 0.016278 = 0.037776.

So 1/f = 0.037776, so f = 1/0.037776 ≈ 26.53 cm.

So D (power) is 1/f in meters: 26.53 cm = 0.2653 m. So 1/0.2653 ≈ 3.77 D.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly 3.77. The closest is option C:3.846 and I:3.5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image distance. Maybe the image is formed at 63 cm from the eye, but on the same side as the object, so di is positive? No, that doesn't make sense because the image would be real if di is positive, which would require the object to be beyond the focal length. Wait, no: for a converging lens, when the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So di is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly with signs. Let's use the standard sign conventions:

- Object distance (do) is positive because it's a real object.

- Image distance (di) is negative because it's a virtual image on the same side as the object.

So, using this, let me recompute.

do = 18.5 cm.

di = -61.5 cm.

1/f = 1/do + 1/di = (1/18.5) + (1/-61.5).

Let me compute this more accurately.

1/18.5 = 0.054054054...

1/61.5 = 0.016278023...

So 1/di is negative: -0.016278023.

Adding them: 0.054054054 - 0.016278023 = 0.037776031.

So 1/f = 0.037776031 cm^-1.

Wait, but f is in cm here, so 1/f ≈ 0.037776 cm^-1, so f ≈ 26.53 cm.

Wait, no, wait: 1/f is in cm^-1, so f is 1/(0.037776) cm ≈ 26.53 cm.

But to get the power in diopters, which is 1/f in meters, we have:

f = 26.53 cm = 0.2653 m.

So D = 1/0.2653 ≈ 3.77 diopters.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match 3.77. Let me check the options again.

Looking for 3.77, the closest is option C:3.846 and I:3.5. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute more precisely.

Wait, let's compute 1/18.5 and 1/61.5 more accurately.

1/18.5 = 2/37 ≈ 0.054054054.

1/61.5 = 2/(123) ≈ 0.016278023.

So 1/f = 0.054054054 - 0.016278023 = 0.037776031.

1/f = 0.037776031 cm^-1.

So f = 1 / 0.037776031 ≈ 26.53 cm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/f more accurately. Let me compute 1/18.5 exactly as a fraction.

18.5 = 37/2. So 1/18.5 = 2/37.

Similarly, 61.5 is 123/2, so 1/61.5 = 2/123.

So 1/f = (2/37) - (2/123) = ?

Let me compute this with a common denominator. The denominators are 37 and 123. 123 is 3*41, 37 is prime. So the least common denominator is 37*3*41 = 37*123= 4551.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to compute each fraction as a decimal to more places.

Alternatively, compute 2/37 ≈ 0.054054054.

2/123 ≈ 0.016278023.

So 0.054054054 - 0.016278023 = 0.037776031.

So 1/f = 0.037776031, so f ≈ 26.53 cm.

Wait, but 1/26.53 is approximately 0.0377, which is 3.77 diopters.

Looking at the options, option C is 3.846, which is approximately 3.85. Hmm, that's a bit higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the image distance as positive. Let me see what happens if I take di as positive 61.5 cm.

Wait, that would mean the image is real, which would require the object to be beyond the focal length. But in that case, for a converging lens, when the object is beyond f, the image is real and inverted.

But that doesn't make sense in this scenario because the image needs to be virtual so the eye can focus on it. So perhaps the initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from the assumption that the image is formed at 63 cm from the eye, which is the near point without glasses. When the student wears glasses, the image is formed at his near point, which is 63 cm from his eye. So the image distance from the glasses would be 63 cm minus 1.5 cm, which is 61.5 cm. But this is the distance from the lens to the image, which is virtual, so di is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should verify the formula again. The formula for the power needed for reading is D = 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

But perhaps another approach is using the near point formula. The formula for the power of reading glasses is given by D = (1/(do)) + (1/di), where do is the distance from the lens to the object, and di is the distance from the lens to the image.

Wait, another way to think: The student's near point is 63 cm from his eyes. So when he wears the glasses, the glasses must take the object at 20 cm and form an image at 63 cm. So the object is 20 cm from the eye, which is 18.5 cm from the lens. The image is 63 cm from the eye, so 61.5 cm from the lens, but on the same side as the object, so it's a virtual image, so di is negative.

Wait, but maybe I should set up the equation without worrying about the sign, then adjust at the end.

So:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di

do = 18.5 cm.

di = 63 cm - 1.5 cm = 61.5 cm. But wait, di is the image distance from the lens. Since the image is virtual, di is negative, so di = -61.5 cm.

So 1/f = (1/18.5) + (1/-61.5) = (1/18.5) - (1/61.5).

Calculating each term:

1/18.5 ≈ 0.054054.

1/61.5 ≈ 0.016278.

So 0.054054 - 0.016278 = 0.037776.

So f ≈ 26.53 cm.

Thus, the power D is 1/f meters. So 26.53 cm is 0.2653 m. So D = 1 / 0.2653 ≈ 3.77 D.

Hmm, but this isn't matching any of the options exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake
