Okay, so I've got this problem about the compressibility of oil in a hydraulic press. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the volume of oil is 5 cubic feet. We need to find the decrease in volume when it's subjected to a pressure of 2000 lb per square inch. The compressibility is given as 20 × 10^-6 per atmosphere. Hmm, wait, I remember that compressibility (probably the bulk compressibility modulus) relates pressure change to volume change.

Wait, the formula I think I need is the one that relates change in volume (ΔV) to the compressibility (β), pressure change (ΔP), and the original volume (V). The formula is something like ΔV = -β * V * ΔP. Oh right, because when pressure increases, volume decreases, so it's negative.

But wait, I should make sure about the units. The problem gives pressure in lb/in² and the compressibility in per atm. So I might need to convert the pressure into atmospheres.

Let me jot down the given values:

V = 5 ft³
ΔP = 2000 lb/in²
β = 20e-6 atm^-1

Wait, but wait, β's units are per atm, so I need to convert ΔP into atm. Because right now, ΔP is in lb/in². How many atmospheres are in 2000 lb/in²?

I remember that 1 atm is approximately 14.6959 psi (pounds per square inch). So 1 atm = 14.6959 lb/in². So to convert 2000 lb/in² to atm, I divide by 14.6959.

Let me calculate that: 2000 / 14.6959 ≈ let's see, 2000 /14.7 is about 136. (Because 14.7 * 136 = 1999.2, which is close to 2000.)

So ΔP ≈ 136 atm.

Now, plug into the formula:

ΔV = -β * V * ΔP

So beta is 20e-6 atm^-1, V is 5 ft³, ΔP is 136 atm.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula. Is β defined as the isothermal compressibility, so that β = (1/V)(ΔV/ΔP), so ΔV/V = β ΔP, so ΔV = β V ΔP. But wait, when pressure increases, volume decreases, so ΔV is negative. So yeah, ΔV = -β V ΔP.

So plugging in the numbers:

β = 20e-6 (per atm)
V =5 ft³
ΔP =136 atm.

So ΔV = - (20e-6) *5 *136

Calculating that:

20e-6 is 0.00002.

Multiply by 5: 0.00002 *5 =0.0001.

Multiply by 136: 0.0001 *136=0.0136.

So ΔV= -0.0136 ft³.

Looking at the options, option D is -0.0136 ft³. So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we use the formula relating the change in volume (ΔV) to the compressibility (β), the original volume (V), and the pressure change (ΔP):

\[
\Delta V = -\beta \cdot V \cdot \Delta P
\]

### Given:
- \( V = 5 \, \text{ft}^3 \)
- \( \Delta P = 2000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \)
- \( \beta = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{atm}^{-1} \)

### Step 1: Convert pressure to atmospheres
Since \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 14.6959 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{2000}{14.6959} \approx 136 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the change in volume
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta V = -(20 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 5 \cdot 136
\]

First, calculate \( 20 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 5 = 0.0001 \). Then:

\[
\Delta V = -0.0001 \cdot 136 = -0.0136 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
The decrease in volume is \( -0.0136 \, \text{ft}^3 \), which corresponds to option **D**.
