Okay, so I've got this question about ethics and legality in a school psychology scenario. Let me try to work through this step by step. 

The situation is that a non-custodial parent is asking Dr. Maxine Miller, a school psychologist, for the test results of his 5th-grade son. The question is whether complying with this request would be ethical, legal, or both, or neither.

First, I need to understand the roles and the applicable laws. I remember that in the United States, schools and school psychologists are subject to FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. FERPA protects the privacy of student education records, and it gives certain rights to parents regarding their child's records. But wait, FERPA applies to parents, but what about non-custodial parents? 

I think FERPA generally allows schools to provide information to both custodial and non-custodial parents unless there's a court order saying otherwise. So, if the father is the non-custodial parent but there's no court order restricting access, the school might be allowed to share the records. But I'm not entirely sure about that. 

Then there's the aspect of professional ethics. The APA (American Psychological Association) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct would apply here. I recall that psychologists must protect the confidentiality of the information they obtain, and they must only release information with proper consent. In the case of minors, consent usually comes from the legal guardian or the parent with legal custody. 

So, the non-custodial parent might not have the legal authority to consent to the release of records unless FERPA allows it. But wait, FERPA defines "parent" as including any parent, whether custodial or not, unless a court order says otherwise. So under FERPA, the school might be required to provide the records to the non-custodial parent unless there's a court order preventing it.

In this scenario, the question doesn't mention any court orders, so I'm assuming there are none. Therefore, under FERPA, the school psychologist would be legally allowed to release the test results to the non-custodial father. 

Now, considering the ethical standpoint. The APA's ethical code emphasizes respecting the rights of those who are the legal guardians. If the non-custodial parent doesn't have legal custody, the psychologist might have an ethical obligation to ensure that the release of information is appropriate. However, I'm a bit confused because FERPA's legal requirements might take precedence, meaning that ethically, the psychologist is acting correctly by following the law.

Wait, but if the school's policy or FERPA requires the psychologist to release the information, then ethically she might be in the clear because she's following the legal guidelines. But I'm also thinking about the concept of "professional rights." Does she have the professional right to release the information? Well, if FERPA allows it, then perhaps she's acting within her professional rights. 

So, putting it together: If she complies, is she acting legally and ethically? Or is there a conflict?

I think FERPA would make it legal for her to provide the records, as the non-custodial parent is still a parent under FERPA unless a court order exists. So legally, she's allowed to do so. Ethically, if the law requires it, then she's also acting ethically because she's following the legal and ethical guidelines. But wait, could there be an ethical consideration where she should check with the custodial parent first? Or is that not necessary under the law?

I think the law (FERPA) doesn't require her to get permission from the other parent if the non-custodial parent is requesting. So she's legally in the clear. Ethically, following the law would be the right thing to do, so she's acting ethically as well. 

So the options are looking for whether she acted legally and ethically. Let me look at the options again:

Option J is "legally and ethically." So if she complies, she's acting both legally and ethically.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes ethical guidelines can be stricter than the law. For instance, even if the law allows it, maybe the psychologist should consider the best interest of the child or the dynamics between the parents. But in this case, the question doesn't provide any context about potential harm or the child's wishes, so I think the default is to follow FERPA and the ethical code that aligns with it.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that she acted legally and ethically, which is option J.

The scenario involves a non-custodial parent requesting test results from a school psychologist. Under FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), schools are generally allowed to provide education records to both custodial and non-custodial parents unless a court order restricts access. Since no court order is mentioned, FERPA likely permits the release of the records, making the action legal. 

Ethically, psychologists must adhere to confidentiality and obtain proper consent, typically from legal guardians. However, FERPA defines "parent" broadly, and complying with the law aligns with ethical obligations. Thus, the psychologist acts both legally and ethically by releasing the records.
