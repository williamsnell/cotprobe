Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: "If total product of labor is rising at an increasing rate," and then I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, especially in production and cost, there are concepts like total product, marginal product, and average product. I think I need to recall how these relate to each other.

So, total product of labor (TPL) is the total output produced with a given amount of labor. When TPL is rising at an increasing rate, that means the slope of the TPL curve is getting steeper over time. I think this relates to the marginal product of labor (MPL), which is the derivative of the TPL, or the additional output from adding one more unit of labor.

Wait, if TPL is increasing at an increasing rate, that would mean that the MPL is rising, right? Because if each additional unit of labor adds more than the previous one, the total product's growth is accelerating.

Let me think about the relationship between these. TPL is like the total output, MPL is the slope at each point. So if TPL is rising faster, then each new worker adds more output than the last. So MPL is increasing.

Now, looking at the options:

Option E says "marginal product of labor is rising." That seems to fit. So the answer would be E.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Option A: Marginal product is at its minimum. No, if MPL is rising, it's not at its minimum.

Option B: Average product is at its maximum. Hmm, average product is total product divided by the number of workers. The maximum average product occurs where MPL equals average product. But I'm not sure how that relates directly to TPL rising at an increasing rate. Maybe if MPL is rising, average product could be increasing, but I'm not certain whether it's at its maximum. I think that's a different concept.

Option C: Total cost decreasing. Wait, total cost is usually labor cost times wage rate. If more workers are being added and MPL is rising, maybe costs are increasing, not decreasing. So probably not C.

Option D: Average product is falling. I don't think so. If MPL is rising, then each new worker adds more, which would probably cause average product to rise as well, unless there's some diminishing returns elsewhere. But if TPL is rising at an increasing rate, average product should be rising, so D is probably incorrect.

Option E: MPL is rising. Yeah, that's what I thought earlier. So E seems correct.

Option F: Marginal cost is rising. Marginal cost is the derivative of total cost. If production is increasing and if there's diminishing returns, MC might be rising, but I'm not sure how this directly connects to TPL rising at an increasing rate. Maybe, but the question is about MPL, not MC.

Option G: MPL is constant. No, because if TPL's rate is increasing, MPL must be increasing.

Option H: MPL is falling. That's the opposite of what's happening here, so no.

Option I: MPL is at its maximum. Well, it's rising, but whether it's at the maximum point depends on where you are on the curve. The question doesn't say anything about maximum, just that it's rising.

Option J: TPL is at maximum. No, TPL is still rising, so it's not at its maximum.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: marginal product of labor is rising.

When the total product of labor (TPL) is rising at an increasing rate, it implies that the marginal product of labor (MPL) is also rising. This is because MPL represents the additional output generated by each additional unit of labor, and an accelerating TPL indicates that each new worker is contributing more than the previous one. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. MPL is not at its minimum; it is rising.  
- **B**: Incorrect. The maximum average product occurs where MPL equals average product, but this is unrelated to TPL rising at an increasing rate.  
- **C**: Incorrect. Total cost is unlikely to decrease as more labor is added and MPL rises.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Average product is likely rising, not falling, as MPL increases.  
- **E**: Correct. MPL is rising, consistent with TPL increasing at an increasing rate.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Marginal cost is not directly addressed by the question.  
- **G**: Incorrect. MPL is not constant; it is rising.  
- **H**: Incorrect. MPL is not falling; it is rising.  
- **I**: Incorrect. MPL is rising but not necessarily at its maximum.  
- **J**: Incorrect. TPL is still rising, not at its maximum.  

Thus, the correct answer is **E: marginal product of labor is rising**.
