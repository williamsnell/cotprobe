Question:

A motorist's negligent driving seriously injured another driver. The motorist was cited for traveling in the wrong lane and paid a fine. The motorist had a policy limit of only $15,000 for third party liability on his insurance policy. After furnishing the motorist's insurer with a full medical report, all medical bills, medical records, and other required proofs of damages, the injured claimant demanded the policy limits. The claimant gave notice that a bad faith claim would be filed if the policy limits were not paid immediately. The insurance company refused payment without explanation. A jury awarded the injured claimant $200,000. The injured claimant obtained a signed assignment from the negligent motorist giving to the claimant any rights that the motorist may have had against his insurer. Will the court likely compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the jury verdict to injured person under these facts?

Options:

A: The court will not compel the insurance company to pay because the motorist was at fault, not the insurance company.
B: Bad faith is personal to the insured party and his insurer  the assignment was invalid, and the injured person has no claim to compel the insurer to pay.
C: The insurance company is liable to pay the full amount as they failed to act in good faith and fair dealing, regardless of the policy limit.
D: The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.
E: The injured person can only claim up to the policy limit from the insurer, and must seek the remaining amount from the motorist directly.
F: The injured party must enforce his entire judgment against the motorist and may never pursue the insurer for that amount.
G: The insurance company can only be compelled to pay if they were given a reasonable opportunity to settle the claim within the policy limits.
H: The policy limit is $15,000 and that is all that can be collected by the injured person  there is no action for bad faith on an insurance contract.
I: The insurance company can be compelled to pay the full amount only if they were given prior warning about the potential for a bad faith claim.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about insurance and bad faith. Let's break it down step by step.

The situation is that a motorist was driving negligently, hurt someone else. He got cited, paid a fine. His insurance has a $15k policy limit for third-party liability. The injured claimant sent all the medical reports and bills to the insurer and asked for the policy limits. They threatened a bad faith claim if not paid immediately. The insurance company refused without explanation. Then a jury awarded $200k to the claimant.

Now, the injured person got an assignment from the motorist, giving them any rights the motorist had against the insurer. The question is, will the court make the insurance company pay the full $200k?

Hmm, I remember that insurance companies have a duty of good faith and fair dealing. If they act in bad faith, there can be consequences beyond just the policy limits. But usually, the insured (the motorist) would be the one to sue the insurer for bad faith. But here, the injured claimant has an assignment from the motorist, so maybe they can step into the motorist's shoes.

Wait, so the claimant now has the motorist's rights against the insurer. If the insurer breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing towards the motorist, then the motorist could potentially sue for more than the policy limits. But since the motorist assigned those rights, the claimant can now pursue that.

So in this case, the insurance company refused to pay the policy limits without explanation, even after the claimant provided all the necessary documentation. That sounds like bad faith. The insurer's refusal to pay without reason might be a breach of their duty. 

If the court finds bad faith, the insurer could be liable for the entire judgment, not just the policy limits. Because the assignment allows the claimant to assert the motorist's rights, including any bad faith claims.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the insurance company is liable to pay the full amount because they failed to act in good faith, regardless of policy limit. That sounds right, but I'm not sure if it's regardless of the policy limit or if it's because of bad faith.

Option D says the insurer breached the implied covenant and must pay the full judgment. That also sounds correct, but I think it's more about bad faith rather than just the covenant.

Wait, what's the difference between options C and D? I think bad faith is a specific tort, and the covenant of good faith is a contractual obligation. So if the insurer acted in bad faith, they could be liable beyond the policy limits.

Option E says the injured person can only get up to policy limits from the insurer and must go after the motorist for the rest. But if the insurer acted in bad faith, they might have to pay more.

Option G says the insurer can be compelled only if they had a chance to settle within policy limits. Well, the claimant did offer to settle for the policy limits and the insurer refused without explanation, so that might fit.

But the key here is the assignment. The claimant now has the motorist's rights, so if the motorist could have sued the insurer for bad faith, the claimant can now do that.

So the court would likely hold the insurance company liable for the full amount because they acted in bad faith, especially after refusing to pay the policy limits when they should have. So the correct answer would be either C or D.

Wait, but the options. Option C says "regardless of the policy limit." Option D says it's about the implied covenant. I think the key issue is bad faith, which goes beyond the policy limits. So maybe the answer is C or D.

Wait, but another thought: The insurer's duty of good faith is to the insured, not the claimant. But with the assignment, the claimant can take on the insured's rights. So if the insurer breached their duty to the insured (motorist), and that breach caused the motorist to be exposed to a larger judgment, the insurer might be liable for the excess.

So, in this case, the motorist's policy was $15k, but the judgment was $200k. If the insurer had paid the $15k, the motorist might have been judgment-proof for the rest. But by not paying, they exposed the motorist to a larger judgment, which the motorist can't pay, so the claimant is going after the insurer for bad faith.

So the court would likely make the insurer pay the full amount because they acted in bad faith, and the assignment allows the claimant to pursue that.

Looking back at the options, option C says the insurer is liable to pay the full amount for failing to act in good faith, regardless of the policy limit. That seems to fit.

Option D is about breaching the implied covenant, which is a bit broader. Bad faith is a specific type of breach of that covenant. So both C and D could be correct, but I think option C is more precise because it mentions bad faith.

Wait, but another angle: Some jurisdictions allow an injured third party to sue the insurer directly for bad faith if the insurer's actions caused the third party harm. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. The assignment might be a better route.

So the correct answer is probably C: The insurance company is liable to pay the full amount as they failed to act in good faith and fair dealing, regardless of the policy limit.

Alternatively, option D could be correct if it's about the covenant of good faith. But I'm leaning towards C because it explicitly mentions bad faith.

The question revolves around whether the insurance company can be compelled to pay the full jury verdict of $200,000 to the injured claimant, despite the policy limit of $15,000, after the motorist assigned his rights against the insurer to the claimant. The key issue is whether the insurance company acted in bad faith by refusing to pay the policy limits without explanation, despite being furnished with all necessary documentation.

The insurance company's duty of good faith and fair dealing is typically owed to the insured (the motorist). However, through the assignment, the injured claimant has stepped into the motorist's shoes and can now assert the motorist's rights against the insurer. If the insurer's refusal to pay the policy limits constitutes bad faith, they may be liable for the full judgment, as bad faith can expose the insurer to liability beyond the policy limits.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the insurer, not just the motorist, may be liable for bad faith.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the assignment is valid, allowing the claimant to pursue the motorist's rights against the insurer.
- **Option C** correctly identifies that the insurer's failure to act in good faith and fair dealing makes them liable for the full amount, regardless of the policy limit.
- **Option D** is close but less precise, as it focuses on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing without explicitly addressing bad faith.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the claimant can pursue the insurer directly for bad faith, not just up to the policy limit.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the claimant does not need to enforce the judgment solely against the motorist.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the claimant did give the insurer an opportunity to settle within the policy limits, which the insurer refused without explanation.
- **Option H** is incorrect because bad faith can result in liability beyond the policy limit.
- **Option I** is incorrect because the claimant's warning about a bad faith claim is not a prerequisite for establishing bad faith.

The most accurate answer is **Option C**, as it directly addresses the insurer's bad faith and the resulting liability for the full judgment.
