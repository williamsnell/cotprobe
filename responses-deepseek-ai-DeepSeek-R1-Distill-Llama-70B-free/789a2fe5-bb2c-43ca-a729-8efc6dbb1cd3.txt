Okay, so I've got this problem here about Paul paying interest on a loan. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says he borrowed $1,285 for 2 and a half years, and the interest rate is 5 and a half percent. I need to find out how much interest he paid.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula, but I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T. Oh right, where I is the interest, P is principal, R is the rate, and T is time. But wait, sometimes people use different formulas, like maybe compound interest? But the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume it's simple interest.

So breaking it down: P is $1,285. R is 5.5%, which I think I need to convert to a decimal. So 5.5 divided by 100 is 0.055. T is 2.5 years because 2 and a half is the same as 2.5.

Putting it all together, I = 1285 * 0.055 * 2.5. Let me calculate that step by step. First, 1285 multiplied by 0.055. Let me do that: 1285 * 0.05 is 64.25, and 1285 * 0.005 is 6.425. Adding those together gives 70.675. Now multiply that by 2.5. Hmm, 70.675 * 2 is 141.35, and 70.675 * 0.5 is 35.3375. Adding those, 141.35 +35.3375 equals 176.6875. So around $176.69.

Looking at the options, option B is $176.69. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thoughtâ€”am I using the right formula? If it's simple interest, that's correct. But if it's compound interest, the formula would be different. The question doesn't specify compounding, so I think simple interest is right. Also, the time is in years, which is fine.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the multiplication steps. Let's see, 1285 * 0.055. Oh wait, another way to calculate 0.055 is 5.5%, so 1% is 12.85, so 5% is 64.25, and 0.5% is 6.425. So 64.25 +6.425 =70.675. Then multiply by 2.5 gives 176.6875, which rounds to 176.69. Yep, that's right.

To calculate the interest Paul paid on his loan, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$1,285 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 5.5\% = 0.055 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = 2.5 \) years (loan duration).

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 1285 \cdot 0.055 \cdot 2.5
\]

First, calculate \( 1285 \cdot 0.055 \):
\[
1285 \cdot 0.05 = 64.25, \quad 1285 \cdot 0.005 = 6.425 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 64.25 + 6.425 = 70.675
\]

Then, multiply by \( 2.5 \):
\[
70.675 \cdot 2.5 = 176.6875
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the interest is approximately \( \$176.69 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **B: $176.69**.
