Okay, so I have this question about the postnatal growth of the maxilla. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question asks which statement is correct about the maxilla's growth after birth. There are multiple options, from A to J. Let me go through each one and see what I remember.

Option A: The maxilla stops growing after the eruption of permanent teeth. Wait, I remember that the maxilla grows throughout childhood and even into late adolescence. The permanent teeth erupt but the bones might still grow, especially in the case of the maxilla. So maybe A is incorrect because growth doesn't stop then.

Option B: Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty. I think the maxillary sinus does grow, especially during childhood. Puberty is around 12-14, but I believe the sinuses continue to develop into later years. So maybe B stops too early.

Option C: Space for permanent molars is created by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity. I'm not too sure. The maxillary tuberosity is the posterior part of the maxilla. When the molars come in, the bone might resorb to make space. Or wait, maybe it's the oppositeâ€”like, the bone grows or something else happens. Alternatively, I remember that the maxillary sinus might expand into that area, which would create space. So maybe C is not correct.

Option D: The intermaxillary suture closes immediately after birth. No, that doesn't sound right. I think the intermaxillary suture closes much later, maybe around puberty or later. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally. Hmm, eight years is around when some growth is happening, but I think the suture actually closes later. Maybe around puberty, which is more like 12-14 years. So E might not be right either.

Option F: The maxillary sinus decreases in size postnatally. That doesn't make sense. The sinuses, especially the maxillary, grow and get bigger as we develop, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Space for eruption of permanent molars is created by enlargement of the maxillary sinus. Wait, the maxillary sinus is in the maxilla. I remember that the maxillary sinus expands as we grow, especially during the eruption of the permanent teeth. That expansion could create space for the molars. So G might be correct.

Option H: The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length. I think the maxilla grows in length and height through these sutures. The zygomatic process and the maxilla grow, so H sounds correct. But I need to think about other options.

Option I: The zygomaticomaxillary sutures do not contribute to growth. That's the opposite of H, so if H is correct, I is wrong.

Option J: The maxilla doesn't grow postnatally. Definitely wrong, as the maxilla does grow after birth.

Wait, so now I have H and G as possible correct answers. Let me think again.

The maxillary sinus starts developing early on. As the maxilla grows, the sinus expands. The permanent molars erupt, and the sinus enlargement might help create space. So G could be correct.

Additionally, the zygomaticomaxillary suture is a growth site. As the zygoma grows, it pulls the maxilla, causing it to grow in length and height. So H is correct.

Wait, but can both H and G be correct? The question asks which statement is correct. Let me check the options again.

The question presents each as a separate option, so only one can be correct.

Wait, I think G might be correct because the maxillary sinus does expand, creating space for the molars. But I'm a bit confused about that. Alternatively, maybe the resorption of the maxillary tuberosity (option C) is the process. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the posterior growth of the maxilla allows for the molars. The maxillary tuberosity is the posterior part. When the molars erupt, the bone might resorb to accommodate them. So C could be correct. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: The intermaxillary suture is between the two maxillae. It's a midline suture. In the fetal period, it's where the maxillae meet. I think this suture closes much later, perhaps around puberty. So looking back at options D and E, D says immediately after birth (no), E says around eight years. I think it's more like later, maybe 12-14, but I'm not certain. So maybe E is incorrect.

So focusing back on the other options. H says the zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to the increase in height and length. I'm pretty sure that's true. The maxilla grows through these sutures, which allow for expansion as the face grows. So H is correct.

Wait, but option G: does sinus enlargement create space for molars? The maxillary sinus is in the maxilla, and as it grows, it could make room for the molars. That makes sense because the molars are in the posterior part, and the sinus might expand into that region, allowing space.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck between G and H.

Alternatively, another thought: the maxillary tuberosity is the posterior part. When the permanent molars come in, the bone remodels. I think that resorption does happen in that area to allow the molars to come through. So option C might be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: looking for the most accurate statement.

Option H: The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla.

Yes, because these sutures allow the maxilla to grow as the zygomatic bone (cheekbone) grows. The maxilla doesn't just grow in the midline but also in other dimensions. So H seems correct.

Option G: The maxillary sinus enlargement creates space for molars. I think that's also true. The sinuses expand during growth, which could help make room for the larger teeth.

So now I'm a bit confused. Are both H and G correct? But the question says which one is correct.

Wait, the question is which of the following statements is correct. So only one option can be correct.

Let me think about each statement.

Option H: The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla. I'm quite confident that's correct. Because the maxilla grows in length and height through apposition at these sutures.

Option G: Space for the eruption of the permanent molars is created by enlargement of the maxillary sinus. That also makes sense. The maxillary sinus expands as the child grows, which could create space for the molars.

Wait, but which one is correct? Both statements could be correct, but the question gives only one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, I think the maxillary sinus does expand, but does it create space for the molars? The maxillary sinus is located more superiorly, and the molars are in the alveolar process. So perhaps the expansion doesn't directly create space for the molars. Instead, the alveolar bone remodels to accommodate them. So maybe G is incorrect.

Alternatively, the expansion of the maxillary sinus might displace the posterior maxilla, allowing for molar growth. I'm not certain. Maybe C is correct instead.

Option C: Space is created by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity. The maxillary tuberosity is the posterior part of the maxilla. When the molars erupt, the bone there would resorb to make room. So that makes sense.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed thoughts. I'm more confident about H being correct. The zygomaticomaxillary suture does contribute to the growth in height and length.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is H.

To determine the correct statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The maxilla continues to grow throughout childhood and adolescence, even after the eruption of permanent teeth.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The maxillary sinus continues to develop beyond puberty.  
- **Option C**: Plausible but uncertain. Resorption of the maxillary tuberosity might occur to accommodate molar eruption, but this is not definitively established.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The intermaxillary suture does not close immediately after birth.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The intermaxillary suture closes later, around puberty (12-14 years), not at 8 years.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The maxillary sinus increases in size postnatally, not decreases.  
- **Option G**: Plausible but uncertain. While the maxillary sinus expands, it is unclear if this directly creates space for molar eruption.  
- **Option H**: Correct. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to the increase in height and length of the maxilla as the zygomatic bone grows.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. This is the opposite of H, which is correct.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The maxilla does grow postnatally.  

After careful consideration, **Option H** is the most accurate and confident choice. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures play a key role in the growth of the maxilla, allowing it to increase in height and length.
