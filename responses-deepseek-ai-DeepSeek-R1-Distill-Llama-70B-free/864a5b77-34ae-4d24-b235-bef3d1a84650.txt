Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about convex mirrors and magnification. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what I remember from my classes.

The problem says: An object of height 5 cm is placed 10 cm in front of a convex mirror with a radius of curvature of 45.0 cm. I need to find the magnification of the image.

Wait, I remember that magnification relates to the size of the image compared to the object. Oh right, magnification (m) is the image height divided by the object height. So m = h'/h. But I think there's another way using the image distance and object distance. Oh yeah, m = - (image distance) / (object distance). That's the formula I remember.

So first, I need to find the image distance. For that, I should use the mirror equation, which is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.

Wait, wait. The mirror is convex. What does that mean for the focal length? Oh right, for convex mirrors, the focal length is negative because the focus is behind the mirror. The radius of curvature R is twice the focal length. So R = 2f. Oh yeah, so f = R/2. But since it's convex, f is negative.

Given R is 45.0 cm, so f = 45 / 2 = 22.5 cm. But since it's convex, f = -22.5 cm.

The object is placed 10 cm in front, so do = 10 cm.

Plugging into the mirror equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Let me write that out numerically.

1/(-22.5) = 1/10 + 1/di.

Wait, let's compute the left side first. 1/(-22.5) is approximately -0.044444.

On the right side, 1/10 is 0.1. So:

-0.044444 = 0.1 + (1/di).

Wait, that can't be right because if I rearrange that, 1/di would be negative, which would give a negative di. But that doesn't make sense because for convex mirrors, I think the image is always behind the mirror, so di should be negative. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the mirror equation, for convex mirrors, di is negative because it's a virtual image. So maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, let's correct this. Let me write the equation again.

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So 1/di = 1/f - 1/do.

Wait, no, let me rearrange the equation correctly.

1/di = 1/f - 1/do.

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step.

Starting with 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So, rearranged, 1/di = 1/f - 1/do.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do). Because I'm moving 1/do to the other side as subtracting.

So plugging in the values:

1/di = (1/(-22.5)) - (1/10).

Calculating each term: 1/(-22.5) is about -0.044444, and 1/10 is 0.1.

So 1/di = (-0.044444) - 0.1 = -0.144444 approximately.

So 1/di ≈ -0.144444. Therefore, di is 1 / (-0.144444) ≈ -6.923 cm.

Wait, that makes sense because the image is behind the mirror, so di is negative, which aligns with convex mirror properties.

Now, I need to find the magnification. Magnification m is equal to - di/do.

So m = - (di) / do.

Plugging in the values: di is approximately -6.923 cm, do is 10 cm.

So m = - (-6.923) / 10 = 6.923 / 10 ≈ 0.6923.

Wait, but wait, the object height is 5 cm, so the image height would be m * h. But the question is just asking for the magnification, which is m.

So m is approximately 0.6923, which is about 0.69. Now looking at the options, the closest one is E: 0.5, but wait, I'm not seeing an option for 0.69. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: 0.8

B:1.5

C:3.0

D:1.8

E:0.5

F:-1.8

G:2.0

H:1.0

I:1.2

J:2.5

Hmm, none of these exactly match 0.69. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers instead of approximating.

Let me redo the calculations with exact fractions.

Given R = 45 cm, so f = -45/2 = -22.5 cm.

Object distance do = 10 cm.

Mirror equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So 1/di = 1/f - 1/do.

Wait, no, wait, correct way:

1/di = 1/f - 1/do?

No, the correct rearrangement is:

1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) ?

Wait no, the equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So solving for 1/di: 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do).

Wait, but in terms of signs, let me compute it correctly.

Compute 1/f as 1/(-22.5) = -2/45 ≈ -0.044444.

Compute 1/do as 1/10 = 0.1.

So 1/di = (-2/45) - (1/10).

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the equation is 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do). Wait no, no. The correct equation after rearrangement is 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) ?

Wait, no, no. Let me start again.

The mirror equation is:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

I can rearrange this to solve for 1/di:

1/di = (1/f) - (1/do).

Wait, no, that's not correct algebraically. Let me see:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So subtract 1/do from both sides:

1/f - 1/do = 1/di.

So 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do).

Wait, no, that's not correct because subtracting 1/do from 1/f. Wait, that can't be right because the mirror equation would then have the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me write it as:

1/di = (1/f) - (1/do).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

If 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, then 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do).

No, that's correct.

So 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) = (1/(-22.5)) - (1/10).

So 1/di = (-1/22.5) - (1/10).

Let me compute this as fractions.

Convert to common denominator. Let's see, 22.5 is 45/2, so 1/22.5 is 2/45. 1/10 is 4.5/45.

So 1/di = (-2/45) - (4.5/45) = (-6.5/45) = -13/90.

So 1/di = -13/90.

Therefore, di = -90/13 cm. Let me compute that: 90 ÷ 13 is approximately 6.923 cm. So di ≈ -6.923 cm.

Now, the magnification m is given by m = - di/do.

So substituting values: m = - (-6.923) / 10 = 6.923 / 10 ≈ 0.6923.

Wait, but none of the options are around 0.69. Let me check the options again.

Options E is 0.5, which is 0.5, and option A is 0.8. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximating.

Let me compute 90/13 exactly.

13 × 6 = 78, 90-78=12, so 6 and 12/13, which is approximately 6.92307692 cm. So di is -6.92307692 cm.

So m = - (di/do) = - ( -6.92307692 / 10 ) = 6.92307692 / 10 ≈ 0.692307692.

Which is approximately 0.6923, so about 0.69.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:0.5 or A:0.8. Hmm, but none match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I got the formula for magnification wrong. Let me double-check. Magnification m is given by m = h'/h = - di/do.

Wait, so m = - (di/do). So di is negative, so m would be positive.

Wait, di is -6.923, so m = - ( (-6.923)/10 ) = 6.923/10 ≈ 0.6923.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mirror equation. Let me check the mirror equation again.

Mirror equation for any mirror is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Yes, correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the formula m = (f)/(f - do). Wait no, that's not correct. The formula m = -di/do is correct.

Alternatively, another approach: using the magnification formula m = (h')/h = - di/do.

But perhaps I should compute using exact fractions.

So di = -90/13 cm.

So m = - di/do = - ( (-90/13) ) / 10 = (90/13) / 10 = 90/(13*10) = 9/(13) ≈ 0.6923.

So 9/13 is approximately 0.6923. So the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/di.

Wait, let me recalculate 1/di.

1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) ?

Wait, no, the correct rearrangement is 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) ?

Wait, no, no, because 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally because 1/f would be in 1/cm, 1/do also in 1/cm, so their difference would be 1/cm, so 1/di would be in 1/cm. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used 1/di = (1/f) + (1/do) ? No, no, that's the original equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when plugging in the values.

Wait, let's try it again.

f = -22.5 cm.

do = 10 cm.

So 1/f = -1/22.5 = -2/45.

1/do = 1/10.

So 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) ?

Wait, no, wait, 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) is that correct?

Wait, no, because 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So solving for 1/di gives 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do).

Yes, that's correct.

So 1/di = (-2/45) - (1/10).

Let me compute that.

Convert to 45 denominator.

-2/45 = -2/45.

1/10 = 4.5/45.

So 1/di = (-2 - 4.5)/45 = (-6.5)/45.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 1/di would be negative, which would make di negative, which is correct.

Wait, wait, 1/di is (-6.5)/45, which is the same as -13/90.

So di is 90/(-13) = -6.923 cm.

So same as before.

So m = - (di)/do = - (-6.923)/10 = 0.6923.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Did I make a mistake in the problem statement? Let me read it again.

Wait, the problem says the object is placed 10 cm in front of a convex mirror, radius of curvature 45 cm. So R =45 cm, so f=-22.5 cm. Object distance is 10 cm.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to compute m using the formula m = (f) / (do - f).

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute using di and then find m.

Wait, another approach: using the formula m = (di)/(do) * (h'/h), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the magnification formula. I thought it was m = - di/do. Let me confirm.

Yes, in optics, the magnification is given by m = - (di/do).

So with di being negative, the negative cancels, giving a positive m.

Wait, but according to my calculation, m is about 0.69. The options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I confused convex and concave mirrors. Wait, for a convex mirror, the image is always virtual, erect, and smaller. So the magnification should be between 0 and 1.

The options E is 0.5, and A is 0.8. So 0.69 is between them.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute 1/di again.

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

So 1/di = 1/f - 1/do.

Wait, wait, no, no. Let's write the equation correctly.

1/di = (1/f) - (1/do).

Wait, that's correct.

So 1/di = (1/(-22.5)) - (1/10) = (-1/22.5) - (1/10).

Compute each term as fractions:

1/22.5 = 2/45.

So 1/22.5 = 2/45, so 1/di = (-2/45) - (1/10).

Convert 1/10 to 45 denominator: 1/10 = 4.5/45.

So 1/di = (-2 - 4.5)/45 = (-6.5)/45.

Which is -13/90.

So di = -90/13 cm.

Wait, 90/13 is approximately 6.923, so di is -6.923 cm.

So m = - (di)/do = - (-6.923)/10 = 0.6923.

Hmm. So the options don't have 0.69, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem. Oh wait! Wait, the radius of curvature is 45 cm, so f = R/2 = 22.5 cm. But for a convex mirror, the focal length is negative, so f = -22.5 cm. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are rounded. Let me compute 9/13 exactly. 13 × 0.7 = 9.1, so 9/13 is approximately 0.6923, so about 0.69.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.5 and option A is 0.8. Neither is close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should use another formula for magnification. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula involving the object distance and focal length.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for magnification in terms of object distance and focal length.

m = (f) / (do - f).

Wait, let me check this formula. I think it's for the case when the object is beyond the focal point. Wait, but for convex mirrors, the focal length is negative.

Wait, let me think. The formula for magnification can also be expressed as m = (f) / (f - do).

Wait, let me see: from m = - di/do, and from the mirror equation, di = (f * do)/(do + f).

Wait, wait, alternative approach: Let's solve for di using the mirror equation.

Using 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Rearranged, 1/di = (1/f) - (1/do) = (do - f)/(f * do).

So di = (f * do) / (do - f).

So m = - di/do = - [ (f * do) / (do - f) ) ] / do = - [ f / (do - f) ].

So m = -f / (do - f).

Since f is negative, let's plug in the numbers.

f = -22.5 cm.

do = 10 cm.

So m = - (-22.5) / (10 - (-22.5)) = 22.5 / (32.5) = 22.5 / 32.5.

Compute that: 22.5 ÷ 32.5.

Well, 32.5 × 0.7 = 22.75, which is just above 22.5, so 0.69 approximately.

Wait, 32.5 × 0.69 = 22.425. So 22.5 / 32.5 ≈ 0.6923.

Same result as before. So m ≈ 0.6923.

Hmm, I'm consistently getting approximately 0.69, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:0.8, E:0.5. Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer
