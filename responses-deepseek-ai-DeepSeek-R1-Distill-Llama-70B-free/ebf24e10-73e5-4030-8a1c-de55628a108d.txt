Alright, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking me to translate the statement "No artifacts are people" into predicate logic and choose the correct option from the given choices.

First, let's break down the English statement. "No artifacts are people" means that there is no overlap between the set of artifacts and the set of people. In other words, if something is an artifact, it cannot be a person, and vice versa. So, I'm thinking this is a universal statement because it's making a claim about all artifacts and all people.

In predicate logic, I know that statements like "All A are B" can be written as ∀x (A(x) → B(x)). But here, the statement is negative: "No A are B," which logically means "All A are not B." So, "No artifacts are people" should translate to "For all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person."

Let me represent this with predicates. Let's say A(x) stands for "x is an artifact" and P(x) stands for "x is a person." So the statement would be ∀x (A(x) → ¬P(x)). Alternatively, this can also be written as ∀x (¬A(x) ∨ ¬P(x)), but I think the first form is more straightforward.

Now, looking at the options provided:

Option A: (∀x)(~Ax ⊃ Px) – This reads as "For all x, if x is not an artifact, then x is a person." That doesn't seem right because our original statement is about artifacts not being people, not about non-artifacts being people.

Option B: (∀x)(Px ⊃ ~Ax) – This means "For all x, if x is a person, then x is not an artifact." Hmm, that's actually equivalent to the original statement because if no artifacts are people, then any person cannot be an artifact. So this seems correct, but let me check the others.

Option C: (∀x)(~Ax • Px) – This is "For all x, x is not an artifact and x is a person." That would mean everything is a person but not an artifact, which is not what the original statement says. So C is incorrect.

Option D: ~Aa – This seems to be a single statement about a specific individual a not being an artifact. The original statement is general, not about a specific individual, so D is out.

Option E: (∀x)(Px ⊃ Ax) – This means "For all x, if x is a person, then x is an artifact." That's the opposite of what we want. We want "if x is an artifact, then x is not a person," so E is incorrect.

Option F: (∀x)(Ax ⊃ ~Px) – Ah, this is exactly the form I thought earlier. "For all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person." This directly matches the original statement. So F seems correct.

Option G: ~Pa – Similar to D, this is a specific statement about a not being a person. Doesn't fit the general statement, so G is wrong.

Option H: (∀x)(Px • Ax) – This would mean "For all x, x is a person and x is an artifact," which is saying everything is both, which contradicts our original statement. So H is wrong.

Option I: ~Ap – This is saying "p is not an artifact," which again is a specific case, not the general rule. So I is incorrect.

Option J: (∀x)(Ax • ~Px) – This translates to "For all x, x is an artifact and x is not a person." Wait, that's not quite right because it's saying every artifact is not a person, which is correct, but the way it's structured with the conjunction might not capture the universal correctly. Actually, no, because using the conjunction inside the universal would mean that for every x, if x is an artifact, then it's not a person. Wait, no, that's not how it's structured. The option J is (∀x)(Ax • ~Px), which is "For all x, x is an artifact and x is not a person." That would mean every x is both an artifact and not a person, which is not correct because not every x is an artifact. So J is incorrect.

Wait, I might have confused myself with option J. Let me think again. The correct logical form is ∀x (Ax → ¬Px), which is equivalent to ∀x (¬Ax ∨ ¬Px). Option F is ∀x (Ax → ¬Px), which is correct. Option B is ∀x (Px → ¬Ax), which is also correct because it's the contrapositive of F. So both B and F are logically equivalent.

Wait a second, I thought the answer was F, but B is also correct. Did I make a mistake earlier? Let me think again. The original statement is "No artifacts are people," which can be phrased as "All artifacts are non-people," which is ∀x (Ax → ¬Px), which is option F. Alternatively, it can also be phrased as "All people are non-artifacts," which is ∀x (Px → ¬Ax), which is option B. Both are correct because they are contrapositives of each other. So which one is the best translation?

I think both B and F are correct, but I need to check the options again. Wait, the options are A to J, and I need to pick the best one. So perhaps both B and F are correct, but let me double-check.

Wait, looking back, the original statement is "No artifacts are people." So the direct translation is that if something is an artifact, it's not a person. So that's F. Alternatively, if something is a person, it's not an artifact, which is B. Both are correct, but perhaps the question expects the direct form, which would be F.

Alternatively, sometimes in logic, the contrapositive is considered equivalent, so both B and F are correct. But looking at the options, both B and F are present. Wait, no, the options are given as A to J, and each option is a separate choice. So perhaps I need to pick the best one.

Wait, but the original statement is about artifacts not being people, so the direct form is F. So I think F is the correct answer.

The statement "No artifacts are people" can be translated into predicate logic as "For all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person." This is represented as ∀x (Ax → ¬Px), where A(x) stands for "x is an artifact" and P(x) stands for "x is a person." 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: (∀x)(~Ax ⊃ Px) means "For all x, if x is not an artifact, then x is a person," which is incorrect because it does not align with the original statement.
- **Option B**: (∀x)(Px ⊃ ~Ax) means "For all x, if x is a person, then x is not an artifact." This is the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.
- **Option C**: (∀x)(~Ax • Px) means "For all x, x is not an artifact and x is a person," which is incorrect because it suggests that everything is a person but not an artifact.
- **Option D**: ~Aa refers to a specific individual "a" not being an artifact, which is too narrow for the general statement.
- **Option E**: (∀x)(Px ⊃ Ax) means "For all x, if x is a person, then x is an artifact," which is the opposite of the original statement.
- **Option F**: (∀x)(Ax ⊃ ~Px) means "For all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person," which directly matches the original statement.
- **Option G**: ~Pa refers to a specific individual "a" not being a person, which is too narrow for the general statement.
- **Option H**: (∀x)(Px • Ax) means "For all x, x is a person and x is an artifact," which contradicts the original statement.
- **Option I**: ~Ap refers to a specific individual "p" not being an artifact, which is too narrow for the general statement.
- **Option J**: (∀x)(Ax • ~Px) means "For all x, x is an artifact and x is not a person," which is incorrect because it implies that every x is an artifact.

Both options B and F are correct, as they are logically equivalent (contrapositives of each other). However, the most direct translation of "No artifacts are people" is option F: (∀x)(Ax ⊃ ~Px).

Answer: F
