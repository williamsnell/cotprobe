Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. The question is about an unknown substance's properties, and I need to determine the type of bonding it likely contains.

The properties given are: high melting point, poor conductor of electricity, and doesn't dissolve in water. Hmm, I remember that different types of chemical bonds result in different physical properties. So I need to think about each of these properties and what they imply about the substance's structure.

First, a high melting point suggests that the substance has strong bonds because it takes more energy to break them. So which types of bonding are associated with high melting points? Well, I remember that ionic compounds have high melting points because the ionic bonds are very strong. Similarly, covalent network solids like diamond or quartz also have very high melting points because the entire structure is a network of strong covalent bonds. Metals typically have high melting points too, but they're good conductors, so that might be a clue.

Next, the substance is a poor conductor of electricity. Metals are good conductors because their electrons are free to move. Ionic compounds conduct when they're dissolved in water or melted because the ions can move, but in solid form, they don't conduct. So if the substance is solid and doesn't conduct, that might point towards either ionic or covalent network, but wait, no, because I think ionic solids in solid state don't conduct. Oh, but the question doesn't specify the state, but it says the substance doesn't dissolve in water, which I'll get to next.

The third property is that it doesn't dissolve in water. Ionic compounds usually dissolve in water because water is a polar solvent and can break the ionic lattice. So if the substance doesn't dissolve, that might mean it's not ionic. Wait, but some ionic compounds don't dissolve, especially if they have a high lattice energy. Alternatively, covalent network solids are generally insoluble in water because the covalent bonds are too strong, and water can't break them. For example, diamond doesn't dissolve in water.

Putting it together: high melting point suggests strong bonds (ionic or covalent network), poor conductor suggests not metallic or ionic (since ionic would conduct when molten or in solution, but not as a solid. Wait, the question says it's a poor conductor, so as a solid, ionic wouldn't conduct, but in this case, the substance's properties don't specify the state when measuring conductivity. But the question is about the substance's inherent properties. So maybe the fact that it doesn't conduct and is a solid suggests it's not metallic or ionic. Because metals conduct, and ionic compounds conduct when in solution or melted.

Wait, the question says it's a poor conductor of electricity, which probably refers to its solid state. So if it's a solid and doesn't conduct, that rules out metals. So then what's left? High melting point but doesn't conduct as a solid. That makes me think of something like a covalent network solid. Because metals conduct, ionic solids don't conduct as solids, but they do when in solution. But in this question, the substance doesn't dissolve, so it can't be ionic because ionic usually dissolves, right? Unless it's something with a very high lattice energy.

Wait, but some ionic compounds don't dissolve, like silver chloride. So maybe I can't rule out ionic just based on solubility. But then, if the substance has a high melting point and is an ionic solid, when it's in solid form, it wouldn't conduct. But if it's ionic, when it's melted, it would conduct. The question doesn't specify the state when measuring conductivity, but the fact that it's a poor conductor suggests it's not metallic.

So the options for bonding would be either ionic or covalent network. But another point is that ionic compounds are typically hard and have high melting points. Covalent network solids, like diamond or quartz, also have high melting points and are hard.

But let me think about examples. For instance, diamond is a covalent network solid. It has an extremely high melting point, doesn't conduct electricity (since there's no free electrons), and doesn't dissolve in water. So that fits all the properties given.

Alternatively, quartz (SiO2) is another example. High melting point, doesn't conduct electricity, and doesn't dissolve in water.

On the other hand, an ionic compound like NaCl (sodium chloride) has a high melting point, doesn't conduct as a solid, but it does dissolve in water. So the fact that the substance doesn't dissolve in water would make me think it's not ionic, because many ionic compounds are soluble. But some aren't, as I thought earlier, like silver chloride, which is insoluble. So maybe the answer could still be ionic.

Wait, but the question is about what the substance "most likely contains." So which is more common? Covalent network solids are less common than ionic solids, but when considering all properties, perhaps the key is the combination.

So the substance has high melting point, poor conductivity, and doesn't dissolve. If it were ionic, but insoluble, then it would fit, but I think covalent network is a better fit because they generally don't dissolve in water. Ionic compounds that are insoluble are exceptions, but perhaps the question is pointing towards covalent network.

So the bonding type for covalent network is option C: covalent network bonding. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is "covalent network bonding." So that's the choice I'm thinking.

The question involves determining the type of bonding in an unknown substance based on its properties: high melting point, poor conductivity, and insolubility in water. Here's the analysis:

1. **High Melting Point**: This suggests the presence of strong bonds. Ionic compounds and covalent network solids are known for their high melting points due to the strength of their bonding.

2. **Poor Conductor of Electricity**: Metals are good conductors, so this rules out metallic bonding. Ionic compounds conduct electricity only when dissolved or molten, but as solids, they do not conduct. Covalent network solids also do not conduct electricity because they lack free-moving electrons.

3. **Does Not Dissolve in Water**: Ionic compounds often dissolve in water because water can break the ionic lattice. However, some ionic compounds, like silver chloride, are exceptions and do not dissolve. Covalent network solids, such as diamond or quartz, are generally insoluble in water due to the strength of their covalent bonds.

Given these properties, the substance is most likely a covalent network solid. While ionic compounds can sometimes be insoluble, the combination of high melting point, poor conductivity, and insolubility in water aligns most closely with covalent network bonding.
