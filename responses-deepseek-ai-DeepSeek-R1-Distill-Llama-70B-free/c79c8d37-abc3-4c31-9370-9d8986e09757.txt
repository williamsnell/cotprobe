Question:

Two men agreed to burglarize a home. While they were planning the burglary, the two men learned that the home had a sophisticated alarm system that needed to be disarmed. One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?

Options:

A: The two men are not guilty of any crime, and the alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary.
B: The two men are guilty of attempted burglary, but not conspiracy. The alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.
C: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.
D: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.
E: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.
F: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary, but not conspiracy.
G: The two men are not guilty of any crime because they didn't commit the burglary. The alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy.
H: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but the alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.
I: The alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy, but the two men are not guilty of any crime because they didn't commit the burglary.
J: The two men are guilty of conspiracy.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal liability in a burglary scenario. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal law, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. So, there are two men who agree to burglarize a home. They realize the house has a sophisticated alarm system. One of them knows an alarm specialist and approaches him for help. The specialist refuses to participate but tells them how to disarm the system themselves. Then, the two men go to the house but find a guard dog, so they abandon the plan.

The question is about the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist. The options are from A to J, each giving different scenarios.

I think I need to analyze the possible crimes each person might have committed. The two main crimes here could be conspiracy and attempted burglary, maybe.

Let's start with the two men. They agreed to commit a burglary, so that sounds like a conspiracy. Conspiracy generally requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and in some jurisdictions, an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. Here, they approached the specialist, which might count as the overt act. So they probably formed a conspiracy.

Next, did they attempt burglary? They went to the house with the intent to commit burglary but were deterred by the dog. Attempted crimes require specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards its commission. They planned, got the info on disarming, and went to the location. But then they didn't enter because of the dog. So did they take a substantial step? I think arriving with intent might be enough for attempt, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe they didn't complete the attempt because they didn't try to enter after knowing about the dog.

Wait, in some jurisdictions, attempted burglary requires taking a substantial step toward entering the building with intent. If they showed up but didn't try to enter because of the dog, maybe they didn't take that step. Or does the act of going to the location with intent count as attempt? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe they are guilty of conspiracy but not attempt. Or perhaps they are guilty of both.

Now, what about the alarm specialist? He refused to participate but gave them instructions on how to disarm the system. Did he aid and abet in the crime? Or is he an accomplice? Or is he not liable at all?

Aiding and abetting requires that the person knowingly assisted in the commission of the crime with the intent to help. Here, he gave information, but he didn't want to participate. But does providing information with the knowledge that it would be used for a crime make him an accomplice? Or is it just that he didn't participate actively enough?

In some cases, merely providing information isn't enough for aiding and abetting unless it's done with the intent to facilitate the crime. So if he gave the info knowing they'd use it for burglary, maybe he's guilty as an accomplice. But wait, he told them how to do it themselves after refusing to help. Does that make him part of the conspiracy?

Alternatively, could he be guilty of conspiracy? Conspiracy requires an agreement. He refused to participate, so he didn't agree. He just provided information. So perhaps he's not part of the conspiracy but might be guilty of aiding and abetting if his help was substantial.

But wait, in the initial planning, the two men were already conspiring. The specialist wasn't part of that agreement. So he's probably not in on the conspiracy. But by providing information, he might have acted as an aider and abettor. But did he have the intent? Since he said he didn't want to participate, maybe he lacked the intent to aid them. So perhaps he's not guilty of anything.

Wait, but he knew they were going to commit a burglary and he gave them the means. In some jurisdictions, that could make him an accomplice, but I'm not sure. It's possible that he's not guilty because he didn't take an active role beyond providing information, especially since he refused to participate.

So putting it all together:

- The two men conspired to commit burglary. They agreed and took overt acts (approaching the specialist). So they are guilty of conspiracy.

- Did they attempt burglary? They went to the house but didn't enter due to the dog. So maybe they didn't complete the attempt. Attempt requires more than preparation; they need to take a substantial step toward the crime. Going to the location with intent could be enough, but if they were deterred without taking further action, perhaps they didn't complete the attempt. So maybe they're not guilty of attempted burglary.

Alternatively, some might argue that going to the location with intent is enough for attempt, but I'm not certain. I think in many jurisdictions, that's sufficient. So maybe they are guilty of both conspiracy and attempt.

Wait, but in the fact pattern, they went to the home, saw the dog, and then left. So they were on the way but didn't proceed. So maybe they took a step beyond preparation, which would make it an attempt.

If that's the case, then the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary.

What about the alarm specialist? Since he refused to participate but gave them information, is he liable? If he provided the information knowing it would be used for burglary, he might be guilty of aiding and abetting. But I'm not sure if that's the case. If he gave them the information but didn't agree to join, he might not be part of the conspiracy. So he's not guilty of conspiracy.

But could he be guilty as an accomplice to the attempted burglary? If he intentionally aided the commission of the crime, he could be guilty. But since he refused to participate, perhaps he didn't have the intent. Or maybe he did, because he provided the means.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Some sources say that a person who knowingly aids a felony can be guilty as an accomplice, even if they don't agree to the overall plan. So if the specialist knew they were going to use his info for burglary and provided it, he might be guilty as an aider and abettor.

But wait, the question is about their liability for conspiracy and attempted burglary. The alarm specialist wasn't part of the conspiracy because he didn't agree. So for conspiracy, he's not guilty. But for attempt, if he's an aider and abettor, he could be guilty of attempted burglary.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Conspiracy is about the agreement. He didn't agree, so he's not part of that. For attempt, he could be guilty if he intentionally helped them. But did he act with the intent to help? He told them how to disarm the system. If he intended to help them commit burglary, then yes. But he said he didn't want to participate. Maybe he didn't have the intent to aid, but just provided information for some other reason. Or maybe he knew it would be used for burglary, so he intended to help.

Alternatively, perhaps he's not guilty of anything because he didn't commit any act beyond giving advice, and he didn't agree to participate. So he's not an accomplice.

So putting it all together, the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary. The alarm specialist is not guilty of anything because he didn't agree to the conspiracy and didn't take any action beyond providing information, which may not be enough for aiding and abetting.

Looking at the options:

Option H says: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but the alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.

Wait, let me double-check the options. Let me read them again.

Option H: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but the alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.

Yes, that seems to fit. The two men conspired and attempted burglary. The specialist isn't guilty.

Wait, but could the specialist be guilty of aiding and abetting attempted burglary? If he is, then maybe the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, and the specialist is guilty of attempted burglary as an aider. But the options don't have that combination. Let me check.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Two men guilty of attempted burglary, not conspiracy. Specialist not guilty.

No, because the two men did conspire.

Option H: Two men guilty of conspiracy and attempt. Specialist not guilty.

That seems correct.

Option D: Two men guilty of conspiracy. All three guilty of attempt.

No, because the specialist didn't attempt.

Option C: All guilty of conspiracy and attempt.

No.

Option E: All guilty of conspiracy. No, specialist didn't agree.

So the correct answer should be H.
</think>

The two men agreed to commit a burglary, which constitutes conspiracy as they reached an agreement and took overt acts (approaching the alarm specialist) in furtherance of their plan. They also took substantial steps toward committing the burglary by going to the home with the intent to carry out the crime, satisfying the elements of attempted burglary. 

The alarm specialist, while providing information on how to disarm the alarm, did not agree to participate in the crime, so he is not part of the conspiracy. Additionally, his actions (providing information) do not constitute aiding and abetting, as he did not act with the intent to facilitate the crime. Therefore, the alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.

The correct answer is:

**H: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but the alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.**

H
