Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Dumas bulb problem. Hmm, I remember that the Dumas bulb is used for gas density and molar mass determinations. The principle probably involves gas laws here.

Alright, the setup is a 2-liter bulb containing n moles of nitrogen at 0.5 atm and temperature T K. Then, 0.01 moles of oxygen are added. After that, to maintain the same pressure, they cool it to 10°C, which is 283 K.

Wait, so initially, the bulb has only nitrogen. Then oxygen is added, but the pressure stays the same because they change the temperature. So the pressure after adding O2 at the lower temperature equals the initial pressure.

I think I should use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, for both situations.

First, initial state: P1 = 0.5 atm, V is 2 L, n is n, T is T K.

So equation 1: 0.5 * 2 = n * R * T.

After adding O2, the moles become n + 0.01. But the pressure remains the same? Or does the pressure change and they adjust the temperature to make it the same as before? Wait, the question says it's necessary to cool to maintain the same pressure. So initial pressure was 0.5 atm. After adding O2, they cool it so that the pressure remains 0.5 atm. So pressure remains the same, but temperature changes.

So equation 2: P2 = P1 = 0.5 atm. Volume is still 2 L. Moles are n + 0.01. Temperature is 283 K.

So equation 2: 0.5 * 2 = (n + 0.01) * R * 283.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because when we add oxygen, the moles increase, which would tend to increase pressure unless we change the temperature. So by cooling, we reduce the pressure back to 0.5 atm.

So from equation 1: 0.5 * 2 = n R T → equation 1: n R T = 1.

Equation 2: 0.5 * 2 = (n +0.01) R * 283 → (n +0.01) R * 283 = 1.

Wait, because both equal to 1 on the left side. So set them equal:

n R T = (n + 0.01) R * 283.

Oh, R cancels out. So n T = (n + 0.01) * 283.

Wait, but I can write equation 1 as n T = 1/(R) * (0.5 * 2) → n T = (1) / R. Wait, perhaps better to find the ratio.

Wait, from equation 1: n T = (1) / R.

Wait, equation 1 is 0.5 atm * 2 L = n R T → 1 = n R T → n = 1/(R T).

Equation 2: 0.5 * 2 = (n + 0.01) R * 283 → 1 = (n + 0.01) R * 283 → (n +0.01) =1/(R *283).

So from equation 1, n = 1/(R T).

From equation 2, n +0.01 = 1/(R *283).

Substitute n from equation 1 into equation 2:

(1/(R T)) + 0.01 = 1/(R *283).

Multiply both sides by R to eliminate it:

(1/T) + 0.01 R = 1/283.

Wait, that's a bit complicated because R is in there. Maybe I'm making this more complicated.

Wait another approach: since both situations have the same P and V, perhaps we can write the ratio of moles times temperature as equal.

Wait, from ideal gas law, since PV = nRT, if P and V are same, then n1 T1 = n2 T2.

Wait, initial state: n1 = n, T1 = T.

After adding O2: n2 = n +0.01, T2 = 283 K.

So n * T = (n +0.01) * 283.

That's the same equation as before.

So n T = (n +0.01) * 283.

Let me rearrange this equation.

n T = 283 n + 283 * 0.01 → n T = 283 n + 2.83.

Bring all terms to one side: n T -283 n = 2.83 → n (T -283) = 2.83.

So n = 2.83 / (T -283).

But we also have from equation 1: n = 1/(R T).

So substituting n into the equation:

1/(R T) = 2.83 / (T -283).

Multiply both sides by R T (T -283):

(T -283) = 2.83 R T.

Hmm, let's plug in R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So,

T -283 = 2.83 * 0.0821 * T.

Calculate 2.83 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.2325.

So,

T -283 ≈ 0.2325 T → T -0.2325 T ≈ 283 → 0.7675 T ≈ 283 → T ≈ 283 / 0.7675 ≈ 368.5 K.

Wait, but looking at the options, the option B is n=0.0332, T=367K; option G has T=283, which can't be because initial T is higher before cooling.

Wait, so I have T ≈ 368.5 K. Let me calculate more accurately.

2.83 * R = 2.83 * 0.082057 (exact value of R in L·atm/(mol·K)) → 2.83 * 0.082057 = let's compute:

2 * 0.082057 = 0.164114.

0.8 * 0.082057 ≈ 0.065625.

0.03 * 0.082057 ≈ 0.0024617.

Adding: 0.164114 + 0.065625 = 0.229739 + 0.0024617 ≈ 0.2322007.

So 2.83 R ≈ 0.23220.

So T -283 = 0.23220 T → T (1 - 0.23220) = 283 → T (0.7678) = 283 → T = 283 / 0.7678 ≈ 283 / 0.7678.

Compute 283 divided by 0.7678.

Let me compute 0.7678 ≈ 0.767 ≈ 283 / 0.767.

Calculate 283 ÷ 0.767.

Let me do it step by step.

767 × 368 = ?

Well, 0.767 * 368 = ?

Wait, 0.767 * 368.

Wait 0.7 * 368 = 257.6, 0.06 *368=22.08, 0.007*368=2.576.

Sum: 257.6 +22.08=279.68 +2.576=282.256.

Close to 283. So 0.767 * 368 ≈ 282.256, which is about 283. So 368 would be approximate.

But 0.7678 * 368 → 0.7678 *368 = let's compute:

368 * 0.7 = 257.6

368 * 0.06 = 22.08 → 257.6 +22.08 = 279.68

368 * 0.0078 = 2.8684 → total 279.68 +2.8684 = 282.5484.

But we have 283 on the left. So 368 K gives 0.7678 *368= ~282.55, which is less than 283.

So 0.7678 * T =283 → T=283 /0.7678 ≈ 368.5 K.

Hmm, but let's compute this accurately.

Compute 283 / 0.7678.

Let me compute 0.7678 × 368.5 → 368 * 0.7678 + 0.5 * 0.7678.

We know 368 gives 282.5484 as above.

0.5 * 0.7678=0.3839 → total 282.5484 +0.3839=282.9323.

Still a little less than 283.

So, 368.5 gives about 282.93, so perhaps T is about 368.6.

Wait, 0.7678 * 368.6 → 368 *0.7678 =282.5484, plus 0.6 *0.7678=0.46068 → total 282.5484 +0.46068=283.009.

So 368.6 K gives 0.7678 * T ≈283. So T≈368.6 K.

Looking at the options, option B says T=367K, option G has T=283 (no, that's the new temp), option C is 330, so not close.

So T is approximately 368.6 K, which rounds to about 369 K. But the options have 367 K as option B and 330 as option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should solve for T more accurately.

The equation after substitution is:

n = 1/(R T) → n = 1/(0.0821 * T).

And from the other equation, n = 2.83/(T -283).

So setting them equal: 1/(0.0821 T) = 2.83/(T-283).

Cross multiply:

(T -283) = 2.83 * 0.0821 T → T -283 = (2.83 * 0.0821) T → calculate 2.83 * 0.0821.

2.83 * 0.08 = 0.2264, 2.83 *0.0021=0.005943 → total 0.232343.

So:

T -283 =0.232343 T → T -0.232343 T =283 → (1-0.232343) T=283 → 0.767657 T=283 → T=283 /0.767657 ≈ 368.6 K.

So about 368.6 K. The closest option is B:367 K, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option B is n=0.0332, T=367.

Option G has T=283, which is the new temp, not initial.

Wait, perhaps I should compute n.

n = 1/(R T) → T=368.6, R=0.0821 → n=1/(0.0821 * 368.6).

Compute denominator: 0.0821 *368.6 ≈ Let's compute 0.08 *368.6=29.488, 0.0021 *368.6≈0.775, so total ~30.263.

So n≈1/30.263≈0.03306 mol. So approximately 0.0331.

Looking at option B, n=0.0332, T=367K.

Which is very close to our calculation. Probably due to rounding, as 368.6 is closer to 369, but option B is 367, perhaps due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation with more precise numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the pressure isn't remaining the same after adding O2. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial state: n, T, 0.5 atm.

After adding O2, the moles are (n +0.01), and the temperature is 283 K, and pressure is still 0.5 atm.

So the ideal gas law applies to both states, so:

n R T = (n +0.01) R (283).

Cancel R: n T = (n +0.01) 283.

So n T =283 n + 2.83 → n (T -283) =2.83 → n=2.83/(T-283).

And from the initial state, n = (P V)/(R T) → (0.5 *2)/(R T) → 1/(R T).

So, 1/(R T) = 2.83/(T-283).

Multiply both sides by R T (T-283):

(T -283) = 2.83 R T.

Wait, that's the same equation as before.

So, T -283 = 2.83 * R T.

So, T (1 -2.83 R) = 283.

Compute 2.83 * R: 2.83 *0.082057 ≈ 0.2322 L·atm/(mol·K) as before.

So 1 -0.2322 =0.7678.

So T=283 /0.7678 ≈368.6 K.

So T is approximately 368.6 K, n=1/(R*T)=1/(0.082057 *368.6).

Compute denominator:

0.082057 *368.6 = Let's compute 368 *0.082057.

368 *0.08 =29.44

368 *0.002057 ≈368 *0.002=0.736, 368 *0.000057≈0.021 → 0.736 +0.021=0.757.

So total 29.44 +0.757=30.197.

So 0.082057 *368.6 ≈30.197.

So n=1/30.197≈0.03312 ≈0.0331 moles.

So n≈0.0331, T≈368.6 K.

Looking at the options, option B is n=0.0332, T=367 K. That's very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Maybe the bulb's volume is constant, but perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, another approach: Let's plug in the options to see which fits.

Take option B: n=0.0332, T=367 K.

Compute initial pressure: n R T / V = (0.0332)(0.0821)(367)/(2) → let me compute.

0.0332 *0.0821=0.00272472.

0.00272472 *367 ≈ 1.000 (0.00272472 *367 = let's compute: 0.0027 *367=1.00 approximately. So 0.00272472 *367 ≈1.000).

So 1.000 /2 =0.5 atm. Correct.

After adding O2: moles =0.0332 +0.01=0.0432. T=283 K.

Compute pressure: (0.0432)(0.0821)(283)/2.

Compute numerator: 0.0432 *0.0821 ≈0.00354592.

0.00354592 *283 ≈ let's compute: 0.0035 *283=0.98905; 0.00004592*283≈0.013.

Total ≈0.98905 +0.013=1.002.

Divide by 2: 1.002/2=0.501 atm. Which is approximately 0.5, so it fits.

Wait, but the pressure remains the same as before, 0.5 atm. So if the calculation gives 0.501, which is close enough, option B is correct.

Alternatively, let's check option G: n=0.0332, T=283 K.

Wait, initial state with T=283? But after adding O2, they cool to 283, which would be same as initial temp. That can't be, because adding moles would increase pressure unless temp is lowered.

So option G's initial T is 283, which would require cooling after adding O2 to the same temp, which doesn't make sense. So option G isn't correct.

Alternatively, option C: n=0.0332, T=330 K.

Compute initial pressure: (0.0332)(0.0821)(330)/2.

0.0332 *0.0821=0.00272472.

0.00272472 *330=0.900 → 0.900 /2=0.45 atm, which is lower than 0.5. So initial pressure would be 0.45, which doesn't match. So option C isn't correct.

So option B seems correct.

To solve the problem, we use the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), under two conditions:

1. **Initial state**: The bulb contains \( n \) moles of nitrogen at \( 0.5 \, \text{atm} \) and temperature \( T \, \text{K} \). The equation is:
   \[
   0.5 \cdot 2 = nRT \implies nRT = 1 \implies n = \frac{1}{RT}.
   \]

2. **After adding oxygen**: The bulb contains \( n + 0.01 \) moles of gas (nitrogen + oxygen) at the same pressure \( 0.5 \, \text{atm} \) but at a reduced temperature of \( 283 \, \text{K} \). The equation is:
   \[
   0.5 \cdot 2 = (n + 0.01)R \cdot 283 \implies (n + 0.01)R \cdot 283 = 1 \implies n + 0.01 = \frac{1}{R \cdot 283}.
   \]

Equating the two expressions for \( n \) from the above equations:
\[
\frac{1}{RT} = \frac{1}{R \cdot 283} + 0.01.
\]

Substituting \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), we solve for \( T \):
\[
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{283} + 0.01 \cdot R.
\]

First, calculate \( 0.01 \cdot R = 0.01 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.000821 \). Then:
\[
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{283} + 0.000821 \implies \frac{1}{T} = 0.003534 + 0.000821
