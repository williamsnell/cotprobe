Question:

A suspected drug dealer was arrested after selling three grams of cocaine to undercover police agents. He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of

Options:

A: both indictments.
B: the federal indictment, if the state indictment is dismissed.
C: both indictments, if the appeal is successful.
D: the state indictment, if the federal court conviction is upheld.
E: neither of the indictments.
F: the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.
G: the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.
H: the federal indictment, if the state court conviction is upheld.
I: both indictments, if the appeal is unsuccessful.
J: the state indictment, if the federal indictment is dismissed.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about double jeopardy, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the scenario step by step.

The situation is about a drug dealer who was arrested and convicted in state court for possession with intent to distribute narcotics. He sold three grams of cocaine to undercover police. After his conviction, he was sentenced to 10 years. Now, his attorney is appealing the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While the appeal is pending, he's been indicted by both federal and state grand juries for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. His attorney is moving to dismiss these indictments based on double jeopardy.

I remember that double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But I also recall that there are exceptions, especially regarding state and federal prosecutions. The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to the federal government and the states, but under the dual sovereignty doctrine, separate sovereigns can each prosecute for the same conduct without violating double jeopardy.

So, in this case, the initial prosecution was in state court. After that, both the state and federal governments are indicting him again. Wait, but wait—the state indicted him again? Or is it a different charge?

Wait, the first conviction was for possession with intent to distribute, and now he's being indicted for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. Are these the same offense? Or different?

Possession with intent and conspiracy are different offenses, but they might be based on the same conduct. But in terms of double jeopardy, the question is whether they are the same offense. The Blockburger test says that if each offense requires proof of a different fact, then they are not the same offense, and double jeopardy doesn't apply.

Possession with intent requires having the drug with the intention to distribute it. Conspiracy requires an agreement to distribute. So under Blockburger, these are separate offenses because each requires proof of different facts. So, can the state prosecute him again for conspiracy after convicting him for possession with intent? Hmm, but wait, the initial case is on appeal, so the conviction isn't final yet. Does double jeopardy apply before the conviction is final?

Wait, when does jeopardy attach? In a trial, it's when the jury is sworn in or when the first witness is sworn in a bench trial. Once the trial is over, either through acquittal or conviction, jeopardy attaches. So if the conviction is on appeal, is he in jeopardy again?

But wait, the appeal is pending. I think that if a conviction is appealed, and if the appeal results in a reversal, then the case can be retried. But during the appeal, is the defendant still considered to be in jeopardy? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. But I think that once the trial ends with a conviction, jeopardy has attached. So if the conviction is being appealed, and during that time, new charges are brought, does that violate double jeopardy?

Wait, but in this scenario, the defendant has been convicted in state court. So the state court case is on appeal. Now, the same state brings another indictment for conspiracy. So, same sovereign, different charge.

But if the first conviction is on appeal, and the state brings another charge, would that be double jeopardy? Because if the first conviction is reversed on appeal, the state could retry him for the same offense. But bringing a different charge while the appeal is pending—does that count as double jeopardy?

Alternatively, if the state's first case is on appeal, and the state brings another case, perhaps that's allowed because the first case's outcome isn't final. But wait, the double jeopardy clause applies once the first trial has concluded. So even if the conviction is on appeal, the state can't try him again for the same offense. But for a different offense, perhaps it's allowed.

Wait, but in this case, the initial charge was possession with intent, and now the new charge is conspiracy. Since they are different offenses under Blockburger, the state could prosecute for both, assuming that the same conduct isn't being used in a way that violates double jeopardy. But wait, if the same transaction is being used, the state might be barred if the charges are the same or if one is a lesser included offense of the other.

Wait, let me think. The initial charge was possession with intent to distribute. Conspiracy requires an agreement to distribute. So if in the first trial, the state proved that he had the cocaine and intended to distribute it, and now the state is charging him with conspiring to distribute the same cocaine. But if he acted alone, maybe there's no conspiracy. But if he was part of a group, then conspiracy would involve others. But assuming the same conduct, perhaps the state can charge both.

But wait, the initial case is on appeal. So if the state is bringing another case against him while the first is on appeal, is that allowed? Because the first case's conviction isn't final yet. So maybe the state can't bring another case until the first is resolved.

Alternatively, maybe the state can bring a different charge because it's a separate offense, even if related. I'm a bit confused here. But wait, the key point might be that the state and federal governments are separate sovereigns. So even if the state can't bring another charge, the federal government can.

Wait, but the question is about the two new indictments: one state and one federal, both for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. So the state and federal governments are each indicting him for conspiracy. The issue is whether either of these violates double jeopardy.

In the case of multiple sovereigns, each can prosecute for the same conduct because they are separate sovereigns. So the state could prosecute him, and the federal government could prosecute him as well, without violating double jeopardy. But wait, what about if the state case is still on appeal? Does that affect the federal case?

Wait, in this case, the state court has already convicted him, and that conviction is on appeal. So the state's first prosecution is still ongoing. Now, the state has indicted him again for conspiracy. So same sovereign, different charge. So does that violate double jeopardy? Also, the federal government has indicted him as well.

Wait, the initial state case was for possession with intent. Now, the new state indictment is for conspiracy. Are these offenses the same under Blockburger? As I thought earlier, they are different. So the state can prosecute for both. But wait, the initial case's conviction is on appeal. So if that's reversed, the state could retry him for possession with intent. But bringing a new charge for conspiracy while the first is on appeal—does that violate double jeopardy?

I think that once the first trial concludes with a conviction, jeopardy attaches, and the state cannot try him again for the same offense. But for a different offense, it's allowed. So if the state is bringing a different charge, that's okay. So the state's second indictment for conspiracy might be permissible, as it's a different offense. Unless the conspiracy charge is based on the same conduct and is part of the same transaction, perhaps it's considered part of the same offense.

Wait, but in the initial case, he was convicted of possession with intent. Conspiracy to distribute would require proof of an agreement, which possession with intent does not. So under Blockburger, they're different offenses, so double jeopardy doesn't bar the state from prosecuting both.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state can't bring the conspiracy charge because it arises from the same conduct. But I think the dual sovereignty applies only to separate sovereigns. So the state can bring a second charge, but perhaps only once. Wait, no, the state, as a single sovereign, can bring multiple charges as long as they're not the same offense.

So, in this scenario, the state could bring both charges because they're different offenses. So the state's second indictment might not be barred by double jeopardy. But the federal indictment is from a different sovereign, so that's allowed regardless under dual sovereignty.

Wait, but wait. The initial state case is on appeal. So the conviction is not yet final. But for double jeopardy purposes, once the trial is over, jeopardy attaches, regardless of appeals. So even if the conviction is reversed on appeal, the state can't retry him for the same offense. But for a different offense, they can.

So in this case, the state is bringing a new charge for conspiracy while the initial case is on appeal. Since it's a different offense, the state's new indictment doesn't violate double jeopardy. Similarly, the federal government's indictment is for conspiracy, a different offense, and since it's a different sovereign, it's allowed.

Wait, but wait. The federal indictment is for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. So the federal charge is conspiracy, and the state's initial charge was possession with intent. Are these the same offense under Blockburger? Let's see. Possession with intent requires possession and intent to distribute. Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit the crime. So different elements. So under Blockburger, they're different offenses. So the federal government can prosecute him for conspiracy, even if the state has already convicted him for possession with intent.

But wait, the initial state case is on appeal. So if the state's conviction is overturned, then perhaps the federal case could be affected. But that's a separate issue. As it stands, the state case's conviction is on appeal, but the federal case is a separate prosecution.

So, in this scenario, the state's second indictment (for conspiracy) is permissible because it's a different offense. The federal indictment is permissible because it's a different sovereign and a different offense.

Wait, but the question is whether the new indictments must be dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. So the options are about whether either or both should be dismissed.

So, the state's new indictment is for conspiracy, a different offense, so no double jeopardy. The federal indictment is a different sovereign, so no problem. So neither indictment should be dismissed, meaning the answer would be E: neither of the indictments.

Wait, but let me think again. The state initially convicted him of possession with intent, which is a completed offense. Conspiracy is a separate offense, but perhaps it's part of the same transaction. But under Blockburger, as long as each offense requires proof of a different fact, they're not the same. So the state can prosecute both.

But wait, what about the fact that the state is prosecuting him again while the initial case is on appeal. Does that affect anything? I think that once the trial is over, jeopardy attaches, so the state can't try him again for the same offense, but can for a different one. So the state's new indictment for conspiracy, being a different offense, is allowed.

So, the state's second indictment and the federal indictment both don't violate double jeopardy. So the motions to dismiss both should fail, meaning neither indictment is dismissed. So the answer is E.

But wait, looking back, the options are A through J. Option E is 'neither of the indictments.' So that's the answer.

Wait, but some sources say that if the initial case is on appeal, the state cannot bring a new prosecution for a different offense arising from the same conduct because it would be considered a continuation of the same case. But I'm not sure about that. I think that once the trial is over, the state can bring a new case for a different offense, even if related. So the state's second indictment is allowed.

Thus, the answer should be E: neither of the indictments.

The question revolves around whether the new state and federal indictments for conspiracy to distribute cocaine violate double jeopardy. The defendant was initially convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics and is now facing new indictments while his appeal is pending. Double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached, but there are exceptions, such as the dual sovereignty doctrine, which allows separate sovereigns (state and federal governments) to prosecute for the same conduct.

The initial state conviction was for possession with intent to distribute, while the new indictments are for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. Under the Blockburger test, these are distinct offenses because they require proof of different facts. Possession with intent involves having the drug with the intention to distribute, while conspiracy involves an agreement to distribute. Since they are separate offenses, the state can prosecute for both without violating double jeopardy. Similarly, the federal government, as a separate sovereign, can prosecute for conspiracy under the dual sovereignty doctrine.

Although the initial state conviction is on appeal, jeopardy attached when the trial concluded, meaning the state cannot retry the defendant for the same offense. However, it can prosecute for a different offense, such as conspiracy, as it is not barred by double jeopardy. The federal indictment is also permissible because it involves a different sovereign and a different offense.

Given that neither the state nor the federal indictment violates double jeopardy, both indictments should not be dismissed.
