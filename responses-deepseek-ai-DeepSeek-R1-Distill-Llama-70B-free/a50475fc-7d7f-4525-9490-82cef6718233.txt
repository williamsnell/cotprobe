Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the total charge of a nonconducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through. 

Alright, the sphere is solid and nonconducting, which probably means the charge is distributed throughout the volume. The charge density isn't constant, though—it varies with the radial distance r. The given density is ρ = (14.1 pC/m³) * (r/R), right? And the radius R is 5.60 cm. I need to find the total charge.

Wait, so the formula for total charge Q should be the integral of the charge density over the entire volume of the sphere. Oh right, because charge is density multiplied by volume, but since the density varies, it's an integral instead of a simple multiplication.

So the volume element in spherical coordinates is a bit tricky. But I remember that for a sphere, each thin shell at radius r has a volume of 4πr² dr. So the integral would go from 0 to R, and multiply ρ(r) by this volume element each time.

Let me write that down. Q = ∫ρ(r) * dV. And dV is 4πr² dr. So substituting ρ(r), it becomes Q = ∫ (14.1e-12 C/m³) * (r/R) * 4πr² dr, integrated from 0 to R.

Wait, why 14.1e-12? Oh right, because 1 pC is 1e-12 C. So 14.1 pC/m³ is 14.1e-12 C/m³.

Let me simplify the integral. So Q = (14.1e-12) * (4π/R) ∫ (r^3) dr from 0 to R. Wait, because (r/R) * r² is r³, and the 1/R comes out of the integral.

Hmm, integrating r³ with respect to r gives (r^4)/4. Evaluated from 0 to R, that's (R^4)/4 - 0. So substituting back, Q = (14.1e-12) * (4π/R) * (R^4/4).

Simplify that. The 4 in numerator and denominator cancels out. So (4π/R) * (R^4/4) becomes π R^3. So now it's Q = (14.1e-12) * π R³.

Wait, let me double-check that math. So (4π/R) * (R^4/4) = (4π R^4) / (4 R) ) = π R^3. Yeah, that makes sense. So Q = 14.1e-12 * π * R³.

Now, plugging in R as 5.60 cm. Oh wait, units are important here. Since the charge density is in m³, I should convert R to meters. So R = 5.60 cm = 0.056 m.

So R³ is (0.056)^3. Let me calculate that. 0.056 is 5.6e-2 meters. So (5.6e-2)^3 = (5.6)^3 * 1e-6. 5.6^3 is 5.6 * 5.6 = 31.36, then 31.36 *5.6. Let me compute that: 31.36 *5 = 156.8, 31.36 *0.6 = 18.816. Total is 175.616. So 175.616e-6 m³.

So R³ = 175.616e-6 m³. Hmm, but wait, 5.6e-2 to the third is 5.6^3 * (1e-2)^3 = 175.616 * 1e-6 = 1.75616e-4 m³.

Wait, wait, 0.056^3 is (5.6e-2)^3 = (5.6)^3 * 1e-6. Because (1e-2)^3 is 1e-6. So 5.6^3 is 175.616, so 175.616e-6 m³, which is 0.000175616 m³.

So putting it all together: Q = 14.1e-12 C/m³ * π * 0.000175616 m³.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 14.1e-12 * 0.000175616. Wait, 0.000175616 is 1.75616e-4. So 14.1e-12 * 1.75616e-4 = (14.1 * 1.75616) * 1e-16.

Compute 14.1 * 1.75616. Let me see: 14 * 1.75616 is about 24.58624, and 0.1 * 1.75616 is 0.175616. Adding them together gives 24.58624 + 0.175616 ≈ 24.761856.

So 24.761856e-16 C. Now multiply by π (approx 3.1416). So 24.761856 * 3.1416 ≈ let me calculate that.

24 * 3.1416 is about 75.3984. 0.761856 *3.1416 ≈ approx 2.391. So total is around 75.3984 + 2.391 ≈ 77.7894. So 77.7894e-16 C.

Wait, wait, no. Because the calculation was 24.761856e-16 * π = 77.79e-16 C. Because 24.761856 * π is approximately 77.79.

So 77.79e-16 C is the same as 77.79 x 10^-16 C, which is 7.779e-14 C. Wait, no, wait. 77.79e-16 is 7.779e-15 C? Wait, no. Let me think: 1e-16 is 0.1e-15. So 77.79e-16 = 7.779e-15 C.

Wait, but wait, 14.1e-12 * (pi * R^3) = 14.1e-12 * pi * (0.056)^3.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's recalculate.

Compute R = 0.056 m.

R^3 = 0.056^3 = 0.056 * 0.056 *0.056.

0.056 *0.056 = 0.003136.

0.003136 *0.056 = let's compute that. 0.003136 * 0.05 = 0.0001568, 0.003136 *0.006= 0.000018816. Adding them: 0.0001568 + 0.000018816 = 0.000175616 m³.

So R^3 = 0.000175616 m³.

So now, 14.1e-12 C/m³ * 0.000175616 m³ = 14.1e-12 * 1.75616e-4 = ?

14.1 * 1.75616e-16 (since 1e-12 *1e-4=1e-16). 14.1 *1.75616 is 24.761856, so 24.761856e-16 C.

Multiply by pi: 24.761856e-16 * pi ≈ 24.761856 *3.14159265 ≈ 77.787e-16 C.

Wait, 24.761856 *3 = 74.285568, 24.761856 * 0.14159265 ≈ approx 24.761856 *0.14 is 3.46686, so total around 77.752. So 77.752e-16 C.

But wait, 77.752e-16 C is 7.7752e-15 C? Wait, no. 77.752e-16 is the same as 7.7752e-15? Wait, no. Wait, 1e-15 is 10^-15. So 77.752e-16 is 7.7752e-15.

Wait, no, 77.752e-16 is 0.77752e-14, because 1e-14 is 10e-15. So 77.752e-16 = 7.7752e-15 C.

So that's 7.7752e-15 C. Now, what's that in femtocoulombs (fC)? Because 1fC is 1e-15 C.

So 7.7752e-15 C is 7.7752 fC. Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are A:8.20, B:11.89, C:10.47, D:12.56, E:4.22, F:7.78, G:5.62, H:9.34, I:3.14, J:6.50.

Option F is 7.78 fC. That's very close to what I got, 7.7752 fC. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but wait, did I miss a factor somewhere? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, Q = integral from 0 to R of (14.1e-12 * r/R) * 4 pi r² dr.

Which is 14.1e-12 * (4 pi / R) * integral r^3 dr from 0 to R.

The integral of r^3 dr is R^4/4. So 14.1e-12 * (4 pi/R) * (R^4/4) = 14.1e-12 * pi R^3.

Wait, so R is 0.056 m. So R^3 is 0.000175616 m³. So 14.1e-12 * pi * 0.000175616.

14.1e-12 * 0.000175616 = 14.1e-12 * 1.75616e-4 = (14.1 * 1.75616) * 1e-16 = 24.761856e-16.

Multiply by pi: 24.761856e-16 *3.14159 ≈ 77.79e-16 C, which is 7.779e-15 C, which is 7.779 fC. So option F is 7.78 fC, which matches.

So the answer should be F.

To determine the total charge \( Q \) of a nonconducting sphere with a radially varying charge density \( \rho(r) = \frac{14.1 \, \mathrm{pC/m^3} \cdot r}{R} \), we integrate \( \rho(r) \) over the sphere's volume. The sphere has a radius \( R = 5.60 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.056 \, \mathrm{m} \).

### Step 1: Integral for Total Charge
The total charge is given by:
\[
Q = \int \rho(r) \, dV
\]
In spherical coordinates, the volume element is \( dV = 4\pi r^2 \, dr \). Substituting \( \rho(r) \), the integral becomes:
\[
Q = \int_0^R \left( \frac{14.1 \, \mathrm{pC/m^3} \cdot r}{R} \right) \cdot 4\pi r^2 \, dr
\]
Simplify:
\[
Q = \frac{14.1 \, \mathrm{pC/m^3} \cdot 4\pi}{R} \int_0^R r^3 \, dr
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Integral
The integral of \( r^3 \) is:
\[
\int_0^R r^3 \, dr = \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_0^R = \frac{R^4}{4}
\]
Substitute this result:
\[
Q = \frac{14.1 \, \mathrm{pC/m^3} \cdot 4\pi}{R} \cdot \frac{R^4}{4}
\]
Simplify:
\[
Q = 14.1 \, \mathrm{pC/m^3} \cdot \pi R^3
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( R^3 \)
Convert \( R = 0.056 \, \mathrm{m} \) and calculate \( R^3 \):
\[
R^3 = (0.056)^3 = 0.000175616 \, \mathrm{m^3}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( Q \)
Substitute \( R^3 \) into the equation for \( Q \):
\[
Q = 14.1 \, \mathrm{pC/m^3} \cdot \pi \cdot 0.000175616 \, \mathrm{m^3}
\]
Simplify:
\[
Q = 14.1 \cdot 0.000175616 \cdot \pi \, \mathrm{pC}
\]
First, compute \( 14.1 \cdot 0.000175616 \):
\[
14.1 \cdot 0.000175616 = 0.0024761856
\]
Now multiply by \( \pi \) (\( \pi \approx 3.1416 \)):
\[
Q = 0.0024761856 \cdot 3.1416 \approx 0.0077792 \, \mathrm{pC}
\]
Convert to femtocoulombs (\( 1 \, \mathrm{pC} = 1000 \, \mathrm{fC} \)):
\[
Q \approx 7.78 \, \mathrm{fC}
\]

### Final Answer
The total charge of the sphere is approximately \( 7.78 \, \mathrm{fC} \), which corresponds to **option F**.

F
