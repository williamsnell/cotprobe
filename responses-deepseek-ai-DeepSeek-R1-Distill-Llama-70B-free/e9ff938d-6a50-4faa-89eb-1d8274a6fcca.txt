Okay, so I have this physics problem here about bulk modulus and volume change under pressure. Hmm, I remember that bulk modulus relates to how much a material resists compression. The formula I think is B = -V/P * dP/dV or something like that. Right, because when you apply pressure, the volume changes a little.

The problem says the solid has a volume of 2.5 liters at 1 atm. Then the pressure is increased to 16 atm. So the change in pressure is 15 atm, because 16 minus 1 is 15. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes these problems consider the pressure change as the external pressure minus atmospheric, but I think here it's the same because the initial is 1 atm.

Wait, the bulk modulus is given as 2e12 dynes/cm². I should remember the units here. Oh right, 1 atm is about 1.013e6 dynes/cm². So to calculate the change in volume, I can use the formula:

delta V = -V0 * delta P / B

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the sign. Since pressure increases, the volume should decrease, so delta V would be negative. But the problem probably just wants the magnitude of the change, so I'll take the absolute value.

So first, compute delta P. Initial pressure is 1 atm, final is 16 atm, so delta P is 15 atm. Converting that to dynes/cm²: 15 atm * 1.013e6 dyn/cm²/atm. Let me calculate that. 15 * 1e6 is 1.5e7, but more precisely, 15 * 1.013e6 is 15.195e6 dyn/cm².

Now, plug into the formula: delta V = V0 * (delta P)/B. Wait wait, no: the formula is delta V = -V0 * (delta P) / B. So the change in volume is negative, meaning a decrease.

But let me use the numbers correctly. V0 is 2.5 liters. Oh wait, I need to convert that to cm³. Because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 2.5 liters is 2500 cm³.

So delta V = (2500 cm³) * (15.195e6 dyn/cm²) / (2e12 dyn/cm²)

Wait, let's compute that. The dyn/cm² units will cancel out.

So 2500 * 15.195e6 = let's compute 2500 * 15.195e6. 2500 is 2.5e3, 15.195e6 is 1.5195e7. Multiply them: 2.5e3 * 1.5195e7 = 3.79875e10.

Then divide by 2e12: 3.79875e10 / 2e12 = 0.1899375. So delta V is approximately 0.1899375 cm³. But wait, wait a second: the formula is delta V = -V0 * (delta P) / B. So the change is negative, but the problem is asking for the change in volume, so perhaps the magnitude is positive. Or maybe I should just report it as a small decrease. So the change is about 0.19 cm³ decrease, which is 1.9e-1 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, the first part is like 19e-3 cm³, which is 0.019 cm³. Hmm, but wait my calculation gives 0.1899 cm³, which is 189e-3 cm³. That's not matching any of the options.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, 15 atm times 1.013e6 is 15 *1.013e6 = 15.195e6 dyn/cm².

V0 is 2500 cm³.

So delta V = (2500) * (15.195e6) / (2e12) = (2500 * 15.195e6) / 2e12.

Calculating numerator: 2500 *15.195e6 = 2500 * 1.5195e7 = (2.5e3) * (1.5195e7) )= 2.5 *1.5195e10 = 3.79875e10.

Denominator 2e12 is 2e12.

So 3.79875e10 / 2e12 = 0.1899375 cm³.

So that's 0.1899375 cm³, which is approximately 0.19 cm³. But none of the options have that as the first part.

Wait the options: option D is 18.99e-3 cm³, which is 0.01899 cm³. Hmm, that's an order of magnitude smaller than what I got. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula is delta V = -(V0) * (delta P) / B. So yes, same as above.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the exponent in the bulk modulus. The bulk modulus is 2e12 dynes/cm². So 2 times 10^12, which is correct.

Wait, let me recalculate the delta V.

2500 cm³ * 15.195e6 dyn/cm² = 2500 * 15.195e6 = ?

Wait, 2500 * 15.195e6 = 2500 * 1.5195e7 = 2500 *1.5195 *1e7.

2500 is 2.5e3, so 2.5e3 * 1.5195e7 = (2.5 *1.5195) * 1e10.

2.5 *1.5195 is 3.79875, so 3.79875e10.

Divide by 2e12: 3.79875e10 / 2e12 = 0.1899375 cm³.

Wait, so that's 0.1899375 cm³, which is 189.9375e-3 cm³. Looking at the options, none have 190e-3. The closest is D: 18.99e-3, which is an order of magnitude less. Did I mess up the exponents somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up liters and cm³. Let's double-check. 2.5 liters is 2500 cm³, yes, because 1 liter = 1000 cm³.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the change in pressure as P = 16 atm minus 1 atm, which is 15 atm, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is delta V = (V0) * (delta P) / (B). Wait, no, the bulk modulus B is defined as B = -V (dP)/(dV), so dV = -V dP/B. So delta V is approximately -V0 delta P / B.

Wait, but I've done that. So I'm getting 0.1899 cm³. So 0.19 cm³ would be 1.9e-1 cm³, which is 190e-3 cm³. The options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is delta V = (V0) (delta P) / B, but with pressure in different units. Oh wait, no, because I converted atm to dyn/cm².

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute delta P as (P_external - P_initial). Yes, that's what I did. 16 atm -1 atm is 15 atm.

Wait, perhaps I should use P = 15 atm. Let me compute 15 atm in dyn/cm² again. 1 atm is 1.01325e6 dyn/cm², so 15 atm is 15 * 1.01325e6 = 1.519875e7 dyn/cm².

So yes, that part is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 2500 multiplied by 1.519875e7.

Wait, 2500 is 2.5e3. So 2.5e3 * 1.519875e7 = (2.5 * 1.519875) e10.

2.5 * 1.519875 = Let's compute that: 2 * 1.519875 = 3.03975, 0.5 *1.519875=0.7599375. So total is 3.03975 + 0.7599375 = 3.7996875.

So 3.7996875e10. Divide by 2e12: 3.7996875e10 / 2e12 = (3.7996875 / 2) e(-2) = 1.89984375e-2. Which is 0.0189984375 cm³. Oh wait! That's approximately 0.019 cm³, which is 19e-3 cm³.

Wait what, wait. Oh wait a second! Because 3.7996875e10 divided by 2e12 is 0.0189984375 cm³, not 0.1899 cm³ as I thought earlier. Oh I see where I went wrong.

Wait, 3.8e10 divided by 2e12 is (3.8 / 2) * 1e(10-12) )= 1.9 * 1e-2 = 0.019. Oh man, I messed up the exponents earlier. So delta V is 0.018998 cm³, which is approximately 19e-3 cm³.

So the first part of the answer is approximately 19e-3 cm³. Looking at the options, option A is 19e-3 cm³, option D is 18.99e-3, which is very close.

So the change in volume is about 19e-3 cm³ decrease. Now, the second part of the question is about the additional energy per unit volume stored.

The formula for energy stored due to compression is E = (B * (delta V / V0)^2 ) / 2. Or wait, I think it's E = (B * (delta V)^2 )/(2 V0). Or perhaps E per unit volume is (B (delta V / V0)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, because energy per unit volume (energy density) for linear elasticity is (1/2) B (strain)^2, where strain is delta V / V0. Because in 3D, the volumetric strain is delta V / V0, and the energy per unit volume is (1/2) B (delta V / V0)^2.

Alternatively, the work done is pressure times change in volume, but since pressure is not constant, you have to integrate. For small strains, it's approximately (1/2) delta P * delta V.

Wait, maybe another approach: The energy stored per unit volume is (1/2) * (delta P) * (delta V / V0) ). Because delta P is the pressure change, and delta V / V0 is the volumetric strain.

Wait, but let me think more carefully. The energy stored (work done) during compression is the integral of P dV from V0 to V0 + delta V.

But since P isn't constant, you have to express it in terms of B and the strain.

From Hooke's law for solids, the pressure (stress) is related to strain by P = B * (delta V / V0) / (1 + delta V / V0), but for small delta V, the denominator is approximately 1, so P ≈ B * (delta V / V0).

Wait, but delta V is negative (decrease), so perhaps P = -B (delta V / V0).

So the energy per unit volume is (1/2) * B * (strain)^2.

Strain is delta V / V0. So energy per volume is (1/2) B (delta V / V0)^2.

Alternatively, since E = work done, which is integral from V0 to V of P dV.

But P as a function of V is P = B * (V0 - V)/V0. Wait no, because for small changes, P ≈ B * (delta V / V0).

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think step by step.

The bulk modulus B is defined as B = -V (dP)/(dV), so dP = -B (dV)/V.

At initial state, V = V0, so dP = -B (dV)/V0.

So the pressure is P = integral of dP from V0 to V.

But this is a bit tricky. Alternatively, for small changes, the pressure change delta P is approximately -B (delta V)/V0.

So delta P ≈ -B (delta V)/V0.

We can rearrange this to find delta V = -V0 (delta P)/B.

Which is what we used earlier. So for the energy, the work done is the integral from V0 to V of P dV.

But for small delta V, P is approximately a linear function. So P = 0 at V0, and increases as V decreases. So the average pressure is approximately (P_initial + P_final)/2.

Wait, but P_initial is 1 atm, and P_final is 16 atm. But wait, that's the applied pressure. Alternatively, the stress in the material is proportional to the strain.

But perhaps a better way is to model the energy as the elastic energy stored, which for a volume under hydrostatic pressure is (1/2) B (strain)^2, where strain is delta V / V0.

So delta V is -19e-3 cm³, so the strain is (delta V)/V0 = (-19e-3 cm³) / 2500 cm³ = -7.6e-6.

So the strain squared is (7.6e-6)^2 = about 5.8e-11.

Then energy per unit volume is (1/2) * B * (strain)^2.

So plugging in the numbers: (0.5) * (2e12 dyn/cm²) * (5.8e-11) ) = (1e12) *5.8e-11 = 5.8e1 = 58 erg/cm³.

Wait, 1e12 * 5.8e-11 = 0.58e1 = 5.8, multiplied by 0.5 gives 2.9? Wait, no, let me recompute.

Wait, (1/2) * 2e12 * (5.8e-11) = (1e12) *5.8e-11 = 5.8e1 = 58 erg/cm³.

Wait, that's 58 erg/cm³. Looking at the options, option H is 58 erg/cm³, but the first part is 14e-3 cm³, which doesn't match. Option D has 65.4 erg/cm³. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per unit volume is delta P times delta V per unit volume. That is, (delta P) * (delta V / V0).

Wait, delta P is 15 atm, which is 15 *1.013e6 dyn/cm² = 1.5195e7 dyn/cm².

delta V is 19e-3 cm³, V0 is 2500 cm³.

So delta V / V0 = 19e-3 /2500 = 7.6e-6.

So energy per unit volume is (1/2) * delta P * (delta V / V0) = 0.5 * 1.5195e7 dyn/cm² * 7.6e-6.

Calculating that: 1.5195e7 *7.6e-6 = (1.5195 *7.6) *1e1 = approx 11.56 *10 = 115.6.

Multiply by 0.5: 57.8 erg/cm³. So approximately 58 erg/cm³.

Looking back at the options, option H has 14e-3 cm³ and 58 erg/cm³. But our delta V is 19e-3, which matches option A (19e-3, 68 erg/cm³) and option D (18.99e-3, 65.4 erg/cm³).

Wait, but I calculated the energy as approximately 58 erg/cm³, but that doesn't match any option with 19e-3 cm³. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the energy calculation.

Wait another approach. The energy stored per unit volume is (1/2) B (epsilon)^2, where epsilon is the volumetric strain (delta V / V0).

epsilon = delta V / V0 = (19e-3 cm³) / 2500 cm³ = 7.6e-6.

So (1/2) * 2e12 * (7.6e-6)^2.

Wait, (7.6e-6)^2 is 5.8e-11.

So 0.5 * 2e12 *5.8e-11 = (1e12) *5.8e-11 = 5.8e1=58 erg/cm³.

Hmm, same result as before.

But none of the options with 19e-3 cm³ have 58 erg/cm³. Option A has 68, option D has 65.4. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the energy is calculated as (1/2) * (delta P)^2 * V0 / B.

Because delta P = B (delta V / V0 ), so delta V = (delta P V0 ) / B.

So E = (1/2) P delta V.

But P is the pressure, delta V is the change in volume. Wait, but pressure is varying during compression, so the average pressure is (P_initial + P_final)/2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, E = (1/2) * (delta P) * (delta V).

delta V is 19e-3 cm³. delta P is 15 atm = 1.5195e7 dyn/cm².

So E = 0.5 * 1.5195e7 *19e-3 = 0.5 *1.5195e7 *1.9e-2.

Calculating:

1.5195e7 *1.9e-2 = (1.5195 *1.9) *1e5.

1.5195 *1.9 is approx 2.886. So 2.886e5 ergs.

Multiply by 0.5:
