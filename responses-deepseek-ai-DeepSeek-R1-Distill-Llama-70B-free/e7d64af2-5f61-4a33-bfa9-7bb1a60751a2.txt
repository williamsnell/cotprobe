Okay, so I have this question here about trade discounts. Hmm, let me think. I remember that trade discounts are the difference between the list price and the net price. The list price is like the original price before any discounts, right? And the net price is what the buyer actually pays after the discount has been applied.

So the problem says the list price of the book is $4.95, and the net price is $2.95. I need to find the trade discount. Oh right, the formula should be trade discount equals list price minus net price. So I subtract $2.95 from $4.95.

Let me do the math. 4.95 minus 2.95. Well, 4 minus 2 is 2, and 0.95 minus 0.95 is zero. So that would make it $2.00. Wait, but let me double-check that because sometimes these questions can be tricky.

Wait, no, wait. 4.95 minus 2.95. Let me subtract step by step. 4.95 minus 2 is 2.95. Then I subtract the remaining 0.95. So 2.95 minus 0.95 is $2.00. Yeah, that makes sense. So the trade discount is $2.00.

Looking at the options, option I is $2.00. So the answer should be I. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes trade discount can be a percentage, but here the question is asking for the amount, so it's definitely the difference in dollars.

Another way to think about it is, the bookstore gets a discount from the list price. So the amount they save is the trade discount. So list price is what the book is supposed to cost, but the net is what the store pays. So the difference is the discount the store receives. So yes, 4.95 - 2.95 is indeed 2.00. So I'm confident the answer is I.

The trade discount is calculated as the difference between the list price and the net price. Given a list price of $4.95 and a net price of $2.95, the trade discount is:

\[
\text{Trade Discount} = \text{List Price} - \text{Net Price} = 4.95 - 2.95 = 2.00
\]

Thus, the amount of the trade discount is $2.00, which corresponds to option I.
