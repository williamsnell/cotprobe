Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the resistance of a nichrome wire. Hmm, I remember that resistance in a wire depends on a few factors. Oh right, the formula is R = resistivity * (length / area). 

The question gives me the length as 225 centimeters. Wait, I need to make sure the units are right. Oh, right, resistivity is usually in ohm-meters, so I should convert centimeters to meters. 225 cm is 2.25 meters because there are 100 cm in a meter. 

The cross-sectional area is 0.015 square centimeters. Oh, I think I need to convert that to square meters as well. Since 1 meter is 100 cm, 1 square meter is (100 cm)^2, which is 10,000 cm². So 0.015 cm² would be 0.015 / 10,000 = 0.0000015 m². Alternatively, that's 1.5e-6 m². 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the resistivity of nichrome. I think it's a common material used in heating elements. Oh right, nichrome is nickel-chromium alloy. I remember that the resistivity for nichrome is around 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm-meters. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I think that's right. So resistivity (rho) is 1.1e-6 ohm·m.

Now plug those into the formula. R = rho * (L/A). So L is 2.25 m, A is 1.5e-6 m². Let's compute the ratio L/A first. 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = (2.25)/(0.0000015). Let's compute that: 2.25 divided by 0.0000015. Hmm, 2.25 divided by 0.0000015 is the same as 2.25 / (1.5e-6) = (2.25 / 1.5 ) * 1e6. 

2.25 divided by 1.5 is 1.5. So 1.5 * 1e6 is 1.5e6. So L/A is 1.5e6 meters^-1. 

Then multiply by rho (1.1e-6 ohm·m): R = 1.1e-6 * 1.5e6. Let's compute that. 1.1 *1.5 is 1.65, and 1e-6 *1e6 is 1. So R is 1.65 ohms. 

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C is 2.25 ohms. Option A is 15, B is 1.5. Hmm, my calculation got 1.65, but that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the resistivity value. Let me think again about nichrome's resistivity. Oh wait, another source I remember said nichrome's resistivity is around 1.2e-6 ohm·m. Let me recalculate with that value.

So if rho is 1.2e-6, then R = 1.2e-6 * (2.25 / 0.0000015). Wait, same L/A ratio, which was 1.5e6. So 1.2e-6 * 1.5e6 = (1.2 *1.5) * (1e-6 *1e6) = 1.8 *1=1.8 ohms. Still not matching the options. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the unit conversions. Let's double-check. The area was 0.015 cm². Converting to m²: since 1 cm = 0.01 m, 1 cm² is (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m². So 0.015 cm² is 0.015 * 0.0001 = 0.0000015 m², which is 1.5e-6 m². Correct.

Wait another thought: sometimes resistivity is given in ohm-centimeters? No, I think it's ohm-meters. So I think my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh no, the formula R = rho * L/A is correct. So perhaps the resistivity value is different. Let me think again. Maybe I should look up the exact value of nichrome. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up, but perhaps I should recall better. Oh wait, I think nichrome's resistivity is about 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm·m, yes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nichrome wire's length was 225 cm, which is 2.25 meters, correct. Area is 0.015 cm², which is 1.5e-6 m², correct.

So with R = 1.1e-6 * 2.25 / (1.5e-6). Let me compute 2.25 / 1.5e-6. 2.25 / 1.5 is 1.5, so 1.5 / 1e-6 is 1.5e6. So 1.1e-6 * 1.5e6 = 1.65 ohms. So R is 1.65 ohms, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

A:15, B:1.5, C:2.25, D:50, E:0.15, F:225, G:0.225, H:0.015, I:150, J:100.

Oh, wait, option B is 1.5, option C is 2.25, option A is 15. My calculation is 1.65. None of the options match exactly. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Oh no, R= rho L/(A). Yes. Another possibility: perhaps the resistivity is given in a different unit. Wait, maybe I'm confusing micro-ohm meters or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the value I'm thinking of is 1.1e-6 ohm·m, but maybe I should consider it as 1.1e-6 ohm·cm. Oh wait, that would change everything.

Wait, no, resistivity is in ohm·meter, not ohm·cm. Ohm·cm would be a huge unit because 1 ohm·cm is 100 ohm·meter. So if I mistakenly used ohm·cm, then I would have a much larger R. Let me think: if rho is 1.1e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.1e-4 ohm·cm (since 1 m=100 cm, so 1 ohm·m = 0.01 ohm·cm). So 1.1e-6 ohm·m = 1.1e-6 * 0.01 = 1.1e-8 ohm·cm. 

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Maybe another approach. Let me compute with the given numbers again. 

Resistivity (rho) of nichrome = 1.1e-6 ohm·meter.

Length L = 225 cm = 2.25 meters.

Area A = 0.015 cm² = 0.015 * (0.01 m)^2 = 0.015 * 0.0001 m² = 0.0000015 m² = 1.5e-6 m².

So R = rho * L / A.

Plugging in the numbers:

R = (1.1e-6) * (2.25) / (1.5e-6).

Compute denominator first: 1.5e-6 is 0.0000015.

So 2.25 / 0.0000015 = 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = (2.25/1.5) * 1e6 = 1.5 * 1e6 = 1.5e6.

Multiply by rho: 1.1e-6 * 1.5e6 = 1.65 ohms.

But wait, the options don't have 1.65. So maybe I did something wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the resistivity is considered differently. Maybe the resistivity is 1.1e-6 ohm·m, but perhaps I should have used 1.1e-4 ohm·cm. Oh wait, no. Because 1 ohm·m is 100 ohm·cm. So 1e-6 ohm·m is 1e-4 ohm·cm. So 1.1e-6 ohm·m is 1.1e-4 ohm·cm.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate using ohm·cm units. Let me try that approach.

In ohm·cm units:

rho = 1.1e-4 ohm·cm.

L = 225 cm.

A = 0.015 cm².

So R = rho * L / A.

So R = (1.1e-4 ohm·cm) * (225 cm) / (0.015 cm²).

Compute numerator: 1.1e-4 * 225 = 0.02525.

Denominator: 0.015.

So R = 0.02525 / 0.015 = 1.6833... ohms. Approximately 1.68 ohms.

Still, no option matches. So perhaps the value of resistivity I'm using is wrong. Maybe it's 1.2e-6 ohm·m. Let's try that.

R = (1.2e-6) * 2.25 / 1.5e-6.

1.2e-6 / 1.5e-6 is 0.8. 0.8 * 2.25 = 1.8 ohms. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the cross-sectional area is 0.015 cm² or 0.015 m². No, the question says 0.015 square centimeters, so that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L/A.

Wait, L is 2.25 m, A is 1.5e-6 m².

So L/A is 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.5 first. 2.25 divided by 1.5 is 1.5.

So 1.5 / 1e-6 = 1.5e6.

Yes, so that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the given options are approximate, and 1.65 is closest to option B (1.5) or C (2.25). Let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in the resistivity value.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the resistivity value. Another thought: nichrome has a resistivity of approximately 1.10 × 10^-6 ohm·meter at 20°C. So 1.1e-6 is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use a different value of resistivity. Let's say if I had used rho as 1e-6, then R would be 2.25 / 1.5e-6 * 1e-6. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me compute that.

Wait, no, if rho were 1e-6, then R = 1e-6 * (2.25 / 1.5e-6) = 1e-6 * 1.5e6 = 1.5 ohms. Oh, that's option B. So perhaps I thought the resistivity was 1.1e-6, but the problem expects me to use 1e-6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a rounded value for rho. So if I compute with rho=1e-6, R=1.5 ohms, which is option B. But if I use 1.1e-6, I get 1.65, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B. But wait, why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, with rho=1.1e-6 ohm·m:

R = 1.1e-6 * (2.25 m) / (1.5e-6 m²) --> 

Wait, wait, no, 1.5e-6 m² is the area. Wait, no, the formula is R = rho * (L / A). So:

R = 1.1e-6 * (2.25 / 1.5e-6 )

So 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = 2.25 / 0.0000015 = 1,500,000 (because 0.0000015 * 1.5e6 = 2.25). So 1.1e-6 * 1.5e6 = 1.65 ohms.

Hmm. So 1.65 isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me recheck.

The cross-sectional area is 0.015 cm². Since 1 cm² is (1e-2 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 0.015 cm² is 0.015 * 1e-4 m² = 1.5e-6 m², which is correct.

Wait, maybe I confused cm and m somewhere. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the resistivity is given in ohm·cm, which I should have converted. Let's try that.

Wait, if rho is 1.1e-6 ohm·m, that's 1.1e-4 ohm·cm (since 1 ohm·m = 100 ohm·cm).

So rho = 1.1e-4 ohm·cm.

Length L is 225 cm.

Area A is 0.015 cm².

So R = rho * L / A.

R = (1.1e-4 ohm·cm) * (225 cm) / (0.015 cm² )

Compute numerator: 1.1e-4 * 225 = 0.0225 * 225 = 0.0225 * 200=4.5, 0.0225 *25=0.5625, so total 5.0625. Wait, no, 1.1e-4 is 0.00011. 0.00011 *225 = 0.02475.

Denominator: 0.015.

So R= 0.02475 / 0.015 = 1.65 ohms. Same result.

So regardless of the unit system, I get 1.65 ohms, which isn't an option. So perhaps the given options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the question says the wire is 225 centimeters long. Oh wait, centimeters, not meters. So 225 cm is 2.25 meters, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula uses length in meters. Yes, because resistivity is per meter.

Hmm. Maybe the actual resistivity is different. Another possibility is that the resistivity of nichrome is 1.2e-6 ohm·m. Let me try that.

R = 1.2e-6 * 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = (1.2 * 2.25) / (1.5) * (1e-6 / 1e-6) 

Wait, simplifying: (2.25 / 1.5) is 1.5. 1.2 * 1.5 = 1.8. So R=1.8 ohms. Still not matching any option.

Another thought: perhaps the area was given in square millimeters instead of square centimeters. Oh wait, no, the question says 0.015 square centimeters. 

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the resistivity I thought was 1.1e-6 is actually 1.5e-6. Let me try that.

R = 1.5e-6 * 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = (1.5 * 2.25) / 1.5 = 2.25 ohms. Oh, that's option C. So if the resistivity is 1.5e-6, then R=2.25 ohms, which is option C.

But wait, I thought nichrome's resistivity was around 1.1e-6. But perhaps the problem uses a rounded value of 1.5e-6. Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the resistivity of nichrome. 

Upon recalling, I think nichrome's resistivity is approximately 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm·m, but perhaps in this problem, they're using 1.5e-6 for simplicity. So with that, R would be 2.25 ohms, which is option C. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: look at the options and see which one aligns with the calculation. My correct calculation gives 1.65, but that's not an option. The closest option is B (1.5) and C (2.25). So perhaps the intended answer is C. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the resistivity value.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the resistivity of copper or another material. Copper has a much lower resistivity. Nichrome is higher. Let me think again: Copper is about 1.7e-8 ohm·m. Nichrome is higher, like 1.1e-6. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula was written as R = (rho * L) / A. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the length is in centimeters? No, when using rho in ohm·m, the length must be in meters.

Wait, perhaps I should compute without unit conversion, but that would be wrong. Let me think: If I mistakenly used length in cm and area in cm², and rho in ohm·m, that would cause errors.

R = (1.1e-6 ohm·m) * (225 cm) / (0.015 cm²).

But 225 cm is 2.25 m, and 0.015 cm² is
