Question:

A brick mason was hired by a builder under a written one-year contract, at an annual salary of $45,000, with employment to begin on March 1. Because the builder was unable to secure enough building contracts to keep all its employees busy during the season beginning March 1, it notified the brick mason on February 15 that it could not afford to employ him as a mason. At the same time, however, the builder offered to employ the mason, for the same contract period, as a night guard at an annual salary of $25,000. The mason declined the offer and remained unemployed during the year. No offer and remained unemployed during the year. No employment for brick masons was available in the community during the year, but the mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year. At the end of the year, in an action against the builder for breach of contract, how much, if anything, is the mason entitled to recover?

Options:

A: $20,000 (the difference between the mason's contract price and the salary offered for the night guard position).
B: $45,000 (the contract price).
C: Nothing, because the mason turned down a reasonable alternative employment offer.
D: Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages.
E: $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).
F: $45,000 plus damages for emotional distress.
G: Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason.
H: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a day laborer).
I: $45,000 minus any unemployment benefits the mason received during the year.
J: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a night guard).

Okay, so I have this legal question about contract law, specifically dealing with breach of contract and damages. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a brick mason who was hired by a builder under a written one-year contract. The annual salary was $45,000, starting on March 1. However, before the employment even began (on February 15), the builder told the mason they couldn't afford to employ him as a mason because they didn't have enough contracts. But the builder offered an alternative: they could hire him as a night guard for the same contract period at $25,000 a year. The mason turned down this offer and ended up unemployed for the year.

Now, the mason is suing the builder for breach of contract. The question is, how much can he recover?

I remember that when a contract is breached, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages. The main goal is to put them in the position they would have been in if the contract had been fulfilled. So the mason should be able to recover the difference between what he was supposed to earn and what he actually earned.

Wait, but the builder offered him another job. Does that affect anything? I think about the concept of mitigation of damages. The injured party (mason) has a duty to mitigate the loss, meaning they have to make reasonable efforts to find similar employment to minimize the damages. If they don't, and they could have earned elsewhere, their recovery might be reduced.

In this case, the builder offered the mason a job as a night guard at $25k. The mason turned it down. The question is whether that's a reasonable offer. If it's a similar position or uses the same skills, the mason might be expected to take it. But if it's a completely different job, maybe not. But in this scenario, the alternative job is as a night guard, which is a different role from being a brick mason.

However, the mason could have gotten other employment as a day laborer for up to $25k. So even if the night guard job wasn't suitable, he could have worked as a laborer. The fact that he didn't take any job and remained unemployed might impact his ability to recover the full amount.

The measure of damages here is typically the difference between the contract price and the market price (or what he could have earned). So the contract was for $45k. If he could have earned $25k elsewhere, the damages would be $45k minus $25k, which is $20k.

Looking at the options, option E says $20k, which is the contract price less what he could have earned. Option A also says $20k, but it's the difference between the mason's contract and the night guard offer. So which one applies?

Wait, the builder's offer was of a night guard job at $25k. The mason didn't take that, but he also didn't take the day laborer job. So maybe the builder's offer isn't the relevant point; it's about what the mason could have earned elsewhere. Because the duty to mitigate requires the mason to take any reasonable employment, regardless of who offers it.

So the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer. Therefore, his damages are $45k minus $25k, which is $20k. So that points to option E.

But wait, option A is about the difference between the two offers from the builder. Hmm. So which one is correct?

I think the key here is that the alternative employment doesn't have to be from the same employer. The mason's duty is to mitigate by finding any reasonable employment. So even though the builder offered a lower-paying job, the mason could have worked elsewhere for the same or similar pay. So the $25k he could have earned as a laborer is what's used to reduce the damages.

So the correct calculation would be $45k (contract) minus $25k (what he could have earned) = $20k. So the answer would be E.

Other options: Option D says nothing because he didn't mitigate. But in reality, the duty to mitigate doesn't mean the plaintiff gets nothing if they don't; it just reduces their recovery. So D isn't correct because he can still recover the difference.

So the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around a breach of contract case where a brick mason was hired under a one-year contract for $45,000, but the builder rescinded the offer before employment began. The builder offered an alternative position as a night guard for $25,000, which the mason declined. The mason remained unemployed, but alternative employment as a day laborer paying up to $25,000 was available. The issue is determining the mason's recovery for the builder's breach.

Under contract law, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that place them in the position they would have been in if the contract had been fulfilled. This includes the duty to mitigate damages by seeking reasonable alternative employment to minimize losses. If the injured party fails to mitigate, their recovery may be reduced by the amount they could have earned.

Here, the mason's contract price was $45,000, but he could have earned $25,000 as a day laborer. The builder's alternative offer of a night guard position is less relevant because the duty to mitigate requires seeking any reasonable employment, not necessarily from the breaching party. Therefore, the mason's damages are calculated as the difference between the contract price and the amount he could have earned through mitigation: $45,000 - $25,000 = $20,000.

Option E correctly reflects this calculation, as it accounts for the contract price less the amount the mason could have earned through reasonable alternative employment.

Answer: E
