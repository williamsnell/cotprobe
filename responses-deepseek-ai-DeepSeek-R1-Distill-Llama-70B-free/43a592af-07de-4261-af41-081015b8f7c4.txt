Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about x-rays and their wavelengths. I need to figure out the answers to two parts and then pick the correct option from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the first question is about the short-wave limit of the continuous x-ray spectrum produced by an x-ray tube operating at 30,000 volts. I remember that the short-wave limit, or the minimum wavelength, is determined by the maximum energy of the electrons hitting the target. The formula I think I need is lambda_min = hc/(eV), where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, e is the electron charge, and V is the voltage.

Wait, let me get the constants right. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The charge of an electron e is 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. The voltage here is 30,000 volts, which is 3.0 x 10^4 volts.

So plugging in the numbers: lambda_min = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / (1.602e-19 * 3.0e4). Let me calculate this step by step.

First, the numerator: 6.626e-34 times 3.0e8. Let's see, 6.626 * 3 is about 19.878. Then the exponents: 1e-34 * 1e8 is 1e-26. So the numerator is approximately 19.878e-26 J·m.

Denominator: 1.602e-19 times 3.0e4. 1.602 * 3 is 4.806, and the exponents: 1e-19 * 1e4 is 1e-15. So denominator is 4.806e-15 C·V.

Wait, actually, the product eV has units of energy, right? Because voltage times charge gives energy (since V = J/C, so eV is J).

So putting it all together: 19.878e-26 / 4.806e-15 = (19.878 / 4.806) * 1e-11.

Calculating 19.878 divided by 4.806. Let me approximate. 4.8 * 4 is 19.2, and 4.8*4.14 is about 19.87. So 19.878 /4.806 is approximately 4.14.

So lambda_min is roughly 4.14e-11 meters. But wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 4.14e-11 m is 0.414 Angstroms. So the first part's answer is 0.414 A°.

Now the second question: the wavelength of the shortest x-rays produced by a Van de Graaff generator at 5,000,000 volts. Same formula applies here. So lambda_min = hc/(eV), with V now being 5e6 volts.

Let me compute this: numerator is same as before, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator is e*V: 1.602e-19 C *5e6 V = 8.01e-13 J.

So lambda_min is (1.9878e-25) / (8.01e-13) = (1.9878/8.01) * 1e-12. 

1.9878 divided by 8 is about 0.2485. So 0.2485e-12 meters. Wait, 1e-12 meters is 1 picometer, and since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm or 1e-10 m, 0.2485e-12 m is 2.485e-13 m, which is 0.2485 Angstroms? Wait no, because 1e-10 m is 1 A°, so 2.485e-13 m is 0.2485 A°, which is 2.485e-3 A°, right? Because 1e-3 A° is 1e-13 m.

Wait, wait. I think I made a miscalculation. Let me redo that division.

Wait, lambda = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.602e-19 *5e6) 

So let's compute the denominator first: 1.602e-19 *5e6 = 8.01e-13.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

So 1.9878e-25 / 8.01e-13 = (1.9878 /8.01) * 1e-12.

1.9878/8.01 is approximately 0.248. So 0.248 *1e-12 m. 

But 1e-12 m is 1 picometer, which is 0.1 A°, because 1 A° is 1e-10 m. So 0.248e-12 m is 0.248 *0.1 A°, which is 0.0248 A°? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with exponents.

Wait, 1e-10 m is 1 A°, and 1e-12 is 0.01 A°, right? Because 1e-10 is 1 A°, so 1e-12 is 1e-2 A°, which is 0.01 A°. So 0.248e-12 m is 0.248 * 0.01 A°, which is 0.00248 A°, or 2.48e-3 A°.

Wait, wait a second, maybe I should have kept it in terms of Angstroms from the start.

Wait, 0.248e-12 m is 0.248 * 1e-12 m. Since 1e-10 m is 1 A°, 1e-12 is 0.01 A°, so 0.248e-12 is 0.248 *0.01 = 0.00248 A°, which is 2.48e-3 A°.

So the second answer is approximately 2.48e-3 A°.

Now looking at the options. Let's see:

Option E: 0.414 A° and 2.48e-3 A°. That matches our calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the options:

Looking back:

Option E: 0.414 A degree and 2.48 x 10^-3 A degree.

Yes. So the correct answers are 0.414 Angstroms and 2.48e-3 Angstroms.

So the correct option is E.

To determine the correct answers, we calculate the short-wavelength limit of the continuous x-ray spectrum for two scenarios using the formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{hc}{eV}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (charge of an electron),
- \( V \) is the voltage.

- Voltage: \( V = 5.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{V} \),
- Numerator: \( hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m} \),
- Denominator: \( eV = (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \times (5.0 \times 10^6) = 8.01 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \),
- \( \lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{8.01 \times 10^{-13}} = 2.48 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Å} \).
