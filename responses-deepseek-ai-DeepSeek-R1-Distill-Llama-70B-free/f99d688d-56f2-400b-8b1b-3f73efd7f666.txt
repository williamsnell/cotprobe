Question:

An avid stamp collector had amassed a large and valuable collection. Many of his stamps were extremely rare and highly coveted. On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. "The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed "$75,000," instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?

Options:

A: The price term is $78,000, and it is unenforceable due to the secretary's mistake.
B: The price term is $75,000, and the cousin must pay an additional $3,000 due to the secretary's error.
C: The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.
D: The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.
E: The price term is $75,000, but the court may adjust the price to $78,000 if the cousin knew of the mistake.
F: The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.
G: The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.
H: The price term is $75,000, but the collector can demand the correct price of $78,000 due to the secretary's error.
I: The price term is $78,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because the collector signed the contract without noticing the mistaken price.
J: The price term is $78,000, but the court will reform the price to $75,000, because of the secretary's mistake.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, it's about contract law, specifically mistake in the terms of a contract. I remember that mistake can sometimes make a contract voidable or unenforceable, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So, the scenario is that a stamp collector wants to sell his collection. He dictates a letter to his secretary, saying he'll sell it for $78,000, but the secretary types $75,000 by mistake. The collector signs the letter without noticing the error. The cousin receives the letter and accepts the offer. Now, the question is about the price term and its legal effect.

First, I need to figure out what the offer actually was. The collector intended to offer it for $78k, but the written offer says $75k. So, the question is whether the offer is $75k or $78k, and whether the contract is enforceable at that price.

I think the general rule is that the offer is what is communicated, not what the offeror intended. So, even though the collector meant $78k, the written offer is $75k. So, the cousin would have accepted $75k, which is the terms of the contract.

Wait, but sometimes there's the issue of mistake. If the mistake is in the transcription, like a clerical error, and the offeree knows about it, maybe the contract can be reformed. But in this case, the cousin didn't know about the mistake, right? Because the collector didn't notice it when he signed, and the cousin just received the letter.

So, under the doctrine of mistake, if the mistake is unilateral, meaning only one party is mistaken, and the other party doesn't know about it, then the contract is still enforceable as written. Because the acceptor (cousin) didn't know there was a mistake, they accepted the offer as written.

So, the price term would be $75,000, and it's enforceable. The collector can't now demand $78k because the contract was formed at $75k.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the price is $75k and it's enforceable. That seems to fit.

Option E suggests the court might adjust the price if the cousin knew, but the cousin didn't know, so that's not applicable.

Options F and J talk about reformation, but I think reformation requires that the mistake was known to both parties, or that the non-mistaken party was at fault. Since the cousin didn't know, I don't think reformation applies.

So, the correct answer should be G.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically addressing the issue of mistake in the terms of a contract. The collector intended to offer his stamp collection for $78,000 but, due to a clerical error by his secretary, the written offer stated $75,000. The collector signed the letter without noticing the mistake, and the cousin accepted the offer as written.

Under contract law, the enforceability of the contract depends on the terms as communicated, not the offeror's undisclosed intentions. Here, the offer was $75,000, as that was the price stated in the letter. The cousin accepted this offer without knowledge of the collector's intended price of $78,000. Since the mistake was unilateral (only the collector was aware of it) and the cousin had no knowledge of the error, the contract is enforceable as written.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G**: Correct. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable. The contract is valid as the cousin accepted the offer based on the terms provided, without knowledge of the mistake.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The court would not adjust the price to $78,000 because the cousin had no knowledge of the mistake.
- **Options F and J**: Incorrect. Reformation of the contract requires mutual knowledge of the mistake or fault by the non-mistaken party, neither of which applies here.
- Other options either misstate the price term or incorrectly suggest unenforceability or the ability to rescind the contract.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.**

Answer: G
