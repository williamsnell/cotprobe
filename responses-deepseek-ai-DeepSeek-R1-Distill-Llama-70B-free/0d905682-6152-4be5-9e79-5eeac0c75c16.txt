Question:

A city resident commuted to work each day by subway. After purchasing her subway ticket, the resident entered the subway for her ride downtown to where she was employed. Looking for a seat, the resident was walking toward the rear of the subway car when it came to an abrupt halt. As a result of the sudden stop, the resident fell onto a commuter, injuring him. If the commuter asserts a claim against the subway company to recover for his personal injuries, the commuter will probably

Options:

A: not prevail, if the subway company can prove that the stop was necessary to avoid a collision
B: prevail, because the sudden stop caused the resident to fall onto him.
C: not prevail, if the resident can prove she was pushed causing her to fall onto the commuter.
D: prevail, because a special duty of care was owed him.
E: not prevail, if the commuter had prior knowledge of the subway's abrupt stops
F: not prevail, if the resident was negligent in not holding onto the hand rail.
G: prevail, if the subway company was negligent in maintaining the subway car's balance
H: prevail, if the subway company failed to warn passengers about the abrupt stop
I: prevail, if the subway company failed to provide enough seats for all passengers
J: not prevail, if the operator of the subway was not negligent in making the stop.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically negligence. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a commuter who gets injured when another subway rider falls on him due to a sudden stop. He's suing the subway company. The question is whether he'll prevail, and the options are A through J.

First, I need to understand the elements of negligence. For the commuter to win, he must show that the subway company owed him a duty of care, breached that duty, which caused his injury, and that the injury resulted in actual damages.

In this case, the subway company is a common carrier, which generally owes a high duty of care to its passengers. They're expected to exercise a higher degree of care than ordinary care, like in most negligence cases.

Now, the subway made an abrupt stop, causing the resident to fall onto the commuter. The key here is why the stop happened. If the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, that might mean the subway operator acted reasonably under the circumstances. So the company might not be negligent if they can prove the stop was necessary and done in a non-negligent way.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the commuter won't prevail if the stop was necessary to avoid a collision. That makes sense because if the company took reasonable action, there's no breach of duty.

Option B says he'll prevail just because the sudden stop caused the fall. But that's too simplistic. It depends on whether the stop was reasonable.

Option C talks about the resident being pushed. If she was pushed, maybe her own negligence comes into play, but the claim is against the subway company, not the resident. So this might relate to vicarious liability, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option D mentions a special duty of care. Well, as a common carrier, that's true, but the key is whether they breached it. So the outcome depends on the reason for the stop.

Option E says prior knowledge of abrupt stops. If the commuter knew about such stops, maybe he assumed the risk, but I'm not sure if that applies here. The subway's duty is ongoing, so prior knowledge might not necessarily bar recovery unless it's a clear assumption of risk, which might be a stretch.

Option F is about the resident's negligence in not holding the handrail. If the resident was negligent, maybe she's liable, but the commuter is suing the subway company, so his claim depends on the company's negligence, not the resident's.

Option G talks about maintaining balance. If the subway was negligently maintained, that could be a breach. But the question is more about the stop, not the maintenance.

Option H is about failure to warn. If the company didn't warn about the stop, but the stop itself was necessary, then the warning might not be the issue. The abruptness of the stop is the main point.

Option I is about providing enough seats. Not sure how that ties in directly. The issue is the sudden stop, not the seating.

Option J says the commuter won't prevail if the operator wasn't negligent. That aligns with the negligence standard. If the stop was necessary and done without negligence, then the company isn't liable.

So, the main issue is whether the subway company was negligent in making the stop. If the stop was necessary (like to avoid a collision) and done in a non-negligent way, then the company isn't liable. So options A and J seem relevant.

Option A says the company can prove the stop was necessary to avoid collision. So if that's the case, no breach, so commuter doesn't prevail.

Option J says if the operator wasn't negligent, commuter doesn't prevail. So both A and J are about the absence of negligence by the company.

But wait, the question is about the commuter suing the subway company. So the subway's possible defense is that the operator acted reasonably, hence no negligence.

Looking again, option J says "if the operator was not negligent in making the stop." So if the stop was made without negligence, the commuter won't prevail. That seems correct.

But option A says the stop was necessary to avoid collision. That would imply the stop was reasonable, so no negligence. So both A and J could be correct, but I need to see which is more precise.

Wait, the options are about the commuter's claim. For the commuter to prevail, the subway must have been negligent. So if the stop was necessary and done correctly, no negligence, commuter loses.

So the correct answer should be either A or J. Let me think about the standard for common carriers. They are held to a higher standard, so even if the stop was necessary, if it was done in a way that's beyond what a reasonable common carrier would do, it could be negligent. But if the stop was necessary and done properly, then no breach.

So, the subway company would have a defense if they can show that the stop was necessary and that they handled it without negligence.

So, option J says the commuter won't prevail if the operator wasn't negligent. That seems to capture the essence. Because if the operator wasn't negligent, there's no breach of duty.

So, between A and J, J seems more accurate because it's about the operator's negligence, not just the necessity of the stop. Because even a necessary stop could be done negligently, but if it's done correctly, then no liability.

Therefore, the answer should be J.

The commuterâ€™s claim against the subway company hinges on whether the company was negligent. For the commuter to prevail, he must show that the subway company breached its duty of care, which caused his injury. As a common carrier, the subway company owes a high duty of care to its passengers. However, if the abrupt stop was necessary to avoid a collision and was executed without negligence, the company would not be liable.

Option A suggests that the commuter will not prevail if the stop was necessary to avoid a collision. This is relevant because a necessary stop, if performed reasonably, would not constitute negligence. However, Option J is more precise, as it focuses on whether the operator was negligent in making the stop. If the operator acted without negligence, the commuter cannot prevail, regardless of the necessity of the stop.

Thus, the correct answer is the one that directly addresses the absence of negligence by the operator, making Option J the most accurate.

Answer: J
