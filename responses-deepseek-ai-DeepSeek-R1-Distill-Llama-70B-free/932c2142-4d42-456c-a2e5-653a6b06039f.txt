Question:

Why is a moss plant restricted to a height of less thanabout 15 cm?

Options:

A: Moss plants lack photosynthetic capabilities
B: Inefficiency of the rhizoids in absorbing water and minerals and the absence of True vascular and supporting tissues restricts a moss plant to a height of less than 15 cm
C: Moss plants cannot reproduce effectively
D: Moss plants are typically consumed by herbivores
E: Moss plants have a genetic predisposition to remain short
F: Moss plants can only grow in aquatic environments, limiting their height
G: Moss plants are prone to being outcompeted by taller plants for sunlight
H: Moss plants have a slow growth rate that prevents them from growing taller than 15 cm
I: Moss plants release chemicals into the soil that inhibit vertical growth
J: The structure of moss leaves cannot support a larger plant body

Okay, so I've got this question about why moss plants are usually less than 15 cm tall. Hmm, I remember that mosses are non-vascular plants, which means they don't have the same kind of transport tissues like xylem and phloem that other plants have. Wait, what's the significance of that? Oh right, vascular tissues help in transporting water and nutrients, and also provide structural support.

So without those tissues, mosses can't really grow very tall. Because they rely on diffusion for water and nutrients, right? That's probably inefficient. So the rhizoids, which are like the root-like structures, aren't as effective as true roots. They can't absorb enough water and minerals to support a taller plant.

Also, without vascular tissues, the plant can't transport water and nutrients efficiently over longer distances. That would limit the height because the upper parts wouldn't get enough water and nutrients. Plus, the structure of the plant might not be rigid enough to support taller growth without the supporting tissues.

Looking at the options, option B says the inefficiency of rhizoids and the absence of true vascular and supporting tissues restrict their height. That makes sense. Other options don't seem right. Like option A says mosses lack photosynthetic capabilitiesâ€”that's not true because they have chlorophyll and do photosynthesize. Option C is about reproduction, but I don't think that's the main reason for height restriction. Option G is about competition, but that's more about why they grow in certain environments, not their inherent growth limits.

So the answer should be B.

The height of moss plants is limited by their lack of vascular tissues (xylem and phloem), which are essential for efficient water and nutrient transport, and by the inefficiency of their rhizoids in absorption. Without these structures, mosses cannot support taller growth. 

Answer: B
