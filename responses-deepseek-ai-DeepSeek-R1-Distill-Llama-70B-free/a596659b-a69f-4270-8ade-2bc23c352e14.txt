Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an electron orbiting a proton. We need to compare the electrostatic and gravitational forces between them. Then, calculate the speed of the electron and the period of its orbit. The options are A to J, each with different values.

Wait, but the question actually says to calculate the speed and the period, and the options include three numbers each. So I guess the first part was about comparing forces, but the actual task is to compute the speed and period.

Hmm. So the given data is:
- Charge of electron, e = -1.60e-19 C. But since it's the magnitude, I'll consider 1.60e-19 C for both proton and electron (they have equal and opposite charges).
- Radius R = 5.5e-11 meters.
- Mass of electron, m_e = 9.11e-31 kg.
- Mass of proton, m_p = 1.67e-27 kg.

I need to find the speed of the electron and the orbital period. 

I remember from physics that the centripetal force required for circular motion is provided by the electrostatic force here. So the formula would involve equating Coulomb's law to the centripetal force.

Coulomb's law: F_electric = (k * e^2) / R². Wait, because both charges are equal and opposite, the force is attractive, but the magnitude would be k*(e)(e)/(R²) = k e² / R².

Centripetal force is F_centripetal = m_e * v² / R.

Since these forces balance each other:
k e² / R² = m_e v² / R.

Let me write that equation again:

k (e^2) / R² = (m_e v²) / R.

Let me solve for v. Multiply both sides by R²:

k e² = m_e v² R.

Then, solving for v²:

v² = (k e²) / (m_e R).

So v = sqrt( (k e²) / (m_e R) ).

Wait, what's the value of k? Coulomb's constant is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². I remember that number.

So plugging in the numbers:

e = 1.6e-19 C,
R = 5.5e-11 m,
m_e = 9.11e-31 kg,
k = 8.988e9.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k e² = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2 first: (1.6)^2 = 2.56, and (1e-19)^2 is 1e-38. So 2.56e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = (8.988 * 2.56) * 1e9-38 = let me compute that.

8.988 * 2.56: 8 *2.56 is ~20.48, 0.988*2.56 ≈ 2.53, so total around 22.5?

Wait, exact calculation:

2.56 × 8 is 20.48; 0.988 × 2.56:

0.988 * 2 = 1.976, 0.988 * 0.56 = approx 0.553 (0.988 *0.5 is 0.494, 0.988 *0.06 is 0.059, so 0.494 + 0.059=0.553). So total 1.976 + 0.553 = 2.529.

So 20.48 + 2.529 = 23.009.

So 23.009e(9-38) → 23.009e-29 → 2.3009e-28 (since 23 is 2.3e1). So approximately 2.3e-28 (N·m²/C² * C²) → N·m²? Wait no, the units aside, but the calculation is correct.

Wait, wait. The numerator is k e², so 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Let me compute it more accurately.

First, 1.6e-19 squared is 2.56e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:

8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = (8.988 * 2.56) * 1e9 * 1e-38 = (22.96) * 1e-29 = 2.296e-28.

So numerator is 2.296e-28.

Denominator is m_e * R = 9.11e-31 kg * 5.5e-11 m.

Compute that:

9.11e-31 *5.5e-11 = (9.11 *5.5) * 1e-42.

9.11 *5.5: 9 *5=45, 0.11*5=0.55, 9*0.5=4.5, 0.11*0.5=0.055. So 45 +0.55 +4.5 +0.055=50.105.

Wait, perhaps a simpler way: 9.11 *5 =45.55; 9.11 *0.5=4.555. So 45.55 +4.555=50.105.

So 50.105e-42 → 5.0105e-41.

So denominator is 5.0105e-41.

So v² = (2.296e-28) / (5.0105e-41) ) → (2.296 / 5.0105) * 1e13.

2.296 /5.0105 is approximately 0.4585.

So v² ≈ 0.4585e13 → 4.585e12.

Take square root: v ≈ sqrt(4.585e12) m²/s² → sqrt(4.585e12) = sqrt(4.585) * 1e6.

sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(4.585)= approx 2.14.

So v ≈ 2.14e6 m/s.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

v² = (k e²) / ( m_e R )

So compute 2.296e-28 / 5.0105e-41.

2.296e-28 /5.0105e-41 = (2.296 /5.0105) * 1e13.

2.296 /5.0105 → Let me compute that division.

5.0105 goes into 2.296 how many times? Since 5 is bigger than 2.296, it's 0.458 times (as before).

So v² ≈ 0.4585e13 → which is 4.585e12.

v = sqrt(4.585e12) = sqrt(4.585) * 1e6.

Compute sqrt(4.585): sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(4.84)=2.2. Let me compute it better.

4.585 is between 4.41 (2.1^2) and 4.84 (2.2^2). Let's see:

2.14^2 = (2 +0.14)^2 = 4 + 0.56 + 0.0196 = 4.5796.

Oh wait, that's about 4.5796, which is very close to 4.585. So 2.14^2 ≈4.5796, which is just 0.0054 less than 4.585.

So sqrt(4.585) ≈ 2.14 + (0.0054)/(2*2.14) → using linear approximation.

Difference is 0.0054, and the derivative of sqrt(x) at x=4.5796 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) ) → 1/(2*2.14) )= 1/(4.28) ≈0.2336.

So delta x is 0.0054, so delta v ≈0.2336 *0.0054 ≈0.00126.

So sqrt(4.585)=approx 2.14 + 0.00126 ≈2.14126 → ~2.1413e6 m/s.

So v≈2.141e6 m/s, about 2.14e6 m/s.

Looking at the options, let's see which one has a speed around 2.1e6.

Option A: 1.9e6 → No.

B:1.7e6 → No.

C: 2.8e6 → Higher.

D: 1.5e6.

E:1.1e6.

F:2.1e6 → Yes, 2.1e6.

H:2.5e6.

I:2.2e6.

So options F, I, and H have speeds around 2.1-2.5e6.

Wait, my calculation is about 2.14e6, so maybe option I (2.2e6) is a bit higher, but perhaps I made an approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me recalculate v².

v² = (k e²) / (m_e R )

So plugging in exact numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

e=1.6e-19 C,

m_e=9.11e-31 kg,

R=5.5e-11 m.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = (8.988 * 2.56) * 1e9-38.

8.988 * 2.56:

Calculate 8 *2.56 = 20.48,

0.988 *2.56 = let's compute 1 *2.56=2.56, subtract 0.012*2.56=0.03072 → 2.56 -0.03072=2.52928.

So 20.48 +2.52928=22.00928 → 22.00928e9-38 = 2.200928e-28.

So numerator is 2.200928e-28.

Denominator: m_e * R =9.11e-31 *5.5e-11 = (9.11 *5.5 )e-42.

9.11 *5.5 → 9 *5=45, 9 *0.5=4.5 → 49.5, then 0.11 *5.5=0.605. So 49.5 +0.605=50.105.

So denominator is 50.105e-42 =5.0105e-41.

Thus, v² = numerator / denominator = (2.200928e-28) / (5.0105e-41) ) = (2.200928 /5.0105 )e^( -28 +41 ) = (0.4389) * 1e13 = 4.389e12.

So v² =4.389e12 → v= sqrt(4.389e12 ) = sqrt(4.389) *1e6.

What's sqrt(4.389)? Let's compute this accurately.

We know 2.09^2 = (2 +0.09)^2 =4 + 0.36 +0.0081=4.3681.

2.10^2 =4.41.

So 4.389 is between 2.09^2 and 2.10^2.

Compute 2.09^2 =4.3681.

4.389 -4.3681=0.0209.

The difference between 4.41 and 4.3681 is 0.0419.

So 0.0209/0.0419 ≈0.5. So sqrt(4.389) ≈2.09 + 0.5*(0.01) → 2.095.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The steps between 2.09 and 2.10 are 0.01 in x, leading to 0.0419 increase in x².

We need to find x where x=2.09 + delta, such that (2.09 + delta)^2 =4.389.

We've established that 2.09^2 =4.3681.

So 4.389-4.3681=0.0209.

The derivative of x² is 2x. At x=2.09, it's 4.18.

So using linear approximation:

delta ≈ (0.0209) / (2 *2.09) ) → 0.0209 /4.18 ≈0.005.

So delta is approximately 0.005.

So x≈2.09 +0.005=2.095.

So sqrt(4.389)=2.095.

Thus, v≈2.095e6 m/s → ~2.10e6 m/s.

Looking back at the options, option F has speed 2.1e6 m/s. So that's a match.

Next, compute the period T.

The period is the time for one orbit. The circumference is 2πR, and the speed is v, so T= (2π R) / v.

We have R=5.5e-11 m, v≈2.095e6 m/s.

Compute 2π R = 2 *3.1416 *5.5e-11.

2 *3.1416≈6.2832.

6.2832 *5.5e-11 = (6.2832 *5.5) *1e-11.

6.2832 *5=31.416, 6.2832*0.5=3.1416. So total 34.5578e-11 m →3.45578e-10 m.

So 2π R =3.45578e-10 m.

v is 2.095e6 m/s.

So T=3.45578e-10 / 2.095e6.

Compute that division.

3.45578e-10 / 2.095e6 = (3.45578 /2.095 ) * 1e-16.

3.45578 /2.095 → Let's compute that.

2.095 *1.65= 2.095 *1=2.095; 2.095 *0.6=1.257; 2.095 *0.05=0.10475. So 2.095 +1.257=3.352 +0.10475=3.45675.

Wait, that's almost exactly 3.45675, which is very close to 3.45578.

So 1.65 *2.095 =3.45675, which is a bit higher than 3.45578.

So 3.45578 /2.095 ≈1.65 - (3.45675-3.45578)/2.095 → delta is 0.00097.

Wait, 3.45675 -3.45578=0.00097.

So (0.00097)/(2.095)≈0.000463.

So 1.65 -0.000463≈1.6495.

So approximately 1.6495.

So T =1.6495e-16 seconds.

Looking at the options, let's see which have T around 1.64e-16.

Option F: period 1.64e-16 → which matches.

So option F's speed is 2.1e6 m/s, period 1.64e-16 s.

Looking back, option F is:

F: 2.26 × 10^39, 2.1 × 10^6 m/sec, 1.64 × 10-16 sec.

Wait, but the first number is 2.26e39. Wait, what's that? The question said to compare the electrostatic and gravitational forces. Oh, right, the first part of the question.

Oh wait, I didn't compute the forces yet. Oh, but the user's question is to calculate the speed and period, but the options include three numbers each, so perhaps the first number is the ratio of the forces, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says: Compare the electrostatic and gravitational forces between the two. Then, calculate the speed and period.

So perhaps the first part is the ratio of F_electric to F_gravity. Let's compute that.

F_electric = (k e²)/R².

F_gravity = G (m_e m_p)/R².

So the ratio F_electric / F_gravity = [ (k e²) / R² ] / [ G m_e m_p / R² ] ) = (k e²) / (G m_e m_p ).

Compute that ratio. Let's plug in the numbers.

k =8.988e9 N m²/C²,

e=1.6e-19 C,

G=6.674e-11 N m²/kg²,

m_e=9.11e-31 kg,

m_p=1.67e-27 kg.

So (k e²) / ( G m_e m_p )

Compute numerator: k e² =8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 = 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = 2.299e-28 (as before).

Denominator: G m_e m_p =6.674e-11 *9.11e-31 *1.67e-27.

Compute denominator:

Compute 9.11e-31 *1.67e-27 = (9.11 *1.67) *1e-58.

9.11 *1.67 → let's compute 9 *1.67=15.03, 0.11 *1.67≈0.1837 → total 15.2137.

So 15.2137e-58 =1.52137e-57.

Multiply by G=6.674e-11:

6.674e-11 *1.52137e-57 = (6
