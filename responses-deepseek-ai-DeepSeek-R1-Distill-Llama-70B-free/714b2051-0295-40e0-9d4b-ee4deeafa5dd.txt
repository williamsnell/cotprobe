Okay, so I've got this question about finding absolute zero using the densities of air at different temperatures. Hmm, I remember that absolute zero is the temperature at which gases would theoretically have zero volume, right? But wait, the question says to assume that air obeys Charles's law. Wait, Charles's law is about volume and temperature, but here we're dealing with density. Oh right, density is mass per volume. So if the volume changes, the density would change inversely, assuming mass is constant.

Charles's law states that V ∝ T when pressure is constant. So V = kT, where T is the absolute temperature. But since density ρ is mass over volume (ρ = m/V), then ρ would be inversely proportional to T. So ρ = m/(kT) → ρ ∝ 1/T. Wait, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of pressure too, but the problem says to assume Charles's law, which is at constant pressure. So yes, pressure is constant here.

So if I take the density data, I can plot density versus temperature (in Celsius) and see where the line extrapolates to zero. Because at absolute zero, the volume would be zero, so density would approach infinity? Wait no, wait. If V approaches zero, then density (mass/volume) would approach infinity. But maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, since ρ ∝ 1/T, when T approaches zero (absolute zero), ρ would go to infinity. Hmm, but how does that help me?

Wait, wait, wait. Maybe I should think of it as 1/ρ being proportional to T. Because if ρ = m/V, and V = kT, then ρ = m/(kT) → 1/ρ = (kT)/m → so 1/ρ is proportional to T. Oh right, because for a fixed mass m and constant k (since pressure is constant), 1/ρ would be proportional to T.

So if I plot 1/ρ against T (in Celsius), the line should extrapolate to zero at absolute zero. Because absolute zero is when T is zero in Kelvin, which is -273°C. So I can use two of the data points to find the equation of the line, and see where it crosses zero.

Let me pick two points. Let's take 0°C and 100°C.

At 0°C, the density is 1.294 g/dm³. So 1/1.294 ≈ 0.773 dm³/g.

At 100°C, the density is 0.946 g/dm³. So 1/0.946 ≈ 1.057 dm³/g.

Assuming T in Celsius, so for 0°C, T=273 K, but wait, wait, no. Oh wait, in Charles's law, T is in Kelvin. But the given temperatures are in Celsius. So I need to convert them to Kelvin. Wait, but wait, the question is about extrapolating to find absolute zero, which is at 0 K or -273°C. So perhaps I should treat T as in Celsius but with an offset.

Wait, perhaps I can model the relationship as 1/ρ = a*T + b, where T is in Celsius. Then, when 1/ρ = 0, T would be absolute zero. Wait no, because when T is absolute zero, 1/ρ would be zero only if the line extrapolates to zero. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let me think of it as a linear relationship. So 1/ρ = m*T + c, where T is in Celsius. We can find m and c using two data points, then find when 1/ρ = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Because when T is absolute zero (T=0 K = -273°C), 1/ρ would be zero, because V would be zero, so 1/ρ = (V/m) → (0)/m = 0. So when 1/ρ is zero, that corresponds to T=0 K. So to find when 1/ρ is zero, we can set up the equation and solve for T.

Let me take the two points again.

Point 1: T1 = 0°C, which is 273 K. 1/ρ1 = 1/1.294 ≈ 0.773 dm³/g.

Point 2: T2 = 100°C, which is 373 K. 1/ρ2 = 1/0.946 ≈ 1.057 dm³/g.

So the slope (m) would be (1.057 - 0.773) / (373-273) = (0.284)/(100) = 0.00284 dm³/(g·K).

Wait, but since I'm using T in Celsius, the difference in T is 100°C, which is 100 K. But wait, in terms of the equation, when T is in Celsius, the slope would be 0.284 / 100 = 0.00284 dm³/(g·°C).

Wait, but maybe I should model it with T as Celsius. Let me write the equation: 1/ρ = m*T + c.

Using point 1: 0.773 = m*(0) + c → c = 0.773.

Using point 2: 1.057 = m*(100) + 0.773 → m = (1.057 - 0.773)/100 = 0.284/100 = 0.00284 dm³/(g·°C).

So the equation is 1/ρ = 0.00284*T + 0.773.

Wait, but wait, in this model, when does 1/ρ = 0? Let's set 0 = 0.00284*T + 0.773 → T = -0.773 / 0.00284 ≈ -272.34 °C. That's very close to -273°C, which is absolute zero, option G.

But wait, let me try another pair of points to check, maybe using -85°C.

Point 3: T3 = -85°C, so T in K is 188 K. 1/ρ3 = 1/1.877 ≈ 0.533 dm³/g.

Let me plug into the equation:

1/ρ = 0.00284*T + 0.773.

So for T = -85°C,

0.00284*(-85) = -0.2414.

Adding 0.773 gives 0.773 - 0.2414 = 0.5316 dm³/g.

Which is very close to the actual 0.533. So that fits pretty well.

So the equation seems accurate.

Thus, when 1/ρ = 0, T ≈ -272.34°C, which is very close to -273°C, which is option G.

So the correct answer is G: -273°C.

To determine the absolute zero of temperature in degrees Celsius using the given data, we assume that air obeys Charles's law. Charles's law states that volume is directly proportional to temperature at constant pressure, i.e., \( V \propto T \). Since density (\( \rho \)) is inversely proportional to volume (\( \rho = \frac{m}{V} \)), it follows that \( \rho \propto \frac{1}{T} \). Therefore, \( \frac{1}{\rho} \propto T \), where \( T \) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Convert the relationship to a linear equation
We can express the relationship as:
\[
\frac{1}{\rho} = mT + c
\]
where \( T \) is the temperature in Celsius, \( m \) is the slope, and \( c \) is the intercept. To find \( m \) and \( c \), we use two data points.

### Step 2: Use two data points to calculate the slope (\( m \)) and intercept (\( c \))
1. At \( T_1 = 0^\circ \mathrm{C} \), \( \rho_1 = 1.294 \, \mathrm{g \, dm^{-3}} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\rho_1} = \frac{1}{1.294} \approx 0.773 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \, g^{-1}}
   \]
2. At \( T_2 = 100^\circ \mathrm{C} \), \( \rho_2 = 0.946 \, \mathrm{g \, dm^{-3}} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\rho_2} = \frac{1}{0.946} \approx 1.057 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \, g^{-1}}
   \]

The slope (\( m \)) is calculated as:
\[
m = \frac{\frac{1}{\rho_2} - \frac{1}{\rho_1}}{T_2 - T_1} = \frac{1.057 - 0.773}{100 - 0} = \frac{0.284}{100} = 0.00284 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \, g^{-1} \, ^\circ C^{-1}}
\]

Using \( T_1 = 0^\circ \mathrm{C} \) and \( \frac{1}{\rho_1} = 0.773 \), the intercept (\( c \)) is:
\[
c = 0.773 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \, g^{-1}}
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\rho} = 0.00284T + 0.773
\]

### Step 3: Extrapolate to find absolute zero
At absolute zero (\( T = 0 \, \mathrm{K} = -273^\circ \mathrm{C} \)), the volume of an ideal gas would be zero, and consequently, \( \frac{1}{\rho} = 0 \). Setting \( \frac{1}{\rho} = 0 \) in the equation:
\[
0 = 0.00284T + 0.773
\]
Solving for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{-0.773}{0.00284} \approx -272.34^\circ \mathrm{C}
\]

This value is very close to \( -273^\circ \mathrm{C} \), which is the widely accepted value for absolute zero.

### Step 4: Verify with a third data point
To confirm the accuracy of the model, we use the data point at \( T_3 = -85^\circ \mathrm{C} \), where \( \rho_3 = 1.877 \, \mathrm{g \, dm^{-3}} \):
\[
\frac{1}{\rho_3} = \frac{1}{1.877} \approx 0.533 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \, g^{-1}}
\]
Substituting \( T_3 = -85^\circ \mathrm{C} \) into the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{\rho} = 0.00284(-85) + 0.773 = -0.2414 + 0.773 = 0.5316 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \, g^{-1}}
\]
This is very close to the actual value of \( 0.533 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \, g^{-1}} \), confirming the model's accuracy.

### Final Answer
The extrapolated value for absolute zero is approximately \( -273^\circ \mathrm{C} \), which corresponds to option **G**.
