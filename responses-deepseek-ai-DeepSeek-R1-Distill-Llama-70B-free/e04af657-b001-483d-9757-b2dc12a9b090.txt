Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to use Stokes' theorem to evaluate the line integral of a vector field around a triangular path. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, let me recall what Stokes' theorem is about. It relates the line integral of a vector field around a closed curve to the surface integral of the curl of that vector field over any surface bounded by the curve. So, the theorem is ∫_C F · dr = ∫∫_S (curl F) · dS. That makes sense because it converts a potentially complicated line integral into a surface integral, which might be easier to compute depending on the situation.

The problem gives me the vector field F = z² i + y² j + x k. The curve C is a triangle with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), and it's oriented counter-clockwise. I need to compute the integral of F · dr around this triangle.

Since I'm using Stokes' theorem, the first thing I should do is compute the curl of F. The curl of a vector field F = (F₁, F₂, F₃) is given by the determinant of a matrix with partial derivatives:

curl F = ( ∂F₃/∂y - ∂F₂/∂z ) i + ( ∂F₁/∂z - ∂F₃/∂x ) j + ( ∂F₂/∂x - ∂F₁/∂y ) k.

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, F₁ is z². So ∂F₁/∂z is 2z, and ∂F₁/∂y is 0 because F₁ doesn't depend on y.

F₂ is y². So ∂F₂/∂x is 0, and ∂F₂/∂z is 0 because F₂ doesn't depend on z.

F₃ is x. So ∂F₃/∂y is 0, and ∂F₃/∂x is 1.

Putting this into the curl formula:

First component (i): ∂F₃/∂y - ∂F₂/∂z = 0 - 0 = 0.

Second component (j): ∂F₁/∂z - ∂F₃/∂x = 2z - 1.

Third component (k): ∂F₂/∂x - ∂F₁/∂y = 0 - 0 = 0.

So curl F = (0) i + (2z - 1) j + (0) k. So the curl is (0, 2z -1, 0).

Next, I need to compute the surface integral of curl F over the surface S bounded by C. The surface S is the triangle lying in some plane. Since the vertices are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), this triangle is in the plane x + y + z = 1, I think. Wait, let me check: plugging in (1,0,0) gives 1, yes. Similarly, others give 1. So equation of the plane is x + y + z = 1.

Wait, no. Wait, if x + y + z = 1, then (1,0,0) satisfies it (1+0+0=1), (0,1,0) same, (0,0,1) same. So yes, the triangle lies on the plane x + y + z = 1.

Now, I need to parameterize this surface. Alternatively, since the surface is a flat triangle, I can consider it as a portion of a plane, and compute the flux integral.

Another approach is to choose a parameterization of the surface. But perhaps it's easier to compute the flux integral using the formula ∫∫ curl F · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface.

Wait, but for a flat surface like this triangle, the normal vector is constant everywhere. So I can compute it once and then proceed.

First, find the normal vector to the plane x + y + z = 1. The coefficients of x, y, z in the plane equation give the normal vector. So the normal vector is (1, 1, 1). But we need to make it a unit vector. The magnitude of (1,1,1) is sqrt(1² +1² +1²) = sqrt(3). So the unit normal n is (1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait. The orientation matters. The curve C is oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above. So I need to ensure that the normal vector is pointing in the right direction. Let me think: if I stand on the surface facing the direction of the normal, the counter-clockwise orientation of C would correspond to the right-hand rule. So the normal vector should point in the direction (1,1,1), which is outward from the origin. So that's correct.

So now, the surface integral becomes the double integral over the triangular region S of (curl F) · n dS.

Since n is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3), and curl F is (0, 2z -1, 0), their dot product is:

[0]*(1/sqrt(3)) + (2z-1)*(1/sqrt(3)) + 0*(1/sqrt(3)) = (2z - 1)/sqrt(3).

So the integral becomes ∫∫_S (2z -1)/sqrt(3) dS.

Since 1/sqrt(3) is a constant, I can factor it out: (1/sqrt(3)) ∫∫ (2z -1) dS.

Now, I need to set up the integral over the surface S, which is the triangle in the plane x + y + z =1.

But integrating over the surface might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to project the surface onto one of the coordinate planes, say the xy-plane, and express z in terms of x and y.

From the plane equation, z = 1 - x - y.

So, the integral becomes ∫∫_D (2(1 - x - y) -1) dx dy, multiplied by (1/sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me write that correctly. The area element dS on the surface S is related to the area element dA in the projection. For a surface z = f(x,y), dS = sqrt( (dz/dx)^2 + (dz/dy)^2 + 1 ) dx dy. But since our surface is a plane, this factor is constant.

Wait, in our case, the surface is a plane, so the factor would be the same everywhere, so I can compute it once.

Wait, more accurately, for a surface given by z = g(x,y), the differential area element dS is sqrt( (g_x)^2 + (g_y)^2 + 1 ) dx dy, where g_x and g_y are partial derivatives. So in our case, since z = 1 - x - y, g_x = -1, g_y = -1. So sqrt( (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1 ) = sqrt(1 +1 +1) = sqrt(3). So dS = sqrt(3) dx dy.

Therefore, ∫∫_S (2z -1) dS = ∫∫_D [2(1 - x - y) -1 ] * sqrt(3) dx dy.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the integrand is (2z -1), and dS is sqrt(3) dx dy. So the integral becomes:

∫∫_D [2(1 - x - y) -1 ] * sqrt(3) dx dy.

Wait, but then the (1/sqrt(3)) factor from earlier comes in. Let me make sure I don't get confused.

Wait, the entire integral is (1/sqrt(3)) times the integral over S of (2z -1) dS.

But dS is sqrt(3) dx dy, so when I substitute, the (1/sqrt(3)) and the sqrt(3) from dS will cancel each other, leaving just the integral of (2z -1) dx dy over D.

Wait, let me double-check that.

So the surface integral is:

∫∫_S (2z -1) (1/sqrt(3)) dS.

But dS = sqrt(3) dx dy, so substituting:

∫∫_D (2z -1) * (1/sqrt(3)) * sqrt(3) dx dy.

The sqrt(3) terms cancel, so we're left with ∫∫_D (2z -1) dx dy.

And since z = 1 - x - y, substituting that in:

2(1 - x - y) -1 = 2 - 2x - 2y -1 = 1 - 2x - 2y.

So the integral becomes ∫∫_D (1 - 2x - 2y) dx dy, where D is the projection of the triangle onto the xy-plane.

Wait, what is D? The projection of the triangle S onto the xy-plane. The original triangle has vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So when we project onto the xy-plane (z=0), the points are (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0,1) would project to (0,0). Wait, no: (0,0,1) projects to (0,0), but wait, the projection of the point (0,0,1) onto the xy-plane is (0,0). So our region D is the triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0). So D is the triangle in the xy-plane bounded by x=0, y=0, and x + y =1.

That makes sense. So D is the region where x ≥0, y ≥0, and x + y ≤1.

Now, I can set up the double integral over D as an iterated integral. Let's choose to integrate in x first, then y. Alternatively, y first then x.

Let me set up the limits. For y between 0 and 1. For a given y, x goes from 0 to (1 - y).

So the integral becomes:

∫ (y=0 to 1) [ ∫ (x=0 to 1 - y) (1 - 2x - 2y) dx ] dy.

Let me compute the inner integral first, integrating with respect to x.

The integral of (1 - 2x - 2y) dx from x=0 to x=1 - y.

Let's compute term by term:

∫ (1) dx = x evaluated from 0 to (1 - y) → (1 - y) - 0 = 1 - y.

∫ (-2x) dx = (-2)(x²/2) ) = -x² evaluated from 0 to (1 - y) → -( (1 - y)^2 ) - 0 = -(1 - 2y + y²).

∫ (-2y) dx = (-2y)(x) evaluated from 0 to (1 - y) → (-2y)(1 - y) - 0 = -2y(1 - y) = -2y + 2y².

Putting it all together:

Inner integral = [1 - y] + [ - (1 - 2y + y²) ] + [ -2y + 2y² ]

Let me compute each term:

1 - y - (1 - 2y + y²) - 2y + 2y²

Expand the negative sign in the second term:

1 - y -1 + 2y - y² -2y + 2y²

Now, combine like terms:

1 -1 = 0.

- y + 2y - 2y = (-y + 2y) is y, minus 2y is -y.

- y² + 2y² = y².

So the inner integral simplifies to (-y + y²).

Wait, wait, let me recheck that step.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

The first term is (1 - y).

The second term is - (1 -2y + y²) → -1 +2y - y².

The third term is (-2y + 2y²).

So, adding all together:

(1 - y) + (-1 + 2y - y²) + (-2y + 2y²).

Combine like terms:

1 -1 = 0.

- y + 2y -2y = (-y) because 2y -2y is 0, so just -y.

Then, - y² + 2y² = y².

So the inner integral becomes (-y + y²).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 1 - y -1 +2y - y² -2y +2y².

Let me compute each term:

1 - y -1 +2y - y² -2y +2y².

Compute the constants: 1 -1 = 0.

Compute the y terms: (-y) + 2y -2y = (-y).

Wait, because (-y + 2y) is y, then y -2y is -y.

The y squared terms: (-y² + 2y²) = y².

So overall, the inner integral is (-y + y²).

Wait, so the inner integral is (-y + y²).

Now, we have to integrate this with respect to y from 0 to 1.

So the outer integral becomes ∫ (from 0 to1) [ (-y + y²) ] dy.

Let me compute this integral.

∫ (-y + y²) dy from 0 to1.

Integrate term by term:

∫ (-y) dy = (-1/2)y² evaluated from 0 to1 → (-1/2)(1)^2 - (-1/2)(0)^2 = -1/2.

∫ y² dy = (1/3)y^3 evaluated from 0 to1 → (1/3)(1)^3 - (1/3)(0)^3 = 1/3.

So the outer integral is (-1/2) + (1/3) = (-3/6 + 2/6) = (-1/6).

Wait, that's the result of the double integral over D. But wait, earlier I thought the surface integral was reduced to just ∫∫_D (1 - 2x -2y) dx dy, which evaluated to (-1/6). So that would be the value of the double integral. But wait, no, because the surface integral was reduced to that after considering the factors from dS and the curl F · n.

Wait, let me recap. The entire surface integral is:

(1/sqrt(3)) ∫∫_S (2z -1) dS.

But then we found that dS = sqrt(3) dx dy, so when substituting, the (1/sqrt(3)) and sqrt(3) cancel, leaving ∫∫_D (2z -1) dx dy, which is ∫∫_D (1 -2x -2y) dx dy. And that integral is (-1/6).

Wait, but the calculation of the double integral gave me (-1/6). So the surface integral is (-1/6), which equals the line integral ∫_C F · dr.

Wait, so then the answer should be -1/6, which is approximately -0.1667.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.166, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Let me double-check the steps.

First, computing the curl of F: F = (z², y², x).

curl F = ( ∂F3/∂y - ∂F2/∂z , ∂F1/∂z - ∂F3/∂x , ∂F2/∂x - ∂F1/∂y )

So:

∂F3/∂y = ∂x/∂y = 0.

∂F2/∂z = ∂(y²)/∂z = 0.

So first component is 0 - 0 = 0.

Second component: ∂F1/∂z = ∂(z²)/∂z = 2z.

∂F3/∂x = ∂x/∂x = 1.

So second component is 2z -1.

Third component: ∂F2/∂x = ∂(y²)/∂x = 0.

∂F1/∂y = ∂(z²)/∂y = 0.

So third component is 0 - 0 = 0.

So curl F = (0, 2z -1, 0). That's correct.

Then, the normal vector to the surface. The plane equation is x + y + z =1, so normal vector is (1,1,1). Unit normal is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3). Correct.

Then, the dot product of curl F and n is (0,2z-1,0) · (1,1,1)/sqrt(3) = (2z-1)/sqrt(3). Correct.

Then, the surface integral becomes ∫∫ (2z -1)/sqrt(3) dS.

Then, because dS = sqrt(3) dx dy, the integral becomes ∫∫ (2z -1) dx dy over D.

But z is 1 -x -y, so substituting, 2(1 -x -y) -1 = 2 -2x -2y -1 = 1 -2x -2y. Correct.

Then, the double integral over D of (1 -2x -2y) dx dy.

The limits for D are correct: x from 0 to 1-y, y from 0 to1.

Inner integral ∫ (1-2x -2y) dx from 0 to 1 -y.

Computed correctly to (-y + y²). Then the outer integral ∫ (-y + y²) dy from 0 to1 gives (-1/2 +1/3) = -1/6. So the surface integral is -
