Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry has always been a bit tricky for me. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about determining the volume in milliliters of 0.20 M KMnO4 required to oxidize 25.0 mL of 0.40 M FeSO4 in acidic solution. The reaction given is the oxidation of Fe²+ by MnO4^- to produce Fe³+ and Mn²+. 

Alright, I remember that KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. FeSO4 is ferrous sulfate, which means Fe²+ ions. So the Fe²+ is being oxidized to Fe³+, and the MnO4^- is getting reduced to Mn²+. 

So, first, I need to write the balanced redox reaction to figure out the mole ratio between KMnO4 and FeSO4. Let's break it into two half-reactions.

The oxidation half-reaction is Fe²+ → Fe³+. Since each Fe²+ loses one electron, that's straightforward. So the oxidation half-reaction is:

Fe²+ → Fe³+ + e^-

Wait, no, wait. Wait, oxidation is loss of electrons. So Fe²+ loses an electron to become Fe³+. So the equation is Fe²+ → Fe³+ + e^-. That's correct.

Now the reduction half-reaction. MnO4^- → Mn²+. In acidic solution, so I'll have to balance oxygen with water and H+.

MnO4^- → Mn²+ 

Step 1: Balance Mn. There's one Mn on each side, so that's done.

Step 2: Balance oxygen by adding H2O. There are 4 O on the left, so add 4 H2O on the right.

MnO4^- → Mn²+ + 4 H2O

Step 3: Balance H by adding H+ to the other side. Each H2O has 2 H, so 4 H2O gives 8 H on the right. So add 8 H+ to the left.

MnO4^- + 8 H+ → Mn²+ + 4 H2O

Step 4: Balance the charge by adding electrons. Let's see the charges on each side.

Left side: MnO4^- has charge -1, 8 H+ is +8. So total is +7.

Right side: Mn²+ is +2, 4 H2O is neutral. So total is +2.

So to balance the charges, the left is +7, the right is +2. So a difference of 5 electrons. Since it's reduction, electrons are added to the left.

So adding 5 electrons to the left:

MnO4^- + 8 H+ + 5 e^- → Mn²+ + 4 H2O

That's the balanced reduction half-reaction.

Now, for the overall reaction, we need to combine the oxidation and reduction half-reactions. The oxidation is Fe²+ → Fe³+ + e^-, and the reduction involves 5 electrons.

So I'll multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 5 so that the electrons can cancel out.

5 Fe²+ → 5 Fe³+ + 5 e^-

Adding the two half-reactions:

5 Fe²+ + MnO4^- + 8 H+ + 5 e^- → 5 Fe³+ + 5 e^- + Mn²+ + 4 H2O

The 5 e^- on both sides cancel out.

So the overall balanced equation is:

5 Fe²+ + MnO4^- + 8 H+ → 5 Fe³+ + Mn²+ + 4 H2O

Wait, but wait. When I add the two, the H+ is on the same side as the MnO4^- and Fe²+. Let me make sure I did that right.

Yes, the reduction half-reaction is MnO4^- + 8 H+ +5 e^- → Mn²+ + 4 H2O.

The oxidation is 5 Fe²+ → 5 Fe³+ + 5 e^-.

So when you add them, the electrons cancel, and you get:

MnO4^- + 8 H+ +5 Fe²+ → Mn²+ + 4 H2O +5 Fe³+

Yes, that's correct.

So from the balanced equation, the mole ratio between Fe²+ and MnO4^- is 5:1. That is, 5 moles of Fe²+ react with 1 mole of MnO4^-.

Wait, wait, no. Let me check. The equation shows 5 Fe²+ reacting with one MnO4^-. So for every 1 mole of KMnO4, 5 moles of FeSO4 are needed.

Because FeSO4 dissociates into Fe²+ and SO4^2-. So each mole of FeSO4 gives one mole of Fe²+. So the mole ratio is 5 FeSO4 to 1 KMnO4.

Wait, no. Wait, the stoichiometric ratio is 5 Fe²+ : 1 MnO4^-.

So, for every 1 mole of KMnO4 consumed, 5 moles of FeSO4 are consumed.

So the mole ratio of FeSO4 to KMnO4 is 5:1.

Now, moving on to the problem. The given data is:

Volume of FeSO4 = 25.0 mL = 0.025 L.

Concentration of FeSO4 = 0.40 M. So moles of FeSO4 = Molarity × Volume = 0.40 mol/L × 0.025 L = 0.010 mol.

Since the mole ratio is 5 FeSO4 to 1 KMnO4, the moles of KMnO4 needed are 0.010 mol /5 = 0.002 mol.

Wait, no. Wait, because 5 Fe²+ come from 5 FeSO4, so 5 FeSO4 → 5 Fe²+. So 1 mole of KMnO4 needs 5 moles of FeSO4.

Wait, no, the balanced equation is 5 Fe²+ + MnO4^- + 8 H+ → 5 Fe³+ + Mn²+ + 4 H2O.

So for 1 mole of KMnO4, you need 5 moles of Fe²+, which come from 5 moles of FeSO4. So the moles of FeSO4 would be 5 times the moles of KMnO4.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The moles of FeSO4 is 0.40 M * 0.025 L = 0.010 mol. Each FeSO4 gives one Fe²+.

The balanced equation says 5 Fe²+ react with 1 MnO4^-. So the moles of MnO4^- needed would be moles of Fe²+ divided by 5.

So moles of Fe²+ is 0.010 mol.

Moles of MnO4^- = 0.010 / 5 = 0.002 mol.

Now, KMnO4 dissociates into K+ and MnO4^- ions. So 1 mole of KMnO4 gives 1 mole of MnO4^-.

So the concentration of KMnO4 is 0.20 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration.

Volume (in liters) = 0.002 mol / 0.20 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps.

1. Find moles of FeSO4: 0.40 M * 0.025 L = 0.01 mol FeSO4 → 0.01 mol Fe²+.

2. From the balanced equation, 5 Fe²+ → 1 MnO4^-. So moles of MnO4^- needed = 0.01 /5 = 0.002 mol.

3. KMnO4 concentration is 0.20 M. So volume = 0.002 / 0.20 = 0.01 L → 10 mL.

Looking at the options, option I is 10 mL. So the answer should be I.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't confuse the ratio. Because sometimes it's easy to mix up which one is which.

Another way to look at it is to write the mole ratio as FeSO4 : KMnO4 = 5 :1. So for every 1 mole KMnO4, you need 5 of FeSO4.

In this case, moles of FeSO4 are 0.01, so moles of KMnO4 = 0.01 /5 = 0.002. So yes, same as before.

So volume of KMnO4 is 0.002 / 0.20 = 0.01 L =10 mL.

So the correct answer is option I:10 mL.

To determine the volume of 0.20 M KMnO₄ required to oxidize 25.0 mL of 0.40 M FeSO₄ in acidic solution, we first write the balanced redox reaction:

\[
5 \, \text{Fe}^{2+} + \text{MnO}_4^- + 8 \, \text{H}^+ \rightarrow 5 \, \text{Fe}^{3+} + \text{Mn}^{2+} + 4 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of Fe²⁺ to MnO₄⁻ is 5:1. This means 5 moles of Fe²⁺ are required for every 1 mole of MnO₄⁻.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of FeSO₄
The moles of FeSO₄ can be calculated using its concentration and volume:
\[
\text{Moles of FeSO}_4 = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.40 \, \text{M} \times 0.0250 \, \text{L} = 0.010 \, \text{mol}
\]
Since FeSO₄ dissociates completely in solution, the moles of Fe²⁺ are also 0.010 mol.

### Step 2: Calculate moles of KMnO₄ required
Using the mole ratio from the balanced equation (5 Fe²⁺ : 1 MnO₄⁻), the moles of MnO₄⁻ required are:
\[
\text{Moles of MnO}_4^- = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe}^{2+}}{5} = \frac{0.010 \, \text{mol}}{5} = 0.002 \, \text{mol}
\]
Since 1 mole of KMnO₄ produces 1 mole of MnO₄⁻, the moles of KMnO₄ required are also 0.002 mol.

### Step 3: Calculate volume of KMnO₄ solution
The volume of KMnO₄ solution can be calculated using its concentration:
\[
\text{Volume of KMnO}_4 = \frac{\text{Moles of KMnO}_4}{\text{Concentration of KMnO}_4} = \frac{0.002 \, \text{mol}}{0.20 \, \text{M}} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10.0 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Final Answer:
The volume of 0.20 M KMnO₄ required is **10.0 mL**.

**Letter corresponding to the answer: I**
