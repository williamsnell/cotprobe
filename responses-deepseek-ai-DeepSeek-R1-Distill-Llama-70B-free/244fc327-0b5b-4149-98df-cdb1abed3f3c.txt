Okay, so I've got this art history question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about Archaic Greek statues and their poses. Let's see what the question says exactly.

The question asks which term refers to Archaic Greek statues that have rigidly frontal poses with clenched fists, similar to ancient Egyptian statues. The options are A through J, with terms like Atlantes, Gorgons, Telamones, Sphinxes, Minotaurs, Kouroi, Centaurs, Discoboloi, Hetairoi, and Caryatids.

Hmm, I remember that Archaic Greek art was influenced a lot by Egyptian art. Egyptian statues often have a very stiff, frontal pose with the arms straight at the sides or sometimes with fists clenched. So the Greek statues in question would be adopting that style.

I think the term "kouros" comes to mind. I recall that kouroi are those statues of young men that were common in the Archaic period. They were often depicted standing rigidly, front-facing, with their fists clenched. These statues were inspired by Egyptian art, which makes sense because the Greeks were influenced by the Egyptians during that time.

Wait, what's the difference between a kouros and other statues? Like, I know that "kore" refers to female statues of the same period. So F is Kouroi, which should be male. The other options don't seem to fit as well. 

Let me go through the options one by one to make sure I'm not missing anything. 

A: Atlantes – I think these are the figures that hold up buildings, like the Atlas figures. Not related to the pose described.

B: Gorgons – Those are the mythological creatures with snakes for hair, like Medusa. Not statues of people in poses.

C: Telamones – These are male figures that act as columns or supports, similar to caryatids but male. Maybe similar to Atlantes. Not the statues with the stiff poses.

D: Sphinxes – These are creatures with the body of a lion and a human head, often from Egyptian mythology. Not the Greek statues we're talking about here.

E: Minotaurs – Myths creatures, part man and bull. Not relevant to the statue poses in question.

F: Kouroi – As I thought earlier, these are the male youth statues with the stiff, frontal pose. This seems to fit.

G: Centaurs – Half man, half horse. Not relevant to the pose.

H: Discoboloi – These are statues of discus throwers, which are more dynamic and from a later period, like the Classical era. They show movement, not the rigid pose.

I: Hetairoi – I'm not too sure about this term. Maybe it refers to companions or something, but not a type of statue with a specific pose.

J: Caryatids – These are female figures that serve as columns, like the ones in the Erechtheion. They have a different pose, more natural and standing, but not the rigid, clenched fists.

So putting it all together, the term that fits is Kouroi, which is option F.

The correct answer is F: Kouroi. Kouroi are Archaic Greek statues of young men characterized by their rigidly frontal poses with clenched fists, heavily influenced by Egyptian art.
