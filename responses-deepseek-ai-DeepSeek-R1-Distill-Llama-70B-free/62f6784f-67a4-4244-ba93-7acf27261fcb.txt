Question:

After a severe thunderstorm had struck the area, a homeowner discovered that her roof had suffered extensive damage. She telephoned a roofer to inquire about having the necessary repairs done to her roof. The roofer agreed to finish the work within 30 days, and the homeowner promised to pay$10,000. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

Options:

A: The contract would be unenforceable, because it was not written and signed by both parties.
B: The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.
C: The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.
D: The performance by the homeowner would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the roofer.
E: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.
F: The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.
G: The performance of the roofer would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the homeowner.
H: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be independent conditions.
I: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be express concurrent conditions.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The scenario is that a homeowner's roof was damaged in a thunderstorm. She calls a roofer, who agrees to finish the repairs within 30 days. She promises to pay $10,000. So the question is about the enforceability and the conditions of this contract.

The options are from A to I, each making a different legal point. I remember that contracts can be oral unless they fall under the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain agreements to be in writing. The Statute of Frauds includes contracts for services that can't be completed within one year, but wait, this is a roofing job that's supposed to be done in 30 days. So maybe it's not covered by the Statute of Frauds because it can be performed within a year. That would mean an oral contract is enforceable, right? So options A and F, which say the contract is unenforceable because it's oral, are probably incorrect. Unless I'm missing something here.

Next, looking at the other options. They're talking about conditions precedent and concurrent conditions. Conditions in contracts can be a bit tricky. I think a condition precedent is something that must happen before the other party's performance becomes due. Concurrent conditions are when both parties' performances are ready, willing, and able to perform at the same time.

In this case, the roofer is supposed to do the work, and then the homeowner pays. So the roofer's performance (doing the repairs) is a condition precedent to the homeowner's payment. That means the homeowner doesn't have to pay until the roofer finishes the work. So the roofer's action is a condition that must be met first.

Looking at the options, option B says the roofer's performance is a constructive condition precedent to the homeowner's performance. Constructive conditions are implied by law, I think, as opposed to express conditions stated in the contract. So yes, even though the contract doesn't explicitly say it, the law would imply that the roofer must perform first before payment is due.

Another option is D, which flips it around. It says the homeowner's performance is a condition precedent to the roofer's. That doesn't make sense because the payment is after the work is done. So D is incorrect.

Option H suggests they're independent conditions, which I think refers to each being a separate obligation without depending on the other. That doesn't fit here because payment is clearly dependent on the work being done.

Options E and I talk about concurrent conditions. Concurrent conditions would mean both are supposed to perform at the same time. But in reality, the roofer does the work first, then the payment. So they're not concurrent. So E and I are out.

Option C mentions an implied condition subsequent. Condition subsequent affects the duty to perform after it's been breached. Wait, no, condition subsequent is more like a right to terminate if certain conditions aren't met. I'm a bit confused here. Condition precedent must occur before the duty arises, and condition subsequent is something that, if it occurs, allows termination.

So in this case, the roofer's performance is a condition precedent. If the roofer doesn't perform, the homeowner isn't obligated to pay. So option B is correct because it's a constructive condition precedent (implied by law, not explicitly stated) for the homeowner's payment.

Option G says the roofer's performance is an implied condition subsequent to the homeowner's. That doesn't make sense because the payment comes after the work. So G is wrong.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option B.

The scenario involves a homeowner and a roofer entering into an oral agreement for roof repairs. The roofer agrees to complete the work within 30 days, and the homeowner promises to pay $10,000 upon completion. The question revolves around the enforceability of the contract and the nature of the conditions between the parties.

First, the oral nature of the contract does not render it unenforceable. While the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, this agreement does not fall under its provisions because the work can be completed within one year. Therefore, options A and F, which claim the contract is unenforceable due to being oral, are incorrect.

Next, the relationship between the performances of the homeowner and the roofer is analyzed. The roofer's completion of the repairs is a prerequisite for the homeowner's payment. This makes the roofer's performance a condition precedent to the homeowner's obligation to pay. Since this condition is not explicitly stated in the contract but is implied by law, it is a constructive condition precedent. This aligns with option B.

Option D is incorrect because it reverses the roles, suggesting the homeowner's payment is a condition precedent to the roofer's performance, which contradicts the natural order of events. Option H is also incorrect because the performances are not independent; the homeowner's payment depends on the roofer's completion of the work.

Options E and I, which suggest concurrent conditions, are incorrect because the performances are not simultaneous. The roofer must complete the work before the homeowner is obligated to pay. Option G is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the roofer's performance as a condition subsequent, which is not applicable here.

Thus, the correct answer is that the roofer's performance is a constructive condition precedent to the homeowner's payment.

Answer: B
