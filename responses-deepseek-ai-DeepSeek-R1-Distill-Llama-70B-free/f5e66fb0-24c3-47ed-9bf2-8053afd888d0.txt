Okay, so I've got this question about the Gilgamesh epic and when the Old Babylonian version was modified into the standard version. I'm a bit rusty on my ancient history, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest known literary works. The standard version is the one most people are familiar with, right? But I think there were earlier versions. The Old Babylonian version comes to mind, and I believe that was before the standard version.

So, when was the Old Babylonian period? I think the Old Babylonian period was around the early second millennium BCE. Like, maybe 1900 BCE to 1600 BCE or something? But wait, the question is about when the Old Babylonian version was modified into the standard version. So that would be after the Old Babylonian period.

The standard version, I think, was compiled by a scribe named Sin-liqe-unninni. I'm pretty sure this happened later, like during the Middle Babylonian period maybe? Or perhaps even later, during the Assyrian periods.

Wait, the Neo-Assyrian period was around the first millennium BCE, right? So if the standard version was created then, that would place it in the first millennium. But when exactly?

I remember something about the seven tablets of the standard version being from the library of Ashurbanipal, who was a Neo-Assyrian king. His library was at Nineveh, and I think he ruled in the 7th century BCE. So that would be towards the end of the first millennium BCE, because the first millennium runs from 1000 BCE to 1 CE.

But wait, let me be careful. The Old Babylonian version was from the second millennium, so the modification into the standard version would have to be after that. So, the standard version is later, so first millennium.

Looking at the options, option A says "Toward the end of the first millennium BCE." That would align with the 7th century, which fits with Ashurbanipal's time. Option G is "At the start of the first millennium," which would be around 1000 BCE. But I don't think the standard version was that early. It was after the Old Babylonian, but the standard version came much later.

So, I think the correct answer is A, towards the end of the first millennium BCE.

The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest known literary works, with the Old Babylonian version preceding the standard version. The Old Babylonian period is typically dated to the early second millennium BCE. The standard version, compiled by Sin-liqe-unninni, was created later, during the Neo-Assyrian period. This version is associated with the library of Ashurbanipal, a Neo-Assyrian king who ruled in the 7th century BCE. Since the first millennium BCE spans from 1000 BCE to 1 CE, the standard version was finalized towards the end of this period.

Answer: A
