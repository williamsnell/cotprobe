Question:

A buyer expressed interest in purchasing an industrial air-conditioning system manufactured by the seller. The parties agreed orally on a price of $100,000 for the system, but continued to negotiate over several points. When all matters regarding the air-conditioning system were finally settled, the parties signed a written agreement. It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?

Options:

A: Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.
B: No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.
C: Yes, because the buyer can refuse to pay more than the orally agreed price.
D: Yes, because the oral agreement is considered more binding than the written agreement.
E: Yes, because the seller cannot increase the price without the buyer's consent.
F: Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.
G: No, because the court does not consider oral agreements.
H: No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.
I: No, because the written agreement takes precedence over the oral agreement.
J: No, because the seller has the right to increase the price in the written agreement.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically dealing with the parol evidence rule and whether certain evidence is admissible. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a buyer and seller orally agreed on a price of $100,000 for an industrial air-conditioning system. But they continued negotiating other points. Later, they signed a written agreement that set the price at $110,000. The written contract didn't have a merger clause, which I remember is important because a merger clause typically states that the written agreement is the complete and final understanding, so prior agreements aren't part of the contract.

The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer is refusing to pay more than the $100,000 they initially agreed on orally. The seller is suing for the extra $10,000. The question is whether the court will allow evidence of the oral agreement's price.

So, I need to recall the parol evidence rule. From what I remember, the parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations that contradict the terms of a written contract. But there are exceptions. For example, if the written contract doesn't include all the terms (so no merger clause), or if there's a claim of mistake, fraud, or illegality, then parol evidence might be admissible.

Wait, in this case, the written agreement does not have a merger clause. So that might mean that prior agreements aren't necessarily merged into the written contract. But the written agreement here does have an express term about the price being $110,000. So the oral agreement was about $100k, and the written is higher.

I think the key here is whether the parol evidence rule applies. The rule says that when a written contract is intended to be the final and complete agreement, you can't use prior or contemporaneous oral agreements to contradict it. But since there's no merger clause, maybe the written agreement isn't the complete integration. So perhaps the parties didn't intend it to be the full and final agreement.

Wait, but in this situation, after the oral agreement, they continued negotiating and then signed a written agreement. The written agreement presumably covers all the terms they agreed upon, including the new price. So even without a merger clause, if the written agreement is a fully integrated contract (which it seems to be because they signed it after negotiations), then prior oral terms can't contradict it.

But wait, the parol evidence rule applies when the written contract is a complete integration. The absence of a merger clause doesn't automatically mean it's not completely integrated. The court would look at whether the parties intended the writing to be the final agreement. If the written agreement covers all terms, including the price, then it's likely a complete integration, making prior oral terms inadmissible to contradict it.

So the buyer is trying to use the prior oral agreement to contradict the written price. Under the parol evidence rule, that's not allowed if the written agreement is fully integrated. So the court would likely exclude that evidence, meaning the buyer has to pay the $110k.

Looking at the options, the question is whether the court admits the evidence. If the parol evidence rule applies, the answer would be no. Let's look at the options:

Option B says no because the oral term contradicts an express term. That makes sense because the written contract has $110k, and the oral is $100k. But wait, in some cases, like when there's partial integration, parol evidence can be used to supplement but not contradict. But since the written agreement includes the price, which is an express term, any prior oral agreement on that term would be barred.

Option F says yes because there's no merger clause. But the presence or absence of a merger clause isn't the determining factorâ€” it's whether the contract is fully integrated. Without a merger clause, the court might consider whether it's fully integrated based on other factors. But in this case, the written contract was the final agreement after negotiations, so it's likely fully integrated despite no merger clause.

Option I says no because the written agreement takes precedence. That's more of a general rule but doesn't directly address the parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule is more specific about prior agreements.

So the correct reasoning would be that the written agreement is fully integrated, so the parol evidence rule applies, and the oral agreement can't be used to contradict the written price. Therefore, the court would not admit the evidence, so the answer is B or I?

Wait, option B says no because the oral term contradicts an express term. That aligns with the rule that you can't use parol evidence to contradict a written term in a fully integrated contract.

Option I says the written agreement takes precedence, which is true, but the specific reason here is the parol evidence rule, making B the better choice.

Alternatively, another angle: the Statute of Frauds. But I don't think that applies here because the contract isn't for goods over $500; wait, no, industrial air conditioning systems are goods, but the price is $100k, which is way over $500. So the written agreement is required under the Statute of Frauds. But since they have a written agreement, that's satisfied. So that's not the issue here.

So back to parol evidence. Since the written contract is fully integrated (even without a merger clause), the prior oral agreement on price is not admissible. Thus, the court would exclude it, and the seller can recover the full $110k.

So the court is likely to say no to admitting the evidence, making option B the correct answer.

The question revolves around the parol evidence rule and whether evidence of an oral agreement ($100,000 price) can be admitted to contradict a written agreement ($110,000 price). The parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the terms of a fully integrated written contract. A fully integrated contract is one that the parties intend to be the final and complete agreement, even if it lacks a merger clause.

In this case, the written agreement was signed after negotiations and includes an express term for the price ($110,000). The absence of a merger clause does not automatically mean the contract is not fully integrated. Courts often infer full integration when the written agreement covers all negotiated terms, including the price. Therefore, the oral agreement on the price ($100,000) cannot be used to contradict the written agreement under the parol evidence rule.

Option B correctly states that the court is unlikely to admit the oral evidence because it contradicts an express term in the written agreement. While Option I is also correct in stating that the written agreement takes precedence, Option B provides the specific legal reasoning tied to the parol evidence rule, making it the better choice.

Answer: B
