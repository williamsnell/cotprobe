Okay, so I have this question here: "Objects that absorb light appear..." and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that when light hits an object, there are a few things that can happen. The light can be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. If the object is transparent, it transmits the light, like glass. If it's opaque, it doesn't transmit, so it either reflects or absorbs the light.

Now, the question is about absorption. So, objects that absorb light—what do they look like? I think about colors and how they relate to light absorption. White objects reflect all wavelengths of light, which is why they appear white. Black objects, on the other hand, absorb all wavelengths and reflect none, which makes them look black.

Wait, but the options don't have 'black' as an option? Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option J is black. So if an object absorbs all the light, it doesn't reflect any, so it appears black.

But wait, dark is an option too. Option C is dark. Hmm, but dark is more about the absence of light, not necessarily about absorbing light. Like, if a room is dark, it's because there's no light. But an object appearing dark because it's absorbing light—wouldn't that just be black?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. So when an object absorbs light, especially all the visible wavelengths, it looks black. So the answer should be J: black.

Wait, but another thought—some objects absorb certain wavelengths and reflect others, which is why they have color. Like a red apple absorbs all but red light. So the apple appears red because it reflects red. But when an object absorbs all light, like a black cloth, it doesn't reflect any, so it looks black.

So the correct answer is J: black.

Objects that absorb light do not reflect any wavelengths, resulting in the appearance of black. 

Answer: J
