Okay, so I have this multiple choice question about the characteristics of arteries, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that arteries and veins are types of blood vessels, but they have some key differences. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, right? So I should look for an option that aligns with that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they carry blood towards the heart. Wait, that's what veins do, not arteries. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B states they always carry deoxygenated blood. Hmm. I think that's not right because the pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood, but most arteries, like the aorta, carry oxygenated blood. So B isn't always true.

Option C says they carry blood away from the heart. That rings a bell. Arteries do carry blood away, except for the pulmonary artery which goes to the lungs. But I think in general, this is correct, so C might be the right choice.

Option D mentions valves preventing backflow. I remember that veins have valves, not arteries. So D is incorrect.

Option E claims they always carry oxygenated blood. No, because as I thought earlier, the pulmonary artery is an exception. So E is wrong.

Option F says they have a large lumen compared to veins. Arteries usually have thicker walls but I'm not sure about the lumen size. I think veins have larger lumens, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, no, maybe larger isn't the right word. Arteries have to handle higher pressure, so they have thicker walls but maybe not necessarily a larger lumen. So I'm not sure about F. Maybe I'll come back to this.

Option G is about gas exchange and nutrients. That's capillaries, not arteries. So G is incorrect.

Option H says they form a network of capillaries. No, capillaries are tiny vessels that connect arterioles and venules. So H is wrong.

Option I says they are thin-walled. No, arteries are thick-walled because they handle high blood pressure from the heart. So I is incorrect.

Option J says they contain no muscle tissue. No, arteries have smooth muscle in their walls to adjust blood pressure. So J is wrong.

So narrowing it down, options C and F are possibilities. Wait, what was option F again? It says they have a large lumen compared to veins. I'm trying to recall. Veins typically have larger lumens because they hold more blood, but the walls are thinner. Arteries have smaller lumens but thicker walls. So F might not be correct. Or do I have that backwards? No, I think it's the other way around. Arteries have smaller diameters because the blood is under higher pressure. So F is incorrect because the lumen isn't larger.

So that leaves option C as the correct answer. Arteries carry blood away from the heart.

The correct characteristic of arteries is that they carry blood away from the heart. This is a fundamental distinction between arteries and veins, with arteries being responsible for transporting blood under higher pressure from the heart to the rest of the body. While some options, like F, might seem plausible, they are incorrect because arteries generally have smaller lumens compared to veins, which have larger lumens to hold more blood. Other options, such as A, B, D, E, G, H, I, and J, are also incorrect based on the specific roles and structures of arteries.

Answer: C
