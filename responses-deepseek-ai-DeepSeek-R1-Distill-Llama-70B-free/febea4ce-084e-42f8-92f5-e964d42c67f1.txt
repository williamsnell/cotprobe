Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. The question is about calculating the frequency of a hydrogen transition where the principal quantum number changes from n=101 to n=100. Hmm, I remember that when electrons transition between energy levels in an atom, they emit or absorb photons, and the energy of those photons corresponds to the frequency of the emitted or absorbed light. 

Wait, right, the Rydberg formula is probably what I need here. I think the Rydberg formula relates the wavelengths of the spectral lines of hydrogen to the energy levels. The formula is something like 1/λ = R*(1/(n1^2) - 1/(n2^2)), where R is the Rydberg constant. But wait, n1 and n2, which one is which? Oh right, n1 is the lower energy level, so in this case, since the transition is from n=101 to n=100, n2 would be 101 and n1 would be 100. Because the electron is dropping to a lower energy state, so it emits a photon.

Wait, no, wait. No, the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R*(1/(n_final^2) - 1/(n_initial^2)) because when the electron drops from a higher to a lower energy level, it emits a photon. So, in this case, n_initial is 101, n_final is 100. So substituting, 1/λ would be R*(1/100² - 1/101²). 

But wait, the Rydberg constant R is given in terms of inverse meters. I think R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. Yeah, that's right. So plugging in those numbers, let's compute that.

Let me compute the difference first. 1/100^2 is 1e-4, and 1/101^2 is approximately (since 101 is close to 100, 101^2 is 10201, so 1/10201 ≈ 9.80039e-5). So the difference is 1e-4 minus 9.80039e-5, which equals (1e-4) - (0.980039e-4) = 0.019961e-4. Wait, wait, let me calculate that accurately.

Wait, 1/(100)^2 = 0.0001 (1e-4). 1/(101)^2 is 1/(10201) ≈ 0.0000980039. So subtracting the two: 0.0001 - 0.0000980039 = 0.0000019961. So that's 1.9961e-6 m^-1.

So 1/λ equals R multiplied by that. R is 1.097e7 m^-1. So:

1/λ = 1.097e7 * 1.9961e-6.

Let me compute that. 1.097e7 is 10,970,000. 1.9961e-6 is 0.0000019961.

Multiply them: 10,970,000 * 0.0000019961. Hmm. Let's see, 10,970,000 * 2e-6 is about 21.94. But wait, 1.9961 is a bit less than 2, so maybe 21.94 * (0.99805) ≈ 21.88? Or more accurately, 1.097e7 * 1.9961e-6 = (1.097 * 1.9961) * 1e1. Because 1e7 * 1e-6 = 1e1 (10). Let me compute 1.097 * 1.9961.

1.097 * 2 is 2.194, but since it's 1.9961, which is 2 - 0.0039, so 1.097*(2 - 0.0039) = 2.194 - (1.097 * 0.0039). 1.097 * 0.0039 is about 0.00428. So 2.194 - 0.00428 = 2.1897. So 2.1897 * 10 (from 1e1) gives 21.897. So 1/λ ≈ 21.897 m^-1.

Wait, wait, no. Because 1.097e7 * 1.9961e-6 equals (1.097 * 1.9961) * (1e7 * 1e-6) )= (approx 2.189) * (10) )= 21.89 m^-1. So 1/λ is approximately 21.89 per meter. So λ is 1 / 21.89 ≈ 0.0457 meters? Wait, that can't be right. Because that would be in the radio wave range, which is way too long. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the Rydberg formula? Let me double-check. Oh wait, the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R * (1/(n_final)^2 - 1/(n_initial)^2). But wait, no—wait, the formula is 1/λ = R * (1/(n_low)^2 - 1/(n_high)^2). Because when the electron transitions from a higher energy level (n_high) to a lower one (n_low), it emits a photon. So in this case, n_initial is 101 (higher), n_final is 100 (lower). So 1/λ = R*(1/100² - 1/101²). Which we've already calculated as 1.097e7 m^-1 * (1e-4 - 9.80039e-5) = 21.897 m^-1. So 1/λ is approximately 21.897 m^-1, so λ ≈ 0.0457 m, which is 4.57 centimeters. That's a microwave frequency, but looking at the options, the frequencies are all much higher, like 10^9 Hz and above. Hmm, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the frequency using the relation c = λν, so ν = c/λ.

Wait, right. Frequency ν equals the speed of light divided by the wavelength λ. So if λ is 0.0457 meters, then ν = 3e8 m/s / 0.0457 m ≈ 6.57e9 Hz, which is 6.57 ×10^9 Hz. Looking at the options, option C is 6.5 ×10^9 Hz, which is very close.

Wait, but let me make sure all the steps are correct. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.

First, compute 1/100² = 0.0001.

1/(101)^2 = 1/(10201) = approx 0.0000980039.

The difference is 0.0001 - 0.0000980039 = 0.0000019961.

Multiply by Rydberg constant R = 1.097373e7 m^-1.

So 1.097373e7 * 0.0000019961 = let's compute this.

1e7 * 2e-6 is 20. So 1.097373e7 ≈ 1.097373 * 1e7.

Multiply 1.097373e7 by 1.9961e-6:

1.097373e7 * 1.9961e-6 = (1.097373 * 1.9961) * 1e1.

Calculating 1.097373 * 1.9961:

1.097373 * 2 = 2.194746.

But since it's 1.9961, which is 2 - 0.0039, so 1.097373*(2 - 0.0039) = 2.194746 - (1.097373 * 0.0039).

1.097373 * 0.0039 = 0.00428.

So 2.194746 - 0.00428 = 2.190466.

Multiply by 1e1 (10): 21.90466 m^-1.

So 1/λ ≈ 21.90466 m^-1 → λ ≈ 1 / 21.90466 ≈ 0.04564 m.

Now, using c=3e8 m/s, frequency ν = c/λ = 3e8 / 0.04564 ≈ let's compute that.

3e8 / 0.04564 = (3e8) / (4.564e-2) )= 3e8 / 4.564e-2 ≈ (3 /4.564) * 1e10.

3 /4.564 ≈ 0.6577.

So 0.6577e10 Hz = 6.577e9 Hz, which is approximately 6.58 ×10^9 Hz.

Looking back at the options, option C is 6.5 ×10^9 Hz, which is very close to our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait but let me check another approach. Maybe using the formula for energy levels and then calculating the energy difference.

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

So the energy difference ΔE = E_100 - E_101.

E_100 = -13.6 / (100)^2 = -13.6e-4 eV.

E_101 = -13.6 / (101)^2 ≈ -13.6 / 10201 ≈ -0.0013336 eV.

So ΔE = E_100 - E_101 = (-0.000136) - (-0.0013336) = 0.0011976 eV.

Wait, no, wait: E_final is E_100. So ΔE = E_100 - E_101 = (-13.6 /100²) - (-13.6 /101²) = 13.6*(1/(101)^2 - 1/(100)^2) * (-1) because the electron is transitioning downward, so ΔE is negative, but the photon's energy is positive. So the energy of the photon is E_photon = E_101 - E_100 = 13.6 (1/100² - 1/101²) eV.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the energy in joules. So E_photon in eV is 13.6 * (1e-4 - 1/10201) = 13.6 * (0.0001 - 0.0000980039) = 13.6 * 0.0000019961 ≈ 13.6 * 1.9961e-6 ≈ 27156e-9 eV, since 1e-6 is micro, so 27.156 micro-eV. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, 13.6 * 1.9961e-6 is 2.713e-5 eV.

Wait, 1e-6 is 0.000001, so 13.6 * 1.9961e-6 = 0.00002713 eV.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So E_photon = 0.00002713 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 4.348e-23 J.

The relation between energy and frequency is E = hν, where h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ν = E / h = 4.348e-23 J / 6.626e-34 J·s ≈ 6.56e10 Hz.

Wait, that's 6.56e10 Hz, which is 65.6 GHz. But that's way lower than the options I thought earlier. Hmm, that's conflicting with the previous result. Wait, what's going on here? I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV /n². So E_100 = -13.6 / (100)^2 = -0.000136 eV.

E_101 = -13.6 / (101)^2 ≈ -0.00013336 eV.

So the difference is E_101 - E_100 = (-0.00013336) - (-0.000136) )= 0.00000264 eV. So ΔE = 2.64e-6 eV.

Wait, that's 2.64 micro-eV. That's a very small energy difference, which would correspond to a low frequency. But earlier, using the Rydberg formula, I got ν ≈6.5e9 Hz, which is about 6.5 GHz. Hmm, that's a big discrepancy. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, no, wait a second. Maybe I messed up the Rydberg formula approach. Let me recalculate.

Wait, using the Rydberg formula, 1/λ = R*(1/n_final^2 - 1/n_initial^2) = 1.097e7 (1/100^2 - 1/101^2).

Wait, 1/100^2 is 1e-4, 1/101^2 is approx 9.8003e-5. So 1e-4 - 9.8003e-5 = (1.0 - 0.98003)e-4 = 0.01997e-4 = 1.997e-6.

So 1.097e7 m^-1 * 1.997e-6 m^-1 gives:

1.097e7 * 1.997e-6 = (1.097 * 1.997) * (1e7 * 1e-6) )= (2.186) * (10) )= 21.86 m^-1.

So 1/λ ≈21.86 m^-1 → λ ≈ 0.0458 m, which is 4.58 cm.

Then, frequency ν = c / λ = 3e8 m/s / 0.0458 m = (3e8) / 0.0458 ≈ 6.555e9 Hz, which is about 6.555 ×10^9 Hz. That's 6.555 GHz, so option C is 6.5e9, which matches.

Wait, but earlier, using the energy levels, I got a much lower frequency, like 65.6 GHz. There's a contradiction here. So I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, let me recompute the energy method.

E_photon = E_initial - E_final.

E_initial is E_101 = -13.6 / (101)^2 eV.

E_final is E_100 = -13.6 / (100)^2 eV.

So ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (-13.6/100²) - (-13.6/101²) )= 13.6*(1/101² - 1/100²) eV.

Wait, 1/101² is less than 1/100², so 1/101² -1/100² is negative. So ΔE is negative, which doesn't make sense because the photon energy can't be negative. So perhaps I should take the absolute value. So E_photon = 13.6 * (1/100² - 1/101²) eV.

So 1/100² = 1e-4, 1/101²≈ 9.8003e-5.

So 1e-4 -9.8003e-5 = 1.996e-6.

So E_photon =13.6 * 1.996e-6 eV = 2.714e-5 eV.

Convert to joules: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 2.714e-5 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 4.35e-24 J.

Then, frequency ν = E/h = (4.35e-24 J) / (6.626e-34 J·s) = approx 6.56e9 Hz, same as before. So 6.56 GHz, which matches the Rydberg method. So why earlier did I get 65 GHz? Oh wait, I think I messed up the exponent when converting eV to J.

Wait, in the first energy approach, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo that.

E_photon =13.6 * (1.996e-6) eV = 2.714e-5 eV.

Convert to joules: 2.714e-5 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = (2.714 * 1.602) * 1e-24 J.

2.714 * 1.602 ≈ 4.35 (since 2.7 *1.6 is 4.32, and 0.014 *1.602 is ~0.022, so total 4.342).

So 4.342e-24 J.

Then ν = E/h =4.342e-24 J / 6.626e-34 J·s ≈ (4.342 /6.626 ) * 1e10.

4.342 /6.626 ≈ 0.655.

So 0.655e10 Hz = 6.55e9 Hz, which is 6.55 GHz, same as before. So both methods give the same answer, which is around 6.5e9 Hz. So the correct option is C.

To calculate the frequency of the hydrogen transition \( n = 101 \rightarrow n = 100 \), we use the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{final}}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{\text{initial}}^2} \right),
\]

where \( R \) is the Rydberg constant (\( R \approx 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \)), \( n_{\text{final}} = 100 \), and \( n_{\text{initial}} = 101 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{100^2} - \frac{1}{101^2} \right).
\]

First, compute the terms:

\[
\frac{1}{100^2} = 0.0001, \
