Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement is the odd one out here. The options are A through D. Let me read each one carefully.

Option A says, "Societal groups have a right to survive." Hmm, that sounds a bit like a value statement. I remember from my studies that groups often have rights, but I'm not sure if that's a fundamental characteristic or more of a social norm.

Option B: "Societal groups have their own reality." Wait, that rings a bell. I think this relates to social constructionism, where groups create their own social realities through shared experiences and interactions. So this seems like a key concept in sociology.

Option C: "Societal groups are constituted by social interaction." That makes sense because groups form based on how people interact. Without interaction, a group wouldn't really exist. So this is a basic definition of societal groups.

Option D: "Societal groups are multiple-identity units." I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think societal groups can encompass various identities within them. Like, a group might have different roles or subgroups, so each individual in the group might identify in multiple ways. So this seems like it's about the complexity of identities within groups.

Now, trying to find the odd one out. Let me think about what each statement is about. Options B, C, and D all seem to be discussing the structure, formation, and characteristics of societal groups from a sociological perspective. 

Option A talks about a right to survive. Rights are more about ethics or legal standings rather than the inherent nature or structure of groups. The other options are more descriptive of what groups are, while A is making a normative claim about what they should have. So A might be the odd one out because it's a value statement rather than a descriptive one about the group's nature.

Wait, but could there be another angle? Let me double-check. Societal groups do have rights in some contexts, like minority rights. But the other options are more about how groups function and exist, not about rights. So yeah, A is the odd one because it's about rights rather than the characteristics or constitution of groups.

The odd one out is **A** because it makes a normative statement about societal groups having a "right to survive," which is an ethical or legal claim. In contrast, options B, C, and D describe the characteristics, formation, and nature of societal groups from a sociological perspective, focusing on their structure and functioning.

Answer: A
