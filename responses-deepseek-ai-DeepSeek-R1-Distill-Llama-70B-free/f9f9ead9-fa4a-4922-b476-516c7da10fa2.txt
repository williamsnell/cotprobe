Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which of the given options must be divisible by 11, given that 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my number theory, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, the problem states that x and y are positive integers, and 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. So, mathematically, that means 3x + 7y ≡ 0 mod 11. My goal is to find which of the options A through J is also divisible by 11, i.e., which expression ≡ 0 mod 11 when 3x +7y ≡0 mod 11.

I think the approach here is to express each option in terms of 3x +7y somehow, using modular arithmetic. Alternatively, maybe find a relationship between x and y that can help substitute into each option.

Let me start by considering the given condition: 3x +7y ≡0 mod11. Maybe I can solve this for one variable in terms of the other modulo 11.

Let's try solving for x. So,

3x ≡ -7y mod11.

But -7 mod11 is 4, because 11-7=4. So,

3x ≡4y mod11.

To isolate x, I need the modular inverse of 3 mod11. The inverse of 3 is a number m such that 3m ≡1 mod11. Trying m=4: 3*4=12≡1 mod11. Yes, because 12-11=1. So, the inverse is 4.

Multiply both sides by 4:

x ≡4*4y ≡16y mod11.

But 16 mod11 is 5 (since 11*1=11, 16-11=5). So,

x ≡5y mod11.

So, x is congruent to 5y modulo11. That means x =5y +11k for some integer k. But since x and y are positive integers, k can be zero or positive, but that's not too important right now. What's important is that x ≡5y mod11.

Now, I can substitute x in terms of y into each option and see which expression becomes 0 mod11.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since 3x+7y ≡0 mod11, maybe each option can be expressed as a linear combination of 3x+7y and something else. Alternatively, perhaps each option can be written in terms of this.

Alternatively, maybe I can express each option as a combination of x and y, and see if it's a multiple of 3x+7y in some way. Hmm, but that might not be straightforward.

Another approach: Since x ≡5y mod11, I can express x as 5y +11k, but perhaps for the purposes of the problem, since we're working modulo11, I can set x ≡5y, so x=5y mod11.

So, substituting x=5y into each option:

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 7x +3y.

Substitute x=5y: 7*(5y) +3y =35y +3y=38y.

38 mod11: 11*3=33, 38-33=5. So 38y ≡5y mod11.

Is 5y ≡0 mod11? Well, only if y is a multiple of 11. But since x and y are just positive integers, y could be anything. So option A isn't necessarily 0 mod11.

Option B: x + y +5.

x=5y, so 5y + y +5 =6y +5.

6y +5 mod11. Not necessarily zero unless specific conditions on y, so B is out.

Option C:6x -2y.

Substitute x=5y: 6*(5y) -2y=30y-2y=28y.

28 mod11: 11*2=22, 28-22=6 → 28≡6 mod11. So 6y mod11. Only zero if y is a multiple of 11, but y could be any positive integer, so C isn't necessarily zero.

Option D:8x +3y.

Substitute x=5y: 8*5y +3y=40y +3y=43y.

43 mod11: 11*3=33, 43-33=10 → 10y mod11. So 10y ≡0 mod11 only if y is 0 mod11, which isn't guaranteed. So D is out.

Option E:4x +6y.

Substituting x=5y: 4*5y +6y=20y +6y=26y.

26 mod11=26-2*11=4 → 4y mod11. Not zero unless y is multiple of 11. So E is out.

Option F:5x +6y.

Substituting x=5y:5*(5y)+6y=25y +6y=31y.

31 mod11: 11*2=22, 31-22=9 → 9y mod11. So 9y ≡0 only if y is multiple of 11. So F isn't necessarily zero.

Option G:9x +4y.

Substituting x=5y: 9*(5y) +4y=45y +4y=49y.

49 mod11: 11*4=44, 49-44=5 →5y mod11. Not zero unless y is multiple of 11. So G is out.

Option H:4x -9y.

Substituting x=5y:4*(5y)-9y=20y -9y=11y.

11y mod11=0. Oh, wait! Because 11y is obviously a multiple of 11. So 11y ≡0 mod11, regardless of y. So option H is 0 mod11. That's a possible candidate.

Wait, but let me check the other options just to make sure.

Option I:2x +5y.

x=5y: 2*5y +5y=10y +5y=15y.

15 mod11=4 →4y mod11. Not zero unless y is multiple of 11. So I is out.

Option J:x +8y.

x=5y: 5y +8y=13y.

13 mod11=2 →2y mod11. Not zero unless y is 11k, which isn't guaranteed. So J is out.

So the only option that gives 0 mod11 is option H. Let me double-check my substitution for H:

H is 4x -9y. Substituting x=5y:

4*(5y) =20y; 20y -9y=11y. 11y is 0 mod11. Yep, that's correct. So option H must be divisible by 11.

Given that \(3x + 7y\) is divisible by 11, we know that \(3x + 7y \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). Solving for \(x\) in terms of \(y\), we find:

\[
3x \equiv -7y \pmod{11}.
\]

Since \(-7 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}\), this simplifies to:

\[
3x \equiv 4y \pmod{11}.
\]

The modular inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4, because \(3 \cdot 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:

\[
x \equiv 16y \pmod{11},
\]

and since \(16 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}\), we have:

\[
x \equiv 5y \pmod{11}.
\]

Substituting \(x = 5y\) into each option, we evaluate whether the expression is divisible by 11:

- **Option A: \(7x + 3y\)**  
  \(7(5y) + 3y = 35y + 3y = 38y\).  
  \(38 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}\), so \(38y \equiv 5y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

- **Option B: \(x + y + 5\)**  
  \(5y + y + 5 = 6y + 5\).  
  This is not necessarily zero modulo 11.

- **Option C: \(6x - 2y\)**  
  \(6(5y) - 2y = 30y - 2y = 28y\).  
  \(28 \equiv 6 \pmod{11}\), so \(28y \equiv 6y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

- **Option D: \(8x + 3y\)**  
  \(8(5y) + 3y = 40y + 3y = 43y\).  
  \(43 \equiv 10 \pmod{11}\), so \(43y \equiv 10y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

- **Option E: \(4x + 6y\)**  
  \(4(5y) + 6y = 20y + 6y = 26y\).  
  \(26 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}\), so \(26y \equiv 4y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

- **Option F: \(5x + 6y\)**  
  \(5(5y) + 6y = 25y + 6y = 31y\).  
  \(31 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}\), so \(31y \equiv 9y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

- **Option G: \(9x + 4y\)**  
  \(9(5y) + 4y = 45y + 4y = 49y\).  
  \(49 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}\), so \(49y \equiv 5y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

- **Option H: \(4x - 9y\)**  
  \(4(5y) - 9y = 20y - 9y = 11y\).  
  \(11y \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\).  
  This is always zero.

- **Option I: \(2x + 5y\)**  
  \(2(5y) + 5y = 10y + 5y = 15y\).  
  \(15 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}\), so \(15y \equiv 4y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

- **Option J: \(x + 8y\)**  
  \(5y + 8y = 13y\).  
  \(13 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), so \(13y \equiv 2y \pmod{11}\).  
  Not necessarily zero.

The only option that is guaranteed to be divisible by 11 is **Option H**.
