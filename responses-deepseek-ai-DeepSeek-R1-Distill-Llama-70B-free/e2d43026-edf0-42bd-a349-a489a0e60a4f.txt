Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about work-related accidents and the characteristics of people who have them. I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what tends to be true about persons who have work-related accidents compared to those who don't. The options are A through H, each suggesting a different characteristic.

I remember from psychology that there are certain factors that contribute to workplace accidents. One big factor is stress. If someone is experiencing a lot of stress, especially recent stress, they might be more distracted or less focused on their work, increasing the chance of an accident. So looking at the options, option E says they have had more recent life stress than accident-free workers. That sounds plausible.

Another thought is about the age of the workers. I think younger workers might be more prone to accidents because they might be less experienced or take more risks. Option D says they are younger than accident-free workers. I'm not sure if that's the primary factor, though. I think stress is a bigger contributor.

Looking at the other options. Option A suggests they're more likely to have had promotions. I don't think that's right; promotions usually come with more responsibility, which might mean they're more careful. Option B says they have fewer responsibilities, but I'm not sure how that connects. Maybe if they have fewer responsibilities, they're less experienced, but I'm not certain.

Option C is about being less likely to have promotions. I'm not sure about that either. Option F says they're more physically fit, which doesn't make sense because being fit might actually reduce accidents. Unless the job is dangerous and requires more physical exertion, but that's speculative.

Option G claims they're less intelligent. I don't think that's correct. Intelligence doesn't directly correlate with accident proneness in a clear way. Plus, that seems like an unfair stereotype.

Option H says they're more likely to take sick leave. I'm not sure about that. Maybe if they're injured, they take more sick leave, but that's after the accident, not necessarily a cause.

So putting it together, the most likely answer is E. Recent life stress can impair cognitive functions, leading to more accidents. I've heard of studies linking stress to increased risk of workplace injuries because stress can distract people and reduce their awareness of safety protocols.
