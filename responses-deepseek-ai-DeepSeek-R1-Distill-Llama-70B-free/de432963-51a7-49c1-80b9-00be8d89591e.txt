Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantageâ€”the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places."
Frederick Douglass, 1857

D: separate but equal facilities for people of different races was constitutional
E: every state had the right to secede from the Union
F: the abolitionist movement was a threat to the United States Constitution
G: school prayer violated the principle of "separation of church and state"

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Frederick Douglass and the Dred Scott case. I'm a bit rusty on my American history, but let's try to break it down.

First, the quote from Frederick Douglass is talking about how slaveholders have a big advantage because they're organized. He mentions state governments, church organizations, and the federal government all supporting slavery. He specifically points out that the federal government, including the army, navy, and even the Supreme Court, is backing slavery. He says they control the pen, purse, and sword against the truth preached by humble people.

So the question is asking what Chief Justice Roger Taney said in the Dred Scott case that upheld this sentiment. The options are A through J, each about different legal or constitutional issues.

I remember that the Dred Scott decision was a landmark case. From what I recall, Dred Scott was a slave who sued for his freedom, arguing that since he had lived in free territories, he should be free. But the Supreme Court ruled against him. I think the ruling said that African Americans, whether free or slave, weren't citizens and had no right to sue in court. Also, I believe the decision struck down the Missouri Compromise, which had banned slavery in certain territories.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match which one aligns with Taney's opinion. Let's go through them:

Option A: Corporations entitled to same protections as individuals under the 14th Amendment. That sounds more like later cases, maybe in the late 1800s or early 1900s, like the Santa Clara case. Not related to Dred Scott.

Option B: Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional. No, I think the Fugitive Slave Act was actually part of the Compromise of 1850 and was upheld. The Dred Scott case was more about slavery in territories and citizenship.

Option C: Women's right to vote. That's way later, 19th Amendment in 1920. Not relevant here.

Option D: Separate but equal. That's Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896, which allowed segregation. Not Dred Scott.

Option E: Right to secede. That's more about states' rights leading to the Civil War, but the Dred Scott case didn't directly address secession. It was about slavery and citizenship.

Option F: Abolitionist movement as a threat. Not sure, but I think the case was more about the legal status of slaves rather than directly addressing the abolitionists.

Option G: School prayer and separation of church. That's a 20th-century issue, like Engel v. Vitale. Not relevant.

Option H: Second Amendment. Not related to Dred Scott.

Option I: Slavery as a state's rights issue and popular sovereignty. Hmm, popular sovereignty was the idea that each territory could decide on slavery, which was part of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. But in Dred Scott, Taney argued that Congress couldn't prohibit slavery in territories because slaves were property protected by the 5th Amendment. So maybe this is close, but I'm not sure.

Option J: Congress had no right to regulate slavery in territories. That sounds familiar. Yes, in Dred Scott, Taney said that Congress didn't have the authority to prohibit slavery in the territories because it would deprive slave owners of their property without due process. So the Court ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because Congress exceeded its powers.

So looking back at the options, J says Congress had no right to regulate slavery in U.S. territories, which matches what I remember about the Dred Scott decision. So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks which statement by Chief Justice Roger Taney in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case aligns with Frederick Douglass's assertion that slaveholders held significant organizational and institutional power to uphold slavery. In the Dred Scott decision, Taney ruled that African Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in court. Additionally, he struck down the Missouri Compromise, asserting that Congress had no authority to regulate slavery in U.S. territories. This decision upheld the idea that slavery was constitutionally protected as a property right under the Fifth Amendment.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H**: These options address issues unrelated to the Dred Scott case, such as corporate rights, women's suffrage, segregation, secession, and school prayer, which are not relevant to Taney's ruling.
- **I**: While popular sovereignty was a concept related to slavery in territories, it was not the central argument in Taney's opinion.
- **J**: This directly reflects Taney's ruling that Congress had no right to regulate slavery in U.S. territories, aligning with Douglass's critique of the institutional support for slavery.

Thus, the correct answer is:

J: Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories.
