Question:

On Thursday morning, two plainclothes police officers were shot to death while trying to arrest a bank robber who had just robbed a bank. Following the killings, the police issued an "all-points-bulletin" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.
B: succeed, if the man can prove the security guard had no reason to suspect him
C: succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.
D: not succeed, because the security guard was performing his duty
E: succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.
F: succeed, if the security guard used excessive force during the arrest
G: succeed, if the man experienced emotional trauma as a result of the false arrest
H: not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically regarding assault. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a security guard arrests a man, thinking he's the bank robber, but it turns out he's the wrong guy. The man is humiliated and wants to sue for assault. The question is whether he'll succeed.

First, I remember that assault is an intentional tort. The basic elements are intentional act, causing reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. So, the key points are intent, causation, and the apprehension of harm.

In this case, the security guard pulled a gun and arrested the man. So, the guard's act was pulling the gun and making the arrest. The man would have seen the gun being pointed at him, which should create a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. 

Looking at the options, option E says the man would succeed if he saw the guard pointing the gun. That seems relevant because seeing the gun would create that apprehension. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the only factor.

Another angle is whether the guard had a reasonable belief. The police had an APB for a 40-year-old Caucasian, but the guard arrested an African American man. Wait, the initial description was a Caucasian, but the guard arrested an African American. So, the guard perhaps didn't match the race correctly. That might mean the guard's mistake was unreasonable. 

Option C says the man would succeed if the guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. So, if the guard had no reasonable grounds to suspect this man, then the intentional act would make the assault claim valid. Because even if the guard thought he was acting in good faith, if that belief was unreasonable, the intent for assault is still present.

But wait, in tort law, for assault, the defendant's subjective intent is what matters. So, if the guard genuinely believed he was arresting the right person, even if that belief was unreasonable, does that negate the intent? Or does the reasonableness of the belief affect whether the act was privileged or justified?

I'm a bit confused here. I think that even if the guard had a mistaken belief, as long as he intended to point the gun and cause apprehension, that's enough for assault. Because assault focuses on the intent to cause apprehension, not on whether the underlying reason was valid. The mistake might go to whether there's a defense, like privilege, but in this case, if the guard had no privilege, then the assault stands.

Wait, but in this case, the guard was a security guard. Is there a privilege for mistaken arrests? Like, if someone is making a citizen's arrest, but mistakenly, does that affect the assault claim? Or does the fact that the guard was acting outside his authority make the act of pointing the gun an assault?

Alternatively, the key here is that the guard's act of pulling a gun would constitute an assault if the man reasonably apprehended harm. The issue isn't the guard's intent to arrest, but the intent to create apprehension. So even if the guard thought he was right, the act itself was intentional and caused apprehension, so it's assault.

But wait, another point: did the guard's actions go beyond what's reasonable? Because if he used excessive force, that could be another factor. Option F says success if excessive force was used. But the question doesn't mention whether the force was excessive, just that he pulled a gun and arrested him.

So perhaps the main issue is whether the guard had any justification. If the guard had no reasonable suspicion, then his act of pointing the gun would be an assault. Because the man didn't consent, and there's no privilege if the guard's belief was unreasonable.

So looking back at the options, option C says the claim would succeed if the guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. That makes sense because if the guard had no reasonable grounds, then his intentional act of pointing the gun would constitute assault.

Option E is about whether the man saw the gun. Well, that's a given because the guard approached and pointed the gun. So the man would have seen it, so E might be a correct factor, but it's more about the guard's justification.

Wait, but in the elements of assault, the plaintiff must have a reasonable apprehension. So if the guard's mistake was unreasonable, then perhaps the apprehension is reasonable, which would support the assault claim.

Alternatively, if the guard had a reasonable mistake, then maybe there's a defense. But in this case, the guard's mistake seems clear because the race didn't match. The APB was for a Caucasian, and the guard arrested an African American. That's a significant difference, so the mistake was unreasonable.

So, the guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable, which would mean his actions were not justified. Therefore, the man would succeed in his assault claim.

Looking again, option C says "succeed if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable." That fits because the guard's mistake was unreasonable, so his act of pointing the gun constitutes assault.

Another option, option E, might be technically correct, but I think the more precise answer is C because it's about the reasonableness of the guard's belief, which goes to justification. Without a reasonable belief, the guard's actions can't be justified, making the intentional act of assault valid.

So, I think the correct answer is C.

To determine whether the man can succeed in his assault claim against the security guard, it is essential to analyze the elements of assault and the circumstances of the case. Assault requires an intentional act by the defendant that causes the plaintiff to reasonably apprehend imminent harmful or offensive contact. 

In this scenario, the security guard pulled a gun on the man, which constitutes an intentional act. The man would have reasonably apprehended harm from being held at gunpoint, satisfying the apprehension element. The critical issue is whether the security guard had any justification for his actions. 

The security guard mistakenly believed the man was the bank robbery suspect, but the APB described a Caucasian male, while the man was African American. This significant discrepancy suggests that the guard's belief was unreasonable. If the guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable, he lacked justification for his actions, and the intentional act of pointing the gun would constitute assault.

Option C correctly identifies that the man will succeed if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. This aligns with the principle that a mistaken belief, if unreasonable, does not provide a defense against an assault claim. 

While Option E mentions the man seeing the gun, this is implicit in the scenario, as the guard pointed the gun during the arrest. The more precise determinant is the reasonableness of the guard's belief, as addressed in Option C.
