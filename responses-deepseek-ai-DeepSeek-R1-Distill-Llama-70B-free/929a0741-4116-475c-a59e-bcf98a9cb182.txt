Question:

At the close of all the evidence in a jury trial, Defendant moves for a directed verdict. After much argument, the court denies the motion. Subsequently, the jury returns a verdict for Plaintiff. The day after the jury returns its verdict, the court enters judgment for Plaintiff. One week later, Defendant moves to set aside the verdict and have judgment entered in accordance with its motion for directed verdict. In the motion, Defendant raises arguments that were not raised at trial. Plaintiff's counsel objects to the court even hearing the motion to set aside the verdict. Should the court consider the motion?

Options:

A: No, because the court entered final judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed.
B: Yes, because the court may reconsider its decision on the motion for directed verdict.
C: Yes, because Defendant had ten days after the jury returned its verdict within which to move to set aside the verdict.
D: Yes, because Defendant has the right to appeal the jury's verdict.
E: No, because the motion to set aside the verdict is not timely.
F: No, because the court denied the motion for directed verdict rather than reserving ruling.
G: Yes, because Defendant has raised new grounds.
H: Yes, because the court has the discretion to consider any motion that is relevant to the case.
I: No, because Plaintiff's counsel objects to the motion to set aside the verdict.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question here. It's about a motion to set aside a verdict after a jury trial. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that after all the evidence is presented in a jury trial, the Defendant moves for a directed verdict. The court denies that motion after some arguments. Then the jury returns a verdict for the Plaintiff, and the court enters judgment the next day. A week later, the Defendant files a motion to set aside the verdict and have judgment entered in accordance with their earlier motion for a directed verdict. But here's the catch: in this new motion, the Defendant raises arguments that weren't brought up at trial. The Plaintiff's counsel objects to the court even considering this motion. The question is whether the court should consider the motion.

Hmm, I need to think about the rules regarding post-judgment motions. From what I remember, in federal courts, there's a specific rule about motions for judgment as a matter of law, which replaced the old directed verdict. So, if a party moves for a directed verdict (now called Judgment as a Matter of Law, or JMOL) and the court denies it, the party can renew that motion after the verdict. But there are timing rules.

Wait, I think the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 50 deals with this. So, under Rule 50(b), if a court denies a motion for JMOL, the moving party may renew the motion within 28 days after the entry of the judgment. But there's a catch: the renewed motion can't raise any new grounds that weren't already in the original motion. Because otherwise, the opposing party wouldn't have had a chance to address them at trial.

In this case, the Defendant moved for a directed verdict, which was denied. Then, after the verdict came in, they tried to set aside the verdict and get judgment in their favor, but they added new arguments. So, the Plaintiff's counsel is objecting because these new arguments weren't raised before.

So, the question is whether the court can consider this motion. The options suggest that some are about timeliness, others about the substance.

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, because the court entered final judgment before the motion. But wait, the motion was filed a week after the judgment, which is within the 28-day window, so maybe A isn't right.

Option B: Yes, because the court can reconsider its decision on the directed verdict. But I think the court can only reconsider based on the same arguments, not new ones.

Option C: Yes, because there's a ten-day window. Wait, I thought it was 28 days under Rule 50(b). So if the motion was filed within ten days, maybe. But I'm not sure about the exact timeframe here.

Option D: Yes, because of the right to appeal. But this isn't an appeal; it's a motion in the same court.

Option E: No, because the motion isn't timely. But if it's within 28 days, then E might not be correct.

Option F: No, because the court denied the motion rather than reserving it. I'm not sure about this. I think when a motion for directed verdict is denied, you can renew it post-verdict, but only on the same grounds.

Option G: Yes, because new grounds are raised. But I think that's not allowed. The renewed motion can't add new reasons.

Option H: Yes, because the court has discretion. But the rules might limit that discretion.

Option I: No, because Plaintiff objects. But the objection doesn't determine the court's ability; it's about whether the motion is procedurally proper.

So, putting it together. The key issue is whether the Defendant can raise new arguments in the post-verdict motion. Under Rule 50(b), the renewed motion is only for the grounds stated in the original motion. So new arguments can't be added. Therefore, the court shouldn't consider the motion if it's based on new arguments.

Wait, but the question says the motion raises arguments not raised at trial. So, if those weren't in the original motion for directed verdict, then the court can't consider them now.

So, the court should not consider the motion because the new arguments are not allowed. So which option reflects that?

Looking back, the options:

Option A says no because judgment was entered before the motion. But the motion was filed a week after, which is within the 28-day period, so A is incorrect.

Option E says no because not timely. But a week is timely, so E isn't correct.

Option B says yes because can reconsider. But reconsidering can't include new grounds.

Option F says no because the court denied rather than reserved. I'm not sure about that. I think when a motion is denied, you can renew, but only on same grounds.

So the correct reason would be that the new arguments can't be raised now. So which option addresses that?

Looking again, option G says yes because new grounds. So that's wrong.

Wait, the options don't have an option that directly states that new arguments can't be raised. So perhaps the issue is whether the motion is timely.

Wait, the question is about whether the court should consider the motion. The problem is the new arguments. But the options don't directly address that except in options G and I. Wait, maybe the answer is E, but that's about timeliness.

Wait, alternative approach: the motion to set aside is made under Rule 59, which is for new trials, or under Rule 50 as a renewal. But in this case, the Defendant is moving to set aside the verdict and enter judgment in their favor, which would be a renewal of the directed verdict motion.

Rule 50(b) says that such a renewed motion must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment. If the motion here was one week later, it's timely. But Rule 50(b) also says that the motion can only be based on the grounds stated in the original motion. So if the defendant raises new arguments, the court cannot consider them.

So the court should not consider the new arguments. But the question is whether the court should "consider the motion" at all. The motion includes both the old and new arguments. So would the court refuse the entire motion because of the new arguments, or would it consider only the old ones?

Wait, but the motion is to set aside the verdict and enter judgment, which is the same as renewing the motion for directed verdict. If the defendant includes new arguments that weren't in the original motion, the court can't consider them. So the court would have to deny the motion as to the new arguments, but could consider the old ones if they were properly preserved.

Wait, no. Because the motion to set aside and enter judgment is a single motion. If the defendant adds new reasons, the court may not consider any of it, or perhaps only the original reasons.

But the question is whether the court should consider the motion. I think the court can consider the motion only to the extent it's based on the original grounds. But if the defendant includes new arguments, that part is improper. But the court would still have to consider the motion as to the original grounds, if any.

Wait, but in the question, the defendant's motion is based on new arguments. So the court should not consider the new arguments. But the question is whether the court should consider the motion. So the answer would be no, because the new arguments can't be considered, and perhaps the motion is defective.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: No, judgment entered before motion. But the motion was after judgment, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Yes, court may reconsider. But reconsideration is only on the original grounds.

Option C: Yes, because ten days. If the rule is 28 days, then C is incorrect.

Option E: No, because not timely. But the motion was a week after, so timely. E is incorrect.

Option F: No, because court denied rather than reserved. Wait, if a court reserves ruling on a directed verdict, then the moving party doesn't have to renew it. But if the court denies it outright, then the party must renew within the time limit. So in this case, the court denied the motion, so the defendant can renew, but only on the same grounds.

So if the defendant includes new grounds, the court can't consider them. So the motion is partly defective. But the question is whether the court should consider the motion at all.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the motion to set aside is not the proper vehicle for new arguments. So the court shouldn't entertain the motion because the new arguments weren't raised before. So the answer would be no.

Looking back, the options don't directly state this, but perhaps the correct answer is E, which says no because the motion isn't timely. No, E is about timeliness. But the motion was timely filed.

Wait, perhaps option A is about the timing, but I thought A was incorrect because the judgment was entered before the motion, but the motion can be filed after judgment.

Wait, perhaps the key is that after judgment is entered, the only way to challenge is via a motion for new trial (Rule 59) or a renewal of the JMOL (Rule 50). But the defendant here is moving to set aside the verdict and enter judgment, which I think is a Rule 50 motion.

If the motion is under Rule 50, and it's timely, but includes new arguments, the court can't consider the new arguments. So the motion would be denied as to the new arguments. But the court can consider the old ones. But in this case, the defendant's motion is based on new arguments. So the court shouldn't consider those, but may consider the old ones if they were preserved.

Wait, but the question is whether the court should consider the motion at all. The defendant's motion includes new arguments, so the court would have to strike those parts, but perhaps still consider the motion as to the original grounds. Alternatively, if the defendant didn't include the original grounds, then the motion is defective.

Wait, the question says the motion raises arguments not raised at trial. So perhaps the defendant's original motion for directed verdict had certain arguments, and now they're adding more. So the renewed motion includes both, but the court can only consider the original ones. But if the defendant didn't restate the original arguments, and only added new ones, then the court can't consider any.

But the question is whether the court should consider the motion. Since part of it is improper (the new arguments), but perhaps the rest is proper. But the options don't present that nuance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, which says no because the motion isn't timely. But the scenario says the motion was filed one week after the verdict, which is within the 28-day window. So E is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E is wrong, so the motion is timely. So the court can consider it as to the original grounds, but not the new ones. But the question is whether the court should consider the motion. Since part of it is proper, the court should consider it, but reject the new arguments.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is B: yes, because the court may reconsider its decision on the directed verdict. But reconsideration is only on the original grounds.

Wait, but the defendant's motion includes new arguments, which the court can't consider. So the court can't grant the motion based on the new arguments. But the court can still consider the motion as to the original grounds if they were included.

But the question says that the defendant raises arguments not raised at trial. So perhaps the original motion didn't have those, and the defendant is adding new ones now. So the court cannot consider those new arguments. Therefore, the motion should be denied as to the new arguments, but if the original arguments were included, the court can consider those.

But the question is whether the court should consider the motion. So if the motion is partly proper and partly not, the court would still consider the proper parts. Therefore, the court should consider the motion, but only as to the original grounds.

But looking at the options, option B says yes because the court can reconsider the motion for directed verdict. But that's only on the original grounds.

Wait, but the question is whether the court should consider the motion. Since part of it is based on new arguments, which are not allowed, but perhaps the rest is allowed. So the court should consider the motion, but only to the extent it's based on the original arguments.

But the options don't present that. The options are more about whether the court can consider the motion at all.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the motion to set aside the verdict is not the correct vehicle for new arguments. So the court shouldn't consider the new arguments, but the motion as a whole is still valid as to the original grounds. So the court should consider the motion, but only on the original grounds.

But the options don't capture this. So perhaps the correct answer is B: yes, the court can reconsider its decision on the motion for directed verdict, but only on the same grounds. But the defendant's motion includes new arguments, so the court can't consider those.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, but I thought E was about timeliness, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another angle: the motion to set aside the verdict and enter judgment is made under Rule 50(b), which requires that the motion be made within 28 days and that it can only include the grounds raised in the original motion. So if the defendant's motion includes new arguments, the court cannot consider them, and thus the motion should be denied.

So the court should not consider the motion because the new arguments are impermissible. So the correct answer would be that the court should not consider the motion, which would point to one of the "no" options.

Looking back at the options, option E is about timeliness, but the motion was timely. So E is incorrect.

Option A: no because judgment was entered before. But the motion was after judgment, which is proper, so A is incorrect.

Option F: No, because the court denied the motion rather than reserving ruling. Wait, I think that when a court denies a motion for directed verdict, the moving party must renew the motion post-verdict, but if the court had reserved ruling, maybe the party doesn't have to renew. So in this case, the court denied the motion, so the defendant could renew it, but only on the same grounds. So the court can consider the motion as to the original grounds, but not the new ones. So F says the court shouldn't consider because it was denied, which I think is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the answer is E: No, because the motion to set aside the verdict is not timely. But wait, the motion was filed a week after the verdict, which is within the 28-day period. So E is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall the rules more clearly.

After a jury verdict, a party may move for a judgment as a matter of law (renewing the earlier motion) within 28 days. The renewed motion must be based on the same grounds as the original motion. If the moving party includes new grounds, the court cannot consider them because the opposing party didn't have a chance to address them during trial.

In this case, the defendant's motion includes new arguments. Therefore, the court should not consider those new arguments. But the motion could still be considered as to the original arguments if they were included.

But the question is whether the court should consider the motion at all. Since part of the motion is improper (the new arguments), but the rest might be proper. However, the options don't address partial consideration.

Wait, looking again, option E says no because the motion isn't timely. But the motion was filed a week after the verdict, which is within 28 days. So E is incorrect.

Option A says no because judgment was entered before the motion. But the motion was filed after judgment, which is correct procedure. So A is incorrect.

Option B says yes because the court can reconsider the directed verdict. But reconsideration is allowed, but only on the same grounds. Since the defendant added new grounds, the court can't consider those. So B is incorrect because it implies that the court can reconsider, which it can, but only as to the original grounds.

Option F says no because the court denied the motion. But denial doesn't prevent renewal; in fact, you have to renew after denial. So F is incorrect.

Option G says yes because of new grounds. But new grounds can't be added, so G is incorrect.

Option H says yes because the court has discretion. But the rules limit that discretion. So H is incorrect.

Option I says no because Plaintiff objects. But objections don't determine procedural correctness. So I is incorrect.

Wait, then perhaps the answer is E. But no, E is about timeliness, and the motion was timely.

Wait, I think I'm missing something. Maybe the motion to set aside the verdict and enter judgment is a different type of motion, perhaps under Rule 59 for a new trial or Rule 60 for relief from judgment.

Wait, Rule 59 is for new trials, and Rule 60 is for relief from judgment based on certain grounds like mistake or excusable neglect. Rule 50 is for JMOL.

In this case, the defendant is moving to set aside the verdict and enter judgment, which aligns with Rule 50(b). So the timing is within 28 days, so it's timely.

But the defendant added new arguments. So the court can't consider the new arguments. So the motion should be denied as to the new grounds. But if the original grounds were included, the court could consider those. However, the question says that the defendant's motion raises arguments not raised at trial, implying that the original motion didn't have those.

Wait, perhaps the defendant's original motion for directed verdict only had certain arguments, and now they're adding more. So the court can't consider the new ones, but can consider the old ones if they were renewed.

But the question is whether the court should consider the motion. Since part of it is based on improper grounds, but part is proper, the court would still consider the proper part.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is B: yes, because the court may reconsider its decision on the motion for directed verdict. Because the court can reconsider, but only on the original grounds. So the court should consider the motion as to the original grounds, but not the new ones. Therefore, the answer would be yes, the court should consider the motion, but only as to the original grounds.

But looking at the options, option B says "Yes, because the court may reconsider its decision on the motion for directed verdict." So that would be correct, because the court can reconsider, but only on the same grounds. The defendant's motion includes new grounds, so the court would deny those parts, but still consider the motion as to the old ones.

Wait, but the question is whether the court should consider the motion. The fact that the defendant added new grounds doesn't necessarily mean the court shouldn't consider the entire motion. It just means part of it is without merit. So the court should still consider the motion, but only as to the original arguments
