Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period.
B: No, because the woman sold the tickets before the man could accept the offer.
C: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
D: No, because the man attempted to accept the offer within 15 days of receiving the letter.
E: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
F: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.
G: No, because the man was still within the 15-day period when he went to the woman's home.
H: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
I: Yes, because the woman had already sold the tickets by the time the man went to her home.
J: Yes, because the man attempted to accept the offer after 15 days from the date of the letter.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically regarding the termination of an offer. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is that a woman sent a letter to a man on May 2. The letter is dated May 1, and she's offering to sell him concert tickets. The key points in the letter are that she's selling two tickets at $60 each, which is $10 above face value. She mentions that the concert has been sold out, so it's a good deal. She gives him 15 days from the date of the letter (May 1) to decide whether to accept the offer.

The man receives the letter on May 4 but doesn't read it until May 6. Then, on May 18, he goes to her home to accept the offer. She tells him it's too late because she sold the tickets the previous week for $75 each.

The question is whether the man's power of acceptance was terminated by the lapse of time before he went to her home on May 17. Wait, in the question, he went on May 18, but the options say May 17? Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but I'll proceed with the given dates.

First, I need to recall the rules about offers and their termination. An offer can be terminated in several ways: revocation, counteroffer, rejection, lapse of time, or operation of law. Here, the issue is lapse of time.

The offer was made on May 1, with a 15-day period for acceptance. So the offer should expire on May 16 (since May 1 + 15 days is May 16). But wait, when does the 15-day period start? The letter says "15 days from the above date," which is May 1. So day 1 is May 2, and day 15 would be May 16. So the offer expires at the end of May 16.

But the man received the letter on May 4 and read it on May 6. So when does his acceptance period start? Under the mailbox rule, typically, the offer is considered received when the letter is delivered, which is May 4. But in terms of the time to accept, the offer was valid for 15 days from May 1, regardless of when it's received. So the offer would lapse on May 16.

But wait, another angle: the man didn't read the letter until May 6. Does that affect the start of the 15-day period? I think not, because the offer's time starts from the date it was made, not from when it's received or read. So even if he didn't read it until May 6, the 15 days started on May 1.

So if the man tried to accept on May 18, that would be two days after the offer expired on May 16. Therefore, the offer had lapsed, and he couldn't accept anymore.

Looking at the options:

Option G: No, because the man was still within the 15-day period when he went to the woman's home. Wait, but if the offer expired on May 16, and he went on May 18, that's after. So G would be incorrect.

Option J: Yes, because the man attempted to accept after 15 days from the date of the letter. That seems correct because May 1 +15 days is May 16; he tried on May 18, which is after.

Option A: Yes, because he didn't read it until after 15 days. But the 15 days are from the offer date, so reading late doesn't matter. So A is incorrect.

Option D: No, because he accepted within 15 days of receiving the letter (May 4). But the offer's time is from May 1, not receipt. So D is incorrect.

Option G says he was within the period when he went, but that's not correct because the offer had already lapsed.

So the correct answer would be J, because the man accepted after the 15-day period had passed.

The woman's offer, dated May 1, provided a 15-day acceptance period, meaning the offer would lapse on May 16. The man received the letter on May 4 but did not read it until May 6. However, the 15-day period began on May 1, regardless of when the man read the letter. The man attempted to accept the offer on May 18, which was after the offer had lapsed on May 16. Therefore, the power of acceptance was terminated by the lapse of time.

The correct answer is:

J: Yes, because the man attempted to accept the offer after 15 days from the date of the letter.

Answer: J
