Okay, so I'm looking at this problem here, and I need to figure out the available energy associated with a 10 m³ perfect vacuum and its surroundings. The conditions given are a pressure of 0.100 MPa and a temperature of 300 K. Hmm, available energy... I think that might relate to some thermodynamic concept, maybe like work or exergy?

Wait, a perfect vacuum has zero pressure, right? So the vacuum itself has no energy because there's nothing there. But the surroundings are at 0.100 MPa and 300 K. I remember that when you have a system and surroundings, the available energy might involve the work done during an expansion or something like that.

Oh, right! The work done when a gas expands against a surrounding pressure. But wait, in a vacuum, if the system is a vacuum, expanding into it might not involve any work because the opposing pressure is zero. Or am I mixing things up?

Wait, no. The available energy in this context might refer to the maximum work extractable when the system comes into equilibrium with the surroundings. So maybe it's about the work done when the vacuum is filled by the surrounding environment.

Let me think. The formula for work done during expansion is P_ext * ΔV, but that's when the external pressure is constant. But for a perfect vacuum, the initial pressure is zero, and when the surroundings fill it, the work would be the pressure of the surroundings times the volume change.

Wait, but in this case, the vacuum is expanding into the surroundings, or is it the other way around? Hmm, the vacuum is being filled by the surroundings. So the work would be the external pressure (surroundings) times the volume of the system.

Wait, the system is the vacuum, initially at 0 pressure and volume V. The surroundings are at 0.100 MPa. So when the two come into contact, the surroundings will push into the vacuum until equilibrium is reached.

The maximum work would be the work done when the surroundings push into the vacuum, which would be P_surroundings * V_system.

So the available energy (work) would be P * V. Because the vacuum offers no resistance, right?

But wait, I remember that the formula for work when expanding against a constant external pressure is W = P_ext * V. But in some cases, like when the system is a vacuum, maybe it's considered that the work is zero because internal pressure is zero. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the available energy is calculated using the concept of exergy, which is the maximum work extractable from a system as it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings.

Exergy for a system at pressure P and temperature T in a surrounding at P0 and T0 would involve the exergy equations. But for a vacuum, P = 0, so maybe the exergy is just the flow work.

Wait, for a gas, the flow exergy is P*v (where v is specific volume), but in this case, the system is a vacuum, so maybe it's the pressure times volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The available energy is the work done when the vacuum is filled by the surroundings. So the work would be the pressure of the surroundings multiplied by the volume of the vacuum.

Given that, P is 0.100 MPa, which is 100,000 Pa. Volume is 10 m³.

So W = P * V = 1e5 Pa * 10 m³ = 1e6 J, which is 1,000,000 J or 1,000 kJ.

Looking at the options, F is 1,000 kJ, so that must be the answer.

Wait, but why isn't temperature a factor here? Oh, because in this scenario, perhaps the process is isothermal, or maybe temperature doesn't affect the calculation when considering only the pressure work. Or maybe the question is assuming that the energy is purely from pressure-volume work, not involving thermal energy.

Alternatively, if the process were adiabatic or something, but I think the key here is that the work is simply P_ext * V, since the system's internal pressure is zero.

Yeah, I think that's it. So the answer should be F: 1,000 kJ.

To determine the available energy associated with a 10 m³ perfect vacuum and its surroundings, we consider the work done as the surroundings fill the vacuum. The vacuum initially has zero pressure, and the surroundings are at a pressure of 0.100 MPa (100,000 Pa). The available energy in this context is the maximum work extractable, which is calculated as the product of the surrounding pressure and the volume of the vacuum:

\[
W = P_{\text{surroundings}} \cdot V_{\text{vacuum}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
W = 100,000 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 10 \, \text{m}^3 = 1,000,000 \, \text{J} = 1,000 \, \text{kJ}
\]

Thus, the available energy is 1,000 kJ. The temperature of 300 K does not factor into this calculation because the problem focuses solely on pressure-volume work. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: 1,000 kJ
