Okay, so I have this physics problem here about friction and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question is asking for the coefficient of starting friction. Hmm, right, friction is a force that opposes motion between surfaces. I remember that there are two types of friction coefficients: static (or starting) and kinetic. Static friction is what you need to overcome to get something moving from rest, and kinetic is once it's already moving.

The problem states that a force of 343 Newtons is required to start moving a mass of 50 kilograms on a rough surface. So we need to find the coefficient of static friction, which I'll call μs.

I think the formula for friction is F = μ * m * g, where F is the frictional force, m is mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Oh wait, right, g is about 9.8 m/s².

Wait, but wait, the problem is giving me the force required to start moving, which should be the maximum static friction force. So in that case, F equals the force applied, which is 343 N. So I can rearrange the formula to solve for μs.

Let me write that down. So μs is F divided by (m times g). Plugging the numbers in, that would be 343 N divided by (50 kg * 9.8 m/s²).

Calculating the denominator first: 50 times 9.8 is 490. So 343 divided by 490 equals... let me do that division. Hmm, 343 ÷ 490. Well, I know 343 is 7^3, 7*7*7 is 343. 490 is 49*10, and 49 is 7². So 343/490 is (7^3)/(7^2 *10) )= 7/(10) = 0.7. Oh wait, that's exactly 0.7.

So μs is 0.7. Now looking at the options, option H is 0.70. So the answer should be H.

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. The formula is correct, F=μmg, so μ=F/(mg). Yep, I used the right values. 50 kg times 9.8 is 490. 343 divided by 490 is 0.7. So yes, I think that's correct.

To determine the coefficient of starting friction (μs), we use the formula for static friction:

\[
F = \mu_s \cdot m \cdot g
\]

Rearranging to solve for μs:

\[
\mu_s = \frac{F}{m \cdot g}
\]

Given:
- \( F = 343 \, \text{N} \)
- \( m = 50 \, \text{kg} \)
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
m \cdot g = 50 \cdot 9.8 = 490
\]

Now divide the force by this value:

\[
\mu_s = \frac{343}{490} = 0.7
\]

Thus, the coefficient of starting friction is 0.70, which corresponds to option H.
