Question:

A developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural part of the county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. The franchise right created for public utilitycompanies would most likely be an example of a(an)

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about real property law, specifically dealing with easements and covenants. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a developer who owns several hundred acres and has a general development plan. The plan includes certain restrictions that apply to all future lot owners, their heirs, assigns, and lessees. The specific restriction in question is number 22 and 23. 

Looking at the details, restriction 22 says there's a franchise right created in a 10-foot strip along the rear of each lot for public utility companies, with the right of ingress and egress. Restriction 23 prohibits building any house or structure on that strip.

The question is asking what this franchise right is an example of. The options are various real property terms like restrictive covenant, license, real covenant, etc.

First, I need to understand what each of these terms means. 

An easement is a right to use another's land for a specific purpose. It can be appurtenant (benefiting a particular piece of land) or in gross (benefiting a person or company, not tied to land ownership). A profit à prendre is a right to take something from the land, like minerals or timber.

Restrictive covenants are agreements that limit the use of land. They can be enforceable as equitable servitudes if they meet certain criteria, like being in writing and touching the land.

So, the franchise right here is for public utility companies. They have the right to use a 10-foot strip. This sounds like an easement because it's a right to use someone else's land. Since it's for a utility company, which isn't tied to a specific parcel of land (they serve multiple areas), it's likely an easement in gross. 

Wait, but let me think. Easements in gross are typically personal, like for a business. For example, utility easements are usually easements in gross because the benefit isn't tied to a specific piece of land but to the company itself. So that makes sense here.

Alternatively, a restrictive covenant would be a limitation on how the land is used, like saying you can't build a certain type of structure. Here, restriction 23 is a restrictive covenant because it prohibits building on the strip. But restriction 22 is about the right of use, which is more of an easement.

So the franchise right in the strip is an easement in gross. That would make option G the correct answer.

Wait, could it be an appurtenant easement? No, because appurtenant easements benefit a particular parcel of land. Here, it's for utility companies, which serve multiple properties, not just one. So it's in gross.

Another thought—could it be a profit à prendre? No, because that's about taking resources, not using the land for passage or utilities.

So yes, I think the answer is G: easement in gross.
</think>

The franchise right described in the question is a right granted to public utility companies to use a specific strip of land for their operations, such as laying cables or maintaining equipment. This type of right allows the utility company to access and use the land, but it does not grant them ownership. Since the right is not tied to a specific parcel of land but rather benefits the utility company as an entity, it is not an appurtenant easement. Instead, it is an easement in gross, which benefits a person or entity rather than a particular piece of land.

Among the options provided:

- **A: Restrictive covenant** and **D: Equitable servitude** are incorrect because these terms refer to limitations on the use of land, not a right to use the land.
- **B: License** is incorrect because a license is typically revocable and does not create a long-term right.
- **C: Real covenant** is incorrect because it refers to agreements that run with the land, which is not the case here.
- **E: Covenant running with the land** is incorrect for the same reason as above.
- **F: Profit à prendre** is incorrect because it refers to the right to take resources from the land, which is not the situation here.
- **G: Easement in gross** is correct because it accurately describes a right to use land for a specific purpose that benefits a person or entity, not a specific parcel of land.
- **H: Allodial title** is incorrect because it refers to absolute ownership of land, which is unrelated.
- **I: Easement appurtenant** is incorrect because it benefits a specific parcel of land, which is not the case here.

The correct answer is **G: easement in gross**.
