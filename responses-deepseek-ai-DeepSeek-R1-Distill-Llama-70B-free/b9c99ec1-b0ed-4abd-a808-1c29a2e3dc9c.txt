Question:

Milgram (1965) found that participants in his study were more willing to administer electric shocks to another person when they couldn't see the victim and the victim couldn't see them. This ﬁnding is predicted by Zimbardo’s notion of:

Options:

A: bystander effect.
B: conformity.
C: psychological reactance.
D: self-perception.
E: self-verification.
F: groupthink.
G: deindividuation.
H: social facilitation.
I: cognitive dissonance.
J: pluralistic ignorance.

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about psychology, specifically about some studies done by Milgram and Zimbardo. Hmm, I remember Milgram's study was about obedience. Oh right, where participants were asked to administer electric shocks to another person, and they often went along with it even when they seemed uncomfortable. But wait, the question is about a specific finding from Milgram's 1965 study. The question says that participants were more willing to give shocks when they couldn't see the victim and the victim couldn't see them. So, when there's no visual contact, they were more likely to comply.

Now, the question is linking this finding to Zimbardo's notion. I need to think about what Zimbardo is known for. Oh yeah, Zimbardo did the Stanford Prison Experiment, right? And he also talked about the concept of deindividuation. Deindividuation refers to the loss of self-awareness and a sense of anonymity, which can lead people to behave in ways they normally wouldn't because they don't feel as responsible for their actions.

Wait, but let me think again. Milgram's finding here is about the visibility between the participant and the victim. When they can't see each other, the participant is more likely to administer the shocks. So, this seems related to the idea that when people are anonymous or can't be identified, they might act more aggressively or less morally. That sounds a lot like deindividuation.

But wait, another concept is the bystander effect, which is when people are less likely to help someone in distress when there are others around. No, that doesn't fit here because this is about administering shocks, not failing to help. So bystander effect is probably option A, which I can eliminate.

Conformity is about going along with a group, but this scenario is more about the lack of visibility leading to a change in behavior. So B, conformity, might not be the best fit.

Psychological reactance (C) is about reacting against a restriction, which doesn't fit here. Self-perception (D) is when people infer their attitudes from their behavior, which doesn't directly apply. Self-verification (E) is about confirming one's self-concept, not sure how that fits. Groupthink (F) is about groups making irrational decisions, but this is an individual behavior in the study.

Social facilitation (H) is when the presence of others enhances performance, but again, this is about obedience and aggression, not performance. Cognitive dissonance (I) is about conflicting beliefs causing discomfort, but that's not directly related here. Pluralistic ignorance (J) is when people assume others know more, leading to inaction, which again doesn't fit.

So putting it all together, the key here is that when the participant and victim can't see each other, the participant feels more anonymous. This lack of visibility reduces their sense of individuality and responsibility, leading them to act in ways they normally wouldn't. That's deindividuation, which is Zimbardo's concept. So the answer should be G.

The question asks about Milgram's finding that participants were more willing to administer electric shocks when they couldn't see the victim and vice versa, and how this relates to Zimbardo's notion. Milgram's study showed that reduced visibility between the participant and the victim increased obedience, likely because it made participants feel more anonymous and less accountable for their actions. This aligns with Zimbardo's concept of deindividuation, which refers to the loss of self-awareness and a sense of anonymity that can lead to behaviors people wouldn't normally engage in. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Bystander effect** refers to people failing to help in groups, which is irrelevant here.
- **B: Conformity** involves group influence, not the anonymity in this scenario.
- **C: Psychological reactance** is about reacting against restrictions, which doesn't fit.
- **D: Self-perception** and **E: Self-verification** are about inferring or confirming self-concepts, not relevant.
- **F: Groupthink** involves irrational group decisions, not individual behavior in this context.
- **G: Deindividuation** matches the scenario, as it explains how reduced visibility leads to diminished responsibility and altered behavior.
- **H: Social facilitation** pertains to performance enhancement, not obedience or aggression.
- **I: Cognitive dissonance** involves conflicting beliefs, which isn't applicable.
- **J: Pluralistic ignorance** refers to assuming others know more, leading to inaction, which doesn't fit.

The correct answer is **G: deindividuation**, as it directly explains the behavior observed in Milgram's study.

Answer: G
