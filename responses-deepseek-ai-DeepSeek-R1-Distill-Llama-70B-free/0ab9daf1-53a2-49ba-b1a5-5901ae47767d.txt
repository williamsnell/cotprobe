Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says: If two fruit flies, heterozygous for genes of one allelic pair, were bred together and had 200 offspring... So both parents are heterozygotes. Let me think about what that means. I remember that heterozygous means they have two different alleles for a gene. Like, maybe one from each parent—so if the gene is, say, A and a, then each parent is Aa.

Part (a) asks about how many would have the dominant phenotype. I think this is a standard Mendelian genetics problem. When two heterozygotes mate (Aa x Aa), what's the expected phenotypic ratio? From what I remember, the cross would produce a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes. So out of four possible outcomes, three are dominant. 

Wait, let me visualize the Punnett square. Aa x Aa gives AA, Aa, aA, and aa. But since Aa and aA are the same (because alleles are just different forms), the actual genotypes are AA (25%), Aa (50%), and aa (25%). Phenotypically, AA and Aa would show the dominant trait, assuming A is dominant. So that's 75% dominant and 25% recessive.

So with 200 offspring, 75% of them would be dominant. Let me calculate that: 0.75 * 200 = 150. So part (a) should have 150 offspring showing the dominant phenotype.

Now part (b) says: Of these offspring, some will be homozygous dominant and some heterozygous. How can we tell which is which? Hmm. So among the 150 dominant phenotype flies, there are two genotypes: homozygous (AA) and heterozygous (Aa). How do you distinguish between them?

I remember that one common method is a test cross. A test cross is when you cross an individual with a recessive phenotype to see what their genotype is. Wait, no, the test cross is when you cross with a recessive individual. Because when you do that, the recessive will contribute only the recessive allele, so the offspring will reveal the genotype of the other parent.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I have a fly that shows the dominant phenotype. It could be AA or Aa. If I cross it with a recessive (aa) fly, what happens?

- If the fly is AA (homozygous), all offspring would be Aa, showing dominant.
- If the fly is Aa (heterozygous), the offspring would be 50% Aa (dominant) and 50% aa (recessive).

So by doing a test cross (with a recessive), you can determine the genotype based on the offspring's phenotypes. So the method is a test cross.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. Part (a) is 150 dominant, part (b) uses a test cross.

Looking at the options:

A: 100, complementation test – no, complementation is for different genes, not same gene.

B: 200, self cross – wait, self cross is when same individual, but fruit flies can't self-fertilize. Also, 200 is the total, not the dominant.

C: 175, self cross – same issue, and 175 isn't 75% of 200.

D: 150, reciprocal cross – reciprocal is same as test cross maybe? Or is reciprocal cross swapping the sexes. Not sure. Test cross is more specific.

E:50, test cross – no, 50 is 25% which is recessive.

F:125, back cross – back cross is crossing with parent, but parents are Aa. Maybe, but not sure.

Wait, back cross is when you cross with a parent or an organism that's not necessarily recessive. Test cross is specifically with a recessive.

So part (a) is 150, part (b) is test cross. Looking for an option where (a) is 150 and (b) uses test cross.

Looking at the options:

Option I: 150, test cross. So that's I.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option I says: 150, test cross. So that's the answer.

Another option, E is 50, test cross. But 50 is the number of recessive. So no.

So the correct answer is I.

To solve the question, we analyze the genetic cross and the methods used to determine genotypes.

1. **Part (a):** Both parents are heterozygous (Aa) for a single allelic pair. Crossing two heterozygotes (Aa x Aa) results in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of dominant to recessive traits. This is derived from the Punnett square, where the genotypes are 25% AA (homozygous dominant), 50% Aa (heterozygous), and 25% aa (homozygous recessive). Phenotypically, AA and Aa both show the dominant trait. Thus, 75% of the offspring will exhibit the dominant phenotype. For 200 offspring, this equals \( 0.75 \times 200 = 150 \).

2. **Part (b):** Among the 150 offspring with the dominant phenotype, some are homozygous dominant (AA) and others are heterozygous (Aa). To distinguish between these genotypes, a **test cross** is used. A test cross involves crossing an individual of unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive individual (aa). The offspring of this cross reveal the genotype:
   - If the unknown individual is AA, all offspring will be Aa (dominant).
   - If the unknown individual is Aa, the offspring will be 50% Aa (dominant) and 50% aa (recessive).

Thus, the correct answer is the option where (a) 150 offspring have the dominant phenotype and (b) a test cross is used to distinguish genotypes.

**Correct Answer:** I: 150, test cross.
