Question:

In the Harlow study of emotional attachment, infant monkeys were placed in a cage and given both a "wire" mother and a "cloth" mother. Researchers then moved a bottle of milk from one mother to the other while introducing various stimuli to see if the monkeys would form an attachment to either of the "mothers." In this experiment, the independent variable is

Options:

A: the type of stimuli introduced to the monkeys
B: with which "mother" the bottle of milk is placed
C: the gender of the infant monkeys
D: the amount of milk in the bottle
E: the type of material used to create the "mothers"
F: the "wire" mother versus the "cloth" mother
G: the age of the infant monkeys
H: the time of day the milk bottle was moved
I: the preference of the infants for the source of milk
J: the preference of the infants for the "wire" mother

Okay, so I've got this question about the Harlow study on emotional attachment in monkeys. I remember that Harlow did some experiments with monkeys and these "mother" figures made of wire and cloth. The question is about identifying the independent variable in the experiment.

First, I need to recall what an independent variable is. From what I remember, the independent variable is the factor that the researcher manipulates or changes on purpose to see how it affects the outcome. It's the variable under the control of the experimenter.

In the Harlow study, the setup was that infant monkeys were given two options: a wire mother and a cloth mother. I think one provided food (like a milk bottle) and the other didn't, or maybe one was warm. Wait, no, in the experiment, both might have provided something. Oh right, I think the wire mother had the milk, and the cloth mother was soft but didn't provide milk. Or was it the other way around? Hmm, maybe it varied in different experiments.

Wait, the question says that the bottle of milk was moved from one mother to the other. So the initial setup had the milk with one, and then they moved it. So the variable here would be whether the milk is with the wire or the cloth mother. Because that's what they're changing to see the effect on the monkeys' attachment.

So the dependent variable would be the monkeys' preferenceâ€”like which mother they cling to more or spend more time with. But the question is about the independent variable, which is the factor the researchers are manipulating.

Looking at the options:

Option B says "with which 'mother' the bottle of milk is placed." That sounds like it's the variable being changed. Because moving the milk bottle from one to the other is the action they take.

Option E is about the material (wire vs cloth), but that's more the setup, not what's being manipulated during the experiment. The materials are the two types of mothers, but the independent variable is which one gets the milk.

Option F is "the 'wire' mother versus the 'cloth' mother." That's more of the two alternatives presented, but not the variable being manipulated each time. Because the setup includes both, but the variable is where the milk is placed.

So the independent variable would be whether the milk is with the wire or the cloth mother. So that's option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says that the researchers moved the bottle while introducing various stimuli. So maybe the stimuli are the independent variable? That would be option A. But no, because the introduction of stimuli is part of the procedure, but the main variable is the placement of the milk. Because moving the milk is what they're doing to see the effect on attachment.

Wait, no, the question says that the bottle was moved while introducing various stimuli. Hmm. So maybe the stimuli are the independent variable. Or perhaps the movement of the milk is.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the experiment. The initial setup had the monkeys with both mothers. The wire mother gave food, the cloth didn't. Then in some variations, they might switch which one gives food. So the independent variable here is the association of each mother with the food. So the variable is which mother is providing the food (milk), which is the placement of the bottle.

So the correct answer should be B: with which "mother" the bottle is placed.

The Harlow study investigated emotional attachment by presenting infant monkeys with a "wire" mother and a "cloth" mother. The experiment involved manipulating the placement of a milk bottle between these two figures to observe the monkeys' attachment behavior. The independent variable is the factor that researchers intentionally manipulate to observe its effect on the outcome. In this case, the researchers moved the milk bottle between the wire and cloth mothers to assess how this change influenced the monkeys' preferences and attachment.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** ("with which 'mother' the bottle of milk is placed") directly reflects the manipulation of placing the milk bottle with one mother or the other, which is the independent variable.
- Other options, such as the type of stimuli (A) or the materials of the mothers (E), describe aspects of the experiment but are not the variable being manipulated.

Thus, the independent variable is the placement of the milk bottle with either the wire or cloth mother.

Answer: B
