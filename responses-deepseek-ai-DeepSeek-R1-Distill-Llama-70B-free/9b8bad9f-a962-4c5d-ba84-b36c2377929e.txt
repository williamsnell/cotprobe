Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about blood types in a village. Hmm, I remember that blood types are determined by alleles, specifically the ABO system. The question gives me the gene frequencies and asks me to calculate the number of individuals with each blood type. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the gene frequencies are for A, B, and O alleles. Oh wait, O is the recessive one. The frequencies are 0.95 for A, 0.04 for B, and 0.01 for O. Wait, wait a minute, do these add up to 1? Let me check: 0.95 + 0.04 is 0.99, plus 0.01 makes 1.0. Okay, that makes sense because all allele frequencies should add up to 1 in a population.

So the population is 424 people. I guess I need to calculate the genotype frequencies and then apply them to the population size. Blood type is determined by two alleles, so the possible genotypes are AA, AO, BB, BO, OO, AB. But wait, the blood types are phenotypes. The ABO blood types are A, B, AB, and O.

Right, the blood type O has genotype OO. Type A can be AA or AO. Type B is BB or BO. And AB is only AB. So I need to calculate each.

I remember the Hardy-Weinberg principle here because it's about genotype frequencies in a population. The formula is p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele, q the other. But wait, in this case, we have three alleles, so it's a bit more complicated. Oh right, for ABO, each person has two alleles, but there are three possible alleles: A, B, O.

So the frequencies are:
p = frequency of A = 0.95
q = frequency of B = 0.04
r = frequency of O = 0.01

Wait, but usually, the sum of p + q + r should be 1. Let me check: 0.95 + 0.04 is 0.99, plus 0.01 is 1. So that's correct.

The Hardy-Weinberg for three alleles expands to calculate genotype frequencies. The possible genotypes are:

- AA: p^2
- AO: 2pr
- BB: q^2
- BO: 2qr
- OO: r^2
- AB: 2pq

Wait, wait no, I think I might have mixed up some terms. Let me think again. The possible genotypes are all combinations. So for A, B, and O alleles, the possible diploid genotypes are:

AA, Aa (like AO), BB, Bb (like BO), OO, AB.

Wait, no, since O is recessive, AO and BO are actually phenotypes. So for the genotype frequencies, AB is 2pq, AO is 2pr, BO is 2qr, and OO is r^2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all possible genotype frequencies. Each person has two alleles, so all possible combinations are:

AA, AB, AO, BB, BO, OO.

Wait no, AO is the same as OA. So the possible genotypes are:

- AA: frequency p^2
- AO: 2pr
- BB: q^2
- BO: 2qr
- OO: r^2
- AB: 2pq

Wait, but AB is a separate genotype, right? Because it's when someone has A and B alleles. So the frequencies would be:

AA: p² → (0.95)^2
AO: 2pr → 2*(0.95)(0.01)
BB: q² → (0.04)^2
BO: 2qr → 2*(0.04)(0.01)
OO: r² → (0.01)^2
AB: 2pq → 2*(0.95)(0.04)

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So for each possible combination, considering all three alleles, the Hardy-Weinberg equations are a bit more involved than the two-allele case. But I think the approach is correct.

Let me calculate each genotype's frequency.

First, AA: p squared is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

AO: 2 * p * r → 2 * 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.019.

BB: q squared → 0.04 * 0.04 = 0.0016.

BO: 2 * q * r → 2 * 0.04 * 0.01 = 0.0008.

OO: r squared → 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.0001.

AB: 2 * p * q → 2 * 0.95 * 0.04 = 0.076.

Wait, but let me add all these genotype frequencies to make sure they sum to 1.

0.9025 + 0.019 = 0.9215
plus 0.0016 is 0.9231
plus 0.0008 is 0.9239
plus 0.0001 is 0.924
plus 0.076 is 0.924 + 0.076 = 1.000. Oh wait, yes, 0.9025 + 0.019 is 0.9215. Then 0.0016 brings it to 0.9231. 0.0008 brings to 0.9239. 0.0001 → 0.924. Then 0.076 brings to 1.000. So that adds up correctly.

Now, each genotype corresponds to a specific blood type.

- AA → blood type A
- AO → blood type A
- BB → blood type B
- BO → blood type B
- OO → blood type O
- AB → blood type AB

So the blood type A includes AA and AO. Blood type B includes BB and BO. Blood type AB is only AB, and O is only OO.

So let's calculate the blood type frequencies:

Type A: AA + AO → 0.9025 + 0.019 = 0.9215.

Type B: BB + BO → 0.0016 + 0.0008 = 0.0024.

Type AB: 0.076.

Type O: 0.0001.

Now, let's convert these frequencies into numbers of people by multiplying by the population size (424).

Type O: 0.0001 * 424 = 0.0424. Since you can't have a fraction of a person, this would be approximately 0 individuals. But wait, sometimes it rounds to 1, depending on the exact calculation.

Wait, 0.0424 * 424 → 0.0424 * 424. Let me compute that. 424 * 0.0001 is 0.0424. So 0.0424 is about 0.04, which is less than half, so it would be 0. So O would be 0 people.

Wait, but let me compute each blood type:

Type O: 424 * 0.0001 = 0.0424 → 0 individuals.

Type A: 424 * 0.9215 → Let's calculate that. 424 * 0.9 = 381.6. 424 * 0.0215 = let's see, 424 * 0.02 is 8.48, 424 * 0.0015 is 0.636. So 8.48 + 0.636 = 9.116. So 381.6 +9.116 = 390.716. So approximately 391 people.

Type B: 424 * 0.0024 = 1.0176 → approximately 1 person.

Type AB: 424 * 0.076 → let's compute that. 424 * 0.07 = 29.68. 424 * 0.006 = 2.544. So 29.68 + 2.544 = 32.224. So approximately 32 people.

So the numbers would be:

O: 0

A: 391

B: 1

AB: 32

Looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option B says O=1, A=391, B=0, AB=32. No, because our B is 1.

Option H says O=0, A=391, B=1, AB=32. That matches exactly. So H is the correct option.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Did I make any mistakes?

Wait, let me recalculate the blood type A. 0.9215 *424.

Alternatively, multiply 424 by each component.

AA: 0.9025 *424 = let's compute 0.9 *424 = 381.6, 0.0025*424=1.06 → 382.66.

AO: 0.019 *424 = approx 8.056.

So AA is 382.66, AO is 8.056 → total A is 382.66 +8.056 = 390.716 → 391.

Type B: BB is 0.0016 *424= 0.6784, BO is 0.0008 *424=0.3392. Total B is 0.6784 +0.3392 =1.0176 → 1 person.

AB: 0.076 *424=32.224 → 32.

O: 0.0001 *424=0.0424 → 0.

So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option H is O=0, A=391, B=1, AB=32.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking:

Option H: O=0, A=391, B=1, AB=32.

Yes. So the correct answer is H.

To solve the problem, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate genotype frequencies based on the given allele frequencies for A, B, and O: \( p = 0.95 \), \( q = 0.04 \), and \( r = 0.01 \). The genotype frequencies are as follows:

- \( AA: p^2 = 0.95^2 = 0.9025 \)
- \( AO: 2pr = 2(0.95)(0.01) = 0.019 \)
- \( BB: q^2 = 0.04^2 = 0.0016 \)
- \( BO: 2qr = 2(0.04)(0.01) = 0.0008 \)
- \( OO: r^2 = 0.01^2 = 0.0001 \)
- \( AB: 2pq = 2(0.95)(0.04) = 0.076 \)

Next, we calculate the blood type frequencies by grouping genotypes into phenotypes:

- **Type A**: \( AA + AO = 0.9025 + 0.019 = 0.9215 \)
- **Type B**: \( BB + BO = 0.0016 + 0.0008 = 0.0024 \)
- **Type AB**: \( AB = 0.076 \)
- **Type O**: \( OO = 0.0001 \)

We then convert these frequencies into the number of individuals by multiplying by the population size (\( N = 424 \)):

- **Type O**: \( 0.0001 \times 424 = 0.0424 \), rounded to 0 individuals.
- **Type A**: \( 0.9215 \times 424 = 390.716 \), rounded to 391 individuals.
- **Type B**: \( 0.0024 \times 424 = 1.0176 \), rounded to 1 individual.
- **Type AB**: \( 0.076 \times 424 = 32.224 \), rounded to 32 individuals.

Thus, the numbers of individuals with each blood type are:

- **O**: 0
- **A**: 391
- **B**: 1
- **AB**: 32

Comparing these results to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: O = 0, A = 391, B = 1, AB = 32**
