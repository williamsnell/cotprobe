Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the absolute minimum value of the function f(x,y) = x² + y², subject to the constraint x² + 2y² = 1. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with optimization problems with constraints, one common method is to use Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, I could try substitution since there are two variables and two equations (the function and the constraint). Let me think about both approaches.

First, let's try the substitution method. The constraint is x² + 2y² =1. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into f(x,y). Let's solve for x²: x² = 1 - 2y². Then substitute this into f(x,y) = x² + y², which gives (1 - 2y²) + y² = 1 - y². So f(x,y) becomes 1 - y². Wait, but I want to minimize this. Since y² is always non-negative, the maximum value of 1 - y² would be 1 (when y=0), and it can get smaller as y² increases. But what's the minimum of 1 - y²? Oh, wait, that depends on how big y² can get. Let's look back at the constraint.

The constraint is x² + 2y² =1. Since x² must be non-negative, 2y² ≤1 → y² ≤1/2. So y² can be at most 0.5. So substituting back, the minimum of f is 1 - (1/2) = 0.5. So the minimum value is 0.5, which is option E.

Wait, but another approach using Lagrange multipliers might help confirm this. Let's set up the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is L = x² + y² - λ(x² + 2y² -1). Taking partial derivatives:

Partial L with respect to x: 2x - λ*2x =0 → 2x(1 - λ) =0.
Partial L with respect to y: 2y - λ*4y =0 → 2y(1 - 2λ) =0.
Partial L with respect to λ: -(x² + 2y² -1) =0 → x² + 2y²=1.

From the first equation, either x=0 or λ=1.

Case 1: x=0. Then from the constraint, 0 + 2y²=1 → y²=1/2 → y=±√(1/2). Then f(x,y)=0 + (1/2)=0.5.

Case 2: λ=1. Then from the second equation: 2y(1 - 2*1)=0 → 2y(-1)=0 → y=0. Then from the constraint, x² +0=1 → x=±1. Then f(x,y)=1 +0=1.

So comparing the two cases, f=0.5 in case 1 and f=1 in case 2. So the minimum is 0.5, which matches the substitution method.

So the answer should be E: 0.5.

To find the absolute minimum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 = 1 \), we can use the method of substitution.

1. **Substitution Method**:  
   From the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 = 1 \), solve for \( x^2 \):  
   \[
   x^2 = 1 - 2y^2
   \]  
   Substitute this into \( f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \):  
   \[
   f(x,y) = (1 - 2y^2) + y^2 = 1 - y^2
   \]  
   To minimize \( f(x,y) = 1 - y^2 \), note that \( y^2 \geq 0 \). The maximum value of \( y^2 \) is determined by the constraint:  
   \[
   2y^2 \leq 1 \implies y^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}
   \]  
   Thus, the minimum value of \( f(x,y) \) is:  
   \[
   f_{\text{min}} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Verification Using Lagrange Multipliers**:  
   Define the Lagrangian:  
   \[
   \mathcal{L} = x^2 + y^2 - \lambda(x^2 + 2y^2 - 1)
   \]  
   Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:  
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 2x - 2\lambda x = 0 \implies x(1 - \lambda) = 0 \tag{1}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 2y - 4\lambda y = 0 \implies y(1 - 2\lambda) = 0 \tag{2}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = -(x^2 + 2y^2 - 1) = 0 \implies x^2 + 2y^2 = 1 \tag{3}
   \]  

   - **Case 1**: \( x = 0 \)  
     From the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 = 1 \), we get \( 2y^2 = 1 \implies y^2 = \frac{1}{2} \).  
     Substituting into \( f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \):  
     \[
     f(0, \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}) = 0 + \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

   - **Case 2**: \( \lambda = 1 \)  
     From \( y(1 - 2\lambda) = 0 \), we get \( y = 0 \).  
     From the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 = 1 \), we get \( x^2 = 1 \implies x = \pm 1 \).  
     Substituting into \( f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \):  
     \[
     f(\pm 1, 0) = 1 + 0 = 1
     \]

   Comparing the two cases, the minimum value of \( f(x,y) \) is \( 0.5 \).

Thus, the absolute minimum value of \( f(x,y) \) is **0.5**, corresponding to option **E**.
