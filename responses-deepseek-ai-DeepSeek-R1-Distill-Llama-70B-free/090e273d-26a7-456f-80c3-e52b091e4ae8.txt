Okay, so I've got this question about alternators and their speeds and poles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrical engineering, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, part (a) says: A 60-cycle alternator has 2 poles. What's the speed? I remember that the relationship between the frequency (in cycles), the number of poles, and the speed (in rpm) is connected by a formula. Let me think... Oh right, the formula is something like frequency (f) equals (number of poles (P) times speed (N)) divided by 120. So f = (P * N) / 120. Wait, I think that's right. So if I rearrange that to solve for N, it would be N = (f * 120) / P.

So for part (a), f is 60 cycles, P is 2. Plugging in the numbers: N = (60 * 120) / 2. Let me do the math: 60 times 120 is 7200. Divided by 2 is 3600. So the speed is 3600 rpm. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Wait, is the formula f = (P*N)/120 or (N*P)/120? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's correct because when the number of poles increases, the speed decreases for the same frequency. So 2 poles would spin faster than 4 poles, for example.

Now part (b): A 60-cycle alternator has a speed of 120 rpm. How many poles does it have? Using the same formula. So rearranging to find P, P = (f * 120) / N. Here, f is 60, N is 120. So P = (60 * 120) / 120. Let's compute that: 60 times 120 is 7200, divided by 120 is 60. So P equals 60 poles. Wait, that seems high. Alternators with 60 poles? I thought typical numbers are lower, like 2, 4, 6, maybe up to 24. But I guess it's possible. So 60 poles would mean a higher number of phases or something. Hmm, but let me double-check the calculation. (60 * 120) is indeed 7200. 7200 divided by 120 is 60. So yeah, 60 poles.

Now looking at the options. Let's see each option has two parts, (a) and (b). My answers for (a) is 3600 rpm, and (b) is 60 poles. Let me scan the options:

Option F says (a) 3600 rpm, (b) 60 poles. That fits my calculations. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait a second, but waitâ€”did I get the formula right? Another version I remember is N = 120f / P. Oh yes, that's the same as I used. So if f is 60, N would be (120 * 60)/2 for part (a), which is 3600. And for part (b), P = (120 * 60)/120 = 60. Yep, that's correct.

So I'm confident the answer is option F.

The problem involves determining the speed and number of poles of an alternator using the relationship between frequency (f), speed (N), and number of poles (P), given by the formula:

\[
f = \frac{P \cdot N}{120} \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad N = \frac{f \cdot 120}{P} \quad \text{and} \quad P = \frac{f \cdot 120}{N}.
\]

### Part (a):
For a 60-cycle alternator with 2 poles, the speed is calculated as:
\[
N = \frac{f \cdot 120}{P} = \frac{60 \cdot 120}{2} = 3600 \, \text{rpm}.
\]

### Part (b):
For a 60-cycle alternator operating at 120 rpm, the number of poles is calculated as:
\[
P = \frac{f \cdot 120}{N} = \frac{60 \cdot 120}{120} = 60 \, \text{poles}.
\]

### Matching with Options:
The calculated values are:
- (a) 3600 rpm
- (b) 60 poles

These match **Option F**.
