Question:

A defendant was smoking marijuana as he was driving home from work one afternoon. A police officer approached him on the freeway and stopped the car to issue a citation for speeding. As the defendant handed the officer his driver's license, the officer smelled burnt marijuana, saw the joint, and saw an open envelope on the seat next to the defendant containing a substance that looked like marijuana. The officer ordered the defendant out of the car, arrested him for unlawful possession of marijuana. The officer then searched the defendant and found a sealed envelope in the defendant's back pocket. Without asking the defendant's permission, the officer opened the envelope and discovered that it contained cocaine. The officer then unzipped one of the jacket pockets on the jacket the defendant was wearing and found more cocaine and arrested the defendant for possession of cocaine. The defendant was taken to the police station and immediately escorted to an interrogation room. He was given his Miranda warnings, waived his rights, and gave a statement admitting to possession of cocaine and marijuana. Which of the following is a correct statement of the applicable legal principles regarding the search of the defendant?

Options:

A: Any evidence found in the possession of the defendant is admissible, regardless of how it was obtained.
B: One who drives an automobile on a public highway does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy.
C: If an officer smells marijuana, they are automatically allowed to search the entire vehicle and the person.
D: The defendant must give explicit permission for the officer to search their personal belongings, even after an arrest has been made.
E: If an individual effectively consents to a search of their person, the evidence gathered during the search is admissible.
F: The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unlawful searches and seizures, making the search and the evidence inadmissible.
G: The officer is not permitted to search personal items found on the defendant after the arrest without a warrant.
H: The exclusionary rule requires that if an officer conducts an unconstitutional search, the evidence acquired in the course of the officer's subsequent activities is inadmissible.
I: The officer is only allowed to search the defendant after they have been formally charged with a crime.
J: When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an individual, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the person of the individual.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure and the Fourth Amendment, which deals with searches and seizures. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

The scenario is about a defendant who was driving and smoking marijuana. A police officer stops him for speeding. When the defendant hands over his license, the officer smells burnt marijuana, sees a joint, and sees an open envelope with what looks like marijuana. The officer then arrests him for possession of marijuana. Then, the officer searches him and finds a sealed envelope in his back pocket. The officer opens it without permission and finds cocaine. He also unzips a jacket pocket and finds more cocaine. 

So, the question is about the legal principles regarding the search. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall the relevant legal principles. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. When a police officer makes a lawful arrest, they can conduct a search incident to that arrest. This is based on the idea that the person is in custody and might have weapons or evidence that could be destroyed.

I remember the case of United States v. Robinson, where the Supreme Court held that a search incident to a lawful arrest is a well-established exception to the warrant requirement. So, when an officer makes an arrest, they can search the person without a warrant. 

In this scenario, the officer initially stops the defendant for speeding. When the officer notices marijuana, which is probably illegal in that jurisdiction, he arrests the defendant. After the arrest, the officer is allowed to search the defendant as part of the arrest process. 

So, the officer finds a sealed envelope in the back pocket. I think that even though it's sealed, the search incident to arrest allows the officer to open it. Because when you're arrested, the officer can search any areas where evidence might be found. The Supreme Court has held that in such cases, the officer can search containers on the person. 

Wait, but what about the jacket? The officer unzipped the pocket and found more cocaine. Since the defendant was wearing the jacket, the pockets would be within the scope of a search incident to arrest. So, that's probably permissible. 

Now, looking at the options:

Option J says that when a police officer lawfully arrests someone in custody, they may search as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. So J seems correct.

Let me look at the other options to make sure.

Option A: Any evidence is admissible no matter how obtained? No, that's wrong because if the search was unlawful, evidence might be suppressed under the exclusionary rule.

Option B: Drivers don't have a legitimate expectation of privacy. Well, that's too broad. Drivers do have some expectation of privacy, but the officer's actions here were based on probable cause (smelling marijuana, seeing the joint, etc.), so B might not be the correct statement.

Option C: If an officer smells marijuana, they can automatically search the entire vehicle and person. That's not necessarily true. They need probable cause or a valid exception like search incident to arrest. Here, the arrest was for possession, so the search was justified under that exception.

Option D: Explicit permission is needed to search personal belongings after arrest. No, because a search incident to arrest doesn't require permission; it's allowed without a warrant.

Option E: If consent is given, evidence is admissible. That's true, but in this case, the defendant didn't consent. He was under arrest, so the officer didn't need consent.

Option F: The Fourth Amendment makes the search and evidence inadmissible. No, because the search was lawful as it was incident to a lawful arrest.

Option G: Officer can't search personal items after arrest without warrant. That's wrong because incident to arrest allows such searches without a warrant.

Option H: Exclusionary rule applies if search is unconstitutional. That's correct, but the question is about what's applicable here. Since the search was constitutional, H isn't the right answer.

Option I: Search only allowed after formal charges. No, an arrest is sufficient for a search incident to arrest.

So the correct answer should be J.

The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. When a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest, they are permitted, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, to search the person of the individual. This principle, established in cases like *United States v. Robinson*, allows officers to search the arrestee and any containers on their person without a warrant. 

In this scenario, the officer lawfully arrested the defendant for possession of marijuana after smelling burnt marijuana and observing an open envelope containing a substance that looked like marijuana. Following the arrest, the officer conducted a search incident to the arrest, which included opening a sealed envelope in the defendant's back pocket and unzipping a jacket pocket to find cocaine. These actions were permissible under the search incident to arrest doctrine.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Evidence is not admissible regardless of how it was obtained; unconstitutional searches result in exclusion of evidence.
- **B**: Incorrect. Drivers do have some expectation of privacy, and the officer's actions were justified by probable cause and the search incident to arrest.
- **C**: Incorrect. Smelling marijuana does not automatically allow a full vehicle and person search; however, a lawful arrest justifies such a search.
- **D**: Incorrect. Explicit permission is not required for a search incident to arrest.
- **E**: Irrelevant. The defendant did not consent to the search; it was conducted under the search incident to arrest exception.
- **F**: Incorrect. The search was lawful, so the evidence is admissible.
- **G**: Incorrect. A search incident to arrest does not require a warrant.
- **H**: Correct but irrelevant. The search here was constitutional, so the exclusionary rule does not apply.
- **I**: Incorrect. A search incident to arrest does not require formal charges; the arrest itself is sufficient.
- **J**: Correct. This accurately describes the legal principle allowing a search incident to a lawful arrest.

The correct answer is **J**.
