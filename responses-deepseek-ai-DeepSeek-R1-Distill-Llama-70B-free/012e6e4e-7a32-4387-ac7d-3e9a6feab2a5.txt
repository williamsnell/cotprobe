Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with burglarizing a home. At trial, the main issue of contention centered on the identity of the burglar. The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This proffered evidence should be

Options:

A: excluded, as it distracts from the main issue of identifying the burglar.
B: admitted as it shows the defendant's potential desperation.
C: excluded as it does not provide direct evidence of the defendant's involvement in the crime.
D: admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive.
E: excluded as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.
F: excluded as it could lead to bias against the defendant.
G: excluded as lacking any probative value.
H: admitted, but with a cautionary instruction from the judge to the jury to consider the evidence carefully.
I: admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.
J: admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to consider the defendant's financial status.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

So, the defendant is on trial for burglary. The main issue is whether the defendant was the one who did it. The homeowner testified but didn't see the burglar's face and couldn't even tell if it was male or female. So, the identification testimony isn't helpful. 

Then, the prosecution offers evidence that the defendant needed money to defend against other burglary charges. The question is about whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded, and why.

Hmm. I remember that evidence can be excluded if it's more prejudicial than probative, or if it's irrelevant. Also, motive can be a factorâ€”like, showing that the defendant had a reason to commit the crime.

Wait, in general, evidence of motive is admissible. Like, if someone needed money, that could be a motive to commit theft or burglary. But I also remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, certain things might be excluded if they cause unfair prejudice.

In this scenario, the evidence is about the defendant's financial need because of other burglary charges. So, it's suggesting that the defendant needed money for his defense, so he committed this burglary. That could show motive.

But wait, there's a potential problem. If the defendant is on trial for this burglary, and the prosecution brings up that he's facing other burglary charges, that might be introducing other crimes or wrongs. But wait, evidence of other crimes is generally inadmissible to prove that the person is a bad person or has a propensity for crime. However, there are exceptions, like motive.

So, if the prosecution is offering this evidence to show motive (he needed money for his defense), then it's admissible under FRE 404(b), which allows evidence of other crimes for certain purposes, like motive, opportunity, intent, etc.

But wait, another angle is whether this is being offered for the proper purpose. The evidence isn't about the defendant's character but about his motive, so it should be admissible.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Excluded because it distracts from the main issue. I don't think so; motive is relevant.

B: Admitted as it shows potential desperation. That makes sense because it's about motive.

C: Excluded as no direct evidence. Well, it's circumstantial but still relevant.

D: Admitted without restriction as probative of motive. That sounds right, but sometimes courts might want to limit how it's used.

E: Excluded as more prejudicial than probative. I'm not sure. The probative value is about motive, which is significant. So maybe not.

F: Excluded because of bias. Maybe, but the evidence isn't about other crimes necessarily, just financial need.

Wait, the evidence is about needing money for defense against other burglary charges. So, does that imply he's been charged with other burglaries? That might introduce other crimes, which could be prejudicial. Because the jury might think, "Oh, he's a burglar, so he probably did this one too."

So, wait, under FRE 404(b), evidence of other crimes is admissible for motive, but if the only purpose is to show motive, it's allowed. But the problem is that the jury might misuse it to infer propensity.

So, the court might need to weigh the probative value against the risk of unfair prejudice under FRE 403. If the probative value is high (shows motive), but the risk is that the jury will think he's a criminal, so it's prejudicial. So, is the probative value substantially outweighed by prejudice?

In this case, the defendant's need for money is a clear motive. So, the evidence is probative. But the fact that it's tied to other burglary charges might bring in the risk of unfair prejudice because it tells the jury he's charged with other burglaries. So, the question is whether the probative value is outweighed by the prejudice.

If the evidence is that he needed money without mentioning the other charges, it would be better. But since it's tied to other burglary charges, that could be problematic.

So, looking back at the options, option E says it should be excluded because it's more unfairly prejudicial than probative. Option I says it's admitted with instruction to use it for motive only.

Wait, another thought: FRE 403 allows exclusion if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value. So, if the evidence's main purpose is to show motive, but it also brings in that he's facing other burglary charges, which could be very prejudicial, the court might exclude it unless the probative value is high enough.

But the fact that he's facing other burglary charges isn't directly about his character, but about his financial situation. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the evidence might be admissible with a limiting instruction, telling the jury to consider it only for motive and not as evidence that he committed other crimes.

Looking at the options, option I says admitted with instruction to limit use to motive. So maybe that's the right approach. But some options don't mention instructions.

Alternatively, option E suggests excluding it because it's too prejudicial. So which is it?

I think the key is whether the evidence is more prejudicial than probative. The probative value is that it shows motive. The prejudice is that it suggests he's involved in other burglaries, which could lead the jury to think he's more likely to commit this one, beyond just the motive.

In cases where the other crimes are similar (like other burglaries), the prejudice might be higher. So maybe the court would exclude it under 403.

But wait, in some cases, motive evidence is allowed even if it touches on other crimes, as long as the main purpose is motive. For example, if someone is in financial trouble and commits a crime for money, that's a classic motive.

In this case, the financial need arises because of pending burglary charges, which requires money for defense. So it's a bit of a specific scenario.

I'm starting to think that the evidence is admissible for motive, but the court might give a limiting instruction. So if the option provides for that, it would be correct.

Looking at the options again, option I says "admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive." That sounds right.

Option D says admitted without restriction. But courts often give limiting instructions in such cases.

Alternatively, option E says excluded because more prejudicial. But I think the probative value is sufficient, so E might not be correct.

So, probably, the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence that the defendant needed money to defend against other burglary charges, which the prosecution offers to establish motive for the crime. The key issue is whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

1. **Relevance and Motive**: Evidence of motive is generally admissible under FRE 404(b) if it is offered for a purpose other than to show the defendant's propensity for crime. Here, the prosecution argues that the defendant's financial need constitutes a motive for the burglary, which is a valid purpose.

2. **Potential Prejudice**: While the evidence is probative of motive, it also risks unfair prejudice because it informs the jury that the defendant is facing other burglary charges. This could lead the jury to infer that the defendant is prone to burglary, which is an improper use of the evidence.

3. **Balancing Under FRE 403**: Under FRE 403, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The probative value of the evidence lies in its ability to show motive, but the prejudice arises from the mention of other burglary charges, which could unfairly influence the jury.

4. **Limiting Instructions**: To mitigate the risk of unfair prejudice, courts often admit such evidence with a limiting instruction, directing the jury to consider the evidence only for the purpose of assessing motive and not as evidence of the defendant's character or propensity for crime.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The evidence does not merely distract from the main issue; it is relevant to motive.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While the evidence shows potential desperation, it does not address the need for a limiting instruction.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The evidence is circumstantial but still relevant to motive.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Admission without restriction ignores the risk of unfair prejudice.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The probative value of the evidence is sufficient, so it should not be excluded outright.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The evidence does not inherently lead to bias; the risk lies in its potential misuse by the jury.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The evidence has probative value for motive.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. This option is vague and does not specify the purpose of the cautionary instruction.
   - **Option I**: Correct. This option appropriately balances the admissibility of the evidence with a limiting instruction, ensuring the jury uses the evidence only for the purpose of assessing motive.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The instruction should focus on motive, not the defendant's financial status.

The correct answer is **I**, as it reflects the appropriate balancing of probative value and potential prejudice, with a limiting instruction to guide the jury's use of the evidence.
