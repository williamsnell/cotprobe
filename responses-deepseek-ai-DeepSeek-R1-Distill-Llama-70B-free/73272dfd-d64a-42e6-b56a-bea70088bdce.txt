Okay, so I need to find the hydrolysis constant for the bicarbonate ion, HCO3^-, using the first dissociation constant of H2CO3 (which is Ka1) and the water constant Kw. Hmm, I remember that hydrolysis reactions involve the reaction of ions with water. 

Bicarbonate ion, HCO3^-, is the conjugate base of H2CO3 (carbonic acid). When HCO3^- undergoes hydrolysis, it should react with water. The reaction would be: HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^-. 

The hydrolysis constant, Kh, is the equilibrium constant for this reaction. So Kh = [H2CO3][OH^-] / [HCO3^-]. 

Wait, I think the hydrolysis constant is related to the acid dissociation constant of the species. Since HCO3^- is a base here, its Kb would be involved. Oh right, for a base, Kb = Kw / Ka, where Ka is the acid dissociation constant of its conjugate acid. But wait, in this case, HCO3^- is acting as a base, and its conjugate acid is H2CO3. So the Kb for HCO3^- would be Kw divided by the Ka of H2CO3, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. H2CO3 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3^- with Ka1. Then, the second dissociation is HCO3^- ↔ H+ + CO3^2- with Ka2. But in this problem, we're only given Ka1. 

So, for the hydrolysis of HCO3^-, which is HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^-, the equilibrium expression is Kh = [H2CO3][OH^-]/[HCO3^-]. 

But how does this relate to Ka1? Let me think about the reverse reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relationship between the hydrolysis and the acid dissociation.

Wait, the reaction HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^- can also be thought of as the reverse of the dissociation of H2CO3 into HCO3^- and H+. Because, normally, H2CO3 dissociates as H2CO3 → H+ + HCO3^-. But when HCO3^- hydrolyzes, it's kind of the reverse: HCO3^- + H2O → H2CO3 + OH^-.

So, the hydrolysis of HCO3^- is a base reaction. The Kb for HCO3^- as a base would be Kw / Ka1, because Kw is for water, and the conjugate acid of HCO3^- is H2CO3, whose Ka is Ka1. So Kb = Kw / Ka1.

Wait, but hydrolysis constant Kh is the same as Kb here. Because when a base hydrolyzes, the hydrolysis constant is Kb. So in this case, yes, Kh should be equal to Kb, which is Kw divided by Ka1. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. For a base like HCO3^-, which is the conjugate base of H2CO3, its base dissociation is: HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^-.

The Kb for this is [H2CO3][OH^-]/[HCO3^-] = Kw / Ka1. So that's the hydrolysis constant, Kh. So Kh = Kw / Ka1.

Looking back at the options, let's see.

Option C is Kh = Ka1 / Kw. No, that's the inverse.

Option H is Kh = Kw / Ka1. That matches, which is option H.

Wait, wait, looking at the options:

Option H is (K_W / K_a1). So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the hydrolysis constant of the bicarbonate ion, \( K_h(\text{HCO}_3^-) \), we consider the hydrolysis reaction:

\[
\text{HCO}_3^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{OH}^-
\]

The hydrolysis constant \( K_h \) is defined as:

\[
K_h = \frac{[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}
\]

The bicarbonate ion (\(\text{HCO}_3^-\)) acts as a base in this reaction, and its hydrolysis is related to the acid dissociation constant of its conjugate acid, \(\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3\), which is \( K_{a1} \). The relationship between the base dissociation constant (\( K_b \)) and the acid dissociation constant (\( K_a \)) is given by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a}
\]

Here, \( K_w \) is the water dissociation constant. Since the hydrolysis constant \( K_h \) is equivalent to \( K_b \) for this reaction, we have:

\[
K_h(\text{HCO}_3^-) = \frac{K_w}{K_{a1}(\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3)}
\]

Examining the options provided, the correct expression is:

\[
K_h(\text{HCO}_3^-) = \frac{K_w}{K_{a1}(\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3)}
\]

This corresponds to **Option H**.
