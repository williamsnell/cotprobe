Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that a healthy man and woman are both carriers of sickle-cell disease, and they're worried about having children. They want to know the chance their child will inherit the disease.

Hmm, I remember that sickle-cell is a genetic disorder. It's recessive, right? So carriers have one normal allele and one sickle allele. Carriers themselves are usually healthy because the normal allele compensates. But when two carriers have a child, there's a chance the child gets two sickle alleles.

Wait, let's break it down. Both parents are carriers, so their genotype must be heterozygous. For sickle-cell, let's denote the normal allele as 'A' and the sickle as 'a'. So each parent is Aa.

When two Aa parents have a child, the possible combinations are AA, Aa, and aa. Oh right, the Punnett square. Let's visualize that. Each parent can contribute either A or a. So the square would have four boxes: AA, Aa, Aa, aa.

So the possible outcomes are:
- 25% chance of AA (normal, not a carrier)
- 50% chance of Aa (carrier, like the parents)
- 25% chance of aa (has sickle-cell disease)

So the child has a 25% chance of getting aa, which means they have the disease. The other 75% are either carriers or normal.

Wait, but the question is asking what's the chance the child will inherit the disease. So it's only the aa case. That's 25%, right?

Looking at the options, option D is 25%. So the answer should be D.

The question involves a healthy man and woman who are both carriers of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that carriers (with the genotype Aa) are healthy but can pass the disease-causing allele to their offspring. When two carriers (Aa x Aa) have a child, the possible genotypic outcomes are:

- **25% chance of AA**: The child inherits two normal alleles and is not a carrier or affected.
- **50% chance of Aa**: The child inherits one normal and one sickle allele, making them a carrier like the parents.
- **25% chance of aa**: The child inherits two sickle alleles and will have sickle-cell disease.

The question specifically asks for the chance that the child will inherit sickle-cell disease, which corresponds to the aa genotype. This occurs with a probability of 25%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 25%**
