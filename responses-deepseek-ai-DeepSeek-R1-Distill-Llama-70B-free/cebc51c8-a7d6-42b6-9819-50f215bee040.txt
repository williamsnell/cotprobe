Okay, so I have this math problem here about the distance between Miriam's and Debbie's houses being 444.44 meters. The question is asking which statement about the values of the digits is true. There are options from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I think I should break down the number 444.44 into its place values. Let's write it out:

444.44 meters

Breaking it down digit by digit:

- The first digit from the left is 4, which is in the hundreds place. So that's 400.
- The second digit is another 4, in the tens place. That's 40.
- The third digit is 4 again, in the ones place. So 4.
- Then after the decimal, the tenths place is 4. That's 0.4.
- The hundredths place is another 4. That's 0.04.

Wait, let me make sure I got the places right. So in the integer part, it's hundreds, tens, ones. After the decimal, it's tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.

So the number is 444.44, which is 4 hundreds, 4 tens, 4 ones, 4 tenths, 4 hundredths.

Now, I need to look at each option and see which one correctly describes the relationship between the values of the digits in their respective places.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The value of the 4 in the tens place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundreds place.

Wait, the tens place is 40, and the hundreds place is 400. So 40 is actually 1/10th of 400. So A says 4 in tens is bigger than 4 in hundreds by 10 times. That's not true. So A is incorrect.

Option B: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is equal to the value of the 4 in the hundreds place.

Tenths place is 0.4, hundreds is 400. 0.4 is not equal to 400. So B is wrong.

Option C: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.

Tenths is 0.4, tens is 40. 0.4 is 1/100 of 40, not 1/10. Because 1/10 of 40 is 4, which is the ones place. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.

Hundredths is 0.04, ones place is 4. So 0.04 is 1/100 of 4. But D says it's 1/10. So 1/10 of 4 is 0.4, which is the tenths place. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.

Hundredths is 0.04, tens is 40. 0.04 is 1/1000 of 40. So that's not 1/10. So E is wrong.

Option F: The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.

Hundreds is 400, ones is 4. 400 is 100 times 4, not 10 times. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The value of the 4 in the ones place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths place.

Ones place is 4, tenths is 0.4. 4 is 10 times 0.4, so 4 is 10 times greater than 0.4. So G says the opposite, that the ones place is 1/10 of tenths, which is not true. So G is wrong.

Option H: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.

Tenths is 0.4, hundredths is 0.04. 0.4 is 10 times 0.04. So H says exactly that. So H looks correct.

Wait, let me double-check. Tenths digit is 4, so 4 tenths is 0.4. Hundredths is 4, so 0.04. So 0.4 is indeed 10 times 0.04. So H is correct. But wait, let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option I: The value of the 4 in the ones place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the tens place.

Ones is 4, tens is 40. 4 is 1/10 of 40. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is equal to the value of the 4 in the ones place.

Hundreds is 400, ones is 4. They are not equal. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option H.

The distance between Miriam’s house and Debbie’s house is 444.44 meters. Breaking down the number into its place values:

- **4** (hundreds place) = 400  
- **4** (tens place) = 40  
- **4** (ones place) = 4  
- **4** (tenths place) = 0.4  
- **4** (hundredths place) = 0.04  

Analyzing each option:  

- **A**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the tens place (40) is not 10 times greater than the 4 in the hundreds place (400).  
- **B**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is not equal to the 4 in the hundreds place (400).  
- **C**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is not 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place (40).  
- **D**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04) is not 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place (4).  
- **E**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04) is not 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place (40).  
- **F**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place (400) is not 10 times greater than the 4 in the ones place (4).  
- **G**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the ones place (4) is not 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4).  
- **H**: Correct. The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04).  
- **I**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the ones place (4) is not 10 times greater than the 4 in the tens place (40).  
- **J**: Incorrect. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place (400) is not equal to the 4 in the ones place (4).  

The correct answer is **H**.  

H
