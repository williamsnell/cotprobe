On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: "To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. "On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: "To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. "The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman. The husband then dies. The brother then dies. The cousin is thus the owner of

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Hmm, let me break it down step by step. 

So, there's a woman who owns a tract of land in the Midwest. She sells parts of it in two different transactions, and then the husband involved in both transactions conveys his interest to his cousin. Then both the husband and brother die, and we need to determine what the cousin ends up owning.

First, let me outline the timeline. 

On June 1, 2005, the woman sells an undivided one-half interest to a husband and wife. The deed says they take it as tenants by the entirety, not as joint tenants or tenants in common. Wait, I remember that tenants by the entirety is a form of ownership that's only for married couples, right? It's like joint tenancy but can't be severed by one spouse alone. So the husband and wife each have an undivided one-half interest, but it's held as a single unit. So each owns 50% as a tenancy by the entirety. So the woman still owns the other half.

Then, on June 1, 2006, the woman sells the remaining half to the husband and his brother. The deed says they take it as joint tenants, not tenants in common. So the husband and brother each own an undivided 50% of that half, meaning each gets 25% of the whole property. Because the woman was selling her half, which is 50% of the land, and she's splitting that between the two men as joint tenants. So each (husband and brother) gets 25% each.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this again. The first sale was a 50% interest to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. So the woman retains the other 50%. Then she sells that remaining 50% to the husband and his brother as joint tenants. So the husband now has two interests: one as a tenant by the entirety (with his wife) of 50%, and another as a joint tenant (with his brother) of 25% (since 50% divided by two is 25% each). 

So the husband's total interest before any conveyance would be 50% (from the first sale) plus 25% (from the second sale), totaling 75%? Wait, no. Wait, no. Because in the first sale, the husband and wife together own 50%, so each individually holds an interest in that 50% as tenants by the entirety. So the husband's individual interest is 50% of the 50%, which is 25%? Or wait, no—tenancy by the entirety, each spouse is deemed to own the entire estate, but neither can dispose of more than their own interest without the other's consent. So when the husband sells his interest, does he have a 25% interest or a 50%?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. When two people own property as tenants by the entirety, each has the right to the entire property, but upon the death of one, the other gets it all. So for transfer purposes, each owns an undivided 50%. So the husband's share in the first sale is 50% of the property, but held as a tenancy by the entirety with his wife.

Then, in the second sale, the woman sells her remaining 50% to the husband and brother as joint tenants. So that 50% is split between them as joint tenants, each getting 25% of the entire property. So the husband now has 50% (from the first sale) and 25% (from the second sale), totaling 75%? Or wait, no. Because the first sale was an undivided 50% interest to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. So each of them holds a 50% interest. Then the second sale is another 50% interest, split as 25% each to husband and brother. So the husband now holds 50% (from first) and 25% (from second), totaling 75% of the entire property. The wife has 50% from the first sale, and the brother has 25% from the second.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first sale: woman sells 50% to husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. So the woman now has 50% left. She sells that 50% to husband and brother as joint tenants. So husband and brother each get 25% of the entire property. So the total ownership would be:

- Husband: 50% (from first sale as tenant by entirety with wife) plus 25% (from second sale as joint tenant with brother) → 75%.
- Wife: 50% as tenant by entirety with husband (so she's tied to the husband's 50% in that tenancy).
- Brother: 25% from second sale as joint tenant with husband.

But wait, no. Because when the husband and wife are tenants by the entirety, each owns the entire 50% as a unit. So when the husband later sells his interest, what's his interest? Because in a tenancy by the entirety, each spouse is considered to own the entire property, but if one spouse conveys their interest, they can only convey their own share. So in the first sale, the woman conveys 50% to husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. So the husband owns 50% as a tenant by the entirety with his wife. Then, in the second sale, the woman conveys the remaining 50% to the husband and his brother as joint tenants. So each of them (husband and brother) gets 25% each.

So the husband's total interest is 50% (as tenant by entirety) plus 25% (as joint tenant with brother) = 75%. The wife has 50% (as tenant by entirety), and the brother has 25% (as joint tenant).

But then the husband conveys all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds to his cousin. So the husband's interest in both the tenancy by entirety and the joint tenancy is being transferred.

Wait, but can he do that? Because in a tenancy by the entirety, neither spouse can unilaterally sever the tenancy without the consent of the other. So if the husband tries to convey his interest, does that sever the tenancy?

Wait, but in this case, the husband is conveying his entire interest. So if he conveys his 50% interest as a tenant by the entirety, that would mean the tenancy is severed. Because a conveyance by one tenant by the entirety severs the tenancy and creates a tenancy in common between the spouse and the grantee. So when the husband conveys his interest to the cousin, the tenancy by the entirety between him and his wife would be severed. So the 50% interest would become a tenancy in common between the wife and the cousin, each holding 25%? Or does the wife retain her 50% and the cousin gets 50% from the husband's 50%?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Tenancy by the entirety can only be severed in certain ways, like a mutual agreement, a divorce, or a conveyance by one spouse. So if the husband conveys his interest, the tenancy by the entirety is severed, and the ownership becomes a tenancy in common between the wife and the cousin. So the 50% that was held as tenancy by the entirety becomes two 25% interests, one held by the wife and one by the cousin.

Wait, no. Because the husband's interest in the tenancy by the entirety is 50% of the entire property. So when he conveys that 50% interest to the cousin, the cousin now holds that 50% as a tenant in common with the wife. So the wife still holds her 50% as part of the tenancy by the entirety, but the husband's 50% is now gone and transferred to the cousin, severing the tenancy. So after the conveyance, the wife and cousin each own 50% of the property as tenants in common.

Wait, no. Because the original 50% was as tenants by the entirety. So each spouse (husband and wife) owned the entire 50% together. If the husband conveys his interest, which is 50% of the entire property, to the cousin, then the cousin would get that 50%, and the wife would retain her 50% as tenancy by the entirety? But no, because the tenancy by the entirety requires both spouses to hold the entire interest together. Once one conveys, the tenancy is severed. So the 50% that was held as tenancy by the entirety would become a tenancy in common between the wife and the cousin, each holding 25% of the entire property. Wait, no. Wait, the 50% was owned as a tenancy by the entirety, meaning that each spouse had a 50% interest in that 50%. So the husband's 50% interest in that 50% is 25% of the entire property. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the husband's interest in the tenancy by the entirety is 50% of the entire property. So when he conveys that to the cousin, the cousin gets 50% of the entire property, and the wife's 50% remains as tenancy by the entirety? No, because the tenancy by the entirety can't exist if one spouse no longer holds their interest. So when the husband conveys his 50% interest, the tenancy by the entirety is severed, and the wife now holds 50% as a tenant in common with the cousin, who also holds 50%. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the husband only had 50% to convey.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is this: the husband and wife each own an undivided 50% interest as tenants by the entirety. So each has a 50% interest, but together they own 100% of that 50%. When the husband conveys his 50% interest to the cousin, the cousin now owns 50%, and the wife's 50% remains. But that can't be right because the tenancy by the entirety is a joint interest. So severing it would change the ownership structure.

Alternatively, when the husband conveys his interest, the tenancy by the entirety is severed, and the 50% becomes a tenancy in common between the wife and the cousin, each owning 25% of the entire property. Because the husband's 50% interest (from the tenancy by the entirety) is transferred to the cousin, making the cousin a 25% owner, and the wife retains her 25% in that portion. Wait, no. Because the tenancy by the entirety was for 50% of the entire property. So the husband's interest in that 50% is 50% of that, which is 25% of the entire property. So when he transfers that 25% to the cousin, the cousin gets 25%, and the wife's 25% remains as a tenant in common. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it differently. 

Initial ownership: Woman owns 100%.

First sale (2005): Sells 50% to husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. So the woman now retains 50%. The husband and wife each have an undivided 50% interest as tenants by the entirety.

Second sale (2006): Woman sells her remaining 50% to husband and brother as joint tenants. So each (husband and brother) gets 25% of the entire property.

So after both sales, the ownership is:

- Husband: 50% (from first sale) + 25% (from second sale) = 75%.
- Wife: 50% (from first sale).
- Brother: 25% (from second sale).

Wait, no. Because in the first sale, the husband and wife together own 50% as tenants by the entirety. So each of them owns 50% in that 50%, which is 25% each of the entire property. Wait, no, that's not right. Because as tenants by the entirety, they own the 50% together, so each has the right to the entire 50%, but for transfer purposes, each is considered to have a 50% interest in the entire property. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts.

Alternatively, perhaps after the first sale, the ownership is:

- Woman: 50%.
- Husband and Wife: 50% as tenants by the entirety.

Then, in the second sale, the woman sells her 50% to husband and brother as joint tenants. So that 50% is split into two 25% shares. So husband gets 25% and brother gets 25%.

So now, the ownership is:

- Husband: 25% (from second sale) + 50% (from first sale as tenant by entirety with wife) → but wait, in the first sale, the 50% is owned by both husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. So the husband's interest in that is 50% of the entire property. Then, in the second sale, he gets another 25%. So total is 75%.

- Wife: 50% as tenant by the entirety with husband.

- Brother: 25% as joint tenant with husband.

Wait, but the husband and wife's 50% is as tenants by the entirety, so the wife's interest is tied to the husband's. When the husband conveys his interest, that would affect the tenancy.

So the husband conveys all his interest under both deeds to his cousin. So that includes:

1. His 50% interest as tenant by the entirety with wife.

2. His 25% interest as joint tenant with brother.

So when he conveys both, what happens?

First, conveying the 50% interest as tenant by the entirety. As I recall, when one tenant by the entirety conveys their interest, the tenancy is severed, and it becomes a tenancy in common between the grantee (cousin) and the other spouse (wife). So the 50% that was held as tenancy by the entirety becomes a tenancy in common between cousin and wife, each holding 25% of the entire property.

Wait, no. Because the husband had a 50% interest in the entire property as a tenant by the entirety. So when he conveys that 50% to the cousin, the cousin now owns 50%, and the wife's 50% remains. But that's not possible because the tenancy by the entirety is a joint interest. So perhaps the correct way is that the husband's 50% interest is transferred to the cousin, making the cousin and wife tenants in common, each owning 50% of the entire property.

Wait, no, because the tenancy by the entirety was for 50% of the property. So the husband's interest in that 50% is 50%, making his total from the first sale 25% of the entire property. When he conveys that 25% to the cousin, the cousin now owns 25%, and the wife retains her 25% in that portion. So the first 50% becomes two 25% interests, wife and cousin.

Then, the husband's 25% from the second sale (as joint tenant with brother) is conveyed to the cousin. So the cousin gets another 25% from that.

So after the conveyance, the cousin has 25% (from first sale) + 25% (from second sale) = 50%.

The wife still has her 25% from the first sale.

The brother has 25% from the second sale.

Wait, but the husband also had a 25% interest from the second sale as a joint tenant with the brother. When he conveys that, the cousin gets that 25%. So the cousin now has 25% (from tenancy by entirety severance) and 25% (from joint tenancy) → total 50%.

The wife has 25% from the first sale.

The brother has 25% from the second sale.

So total ownership would be:

- Cousin: 50%.

- Wife: 25%.

- Brother: 25%.

But wait, the husband and brother were joint tenants. When the husband conveys his 25% to the cousin, does that sever the joint tenancy? Or does the cousin become a joint tenant with the brother?

Wait, joint tenancy can be severed by a conveyance. So when the husband conveys his interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the cousin becomes a tenant in common with the brother for that 50% (since the original 50% was split as 25% each). So after the conveyance, the 50% that was jointly held by husband and brother becomes two 25% shares: 25% to cousin and 25% to brother as tenants in common.

So now, the ownership is:

- From first sale: 50% was held as tenancy by entirety (husband and wife). Husband conveyed his 50% to cousin, so now cousin and wife each own 25% of the entire property as tenants in common.

- From second sale: 50% was held as joint tenancy (husband and brother). Husband conveyed his 25% to cousin, so now cousin and brother each own 25% as tenants in common.

Wait, but that doesn't add up because 25% (cousin from first) +25% (cousin from second) +25% (wife) +25% (brother) = 100%, which is correct.

So the cousin ends up with 25% +25% =50%.

But wait, the wife and cousin each have 25% from the first sale, and the cousin and brother each have 25% from the second sale. So the cousin has 50%, the wife 25%, and the brother 25%.

But then the husband dies, and the brother dies. What happens then?

When the husband dies, his interests have already been conveyed to the cousin, so his death doesn't affect the cousin's ownership.

When the brother dies, he owned 25% as a tenant in common. So his 25% would pass according to his will or intestacy laws. But the question doesn't mention anything about that. It just says the brother dies, and we're to determine the cousin's ownership.

Wait, but the question states that the husband conveys all his interest to the cousin, then the husband dies, then the brother dies. So after the conveyance, the cousin has 50%, wife has 25%, brother has 25%.

When the brother dies, his 25% would go to his heirs or as per his will. The question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can ignore that since the cousin's interest isn't affected by the brother's death unless the cousin had a survivorship right, but since it's a tenancy in common now, there's no right of survivorship.

Wait, but the second sale was as joint tenants, so initially, husband and brother had a right of survivorship. But when the husband conveyed his share to the cousin, the joint tenancy was severed, turning it into a tenancy in common between cousin and brother. So when the brother dies, his 25% would go to his
