Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. If it's consistent, I need to pick an option with a consistent valuation. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by understanding what each part means. The set of propositions given are:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)
2. C ⊃ D
3. A ∨ (B · ~D)
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D)

And the options are from A to J, each describing whether the set is consistent or inconsistent, along with a possible valuation.

Wait, wait. So, I need to evaluate these four propositions to see if there's any possible truth valuation that makes all of them true. If such a valuation exists, the set is consistent, else it's inconsistent.

Let me break down each proposition:

1. A implies (~B or C): So if A is true, then either B is false or C is true.
2. C implies D: If C is true, D must be true.
3. A or (B and ~D): So either A is true, or B is true and D is false.
4. A is equivalent to (B implies D): So A is true exactly when B implies D is true.

Hmm, okay. So I need to see if all four can be true at the same time. Since it's an indirect truth table, I think that means I try to find a model where all are true, or else show that it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logical equivalences to simplify the set.

Let me rewrite each proposition for clarity.

Proposition 1: A → (~B ∨ C) is equivalent to ~A ∨ (~B ∨ C) which simplifies to ~A ∨ ~B ∨ C.

Proposition 2: C → D is equivalent to ~C ∨ D.

Proposition 3: A ∨ (B ∧ ~D). This is already in a simple form.

Proposition 4: A ≡ (B → D). B → D is ~B ∨ D, so A ↔ (~B ∨ D). Which can be written as (A → (~B ∨ D)) ∧ ((~B ∨ D) → A).

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express A in terms of B and D. So A is true if and only if ~B ∨ D is true.

So, A ↔ (~B ∨ D). Which means that A is true exactly when either B is false or D is true.

Now, let's see if we can find a truth assignment that satisfies all four propositions.

Maybe it's easier to try possible valuations from the options and see which one works.

Looking at the options, each gives a possible assignment. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when B and D are true, A and C are false.

So in this case, A=False, B=True, D=True, C=False.

Let's check each proposition:

1. A → (~B ∨ C): A is False, so the implication is True regardless.
2. C → D: C=False, D=True → implication is True.
3. A ∨ (B ∧ ~D): A=False, B=True, D=True → B ∧ ~D is False, so A∨... is False. So proposition 3 is False. So this valuation makes the set not consistent. So if the options says it's inconsistent because this valuation makes it inconsistent, but wait, the set is inconsistent only if no valuation makes all propositions true. So this option is incorrect because it's just one possible valuation that doesn't satisfy; but maybe another valuation exists.

But since the question is whether the set is consistent, not whether this specific valuation works, I can't rely solely on this.

Option B: Consistent. All false.

A=False, B=False, C=False, D=False.

Check each proposition:

1. A→(~B∨C): A=False → True.
2. C→D: C=False → True.
3. A∨(B∧~D): A=False, B=False, ~D=True. B∧~D is False. So A∨False is False. So proposition 3 is False. So this valuation doesn't satisfy all, so option B's valuation is invalid. So B is wrong.

Option C: Consistent. A=True, D=True; B=False, C=False.

Check each proposition:

1. A→(~B∨C): A=True, ~B=True (since B=False), C=False. So ~B∨C is True. So implication holds.
2. C→D: C=False → implication holds.
3. A∨(B∧~D): A=True, so whole is True.
4. A ≡ (B→D). B→D is B=False→D=True → which is True. So A=True, so A≡True is True.

So all four propositions are True under this valuation. So the set is consistent, and option C provides a correct consistent valuation.

But wait, I should check other options to see if any are better or if I made a mistake.

Option D: Inconsistent. All true.

A=True, B=True, C=True, D=True.

Check each proposition:

1. A→(~B∨C): ~B is False, C=True → ~B∨C is True. So implication holds.
2. C→D: C=True, D=True → holds.
3. A∨(B∧~D): A=True → entire is True.
4. A ≡ (B→D). B→D is True (since B and D are both True). So A=True, which matches.

So all four propositions are True in this case. So the set is consistent. But option D says it's inconsistent, so D is wrong.

Option E: Consistent. B, C, D=True; A=False.

Check each proposition:

1. A→(~B∨C): A=False → True.
2. C→D: True → True.
3. A∨(B∧~D): A=False. B=True, D=True → ~D=False. So B∧~D is False. So A∨False is False. So proposition 3 is False. So this valuation doesn't work. So option E's valuation is invalid.

Option F: Consistent. C and D=True; A and B=False.

Check:

1. A→(~B∨C): A=False → True.
2. C→D: True → True.
3. A∨(B∧~D): A=False. B=False → B∧~D is False. So overall False. So proposition 3 is False. So this valuation doesn't work, so F is wrong.

Option G: Consistent. A, B, D=True; C=False.

Check:

1. A→(~B∨C): A=True, ~B=False, C=False → ~B∨C is False. So implication is False. So proposition 1 is False. So this valuation doesn't work, so G is wrong.

Option H: Consistent. A, B, C=True; D=False.

Check:

1. A→(~B∨C): A=True, ~B=False, C=True → ~B∨C is True. So implication holds.
2. C→D: C=True, D=False → implication is False. So proposition 2 is False. So this valuation doesn't work.

Option I: Inconsistent. A, C, D=True; B=False.

Check:

1. A→(~B∨C): A=True, ~B=True, C=True → implication holds.
2. C→D: True → True.
3. A∨(B∧~D): A=True → True.
4. A≡(B→D). B=False → B→D is True. A=True, so equivalence holds.

So all four propositions are True here. So the set is consistent, which contradicts option I's claim of being inconsistent. So I is wrong.

Option J: Inconsistent.

But from earlier, option C provides a valid valuation where all are True. So the set is consistent, which makes option J (inconsistent) wrong.

So the correct answer must be option C, which correctly states that the set is consistent and provides a valid valuation.

To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we analyze each proposition and evaluate the provided options to find a truth valuation that satisfies all propositions simultaneously. The propositions are:

1. **A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)**: If A is true, then either B is false or C is true.  
2. **C ⊃ D**: If C is true, then D must be true.  
3. **A ∨ (B · ~D)**: Either A is true, or B is true and D is false.  
4. **A ≡ (B ⊃ D)**: A is true if and only if B implies D (i.e., ~B ∨ D).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Claims inconsistency with A=False, B=True, C=False, D=True.  
  - Proposition 3 fails because A=False and B∧~D=False.  
  - This valuation does not prove inconsistency since other valuations might satisfy all propositions.

- **Option B**: Claims consistency with A=False, B=False, C=False, D=False.  
  - Proposition 3 fails because A=False and B∧~D=False.  
  - This valuation is invalid, so B is incorrect.

- **Option C**: Claims consistency with A=True, B=False, C=False, D=True.  
  - Proposition 1: A=True, ~B=True, so ~B∨C=True.  
  - Proposition 2: C=False, so C→D holds.  
  - Proposition 3: A=True, so A∨(B∧~D)=True.  
  - Proposition 4: A=True and B→D=True (B=False→D=True).  
  - All propositions are true, so this is a valid consistent valuation.

- **Option D**: Claims inconsistency with A=True, B=True, C=True, D=True.  
  - Proposition 1: A=True, ~B=False, C=True, so ~B∨C=True.  
  - Proposition 2: C=True, D=True, so C→D holds.  
  - Proposition 3: A=True, so A∨(B∧~D)=True.  
  - Proposition 4: A=True and B→D=True (B=True, D=True).  
  - All propositions are true, so the set is consistent. D is incorrect.

- **Option E**: Claims consistency with A=False, B=True, C=True, D=True.  
  - Proposition 3: A=False, B=True, D=True, so B∧~D=False.  
  - A∨(B∧~D)=False, so proposition 3 fails.  
  - This valuation is invalid, so E is incorrect.

- **Option F**: Claims consistency with A=False, B=False, C=True, D=True.  
  - Proposition 3: A=False, B=False, so B∧~D=False.  
  - A∨(B∧~D)=False, so proposition 3 fails.  
  - This valuation is invalid, so F is incorrect.

- **Option G**: Claims consistency with A=True, B=True, C=False, D=True.  
  - Proposition 1: A=True, ~B=False, C=False, so ~B∨C=False.  
  - A→(~B∨C)=False, so proposition 1 fails.  
  - This valuation is invalid, so G is incorrect.

- **Option H**: Claims consistency with A=True, B=True, C=True, D=False.  
  - Proposition 2: C=True, D=False, so C→D=False.  
  - This valuation is invalid, so H is incorrect.

- **Option I**: Claims inconsistency with A=True, B=False, C=True, D=True.  
  - Proposition 1: A=True, ~B=True, so ~B∨C=True.  
  - Proposition 2: C=True, D=True, so C→D holds.  
  - Proposition 3: A=True, so A∨(B∧~D)=True.  
  - Proposition 4: A=True and B→D=True (B=False→D=True).  
  - All propositions are true, so the set is consistent. I is incorrect.

- **Option J**: Claims inconsistency.  
  - Since option C provides a valid consistent valuation, the set is consistent. J is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The set of propositions is consistent, and option C provides a valid consistent valuation.
