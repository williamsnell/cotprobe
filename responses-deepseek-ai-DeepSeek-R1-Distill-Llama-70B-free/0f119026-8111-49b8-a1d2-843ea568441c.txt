Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of D-ribose. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermo, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we've got a sample of D-ribose with a mass of 0.727 grams. It was ignited in a calorimeter with excess oxygen, and the temperature rose by 0.910 K. Then, in a separate experiment, benzoic acid (0.825 grams) was combusted in the same calorimeter, causing a temperature rise of 1.940 K. The internal energy of combustion for benzoic acid is given as -3251 kJ/mol.

Wait, I remember that calorimetry experiments are used to find the heat capacity of the calorimeter or the heat of reaction. Since both experiments use the same calorimeter, I think we can use benzoic acid's data to find the calorimeter's heat capacity first. Once we have that, we can use the D-ribose data to find its heat of combustion. Then, maybe use Hess's Law or some other thermodynamic relationships to find the enthalpy of formation.

So, let's break it down. First, I need to find the heat capacity (C) of the calorimeter. To do that, I'll use the benzoic acid combustion data because the heat released by the reaction is known.

Benzoic acid's internal energy of combustion is given as ΔU = -3251 kJ/mol. Wait, internal energy (ΔU) is for a closed system, right? But when we do bomb calorimetry, the volume is constant, so ΔU is measured. But I'm not sure if that's the case here because the problem doesn't specify. Oh, wait, the internal energy is given, so I'll proceed with that.

The mass of benzoic acid used is 0.825 grams. Benzoic acid has a molar mass. Let me calculate that. Its formula is C7H6O2. Carbon is 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen 1.008, oxygen 16.00. So 7*12.01 = 84.07, 6*1.008=6.048, 2*16=32. So total molar mass is 84.07 + 6.048 +32 = 122.118 g/mol.

So, moles of benzoic acid = mass / molar mass = 0.825 g / 122.118 g/mol ≈ 0.006756 mol.

The internal energy change (q) for the reaction is ΔU = moles * ΔU_combustion. Since ΔU is -3251 kJ/mol, q = 0.006756 mol * (-3251 kJ/mol) ≈ -21.93 kJ. But since the reaction releases heat, the calorimeter absorbs it, so q_calorimeter is positive 21.93 kJ.

The calorimeter's heat capacity (C) is q / ΔT, where ΔT is the temperature change. So ΔT is 1.940 K. So C = 21.93 kJ / 1.940 K ≈ 11.30 kJ/K. Wait, 21.93 divided by 1.94 is around 11.3. Let me double-check that calculation. 1.94 times 11 is 21.34, and 11.3 times 1.94 is 21.932, so yeah, approximately 11.3 kJ/K.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Units are important here. Because the q is in kJ and ΔT in K, so C is in kJ/K. Right.

Now, moving on to the D-ribose experiment. Mass is 0.727 grams. The formula for D-ribose is C5H10O5. Let me confirm that. Yes, ribose is an aldopentose with the formula C5H10O5. So molar mass is 5*12.01 +10*1.008 +5*16.00.

Calculating that: 5*12.01 =60.05, 10*1.008=10.08, 5*16=80. So total is 60.05+10.08=70.13 +80=150.13 g/mol.

Moles of D-ribose = 0.727 g / 150.13 g/mol ≈ 0.004844 mol.

The temperature change for this combustion is 0.910 K. So the heat absorbed by the calorimeter is q = C * ΔT = 11.3 kJ/K * 0.910 K ≈ 10.293 kJ.

But wait, in combustion reactions, the substance releases heat as it burns, so the calorimeter gains heat, which is positive. So the heat released by the combustion is negative, but the calorimeter's q is positive. So the heat of combustion (ΔU) for D-ribose is -q, because the system is losing energy as heat.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The first law says ΔU = q + w. But in a bomb calorimeter at constant volume, work is zero, so ΔU = q_v. So the heat absorbed by the calorimeter is q_calorimeter = -ΔU_combustion, because the reaction is exothermic, releasing heat.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the reaction's internal energy change. For the combustion of benzoic acid, the calorimeter's q was positive because heat was released. So for D-ribose, the same applies.

So, the heat released by the combustion of D-ribose is q_combustion = -q_calorimeter.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The reaction (combustion) is exothermic, so the system loses heat, which the calorimeter absorbs. So the heat of the reaction is negative, and the calorimeter's heat is positive.

So, for benzoic acid: q_calorimeter = +21.93 kJ (as calculated before). The reaction's ΔU is -3251 kJ/mol, which is exothermic.

So for D-ribose, the heat absorbed by the calorimeter is q_cal = C * ΔT = 11.3 kJ/K * 0.910 K ≈ 10.293 kJ. Therefore, the heat released by the reaction is q_reaction = -q_cal = -10.293 kJ. But wait, no, because the reaction is exothermic, so q_reaction is negative, and the calorimeter's q is positive. So ΔU_combustion (for D-ribose) is - (q_cal) per mole.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in the benzoic acid case, the ΔU_combustion is given as -3251 kJ/mol, which means the reaction releases 3251 kJ per mole. The calorimeter absorbed 21.93 kJ, which is the heat released by the reaction. So in that case, the moles of benzoic acid were 0.006756 mol, so 0.006756 mol * 3251 kJ/mol = 21.93 kJ. So that checks out.

So for D-ribose, the heat released by the reaction (q_reaction) is equal to the heat absorbed by the calorimeter, which is q_cal = C * ΔT = 11.3 kJ/K * 0.910 K = approx 10.293 kJ.

So the internal energy change for the combustion of D-ribose is ΔU = -q_cal / n, where n is moles of D-ribose combusted.

Wait, no. Wait, for D-ribose, the heat released by combustion is q_combustion = - (heat absorbed by calorimeter) = -10.293 kJ.

Wait, no, because the calorimeter gains heat, so q_combustion is negative. So for the reaction, ΔU is negative because it's exothermic. So ΔU = q_v (at constant volume), so yes, ΔU = q_v = -10.293 kJ for the amount combusted. But wait, that's per the total combustion of 0.727 g, which is 0.004844 mol.

So, the molar ΔU_combustion would be ΔU = (-10.293 kJ) / 0.004844 mol ≈ -2125 kJ/mol. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me compute that again.

Wait, 10.293 kJ is the amount the calorimeter absorbed, which equates to the heat released by the reaction. So the reaction's ΔU is negative: ΔU = -10.293 kJ for 0.004844 mol. So per mole, ΔU_combustion = (-10.293 kJ) / 0.004844 mol ≈ -2125.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. That seems really high. Benzoic acid's ΔU is about -3251 kJ/mol, and D-ribose's ΔU combustion being around -2125 kJ/mol? Hmm, that might be possible. Let me think. Carbohydrates do have lower energy per gram than fats, but benzoic acid is a different compound.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the moles of D-ribose. Mass is 0.727 g, molar mass 150.13 g/mol. 0.727 / 150.13 = let's calculate.

150.13 * 0.0048 is about 0.721, so 0.0048 *150.13 = 0.721. 0.727 is a bit more. So 0.727-0.721=0.006 g. So 0.006 /150.13 ≈ 0.00004 mol. So total moles ≈ 0.00484 mol.

So 10.293 kJ is for 0.00484 mol, so per mole, it's 10.293 / 0.00484 ≈ 2126 kJ. So the ΔU_combustion is -2126 kJ/mol for D-ribose.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, because the calorimeter's heat is q_cal = C * ΔT, which is 11.3 kJ/K * 0.910 K = 10.293 kJ.

So the reaction's ΔU is -10.293 kJ (exothermic) for 0.00484 mol, so per mole, it's -10.293 / 0.00484 ≈ -2125.3 kJ/mol.

But I thought the standard enthalpy of combustion for D-ribose is around -2800 kJ/mol. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between ΔU and ΔH.

Ah, right! Because ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT. At constant pressure, ΔH is the enthalpy change, but here we're measuring ΔU in a calorimeter at constant volume. So I need to convert ΔU to ΔH for the combustion reaction.

Wait, but the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, not the enthalpy of combustion. So maybe I should proceed to find ΔH_combustion for D-ribose, then use Hess's Law to find the enthalpy of formation.

Right. So, from ΔU_combustion to ΔH_combustion, I need to calculate that.

The combustion reaction for D-ribose would be:

C5H10O5(s) + 5 O2(g) → 5 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(l)

Wait, let me write the balanced equation correctly.

The formula for D-ribose is C5H10O5. Combustion would produce CO2 and H2O.

So the balanced equation is:

C5H10O5(s) + 5 O2(g) → 5 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(l)

Wait, let's balance the carbons: 5 on each side. Hydrogens: 10 on the left, 10 on the right (5*2). Oxygen: 5 (from ribose) + 5*2=10 (from O2) → 5*2 (CO2) +5*1 (H2O) → 10 +5 =15. Wait, that doesn't balance. Let me check.

On the left: O from ribose:5, O2: 5*2=10 → total O=15.

On the right: CO2:5 molecules, each with 2 O → 10 O. H2O:5 molecules, each with 1 O →5 O. Total O=15. So yes, balanced.

Now, the change in moles of gas (Δn) is moles of gaseous products minus moles of gaseous reactants.

Reactants: 5 O2 (gas) =5 moles.

Products: 5 CO2 (gas) =5 moles. H2O is liquid, so not counted.

So Δn = (5 -5) =0. Wait, that's not right. Let me compute Δn correctly.

Δn = moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants.

Gaseous products: 5 CO2 =5 moles.

Gaseous reactants: 5 O2 =5 moles.

So Δn =5 -5 =0.

Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again. Because O2 is a reactant, and CO2 is a product. So for each mole of D-ribose combusted, 5 O2 are consumed, and 5 CO2 are produced. So the moles of gas: reactant is 5, product is5. So net change is zero. So Δn =0.

Wait, but wait, H2O is liquid, so it doesn't contribute to gas moles. So yes, Δn =5 -5=0.

If Δn is zero, then ΔH = ΔU + Δn * RT. But if Δn =0, then ΔH=ΔU.

Wait, but wait, that's only true at specific conditions. Alternatively, the general formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R * T.

Since Δn_gas is zero, ΔH_combustion = ΔU_combustion.

So, the ΔH_combustion for D-ribose is the same as ΔU_combustion, which is approximately -2125 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because when I look up standard enthalpies of combustion, D-ribose has a value around -2805 kJ/mol. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moles of D-ribose. Let me recalculate that.

Molar mass of D-ribose: C5H10O5.

C:5×12.01=60.05

H:10×1.008=10.08

O:5×16=80

Total:60.05 +10.08=70.13 +80=150.13 g/mol.

Mass is 0.727 grams. So moles =0.727 /150.13 ≈0.004844 mol.

So for the calorimeter, the heat absorbed is C * ΔT =11.3 kJ/K *0.910 K ≈10.293 kJ.

So the heat released by the reaction is 10.293 kJ. Since the reaction is exothermic, the internal energy change ΔU is -10.293 kJ for 0.004844 mol.

So per mole, ΔU = (-10.293 kJ) / 0.004844 mol ≈-2125 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but according to my notes, the standard enthalpy of combustion for D-ribose is around -2805 kJ/mol. So why is there a discrepancy here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat capacity calculation. Let me go back to the benzoic acid part.

Benzoic acid mass:0.825 g. Molar mass:122.118 g/mol.

Moles =0.825 /122.118≈0.006756 mol.

ΔU_combustion is -3251 kJ/mol. So q_reaction = moles × ΔU =0.006756 mol × (-3251 kJ/mol)≈-21.93 kJ.

The calorimeter absorbs this heat, so q_calorimeter is +21.93 kJ. The temperature change is 1.940 K.

So heat capacity C = q_calorimeter / ΔT =21.93 kJ /1.940 K ≈11.3 kJ/K.

Wait, that seems correct. Then for D-ribose, the calorimeter's heat is 11.3 kJ/K ×0.910 K≈10.293 kJ.

So the reaction's ΔU is -10.293 kJ for 0.004844 mol.

So ΔU_combustion is -10.293 /0.004844 ≈-2125 kJ/mol.

But according to standard data, the ΔH_combustion for D-ribose is about -2805 kJ/mol. So why are we getting a different value here?

Ah, wait, perhaps I'm confusing internal energy and enthalpy. Because the calorimeter gives us ΔU (since it's at constant volume), but we need ΔH for the combustion, which we can calculate using ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R * T.

Wait, but earlier I thought Δn is zero because the moles of gas don't change. But wait, let me recheck that.

In the combustion reaction:

C5H10O5(s) +5 O2(g) →5 CO2(g) +5 H2O(l)

So the gaseous reactants are 5 moles of O2, and gaseous products are 5 moles of CO2. H2O is liquid.

So Δn_gas = moles of gaseous products - gaseous reactants =5 -5=0.

So Δn=0, thus ΔH_combustion = ΔU_combustion.

Hmm, that would mean that ΔH is also -2125 kJ/mol, which doesn't match standard values. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of benzoic acid or the heat capacity.

Wait, let's recalculate the benzoic acid part.

Benzoic acid: 0.825 g. Molar mass 122.118 g/mol.

Moles =0.825 /122.118 ≈0.006756 mol.

ΔU_combustion = -3251 kJ/mol.

So q_reaction = 0.006756 mol × (-3251 kJ/mol) = -21.93 kJ.

So the calorimeter gains 21.93 kJ,
