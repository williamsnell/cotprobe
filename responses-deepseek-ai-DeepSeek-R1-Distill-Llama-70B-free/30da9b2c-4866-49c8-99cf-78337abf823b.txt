Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Elise and how she remembered the phone number. Let me break it down.

The question says Elise hears about a concert ticket giveaway on the radio. She needs to be the seventh caller to win. So she pulls over to call, and while doing that, she repeats the number to herself several times. The question is asking which memory technique she used.

The options are A through J, each a different memory-related term. I remember from my psychology class that there are different types of memory and strategies people use to remember information.

First, I think about what each option means. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Maintenance rehearsal. I remember that rehearsal is a method to keep information in working memory. Maintenance rehearsal is when you repeat information over and over to prevent forgetting, especially in the short term. So if Elise is repeating the number, this might be it.

Option B: Chunking. That's when you break down information into smaller groups, like how phone numbers are split into parts. But she's repeating the whole number, not breaking it into chunks. So maybe not B.

Option C: Long-term memory. That's where information is stored over a long period. But she just heard it on the radio and is trying to remember it immediately, so probably not using long-term yet.

Option D: Iconic memory. That's about visual images, like a flash of something you saw. Since she's dealing with a phone number, which is auditory, this doesn't fit.

Option E: Elaborative rehearsal. This involves deeper processing, like associating new information with something you already know. She's just repeating the number, not really associating it with anything else. So maybe not E.

Option F: Selective attention. That's about focusing on specific stimuli while ignoring others. She was driving and then pulled over, so she focused on the radio, but that's more about attention, not memory storage.

Option G: Procedural memory. That's about skills and how to do things, like riding a bike. Not relevant here.

Option H: Episodic memory. That's about specific events or experiences. She's just remembering a phone number, not an event.

Option I: Echoic memory. This is about auditory information, the brief storage of sounds. But echoic memory is very short, like a few seconds. She's actively trying to remember the number by repeating it, so it's more about working memory than echoic.

Option J: Semantic memory. That's about factual knowledge, like knowing capital cities. But she's just trying to remember a specific number she heard, not a fact she's storing long-term.

Wait, so putting it all together. She's repeating the number to keep it in her memory. That sounds like maintenance rehearsal, which is a strategy to hold information in the short-term memory by repeating it. So option A.

I think that's the right answer. Maintenance rehearsal helps prevent the information from being forgotten by keeping it active in the short-term memory through repetition.

Elise repeated the phone number to herself to remember it, which is an example of maintenance rehearsal. This technique involves repeating information to keep it in short-term memory and prevent forgetting.

Answer: A
