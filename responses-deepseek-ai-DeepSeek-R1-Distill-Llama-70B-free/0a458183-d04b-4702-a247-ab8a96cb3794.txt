Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a sinusoidal sound wave. Hmm, I remember that sound waves involve pressure variations, and there's some relation between pressure and displacement. Let me think about what I learned in my physics class.

The problem says the maximum pressure variations are about 3.0e-2 Pa above and below atmospheric pressure. So that's the maximum change in pressure, ΔP. And we're supposed to find the corresponding maximum displacement. The frequency is 1000 Hz. Also, I'm given the speed of sound in air, which is 344 m/s, and the bulk modulus is 1.42e5 Pa.

Wait, I think the bulk modulus (B) relates pressure and volume changes. Oh right, B is defined as the ratio of pressure change to the fractional volume change. So B = -V/P * dP, where V is the volume and P is the pressure. But how does this connect to displacement?

I remember that for a sound wave, the displacement of the particles (like air molecules) relates to the pressure variation. There's a formula that connects maximum pressure ΔP_max to the maximum displacement ξ_max.

Oh wait, the formula I think is ΔP_max = B * (ω ξ_max) / v. Or wait, maybe it's ΔP = B * (ω ξ) / v? Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

I think the relation comes from considering the displacement of the air particles. The displacement ξ is related to the particle velocity. The velocity of the particles in the medium is given by v = ω ξ, where ω is the angular frequency. Oh wait, because velocity is the derivative of displacement with respect to time, and for a sinusoidal wave, the velocity amplitude would be ω times the displacement amplitude.

So, the velocity of the particles is maximum at the maximum displacement points. Then, I think the pressure variation is related to the velocity gradient. Oh right, because in a sound wave, the pressure changes are due to the compression and rarefaction, which come from the displacement of the air particles.

Wait, I think the formula is ΔP = B * (dξ/dt) / v? Or maybe ΔP is related to the derivative of displacement. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the equation for a sound wave.

I remember that the pressure variation in a sound wave is given by ΔP = B * (ω ξ) / v. Because ω is 2πf, and the velocity gradient is ω ξ over the speed of sound v.

Wait, let me double-check. The general expression for pressure in a sound wave is ΔP = (B * k) * ξ, where k is the wave number. And k is 2π/λ, but also since v = fλ, then k = 2πf / v. So substituting, ΔP = B * (2πf / v) * ξ.

Oh wait, but wait, that would be ΔP = (B * 2π f / v) * ξ. But since 2π f is the angular frequency ω, that's ΔP = (B * ω ξ) / v.

So the maximum pressure is when ξ is maximum, so ΔP_max = (B * ω ξ_max) / v.

Wait, but the problem gives me the maximum pressure variation, and I need to find the maximum displacement. So rearranging the formula:

ξ_max = (v ΔP_max) / (B ω)

Yes, that makes sense. So I can plug in the numbers.

Given:
ΔP_max = 3.0e-2 Pa
v = 344 m/s
B = 1.42e5 Pa
f = 1000 Hz, so ω = 2πf = 2 * π * 1000 ≈ 6283.19 rad/s

So plugging in:

ξ_max = (344 * 3e-2) / (1.42e5 * 6283.19)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 344 * 0.03 = 10.32

Denominator: 1.42e5 * 6283.19 = let's compute that.

1.42e5 = 142000

142000 * 6283.19 = hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute it step by step.

Wait, 142000 * 6000 is 852e6, and 142000 * 283.19 is... Let me approximate.

Wait, maybe I should just compute 1.42e5 * 6.283e3 (since 6283 is approx 6.283e3).

So 1.42e5 * 6.283e3 = 1.42 * 6.283 * 1e8 = let's compute 1.42 * 6.283 first.

1.42 * 6 = 8.52, 1.42 * 0.283 ≈ 0.402. So total is around 8.52 + 0.402 = 8.922, so 8.922e8.

So denominator is approx 8.922e8.

So ξ_max = 10.32 / 8.922e8 = approx 1.155e-8 meters.

Wait, 10.32 / 8.922e8 is equal to 1.155e-8 m, which is 1.155e-8 meters, which is 1.155 x 10^-8 m.

Looking at the options, the unit is 1e-8, so the value is 1.155, which is approximately 1.2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 1.2.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Because I might have mixed up something.

Wait, the formula I used was ξ_max = (v ΔP_max) / (B ω). Let me make sure that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the speed of sound v is related to the bulk modulus and density. The formula is v = sqrt(B / rho), where rho is the air density. But I don't have rho given here, but perhaps I can find it.

Wait, if I can compute rho, maybe that would help. Let's see: v^2 = B / rho => rho = B / v^2.

So rho = (1.42e5) / (344)^2.

Compute 344 squared: 344 *344. Let's see, 300^2=9e4, 44^2=1936, and cross terms 2*300*44=26400. So 9e4 + 26400 + 1936 = 118336. So 344^2=118336.

So rho = 142000 / 118336 ≈ 1.2 kg/m^3. Wait, I think the density of air is about 1.2 kg/m^3 at standard conditions, so that's correct.

But how does that help me here? Hmm, perhaps another way to approach the problem is using the relation between displacement and pressure.

Wait, another formula I vaguely remember is that the maximum displacement ξ_max can be found using ΔP_max = (B * ω * ξ_max) / v. So same as before.

So I think my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again.

Compute the numerator: 344 * 0.03 = 10.32

Denominator: B * ω = 1.42e5 * 6283.19 ≈ 1.42e5 * 6e3 = 8.52e8, but the exact would be 1.42e5 *6283.19.

Wait, 1.42e5 is 142000.

142000 * 6283.19 = let me compute 142000 * 6283 = ?

Wait, perhaps compute 142 * 6283 = ?

142 * 6000 = 852000

142 * 283 = let's compute 142 * 200=28400, 142*80=11360, 142*3=426.

So 28400 + 11360 = 39760 + 426=40186.

So 852000 + 40186 = 892186.

So 142000 * 6283 = 892,186,000.

Wait, wait, 142 * 6283 = 892,186, so 142000 * 6283 = 89,218,6000? No, that can't be. Wait, 142 times 6283 is 892,186, so 142,000 times 6283 is 892,186 * 1000, which is 892,186,000.

So denominator is 892,186,000 Pa·rad/s.

So ξ_max = 10.32 / 892186000.

Wait, 10.32 / 8.92186e8 = approx 1.156e-8 m, which is 1.156e-8 meters. So in terms of 1e-8 meters, that's 1.156 *1e-8, so 1.156 units.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:1.2. But let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:2.4, B:4.8, C:1.8, D:5.4, E:2.0, F:0.4, G:3.6, H:3.0, I:0.8, J:1.2.

So the correct answer should be 1.2, which is option J.

Wait, but let me re-examine the formula once more to make sure I didn't mix up any terms.

The formula is ΔP = (B ω ξ) / v.

So solving for ξ: ξ = (v ΔP) / (B ω).

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems right, leading to 1.156e-8 m, which is about 1.2 in 1e-8 m units.

So the answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we start with the relationship between the maximum pressure variation \( \Delta P_{\text{max}} \) and the maximum displacement \( \xi_{\text{max}} \) in a sinusoidal sound wave. The formula is:

\[
\Delta P_{\text{max}} = \frac{B \cdot \omega \cdot \xi_{\text{max}}}{v}
\]

Rearranging for \( \xi_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\xi_{\text{max}} = \frac{v \cdot \Delta P_{\text{max}}}{B \cdot \omega}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( \Delta P_{\text{max}} = 3.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{Pa} \)
- \( v = 344 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( B = 1.42 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \)
- \( f = 1000 \, \text{Hz} \), so \( \omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \cdot 1000 \approx 6283.19 \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Calculation:
1. **Numerator**:  
   \[
   v \cdot \Delta P_{\text{max}} = 344 \cdot 3.0 \times 10^{-2} = 10.32
   \]

2. **Denominator**:  
   \[
   B \cdot \omega = 1.42 \times 10^5 \cdot 6283.19 \approx 8.922 \times 10^8
   \]

3. **Maximum Displacement**:  
   \[
   \xi_{\text{max}} = \frac{10.32}{8.922 \times 10^8} \approx 1.156 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}
   \]

Thus, \( \xi_{\text{max}} \approx 1.156 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to approximately \( 1.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \( 1.156 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} \) is **1.2**, which corresponds to **option J**.
