Okay, so I've got this question about the different levels of mental retardation and I need to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that mental retardation is now more commonly referred to as intellectual disability, but the terms might still be similar.

I think the classification is based on IQ levels. From what I recall, the levels are usually categorized as mild, moderate, severe, and profound. But wait, I also think there's a borderline category that's sometimes included. Let me try to piece this together.

So, the options given are from A to J, each listing different categories. I need to find the one that correctly lists the levels in order, probably from least severe to most severe.

I remember that borderline intellectual functioning is a term used when someone's IQ is just below average, but not low enough to be classified as intellectual disability. So borderline might be a separate category or the first level.

Then comes mild, which is the next step. People with mild intellectual disability can often learn practical skills and live independently with some support. Moderate is more severe, requiring more assistance in daily life.

Severe would mean significant difficulty in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors, needing substantial support. Profound is the most severe, where individuals have very limited ability to understand and require full-time care.

Wait, so the order of severity from least to most would be borderline, mild, moderate, severe, profound. Or does the classification start with mild and go up to profound?

Wait, no, I think the classifications without borderline are just mild, moderate, severe, profound. But some systems include borderline as a separate category, especially when the IQ is between 71-84, which is below average but not in the intellectual disability range (which is typically below 70).

Looking back at the options, option F says: (1) borderline, (2) mild, (3) moderate, (4) severe, (5) profound. That sounds right because it includes borderline as the first level.

Option B lists profound as the first, which doesn't make sense because that's the most severe. Similarly, option J starts with mild, then moderate, severe, profound, and borderline last, which is the reverse order.

Wait, no, the correct order in terms of severity would go from the least severe to the most. So borderline (if included) would be first, then mild, then moderate, severe, and profound as the most severe.

Looking at the options, option F lists them in that exact order: borderline, mild, moderate, severe, profound. So that's probably the correct answer.

I should double-check the other options. Option B starts with profound, which is the highest level, so that's not correct. Option J ends with borderline, which is the least severe, so that's wrong.

Yes, I think F is the correct answer because it correctly lists the levels from least to most severe, including borderline as the first category.

The correct classification of the levels of mental retardation (now referred to as intellectual disability) is based on severity, ranging from borderline to profound. Borderline intellectual functioning is characterized by an IQ just below average, while mild, moderate, severe, and profound intellectual disabilities represent increasing levels of need for support. The correct order is: (1) borderline, (2) mild, (3) moderate, (4) severe, (5) profound.

F: (1) Borderline mental retardation, (2) mild mental retardation, (3) moderate mental retardation, (4) severe mental retardation, and (5) profound mental retardation.
