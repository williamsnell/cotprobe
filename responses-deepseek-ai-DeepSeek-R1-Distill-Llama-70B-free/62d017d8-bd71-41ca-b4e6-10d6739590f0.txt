Okay, so I've got this problem here about polynomials and linear operators. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the dimensions of the null space and the range of the derivative operator D on a certain set of polynomials.

So, the set P consists of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5, and their degrees are less than or equal to 7. So each polynomial in P looks like p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x² + ... + a_7 x^7, where each a_i is in Z_5. Right, Z_5 is the integers modulo 5, so each coefficient is 0,1,2,3,4.

The operator D sends p(x) to its derivative p'(x). I remember that the derivative of a polynomial reduces the degree by one for each term. So the derivative of x^k is k x^{k-1}. But wait, in Z_5, the coefficients are mod 5. So, for example, if k is 5, then 5 mod 5 is 0, so the derivative of x^5 would be 0, right?

Wait, but in this case, the coefficients are in Z_5, which is a field, isn't it? So the derivative operator is a linear transformation on the vector space P. So I can think of P as a vector space over Z_5, and D is a linear operator on it.

The problem is asking for the dimensions of the null space (kernel) and the range (image) of D.

I remember that for linear transformations, the dimension of the domain is equal to the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image. So if I can find either the kernel or the image, I can find the other using the rank-nullity theorem.

First, let's find the dimension of the domain P. The polynomials in P have degrees up to 7, which means each polynomial is determined by 8 coefficients (from x^0 to x^7). So the dimension of P is 8.

Now, let's think about the kernel (null space) of D, which is the set of all polynomials p(x) in P such that D(p(x)) = 0. The derivative of p(x) is zero only if p(x) is a constant polynomial, because the derivative of a constant is zero. Wait, but in this case, coefficients are in Z_5, so the constants are just the elements of Z_5. So the kernel should consist of all constant polynomials in P. How many dimensions does the kernel have? Well, the constant polynomials are of the form a_0, so the basis is {1}, which is just one element. So the kernel has dimension 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the derivative, any constant term becomes zero. So any constant polynomial is in the kernel. But are there any other polynomials besides constants that have zero derivatives? No, because if p'(x) = 0, then p(x) must be a constant. So the kernel is indeed 1-dimensional.

So the null space n has dimension 1.

Now, using the rank-nullity theorem, dim(P) = dim(ker D) + dim(im D). So 8 = 1 + dim(r), which means dim(r) is 7. So the range has dimension 7.

So putting that together, n=1 and r=7.

Looking at the options, option E is n=1, r=7. That must be the correct choice.

The problem involves determining the dimensions of the null space (kernel) and range (image) of the derivative operator \( D \) on the vector space \( P \) of polynomials with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) and degree at most 7. 

1. **Dimension of the Domain \( P \):**  
   Polynomials in \( P \) are of the form \( p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots + a_7 x^7 \), where each \( a_i \in \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Since there are 8 coefficients, the dimension of \( P \) is 8.

2. **Null Space (Kernel) of \( D \):**  
   The kernel of \( D \) consists of all polynomials \( p(x) \in P \) such that \( D(p(x)) = 0 \). The derivative of a polynomial is zero if and only if the polynomial is constant. In \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), the constants form a 1-dimensional subspace (spanned by 1). Thus, the dimension of the kernel is 1.

3. **Range (Image) of \( D \):**  
   Using the Rank-Nullity Theorem, \( \dim(P) = \dim(\ker D) + \dim(\text{im } D) \). Substituting the known dimensions, \( 8 = 1 + \dim(\text{im } D) \), so \( \dim(\text{im } D) = 7 \).

Thus, the dimensions of the null space and range of \( D \) are \( n = 1 \) and \( r = 7 \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **E**.
