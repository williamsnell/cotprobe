Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Part (a) is about calculating the work done by gravity when a mass falls. The problem gives me some specifics: the mass is 100 grams, and it falls through 10 cm. The gravitational force is given as F_G = -Mgx hat. Wait, x hat is the unit vector in the x-direction, which is upwards, right? So the force is acting downward because of the negative sign.

I remember that work done by a force is the force multiplied by the displacement in the direction of the force. Oh wait, the formula is W = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and displacement. Since the force (gravity) is downward and the displacement is also downward as the object falls, theta is zero degrees. So cos(0) is 1, meaning maximum work done.

But wait, let me make sure I'm using the right units. The mass is given in grams, and the acceleration due to gravity is given in cm/sec². Right, in the CGS system, mass would be in grams, force in dynes, and acceleration in cm/s².

So first, let's convert everything into the right units. The mass m is 100 grams. Gravity is 980 cm/s². The displacement is 10 cm.

Wait, the formula for work done by gravity should be W = m * g * h, where h is the height the object falls. Because when the object falls, the displacement is in the same direction as the gravitational force, so the work is positive.

Wait, but in this case, the force is -Mg x hat, and the displacement is downward, which would be in the negative x direction. So the displacement vector would be something like -10 cm in x direction. But when calculating the work, the dot product of F and displacement would be (-Mg x hat) · (-d x hat) = Mg*d. So the work done is positive, which makes sense because gravity is helping the motion.

So plugging the numbers in: m is 100 g, g is 980 cm/s², d is 10 cm.

Work W = m * g * d = 100 g * 980 cm/s² * 10 cm.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's calculate 100 * 980 first. 100 times 980 is 98,000. Then multiply by 10 cm: 98,000 *10 is 980,000. So the work done is 980,000 ergs? Because in CGS, 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s². So the unit here would be gram·cm/s² * cm. So yeah, ergs.

So part (a)'s answer is 980,000 ergs.

Now part (b): If the particle was initially at rest, what is its kinetic energy at the end and its velocity?

I remember from the work-energy theorem that the work done by all forces equals the change in kinetic energy. So the work done by gravity here would be the change in kinetic energy.

Since it starts from rest, initial kinetic energy is zero. So the work done is the final kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait: when an object falls under gravity, the work done by gravity is converted into kinetic energy. So the work done in part (a) is 980,000 ergs, which should equal the kinetic energy at the end. So the kinetic energy would be 980,000 ergs.

Wait, but let me confirm. The work done by gravity is positive, so kinetic energy increases by that amount.

So kinetic energy KE = 980,000 ergs.

Now, to find the velocity, I can use the kinetic energy formula: KE = (1/2) m v².

We know KE is 980,000 ergs, m is 100 grams.

Let me plug in the numbers:

980,000 = (1/2) * 100 * v².

Wait, let's solve for v. Multiply both sides by 2:

2 * 980,000 = 100 * v².

So 1,960,000 = 100 v².

Divide both sides by 100:

19,600 = v².

Take the square root of both sides: v = sqrt(19,600). Hmm, sqrt(19600) is 140, because 140 squared is 19600.

Wait, 140 cm/s? Because the unit for velocity would be cm/s.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit high for a 10 cm fall. Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's double-check the units and calculations.

Work done by gravity is W = mgh. So m=100g, g=980 cm/s², h=10 cm.

So W=100 *980 *10 = 980,000 ergs. That's correct.

Kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². So 980,000 = 0.5 *100 *v².

Yes, that becomes 1,960,000 = 100 v².

Divide 1,960,000 by 100: 19,600 = v².

Square root of 19,600 is indeed 140. So v=140 cm/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check.

Looking at the options for part (a) and (b):

Option A: 980,000 ergs, 1.41e2 cm/s → 141 cm/s. That's not matching 140.

Option B: 500,000 ergs... No, because part (a) is 980,000.

Option C: 200,000 ergs, 98 cm/s. No.

Option D: 980,000 ergs, 200 cm/s. But our calculation is 140.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Wait, perhaps I confused grams and kilograms somewhere? No, because in CGS units, mass is grams, and g is 980 cm/s², which is correct. So when using KE=1/2 m v², m is 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg? No, wait, no. No, in CGS, mass is in grams, but when using KE in ergs, the formula is correct as KE = (1/2) m (g) v², where m is in grams.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, no, in CGS, mass is in grams, velocity in cm/s. Then the kinetic energy in ergs is correct with 1/2 m v².

So 1/2 * mass (g) * (v cm/s)^2 = ergs.

So 1/2 * 100 g * (v)^2 (cm²/s²) → erg.

So yes, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but 140 cm/s is 1.4e2 cm/s. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 980,000 ergs, 1.41e2 cm/s → 141 cm/s.

Option D: 980,000 ergs, 2.00e2 cm/s → 200 cm/s.

Hmm, but our calculation says 140. So none of the options matches exactly. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of g. Wait, the problem says g is approximately 980 cm/s². So that's correct.

Wait, let me re-calculate the velocity.

KE = (1/2) m v² → v = sqrt(2 KE / m)

KE is 980,000 ergs. m is 100 g.

So 2* KE = 1,960,000.

Divide by mass (100 g): 19,600.

sqrt(19,600) is 140 cm/s.

So velocity is 140 cm/s.

Looking at the options, none of the options for (b) have 140 cm/s except option A is 141, which is close but not exact. Wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question uses g as 1000 cm/s² instead of 980. Let me see. The problem says g is approximately 980. So that's correct.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the work done is only half of that. Oh no, wait, the work done is mgh, which is correct. So the KE is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of g or the mass?

Wait, let me check the question again. The mass is 100 grams, correct. The displacement is 10 cm. Correct.

Hmm, another possibility: Did I mix up work done by gravity with the change in potential energy? No, because in the work-energy theorem, the work done by gravity is equal to the change in KE. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, let's see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 980,000 ergs, 1.41e2 → 141 cm/s.

Option D: 980k ergs, 200 cm/s.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me compute 140^2: 140*140=19600. Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using different units. Wait, let me try to compute the velocity using mgh = ½ mv².

So m g h = (1/2) m v² → gh = v² / 2 → v = sqrt(2 g h).

Wait, that might be a simpler way. Let's try that.

g is 980 cm/s², h is 10 cm.

So 2 g h = 2 *980 *10= 19600.

v = sqrt(19600) = 140 cm/s.

Same result. So why is option A 141 cm/s?

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to use g as 1000 cm/s² for approximation. Let me see.

If g is taken as 1000, then the work would be 100 *1000 *10 = 1,000,000 ergs. And velocity would be sqrt(2*1000*10) = sqrt(20,000)=~141.42 cm/s, which is 1.41e2 cm/s.

Ah, that's where option A comes from. But the question states g is 980 cm/s², not 1000. So perhaps the correct option is not present, and I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let's re-examine the options:

Looking at the options:

Option A: part (a) 980k ergs, part (b) 1.41e2 cm/s.

If the correct part (a) is 980k ergs, and part (b) velocity is 140 cm/s, but none of the options have 140, except perhaps option I is 2.2e2 cm/s, which is 220.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of the work done. Oh wait, the work done by gravity is positive because the force and displacement are in the same direction. But in the given force equation, F is negative, but displacement is also negative, so the product is positive.

Wait, another approach: W = F dot d.

F is -Mg in x direction, and displacement d is -10 cm in x (since it's moving downward). So F ⋅ d is (-Mg)(-d) in scalar terms, which is Mg d.

So that gives 100 *980 *10 = 980,000 ergs. So part (a) is correct.

So the options for part (b) don't have 140, but maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the magnitude, and perhaps I should have considered that the work done is positive, but in terms of kinetic energy, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the work done by gravity is actually the negative of mgh because the force is opposite to displacement. Wait no, because when the object falls, the displacement is in the same direction as the gravitational force. Wait, the gravitational force is downward, and the displacement is downward. So the angle is zero degrees, so the work is positive.

Wait, but in the problem statement, F_G is -Mg x hat, which is upward negative direction. So if displacement is downward, say, -d x hat, then the work is F ⋅ d = (-Mg)(-d) = Mg d, which is positive. So yes, work done is positive, which increases KE.

So the calculations are correct. So the velocity should be 140 cm/s.

Looking back at the options, none of the options with 980,000 ergs in part (a) have 140 cm/s in part (b). Wait, let me check:

Option A: part (a) 980k ergs, part (b) 1.41e2 (141 cm/s).

Option D: part (a) 980k ergs, v=2e2 (200 cm/s).

Option G: part (a) 980k ergs, v=98 cm/s.

Wait, so none have 140. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when the object falls 10 cm, the work done is mgh, but m is 100 grams, g=980, h=10 cm.

Wait, another possibility: did I use the wrong mass? The mass is 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg, but in CGS, the mass unit is grams, and g is in cm/s², so the calculation should be correct.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh! Did I make a mistake in the calculation of v? Let me compute sqrt(19600) again. 140 squared is 19600. Yes, correct. So 140 cm/s.

But looking at the options, none match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question meant to say that the displacement is 10 meters instead of 10 cm? No, the question says 10 cm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity using energy conservation but considering potential energy.

Wait, the change in potential energy is m g h, which is the work done by gravity. So that equals the kinetic energy.

But same result as before.

Hmm. Maybe I should check the options again. Let me list the options:

Option A: (a) 980,000 ergs, (b) 1.41e2 cm/s → 141 cm/s.

Option D: (a) 980,000 ergs, (b) 200 cm/s.

Wait, 200 cm/s is 2 m/s, which seems high for a 10 cm drop, but perhaps.

Wait, using g=980 cm/s², h=10 cm.

v^2 = 2 g h = 2 *980 *10 = 19600 → v=140 cm/s.

So 140 cm/s.

But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question uses different units for mass? Like, 100 grams is 0.1 kg, but in CGS, we don't convert mass to kg.

Wait, no, because in CGS, mass is in grams, so everything should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me recheck: the mass is 100 grams, yes.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is not present, but in the options given, the closest is option A, which has 980,000 ergs and 141 cm/s. But that would be the case if g were 1000 cm/s².

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use g=1000 for simplicity, which would give:

Work done: 100 *1000 *10=1,000,000 ergs. But that's not part (a)'s value in the options. So part (a) would be 1e6 ergs, but the options don't have that except option J, which has 1e6 ergs but a different velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use g=980 cm/s² but to calculate the velocity as sqrt(2gh), which would be sqrt(2*980*10)=sqrt(19600)=140 cm/s. So none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to choose the closest option. Option A has 980k ergs and 141 cm/s. That's probably using g=1000, which is an approximation. But the question states g=980, so perhaps the intended answer is option A, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of velocity. Let me compute it again.

KE = 980,000 ergs = (1/2) * 100 * v².

So 980,000 = 50 * v² → v² = 980,000 /50 = 19,600 → v=140 cm/s.

Yes, correct.

But looking at the options, none have 140. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but maybe the velocity is 141 when using more precise calculations, like using g=980 exactly.

Wait, let's try that. Let me compute the velocity using g=980 cm/s².

v = sqrt(2 g h) → sqrt(2 *980 *10) → sqrt(19600) = 140 cm/s.

So 140 cm/s is exact with g=980. So perhaps the options intended to use g=1000, leading to 141 cm/s, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question made a mistake in the options, and the correct choice is not present. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should check the other options.

Looking at option B: 500,000 ergs and 141 cm/s. But part (a) can't be 500k because 100*980*10 is 980k.

Option C: 200k ergs, 98 cm/s. No, that's even less.

Option D: 980k ergs, 200 cm/s. That would require v=200, which would require KE= (1/2)*100*(200)^2= 2,000,000 ergs, which is double what we have. So that's not correct.

Option E: 500k ergs, 120 cm/s. No.

Option F: 1.2e6 ergs, 110 cm/s. No.

Option G: 980k ergs, 98 cm/s. That would mean KE is (1/2)*100*98² = 480,500 ergs, which is not 980k.

Option H: 800k ergs, 125 cm/s. No.

Option I: 980k ergs, 220 cm/s. That would require KE of 2,420,000 ergs, which is way
