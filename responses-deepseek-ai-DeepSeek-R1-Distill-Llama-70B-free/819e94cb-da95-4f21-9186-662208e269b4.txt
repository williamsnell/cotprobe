Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about achromatic prism combinations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about constructing an achromatic prism using crown and flint glass. I remember that an achromatic prism is designed to focus light of different wavelengths at the same point, which helps in reducing chromatic aberration. So the idea is that the dispersion (spreading of light) caused by one prism is counteracted by the other.

The given data includes the refractive indices for both crown and flint glasses at three different wavelengths: 6563 Å (red), 5893 Å (yellow), and 4861 Å (blue). The crown glass has refractive indices 1.5146, 1.5171, 1.5233, and flint has 1.6224, 1.6272, 1.6385 for these wavelengths respectively.

The crown-glass prism has an angle of 10 degrees. I need to find the angle for the flint-glass prism.

Wait, I think the key here is the concept of angular dispersion. For an achromatic combination, the total dispersion should be zero. Each prism disperses the light, but the combination should cancel each other's dispersion.

The formula for angular dispersion (Δθ) for a prism is given by Δθ = (α)(n_avg), where α is the apex angle of the prism, and n_avg is related to the refractive indices. Or wait, maybe it's Δθ = (t * (n2 - n1)) / (d), but that's for thin prisms and relates to the angle. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: The angular dispersion for a single prism is given by (n_avg - 1) * α, where α is the apex angle. Or is it (n_high - n_low) * α? Let me think.

Wait, I remember that the angular dispersion δ is the angle between the extreme rays (like red and blue) after passing through the prism. The formula is δ = (t) * (n_red - n_blue) / (d), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the angular dispersion is (n_2 - n_1) * α, where α is the apex angle, and n_2 and n_1 are the refractive indices for the two extreme wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the condition for an achromatic combination. The sum of the angular dispersions of the two prisms should be zero. So for the crown and flint prisms, the total dispersion should cancel out.

So, the condition would be: (n_crown_red - n_crown_blue) * α_crown + (n_flint_red - n_flint_blue) * α_flint = 0.

Wait, but wait, in achromatic lenses, the condition involves the Abbe numbers, which are the reciprocals of the dispersion. For prisms, I'm not so sure, but maybe a similar approach applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the angular dispersion of the crown prism is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the flint prism.

So, for each color, the net angular deviation should be the same so that all colors exit at the same angle. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me clarify. For a single prism, the angular deviation δ for a particular wavelength is approximately given by δ = (n - 1) * α, where α is the apex angle. But this is the deviation for a specific wavelength. The angular dispersion is the difference between deviations for two different wavelengths, say red and blue. So dispersion D = δ_red - δ_blue = (n_red - n_blue) * α.

So for the two prisms, the total dispersion should be zero. So:

D_crown + D_flint = 0.

Which gives:

(n_crown_red - n_crown_blue) * α_crown + (n_flint_red - n_flint_blue) * α_flint = 0.

Wait, but the problem states that the prisms are arranged such that their dispersions cancel. So the sum of their angular dispersions should be zero.

Let me compute the dispersions for each prism.

First, for the crown glass. The refractive indices for red (6563Å) is 1.5146, blue (4861Å) is 1.5233. So n_red = 1.5146, n_blue = 1.5233.

So, the dispersion for crown is D_crown = (n_red - n_blue) * α_crown.

Wait, but wait, red has a lower refractive index than blue, so n_red < n_blue. So (n_red - n_blue) would be negative, and since α_crown is 10°, D_crown would be negative. But the flint prism should compensate for that.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate D_crown.

Wait, no: D_crown = (n_blue - n_red) * α_crown. Because angular dispersion D is the deviation between blue and red. Since blue has higher n, it's deviated more. So D_crown = (n_blue - n_red) * α_crown.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula for angular dispersion D is (n_high - n_low) * α, where n_high is for the lower wavelength (blue) and n_low for the higher wavelength (red).

So for crown glass, n_red=1.5146, n_blue=1.5233. So n_blue - n_red = 0.0087. So D_crown = 0.0087 * 10° = 0.087 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the actual formula might involve (n - 1)α, but perhaps for each color, the deviation is (n-1)α, so the difference would be (n_blue - n_red) * α.

So, D_crown = (1.5233 - 1.5146) * 10 = 0.0087 * 10 = 0.087 degrees.

Similarly, for flint glass, n_red=1.6224, n_blue=1.6385. So (n_blue - n_red) = 0.0161.

The flint prism's dispersion would be D_flint = (1.6385 - 1.6224) * α_flint = 0.0161 * α_flint.

Now, for the combination to be achromatic, the sum of the dispersions should be zero:

D_crown + D_flint = 0.

Wait, no. Because the prisms are in combination. Wait, if the crown prism causes a positive dispersion, the flint should cause a negative. Or do they both cause positive dispersion? Wait, no. Actually, both prisms would cause dispersion, but perhaps in opposite directions, depending on their arrangement. So let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the angular dispersions should add up to zero. So D_crown + D_flint = 0.

But wait, let's compute D_crown and D_flint.

Wait, D_crown is positive because blue is deviated more than red. Similarly, D_flint would also be positive because flint has higher dispersion. Wait, but if I use the same sign convention, then the sum would be positive, so that wouldn't cancel. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the flint prism is arranged in the opposite direction, so its dispersion is negative. So the total D_total = D_crown - D_flint = 0.

Wait, that would make sense. So D_crown = D_flint.

So,

(1.5233 - 1.5146) * 10° = (1.6385 - 1.6224) * α_flint.

Wait, that gives:

0.0087 * 10 = 0.0161 * α_flint.

So 0.087 = 0.0161 * α_flint.

Solving for α_flint: α_flint = 0.087 / 0.0161 ≈ 5.406 degrees.

Looking at the options, option F is 5.40 degrees, which would be the closest.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because the condition for an achromatic doublet in lenses is that the dispersions (in terms of Abbe numbers) satisfy a certain condition, but for prisms, I'm not sure if the approach is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the total deviation is the same for all wavelengths. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The condition for an achromatic prism combination is that the combination's angular dispersion is zero. So the sum of the individual angular dispersions equals zero.

Angular dispersion for each prism is (n_blue - n_red) * α.

So, for the crown prism, D1 = (n_crown_blue - n_crown_red) * α_crown.

For the flint prism, D2 = (n_flint_blue - n_flint_red) * α_flint.

The total dispersion D_total = D1 + D2 = 0.

So:

(n_crown_blue - n_crown_red) * α_crown + (n_flint_blue - n_flint_red) * α_flint = 0.

Plugging in the numbers:

n_crown_blue = 1.5233
n_crown_red = 1.5146
n_flint_blue = 1.6385
n_flint_red = 1.6224

So,

(1.5233 - 1.5146) * 10 + (1.6385 - 1.6224) * α_flint = 0.

Calculates to:

(0.0087)*10 + (0.0161)*α_flint =0.

0.087 + 0.0161 * α_flint = 0.

So,

0.0161 * α_flint = -0.087.

Wait, negative alpha? That doesn't make sense because the angle can't be negative. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, maybe the arrangement is such that one prism's dispersion is subtracted from the other. Because if one prism is made of crown and the other of flint, and they are arranged in such a way that their dispersions oppose each other. So perhaps the correct condition is D1 = -D2.

Wait, but in that case, we'd have:

(1.5233 - 1.5146)*10 + (1.6385 - 1.6224)*α_flint = 0.

Which gives 0.087 + 0.0161 * α_flint = 0.

So solving for α_flint: α_flint = -0.087 / 0.0161 ≈ -5.406 degrees.

Negative angle doesn't make sense, so perhaps I should have D1 = -D2, meaning:

(1.5233 - 1.5146)*10 = - (1.6385 - 1.6224)*α_flint.

So,

0.087 = - (0.0161) * α_flint.

That would give α_flint = -0.087 / 0.0161 ≈ -5.406 degrees.

Which is still negative. Hmm, I must be getting something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angular dispersion for flint is negative because it's arranged in the opposite way. So, D_total = D_crown - D_flint =0.

So,

(0.0087)*10 - (0.0161)*α_flint = 0.

Which gives 0.087 = 0.0161 * α_flint.

So,

α_flint = 0.087 / 0.0161 ≈ 5.406 degrees.

That makes sense, and that's a positive angle. So the flint prism would have an angle of approximately 5.4 degrees, which is option F.

So I think the correct answer is F:5.40 degrees.

To construct an achromatic prism combination, the total angular dispersion must be zero. This means the angular dispersion caused by the crown-glass prism must be canceled by the angular dispersion of the flint-glass prism. The angular dispersion for a prism is given by:

\[
D = (n_{\text{blue}} - n_{\text{red}}) \cdot \alpha
\]

where \(n_{\text{blue}}\) and \(n_{\text{red}}\) are the refractive indices for blue and red light, respectively, and \(\alpha\) is the apex angle of the prism.

### Step 1: Calculate the angular dispersion of the crown-glass prism
For the crown-glass prism:
- \(n_{\text{red}} = 1.5146\), \(n_{\text{blue}} = 1.5233\)
- \(\alpha_{\text{crown}} = 10^\circ\)

\[
D_{\text{crown}} = (n_{\text{blue}} - n_{\text{red}}) \cdot \alpha_{\text{crown}} = (1.5233 - 1.5146) \cdot 10 = 0.0087 \cdot 10 = 0.087^\circ
\]

### Step 2: Set up the condition for achromatic combination
For the combination to be achromatic, the total angular dispersion must be zero:

\[
D_{\text{crown}} + D_{\text{flint}} = 0
\]

Substituting \(D_{\text{flint}} = (n_{\text{blue}} - n_{\text{red}}) \cdot \alpha_{\text{flint}}\):

\[
0.087 + (1.6385 - 1.6224) \cdot \alpha_{\text{flint}} = 0
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the angle of the flint-glass prism
For the flint-glass prism:
- \(n_{\text{red}} = 1.6224\), \(n_{\text{blue}} = 1.6385\)

\[
D_{\text{flint}} = (1.6385 - 1.6224) \cdot \alpha_{\text{flint}} = 0.0161 \cdot \alpha_{\text{flint}}
\]

Substituting into the achromatic condition:

\[
0.087 + 0.0161 \cdot \alpha_{\text{flint}} = 0
\]

\[
0.0161 \cdot \alpha_{\text{flint}} = -0.087
\]

\[
\alpha_{\text{flint}} = \frac{-0.087}{0.0161} \approx -5.406^\circ
\]

Since the angle cannot be negative, the magnitude of the angle is:

\[
\alpha_{\text{flint}} \approx 5.40^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle of the flint-glass prism must be approximately **5.40 degrees**.
