Alright, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the question is about the reserve ratio and the Fed buying Treasury securities. Hmm, I remember that when the Fed buys securities, it's part of their monetary policy, specifically open market operations. So, when they buy, they're increasing the money supply, right? Wait, or is it the opposite? Oh wait, no, buying securities injects money into the economy. Because when the Fed buys from banks, the banks get more reserves. So that would increase the money supply.

Wait, but the reserve ratio is 10%, so that means banks have to keep 10% of their deposits as reserves. So if the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, the banks' reserves increase by $1 million. Because they sold securities to the Fed, so they get cash.

But how does this affect the money supply? Oh right, the money multiplier effect. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So here, the reserve ratio is 10%, which is 0.1. So the money multiplier is 1/0.1 = 10. That means that the initial increase in reserves can lead to a 10 times increase in the money supply.

Wait, but in this case, the Fed is buying from the banks, which increases the banks' reserves. So the banks can now lend more. So the initial injection is $1 million in reserves, which allows banks to create more money through loans. So the total money supply should increase by $1 million times the money multiplier, which is 10. So that would be $10 million increase in the money supply.

But wait, the question states that money demand is perfectly elastic. Hmm, what does that mean? Oh right, if money demand is perfectly elastic, it means that the demand for money is not sensitive to interest rates. So people will hold whatever money is supplied. So they won't adjust their money holdings based on interest rate changes. So in this scenario, when the Fed increases the money supply, the interest rate will adjust.

Wait, when the Fed buys securities, the money supply increases. More money supply lowers the interest rate because there's more money chasing fewer bonds, so bond prices go up and interest rates go down. So lower interest rates would stimulate aggregate demand (AD) as borrowing becomes cheaper.

So putting it all together: Fed buys $1M, which increases reserves by $1M. With a 10% reserve ratio, the money multiplier is 10, so money supply increases by $10M. Lower interest rate, which increases AD.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says money supply increases by $10M, lowers interest rate and increases AD. That matches what I thought.

Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, does the money supply increase by the full multiplier in this scenario? Or is there a different effect when money demand is perfectly elastic? Because if money demand is perfectly elastic, it might mean that the demand for money adjusts to whatever the supply is. Or does it mean that people will hold any amount of money regardless of the interest rate? So, maybe the money supply increase is exactly what the Fed injected, without the multiplier effect because demand adjusts. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The money multiplier comes from the banking system's ability to lend based on reserves, which depends on the reserve ratio. Money demand elasticity affects how people hold money, but the initial injection is through the Fed's action.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing concepts. Let me clarify: The money supply is determined by the Fed and the banking system. If the Fed increases reserves, and if banks can lend, then the money supply increases by the multiplier. But if money demand is elastic, perhaps people don't hold more money than they need, but that might not affect the multiplier. Or maybe in this scenario, since money demand is perfectly elastic, the increase in money supply is just the $1 million because people will adjust their holdings. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused now.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The Fed buys $1 million in securities from banks. So the banks' reserves go up by $1 million. The reserve ratio is 10%, so banks are required to keep 10% of deposits as reserves. So if they have excess reserves, they can make loans. Each loan increases deposits, which in turn increases required reserves, but the money multiplier effect means the total increase is 10 times the initial injection. So money supply should increase by $10 million.

But if money demand is perfectly elastic, does that change how much money is actually in circulation? Hmm. Money demand is the desire to hold money. If it's perfectly elastic, that means the quantity of money demanded doesn't change with interest rates. So when the Fed increases the money supply, the interest rate adjusts to equilibrate. So, perhaps in this case, the money supply does increase by $10 million, leading to lower interest rates and higher AD.

So looking back at the options, option C says exactly that: money supply increases by $10M, lowers interest rate, increases AD.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The question involves the Federal Reserve buying $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, with a reserve ratio of 10%. When the Fed buys securities, it increases the banks' reserves, which can lead to an expansion of the money supply through the money multiplier effect. The money multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{reserve ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10 \). Therefore, the initial $1 million increase in reserves can lead to a $10 million increase in the money supply.

The question also specifies that money demand is perfectly elastic, meaning the quantity of money demanded does not change with interest rates. This implies that people will hold whatever money is supplied, and the interest rate will adjust to equilibrate the market. When the money supply increases, the interest rate falls because there is more money chasing fewer bonds, which stimulates aggregate demand (AD) by making borrowing cheaper.

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is the one that reflects a $10 million increase in the money supply, a lower interest rate, and an increase in AD. This matches option C.
