Question:

Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson’s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson’s individual return?

Options:

A: $132,000
B: $160,000
C: $140,000
D: $100,000
E: $150,000
F: $210,000
G: $188,000
H: $28,000
I: $180,000
J: $200,000

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tax question here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation in terms of how income is reported on an individual's tax return.

Alright, the scenario is that Carson owns 40% of a C corporation. The corporation made $400,000 in taxable income and distributed $70,000 in cash dividends. Carson reported $28,000 in gross income, which makes sense because 40% of $70,000 is $28,000. So in a C corporation, the dividends are taxable to the shareholder, right? So Carson would get that $28k added to his income.

But the question is asking, what if the corporation was an S corporation instead? And the distributions were proportionate. So I need to figure out how much Carson would report then.

Hmm, I remember that S corporations pass through their income to shareholders, who then report it on their personal tax returns. So the corporation's income is taxed at the individual level, not at the corporate level. But wait, does that mean the entire income is passed through regardless of whether it's distributed as dividends?

In a C corporation, the corporation pays taxes on its income first, and then when dividends are distributed, shareholders pay taxes again on those dividends. That's double taxation. But in an S corporation, it's a pass-through entity. So the corporation doesn't pay taxes; instead, the shareholders report their share of the income, whether or not they receive distributions.

So in this case, the S corporation's taxable income is $400,000. Since Carson owns 40%, he would have to report 40% of that on his tax return, right? Let me do the math. 40% of 400,000 is 160,000. So he would report $160,000 as his share of the corporate income.

But wait, what about the distributions? In an S corporation, distributions are generally not taxable because they're considered a return of the shareholder's basis. However, the question says the distributions were proportionate. So Carson would get 40% of $70,000, which is $28,000 as a distribution. But in an S corporation scenario, since he's already reporting his share of the income, the distribution isn't taxed again. So he doesn't report the $28k as income; it's just reducing his basis.

Wait, but the question is about how much he would have reported. So he would have to include his share of the S corporation's income, which is $160,000, regardless of whether the money is distributed. So his individual return would show $160,000 from the S corporation.

Looking back at the options, option B is $160,000. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine how much income Carson would report if the corporation were an S corporation, we need to understand the key difference between C corporations and S corporations. In a C corporation, dividends are taxable to the shareholder, whereas in an S corporation, the corporation's income is passed through to the shareholders, who report their share on their individual tax returns, regardless of distributions.

Here, the corporation's taxable income is $400,000, and Carson owns 40% of the corporation. As an S corporation, Carson would report 40% of the corporation's taxable income on his individual tax return. 

Calculating Carson's share of the income:
$$
400,000 \times 0.40 = 160,000
$$

The $70,000 in distributions is irrelevant for income reporting purposes in an S corporation because distributions are considered a return of basis and are not taxable. Therefore, Carson would report $160,000 in income on his individual tax return.

The correct answer is **B: $160,000**.
