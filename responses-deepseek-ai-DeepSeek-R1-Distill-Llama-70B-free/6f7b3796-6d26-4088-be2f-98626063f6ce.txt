Okay, so I've got this question here about the percentage of US GDP that agriculture made up as of 2015. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I know that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country. So the question is asking what portion of that total comes from agriculture in the US around 2015.

I remember that the US has a very diversified economy, with major sectors like services, manufacturing, technology, healthcare, and finance. Agriculture, while important, isn't the largest sector. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact percentage.

I think back to some basic economics classes. I recall that in many developed countries, the agricultural sector contributes a smaller percentage to GDP compared to developing nations. For example, in countries where most people work in farming, agriculture might be 30-40% or more of GDP. But in the US, it's much lower.

Wait, so if I remember correctly, the US agricultural sector is around 1% or maybe a bit higher of GDP. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think of other clues. I've heard that the US is a major exporter of agricultural products, which might make one think it's a larger percentage. But GDP is about the value added within the country, not just exports.

I think about other sectors. Manufacturing in the US is maybe around 20%, services much higher, like 80% or so. So if all sectors add up to 100%, and services are the bulk, agriculture must be a smaller slice. Maybe 1%? Or perhaps a bit more.

Wait, I've heard somewhere that it's about 1% of GDP but employs around 2% of the workforce. That might make sense because farming is more labor-intensive but doesn't contribute as much to the total GDP due to higher productivity. So that would put it at around 1%.

Looking at the options, option B is 1%, option J is 3%. So which is it? I'm a bit confused. Another thought: sometimes people might confuse the percentage of the workforce with GDP contribution. If 2% of the workforce is in agriculture, perhaps the GDP is similar or a bit lower. But I think the GDP percentage is actually lower than the employment percentage because each worker's output might not be as high as in other sectors.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. I think I've also read that including related industries like food processing and forestry, the total might be higher, but the question specifically mentions agriculture, so those related sectors might not be included. So focusing solely on agriculture, it's probably around 1%.

Wait, another angle: I remember that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports on the share of agriculture in GDP. From what I recall, their data shows that agriculture's share is just over 1% of GDP. So that would point to option B: 1%.

But wait, maybe I'm forgetting something. Are there other factors? For example, does this include only farming, or also things like fishing and forestry? If it's a broader category, maybe it's a bit higher. But the question says "agriculture," so I think it's just farming.

So putting it all together, I'm leaning towards option B: 1%.

As of 2015, agriculture made up about 1% of the total US GDP. This aligns with the understanding that while agriculture is a significant sector in terms of exports and employment, its contribution to the overall GDP is relatively small compared to other sectors like services and manufacturing. The US economy is highly diversified, and agriculture's share is lower due to the high productivity of the sector and the dominance of other industries. 

Answer: B
