Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man is paying back a $1,000 loan in 15 equal annual installments with an interest rate of 4 percent. After his tenth payment, he wants to pay the remaining balance all at once. I need to figure out how much he still owes at that point. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when dealing with loans and installments, it's an annuity problem. Specifically, it's an ordinary annuity because the payments are made at the end of each period. The formula for the payment (PMT) on an annuity is PMT = PV * [i(1+i)^n] / [(1+i)^n - 1], where PV is the present value (the loan amount), i is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

So the loan is $1,000, interest is 4% annually, and there are 15 payments. Let me plug these into the formula. PMT = 1000 * [0.04(1+0.04)^15] / [(1+0.04)^15 -1]. Wait, but I should calculate (1+0.04)^15 first. Let me compute that. 1.04^15, I think that's approximately 1.04^10 is about 1.4802, and then 1.04^5 is about 1.2167, so multiplying gives roughly 1.4802 * 1.2167 ≈ 1.800. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for each payment.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the present value of an annuity formula to find each payment, then calculate the outstanding balance after 10 payments. Alternatively, since after 10 payments, the remaining balance would be the present value of the remaining 5 payments.

Wait, but I think another approach is to calculate the outstanding balance using the loan balance formula. The formula for the remaining balance after k payments is: 

Balance = PV * [(1+i)^n -1] / [(1+i)^n] - PMT * [((1+i)^k -1)/i]

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the outstanding balance after 10 payments by calculating the present value of the remaining 5 payments. That is, the present value of an annuity due for the next 5 years, discounted back 10 years? Wait, no, after 10 payments, the remaining payments are the next 5. So I can compute the present value of those 5 payments at year 10, which becomes the outstanding balance.

Alternatively, the balance after k periods can be calculated as:

Balance = PV * (1+i)^k - PMT * [ ((1+i)^k -1)/i ]

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me think again. The balance after k payments would be the present value of all future payments, which are the remaining (n -k) payments. So yes, it's the present value of an ordinary annuity of (n -k) periods.

So after 10 payments, the remaining balance is the present value of 5 more annual payments of PMT at 4% interest.

So first I need to find the annual payment PMT, then compute the present value of the next 5 payments to find the outstanding balance.

Let me compute PMT first.

PMT = PV * [i (1+i)^n ] / [ (1+i)^n -1 ]

PV = $1000, i = 0.04, n=15.

Compute numerator: 0.04 * (1.04)^15

Compute denominator: (1.04)^15 -1

I need to calculate (1.04)^15. Let me compute that accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

1.04^1 = 1.04
2: 1.0816
3: 1.124864
4: approx 1.16985856
5: ~1.2166529
6: 1.26531901
7: 1.3159318
8: 1.368569
9: 1.4233128
10: 1.4802443
11: 1.5394546
12: 1.6010327
13: 1.6650731
14: 1.7316768
15: 1.8009433

So, (1.04)^15 ≈ 1.8009433.

So numerator = 0.04 * 1.8009433 ≈ 0.0720377.

Denominator = 1.8009433 - 1 = 0.8009433.

So PMT = 1000 * (0.0720377 / 0.8009433) ≈ 1000 * 0.0899 ≈ $89.90 per year.

Wait, let me compute 0.0720377 divided by 0.8009433.

0.0720377 / 0.8009433 ≈ 0.0899. So yes, PMT ≈ 89.90.

Wait, let me check that more accurately. 0.0720377 ÷ 0.8009433.

Let me compute it step by step. 0.0720377 ÷ 0.8009433.

Well, 0.8 * 0.09 is 0.072. So 0.8009433 * 0.09 = approx 0.072085. So 0.0720377 is a bit less than that. So the PMT is approximately 89.90, let's say approximately $89.90 per annum.

Wait, perhaps using a more precise calculation. Let me compute 0.0720377 / 0.8009433.

0.8009433 ) 0.0720377 (0.09

0.8009433 * 0.09 = 0.0720849. So 0.0720377 is 0.0720377 - 0.0720849 = -0.0000472. So that's very close to 0.09, so PMT ≈ 89.90, maybe 89.90.

So each annual payment is approximately $89.90.

Now, after 10 payments, he's made 10 payments, and wants to pay the remaining balance. So the remaining balance is the present value of the next 5 payments of $89.90 each, discounted at 4% per annum.

So PV_remaining = PMT * [1 - (1 + i)^-m ] / i, where m is 5.

So PV_remaining = 89.90 * [1 - (1.04)^-5 ] / 0.04.

Compute (1.04)^-5.

1.04^5 is approximately 1.2166529, so (1.04)^-5 ≈ 1 / 1.2166529 ≈ 0.821927.

So 1 - 0.821927 ≈ 0.178073.

So PV_remaining = 89.90 * (0.178073 / 0.04)

Wait, no, the formula is [1 - (1+i)^-m ] / i.

So [0.178073] / 0.04 = 4.4518.

So PV_remaining = 89.90 * 4.4518 ≈ let's compute that.

80 * 4.4518 = 356.14.

9.90 *4.4518 ≈ approx 44.08.

So total ≈ 356.14 +44.08≈ 400.22.

Wait, that's about $400.22. But wait, let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, 89.90 * 4.4518.

89.90 *4= 359.6

89.90 *0.4518 ≈ 89.90 *0.4=35.96, 89.90*0.0518≈4.66.

So 35.96 +4.66≈40.62.

So total 359.6 +40.62= 400.22.

So the remaining balance is approximately $400.22. But looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. The options are A:600.30, B:329.50, C:500.20, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating PMT. Let me recalculate PMT more accurately.

PMT formula: 1000 = PMT * [1 - (1.04)^-15 ] / 0.04.

Wait, wait, no. The PMT formula is PV = PMT * [1 - (1+i)^-n ] / i.

So PMT = PV * i / [1 - (1+i)^-n ].

Wait, yes, I think I had the formula right earlier.

So let me compute [1 - (1.04)^-15 ] / 0.04.

(1.04)^-15 = 1/(1.04)^15 ≈ 1/1.800943 ≈ 0.554969.

So 1 - 0.554969 = 0.445031.

Divide by 0.04: 0.445031 / 0.04 = 11.125775.

So PMT = 1000 * 0.04 / (1 - (1.04)^-15 ) = 1000 * (0.04 / 0.445031 ) ≈ 1000 * 0.0899.

Wait, 0.04 / 0.445031 is approx 0.0899.

So PMT = 1000 * 0.0899 ≈ 89.90, which matches earlier.

So maybe the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the balance after 10 payments using the formula for the remaining balance on an installment loan.

The formula is:

Balance = PV * (1+i)^k - PMT * [ ( (1+i)^k -1 ) / i ]

Where k is the number of payments made.

So in this case, k=10, i=0.04.

So compute:

PV*(1.04)^10 = 1000 * (1.04)^10.

Earlier, I had 1.04^10 ≈ 1.480244.

So 1000 *1.480244 = 1480.244.

Now, compute PMT * [ (1.04)^10 -1 ) / 0.04 ].

PMT is 89.90.

(1.04)^10 -1 = 0.480244.

So 0.480244 / 0.04 = 12.0061.

So PMT *12.0061 = 89.90 *12.0061.

Let me compute 89.90 *12 = 1078.80.

89.90 *0.0061 ≈ 0.549.

So total ≈ 1078.80 + 0.549 ≈ 1079.35.

So the balance is 1480.244 - 1079.35 ≈ 400.894.

Hmm, about $400.89. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.04)^10 more accurately. Let me compute 1.04^10 step by step.

1.04^1=1.04

2: 1.0816

3: 1.124864

4: 1.16985856

5: 1.2166529024

6: 1.265319018

7: 1.31593178

8: 1.36856905

9: 1.42331281

10: 1.480244285

So (1.04)^10 ≈1.480244285.

So PV*(1.04)^10 = 1000 * 1.480244285 ≈ 1480.244.

PMT is 89.90.

Now, compute the sum of the PMTs: PMT * [ ((1+i)^k -1 ) / i ]

So [ (1.04^10 -1 ) / 0.04 ] = (1.480244285 - 1) / 0.04 = 0.480244285 / 0.04 = 12.00610714.

So 89.90 * 12.00610714 = let's compute that.

89.90 *12 = 1078.80.

89.90 *0.00610714 ≈ approximately 0.549.

So total ≈1078.80+0.549≈1079.349.

So the balance is 1480.244 - 1079.349 = 400.895.

Hmm, so around $400.90.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: $458.70, but that's higher. Or perhaps I made a mistake in selecting the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the correct approach is to find the present value of the remaining 5 payments at the time of the 10th payment.

So, after 10 payments, the remaining payments are 5. So the present value at year 10 would be the sum of the next 5 payments discounted back to year 10.

But wait, the present value at year 10 would be the same as calculating the present value of 5 payments of PMT at 4% interest.

So using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

PV = PMT * [ 1 - (1+i)^-m ] / i.

Where m=5, i=0.04, PMT=89.90.

So, let's compute [1 - (1.04)^-5 ] / 0.04.

(1.04)^5=1.2166529, so (1.04)^-5≈0.821927.

So 1 - 0.821927 ≈ 0.178073.

Divide by 0.04: 0.178073 /0.04≈4.4518.

Then PV = 89.90 *4.4518≈400.22, as before.

So that's the same as earlier, about $400.22.

But the options don't have $400.22. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the PMT calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate PMT more accurately, perhaps I rounded it too much earlier.

Let me compute PMT precisely.

PMT = 1000 * [0.04*(1.04)^15]/[ (1.04)^15 -1 ]

We have (1.04)^15≈1.8009433.

So numerator=0.04*1.8009433=0.07203773.

Denominator=1.8009433 -1=0.8009433.

So PMT=1000 * (0.07203773/0.8009433)=1000 * 0.089929 ≈89.929, say $89.93 per year.

So more accurately, PMT is about $89.93.

Now, let's recalculate the balance after 10 payments using the balance formula.

Balance = 1000*(1.04)^10 - 89.93 * [ ( (1.04)^10 -1 ) /0.04 ]

Compute each part:

1000*(1.04)^10=1000*1.480244≈1480.244.

Now, compute [ (1.04)^10 -1 ] /0.04 = (1.480244 -1)/0.04=0.480244/0.04=12.0061.

So 89.93 *12.0061=?

Compute 89.93 *12=1079.16.

89.93 *0.0061≈0.5492.

So total≈1079.16 +0.5492≈1079.71.

So balance≈1480.244 -1079.71≈400.534.

So about $400.53.

Hmm, but the options don't have $400.53. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute the outstanding balance using another method, like calculating each payment's allocation to principal and interest, and see the remaining balance after 10 payments.

But that would take a lot of time, but maybe it's more accurate.

Let me try that approach.

Each payment is $89.93.

For each year, the interest is calculated on the outstanding balance, and the remainder goes to principal.

Let me make a table for each year:

Year | Payment | Interest | Principal | Balance
-----|---------|---------|----------|---------
0    |         |         |          | 1000.00
1    | 89.93   | 40.00   | 49.93    | 950.07
2    | 89.93   | 38.00   | 51.93    | 898.14
3    | 89.93   | 35.92   | 54.01    | 844.13
4    | 89.93   | 33.77   | 56.16    | 787.97
5    | 89.93   | 31.59   | 58.34    | 729.63
6    | 89.93   | 29.38   | 60.55    | 669.08
7    | 89.93   | 26.96   | 62.97    | 606.11
8    | 89.93   | 24.44   | 65.49    | 540.62
9    | 89.93   | 21.65   | 68.28    | 472.34
10   | 89.93   | 18.69   | 71.24    | 401.10

Wait, so after 10 payments, the balance is approximately $401.10.

That's very close to our previous calculation of about $400.53. But again, none of the options match that number. The options given are A:600.30, B:329.50, C:500.20, D:810.90, E:270.50, F:729.50, G:655.80, H:389.10, I:899.40, J:458.70.

Hmm, the closest to $400 is option J: $458.70, but that's $58 higher. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the PMT. Let me recompute PMT more accurately.

Compute (1.04)^15 = 1.8009433.

PMT = 1000 * (0.04 * 1.8009433) / (1.8009433 -1) = 1000 * (0.0720377) / 0.8009433.

Compute 0.0720377 /
