Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about predicting the formulas of compounds based on valence. Hmm, valence refers to the combining capacity of elements, right? I remember that valence is related to the number of electrons an atom can lose, gain, or share to form a chemical bond.

The question has three parts: (a) Sn and F, (b) P and H, and (c) Si and O. I need to figure out the formulas for each pair.

Starting with part (a): Tin (Sn) and Fluorine (F). I think Tin is a metal, and Fluorine is a non-metal. Metals usually form positive ions, and non-metals form negative ions. So, what's the typical valence of Tin? I recall that Tin can have two common valences: +2 and +4. But wait, Fluorine usually has a valence of -1. So, it's about finding a balance between the two.

If Sn is +4, then each F is -1. To balance the charges, Sn would need four F atoms. So the formula would be SnF4. Alternatively, if Sn is +2, then you'd need two F atoms, making SnF2. But which one is more common? I remember that in group 14, the +4 oxidation state is more common for elements like Sn when bonding with highly electronegative elements like F. So SnF4 makes sense here.

Moving on to part (b): Phosphorus (P) and Hydrogen (H). Phosphorus is a non-metal, and Hydrogen can act as a +1 or -1 in compounds. When hydrogen combines with non-metals, it usually has a +1 charge. So, what's the typical valence of phosphorus here? I think Phosphorus can have different valences, but in compounds like PH3, it's usually +3. So each P atom would bond with three H atoms. So the formula is PH3.

Wait, could it be something else? Like PH4? I don't think so because PH3 is the common hydride of phosphorus, like ammonia. So PH3 seems right.

Now part (c): Silicon (Si) and Oxygen (O). Silicon is in group 14, and Oxygen is in group 16. Typically, group 14 elements form +4 ions, and Oxygen is -2. So to balance, each Si needs four O atoms. Wait, but how does that work formula-wise? Let's see: each Si is +4, each O is -2. So the formula would balance when there are two Si and five O? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each Si gives +4, each O takes -2. So for every Si, you need four O to balance the charges. Because 4*(+4) and 4*(-2) would give a total charge of zero, but that's per Si. Wait, no, perhaps better to find the ratio.

Wait, the formula would be SiO2. Because one Si (+4) needs two O (-2 each) to balance. So SiO2 is correct. Oh wait, but another thought: sometimes Silica is SiO2, which is correct. But wait, looking at the options, let me check the choices.

Wait, let's go through the options. The possible options are A through J. Each option gives three formulas. Let me look at the options for each part.

Option A: SnF4, PH3, Si2O5. Hmm, Si2O5? That doesn't sound right. I thought SiO2.

Option B: SnF5, PH3, SiO3. SnF5? I don't think Sn has a +5 valence. And SiO3 would be if Si is +4 and O is -2. SiO3 would imply (Si) +4*(3*-2) = Si + (-6) → Si is +6? No, that doesn't fit. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: SnF, PH4, SiO. SnF would mean Sn is +1, which is unusual. PH4 is not a common formula, I think. SiO would mean Si is +2, but Si typically shows +4. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: SnF2, PH2, SiO. SnF2 would be Sn²+ and F⁻. But I thought SnF4 is more common. PH2 isn't a standard formula, as PH3 is. So D might not be correct.

Option E: SnF6, PH3, SiO2. SnF6 would require Sn to have +6 charge, but Sn's usual charges are +2 and +4, not +6. So E seems incorrect.

Option F: SnF3, PH4, SiO3. SnF3 would mean Sn is +3, which I don't think is typical. PH4 is not a common formula. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: SnF, PH5, SiO4. SnF is +1 and F⁻. PH5 isn't a standard formula. SiO4 would imply Si is +4, but the formula would be SiO2, not SiO4. Wait, SiO4 is more like in silicates, but the formula would be SiO2 for the oxide. So G seems wrong.

Option H: SnF4, PH3, SiO2. This matches what I thought for each part. SnF4 (a), PH3 (b), SiO2 (c). So H looks correct.

Option I: SnF2, PH5, SiO3. SnF2 might be possible, but I think SnF4 is more common with F. PH5 isn't a standard. So I is probably not right.

Option J: SnF2, PH6, SiO4. SnF2 would be +2 for Sn. PH6 isn't a known formula, I think. SiO4 isn't the usual oxide formula, which is SiO2. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option H.

To predict the formulas of the compounds formed between the given pairs of elements, we analyze the valence (combining capacity) of each element:

1. **(a) Sn and F**: Tin (Sn) is a metal that commonly exhibits a +4 oxidation state when bonding with highly electronegative elements like fluorine (F), which has a valence of -1. To balance the charges, one Sn atom combines with four F atoms, resulting in the formula **SnF₄**.

2. **(b) P and H**: Phosphorus (P) is a non-metal with a typical valence of +3 in compounds like PH₃. Hydrogen (H) usually has a valence of +1. Therefore, one P atom bonds with three H atoms, forming **PH₃**.

3. **(c) Si and O**: Silicon (Si) is a group 14 element with a typical valence of +4, and oxygen (O) has a valence of -2. To balance the charges, one Si atom combines with two O atoms, resulting in the formula **SiO₂**.

Now, evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: SnF₄, PH₃, Si₂O₅ — Incorrect, as Si₂O₅ is not a standard formula for silicon oxide.
- **Option B**: SnF₅, PH₃, SiO₃ — Incorrect, as SnF₅ is not a common tin fluoride, and SiO₃ is not the standard silicon oxide formula.
- **Option C**: SnF, PH₄, SiO — Incorrect, as SnF implies an unusual +1 valence for tin, PH₄ is not a standard formula, and SiO implies a +2 valence for silicon, which is less common.
- **Option D**: SnF₂, PH₂, SiO — Incorrect, as SnF₂ is less common than SnF₄, PH₂ is not a standard formula, and SiO implies a +2 valence for silicon.
- **Option E**: SnF₆, PH₃, SiO₂ — Incorrect, as SnF₆ implies an unusual +6 valence for tin.
- **Option F**: SnF₃, PH₄, SiO₃ — Incorrect, as SnF₃ implies an unusual +3 valence for tin, and PH₄ is not a standard formula.
- **Option G**: SnF, PH₅, SiO₄ — Incorrect, as SnF implies an unusual +1 valence for tin, PH₅ is not a standard formula, and SiO₄ is not the standard silicon oxide formula.
- **Option H**: SnF₄, PH₃, SiO₂ — Correct, as it matches the expected formulas based on valence.
- **Option I**: SnF₂, PH₅, SiO₃ — Incorrect, as SnF₂ is less common than SnF₄, and PH₅ is not a standard formula.
- **Option J**: SnF₂, PH₆, SiO₄ — Incorrect, as SnF₂ is less common than SnF₄, PH₆ is not a standard formula, and SiO₄ is not the standard silicon oxide formula.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option H: SnF₄, PH₃, SiO₂**.
