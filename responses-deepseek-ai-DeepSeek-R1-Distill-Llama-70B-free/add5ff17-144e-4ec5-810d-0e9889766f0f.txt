Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the extinction of Australian and American megafauna. The question is asking what probably caused their wiping out. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that megafauna refers to large animals, like giant wombats, kangaroos, and in America, things like mammoths and mastodons. These animals went extinct at the end of the last Ice Age, I think. So the timing is around 10,000 to 40,000 years ago, depending on the region.

I've heard two main theories about their extinction: one is climate change, and the other is human activity. Let's think about each.

For Australia, I believe the megafauna went extinct a bit earlier, maybe around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Some scientists think that when humans first arrived in Australia, they hunted these large animals, leading to their extinction. But others argue that it was due to changes in the climate, like getting drier as the Ice Age ended.

In the Americas, the extinction happened more recently, like around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. This was around the time when humans were migrating across the land bridge from Asia to the Americas. So again, the debate is between overhunting by humans versus climate change.

But wait, there's also the idea that it might be a combination of both factors. Like, maybe climate change weakened the populations, making them more vulnerable to human hunting. Or humans might have been the main cause, but environmental changes played a role too.

Looking at the options, option B says both humans and environmental changes. Option F is just humans, and option I is just environmental changes. So the question is whether it's one or the other, or both.

I think the current consensus is that it's not just one factor. For example, in Australia, some studies suggest that human arrival and hunting were the main drivers. In the Americas, the same applies. But there's also evidence that climate change was happening around the same time, so it's possible that both factors contributed.

So the correct answer would likely be B, both humans and environmental changes. But wait, let me think again. Did the question specify both regions? It says Australian and American megafauna, so both cases.

In Australia, the extinction coincided with human arrival, and in the Americas, it was around the time of human migration. But some argue that in the Americas, the climate was changing, and that might have stressed the megafauna, making them easier targets for humans.

So putting it all together, the probable cause is both humans and environmental changes. So the answer would be option B.

The extinction of Australian and American megafauna, such as giant wombats and mammoths, occurred around the end of the last Ice Age, with timings varying by region. Two main theories have been proposed: climate change and human activity. In Australia, megafauna extinction (~40,000-50,000 years ago) is linked to human arrival and hunting, while others suggest environmental changes like aridification. In the Americas (~10,000-12,000 years ago), the extinction coincided with human migration via the land bridge, though climate change may have also played a role by weakening populations. The consensus leans toward a combination of both factors, where human activity and environmental changes together contributed to the extinctions. Thus, the most probable cause is both humans and environmental changes.

Answer: B
