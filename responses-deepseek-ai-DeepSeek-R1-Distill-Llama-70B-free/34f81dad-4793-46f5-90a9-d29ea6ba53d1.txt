Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the 'new man' of the 1980s. I'm not entirely sure about the answer, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to understand what the 'new man' refers to. From what I remember, the 1980s had a lot of cultural shifts, especially regarding gender roles. The term 'new man' probably relates to changing perceptions of masculinity during that time.

Let me think about each option:

A: Environmentalist concerned about climate change. I don't think that's specifically tied to the 'new man' of the 80s. Environmentalism was around, but maybe not the defining trait.

B: Laddish, aggressive, violent. That sounds more like a traditional or perhaps a 'lad culture' stereotype, which might have been a reaction against the new man idea. So maybe not the new man himself.

C: Globetrotter for work and pleasure. That seems more like a jet-setting executive or someone with a lot of money, not necessarily the new man archetype.

D: Openly bisexual and proud. I'm not sure if that's the main characteristic. The new man was more about redefining traditional male roles, but I don't recall sexuality being the primary focus here.

E: Politically active. Maybe, but I think the new man was more about personal characteristics than political activism.

F: Sensitive, caring, emotional. This rings a bell. The 'new man' was often portrayed as more in touch with his emotions, breaking away from the stoic, unfeeling male stereotype.

G: Strong and dependable breadwinner. That's more the traditional male role, not the new one. The new man was supposed to be different from that.

H: Workaholic. That sounds like someone focused on career, which might have been a critique of 80s culture but not the new man ideal. The new man was supposed to be more balanced, perhaps.

I: Tech-savvy early adopter. That's more of a 90s or 2000s thing, I think. The 80s had the rise of personal computers, but I'm not sure it's tied to the new man specifically.

J: Focused on physical fitness. That could be, as the 80s saw a fitness craze with people like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I'm not sure if that's the defining trait of the new man. Maybe, but I'm leaning more towards F.

I remember reading that the 'new man' was about challenging traditional gender roles, being more nurturing and emotionally expressive. So option F seems to fit best.
