Question:

A truck and a car collided at an intersection. Both drivers were injured, and each one filed a lawsuit against the other for negligence. At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: "Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. "Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?

Options:

A: The truck driver recovers $4,000, and the car driver recovers $2,000.
B: The truck driver recovers $2,000, and the car driver recovers $6,000.
C: The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.
D: The truck driver recovers nothing, and the car driver recovers $4,000.
E: The car driver recovers $5,000, and the truck driver recovers $5,000.
F: The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.
G: The truck driver recovers $6,000, and the car driver recovers $2,000.
H: Neither party recovers anything from the other.
I: The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.
J: The truck driver recovers $8,000, and the car driver recovers $10,000.

Okay, so I've got this question about a truck and car collision. Both drivers were injured and sued each other for negligence. The jury found each of them liable, and they assigned 50% fault to each. The truck driver's injuries were $10,000, and the car driver's were $8,000. The jurisdiction has a contributory negligence statute that says contributory negligence doesn't bar recovery if the plaintiff's negligence isn't greater than the defendant's. But the damages are diminished proportionally to the plaintiff's own negligence.

Hmm, I remember that contributory negligence used to be a complete bar to recovery, but many places have moved away from that. This statute seems to be a modified version. So, it's not the old "50%" rule where if you're even a little bit at fault, you get nothing. Instead, here, if the plaintiff's negligence is not greater than the defendant's, they can recover, but their damages are reduced by their own percentage of fault.

Wait, but in this case, both were 50% at fault. So for each plaintiff, their own negligence is equal to the defendant's. So under the statute, their recovery isn't barred because their negligence isn't greater, but their damages are reduced proportionally.

So for the truck driver: his injuries are $10k, but he's 50% at fault. So his recovery would be 10k minus 50% of that, which is 5k. Similarly, the car driver's injuries are $8k, and she's 50% at fault. So her recovery is 8k minus 50% of that, which is 4k.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The way the statute is worded: any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the plaintiff. So each party's recovery is their total damages minus their own percentage of fault.

So truck driver's claim: 10,000 total. His own negligence is 50%, so he can recover 50% of 10k, which is 5k from the car driver. Similarly, the car driver's total is 8k, and she's 50% at fault, so she can recover 50% of 8k, which is 4k from the truck driver.

So the truck driver gets 5k from the car driver, and the car driver gets 4k from the truck driver.

Looking at the options, option E says each recovers 5k, but that can't be right because their damages are different. Option F says truck gets 5k and car gets 4k. So that's option F.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says each is suing the other. So the truck driver sues the car driver, and the car driver sues the truck driver. So each case is separate in a way.

In the truck driver's case against the car driver: the truck driver's damages are 10k, but he's 50% at fault. So he can recover 5k from the car driver. Similarly, the car driver's case against the truck driver: her damages are 8k, she's 50% at fault, so she recovers 4k.

So the total would be truck gets 5k from car, car gets 4k from truck. So the options are looking for each party's recovery. Looking at the options, option F is truck driver recovers $5,000, car driver recovers $4,000.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option F is truck driver recovers $5k, car recovers $4k. That fits.

So the answer should be F.

To determine the appropriate judgment in this case, we analyze the situation under the jurisdiction's contributory negligence statute. The statute allows recovery if the plaintiff's negligence is not greater than the defendant's, but damages are diminished proportionally to the plaintiff's own negligence.

- **Truck Driver's Claim**: The truck driver's injuries amount to $10,000, but they are 50% at fault. Under the statute, their recovery is reduced by their proportion of negligence. Thus, the truck driver recovers $10,000 × (1 - 0.50) = $5,000 from the car driver.

- **Car Driver's Claim**: The car driver's injuries amount to $8,000, and they are also 50% at fault. Applying the same principle, the car driver recovers $8,000 × (1 - 0.50) = $4,000 from the truck driver.

Reviewing the answer choices, the only option that matches these calculations is **Option F**, where the truck driver recovers $5,000 and the car driver recovers $4,000.

**Answer: F**
