Okay, so I need to find the domain of the function f(x) = (x + 6)/sqrt(x² - 3x -4). Hmm, the domain of a function includes all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since this function has a denominator and a square root, I should check the conditions for both.

First, the denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. Wait, actually, wait—the denominator here is a square root. Oh wait, no, the denominator is the square root expression, but wait, no—wait, the function is (x+6) divided by sqrt(x² - 3x -4). So the denominator is sqrt(...), which can't be zero because that would make the denominator zero, which is undefined. Also, the expression inside the square root must be positive because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers.

So, to find where the function is defined, I need to make sure that the expression inside the square root is greater than zero. Because if it's zero, the denominator becomes zero, which is not allowed. So:

x² - 3x -4 > 0.

I should solve this inequality. Let me factor the quadratic. Hmm, x² -3x -4. Let's see, factors of -4 that add up to -3. Oh, that's (x - 4)(x + 1), because 4*(-1) = -4 and -4 +1 = -3. Wait, no: (x-4)(x+1) = x² -3x -4. Yes, right.

So the inequality becomes (x -4)(x +1) > 0.

Now, to solve this inequality, I'll find the critical points where the expression equals zero. So x = 4 and x = -1. These points divide the real number line into three intervals:

1. x < -1,
2. between -1 and 4,
3. x > 4.

I'll test each interval to see where the product is positive.

First interval: x < -1. Let's pick x = -2. Plug into (x-4)(x+1): (-2 -4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6, which is positive. So this interval is part of the solution.

Second interval: between -1 and 4. Let's pick x=0. (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4, which is negative. So this interval is not part of the solution.

Third interval: x >4. Let's pick x=5. (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) =6, positive. So this interval is part of the solution.

So the solution to the inequality is x < -1 or x >4. Therefore, the expression inside the square root is positive when x is in (-infinity, -1) U (4, infinity).

Wait, but also, the denominator is the square root, so the square root can't be zero. So when x² -3x -4 is zero, which is at x=4 and x=-1, the denominator becomes zero, so those points are excluded as well. But in our inequality, we already required the expression to be greater than zero, so x can't be 4 or -1 anyway.

So the domain of the function is all real numbers except x between -1 and 4, including the points -1 and 4? No, wait, no: because in the solution, the expression is greater than zero, so x can't be in [-1,4], but I think it's (-inf, -1) U (4, inf).

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option A: (-inf, -4) U (4, inf) → No, the critical points are -1 and 4, not -4 and 4.

Option H: (-inf, -1) U (4, inf) → Yes, that's what I found.

But let me double-check. So the function is f(x) = (x+6)/sqrt(x²-3x-4). The denominator sqrt(...) is defined when x²-3x-4 >0, which is x < -1 or x>4. So the domain is (-infinity, -1) union (4, infinity), which is option H.

Wait, but I should also ensure that the numerator doesn't cause any issues. The numerator is x+6, which is defined for all real numbers. So the only restrictions come from the denominator (the square root and it not being zero). So I think the domain is indeed (-inf, -1) U (4, inf), which is option H.

To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}} \), we need to ensure the function is defined. This requires two conditions:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be positive because the square root of a negative number is undefined in real numbers.
2. The denominator, \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \), cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined.

First, solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \). Factoring the quadratic gives \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \). The critical points are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \), which divide the real number line into three intervals:

- For \( x < -1 \), the product \( (x - 4)(x + 1) \) is positive.
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \), the product \( (x - 4)(x + 1) \) is negative.
- For \( x > 4 \), the product \( (x - 4)(x + 1) \) is positive.

Thus, the solution to \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Additionally, at \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \), the expression inside the square root equals zero, making the denominator zero, so these points are excluded.

The numerator \( x + 6 \) is defined for all real numbers, so it does not impose any restrictions.

Therefore, the domain of the function is \( (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \), which corresponds to option **H**.
