Okay, so I have this problem about helium gas, and I'm supposed to find the mass required. Hmm, let's see what I remember from chemistry class. I think I need to use the ideal gas law here. The formula is PV = nRT, right? Oh wait, yeah, P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

So the given values are: volume V is 50 liters. Oh, but wait, I remember that the gas constant R is sometimes used with liters, atmospheres, and Kelvin. So the units here are important. Pressure P is 100 standard atmospheres. Oh wait, standard atmosphere is 1 atm, so this is 100 atm. Temperature is 15 degrees Celsius. I need to convert that to Kelvin. Oh right, Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15. So 15 + 273.15 is 288.15 K, approximately 288 K.

I need to find the mass of helium. So first, I think I should find the number of moles (n) using the ideal gas law, then use the molar mass of helium to get the mass.

The gas constant R is... I think it's 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Yeah, that's the value I remember for when pressure is in atm, volume in liters, and temp in Kelvin.

So plugging into PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT). Wait, actually, solving for n: n = (P V) / (R T).

Let me plug in the numbers. P is 100 atm, V is 50 L, R is 0.0821, T is 288 K.

So n = (100 atm * 50 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 288 K).

Calculating the denominator first: 0.0821 * 288. Let's approximate that. 0.08 * 288 is 23.04, and 0.0021 * 288 is about 0.6048. So total is about 23.04 + 0.6048 = 23.6448. So denominator is approximately 23.6448.

The numerator is 100 *50 = 5000. So n = 5000 / 23.6448. Let me calculate that. 23.6448 times 211 is roughly 5000, because 23.6 * 200 is 4720, and 23.6 * 11 is 259.6, so 4720+259.6=4979.6. Close to 5000. So n is approximately 211.5 mol. Wait, maybe I should do a more accurate division. Or perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, 23.6448 * 211 = let's compute 23.6448 * 200 = 4728.96, 23.6448 * 11 = 260.92. So total is 4728.96 + 260.92 = 4989.88. Oh, close to 5000. The difference is 10.12. So 211 would give us 4989.88, so 5000 is 211 + (10.12 /23.6448). 10.12 /23.6448 is approximately 0.428, so n is about 211.428 moles. Let's just approximate it as 211.43 mol.

Wait, alternatively, using a calculator approach: 5000 divided by 23.6448. Let me see. 23.6448 is approximately 23.6. So 5000 /23.6 is approximately 212, since 23.6 * 212 = 23.6*(200 + 12) = 4720 + 282.72 = 499, 4720+282.72=499, 4720+282.72=5002.72, which is just over 5000. So 212 mol would give a product of 5002.72, so 212 is a bit over. So n is slightly less than 212. Let's just take it as approximately 211.5 mol for simplicity.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute 23.6448 * 211.5. Hmm, 211.5 is 211 + 0.5. 23.6448 * 211 = 4989.88 as before. 23.6448 *0.5 is 11.8224. So total is 4989.88 + 11.8224 = 5001.7 approx. Hmm, wait, that's more than 5000. So maybe 211.5 gives a product of 5001.7, which is a bit over 5000. So to get exactly 5000, maybe it's 211.5 minus a little. Let's say n is approximately 211.43 mol.

But perhaps for the sake of estimation, I can just proceed with 211.43 moles.

Now, helium has a molar mass of about 4 grams per mole. So mass m = n * M. So 211.43 mol * 4 g/mol = 845.72 grams. That's about 845.7 grams, which is 845.7 gm.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option I is 840 gm. Option D is 1040 gm. Option A is 540, which is way lower. So 845 is closest to option I: 840 gm. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in arithmetic.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute n more accurately.

n = (100 atm * 50 L) / (0.0821 * 288.15 K)

Compute denominator: 0.0821 * 288.15.

Let me compute 0.08 *288.15 = 23.052.

0.0021 *288.15 = 0.605215.

So total denominator is 23.052 + 0.605215 = 23.657215.

So n = 5000 / 23.657215.

Let me compute 23.657215 * x = 5000.

Let me perform this division step by step.

23.657215 * 200 = 4731.443.

So subtract 4731.443 from 5000: 5000 - 4731.443 = 268.557.

Now, 23.657215 * 11 = 260.229355.

But 268.557 is more than that. So 200 +11 =211 gives 4731.443 + 260.229 = 4991.672. But we have 268.557 left, so 268.557 - (23.657215 * x) = ?

So 23.657215 * 11 is 260.229. So 268.557 -260.229=8.328.

So 23.657215 * 0.35 is approximately 8.29 (since 23.657 *0.3=7.097, 0.05 is 1.182, total 8.279). So 0.35 gives about 8.279.

So the total x is 200 +11 +0.35=211.35.

So n≈211.35 moles.

So mass is 211.35 *4= 845.4 grams, which is 845 grams. So the closest option is I:840 gm. But wait, let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:540 gm

B:940 gm

C:640 gm

D:1040 gm

E:440 gm

F:6400 mg (which is 6.4 grams, so not relevant)

G:1140 gm

H:9400 mg (9.4 grams)

I:840 gm

J:740 gm.

So 845 is closest to option I:840. But wait, let me see if perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Maybe I should use more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects an approximate calculation. Let me think about possible approximations. 

Wait, another approach: sometimes, people use R as 0.08206, but that's similar to what I did. Alternatively, perhaps using T as 288 K.

Alternatively, perhaps the ideal gas law isn't perfectly accurate at 100 atm, but the question says to assume it is.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of n. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 5000 / 23.657215:

23.657215 * 211 = ?

23.657215 * 200 = 4731.443.

23.657215 *11= 260.229.

Total 4731.443 +260.229=4991.672.

So 211 gives 4991.672, which is less than 5000. The difference is 8.328.

So 8.328 /23.657215 ≈ 0.352.

So total n is 211.352, so approximately 211.35 mol.

Mass is 4 *211.35= 845.4 grams.

So 845.4 grams. The options don't have 845, but option I is 840, which is the closest. So the answer should be I:840 gm.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check: 100 atm, 50 L, R=0.0821, T=288 K.

n = (100 *50) / (0.0821 *288) = 5000 / (23.6448) ≈ 211.43.

Yes, so 211.43 *4=845.7 grams. So 845.7 grams. So the closest option is I:840, but wait, let me check if any other options are closer.

The options are:

I:840, which is 5.7 grams less.

J is 740, which is 105.7 less.

Other options are even further away.

So the correct answer is I:840 gm.

To solve the problem, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

where:
- \(P = 100 \, \text{atm}\) (pressure),
- \(V = 50 \, \text{L}\) (volume),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\) (gas constant),
- \(T = 15^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 288.15 \, \text{K}\) (temperature in Kelvin),
- \(n\) is the number of moles of helium.

Rearranging for \(n\):

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{(100 \, \text{atm})(50 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(288.15 \, \text{K})}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.0821 \times 288.15 \approx 23.657
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:

\[
100 \times 50 = 5000
\]

Thus:

\[
n = \frac{5000}{23.657} \approx 211.43 \, \text{mol}
\]

Next, calculate the mass of helium using its molar mass (\(M = 4 \, \text{g/mol}\)):

\[
\text{Mass} = n \times M = 211.43 \, \text{mol} \times 4 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 845.7 \, \text{g}
\]

Finally, compare this result to the given options. The closest value is **840 gm**, which corresponds to option **I**.
