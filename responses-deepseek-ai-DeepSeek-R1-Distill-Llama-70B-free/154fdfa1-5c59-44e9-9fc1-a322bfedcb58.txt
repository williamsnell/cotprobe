Alright, I'm trying to tackle this probability question. Let me read it again carefully. So, we have these random variables X₂, X₃, and so on. They're independent. The probabilities are given as P(Xₙ = n) = P(Xₙ = -n) = 1/(2n log n), and P(Xₙ = 0) = 1 - 1/(n log n). 

The question is about whether the average of these variables from i=2 to n, when divided by n, converges in probability and almost surely. So, we're looking at two types of convergence: convergence in probability (CIP) and almost sure convergence (AS).

Let me break this down. First, I need to understand the behavior of each X_i. Each X_i can take three values: -i, 0, or i. The probabilities aren't symmetric in a simple way because the variances might be different. Let me compute the expectation and variance for each X_i.

The expectation E[X_i] would be: i * P(X_i = i) + (-i) * P(X_i = -i) + 0 * P(X_i=0). So that's i*(1/(2i log i)) + (-i)*(1/(2i log i)) +0. Simplifying, that's (1/(2 log i) ) - (1/(2 log i)) = 0. So the mean is zero for each X_i. That's a good start.

Next, the variance Var(X_i) is E[X_i²] - (E[X_i})². Since E[X_i] is zero, Var(X_i) is just E[X_i²]. E[X_i²] is (i² * P(X_i = i)) + (i² * P(X_i = -i)) + 0. So that's i²*(1/(2i log i)) + i²*(1/(2i log i)) = i²*(1/(i log i)) = i / log i. So Var(X_i) = i / log i.

Now, the sum in question is S_n = (1/n) Σ_{i=2}^n X_i. We are to determine if S_n converges in probability and almost surely.

For convergence in probability, one approach is to use Chebyshev's inequality. Alternatively, since the variables are independent, perhaps the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies. But wait, the CLT usually deals with sums, not averages. Also, the variables here are independent but not identically distributed, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the variance of S_n and see if it converges to zero, which would imply convergence in probability to the mean (which is zero here).

Let's compute Var(S_n). Since the X_i's are independent, Var(S_n) = (1/n²) Σ Var(X_i) from i=2 to n. So that's (1/n²) Σ (i / log i) from i=2 to n.

So I need to evaluate the sum Σ (i / log i) from i=2 to n. Hmm. Let's think about how this sum behaves as n grows. 

The function i/log i grows roughly like O(i / log i). So summing from 2 to n would be roughly the integral of x / log x dx from 2 to n. Let me compute that integral approximately.

The integral of x / log x dx is x log log x - x / log x + ...? Wait, wait, let me think. Wait, let me make a substitution. Let u = log x, so du = 1/x dx. Hmm, perhaps integration by parts would be better.

Let u = 1/log x, dv = x dx. Then du = (-1/(x (log x)^2)) dx, and v = x²/2. So integration by parts gives:

∫ x / log x dx = (x²/2) * (1/log x) - ∫ (x²/2) * (-1/(x (log x)^2)) dx

Simplify this:

= (x²)/(2 log x) + (1/2) ∫ x / (log x)^2 dx

Hmm, but this seems to get more complicated. Maybe another approach: compare the sum to an integral.

The sum Σ i / log i from i=2 to n is similar to the integral from 2 to n of x / log x dx. The integral of x / log x dx from 2 to n is approximately (n² (log log n))/2 - (4 (log log 2))/2, but I'm not sure about the exact coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps x / log x grows faster than x, but not by much. Wait, no, x / log x grows slower than x, because log x increases. Wait, for large x, x / log x is much larger than 1, but smaller than x. So the integral from 2 to n of x / log x dx is roughly O(n² / log n). Because, for large x, x / log x ≈ x / (log n), assuming that x is around n. So integrating x / log x from 2 to n, the area is approximately the same as the maximum value times n. Wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, the function x / log x increases as x increases, so the sum from i=2 to n of i/log i is less than ∫ from 1 to n of x/log x dx. But maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, let me look for known approximations or comparisons.

I recall that the sum of 1/log i from i=2 to n is approximately n / log n. Because each term is roughly 1/log i, and summing from 2 to n gives something like ∫1/log x dx from 2 to n, which is roughly (n / log n) - (2 / log 2). But wait, that's for 1/log i. Here, we have i / log i, which is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can bound the sum. Let me note that for i >= 2, log i >= 1 (since log 2 is about 0.693, but that's less than 1. Hmm, wait, log base e of 2 is about 0.693, but perhaps the question uses natural log. So log 2 is about 0.693, log 3 is about 1.098, etc. So for i >= 3, log i >=1. So for i >=3, 1/log i <=1. So i / log i <= i.

But that's a rough upper bound. Alternatively, for i >= some number, say i >= e, log i >=1, so i/log i <= i.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the behavior of Σ (i / log i) from i=2 to n. Let me think of it as Σ_{i=2}^n (i / log i) ≈ ∫_{2}^{n} (x / log x) dx.

Let me approximate this integral. Let me make substitution u = log x, then du = 1/x dx. Hmm, but substitution might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I can use integration by parts again.

Let me try integrating x / log x dx again. Let me set u = 1/log x, dv = x dx. Then du = (-1)/(x (log x)^2) dx, and v = x²/2.

So, ∫ x / log x dx = (x²/2)(1/log x) + (1/2) ∫ x / (log x)^2 dx.

Hmm, this seems recursive, but maybe I can proceed. Let's call I = ∫ x / log x dx.

Then, I = (x²)/(2 log x) + (1/2) ∫ x / (log x)^2 dx.

Now, let me compute ∫ x / (log x)^2 dx again using integration by parts. Let u = 1/(log x)^2, dv = x dx. Then du = (-2)/(x (log x)^3) dx, and v = x²/2.

So, ∫ x / (log x)^2 dx = (x²/2)(1/(log x)^2) + ∫ (x²/2) * (2)/(x (log x)^3) dx.

Simplify this:

= (x²)/(2 (log x)^2) + ∫ x / (log x)^3 dx.

So putting it back into the expression for I:

I = (x²)/(2 log x) + (1/2)[ (x²)/(2 (log x)^2) + ∫ x / (log x)^3 dx ) ]

So, I = (x²)/(2 log x) + x²/(4 (log x)^2) + (1/2) ∫ x / (log x)^3 dx.

This is getting more complicated, but perhaps the leading term is (x²)/(2 log x). So, ignoring the lower order terms, I can approximate the integral as roughly (x²)/(2 log x).

So, the integral from 2 to n of x / log x dx is approximately [n²/(2 log n)] - [4/(2 log 2)] = (n²)/(2 log n) - 2/(log 2).

Therefore, the sum Σ_{i=2}^n i/log i is approximately (n²)/(2 log n). So, the sum behaves like O(n² / log n).

Now, back to Var(S_n) = (1/n²) Σ Var(X_i) = (1/n²) Σ (i / log i) ≈ (1/n²) * (n² / log n) ) = 1 / log n.

So as n approaches infinity, Var(S_n) ≈ 1 / log n → 0. So the variance of S_n tends to zero. 

Now, Chebyshev's inequality tells us that for any ε > 0,

P(|S_n - E[S_n]| >= ε) <= Var(S_n) / ε².

Since E[S_n] is 0 (as each E[X_i] is zero), this becomes P(|S_n| >= ε) <= Var(S_n)/ε².

As n→infty, Var(S_n)→0, so the right-hand side tends to 0. Therefore, S_n converges to 0 in probability. So the first answer is that convergence in probability holds.

Now, the second part: does S_n converge almost surely? For almost sure convergence, a common approach is to use the Borel-Cantelli lemma or to show that the sum of variances converges, implying that the series converges almost surely.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with the average of random variables, perhaps we can examine the convergence of the series Σ (X_i / i). Wait, but S_n is (1/n) Σ X_i, so perhaps we can use some other method.

Wait, let me think again. To check almost sure convergence, perhaps we can use Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers. But that applies to independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) variables with finite mean and variance. Here, the variables are independent but not identically distributed. So Kolmogorov's SLLN doesn't apply directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look into the convergence of the series Σ (X_i / i). Wait, but S_n is the average up to n, so it's (1/n) Σ X_i.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the convergence of the series Σ (X_i / i^2). If this series converges almost surely, then by Kronecker's lemma, (1/n) Σ X_i would converge. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, let's compute E[|X_i|]. We have E[|X_i|] = i * P(X_i = i) + i * P(X_i = -i) = i*(1/(2i log i)) + i*(1/(2i log i)) ) = 1/(log i). So E[|X_i|] = 1/(log i).

Then, the sum Σ E[|X_i|] from i=2 to n is Σ 1/(log i), which is approximately n / log n, as I thought earlier. So the sum diverges as n→infty because log n grows slower than n. Therefore, the series Σ |X_i| diverges, so by the divergence of the series of expectations, the series Σ X_i diverges almost surely.

Wait, but we're not looking at Σ X_i, we're looking at (1/n) Σ X_i. So even if Σ X_i diverges, when divided by n, it could still converge. For example, if Σ X_i ~ n, then (1/n) Σ X_i → 1. But in our case, the expectation is zero, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the variance of S_n we calculated earlier, which tends to zero, implying convergence in probability to zero. But for almost sure convergence, we need a stronger condition.

Wait, another approach: let's compute E[(S_n)^2] = Var(S_n) →0 as n→infty. So S_n converges in L² to zero. But L² convergence implies convergence in probability, which we already have, but not necessarily almost sure convergence.

To check for almost sure convergence, perhaps we can look into the convergence of the series of the differences. Wait, but S_n is an average, not a series. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of convergence almost surely for averages.

Wait, another thought: if the variables X_i are such that their sum up to n, when divided by n, converges a.s., then by the SLLN, but since the variables are not identically distributed, we can't apply the SLLN directly. So perhaps we can check the conditions for the SLLN for non-identically distributed variables.

One of the conditions for the SLLN in independent variables is that the sum of variances up to n is finite, but in our case, the sum of variances is Σ Var(X_i) = Σ i / log i. From earlier, this sum up to n is approximately n² / log n, which grows without bound. So the sum of variances diverges, which suggests that the SLLN does not apply, and we cannot conclude almost sure convergence.

But wait, we have that S_n converges in probability to zero. But does it converge almost surely? For that, I think we need a stronger condition. Since Var(S_n) →0, and S_n is a martingale, perhaps we can use some martingale convergence theorem. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Borel-Cantelli lemma. Let me see: for almost sure convergence, we need that the probability that |S_n| > ε infinitely often is zero for any ε>0. 

To apply Borel-Cantelli, we can check if the sum of probabilities P(|S_n| > ε) is finite. If it's finite, then by Borel-Cantelli, only finitely many |S_n| > ε occur almost surely, so S_n →0 a.s.

But earlier, using Chebyshev, for any ε>0,

P(|S_n| ≥ ε) ≤ Var(S_n)/ε² ≈ (1 / log n)/ε² →0 as n→infty.

But Borel-Cantelli requires the sum over n of P(|S_n| ≥ ε) to be finite. So sum_{n=2}^∞ (1 / log n) converges? Because 1/log n decays slower than 1/n, which diverges. So sum 1/log n diverges, so Borel-Cantelli's condition is not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot conclude that S_n converges almost surely.

Wait, but we have that S_n converges in probability to zero. But to get almost sure convergence, we might need a stronger condition. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the variance of S_n. Since Var(S_n) →0, we know that S_n converges in L², but as I said earlier, that doesn't guarantee a.s. convergence.

Another approach: since the X_i are independent, perhaps the series Σ (X_i - E[X_i]) / i converges a.s. Then by a theorem, if that series converges, so does the average. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Wait, let me think about the variance of the partial sums. Let’s define T_n = Σ_{i=2}^n X_i. We’re looking at T_n /n.

If T_n is such that T_n /n converges a.s., then S_n would converge a.s. But to check that, perhaps we can look at the variance of T_n: Var(T_n) = Σ Var(X_i) ≈ n² / log n. So Var(T_n) grows without bound, which suggests that T_n does not converge, but when divided by n, perhaps it stabilizes.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the Lindeberg-Feller CLT for independent, non-identically distributed variables. But I'm not certain.

Wait, going back to the sum Σ (X_i / i). If this converges a.s., then by Kronecker's lemma, (1/n) Σ X_i would converge a.s. So perhaps I should check if Σ (X_i / i) converges a.s.

Compute E[(X_i / i)^2] = Var(X_i / i) since E[X_i/i] = 0.

Var(X_i /i) = Var(X_i) / i² = (i / log i) / i² = 1/(i log i).

So the sum of variances is Σ 1/(i log i) from i=2 to ∞. Does this converge?

We can approximate the sum using integrals. The integral from 2 to ∞ of 1/(x log x) dx. Let u = log x, du = 1/x dx, so the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from log 2 to ∞, which is [log u] from log 2 to ∞, which diverges to infinity. So the sum Σ 1/(i log i) diverges.

Therefore, by Kolmogorov's three-series theorem, for the series Σ X_i /i to converge a.s., the sum of variances must converge. Since it diverges, the series Σ X_i /i does not converge a.s., which implies that (1/n) Σ X_i does not converge a.s. via Kronecker's lemma.

Wait, but Kronecker's lemma says that if Σ a_i converges, then (1/n) Σ a_i →0. But in our case, if the sum doesn't converge, then (1
