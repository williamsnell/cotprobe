Okay, so I have this question about changes in attitudes towards premarital and extramarital sex over the past several decades. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to figure out how societal views on premarital sex have shifted. From what I remember, in the past, premarital sex was often frowned upon, especially in more conservative or religious communities. But over the decades, especially with the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s, attitudes started to become more permissive. People became more accepting of sex before marriage. So I think premarital attitudes have become more permissive. That makes sense because these days, a lot of people engage in premarital sex without the same stigma as before.

Now, what about extramarital sex? This is about cheating or having sex outside of marriage. I think society's view on this hasn't changed much. Infidelity has always been generally looked down upon, and that hasn't really shifted. So I don't think extramarital attitudes have become more permissive. Instead, they might have remained constant or perhaps even become less accepting. Wait, no, maybe they've stayed the same because people still largely disapprove of cheating.

Wait, but could there be any changes? I'm trying to think if there's been any trend towards more acceptance of extramarital sex. Maybe in some alternative communities or with more open relationships, but overall, I don't think the majority's attitude has shifted. So I think extramarital attitudes have remained constant or maybe become slightly less accepting, but not more permissive.

So putting it together, the first blank is 'become more permissive' and the second is 'remained constant'. Looking at the options, that would be option A. Let me double-check the options.

Option A says become more permissive; remained constant. That fits what I was thinking. Option I says both have become more permissive, which I don't think is right because extramarital hasn't become more accepted. Option H suggests extramarital has become more permissive, which doesn't align with my thoughts. So yeah, option A is the best choice.

The question asks about changes in societal attitudes toward premarital and extramarital sex over several decades. Attitudes toward premarital sex have become more permissive, reflecting a societal shift away from traditional norms, especially influenced by the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. In contrast, attitudes toward extramarital sex have largely remained constant, as infidelity continues to be widely disapproved of. 

The correct answer is A: become more permissive; remained constant.
