Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the minimum sampling rate for a given signal. Hmm, I remember something about the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem from my studies. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The signal x(t) is given as 10 cos(20π - π/4) minus 5 cos(50π t). Wait, wait, that first term looks a bit odd. Oh wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Oh right, I think it's 10 cos(20π - π/4) which is a constant, because the argument doesn't have a 't' in it. So that term is just a DC offset, a constant value. Then the second term is 5 cos(50π t). So x(t) is a combination of a DC component and a cosine function varying with time.

Wait, the DC component doesn't have any frequency except zero. So when considering the frequencies present in the signal, the DC part doesn't contribute to the highest frequency. So the highest frequency in the signal comes from the second term.

The general approach is to find the highest frequency present in the signal and then apply the Nyquist theorem, which states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present. Otherwise, aliasing occurs, which distorts the signal.

So looking at the second term: 5 cos(50π t). The cosine function's argument is 2π f t, where f is the frequency. So comparing 50π t to 2π f t, I can solve for f. Let's see:

50π t = 2π f t → f = 50π / (2π) → f = 25 Hz. Oh wait, because 50 divided by 2 is 25. So the frequency here is 25 Hz.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. So the highest frequency component in x(t) is 25 Hz. According to the Nyquist theorem, the sampling rate (fs) must be at least twice that. So fs ≥ 2 * 25 = 50 Hz. So the minimum sampling rate is 50 Hz.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 50, option F is 70, which is higher. So which one is correct? Because the minimum is 50, so the answer should be 50 Hz. So the correct option would be D.

Wait, but I also remember that sometimes in these problems, sometimes the terms might have factors that can affect the frequency. Let me double-check.

The first term is 10 cos(20π - π/4). Let's compute that. Well, 20π is 10*2π, so it's like full cycles, so cos(20π - π/4) is the same as cos(-π/4), because cos is periodic with 2π. And cos(-θ) is cosθ, so it's cos(π/4) which is sqrt(2)/2. So the first term is 10*(sqrt(2)/2) which is 5*sqrt(2), a constant.

So the time-varying part is only the second term, 5 cos(50π t). So the frequency is definitely 25 Hz as I calculated earlier. So the minimum sampling rate is 50 Hz, which is option D.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me see. Option B is 20, which is too low. Option C is 40, which is less than 50, so not enough. Option D is 50, which meets Nyquist. So yes, D is correct.

To determine the minimum sampling rate for the signal \( x(t) = 10 \cos(20\pi - \pi/4) - 5 \cos(50\pi t) \), we analyze its components:

1. **First Term**: \( 10 \cos(20\pi - \pi/4) \) is a constant (DC offset) because the argument does not depend on \( t \). This term does not contribute to the frequency content of the signal.

2. **Second Term**: \( 5 \cos(50\pi t) \) is a time-varying cosine function. The argument \( 50\pi t \) can be compared to the standard form \( 2\pi f t \), where \( f \) is the frequency. Solving for \( f \), we find:
   \[
   f = \frac{50\pi}{2\pi} = 25 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]
   Thus, the highest frequency present in \( x(t) \) is \( 25 \, \text{Hz} \).

3. **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem**: The minimum sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency in the signal to avoid aliasing. Therefore:
   \[
   f_s \geq 2 \times 25 = 50 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]

From the given options, the minimum sampling rate that satisfies this condition is \( 50 \, \text{Hz} \), corresponding to option D.
