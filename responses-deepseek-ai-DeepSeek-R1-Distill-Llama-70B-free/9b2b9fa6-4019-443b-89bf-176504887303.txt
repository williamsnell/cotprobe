Question:

For which of the following is it appropriate to use a census?

Options:

A: A two-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis was that the mean expenditure on entertainment by male students at a high school is the same as that of female students.
B: A 95% confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class.
C: A 99% confidence interval of the mean weight of all students in a large college.
D: A confidence interval of the mean income of all families in a country.
E: A one-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the proportion of men over 40 in a city who exercise regularly is greater than 50%.
F: A 95% confidence interval of mean height of teachers in a small town.
G: A confidence interval of the mean age of all employees in a large corporation.
H: A 95% confidence interval of the proportion of people in a large city who have a pet.
I: A two-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the mean height of all basketball players in a country is the same as that of soccer players.
J: None of the above.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistics, specifically when to use a census. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking which of the options A through J is appropriate for using a census. I remember that a census involves collecting data from every member of the population, not just a sample. So, the key here is understanding when it's feasible and appropriate to collect data from everyone rather than taking a sample.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: A two-tailed hypothesis test about the mean expenditure on entertainment by male vs female high school students. Wait, hypothesis testing usually involves samples because you're testing a claim about the population. If it's a hypothesis test, they probably took a sample from the population, not a census. So this might not be the right scenario for a census.

Option B: A 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students in a small town taking AP classes. A small town might have a manageable number of students, so maybe a census is possible here. But confidence intervals are typically based on samples unless the population is very small. I'm not sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: A 99% confidence interval for the mean weight of all students in a large college. A large college would have a lot of students. Collecting data from everyone might be possible, but sometimes even in large populations, they take samples because it's more efficient. But for a census, the size might make it impractical, but it's not impossible. Maybe this is a candidate.

Option D: A confidence interval for the mean income of all families in a country. Countries are huge populations, so taking a census for mean income would be very resource-intensive. Typically, they'd use a sample here. So this is probably not appropriate.

Option E: A one-tailed hypothesis test about the proportion of men over 40 exercising. Again, hypothesis tests generally use samples, so a census isn't the go-to here.

Option F: A 95% confidence interval for the mean height of teachers in a small town. Small town, so maybe feasible. But confidence intervals are often based on samples. However, if the population is small enough, they might opt for a census. But I'm not certain if this is the case.

Option G: A confidence interval for the mean age of all employees in a large corporation. A large corporation has a lot of employees, so using a sample is more practical. Census might not be the best choice here.

Option H: A 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people in a large city who have a pet. Large city means a big population; samples are the norm here, not a census.

Option I: A two-tailed hypothesis test comparing mean heights of basketball and soccer players in a country. Hypothesis testing typically uses samples, so census isn't the way to go.

Option J: None of the above. Hmm, if none of the options are appropriate for a census, then J would be correct.

Wait, let me think again. When is a census appropriate? It's when the population is small enough that collecting data from everyone is feasible and cost-effective. So looking back at the options:

Option B: Small town. The population of students might be small, so perhaps a census is done to get exact data, making a confidence interval unnecessary because you have the population proportion. But wait, confidence intervals are usually for estimates when you have a sample. If you have the entire population, you don't need a confidence interval; you know the exact proportion. So in that case, using a confidence interval suggests they used a sample, not a census.

Similarly, Option C is a large college. Large populations make a census difficult, so they probably sample. So maybe none of the options describe a situation where a census is appropriate.

Wait, but what about when you have a small population? For example, if a town is very small, like a few hundred students, maybe they just collect data from everyone. But in that case, why would they construct a confidence interval? Because confidence intervals are for when you have a sample. If you have the whole population, you don't need an interval; you have the exact value. So in any case where a confidence interval is being constructed, it's likely using a sample, not a census.

So looking through all the options, all the options are either about hypothesis tests (which use samples) or confidence intervals that probably use samples. So none of the options are appropriate for using a census.

Therefore, the correct answer would be J: None of the above.

To determine when it is appropriate to use a census, it is important to remember that a census involves collecting data from every member of the population, rather than a sample. This is typically feasible only when the population is small enough to make data collection from everyone practical and cost-effective. Letâ€™s analyze each option:

- **Option A**: A two-tailed hypothesis test comparing the mean expenditure of male and female students. Hypothesis tests generally use samples to make inferences about populations, so a census is not appropriate here.  
- **Option B**: A 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students in a small town taking AP classes. While the population might be small, confidence intervals are typically based on samples. If a census were used, the exact proportion would already be known, making a confidence interval unnecessary.  
- **Option C**: A 99% confidence interval for the mean weight of all students in a large college. Large populations like a college make a census impractical, so sampling is more likely used.  
- **Option D**: A confidence interval for the mean income of all families in a country. Countries have very large populations, so a census would be highly resource-intensive and impractical. Sampling is the norm here.  
- **Option E**: A one-tailed hypothesis test about the proportion of men over 40 exercising regularly. Hypothesis tests typically rely on samples, not censuses.  
- **Option F**: A 95% confidence interval for the mean height of teachers in a small town. While the population might be small, confidence intervals are usually based on samples. A census would provide exact values, making a confidence interval redundant.  
- **Option G**: A confidence interval for the mean age of all employees in a large corporation. Large corporations have large populations, so sampling is more practical than a census.  
- **Option H**: A 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people in a large city who have a pet. Large cities have large populations, so a census is impractical. Sampling is used instead.  
- **Option I**: A two-tailed hypothesis test comparing the mean height of basketball and soccer players in a country. Hypothesis tests rely on samples, not censuses.  

In all cases, the scenarios describe situations where sampling is more appropriate than a census. Additionally, confidence intervals are typically used when working with samples, as they provide estimates about a population. If a census were used, the exact population parameters would already be known, making confidence intervals unnecessary. Therefore, none of the options describe a situation where a census is appropriate.
