Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. 

The problem goes like this: All students who attend the Peddie School study Latin. Some students who study Latin also study calculus. Jerome is a student at the Peddie School. It can therefore be determined that... and then there are the options from A to J.

Hmm, I need to break this down step by step. 

First, the premises. The first statement is "All students who attend the Peddie School study Latin." So, if someone is a Peddie student, they study Latin. That seems straightforward. So, being a Peddie student implies studying Latin.

The second premise is "Some students who study Latin also study calculus." So, within the group of Latin students, there's a subset that also takes calculus. It's not saying all Latin students study calculus, just some. So, Latin students â†’ some also do calculus.

Now, Jerome is a student at Peddie. So, from the first statement, since he's at Peddie, he must study Latin. That's a given because all Peddie students do. So, we can conclude that Jerome studies Latin.

But what about calculus? The second premise says some Latin students study calculus, but it doesn't specify how many or which ones. So, while it's possible that Jerome studies calculus, it's not certain. The premises don't allow us to conclude that all Latin students take calculus, only some.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Jerome does not study calculus. Well, we don't know that. The premises don't tell us he doesn't; they just say some do, so maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. So A isn't necessarily true.

Option B: Jerome studies Latin. Wait, yes, because he's a Peddie student, so he must study Latin. So B seems correct.

Option C: Jerome studies either calculus or Latin, but not both. Hmm, but we know he studies Latin for sure. Whether he studies calculus is uncertain, but the option says "either/or but not both," which isn't necessarily the case. We can't confirm that, so C isn't a definite conclusion.

Option D: Jerome studies calculus. Again, we can't say for sure. The premises don't provide enough info, so D isn't necessarily true.

Option E: Jerome studies calculus but not Latin. Wait, no, because we know he studies Latin. So E can't be right.

Option F: Jerome studies either calculus or Latin. Well, he definitely studies Latin, so this is true, but it's a bit redundant because we know he studies Latin for sure. So F is true, but B is more specific.

Option G: Jerome studies both calculus and Latin. We can't conclude that because it's only some Latin students who take calculus. So G might be possible, but not certain.

Option H: Jerome studies neither. No, because he's at Peddie, so he studies Latin. So H is wrong.

Option I: Jerome does not study Latin. No, because again, he's at Peddie. So I is wrong.

Option J: Jerome studies both, but only if he chooses. Well, the premises don't talk about choices, so that's adding extra info. So J isn't a conclusion we can draw.

So, putting it all together, the only definite conclusion is that Jerome studies Latin. So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem provides two premises: 

1. All students at Peddie School study Latin.  
2. Some Latin students also study calculus.  

Jerome is a Peddie student, so from the first premise, he must study Latin. The second premise indicates that some Latin students study calculus, but it does not specify whether Jerome is among them. Therefore, the only certain conclusion is that Jerome studies Latin. 

Analyzing the options:  
- **B** is correct because Jerome, as a Peddie student, studies Latin.  
- Other options either make unsupported claims about calculus or contradict the premises.  

**Answer: B**
