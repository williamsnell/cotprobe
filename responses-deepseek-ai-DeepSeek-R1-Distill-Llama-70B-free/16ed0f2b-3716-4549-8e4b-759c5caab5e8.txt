Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutron decay. Hmm, let me think through this. Alright, the question is about a neutron at rest that decays into a proton and an electron. Energy is released and becomes kinetic energy for both the proton and electron. The problem says the proton's mass is 1836 times the electron's mass. I need to find what fraction of the total energy goes into the proton's kinetic energy.

Wait, neutron decay... I remember that in beta decay, a neutron turns into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. Oh wait, but this question doesn't mention the antineutrino. Hmm, maybe it's simplifying and assuming all energy goes to the proton and electron. I guess I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, the initial mass is just the neutron's mass since it's at rest. After decay, the masses are the proton and electron. But the released energy is the mass difference converted into kinetic energy.

Let me jot down the knowns:

Mass of neutron (m_n) = mass of proton (m_p) + mass of electron (m_e) + energy terms (but since energy is kinetic, maybe mass difference times c² gives the energy).

Wait, but the problem states that the proton's mass is 1836 times the electron's. So m_p = 1836 * m_e.

The neutron is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After decay, the proton and electron must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

So, let's denote the kinetic energy of the proton as K_p and that of the electron as K_e.

The total energy released (Q) is the sum of their kinetic energies: Q = K_p + K_e.

I need to find K_p / Q.

But wait, the energy from the decay comes from the mass difference. So the rest mass energy of the neutron is greater than the sum of the rest masses of the proton and electron. The difference is Q.

So, Q = (m_n - m_p - m_e) * c².

But since the problem doesn't give actual masses, perhaps I can express everything in terms of m_e.

Given that m_p = 1836 m_e. So m_n = m_p + m_e + (energy terms, but maybe that's not needed here because Q is the energy released).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

The neutron is initially at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, m_n c².

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the proton's and electron's energies, which include their rest mass plus their kinetic energy.

So, m_n c² = m_p c² + m_e c² + K_p + K_e.

Which simplifies to K_p + K_e = (m_n - m_p - m_e) c² = Q.

So the total energy released is Q, and we're to find K_p/Q.

Now, using conservation of momentum. The neutron's initial momentum is zero, so the proton's and electron's momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, the magnitude of their momenta are equal: p_p = p_e.

But momentum p = gamma * m v, but since the speeds are probably non-relativistic, maybe we can use p = m v.

Wait, but are the electrons and protons moving at relativistic speeds? Hmm, the kinetic energy released in beta decay is typically not extremely high, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can proceed with non-relativistic equations for simplicity, given that it's a multiple-choice question and the math would be easier.

So, assuming p_p = m_p * v_p and p_e = m_e * v_e.

Since p_p = p_e, m_p v_p = m_e v_e => v_e = (m_p / m_e) v_p.

But m_p is 1836 m_e, so v_e = 1836 v_p.

So the electron's velocity is much higher than the proton's.

Now, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

So K_p = (1/2) m_p v_p².

K_e = (1/2) m_e v_e².

But v_e = 1836 v_p, so substituting:

K_e = (1/2) m_e (1836² v_p²) = (1836² m_e / 2) v_p².

Wait, but m_p = 1836 m_e, so m_p = 1836 m_e => m_e = m_p / 1836.

So substituting m_e into K_e:

K_e = ( (1836²) * (m_p / 1836) ) / 2 * v_p² )

Simplify that:

= (1836² * m_p) / (1836 * 2) ) v_p²

= (1836 * m_p) / 2 * v_p²

So K_e = (1836 / 2 ) m_p v_p².

But K_p = (1/2) m_p v_p².

So K_e = 1836 * K_p.

That's because K_e = (1836 / 2) m_p v_p² = 1836 * (1/2 m_p v_p²) )= 1836 K_p.

So K_e is 1836 times larger than K_p.

But wait, since K_p + K_e = Q, substituting:

K_p + 1836 K_p = Q ⇒ 1837 K_p = Q ⇒ K_p = Q / 1837.

So the fraction K_p/Q is 1/1837 ≈ 0.000544.

Now looking at the options, option D is 0.000544.

Wait a second, but the problem didn't mention the antineutrino. In reality, beta decay produces an antineutrino, which carries away some energy. So the total energy released would be split between the proton, electron, and antineutrino. But the question states that energy appears as kinetic energy of proton and electron, so perhaps it's assuming no neutrino, or the neutrino is ignored. So I guess the calculation is correct as above.

So the answer is D.

To determine the fraction of the total energy released that goes into the kinetic energy of the proton during neutron decay, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Key Assumptions and Conservation Laws**:  
   - A neutron at rest decays into a proton, an electron, and energy is released.  
   - The problem assumes all energy released goes into the kinetic energy of the proton and electron, ignoring the antineutrino.  
   - Conservation of momentum applies: the proton and electron have equal and opposite momenta.  

2. **Mass Relationship**:  
   - The proton's mass is 1836 times the electron's mass:  
     \[
     m_p = 1836 \, m_e
     \]

3. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   - Since the neutron is initially at rest, the proton and electron must have equal and opposite momenta:  
     \[
     p_p = p_e
     \]  
   - Using \( p = m v \) (non-relativistic assumption), this gives:  
     \[
     m_p v_p = m_e v_e \implies v_e = \frac{m_p}{m_e} v_p = 1836 \, v_p
     \]  
     Thus, the electron's velocity is much larger than the proton's velocity.

4. **Kinetic Energy Relationship**:  
   - The kinetic energy of each particle is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \).  
   - For the proton:  
     \[
     K_p = \frac{1}{2} m_p v_p^2
     \]  
   - For the electron:  
     \[
     K_e = \frac{1}{2} m_e v_e^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_e (1836 \, v_p)^2 = 1836^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} m_e v_p^2
     \]  
   - Substituting \( m_p = 1836 \, m_e \), we find:  
     \[
     K_e = 1836 \cdot K_p
     \]

5. **Total Energy and Fraction of Proton's Kinetic Energy**:  
   - The total energy released is the sum of the proton's and electron's kinetic energies:  
     \[
     Q = K_p + K_e = K_p + 1836 \, K_p = 1837 \, K_p
     \]  
   - The fraction of the total energy that goes into the proton's kinetic energy is:  
     \[
     \frac{K_p}{Q} = \frac{K_p}{1837 \, K_p} = \frac{1}{1837} \approx 0.000544
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:  
   From the given options, the correct answer is **D: 0.000544**.
