Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Little's argument regarding abortion. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking why Little argues that mothers should have the prerogative to end a pregnancy until the fetus becomes a person. The options are from A to J. 

First, I need to understand the key points of Little's argument. From what I remember, Little's main point is about the moral status of the fetus and the concept of personhood. She suggests that until the fetus is a person, the mother should have the right to make decisions about the pregnancy. 

So, the question is essentially asking for the reason behind this stance. The options given are various possible reasons, and I need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the options:

A: Abortion is presumptively wrong but permissible in extreme cases. I think this is more like the stance of someone who is moderately pro-life, allowing exceptions. I'm not sure if this is Little's position.

B: The fetus isn't a person until it can live independently. This sounds close because it's about personhood, but I'm not sure if Little specifically ties personhood to independent life or other factors like consciousness or self-awareness.

C: The decision rests with the mother. This seems more about who decides rather than the reasoning behind the prerogative.

D: Moral status is irrelevant. That doesn't sound right because Little's argument is about when the fetus gains moral status as a person.

E: Declining radical changes to one's practical identity. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think Little's arguments do touch upon how motherhood changes a woman's life and identity, so this could be a factor.

F: Ethically permissible to abort before personhood. This seems in line with the idea that until the fetus is a person, abortion is permissible. So this could be a possible answer.

G: Right to control one's body. This is a common pro-choice argument, but I think Little's reasoning is more about the fetus's status and the woman's identity rather than just bodily autonomy.

H: No clear answer about abortion's morality. I don't think that's Little's position; she does present a clear argument based on personhood.

I: Abortion is absolutely wrong. That's the opposite of what the question is asking.

J: Legal right to abortion. The question is about the moral prerogative, not legal rights, so probably not J.

Now, going back to the options, the core of Little's argument is that the fetus isn't a person yet, so the mother should have the right to decide. Option F says it's ethically permissible before personhood, which directly relates to the reason. But wait, I also remember that Little emphasizes the woman's right to make this choice, perhaps linking it to her own identity and life plans. So option E, which talks about declining radical changes to one's practical identity, might also be part of her reasoning.

Wait, the question is specifically about why Little argues for the prerogative until the fetus is a person. So it's more about the timing based on the fetus's status. So F seems to fit because it's about the ethical permissibility before personhood.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought Little's argument also includes the idea that the woman's life and identity are significantly impacted. So E could also be a reason. However, the question is about why she thinks the prerogative exists until the fetus is a person, which is more about the fetus's status rather than the mother's identity.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The correct answer is probably F because it's directly about the ethical permissibility based on when the fetus becomes a person. Option E is more about the woman's perspective, which is part of her argument, but the question is specifically about the timing related to the fetus's personhood.

So I think the answer is F.

The question asks why Little argues that mothers should have the prerogative to end a pregnancy until the fetus becomes a person. The key to answering lies in understanding Little's stance on fetal personhood and its implications for the ethics of abortion. 

Option F states that it is ethically permissible to abort a fetus before it becomes a person, which aligns directly with Little's argument that the moral status of the fetus changes upon achieving personhood. While other options, such as E, touch on related aspects like the impact on the woman's identity, the question specifically focuses on the timing of the fetus's personhood as the basis for the prerogative. Therefore, the most accurate answer is F.

Answer: F
