Alright, so I've got this question about how the members of an arbitral tribunal are appointed. Hmm, I remember studying something about arbitration in my international law class. Let me think this through step by step.

Okay, the question asks how the members are appointed, and the options are A, B, and C. Let's look at each option.

Option A says all members are appointed by the parties. Wait, in arbitration, I think the parties usually agree on the arbitrators, but does that mean they appoint all of them? I recall that in some cases, each party might appoint their own arbitrator, and then those two appoint a third one together. So it's not that all are appointed directly by the parties, but perhaps each party appoints one, and they choose the third. So maybe A isn't correct because it says "all" are appointed by the parties, which might not be accurate.

Option B states that all members are appointed by an impartial third party, like the ICJ president. That rings a bell. I think in some cases, especially when parties can't agree, a third party steps in. For example, the President of the International Court of Justice might appoint arbitrators if the parties can't decide. But is this the usual method? I thought that typically, the parties do appoint their own arbitrators, and only in cases of disagreement does a third party get involved. So B might not be the general rule but an exception.

Option C says all members are appointed by the parties from a restricted list. I'm not too sure about this. I know some arbitration rules, like the ICC, might have lists of potential arbitrators, and parties can choose from them. But does that mean all members are chosen this way? Or is it just one of the methods available? I'm a bit fuzzy on this point.

Wait, maybe I should think about how it usually works. In many arbitrations, each party selects one arbitrator, and then those two select the third, who is often the chair. So the tribunal has three members: two party-appointed and one neutral. But the question is about how "the members" are appointed. So in this case, the parties each appoint one, and then together they appoint the third. So technically, the parties are involved in appointing all three, but not each individually. So does that mean option A is correct because all are appointed by the parties? Or is it that each party appoints their own, so the parties collectively appoint all, but not each one directly.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties." If each party appoints one, and the third is appointed by agreement between the parties, then yes, all members are appointed by the parties, either directly or through their agreement. So option A might be correct.

But then again, in some cases, like ad hoc arbitration without institutional rules, the parties might have a harder time agreeing on the third arbitrator. So they might ask a third party, like the ICJ president, to appoint the third member. So in that case, not all members are appointed by the parties.

Hmm, but the question is about how the members are appointed in general. So it's possible that the general rule is that the parties appoint the arbitrators, either by each selecting one and agreeing on the third. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

Typically, in an arbitration tribunal, especially in international arbitration, each party appoints one arbitrator. Then, those two arbitrators select the third, who becomes the president or chair of the tribunal. So in this scenario, two are directly appointed by the parties, and the third is appointed by the two arbitrators, who were appointed by the parties. So indirectly, all three are appointed by the parties through their selected arbitrators.

But option A says "all the members are appointed by the parties." So in that case, yes, because the parties choose two, and those two choose the third on behalf of the parties. So perhaps the answer is A.

Alternatively, in some institutional arbitrations, like under the ICC rules, the parties might select from a list provided by the institution. So the institution doesn't appoint them but provides a list. So that would align more with option C, where the parties choose from a restricted list.

Wait, but option C says "appointed by the parties from a restricted list." So the initial selection is from a list, but the appointment is done by the parties. So in that case, it's still the parties appointing, but using a list. So maybe that's also a correct scenario, but the question is which option is correct as a general rule.

I think the general rule is that parties appoint their own arbitrators. So the answer would be A. But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes a third party might appoint one or more if there's a dispute.

But the question is about how the members are appointed, not necessarily under specific rules. So in general, the parties appoint their own arbitrators, so A would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I remember that in some cases, like when the arbitration is administered by an institution, the institution might appoint the arbitrators if the parties don't agree. So maybe option B is also possible. But the question is phrased as a general statement, so I think the most accurate answer is that the parties appoint the members, perhaps each selecting one, and agreeing on the third. So the answer would be A.

The appointment of members to an arbitral tribunal typically involves the parties selecting the arbitrators, either directly or through a process where each party appoints one arbitrator and they collectively agree on the third. This is the general rule, though exceptions exist where a third party may appoint members if the parties cannot agree. Given the options, the most accurate answer is that all members are appointed by the parties.

Answer: A
