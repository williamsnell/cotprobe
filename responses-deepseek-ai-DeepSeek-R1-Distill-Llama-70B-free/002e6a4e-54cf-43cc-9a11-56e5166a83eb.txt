Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the center-of-mass energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that gold ions are collided head-on, each with an energy of 100 GeV per nucleon. I need to find the center-of-mass energy in TeV. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, what's the center-of-mass energy again? I remember that in particle collisions, the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) is important because it determines what kind of particles can be produced. For collider experiments where particles are moving in opposite directions with equal energy, the calculation might be a bit different than if they were moving in the same direction.

Each ion is gold, which has a certain atomic number. Oh right, gold's atomic number is 79, so each ion has 79 protons, meaning each has 79 nucleons (assuming it's the isotope with about that number, but wait, gold's most common isotope is Au-197, which has 79 protons and 118 neutrons, so 197 nucleons total. Wait, but the problem says the energy is 100 GeV per nucleon. Oh, so each nucleon has 100 GeV of energy. So each gold ion has 79*100 GeV? Or wait, wait no, per nucleon. So the total energy per ion would be 100 GeV multiplied by the number of nucleons. But wait, the problem states "energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon." So each nucleon in the ion has 100 GeV of energy.

Wait, but when two ions collide head-on with equal energy, each with energy E, then the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) is calculated using the relativistic formula. For two particles colliding, each with energy E, moving in opposite directions, their 4-momenta add up.

In the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is the sum of their energies, but wait, no. Because in the lab frame, each has energy E, but their momenta are opposite. So the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is the square root of (sum of the squares of the energies plus the cross terms), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the formula for the center-of-mass energy when two particles of energy E1 and E2 collide is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2 ) ), but since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite vectors. So (p1 + p2) would be p1 - p2 if they're opposite. Wait, but if the particles are moving in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum, then the vector sum would be p1 - p2, but if p1 and p2 are equal in magnitude but opposite, then their vector sum would be zero? Oh wait, no, because each is moving in opposite directions, so their momenta are vectors pointing opposite. So if each has momentum p, then p1 is +p and p2 is -p. So p1 + p2 = 0. So the spatial part cancels out. So the invariant mass squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But p1 and p2 are vectors. So, if they're opposite, (p1 + p2) is zero. So s = (E1 + E2)^2.

Wait, that can't be right because in reality, the center-of-mass energy isn't just the sum of the two energies. Because each particle has energy E which includes their rest mass energy. So perhaps I should think in terms of each particle's total energy and momentum.

Wait, each gold ion is moving at relativistic speeds, so their energy is much larger than their rest mass. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the formula for the center-of-mass energy when two particles collide with energies E1 and E2 and equal magnitude momenta but opposite directions.

Wait, the formula is sqrt(2 * E1 * E2 * (1 + cos θ)), where θ is the angle between their momenta. In a head-on collision, θ is 180 degrees, so cos θ is -1. So it becomes sqrt(2 * E1 * E2 * (1 -1)) = 0. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, no, wait. The general formula for the center-of-mass energy when two particles collide is:

sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 c) + (p2 c) )^2 )

But since they're moving in opposite directions, p2 = -p1. So (p1 + p2) is zero. So the equation becomes sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 ), which is E1 + E2. But that can't be right because in reality, the center-of-mass energy is higher than each individual energy. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider that each particle's energy is their total energy, including rest mass. So each ion has energy E = gamma * m * c², where m is the rest mass of the ion. So when two particles collide head-on, each with energy E, then the center-of-mass energy is given by sqrt(2 * E1 * E2 + 2 * E1 * E2 * cos θ). Wait, maybe I should think of it another way.

Wait, another approach: the center-of-mass energy squared (s) is equal to the square of the sum of the four-momenta of the two particles. So s = (p1 + p2)^μ (p1 + p2)_μ. Since p1 and p2 are four-vectors, this is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But because they're moving in opposite directions, the momenta are in opposite directions. So p2 = -p1 in three-vector terms. So p1 c + p2 c = p1 c - p1 c = 0. So s = (E1 + E2)^2.

Wait, that would mean that the center-of-mass energy is simply E1 + E2. But that doesn't account for the rest mass of the particles. Hmm, perhaps that's only true when the particles are massless, but in reality, each ion has a significant rest mass.

Wait, no, wait, in reality, the four-momentum includes rest mass. So for each ion, the four-momentum is (E, p c), where E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So when calculating s, it's:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

But since p2 is in the opposite direction, p2 = - p1.

So p1 c + p2 c = p1 c - p1 c = 0.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2.

Wait, but E1 and E2 are each the total energy of the ions. So if each ion has energy E, then s = (2E)^2.

So the center-of-mass energy would be sqrt(s) = 2E.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the case of electrons and positrons colliding, each with energy E, the center-of-mass energy is 2E. So that checks out. So for each ion with energy E, the center-of-mass energy is 2E.

Wait, but wait, the given energy is 100 GeV per nucleon. So each nucleon has 100 GeV. So each ion's total energy is 100 GeV multiplied by the number of nucleons, which is 197 for gold (Au-197 has 79 protons and 118 neutrons, so 197 nucleons). So E per ion is 100 GeV * 197.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me calculate that. 100 GeV * 197 = 19,700 GeV. Which is 19.7 TeV. But wait, earlier I thought that the center-of-mass energy is 2E, so 2 * 19.7 TeV would be 39.4 TeV. But wait, that's not matching because each ion's energy is 100 GeV per nucleon, and each has 197 nucleons.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again. The energy is 100 GeV per nucleon. So each nucleon has 100 GeV of energy. So the total energy per ion is 100 GeV multiplied by the number of nucleons, which is 197. So E_ion = 100 * 197 GeV = 19,700 GeV = 19.7 TeV.

Wait, but each ion has energy E_ion = 19.7 TeV. When two ions collide head-on, each with energy E_ion, then the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = 2 * E_ion. So that would be 39.4 TeV. So the answer would be E: 39.4.

But wait, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think again. The formula is sqrt(s) = 2 * E, where E is the energy of each beam when they're colliding head-on. So in this case, each ion's energy is 19.7 TeV, so 2 * 19.7 TeV would be 39.4 TeV. That's option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating because the energy per nucleon is given as 100 GeV. So each nucleon's energy is 100 GeV, but the ion's total energy is 100 GeV multiplied by the number of nucleons, which is 197.

Wait, another approach: the energy per nucleon is the kinetic energy or the total energy? The problem says "energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon." In particle physics, when they say "energy per nucleon," I think they usually refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, the energy per nucleon being 100 GeV means that each nucleon has a total energy of 100 GeV. So the ion's total energy would be 100 GeV multiplied by the number of nucleons, which is 197, giving E_ion = 19,700 GeV = 19.7 TeV.

Then, when two ions collide head-on, each with E_ion, the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = 2 * E_ion = 39.4 TeV. So the answer would be E: 39.4.

But let me think again. Suppose each ion has energy E, then in the center-of-mass frame, sqrt(s) = 2E. So if each ion's E is 19.7 TeV, then sqrt(s) is 39.4 TeV.

Wait, but I'm assuming that the energy per nucleon is the total energy, including rest mass. Because the rest mass of a nucleon is about 0.938 GeV. So 100 GeV per nucleon is much larger than the rest mass, so the ion is ultra-relativistic. But the calculation remains the same.

So the answer should be E: 39.4 TeV.
</think>

To determine the center-of-mass energy of the collision at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), we start by analyzing the given data. Each gold ion is stated to have an energy of 100 GeV per nucleon. Since gold ions are composed of 197 nucleons (79 protons and 118 neutrons), the total energy of each ion is:

\[
E_{\text{ion}} = 100 \, \text{GeV/nucleon} \times 197 \, \text{nucleons} = 19,700 \, \text{GeV} = 19.7 \, \text{TeV}.
\]

When two gold ions collide head-on with equal energy, the center-of-mass energy (\(\sqrt{s}\)) is calculated using the relativistic formula for two particles colliding with equal energy \(E\) and opposite momenta:

\[
\sqrt{s} = 2E_{\text{ion}}.
\]

Substituting \(E_{\text{ion}} = 19.7 \, \text{TeV}\):

\[
\sqrt{s} = 2 \times 19.7 \, \text{TeV} = 39.4 \, \text{TeV}.
\]

Thus, the center-of-mass energy of the collision is **39.4 TeV**, corresponding to option **E**.
