Okay, so I'm trying to solve this economics problem about Mr. Ellis and his frisbee sales. Let me read the question again and break it down step by step.

So, Mr. Ellis sells these Buzzbee Frisbees. Normally, in an average month, he sells 500 frisbees at $5 each. Next month, there's this contest where if he sells 1,000 frisbees, he gets an extra two weeks vacation with pay. He wants to achieve this without working too hard, so he's planning to lower the price to boost his sales. The question is, what price should he charge to sell 1,000 frisbees, given that the demand elasticity (e) is -3.

Wait, right, demand elasticity. I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The formula for price elasticity of demand is e = (Q2/Q1) / (P2/P1), but since it's percentage changes, it's the same as (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P). Oh wait, actually, the formula is e = (% change in Q) / (% change in P). And since demand is elastic, a higher absolute value of e means that quantity demanded is very responsive to price changes.

In this case, the elasticity e is given as -3. But when calculating, I can ignore the negative sign because it just indicates the inverse relationship (as price goes up, quantity goes down, and vice versa). So the magnitude is 3, which is greater than 1. That means demand is elastic, so a change in price will lead to a larger change in quantity demanded.

Mr. Ellis wants to double his sales from 500 to 1,000. So the change in quantity is from 500 to 1,000. That's an increase of 500, which is a 100% increase. Because (1000-500)/500 = 1, which is 100% increase.

So the percentage change in quantity demanded is 100%. The elasticity is 3, which relates the percentage change in quantity to the percentage change in price. So e = (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P). Plugging in the known values, 3 = (100%) / (ΔP/P). Wait, that would mean ΔP/P = 100% / 3 ≈ 33.33%. So the price needs to decrease by approximately 33.33%.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is e = (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P). So if e is 3, then 3 = (ΔQ/100) / (ΔP/P_initial). Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me write it correctly.

The formula is e = ( (Q2 - Q1)/Q1 ) / ( (P2 - P1)/P1 ) ). So that's (ΔQ/Q1) divided by (ΔP/P1). So with Q1 being the original quantity (500), Q2 is 1000, so ΔQ is 500. So (500 / 500) = 1. So ΔQ/Q1 is 1, which is 100% increase.

So e = (1) / (ΔP/P1). So rearranged, ΔP/P1 = 1/e. Since e is 3, ΔP/P1 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333, which is a 33.33% change in price.

But wait, elasticity is negative, but we're taking the absolute value here. So the price needs to change by what percentage? Since quantity increased when price decreased (because demand is elastic, lower price leads to higher quantity bought), the price must have decreased. So ΔP is a negative change, but in terms of percentage, it's a decrease of 33.33%.

So the original price P1 is $5. So the new price P2 would be P1 minus 33.33% of P1. Let me calculate that. 33.33% of 5 is 5 * (1/3) ≈ 1.6667. So P2 = 5 - 1.6667 = 3.3333, which is approximately $3.33.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option G: $3, or option J: $3.50. Hmm, wait, but perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, let me double-check the formula to make sure I'm not making a mistake. So e = (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P). So e = 3, ΔQ/Q is 500/500 = 1, so 3 = 1 / (ΔP/P). So ΔP/P = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So the price should decrease by approximately 33.33%. So the new price is 5 * (1 - 1/3) = 5 * (2/3) ≈ 3.3333. So about $3.33. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: $3.50, but wait, option G is $3. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait another thought: Sometimes, elasticity is calculated using average values for P and Q, especially when dealing with large changes. The problem statement says to use average values for P and Q. Oh, in that case, the formula uses the midpoint method.

Wait, what's the midpoint method? Oh right, when calculating elasticity over a large change in price and quantity, you take the average of the initial and final quantities and the average of the initial and final prices to compute the percentage changes.

So in this case, the initial quantity Q1 is 500, and the final Q2 is 1000. So the average Q is (500 + 1000)/2 = 750.

Similarly, the initial price P1 is $5, and the final price P2 is what we're trying to find. So the average price would be (5 + P2)/2.

The percentage change in quantity is (Q2 - Q1)/average Q = (1000 - 500)/750 = 500/750 ≈ 0.6667, which is a 66.67% increase.

The percentage change in price is (P2 - P1)/average P = (P2 -5)/( (5 + P2)/2 ). So the elasticity formula is e = (%ΔQ)/(%ΔP). But since e is -3, taking absolute value gives 3.

So, 3 = (66.67%) / ( (P2 -5)/( (5+P2)/2 ) * 100 )

Wait, let me reorganize this. The equation is:

e = ( (Q2 - Q1)/((Q1 + Q2)/2) ) / ( (P2 - P1)/((P1 + P2)/2) ) )

Plugging in the numbers:

e = ( (1000 - 500)/(750) ) / ( (P2 -5)/( (5 + P2)/2 ) )

Simplify numerator: 500/750 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Denominator: (P2 -5) / ( (5 + P2)/2 ) = 2(P2 -5)/(5 + P2).

So e = (2/3) / [ 2(P2 -5)/(5 + P2) ) ] = (2/3) * [ (5 + P2) / (2(P2 -5)) ) ].

Simplify numerator: 2/3 multiplied by (5 + P2)/(2(P2 -5)).

The 2 in numerator and denominator cancel, so we get (1/3) * (5 + P2)/(P2 -5).

Now, set e = 3 (absolute value):

3 = (1/3) * (5 + P2)/(P2 -5).

Multiply both sides by 3:

9 = (5 + P2)/(P2 -5).

Multiply both sides by (P2 -5):

9(P2 -5) = 5 + P2.

Expand left side: 9P2 -45 = 5 + P2.

Bring all terms to one side: 9P2 - P2 -45 -5 = 0 → 8P2 -50 =0 → 8P2 =50 → P2=50/8=6.25.

Wait, that can't be right because if the price increases, the quantity demanded would decrease, but in this case, Mr. Ellis is lowering the price to increase sales. So getting P2=6.25, which is higher than 5, doesn't make sense because that would lead to lower sales, not higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let's think again. The elasticity e is -3, so when using the formula, the denominator would involve (P2 - P1), which could be negative because price is decreasing. So when I set up the equation, perhaps I should consider the signs correctly.

Wait, let's approach the equation again, this time considering the signs. The formula for elasticity is:

e = (Q2 - Q1)/( (Q1 + Q2)/2 ) / ( (P2 - P1)/( (P1 + P2)/2 ) )

e = [ (1000 -500)/750 ] / [ (P2 -5)/( (5 + P2)/2 ) ]

Which is (500/750) / [ (P2-5)/( (5+P2)/2 ) ]

Which is (2/3) / [ (2(P2-5))/(5 + P2) ) ]

So e = (2/3) * (5 + P2)/(2(P2 -5)) )

Simplify: (5 + P2) / (3(P2 -5)) )

And e is given as -3. So:

(5 + P2)/(3(P2 -5)) ) = -3

Multiply both sides by 3(P2 -5):

5 + P2 = -9(P2 -5)

Expand right side: -9P2 +45

So 5 + P2 = -9P2 +45

Bring all terms to left side: P2 +9P2 +5 -45=0 → 10P2 -40=0 → 10P2=40 → P2=4.

So the new price should be $4. Looking at the options, option C is $4.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if he lowers the price to $4, which is a $1 decrease from $5, that's a 20% decrease. Let's see what happens to quantity.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the midpoint method, I ended up with P2=4. Let me just verify with the elasticity formula.

So using P2=4, let's compute elasticity.

The average Q is (500 +1000)/2=750.

The average P is (5+4)/2=4.5.

So % change in Q: (1000-500)/750 = 500/750≈0.6667 or 66.67%.

% change in P: (4-5)/4.5 = (-1)/4.5≈-0.2222 or -22.22%.

Elasticity e= (66.67%) / (-22.22%)≈-3, which matches the given e=-3. So yes, that works.

Earlier, when I didn't use the midpoint, I got P2≈3.33, but that didn't account for using average values as per the question's instruction. So the correct approach is using the midpoint method, leading to P2=4, which is option C.

To determine the price Mr. Ellis should charge to sell 1,000 "Buzzbee Frisbees," we use the concept of price elasticity of demand. The elasticity (e) is given as -3, indicating elastic demand. The formula for elasticity is:

\[
e = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{ change in price}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate percentage change in quantity demanded
Mr. Ellis wants to increase sales from 500 to 1,000 frisbees. The percentage change in quantity demanded is:

\[
\% \Delta Q = \frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{Q_1} \times 100 = \frac{1000 - 500}{500} \times 100 = 100\%
\]

### Step 2: Use elasticity to find percentage change in price
Rearranging the elasticity formula:

\[
\% \Delta P = \frac{\% \Delta Q}{e} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33\%
\]

Since demand is elastic, a decrease in price will lead to an increase in quantity demanded. Thus, the price must decrease by approximately 33.33%.

### Step 3: Calculate the new price
The original price (\(P_1\)) is $5. The new price (\(P_2\)) is calculated as:

\[
P_2 = P_1 \times (1 - \frac{\% \Delta P}{100}) = 5 \times (1 - 0.3333) = 5 \times 0.6667 \approx 3.33
\]

### Step 4: Verify using midpoint elasticity formula
The problem specifies using average values for \(P\) and \(Q\). The midpoint method calculates percentage changes using the averages of initial and final values:

- Average quantity (\(\bar{Q}\)) = \(\frac{Q_1 + Q_2}{2} = \frac{500 + 1000}{2} = 750\)
- Average price (\(\bar{P}\)) = \(\frac{P_1 + P_2}{2}\)

Using the midpoint method, the elasticity formula becomes:

\[
e = \frac{\frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{\bar{Q}}}{\frac{P_2 - P_1}{\bar{P}}}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
3 = \frac{\frac{1000 - 500}{750}}{\frac{P_2 - 5}{\frac{5 + P_2}{2}}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{1000 - 500}{750} = \frac{500}{750} = 0.6667
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\frac{P_2 - 5}{\frac{5 + P_2}{2}} = \frac{2(P_2 - 5)}{5 + P_2}
\]

Substitute back into the equation:

\[
3 = \frac{0.6667}{\frac{2(P_2 - 5)}{5 + P_2}}
\]

Rearrange and solve for \(P_2\):

\[
3 = \frac{0.6667 \times (5 + P_2)}{2(P_2 - 5)}
\]

\[
6 = \frac{0.6667 \times (5 + P_2)}{P_2 - 5}
\]

\[
6(P_2 - 5) = 0.6667(5 + P_2)
\]

\[
6P_2 - 30 = 3.3335 + 0.6667P_2
\]

\[
5.3333P_2 = 33.3335
\]

\[
P_2 = 6.25
\]

This result is inconsistent with expectations because a price increase would reduce quantity demanded. Reassessing the calculation, the correct approach yields:

\[
P_2 = 4
\]

### Step 5: Verify the result
Using \(P_2 = 4\), the percentage change in price is:

\[
\% \Delta P = \frac{4 - 5}{5} \times 100 = -20\%
\]

The percentage change in quantity demanded is:

\[
\% \Delta Q = \frac{1000 - 500}{500} \times 100 = 100\%
\]

Elasticity is:

\[
e = \frac{\% \Delta Q}{\% \Delta P} = \frac{100}{-20} = -5
\]

This does not match the given elasticity of -3. Correcting the calculation, the midpoint method confirms that \(P_2 = 4\) satisfies the elasticity condition when using average values for \(P\) and \(Q\).

### Final Answer:
The price Mr. Ellis should charge to sell 1,000 frisbees is **$4**.
