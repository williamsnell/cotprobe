Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. The question is about autosomal recessive disorders. Let me think about what I remember from my biology classes.

Alright, the setup is that both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder. I need to figure out the probability that each of their children will also be affected. Hmm.

Wait, autosomal means it's not on the sex chromosomes, right? So it's one of the other 22 pairs. And recessive, so you need two copies of the defective gene to show the trait.

Each parent has the disorder, which means they're homozygous recessive. Because if someone has an autosomal recessive disorder, they must have two recessive alleles. So their genotype would be, let's say, 'aa'.

When both parents are 'aa', what happens when they have children? I remember that each parent can only pass on one allele for each gene. So each parent will give either the 'a' or the other 'a' since that's all they have.

So the possible combinations for the child would be a from mom and a from dad. That's 'aa'. So every child would get two 'a's, making them affected as well.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So in a Punnett square, each parent would contribute 'a' and 'a'. So the square would look like:

   a    a
a a    a
a    a a
   a    a

Wait, no, the Punnett square for two homozygous recessive parents (aa x aa) would result in all offspring being aa. Because each parent can only give an 'a' allele. So every child gets a from mom and a from dad, so aa.

So the probability is 100% that each child will be affected. So the correct answer should be 1, which is option F.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm mixing something up. So the parents are both affected, so they are aa. Each child only gets a from each parent. So 100% chance. Yeah, that makes sense.

If both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, they must both have the homozygous recessive genotype (e.g., **aa**). In this case, each parent can only pass on the recessive allele ('a') to their offspring. 

Using a Punnett square, the cross would look like this:

```
   a     a
a a     a
a     a a
   a     a
```

As shown, all possible offspring will inherit one 'a' from each parent, resulting in the genotype **aa**. Therefore, every child will be affected by the disorder. This means the probability that each child will be affected is **100%**.

The correct answer is **F: 1**.

Answer: F
