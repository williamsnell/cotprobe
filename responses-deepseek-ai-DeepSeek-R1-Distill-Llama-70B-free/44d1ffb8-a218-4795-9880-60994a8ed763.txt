Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. The question is about calculating the weight of ammonia produced when 200 kg of calcium cyanamide reacts. The chemical equation given is CaCN₂ + 3H₂O → CaCO₃ + 2NH₃.

Hmm, right. I remember that in stoichiometry problems, it's all about the mole ratios. So first, I think I need to find the molar masses of the substances involved.

Let me start by writing down the molar masses. Calcium (Ca) is about 40 g/mol, carbon (C) is 12 g/mol, nitrogen (N) is 14 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol.

So, for calcium cyanamide (CaCN₂), the molar mass would be:
Ca: 40
C: 12
N₂: 14 * 2 = 28
Adding them up: 40 + 12 + 28 = 80 g/mol.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, CaCN₂ is calcium cyanamide, right? So the formula is CaCN₂. So yeah, that's correct. So 80 g/mol.

Ammonia (NH₃) has a molar mass of:
N:14, H₃:3*(1)=3. So 14+3=17 g/mol.

The reaction ratio is 1 mole of CaCN₂ producing 2 moles of NH₃. So the mole ratio of CaCN₂ to NH₃ is 1:2.

Now, the problem gives 200 kg of CaCN₂. I think I need to convert that into moles. Since 1 mole is 80 g, 200 kg is 200,000 grams. So moles of CaCN₂ = 200,000 g / 80 g/mol = 2500 moles.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 200 kg is 200,000 grams. Divided by 80 g/mol. 200000 ÷ 80 = 2500? Hmm, yes, because 80 * 2500 = 200,000. So that's correct.

Since the reaction produces 2 moles of NH₃ for each mole of CaCN₂, the moles of NH₃ produced should be 2500 * 2 = 5000 moles.

Now, to find the mass of NH₃, I multiply the moles by the molar mass. So 5000 moles * 17 g/mol = 85,000 grams. Which is 85 kg.

Looking at the options, option B is 85 kg. So the answer should be B.

To determine the weight of ammonia (NH₃) produced when 200 kg of calcium cyanamide (CaCN₂) reacts, we use the provided chemical equation:

**CaCN₂ + 3H₂O → CaCO₃ + 2NH₃**

### Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of CaCN₂
- Calcium (Ca): 40 g/mol  
- Carbon (C): 12 g/mol  
- Nitrogen (N₂): 14 × 2 = 28 g/mol  
**Molar mass of CaCN₂ = 40 + 12 + 28 = 80 g/mol**

### Step 2: Convert the mass of CaCN₂ to moles
Given 200 kg of CaCN₂, convert to grams:  
200 kg = 200,000 g  
Moles of CaCN₂ = mass / molar mass = 200,000 g / 80 g/mol = 2500 mol

### Step 3: Use the mole ratio to find moles of NH₃
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of CaCN₂ produces 2 moles of NH₃.  
Moles of NH₃ = 2500 mol × 2 = 5000 mol

### Step 4: Calculate the mass of NH₃
Molar mass of NH₃:  
- Nitrogen (N): 14 g/mol  
- Hydrogen (H₃): 3 × 1 = 3 g/mol  
**Molar mass of NH₃ = 14 + 3 = 17 g/mol**

Mass of NH₃ = moles × molar mass = 5000 mol × 17 g/mol = 85,000 g = 85 kg

### Final Answer:
The weight of ammonia produced is **85 kg**, which corresponds to option **B**.
