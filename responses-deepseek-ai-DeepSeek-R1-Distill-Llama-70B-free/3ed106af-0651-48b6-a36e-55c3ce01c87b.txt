Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the dimension of the parallelepiped of maximum volume that's circumscribed by a sphere of radius R. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a parallelepiped is a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. But when it's circumscribed by a sphere, it must fit perfectly inside the sphere, meaning all its vertices lie on the sphere's surface. Oh wait, right, so the sphere touches all eight vertices of the parallelepiped.

Wait, but a general parallelepiped has three edge lengths, let's say a, b, c, and the angles between them. But for maximum volume, I think the shape becomes a cube. Because symmetry often gives maxima or minima in such optimization problems. So if it's a cube, then each edge is equal, right?

But let me not jump to conclusions. Let's try to approach this step by step. The volume of a parallelepiped is given by V = a b c, but that's only for a rectangular prism, right? Wait, no. The general formula is V = a b c times the square root of (1 + 2cos α cos β cos γ - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ), where α, β, γ are the angles between the edges. But that seems complicated. Maybe if the parallelepiped is a rectangular prism, the angles are all 90 degrees, so the volume is just a b c.

Wait, wait. No, a parallelepiped can have non-right angles. But when I'm looking for maximum volume, maybe the maximum occurs when all edges are equal and angles are 90 degrees, making it a cube. Because that's the most symmetric case.

So if the parallelepiped is a cube, then each edge is the same length. Since the sphere has radius R, the diameter is 2R. The space diagonal of the cube should be equal to the diameter of the sphere because the cube is inscribed in the sphere. So the space diagonal is 2R.

The space diagonal of a cube with edge length a is a√3. So setting that equal to 2R, a√3 = 2R. Solving for a gives a = (2R)/√3. So each edge of the cube is 2R/√3.

Wait, but the question asks for the dimension. Since it's a cube, all edges are the same, so the edge length is 2R/√3. Looking at the options, option F is 2/sqrt(3) R, which matches this. So the answer should be F.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another thought: the maximum volume occurs when the parallelepiped is a cube. Is there a way to prove that without assuming it? Well, using Lagrange multipliers perhaps. Let's try that approach.

We want to maximize V = a b c, subject to the constraint that the parallelepiped is circumscribed by the sphere. The sphere's equation for the vertices is that each vertex is at a distance R from the center. For a parallelepiped centered at the origin, the vertices would be at (±a/2, ±b/2, ±c/2). The distance from the origin to each vertex is sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2 + (c/2)^2] = R. So,

(a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 = R^2.

Simplify that: (a² + b² + c²) /4 = R² → a² + b² + c² = 4 R².

So the constraint is a² + b² + c² = 4 R².

We need to maximize V = a b c under this condition.

Using Lagrange multipliers, set up the function:

f(a,b,c) = a b c,

with the constraint g(a,b,c) = a² + b² + c² - 4 R² = 0.

The method says that at maximum, the gradient of f is proportional to the gradient of g.

So,

∇f = λ ∇g,

which gives the partial derivatives:

df/da = bc = λ * 2a,

df/db = ac = λ * 2b,

df/dc = ab = λ * 2c.

From the first equation, bc = 2 a λ.

Second, ac = 2 b λ.

Third, ab = 2 c λ.

Divide the first equation by the second:

(bc)/(ac) = (2a λ)/(2b λ) → (b/a) = (a)/(b) → b² = a² → b = a or b = -a. Since lengths are positive, b = a.

Similarly, from the second and third equations:

(ac)/(ab) = (2b λ)/(2c λ) → c/b = b/c → c² = b² → c = b.

So a = b = c. So the maximum occurs when all sides are equal, hence the shape is a cube.

Thus, each edge is a = (2 R)/√3, as calculated before.

Looking back at the options, F is (2/√3) R, so the answer is F.

To find the dimension of the parallelepiped of maximum volume circumscribed by a sphere of radius \( R \), we start by noting that the parallelepiped must fit perfectly inside the sphere, with all its vertices lying on the sphere's surface. The sphere's radius is \( R \), so its diameter is \( 2R \). 

For a parallelepiped, the space diagonal of the shape must equal the sphere's diameter, as the vertices are on the sphere. If the parallelepiped is a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped), the space diagonal of the cube is given by \( a\sqrt{3} \), where \( a \) is the edge length of the cube. Setting this equal to the sphere's diameter, we have:

\[
a\sqrt{3} = 2R \implies a = \frac{2R}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Thus, the edge length of the cube is \( \frac{2R}{\sqrt{3}} \). This result can also be confirmed using the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the volume \( V = abc \) of the parallelepiped under the constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4R^2 \). The optimization shows that the maximum volume occurs when \( a = b = c \), confirming that the shape is a cube.

From the given options, the edge length \( \frac{2R}{\sqrt{3}} \) corresponds to option **F**.
