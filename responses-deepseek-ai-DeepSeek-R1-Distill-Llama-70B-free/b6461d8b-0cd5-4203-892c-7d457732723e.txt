Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: Suppose the speed of an electron is 1 × 10^6 m/s, and the measurement precision involves an uncertainty in speed of 1 percent. How precisely can the position of the electron be simultaneously determined? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, that's the one where you can't precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. The more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

So the formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Right. Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.

Wait, but what's the uncertainty in momentum here? The problem gives an uncertainty in speed, which is 1 percent. The speed is given as 1e6 m/s, so the uncertainty in speed Δv is 1% of that, which is 0.01 * 1e6 = 1e4 m/s. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. 1% is 0.01. So 1e6 * 0.01 is 1e4 m/s. So Δv is 1e4 m/s? Or wait, no, 1% of 1e6 is 1e4? Let me calculate that. 1e6 is 1,000,000. 1% is 10,000. Yeah, so Δv is 1e4 m/s.

But momentum p is mass times velocity. The mass of an electron is about 9.1e-31 kg, I remember that. So the uncertainty in momentum Δp would be the mass times Δv, right? Because Δp = m * Δv.

So let me calculate that. m = 9.1e-31 kg, Δv is 1e4 m/s. So Δp = 9.1e-31 * 1e4 = 9.1e-27 kg·m/s.

Now, plug that into the Heisenberg equation. Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). I need to solve for Δx. So Δx ≥ h/(4π Δp).

What's h? Planck's constant is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So h/(4π) is about 6.626e-34 / (4 * π). Let me calculate that. 4 * π is roughly 12.566. So 6.626e-34 / 12.566 ≈ 5.27e-35 J·s.

Wait, now Δp is 9.1e-27 kg·m/s. So Δx ≥ (5.27e-35) / (9.1e-27) )

Let me compute that. 5.27e-35 divided by 9.1e-27 is approximately (5.27 / 9.1) * 1e-8. 5.27 divided by 9.1 is about 0.578. So 0.578e-8 meters, which is 5.78e-9 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.8 × 10^-9 m. Oh wait, but let me check my calculations again, maybe I messed up a step.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the uncertainty principle is written with h-bar (ℏ) instead of h. Oh wait, because ℏ = h/(2π), so the inequality is Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2. Wait, no, wait. The Heisenberg principle is often stated as Δx Δp ≥ (h/(2π)), which is the same as ℏ/2. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me check.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δx Δp ≥ h/(4π). Or sometimes written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π). So let me clarify.

Wait, if I use the formula as Δx Δp ≥ h/(4π), then I did it right earlier. Because h is 6.626e-34, so h/(4π) is about 5.27e-35.

So the calculation I did earlier was correct. So the position uncertainty is approximately 5.78e-9 meters, which matches option C.

Looking back at the options:

A: 1.1 × 10^-8 m

B: 3.3 × 10^-10 m

C: 5.8 × 10^-9 m

D: 6.6 × 10^-9 m

E: 4.5 × 10^-7 m

Hmm, option C is 5.8e-9, which is what I got. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the numbers more accurately.

Compute h/(4π): h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s. 4π is about 12.566370614. So 6.62607015e-34 / 12.566370614 = let me compute that.

6.62607015e-34 divided by 12.566370614.

6.62607015 / 12.566370614 ≈ approx 0.527. So 0.527e-34 (wait, no, 6.626e-34 divided by 12.566 is 0.527e-34? No, wait, no, 6.626e-34 / 12.566 = (6.626 / 12.566) * 1e-34 = approx 0.527 * 1e-34 = 5.27e-35, which is what I had before.

Then, Δp = m * Δv = 9.1e-31 kg * 1e4 m/s = 9.1e-27 kg·m/s.

So Δx ≥ (5.27e-35) / (9.1e-27) = 5.27e-35 / 9.1e-27 = (5.27 / 9.1) * 1e-8.

5.27 / 9.1 is approximately 0.578, so 0.578e-8 is 5.78e-9 m, which is option C.

So yes, I think option C is correct.

To determine how precisely the position of the electron can be measured, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}
\]

Here:
- \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position,
- \( \Delta p \) is the uncertainty in momentum,
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta p \)
The uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) is related to the uncertainty in velocity \( \Delta v \) by:

\[
\Delta p = m \cdot \Delta v
\]

The mass of the electron is \( m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), and the uncertainty in velocity is given as 1% of the speed \( v = 1 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus:

\[
\Delta v = 0.01 \cdot 1 \times 10^6 = 1 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s}
\]

\[
\Delta p = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1 \times 10^4 = 9.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \Delta x \)
Rearranging the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to solve for \( \Delta x \):

\[
\Delta x \geq \frac{h}{4\pi \cdot \Delta p}
\]

Substitute \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \Delta p = 9.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta x \geq \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4\pi \cdot 9.1 \times 10^{-27}}
\]

First, calculate \( 4\pi \):

\[
4\pi \approx 12.566
\]

Now calculate \( h / (4\pi) \):

\[
\frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{12.566} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-35} \, \text{J·s}
\]

Finally, divide by \( \Delta p \):

\[
\Delta x \geq \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-35}}{9.1 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 5.78 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The calculated value of \( \Delta x \) is approximately \( 5.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
