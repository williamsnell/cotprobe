Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about systematic desensitization, and I need to figure out which option isn't a step used by a therapist employing this method. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to work through this.

First, I remember that systematic desensitization is a behavior therapy technique used to treat phobias and anxiety disorders. The main idea is to gradually expose the client to the feared object or situation, starting from the least anxiety-provoking to the most, while teaching relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Having the client confront the actual feared object or situation. I think this is part of in vivo exposure, which is a component of systematic desensitization. So this is a step they would take. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B: Instructing the client to picture each fearful image while maintaining a relaxed state. That sounds familiar. I remember that systematic desensitization often involves imagining the feared situations, so the client practices staying relaxed while visualizing. So B is a step they do, meaning it's not the exception.

Option C: Constructing a hierarchy of feared images. Yes, creating a hierarchy is a key part. The client ranks their fears from least to most anxiety-provoking. So C is definitely a step they take.

Option D: Helping the client experience relaxation through hypnosis. Hmm. I'm not sure about this. I know that relaxation training is part of systematic desensitization, but does it involve hypnosis? I thought the relaxation techniques are typically methods like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, etc., taught to the client without hypnosis. Hypnosis might be a separate technique. So D might be the exception.

Option E: Instructing the client to express feelings about each feared image. I'm not too certain. I think in systematic desensitization, the focus is more on the physical relaxation response rather than talking through emotions. Expressing feelings sounds more like a psychoanalytic approach or maybe cognitive-behavioral where you explore thoughts. So E might not be a step here, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps during the hierarchy construction, the client does talk about their feelings. Or maybe it's part of another therapy method. I'll need to think more on this.

Option F: Using exposure therapy to desensitize. Yes, systematic desensitization is a form of exposure therapy where the client is gradually exposed to the feared stimuli. So F is a step they take.

Option G: Using guided imagery to visualize confronting fears. Guided imagery would help the client imagine the feared situations, which aligns with what I remember about the technique. So G is a step they take.

So now, the question is which option is NOT a step. Let me recap:

The steps involved in systematic desensitization are:

1. Build a hierarchy of fears (C is correct).
2. Teach relaxation techniques (so options like B and possibly D relate here).
3. Exposure, either through imagery (B, G) or actual (A, F) situations.

Now, looking at D: Relaxation through hypnosis. I'm trying to remember if hypnosis is a typical part. I think the relaxation is taught without hypnosis. Hypnosis is a different approach. So D is not part of systematic desensitization.

Wait, another thought: Option E says "instructing the client to express their feelings about each feared image." I'm not sure if that's part of the process. Systematic desensitization is more about the behavioral aspect—reducing anxiety through relaxation and gradual exposure. Expressing feelings might be more of a cognitive approach or part of psychodynamic therapy. So E might not be a step either.

So now I'm a bit confused between D and E.

Wait, another angle: the question is about what is NOT a step. So which of these is not part of the process.

Systematic desensitization steps:

1. Client learns relaxation techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, etc.).
2. Construct hierarchy (C).
3. Using the hierarchy, client is exposed to each item, starting from least feared, while relaxed. This can be done through imagery (B, G) or in real life (A, F).

So, the steps are:

- Teach relaxation (but not necessarily through hypnosis).
- Create hierarchy.
- Exposure through imagery or real exposure, while relaxed.

So options A, B, C, F, G are all steps.

Option D: Hypnosis for relaxation. I don't think hypnosis is a standard part of systematic desensitization. So D is not a step.

Option E: Expressing feelings. I'm not sure. Does systematic desensitization involve discussing feelings? Or is it more about the physical relaxation and gradual exposure without necessarily talking about emotions? I think it's the latter. So E is also not a step.

But the question is asking for the exception, so which is the one not done. The options are D and E.

Wait, the question gives options A to G, and the correct answer is the one that's not a step. So which of D or E is not part of the process.

I think that expressing feelings (E) isn't a step in systematic desensitization. The therapy focuses on behavior—reducing the anxiety response through counterconditioning. So the client doesn't necessarily express their feelings about each image. That's more of a cognitive or psychodynamic approach.

Wait, but when constructing the hierarchy, the client might describe their fears and how they feel about them. So maybe E is part of that process, but perhaps not during the desensitization itself.

Alternatively, perhaps E is not part of systematic desensitization. So the steps don't involve expressing feelings about each image. So E is the exception.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall. Systematic desensitization primarily involves:

- Relaxation training
- Hierarchy construction
- Gradual exposure (imaginal or in vivo)

It does not involve hypnosis (D) or expressing feelings (E).

So the question is which is the exception.

Looking back at the options:

The question is which is NOT a step.

So, the possible exceptions are D and E.

But the options for the answer are A-J, so only one is correct.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT a step.

So, the correct answer is the option that is not part of systematic desensitization.

So, which of the options is not a part of it.

D: Hypnosis for relaxation. I don't think that's part of it. They teach relaxation without hypnosis.

E: Instructing to express feelings. I'm not sure, but perhaps not part of the standard steps.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D, because hypnosis isn't a standard part.

Alternatively, some sources might mention that relaxation can be taught through various methods, but I don't recall hypnosis being a standard approach in systematic desensitization. So D is not a step.

But then, what about E? Do they express feelings? I think systematic desensitization is more about the physical relaxation response and not about discussing emotions. So E is also not a step. But which of these is the correct exception.

Wait, the question asks which is NOT a step. So among the options, which is not done.

The options are A-G.

So, the correct answer is D: helping the client experience relaxation through hypnosis. Because systematic desensitization teaches relaxation without hypnosis. Hypnosis is a separate technique.

So the exception is D.

Wait, but another thought. Some therapies might use hypnosis for relaxation, but systematic desensitization traditionally doesn't. So D is the exception.

So, the answer is D.

Systematic desensitization is a behavior therapy technique used to treat phobias and anxiety disorders by gradually exposing the client to feared stimuli while teaching relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety. The key steps include constructing a hierarchy of feared images, teaching relaxation methods, and exposing the client to the feared stimuli through imagery or real-life situations.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Confronting the actual feared object or situation is part of in vivo exposure, a component of systematic desensitization. This is a valid step.  
- **B**: Instructing the client to picture fearful images while relaxed is a standard part of the process, using imaginal exposure. This is a valid step.  
- **C**: Constructing a hierarchy of feared images is a fundamental step in systematic desensitization. This is valid.  
- **D**: Helping the client experience relaxation through hypnosis is not a standard part of systematic desensitization. Relaxation is typically taught through methods like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, not hypnosis. This is not a valid step.  
- **E**: Instructing the client to express feelings about each feared image is more associated with cognitive or psychodynamic approaches and not a standard part of systematic desensitization, which focuses on behavioral counterconditioning. This is not a valid step.  
- **F**: Using exposure therapy to desensitize the client is a core component of systematic desensitization. This is valid.  
- **G**: Using guided imagery to visualize confronting fears aligns with the imaginal exposure aspect of the therapy. This is valid.  

Between **D** and **E**, **D** is the clearer exception because hypnosis is not traditionally used in systematic desensitization, whereas expressing feelings might occur indirectly during hierarchy construction. Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
