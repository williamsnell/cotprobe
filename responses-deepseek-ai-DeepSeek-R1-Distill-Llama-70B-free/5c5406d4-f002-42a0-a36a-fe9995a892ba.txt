Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem is about a rancher dropping hay bales from a plane. The plane is flying horizontally at 160 km/hr, which is pretty fast. The height from which the bales are dropped is 80 meters above the ground. The rancher wants the hay to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So the question is, how far behind the cattle should she push the bales out of the plane?

Hmm, I think this is a projectile motion problem. So, when the bales are dropped, they have two motions: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal motion is at the same speed as the plane since it's moving horizontally, right? And the vertical motion is just free fall under gravity.

Wait, but when you drop something from a moving plane, the horizontal velocity stays the same as the plane because there's no air resistance (assuming negligible air resistance). So, the bales will have a horizontal velocity of 160 km/h. Oh wait, but I should probably convert that into meters per second because the other units are in meters and seconds usually in physics.

Okay, how to convert 160 km/hr to m/s. I know that 1 km is 1000 meters and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 160 km/hr equals 160 * (1000/3600) m/s. Let me calculate that: 160 * (5/18) = (800/18) ≈ 44.444 m/s. So approximately 44.44 m/s horizontal velocity.

Now, the vertical motion is free fall. The bales are dropped from a height of 80 meters. I need to find the time it takes for the bales to hit the ground, because once I have that time, I can multiply it by the horizontal velocity to find how far they'll travel horizontally during that time.

The equation for vertical displacement under constant acceleration (gravity) is: y = (1/2) * g * t². Here, y is 80 meters, g is 9.8 m/s². So plugging in, 80 = 0.5 * 9.8 * t². Let me solve for t.

0.5 *9.8 is 4.9, so 80 = 4.9 * t². Dividing both sides by 4.9 gives t² = 80 /4.9. Let me compute that. 80 divided by 4.9 is approximately 16.3265. So t is the square root of that, which is about 4.04 seconds. So the time until impact is roughly 4 seconds.

Now, with the horizontal velocity being 44.44 m/s, the horizontal distance the bales travel during this time is velocity multiplied by time: 44.44 m/s * 4.04 s. Let me calculate that. 44.44 *4 is about 177.76, and 44.44 *0.04 is about 1.7776, so total is approximately 179.5376 meters. Wait, that's about 180 meters.

Wait, the problem says the bales should land 30 meters behind the cattle. So if the plane is directly above the cattle when the bales are dropped, they would land 180 meters behind. But she wants them to land 30 meters behind. So she needs to adjust where she drops them.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The plane is moving forward, and when she drops the bales, they have the same horizontal speed as the plane. So the bales will land 180 meters ahead of where they were dropped (from the plane's perspective). But wait, the rancher wants them to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So perhaps the cattle are stationary on the ground. So when the plane is at point A, the bales are dropped, and by the time they land, the plane has moved forward, but the bales have also moved forward. So the distance between the point directly below the plane when the bales are dropped and where the bales land is 180 meters. But she wants that point to be 30 meters behind the cattle.

Wait, no, maybe the setup is that when the plane drops the bales, the cattle are at a certain point. The bales need to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So she wants the bales to land at a point that's 30 meters behind where the cattle are when the bales are released.

Wait, perhaps the plane is flying towards the cattle, and at the moment of dropping, the plane is at a certain position relative to the cattle. The bales will land 30 meters behind the cattle. So the plane is ahead of the cattle, and the bales, after being dropped, will land 30 meters behind. So let me model this.

Imagine the cattle are at point C. The plane is flying towards point C, but the rancher wants the bales to land 30 meters behind C, at point L. So, the plane must be positioned such that when the bales are dropped, they land at L, which is 30 m behind C.

Wait, but no, perhaps more accurately: the plane is moving in a certain direction, and the cattle are at a point on the ground. When the bales are released, the bales will land at a point that's moving due to the plane's velocity. So the plane's position when releasing the bales must be such that the horizontal distance the bales travel during their fall equals the distance from the release point to the desired landing spot.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the bales will land 30 meters behind where the cattle are at the moment of release. So the plane is at position P when the bales are released. The bales will land at L, which is 30 meters behind the cattle's position C at that moment. So the horizontal distance from P to L is 30 meters? No, that can't be right, because the bales are moving forward as they fall.

Wait, perhaps the plane is moving towards the cattle. The cattle are at position C. The plane is at position P when the bales are released. The bales will land at L, which is 30 meters behind C. So the distance between P and L is the horizontal distance the bales travel during their fall. But wait, no. The bales have a horizontal velocity, so when the plane is at P, the bales, when dropped, will travel in the same direction as the plane's movement. So the point L is 30 meters behind C, which is perhaps the position of the cattle when the bales are released.

Wait, perhaps a diagram would help, but I can't draw, so I'll try to imagine it.

Let me think again. The plane is moving at 160 km/h (44.44 m/s) horizontally. The bales are dropped from 80 m height. They take 4.04 seconds to hit the ground. So, in those 4.04 seconds, the bales will move forward 44.44 * 4.04 ≈ 179.5 meters. So, approximately 180 meters.

If the rancher wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle, that means that when the bales are dropped, the cattle are 150 meters ahead of where the bales will land. Because when the bales land 180 meters from the release point, she wants that landing point to be 30 meters behind the cattle's position at release time.

Wait, no. Suppose the plane is at point A when the bales are released. The bales will land at point B, which is 180 meters ahead of A (same direction as the plane's movement). The cattle are at point C when the bales are released. The rancher wants B to be 30 meters behind C. So, the distance from A to C must be such that when the bales land 180 meters ahead of A, that point is 30 meters behind C.

So, perhaps point C is 150 meters ahead of point A, because when the bales land 180 meters from A, that would be 180 - 150 = 30 meters behind C.

Wait, let me model it. Let's say at time t=0, the plane is at A, the cattle at C. The bales are dropped and take 4.04 seconds to land at B, which is 180 m ahead of A.

The rancher wants B to be 30 meters behind C. So, the distance between A and C is such that when the bales land 180 m from A, that's 30 m behind C. So C is 180 m - 30 m = 150 m ahead of A. Or wait, perhaps the other way around.

Wait, no, the plane is moving towards the cattle. Let me think again.

If the plane is at A when the bales are released, and the bales land at B, which is 180 m ahead of A. The cattle are at C. The rancher wants B to be 30 m behind C. So, when the bales land at B, that should be 30 m behind where the cattle were at t=0 (assuming the cattle are stationary).

So, if at t=0, C is at position x=0. Then, B must be at x = -30 m (if behind), but that can't be because the plane is moving forward. Wait, perhaps this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the plane is moving in the positive x-direction. Let me assign coordinates: Let the position where the plane drops the bales be x=0 at t=0. The bales will land at x=180 m (because 44.44 *4.04 ≈ 179.5 ~180 m) at t=4.04 s.

The rancher wants the bales to land at x =30 m behind the cattle, so perhaps the cattle are at x=210 m when the bales are released. Because when the bales land at 180 m, that's 30 m behind the cattle's position (210 m). Wait, no, that can't be right because 180 is behind 210.

Wait, no. If the bales land at x=180 m, and the rancher wants that to be 30 m behind the cattle, then the cattle must be at x=180 m +30 m =210 m at the time the bales are released. Because the bales land 30 m behind where the cattle were when the bales were dropped.

Wait, but then the plane is at x=0 when the bales are dropped. The bales land at x=180 m. The cattle are at x=210 m when the bales are dropped. So the plane needs to be 210 m behind the cattle when the bales are released.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because if the plane is at x=0, and the cattle are at x=210 m, then the plane is 210 m behind the cattle. But when the bales land at x=180 m, that's 30 m behind the cattle's position at x=210 m. So yes, that makes sense.

So the question is, how far behind the cattle should the rancher drop the bales? Wait, no. The question says, how far behind the cattle should she push the bales out. So she needs to drop the bales when the plane is at a point that is a certain distance behind the cattle.

Wait, if the plane is at x=0 when the bales are dropped, and the cattle are at x=210 m, then the plane is 210 m behind the cattle. So she should drop the bales when the plane is 210 m behind the cattle, so that when the bales land 180 m ahead of the plane's position, they land at 180 m, which is 30 m behind the cattle's position (210 m). So the answer would be 210 m behind.

Wait, but wait: the bales' landing point is 180 m from where they were dropped. So when the plane drops the bales at position P, the bales land at P + 180 m. She wants P +180 m to be 30 m behind the cattle's position at the time of drop, which is C. So C is at C = P +180 m +30 m = P +210 m. So P is C minus 210 m. So the plane must be 210 m behind the cattle when the bales are dropped.

So the correct answer would be 210 meters behind the cattle. Let me check the options. Option D is 210 m. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I'm not getting confused. Let me rephrase this.

The distance the bales travel horizontally is 180 m. The rancher wants this distance to be such that the landing point is 30 m behind the cattle. So when the bales are dropped, the plane is at point P, and the bales land at P +180 m. The rancher wants P +180 m = C -30 m, where C is the position of the cattle when the bales are dropped. So solving for P, P = C -30 m -180 m = C -210 m. So the plane must be 210 m behind the cattle when the bales are dropped.

So the answer is D: 210 m.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the hay bales as a projectile motion problem. The bales are dropped from a height of 80 m with a horizontal velocity equal to the plane's velocity, which is 160 km/h. Converting this velocity to meters per second:

\[
v_x = 160 \, \text{km/h} = \frac{160 \times 1000}{3600} \approx 44.44 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The time it takes for the bales to hit the ground is determined by the vertical motion. Using the equation for vertical displacement under gravity:

\[
y = \frac{1}{2} g t^2,
\]

where \( y = 80 \, \text{m} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we solve for \( t \):

\[
80 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.8 \cdot t^2 \implies t^2 = \frac{80}{4.9} \approx 16.3265 \implies t \approx 4.04 \, \text{s}.
\]

The horizontal distance traveled by the bales during this time is:

\[
x = v_x \cdot t = 44.44 \cdot 4.04 \approx 179.5 \, \text{m}.
\]

The rancher wants the bales to land 30 m behind the cattle. This means the bales must land 30 m behind the cattle's position at the moment of release. Since the bales travel approximately 180 m horizontally, the plane must be positioned such that the bales' landing point is 30 m behind the cattle. Therefore, the plane must be 210 m behind the cattle when the bales are dropped:

\[
\text{Distance behind} = 180 \, \text{m} + 30 \, \text{m} = 210 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 210 m.**
