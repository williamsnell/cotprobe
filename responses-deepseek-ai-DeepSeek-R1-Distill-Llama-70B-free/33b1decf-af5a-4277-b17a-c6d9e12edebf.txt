Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following memoir.
Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: "I do not know him"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, "He is a man I never see"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.
No one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.
He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.
â€”Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the bias in this document written by Duke Saint-Simon about Louis XIV. The question is asking which option best explains the bias in the memoir. Let me break it down.

First, I'll read the passage again to get a sense of the tone and content. The Duke describes Louis XIV as someone who expected constant attendance at court, noticed absences, and was displeased with those who didn't show up often. He also mentions that Louis XIV would withhold favors from those who didn't attend, saying things like "I do not know him." The Duke points out that Louis XIV used splendor and encouraged expensive habits to keep the courtiers in debt and dependent on him. 

So, the Duke is detailing how Louis XIV controlled the nobility by making them financially dependent. He seems to explain the king's methods in a way that shows he understands the political motives behind them, like reducing the nobility's power by making them reliant on the king's generosity.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the Duke is biased in favor of the king because of the policy to increase the central state's power. But the passage doesn't seem to show the Duke supporting this; he's more explaining how it's done, not necessarily agreeing with it.

Option B suggests the Duke is indifferent, but the detailed account implies he's not indifferent; he's critical of the methods.

Option C states the Duke supports the policies to keep nobility in debt. But the text doesn't show support; it's more of a descriptive analysis, possibly with a critical undertone.

Option D claims impartiality, but as a noble himself, it's unlikely he's completely objective. The detailed description might indicate a perspective.

Option E says the Duke is sympathetic to Louis XIV. The text doesn't show sympathy; it's more about the mechanisms of control.

Option F suggests disapproval of Louis's extravagance. The passage does talk about encouraging expensive habits, but the Duke's tone doesn't clearly express disapproval; he's more explaining the reasons behind it.

Option G is about supporting the central state's control. The Duke explains Louis's methods but doesn't express support for them.

Option H says the Duke supported preserving the aristocracy's social position while removing their power. The passage shows Louis taking away their power by making them dependent, but the Duke might be critical of this.

Option I states the Duke is biased against the king because of suppression of the nobility. The details in the passage do suggest that Louis XIV was controlling and suppressing the nobility's independence, which might mean the Duke disapproves of this.

Wait, so the Duke is part of the nobility. If Louis XIV's policies were making the nobles dependent and taking away their power, the Duke might be biased against the king because it affects his own class negatively. The passage shows how Louis's methods kept the nobles in check, which could be seen as a critique from someone in the nobility.

So, looking at the options again, option I says the Duke is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility. That makes sense because the Duke is explaining how Louis XIV manipulated and controlled the nobles, which would likely be from a critical perspective.

Alternatively, option F is about disapproving of extravagance, but the main issue seems more about control over the nobility rather than just spending habits.

So I think the best answer is I.

The passage by Duke Saint-Simon describes Louis XIV's methods of controlling the nobility by making them financially dependent on him. The Duke explains how the king encouraged extravagant spending to keep courtiers in debt and reliant on his favors, which undermined their independence. The Duke's detailed account suggests a critical perspective, likely reflecting his own position as a member of the nobility affected by these policies. This indicates a bias against the king due to his suppression of the nobility's autonomy.
