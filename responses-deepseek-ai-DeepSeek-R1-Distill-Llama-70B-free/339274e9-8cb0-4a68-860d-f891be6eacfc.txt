Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a curling stone. Hmm, curling, that's the sport with the stones on ice, right? So the problem says the stone has a mass of 1 slug. Wait, mass is usually in kilograms or grams, but here it's slugs. Oh right, in the imperial system, mass is sometimes given in slugs. I remember that 1 slug is about 14.59 kilograms. But I might not need the exact conversion right now.

The stone is sent off along the ice and comes to rest after 100 feet. Oh, so it slides 100 feet before stopping. The force of kinetic friction is given as 1/2 lb. Wait, I think friction is a force, so in pounds here. But when doing physics calculations, I probably need to convert that to consistent units. Since the mass is given in slugs, which is part of the English engineering system, I should probably use that.

So the problem is asking for the initial velocity and the time it took to come to rest. The options are A through J, each with different velocity and time pairs. I need to figure out which one is correct.

I remember that when a force is applied, acceleration can be found using Newton's second law, F=ma. So the friction here is the force causing deceleration. So first, I should find the acceleration (or in this case, deceleration) caused by friction.

Wait, the frictional force is 1/2 lb. Mass is 1 slug. So F = 1/2 lb, m = 1 slug. Then a = F/m = (1/2) lb / 1 slug. But wait, in the English system, acceleration is in feet per second squared. So I think the formula accounts for pounds being units of force. So a = (1/2) ft/s²? Or maybe I'm missing a conversion factor.

Wait, no, wait. Because F = ma, but in the English system, the unit of force (lb) is already considering the mass in slugs and acceleration in ft/s². So a = F/m. So yes, a = (1/2) lb / 1 slug. Since 1 slug is the mass that accelerates at 1 ft/s² when a force of 1 lb is applied. So a would be (1/2) ft/s². But since it's friction opposing motion, the acceleration is negative. So a = -1/2 ft/s².

Now, the stone comes to rest, so final velocity v = 0. The initial velocity is what we're looking for. I think I can use one of the kinematic equations. The equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, distance, and acceleration is v² = u² + 2 a s. Because when acceleration is constant, this equation applies.

Here, v is 0, u is the initial velocity (what we need to find), a is -1/2 ft/s², and s is 100 ft.

Plugging the numbers in:

0 = u² + 2*(-1/2)*100

Simplify that:

0 = u² - (2*(1/2)*100)
0 = u² - 100

Wait, because 2*(1/2) is 1, so 1*100 is 100. So u² = 100, so u = 10 ft/s. Oh, so the initial velocity is 10 ft/s.

Wait, but let me check the signs. Since the acceleration is negative (decelerating), the term 2 a s would be negative. So yeah, the equation becomes u² = 100, so u is 10 ft/s. So initial velocity is 10 ft/s.

Now, the second part is the time it took to come to rest. So I need to find the time when v=0. The equation for velocity is v = u + a*t. We can solve for t.

v is 0, u is 10 ft/s, a is -1/2 ft/s².

So 0 = 10 + (-1/2)*t

=> (1/2) * t = 10

=> t = 10 * 2 = 20 seconds.

So the time is 20 seconds, and the initial velocity is 10 ft/s.

Looking at the options, option A is initial velocity 10 ft/s and time 20 s. So answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might mix up the equations.

Wait, another way to find the time: using the equations of motion. The stone starts at u=10, comes to rest at v=0, with a=-0.5 ft/s².

Another kinematic equation could be v = u + a*t. So yeah, same as before, t= (v - u)/a. So (0-10)/( -0.5 )= (-10)/(-0.5) = 20 s. That's correct.

Alternatively, average velocity: Since the acceleration is constant, the average velocity is (u + v)/2 = (10 +0)/2 =5 ft/s. The distance is 100 ft. So time is distance divided by average speed: 100 ft /5 ft/s =20 s. So same result.

So the initial velocity is 10 ft/s, time is 20 s. Which is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the motion of the curling stone. The stone has a mass of 1 slug and is acted upon by a kinetic frictional force of \( F = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{lb} \). Using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), the acceleration (or deceleration) caused by friction is:

\[
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \, \text{lb}}{1 \, \text{slug}} = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

Since the friction opposes motion, the acceleration is negative: \( a = -\frac{1}{2} \, \text{ft/s}^2 \).

Next, we use the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \) to find the initial velocity \( u \). Here, the final velocity \( v = 0 \), the acceleration \( a = -\frac{1}{2} \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), and the distance \( s = 100 \, \text{ft} \). Substituting these values:

\[
0 = u^2 + 2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(100)
\]

\[
0 = u^2 - 100
\]

\[
u^2 = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad u = 10 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Thus, the initial velocity is \( 10 \, \text{ft/s} \).

To find the time it takes for the stone to come to rest, we use the equation \( v = u + at \). Substituting \( v = 0 \), \( u = 10 \, \text{ft/s} \), and \( a = -\frac{1}{2} \, \text{ft/s}^2 \):

\[
0 = 10 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)t
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2}t = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 20 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the stone to come to rest is \( 20 \, \text{seconds} \).

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: Initial velocity: 10 ft/s, Time of motion: 20 s**
