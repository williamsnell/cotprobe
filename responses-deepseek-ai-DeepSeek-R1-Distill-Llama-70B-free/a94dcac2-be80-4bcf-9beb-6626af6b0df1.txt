Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about snail colors and selection types. Let's see what I remember.

The question says that a species of land snail can be either cream-colored or solid brown. Intermediate individuals are rare. So the population isn't showing a lot of variation in between; it's more like two distinct groups.

Hmm, I think this has to do with natural selection and the types of selection pressures. I remember there are a few types like stabilizing, directional, disruptive, and balancing selection.

Stabilizing selection is when extreme traits are selected against, so the population ends up with more average traits. That would probably lead to most individuals being similar, but I don't think that's what's happening here because the snails are at the extremes—cream and brown.

Directional selection is when one extreme is favored, so the population shifts towards that trait. Like if only the brown snails survive better, the population becomes more brown over time. But in this case, both cream and brown exist, so maybe it's not directional because that would push it all in one direction.

Disruptive selection is when both extremes are favored and the intermediate is selected against. So if being cream or brown is better than being in the middle, that could explain why intermediates are rare. The population splits into two distinct forms because those are more fit.

Balancing selection, like heterozygote advantage, maintains variation. So if having two different alleles is better, the population keeps both. But the snails here are either cream or brown, which might be two different phenotypes, but I'm not sure if that's balancing. Also, the question doesn't mention anything about heterozygotes or maintaining variation over time, just that intermediates are rare.

So putting it together, if the population has two distinct forms and the intermediates are rare, it suggests that both extremes are favored. That would be disruptive selection, because it's driving the population apart into two groups. So the correct term should be disruptive selection.

The question describes a species of land snail with two distinct color morphs—cream and solid brown—with intermediate individuals being rare. This scenario suggests that both extreme traits (cream and brown) are favored over the intermediate forms, leading to a split in the population into two distinct groups. This type of selection, where both extremes are favored and intermediates are selected against, is known as disruptive selection.

- **Stabilizing selection** can be ruled out because it favors average traits, which would not result in two distinct groups.
- **Directional selection** is also incorrect because it would shift the population toward one extreme, not maintain two distinct forms.
- **Balancing selection** is not applicable here because it typically involves maintaining variation within a population, often through heterozygote advantage, which is not described in the question.
- **Disruptive selection** fits the scenario because it explains the favoring of extreme traits and the rarity of intermediates.

Thus, the correct term for this phenomenon is **disruptive selection**.
