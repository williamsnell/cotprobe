Okay, so I have this question about the angular momentum of Hurricane Florence when it hit land. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating, and it depends on factors like mass, size, and rotation speed.

Wait, angular momentum L is calculated as I * ω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity. For a solid sphere, I think I is (2/5)MR², but hurricanes aren't solid. Maybe I should model it as a cylinder or a disk? Or perhaps it's better to think about the distribution of mass. Oh, but maybe there's a simpler approach here.

I recall that hurricanes are large-scale rotating systems. They form over warm ocean waters, and their rotation comes from the Coriolis effect. The size of a hurricane can vary, but Florence was a pretty big storm. Let me think about the typical dimensions. Maybe the radius is on the order of hundreds of kilometers. Let's say roughly 500 km, which is 5e5 meters. But wait, maybe that's the outer edge. The eye is much smaller, but the mass is distributed over a larger area.

The mass of the hurricane would be the volume of air it covers times the density. Air density is about 1 kg/m³. So volume is πr²h, but I'm not sure about the height. Maybe assume it's about 10 km high, so 1e4 meters. Wait, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps considering the mass as the area times some average height. Let's say 5e5 m radius, area is π*(5e5)^2 ≈ 8e11 m². If the depth is, say, 10 km (1e4 m), then volume is 8e15 m³. With air density ~1 kg/m³, mass M would be around 8e15 kg. That seems really high, maybe I messed up the numbers.

Wait, maybe the hurricane's mass isn't that large. Wait, no, wait, that calculation gives 8e15 kg, which is 8e15 kg. Does that make sense? Let me think again. The area of a hurricane is maybe 1000 km in diameter, so radius 500 km. Area is π*(5e5)^2 = π*2.5e11 = approx 7.85e11 m². If the height is 10 km, that's 1e4 m. So volume is 7.85e11 * 1e4 = 7.85e15 m³. Multiply by air density (1 kg/m³) gives 7.85e15 kg. Hmm, that's a lot, but maybe that's correct?

Wait, but I think hurricanes have a lot of mass. For example, I remember that a typical hurricane might have a mass around 1e16 kg, so maybe 1e16 kg. Let's go with M = 1e16 kg for estimation.

Now, angular velocity ω. Hurricanes rotate due to the Coriolis effect, and their wind speeds are maybe around 50 m/s. Wait, but what's the angular velocity? Let's think about the period. If the wind speed is v at the radius r, then v = ω * r. So ω = v / r.

Assuming the maximum wind speed is about 50 m/s (which is roughly 180 km/h, which is category 3 maybe), and radius r is 5e5 meters. So ω = 50 / 5e5 = 1e-4 rad/s. Wait, but that's a very slow angular velocity. Alternatively, perhaps the radius is smaller. Maybe the radius where the maximum wind occurs is about 50 km, which is 5e4 meters. Then ω = 50/(5e4) = 1e-3 rad/s.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. I remember that the angular momentum of a hurricane is comparable to that of a small planet. Or wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value I've heard before. I think that large hurricanes have angular momenta around 1e20 to 1e22 kg m²/s.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to compute it step by step.

So, using the formula L = I * ω.

Assuming the hurricane can be approximated as a solid cylinder for simplicity. The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder is (1/2)MR². So I = (1/2)MR².

But wait, earlier I thought M is ~1e16 kg, R is 5e5 meters. So I = 0.5 * 1e16 * (5e5)^2.

Calculating that: (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11. So 0.5 * 1e16 * 2.5e11 = 0.5 * 2.5e27 = 1.25e27 kg m².

Now, ω is v/R. Let's say v is 50 m/s, R is 5e5 m. So ω = 50/(5e5) = 1e-4 rad/s.

So L = I * ω = 1.25e27 * 1e-4 = 1.25e23 kg m²/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1e23. So that would be close. But wait, my M might be an overestimate. Earlier, I thought M was ~1e16 kg, but perhaps it's less. Let's say 1e15 kg. Then I would be 0.5 * 1e15 * (5e5)^2 = 0.5 * 1e15 * 2.5e11 = 1.25e26. Multiply by ω of 1e-4 gives 1.25e22, which is option F.

Alternatively, maybe the radius is larger. If R is 1e6 meters (1000 km), then (1e6)^2 is 1e12. So I = 0.5 * 1e16 * 1e12 = 5e27. ω would be 50/(1e6) = 5e-5 rad/s. So L = 5e27 * 5e-5 = 2.5e23, which is close to 1e23 again.

Hmm, but I'm not confident about the exact values. Another approach: think of the formula for angular momentum of a rotating body. If the entire mass is at radius R, then I = MR² and ω = v/R, so L = MR²*(v/R) = M R v.

Wait, that's a different approach. So L = M R v.

So if M is 1e16 kg, R is 5e5 m, v is 50 m/s, then L = 1e16 *5e5 *50 = 1e16 * 2.5e7 = 2.5e23, which is 2.5e23, so 1e23 is close. So that would be option A.

But wait, another thought: maybe the actual wind speed is higher. If it's 100 m/s, then L would be 5e23, which is 5e23, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the mass is 1e17 kg, R 5e5 m, v 50 m/s: L=1e17 *5e5 *50=2.5e23, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular momentum is around 1e22. Let me think about another way. I remember that the Earth's angular momentum is about 7e33 kg m²/s, which is much larger. But for a hurricane, which is much smaller, so the options given are from 1e16 to 1e25.

Wait, another approach: the formula for angular momentum can also be written as L = (Mass) * (Radius)^2 * (Angular Velocity). Alternatively, using L = (1/2) M R² ω, as I did earlier.

Maybe I should look for some reference. I vaguely remember that hurricanes have angular momenta on the order of 1e20 to 1e22 kg m²/s. So perhaps the correct answer is 1e22, which is option H.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave me around 1e23. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using different parameters. Let me try with M = 1e15 kg, R = 5e5 m, v = 50 m/s.

Then L = M * R * v = 1e15 *5e5 *50 = 2.5e21, which is 2.5e21. So that would be closest to option E, which is 1e18? No, wait E is 1e18. Oh wait, option H is 1e21, which is 1e21. So 2.5e21 is closer to 1e21 than 1e22. So option H would be 1e21.

Wait, but if M is 1e16 kg, then L = 1e16 *5e5 *50 = 2.5e22. Which is 2.5e22, which is closer to 1e22 (option F is 1e22? Wait, no, let me check the options. The options are:

A:1e23,

B:1e19,

C:1e17,

D:1e25,

E:1e18,

F:1e22,

G:1e16,

H:1e21,

I:1e24,

J:1e20.

So if I have 2.5e22, that's closest to 1e22 (option F) or 1e23 (option A). 2.5e22 is between 1e22 and 1e23. So maybe the intended answer is 1e22, but my initial calculation with M=1e16 gives that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is 1e17 kg. Then L =1e17 *5e5 *50 = 2.5e23, which is 2.5e23, so option A would be 1e23.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. I think I should go with the calculation that gives around 1e22 to 1e23.

Another thought: perhaps the angular momentum of a hurricane is similar to that of a tornado, but much larger. Wait, no, a hurricane is way bigger. Tornadoes might have L around 1e5 to 1e6 kg m²/s, but hurricanes are much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the rotational energy. The kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω². But that might not help directly.

Wait, maybe I can find an approximate value. I think that the angular momentum of a hurricane is on the order of 1e22 kg m²/s. So looking at the options, option F is 1e22.

But earlier, with M=1e16, R=5e5, v=50, I get L=2.5e22, which would be option F (1e22) if rounded down, or maybe option A (1e23) if I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the radius used in the formula is the radius of maximum wind, which is smaller than the total radius. Let's say R is 1e5 m (100 km). Then with M=1e16 kg, v=50 m/s:

L=1e16 *1e5 *50 = 5e21, which is 5e21, closer to option H (1e21) or option F (1e22). 5e21 is 5 times 1e21, so maybe it's better to round to 1e22.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Given the options, and my calculations hovering around 1e22 to 1e23, perhaps the intended answer is 1e22, which is option F.

Wait no, wait. Another approach: the moment of inertia for a continuous distribution. For a solid sphere, I=(2/5)MR². But a hurricane is more like a hollow cylinder, maybe. The moment of inertia for a thin ring is MR². So if I model the hurricane as a ring with most of its mass at radius R, then I=MR².

So L=Iω=MR²*(v/R) )= M R v.

So same as before: L= M R v.

If M is 1e16 kg, R=5e5 m, v=50 m/s,

L=1e16 *5e5 *50 = 2.5e22 kg m²/s.

Which is 2.5e22. The options are A:1e23, F:1e22.

So 2.5e22 is 2.5 times 1e22, so closer to 1e22 than 1e23.

Therefore, the correct answer would be F:1e22.

Wait, but looking back, option F is 1e22? Let me check the options again.

Yes, option F is 1e22. So the answer would be F.

To estimate the angular momentum of Hurricane Florence when it hit land, we use the formula for angular momentum:

\[
L = I \cdot \omega
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. For a large-scale system like a hurricane, we approximate it as a rotating cylinder or ring, where \( I = M R^2 \) (for a ring) or \( I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \) (for a solid cylinder). The angular velocity \( \omega \) can be expressed as \( \omega = \frac{v}{R} \), where \( v \) is the wind speed and \( R \) is the radius of the hurricane.

### Key Parameters:
1. **Mass (\( M \))**: The mass of a hurricane is determined by the volume of air it covers and the air density. Assuming a radius \( R \approx 500 \, \text{km} = 5 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \), height \( h \approx 10 \, \text{km} = 10^4 \, \text{m} \), and air density \( \rho \approx 1 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), the volume is approximately \( V = \pi R^2 h \). This gives a mass \( M \approx 1 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg} \).

2. **Wind Speed (\( v \))**: Typical maximum wind speeds for a hurricane are around \( 50 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Angular Velocity (\( \omega \))**: Using \( \omega = \frac{v}{R} \), with \( v = 50 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( R = 5 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \), we find \( \omega \approx 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{rad/s} \).

4. **Moment of Inertia (\( I \))**: Assuming the hurricane is approximated as a ring, \( I = M R^2 \). Substituting \( M = 1 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg} \) and \( R = 5 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \), we get \( I \approx 1.25 \times 10^{27} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \).

### Angular Momentum (\( L \)):
Substituting \( I \) and \( \omega \) into \( L = I \cdot \omega \), we find:

\[
L = (1.25 \times 10^{27}) \cdot (1 \times 10^{-4}) = 1.25 \times 10^{23} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}.
\]

This value is close to \( 1 \times 10^{23} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s} \), which corresponds to **option A**. However, if the mass or radius is slightly overestimated, the angular momentum could be closer to \( 1 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s} \), corresponding to **option F**.

Given the approximations and the range of possible values, the most reasonable choice is **option F: \( L = 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}**.
