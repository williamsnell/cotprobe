Okay, so I have this question about Arnold Gesell and his significance in the history of school psychology. I'm a bit rusty on my educational psychology history, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that Gesell was an American psychologist. I think he worked a lot with children, maybe in developmental psychology. I recall something about him studying child development and maybe creating some assessments or scales.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Developed the first standardized test for elementary school children. I'm not sure about this. I think the first standardized tests might have been created by someone else, maybe Binet or Terman? Or perhaps Gesell did something else.

Option B: Introduced emotional intelligence. I don't think that's Gesell. Emotional intelligence became more popular with Goleman later on, so probably not B.

Option C: Created a classification system for learning disabilities. I don't remember Gesell being associated with that. Maybe that's more recent or someone else.

Option D: Developed a version of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) for children. The TAT was created by Murray, I think, and maybe others adapted it, but not sure if Gesell did that.

Option E: Identified four major periods of cognitive development. Wait, that sounds like Piaget with his stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, formal operational. So E is probably Piaget, not Gesell.

Option F: Advocated for inclusion of special needs students. I'm not sure, but I think inclusion movements came later, maybe in the 70s or 80s. Gesell was earlier, I think.

Option G: Established ethical standards for NASP. I don't remember Gesell being associated with that. Maybe someone else, like maybe the founders of NASP?

Option H: Pioneered psychoanalysis in schools. Psychoanalysis is Freudian, and I don't think Gesell was a psychoanalyst. He was more about developmental stages.

Option I: Devised a normative assessment for infants and young children. This rings a bell. I think Gesell created some kind of developmental schedules or assessments for young kids, maybe like milestones or something.

Option J: Established the first school psychology graduate program. I'm not certain about this. I think school psychology as a field started to take shape in the early 20th century, and Gesell might have been involved in training, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Lightner Witmer or someone else started the first program.

Wait, Gesell's work: I remember he focused on maturation and developmental stages. He believed that children develop in a predictable order based on maturation. He also did work in school readiness and perhaps assessments to determine if a child was ready for school.

So looking back, Option I says he devised a prototypical normative assessment for infants and young children. That sounds right because I think he developed the Gesell Developmental Schedules, which assess various aspects of a child's development, like motor skills, language, etc., to determine their developmental age.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be I.

Arnold Gesell is best known for his work in developmental psychology, particularly his focus on the maturation and predictable stages of child development. He developed the Gesell Developmental Schedules, which were used to assess infants and young children, focusing on milestones like motor skills and language development. This aligns with Option I, which describes a prototypical normative assessment for this age group.

Answer: I
