Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a cannon mounted on a truck. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the angle at which the cannon should be pointed so that the ball goes as far as possible before hitting the ground. I remember that in projectile motion, the range depends on the angle of launch.

Wait, the truck is moving forward at 5 m/s. Oh right, because the cannon is on the truck, the ball's velocity will have a horizontal component from both the truck's movement and the cannon's muzzle velocity. So the total initial horizontal velocity of the ball is the sum of these two, right?

Wait, no, wait. No, the muzzle velocity is 50 m/s. But that's the speed at which the cannon launches the ball relative to the truck. So the truck is moving at 5 m/s, and when the cannon fires, it's adding to that. So the ball's actual velocity is the vector sum of the truck's velocity and the cannon's muzzle velocity.

Wait, no, no. If the truck is moving forward at 5 m/s, then the cannon, which is on the truck, is also moving at 5 m/s. So when the cannon fires the ball, the ball's velocity is the vector sum of the truck's velocity and the muzzle velocity. Oh wait, but the muzzle velocity is given as 50 m/s. So the muzzle velocity is the speed of the ball relative to the truck. So the actual initial velocity of the ball is the truck's velocity plus the muzzle velocity components.

Right, so the ball's initial velocity has two components: horizontal and vertical. But since the truck is moving forward, the horizontal component of the ball's velocity is the sum of the truck's speed and the horizontal component from the cannon.

Wait, no, wait. No, the truck's velocity is 5 m/s forward. The cannon is mounted on the truck, so when it fires, the ball's velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of the truck's velocity (vx =5 m/s) and the cannon's muzzle velocity components. So, the muzzle velocity is 50 m/s at an angle θ from the horizontal. So the horizontal component from the cannon is 50 cosθ, and the vertical is 50 sinθ.

So the total horizontal velocity of the ball relative to the ground is 5 + 50 cosθ, and the vertical component is 50 sinθ.

But wait, when the ball is fired from the cannon, does the truck's velocity add to the horizontal component of the cannon's muzzle velocity? Because the truck is moving forward, and the cannon is on the truck, so the direction the cannon is firing is relative to the truck. So if the cannon is pointed at an angle θ above the horizontal (relative to the truck), then the ball's horizontal velocity relative to the ground would be the truck's velocity plus the horizontal component of the muzzle velocity.

So the total horizontal velocity is vx = 5 + 50 cosθ, and the vertical is vy = 50 sinθ.

Wait, but projectile motion equations for range usually assume no air resistance and that the ground is level. The range formula for a projectile launched from ground level is (v^2 sin(2θ)) / g, where v is the initial speed. But in this case, the initial velocity has both x and y components, and it's not launched from ground level but from the same level as where it will land.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says the ball should go as far as possible before hitting the level surface. So the starting point and landing point are at the same vertical level, which is the usual case for the range formula.

But in this case, the initial velocity has a horizontal component that's the sum of the truck's speed and the cannon's horizontal component.

Wait, but the truck's speed is in the same direction as the cannon's horizontal component. So, the initial velocity in the x-direction is (5 + 50 cosθ), and the y-direction is 50 sinθ.

So the time of flight is determined by the vertical motion. The vertical component is 50 sinθ. The time to reach the maximum height is (50 sinθ)/g, and the total time of flight is twice that, so T = 2*(50 sinθ)/g.

But wait, actually, the time of flight when starting and ending at same height is T = (2 vy)/g, where vy is the initial vertical velocity. So yes, T = (2 * 50 sinθ)/g.

The horizontal distance is the horizontal velocity multiplied by the time of flight. So R = vx * T.

So substituting, R = (5 + 50 cosθ) * (2 *50 sinθ)/g.

Wait, but wait, that's more complicated than the usual range formula. Because normally, R = (v^2 sin(2θ))/g, but that's when vx is just v cosθ, and vy is v sinθ. So when the initial vx is just 50 cosθ, then R would be (50^2 sin(2θ))/g. But in this case, the vx is 5 + 50 cosθ.

So R = [5 + 50 cosθ] * [ (2 *50 sinθ) / g ]

So R = [5 + 50 cosθ] * (100 sinθ) / g.

Wait, that's a bit more complex. So to find the maximum range, we need to find the angle θ that maximizes R.

Hmm, how do I maximize R with respect to θ?

Let me express R as a function of θ:

R(θ) = [5 + 50 cosθ] * (100 sinθ) / g.

Wait, but to maximize R, perhaps I can consider it as a function of θ and take the derivative with respect to θ, set it to zero, and solve for θ.

Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify this expression.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out the constants. Let me write R as:

R = (100 / g) * (5 + 50 cosθ) * sinθ.

Hmmm. Let me expand this:

R = (100 / g) * [5 sinθ + 50 sinθ cosθ ].

Which is (100/g) [5 sinθ + 25 * 2 sinθ cosθ ].

Wait, 50 sinθ cosθ is 25 * 2 sinθ cosθ = 25 sin(2θ).

So, R = (100/g) [5 sinθ + 25 sin(2θ) ].

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's easier to treat this as a calculus problem.

Let me let f(θ) = [5 + 50 cosθ] * sinθ.

We need to find θ where f(θ) is maximum. Because the 100/g is a constant factor, maximizing f(θ) will maximize R.

So f(θ) = (5 +50 cosθ) sinθ.

Let me compute the derivative f’(θ):

f’(θ) = d/dθ [5 sinθ +50 sinθ cosθ ]

= 5 cosθ + 50 [cos^2θ - sin^2θ ].

Wait, because the derivative of sinθ cosθ is cos^2θ - sin^2θ.

Wait, wait no. Wait, the product rule for sinθ * cosθ is cosθ * cosθ + sinθ * (-sinθ) )= cos²θ - sin²θ.

So f’(θ) = 5 cosθ + 50 (cos²θ - sin²θ).

Set this equal to zero for maximum.

So 5 cosθ + 50 (cos²θ - sin²θ) = 0.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Divide both sides by 5:

cosθ + 10 (cos²θ - sin²θ) = 0.

Hmm, I know that cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ), so:

cosθ +10 cos(2θ) = 0.

So the equation becomes cosθ +10 cos(2θ) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe we can express cos(2θ) in terms of cosθ.

We know that cos(2θ) = 2 cos²θ -1.

So substituting:

cosθ +10 (2 cos²θ -1 ) = 0.

Which is cosθ +20 cos²θ -10 =0.

Rearranging:

20 cos²θ + cosθ -10 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of cosθ.

Let me let x = cosθ.

So 20 x² +x -10 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a)

a=20, b=1, c=-10.

Discriminant D=1² -4*20*(-10)= 1 +800=801.

So x = [ -1 ± sqrt(801) ]/(40).

sqrt(801) is approximately 28.3.

So x = (-1 +28.3)/40 ≈ 27.3/40 ≈ 0.6825.

Or x= (-1 -28.3)/40 ≈ -29.3/40 ≈ -0.7325.

Since x is cosθ, it must be between -1 and 1. Both solutions are valid, but we need to consider the physical angle where the derivative is zero between 0 and 90 degrees, perhaps.

So the relevant solution is x ≈0.6825.

So cosθ ≈ 0.6825.

Taking arccos, θ ≈ 47 degrees.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

cosθ ≈0.6825.

Let me see, cos(45 degrees)= ~0.707, cos(50)= ~0.6428.

Wait, 0.6825 is between 45 and 50 degrees.

Wait, let's compute it:

cos(47°)= approximately 0.6820.

Yes, because cos(45)= 0.7071, cos(50)=0.6428.

Wait, 47 degrees: cos(47)= approx 0.68199836.

So that's very close to 0.6825. So θ is approximately 47 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the options given are:

A:35°, B:70°, C:45°, D:90°, E:60°, F:80°, G:5°, H:49°, I:30°, J:41°.

So the closest option to 47 is H:49°, or perhaps C:45°, or J:41°. But wait, wait, maybe my approximation was a bit off. Let me think again.

Wait, let me compute the calculation more precisely.

The quadratic equation is 20x² +x -10=0.

x = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 +800) ] /40.

sqrt(801)= approximately 28.30.

So x= (-1+28.30)/40=27.30/40=0.6825.

So cosθ=0.6825.

Let me calculate the angle.

I can use a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll approximate.

cos(45)=0.7071.

cos(50)=0.6428.

So 0.6825 is between 45 and 50.

Let me compute the difference.

At 45°, 0.7071.

At 47°, let me think: cos(47)=?

Using a calculator (if I had one), but alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for small angles.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that the angle is approximately 47 degrees, but the closest option is H:49°, which is 49 degrees.

But let me think again: perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, in the initial setup, I considered that the horizontal component of the ball's velocity is 5 +50 cosθ. But perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, wait, the truck is moving at 5 m/s, and the cannon's muzzle velocity is 50 m/s at angle θ relative to the truck's direction. So the ball's velocity relative to the ground is (5 +50 cosθ) in x, and 50 sinθ in y.

But another approach is to think about the problem as a projectile with initial velocity components vx and vy, where vx =5 +50 cosθ, vy=50 sinθ.

The time of flight T is determined by the vertical motion. Assuming it lands at the same vertical level, T= 2 vy/g = 2*(50 sinθ)/g.

So the horizontal distance R = vx * T = (5 +50 cosθ) * (2*50 sinθ)/g.

So R = (100 /g) (5 sinθ +50 sinθ cosθ).

Wait, earlier I expanded this correctly. So R is proportional to 5 sinθ +50 sinθ cosθ.

So to find the maximum, I took the derivative and ended up with θ≈47 degrees.

But looking at the options, the closest is 49°, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is different. Let me think differently.

If the truck weren't moving, the optimal angle would be 45 degrees, as that's when sin(2θ) is maximum at 1, giving the maximum range.

But when the truck is moving, perhaps the optimal angle changes. Because the horizontal velocity is now a combination of the truck's speed and the projectile's horizontal component.

Wait, another approach: For maximum range, the condition is that the derivative of R with respect to θ is zero, as I did before.

So perhaps the angle is approximately 45 degrees, but adjusted because the initial vx is higher.

Wait, but in the calculation, I found θ≈47°, which is near 45°, but the options don't have 47°. So the closest is 49°, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculus. Let me recheck the derivative.

f(θ)= (5 +50 cosθ) sinθ.

f’(θ) = derivative of first times second plus first times derivative of second.

Which is 5' sinθ + 5 (cosθ)' sinθ + (50 cosθ)' sinθ +50 cosθ (sinθ)'.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the function is (5 +50 cosθ) * sinθ.

So f(θ)=5 sinθ +50 sinθ cosθ.

So derivative is 5 cosθ +50 [ cosθ * cosθ + sinθ*(-sinθ) ].

Which simplifies to 5 cosθ +50 (cos²θ - sin²θ).

Which is correct.

Then, substituting cos(2θ)=cos²θ - sin²θ.

So equation becomes cosθ +10 cos(2θ)=0.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to solve this exactly. Let me set φ=θ, then the equation is:

cosφ +10 cos(2φ) =0.

Express cos(2φ) as 2 cos²φ -1.

So:

cosφ +10(2 cos²φ -1 )=0 => cosφ +20 cos²φ -10=0.

Which is 20 cos²φ +cosφ -10=0.

Which is the same as before. So the solution is cosφ=( -1 ± sqrt(1 + 800) )/(40).

Only the positive root makes sense since cosφ must be positive in 0<φ<90 degrees.

So cosφ≈0.6825, which is about 47 degrees. So the closest option is H:49°, but that's 2 degrees off. Alternatively, perhaps the options don't have 47, so maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps another way: Let me consider that when the initial horizontal velocity is much larger than the muzzle velocity's horizontal component, the optimal angle approaches zero. But in this case, the muzzle velocity is much higher than the truck's speed, so perhaps 45 degrees is a good approximation.

Wait, but if the truck's speed is 5 m/s, and the muzzle velocity is 50 m/s, then the ratio is 1:10. So the truck's speed is much smaller than the muzzle velocity. So the optimal angle would be close to 45 degrees, but perhaps a little higher.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I found it around 47 degrees, which is close to 45. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 45 degrees, option C.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be treated without considering the truck's velocity, but that can't be right because the question mentions it.

Wait, wait, perhaps I approached the problem incorrectly. Maybe the initial horizontal velocity is just 50 cosθ, and the truck's velocity is separate. But that doesn't make sense because the cannon is on the truck, so the projectile's velocity relative to the ground includes the truck's velocity.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this differently. Let me think again.

The truck is moving at 5 m/s. The cannon fires the ball with a muzzle velocity of 50 m/s at an angle θ above the horizontal relative to the truck. So the ball's velocity relative to the ground is (5 +50 cosθ, 50 sinθ).

So the initial velocity components are vx=5 +50 cosθ, vy=50 sinθ.

The time of flight is when the vertical displacement is zero, which is T= (2 vy)/g = (100 sinθ)/g.

So the range R is vx * T = (5 +50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ)/g.

We can write this as R = (100/g)(5 sinθ +50 sinθ cosθ).

Which is R = (100/g)(5 sinθ +25 sin2θ).

Wait, because 50 sinθ cosθ is 25 sin2θ.

So R = (100/g)(5 sinθ +25 sin2θ).

Hmm, but to find the maximum, perhaps I can factor this.

Alternatively, let's factor out 5:

R = (500/g) (sinθ +5 sin2θ).

Wait, that might not help much.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as R = (100/g)(5 sinθ +50 sinθ cosθ).

Hmm, maybe using calculus is still the way to go, but perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, earlier I found that the angle was approximately 47 degrees, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should treat the initial horizontal velocity as 50 cosθ plus 5, which I did, but maybe the time of flight is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the truck's velocity because it's much smaller than the muzzle velocity. But that can't be right; the problem says the operator wants maximum range, so the truck's velocity must be considered.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the optimal angle is when the derivative of R with respect to θ is zero, leading
