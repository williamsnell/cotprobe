Okay, I need to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law. Let me read it carefully.

So, the scenario is about a man and a woman who are partners in an automobile leasing agency. The man has been embezzling money. The woman gets suspicious and suggests an audit, which would probably uncover his embezzlement. Panicking, the man hires a professional killer to kill her for $10,000. Then, the woman dies in a car crash arranged by the killer.

The question is asking what additional crimes, besides embezzlement, the man may be convicted of. The options are A through J.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the man is already guilty of embezzlement. That's clear because he's been taking money from their agency. So any answer that doesn't include embezzlement is probably not the right one, but looking at the options, some include it and others don’t. Wait, the question says "in addition to embezzlement," so we don't need to worry about whether embezzlement is in the choices, just the other crimes.

Next, the man's actions after the woman's suspicion. He hires a killer. So, what crimes does that involve?

I remember that when someone hires another person to commit a crime, like murder, they can be charged with both conspiracy and solicitation, and also the actual crime if it's carried out.

Let me think about the elements here.

Solicitation is when someone asks another to commit a crime, with the intent that the crime be committed. Here, the man contacted a professional killer and offered him money to kill the woman. That sounds like solicitation to commit murder.

Conspiracy is when two or more people agree to commit a crime, and there's an overt act in furtherance of it. So, the man and the killer made an agreement—the man offered $10,000 to kill her. They had a plan, so that's a conspiracy to commit murder.

Then, when the woman was actually killed, the man could be charged with murder. Because even though he didn't physically do it, he's the one who hired the killer. Under the felony murder rule or the theory of vicarious liability in conspiracies, he can be held responsible for the murder.

Wait, but let me make sure. The man hired the killer, so he's the principal in the first degree if he's the one who ordered it. But since he's not the one who actually committed the murder, but he's part of the conspiracy, he's still guilty of murder.

So, the man is guilty of embezzlement, conspiracy to commit murder, solicitation to commit murder, and murder itself.

Wait, but let me check each option.

Option C says Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. That includes all four. But wait, the question says "in addition to embezzlement," so the answer should include the other crimes along with embezzlement. Or does it mean besides embezzlement, what else?

The question is phrased as "in addition to embezzlement," so the answer would include other crimes besides embezzlement. So, in the options, the ones that include embezzlement are C, G, H.

Option C includes all four, but I think that's correct.

Wait, but do we charge both conspiracy and solicitation? Or is one included in the other?

Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. Solicitation is the act of asking someone to commit a crime. So, when the man offered the killer money, that's solicitation. Then, when they agreed, that's conspiracy.

So, both can apply here. Therefore, the man can be convicted of both conspiracy and solicitation in addition to murder and embezzlement.

Wait, but let me think again. If the man and the killer formed an agreement, that's conspiracy. But the act of offering money is also solicitation. So, the man is guilty of both.

So, the possible crimes are:

- Embezzlement (already established)
- Solicitation to commit murder
- Conspiracy to commit murder
- Murder (because the woman died as a result of their plan)

So, the man can be convicted of all four.

Looking at the options, option C says Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. So that's all four.

Alternatively, option G says Solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. So that's missing conspiracy.

Option H is Conspiracy, embezzlement, and murder. So that's missing solicitation.

So, the correct answer should include all four: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

Wait, but let me check if there's any reason why one of these might not apply.

In some jurisdictions, if the conspiracy is formed and the crime is completed, the solicitation might merge into the conspiracy or the murder charge, but I think they can still be separate charges. So, it's possible to be convicted of both.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

The man in the scenario is guilty of embezzlement, as he has been unlawfully taking money from the agency. Beyond embezzlement, his actions involve additional crimes. When he hired a professional killer to murder his partner, he committed solicitation to commit murder by offering money to the killer. Additionally, by agreeing with the killer to carry out the murder, he formed a conspiracy to commit murder. Finally, when the woman died as a result of the car crash arranged by the killer, the man can be held liable for murder under the theory of vicarious liability or as part of the conspiracy.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. This includes all the crimes the man is guilty of and is the most comprehensive answer.
- **Option G**: Solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. This omits conspiracy, which is clearly applicable as the man and the killer agreed to commit the crime.
- **Option H**: Conspiracy, embezzlement, and murder. This omits solicitation, which occurred when the man offered money to the killer to commit the murder.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it accounts for all the crimes the man may be convicted of: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

Answer: C
