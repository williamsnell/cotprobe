Okay, so I've got this problem here about oxygen leaking from a container. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The container's volume is 2.5 cubic feet. Initially, the pressure is 125 psia, and the temperature is 75°F. Then the pressure drops to 100 psia, same temperature. I need to find out how many pounds of oxygen leaked out. Oh right, assuming ideal gas behavior.

Wait, I remember that for ideal gases, the state can be described by the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Oh wait, but wait, since both the initial and final states are at the same temperature and volume, maybe I can consider the change in moles. Because pressure is dropping, so the number of moles is decreasing, which means oxygen is leaking out.

So, maybe I can calculate the initial moles and the final moles, then find the difference. The difference would be the moles that leaked out. Then convert moles to pounds.

Let me jot that down.

The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT. Since V and T are constant, maybe I can find the ratio of n1 to n2 based on the pressures. Because P is proportional to n when V and T are fixed.

So, initial pressure P1 is 125 psia, final P2 is 100 psia. So n1 = (P1)/(RT) * V, same for n2. So n1/n2 = P1/P2. But wait, actually, since V and T are same, n1 = (P1 V)/(R T), and n2 = (P2 V)/(R T). So n1 - n2 = (P1 - P2) V / (R T). Oh wait, but that's the change in moles, which is the moles that leaked out.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The moles remaining after the leak would be n2 = (P2 V)/(R T). The initial moles were n1 = (P1 V)/(R T). So the moles leaked out is n1 - n2 = V (P1 - P2)/(R T).

But wait, I'm a bit confused about units here. Because the gas constant R has different values depending on the units of pressure, volume, and temperature.

Right, the problem gives pressure in psia, volume in cubic feet, and temperature in Fahrenheit. So I need to convert these to units compatible with R. Because when using R, if I'm using pounds and feet, I think R is in units like (psia·ft³)/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, let me check. The gas constant R for air or oxygen would be, I think, 1716 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R) for oxygen? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the values. Oh wait, no, for air it's about 1716, but oxygen's specific gas constant is different.

Wait, I think the molar mass of oxygen is 32 g/mol, so 32 lbm per lbmol. So the specific gas constant R for oxygen would be R_specific = R_universal / M. R_universal is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R), wait, no, wait, that can't be right. Wait, the universal gas constant R is 10.7316 (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R) for some units, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed and clarify as I go. So, the steps are:

1. Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Rankine (since R requires absolute temperature).

2. Calculate initial moles (n1) and final moles (n2) using PV = nRT.

3. Find the difference (n_leaked = n1 - n2).

4. Convert moles leaked into pounds (multiply by molar mass).

So, let's go step by step.

First, temperature: 75°F. To Rankine, T = 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 °R.

Volume is 2.5 ft³. Pressure P1 is 125 psia, P2 is 100 psia.

So, n1 = P1 V / (R T).

Wait, R is the specific gas constant for oxygen. Wait, no, R is the universal gas constant divided by the molar mass. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where R is the universal gas constant if n is in moles, but for engineering units, sometimes we use R specific to the gas.

Wait, to clarify, the ideal gas law is written as PV = nRT, where R is the specific gas constant for the gas in question, with units psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R). For oxygen, R is 49.317 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R)? Wait, no, maybe I'm thinking of another gas.

Wait, no. The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 (psia·ft³)/(lbmol·°R). Then, for a specific gas, the specific gas constant is R_specific = R_universal / M, where M is the molar mass in lbm/lbmol.

Oxygen has a molar mass of 32 g/mol, which is 32 lbm/lbmol. So R_specific = 10.7316 / 32 = approx 0.3352 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, wait, no. The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R) when n is in lbmol. So for a specific gas, the equation is PV = (M * n) R T, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the ideal gas law in terms of density or specific variables.

Alternatively, since the problem is about pounds (lbm), and the gas is oxygen, perhaps I can use the form:

PV = mRT, where m is mass in lbm, but then R would have different units. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the moles first, then multiply by molar mass to get mass.

Wait, let's stick with n being in lbmol. So R for universal is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R). So for oxygen, the molar mass is 32 lbm/lbmol.

So, initial moles n1 = (P1 V) / (R T) = (125 psia * 2.5 ft³) / (10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R) * 534.67 °R).

Wait, let me compute that.

First, numerator: 125 * 2.5 = 312.5 psia·ft³.

Denominator: 10.7316 * 534.67 ≈ let's calculate that.

534.67 * 10.7316 ≈ 534.67 * 10 is 5346.7, 534.67 * 0.7316 is approx 534.67 * 0.7 = 374.27, 534.67 * 0.0316≈ 16.9, so total ≈ 374.27 + 16.9 ≈ 391.17, so total denominator ≈ 5346.7 + 391.17 ≈ 5737.87.

So n1 ≈ 312.5 / 5737.87 ≈ 0.05443 lbmol.

Similarly, n2 = (100 psia * 2.5 ft³) / (10.7316 * 534.67).

So numerator: 100 *2.5 = 250.

Denominator same as before, 5737.87.

n2 ≈ 250 / 5737.87 ≈ 0.04357 lbmol.

So the moles leaked out is n1 - n2 = 0.05443 - 0.04357 = 0.01086 lbmol.

Now, convert lbmol to lbm. Since 1 lbmol is 32 lbm, so 0.01086 lbmol * 32 lbm/lbmol = 0.3475 lbm.

So the mass leaked out is approximately 0.3475 lbm. So looking at the options, option B is -0.347 lbm, which matches.

Wait, but wait, why is it negative? Because the question says "how many pounds of oxygen leaked out", so it's a loss, so it's negative, but the options have negative signs. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate n1 and n2.

n1 = (125 *2.5) / (10.7316 * 534.67)

125 *2.5 = 312.5.

10.7316 * 534.67. Let me compute this more accurately.

10.7316 * 534.67:

10 * 534.67 = 5346.7

0.7316 *534.67:

Let's compute step by step.

534.67 * 0.7 = 374.269

534.67 * 0.03 = 16.0401

534.67 * 0.0016= approx 0.856 (since 534.67 *0.001=0.53467, 0.0006*534.67=0.3208, total 0.85547.)

So adding 374.269 +16.0401 = 390.3091 + 0.85547 ≈ 391.1646.

So total denominator 5346.7 + 391.1646 ≈ 5737.8646.

So n1 = 312.5 / 5737.8646 ≈ 0.05443 lbmol.

n2 = 250 / same denominator, so 250 /5737.8646 = approx 0.04357 lbmol.

So the difference is 0.01086 lbmol. Multiply by 32 lbm/lbmol: 0.01086 *32 = 0.3475 lbm.

So yeah, 0.347 lbm, which is option B.

Another way: Since the pressure drops, you can find the ratio of moles. Since P1/P2 = 125/100 = 5/4, so n1 = (5/4) n2. The difference is n1 -n2 = (5/4 n2) -n2 = (1/4) n2.

Wait, but wait, that's a ratio approach. Alternatively, since V and T are same, n is proportional to P. So n1 = (125/100) n2 = 1.25 n2. So n_leaked = n1 -n2 = 0.25 n2.

Wait, but using this approach, maybe I can compute it that way. Let me see.

Because V and T are same, n1 = (P1 / P2) * n2.

So, n_leaked = n1 -n2 = (P1/P2 -1) *n2.

But perhaps this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was more straightforward.

So I think the correct answer is option B: -0.347 lbm.

To determine how many pounds of oxygen leaked out of the container, we use the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \). Since the volume \( V \) and temperature \( T \) remain constant, the number of moles \( n \) is proportional to the pressure \( P \). The moles of oxygen that leaked out can be calculated as the difference between the initial moles \( n_1 \) and the final moles \( n_2 \).

### Step 1: Convert temperature to Rankine
The temperature is given as \( 75^\circ \text{F} \). Converting to Rankine:
\[
T = 75 + 459.67 = 534.67^\circ \text{R}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate initial and final moles
Using the ideal gas law, the moles of oxygen are:
\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT},
\]
where \( R \) is the universal gas constant, \( 10.7316 \, \text{psia·ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·}^\circ \text{R}) \), and \( P \) is the pressure in psia.

- **Initial moles** (\( n_1 \)):
\[
n_1 = \frac{125 \, \text{psia} \cdot 2.5 \, \text{ft}^3}{10.7316 \, \text{psia·ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·}^\circ \text{R}) \cdot 534.67^\circ \text{R}}.
\]
Numerator: \( 125 \cdot 2.5 = 312.5 \, \text{psia·ft}^3 \).  
Denominator: \( 10.7316 \cdot 534.67 \approx 5737.87 \, \text{psia·ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·}^\circ \text{R}) \).  
\[
n_1 \approx \frac{312.5}{5737.87} \approx 0.05443 \, \text{lbmol}.
\]

- **Final moles** (\( n_2 \)):
\[
n_2 = \frac{100 \, \text{psia} \cdot 2.5 \, \text{ft}^3}{10.7316 \, \text{psia·ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·}^\circ \text{R}) \cdot 534.67^\circ \text{R}}.
\]
Numerator: \( 100 \cdot 2.5 = 250 \, \text{psia·ft}^3 \).  
Denominator: \( 10.7316 \cdot 534.67 \approx 5737.87 \, \text{psia·ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·}^\circ \text{R}) \).  
\[
n_2 \approx \frac{250}{5737.87} \approx 0.04357 \, \text{lbmol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate moles leaked
The moles of oxygen that leaked out are:
\[
n_{\text{leaked}} = n_1 - n_2 = 0.05443 - 0.04357 = 0.01086 \, \text{lbmol}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert moles to pounds
The molar mass of oxygen is \( 32 \, \text{lbm/lbmol} \). Thus, the mass of oxygen that leaked out is:
\[
\text{Mass leaked} = n_{\text{leaked}} \cdot 32 = 0.01086 \cdot 32 \approx 0.347 \, \text{lbm}.
\]

### Final Answer
The pounds of oxygen that leaked out of the container are approximately \( -0.347 \, \text{lbm} \), where the negative sign indicates a loss of mass. This corresponds to **option B**.
