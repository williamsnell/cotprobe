Question:

A testator died and through his will gave his entire estate to charity, but the gift failed because the will was executed 10 days prior to the testator's death. A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator. "The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the testator's privacy.
C: admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
D: admissible, as it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements of personal or family history.
E: admissible, because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife.
F: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is considered hearsay.
H: admissible, as it provides evidence of a common law marriage.
I: admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.
J: inadmissible, as the hotel register is not a legal document establishing marriage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about the admissibility of the clerk's testimony in a trial where a man is claiming to be the heir of a testator. 

First, the setup: The testator died, leaving his estate to charity. But the will's gift failed because it was executed 10 days before his death. Now, a man is claiming he's the testator's son and heir. He's suing the estate. 

At the trial, the man couldn't produce proof of a ceremonial marriage between his mother and the testator. But he showed that they cohabited for years and that his mother died just one day before the testator. 

The jurisdiction has a Dead Man's Statute. The man's attorney called a hotel clerk who testified that the testator and the man's mother would come to the hotel every year, and the testator would sign the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." 

The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

I remember that the Dead Man's Statute (also known as the hearsay exception when a party is dead) generally prevents a party from testifying about transactions or communications with a deceased person when the deceased could have been a party to the litigation. But wait, in this case, the clerk is testifying about what he saw, not about any communication from the deceased. So maybe the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply here.

The clerk's testimony is about the testator's public act of signing the register as Mr. and Mrs. Testator. That's not hearsay because it's not an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter—it's more about the fact that they represented themselves as married. So the hearsay rule might not apply. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute. But the clerk is a third party, not a party transaction, so maybe this isn't the right reason.

Option B is about privacy, but I don't think that's a standard evidentiary rule here.

Option C mentions pedigree exception. I think pedigree exceptions relate to family history, but I'm not sure if that applies to the clerk's testimony.

Option D talks about personal or family history statements. The testator's signing as Mr. and Mrs. could be a statement about their marital status, which might fall under this exception. But wait, the testator is deceased, so maybe it's allowed under an exception.

Option E says it's admissible because it shows public recognition as husband and wife. That sounds plausible because it's evidence of their holding themselves out as married, which could imply a common-law marriage or at least reputation.

Option F says it's inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. The best evidence rule requires the original when the contents are in question. But here, the testimony is about the signing, not the content of the register. So maybe the clerk can testify without producing the register.

Option G claims it's hearsay. But as I thought earlier, it's about the act of signing, not the content of what was said. So it's not hearsay.

Option H suggests it's for a common-law marriage. That might be the case, but the question is about admissibility, not the underlying issue of whether they were married.

Option I says it's admissible because the clerk had personal knowledge. That's true; he saw them sign. But that alone doesn't make it automatically admissible—there might be other rules.

Option J says it's inadmissible because the register isn't a legal document. But the point isn't the register's legal status; it's the public act of signing as husband and wife.

Putting it all together: The clerk's testimony is about the testator's actions, which is relevant to show that they held themselves out as married. This can be used to establish reputation or common-law marriage. Since it's not hearsay and the Dead Man's Statute doesn't block it, it should be admissible. 

Looking back, option E seems to fit because it's about public recognition. Alternatively, option D could be about family history. But I think E is more accurate because it's about their public representation as a married couple.

The clerk's testimony is admissible because it provides evidence of the testator and the man's mother publicly recognizing themselves as husband and wife by signing the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." This testimony is not barred by the Dead Man's Statute, as it does not involve communications or transactions with the deceased that would be covered by the statute. Additionally, the testimony is not hearsay because it pertains to the testator's public act of signing the register, which is relevant to establishing their marital status or reputation. The best evidence rule does not apply here because the testimony is about the act of signing, not the content of the register itself. Therefore, the testimony is admissible as it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife.

E: admissible, because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife.

Answer: E
