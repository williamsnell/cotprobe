Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that Conor made 9 shapes with straws. Each shape had 5 straws. Then, Conor used 15 more straws to make more shapes. The question is asking for the total number of straws Conor used to make all the shapes.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, Conor made 9 shapes. Each shape uses 5 straws. So, to find out how many straws he used initially, I should multiply the number of shapes by the number of straws per shape. That makes sense because each shape requires the same number of straws.

So, 9 shapes multiplied by 5 straws each. Let me do that calculation: 9 * 5 equals 45. Okay, so Conor used 45 straws for the first set of shapes.

But wait, the problem says he used 15 more straws to make more shapes. So, after the initial 45, he used an additional 15 straws. Now, I need to add those 15 straws to the initial amount to find the total.

So, adding them together: 45 + 15 equals 60. That seems straightforward. So the total number of straws Conor used is 60.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. It says he used 15 more straws to make more shapes. Does that mean he made additional shapes beyond the initial 9, using 15 straws in total for those extra shapes? Or does it mean he used 15 more straws per shape? No, that can't be right because each shape was already using 5 straws. So I think the 15 more is just an additional amount added to the initial total.

Another way to look at it: initial straws = 9 * 5 =45. Then he added 15 more, so total is 45+15=60.

Looking at the options, option A is 60. So the answer should be A.

I think that's correct. No, I don't see any other way to interpret this. The problem doesn't mention how many additional shapes he made with those 15 straws, but that's not necessary because the question is only about the total number of straws used. So whether he made 3 more shapes (15/5) or just used 15 straws in some other way, the total is still 60.

Conor initially made 9 shapes, each requiring 5 straws, totaling 9 Ã— 5 = 45 straws. He then used an additional 15 straws, so the total number of straws used is 45 + 15 = 60.
