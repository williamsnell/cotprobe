Question:

A woman hired a builder to build a house according to certain plans and specifications prepared by the woman's architect. The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the builder's inability to complete the building due to the lumber yard's breach of contract directly affected the woman.
B: Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.
C: Yes, but only if the woman had made an advance payment to the builder.
D: No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.
E: No, because the builder did not notify the woman immediately after the fire at the lumber yard.
F: Yes, if the woman can prove that the lumber yard's refusal to supply lumber was the sole reason for the delay in construction.
G: Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.
H: No, because the woman did not have a direct contract with the lumber yard, so she cannot sue for breach of contract.
I: No, because the fire was an act of nature and the lumber yard had no control over it.
J: No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

So, a woman hired a builder to build a house based on plans from her architect. The price was $250k, and it was supposed to be done in four months. Two weeks after the contract, the builder contacts a lumber yard to buy wood. They have a written agreement: lumber yard supplies the wood for $10k, payable by the builder in 30 days.

Then, a week later, a fire destroyed part of the lumber yard's supply. So the lumber yard refuses to supply the wood. Builder can't find another supplier and tells the woman he can't finish on time. Now, the woman is suing the lumber yard owner for breach of contract. Will she win?

Hmm. The question is about whether the woman can sue the lumber yard. Let's think about contract law principles here.

First, I remember that privity of contract is important. That means that only the parties to the contract can sue each other for breach. So, in this case, the builder and the lumber yard have a contract. The woman is not a party to that contract. So normally, she can't sue the lumber yard because there's no privity between them.

Wait, but third-party beneficiary contracts. There are cases where a third party can sue if they're an intended beneficiary. So, like, if A and B have a contract where B is supposed to do something for the benefit of C, then C might be able to sue if they're the intended beneficiary.

So the question is, is the woman an intended third-party beneficiary of the builder-lumber yard contract? Or is she just an incidental beneficiary?

In this case, the builder is buying lumber to build the woman's house. So the lumber is specifically for her project. But when the builder and lumber yard made their contract, was the intention to benefit the woman directly? Or was the builder just getting materials as part of his own business?

Usually, in these cases, the third party (the woman) is an intended beneficiary if the contract was made with the intent to directly benefit her. But I think in most construction contracts, the subcontractors are hired by the builder, and the owner is not considered a third-party beneficiary. Because the builder is responsible to the owner for the overall project, and the builder handles the subcontracts himself.

So the woman's contract is with the builder, not the lumber yard. The builder is responsible for ensuring the project is completed, including getting all the necessary materials. If the lumber yard fails, that's between the builder and the lumber yard. The woman can sue the builder for breach if he doesn't deliver on time, but she can't directly sue the lumber yard.

Looking at the answer options, let's see:

Option J says no because she's an incidental beneficiary. That makes sense because the contract between builder and lumber yard was for the builder's purposes, not directly for the woman. So she's only incidentally benefiting, not the intended beneficiary.

Option D says no because no privity. That's correct too because she's not a party to that contract. But D is a more general answer, while J is specific about being an incidental beneficiary.

Wait, but the question is about suing for breach of contract. So privity is the main issue. The woman isn't in privity with the lumber yard, so she can't sue them. So the correct answer would be either D or J.

Another point: Some jurisdictions allow third-party beneficiaries to sue even if they aren't in privity, but only if they are intended beneficiaries. But in this case, the woman is not an intended beneficiary of the builder-lumber yard contract. The builder is just using the lumber for his own obligation to the woman.

So the correct reason is that she's an incidental beneficiary. So option J is the right answer.

Wait, but another thought: if the lumber yard's breach caused a direct loss to the woman, does that mean anything? No, because in contract law, the remedy is between the contracting parties. Torts might be different, but this is a breach of contract.

So yes, the answer should be J.
</think>

The woman cannot sue the lumber yard for breach of contract because she lacks privity of contract with the lumber yard. The contract was between the builder and the lumber yard, and the woman is not a party to it. While third-party beneficiary contracts allow intended beneficiaries to sue, the woman is merely an incidental beneficiary here. The builder's contract with the lumber yard was intended to fulfill the builder's own obligations, not to directly benefit the woman. Therefore, the woman's remedy lies with the builder, not the lumber yard.

The correct answer is based on the principle that only intended third-party beneficiaries can sue for breach of contract, and the woman does not meet that criteria in this scenario.

Answer: J
