Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that y1 and y2 are a fundamental set of solutions for the differential equation t y'' + 2 y' + t e^t y = 0. And we're given that the Wronskian of y1 and y2 at t=1 is 2. We need to find the Wronskian at t=5.

Hmm, right, I remember that the Wronskian of a fundamental set of solutions is related to the differential equation itself. Oh wait, there's something about the Wronskian satisfying a first-order linear differential equation. Let me recall the formula.

The Wronskian W(y1, y2)(t) of two solutions y1 and y2 of a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation at^2 y'' + b(t) y' + c(t) y =0 satisfies the equation:

dW/dt = -b(t)/a(t) * W.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The general equation is that for the equation a(t) y'' + b(t) y' + c(t) y = 0, the Wronskian of two solutions satisfies dW/dt = -b(t)/a(t) * W. Because the formula I remember is dW/dt + (b(t)/a(t)) W = 0.

So yeah, that's a first-order linear ODE for W. So if I can write this equation for W, I can solve it to find W(5) given that W(1)=2.

Let me write down the given equation again: t y'' + 2 y' + t e^t y = 0. So comparing to the standard form a(t) y'' + b(t) y' + c(t) y = 0, we have a(t) = t, b(t) = 2, and c(t) = t e^t.

So for the Wronskian, the equation is dW/dt = - (b(t)/a(t)) W. Plugging in the values, we get dW/dt = - (2/t) * W.

Wait, because b(t)/a(t) is 2/t. So the equation becomes dW/dt = -(2/t) W.

This is a separable equation. Let me rearrange it: dW/W = -2 (1/t) dt.

Integrating both sides, I get ln|W| = -2 ln|t| + C, where C is the constant of integration.

Exponentiating both sides, we get W = C' / t^2, where C' = e^C is another constant.

So the general solution for the Wronskian is W(t) = C' / t².

Wait, but we know that W(1) = 2. Let me plug t=1 into this equation to find C'.

So when t=1, W = C' / (1)^2 = C' = 2. So C' is 2.

Therefore, the Wronskian as a function of t is W(t) = 2 / t².

Now the question asks for W(5). So substituting t=5 into this expression:

W(5) = 2 / (5)^2 = 2 / 25.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me go through the steps again.

We have the differential equation for W: dW/dt = - (b(t)/a(t)) W. So b(t) is 2, a(t) is t, so it's -2/t * W.

So dW/dt = (-2/t) W.

Then the solution is W(t) = W0 * exp(∫ (-2/t) dt). The integral of (-2/t) dt is -2 ln t, so exp(-2 ln t) = t^(-2) = 1/t². So W(t) = W0 / t².

Using the initial condition W(1)=2, so W(1) = W0 / (1)^2 = W0 = 2. So yes, W(t)=2/t².

So at t=5, W(5)=2/(5^2)=2/25.

Looking at the options, option I is 2/25. So the answer should be I.

The given differential equation is:

\[
t y'' + 2 y' + t e^t y = 0
\]

Here, \(a(t) = t\), \(b(t) = 2\), and \(c(t) = t e^t\). The Wronskian \(W(y_1, y_2)(t)\) of a fundamental set of solutions satisfies the first-order linear differential equation:

\[
\frac{dW}{dt} = -\frac{b(t)}{a(t)} W
\]

Substituting \(b(t) = 2\) and \(a(t) = t\), we get:

\[
\frac{dW}{dt} = -\frac{2}{t} W
\]

This is a separable equation, which can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{dW}{W} = -\frac{2}{t} dt
\]

Integrating both sides:

\[
\ln|W| = -2 \ln|t| + C
\]

Exponentiating both sides gives:

\[
W(t) = \frac{C'}{t^2}
\]

where \(C' = e^C\) is a constant. Using the initial condition \(W(1) = 2\), we find:

\[
W(1) = \frac{C'}{1^2} = C' = 2
\]

Thus, the Wronskian as a function of \(t\) is:

\[
W(t) = \frac{2}{t^2}
\]

To find \(W(5)\), substitute \(t = 5\):

\[
W(5) = \frac{2}{5^2} = \frac{2}{25}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: \(2/25\)**
