Question:

A woman was seven months pregnant with her first child. One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang. The gang member did not know anyone was witnessing his act of shooting the victim. The woman watched as the victim collapsed and fell dead on her neighbor's front lawn. As a result of her shock from viewing this horrible incident, the woman suffered a miscarriage. If the woman asserts a claim against the local gang member who shot the victim, the woman will

Options:

A: recover, because she suffered a physical injury, rather than just emotional harm.
B: not recover, because the gang member was unaware that the woman was watching.
C: not recover, because the woman was not the intended target of the gang member's act.
D: not recover, because the woman voluntarily assumed the risk by watching the crime.
E: not recover, because the miscarriage cannot be directly linked to the gang member's act.
F: recover, because the gang member acted intentionally in shooting the victim.
G: not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger.
H: recover, because the gang member's act was a direct cause of her miscarriage.
I: recover, because the gang member's act was unlawful and caused harm.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this law question, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the scenario is about a pregnant woman who witnesses a crime. She's seven months pregnant and sees a gang member shoot someone else. Because of the shock, she miscarries. Now, she's suing the gang member. The question is whether she can recover damages, and the options are from A to I.

First, I think I need to figure out what kind of claim she's making. Since it's a tort question, probably negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress. But wait, she's not the direct victim of the gang member's intentional act; the gang member shot someone else. So maybe it's about whether she can claim for the emotional distress caused by witnessing the crime.

Wait, but she suffered a physical injuryâ€”the miscarriage. So maybe it's a case where the emotional distress led to a physical harm. But I remember that in some cases, you can't recover for emotional distress unless certain conditions are met.

I remember the concept of the "zone of danger." If a person is in the zone of danger, meaning they were at risk of physical harm, then they can recover for emotional distress even if the distress results in physical harm. But if they're not in the zone of danger, then it's more about whether the defendant's actions were so outrageous that it causes severe emotional distress, leading to physical harm.

In this case, the woman was inside her house, watching through the window. The gang member didn't know she was there. So she wasn't the target, and maybe not in immediate physical danger. So perhaps she wasn't in the zone of danger.

So if she wasn't in the zone of danger, can she still recover? I think for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, that it was intended to cause severe emotional distress, and that it actually did cause severe distress. But here, the gang member didn't intend to cause distress to her; he was shooting someone else. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, can she claim under negligence? For negligence, the defendant must owe a duty of care, breach it, causing injury which is foreseeable. But I'm not sure if a bystander's emotional distress leading to physical injury would be considered foreseeable here. Because the woman wasn't in the zone of danger, maybe the gang member couldn't have reasonably foreseen that a pregnant woman watching from a distance would miscarry due to the shock.

Wait, but in some cases, like when a mother is in the vicinity and sees her child in danger, courts have allowed recovery. But in this case, she's watching someone else's killing, not her own child or someone close.

So maybe the key is whether she was in the zone of danger. If she was, then her physical injury from emotional distress can be recovered. If she wasn't, then maybe not.

Looking at the options, option G says she won't recover because she wasn't in the zone of danger. Option A says she can recover because she had a physical injury. But I think just having a physical injury isn't enough if the emotional distress wasn't actionable.

Wait, the cause of action would be for the emotional distress leading to the injury. So even if she has a physical injury, if the underlying claim for emotional distress isn't valid, then she can't recover.

So if she wasn't in the zone of danger, then her claim for emotional distress might fail, and thus the physical injury resulting from it might not be recoverable.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might allow recovery if the defendant's act was so outrageous that it's foreseeable it would cause distress to a bystander, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Looking at the options:

Option A: recover because physical injury. But that's only if the emotional distress claim is valid.

Option C: not recover because she wasn't the intended target. I think that's more about intentional torts, but the intent was to shoot the victim, not her.

Option G: not recover because not in the zone of danger.

So I'm thinking that the correct answer is G. Because she wasn't in the zone of danger, she can't recover for the emotional distress, even though it caused a physical injury.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because she has a physical injury, so it's a direct cause, but I'm not sure. I think the courts require that the emotional distress be actionable, which in this case, since she's a bystander not in danger, it's not.

So I think the answer is G.

The question revolves around whether a woman who miscarried due to the emotional distress of witnessing a crime can recover damages from the perpetrator. The key issue is whether her claim for emotional distress leading to physical harm is actionable.

The woman was inside her house, not in immediate physical danger, and the gang member was unaware of her presence. Courts typically require a plaintiff to be within the "zone of danger" to recover for emotional distress caused by observing a crime. Since she was not in the zone of danger, her claim for emotional distress may fail, even though it resulted in a physical injury like a miscarriage.

Option A suggests recovery because she suffered a physical injury, but the underlying claim for emotional distress must still be valid. Option G states she cannot recover because she was not in the zone of danger, which aligns with the reasoning that her emotional distress claim would likely fail under these circumstances.

Given that the woman was not in the zone of danger and the gang member's actions were not directed at her, the correct answer is:

G: not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger.

Answer: G
