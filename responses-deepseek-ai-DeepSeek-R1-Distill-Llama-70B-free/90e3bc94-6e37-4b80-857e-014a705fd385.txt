Question:

Research on explicit (intentional) and implicit (automatic) memory indicates that

Options:

A: both forms of memory fluctuate in capacity throughout the adult life span
B: neither forms of memory are affected by age, only by a disease process like Alzheimer’s
C: both forms of memory show a fairly consistent, gradual decline over the adult life span
D: both forms of memory remain stable, except when affected by a disease process like Alzheimer’s
E: explicit memory capacity remains stable, while implicit memory capacity declines with age
F: implicit memory capacity declines with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable
G: both forms of memory increase their capacity with age
H: implicit memory capacity increases with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable
I: explicit memory capacity increases with age, while implicit memory capacity declines
J: explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable

Okay, so I've got this question about explicit and implicit memory and how they're affected by age. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that there are different types of memory. Explicit memory is the intentional kind, like remembering facts or events, right? Like when you try to recall what you did last weekend. Implicit memory is more automatic, like skills or conditioned responses. For example, riding a bike is implicit because you don't think about it; you just do it.

The question is about how these change during adulthood. I think I remember that as people age, some memory functions decline while others stay the same or even improve. Wait, explicit memory is linked to the hippocampus, which I think is affected by aging. So maybe explicit memory declines because the hippocampus isn't as efficient as we get older. But implicit memory doesn't rely on the hippocampus as much. It's more about the cerebellum or other areas, I believe. So implicit memory might not decline as much with age.

So looking at the options, let's see. Option J says explicit declines but implicit remains stable. Option E says explicit is stable and implicit declines. Wait, no, I thought explicit declines and implicit stays the same. So J would be correct.

Other options: A says both fluctuate. I don't think that's right. B says neither is affected by age, only by disease. No, because I remember that explicit memory does decline with normal aging. C says both decline, which doesn't fit. D says both are stable except diseases. No, because explicit does decline normally. E is the opposite, so no. F says implicit declines and explicit is stable. That would be wrong because explicit is the one that declines. G says both increase, which doesn't sound right. H says implicit increases, explicit stable. I don't think so. I says explicit increases, which I don't think is correct.

So the correct answer should be J. Explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit remains stable.

The question examines how explicit and implicit memory change during adulthood. Explicit memory, which involves intentional recall of facts and events, is linked to the hippocampus and shows a decline with age. Implicit memory, which is automatic and skill-based, does not rely on the hippocampus and remains stable as people age. Among the options, only J correctly states that explicit memory declines while implicit memory remains stable.

Answer: J
