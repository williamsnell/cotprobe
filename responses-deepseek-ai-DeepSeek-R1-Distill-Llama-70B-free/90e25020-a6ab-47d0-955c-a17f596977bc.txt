Question:

Tired after a long, hard day at school, Cyrus decides to take a nap. An hour later, his Dad wakes him to let him know it's time for dinner. Cyrus feels worse than when he went to bed and can hardly drag himself to the table. An EEG of Cyrus right before he was awoken would most likely have shown a preponderance of

Okay, so I have this question about EEG readings and sleep stages. Let me try to think it through. The question is about Cyrus who takes a nap and then feels worse after waking up. His dad wakes him for dinner, and he feels more tired than before. I need to figure out what his EEG would show right before he was awoken.

Hmm. I remember that sleep is divided into different stages, and each stage has different brain wave patterns. The main types are alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves. There's also something called REM sleep, which is when most dreams happen.

Wait, when you first fall asleep, you start with alpha waves, right? Those are the relaxed, closed-eyes but still awake state. Then as you go deeper into sleep, you move into theta waves, which are slower. After that comes the deeper stages with delta waves, which are the slowest and highest amplitude.

Oh, right, sleep is divided into stages. Stage 1 is light sleep with theta waves. Stage 2 has sleep spindles and maybe some K-complexes. Stage 3 is deep sleep with delta waves. REM sleep is when brain activity picks up again, similar to being awake, so maybe beta waves or something like that.

So the question is about when Cyrus was awakened. He took an hour-long nap. Wait, but naps can be of different lengths. If he felt worse when he woke up, that might mean he was woken during a particular stage of sleep which leaves you groggy.

I remember that if you wake up during deep sleep, like stage 3, you feel disoriented and groggy. That's called sleep inertia. So if he was woken from a deep stage, his EEG would have shown delta waves before waking.

Wait, but let me think about the timing. He napped for an hour. The sleep cycle is about 90-120 minutes, so in an hour, he might have gone through the first cycle. Let me break it down: the first cycle starts with light sleep (stage 1, theta), then stage 2 (spindles), then stage 3 (delta). Then REM sleep. So in an hour, he might have completed the first cycle and entered REM, but not sure.

Wait, no. The first REM phase is usually after about 90 minutes, but a 20-minute nap might only get to stage 2. An hour could cover stages 1, 2, 3, and maybe into REM? Or maybe not. But the key here is how he feels upon waking.

If he was in a light stage, like stage 1 or 2, he might wake up feeling more refreshed. But since he feels worse, he was probably in stage 3, deep sleep, which is dominated by delta waves.

So the EEG right before waking would show a lot of delta waves. Looking at the options, option G is delta waves. So the answer should be G.

I think that's right because delta waves are high amplitude and slow, characteristic of deep, restorative sleep. Waking from this stage leaves you groggy.

Cyrus took a nap and felt worse upon waking, which suggests he was woken during a deep stage of sleep. Sleep is divided into stages characterized by specific brain wave patterns: alpha waves (relaxed wakefulness), theta waves (light sleep), delta waves (deep sleep), and REM sleep (rapid brain activity). Waking during deep sleep, dominated by delta waves, often results in grogginess or disorientation, known as sleep inertia. Since Cyrus's nap lasted an hour, he likely progressed through the initial sleep cycle, including deep sleep (stage 3), where delta waves predominate. Therefore, his EEG before waking would most likely show delta waves.
