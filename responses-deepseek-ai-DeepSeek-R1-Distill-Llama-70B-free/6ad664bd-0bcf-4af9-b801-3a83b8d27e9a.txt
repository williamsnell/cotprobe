Okay, so I have this question about the escape velocity from the Moon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, escape velocity is the minimum speed a spacecraft needs to break free from a celestial body's gravitational pull without further propulsion, right? I remember that it depends on the mass and radius of the body. The formula for escape velocity is sqrt(2GM/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, and R is the radius of the body.

Oh right, Earth's escape velocity is about 11.2 km/s, but the Moon is much smaller. So the escape velocity should be lower than Earth's. Let me think about the Moon's mass and radius. The Moon is smaller than Earth, so both its mass and radius are less, which would affect the escape velocity.

Wait, I think the Moon's escape velocity is around 2.4 km/s. Or was it 2.3 something? I'm a bit confused. I remember that the Apollo missions had to achieve that velocity to leave the Moon's gravity. So looking at the options provided, let me check:

Options are A:2100, B:2470, C:2600, D:2380, E:3300, F:1750, G:1900, H:2850, I:2025, J:1520.

So if I'm thinking 2.4 km/s, that's 2400 m/s. The closest option is B:2470 or D:2380. Hmm, which is it?

Wait, maybe I should calculate it. Let me see, do I know the Moon's mass and radius? Alternatively, I might remember that the Moon's surface gravity is about 1.625 m/s², which is about 1/6 of Earth's. But escape velocity isn't directly proportional to surface gravity because it also depends on radius and mass.

Alternatively, I can recall that the escape velocity from the Moon is approximately 2.38 km/s. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think it's actually around 2.4 km/s. Or perhaps 2.38 is correct.

Wait, another approach. I remember that the escape velocity is sqrt(2) times the orbital velocity at the surface. The orbital velocity for the Moon... I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the formula:

Escape velocity v = sqrt(2 * G * M / R)

But I don't have the exact values for M and R for the Moon. Alternatively, I can look up typical values. The Moon's radius is about 1,737 kilometers, and its mass is roughly 7.34767309 × 10^22 kg.

Wait, but without exact numbers, maybe I should rely on what I remember. I think the escape velocity from the Moon is about 2.38 km/s. Looking at the options, D is 2380 m/s. So that would match.

Wait wait, but sometimes I get confused between escape velocity and orbital velocity. The orbital velocity at the Moon's surface would be sqrt(GM/R), and escape is sqrt(2) times that. So if the orbital is about 1.7 km/s, then escape is about 2.4. So that would point to 2.4, which is option B:2470.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think of another angle. Apollo spacecraft had to reach escape velocity to leave the Moon. Their ascent from the lunar surface required about 2.4 km/s, but I'm not sure if that's the exact figure.

Alternatively, I've heard that the escape velocity from the Moon is 2.38 km/s. So that would be D:2380.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me try to find a reliable way. From memory, the escape velocity from the Moon is approximately 2370 m/s, which would make option D:2380 the closest.

Another way: I remember that the escape velocity is lower than Earth's, and the Moon is much smaller. So 2.4 km/s makes sense.

Wait, but looking at the options, B is 2470, D is 2380. Which is correct? I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should recall that the actual escape velocity of the Moon is about 2.38 km/s. So that would make D the correct answer.

Wait, but I think I'm confusing it with Mars. Mars' escape velocity is around 5 km/s. No, that's higher. So back to the Moon. Let me try to think: the formula is v = sqrt(2GM/R). For Earth, G is 6.674×10^-11, M_earth is about 5.97e24 kg, R is 6.37e6 m. So Earth's escape velocity is sqrt(2 * 6.67e-11 * 5.97e24 / 6.37e6) → let me compute that.

2*6.67e-11=1.334e-10; 1.334e-10 *5.97e24 → approx 7.97e14. Divide by 6.37e6 → ~1.25e8. Square root is about 1.12e4 m/s, which is 11.2 km/s. That's correct.

So for the Moon, M is about 7.34e22 kg, R is about 1.737e6 m.

Compute 2GM/R = 2 * 6.67e-11 * 7.34e22 / 1.737e6.

Calculate numerator: 2 *6.67e-11 =1.334e-10. Multiply by 7.34e22 → 1.334e-10 * 7.34e22 = approx 9.8e12.

Divide by 1.737e6 → 9.8e12 / 1.737e6 ≈ 5.64e6.

Take square root: sqrt(5.64e6) is about 2374 m/s. So approximately 2374 m/s. So the closest option is D:2380 m/s.

So the correct answer should be D.

The escape velocity is the minimum speed required for a spacecraft to break free from a celestial body's gravitational pull. It is calculated using the formula:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the celestial body, and \( R \) is its radius. For the Moon, the escape velocity depends on its mass (\( M \approx 7.347 \times 10^{22} \, \mathrm{kg} \)) and radius (\( R \approx 1.737 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m} \)).

Using the formula, the escape velocity for the Moon is approximately:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (7.347 \times 10^{22})}{1.737 \times 10^6}} \approx 2374 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

This value is closest to option D: \( 2380 \, \mathrm{m/s} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D**
