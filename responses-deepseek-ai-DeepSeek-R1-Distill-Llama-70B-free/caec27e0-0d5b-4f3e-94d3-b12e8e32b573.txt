Okay, so I've got this problem about antennas and transmitter power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my radio wave equations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two antennas 48 km apart. Both have transmitting and receiving gains of 40 dBw each. The transmitter is operating at 4 GHz, and we need to find the required transmitter power so that the received power is 10^-6 watts, which is -60 dBw. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, right, dBw is decibels relative to one watt. So when they say the gains are 40 dBw, that means each antenna's gain is 40 dB above 1 watt. But wait, wait. Oh no, wait—antenna gain is usually given in dB relative to an isotropic radiator, which is dBi, not dBw. Oh wait, the problem says dBw, so that's different. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit because I'm more familiar with dBi. But I'll proceed.

I remember the Friis Transmission Equation, which is used for calculating the received power in a communication system. The equation is:

P_r = P_t * G_t * G_r * (λ^2) / ( (4πd)^2 ) * L

Wait, but sometimes it's written without the loss factor L, assuming L is 1 for ideal conditions. So in this case, I guess we can ignore L or set it to 1.

But let me clarify the formula correctly. Another version is P_r = (P_t * G_t * G_r * λ²) / ( (4πd)^2 )

Yes, that seems right. So all right, let's note down the variables.

Given:
- P_r = 1e-6 W (since 10^-6 watts)
- G_t and G_r are the gains of the transmitting and receiving antennas, each is 40 dBw.
Wait, but in the Friis equation, the gains are unitless numbers, like 100 for 20 dB (since 10 dB is factor of 10, 20 dB is 100, etc.). But here, the gains are given in dBw, which is dB relative to 1 watt. Oh wait, no, dBw is a measure of power. So if the gain is in dBw, that's a power gain relative to 1 W. Wait, that doesn't make sense because gain is a ratio, not an absolute power.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the gains are 40 dB with respect to an isotropic radiator, which is the usual practice, but the problem mistakenly writes dBw. Or maybe it's correct and I have to account for it. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, let me think again. Antenna gain is typically expressed in dBi, which is dB relative to an isotropic radiator. So a 40 dBi gain would mean the antenna has 40 dB more gain than an isotropic antenna. But the problem states 40 dBw, which is dB relative to one watt. Wait, but that's a unit of power, not a unitless ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using dBw for the gains, which would be a bit unconventional. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they mean 40 dBi. Because dBw is about power, not gain.

Wait, maybe I should proceed assuming that the gains are 40 dB relative to an isotropic radiator, i.e., 40 dBi, because that's the standard way of expressing antenna gains for such equations. So I'll proceed with that assumption because using dBw for gain doesn't make sense otherwise.

So, G_t = G_r = 40 dBi. To convert that to absolute gain (unitless), the formula is G = 10^(dB/10). So for 40 dB, G = 10^(40/10) = 10^4 = 10,000.

Wait, no: 10^(40/10) is 10^4, which is 10,000. So each antenna has a gain of 10,000.

Next, the wavelength λ is related to the frequency. The formula is λ = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3e8 m/s) and f is the frequency in Hz.

Given f = 4 GHz = 4e9 Hz.

So λ = 3e8 m/s / 4e9 Hz = (3/4) * 1e-1 m = 0.75 * 0.1 m = 0.075 meters, or 7.5 cm.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 3e8 divided by 4e9 is (3/4) * (1e8 / 1e9) )= (0.75) * (1e-1) )= 0.075 m. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the distance d between the antennas is 48 km, which is 48,000 meters.

Putting it all into the Friis equation:

P_r = (P_t * G_t * G_r * λ²) / ( (4πd)^2 )

We can rearrange this to solve for P_t, which is the transmitter power we're trying to find.

So,

P_t = P_r * (4πd)^2 / (G_t * G_r * λ² )

Plugging in the numbers:

P_r = 1e-6 W

G_t = G_r = 1e4 (from 40 dB, which is 10^4)

λ = 0.075 m

d = 48,000 m

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (4πd)^2:

4 * π * 48,000 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 48e3 ≈ let's compute that. 4 * 3.1416 is about 12.5664. Multiply by 48,000: 12.5664 * 48,000 = ?

12.5664 * 48,000 = 12.5664 * 4.8e4 = approximately 12.5664 * 4.8 = let's compute 12 *4.8=57.6, 0.5664*4.8≈2.718, so total ≈57.6+2.718=60.318. Then multiply by 1e4, so 60.318e4 = 6.0318e5 meters.

Wait, wait, wait, that's the value of 4πd, but we need to square it. So (4πd)^2 is (6.0318e5)^2.

Wait, 6.0318e5 meters. So (6.0318e5)^2 = (6.0318)^2 * (1e5)^2. 6.0318 squared is approximately 36.383. So 36.383 * (1e10) = 3.6383e11.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me compute 4πd again more accurately. 4 * π is about 12.566370614. Multiply by 48,000 meters:

12.566370614 * 48,000 = Let's compute 12 *48,000 = 576,000. 0.566370614 *48,000 ≈ 0.56637 *48,000.

0.5 *48,000 =24,000. 0.06637 *48,000≈3,185. So total is 24,000 +3,185=27,185. So 12.56637 *48,000≈576,000 +27,185=603,185 meters. So 4πd ≈603,185 meters.

So (4πd)^2 ≈ (603,185)^2. Let me compute that.

603,185 squared: Let's approximate. 600,000 squared is 3.6e11. Now, 603,185 = 600,000 +3,185.

So (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

a=6e5, b=3,185.

a² = (6e5)^2 = 3.6e11.

2ab = 2 *6e5 *3,185 = 12e5 *3,185 = 12e5 *3e3 is 3.6e9, and 12e5 *185= 2.22e8. So 3.6e9 + 0.222e9=3.822e9.

b²= (3,185)^2. Let's see. 3,000 squared is 9e6, 185 squared is 34,225, and 2*3,000*185=1,110,000. So total (3,185)^2=9e6 +1.11e6 + 0.034225e6≈10.134225e6.

So all together, (603,185)^2 ≈3.6e11 +3.822e9 +1.0134225e7. Let's compute each term:

3.6e11 = 360,000,000,000

3.822e9 = 3,822,000,000

1.0134225e7 = ~10,134,225.

Adding them together:

360,000,000,000 + 3,822,000,000 = 363,822,000,000

Plus 10,134,225 gives 363,832,134,225.

So approximately 3.638e11 (since 363,832,134,225 is about 3.638e11).

Wait, earlier I had 3.6383e11, which matches, so that's correct.

Now, the denominator is G_t * G_r * λ².

G_t and G_r are each 1e4, so their product is 1e8.

λ is 0.075 m, so λ squared is (0.075)^2 = 0.005625 m².

So denominator is 1e8 * 0.005625 = 1e8 * 5.625e-3 = 5.625e5.

So denominator is 5.625e5.

So now, putting it all together:

P_t = P_r * ( (4πd)^2 ) / (G_t G_r λ² )

P_t = (1e-6 W) * (3.638e11) / (5.625e5 )

Let me compute the division first: 3.638e11 / 5.625e5.

3.638e11 /5.625e5 = (3.638 /5.625 ) * 1e6.

3.638 ÷5.625. Let's compute that.

5.625 goes into 3.638 how many times? 5.625 is larger than 3.638, so less than 1. Let's compute 3.638 /5.625.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 3638 /5625.

Approximate: 5625 goes into 3638 zero times. Let's compute 0.6 times 5625 is 3375. 0.64 *5625 = 3600. 0.64 *5625 = 5625*(64/100)=5625*0.64= 5625*0.6=3375 + 5625*0.04=225 → 3375+225=3600.

Wait, 0.64 *5625=3600. But 3.638 is 3.638, wait wait, no, sorry, wait 3.638 was in terms of 3.638e11 divided by 5.625e5, which becomes (3.638/5.625) * 1e6.

Wait, but 3.638 /5.625 is approximately 0.6477.

Wait, let me compute 5.625 × 0.6477.

5 ×0.6477=3.2385

0.625 ×0.6477=0.4048

Total is 3.2385 +0.4048=3.6433, which is a bit more than 3.638, so perhaps 0.647 would be better.

Wait, perhaps 0.647 *5.625 = ?

5 *0.647=3.235

0.625 *0.647=0.404375

Total 3.235+0.404375=3.639375, which is very close to 3.638. So 3.638 /5.625 ≈0.647.

So 3.638e11 /5.625e5 = 0.647 * 1e6 = 6.47e5.

So now, P_t = 1e-6 W * 6.47e5.

Multiply 1e-6 by 6.47e5: 1e-6 *6.47e5 = 6.47e-1 = 0.647 watts.

Wait, that's 0.647 W. So looking at the options, option F is 0.647 watts, option J is 0.747, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake when doing the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, I assumed that the gains were 40 dBi, converting to 1e4. But the problem states 40 dBw. If that's the case, perhaps I should use dBw correctly. Wait, but dBw is a power ratio relative to 1 watt. So if the gain is in dBw, that would imply that the gain is expressed as 10^(dBw/10) in watts. Wait no, that doesn't make sense because gain is unitless. So perhaps the problem meant that the gains are 40 dB relative to 1 W, but that's not standard. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, if the gains are given in dBw, then the gain G is 10^(40/10) = 10^4 = 10000, which is the same as assuming 40 dBi. Because dBw for power is 10 dB per decade, but for gains, it's the same as dBi because the reference is 1 W, which for antennas is the same as an isotropic radiator's power.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Antenna gain in dB is usually relative to an isotropic radiator, which has a gain of 1 (0 dB). So when they say 40 dBw, perhaps it's dB relative to 1 W of power. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense for gain, which is a ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake and meant 40 dBi, which would make the Friis equation work as I did before. So with that, I got P_t = 0.647 W, which is option F.

But wait, let me verify the calculation again step by step to make sure I didn't make any errors.

So, P_r =1e-6 W.

G_t and G_r each are 1e4 (from 40 dB), so product is 1e8.

λ =0.075 m.

d=48 km=48,000 m.

Compute (4πd)^2: 4π*48,000=603,185.8 m. Squared is (603,185.8)^2 ≈3.638e11 m².

λ squared is (0.075)^2=0.005625 m².

Denominator: 1e8 *0.005625 =5.625e5.

Numerator: 1e-6 *3.638e11 =3.638e5.

So P_t = (3.638e5) / (5.625e5) )= 3.638 /5.625 ≈0.647 W.

So that gives 0.647 W, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 0.747, which is close but not exactly. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (4πd)^2. Let me re-calculate that.

4πd: 4 * π *48,000 = 4 * π *4.8e4 = (4 *4.8) * π *1e4. 4*4.8=19.2, so 19.2 * π *1e4. 19.2 * π ≈60.3198. So 60.3198e4 m, which is 603,198 m.

So (603,198)^2 = ?

Let me compute 603,198 squared more accurately.

603,198 *603,198:

Let me break it into (600,000 +3,198)^2.

=600,000^2 + 2*600,000*3,198 +3,198^2.

600,000^2=3.6e11.

2*600,000*3,198=1.2e6 *3,198= let's compute 1.2e6 *3,000=3.6e9, and 1.2e6 *198=237.6e6=2.376e8. So total is 3.6e9 +2.376e8=3.8376e9.

3,198^2= let's compute (3,200 -2)^2=3,200^2 -2*3,200*2 +2^2=10,240,000 -12,800 +4=10,227,204.

Now, add all three terms:

3.6e11 +3.8376e9 +1.0227204e7.

Convert all to same exponent. 3.6e11 is 360,000,000,000.

3.8376e9 is 3,837,600,000.

1.0227204e7 is 10,227,204.

Adding them together:

360,000,000,000

+  3,837,600,000

=363,837,600,000

+      10,227,204

=363,837,610,227,204? Wait, no, wait, 363,837,600,000 +10,227,204 =363,847,827,204.

Wait, perhaps I should represent them properly:

360,000,000,000

+ 3,837,600,000 → 363,837,600,000.

Then +10,227,204 → 363,837,600,000 +10,227,204 =363,847,827,204.

So (603,198)^2 ≈3.6384782704e11 m².

So that's more precise. Now, the denominator is G_t * G_r * λ² = 1e4 *
