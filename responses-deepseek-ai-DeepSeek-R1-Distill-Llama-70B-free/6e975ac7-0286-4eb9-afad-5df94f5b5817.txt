Okay, so I've got this problem here about heating water, and I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. The question is: How many calories of heat must be added to 3.0 liters of water to raise the temperature from 20°C to 80°C? The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that the calorie is a unit of energy, and when dealing with heating water, it's about specific heat capacity. Oh right, the formula is Q = m * c * ΔT. Q is the heat energy, m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives me volume in liters. So I need to convert that to mass because the formula uses mass. I recall that 1 liter of water is approximately 1 kilogram. So 3 liters would be 3 kg. That makes sense.

Now, the specific heat capacity of water. I think it's 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. Oh wait, or is it per kilogram? Wait, I'm getting confused. Oh right, the specific heat capacity (c) for water is 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. So for 1 kg, which is 1000 grams, it would be 1000 calories per kg per degree. Because 1 kg = 1000 g, so 1 kg·°C = 1000 cal/(kg·°C).

Now, the temperature change ΔT is the final temperature minus initial. So 80°C minus 20°C is 60°C. So ΔT is 60 degrees.

Putting it all together: Q = m * c * ΔT. So m is 3 kg, c is 1000 cal/(kg·°C), and ΔT is 60°C. So Q = 3 * 1000 * 60.

Wait, let me calculate that. 3 times 1000 is 3000, multiplied by 60 is 180,000 calories. Wait, but wait, the options are in Kcal. Oh, right, 1 Kcal is 1000 calories. So 180,000 calories is 180 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option H is 300 Kcal, which is higher. Option D is 180 Kcal. So D seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. 3 liters is 3 kg, right? Yes. Specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C, so 1 cal per gram. So for 3 kg (3000 grams), each gram needs 60 calories to rise 60 degrees. So 3000 grams * 60 cal/gram = 180,000 calories, which is 180 Kcal. Yep, that's D.

So I think the answer is D.

To determine how many calories of heat must be added to 3.0 liters of water to raise its temperature from 20°C to 80°C, we use the formula for heat energy:

\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:  
- \( m \) is the mass of the water,  
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of water,  
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.  

1. **Convert volume to mass**: Since 1 liter of water is approximately 1 kilogram, 3.0 liters of water corresponds to \( m = 3.0 \, \text{kg} \).  
2. **Specific heat capacity of water**: The specific heat capacity of water is \( c = 1000 \, \text{cal/(kg} \cdot \degree \text{C)} \).  
3. **Temperature change**: The temperature increases from 20°C to 80°C, so \( \Delta T = 80 - 20 = 60 \, \degree \text{C} \).  

Substituting these values into the formula:  
\[
Q = 3.0 \, \text{kg} \cdot 1000 \, \text{cal/(kg} \cdot \degree \text{C)} \cdot 60 \, \degree \text{C} = 180,000 \, \text{calories}.
\]  

Since \( 1 \, \text{Kcal} = 1000 \, \text{calories} \), we convert:  
\[
Q = 180,000 \, \text{calories} = 180 \, \text{Kcal}.
\]  

Thus, the correct answer is **D: 180 Kcal**.
