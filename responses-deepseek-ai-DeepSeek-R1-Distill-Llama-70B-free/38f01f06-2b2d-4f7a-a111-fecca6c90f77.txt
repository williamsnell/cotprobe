Okay, so I've got this question about the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and which phrase doesn't fit with legitimacy in the new terminology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I need to understand what RMA is about. From what I remember, RMA refers to the transformation in military strategy, tactics, and technology that leads to significant changes in the nature of warfare. It often involves the use of advanced technologies like precision-guided weapons, smart systems, and network-centric warfare. The idea is to make military actions more effective and perhaps more acceptable in terms of minimizing casualties and collateral damage.

So the question is asking which of the options is NOT likely to indicate legitimacy in this new terminology. Legitimacy here probably refers to terms that are considered acceptable, modern, or aligned with the RMA's focus on precision and minimizing unintended harm.

Let's go through each option:

A: Indiscriminate attack. That sounds like the opposite of precision. Indiscriminate means not targeted, so it's likely causing more civilian casualties or damage. RMA would probably move away from this because it's less precise and could lead to more collateral damage, which is not seen as legitimate in modern warfare.

B: Precision target. That fits with RMA because it's about accuracy and targeting specific points, reducing collateral damage.

C: Guided missile. Definitely part of RMA, as guided missiles are more precise than unguided ones.

D: Smart bomb. Smart bombs are a classic example of precision-guided munitions, so this is RMA terminology.

E: Precision-guided munition. Again, this is exactly what RMA emphasizesâ€”precision to hit targets accurately.

F: Intelligent warfare. This sounds like it's using advanced, smart systems, so it fits with RMA.

G: Strategic bombardment. Hmm, strategic bombardment can be a bit ambiguous. It's a broader term that might refer to large-scale bombing campaigns, which could be less precise, but I'm not sure if it's necessarily excluded from RMA. Or maybe it's more associated with older strategies.

H: Collateral damage control. This is about minimizing unintended damage, which aligns with RMA's goals, so it's likely a legitimate term.

I: Surgical strike. That's a term used for very precise attacks that minimize collateral damage, fitting RMA perfectly.

J: Stealth technology. Stealth is about avoiding detection, which is a key part of modern military tech, so it's part of RMA.

So the options that stand out as not fitting are A and G. A is definitely about not being precise, which RMA would not support. G, strategic bombardment, might still be used but perhaps in a more targeted way. But I'm trying to think which one is less likely to indicate legitimacy.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT likely to indicate legitimacy. So if RMA focuses on precision and minimizing damage, terms that imply the opposite would not be legitimate.

"Indiscriminate attack" is clearly the opposite of precision. So A is the answer.

The correct answer is A: Indiscriminate attack. This phrase does not align with the legitimacy emphasized by the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), which focuses on precision, minimizing collateral damage, and advanced technologies. Indiscriminate attacks are the opposite of RMA's principles, as they lack targeting precision and are likely to cause unintended harm.

Answer: A
