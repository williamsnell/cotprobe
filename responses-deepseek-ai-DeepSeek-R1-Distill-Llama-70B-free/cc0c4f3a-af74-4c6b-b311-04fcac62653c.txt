Question:

A vacationer, on a winter ski holiday, visited a ski lift in a private park. The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward. When the employee returned and sized up the situation, he threw the switch, stopping the lift. The vacationer, severely bruised and badly frightened, jumped off the ski lift and completed his descent by foot. In a personal injury action by the vacationer against the owner of the private park, the vacationer will rely on the concept of

Options:

A: vicarious liability.
B: negligence per se.
C: imputed negligence.
D: comparative negligence.
E: assumption of risk.
F: joint venture.
G: strict liability.
H: premises liability.
I: respondeat superior.
J: contributory negligence.

Okay, so I just came across this legal question, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The scenario involves a vacationer who gets injured on a ski lift. The ski lift is operated by a company that has a concession agreement with the private park owner. The vacationer is suing the park owner, so the question is about which legal concept they'll rely on.

First, I need to understand the setup. The private park charges a $5 entry fee for activities like ice skating, etc., and an extra $7 for the ski lift. The ski lift company pays the park owner a rental plus 15% of their proceeds. So, the park owner isn't directly running the ski lift; it's a separate company.

Now, the incident: the vacationer is the only passenger late in the afternoon. The top employee leaves to use the bathroom and asks his friend to watch the lift. Instead of stopping the lift to let the vacationer off, the friend lets it continue, causing the vacationer to swing violently. The employee stops it when he returns, but the vacationer is already hurt.

The question is about the cause of action against the park owner. So, what's the possible liability here?

Looking at the options, the main ones that come to mind are vicarious liability, respondeat superior, or maybe premises liability.

Vicarious liability is when an employer is liable for an employee's actions. But here, the ski lift employees are employed by the company, not the park owner. So the park owner isn't their employer.

Respondeat superior is similarâ€”it's the doctrine that makes employers liable for their employees' negligent acts. Again, same issue as vicarious liability; the employees aren't the park owner's staff.

Then there's premises liability, which holds property owners responsible for injuries on their property due to unsafe conditions. But in this case, the injury was due to the operation of the ski lift, not a condition of the premises itself.

Wait, but maybe the park owner can be held liable under another theory. Sometimes, when a business is run on someone's property, the property owner might be liable if they have control over the operations or if there's a joint venture.

Looking at the concession agreement, the ski lift company pays the park owner a rental plus a percentage of proceeds. This suggests some form of partnership or joint venture. If the park owner is in a joint venture with the ski lift company, they might share liability for each other's actions.

Alternatively, the concept of respondeat superior might come into play if the park owner had control over the ski lift operations. But the question says the ski lift was installed and operated by the company, so the park owner probably doesn't have direct control.

Another angle: the friend who was asked to watch the lift wasn't an employee. So the employee (from the ski lift company) asked a friend to take over temporarily. If the friend is considered an employee, then the company could be vicariously liable. But the park owner's liability would depend on whether they are part of the same venture.

Wait, another concept is "joint venture." If the park owner and the ski lift company are engaged in a joint venture, then each could be liable for the other's actions. The question is whether their arrangement constitutes a joint venture.

Factors for joint venture include shared management, right to direct, and sharing profits. The park owner gets a percentage of the net proceeds, which indicates a profit-sharing arrangement. They might have some level of control, but it's not clear if they have the right to direct the ski lift operations.

If it's a joint venture, then the park owner could be vicariously liable for the ski lift company's employees' negligence. So, the vacationer might sue the park owner under the theory of joint venture, making option F the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the park owner is liable under premises liability. But premises liability usually involves the condition of the property, not the operations of a concession. Unless the park owner had a duty to ensure the concession was operated safely, but that might be stretching it.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a property owner leases to a concession, they can be liable if they retain some control over the premises or if the concession's activities are inherently dangerous. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Looking back at the options, option F is joint venture. If the park owner and the ski lift company are in a joint venture, then the doctrine of respondeat superior could apply between them, making each liable for the other's employees' actions.

So, putting it all together, the vacationer would likely argue that the park owner is part of a joint venture with the ski lift company. Therefore, the park owner is liable for the company's employee's negligence. That would point to option F: joint venture.

The question revolves around determining the legal concept under which the vacationer can hold the private park owner liable for injuries sustained on a ski lift operated by a concessionaire. The ski lift company, not the park owner, employs the operators, and the park owner receives a rental plus a percentage of the proceeds from the lift. The injury occurred due to the negligence of the ski lift employee and a friend who was temporarily operating the lift.

Key considerations include:

1. **Vicarious Liability and Respondeat Superior**: These doctrines typically apply when an employer is liable for an employee's actions. However, the ski lift employees are not employed by the park owner, making these doctrines inapplicable to the park owner directly.

2. **Premises Liability**: This typically involves liability for unsafe conditions on the property. However, the injury here arose from the operation of the ski lift, not a condition of the premises, making this less relevant.

3. **Joint Venture**: If the park owner and the ski lift company are engaged in a joint venture, the park owner could be liable for the company's actions. A joint venture involves shared management, control, and profit-sharing. The park owner's receipt of a percentage of the proceeds suggests a profit-sharing arrangement, and the concession agreement could imply some level of shared control over the operation. If the relationship constitutes a joint venture, the park owner could be vicariously liable for the ski lift company's employees' negligence.

Given the facts, the most plausible legal theory is that the park owner and the ski lift company are engaged in a joint venture, making the park owner liable for the actions of the ski lift company's employees.
