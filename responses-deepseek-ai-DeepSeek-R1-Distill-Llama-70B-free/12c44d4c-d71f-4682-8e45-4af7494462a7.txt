Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem states that a chemist mixes 0.5 moles of acetic acid (HC2H3O2) and 0.5 moles of HCN in enough water to make a one-liter solution. I need to calculate the final concentrations of H3O+ and OH- ions. They've given me the Ka values for both acids and the Kw for water at 25°C, which is 1.0e-14.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with weak acids, each will contribute to the H3O+ concentration, but since they're both in the same solution, their contributions might combine. But wait, which one is stronger? Let's look at the Ka values. Acetic acid has a Ka of 1.8e-5, and HCN has a Ka of 4e-10. Oh, right, so acetic acid is a stronger acid than HCN. That means it will dissociate more, contributing more H3O+ ions compared to HCN. So I can probably ignore the contribution from HCN because it's much weaker.

But wait, I shouldn't just ignore it completely. Maybe I should check if the H+ from HCN is significant, but considering that HCN's Ka is so small, maybe its contribution is negligible. Let's think: If both are 0.5 M, then the stronger acid (acetic) will dominate. So the H3O+ concentration will come primarily from acetic acid.

So, I can model this by treating the solution as a solution of a weak acid (acetic), and then see if the other acid contributes anything. Wait, but when two acids are present, do their H+ concentrations add? Or is it more complicated because of the common ion effect?

Wait, I think the H+ from both acids will contribute, but since acetic acid is much stronger, the H+ from HCN is probably negligible. Let me double-check that.

First, I'll calculate the H3O+ from acetic acid. The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.5 M in 1 L, so 0.5 M. The dissociation is HC2H3O2 ↔ H+ + C2H3O2^-.

The Ka for acetic acid is 1.8e-5. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
[HC2H3O2] = 0.5 M
[H3O+] = 0
[C2H3O2^-] = 0

Change:
HC2H3O2 dissociates by x, so [H+] becomes x, [C2H3O2^-] becomes x.

At equilibrium:
[HC2H3O2] = 0.5 - x
[H3O+] = x
[C2H3O2^-] = x

Ka = (x^2)/(0.5 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Since Ka is small, x will be much smaller than 0.5, so 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5. So:

x^2 ≈ 1.8e-5 * 0.5
x^2 ≈ 9e-6
x ≈ sqrt(9e-6) = 3e-3 M.

So [H3O+] from acetic acid is approximately 3e-3 M.

Now, what about HCN? Its Ka is 4e-10, which is much smaller. Let's see if its dissociation contributes anything significant.

The initial concentration of HCN is 0.5 M. Its dissociation is HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-.

The Ka expression is ( [H+][CN^-] ) / [HCN] = 4e-10.

But here, the [H+] is already 3e-3 from acetic acid, so when HCN dissociates, it's in a solution where [H+] is already higher than what it would produce. Let me think: let the change be y, so [H+] from HCN is y. But since [H+] is already 3e-3, the total would be 3e-3 + y. But y is probably negligible. Let's calculate y.

Ka = ( (3e-3 + y) * y ) / (0.5 - y) ≈ (3e-3 * y) / 0.5, since y is much less than 3e-3 and 0.5.

So, 4e-10 ≈ (3e-3 * y) / 0.5
=> y ≈ (4e-10 * 0.5) / 3e-3
y ≈ (2e-10) / 3e-3 ≈ 6.67e-8 M.

So the contribution from HCN is about 6.67e-8 M. Compared to 3e-3 M from acetic acid, which is about 4500 times larger. So the H+ from HCN is negligible, and the total [H3O+] is approximately 3.0e-3 M, just from acetic acid.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the solution more acidic than each individual acid? Or is there a way that the presence of two acids affects each other? Hmm, I think in this case, since HCN is a much weaker acid, its contribution to H+ is minimal, so it's safe to ignore.

So now, I can find [H3O+] = 3e-3 M.

Then, the [OH-] can be found using Kw = [H3O+][OH-] = 1e-14.

So [OH-] = 1e-14 / 3e-3 ≈ 3.33e-12 M.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option A: [H3O+] = 3.0e-3, [OH-] = 3.3e-12 → This matches exactly.

Option F: [H3O+] 1.8e-3, [OH-] 5.6e-12 → Doesn't match.

Option B: [H3O+] 9e-6, which is lower than what we found.

Hmm, so the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, let me check my calculation again. Because sometimes when two acids are present, but one is much stronger, the weaker one's contribution is negligible. But perhaps there's another effect.

Wait, another approach: since both are weak acids, perhaps their dissociations are independent. But in reality, the presence of H+ from the stronger acid will suppress the dissociation of the weaker acid. Because Le Chatelier's principle says that adding H+ will shift the equilibrium of HCN's dissociation to the left, reducing y even further.

Wait, in my initial calculation for HCN, I considered that [H+] is 3e-3, which makes y about 6.67e-8. But perhaps that's an overestimation because I assumed [H+] is 3e-3. But let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should set up the problem more accurately. Let me let [H+] = x from acetic acid, and y from HCN. But that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the H+ comes from both, but as one is much more significant, the other is negligible.

Wait, but I think that the initial approach was correct. So the [H3O+] is dominated by acetic acid, and the OH- is 1e-14 divided by that.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option F has [H3O+] 1.8e-3, which is the square root of (1.8e-5 * 0.5), but wait, no, 1.8e-5 is the Ka. Let me think, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the initial setup for acetic acid:

Ka = x²/(0.5 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Assuming x << 0.5, so 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5.

x² = 1.8e-5 * 0.5 → 9e-6 → x = 3e-3. So that's correct.

But why is option F's [H3O+] 1.8e-3? Because 1.8e-5 is the Ka, but that's not the concentration. Oh wait, no, because sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.5) is sqrt(9e-6)=3e-3, which matches option A.

So yes, I think the correct answer is option A: [H3O+] = 3e-3 M, [OH-] = 3.3e-12 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is [H3O+] =1.8e-3, which would be if x was sqrt( (1.8e-5) * 0.5 )? No, because (1.8e-5)*0.5 is 9e-6, so square root is 3e-3.

So no, option A is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the dissociation of the two weak acids, acetic acid (HC₂H₃O₂) and HCN, in water. The goal is to determine the final concentrations of H₃O⁺ and OH⁻ ions.

### Key Steps:
1. **Identify the stronger acid**:  
   Acetic acid has a larger Ka (1.8 × 10⁻⁵) compared to HCN (4 × 10⁻¹⁰), meaning it dissociates more extensively and contributes most of the H₃O⁺ ions. The contribution from HCN is negligible due to its much smaller Ka.

2. **Calculate [H₃O⁺] from acetic acid**:  
   Using the Ka expression for acetic acid:  
   \[
   \text{Ka} = \frac{[H₃O⁺]^2}{[HC₂H₃O₂] - [H₃O⁺]}
   \]  
   Let \([H₃O⁺] = x\). Since \(x \ll 0.5\), we approximate \([HC₂H₃O₂] - x \approx 0.5\). Solving:  
   \[
   x^2 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.5) = 9 \times 10^{-6}
   \]  
   \[
   x = \sqrt{9 \times 10^{-6}} = 3.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]  
   Thus, \([H₃O⁺] = 3.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\).

3. **Calculate [OH⁻] using \(K_w\)**:  
   From the relationship \(K_w = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻]\):  
   \[
   [OH⁻] = \frac{K_w}{[H₃O⁺]} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{3.0 \times 10^{-3}} = 3.3 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Verify the contribution of HCN**:  
   The dissociation of HCN is suppressed by the high \([H₃O⁺]\) from acetic acid (Le Chatelier's principle). Calculations show that the additional H₃O⁺ from HCN is negligible (\(\approx 6.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\)), confirming that acetic acid dominates.

### Final Answer:
The concentrations are \([H₃O⁺] = 3.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\) and \([OH⁻] = 3.3 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}\), which matches **Option A**.
