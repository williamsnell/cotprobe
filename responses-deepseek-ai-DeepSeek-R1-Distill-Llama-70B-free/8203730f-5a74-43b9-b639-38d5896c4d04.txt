Okay, so I've got this physics question here about rotational motion. Hmm, let me think about it. The question is about what happens to the angular momentum when a spinning system contracts without any external torque. I remember that angular momentum has something to do with rotation and torque.

Wait, angular momentum (L) is given by the formula L = Iω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity. So if the system contracts, like maybe it's a figure skater pulling their arms in, the moment of inertia decreases because I depends on the mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation. For a solid sphere, I is (2/5)MR², so as the radius R decreases, I goes down.

Now, when I decreases, what happens to ω? Oh right, if there's no external torque, the angular momentum stays the same because torque is the rate of change of angular momentum. So torque is zero, so dL/dt is zero, meaning L is constant. 

So if L is Iω and L is constant, then if I decreases, ω must increase. That makes sense because when the figure skater pulls their arms in, they spin faster. So in the question, the rotational speed increases, which aligns with that.

The question is about what happens to angular momentum in this case. Since no external torque is applied, angular momentum should remain unchanged. So looking at the options, option D says 'remains unchanged.' That must be the correct answer.

The other options: A and B are about halving or doubling, which doesn't fit because L is conserved. C says it's transferred to linear momentum, but that would require some external force, I think. E says it becomes zero, which doesn't make sense unless something stops the rotation. F depends on mass, but L depends on I and ω, so F isn't right. G and H are about increasing or decreasing, but that's not the case when there's no torque. I says it may vary, but no, it's a specific scenario. J is about unpredictability, which isn't applicable here.

When a spinning system contracts in the absence of an external torque, its angular momentum remains unchanged. This is because angular momentum (L) is defined as \( L = I\omega \), where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. If the system contracts, the moment of inertia \( I \) decreases, but since there is no external torque, angular momentum is conserved. To conserve \( L \), the angular velocity \( \omega \) increases as \( I \) decreases.

Analyzing the options:
- **A (halves)** and **B (doubles)** are incorrect because angular momentum does not change in this scenario.
- **C (is transferred to linear momentum)** is incorrect because no external force or torque acts on the system to facilitate such a transfer.
- **D (remains unchanged)** is correct because angular momentum is conserved in the absence of external torque.
- **E (becomes zero)** is incorrect as there is no mechanism to bring the rotation to a stop.
- **F (varies depending on the mass of the system)** is incorrect because angular momentum conservation depends on the absence of external torque, not the mass.
- **G (increases)** and **H (decreases)** are incorrect because angular momentum remains constant.
- **I (may increase or decrease)** is incorrect because angular momentum is conserved in this specific scenario.
- **J (becomes unpredictable)** is incorrect because the behavior is predictable based on conservation laws.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D
