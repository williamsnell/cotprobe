Okay, so I've got this problem here about valuing a stock using the dividend discount model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that Lore Ltd. has a current dividend of $14, and the dividends are expected to grow at 13% per year for the next five years. After that, the growth rate drops to a sustainable 5% indefinitely. The required rate of return is 12%. I need to find the fair value of the stock today.

Alright, I remember that this is a two-stage dividend discount model problem. The first stage is the high growth period, and the second stage is the stable growth period. So, I'll need to calculate the present value of the dividends for the first five years and the present value of the stock price at the end of five years.

Let me break it down. First, I'll calculate the dividends for each of the next five years. The current dividend is $14, so next year's dividend will be 14 * (1 + 0.13) = 14 * 1.13. Let me compute that: 14 * 1.13 is 15.82. Then the following year would be 15.82 * 1.13, and so on for five years.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each year's dividend individually. Let's see:

Year 1: 14 * (1.13) = 15.82
Year 2: 15.82 * 1.13 = let's calculate: 15.82 * 1.13. 15 *1.13 is 16.95, 0.82*1.13 is ~0.9266, so total about 17.8766, say 17.88.
Year 3: 17.88 *1.13. Let's compute 17 *1.13 is 19.21, 0.88 *1.13 is ~1. (0.88*1=0.88, 0.88*0.13=0.1144; total 0.9944). So total year3 div is about 19.21 + 0.9944 = 20.2044.

Wait maybe I should do precise math here.

Alternatively, I can represent each year's dividend as D0*(1+g)^n, where g is 13% or 0.13.

So D1 = 14 * (1.13)^1
D2 =14*(1.13)^2
D3=14*(1.13)^3
D4=14*(1.13)^4
D5=14*(1.13)^5

Then, each of these dividends needs to be discounted back to the present using the required return of 12% (0.12). So present value of each dividend is Dn/(1.12)^n.

Wait, but wait, the current year is year 0, so next year is year 1.

So the present value of D1 is D1/(1.12)^1, D2 is D2/(1.12)^2, and so on until D5.

After year 5, the dividends will grow at 5% forever. So the dividend in year 6 would be D5 * (1.05). Then, the stock price at year 5 (P5) can be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model (or perpetual growth model), which is D6/(r - g), where r is the required return (12%) and g is the perpetual growth rate (5%).

So P5 = D6 / (0.12 - 0.05) = D6 / 0.07.

But since P5 is the price at year 5, I need to discount it back to the present. So the present value of P5 is P5/(1.12)^5.

So the total value of the stock today is the sum of the present values of D1 to D5 plus the present value of P5.

Let me structure this:

PV = D1/(1.12)^1 + D2/(1.12)^2 + D3/(1.12)^3 + D4/(1.12)^4 + D5/(1.12)^5 + P5/(1.12)^5.

Alternatively, I can compute each term separately.

First, calculate each D:

D0 = 14.

D1 = 14 * 1.13 = 15.82.

D2 = 15.82 *1.13 = let's compute accurately:

15.82 *1.13:
15 *1.13 =16.95
0.82 *1.13: 0.82*1=0.82, 0.82*.13=0.1066 → total 0.9266.
So D2=16.95 + 0.9266=17.8766 ≈17.8766.

D3=17.8766 *1.13: Let me compute this.

17 *1.13=19.21.
0.8766 *1.13: 0.8 *1.13=0.904, 0.0766*1.13≈0.0865 → total ≈0.9905.
So D3≈19.21 +0.9905≈20.2005 ≈20.2005.

D4=20.2005 *1.13. Let's calculate:

20 *1.13=22.6.
0.2005*1.13≈0.2005*1=0.2005, 0.2005*0.13≈0.02606 → total≈0.22656.
So D4≈22.6 +0.22656 ≈22.82656.

D5=22.82656 *1.13.

22*1.13=24.86.
0.82656 *1.13: Let's approximate.
0.8 *1.13=0.904.
0.02656*1.13≈0.03.
So 0.904 +0.03=0.934.
So D5≈24.86 +0.934=25.794.

Now, calculating D6 for the terminal value.

D6 = D5 *1.05 =25.794 *1.05.

25 *1.05=26.25.
0.794 *1.05: 0.794*1=0.794, 0.794*0.05=0.0397 → total≈0.8337.
So D6≈26.25 +0.8337≈27.0837.

Now, compute P5, the stock price at year 5: D6/(0.12-0.05)=27.0837 /0.07.

Let me compute that: 27.0837 /0.07.

27 /0.07 is about 385.714 (since 0.07*385=26.95). So 27.0837 is a bit more. 27.0837 /0.07 = approximately 386.91.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

27.0837 / 0.07 = 27.0837 * (1/0.07) = 27.0837 * approx 14.2857.

Compute 27 *14.2857 → 27*(14 + 2/7) → 27*14=378, 27*(2/7)=7.714 → total 385.714.

Now 0.0837 *14.2857 → approx 0.0837 *14 ≈1.1718, 0.0837*0.2857≈0.0239 → total ≈1.1957.

So total P5≈385.714 +1.1957≈386.9097 → approximately 386.91.

But wait, I think I might have miscalculated D6. Let me recheck.

Wait D5 is 25.794, so D6 =25.794 *1.05.

25.794 *1.05: 25 *1.05=26.25, 0.794 *1.05=0.8337 → so 26.25 +0.8337=27.0837. That's correct.

So P5=27.0837 /0.07 → 27.0837 /0.07 = 386.91.

Now, I need to discount P5 back to the present. So P5's present value is 386.91 / (1.12)^5.

What's (1.12)^5? Let's compute that.

1.12^1=1.12

1.12^2=1.2544

1.12^3=1.4049 (approx, because 1.2544 *1.12=1.404928)

1.12^4=1.404928 *1.12 → 1.5718 (approx)

1.12^5=1.5718 *1.12 → approx 1.7623.

Alternatively, more accurately:

1.12^1 = 1.12

1.12^2 = 1.2544

1.12^3 = 1.2544 *1.12 = 1.404928

1.12^4 =1.404928 *1.12 → let's compute:

1.404928 * 1.12:

1*1.12=1.12

0.404928 *1.12:

0.4 *1.12=0.448

0.004928 *1.12≈0.00522

So 0.448 +0.00522 ≈0.45322.

So 1.12 + 0.45322 = 1.57322.

So 1.12^4≈1.57322.

1.12^5 = 1.57322 *1.12 → let's compute:

1.57322 *1 =1.57322

1.57322 *0.12=0.188787

So total is 1.57322 +0.188787=1.761007.

So (1.12)^5≈1.761.

So PV of P5 is 386.91 /1.761007 → let me compute that.

386.91 /1.761 ≈ let's see, 1.761 * 220 = 387.72. That's very close to 386.91. So it's approximately 220 - (387.72 -386.91)/1.761.

Wait, 1.761 *220 = 387.72. But our numerator is 386.91, which is 0.81 less than 387.72. So how much less than 220 is it?

Since 1.761 per unit, 0.81 /1.761 ≈ 0.46. So approximately 220 -0.46=219.54.

Wait, more accurately: 386.91 /1.761 → let me compute 386.91 ÷ 1.761.

Let me set it up as 386.91 ÷1.761.

Approximate:

1.761 * 219 = ?

Compute 200 *1.761=352.2

19 *1.761=33.459

So total 352.2 +33.459=385.659.

That's 385.659, which is less than 386.91 by about 1.251.

So 219 gives 385.659. Now, how much more do we need to reach 386.91?

1.761 * x =1.251 → x≈1.251/1.761 ≈0.71.

So 219.71 → let's say approximately 219.71.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 386.91 /1.761.

Let me use a calculator-like approach.

1.761 × 219 → as above, 385.659.

386.91 -385.659=1.251.

So the remaining 1.251 is divided by 1.761, which is approximately 0.71.

So the total is 219.71.

Wait, but 1.761 *219.71=?

219 *1.761=385.659.

0.71 *1.761≈1.251.

So total 385.659 +1.251≈386.91. Perfect.

So PV of P5≈219.71.

Now, I need to compute the present value of each dividend:

PV of D1:15.82 /1.12 = ?

15.82 /1.12 → 14.117. Wait, 1.12 *14=15.68 → 15.82-15.68=0.14 → 0.14/1.12≈0.125 → so 14.125.

So approximately 14.125.

PV of D2:17.8766 /(1.12)^2 → denominator is 1.2544.

17.8766 /1.2544 → let's compute:

1.2544 ×14.25 = 17.8768.

Wow, exactly. So 14.25.

Wait, 1.2544 *14=17.5616.

1.2544 *14.25=17.5616 + (0.25 *1.2544)=17.5616 +0.3136=17.8752 → which is very close to 17.8766. So approximately 14.25.

So PV of D2≈14.25.

PV of D3:20.2005 / (1.12)^3 =20.2005 /1.404928 → let's compute.

1.404928 ×14.4 = ?

14 ×1.404928=19.669.

0.4 ×1.404928=0.56197.

So 19.669 +0.56197=20.23097. Which is a bit higher than 20.2005.

So 14.4 gives 20.23097, which is 0.0305 more than 20.2005. So to adjust, maybe 14.4 - (0.0305/1.404928) → 0.0305/1.404928≈0.0217.

So 14.4 -0.0217≈14.3783.

So PV of D3≈14.378.

Wait, perhaps an approximate value is 14.38.

PV of D4:22.82656 / (1.12)^4=22.82656 /1.57322.

Let me compute 1.57322 ×14.5=?

14 ×1.57322=22.045.

0.5 ×1.57322=0.78661.

Total 22.045 +0.78661=22.83161.

Which is very close to 22.82656. So 14.5 gives 22.83161, which is a bit higher than 22.82656.

So the PV is approximately 14.5 - (22.83161-22.82656)/(1.57322).

The difference is 0.00505.

So 0.00505 /1.57322≈0.0032.

So PV is 14.5 -0.0032≈14.4968 → approximately 14.50.

Wait, but wait, 14.5 gives 22.83161, which is just a bit higher than D4 of 22.82656. So the actual PV is slightly less than 14.5. But perhaps for simplicity, I can take 14.50.

Alternatively, maybe PV of D4 ≈14.4968 → ~14.497.

PV of D5:25.794 / (1.12)^5=25.794 /1.761007.

Compute 1.761007 ×14.6 → let's see:

14 ×1.761=24.634.

0.6 ×1.761=1.0566.

Total 24.634 +1.0566=25.6906.

Which is less than 25.794 by 25.794 -25.6906=0.1034.

Now, how much more is needed beyond 14.6?

We have 0.1034 left. 0.1034 /1.761007≈0.0587.

So 14.6 +0.0587=14.6587 → approximately 14.659.

So PV of D5≈14.659.

Now, let's sum up all the present values:

PV of D1:14.125

PV of D2:14.25

PV of D3:14.378

PV of D4:14.50

PV of D5:14.659

Adding these up:

14.125 +14.25 =28.375

+14.378 → 28.375 +14.378=42.753

+14.5 → 42.753 +14.5=57.253

+14.659 →57.253 +14.659=71.912.

So the sum of the present values of the dividends is approximately 71.912.

Plus the present value of P5, which is 219.71.

So total PV=71.912 +219.71=291.622.

Looking at the options, option I is 291.45, which is close. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made some rounding errors along the way.

Wait, let me double-check some calculations because my total is around 291.62, but the option is 291.45. So perhaps my approximations are a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations for each step.

Let me try to compute each PV more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for each dividend:

The present value of each dividend Dn is D0*(1+g)^n / (1+r)^n.

So for each year n=1 to 5, Dn =14*(1.13)^n.

So PV of each Dn is 14*(1.13/1.12)^n → wait, no, that's not correct because each Dn is (14)*(1.13)^n, and then discounted at (1.12)^n.

So each term is 14*(1.13)^n / (1.12)^n =14*(1.13/1.12)^n.

But (1.13/1.12)=1.00892857.

So each term is 14*(1.00892857)^n for n=1 to 5.

But perhaps it's easier to compute each term as:

Year 1: 14*(1.13) /1.12 = (14*1.13)/1.12.

14*1.13=15.82 → 15.82/1.12=14.125.

Same as before.

Year 2:14*(
