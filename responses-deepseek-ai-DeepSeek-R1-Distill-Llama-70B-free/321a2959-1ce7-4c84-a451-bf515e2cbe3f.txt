Okay, so I've got this question about family therapy approaches, specifically focusing on Salvador Minuchin's structural approach. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to remember what the structural approach is all about. From what I recall, Minuchin's approach emphasizes the structure of the family system. He looks at the subsystems within the family, like the parental subsystem, the sibling subsystem, etc. The idea is that the way these subsystems are organized and the boundaries between them can either help or hinder the family's functioning.

So, the question is asking what a family therapist using this approach would most likely do. The options are A through I. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Use a single-therapist model to maintain consistency. I'm not sure about this. I think some approaches use multiple therapists, especially to observe or to prevent getting pulled into the family dynamics. For example, maybe the Milan Systemic approach uses a team behind a one-way mirror. But Minuchin's approach, does it prefer a single therapist? I'm not certain, but I think Minuchin's model might often involve a single therapist, but I'm not 100% sure.

Option B: Solely focus on individual therapy sessions. No, structural family therapy is all about the family as a unit, not individual sessions. They probably work with the whole family together, so this option seems incorrect.

Option C: Work initially with the most differentiated family member. Differentiation is more of a concept from Bowen's theory, I think. Bowen talks about differentiation of self, which is about how well a person can maintain their sense of self within the family. Minuchin's approach is more about the structure and boundaries, so this option might not be the right fit.

Option D: Avoid discussing family dynamics and focus on external factors. No, that doesn't make sense. Structural therapy is about looking at the internal dynamics and how the family's structure contributes to the problems. So this is probably wrong.

Option E: Encourage family members to solve issues independently without intervention. Again, I don't think so. The therapist is probably active in guiding and restructuring the family interactions, not just letting them figure it out on their own.

Option F: Avoid issuing directives and let the family find their own solutions. I'm not sure. I think Minuchin's approach is more active and directive. The therapist might give tasks or restructure interactions, so this might be the opposite of what they do. So F might not be correct.

Option G: Use a multiple-therapist team to prevent being triangulated. I think some models do this, like the MRI model or maybe others, but does Minuchin's approach? I'm not too sure. I think Minuchin's approach might more often use a single therapist, but I'm not certain. This option could be a contender, but I'm not sure yet.

Option H: Encourage groupthink to ensure harmony. That doesn't sound right. Groupthink is about everyone agreeing without critical thinking, which isn't healthy. Therapy usually aims for more authentic communication, not forced harmony. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: Clarify boundaries between family members to reduce enmeshment. Yes, this rings a bell. Structural therapy focuses on changing the structure of the family, which includes looking at the boundaries. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries where they're overly involved in each other's lives, leading to issues. The therapist would work to clarify and strengthen these boundaries to improve functioning. So I think I is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Minuchin's approach does involve restructuring the family by reorganizing the subsystems and boundaries. So, yes, option I fits because it's about clarifying boundaries to reduce enmeshment.

Looking back, option G was about multiple therapists. I'm trying to remember if Minuchin's approach uses a team. I think some approaches do, but Minuchin's might rely more on a single therapist who actively intervenes. So G might not be the best fit here.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I.
</think>

The structural approach of Salvador Minuchin focuses on the organization of the family system, emphasizing subsystems and boundaries. A therapist using this approach would aim to clarify boundaries between family members to reduce enmeshment and improve family functioning. This aligns with Option I, as it directly addresses the core principles of Minuchin's therapy. Other options, such as using a single-therapist model (A), focusing solely on individual sessions (B), or avoiding directives (F), do not align as closely with the structural approach. Therefore, the best answer is:

I

Answer: I
