Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about comparative advantage and opportunity cost. Hmm, I remember that these are concepts from economics, probably in international trade or something like that. 

Alright, let me think. Comparative advantage is when a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, right? Wait, what's opportunity cost again? Oh yeah, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative you give up when making a decision. So in production, if a country uses resources to make one product, the opportunity cost is what else they could have made with those resources.

So the question is about relating comparative advantage to opportunity cost. The options are A through D. Let me read the options again.

Option A says comparative advantage is when a country can produce a good with a lower opportunity cost than another country. That sounds right because if Country A can make Product X with less opportunity cost, they should specialize in X. 

Option B is about having more resources. I don't think that's it. Having more resources might relate to absolute advantage, not comparative. Like, absolute advantage is being more efficient overall, but comparative is about the trade-offs.

Option C says producing more goods. That also feels like absolute advantage. If a country can make more of everything, that's not necessarily about opportunity cost. It's more about total production.

Option D is producing a good faster. That might be about efficiency or absolute advantage again. Like, if you can make it in less time, that's being more efficient, but not directly about the trade-offs involved in opportunity cost.

So putting it together, comparative advantage is based on the idea that countries should specialize in producing goods where they have a lower opportunity cost. That way, trade benefits both because each country focuses on what they're best at in terms of trade-offs, not necessarily how much they can produce.

I think the correct answer is A. It directly ties comparative advantage to lower opportunity cost, which aligns with what I remember from my studies.

The principle of comparative advantage is best explained by option A. It correctly states that a country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good with a lower opportunity cost than another country. This means the country should specialize in producing that good, as it involves fewer trade-offs in terms of alternative production. The other options relate more to absolute advantage or efficiency rather than the concept of comparative advantage tied to opportunity cost.

Answer: A
