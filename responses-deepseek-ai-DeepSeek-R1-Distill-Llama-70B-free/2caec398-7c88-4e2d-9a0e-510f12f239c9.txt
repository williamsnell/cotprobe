Question:

A husband and wife divorced after 17 years of marriage. They had one son, aged 10. As part of the divorce decree, the wife was given custody of the son, while the husband was entitled to weekend visitation. Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence. As a consequence, the attorney advised the husband that he could take the son to live with him and not be in violation of the law. This was erroneous legal advice, and his new state, in fact, did honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. When his next scheduled visitation took place, the husband picked up his son at his ex-wife's home. Instead of returning his son, he took him to live with him in his new state. After refusing to return his son to his ex-wife, the husband was subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping. The applicable statute is defined as "knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location. "Should the husband be found guilty of kidnapping?

Options:

A: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.
B: Yes, because he intentionally kept his son from his ex-wife.
C: No, because as the father, he has the right to custody of his son.
D: No, because his actions were based on the legal advice he received.
E: Yes, because he did not have the legal right to take his son to another state.
F: No, because he received erroneous legal advice.
G: Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.
H: No, because the son willingly went with him.
I: Yes, because he knowingly moved his son to another location.
J: No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about whether the husband should be found guilty of kidnapping after taking his son without returning him. Let me break it down.

So, the husband and wife divorced after 17 years, and the wife got custody of their 10-year-old son. The husband has weekend visitation. Then, he gets a new job in a neighboring state. Before moving, he talks to an attorney about getting full custody. The attorney tells him that his new state doesn't give full faith and credit to the divorce proceedings from the former state. So, the attorney advises him that taking the son wouldn't be illegal. But actually, the new state does honor other states' divorce decrees, so the advice was wrong.

When the husband picks up his son for visitation, instead of returning him, he takes him to live in the new state. Then he refuses to return the son and gets charged with kidnapping. The statute defines kidnapping as "knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location."

Hmm. So, the key points here are the legal elements of kidnapping and the husband's state of mind. Let's think about the elements first. Kidnapping typically requires the unlawful taking and carrying away of a person against their will. But in this case, the son is his child. Wait, but does that matter? I think parental kidnapping is still a thing. Also, the issue is whether he had the legal right to take the child.

The husband thought he could take the son because the attorney said the new state wouldn't honor the divorce decree. But in reality, the new state does honor it, so the divorce decree (which gave custody to the wife) is still valid. Therefore, the husband didn't have legal authority to take the son. So, taking the son without the right would be abduction.

Now, the mistake of law. The husband relied on the attorney's advice. Generally, mistake of law isn't a defense. Like, "I thought it was legal" doesn't usually excuse illegal actions. Unless the mistake was due to official statements (like a court or government official), which isn't the case here. The attorney is a private individual, so his advice doesn't count as an official statement that would make a mistake of law a valid defense.

So, even though the husband believed he was acting legally based on the attorney's advice, that's a mistake of law, which isn't a defense. Therefore, he could still be guilty.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense. That seems correct based on what I just thought.

B: Yes, because he intentionally kept his son. Well, intent is part of it, but the main issue is the legality of his action. So B is true but not the best reason.

C: No, because he's the father. No, parental rights don't override a valid custody order.

D: No, because he followed legal advice. No, mistake of law isn't a defense.

E: Yes, because he didn't have the legal right. This is also correct, as he violated the custody order.

F: No, because of erroneous advice. Same as D, which is incorrect.

G: Yes, because he transported the son against the divorce decree. That's accurate.

H: No, because the son went willingly. But kidnapping doesn't require the victim's resistance; it's about the unlawful taking.

I: Yes, because he knowingly moved the son. But wait, did he know it was illegal? He thought it was legal because of the attorney. So his knowledge might be an issue. If he didn't know it was illegal, but the mistake is based on wrong legal advice, does that negate the "knowingly" part? Hmm, the statute requires "knowingly abducting." So, if he didn't know his action was illegal, maybe he lacked the mens rea.

Wait, but the mistake of law doesn't negate the knowledge. Because he knew he was taking the son, even if he thought it was legal. So, the "knowingly" refers to the act, not the legality. So, he knowingly took the son, regardless of his belief about the legality. So, I think the mistake wouldn't affect the "knowingly" element.

So, going back, the elements are met: he knowingly took the son and moved him, which was against the law because the custody order was still valid. Therefore, he should be guilty.

So, among the options, A, E, G, and I are possible. Let me read them again.

A: Yes, mistake of law is no defense. Correct, because even if he relied on wrong advice, that's not a defense.

E: Yes, because he didn't have the legal right. Also correct, because he violated the custody order.

G: Yes, because he transported unlawfully. Also correct.

I: Yes, because he knowingly moved. Correct, but focuses on intent.

The question is which option is the best answer. The primary issue is whether he had the legal right. Since the new state honored the decree, his action was unlawful, making it kidnapping. So, the correct answer should be A, because the reasoning is about mistake of law not being a defense, which is a key legal principle here.

Wait, but in E, it's about not having the legal right, which is a more direct reason. So, perhaps E is the better answer. Let me check the options again.

The question is whether he should be guilty. So, the elements are: (1) knowingly abducting, (2) moving to another location.

He did both. His mistake about the law doesn't excuse him. So, the main reason is that mistake of law isn't a defense, making A correct. But another angle is that he didn't have the legal right, making E correct.

I think both A and E are correct reasons, but the question is about applying the law. The key here is that he didn't have the legal right because the state honored the decree, which makes his action illegal. So, E says "Yes, because he did not have the legal right to take his son to another state." That seems directly on point.

But wait, option G says "Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree." That's also correct.

So, which is the better answer? The question is about whether the elements are met, considering his belief. So, the fact that he didn't have the legal right is crucial. Therefore, E or G.

Alternatively, the answer might be A, because the main issue is the mistake of law defense. But in criminal law, the mistake must be about the law as given by an official source to be a defense. Since the attorney isn't an official, the husband's mistake doesn't excuse him. So A is correct.

Wait, but the elements: the statute requires "knowingly abducting." If he didn't know he was violating the law because of the attorney's advice, does that negate the "knowingly" part? No, because "knowingly" refers to the act, not the legality. So, he knew he was taking the child, which is the actus reus. The mens rea is the intent to commit that act, not the knowledge of its legality. So, he still acted knowingly as to his actions, regardless of his mistaken belief about the law.

So, the answer should be A, because mistake of law is no defense. Even if he thought it was legal, that's not a valid excuse. So, he is guilty.

The question revolves around whether the husband should be found guilty of kidnapping after taking his son without returning him, based on the legal elements of kidnapping and the husband's state of mind. The statute defines kidnapping as "knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location." The key points are:

1. **Elements of Kidnapping**: The husband took his son and moved him to another state. This satisfies the actus reus (the physical act of abduction and movement). The mens rea (mental state) requires that the act was done "knowingly," meaning the husband was aware of his actions.

2. **Legal Right and Custody Order**: The divorce decree granted custody to the wife, and the new state honored the decree. Therefore, the husband did not have the legal right to take his son, making his actions unlawful.

3. **Mistake of Law**: The husband relied on erroneous legal advice from his attorney, who incorrectly told him that the new state did not honor the divorce decree. However, mistake of law is generally not a defense unless the mistake is based on an official statement (e.g., from a government or court official). Since the attorney is a private individual, the husband's reliance on the advice does not excuse his actions.

4. **"Knowingly" Requirement**: The statute requires that the abduction be "knowingly" performed. The husband's mistaken belief about the legality of his actions does not negate the fact that he knowingly took and moved his son. The "knowingly" element refers to the act itself, not the legality of the act.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Correct. Mistake of law is no defense, as the husband's reliance on the attorney's advice does not excuse his unlawful actions.
- **B**: Partially correct but not the best answer. While the husband intentionally kept his son, the focus is on the legality of his actions, not just his intent.
- **C**: Incorrect. Parental rights do not override a valid custody order.
- **D**: Incorrect. Mistake of law is not a valid defense in this context.
- **E**: Correct. The husband did not have the legal right to take his son, as the new state honored the divorce decree.
- **F**: Incorrect. Erroneous legal advice does not excuse unlawful actions.
- **G**: Correct. The husband unlawfully transported his son in violation of the divorce decree.
- **H**: Incorrect. Kidnapping does not require the victim's resistance; it focuses on the unlawful nature of the act.
- **I**: Correct. The husband knowingly moved his son, satisfying the mens rea requirement.
- **J**: Incorrect. The husband had the requisite state of mind, as he knowingly performed the act.

### Conclusion:
The best answer is **A**, as it directly addresses the key legal principle that mistake of law is no defense. While options **E**, **G**, and **I** are also correct, **A** provides the most comprehensive reasoning for why the husband should be found guilty.
