Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a brine solution in a cuvette being analyzed with an interferometer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the cuvette has an inside width of 4 mm. They left the solution to settle, which probably means there's some kind of density gradient now. When they examined it with light of 500 nm wavelength, they saw a fringe shift of 16 fringes at the bottom compared to the top. The average refractive index is 1.462, and the distribution is linear. They want the two refractive indices and the ratio of densities at top and bottom.

Wait, so I remember that in interferometry, the fringe shift is related to the change in optical path length. The formula I think is something like delta = (n-1) * t, but wait, maybe more accurately, the optical path difference (OPD) is given by (n * d) compared to vacuum, where d is the physical thickness. But since the cuvette's width is fixed, the variation in n causes the OPD.

The problem mentions a shift of 16 fringes. Each fringe corresponds to a half-wavelength change in OPD, right? Because for constructive interference, each fringe is λ/2 difference. Wait, no—wait, the formula is OPD = mλ/2 for m fringes shifted. Or is it mλ? I think I might be mixing things up.

Wait, in interferometry, the number of fringes shifted is equal to the OPD divided by half the wavelength. So OPD = (number of fringes) * (λ/2). So in this case, 16 fringes would mean OPD is 16*(500 nm / 2). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 500 nm is 500e-9 meters. So 16 * (500e-9 / 2) = 16 * 250e-9 = 4e-6 meters, which is 4 micrometers. So the optical path difference is 4 micrometers between the top and bottom.

But wait, the cuvette's width is 4 mm, which is 4e-3 meters. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the cuvette is placed in the interferometer such that the light passes through it. The width is the length of the path the light goes through the solution, which is 4 mm. So the optical path length (OPL) is n * d, where d is 4 mm.

But since the solution's refractive index varies linearly, the OPL varies across the cuvette. The bottom part has a higher refractive index than the top, or vice versa? Wait, the solution was left to settle, so denser parts would be at the bottom. Since refractive index increases with density, the bottom has higher n.

So the average refractive index is 1.462. Since the distribution is linear, the average would be the mean of the top and bottom indices. So if n_top is n1 and n_bottom is n2, then (n1 + n2)/2 = 1.462. So n1 + n2 = 2.924.

The OPD is the difference in OPL between the bottom and top. The OPL is n*d for each. But wait, the light passes through the entire 4 mm, so for each point in the cuvette, the OPL is n(x) * 4 mm. But since the index varies linearly, the OPL varies from n1 *4mm at the top to n2 *4mm at the bottom.

Wait, but the fringe shift is due to the change in OPL across the cuvette. So the OPD is (n2 - n1)*d. Because the bottom has n2, top has n1, and the light goes through the same physical thickness d, so the difference is (n2 -n1)*d.

Wait, but earlier I thought the OPD was 4 micrometers due to the 16 fringes. Let's confirm:

OPD = (number of fringes) * (lambda/2)
So 16 fringes * (500e-9 m / 2) = 16 * 250e-9 = 4e-6 m = 4 micrometers. So OPD is 4e-6 m.

So (n2 - n1) * d = 4e-6 m.

We know d is 4 mm, which is 4e-3 m.

So:

(n2 - n1) * 4e-3 = 4e-6

Divide both sides by 4e-3:

n2 - n1 = (4e-6) / (4e-3) )= 1e-3.

So n2 = n1 + 0.001.

But since (n1 +n2)/2 = 1.462, substituting n2 = n1 +0.001:

n1 + (n1 +0.001) = 2 *1.462 → 2n1 +0.001 = 2.924 → 2n1 = 2.923 → n1= 1.4615.

So n2 = 1.4615 + 0.001 = 1.4625.

So the two refractive indices are n1=1.4615 and n2=1.4625.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Looking at the options, option E is n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625. But wait, what about part (b), the ratio of densities d1/d2?

Wait, the density ratio. I remember that refractive index is related to density. For most solutions, especially like brine, the refractive index increases with density. So if n2 > n1, then density at bottom (d2) is higher than at top (d1). So the ratio d1/d2 would be less than 1.

But how to find that ratio? I think we can use the concept of the relationship between refractive index and density. One such relation is the Gladstone-Dale formula, which says that (n -1) is proportional to the density (d). So (n1 -1)/d1 = (n2 -1)/d2 = constant.

So (n1-1)/d1 = (n2-1)/d2 → d1/d2 = (n1-1)/(n2-1).

So plug in n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625.

n1 -1 = 0.4615; n2-1=0.4625.

So d1/d2 = 0.4615 /0.4625 ≈ 0.997.

Looking at the options, option E is (n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625, d1/d2=0.996). Hmm, wait, my calculation gave 0.4615/0.4625 ≈ 0.997, but option E says 0.996. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.4615 / 0.4625 = ?

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

0.4615 = 4615e-4.

0.4625 = 4625e-4.

So 4615 / 4625 = (4625-10)/4625 = 1 - 10/4625 ≈ 1 - 0.00216 → 0.99784, so approximately 0.9978.

So the ratio is about 0.9978, so 0.998 when rounded. But option E has d1/d2=0.996, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the approach. Maybe the formula I used isn't exact, or perhaps it's the inverse.

Wait, no, because if n increases with density, then a higher n implies higher density. So d2 > d1, so d1/d2 is less than 1. Which fits with our result.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E says d1/d2=0.996, but our calculation is 0.9978. That's about 0.998, but none of the options have 0.998. Let me check the other options.

Option I: n1=1.4625, n2=1.4635, d1/d2=0.998. Oh wait, that's n1=1.4625, n2=1.4635. So (n1-1)=0.4625, (n2-1)=0.4635. So d1/d2=0.4625/0.4635 = approx 0.9978 again, 0.998. So option I's d1/d2 is 0.998, which matches our calculation, but the n's are 1.4625 and 1.4635. But wait, earlier we found n1=1.4615 and n2=1.4625. So that doesn't match option I.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the OPD calculation. Let me go back.

The OPD is 4 micrometers, which is 4e-6 m.

OPD = (n2 -n1) * d

d is 4e-3 m.

So (n2-n1) = OPD/d = 4e-6 /4e-3 = 1e-3. So n2 = n1 + 0.001.

Average n is (n1 +n2)/2 = 1.462 → n1 +n2=2.924.

Substituting n2 =n1 +0.001: n1 + (n1 +0.001) = 2.924 → 2n1 =2.923 → n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625.

Yes, that's correct.

Now for density ratio d1/d2: using Gladstone-Dale, (n1-1)/d1 = (n2-1)/d2 → d1/d2 = (n1-1)/(n2-1).

n1-1=0.4615, n2-1=0.4625.

0.4615 / 0.4625 = (4615/4625) = (approx 0.9978).

Looking at the options, option E has d1/d2=0.996, which is a bit lower. Option I gives 0.998, but n's don't match.

Wait, let me check option E. Option E says n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625, d1/d2=0.996. But according to our calculation, d1/d2 is 0.9978, which is close to 0.998, not 0.996. So perhaps option E isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is inverted. Maybe it's d2/d1, but that wouldn't make sense because if d2 >d1, then d1/d2 <1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The Gladstone-Dale formula says that (n - 1) is proportional to density. So n = 1 + k*d, where k is a constant. So (n1-1)/d1 = (n2-1)/d2 → d1/d2 = (n1-1)/(n2-1).

Yes, that's correct.

So if n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625,

d1/d2 = 0.4615 / 0.4625 ≈ 0.99783.

So approximately 0.9978, which would round to 0.998.

Looking at the options, none have exactly 0.998 except option I, but in option I, n1 and n2 are higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the fringe shift is due to the difference in optical path, which could include the geometric path as well. Wait, no, the cuvette's physical thickness is the same for all, so it's the variation in n that causes the OPL difference.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the OPD is the difference in OPL across the cuvette. So the OPL for the top is n1 * d, and for the bottom, it's n2 *d. So the OPD is (n2 -n1)*d.

Which is what I did before. So that gives (n2-n1) = 0.001.

So the n's are correct as 1.4615 and 1.4625.

Now, looking at the options, option E is:

E: n_1=1.4615, n_2=1.4625, d_1/d_2=0.996.

Wait, but according to our calculation, d1/d2 is ~0.9978. So none of the options exactly match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the OPD. Let me recheck the fringe shift calculation.

The wavelength is 500 nm. The number of fringes shifted is 16. Each fringe represents a change in OPD of half a wavelength. So OPD = 16 * (lambda/2) = 8 lambda.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of fringes is the number of times lambda/2 has changed. So OPD = m*(lambda/2), where m is the number of fringes. So 16 fringes correspond to 16*(500e-9 m / 2) = 16 * 250e-9 m = 4e-6 m, which is 4 micrometers. That's correct.

So that part seems right.

Hmm. So according to this, the correct n's are 1.4615 and 1.4625, and the density ratio is approximately 0.9978.

Looking at the options again, none of them exactly match both. Wait, option E has the correct n's but a lower density ratio, 0.996. Option I has higher n's but the correct density ratio.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up n1 and n2. Wait, perhaps n1 is higher than n2? But that can't be because the solution is denser at the bottom, so n2 should be higher.

Wait, the fringe shift is 16 fringes for the bottom compared to the top. So the bottom has higher OPL, meaning higher n. So n2 >n1.

So our initial assignment is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the density ratio. Maybe the formula is (d1 - d2)/(d2) or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the relation (n2 -n1) proportional to (d2 -d1). But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the relationship between density and refractive index. For a dilute solution, the refractive index can be approximated as n = n0 + k*d, where n0 is the refractive index of water (around 1.333), but in our case, the solution's average n is 1.462, which is higher. But perhaps for a linear relation, the change in n is proportional to the change in density.

So, if (n2 -n1) = 0.001, and (d2 -d1) is proportional to that, then d2 = d1 + (something). But without knowing the proportionality constant, I can't proceed. Hence, the Gladstone-Dale approach is better.

Wait, but the Gladstone-Dale formula is (n-1) = k*d, so (n1-1)/d1 = (n2-1)/d2.

So, (n1-1)/(n2-1) = d1/d2 → d1/d2 = (n1-1)/(n2-1).

Yes, that's what I did before. So with n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625,

(n1-1)=0.4615, (n2-1)=0.4625,

so d1/d2= 0.4615/0.4625 = 0.99783.

Looking at the options, none of the options have 0.9978, but option I has 0.998. However, option I's n's are 1.4625 and 1.4635, which doesn't match our n's. So perhaps the correct option isn't present? That can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of OPD, I considered it as (n2 -n1)*d, but perhaps it's (n_avg * d) + some term.

Wait, wait. Another approach: The total OPL for the cuvette is integral of n(y) dy from 0 to d, where y is the height. But since it's a linear distribution, the average n is (n1 +n2)/2. So the OPL is average_n * d.

But the fringe shift comes from the variation in n across the cuvette. Wait, no, the fringe shift is the difference in OPL between two points. Wait, the interferometer compares the OPL through the cuvette with a reference path.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The problem states that the fringe shift is 16 fringes for the bottom part compared to the top. So the OPD between top and bottom is 16*(lambda/2).

Which is 16*(500e-9/2) = 4e-6 m.

So OPD = (n2 * d) - (n1 *d) )= (n2 -n1)*d.

Which gives (n2 -n1) = 4e-6 /4e-3 = 1e-3.

So n2 =n1 +0.001.

And average n is (n1 +n2)/2 =1.462 → n1 +n2 =2.924 → substituting n2= n1 +0.001 → 2n1 +0.001 =2.924 → 2n1=2.923 → n1=1.4615, n2=1.4625.

So that's correct.

Now, the density ratio. Using Gladstone-Dale:

(n1-1)/d1 = (n2-1)/d2 → d1/d2 = (n1-1)/(n2-1) = 0.4615 / 0.4625 ≈ 0.99783.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I, which has d1/d2=0.998. But option I has n1=1.4625 and n2=1.4635, which doesn't fit our n1 and n
