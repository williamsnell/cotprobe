Question:

A debtor owed a creditor $750 on an old debt. On July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor "is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. " Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?

Options:

A: There was no mutuality of obligation.
B: The creditor's claim was based on hearsay.
C: The promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation.
D: It was violative of the statute of frauds.
E: The debtor was under duress when he made the promise.
F: The debtor had no legal capacity to enter into the agreement.
G: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.
H: The promise was not made in a formal legal setting.
I: It was not supported by new consideration.
J: The debtor did not provide a written agreement for the promise.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically dealing with the statute of limitations and the enforceability of an oral promise. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a debtor owed a creditor $750, but on July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. Then, on August 1, the debtor overheard the creditor talking badly about him to mutual friends, calling him a deadbeat. Feeling guilty, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay the $750 by September 1. But when the time came, the debtor refused to pay. Now, the creditor is suing, and we need to find the strongest ground for why the oral promise isn't enforceable.

First, I remember that when a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, the creditor can't sue to enforce it. But here, the debtor made a new promise to pay. Normally, this might restart the statute of limitations, but there's a catch.

I think about the concept of consideration in contracts. For a promise to be enforceable, there needs to be considerationâ€”something of value exchanged. In this case, the original debt was already time-barred, so the creditor isn't giving up anything new in exchange for the promise. The debtor's promise to pay might not be supported by new consideration, making it unenforceable.

Wait, but isn't there an exception? I recall something about a "moral obligation" not being sufficient consideration. So even if the debtor felt guilty, that's not enough. But maybe that's more about when the original debt was validly discharged, not just barred by the statute.

Also, the statute of frauds requires certain agreements to be in writing. But I think the statute of frauds applies to debts in some cases, like when the debt is over a certain amount, but since it's $750, I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Looking at the options, option I says "It was not supported by new consideration." That seems to fit because the original debt was already barred. The creditor isn't providing anything new, so the promise lacks consideration.

Other options: option G says the debt was already barred, but the new promise might have revived it. Option A is about mutuality of obligation, but that's more about both parties being bound. Option C says it was out of guilt, which relates to consideration but perhaps not as directly as option I. Option D is about the statute of frauds, but I don't think it applies here because the agreement isn't one of the types that must be written, like a debt over a certain period. Option J is about written agreements, which again, I don't think applies here.

So the strongest ground is that there was no new consideration, making the promise unenforceable under contract law.

The question revolves around the enforceability of an oral promise to pay a debt that was previously barred by the statute of limitations. The key issue is whether the debtor's oral promise to pay the creditor $750 is enforceable. Under contract law, a promise must be supported by consideration to be enforceable. Consideration requires that both parties exchange something of legal value. In this case, the original debt was already barred by the statute of limitations, meaning the creditor had no legal right to demand payment. The debtor's oral promise to pay, motivated by guilt, does not constitute new consideration because the creditor is not providing anything new in exchange for the promise. Therefore, the promise lacks the necessary consideration to be enforceable.

Option I correctly identifies that the promise was not supported by new consideration, making it the strongest ground for unenforceability. Other options, such as the statute of frauds (D) or the debt being barred by the statute of limitations (G), are less relevant because the promise itself could theoretically revive the debt, but it still fails due to the lack of consideration.
