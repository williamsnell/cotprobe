Okay, so I've got this physics problem about rolling friction and bicycle tires. Hmm, I need to find the coefficient of rolling friction for each tire. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says both tires are set rolling with the same initial speed of 3.5 m/s. They measure how far each travels before their speed drops by half, so to 1.75 m/s. The distances are different—18.1 meters for the 40 psi tire and 92.9 meters for the 105 psi one. I guess the higher pressure tire goes further because it has less rolling friction. But I'm not here to guess; I need to calculate the coefficients.

Wait, rolling friction... Oh right, the formula for the coefficient of rolling friction (let's call it Cr) is related to the work done against friction. I remember that the work done by friction is the frictional force times the distance, and that should equal the change in kinetic energy.

So the kinetic energy change is the initial KE minus the final KE. Since the speed is halved, the KE goes down by a factor of (1/2)^2 because KE is (1/2)mv². So the change in KE is (1/2)mv_initial² - (1/2)mv_final². But since v_final is v_initial/2, that's (1/2)mv_i² - (1/2)m(v_i/2)^2. Let me compute that.

Wait, v_final = v_initial / 2, so (v_final)^2 = v_i² /4. So the KE change is (1/2 m v_i²) - (1/2 m (v_i²/4)) ) = (1/2 m v_i²) (1 - 1/4) ) = (3/8) m v_i². But wait, no—wait, the work done by friction is the force of friction (which is Cr * m * g) multiplied by the distance d. So Fr = Cr * m * g, and Work = Fr * d = Cr * m * g * d. But work done is also the change in kinetic energy, which is (KE_initial - KE_final) = (1/2 m v_i²) - (1/2 m (v_i/2)^2 ) = (1/2 m v_i²) (1 - 1/4) ) = (3/8) m v_i².

Wait, no: initial speed is v_i, final speed is v_i/2, so the change in KE is (1/2 m v_i²) - (1/2 m (v_i²/4)) ) = ( (1/2 m v_i²) )*(1 - 1/4) ) = (3/8) m v_i². So the work done by friction is equal to that. So:

Cr * m * g * d = (3/8) m v_i².

Oh wait, but wait a second—work done by friction is actually negative, because friction opposes motion. But since the KE is decreasing, I think the formula holds as the work done against friction equals the loss in KE. So we can set Cr * m * g * d = (1/2 m v_i^2) - (1/2 m v_f^2). Since v_f is v_i/2, that's (1/2 m v_i²) - (1/2 m (v_i/2)^2 ) = (3/8 m v_i^2 ), as I had before.

So then, solving for Cr:

Cr = ( (3/8) m v_i² ) / ( m g d )

The mass m cancels out, so:

Cr = (3 v_i²) / (8 g d )

But wait, let me double-check the formula. Another approach: the deceleration a is caused by friction. The frictional force is Fr = Cr * m g = m a. So a = Cr g.

Then, using kinematics, the final velocity v_f = v_i + a t. But wait, since the speed is decreasing, a is negative. So v_f = v_i - a t. But wait, perhaps it's easier to use the equation:

v_f² = v_i² + 2 a d.

But a is negative, since it's deceleration. So:

(v_i/2)^2 = v_i² + 2 (-a) d.

Wait, let me compute that:

(v_i/2)^2 = v_i² - 2 a d.

Multiply through:

v_i²/4 = v_i² - 2 a d.

Rearranging:

2 a d = v_i² - v_i²/4 = (3/4) v_i².

So a = (3 v_i²) / (8 d).

But a is also equal to Cr g. So:

Cr g = (3 v_i²) / (8 d )

=> Cr = (3 v_i²) / (8 g d )

Yes, same as before. So that's the formula I need to use.

So for each tire, I'll plug in their respective d, and compute Cr.

Given:

For the first tire (40 psi): d = 18.1 m.

Second tire (105 psi): d = 92.9 m.

v_i = 3.5 m/s.

g is 9.8 m/s².

So let's compute Cr for each.

First tire:

Cr1 = (3 * (3.5)^2 ) / (8 * 9.8 * 18.1 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

3*(3.5)^2 = 3*(12.25) = 36.75.

Denominator: 8 *9.8 = 78.4; 78.4 *18.1 = let's compute that.

18.1 * 78.4:

Hmm, 18 *78.4 = 1411.2, and 0.1 *78.4 =7.84; total is 1411.2 +7.84=1419.04.

So denominator is 1419.04.

So Cr1 = 36.75 / 1419.04.

Let me calculate that. 36.75 / 1419.04 ≈ ?

Well, 36.75 / 1419 is roughly 0.0259. Let me do it more accurately.

1419.04 * 0.0259 = let's see, 0.02 is 28.38, 0.0059 is approx 8.34, so 0.0259 would be around 28.38+8.34=36.72. Oh, wait! So 0.0259 gives 36.72, which is almost exactly 36.75. So Cr1 ≈ 0.0259.

Wait, but let me compute it precisely.

36.75 / 1419.04 = ?

Dividing 36.75 by 1419.04.

Let me write 36.75 ÷ 1419.04:

≈ 0.0259.

So Cr1 ≈ 0.0259.

Now the second tire: d = 92.9 m.

Cr2 = (3*(3.5)^2 ) / (8 *9.8 *92.9 )

Compute numerator again 3*(3.5)^2=36.75.

Denominator: 8*9.8=78.4; 78.4 *92.9 = let's compute.

Hmm, 78.4 *90=7056, 78.4 *2.9= approx 227.36. So total is 7056 + 227.36=7283.36.

So denominator is 7283.36.

Cr2=36.75 / 7283.36.

Let me compute that.

36.75 /7283.36 ≈

Well, 7283.36 is about 7.283e3.

36.75 ÷7.283e3 = approximately 0.005. Let me compute it accurately.

36.75 ÷7283.36:

Hmm, 7283.36 * 0.005 = 36.4168.

But 36.75 is a little higher than 36.4168, so 0.005 is 36.4168; 36.75-36.4168=0.3332.

So 0.3332/7283.36 ≈ 0.0000458.

So total is 0.005 + 0.0000458 ≈ 0.0050458.

So Cr2 ≈ 0.005045, which I can round to 0.00505.

So the coefficients are approximately 0.0259 and 0.00505.

Looking at the options, option D is [0.0259, 0.00505], which matches what I calculated.

Wait, let me double-check the options. Option D says [0.0259, 0.00505], which matches our first and second tire's Cr.

So the answer should be option D.
</think>

To determine the coefficient of rolling friction (Cr) for each tire, we use the relationship between the work done by rolling friction and the change in kinetic energy. The work done by friction is given by:

\[
W = F_r \cdot d = C_r \cdot m \cdot g \cdot d
\]

where \( F_r \) is the frictional force, \( d \) is the distance traveled, \( m \) is the mass, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. The change in kinetic energy is:

\[
\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 - \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2
\]

Since the final velocity \( v_f \) is half the initial velocity \( v_i \), we have:

\[
\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 - \frac{1}{2} m \left(\frac{v_i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{8} m v_i^2
\]

Equating the work done by friction to the change in kinetic energy:

\[
C_r \cdot m \cdot g \cdot d = \frac{3}{8} m v_i^2
\]

The mass \( m \) cancels out, leaving:

\[
C_r = \frac{3 v_i^2}{8 g d}
\]

### Calculations for Each Tire

#### Tire 1 (40 psi, \( d = 18.1 \, \text{m} \)):
\[
C_r = \frac{3 (3.5)^2}{8 (9.8) (18.1)} = \frac{3 (12.25)}{8 (9.8) (18.1)} = \frac{36.75}{1419.04} \approx 0.0259
\]

#### Tire 2 (105 psi, \( d = 92.9 \, \text{m} \)):
\[
C_r = \frac{3 (3.5)^2}{8 (9.8) (92.9)} = \frac{3 (12.25)}{8 (9.8) (92.9)} = \frac{36.75}{7283.36} \approx 0.00505
\]

### Final Answer
The coefficients of rolling friction for the two tires are approximately \( [0.0259, 0.00505] \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
