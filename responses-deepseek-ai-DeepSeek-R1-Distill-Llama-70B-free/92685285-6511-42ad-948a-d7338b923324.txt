Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the electrical analogous quantity for a spring element (K) in the force-voltage analogy. Hmm, I remember that in analogies between mechanical and electrical systems, there are two main approaches: the force-voltage analogy and the force-current analogy. Right, because different analogies pair up different variables.

So the question is about the force-voltage analogy. Let me think about the mechanical components and their electrical counterparts. In mechanical systems, the spring is represented by a spring constant K. I think in electrical terms, the analogous component would be something that stores energy in a similar way.

Wait, in the force-voltage analogy, force is like voltage. So mechanical displacement would be analogous to electrical charge. Because voltage is the force that drives current, and force drives the displacement in mechanics.

So if I consider the spring in mechanics, Hooke's Law is F = -Kx, where x is displacement. The energy stored in the spring is (1/2)Kx². In the electrical analogy, the capacitor stores energy as (1/2)CV², where C is capacitance. So if I match these, K in mechanics should correspond to 1/C in electrical terms because Kx² would match (1/C)V². Wait, because if K is analogous to 1/C, then (1/C)V² would be like Kx². So yes, K in mechanics is analogous to 1/C in electricity.

Alternatively, looking at the equations, in the force-voltage analogy, the mechanical spring (K) would correspond to the inverse of capacitance. So the correct answer should be 1/C.

Wait, the options are A: V, B: 1/C, C: C, D: L, etc. So the correct choice is B.

In the force-voltage analogy, mechanical and electrical systems are compared based on their energy storage elements. For a spring in a mechanical system, Hooke's Law is given by \( F = -Kx \), where \( K \) is the spring constant and \( x \) is displacement. The energy stored in the spring is \( \frac{1}{2}Kx^2 \). 

In the electrical system, the analogous energy storage element is a capacitor, which stores energy as \( \frac{1}{2}CV^2 \), where \( C \) is capacitance and \( V \) is voltage. By comparing the two energy expressions, \( Kx^2 \) in mechanics corresponds to \( \frac{1}{C}V^2 \) in electricity. This implies that the spring constant \( K \) in mechanics is analogous to \( \frac{1}{C} \) in electricity.

Thus, the electrical analogous quantity for the spring element \( K \) in the force-voltage analogy is \( \frac{1}{C} \).
