Question:

Find 4 over 7 + 2 over 7.

Options:

A: 2 over 7
B: 6 over 7
C: 14 over 28
D: 6 over 14
E: 1 over 2
F: 8 over 14
G: 7 over 14
H: 10 over 7
I: 8 over 49
J: 4 over 14

Answer:
    <think>


To solve the problem \( \frac{4}{7} + \frac{2}{7} \), I start by noting that both fractions have the same denominator, which is 7. This makes the addition straightforward because I can simply add the numerators while keeping the denominator the same.

Adding the numerators:  
\( 4 + 2 = 6 \)

So, the sum of the fractions is:  
\( \frac{6}{7} \)

Next, I compare this result to the provided options:  
- **Option B** is \( \frac{6}{7} \), which matches my calculation.

I double-check to ensure there are no other options that could simplify or represent the same value differently, but none of the other options match \( \frac{6}{7} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: 6 over 7**
