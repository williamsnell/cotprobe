Okay, so I've got this problem about a liquid that follows Trouton's rule. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, the question says that the vapor pressure increases by 15 mm Hg per degree around its normal boiling point. I need to find the heat of vaporization and the normal boiling point.

Wait, what's Trouton's rule again? I remember it has something to do with the entropy of vaporization being constant. Oh right, Trouton's rule states that the entropy change (ΔS) during vaporization is approximately 21.7 cal/(mol·K) for many liquids at their normal boiling points. Or wait, maybe it's 22? I think I've seen both numbers. Oh well, I'll go with 21.7 for now.

So, the formula related to this is ΔS = ΔH_vap / T_boil, where ΔH_vap is the heat of vaporization and T_boil is the boiling point in Kelvin. Rearranging that, ΔH_vap = ΔS * T_boil.

But wait, I also have the vapor pressure information. I remember that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the change in vapor pressure to temperature and the heat of vaporization. The equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (TΔV), but ΔV is the change in volume upon vaporization. For a liquid, the volume change is approximately the volume of the vapor, which can be treated as an ideal gas. So, ΔV ≈ V_vapor - V_liquid ≈ V_vapor since V_liquid is negligible.

The ideal gas law says V = nRT/P. But since we're dealing with molar quantities, V_molar = RT/P. At the boiling point, the vapor pressure P is 1 atm, right? Because the normal boiling point is where the vapor pressure equals 1 atm. Oh wait, but the units here are mm Hg. So, 1 atm is 760 mm Hg.

Wait, the problem says the vapor pressure increases by 15 mm Hg per degree. So dP/dT is 15 mm Hg/K. Hmm. I need to convert that into the same units as the other terms. Since 1 atm is 760 mm Hg, 15 mm Hg is 15/760 atm per K. So dP/dT = 15/760 atm/K ≈ 0.01974 atm/K.

Now, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation: dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T (V_vapor)).

But V_vapor is V at the boiling point. Since V = nRT/P, per mole it's V = RT/P. So V_vapor = (RT) / P. Wait, but at the boiling point, P is 1 atm, so V_vapor = RT/(1 atm) = RT in units where pressure is in atm.

Wait, let's get the units right. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So V_vapor at T_boil (in K) would be (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * T_boil (K) ) / 1 atm = 0.0821 T_boil liters per mole. So that's 82.1 T_boil mL per mole? Wait, 0.0821 * T in liters. Oh yeah, for T in Kelvin.

So putting that into the equation: dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T * V_vapor) = (ΔH_vap) / (T * (0.0821 * T)) ) = ΔH_vap / (0.0821 * T^2).

Wait, but I can rearrange that to solve for ΔH_vap:

ΔH_vap = dP/dT * 0.0821 * T².

Wait, but wait, because dP/dT is in atm/K, and 0.0821 is in L·atm/(mol·K), so the units should work out. Let me see: (atm/K) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) * (K^2) ) → (L·atm^2·K)/(mol·K) ) → L·atm·mol^{-1} something. Hmm, not sure, but let's proceed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe there's another approach. Since we know that ΔH_vap can be calculated using Trouton's rule, which gives the entropy, and then from the Clausius equation we can relate dP/dT to ΔH_vap and T.

Wait, maybe I should express ΔH_vap using both equations and set them equal. From Trouton's rule, ΔH_vap = T_boil * ΔS. And from the Clausius equation, ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * (T^2 * V_vapor) / 1. Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T * ΔV). But ΔV is V_vapor for molar basis, which is RT/P. So, ΔV = RT/P.

Putting that in: dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T * (RT/P)) ) = (ΔH_vap * P) / (R T^2).

So rearranging, ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * R T^2 / P.

But P at the boiling point is 1 atm. So yes, ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * R T^2.

Wait, because P is 1 atm, so dividing by 1 just gives (dP/dT) * R T².

Wait, but wait: Let me recheck the math. So,

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T * (RT/P)) )

Simplify denominator: T*(RT/P) )= RT²/(P).

So dP/dT = (ΔH_vap * P) / (R T² )

Then, solving for ΔH_vap:

ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * (R T²) / P

At the normal boiling point, P is 1 atm, so:

ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * R T².

Wait, that makes sense. So because dP/dT is given as 15 mm Hg per degree, which is 15/760 atm per K ≈ 0.01974 atm/K.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So, putting it together:

ΔH_vap = (0.01974 atm/K) * (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) ) * T².

Wait, wait, no. R is 0.0821, yes. So,

ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * R * T².

But wait, that would be (0.01974 atm/K) * (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) ) * T² (in K²).

The units here: atm/K * L·atm/(mol·K) * K² = (L·atm²)/(mol·K^2) * K² → L·atm²/mol. Hmm, and since 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J, so 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 J/mol. But wait, let me compute the numbers.

Let me compute the numerical factor first. (0.01974) * (0.0821) = ?

0.01974 * 0.08 is approx 0.001579, and 0.01974 * 0.0021 is about 0.0000415. So together roughly 0.00162.

So, 0.01974 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.00162 L·atm/(mol·K²) ?

Wait, perhaps more accurately: 0.01974 * 0.0821.

Let me compute 0.01974 * 0.0821:

0.01 * 0.0821 = 0.000821
0.00974 * 0.0821 ≈ let's compute 0.009 * 0.0821 = 0.0007389, then 0.00074 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.0000607. So adding 0.000821 + 0.0007389 + 0.0000607 = about 0.0016205.

So about 0.0016205 L·atm/(mol·K²) )

Then, ΔH_vap = 0.0016205 * T².

But wait, T is in Kelvin. So, whatever T is, in Kelvin, squared. So, for example, if T is 300 K, then T² is 90,000, so 0.00162 * 90,000 = 145.8 L·atm/mol.

Wait, but I need to convert L·atm to cal or kcal. Because the options are in kcal.

I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J. So, to convert to calories, since 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 / 4.184 ≈ 24.28 cal. Alternatively, I've heard that 1 L·atm ≈ 24.217 cal, which is about 24.22 cal/mol.

So, 1 L·atm ≈ 24.22 cal/mol.

So, ΔH_vap is in L·atm per mole:

ΔH_vap (L·atm/mol) = 0.0016205 * T².

Then, ΔH_vap (cal/mol) = 0.0016205 * T² * 24.22.

Now, 0.0016205 * 24.22 = approx 0.03925 cal/mol.

Wait, 0.00162 * 24.22 ≈ 0.0392.

So, ΔH_vap (cal/mol) ≈ 0.0392 * T².

But wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately:

0.0016205 * 24.22 = ?

Compute 0.001 * 24.22 = 0.02422.

0.0006205 *24.22 ≈ 0.0006205 *24 = 0.014892, and 0.0006205 *0.22≈0.0001365. So total ≈ 0.014892 + 0.0001365 ≈ 0.0150285.

So total is 0.02422 + 0.0150285 ≈ 0.03925 cal/(mol·K²) ) * T^2.

Wait, but that's cal per mole, and the options are in kcal. So to convert to kcal, I need to divide by 1000. So, 0.03925 cal/mol is 0.00003925 kcal/mol. Wait, no, wait, that can't be right because that would make the numbers way too small.

Wait I think I messed up the units. Let's re-examine.

Wait, the calculation is ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * R * T^2.

Wait, but the units are as follows:

dP/dT is in atm/K.

R is in L·atm/(mol·K).

So, (atm/K) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) → (L·atm²)/(mol·K²).

Then, when multiplied by T^2 (K²), the units become (L·atm²)/(mol).

Each L·atm is 24.22 cal, so per mole.

So, the product (dP/dT * R * T²) gives us L·atm²/mol, which when converted to cal gives:

(L·atm²) * (24.22 cal/(L·atm)) ) * (1) → because it's per mole.

Wait, no, because it's (L·atm²)/mol → each L·atm is 24.22 cal, so per mole.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it this way:

ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * R * T^2.

Each term's units:

dP/dT: atm/K.

R: L·atm/(mol·K).

T^2: K².

Multiplying together:

(atm/K) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) ) * K² → (atm^2 * L) / (mol).

Because K cancels as (1/K) * K² → K.

Wait, no, let me compute the exponents:

Denominator: K * K → K².

Multiply by K² → K^(2-2) = K^0 = 1.

So overall units: (atm^2 * L) / mol.

But 1 L·atm is 24.22 cal, but here we have atm² * L. Hmm, that's not a standard unit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation differently. Since I know that at the normal boiling point, P = 1 atm, and dP/dT is given, perhaps I can find T.

Wait, another approach: The Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be approximated as:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2).

But that's the integrated form, assuming ΔH_vap is constant. But I'm not sure if that helps here because I don't have two points. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can relate the slope dP/dT to ΔH_vap. Because the slope is the derivative dP/dT at T = T_boil.

So, going back to the equation:

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T * (V_vapor)).

At T_boil, V_vapor is RT_boil / P, as before. So,

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T_boil * (R T_boil / P)) )

= (ΔH_vap * P) / (R T_boil^2 )

At T_boil, P is 1 atm, so:

dP/dT = ΔH_vap / (R T_boil^2 )

Rearranged:

ΔH_vap = dP/dT * R T_boil^2.

Yes, that's what I had earlier.

So, since I don't know T_boil yet, but I can relate it to the entropy using Trouton's rule.

From Trouton's rule, ΔS = ΔH_vap / T_boil = 21.7 cal/(mol·K).

So, ΔH_vap = 21.7 * T_boil.

So now I have two expressions for ΔH_vap:

1. ΔH_vap = dP/dT * R T_boil^2
2. ΔH_vap = 21.7 * T_boil

Setting them equal:

21.7 * T_boil = (dP/dT) * R * T_boil^2

Divide both sides by T_boil (assuming T_boil ≠ 0):

21.7 = (dP/dT) * R * T_boil

Now, solve for T_boil:

T_boil = 21.7 / (dP/dT * R )

But I have to make sure the units are correct.

dP/dT is given as 15 mm Hg/K. So, I need to convert that to atm/K.

15 mm Hg = 15/760 atm ≈ 0.01974 atm.

So dP/dT = 0.01974 atm/K.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So,

T_boil = 21.7 / (0.01974 * 0.0821 )

Compute the denominator first:

0.01974 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.00162.

So,

T_boil ≈ 21.7 / 0.00162 ≈ let's compute that.

21.7 / 0.00162 → 21.7 / 0.00162 = ?

Well, 0.00162 is 1.62e-3.

So 21.7 / 1.62e-3 = 21.7 * (1 / 1.62e-3) ) ≈ 21.7 * 617.28 ≈ let's compute:

21 * 617 = approx 12,957.

0.7 * 617 ≈ 431.9 → total approx 12,957 + 432 = 13,389 K? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 21.7 divided by 0.00162.

Let me compute 21.7 / 0.00162.

Well, 0.00162 = 1.62e-3.

So 21.7 / 1.62e-3 = (21.7 / 1.62) ) * 1e3.

Compute 21.7 / 1.62.

1.62 * 13 = 21.06. So 13.4 → 1.62 * 13.4 = 21.7 + 0.06 * 1.62 ≈ 0.0972, so perhaps 13.4 + (0.03/1.62) ≈ 13.418.

So, approx 13.418 * 1e3 = 13,418 K? That's impossible because the boiling points are way lower. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

From earlier:

ΔH_vap = (dP/dT) * R * T_boil^2.

And from Trouton's rule, ΔH_vap = 21.7 * T_boil.

So setting them equal: 21.7 T_boil = (dP/dT) R T_boil^2.

Divide both sides by T_boil (non-zero), get:

21.7 = (dP/dT) R T_boil.

So, T_boil = 21.7 / ( (dP/dT) * R )

Yes, that's correct. So, the denominator is (dP/dT * R )

So, let's compute (dP/dT * R )

dP/dT is 0.01974 atm/K.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Multiply them: 0.01974 *
