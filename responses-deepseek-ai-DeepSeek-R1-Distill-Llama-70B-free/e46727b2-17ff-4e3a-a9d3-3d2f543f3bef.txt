Question:

Explain how the MC = MR rule can be applied to the hiring of laborin a perfectly competitive market.

Options:

A: Firms hire an unlimited number of workers as long as they contribute any positive amount to total revenue.
B: In a perfectly competitive market, firms don't hire workers based on MRC = MRP rule.
C: MRC = MRP for labor and a firm will pay each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired.
D: Firms hire workers until the wage rate is equal to the average cost of labor.
E: Firms hire workers based on a fixed wage, regardless of marginal revenue or marginal costs.
F: Firms pay each worker a wage equal to the total revenue of the company.
G: Marginal revenue product of labor is ignored, and firms focus on minimizing the average cost of labor per worker.
H: Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor.
I: Each worker's wage is set by the average revenue product of all workers combined.
J: MRC = MRP and firms pay each worker a wage higher than the MRP of the last worker hired.

Okay, so I need to figure out how the MC = MR rule applies to hiring labor in a perfectly competitive market. Hmm, I remember that in economics, firms make decisions based on maximizing profits. The MC stands for Marginal Cost, and MR is Marginal Revenue. So when these two are equal, the firm is producing at the optimal level.

But wait, the question is specifically about hiring labor. Oh right, I think the concept here is about the Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) of labor. MRP is the additional revenue a firm gains from hiring one more worker. And the Marginal Resource Cost (MRC) is the additional cost of hiring that worker. So the firm should keep hiring as long as the MRP is greater than or equal to the MRC.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they can't influence the market wage. So the wage rate is determined by the market. Therefore, the MRC would be the market wage because that's what the firm has to pay each additional worker.

So the MC (Marginal Cost) in this context is the wage rate, which is MRC. The MR is the MRP of the last worker. So the rule is MRC = MRP. Firms will hire workers until the MRP of the next worker is just equal to the wage (MRC).

Looking at the options:

Option C says MRC = MRP and the firm pays each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired. That sounds right because the wage is MRC, which equals MRP at the optimal point.

Option H says firms hire until MCL exceeds MRPl. Wait, no, the correct rule is to stop when MRC > MRP. So H says until MCL exceeds, which is the same as stopping when MRP < MRC. So H is correct in the stopping condition. But the question is about applying the MC=MR rule, which is when MRC=MRP.

Wait, in this case, the rule is when MRC=MRP. So the correct application is that the firm hires until MRC equals MRP, which is what option C describes. Option H describes the stopping condition, not the rule itself.

So looking back, the correct answer should be C. Because when MRC equals MRP, the firm hires up to that point, and each worker is paid the wage equal to their MRP because in a competitive market, the wage is set by MRP at equilibrium.

Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, in a perfectly competitive labor market, the wage is determined by the market, so the firm takes the wage as given. So MRC is the wage, and MRP is calculated as marginal product times the price of the output. So the firm hires until MRP equals MRC (the wage). So when MRP equals MRC, that's the point where they stop hiring. So each worker's wage is equal to MRC, which is the market wage, which is also the MRP of the last worker.

So option C says the firm pays each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker. Yes, because the last worker's MRP equals the wage (MRC). So that fits.

Looking again, option H says they hire until MCL (I think that's a typo, maybe MRC) exceeds MRP. So if MRC is the wage, then when MRP drops below MRC, they stop. So H says they hire until MCL exceeds MRP. So I think H is correct in the stopping condition but not in the rule itself.

The rule is MRC=MRP, so the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me double-check the options.

Option C: MRC = MRP for labor and a firm will pay each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired.

Yes, that's correct because in equilibrium, the wage (MRC) equals MRP of the last worker. So each worker is paid according to their MRP at the margin, which is the market wage.

So the correct answer is C.

The MC = MR rule applies to the hiring of labor in a perfectly competitive market through the concept of Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) and Marginal Resource Cost (MRC). In this context, MRP represents the additional revenue a firm gains from hiring one more worker, while MRC is the additional cost of hiring that worker, which is the market wage in a perfectly competitive labor market. Firms hire workers until the MRP of the last worker equals the MRC (the market wage). This ensures profit maximization.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** correctly states that MRC = MRP for labor and that each worker is paid a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired. This aligns with the rule, as the market wage (MRC) equals the MRP of the last worker at equilibrium.
- **Option H** describes the stopping condition (when MRC exceeds MRP), but it does not directly explain the application of the MC = MR rule, which is the focus of the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it accurately describes how the MC = MR rule is applied to hiring labor in a perfectly competitive market.
