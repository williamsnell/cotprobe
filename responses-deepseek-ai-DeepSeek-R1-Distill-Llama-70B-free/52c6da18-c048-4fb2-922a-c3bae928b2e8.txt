Question:

Singer claims that famine relief organizations direct our aid to distant refugees:

Options:

A: with a focus on quantity over quality, leading to possible misallocation.
B: very inefficiently, and are therefore not worth donating to.
C: with a high level of bureaucracy and corruption, therefore not recommended.
D: more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors.
E: extremely efficiently, making them the only viable option for aid distribution.
F: very effectively, but only in certain regions.
G: moderately efficiently, although there may be better alternatives.
H: almost as effectively as we could get it to our close neighbors.
I: effectively, but at a high operational cost.

Okay, so I've got this question about Singer and famine relief organizations. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Singer claims about how these organizations direct aid to distant refugees. The options are from A to I. Let me recall what I know about Singer's views.

I remember that Peter Singer is a utilitarian philosopher. His famous "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" article argues that people have a moral obligation to help those in need, even if they're far away. He uses the example of a child drowning in a pondâ€”if you can save the child without sacrificing something of comparable moral importance, you should do it. He applies this to global poverty and famine, saying that we should give to help those in need as long as it doesn't cause comparable harm to ourselves.

So, Singer emphasizes the effectiveness of aid. He argues that distance doesn't matter morally; if we can help, we should. But he's also practical. I think he might say that aid can be effectively delivered to distant places, maybe even more so than helping locally under certain conditions.

Looking at the options:

Option D says more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors. That sounds like something Singer might argue because he's saying that distance isn't a barrier. But wait, does he say that aid is more effective when sent far, or just that we should send it regardless of distance?

Another thought: Singer might acknowledge that sometimes local help can be easier, but when it comes to severe issues like famine, the need is so great that even if there's some inefficiency, the moral obligation remains. But the question is about how he claims the organizations direct aid, not the moral obligation.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up his points. In his work, Singer doesn't necessarily say that distant aid is more effective, but rather that we have the same moral duty to help both nearby and far. So perhaps the effectiveness isn't the main point here.

Looking again, the options are about how the organizations direct aid. Option D says they do it more effectively than to close neighbors. I'm not sure if Singer makes that claim. Alternatively, maybe he says that aid can be effective when sent to distant places, so organizations do it effectively.

Option I says effectively, but at a high operational cost. That could be possible, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: Singer's argument is more about our moral duty, not necessarily the efficiency of the organizations. But the question is about what Singer claims regarding the direction of aid by these organizations.

I think I might be overcomplicating. Let's think about what Singer actually says. He argues that we should give to those in need regardless of distance, implying that it's possible to help effectively. So perhaps he would say that aid is directed effectively, even to distant places.

Looking at the options again, option D suggests that aid is more effective when sent to distant refugees than to close neighbors. I'm not sure if Singer makes that exact claim. Alternatively, option H says almost as effectively as to close neighbors, which might align with his view that distance doesn't negate the moral duty, implying that effectiveness is comparable.

Wait, no, the question is about Singer's claim, not the moral duty. If Singer argues that we can effectively help distant refugees, then perhaps the answer is that they direct aid effectively, but I don't see that option. Let me check the options again.

Option D: more effectively than to close neighbors. That's a strong statement, and I'm not sure Singer goes that far. Option H says almost as effectively, which might be more accurate. Alternatively, option I says effectively but with high costs.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing this with other views. Wait, another thought: Singer does discuss that sometimes aid can be misdirected or less effective in certain contexts, but he still argues that we should give because the need is so great. So maybe he doesn't claim that they're extremely efficient, but rather that they do it effectively enough that we should still support them.

Wait, the original question is about Singer's claim regarding how famine relief organizations direct aid. In his writing, I think he argues that aid can be effective and that we should support it, but he might also acknowledge that there are challenges. However, the exact wording in the options is crucial.

Looking at the options, option D seems to suggest that distant aid is more effective, which I'm not sure about. Option I says effectively but with high costs. Option H says almost as effectively as to neighbors. I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the context. Singer's main point is the moral obligation, but he might also address the effectiveness. If he's advocating for giving to distant refugees, he must believe that the aid can be effective, otherwise his argument would be weakened.

So perhaps the correct option is D: more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors. Or maybe H: almost as effectively. Alternatively, maybe he says that aid is directed effectively but at a cost.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that Singer claims that aid is directed effectively, but I don't see an option that exactly matches that. Let me check the options again.

Option I: effectively, but at a high operational cost. That could be a possibility. Or option D.

Wait, I think I remember Singer's article mentioning that aid can be effective. So perhaps the answer is that they direct it effectively, but which option says that?

Looking again:

Option D: more effectively than to neighbors.

Option I: effectively, but high cost.

Option H: almost as effectively as to neighbors.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the answer is D. Because Singer's argument is that we can help distant people just as effectively, so maybe he claims that these organizations do it more effectively than helping locally. Alternatively, perhaps he just says that they do it effectively, not necessarily more so.

Wait, another angle: sometimes local aid can have more obstacles, like knowing the community better, but distant aid might have more logistical challenges. So maybe Singer argues that despite the distance, aid can be effective, but not necessarily more so than local.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: almost as effectively as we could get it to our close neighbors. Because Singer's point is that distance doesn't make a moral difference, implying that effectiveness is comparable.

I'm starting to lean towards H. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another thought: Singer's argument is that we have the same moral obligation to help those in distant famines as to those nearby. So in terms of effectiveness, he might be saying that the aid can be just as effective when directed to distant places, so option H would make sense.

Yes, that makes sense. Singer is saying that we can help effectively regardless of distance, so the effectiveness is almost the same as helping neighbors.

The question asks about Singer's claim regarding how famine relief organizations direct aid to distant refugees. Singer, a utilitarian philosopher, argues in his work "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" that individuals have a moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of distance. He emphasizes that the effectiveness of aid is not inherently diminished by distance, and he advocates for supporting famine relief organizations because they can deliver aid effectively to those in dire need.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** suggests that aid is directed more effectively to distant refugees than to close neighbors. While Singer argues that distance does not negate the moral obligation to help, he does not explicitly claim that distant aid is more effective than local aid.
- **Option H** states that aid is directed almost as effectively to distant refugees as to close neighbors. This aligns with Singer's view that effectiveness is comparable regardless of distance, as he believes aid can be delivered effectively to both groups.
- Other options, such as **Option I**, introduce additional factors like operational costs, which are not central to Singer's argument about the effectiveness of aid distribution.

Given Singer's emphasis on the moral obligation to help and his belief in the comparable effectiveness of aid regardless of distance, **Option H** best captures his claim.

Answer: H
