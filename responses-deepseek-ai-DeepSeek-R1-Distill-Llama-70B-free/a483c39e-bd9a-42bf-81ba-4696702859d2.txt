Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about classifying reactions as heterogeneous or homogeneous. Hmm, I remember from my notes that homogeneous reactions have all reactants and products in the same phase, right? Like everything is a gas or all aqueous, no solids or liquids if others are gases. And heterogeneous reactions have different phases involved. So I guess I need to look for an equation where the phases are mixed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2C₂H₂(g) + 5O₂(g) → 4CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g). All gases here. So this is homogeneous.

Option B: C₂H₂(g) + 5N₂O(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(g) + 5N₂(g). Again, all reactants and products are gases. Homogeneous.

Option C: C₂H₅OH(aq) + O₂(aq) → HC₂H₃O₂(aq) + H₂O(aq). Both are aqueous, so homogeneous.

Option D: C(s) + H₂O(g) → H₂(g) + CO(g). Oh wait, here the reactants are solid and gas. So the phases are different. The products are gases, but the reactants include a solid. So this is heterogeneous.

Option E: N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g). All gases, homogeneous.

Option F: 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g). All gases again, so homogeneous.

Option G: 2CO(g) + O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g). Gases, homogeneous.

Option H: 2H₂O₂(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g). Wait, the products have liquid and gas. So phases are aqueous (reactant) becomes liquid and gas. So different phases here, so this must be heterogeneous.

Option I: CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g). All gases, homogeneous.

Wait, so I need to pick the best example of a heterogeneous reaction. Both D and H are heterogeneous. But let me read the options again.

The question is which is best classified as heterogeneous. So I think any reaction where more than one phase is present is heterogeneous.

Looking at D: Reactant is solid and gas. Products are both gases. So two phases in reactants, but the products are same phase. So the reaction mixture includes solid, gas, and gaseous products. So it's heterogeneous.

For H: Reactant is aqueous, products are liquid and gas. So multiple phases in products. So that's also heterogeneous.

Wait, but which is the best example. The question gives only one correct answer. So maybe I should think about what each option represents.

Wait, the initial question says "can be classified as either heterogeneous or homogeneous". So each option is either one or the other.

So looking back, I think the key is that a heterogeneous reaction has more than one phase present. So for example, if a reaction has a solid and a gas, that's heterogeneous because the reactants are in different phases.

So in option D, C (solid) and H2O (gas) are the reactants. So two different phases in the reactants. The products are H2 and CO, both gases, so same phase.

So this reaction involves multiple phases, so it's heterogeneous.

Option H: H2O2 is aqueous, which is a liquid (well, technically aqueous is a solution), and it produces water (liquid) and O2 gas. So the products have two phases: liquid and gas. So the overall system isn't in a single phase, so it's heterogeneous.

So both D and H are heterogeneous.

Wait, but the question asks for the best example. Maybe I should look at the context of each reaction.

Wait, in D, you have a solid and a gas reacting. That's a clear heterogeneous case because the reactants are in different phases. While in H, the reactant is aqueous (so liquid phase), and the products are a liquid and gas, but the reaction occurs in solution? Or does it produce a gas that bubbles out, making it heterogeneous.

Hmm, the way the question is phrased, I think any reaction with differing phases in either reactants or products is heterogeneous.

Looking back, the options are:

The question is about which is best classified as a heterogeneous reaction. So more than one phase is present.

So the correct options are D and H.

Wait, but the options are A to I, so which one is correct? Let me think about the definitions again.

In a homogeneous reaction, all substances are in the same phase. Heterogeneous has at least two different phases.

So in option D, solid carbon and gaseous H2O react to produce gases. So the reactants are different phases. So that's heterogeneous.

Option H: Reactant is aqueous (so liquid), and products are liquid and gas, so multiple phases. So that's also heterogeneous.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the following is best classified as a heterogeneous reaction. So perhaps both D and H are correct, but since the options are single, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, maybe I need to check all options.

Wait, the question says 'which of the following equations is best classified as a heterogeneous reaction'. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, let me think again. Option D has solid and gas as reactants. So that's two phases. Option H has aqueous (so liquid) as reactant, and products are liquid and gas. So that's two phases as well.

Wait, but are all the products in the same phase? Hmm, in H, H2O is liquid, O2 is gas, so different phases. So the products are in different phases, making it heterogeneous.

So both D and H are heterogeneous. But the options only have one correct answer, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look if any of these options have a solid in the product. Because if a solid is formed, that's a separate phase. So for example, if the product is a precipitate, that's heterogeneous.

Looking at the options, option D's products are gases. So all products are same phase. Hmm. But the reactants have solid and gas.

So D is a solid and a gas reacting. So that's a heterogeneous mixture.

Option H has liquid and gas in products. So that's also a heterogeneous mixture.

So both D and H are heterogeneous. But the options only have one correct answer, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the options involve more than two phases.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option D. Let me re-examine it.

Option D: C(s) + H₂O(g) → H₂(g) + CO(g). So the reactants are solid and gas. The products are both gases. So during the reaction, the solid is present along with the gas. So the reaction mixture has solid and gas. So it's definitely heterogeneous.

Option H: 2H₂O₂(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g). Here, the reactant is aqueous (so liquid), and the products are liquid and gas. So the products are two phases, but the reactant is a single phase (aqueous is a solution, considered a single phase). So the reaction occurs in solution, but the products form a liquid and a gas, which are separate phases. So the system after reaction is heterogeneous.

So both D and H are heterogeneous. But the answer options only have one correct choice. Wait, looking back, maybe I'm misremembering the options.

Wait, the options are A to I, each with their own equations. The question is, which is the best example of a heterogeneous reaction.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is D because the reactants are in different phases, while in H, all reactants are in the same phase (aqueous), but the products are in different phases.

Wait, but whether the reactants or products are in different phases, the overall reaction is heterogeneous. So both D and H are correct. But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps in the given options, only D is correct, and H is homogeneous. Or maybe I'm confusing the phases.

Wait, in option H, the reactant is H2O2(aq), and products are H2O(l) and O2(g). So the reactant is in aqueous (liquid) phase, and products are liquid and gas. So the products are two phases, making the overall mixture heterogeneous.

But wait, the system is heterogeneous if any part of it is in different phases. So both D and H are correct.

But looking at the answer options, perhaps only one is intended as correct. Let me think about the examples I know.

For example, a reaction where a solid and a gas react is definitely heterogeneous. Like combustion of carbon (solid) with oxygen (gas) to form CO2 (gas). So that's a solid and gas. So D fits that scenario.

Another example is a solution reaction where a precipitate forms. Like Na2CO3(aq) + CaCl2(aq) → CaCO3(s) + 2NaCl(aq). Here, the reactants are aqueous, but the product CaCO3 is a solid. So that's heterogeneous.

But in option H, the reactant is aqueous, and products are liquid and gas. So the reaction occurs in solution (homogeneous) but produces gas, which is a different phase. So the overall system becomes heterogeneous.

So when the reaction occurs, the solution is homogeneous, but the products form a gas and a liquid, making the overall mixture heterogeneous.

Wait, but the classification of the reaction itself is about whether the reactants and products are in the same phase or not.

I think that any reaction where not all reactants and products are in the same phase is considered heterogeneous.

So in option D, the reactants are in different phases (solid and gas), making the reaction heterogeneous.

In option H, the reactant is in one phase, but products are in two. So the reaction itself is heterogeneous.

So both D and H are correct, but the question expects only one answer.

Wait, perhaps looking at the possible answer choices, the intended answer is D because it's a clear case of solid and gas in the reactants, making it obviously heterogeneous.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because it's producing gas and liquid, which are different phases. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that a homogeneous reaction occurs in a single phase, and a heterogeneous reaction has multiple phases. So in option D, the reactants are solid and gas—so two phases, thus heterogeneous. In H, the reactant is aqueous (single phase), but the products are two phases. So the products are heterogeneous, but are the reactants homogeneous? Hmm.

Wait, the classification is about the entire reaction. So if any of the reactants or products are in different phases, the reaction is heterogeneous.

So both D and H are heterogeneous. But the options may have only D as correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the correct answer is either D or H. Let me check the options list again.

Options:

A: All gas, homogeneous.

B: All gas, homogeneous.

C: All aqueous, homogeneous.

D: Solid and gas → gases. Reactants have two phases, so heterogeneous.

E: All gas, homogeneous.

F: All gas, homogeneous.

G: All gas, homogeneous.

H: Aqueous → liquid and gas. So the products are two phases, making the reaction heterogeneous.

I: All gas, homogeneous.

So both D and H are correct, but perhaps the options only have one correct answer, so maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for a reaction where the reactants are in different phases, rather than the products.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because the reactants are in different phases, which makes it a clear case, whereas H's reactants are in the same phase but products are different.

But according to the definition, as long as any part of the reaction system is in a different phase, it's heterogeneous.

So both are correct, but perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused now. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that H is correct.

Wait, in option H, the reactant is H2O2(aq), which is a solution—a homogeneous mixture. The products are H2O(l) and O2(g). So the products form two separate phases. So the reaction involves a change from a single phase to multiple phases, making it heterogeneous.

So both D and H are correct, but the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible correct answer. The options are:

The question is asking which is the best example. So perhaps D is the better example because it's a solid and gas reacting, which is a classic example of a heterogeneous reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps H is correct because it's a decomposition in solution producing gas and liquid, making it heterogeneous.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for which option has more than one phase in the reactants.

Option D: C(s) + H2O(g) → H2(g) + CO(g). Reactants: solid and gas.

Option H: 2H2O2(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g). Reactants: aqueous (liquid). Products: liquid and gas.

So D has two phases in reactants, H has two phases in products.

Which of these is a better example of a heterogeneous reaction? I think both are.

But if the answer options only have one correct, perhaps the answer is D. Because when considering the reactants, having different phases is a clear indication.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it this way: a homogeneous reaction can only occur in a single phase. So if any of the reactants are in different phases, it's heterogeneous.

So in D, the reactants are in different phases, making the reaction heterogeneous.

In H, the reactants are in the same phase, but the products are not. However, the reaction is still considered heterogeneous because the products are in different phases.

But perhaps the way the question is phrased, the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps I should think of examples. For example, the combustion of wood (solid) is a heterogeneous reaction because it's solid reacting with gaseous oxygen. Similarly, D is a solid and gas, so it's a classic example.

H's reaction is an example of a decomposition in solution, producing gas, which is a heterogeneous mixture.

So both are correct. But the options only have one correct choice.

Hmm, perhaps I should refer to standard examples.

In the AP Chemistry curriculum, reactions are classified based on whether all reactants and products are in the same phase.

So, for example:

Homogeneous: 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) (if all products are liquid, but wait, no, because the reactants are gases and product is liquid, so that's heterogeneous.

Wait, no, wait. If a reaction has all reactants and products in the same phase, it's homogeneous. So if all are gas or all are aqueous, it's homogeneous.

If any phase differs, it's heterogeneous.

So, in option D: solid and gas → gas. So reactants are in different phases; thus, heterogeneous.

In option H: aqueous → liquid and gas. So products are in different phases; thus, heterogeneous.

So both are correct. But the options only have one correct answer, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D or H. But the given options are A to I, so perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D because in H, the reaction occurs in solution, so the H2O2 is aqueous, and the products are liquid and gas. So the system is heterogeneous because the products are in different phases.

But according to the classification, any presence of different phases makes it heterogeneous.

So both D and H are correct, but perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is D because the reactants include a solid, which is a clear example of heterogeneous.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is D.

To classify a reaction as heterogeneous or homogeneous, we examine the phases of the reactants and products. A **homogeneous reaction** involves all substances in the same phase, while a **heterogeneous reaction** involves substances in different phases.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: All reactants and products are gases. Homogeneous.
- **B**: All reactants and products are gases. Homogeneous.
- **C**: All reactants and products are aqueous. Homogeneous.
- **D**: Reactants include a solid (C) and a gas (H₂O), and products are gases. Since the reactants are in different phases, this is heterogeneous.
- **E**: All reactants and products are gases. Homogeneous.
- **F**: All reactants and products are gases. Homogeneous.
- **G**: All reactants and products are gases. Homogeneous.
- **H**: Reactant is aqueous (liquid phase), and products include a liquid (H₂O) and a gas (O₂). Since the products are in different phases, this is heterogeneous.
- **I**: All reactants and products are gases. Homogeneous.

### Key Observations:
- **Option D** is heterogeneous because the reactants (solid and gas) are in different phases.
- **Option H** is also heterogeneous because the products (liquid and gas) are in different phases.

However, the question asks for the **best example** of a heterogeneous reaction. While both D and H are correct, **D** is the clearer example because it involves reactants in different phases, which is a classic indicator of a heterogeneous reaction. In contrast, H involves a reaction in a single phase (aqueous) that produces multiple phases, which may not be as straightforward an example.

### Final Answer:
The best example of a heterogeneous reaction is **D**.
