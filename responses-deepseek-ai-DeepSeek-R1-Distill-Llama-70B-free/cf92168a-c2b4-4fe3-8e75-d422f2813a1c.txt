Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the de Broglie wavelength for an electron with a kinetic energy of 100 eV. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle, right?

Wait, the formula I think is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. But how do I find the momentum when I'm given the kinetic energy? Oh right, I remember that kinetic energy (KE) is related to momentum. For non-relativistic speeds, which I think applies here, KE is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So I can rearrange that to find p in terms of KE.

Let me write that down. KE = p²/(2m) → p = sqrt(2m*KE). But wait, the KE is given in electron volts, eV. I need to convert that into joules because the standard units for these constants are in SI units. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 100 eV is 100 times that, which is 1.602e-17 J.

Now, what's the mass of an electron? I think it's approximately 9.109 x 10^-31 kilograms. And Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So putting it all together.

First, calculate p: p = sqrt(2 * m * KE). Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-17 J. Let me compute that. 2 * 9e-31 is roughly 1.8e-30, multiplied by 1.6e-17 gives about 2.88e-47. So p is the square root of that. Hmm, sqrt(2.88e-47) is approximately... Let me see, sqrt(2.88) is about 1.7, so 1.7e-23.5? Wait, exponents: 1e-47 is (1e-23.5)^2. So 1e-23.5 is 1e-23 * 1e-0.5, which is around 3.16e-24. So 1.7 * 3.16e-24 is about 5.37e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, but wait, actually, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more precisely. Let me compute 2mKE first. 2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 100 eV. But wait, 100 eV is 1.602e-17 J. So 2 * 9.109e-31 * 1.602e-17 = 2 * 9.109e-31 * 1.602e-17. Let me compute that: 9.109e-31 * 1.602e-17 is approx 1.46e-47. Multiply by 2, it's about 2.92e-47 kg²·m²/s². So p is sqrt(2.92e-47) → sqrt(2.92) is about 1.708, so 1.708e-23.5 kg·m/s. Because sqrt(1e-47) is 1e-23.5, which is 3.16e-24. So 1.708 * 3.16e-24 → let's compute 1.708 * 3.16. 1.7 *3 is 5.1, 0.008*3.16 is about 0.025, so around 5.125e-24 kg·m/s?

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a different formula that combines everything. Oh wait, there's a direct formula for the de Broglie wavelength when given kinetic energy in eV. I think the formula is lambda = h / sqrt(2mKE), but since KE is in eV, I need to convert it into joules or use a version with constants adjusted for eV.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the relation involving the electron charge. There's a shortcut formula I found before: lambda (in nm) is approximately sqrt(150/(KE in eV)). Wait, let me think. The formula comes from lambda = h / sqrt(2mE), where E is in joules. So substituting E in eV converted to J: E = KE_eV * e, where e is 1.6e-19 J/eV.

So substituting, lambda = h / sqrt(2m * KE_eV * e). Plugging numbers, h is 6.626e-34, m is 9.109e-31 kg, e is 1.6e-19 C·V (joules per eV).

So let's compute the denominator: sqrt(2 * m * e * KE). So 2*m*e*KE = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.6e-19 J/eV * 100 eV. The eV cancels out. So 2 * 9.109e-31 * 1.6e-19 * 100 = 2 * 9.109 * 1.6 * 100 * 1e-50 (since 1e-31 *1e-19 is 1e-50). So 2*9.109 is ~18.218, 18.218 *1.6 is ~29.1488, multiplied by 100 gives 2914.88, so 2914.88e-50 → 2.91488e-47. So the denominator is sqrt(2.91488e-47) = sqrt(2.91488) * 1e-23.5. The square root of 2.91488 is about 1.707, so the denominator is 1.707e-23.5 kg·m/s.

Wait, 1e-23.5 is the same as 1e-24 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162e-24. So 1.707 * 3.162e-24 ≈ 5.397e-24 kg·m/s.

So lambda is h divided by that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So 6.626e-34 / 5.397e-24 = approximately (6.626 /5.397 )e-10 meters. 6.626 /5.397 is about 1.228. So lambda ≈1.228e-10 meters, which is 0.1228 nanometers. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 0.123 nm, which is close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made an error in the approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise formula. Another approach is to use the formula: lambda (in Ångströms) = sqrt( (150) / (KE in eV) ). Wait, let me confirm that. Because 1 Å is 0.1 nm. So if I calculate in Å, I can convert to nm by dividing by 10.

So using that formula for lambda in Å: lambda = sqrt(150 / KE). So for KE=100 eV, lambda = sqrt(150/100) = sqrt(1.5) ≈ 1.2247 Å, which is 0.12247 nm. That's very close to option D, which is 0.123 nm. So that's matching.

Wait, but why does that formula work? Let me see. The formula comes from combining the constants. Let me rederive it to confirm. So starting from lambda = h / sqrt(2mE). E in joules is KE_eV * e. So lambda = h / sqrt(2 m e KE_eV ). Let's plug in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
m = 9.109e-31 kg
e = 1.6e-19 J/eV
KE_eV = 100 eV.

So compute denominator: sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *1.6e-19 *100) = sqrt(2*9.109e-31 *1.6e-17) = sqrt(2 *9.109 *1.6 *1e-48) ). Wait, 2*9.109 is ~18.218, multiplied by 1.6 gives ~29.149. So inside the sqrt: 29.149e-48 → 2.9149e-47. Square root is sqrt(2.9149e-47) = sqrt(2.9149)*1e-23.5 ≈1.707 *3.162e-24 ≈5.397e-24 kg·m/s.

So lambda = 6.626e-34 /5.397e-24 = (6.626/5.397) * 1e-10 m. 6.626/5.397 is about 1.228, so 1.228e-10 m = 0.1228 nm. So 0.123 nm, which is option D.

But wait, let me check why the other formula gives the same result. The formula lambda (Å) = sqrt(150 / KE). For KE=100, sqrt(1.5)≈1.2247 Å → 0.12247 nm. So same as option D.

So the correct answer is D: 0.123 nm.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength for an electron with a kinetic energy of \( 100 \, \mathrm{eV} \), we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE}}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( E = 100 \, \mathrm{eV} \) (kinetic energy in electron volts).

Since \( E \) is given in electron volts, it must be converted to joules using \( 1 \, \mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \). Thus, \( E = 100 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 1.602 \times 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{J} \).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{\sqrt{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-17}}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-17}} = \sqrt{2.914 \times 10^{-47}} \approx 1.707 \times 10^{-23.5} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot m/s}
\]

Now, calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.707 \times 10^{-23.5}} \approx 1.228 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} = 0.1228 \, \mathrm{nm}
\]

This result is consistent with the shortcut formula for the de Broglie wavelength in nanometers:

\[
\lambda \, (\mathrm{nm}) = \sqrt{\frac{150}{\text{KE (eV)}}}
\]

For \( \text{KE} = 100 \, \mathrm{eV} \):

\[
\lambda = \sqrt{\frac{150}{100}} = \sqrt{1.5} \approx 1.2247 \, \mathrm{\AA} = 0.12247 \, \mathrm{nm}
\]

Both methods give approximately \( 0.123 \, \mathrm{nm} \), which matches option D.
