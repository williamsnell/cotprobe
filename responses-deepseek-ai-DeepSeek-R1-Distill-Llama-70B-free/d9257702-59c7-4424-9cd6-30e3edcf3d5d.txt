Question:

A defendant was arrested and prosecuted for the crime of false pretenses. At trial, the defendant testified that she prophesied the victim's imminent death. The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?

Options:

A: A juror was overheard discussing the details of the case outside the courtroom during the trial.
B: A juror admitted to having a personal financial interest in the outcome of the case.
C: A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.
D: A juror admitted to having made a decision about the verdict before the trial began.
E: Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.
F: A juror stated that she didn't believe in the concept of false pretenses, and therefore thought the defendant was not guilty from the start.
G: A juror confessed to having previously known the defendant but did not disclose this during jury selection.
H: A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.
I: A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the grounds for a new trial after a conviction. The defendant was found guilty of false pretenses, and she's trying to get a new trial based on some affidavit from a juror. I need to figure out which fact in the options would most likely help her get a new trial.

First, I should remember what false pretenses entails. False pretenses involve obtaining title to someone else's property through a knowing misrepresentation of a material fact with intent to defraud. So the defendant in this case told the victim she could save him if he brought money, then she took the money and replaced it with waste paper. That seems to fit the crime.

Now, the defendant moved for a new trial and submitted jurors' affidavits. I recall that generally, jurors can't impeach their own verdict under the "no impeachment rule." So they can't just say they made a mistake or misunderstood instructions. But there are exceptions, like if there was external influence, juror misconduct, or if the juror was biased and didn't disclose it during voir dire.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: A juror was overheard discussing the case outside the courtroom. That sounds like juror misconduct. But does it necessarily affect the verdict? Maybe, but I'm not sure if this alone is enough. It depends on what they were discussing. If they were just talking about the weather, maybe not. But if they were discussing case details in a way that showed bias or outside influence, then it could be a problem. But I'm not certain this is the strongest option.

Option B: A juror had a personal financial interest in the outcome. This sounds like a conflict of interest. If a juror has a financial stake, they might be biased. For example, if the case involved a company they own shares in, and the outcome affects the stock price. But in this case, the crime is false pretenses against an individual. Unless the juror, say, is related to the victim or something, which isn't stated here. So I'm not sure if this is applicable unless more context is given.

Option C: A juror had personal animosity toward the defendant and admitted it during deliberations. Personal animosity could mean bias, which could prevent a fair trial. If a juror had such feelings and didn't disclose them during jury selection, that could be grounds. But wait, during voir dire, potential jurors are usually asked about biases. If the juror hid it then, that could be grounds for a new trial.

Option D: A juror made a decision before the trial began. So they decided guilt or innocence before hearing any evidence. That's a problem because the juror wasn't impartial. But again, the question is whether this can be shown through an affidavit. I think this could be a basis because it shows the juror was biased from the start.

Option E: A juror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument. Missing part of the trial could mean the juror didn't consider all the evidence. But courts are sometimes lenient about this unless it's a significant portion. I'm not sure if this alone would be enough for a new trial, as the juror might have still heard enough to make a decision.

Option F: A juror didn't believe in the concept of false pretenses and thought the defendant wasn't guilty from the start. This seems like a misunderstanding of the law. But jurors are expected to follow the law as instructed. If a juror disregards the law, that's a problem. However, in this case, the juror's belief might not necessarily be misconduct unless it shows they refused to apply the law correctly, leading to a biased verdict.

Option G: A juror knew the defendant before but didn't disclose it during selection. This is a big one. If a juror had a prior relationship with the defendant and didn't mention it during voir dire, that's a serious issue. It could mean the juror was biased and should have been excluded. This would likely warrant a new trial because it goes to the heart of jury impartiality.

Option H: A juror misunderstood the burden of proof instructions. That's concerning, but generally, the courts don't allow jurors to impeach the verdict based on their understanding of the law. Unless the misunderstanding was so severe that it prevented a fair trial, but that's a high bar.

Option I: A juror read a newspaper article about the defendant's other schemes, violating the court's instructions. This is external information that the juror shouldn't have considered. It's a clear case of juror misconduct because they were exposed to extrinsic evidence. This could definitely taint the verdict and would be a strong basis for a new trial.

Now, I need to decide which of these is the best option. The key is which situation provides a solid ground for a new trial. 

Option G involves a juror who knew the defendant, which is a clear bias that wasn't disclosed. That's a strong point because it directly affects impartiality. Similarly, Option I involves a juror seeking outside information, which is a direct violation of trial rules. 

But wait, I'm trying to remember what's an automatic ground for a new trial. Jurors being biased because they knew the defendant is a classic reason. Also, if a juror intentionally hides a relationship during voir dire, that's a serious issue. 

Option I is about external information influencing the verdict. That's also a strong point because it introduces facts not in evidence, which the jury shouldn't consider.

Comparing G and I: which is more likely to get a new trial?

In some cases, knowing the defendant and failing to disclose it is a significant problem. It could show that the juror had a personal connection that affected their judgment. Similarly, reading a newspaper article about other crimes is a clear no-no because it introduces extrinsic evidence.

I'm a bit torn between G and I. But perhaps G is more directly about the juror's bias, while I is about external influence.

Wait, the question is about which affidavit would most likely be the basis. Let's think about the rules. Generally, the no impeachment rule (like Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b)) limits what jurors can testify about. They can't testify about their mental processes but can testify about external influences or biases that weren't disclosed.

So for Option G, the juror's prior acquaintance with the defendant is an external fact that could show bias. If the juror was supposed to disclose that during voir dire and didn't, that's a valid ground because it's an external fact, not just the juror's thoughts.

Option I, the juror reading a newspaper article, is also an external factâ€”exposure to outside information. So both G and I seem valid. 

But which is more likely to be considered? I think both are strong, but perhaps G is more about the juror's own bias, while I is about external influence. Depending on the jurisdiction, either could be grounds. 

Wait, another thought: when a juror has a prior relationship, this can lead to a motion for a new trial based on the juror's failure to disclose during voir dire. This is a classic ground because it directly relates to the juror's impartiality.

So perhaps Option G is the best choice here. Alternatively, Option I is about the juror's own actions violating court instructions, which is also strong.

But I think Option I might be more directly an external influence that affected the verdict. For example, if the article implicated the defendant in similar schemes, that's evidence not presented at trial, and the juror used it to decide guilt.

So I'm a bit split. Let me think again about the options.

Option G is about a juror knowing the defendant and not disclosing it. That's a clear case of possible bias and can be a basis for a new trial because it's a fact that could have led to the juror being struck for cause if known.

Option I is about the juror seeking outside information, which is a direct violation and taints the trial.

I think both G and I are strong, but which is more likely to be the correct answer? Let me recall past bar questions. Often, the key is whether the juror was exposed to extrinsic evidence, which is a clear ground for a new trial.

So Option I: the juror read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in similar schemes. That's extrinsic evidence that the juror shouldn't have considered. This would taint the verdict because it introduces new information not presented at trial.

Therefore, I think Option I is the correct answer.

To determine which fact would most likely provide the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial, it is essential to analyze each option in light of legal principles surrounding jury impartiality, juror misconduct, and the "no impeachment rule." This rule generally prohibits jurors from testifying about their deliberative processes but allows exceptions for external influences, undisclosed biases, or misconduct.

- **Option A**: A juror discussing the case outside the courtroom could indicate misconduct, but without evidence of bias or external influence affecting the verdict, this is less likely to suffice for a new trial.

- **Option B**: A juror with a personal financial interest in the outcome could introduce bias, but this option lacks specific context showing how the interest directly impacted the case.

- **Option C**: Personal animosity toward the defendant during deliberations suggests bias, but this is generally barred by the "no impeachment rule" unless it involves an undisclosed fact.

- **Option D**: A juror deciding the verdict before the trial began indicates bias, but this is also subject to the "no impeachment rule" unless tied to an external fact.

- **Option E**: A juror falling asleep during closing arguments might indicate inattentiveness, but courts are often lenient unless it significantly impacted the juror's ability to evaluate evidence.

- **Option F**: A juror disbelieving the concept of false pretenses could indicate a refusal to follow the law, but this is typically not grounds for a new trial unless tied to external misconduct.

- **Option G**: A juror failing to disclose a prior relationship with the defendant during voir dire is a serious issue, as it directly impacts impartiality. This is a classic ground for a new trial because it involves an undisclosed fact that could have led to the juror being excluded.

- **Option H**: A juror misunderstanding the burden of proof is concerning but generally not grounds for a new trial unless the misunderstanding was so severe as to prevent a fair trial.

- **Option I**: A juror reading a newspaper article implicating the defendant in similar schemes is a clear violation of court instructions and introduces extrinsic evidence. This directly taints the verdict and is a strong basis for a new trial.

While both **Option G** and **Option I** are strong candidates, **Option I** is more directly tied to external influence and misconduct, making it the most likely basis for securing a new trial. The introduction of extrinsic evidence not presented at trial undermines the integrity of the verdict, providing a clear and compelling ground for relief.
