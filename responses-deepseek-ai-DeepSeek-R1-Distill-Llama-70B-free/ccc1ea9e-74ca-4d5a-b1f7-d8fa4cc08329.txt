Okay, so I have this question about money supply and reserve ratios. Hmm, I remember that when a bank gets a deposit, it doesn't just sit there; the bank can lend most of it out. But wait, they have to keep a certain percentage as reserves. Oh right, the required reserve ratio. 

The question says that $1,000 is deposited, and the reserve ratio r is 15%. So the bank can't lend out all of it. They have to keep 15% as reserves. Let me think, 15% of 1000 is 150. So the bank keeps $150 and can lend out the rest, which is $850.

Now, the total money supply isn't just that initial deposit. Because when the bank lends out the $850, the borrower will deposit it somewhere else, right? So each time the money is lent, it gets redeposited, and each bank involved can lend out 85% of that. This creates a multiplier effect.

Wait, the money multiplier formula is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. Oh wait, no, the formula is 1/r. Because the multiplier is how much the money supply increases for each dollar deposited. So here, r is 0.15, so 1/0.15 is approximately 6.666... So the total change in money supply should be the initial deposit multiplied by this.

So 1000 * (1 / 0.15) equals 1000 * 6.666..., which is about 6666.66. Looking at the options, the closest one is D: $5667? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Did I get the formula wrong? Oh wait, wait, I think I might have confused something.

Wait another approach: the initial deposit is $1000. The bank keeps $150, lends $850. The borrower deposits $850 elsewhere. The next bank keeps 15% of 850, which is $127.50, and lends $722.50. So each time, the amount lent is 85% of the previous. So the total money supply is initial deposit plus all the subsequent loans.

So the total increase is 1000 + 850 + 722.5 + ... and so on. This is a geometric series where each term is 0.85 times the previous. The sum of an infinite geometric series is a/(1 - r), where a is the first term after the initial. Or wait, the total increase is the initial deposit times (1 + 0.85 + 0.85^2 + 0.85^3 + ...), which is 1/(1 - 0.85) = 1/0.15 ≈ 6.666...

So 1000 * 6.666... is 6666.66, approximately $6,666.67. Looking back at the options, none of them exactly match that. Let's see the options again.

Options are A: 3333, B:1500, C:4000, D:5667, E:6000, F:7000, G:150, H:1000, I:2500, J:850.

Wait, I don't see an option close to 6667. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the potential change, which could be the maximum possible. So perhaps it's $6667, but the closest option isn't present. Wait, option D is 5667, which is lower. Or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is considering only the initial lending, not the entire multiplier effect. No, that doesn't make sense because the question says "the potential change in the total money supply", which implies the maximum possible, so the multiplier effect applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the reserve ratio is 15%, so the money multiplier is 1/(r) = 1/0.15 ≈ 6.666... so 1000 * 6.666 is ~6666.67. So looking at the options, the closest is D:5667? Or maybe I did the math wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the deposit multiplier. The formula is (1 + r)/(r) ? No, wait, no. The deposit multiplier is 1/r, which is what I used. Because each bank can only lend (1 - r) of its deposits, so the multiplier is 1 / r.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the multiplier. So 1/0.15 is indeed 6.666..., so the total increase is 1000 * 6.666... which is approximately 6666.67. So none of the options exactly match this. But looking at the options, E is 6000, which is lower. D is 5667, which is also lower. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the required reserve ratio is on deposits, so when the bank receives $1000, they must keep $150 in reserves. They can lend out $850. Then, when that $850 is deposited again, the next bank keeps 15% of that, which is 127.5, so they lend 722.5. So each step, the amount that can be lent is multiplied by 0.85.

The total money supply would be the initial 1000 plus all the loans. So the multiplier is 1/(1 - (lending ratio)). Wait, the lending ratio is (1 - r), which is 0.85. So the multiplier is 1/(r) = 1/0.15 ≈6.666.

So total money supply increase is 1000 * 6.666 = 6666.67. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps the intended answer is E:6000? Because 1000 *6 is 6000. Maybe the question is using a different approach, perhaps ignoring the decimal.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking of M1 versus M2, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the first round of lending, which would be $850. But that's option J:850, which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The money multiplier is (1/r), so 1/0.15 is 6.666. So the total money created is 1000 *6.666, which is 6666.67. But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but among the options, the closest is not present.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Option D is 5667. Hmm, perhaps the question uses a different formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is not 1/r but (1 + (1 - r) + (1 - r)^2 + ... ), but that still gives 1/r.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the change in the money supply, not including the initial deposit. Wait, no, the initial deposit is part of the money supply. So the total change is the initial plus the loans.

Wait, another approach: the maximum possible increase is when all possible loans are made. So initial deposit is $1000. The bank lends $850, which when deposited, allows another $722.5 to be lent, and so on.

So the total increase is 1000 + 850 + 722.5 + ... which is a geometric series with a =1000 and ratio 0.85. The sum is a/(1 - r) = 1000/(1 - 0.85) = 1000/0.15≈6666.67.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different reserve calculation. Wait, perhaps the required reserve is 15% on all deposits, including the initial. So the initial $1000: the bank must hold 15% reserve, so $150, and can lend $850. Then, the $850 deposited elsewhere leads to another 15% reserve, so 127.5 held, 722.5 lent. So each step is 85% of the prior. So the total is 1000 + 850 + 722.5 + ... = 1000*(1/(1-0.85))= 6666.67.

So the answer should be approximately $6,666.67. Looking at the options, the closest is E:6000, which is 6,000. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different ratio.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, money multiplier is 1/r, which is 1/0.15=6.666. So 1000 *6.666=6,666.67. So none of the options match exactly, but perhaps the intended answer is E:6000. But why?

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the first round. So the initial deposit of 1000 leads to the bank lending 850. So the total increase is 1000 +850=1850. But that's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the money supply as just the loans, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/r) -1. So 1/0.15 is ~6.666, minus 1 is 5.666, so 5666.67, which is option D:5667. Oh! That's possible. Because the initial deposit isn't counted as new money, but only the additional loans. Wait, but the initial deposit is part of the money supply. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, the question says, what is the potential change in the total money supply? So when you deposit $1000, the total money supply increases by that amount. Then, as the banks lend, the money supply increases further. So the total change is the initial plus all the subsequent loans. So 1000 + 850 + 722.5 etc. which is 6666.67.

But if the formula used is (1/r) -1, then 6.666 -1=5.666, so 5.666 *1000=5666.67, which is option D. So maybe the question is considering the increase excluding the initial deposit. That is, the change is the amount of new money created by banks, not counting the initial deposit.

Wait, but usually, the money multiplier includes the initial deposit. Because when you deposit $1000, it's part of M1. Then the banks create more money through lending. So the total money supply is the initial plus the credit created. So the total change would be the 6666.67.

But why is option D 5667? That would be if they subtract the initial deposit. So 6666.67 -1000 =5666.67. So perhaps the question is considering the change as the money created by the banks beyond the initial deposit. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A:3,333
B:1,500
C:4,000
D:5,667
E:6,000
F:7,000
G:150
H:1000
I:2,500
J:850

So option D is 5,667. That's approximately 5.666*1000, which would be 1/0.15 -1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is thinking in terms of the money base. Oh wait, the money base is the sum of currency in circulation and bank reserves. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reserve ratio is applied differently. Wait, perhaps the initial $1000 is in currency, so when deposited, the bank's reserves increase by $1000, but they have to keep 15% of their deposits as reserves. So the required reserves would be 0.15 * (total deposits). Wait, but initially, the bank's deposits increase by $1000, so required reserves increase by 0.15*1000=150. So excess reserves are 850, which can be lent out.

So the initial excess reserves are 850. The money multiplier is 1/r, so 1/0.15=6.666. So the total increase is 850 *6.666= 850*(20/3)= (850*20)/3=17,000/3≈5666.67, which is option D.

Oh, that's it! So the initial deposit of $1000 adds to the bank's reserves. The bank now has excess reserves of $850 (because 15% of $1000 is $150 in required reserves, so 1000-150=850 excess). The money multiplier applies to the excess reserves, not the total deposit. So the total increase in money supply is the excess times (1/r). So 850*(1/0.15)=850*6.666≈5666.67, which is option D.

So the correct answer is D: $5,667.

To determine the potential change in the total money supply when $1,000 is deposited in a commercial bank with a required reserve ratio (\(r\)) of 15%, we need to account for the money multiplier effect. Here's the analysis:

1. **Initial Deposit and Reserves**:  
   When $1,000 is deposited, the bank must hold 15% of this amount (\(0.15 \times 1000 = 150\)) as required reserves. The remaining $850 is excess reserves, which the bank can lend out.

2. **Money Multiplier**:  
   The money multiplier formula is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{0.15} \approx 6.666...
   \]  
   This multiplier applies to the excess reserves, as they drive the lending process.

3. **Total Increase in Money Supply**:  
   The total increase in money supply is calculated by multiplying the excess reserves ($850) by the money multiplier:  
   \[
   \text{Total Increase} = 850 \times 6.666... \approx 5666.67
   \]  

4. **Closest Option**:  
   Among the given options, the closest value to $5,666.67 is **$5,667**, which corresponds to option D.

Thus, the potential change in the total money supply resulting from this transaction is **$5,667**.
