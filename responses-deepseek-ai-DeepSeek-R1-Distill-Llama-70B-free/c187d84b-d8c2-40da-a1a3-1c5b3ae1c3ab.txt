Okay, so I've got this question about plate tectonics and the types of stress at different boundaries. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which type of stress dominates at divergent boundaries. The options are A through J, with E being Tensional and J being Compressional, among others. I remember that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into plates that move relative to each other, and these movements create different types of boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform.

Divergent boundaries are where two plates are moving apart from each other. I think that when plates diverge, they create new crust as magma rises up to fill the gap. Like the mid-Atlantic ridge, right? So when the plates are moving apart, the forces acting on them... oh yeah, stress. Stress in the Earth's crust can be tensional, compressional, or shear.

Wait, tensional stress is when forces are pulling apart, right? So if the plates are moving away, the rocks are being stretched. That would mean the dominant stress is tensional. So at a divergent boundary, the plates are being pulled apart, leading to tension. That makes sense because tensional stress would cause the crust to thin and eventually break, allowing magma to come up.

On the other hand, convergent boundaries are where plates are colliding. That would cause compressional stress, like when two cars smash into each other. So J, compressional, isn't the answer here.

Transform boundaries, like the San Andreas fault, are where plates slide past each other horizontally. That's shear stress, which would be either right-lateral or left-lateral shear. So options C and I are for transform boundaries, not divergent.

So putting it all together, the dominant stress at divergent boundaries is tensional, which is option E.

At divergent boundaries, two tectonic plates move apart from each other, resulting in the formation of new crust as magma rises to fill the gap. This process subjects the lithosphere to tensional stress, as the rocks are being stretched and pulled apart. Tensional stress is characteristic of divergent boundaries, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the plates' separation leads to crustal thinning and eventual rifting.

In contrast, compressional stress dominates at convergent boundaries, where plates collide and push against each other. Shear stress is associated with transform boundaries, where plates slide past one another horizontally. Therefore, the correct answer is tensional stress.
