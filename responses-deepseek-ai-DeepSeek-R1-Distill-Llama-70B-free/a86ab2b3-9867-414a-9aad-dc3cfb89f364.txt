The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An owner of a large, three-story office building planned to renovate the building and requested several contractors to submit bids to perform the work. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, "I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. "Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs. The contractor then performed the renovation work, but the owner has not yet paid him anything. In an action by the contractor against the owner for the services rendered, the contractor will probably be able to recover

Options:

A: $75,000 only, due to the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.
B: $85,000, to cover the additional cost and the inconvenience caused by the first electrician's withdrawal.
C: only in quantum meruit, because the contractor performed the renovation work despite the disagreement over costs.
D: $75,000 only, because the contractor failed to secure the electrician's commitment.
E: $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.
F: $80,000, because the owner should bear the cost of unexpected expenses.
G: $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.
H: $80,000, because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began.
I: only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrifle of commercial frustration.
J: only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there's an owner who wants to renovate a three-story office building. He asks several contractors to submit bids. One contractor, let's call him Contractor A, then seeks bids from subcontractors to determine the total cost. An electrician submits a bid to Contractor A, which Contractor A uses to compute his own bid to the owner. Contractor A notifies the electrician that he's using his bid. Two weeks later, Contractor A submits a bid of $75,000 to the owner, and the owner accepts the next day with a signed letter.

But then, the electrician tells Contractor A that he can't do the job. So, Contractor A has to hire another electrician, which costs $5,000 more than the original bid. Contractor A tells the owner about this and says the total cost will now be $80,000. The owner says she'll hold him to the original $75,000 and won't pay extra. Contractor A does the work but hasn't been paid yet. Now, he's suing the owner for the services rendered. The question is how much he can recover.

Hmm. So the issue here is about contract law, specifically the enforceability of the contract between Contractor A and the owner, and whether the owner can hold Contractor A to the original price despite the subcontractor issue.

I remember that when a contractor uses a subcontractor's bid in their own bid, it might create a situation where the subcontractor's bid is an offer that the contractor can accept. But in this case, the contractor didn't accept the electrician's bid yet, right? Because he just used it to compute his own bid. So the electrician's bid was just a quote, not a binding contract.

Wait, so the electrician submitted a bid, which is an offer. Contractor A used it in his bid but didn't formally accept it yet. So when the electrician later withdrew, Contractor A had to find another subcontractor. But since he didn't have a contract with the first electrician, he couldn't force him to perform. So he had to pay more.

But the main contract is between Contractor A and the owner. The owner accepted Contractor A's offer of $75,000. So the contract is for $75,000. Now, the question is whether the owner can enforce that contract, or if Contractor A can demand more due to the subcontractor's withdrawal.

I think about the concept of privity of contract. The owner's contract is with Contractor A, not with the electrician. So any issues with the subcontractor don't directly affect the main contract. Unless the subcontractor's withdrawal is a material breach that affects the main contract, but I don't think that's the case here.

Another point is whether the contractor was at fault for not securing the subcontractor's commitment. If he relied on the electrician's bid but didn't get a firm commitment, that's his problem, not the owner's. So the owner shouldn't be penalized for that.

So when the owner accepted the $75,000 offer, that's the contract price. The contractor is bound by that. The fact that the subcontractor's cost increased doesn't change the main contract unless there's a provision in the contract allowing for such changes, which we don't have here.

Looking at the options:

A: 75k only, because owner wasn't involved in the subcontractor's bid. That makes sense because the owner's contract is with the contractor, not the subcontractor.

D: 75k only because contractor didn't secure the commitment. Also makes sense. It's the contractor's responsibility to manage subcontractors.

E: 75k only, because that's the contract price. Also correct.

Other options talk about quantum meruit, which is about recovering the value of services when there's no enforceable contract. But here, there is a contract, so quantum meruit wouldn't apply unless the contract is unenforceable, which it's not.

Options B and F talk about $80k or $85k, but I don't think the owner is responsible for the increased cost unless they agreed to it, which they didn't. They said they'd hold the contractor to the original price.

So the correct answer should be either A, D, or E. Now, I need to figure out which one.

The question is why the contractor can only recover $75k. The reason could be because the owner wasn't involved in the subcontractor's bid (A), or because the contractor didn't secure the commitment (D), or because that's the contract price (E).

Option E seems the most straightforward. The contract was for $75k, so that's what the owner owes. The other reasons (A and D) are more about why the contractor can't get more, but E directly addresses the contract price.

Wait, but the contractor actually performed the work. So the owner is obligated to pay the contract price. The contractor can't demand more because of his own subcontractor issues. So the answer is E: $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.

Looking at the options, E is the choice. So I think E is the correct answer.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically whether the contractor can recover more than the original contract price of $75,000 due to increased costs caused by a subcontractor's withdrawal. The key points are:

1. **Contract Between Owner and Contractor**: The owner accepted the contractor's offer of $75,000, creating a binding contract. The owner's obligation is to pay the contract price, and any issues with subcontractors do not affect this agreement unless explicitly stated in the contract.

2. **Subcontractor's Bid**: The electrician's bid was used by the contractor to formulate his offer, but it was not a binding contract. The contractor did not secure a commitment from the electrician, and the withdrawal of the bid is the contractor's responsibility, not the owner's.

3. **No Basis for Additional Costs**: The owner is not obligated to pay the increased cost of $80,000 because the subcontractor's withdrawal does not alter the terms of the main contract. The contractor must bear the risk of subcontractor issues unless the contract specifies otherwise.

4. **Quantum Meruit**: This doctrine is irrelevant here because there is a valid contract. Quantum meruit applies when there is no enforceable contract, which is not the case.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A, D, and E** all correctly state that the contractor can only recover $75,000. However, **E** is the most precise because it directly addresses the contract price as the basis for recovery.
   - Options **B, F, G, H, I, and J** are incorrect because they either suggest recovery of more than the contract price or misapply legal doctrines like quantum meruit.

The correct answer is that the contractor can only recover $75,000 because that is the contract price agreed upon with the owner.

**Answer: E**
