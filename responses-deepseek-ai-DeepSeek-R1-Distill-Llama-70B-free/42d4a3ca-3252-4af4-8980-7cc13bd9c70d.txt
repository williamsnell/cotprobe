Okay, so I've got this biology question about chromosomes in different cells. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to remember.

The question is about an animal with a haploid number of 10. So, wait, if the haploid number is 10, that means each gamete (like sperm or egg) has 10 chromosomes. But since the animal is diploid, its body cells have 20 chromosomes, right? Because diploid is 2n, so 2 times 10 is 20.

Now, the question has four parts: a, b, c, d. Each part asks about the number of chromosomes or chromatids in different structures.

a) Aspermatogonium: Wait, what's an aspermatogonium? Oh right, I think it's a type of germ cell, like the precursor to sperm or eggs. Oh wait, no, more specifically, in males, the spermatogonia are the cells that develop into sperm. So an aspermatogonium would be a germ cell that undergoes division to form gametes. Since it's a diploid cell, before any division, it should have the full diploid number. So 20 chromosomes. But wait, what about chromatids? If the cell is in the G1 phase, it hasn't replicated yet, so each chromosome is single, no chromatids. But if it's about to undergo replication, maybe during S phase? Or when it starts dividing.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the phase, so I think the general case is that aspermatogonium is a diploid cell, so 20 chromosomes. Because aspermatogonia are the initial cells, they have the diploid number. So part a is 20 chromosomes.

Wait, but wait, the options have a) as 20 chromatids or 20 chromosomes. Hmm, but I think aspermatogonium is in the diploid state, so 20 chromosomes. So for part a, it's 20 chromosomes.

b) The first polar body. Polar bodies are formed during oogenesis. So when a primary oocyte undergoes meiosis I, it divides into a secondary oocyte and the first polar body. The first polar body is haploid, so it has 10 chromosomes. But wait, during meiosis I, each cell's chromosomes have been replicated, so each has two chromatids per chromosome.

Wait, no. The primary oocyte is diploid (20 chromosomes) and undergoes meiosis I, which reduces the number by half. So each daughter cell (secondary oocyte and first polar body) has 10 chromosomes. But each chromosome is still made of two sister chromatids because replication happened in S phase before meiosis. So the first polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. But wait, the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So the first polar body would have 10 chromosomes, but each has two chromatids. But when the question says "how many chromosomes," it's just 10. Or does it count chromatids? Wait, no, the chromosome is counted as a single unit even if it has two chromatids. So the first polar body has 10 chromosomes. Unless it's in a state after division where it's split, but I think for the first polar body, it's 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids.

Wait, but the options for part b) are either 10 chromosomes or 10 chromatids. Let me think again. Oh wait, the first polar body is formed during meiosis I. So the primary oocyte (20 chromosomes, 40 chromatids) divides into secondary oocyte and first polar body. Each of these has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids (so 20 chromatids in total per cell). But the question is whether it's asking for chromosomes or chromatids.

Looking back at the question: part b) asks for the number of chromosomes in the first polar body. So it's 10 chromosomes. So part b) is 10 chromosomes.

c) The second polar body. It's formed during meiosis II. Let's think: after meiosis I, the secondary oocyte has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. Then, during meiosis II, it divides into a mature oocyte (which is the egg) and the second polar body. Each of these would have 10 chromosomes, but wait, after division, each would have 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid because the sister chromatids are separated. Or wait, no, the secondary oocyte is in a state where it's about to undergo meiosis II. So when it divides, each daughter cell (egg and second polar body) has 10 chromosomes, each as single chromatids (so each is 10 chromatids per cell). But again, the question is about the number of chromosomes.

Wait, no, after meiosis II, each daughter cell (egg and second polar body) has 10 chromosomes, but each chromosome is a single chromatid. So the second polar body would have 10 chromosomes, but each is single. So the count is 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: each polar body after meiosis II would have 10 chromosomes, but each is single (so 10 chromatids in terms of strands, but as individual chromosomes). So when the question asks for chromosomes, it's 10. But wait, no, after meiosis II, each chromosome is single, so each is a chromatid. But in terms of counting chromosomes, each is a single structure, so 10 chromosomes. Or is it 10 chromatids because each is a single strand?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about it again. When a cell goes through meiosis II, it's splitting sister chromatids into separate cells. So in the secondary oocyte, which is in metaphase II, each chromosome has two sister chromatids. When it divides, each daughter cell (mature oocyte and second polar body) gets one of each pair. So each of these cells has 10 chromosomes, each consisting of a single chromatid. But in terms of counting, each is a chromosome. So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, but each is single (so 10 chromatids in total, but 10 chromosomes). Or does the number of chromosomes remain 10, regardless of whether they're single or double?

Wait, I think the number of chromosomes is the same as the number of chromatids when you're talking about single strands. So in the second polar body, which has 10 chromosomes, each is a single chromatid. So the number of chromosomes is 10, and the number of chromatids is also 10. But the question is part c) is asking for the number of chromosomes, right? Wait no, the question is: each part is a separate question.

Wait, looking back: the question says, for each part a to d, how many chromosomes are present, and then in the options, each part (a, b, c, d) has either a number of chromosomes or chromatids. Wait, no, the question says, "how many chromosomes are present" in each structure. So the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids, except perhaps in the options.

Wait no, the question isn't entirely clear. Let me reread the question: "how many chromosomes are present in a) aspermatogonium? b) In the first polar body? c) In the second polar body? d) In the secondary oocyte?" So the question is about chromosomes in each case.

So for a), aspermatogonium: diploid, so 20 chromosomes.

b) First polar body: formed after meiosis I, so haploid, 10 chromosomes.

c) Second polar body: formed after meiosis II, so also haploid, 10 chromosomes.

d) Secondary oocyte: after meiosis I, so it's haploid, 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but wait, the secondary oocyte is in meiosis II, so it's actually a cell with 10 chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10, each with two chromatids. So the secondary oocyte has 10 chromosomes, but 20 chromatids in total. But the question is about the number of chromosomes, so it's 10.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option B: a) 10 chromosomes, b) 10 chromatids, c) 10 chromatids, d) 10 chromosomes.

Wait, no, because a) is 10, but I thought a) is 20. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the aspermatogonium is a germ cell, which is diploid. So it's 20 chromosomes. So part a) is 20 chromosomes.

Looking back, the options:

Option C: a) 20, b)10, c)20 chromatids, d)10 chromatids.

Wait, but the question is about chromosomes, not chromatids, except in the options, the answer parts have either chromosome or chromatid counts.

Wait, perhaps I got the question wrong. Let me recheck:

The question says: how many chromosomes are present in each case.

So for each part a-d, the answer is the number of chromosomes.

So:

a) Aspermatogonium: diploid, 20 chromosomes.

b) First polar body: haploid, 10 chromosomes.

c) Second polar body: haploid, 10 chromosomes.

d) Secondary oocyte: haploid, 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but that can't be right because the secondary oocyte is in meiosis II and is about to split. So it's actually a cell with 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids.

Wait, but the secondary oocyte has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, making 20 chromatids in total. But the number of chromosomes is 10.

So in all four parts, the chromosome count is 20,10,10,10.

But looking at the options, none have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structures.

Wait, let me think again.

Aspermatogonium: these are the cells in the testes that divide to form spermatocytes. They are diploid, so 20 chromosomes.

First polar body: formed in meiosis I, so haploid, 10 chromosomes.

Second polar body: formed in meiosis II, so haploid, 10 chromosomes.

Secondary oocyte: this is the cell after meiosis I, so it's haploid, 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but the secondary oocyte is in meiosis II, so when it divides, it produces the mature oocyte and the second polar body. So the secondary oocyte is a haploid cell with 10 chromosomes, each consisting of two chromatids.

But again, the number of chromosomes is 10.

So for a) 20; b)10; c)10; d)10.

Looking at the options, let's see which option matches.

Option B: a)10, which is wrong because a) should be 20.

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20 chromatids, d)10. Wait, but the question is about chromosomes, so part c) is 10 chromosomes, but the option says 20 chromatids. So that doesn't fit.

Option G: a)20, b)10, c)20 chromatids, d)10.

Hmm, but for c), the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, not 20, so this option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part c). Let me think again.

Wait, after meiosis II, the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each being single chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10, and the number of chromatids is 10 (each chromosome is one chromatid). So if the question is about the number of chromosomes in the second polar body, it's 10.

So, looking again, the four parts would be:

a)20

b)10

c)10

d)10

But looking at the options, none have 20,10,10,10.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me reread the question.

Wait, the question says, in an animal with a haploid number of 10, how many chromosomes are present in each structure. So:

a) Aspermatogonium: diploid, so 20.

b) First polar body: haploid, 10.

c) Second polar body: haploid, 10.

d) Secondary oocyte: haploid, 10.

So the answers would be a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

Looking at the options, which option has a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

Looking through the options:

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10 chromatids.

No, part c) is 20, which is wrong.

Option G: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. No.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20. No.

Option F: a)10, so no.

Option I: a)10, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the secondary oocyte is diploid? No, the secondary oocyte is formed after meiosis I, so it's haploid.

Wait, maybe the secondary oocyte is in meiosis II, which means it's about to split, so it has 10 chromosomes, but each with two chromatids. So number of chromosomes is 10.

So looking back, perhaps the correct answer is a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the first polar body. Let me think again. The first polar body is formed during meiosis I. So the primary oocyte (20) splits into a secondary oocyte (10) and first polar body (10). So yes, 10 chromosomes.

But the secondary oocyte then undergoes meiosis II, producing a mature oocyte and second polar body. Each of these has 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but when the secondary oocyte is in meiosis II, before it splits, it has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So when it splits, each daughter cell (mature oocyte and second polar body) has 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid.

So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each single.

So in that case, the second polar body's chromosome count is 10.

So the four parts are:

a)20

b)10

c)10

d)10

Looking for this, but none of the options seem to match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the aspermatogonium. Wait, aspermatogonium is a type of germ cell in the male, which is diploid, so 20 chromosomes. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the secondary oocyte, when it splits, the second polar body is actually just a cell with 10 chromosomes, but the count is 10. So all parts except a) are 10.

But none of the options seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at option B:

a)10, b)10, c)10, d)10.

No, because a) should be 20.

Option I:

a)10, which is wrong.

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

Hmm, so part c) is 20. But I thought it's 10. So maybe I'm wrong about that.

Wait, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromosomes? No, that can't be. Because the secondary oocyte is 10, so when it splits, each daughter cell is 10.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the process. Let me think again.

Primary oocyte (20) → meiosis I → secondary oocyte (10) + first polar body (10).

Secondary oocyte (10) → meiosis II → mature oocyte (10) + second polar body (10).

So both polar bodies have 10 chromosomes each.

So the four parts are:

a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

Looking for an option that has a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

Looking through the options, none have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking at option G: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

No, part c) is 20, which is wrong.

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

Same issue.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the aspermatogonium. Wait, the aspermatogonium is a diploid cell, but maybe during certain phases, it has different counts. For example, during the S phase, it has replicated DNA, so each chromosome has two sister chromatids.

But the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So regardless of replication, the number of chromosomes remains the same.

So a) is 20.

Wait, perhaps the secondary oocyte after meiosis I is 10 chromosomes, but when it undergoes meiosis II, it becomes 10 again. So the secondary oocyte is 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids.

So the secondary oocyte has 10 chromosomes, but when considering chromatids, it's 20.

But the question is about chromosomes, so d) is 10.

Wait, maybe the question is mixing up chromosomes and chromatids in the answer options. For example, part a) might be 20 chromatids if the cell is in a certain phase.

Wait, the aspermatogonium is a diploid cell. If it's in G1 phase, each chromosome is single, so 20 chromosomes, 20 chromatids.

Wait, no, each chromosome in G1 has one chromatid. So 20 chromosomes, 20 chromatids.

But if the aspermatogonium is preparing to divide, it undergoes S phase, replicating DNA. So each chromosome would have two sister chromatids. So 20 chromosomes, 40 chromatids.

But the question doesn't specify the phase, so I think the general case is that the aspermatogonium is in G1, so 20 chromosomes, 20 chromatids.

Wait, but the options have part a) as either 20 chromatids or 20 chromosomes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: a)20 chromatids, so that would be 20 chromosomes (each with one chromatid) but 20 chromatids. Wait, that can't be right because 20 chromosomes would have 20 chromatids in G1, but if they've replicated, it's 40.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: for each part, determine the number of chromosomes and chromatids.

a) Aspermatogonium: diploid, 20 chromosomes. If it's in G1, each has 1 chromatid → 20 chrom. If in S/G2, each has 2 → 40 chrom.
