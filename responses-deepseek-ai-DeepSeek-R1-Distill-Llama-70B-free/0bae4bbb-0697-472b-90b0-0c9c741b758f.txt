Question:

A man hired a videographer to film his daughter's wedding. The written contract entered included a "payment clause," which provided that the videographer would be "paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. " The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment. Denying any additional liability, the man sent the videographer a check for $10,000. The videographer then brought suit against the man to recover the additional $5,000. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive to support the videographer's contention that when the written contract was executed, the man agreed to pay the videographer $5,000 for use of the high definition equipment in addition to the $10,000 fee?

Options:

A: The contract is open to interpretation and does not explicitly state that use of high definition equipment would be included in the $10,000 fee.
B: The use of high definition equipment is a separate service and not included in the base fee for filming and editing.
C: According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.
D: An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the "payment clause" as written.
E: The man's stipulation for high definition equipment implies agreement to additional charges associated with the use of such equipment.
F: The videographer can provide evidence of past clients who were charged separately for the use of high definition equipment.
G: Assuming arguendo that the written "payment clause" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.
H: Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms "would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document. "
I: The videographer had previously informed the man of the additional costs of using high definition equipment.
J: The videographer provided a service above and beyond the agreed upon terms, therefore justifying the additional cost.

Okay, so I have this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the situation is a man hired a videographer to film his daughter's wedding. The contract says the videographer will be paid $10,000 for filming and editing a 60-minute video. The man included a stipulation that the video must be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract doesn't mention anything else about payment. After the work was done, the videographer billed $15,000â€”$10k as per the contract and an extra $5k for using the high-def equipment. The man only paid $10k and refused the extra, so the videographer sued for the additional $5k.

The question is about which argument would best support the videographer's claim that the man agreed to pay the extra $5k for the high-def equipment on top of the $10k.

The options are A to J. Let me go through each option and see which makes the most sense.

Option A: The contract is open to interpretation and doesn't explicitly say the high-def is included. Hmm, but the payment clause is pretty specific about $10k for filming and editing. If it's not mentioned, maybe it's ambiguous. But contracts are usually construed against ambiguity, so maybe this isn't the strongest argument.

Option B: High-def is a separate service. But the contract says the video must be filmed with high-def, so it's part of the requirement. If it's a separate service, why wasn't it in the contract? Not sure.

Option C: Customary trade practice. This could be a good point. If in the industry, a $10k fee is just for filming/editing, and high-def costs extra, then maybe that's implied. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit because the contract specifically included the high-def stipulation without mentioning extra cost.

Option D: Oral agreement. If they had an oral agreement that high-def costs extra, it might be allowed under the statute of frauds if it doesn't contradict the written contract. But the written contract is about payment, so an oral agreement about additional payment might not be admissible because the payment terms are already in the written contract. So this might not work.

Option E: The man's stipulation implies agreement to additional charges. That makes sense. If the man specifically required high-def, maybe he knew it would cost more. But the contract didn't mention the extra fee. So is it implied? I'm not sure. The contract's payment clause is $10k for filming and editing, which includes high-def as per the stipulation. So maybe the payment already covers that.

Option F: Evidence of past clients charged separately. This is about trade practice again. It's similar to option C. If others charge extra, maybe that's the custom. But again, the contract here specifically included high-def without mentioning extra, so it's unclear.

Option G: Equitable considerations and extrinsic evidence. If the contract isn't ambiguous, extrinsic evidence isn't allowed. But if it's ambiguous, then extrinsic evidence can be used. The argument here is that without the extra $5k, the videographer loses money, so equity requires considering extrinsic evidence. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument.

Option H: Under UCC, extrinsic evidence is admissible unless it contradicts the written terms. Wait, this is a service contract, so maybe common law applies instead of UCC. But assuming it's UCC, if the written contract is fully integrated and not ambiguous, extrinsic evidence isn't allowed. So this might not help.

Option I: Videographer informed man about extra costs. If this is true, it could show that the man knew about the additional charge. But the contract didn't include it, so maybe it's a separate agreement. If they didn't include it in writing, the man might argue he didn't agree to it.

Option J: Videographer did extra work. But the contract required high-def, so it's not extra. The videographer was obliged to use it, so can't charge extra unless agreed.

Wait, let me think again. The key is whether the $10k includes the high-def or not. The contract says the man stipulated high-def, but didn't mention extra payment. So the question is, did they agree that high-def would cost extra?

Option E says that the man's stipulation implies agreement to additional charges. But does that make sense? If the contract says the man required high-def, but the payment clause is only for filming and editing, maybe the payment includes all necessary expenses, including equipment. So the high-def is part of the $10k.

Alternatively, if the man specifically asked for high-def, knowing it costs more, maybe the $10k was just the base, and high-def is an add-on. But the contract doesn't say that.

So which argument supports that the man agreed to pay extra? Looking back, option E says the stipulation implies agreement to additional charges. Maybe that's the point. If the man insisted on high-def, he must have known it costs more, so the $10k was just for the service, and high-def is an extra.

But wait, the payment clause is for filming and editing, which would include the equipment used. So if high-def is part of filming, then it's included in the $10k. So the extra charge might not be justified unless it was agreed upon.

Another angle: the contract was for $10k to film and edit, and high-def was a requirement. So the payment includes all costs related to filming with high-def. So the videographer can't charge extra unless it was a separate agreement.

So the videographer's argument would need to show that the high-def was an additional service beyond the $10k. How?

Option E suggests that by stipulating high-def, the man agreed to the additional cost. But that's not necessarily true unless it's customary or there was an agreement.

Option I says the videographer told the man about the extra cost. If that's the case, and the man agreed, then the contract's payment clause might be seen as partial, with the rest being oral. But the written contract seems to be the entire agreement on payment.

Option D says an oral agreement would supplement the written. But under the parol evidence rule, if the written contract is fully integrated, prior or contemporaneous agreements can't contradict it. So if the written contract says $10k for filming and editing, an oral agreement to pay extra might not be allowed because it's adding to the payment terms.

So maybe the best argument is E: the stipulation implies agreement to the cost. Or perhaps C, about trade practice.

Wait, if the industry custom is that high-def is an extra charge beyond the base fee, then that could imply that the $10k doesn't include it. So the man would have known that.

So option C says that in the industry, $10k is for filming and editing, and high-def is extra. So that's a customary charge. So the contract's $10k doesn't include the high-def fee, which is a separate $5k.

That sounds plausible. Because if it's customary, the parties would have been aware, so the contract's silence on the high-def fee implies it's extra.

Alternatively, option E suggests that the man's stipulation implies agreement to pay extra. But without prior knowledge, maybe not. So perhaps option C is better because it's about industry standards.

Wait, but the contract specifically required high-def. So if the standard is that high-def is included, then no extra charge. But if the standard is that high-def is extra, then the $10k doesn't include it.

So the argument in C would support the videographer's claim.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The written contract says $10k for filming and editing a 60-minute video, and the man stipulated high-def. So the payment is for the service, which includes using high-def equipment. So the $10k includes all costs, including equipment.

But the videographer is charging extra for the equipment. So the argument is that the $10k was just for labor, and equipment is a separate cost.

Is that a reasonable interpretation? Or is equipment considered part of the service?

Hmm. I think in service contracts, unless specified otherwise, the cost of materials or equipment is included in the fee. So if the videographer used high-def, which costs more, but the contract stipulates that, then the fee should cover it.

So the videographer can't charge extra unless it was agreed upon. So to get the extra $5k, they need to show that it was agreed as an additional charge.

So which option supports that? Option E says the man's stipulation implies agreement to additional charges. Or option I, where the videographer informed the man about the cost.

Option I seems like it could be a good argument, but it's about whether there was an agreement. If the videographer can prove they told the man about the extra cost, and the man agreed, that would support the claim. But the contract doesn't mention it, so it's about whether there was an oral agreement.

However, the parol evidence rule would usually exclude that if the written contract is fully integrated. So unless the written contract is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence isn't allowed.

Wait, the question is about which argument would be most persuasive. So the options are about possible arguments, not necessarily whether they would win.

Looking again, option E says the man's stipulation implies agreement to additional charges. That might be based on the idea that if the man required high-def, he must have known it costs more. But that's not necessarily true unless it's customary or they discussed it.

Option C is about trade practice, which if proven, would imply that the $10k doesn't include high-def costs. So that's a strong argument.

Alternatively, option I is about prior notice, which could support the claim if the man was informed.

But without more, I think option E is a possible argument, but perhaps not the strongest. Option C is about industry standards, which can be a solid argument.

Wait, the question is about which argument supports that the man agreed to pay the extra $5k when the contract was executed.

So the best argument would be that the contract's stipulation about high-def implies that the man agreed to the extra cost. So option E.

Alternatively, if the industry practice is that high-def is an extra charge, then option C.

I'm a bit torn between C and E.

But I think the strongest argument would be option E: the man's stipulation implies agreement to the additional charge. Because the man specifically required high-def, so he must have understood that it would cost more, even if it wasn't stated in the contract. It's about implication by conduct.

Alternatively, in contract interpretation, when a party stipulates a specific requirement, any additional costs for that requirement are borne by them. So the man's requirement implies agreement to pay for the high-def.

So I think E is the better answer.

To determine the most persuasive argument supporting the videographer's claim that the man agreed to pay an additional $5,000 for the use of high-definition equipment, the analysis focuses on the contract's terms, the stipulation for high-definition equipment, and the payment clause. The contract specifies $10,000 for filming and editing but does not explicitly mention whether the high-definition equipment is included in this fee. The videographer argues that the high-definition equipment justified an extra $5,000 charge.

### Key Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: The contract's ambiguity could be argued, but the payment clause is specific about $10,000 for filming and editing, which likely includes equipment costs. This is not the strongest argument.
- **Option B**: Treating high-definition equipment as a separate service is weak because the contract stipulates its use, implying it is part of the agreed-upon services.
- **Option C**: Industry customs could support the claim if it is proven that high-definition equipment costs are typically charged separately. This is a strong argument but depends on evidence of trade practices.
- **Option D**: An oral agreement to pay extra might not be admissible under the parol evidence rule if the written contract is fully integrated and unambiguous.
- **Option E**: The man's stipulation for high-definition equipment implies agreement to additional charges. This is persuasive because the man specifically required high-definition, which likely involves extra costs. It suggests mutual understanding that the equipment would incur additional fees.
- **Option F**: Evidence of past clients being charged separately is similar to Option C but focuses on the videographer's specific practices, which may not align with industry norms.
- **Option G**: Equitable considerations are less relevant here, as the contract's terms do not clearly indicate ambiguity or unfairness.
- **Option H**: Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence is admissible only if the written contract is not fully integrated or is ambiguous, which is not clearly the case here.
- **Option I**: If the videographer informed the man about the extra costs, this could support the claim, but the written contract does not reflect this agreement.
- **Option J**: The high-definition requirement was part of the contract, so it cannot be considered an "extra" service justifying additional charges.

### Conclusion:
The most persuasive argument is **Option E**, as the man's stipulation for high-definition equipment implies agreement to the associated costs. This reasoning aligns with the principle that a party requiring specific terms should bear the costs of those terms, even if not explicitly stated in the contract.
