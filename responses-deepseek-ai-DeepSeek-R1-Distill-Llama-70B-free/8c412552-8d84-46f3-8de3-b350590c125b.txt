Question:

The parathyroid glands in man are small, pealike organs. They are ususally four in number and are located on the surface of the thyroid. What is the function of these glands?

Options:

A: The parathyroid glands produce insulin to regulate blood sugar levels
B: The parathyroid glands regulate blood pressure
C: The parathyroid glands control breathing rate
D: The parathyroid glands secrete enzymes that break down proteins
E: The parathyroid glands control the balance of electrolytes in the body
F: The parathyroid glands secrete hormones that stimulate red blood cell production
G: The parathyroid glands are responsible for filtering waste from the blood
H: The parathyroid glands regulate the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues
I: The parathyroid glands regulate body temperature
J: The parathyroid glands aid in digestion

Okay, so I've got this question about the parathyroid glands. Hmm, I remember they're related to the thyroid somehow. Oh right, they're located on the surface of the thyroid gland, right? But wait, what do they actually do?

I think the thyroid itself is involved in metabolism, producing hormones like thyroxine. But the parathyroid glands must have a different function. I'm trying to recall from my biology classes. Oh yeah, I think they have something to do with calcium levels in the blood. 

So the options are A to J. Let's go through them. Option A says they produce insulin. No, insulin is from the pancreas, so A is wrong. B is about blood pressure—that might be the kidneys or maybe the adrenal glands with adrenaline. Not sure, but not the parathyroid. 

C is controlling breathing rate. That's more like the brainstem or maybe the lungs detecting CO2 levels. D says they secrete enzymes to break down proteins. That sounds like the digestive enzymes from the pancreas or stomach, not parathyroid. 

E says they control electrolyte balance. Wait, electrolytes include calcium, so maybe. But I thought their main role was calcium specifically. Option F talks about red blood cell production—that's the bone marrow, maybe with help from the kidneys producing erythropoietin. 

G is filtering waste, which is the kidneys' job. H says they regulate calcium-phosphate balance between blood and tissues. That rings a bell. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) helps regulate calcium levels. When calcium is low, PTH is released, which acts on bones and kidneys to increase calcium in the blood. So H seems correct.

I is body temperature regulation, which is the hypothalamus. J is digestion aid, which is the digestive organs like the stomach or pancreas. 

So putting it together, the correct answer should be H: regulate the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues.

The parathyroid glands are small, pea-like organs located on the surface of the thyroid gland. Their primary function is to regulate the balance of calcium and phosphate in the body. They achieve this by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps maintain calcium levels in the blood by acting on the bones, kidneys, and intestines. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

H: The parathyroid glands regulate the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues.

Answer: H
