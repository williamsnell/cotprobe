Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the colony of Pennsylvania based on the given text. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking which option best describes Pennsylvania. The text provided is from William Penn's Charter of Privileges, dated 1701. I remember that William Penn was a key figure in the establishment of Pennsylvania, and that it was related to religious freedom, especially for Quakers.

Looking at the options:

A: An independent colony governed outside the authority of the King
B: A colony where governance was shared equally among all inhabitants
C: A self-governing colony with no ties to a monarch
D: A charter colony in which the King granted a charter to a group of businessmen or colonists
E: A colony governed by a religious leader
F: A proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family
G: A royal colony in which the King appointed the governor
H: A colony where governance was entrusted to a group of religious leaders
I: A colony governed by a council elected by the King
J: A colony in which the King granted a charter to a single businessman

I need to determine the correct classification of Pennsylvania. From what I recall, Pennsylvania was a proprietary colony. Proprietary colonies were granted by the British monarch to a individual or family, who then had control over the colony's governance. William Penn received the land from King Charles II as a repayment of a debt owed to his father, making Penn the proprietor.

So, looking at the options, F says "A proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family." That fits because Penn was the proprietor, and his family would have rights after him.

Option D mentions a charter colony, which is a bit confusing. Charter colonies were those where the King granted a charter to a group, like the Massachusetts Bay Colony. But Pennsylvania was under the proprietorship model, not a charter to a group of businessmen. So D might not be correct.

Option J suggests a single businessman, which could fit, but proprietary colonies are more about the proprietor and their heirs, not just any businessman. So F seems more accurate.

Other options like A, C, G don't fit because Pennsylvania was under the King's authority, even if through Penn. E and H are about religious leaders governing, which isn't the case here. B and I are about different governance structures that don't match the proprietary model.

So the best answer should be F.

The colony of Pennsylvania was established as a proprietary colony, where the British monarch entrusted governance to William Penn and his family. This arrangement allowed Penn significant control over the colony's affairs, as granted by King Charles II. The provided text from the Charter of Privileges reflects Penn's authority and the religious freedom he promoted. Therefore, the correct classification is a proprietary colony under the proprietor and his family.

Answer: F
