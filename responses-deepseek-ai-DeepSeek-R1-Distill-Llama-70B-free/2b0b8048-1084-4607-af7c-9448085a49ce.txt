Okay, so I've got this question about primary colors of light, and I need to figure out which color isn't one of them. The options are A: red, B: green, C: blue, and D: yellow. Hmm, I remember that primary colors are the basic ones that can't be made by mixing others. Wait, but wait—there are two different sets of primary colors, right? One for paints and one for light. I think when you're talking about pigments, like paints or colored pencils, the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. Those are the ones I learned in art class. But when it comes to light, it's different. I believe the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. Oh right, because when you mix light, like in a TV or a computer screen, those are the ones they use. So the primary colors for light are RGB—red, green, blue. 

So the question is asking which color isn't a primary color of light. Looking at the options, D is yellow. Since the primary light colors are red, green, and blue, yellow isn't one of them. Wait, but wait again—could I be mixing things up? I should double-check. When light is mixed, like in additive color mixing, the primaries are indeed red, green, and blue. If you mix red and green light, you get yellow. So yellow isn't a primary color for light; it's a secondary color created by mixing. So the answer must be D: yellow. 

I think that's right. So the correct answer is D.

The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. Yellow is not a primary color of light but is instead a secondary color created by mixing red and green light.
