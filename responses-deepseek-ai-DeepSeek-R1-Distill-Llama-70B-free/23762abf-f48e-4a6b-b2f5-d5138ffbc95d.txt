Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that Kim rode her bicycle 135 miles in 9 weeks, and she rode the same distance each week. Eric rode his bicycle 102 miles in 6 weeks, also riding the same distance each week. The question is asking which statement correctly compares the number of miles per week they rode. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I think I need to find out how many miles each of them rode per week and then compare those two numbers. Let me break it down.

Starting with Kim: she rode 135 miles over 9 weeks. So to find the miles per week, I should divide the total miles by the number of weeks. That means 135 divided by 9. Let me do that calculation. 135 รท 9... 9 times 15 is 135, right? So that means Kim rode 15 miles each week.

Now, Eric's part: he rode 102 miles in 6 weeks. Again, same approach here. I need to divide 102 by 6 to get the weekly miles. Let me calculate that. 6 times 17 is 102, so Eric rode 17 miles per week.

Wait, wait a second. Did I get that right? Let me double-check. 6 weeks, 102 miles. 102 divided by 6 is indeed 17. Yep, that's correct.

So now I have both their weekly miles: Kim at 15 and Eric at 17. The question is asking how these compare. So I need to find the difference between Eric's and Kim's miles per week.

Subtracting Kim's from Eric's: 17 minus 15 equals 2. So Eric rides 2 more miles per week than Kim. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one states that. Let me scan through them.

Option A: Eric rode 7 more miles per week than Kim. No, that's too high. Option E says 17 more, which is way off. Option J says Eric rode 2 more. Oh, that's exactly what I got. So option J is the correct choice.

Let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Kim's 135/9 is 15, Eric's 102/6 is 17. 17-15=2. Yep, so Eric rode 2 more miles each week than Kim. So the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Calculate Kim's weekly miles: 135 miles รท 9 weeks = 15 miles per week.
2. Calculate Eric's weekly miles: 102 miles รท 6 weeks = 17 miles per week.
3. Compare the two: 17 (Eric) - 15 (Kim) = 2 miles more per week for Eric.

Answer: J
