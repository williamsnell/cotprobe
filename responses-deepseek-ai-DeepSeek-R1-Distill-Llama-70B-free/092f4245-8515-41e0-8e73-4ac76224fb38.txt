Question:

In order to hire the least-cost combination of labor and capital, the firm must do which of the following?

Options:

A: Find the combination of labor and capital where the total cost of labor is equal to the total cost of capital.
B: Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital.
C: Find the combination of labor and capital where the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the price of labor is equal to one.
D: Find the combination of labor and capital where the price of labor is equal to the price of capital.
E: Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of capital is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of labor.
F: Find the combination of labor and capital where the price of labor is less than the price of capital.
G: Find the combination of labor and capital where the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the marginal product of capital is equal to one.
H: Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor is equal to the price of labor.
I: Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor is greater than the marginal product of capital.
J: Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital.

Okay, so I have this economics question here about firms hiring the least-cost combination of labor and capital. Hmm, I remember from my studies that firms want to minimize their costs while maximizing production. So the question is asking which condition the firm must meet to achieve this.

I think it's related to how they allocate their resources between labor and capital. There's this concept about marginal products and factor prices. Oh right, the idea is that the firm should keep hiring inputs until the marginal product per dollar spent is equal for both inputs. That way, they're getting the most bang for their buck from each input.

Wait, so the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor should equal the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital. That makes sense because if one input is giving more marginal product per dollar, the firm should switch to using more of that until the ratios balance out. This balance point would be the least-cost combination.

Let me look at the options. Option J says exactly that: the ratio of marginal product of labor to its price equals the same ratio for capital. So J is looking good.

What about the other options? Option B says the marginal products are equal, but that doesn't account for the prices. So if labor is cheaper, you might want more of it even if the MP isn't higher. Option E has the ratios flippedâ€”labor's MP over capital's price, which doesn't seem right. Option C is only considering the ratio for labor equal to one, which doesn't involve capital. Option D is about prices being equal, which isn't necessarily efficient.

So I think the correct answer is J.

To determine the least-cost combination of labor and capital, the firm must ensure that the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the price of labor is equal to the ratio of the marginal product of capital to the price of capital. This condition ensures that the firm is allocating its resources efficiently, maximizing productivity per dollar spent on each input. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option J** correctly states this condition, making it the correct choice.
- Other options either neglect the price of inputs (e.g., B, G), misrepresent the ratios (e.g., E), or focus on irrelevant conditions (e.g., A, D, F, H, I, C).

Thus, the correct answer is:

J
