Okay, so I've got this problem about a hot-air balloon design. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is about finding the volume of air at 100°C that the balloon should use to have a gross lifting power of 200 kg. Oh right, the gross lifting power is the difference between the mass of displaced air and the mass of the hot air. So I need to calculate the volume of hot air such that when it's heated, the balloon can lift 200 kg.

Alright, let's get into the details. The ambient conditions are 25°C and 1 atm. The molecular weights are given as 29 g/mol for air and 32 g/mol for the hot air (which has some CO₂, making it heavier). So the hot air is denser than the surrounding air when both are at the same temperature?

Wait, wait. No, wait. Hot air is less dense because when you heat air, it expands and becomes less dense. But in this case, the molecular weight changes because of CO₂. Oh right, CO₂ is heavier than the average air molecules, so the hot air here has a higher molecular weight, making it denser. But wait, when it's heated, does that affect the density? Because even though it's hotter, if the molecular weight is higher, the density might be lower or higher than the surrounding air?

Wait, the key point is the buoyant force. The lifting power comes from the difference in mass between the displaced air and the hot air itself. So the displaced air is at ambient temperature (25°C), and the balloon's air is at 100°C.

I think I should use the ideal gas law here. Because that's the usual approach for these kinds of problems. So PV = nRT, right? But I need to relate the masses of the displaced air and the hot air.

Wait, the formula for buoyancy: the lifting force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid (air, in this case). So the mass of the displaced air minus the mass of the hot air gives the lifting power. Since the balloon is filled with hot air, which is less dense, it displaces a volume of ambient air whose mass is higher than the mass of the hot air inside.

Wait no, that's not right. The displaced air is the ambient air, which is cooler and denser. So the mass of the displaced air is higher than the mass of the hot air inside the balloon. So the difference (mass displaced - mass of hot air) gives the lifting power, which is 200 kg.

Wait, wait, the problem says the gross lifting power is 200 kg. So it's (mass of displaced air) - (mass of hot air) = 200 kg. So I need to find the volume V such that when the balloon is filled with hot air at 100°C, the difference in mass is 200 kg.

So let me think about the steps:

1. Find the mass of the displaced air (ambient conditions).
2. Find the mass of the hot air (inside the balloon).
3. The difference should be 200 kg.
4. Then solve for the volume V.

But both the displaced air and the hot air occupy the same volume V, right? Because the balloon displaces a volume V of ambient air, and contains volume V of hot air.

So for the displaced air:
- Temperature T1 = 25°C = 298 K.
- Pressure P1 = 1 atm.
- Molecular weight M1 = 29 g/mol.

Mass m1 = (P1 * V) / (R * T1) * M1. Wait, wait, because from PV = nRT, n = PV/(RT). So mass m = n * M. So m = (P V M) / (R T).

Similarly, for the hot air inside:
- Temperature T2 = 100°C = 373 K.
- Pressure P2 = 1 atm (I assume, since the balloon is open to ambient pressure).
- Molecular weight M2 = 32 g/mol.

Mass m2 = (P2 V M2) / (R T2).

So the lifting power is m1 - m2 = 200 kg.

But wait, I have to make sure the units are correct. Let's see. The problem gives the answer options in liters, so probably I should use R in terms of liters.

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Also, the masses are in kg, so I need to convert grams to kg. Because the molecular weights are given in g/mol, so when I calculate m1 and m2, they would be in grams, so I'll have to divide by 1000 to get kg.

So let me write the equations:

m1 = (P V M1) / (R T1) * (1 / 1000) [kg]
m2 = (P V M2) / (R T2) * (1 / 1000) [kg]

And m1 - m2 = 200 kg.

Since P is 1 atm for both, it cancels out.

So let's set up the equation:

(P V M1) / (R T1) * (1/1000)  -  (P V M2) / (R T2) * (1/1000) ) = 200

We can factor out (P V)/(R * 1000) )

So:

( (M1 / T1) - (M2 / T2) ) * (P V) / (R * 1000) ) = 200

Wait, let me set it up correctly. Let me write the equation:

(m1 - m2) = [ (P V M1)/(R T1) - (P V M2)/(R T2) ] / 1000 = 200

Hmm, let's compute the terms step by step.

Compute (M1 / T1) and (M2 / T2):

M1 = 29 g/mol, T1 = 298 K → 29 / 298 ≈ 0.0973 g/(mol·K)
M2 = 32 g/mol, T2 = 373 K → 32 / 373 ≈ 0.0858 g/(mol·K)

Now, the numerator in the brackets is P V (M1/T1 - M2/T2) / R.

Wait wait, actually, the equation after factoring is:

[ (M1/T1 - M2/T2) ) * P V ] / (R) ) * (1/1000) = 200 kg

Wait, because:

(m1 - m2) = [ (P V M1)/(R T1) - (P V M2)/(R T2) ] / 1000 = 200

So factoring P V/(R) * (1/1000) [ (M1/T1 - M2/T2) ] = 200

So (P V (M1/T1 - M2/T2) ) / (R * 1000) ) = 200

Solving for V:

V = (200 * R * 1000) / (P (M1/T1 - M2/T2) )

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Compute M1/T1 - M2/T2:

M1/T1 = 29 / 298 ≈ 0.09731 g/(mol·K)
M2/T2 =32 /373 ≈0.08579 g/(mol·K)
Difference: 0.09731 - 0.08579 = 0.01152 g/(mol·K)

So denominator is P*(0.01152 g/(mol·K))

P is 1 atm.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

So,

V = (200 kg * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 1000 g/kg) / (1 atm * 0.01152 g/(mol·K)) )

Wait, let me clarify the units here.

Wait, 200 kg is the same as 200,000 grams. Because 1 kg is 1000 g. So 200 kg = 2e5 g.

So, 200 kg = 2e5 g.

So let me recompute:

V = (2e5 g * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) ) / (1 atm * 0.01152 g/(mol·K) )

Wait, because the 1000 in the denominator was from kg to grams. Wait, no, let's check the earlier steps.

Wait, no, the 1000 comes from the conversion of grams to kg. Because m1 and m2 were calculated in grams, then divided by 1000 to get kg. So in the equation, the 1/1000 is part of it.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation without the kg conversion first.

Wait, let's go back.

The equation:

(m1 - m2) = [ (P V M1)/(R T1) - (P V M2)/(R T2) ] * (1/1000) = 200 kg

So, rearranged, that's:

( P V (M1/(R T1) - M2/(R T2) ) ) * (1/1000) ) = 200

So,

V = (200 * 1000 * R ) / ( P [ (M1/T1) - (M2/T2) ] )

Wait no, solving for V:

V = (200 * 1000 * R) / ( P ( M1/T1 - M2/T2 ) )

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write it again.

(m1 - m2) = [ (P V M1)/(R T1) - (P V M2)/(R T2) ) ] / 1000 = 200

Multiply both sides by 1000:

( P V (M1/(R T1) - M2/(R T2) )) ) = 200 * 1000

So,

V = (200 * 1000 * R) / ( P ( M1/T1 - M2/T2 ) )

Wait, that's better.

So plug in the numbers:

R =0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
P=1 atm
M1/T1 =29/298 ≈0.09731
M2/T2=32/373≈0.08579
Difference:0.01152

So,

V=(200e3 g * 0.0821) / (1 * 0.01152 )

Wait wait, no. Wait, the 200 is kg, so 200,000 grams.

Wait wait, no. The equation after rearrangement is:

V = (200 * 1000 * R) / ( P (M1/T1 - M2/T2) )

Yes.

So 200 kg is 200,000 grams. So 200 *1000 = 2e5.

So,

V = (2e5 * 0.0821) / (0.01152 )

Let me compute numerator: 2e5 *0.0821 = 2e5 * 0.0821 = 16420.

Denominator: 0.01152.

So V ≈ 16420 / 0.01152 ≈ let's calculate that.

16420 / 0.01152 = ?

Let me compute 16420 ÷ 0.01152.

Hmm, maybe 16420 ÷ 0.01152 = 16420 * (1/0.01152) ≈ 16420 *86.8 (since 1/0.01152 ≈86.8).

Wait, 0.01152 is approximately 1/86.8, because 86.8 *0.01152≈1.

So 16420 *86.8 ≈.

Let me calculate 16420 *80=1,313,600.

16420 *6.8= approx 16420 *6=98,520; 16420*0.8=13,136 → total 111,656.

So total is approx 1,313,600 +111,656=1,425,256 liters.

Wait, that's about 1.425e6 liters. Looking at the options, option J is 2.13e6, D is 2.84e6, A is 3.56e6. Wait, no, none of the options are exactly 1.425e6. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:3.56e6

B:1.42e6

C:0.71e6

D:2.84e6

E:0.85e6

F:1.13e6

G:4.27e6

H:0.56e6

I:5.68e6

J:2.13e6

Wait, option B is 1.42e6, which is close to 1.425e6. So maybe that's the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Let me recompute the denominator and numerator accurately.

Compute M1/T1 =29/298 = let's compute 29 ÷298.

298 ÷29 is about 10.2759, so 29/298 = 1/10.2759≈0.09736.

M2/T2=32/373. 373 ÷32 is about 11.656, so 32/373≈0.0858.

Difference is 0.09736-0.0858=0.01156.

So 0.01156 g/(mol·K).

So V=(200,000 g *0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) ) / (1 atm *0.01156 g/(mol·K) )

Wait, 200,000 is because 200 kg is 200,000 grams.

So numerator: 200,000 *0.0821 = 16,420.

Denominator: 0.01156.

So 16,420 ÷ 0.01156 = ?

Well, 0.01156 = 1.156e-2.

So 16,420 / 0.01156 ≈ 16,420 * 86.8 (since 1/0.01156≈86.4).

Let me compute 16,420 * 86.4.

But perhaps a more accurate way: 16,420 ÷ 0.01156.

Let me compute 16420 ÷ 0.01156.

Let me compute 0.01156 = 11.56e-3.

So 16,420 / 0.01156 = (16,420 * 1e3) / 11.56 = 16,420,000 / 11.56 ≈ 

16,420,000 ÷11.56.

Compute 16,420,000 ÷ 11.56.

Approximately,

11.56 * 1,420,000 = ?

11.56 *1,000,000 =11,560,000.

11.56 * 420,000 = 11.56 *4.2e5 = approx 48,552,000? Wait, wait, 4e5 is 400,000.

Wait, no, 420,000 *11.56 = 420,000 *10=4,200,000 +420,000*1.56=655,200 → total 4,855,200.

So 11.56 * (1,420,000) = 11.56*(1e6 +420,000) =11,560,000 +4,855,200=16,415,200.

Which is very close to 16,420,000. So 1,420,000 would give 16,415,200. The difference is 16,420,000 -16,415,200=4,800.

So 4,800 /11.56 ≈415 more. So total V≈1,420,415 liters.

Which is approximately 1.42e6 liters. So option B is 1.42e6, which matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had about 1.425e6, but with this calculation, it's closer to 1.42e6.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the volume of air at 100°C required for a hot-air balloon with a gross lifting power of 200 kg, we analyze the problem using the ideal gas law and buoyancy principles. The gross lifting power is defined as the difference between the mass of displaced ambient air and the mass of the hot air inside the balloon.

### Key Parameters:
1. **Ambient air**:  
   - Temperature, \( T_1 = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298 \, \text{K} \)  
   - Pressure, \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \)  
   - Molecular weight, \( M_1 = 29 \, \text{g/mol} \)  

2. **Hot air**:  
   - Temperature, \( T_2 = 100^\circ \text{C} = 373 \, \text{K} \)  
   - Pressure, \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \)  
   - Molecular weight, \( M_2 = 32 \, \text{g/mol} \)  

3. **Gas constant**:  
   \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)  

4. **Lifting power**:  
   \( m_1 - m_2 = 200 \, \text{kg} = 200,000 \, \text{g} \), where \( m_1 \) is the mass of displaced air and \( m_2 \) is the mass of hot air.

### Step 1: Mass of Air Using the Ideal Gas Law
The mass of air is given by:  
\[
m = \frac{P V M}{R T}
\]
For ambient air:  
\[
m_1 = \frac{P V M_1}{R T_1}
\]
For hot air:  
\[
m_2 = \frac{P V M_2}{R T_2}
\]

### Step 2: Lifting Power Equation
The lifting power is:  
\[
m_1 - m_2 = 200,000 \, \text{g}
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \):  
\[
\frac{P V M_1}{R T_1} - \frac{P V M_2}{R T_2} = 200,000
\]
Factoring out \( \frac{P V}{R} \):  
\[
\frac{P V}{R} \left( \frac{M_1}{T_1} - \frac{M
