The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man and a woman conspired together to rob a bank. As they were exiting the bank after the robbery they were confronted by armed tactical police officers. The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?

Options:

A: Yes, because the felony murder rule only applies when the defendant is the one who directly causes the death.
B: Yes, because the police officer who shot the woman should be the one charged with murder, not the man.
C: No, because felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot as long as a death occurred during the commission of the felony.
D: No, because the man's decision to raise his gun at the officers instigated the shooting, making him responsible for the woman's death.
E: No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.
F: Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.
G: Yes, because the woman was a co-conspirator, not a victim of the crime, and therefore her death does not qualify as a felony murder.
H: No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.
I: Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.
J: No, because the man was part of the crime and his actions led directly to the woman's death.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about felony murder, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a man and a woman conspired to rob a bank. When they were exiting, they were confronted by armed police. The man raised his gun, and then a bunch of shots were fired. The man survived his injuries, but the woman was killed by a police bullet. The man was charged with felony murder for her death and convicted. Now, he's appealing. The question is whether the appellate court will reverse the conviction under the modern view of felony murder.

I remember that felony murder is a doctrine that holds a defendant responsible for a murder that occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of intent. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics, especially regarding who actually causes the death.

In this case, the woman was killed by a police officer's bullet, not by the man. So, the question is whether the man can be held liable for her death under felony murder. 

I think there are different approaches. The traditional view might hold that any death during the felony, even by a third party like the police, makes the felon guilty. But I've heard that some jurisdictions have moved away from that, especially in cases where the third party's actions are an intervening cause.

Wait, so what's the prevailing modern view? I think the modern approach is more restrictive. Some courts have held that if a third party (like a police officer) kills someone during the commission of a felony, the felon isn't automatically guilty of murder. But it might depend on whether the third party's actions were foreseeable.

In this scenario, the man and woman were committing a robbery, and when they exited, the man raised his gun at the police, leading to a shootout. So, the police response might be seen as a foreseeable consequence of the robbery and the man's actions. 

I recall something about the "provocateur" doctrine. If the defendant's actions provoke a third party into using deadly force, then the defendant can be held responsible. So, by raising his gun, the man might have instigated the police shooting, making him responsible under felony murder.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the felony murder applies only if the defendant directly causes the death. That doesn't sound right because felony murder doesn't require direct causation. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B suggests charging the police officer, but that's not how felony murder works. The police are justified in using force, so they wouldn't be charged. So B is wrong.

Option C says it applies regardless of who fires the shot. That's the traditional view, but I'm not sure if that's the modern approach. Some places might have moved away from that.

Option D says the man instigated the shooting, making him responsible. This aligns with the idea that his actions led to the police response, so D could be correct.

Option E claims all states apply felony murder regardless of who fired. I don't think that's true. Some states have exceptions, especially when the death is caused by a third party like law enforcement.

Option F says the rule is unconstitutional. I don't recall any such ruling, so F is likely incorrect.

Option G argues that since she was a co-conspirator, it's not felony murder. But co-conspirators can be victims if they're killed during the felony, so G is probably wrong.

Option H states that the man caused the death by starting the shootout. This sounds similar to D. It suggests his actions led directly, so H could also be a contender.

Option I says the majority view doesn't apply felony murder if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person. I think this is the modern approach, where the death caused by a third party, especially police, may not fall under felony murder unless the defendant's actions were the proximate cause.

Option J says his actions led directly to her death, so he's guilty. That's a bit vague, but it might align with D or H.

So, putting it together, the traditional view (C) would hold him guilty regardless, but the modern view might require that the defendant's actions were the direct cause or that the third party's actions were a foreseeable result.

In this case, the man pointing the gun likely made the police response foreseeable. So, under the modern view, he could still be held liable because his actions instigated the police shooting, making the death a foreseeable consequence of the felony.

Looking back at the options, D and H seem relevant. D says because he instigated the shooting, and H says because he started the shots and caused her death.

Wait, the question is about the modern view. Some modern approaches limit felony murder to when the death is caused by the defendant or another co-felon. Deaths caused by third parties, especially law enforcement, might not count unless the defendant's actions were the proximate cause.

So, in this scenario, the man's action of raising his gun could be seen as provoking the police, making their response foreseeable. Therefore, the appellate court might uphold the conviction because his actions led directly, under the modern view.

Wait, but some jurisdictions have moved away from holding felons responsible for deaths caused by police. So I'm a bit torn between options C and D.

Wait, the question states the "prevailing modern view." I think the modern view is that felony murder does not apply when the death is caused by a third party, unless the defendant's actions were the but-for cause and the third party's actions were foreseeable. In this case, raising a gun at police would make their lethal response foreseeable.

So the man's actions could make him responsible. Therefore, the appellate court might not reverse the conviction.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: No, because the man's decision to raise his gun instigated the shooting, making him responsible.

Option I: Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder doesn't apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Which is the majority modern view?

I think the traditional rule (C) holds the felon liable regardless, but the modern approach (I) says it doesn't apply when a third party kills, unless the defendant's actions were the cause.

In some cases, courts have held that when the police kill a co-felon, the other felon isn't guilty of murder because the police are an external force. But other courts might find that the defendant's actions (like pointing a gun) led to the police response, making it foreseeable.

So, the modern view could go either way. But I think the prevailing modern view is that the felony murder rule applies when the death was a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions, even if caused by a third party.

So, in this case, the man's action of raising the gun would make the police shooting foreseeable. Therefore, the appellate court would not reverse the conviction, meaning the answer is D or C.

Wait, but option C says it applies regardless of who fired. That would be the traditional view, not the modern. The modern view is more restrictive.

So, under the modern view, the answer would be I: Yes, because the majority view doesn't apply felony murder when a co-conspirator is killed by a third person.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Some states have abolished felony murder entirely, but that's not the case here. Others have limited it. For example, in People v. Knoller, the California Supreme Court held that a defendant could be guilty of felony murder when a death is caused by a third party if the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause.

In this case, the man's act of pointing a gun could be seen as the proximate cause of the police shooting, making him guilty. So the modern view might still hold him liable, meaning the appellate court would not reverse.

Wait, but some jurisdictions have specific rules. For example, the "merger rule" or "felony murder rule" applies when the killing is done by a co-felon. But when it's a third party, like police, some courts say it's not felony murder unless the defendant's actions directly caused it.

I think the majority modern view is that if the death is caused by a third party, the felony murder rule doesn't apply unless the defendant's actions were the proximate cause. But in this scenario, the man's actions of raising the gun could be the proximate cause.

So, the appellate court might uphold the conviction, meaning the answer is D or C.

Alternatively, if the modern view excludes third-party deaths, then the answer would be I.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall some cases. In the case of People v. Knoller, the California Supreme Court held that when a third party (like a police officer) kills a felon, the other felon can be guilty of murder under felony murder if the killing was a natural and probable consequence of the defendant's actions.

So, in this case, the man's raising the gun would make the police response a natural and probable consequence. Thus, the appellate court would affirm the conviction, meaning the answer is D or C.

Wait, the options: C says it applies regardless of who fires the shot. D says because he instigated the shooting, making him responsible.

So, under Knoller, the answer would be that the conviction stands because the man's actions were the proximate cause. So the appellate court would not reverse, meaning the answer is D.

But let me look at the options again. Option I says the majority view is that felony murder doesn't apply when a co-conspirator is killed by a third party. If that's the case, then the answer would be I: Yes, the conviction is reversed.

But I'm not sure if that's the majority view. Some sources say that the traditional rule holds the felon responsible, but modern approaches often limit it.

Wait, I think the majority modern view is that felony murder does not apply when the killing is done by a third party, such as a police officer, acting in their duty. So the answer would be I.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to think again.

In the case where a defendant is fleeing and the police kill a bystander, the defendant might not be guilty of felony murder because the police action is an intervening cause. But if the defendant directly causes the police to shoot by pointing a gun, it might be seen as foreseeable.

Alternatively, some courts have held that when a co-felon is killed by police, the other felon is not guilty of felony murder because the police are an external force. But others might find that the defendant's actions led to the police response.

So, perhaps the modern view is that the felony murder rule does not apply when a third party, like the police, causes the death unless the defendant's actions were the but-for cause and it was foreseeable.

In this case, the man's action of raising the gun made the police shooting foreseeable, so the court would affirm the conviction. Thus, the answer would be D or C.

Wait, but option C says it applies regardless of who fires, which is the traditional view. The modern view is more restrictive, so C wouldn't be correct under the modern approach. Therefore, the answer would be D.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to summarize:

- Traditional view: Any death during felony makes defendant guilty, regardless of who causes it. So C would be correct, but the question is about the modern view.

- Modern view: Some states limit it. If the death is caused by a third party (like police), felony murder may not apply unless the defendant's actions were the direct cause.

In this case, the man's action of raising the gun led to the police shooting, so the death was a foreseeable result. Therefore, under the modern view, the conviction stands, so the answer is D.

But I'm not 100% confident. Another approach: The felony murder rule in many jurisdictions applies even if the killing is done by a third party, as long as it's in the course of the felony and a natural consequence.

So, the appellate court would not reverse, meaning the answer is C or D. But the question is about the modern view. I think the modern view is moving towards requiring the defendant's actions to be the proximate cause, so D would be correct.

Alternatively, if the modern view excludes third-party killings, then I would be correct. But I think in many modern jurisdictions, they still apply felony murder if the third party's action was a natural and probable consequence of the defendant's actions.

So, the appellate court would likely not reverse the conviction because the man's actions led to the police response, making the woman's death a foreseeable result of the robbery.

Thus, the correct answer would be D: No, because the man's decision to raise his gun instigated the shooting, making him responsible.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I says the majority view is that it doesn't apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person. So I'm a bit torn between D and I.

I think I need to pick the best answer. I'll go with D because the man's actions directly led to the shooting, making him responsible under the modern view.

The question revolves around whether the appellate court will reverse the felony-murder conviction of the man under the modern view of the felony murder rule. The scenario involves a bank robbery where the man and a woman were co-conspirators. During the confrontation with police, the man raised his gun, leading to a shootout. The woman was killed by a police officer's bullet, and the man was charged with felony murder for her death.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The felony murder rule does not require the defendant to directly cause the death. It applies even if the death is caused by another party during the commission of the felony.

2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The police officer's actions are not the focus of felony murder; the rule applies to the defendant's responsibility for deaths occurring during the felony, regardless of who fires the fatal shot.

3. **Option C**: Represents the traditional view of felony murder, which holds the defendant liable for any death occurring during the felony, regardless of who causes it. However, the question asks about the **modern view**, which is more restrictive, so this option is less likely to be correct.

4. **Option D**: Aligns with the modern view. The man's decision to raise his gun at the police instigated the shooting, making the woman's death a foreseeable consequence of his actions. Under the modern view, felony murder applies if the death was a natural and probable result of the defendant's actions, even if caused by a third party.

5. **Option E**: Incorrect. Not all states apply the felony murder rule universally. Many jurisdictions have moved toward more restrictive interpretations, particularly when the death is caused by a third party like law enforcement.

6. **Option F**: Incorrect. There is no indication that the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.

7. **Option G**: Incorrect. The fact that the woman was a co-conspirator does not exclude her death from qualifying as felony murder. Co-conspirators can be victims of felony murder if their death occurs during the commission of the crime.

8. **Option H**: Similar to Option D, it focuses on the man's actions leading directly to the woman's death. However, it is less precise in addressing the legal standard of foreseeability under the modern view.

9. **Option I**: Suggests that the majority modern view excludes felony murder when a co-conspirator is killed by a third party. While some jurisdictions adopt this approach, the prevailing modern view often holds the defendant responsible if the death was a foreseeable result of their actions.

10. **Option J**: Too vague. While it suggests the man's actions led to the woman's death, it does not address the specific legal standards of the modern view.

### Conclusion:
The modern view of felony murder focuses on whether the death was a foreseeable and natural consequence of the defendant's actions. In this case, the man's decision to raise his gun at the police created a situation where the police response, and the resulting death, were foreseeable. Therefore, the appellate court is unlikely to reverse the conviction. The best answer is **D**, as it captures the essence of the modern view and the foreseeability of the woman's death due to the man's actions.

Answer: D
