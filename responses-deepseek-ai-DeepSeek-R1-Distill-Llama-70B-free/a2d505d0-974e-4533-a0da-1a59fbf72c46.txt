Okay, so I've got this question about 8-bit representations and adding two numbers, 109 and -42. The question is asking in which of the three systems—One's complement, Two's complement, or Sign and magnitude—the addition is within range. The options are I, II, III, and the choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, let me start by recalling each of these number systems. I'm a bit rusty, so I need to think carefully.

First, Sign and Magnitude. In this system, the first bit is the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the remaining 7 bits are the magnitude. So for positive numbers, the range is 0 to +127, and for negatives, it's -127 to 0. Wait, but wait—actually, the maximum positive is 127, and the minimum negative is -127. So the overall range is from -127 to +127.

Next, One's Complement. In one's complement, positive numbers are the same as unsigned, I think. For negatives, you invert the bits of the positive number. But importantly, zero can be either all 0s or all 1s. Oh wait, no, in one's complement, zero is all 0s, and the negative zero would be all 1s. So the range here is from -127 (which is represented as 11111111) to +127. Wait, no, in one's complement, the maximum positive is 127 (01111111), and the minimum is -127 (10000000). Wait, no: wait, 10000000 in one's complement would be -128, but that's actually in two's complement. Wait, no, in one's complement, the range is symmetric around -127.5, I think. Wait, no—wait, in one's complement, the range is from -127 to +127, but the system can't represent -128. Wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, for 8 bits, the maximum magnitude for one's complement is 127, because the sign bit is one bit. So the range is -127 to +127. Because for example, +127 is 01111111, and -127 is 10000000 (since inverting 01111111 gives 10000000). So the range is -127 to +127.

Wait, no—wait, when you have 8 bits, the largest positive number in one's complement is 127, and the most negative is -127. Because 10000000 is -127, and 01111111 is +127.

Now, Two's complement. That's a bit different. In two's complement, the range is from -128 to +127. Because the most significant bit represents -128, so 10000000 is -128, and 01111111 is +127. So the maximum positive is 127, and the minimum is -128.

So, the numbers we're adding are 109 and -42. Let's compute the sum: 109 + (-42) = 67. So the sum is 67, which is positive and within 0-127. So the question is whether this sum can be represented, and whether the addition can be done without causing an overflow in each system.

Wait, but wait, when adding numbers, the issue is whether the sum is within the representable range. So in all three systems, 67 is positive and within the maximum positive value. So the sum is 67, which is fine. But wait, maybe the question is about whether during the addition, any intermediate steps cause an overflow beyond what the system can handle.

Wait, no, the question is whether the addition is within range. So, perhaps it's whether the sum, 67, is representable, which it is in all three systems. But wait, maybe the initial numbers are not representable in some systems.

Wait, let's check each system.

In Sign and Magnitude:

109 is positive, so it's 0 followed by the 7 bits representing 109. 8 bits: 109 in 7 bits is 109 is 64+32+ 8+ 4 + 1 = 109 is 64 (1), 32 (1), 16 (0), 8 (1), 4 (1), 2 (0), 1 (1). Wait, 64 is 6th bit (from right), 32 is 5th, 16 is 4th, etc. So 109 is 64+32+ 8+4+1 = 109 is 1101101 in binary. So 0 followed by 1101101 gives 01101101. That's fine, since 127 is the maximum, so 109 is within range.

-42: sign bit 1, followed by 42. 42 in binary is 00101010, but wait, 42 is 32+8+2, so 32 is 5th bit, so 8 bits would be 00101010. So the sign and magnitude would be 1 followed by 00101010, which is 10010110.

So both 109 and -42 are within the representable range in Sign and Magnitude.

In One's complement:

109 is positive; same as before, 01101101.

-42: the one's complement of 42. 42 is 00101010. Inverting the bits gives 11010101. So the representation is 11010101.

So both numbers are within the range of one's complement, which is -127 to +127.

In Two's complement:

109 is 01101101.

-42: two's complement is calculated by inverting the bits of 42 and adding 1. 42 is 00101010. Invert to 11010101, add 1 to get 11010110.

So the two numbers are 01101101 (109) and 11010110 (-42). Both are within the two's complement range, which is -128 to 127.

So the sum is 67, which is positive and within all systems' ranges.

Wait, but the question is whether the addition is within range. Does that mean that the numbers can be added without causing an overflow beyond their maximums?

Wait, perhaps I should think about what happens when adding the two numbers in each system. Let me calculate the sum.

109 in binary: 01101101.

-42 in two's complement is 11010110.

Adding them: 01101101 + 11010110.

Let's add:

01101101
+11010110
= (0+1)=1, (1+1)=10, (1+0)=1, (0+1)=1, (1+1)=10, (1+0)=1, (0+1)=1, (1+0)=1.

Wait, let me add bit by bit, starting from the right:

Rightmost bit: 1 + 0 = 1.

Next: 0 + 1 = 1.

Next: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Next: 1 + 0 + carryover 1: 0 with carryover 1.

Next: 0 + 1 + carryover 1: 0 with carryover 1.

Next: 1 + 0 + carryover 1: 0 with carryover 1.

Next: 1 + 1 + carryover 1: 1 with carryover 1.

Leftmost bit: 0 + 1 + carryover 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Wait, but in 8 bits, if there's a carryover beyond the 8 bits, that's an overflow. So the sum would be 1 00111011, but since we have 8 bits, the carryover is lost. So the result is 00111011, which is 59 in decimal? Wait, no, wait 00111011 is 32+16+8+2+1=59.

Wait, but 109 + (-42) is 67, not 59. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition.

Wait, maybe I should do it in a more systematic way. Let's write both numbers in 8 bits:

109: 01101101

-42: 11010110

Adding them:

01101101
+11010110
------------

Let's add each bit from right to left, keeping track of carry.

Starting with the rightmost bit:

1 + 0 = 1 → sum bit 1, carry 0.

Next bit: 0 + 1 = 1 → sum 1, carry 0.

Next: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Next: 1 + 0 + carry 1 → 0, carry 1.

Next: 0 + 1 + carry 1 → 0, carry 1.

Next: 1 + 0 + carry 1 → 0, carry 1.

Next: 1 + 1 + carry 1 → 1, carry 1.

Leftmost bit: 0 + 1 + carry 1 → 0, carry 1.

So the sum is 00111011 (since the leading carry is lost), which is 59. Wait, that's not correct because 109-42 is 67. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the addition?

Wait, maybe I have the two's complement of -42 wrong. Let me recalculate -42 in two's complement.

42 in 8 bits is 00101010.

Invert the bits: 11010101.

Add 1: 11010101 + 1 = 11010110. So that's correct.

So when adding 01101101 (109) and 11010110 (-42), the sum is 00111011, which is 59, which is not 67. That can't be right. So where's the mistake here?

Wait, I think I must have messed up the binary addition.

Wait, let's try adding 109 and -42 in decimal: 109 - 42 = 67. So the correct sum is 67.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm adding the two 8-bit numbers, but the actual sum is 67, which is 01000011 in binary. But my previous addition gave 00111011, which is 59. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I should compute 109 + (-42) in two's complement.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to convert both numbers to their two's complement forms and perform binary addition, but let's do it step by step.

109 is 01101101.

-42 is 11010110.

Adding them:

01101101  
+11010110  
------------

Let's add the bits:

Starting from the right:

1 + 0 = 1 (sum 1, carry 0)

0 + 1 = 1 (sum 1, carry 0)

1 + 1 = 0 (sum 0, carry 1)

1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 0 (sum 0, carry 1)

0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0 (sum 0, carry 1)

1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 0 (sum 0, carry 1)

1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 1 (sum 1, carry 1)

0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0 (sum 0, carry 1)

The carry after the leftmost bit is 1, which is beyond 8 bits, so it's lost. So the sum is 00111011, which is 59, but that's not 67. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the binary addition. Let me add 01101101 and 11010110 using another method.

Alternatively, I can compute 109 + (-42) = 67. Now, 67 in binary is 01000011.

But according to my addition, I get 00111011, which is 59. That suggests an error in the binary addition. I must have made a mistake in the process.

Wait, perhaps I should use another approach: add 109 and 42, then subtract, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum in binary correctly.

Wait, maybe I should write it out in columns.

Let me write the two numbers:

     0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 (109)
   + 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 (-42)
----------------------------
Let me add each column, starting from the right (LSB on the right):

Bit 7 (leftmost) to bit 0 (rightmost):

Bit 0: 1 + 0 = 1 → sum 1, carry 0.

Bit 1: 0 + 1 → 1, carry 0.

Bit 2: 1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

Bit 3: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) → 1, carry 0.

Wait, wait, no, the two numbers are:

First number (109): 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1.

Second number (-42):1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, the two's complement of -42 is 11010110, which is 8 bits. So:

109 is 01101101.

-42 is 11010110.

So:

Bit positions (from right, 0 to 7):

109: bits are:

7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

-42 is:

1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0

So when adding:

Let me write each bit position:

Bit 0: 1 (from 109) + 0 (from -42) → 1, carry 0.

Bit 1: 0 + 1 → 1, carry 0.

Bit 2: 1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

Bit 3: 0 + 0 + carry 1 → 1, carry 0.

Bit 4: 1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

Bit 5: 1 + 0 + carry 1 → 0, carry 1.

Bit 6: 1 + 1 + carry 1 → 1, carry 1.

Bit 7: 0 + 1 + carry 1 → 0, carry 1.

So the sum is 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1, but wait, that's 9 bits, but we're using 8, so the carry out is lost, and the sum is 00111011, which is 59 in decimal. Wait, but that can't be right because 109 -42 is 67. So where is the mistake?

Ah, I think I'm miscalculating the two's complement of -42. Wait, let's redo the two's complement for -42.

42 in binary is 00101010.

Inverting the bits gives 11010101.

Adding 1: 11010101 + 1 = 11010110. So that's correct.

So perhaps the mistake is that in two's complement, adding 109 and -42 gives 67, which is correct, but when adding their 8-bit representations, it's giving 59. That can't be, so I must have messed up the binary addition.

Wait, perhaps I should use another approach. Let me compute 109 as a positive number and -42 as a negative number in two's complement, then add them.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm adding the bits. Let me try adding 109 and -42 in decimal, which is 67, and see what 67 is in two's complement.

67 in binary is 64 + 2 +1 = 01000011.

So the correct sum should be 01000011.

Wait, perhaps I should perform the binary addition again more carefully.

Let me write the two numbers:

01101101 (109)
+11010110 (-42)
----------------

Let me add them step by step:

Starting from the rightmost bit:

1 + 0 = 1 → sum 1, carry 0.

0 + 1 → 1, carry 0.

1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

0 + 0 + 1 → 1, carry 0.

1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

1 + 0 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

1 + 1 + 1 → 1, carry 1.

0 + 1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

So the sum is 00111011 (since the carry is dropped), which is 59. But this doesn't match the expected 67. So what's wrong here?

Wait, I think I might have the two's complement of -42 wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm adding the bits incorrectly.

Wait, another approach: in two's complement, adding 109 (01101101) and -42 (11010110) should give 67, which is 01000011.

Let me try adding 109 and -42 in two's complement:

Another way to add is to note that 109 + (-42) = 67.

But when I add 01101101 and 11010110, I should get 01000011.

Wait, let me try binary addition again, but perhaps I'm miscounting the bits.

Wait, let me write it vertically:

   0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
+ 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
-------------------------
= ?

Let me add each column from right to left, tracking carry.

Rightmost (bit 0):

1 + 0 → 1, carry 0.

Bit 1:

0 + 1 → 1, carry 0.

Bit 2:

1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

Bit 3:

0 + 0 + 1 → 1, carry 0.

Bit 4:

1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

Bit 5:

1 + 0 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

Bit 6:

1 + 1 + 1 → 1, carry 1.

Bit 7:

0 + 1 + 1 → 0, carry 1.

So the sum is 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1, but we're using 8 bits, so the carry is lost, and we have 00111011, which is 59. But that's not correct. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the addition is correct, but
