Question:

An experienced equestrian rider sued a woman, claiming that her horse kicked and injured the rider. At trial, the rider testified that he was attending a horse show when, without provocation, he was kicked by a gray stallion with a black tail. The rider then called the woman as an adverse witness and asked her the following question: "Isn't it true that you are the owner and trainer of a gray stallion with a black tail?" After answering affirmatively, the woman was not asked any further questions on direct examination. Whereupon in cross- examination, the woman was then asked, "Isn't it true that your horse is very gentle and would not kick anyone unless provoked?"Upon objection by the rider's attorney, the rider's strongest argument would be that the woman's proffered testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: inadmissible as an improper form of impeachment.
C: inadmissible as substantive evidence to show that the horse must have been provoked.
D: inadmissible, because the woman's testimony contradicts the rider's account.
E: inadmissible as beyond the scope of the woman's direct testimony.
F: admissible as it provides evidence of the horse's general behavior.
G: inadmissible, because the woman's testimony is biased.
H: admissible as it is relevant to the case.
I: admissible, because it can refute the rider's claim.

Okay, so I have this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the scenario is that an experienced equestrian rider is suing a woman because her horse kicked and injured him. At the trial, the rider testified that he was at a horse show when, without provocation, a gray stallion with a black tail kicked him. Then, the rider called the woman as an adverse witness. So, I remember that an adverse witness is someone who is hostile or not favorable to the party calling them, but here the rider is calling her, so she's probably not on his side.

The rider asked her a question: "Isn't it true that you are the owner and trainer of a gray stallion with a black tail?" She answered yes. Then, the rider didn't ask her any more questions on direct. So, now it's the defense's turn, I guess, because she's the defendant. So in cross-examination, the woman was asked, "Isn't it true that your horse is very gentle and would not kick anyone unless provoked?" The rider's attorney objected, and the question is about the rider's strongest argument for why this testimony is inadmissible.

The options are A through J, but the options given are A to I. Hmm.

So, I need to figure out why the rider would object to the woman's testimony about the horse's gentle nature.

First, I think about the rules of evidence. The rider is the plaintiff, suing the woman, so the defense would be presenting their case. The woman is testifying in her own defense, I suppose. So when she was called as an adverse witness by the rider, the rider only asked about ownership of the horse, then the defense on cross-examination asked about the horse's temperament.

Wait, but wait, when a witness is called by a party, the opposing party can cross-examine. So the rider called the woman, so his direct was limited. Then the defense (the woman's side) would cross-examine her. But wait, is the woman the defendant? Yes, so her attorney would be conducting the cross-examination. So in cross, they asked her about the horse's gentle nature.

The rider's attorney objected, so the issue is whether that testimony is admissible.

So the rider's strongest argument is that the testimony is inadmissible. Why?

Looking at the options, option E says it's inadmissible beyond the scope of direct. But wait, in cross-examination, the scope is limited to the subjects covered on direct. So if the rider only asked about ownership, then the defense on cross can't go into other areas unless they're relevant. Or wait, no—when you call a witness, the cross-examination is limited to the topics covered on direct. So if the rider only asked about ownership, then cross can only deal with that, unless it's a matter affecting credibility.

Wait, but the defense is asking about the horse's behavior. So perhaps the rider's attorney would argue that the cross is beyond the scope of direct. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony is being used substantively, and it's hearsay. But the woman is testifying herself about her horse's behavior, so that's not hearsay. So option A is probably not correct.

Option C says it's inadmissible as substantive evidence to show the horse must have been provoked. Hmm. Because if the horse is gentle, it wouldn't kick without provocation, so maybe the rider was at fault. But is that the correct way to present it?

Wait, evidence about the horse's general behavior could be admissible as character evidence for the horse. But under the Federal Rules, character evidence is generally not admissible except in specific situations. Wait, but in this case, the horse's behavior is a characteristic, so maybe it's admissible as a relevant fact, not just character evidence.

Wait, but the issue is whether the cross-examination testimony is admissible. So the defense is asking the woman about her horse's behavior, and she's testifying that it's gentle and wouldn't kick unless provoked. So that's substantive evidence about the incident. It's not just impeachment.

Wait, but wait. The rider called the woman as an adverse witness and only asked about ownership. So in cross, the defense can ask about other relevant matters beyond the direct, but I'm a bit confused about the scope of cross-examination.

Wait, no. The scope of cross-examination is generally limited to the subjects covered on direct examination, plus any matters affecting the credibility of the witness. So if the rider only asked about ownership, then the cross-examination can't go into other areas unless they're relevant to credibility or within the scope.

But in this case, the woman's testimony about the horse's temperament is relevant to the issue of whether the horse would have kicked without provocation, which goes to the merits of the case. So perhaps the cross is beyond the scope of direct, making the testimony inadmissible.

But wait, in this case, the rider called the woman and asked about ownership, so the defense's cross could be on any matter relevant, but perhaps not beyond that. Alternatively, maybe the testimony is admissible as substantive evidence because it's about a specific instance, not general character.

Wait, but the question is about the rider's strongest argument. So options E says it's inadmissible beyond the scope of direct. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony is being used to prove that the horse is gentle, which would mean that the rider must have provoked it, thus making the woman not liable. So the testimony is substantive evidence to show that the horse wouldn't kick unless provoked.

So the rider's attorney would argue that the testimony is inadmissible as substantive evidence because it's trying to prove a specific act (the horse's behavior on that day) through general character evidence. Wait, but the testimony is about the horse's general behavior, which is being used to infer that it wouldn't have kicked without provocation. So under the evidence rules, specific instances of conduct can be used for certain purposes, but character evidence is generally not admissible except for when it's an essential element of the claim.

Wait, under FRE 405, methods of proving character include testimony about reputation or opinion, but specific instances can't be used to prove conduct on a particular occasion, except when character is an essential element. In this case, is the horse's temperament an essential element? Probably not. The issue is whether the horse kicked and whether the owner is liable. So maybe the testimony about the horse's general gentleness is inadmissible as character evidence.

But wait, the question is about the rider's strongest argument. So if the testimony is about the horse's general behavior, it's character evidence, which is inadmissible under 405 because it's not an essential element. So the rider could argue that it's inadmissible as substantive evidence because it's character evidence. But looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible as substantive evidence to show that the horse must have been provoked. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the testimony is admissible as non-character evidence. Because the horse's behavior is a specific fact—so the woman's testimony is about the horse's general behavior, which is being used to show that it wouldn't kick without provocation. But under the rules, using specific instances to prove conduct on a particular occasion is not allowed unless it's for a permitted purpose.

Wait, but in a civil case, when a party's character is at issue, but I don't think that's the case here. So, perhaps the testimony is inadmissible because it's using the horse's general behavior to suggest that the horse wouldn't have kicked without provocation, which would require that the rider must have provoked it, making the horse's owner not liable.

So the rider's attorney would argue that this testimony is inadmissible as substantive evidence because it's using character evidence (the horse's general behavior) to prove that the horse acted in a certain way on the specific occasion, which is not allowed under FRE 405.

Alternatively, the testimony might be allowed as substantive evidence if it's about the horse's specific behavior rather than general character. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another angle: The woman is being cross-examined by her own attorney, right? Because the rider called her as an adverse witness, so the defense (woman's side) would conduct the cross. So the question is about whether the defense can elicit testimony about the horse's temperament beyond the scope of the rider's direct.

But the rider's direct only went to ownership. So the cross-examination question is about the horse's behavior, which is beyond the scope of direct. So the rider's attorney could object on the grounds that it's beyond the scope, making the testimony inadmissible unless the court allows it.

So looking at option E: inadmissible beyond the scope of the woman's direct testimony. That might be the strongest argument.

Wait, but in cross-examination, the scope is generally limited to the subjects covered on direct and matters affecting credibility. So if the rider only asked about ownership, then the cross can't go into other areas unless they relate to credibility. But the horse's temperament isn't about credibility; it's about a substantive issue in the case.

Therefore, the rider's attorney could argue that the cross is beyond the scope, making the testimony inadmissible. So option E would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the court allows it, the testimony could be relevant, but the rider's strongest argument is that it's beyond the scope.

So looking at the options, E says inadmissible because beyond the scope of direct. That seems plausible.

Other options: Option C says it's inadmissible as substantive evidence to show the horse must have been provoked. So the argument there is that the testimony is being used as substantive evidence, which might be improper. But I think the more direct objection is about the scope of cross-examination.

So I think the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony during cross-examination in a civil trial. The rider, as the plaintiff, called the woman (the defendant) as an adverse witness and only asked about her ownership of the horse. On cross-examination, the woman was asked about the horse's gentle nature and whether it would kick without provocation. The rider's attorney objected, and the task is to determine the rider's strongest argument for why this testimony is inadmissible.

Under the rules of evidence, the scope of cross-examination is generally limited to the subjects covered during direct examination, plus any matters affecting the witness's credibility. Here, the rider's direct examination only addressed the woman's ownership of the horse. The cross-examination question about the horse's temperament, however, went beyond the scope of the direct testimony and was not related to the woman's credibility. Therefore, the rider's strongest argument is that the testimony is inadmissible because it exceeds the permissible scope of cross-examination.

While other options, such as the testimony being inadmissible as substantive evidence or character evidence, are plausible, the most direct and relevant objection is that the testimony is beyond the scope of the direct examination. This makes Option E the correct answer.

**Answer: E**
