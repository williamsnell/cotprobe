Okay, so I've got this question here about an approach used to convey information and educate large audiences through TV and radio. The question is asking what this approach is called. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, let's break this down. The key points are that it's an approach, using TV and radio, aimed at educating large groups. So it's a method of communication that's widespread and probably intended to inform or persuade the public about something important.

Looking at the options:

A: Social marketing. I remember social marketing is about using marketing techniques to promote social causes, like health campaigns. It's aimed at changing behavior, so that might fit since it's educating through media.

B: Opinion leaders. These are individuals who influence others' opinions. But the question is about a method, not individuals, so maybe not B.

C: Media manipulation. That sounds more like using media to control or distort information, which is different from educating.

D: Political campaigning. That's more about promoting a candidate or policy, not necessarily educational.

E: Mass communication. This refers to communicating to a large audience through media. It's a broad term, but I'm not sure if it's the specific approach the question is pointing to.

F: Opinion formers. Similar to B, these are people who shape opinions, so probably not the answer.

G: Opinion followers. This seems like the opposite of leaders; maybe not relevant here.

H: Public relations. PR is about managing an organization's image and communication, but it's not specifically about educating through media.

I: Public broadcasting. That refers to TV and radio services intended for public benefit, often educational, but is it the approach or just the medium?

J: Propaganda. That's more about spreading information to influence opinions, often with a biased perspective, so it might not be the right fit since the question seems to focus on education.

Wait, the question says "help educate large target audiences through television and radio programmes." So it's using these media to educate. Social marketing often uses media to educate on social issues, so A could be a fit. Alternatively, mass communication (E) is about the method itself, but the term might be too broad.

But wait, the question refers to an approach. Social marketing is a strategy, while mass communication is more the general means. Public broadcasting (I) might be the medium rather than the approach. So the approach being used here is likely social marketing.

Alternatively, maybe it's public relations, but PR is more about managing information and relationships, not specifically educational campaigns.

Another thought: public broadcasting is about the service providing educational content, but the approach to convey info would be the method used, like social marketing. So I think the answer is A: Social marketing.

The approach described uses television and radio to educate large audiences, which aligns with social marketing. Social marketing employs media to promote social causes and educate the public, fitting the context of the question.

Answer: A
