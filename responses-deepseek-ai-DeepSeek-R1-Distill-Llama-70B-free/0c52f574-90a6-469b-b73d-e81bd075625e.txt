Okay, so I've got this question here about developmental models of intelligence, and I need to figure out which construct isn't pertinent to them. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but let me try to break this down.

The question is asking which of the listed options is NOT related to developmental models. So I need to go through each option and recall whether it's about how intelligence develops over time.

Option A: Triarchic theory of intelligence. I remember that's Robert Sternberg's theory. He proposed three aspects: analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. I think this is more about the types of intelligence rather than development, but I'm not sure if it's tied to developmental models.

Option B: Multiple intelligences theory. That's Howard Gardner's work. He says there are multiple types of intelligence, like linguistic, spatial, etc. This theory challenges the traditional view of a single intelligence factor. I don't recall this being specifically about development over time, but maybe it's considered a developmental model because it explains different types that can develop.

Option C: Cognitive development theory. This must be Jean Piaget's theory, which is all about how children develop through stages. Definitely a developmental model. So this one is pertinent.

Option D: The positive manifold. I think this refers to the idea that different cognitive abilities are positively correlated, meaning they tend to go together. Like how people who are good at one thing tend to be good at others. This is more about the structure of intelligence rather than development. So maybe this isn't a developmental model.

Option E: G theory. G stands for general intelligence. This is the concept that there's a single underlying factor for all cognitive abilities. Again, this is about the structure, not development. So E might not be pertinent.

Option F: Emotional intelligence theory. Peter Salovey and John Mayer's work. It's about recognizing and managing emotions. I don't think this is a developmental model; it's more of a specific type of intelligence.

Option G: Primary mental ability theory. That's from L.L. Thurstone, right? He proposed seven primary abilities like verbal comprehension, number facility, etc. This is a theory about the structure of intelligence, not about development.

Option H: Fluid and crystallized intelligence theory. I think this is Raymond Cattell's theory. Fluid intelligence is about processing speed and memory, while crystallized is about knowledge and experience. This theory explains how intelligence changes over time—fluid decreases with age, while crystallized increases. So this is a developmental model.

Option I: Investment theory. I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe it's about how people invest in their abilities, perhaps through practice or education, leading to development. Or perhaps it's related to how resources are allocated in developing different intelligences. If that's the case, it's a developmental model.

Option J: Information processing theory. This approach looks at how information is processed—like attention, memory, etc. It's more about the mechanisms of cognition rather than the development of intelligence over time. So this might not be a developmental model.

Wait, let me clarify each one again. The question is about which is NOT pertinent to developmental models.

So the developmental models would include theories that explain how intelligence changes, grows, or is structured over time.

C: Cognitive development (Piaget) is definitely developmental.

H: Fluid and crystallized (Cattell) is about changes over the lifespan, so yes.

I: Investment theory—maybe this is about how people develop their abilities through investment of resources, so it's developmental.

J: Information processing theory—I think this is more about how the mind processes info, mechanisms, not about development stages. So maybe J is not pertinent.

Wait, but some theories integrate information processing with development. Like maybe in how processing speeds change with age. Hmm, but I think J is more about the process than the development over time.

Wait, the question is which is NOT pertinent. So we're looking for the one that doesn't fit in with developmental models.

Let's think about each option again.

A: Triarchic theory—Sternberg's theory. It's about different types of intelligence but doesn't specifically model development over time. It's more about the structure of intelligence. So maybe A is not a developmental model.

B: Multiple intelligences—Gardner's. He talks about different intelligences, but I don't think it's about how they develop over time. It's more about their existence.

But wait, some theories might discuss how each intelligence develops. Hmm, not sure. I think Gardner's theory is more about types than about development.

Wait, but the question is about which is NOT pertinent. So which of these constructs isn't part of any developmental model.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of each theory and whether it's developmental.

A: Triarchic - types of intelligence, not specifically developmental.

B: Multiple intelligences - types, not about development.

C: Cognitive development - yes.

D: Positive manifold - structure, not development.

E: G theory - structure, not development.

F: Emotional intelligence - type, maybe some development aspects, but not a model of development.

G: Primary mental abilities - structure, not development.

H: Fluid and crystallized - development over time.

I: Investment theory - maybe about how abilities develop.

J: Information processing theory - perhaps about mechanisms, not development stages.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT pertinent. So the one that's not related to developmental models.

So the options that are developmental models are C, H, I, and maybe B or A?

Wait, but I think Triarchic theory does have a developmental aspect. Sternberg's theory might discuss how the three intelligences develop, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the types than the development.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which construct is not pertinent to developmental models. So, looking for a theory that doesn't deal with how intelligence develops over time.

So, options that are about structure rather than development. G theory (E), primary mental abilities (G), positive manifold (D), multiple intelligences (B), triarchic (A), emotional intelligence (F), information processing (J) are more about structure or types.

But which of these is not a developmental model.

Wait, the question says "only construct that is not pertinent". So which one is unrelated.

Wait, another approach: developmental models are about how intelligence develops, so theories about stages, growth, etc.

C: Cognitive development (Piaget) - definitely a developmental model.

H: Fluid and crystallized - developmental.

I: Investment theory - perhaps about how investment leads to growth, so developmental.

J: Information processing - maybe not, unless it's about how processing changes with age.

A: Triarchic - maybe not, unless it's about how the three aspects develop.

B: Multiple intelligences - perhaps each can develop, but the theory is more about types.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is G: Primary mental ability theory. Because that's about the structure of abilities, not about their development.

Alternatively, perhaps D: The positive manifold, which is about the correlations between abilities, not about development.

Wait, the question is to choose the one that is NOT pertinent. So which is not a developmental model.

I think the correct answer is D: The positive manifold. Because it's about the structure (correlation between abilities), not about development.

Alternatively, E: G theory is about general intelligence, which is also structural, not developmental.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: G theory. Because G theory is about the general factor, which is more about structure, not development.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The options:

A: Triarchic theory (types, but maybe includes development)

B: Multiple intelligences (types, not development)

C: Cognitive development (definitely yes)

D: Positive manifold (structure, not development)

E: G theory (structure, not development)

F: Emotional intelligence (type, maybe some development)

G: Primary mental abilities (structure, not development)

H: Fluid and crystallized (developmental)

I: Investment theory (developmental)

J: Information processing (mechanism, not development)

So the question is to pick the one that is NOT pertinent to developmental models. So all the ones that are about structure or types, not about development.

The question is which is the only construct not pertinent. So which one is unrelated.

Looking back, the correct answer is D: The positive manifold.

Wait, no. Because the positive manifold is the phenomenon where different cognitive tasks are positively correlated. It's a structural aspect, not about development. So yes, it's not a developmental model.

Alternatively, E: G theory is about the general intelligence factor, which is also structural.

Wait, but the question is looking for the one that's not pertinent. So perhaps D is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: G theory, because it's about the general factor, not about development.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Which of these is not a developmental model.

Cognitive development (C) is definitely a developmental model.

Fluid and crystallized (H) is about development over time.

Investment theory (I) is about how people develop their abilities.

Triarchic theory (A) might include some developmental aspects, but perhaps not as a core part.

Multiple intelligences (B) is about different types, not about their development.

Primary mental abilities (G) is about structure.

Emotional intelligence (F) is a type.

Positive manifold (D) is about structure.

G theory (E) is about structure.

Information processing (J) is about mechanisms.

So the question is which is not pertinent to developmental models. So the correct answer must be one that's not about development.

The options are A-J.

The question says which is NOT pertinent.

So the developmental models are C, H, I.

All others are not.

So which one is the correct answer? The question is asking which is not pertinent, so the one that doesn't fit.

The options A, B, D, E, F, G, J are not developmental models.

Wait, but the question is to select the only construct that is not pertinent. So perhaps the answer is E or D.

Wait, another approach: G theory is about the general factor. It's a part of the structure of intelligence, not about development.

So E: G theory is not a developmental model.

Similarly, D: Positive manifold is about structure.

But the question is to find the only construct that is not pertinent. So perhaps one of these is the answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: The positive manifold.

Because positive manifold is about the correlations between different cognitive tasks, which is structural, not developmental.

Alternatively, E: G theory is about general intelligence, which is also structural.

Wait, but the question is in the context of developmental models, so which is unrelated.

I think the correct answer is D: The positive manifold.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is E: G theory.

Alternatively, perhaps F: Emotional intelligence is not a developmental model, but it's a type of intelligence.

Wait, but the question is about developmental models, so any theory that doesn't explain development is the answer.

So the options not related to developmental models are: A, B, D, E, F, G, J.

The question is which is the only one not pertinent. So perhaps the correct answer is D: The positive manifold.

But I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look for which theories are considered developmental.

Okay, another angle: the developmental models include:

- Piaget's Cognitive Development

- Vygotsky's Sociocultural theory (not listed here)

- Erikson's psychosocial (not here)

- Kohlberg's moral development (not here)

- Sternberg's Triarchic theory (A) might have a developmental component.

- Cattell's Fluid and Crystallized (H) is developmental.

- Investment theory (I) is about development.

So the non-developmental ones are: B, D, E, F, G, J.

The question is which is the only one not pertinent.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Perhaps the correct answer is E: G theory.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the one that's a statistical term.

G theory is Generalizability theory, which is a statistical approach to assess the dependability of measurements. Wait, no, that's a different G theory. Or maybe in this context, G refers to general intelligence.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: The positive manifold.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of which of these is definitely not a developmental model.

G theory (E) is about general intelligence, which is a structural model.

Positive manifold (D) is about the correlations, also structural.

Primary mental abilities (G) is about specific abilities.

Triarchic (A) is about types.

Multiple intelligences (B) is about types.

Emotional intelligence (F) is a type.

Information processing (J) is about mechanisms.

So the only one that is not a developmental model is... all except C, H, I.

But the question is to pick the only one not pertinent. So perhaps the intended answer is D: The positive manifold.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is E: G theory.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the one that's a theory of the structure of intelligence, not about development.

In that case, the correct answer would be E: G theory.

But wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

The question is which is not pertinent to developmental models on intelligence.

So, the correct answer is the one that does not describe how intelligence develops.

So, all the options except C, H, I are structural or typal theories.

So, the answer is either D, E, G, etc., but the question says "only construct".

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is D: The positive manifold.

Because it's about the structure of intelligence, specifically the tendency of cognitive abilities to correlate positively, but not about how they develop.

So, the answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: G theory.

Wait, another thought: G theory in this context refers to general intelligence theory, which is a structural model. So E is not a developmental model.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think I'll go with D: The positive manifold as the answer because it's a structural aspect, not a developmental model.

To determine which construct is not pertinent to developmental models of intelligence, we need to identify theories that focus on how intelligence changes, grows, or develops over time. Developmental models typically explain stages, growth, or longitudinal changes in intelligence. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **A: Triarchic theory of intelligence**: This theory, proposed by Robert Sternberg, describes three types of intelligence (analytical, creative, and practical). While it focuses on the types of intelligence, it does not specifically model developmental changes over time.  
- **B: Multiple intelligences theory**: Howard Gardner's theory proposes multiple types of intelligence (e.g., linguistic, spatial). It is more about the diversity of intelligence types than about developmental processes.  
- **C: Cognitive development theory**: This is Jean Piaget's theory, which explicitly describes how intelligence develops through stages over time. It is a clear example of a developmental model.  
- **D: The positive manifold**: This refers to the phenomenon where different cognitive abilities are positively correlated. It is a structural concept, not a developmental model.  
- **E: G theory**: This theory posits the existence of a general intelligence factor (g). It is a structural model of intelligence, not a developmental one.  
- **F: Emotional intelligence theory**: This theory, developed by Peter Salovey and John Mayer, focuses on emotional awareness and management. It is a type of intelligence rather than a developmental model.  
- **G: Primary mental ability theory**: Proposed by L.L. Thurstone, this theory identifies seven primary mental abilities. It is a structural theory, not a developmental one.  
- **H: Fluid and crystallized intelligence theory**: Raymond Cattell's theory distinguishes between fluid intelligence (processing speed, memory) and crystallized intelligence (knowledge, experience). It explains how these types of intelligence change over time, making it a developmental model.  
- **I: Investment theory**: This theory suggests that individuals "invest" in their abilities through practice and education, leading to developmental changes. It is a developmental model.  
- **J: Information processing theory**: This theory focuses on how information is processed (e.g., attention, memory). While it may touch on mechanisms of cognition, it is not specifically a developmental model.

From this analysis, the construct that is not pertinent to developmental models is **D: The positive manifold**, as it describes the structural correlation between cognitive abilities rather than explaining developmental changes over time.
