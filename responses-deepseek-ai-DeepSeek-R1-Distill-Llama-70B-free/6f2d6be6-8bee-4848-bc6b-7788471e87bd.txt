Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which nuclide has an NMR frequency of 115.5 MHz in a 20.0 T magnetic field. The options are from A to J, each a different isotope.

Hmm, I remember that NMR frequency depends on the magnetic field strength and the nucleus's properties. Oh right, the formula for the resonance frequency is something like frequency (ν) equals the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) multiplied by the magnetic field (B), right? So ν = γ * B.

Wait, but each nucleus has its own gyromagnetic ratio. I think γ is a constant for each specific isotope. So I need to find out which of the given nuclides has a γ that, when multiplied by 20 T, gives 115.5 MHz.

I should probably look up the gyromagnetic ratios for these isotopes. But wait, I don't have them all memorized. Maybe I can think of some common ones. Let me jot down what I remember.

For example, I know that 1H (proton) has a gyromagnetic ratio around 42.58 MHz/T. Oh wait, but the question isn't about protons. So for other nuclei, the γ values are different.

Let me think. For carbon-13, which is option E, I think the γ is about 10.705 MHz/T. Wait, no, wait. I might be mixing up some numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should think about fluorine. Fluorine-19, option D, I think has a γ close to 40 MHz/T. Let me see: if B is 20 T, then ν would be 40 *20=800 MHz, but the given ν is 115.5, which is much lower. So D can't be right.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the Larmor frequency equation: ν = (γ * B) / (2π), but wait, does that matter here? Because sometimes γ is given in terms of radians per second per tesla. Oh, right! Sometimes γ is given in terms of 2π times the frequency per tesla. So I need to be careful about units.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the resonance frequency formula. Another approach is to use the relation between the frequencies of different nuclei relative to a reference, like protons. But I'm not sure if that's the way to go.

Wait, I remember that for some common nuclei, the approximate frequencies in a certain magnetic field are known. For example, in a 1 T field, the Larmor frequency for proton is about 42.58 MHz. So in a 20 T field, protons would resonate at 42.58 * 20 ≈ 851.6 MHz. But the question isn't about protons.

So for each given nuclide, I need to find their γ and multiply by 20 T to see which gives 115.5 MHz.

Let me list the options and try to recall their γ values:

Option A: 17O (Oxygen-17). I think its γ is lower than 1H. Maybe around 5.8 MHz/T? So 5.8 *20=116 MHz. Wait, that's very close to 115.5. That would make sense. Hmm.

Option B: 29Si (Silicon-29). I think silicon's γ is lower. Maybe around 8.2 MHz/T. 8.2*20=164, which is higher than 115.5.

Option C: 31P (Phosphorus-31). I think its γ is around 17.25 MHz/T. 17.25 *20=345, which is way higher than 115.5.

Option D: 19F. As I thought before, maybe around 40 MHz/T. 40*20=800, which is too high.

Option E: 13C (Carbon-13). I believe its γ is about 10.7 MHz/T. So 10.7 *20=214. That's higher than 115.5.

Option F: 15N (Nitrogen-15). Its γ is lower than 14N. I think around 3.08 MHz/T. So 3.08 *20=61.6, which is too low.

Option G: 27Al (Aluminum-27). I'm not too sure, but I think its γ is around 26.45 MHz/T. 26.45 *20=529, way too high.

Option H: 33S (Sulfur-33). I'm not certain, but maybe around 3.26 MHz/T. 3.26*20≈65.2, too low.

Option I: 39K (Potassium-39). I think its γ is around 4.97 MHz/T. 4.97*20≈99.4, which is lower than 115.5.

Option J: 23Na (Sodium-23). Its γ is higher, maybe around 11.26 MHz/T. So 11.26 *20≈225.2, which is higher than 115.5.

Wait, but looking back at option A, 17O: I thought γ was 5.8 MHz/T. 5.8 *20=116, which is very close to 115.5. That's only a 0.5 difference, which might be due to rounding errors or perhaps my memory isn't exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the γ for 17O wrong. Let me double-check what I remember. Another thought: maybe the exact γ values. Let me think.

I recall that for 17O, the gyromagnetic ratio is approximately 5.773 MHz/T. So 5.773 *20=115.46 MHz, which is very close to the given 115.5. So that would make option A correct.

Let me make sure I'm not confusing any other options. Let's think again: 17O's γ is about 5.773. So 20 T times that gives roughly 115.46, which is 115.5. So option A, 17O.

Wait, but I thought option J is 23Na. Its γ is higher, around 11.26, so 225 MHz. So not the right one.

So the correct answer would be A: 17O.

To determine which nuclide has an NMR frequency of 115.5 MHz in a 20.0 T magnetic field, we use the relationship:

\[
\nu = \gamma \cdot B
\]

where \( \nu \) is the resonance frequency, \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio (in MHz/T), and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength (in T). The goal is to identify the nuclide whose gyromagnetic ratio, when multiplied by 20.0 T, gives approximately 115.5 MHz.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A: \( ^{17}\text{O} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{17}\text{O} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 5.773 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 5.773 \cdot 20.0 = 115.46 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is extremely close to the given frequency of 115.5 MHz, making this a strong candidate.

2. **Option B: \( ^{29}\text{Si} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{29}\text{Si} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 8.2 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 8.2 \cdot 20.0 = 164.0 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is much higher than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: \( ^{31}\text{P} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{31}\text{P} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 17.25 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 17.25 \cdot 20.0 = 345.0 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is far higher than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: \( ^{19}\text{F} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{19}\text{F} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 40.0 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 40.0 \cdot 20.0 = 800.0 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is much higher than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

5. **Option E: \( ^{13}\text{C} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{13}\text{C} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 10.7 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 10.7 \cdot 20.0 = 214.0 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is higher than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

6. **Option F: \( ^{15}\text{N} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{15}\text{N} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 3.08 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 3.08 \cdot 20.0 = 61.6 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is much lower than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

7. **Option G: \( ^{27}\text{Al} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{27}\text{Al} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 26.45 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 26.45 \cdot 20.0 = 529.0 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is far higher than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

8. **Option H: \( ^{33}\text{S} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{33}\text{S} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 3.26 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 3.26 \cdot 20.0 = 65.2 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is much lower than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

9. **Option I: \( ^{39}\text{K} \)**  
   The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{39}\text{K} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 4.97 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
   \[
   \nu = 4.97 \cdot 20.0 = 99.4 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   This is lower than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

10. **Option J: \( ^{23}\text{Na} \)**  
    The gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{23}\text{Na} \) is approximately \( \gamma = 11.26 \, \text{MHz/T} \).  
    \[
    \nu = 11.26 \cdot 20.0 = 225.2 \, \text{MHz}
    \]  
    This is higher than 115.5 MHz, so this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The nuclide \( ^{17}\text{O} \) (Option A) has a gyromagnetic ratio of approximately \( 5.773 \, \text{MHz/T} \), and when multiplied by the magnetic field strength of \( 20.0 \, \text{T} \), it gives a resonance frequency of \( 115.46 \, \text{MHz} \), which is extremely close to the given frequency of \( 115.5 \, \text{MHz} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A**
