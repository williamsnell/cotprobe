Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the volume of a cube. Hmm, I remember that the volume of a cube is calculated by taking the length of one edge and cubing it. Right, the formula is V = edgeÂ³. 

The question says each edge is 150.0 mm long. Wait, but the answer needs to be in cubic centimeters. Oh, right! I need to make sure the units match. I know that 1 centimeter is equal to 10 millimeters. So to convert millimeters to centimeters, I divide by 10. 

Let me do the unit conversion first. 150 mm divided by 10 is 15 cm. So each edge is 15 cm long. Now, plugging that into the volume formula: 15 cm multiplied by itself three times. Let me calculate that. 

15 * 15 is 225. Then, 225 * 15 again. Let me see, 225 times 10 is 2250, and 225 times 5 is 1125. Adding those together, 2250 + 1125 equals 3375. So the volume should be 3375 cubic centimeters. 

Looking at the options, option E is 3375 cc. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Oh yeah, 15 cubed is definitely 3375. Yep, I'm confident now.

The volume of a cube is calculated using the formula \( V = \text{edge}^3 \). The edge length given is 150.0 mm, which converts to 15.0 cm (since \( 1 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{mm} \)). Cubing 15.0 cm gives:

\[
15^3 = 15 \times 15 \times 15 = 3375 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the volume is 3375 cubic centimeters. The correct answer is:

E: 3375 cc
