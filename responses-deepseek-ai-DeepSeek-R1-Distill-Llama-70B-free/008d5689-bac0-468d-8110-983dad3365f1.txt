Question:

Which of the following is true about the assessment of arm reflexes?

Options:

A: The biceps reflex is not related to any root value

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about assessing arm reflexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my neurology, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which statement is true about the assessment of arm reflexes. The options are A through J, but looking at the given options, they're labeled A to I. I need to go through each option one by one.

Option A says the biceps reflex is not related to any root value. Wait, I remember that each reflex corresponds to specific nerve roots. Biceps reflex is usually C5 and C6. So if A says it's not related, that would be incorrect. So A is false.

Option B: Striking the Achilles tendon is used to assess arm reflexes. No, the Achilles is for the ankle reflex, which is part of the lower limbs. Arm reflexes are like biceps, triceps, etc. So B is false.

Option C: Brachioradialis reflex is assessed by tapping the bicep tendon. Wait, no. Brachioradialis reflex is tested by tapping the radius, like the forearm area, maybe near the wrist. Or wait, maybe the tendon is near the elbow? I might be mixing this up. Alternatively, the bicep tendon is for the bicep reflex. So C might be wrong because it's the wrong tendon.

Option D: An absent reflex when tapping a tendon is a normal finding. No, I think if a reflex is absent, that's usually abnormal. Unless it's a very subtle reflex or the patient is tense. But generally, absent reflexes indicate a problem, like nerve damage or something. So D is probably false.

Option E: The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa. Wait, the antecubital fossa is the area in front of the elbow, right? The triceps tendon is at the back of the elbow. So when testing the triceps reflex, you strike the tendon just above the olecranon, which is the bony part at the elbow. So E is false because it's in the wrong location.

Option F: The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6. I'm pretty sure that's right. Biceps jerk corresponds to the C5 and C6 nerve roots. So F seems correct.

Option G: Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neuron lesion. Wait, finger jerks are more about the reflexes in the hands. Brisk reflexes usually indicate an upper motor neuron lesion because of the loss of inhibition. Lower motor neuron issues would cause decreased or absent reflexes. So G is false.

Option H: Absence of reflex when tapping a tendon indicates a higher motor neuron lesion. No, absence would more likely be a lower motor neuron issue, like a peripheral nerve problem. Higher motor neuron lesions might cause increased reflexes (brisk) or other signs like spasticity. So H is false.

Option I: The root value of the triceps reflex is C5, C6. Wait, I thought the triceps reflex is C7. Because triceps is innervated by the radial nerve, which is C7. So I is false.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6.

The correct answer is F. The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6.
