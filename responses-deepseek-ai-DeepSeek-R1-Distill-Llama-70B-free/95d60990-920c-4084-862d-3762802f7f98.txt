Question:

Heteroscedasticity in a scattergram suggests that:

Options:

A: there is a restriction of range of scores on the predictor and/or the criterion.
B: the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor.
C: there is a statistically significant correlation between the predictor and criterion.
D: the predictor and criterion have a negative correlation.
E: there is a perfect correlation between the predictor and the criterion.
F: the predictor and criterion are independent of each other.
G: the relationship between the predictor and criterion cannot be described by a straight line.
H: the variability (range) of scores on the predictor is constant for all scores on the criterion.
I: the scores on the criterion are uniformly distributed across the range of the predictor.
J: the variability (range) of scores on the predictor varies for different scores on the criterion.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about heteroscedasticity in a scattergram. Hmm, I remember that heteroscedasticity has something to do with the spread of data points. Let me think about what I learned in stats class.

So, in a scatterplot, when you have a regression line, you're looking at how two variables relate. Homoscedasticity is when the variance of the dependent variable is consistent across all levels of the independent variable. So, the points are spread out evenly above and below the regression line. But heteroscedasticity is the opposite of that. It means the variance isn't constant; it changes.

Wait, so the question is asking what heteroscedasticity suggests. The options are about different aspects, like variability, correlation, etc. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Restriction of range on the predictor or criterion. I don't think that's it. Restriction of range affects correlations but isn't directly about variability across the predictor.

Option B: The variability of the criterion varies for different predictor scores. That sounds right. Because heteroscedasticity is when the spread of the criterion (y-axis) changes as the predictor (x-axis) changes. So as X increases, the spread of Y gets wider or narrower.

Option C: Statistically significant correlation. No, because heteroscedasticity doesn't tell us if the correlation is significant; it's about the variance.

Option D: Negative correlation. No, that's about direction, not variance.

Option E: Perfect correlation. If it were perfect, all points would be on a line, so variance would be zero, so no heteroscedasticity.

Option F: Predictor and criterion are independent. If they were independent, there'd be no correlation, but that doesn't mean heteroscedasticity, which is about variance.

Option G: Relationship isn't linear. Hmm, maybe, but heteroscedasticity can occur even with a linear relationship. It's more about the spread than the linearity.

Option H: Variability of predictor is constant for all criterion scores. Wait, the question is about criterion variability, not the predictor. So H is talking about the wrong variable.

Option I: Criterion scores are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution doesn't directly imply varying variance; it's more about the shape of the distribution.

Option J: Predictor variability varies for different criterion scores. Oh wait, no, because the question is about the criterion's variability changing with the predictor. J seems to reverse cause and effect.

So putting it all together, B says the criterion's variability varies with the predictor's scores. That matches what I know about heteroscedasticity. So the answer should be B.

Heteroscedasticity refers to the condition in which the variability of the dependent variable (criterion) changes across different levels of the independent variable (predictor). This is evident in a scattergram when the spread of the data points around the regression line is not consistent. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** refers to restriction of range, which is unrelated to heteroscedasticity.  
- **Option B** correctly describes heteroscedasticity, as it highlights that the variability of the criterion varies with different scores on the predictor.  
- **Option C** pertains to statistical significance, which is not directly related to heteroscedasticity.  
- **Option D** concerns the direction of correlation, not variability.  
- **Option E** describes a perfect correlation, which would result in zero variability, contradicting heteroscedasticity.  
- **Option F** refers to independence, which does not imply anything about variability.  
- **Option G** discusses non-linearity, but heteroscedasticity can occur with both linear and non-linear relationships.  
- **Option H** incorrectly focuses on the predictor's variability rather than the criterion's.  
- **Option I** refers to uniform distribution, which does not directly address varying variability.  
- **Option J** reverses the relationship, focusing on the predictor's variability instead of the criterion's.  

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as it accurately captures the essence of heteroscedasticity.
