Okay, so I've got this problem here where James Taggert wants to paint his storage room, and I need to figure out how much it'll cost him. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should find the dimensions of the room. The problem says the room is 14 feet by 10 feet by 8 and a half feet. So, that's length, width, and height. Wait, but when calculating the area to paint, I think we're only concerned with the walls, right? So the ceiling and floor might not be included unless stated otherwise. But the problem doesn't mention painting the ceiling or floor, so I'll focus on the walls.

Now, the walls are on four sides. Two of them are longer, and two are shorter. The formula for the area of each pair of walls would be 2 * height * (length + width). So I'll calculate that.

Let me jot down the numbers:

Length (L) = 14 ft

Width (W) = 10 ft

Height (H) = 8.5 ft (since 8 1/2 is 8.5)

So the total wall area is 2*(L + W)*H. Plugging the numbers in:

2*(14 + 10)*8.5 = 2*(24)*8.5 = 48 *8.5. Hmm, what's 48 times 8.5? Let me calculate that. 48 *8 is 384, and 48 *0.5 is 24, so total is 384 +24 = 408 square feet. So the walls have an area of 408 sq.ft.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Because sometimes when doing math in my head, I might make a mistake. So 14+10 is 24, times 8.5. 24 *8 is 192, 24*0.5 is 12, so 192+12=204. Then multiply by 2 because it's two walls each. Oh wait no, wait. Wait no, the formula is 2*(L + W)*H, so L + W is 24, multiplied by H (8.5) gives 204, then multiplied by 2 gives 408. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, I need to find out how much paint is needed. The problem states that one quart of paint covers 36 square feet. So I can calculate how many quarts are needed by dividing the total area by the coverage per quart.

So 408 sq.ft. divided by 36 sq.ft. per quart. Let's see: 36 times 11 is 396, which is 11 quarts, leaving 12 sq.ft. remaining. So 12/36 is 1/3 of a quart, so total would be 11 and 1/3 quarts. But wait, you can't buy a fraction of a quart, I think. So in terms of cost, you have to round up to the next whole number. So 11.333... quarts would mean he needs 12 quarts of paint.

Wait, but let me make sure. If 11 quarts cover 396 sq.ft., then 408 -396=12 sq.ft. left. Since each quart does 36, 12 is exactly 1/3 of a quart. So he would need 11 full quarts plus another one for the remaining, making it 12 quarts total. So yes, 12 quarts.

Now, the cost of the paint: each quart is $9.80. So 12 quarts would cost 12 *9.80. Let me calculate that. 10 quarts would be $98.00, and 2 quarts would be $19.60, so total is 98 +19.60= $117.60 for the paint.

Next, the labor cost. The problem says labor is $5 per quart or fraction thereof. So for each quart used, regardless of how much, they charge $5. So since he's using 12 quarts, the labor cost would be 12 *5 = $60.00.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So labor is $5 per quart or any fraction. So even if you use a fraction of a quart, you still get charged for the full quart. So in our case, he used 12 quarts, so labor is 12 *5=60. So total cost is paint cost plus labor.

So paint is $117.60, labor is $60. So total is 117.60 +60= $177.60.

Wait, but let me double-check all calculations.

Total wall area: 2*(14+10)*8.5 = 2*24*8.5=48*8.5=408 sq.ft. Correct.

Paint needed: 408/36=11.333... quarts. Since you can't buy a fraction, you need 12 quarts. So 12 quarts.

Paint cost: 12 *9.80=117.60. Correct.

Labor: 12 quarts *5=60. Correct.

Total: 117.60 +60=177.60.

Looking at the options, option D is $177.60. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the cost for James Taggert to paint his storage room, we start by calculating the total area of the walls. The room dimensions are 14' (length), 10' (width), and 8.5' (height). The formula for the total wall area is:

\[
\text{Total Wall Area} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \times \text{Height}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Wall Area} = 2 \times (14 + 10) \times 8.5 = 2 \times 24 \times 8.5 = 48 \times 8.5 = 408 \, \text{sq.ft.}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of paint needed. One quart of paint covers 36 sq.ft., so the number of quarts required is:

\[
\text{Quarts of Paint} = \frac{\text{Total Wall Area}}{\text{Coverage per Quart}} = \frac{408}{36} \approx 11.333 \, \text{quarts.}
\]

Since paint is sold in whole quarts, we round up to the next whole number, resulting in 12 quarts.

The cost of the paint is calculated as:

\[
\text{Paint Cost} = \text{Number of Quarts} \times \text{Cost per Quart} = 12 \times 9.80 = 117.60 \, \text{dollars.}
\]

The labor cost is $5 per quart or fraction thereof. Therefore, for 12 quarts, the labor cost is:

\[
\text{Labor Cost} = \text{Number of Quarts} \times 5 = 12 \times 5 = 60 \, \text{dollars.}
\]

Adding the paint cost and labor cost gives the total cost:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 117.60 + 60 = 177.60 \, \text{dollars.}
\]

Thus, the total cost for painting the room is **$177.60**, which corresponds to option **D**.
