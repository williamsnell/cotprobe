Question:

A contractor agreed to remodel a homeowner's garage for $5,000. Just before the parties signed the one-page written contract, the homeowner called to the contractor's attention the fact that the contract did not specify a time of completion. The parties orally agreed but did not specify in the contract that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days, and then they both signed the contract. The contract did not contain a merger clause. The contractor failed to finish the work in 60 days. The homeowner has sued the contractor for breach of contract. Is the court likely to admit evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement that the work would be completed in 60 days?

Options:

A: No, because the oral agreement contradicts the written contract.
B: Yes, because the homeowner brought up the time limit before signing the contract.
C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.
D: Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.
E: No, because the oral agreement is considered hearsay.
F: No, because the contract is a fully integrated written contract.
G: Yes, because the court can consider oral agreements in absence of a merger clause.
H: No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.
I: Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.
J: No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that a contractor and a homeowner have a written contract to remodel a garage for $5,000. Just before signing, the homeowner points out that the contract doesn't specify a completion time. They orally agree that the contractor will finish in 60 days but don't include this in the written contract. The contract also doesn't have a merger clause. Then, the contractor doesn't finish on time, and the homeowner sues for breach. The question is whether the court will admit evidence of their oral agreement about the 60-day completion.

Hmm, I remember that when a written contract exists, there's the parol evidence rule. From what I recall, the parol evidence rule generally says that prior or contemporaneous negotiations or agreements that aren't included in the written contract can't be used to contradict the terms of the written contract if the contract is fully integrated. But there are exceptions, like if the agreement is a separate oral agreement that doesn't contradict the written one.

Wait, in this case, the oral agreement was made right before signing the contract. So it's contemporaneous. The written contract doesn't mention the time frame, so the oral agreement is about an additional term, not contradicting the written contract. Also, since there's no merger clause, the contract isn't necessarily fully integrated.

I think about the types of integration. If a contract is fully integrated, it means the parties intended it to be the final and complete agreement, so prior or contemporaneous agreements can't be used. But if it's only partially integrated, then other terms can exist alongside it.

So in this case, the written contract doesn't cover the time of completion, which the oral agreement does. So the oral agreement is an additional term. Since there's no merger clause, the court might consider the contract partially integrated, allowing the oral evidence to be admitted.

Looking at the options:

Option D says yes because the time limit is an additional term that doesn't contradict the partially integrated contract. That makes sense because the written contract didn't include the time, so the oral agreement adds to it without conflicting.

Option F says no because it's fully integrated. But without a merger clause, it's not necessarily fully integrated. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says yes because without a merger clause, oral agreements can be considered. That's another possible correct answer. Wait, but even without a merger clause, if the contract is fully integrated by its terms, the parol evidence rule still applies. But here, the contract is one page and doesn't cover all terms, so maybe it's partially integrated.

Option A says no because the oral agreement contradicts the written contract. But since the written contract doesn't mention the time, there's no contradiction. So A is wrong.

Option B says yes because the homeowner brought it up before signing. That's a factor, but maybe not the main point. The key is whether the contract is fully integrated.

Option C says yes because the homeowner can provide evidence. But that's too simplistic; it's about the admissibility under the parol evidence rule.

Option E says no because it's hearsay. But the oral agreement isn't being offered for the truth of the matter asserted; it's to prove the agreement itself. So hearsay might not be the right reason here.

Option H says no because the court must look at the written contract. But if the written contract doesn't include that term, the oral can be used to supplement it.

Option I says yes because the contract is ambiguous. There's no indication that the written contract is ambiguous about other terms. The time isn't in there, so maybe it's not ambiguous.

Option J says no because it was part of negotiations. But if it was a contemporaneous agreement, not just negotiation, it's different.

So, putting it together. The contract is likely partially integrated because it doesn't include all terms (no time specified), and there's no merger clause. Therefore, the oral agreement can be admitted as it's an additional term. So the correct answer would be D or G.

Wait, D says it's an additional term that doesn't contradict the partially integrated contract. That fits because the written contract didn't include the time frame, so the oral adds to it.

G says yes because without a merger clause, the court can consider oral agreements. But the absence of a merger clause doesn't automatically mean it's not fully integrated. It depends on whether the contract appears to be a complete agreement. Here, since it's a one-page contract that didn't include the time, it's probably partially integrated.

So I think the best answer is D.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding an oral agreement about a completion timeline in a contract that was not included in the written contract. The key issue is whether the parol evidence rule applies, which generally prohibits the introduction of prior or contemporaneous agreements that contradict a fully integrated written contract. However, if the contract is only partially integrated, additional terms from oral agreements can be admitted without violating the rule.

In this case, the written contract does not mention the time of completion, and there is no merger clause, which suggests that the contract may be partially integrated. The oral agreement about the 60-day completion timeline does not contradict the written contract but rather adds an additional term. Courts are more likely to admit such evidence when the written contract is silent on the issue and there is no indication that the parties intended the written contract to be the complete and final agreement.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly states that the oral agreement is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract. This aligns with the scenario where the written contract is silent on the completion time, making the oral agreement admissible.
- Other options, such as **Option F**, incorrectly assume the contract is fully integrated without sufficient basis, as the absence of a merger clause and the omission of the time frame suggest partial integration. Similarly, **Option G** is less precise, as the absence of a merger clause alone does not automatically allow oral evidence unless the contract is partially integrated.

Thus, the most accurate answer is **D**, as it reflects the correct application of the parol evidence rule to a partially integrated contract.

Answer: D
