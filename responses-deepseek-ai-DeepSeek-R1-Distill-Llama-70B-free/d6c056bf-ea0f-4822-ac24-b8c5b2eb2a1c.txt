Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about longitudinal studies on children with specific reading disabilities. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what these studies show. The options are A through J, each making a different claim. I'll need to evaluate each option based on what I know or can infer.

First, I remember that specific reading disabilities often refer to dyslexia. Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that can cause problems with reading, writing, and spelling. It's not related to intelligence, so that might help with some options.

Let's go through each option:

A: These children usually have a high level of social skills. Hmm, I don't think that's necessarily true. Dyslexia affects reading, not social skills. Some might have high social skills, but it's not a given. I don't recall studies showing that as a common outcome.

B: These children usually have above-average IQ levels. Wait, I thought that dyslexia can occur across all IQ levels. Some people with dyslexia might have high IQs, but it's not a usual thing. So this might not be the right answer.

C: The reading impairments are usually accompanied by a high vocabulary level. I'm not sure. Vocabulary can sometimes be a strength, especially if they have good oral language skills, but I think it's more about the decoding. Maybe not; I'm a bit confused here.

D: These children usually have subtle hearing disorders. I don't think that's correct. Hearing issues are more related to speech and language disorders, not specifically reading disabilities. Unless it's something like auditory processing, but I'm not sure if that's common.

E: These children usually excel in artistic activities. That sounds familiar. I've heard that people with dyslexia often have strengths in creative areas like art. But is this a consistent finding in longitudinal studies? I'm not certain, but it might be a possibility.

F: These children usually excel in sports. I don't know about that. Sports involve different skills, and while some might excel, it's not a universal trait tied to reading disabilities. So probably not the answer.

G: The reading impairments usually improve significantly with age. I think this is a myth. From what I've read, dyslexia is a lifelong condition. While coping strategies can help, the impairment itself doesn't just go away. So this option is likely incorrect.

H: The reading impairments are usually accompanied by a low vocabulary level. Wait, earlier I thought maybe vocabulary could be okay, especially if they have good verbal skills. But if they struggle with reading, maybe their vocabulary isn't as high because they don't read as much. So this could be possible. But I'm not entirely sure.

I: These children usually have exceptional mathematical skills. I don't think that's accurate. Some might, but it's not typical. Dyscalculia is a separate issue, and having one doesn't necessarily mean the other.

J: Reading skills usually do not reach normal levels as these children reach adulthood. This aligns with what I know about dyslexia. It's a persistent condition, so even as adults, their reading might not be at the same level as their peers without the disability.

So looking back, the options that seem plausible are E, H, and J. 

Wait, let me think again. Option J says that reading skills don't reach normal levels in adulthood. That fits with what I remember from studies. Many people with dyslexia learn to cope, but their reading fluency may still lag.

Option H says low vocabulary. If a child can't read well, they might not have as much exposure to new words through reading, which could affect their vocabulary. But sometimes, if they have good oral language skills, their vocabulary might still be okay. So I'm a bit torn here.

Option E about artistic activities. It's a common stereotype that dyslexics excel in art. While some do, I'm not sure if studies show that this is usually the case. It might not be a consistent finding across all longitudinal studies.

So putting it together, the correct answer is likely J. Also, the question specifies "longitudinal studies," which track the same individuals over time. So they would show that reading difficulties persist into adulthood, which supports option J.

Longitudinal studies of children with specific reading disabilities, such as dyslexia, reveal that these difficulties are persistent and do not typically resolve with age. While some individuals may develop coping strategies, their reading skills often remain below the level of their peers without the condition. This aligns with the understanding that dyslexia is a lifelong condition. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, F, I**: These options make claims about social skills, IQ levels, hearing disorders, sports excellence, or mathematical skills, which are not consistently supported by research on reading disabilities.
- **C, E, H**: While some individuals with dyslexia may have high vocabulary levels or excel in artistic activities, these are not universal findings. Vocabulary levels can vary, and artistic excellence is more of a stereotype than a consistent outcome.
- **G**: The idea that reading impairments improve significantly with age is incorrect, as dyslexia persists into adulthood.
- **J**: This option accurately reflects the longitudinal findings that reading skills in individuals with specific reading disabilities typically do not reach normal levels as they reach adulthood.

Thus, the most accurate answer is:

J: Reading skills usually do not reach normal levels as these children reach adulthood.

Answer: J
