Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about corn and a testcross. Hmm, testcrosses are usually used to determine the genotype of an individual, right? And in this case, the genes involved are fine stripe (f), bronze aleurone (bz), and knotted leaf (Kn). I need to figure out the sequence of these genes, the recombination amounts between each pair, and the coefficient of coincidence. 

Let me start by looking at the data provided. The phenotypes and their numbers are as follows:

- Kn + + : 451
- Kn f + :134
- + + + :97
- + f bz :436
- Kn + bz :18
- + + bz :119
- + f + :24
- Kn f bz :86
- Total: 1,365.

Wait, so the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these three genes. Since it's a testcross, I'm assuming the other parent is homozygous recessive for all three genes, so the gametes are all possible combinations from the testcross parent. 

The phenotypic ratios can help determine the genotype of the testcross parent. The testcross parent would produce gametes that are recombinant or non-recombinant, depending on how the genes are linked. The most frequent phenotypic class is Kn + + with 451, which is probably the parental (non-recombinant) type. But wait, actually, the largest number might indicate the parental arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the most frequent phenotypic classes indicate the arrangement.

Wait, actually, in a testcross, the phenotypic ratio will reflect the gamete types. So the number of each phenotype corresponds to the gamete proportions.

But wait, in a three-point testcross, the double recombinants are the least frequent, so those would help in figuring out the gene order. Because double recombinants are less likely than single recombinants.

Let me list out all the phenotypic classes and their counts:

1. Kn + + : 451
2. Kn f + :134
3. + + + :97
4. + f bz :436
5. Kn + bz :18
6. + + bz :119
7. + f + :24
8. Kn f bz :86

Wait, are the phenotypes labeled correctly? Each phenotype is for the three genes in order f, bz, Kn? Or is it Kn, f, bz? I think the notation is the order of genes as in the question: genes for f, bz, Kn are involved. So the phenotypes are written as Kn (first), then f, then bz. Or is it the order of the traits in the phenotype? Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the way the phenotypes are written: the first symbol is Kn, the second is f, and the third is bz. So the order of the traits in the phenotype is Kn, f, bz. So each phenotype is Kn, then f, then bz. For example, Kn + + would mean Kn is present (dominant?), f is recessive, and bz is recessive.

Assuming that '+' represents the dominant allele and the absence (like lowercase) represents recessive, but wait, the options use '+' as wild type or dominant. So the phenotypes are written as Kn (dominant, say 'Kn') vs recessive (kn, written as '+'), but wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the '+' denotes the presence of the dominant allele, and the lowercase letters denote the recessive phenotypes. Wait, no, that's confusing. Let me think again: each gene has two alleles, dominant and recessive. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele (like Kn) would show its phenotype, while recessive would show another.

Wait, the way the phenotypes are written, the letters represent the dominant traits. So, for example, 'Kn' stands for the dominant (knotted leaf), and '+' could be the recessive (no knotted leaf, maybe 'kn'). Similarly, 'f' is dominant for fine stripe, 'bz' for bronze. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe the '+' is just a placeholder for the recessive. So, for each gene, the dominant allele is given as the letter, and '+' represents the recessive.

So the phenotypic classes are:

1. Kn + + : Kn is dominant, f and bz are recessive.
2. Kn f + : Kn and f dominant, bz recessive.
3. + + + : All recessive.
4. + f bz : f and bz dominant, Kn recessive.
5. Kn + bz : Kn and bz dominant, f recessive.
6. + + bz : Only bz dominant.
7. + f + : Only f dominant.
8. Kn f bz : All three dominant.

Wait, but in a testcross, the other parent is homozygous recessive, so the possible gametes from the testcross parent would be all possible combinations of their alleles. 

The highest numbers are likely the parental types, and the lower numbers the recombinants. But I'm not sure. Let's see.

Looking at the numbers:

- The largest is Kn + + with 451.
- Then + f bz with 436.
These two seem to be the most abundant. Then, the next is Kn f + with 134, followed by + + + at 97. So perhaps these are the parental types.

Wait, but wait: in a three-point testcross, the four parental (non-recombinant) gametes would be the most frequent. But in this case, the four phenotypes with the highest counts are 451, 436, 134, and 97. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the two most frequent are the two parental types, and the next are the single recombinants, and the smallest are the double recombinants. 

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. In a testcross, the F1 is crossed with the recessive parent. The F1 would have alleles arranged as, say, AB/ab (simplified two-point for a moment), so the gametes would be AB, Ab, aB, ab. The testcross would produce AB (25%), Ab (25%), aB (25%), ab (25%) if the genes are unlinked. But if they're linked, the parental gametes (AB and ab) would be more frequent than the recombinant (Ab and aB). So, in this case, with three genes, the parental types would be the non-recombinant gametes.

But with three genes, the possible gametes are 2^3=8 types. The non-recombinant (parental) gametes would be the ones that didn't undergo any crossing over. So, for example, if the arrangement is Kn - f - bz, then the parental gametes would be all Kn f bz and kn f bz (assuming the testcross parent is, say, Kn f bz / kn f bz). Wait, no, that's if it's homozygous.

Wait, no, the testcross parent is likely heterozygous for all three genes. So, for instance, if the genotype is Kn f bz / kn + +, or some arrangement. Wait, perhaps the testcross parent is a trihybrid, like Kn f bz / kn + +, but that's not possible because each gene has two alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the testcross parent is a trihybrid in a linkage arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the testcross parent is of genotype Kn f bz / kn + +, but that doesn't make sense because each gene has two alleles. Wait, maybe the testcross parent is in a cis or trans configuration.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by determining which phenotypes are the double recombinants, as they are the least frequent.

Looking at the counts:

The smallest numbers are 18, 24, 86 (though 86 isn't that small), and 119. Wait, 18 is very small. Let's list them in order:

1. 451 (Kn++)
2. 436 (+fbz)
3. 134 (Kn f +)
4. 119 (+ + bz)
5. 97 (+ + +)
6. 86 (Kn f bz)
7. 24 (+f +)
8. 18 (Kn + bz)

So the two smallest are 18 and 24, and 86 is also on the lower side. So perhaps 18 and 24 are double recombinants, while 86 is a single recombinant.

Wait, but in a three-point testcross, there are two double recombinant phenotypes. So the two with the smallest counts are likely the double recombinants. So 18 and 24 would be the double recombinants. 

Wait, 18 is Kn + bz. So Kn and bz are dominant, but f is recessive. And 24 is + f +, which is only f dominant. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the double recombinants are 18 (Kn + bz) and 24 (+f +). Because their counts are the lowest.

Wait, but 86 is Kn f bz, which is all dominant. That might be a single recombinant? Or maybe a parental.

Alternatively, perhaps the two largest phenotypes are the parental types, and the next are the single recombinants, and the smallest are the double recombinants.

So the two largest are 451 (Kn++) and 436 (+fbz). So perhaps these are the two parental types. So their combination would indicate the arrangement.

If the parental gametes are Kn++ and +fbz, that suggests that the two parental chromosomes are Kn f bz and kn f bz. Wait, no. Let me think: each gamete would have all three genes. So the parental gametes are Kn f bz and kn + +, perhaps? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, no, the testcross parent would produce gametes that are either parental (non-recombinant) or recombinant. So if the two parental gametes are, say, Kn f bz and kn + +, then the testcross would produce phenotypic classes with these combinations and others due to recombination.

Wait, but the counts for the phenotypes would be determined by how often each gamete is produced. The higher the count, the more frequent the gamete.

The two highest counts are 451 (Kn++) and 436 (+fbz). So these are likely the two most frequent gametes, i.e., the parental types. That would suggest that the testcross parent's gametes are mostly of these two types, and others are recombinant.

So the parental gametes are Kn++ and +fbz. Wait, but that can't be. Because if a parent produces gametes Kn++ and +fbz, that would imply that the alleles are arranged in a way that on one chromosome, Kn is present and f and bz are recessive; on the other chromosome, f and bz are dominant, and Kn is recessive. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the two parental gametes are Kn f bz and something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the possible arrangement.

Let me think that the two parental gametes are AB_ and _ab. Wait, maybe it's better to approach this by considering the possible gene order.

In a three-point mapping, the gene order can be determined by identifying which of the single recombinant classes are more frequent. The double recombinants are the least frequent, so the gene order is determined based on which two single recombinants are adjacent.

So first, I need to identify which phenotypic classes are the double recombinants. Those would have the lowest counts.

Looking at the counts:

18 (Kn + bz) and 24 (+f +) are the smallest, so they are likely the double recombinants. The next smallest is 86 (Kn f bz), then 119 (+ + bz), 97 (+ + +), 134 (Kn f +), and the two largest are 451 and 436.

Wait, but 86 isn't that small. Let me think again. If 18 and 24 are the double recombinants, then the genes must be arranged such that those two classes require two crossovers.

Wait, maybe the gene order is Kn, f, bz. Let's test that.

If the order is Kn - f - bz.

In this case, the parental gametes would be Kn f bz and kn + +, perhaps.

Wait, but that might not explain the parental phenotypes. Alternatively, the two parental gametes would be those that have all dominant or all recessive alleles, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the two parental gametes are Kn + + (451) and + f bz (436). So the testcross parent has one chromosome with Kn and the other two recessive, and another chromosome with f and bz dominant and Kn recessive.

So the arrangement would be that Kn is on one end, and f and bz are on the other, but not linked. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then Kn and f, and f and bz would be linked.

Wait, maybe the testcross parent is arranged as Kn - f - bz on one chromosome and the recessive alleles on the other. So the parental gametes would be Kn f bz and kn + +. But that would mean the testcross phenotypes would be:

Kn f bz (from gamete Kn f bz)
Kn f + (recombinant between f and bz)
Kn + bz (recombinant between Kn and f)
kn + + (from gamete kn + +)
and others as recombinants.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck and should approach this differently. Let me list all the gametes and see.

The possible gametes from the testcross parent would be all combinations of the alleles for the three genes. The number of each gamete type depends on recombination events.

The phenotypic classes are:

1. Kn + + : 451
2. Kn f + :134
3. + + + :97
4. + f bz :436
5. Kn + bz :18
6. + + bz :119
7. + f + :24
8. Kn f bz :86

So, the gamete types are:

- Kn + + : 451
- Kn f + :134
- + + + :97
- + f bz :436
- Kn + bz :18
- + + bz :119
- + f + :24
- Kn f bz :86

Wait, but the gamete types are determined by the combination of alleles. The testcross parent must produce these gametes, and their frequencies give clues about which are parental and which are recombinant.

The two most frequent gametes are Kn + + (451) and + f bz (436). So these are likely the parental (non-recombinant) gametes. All other gametes are recombinant.

So, the parental arrangement is such that one chromosome has Kn and the recessive alleles for f and bz, and the other has the dominant alleles for f and bz and recessive for Kn.

Wait, but that would mean the two parental chromosomes are arranged as:

Parental 1: Kn f bz? No, because the gametes would be Kn + + and + f bz. Wait, that suggests that the arrangement on the two homologs is:

One homolog has Kn, and the other has f and bz dominant.

Wait, perhaps the testcross parent is Kn f bz / kn + +. No, that can't be because then the gametes would be Kn f bz and kn + +, but the other gametes would be recombinants between these two. But the observed gametes include all possible combinations, so perhaps the arrangement is different.

Wait, perhaps the parent is arranged as Kn + + / + f bz. But that would mean that the two homologs are: one with Kn and recessive f and bz, and the other with dominant f and bz but recessive Kn. So, the two homologs are:

Homolog 1: Kn F BZ

Homolog 2: kn f bz

Wait, that might not fit. Because then the parental gametes would be Kn F BZ and kn f bz. But in the data, the gametes are Kn + +, which would correspond to Kn f bz? No, perhaps I'm getting the alleles wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement is such that on one chromosome, the alleles are Kn, f, bz, and on the other, they're +, +, +. But that would make all the gametes Kn f bz and + + +, which isn't the case here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible gene orders.

The possible gene orders are:

1. Kn - f - bz
2. f - Kn - bz
3. f - bz - Kn
4. bz - f - Kn
5. bz - Kn - f
6. Kn - bz - f

Wait, but to find the correct order, I can look for the two phenotypes that are the double recombinants, as I thought earlier. The double recombinants would have recombined in both intervals, meaning they would be the least frequent.

In the data, the two smallest counts are 18 (Kn + bz) and 24 (+f +). So these are the double recombinants. So the gene order must be such that these two phenotypes require two crossovers.

Let me assume that the gene order is Kn - f - bz.

In this arrangement, the parental gametes would be Kn f bz and kn + +.

Wait, but the observed parental gametes are Kn + + and + f bz. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene order is f - Kn - bz.

In this case, the parental gametes would be f Kn bz and + + +. But in the data, the two most frequent are Kn++ and +fbz, which would be f + + and Kn f bz. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should construct a Punnett square based on possible gene orders. Let's try gene order Kn - f - bz.

If the testcross parent is Kn f bz / kn + +, then the gametes would be:

Non-recombinant: Kn f bz and kn + +.

Recombinant between Kn and f: Kn + bz and kn f +.

Recombinant between f and bz: Kn f + and kn + bz.

Double recombinant: Kn + + and kn f bz.

Wait, but the observed data has Kn + + as the highest, and + f bz as the second highest. So perhaps the parental gametes are Kn + + and + f bz, which would correspond to the double recombinant in this arrangement. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the double recombinants should be the least frequent.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene order is f - bz - Kn.

If the testcross parent is f bz Kn / + + +, then the gametes would be f bz Kn and + + + (parental), and the recombinants would be f + Kn, + bz Kn, etc. But I'm not sure how
