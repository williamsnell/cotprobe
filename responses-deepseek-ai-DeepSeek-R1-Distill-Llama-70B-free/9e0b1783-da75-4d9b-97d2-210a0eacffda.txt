Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to figure out the correct translation of the sentence "Holly loves Frances" into predicate logic. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in predicate logic, we use predicates to represent relations or actions. In this case, the predicate is Lxy, which stands for "x loves y." So, the structure is that the first variable is the one doing the loving, and the second is the one being loved.

The sentence given is "Holly loves Frances." So, Holly is the subject performing the action, and Frances is the object receiving the action. That means Holly is the first argument, and Frances is the second.

Now, looking at the variables provided: h stands for Holly, and f stands for Frances. So I need to plug these into the predicate Lxy. That would make it L(h, f), or in the notation used here, Lhf.

Let me look at the options again to make sure. Option A is Lhf, which fits exactly what I just thought. Option D is Lfh, which would mean Frances loves Holly, which is the opposite. So D is incorrect. Similarly, other options either use the wrong order or have extra letters that don't make sense here. For example, option I is fLh, which might be written as Lfh, again reversing the order.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the notation. Sometimes in logic, the order matters a lot. The predicate Lxy is x loves y, so the first letter after L is x, the lover, and the second is y, the beloved. So in this case, x is Holly (h), and y is Frances (f). So the correct formula should be L followed by h then f, which is Lhf.

Looking back at the options, A is Lhf, which matches. I think that's the right choice. All other options either have the arguments in the wrong order or include extra terms that aren't needed here.

The sentence "Holly loves Frances" translates into predicate logic using the predicate Lxy, where x is the lover and y is the beloved. Here, Holly (h) is the lover, and Frances (f) is the beloved. Therefore, the correct translation is Lhf, which corresponds to option A.
