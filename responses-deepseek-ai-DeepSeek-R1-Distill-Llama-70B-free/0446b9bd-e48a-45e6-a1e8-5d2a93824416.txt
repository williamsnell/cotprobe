Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these statements is true. The question is about the product of two numbers and whether it's odd or even, based on the factors. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, I remember that when you multiply two numbers, the result is even if at least one of the numbers is even. Only when both numbers are odd will the product be odd. So that's the rule I'll use to check each statement.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: 7 x 5 is odd because both factors are even.
Wait, 7 and 5 are both odd, not even. So the product would be odd, but the reason given is incorrect because the factors aren't even. So A is wrong.

Option B: 3 x 3 is odd because one factor is odd.
Hmm, 3 and 3 are both odd, so their product is 9, which is odd. But the statement says because one is odd. Wait, actually, both are odd, so saying one is odd isn't the full reason. Because if one is odd and the other is even, the product would be even. So in this case, the reason is incorrect. The product is odd because both are odd, not because one is. So B is wrong.

Option C: 5 x 2 is even because both factors are even.
5 is odd, 2 is even. The product is 10, which is even. But the statement says both are even, which isn't true because 5 is odd. So C is wrong.

Option D: 6 x 2 is odd because one of the factors is odd.
6 times 2 is 12, which is even. The statement says it's odd, so that's incorrect. Also, both factors are even (6 and 2), so the reason is wrong. D is wrong.

Option E: 2 x 2 is odd because both factors are even.
2 times 2 is 4, which is even. So the product is even, but the statement says it's odd. So E is wrong.

Option F: 2 x 7 is even because both factors are odd.
2 is even, 7 is odd. The product is 14, which is even. The statement says both are odd, which is false because 2 is even. So F is wrong.

Option G: 8 x 4 is even because one of the factors is odd.
8 and 4 are both even. The product is 32, even. But the statement says because one is odd, which isn't true. So G is wrong.

Option H: 4 x 4 is odd because both factors are even.
4x4 is 16, even. So the product is even, but the statement says it's odd. So H is wrong.

Option I: 5 x 3 is odd because both factors are odd.
5 and 3 are both odd. Their product is 15, which is odd. The statement correctly identifies that both are odd, so the product is odd. So I seems correct.

Option J: 3 x 7 is even because both factors are odd.
3 and 7 are both odd; their product is 21, which is odd, not even. So J is incorrect.

So the only correct statement is I.

The correct answer is I because both factors are odd, resulting in an odd product.
