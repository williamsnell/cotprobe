Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about estimating the PE ratio for a firm. Hmm, I remember that PE ratio is price-to-earnings, which is a common valuation metric. But I need to figure out how to calculate it based on the given parameters.

Let me look at the problem again. The firm has high growth for five years with a 25% growth rate. The payout ratio during these five years is 20%. After five years, the growth drops to 8%, and the payout ratio increases to 50%. The beta is 1.0, the risk-free rate is 6%, and the cost of equity is 11.5%. The risk premium is given as 5.5%, but I think that's already factored into the cost of equity calculation.

Wait, so how do I approach this? I think I need to use the discounted cash flow (DCF) model, specifically the two-stage model since there are two periods of growth.

First, I should calculate the required rate of return, which is the cost of equity here. It's given as 11.5%, so that's settled.

Next, I need to find the dividends for each of the first five years and then the dividends in year 5 and beyond. Oh wait, but wait—since the payout ratio changes after five years, I need to calculate the dividends for each stage.

Wait, but to get the PE ratio, I might need to find the stock price and then divide by the earnings. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates these factors directly to the PE ratio without calculating the full DCF.

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Oh right, there's the discounted dividend model, which can be used here.

In the first stage (first five years), the firm is in a high-growth phase with a growth rate of 25% and a payout ratio of 20%. So each year, it pays out 20% of its earnings as dividends, retaining 80% which drives the growth.

After five years, the growth rate drops to 8%, which is a stable, perpetual growth rate. The payout ratio then becomes 50%, so the firm pays out half its earnings as dividends and retains the other half.

Wait, but for the PE ratio, I think I need to find the price at a certain point in time. Typically, the PE ratio is based on the current price and current earnings. But since the question doesn't specify, I think the assumption is to calculate the PE ratio using the current earnings and the current stock price, which is calculated using the DCF model.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the dividends for each of the first five years.
2. Find the terminal value at the end of year five, which is the value of all dividends from year six to infinity.
3. Discount all these cash flows back to the present to find the current stock price.
4. Once I have the stock price and the current earnings (E), the PE ratio is simply Price/E.

But wait, I don't have the current earnings (E0) provided. Hmm, that's a problem. How do I proceed without E0?

Alternatively, maybe I can express the PE ratio in terms of the payout ratio and the required rate of return, considering the growth phases. Oh, right, the PE ratio can be thought of as the present value of future dividends divided by current earnings. Or wait, maybe it's the price divided by next year's earnings. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should model the earnings and dividends for each year, sum them up with their present values, and then find the PE ratio based on that.

Let me make some assumptions. Let's assume that the current earnings per share (E0) is some value, say $1, because the actual value might cancel out when calculating the ratio. Alternatively, maybe it's E1 that we use for PE ratio.

Wait, the PE ratio is typically (Price per share) / (Earnings per share). The earnings per share used is usually the latest available, which would be E0, but sometimes it's based on next year's earnings (E1). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps in this case, since we're looking to the future, it's E1.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use a specific formula that relates the PE ratio directly without needing E0.

Wait, another approach: the PE ratio can be calculated as (P0) / (E0), where P0 is the current stock price and E0 is current earnings.

So to find P0, I need to compute the present value of all future dividends.

Let's outline the steps.

Step 1: Determine the dividends for each of the first five years.

Since the payout ratio in the first five years is 20%, the dividend each year is 0.20 * E. But we don't know E0. Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe I can express everything in terms of E0.

Wait, I can model the growth in earnings. So E1 = E0 * (1 + growth rate) = E0 * 1.25.

Similarly, E2 = E1 * 1.25 = E0 * (1.25)^2, and so on.

Dividends in each year would be payout ratio * E. So D1 = 0.20 * E1 = 0.20 * E0 * 1.25.

Similarly, D2 = 0.20 * E2 = 0.20 * E0 * (1.25)^2.

And so on until D5 = 0.20 * E0 * (1.25)^5.

After year 5, the growth rate drops to 8%, and the payout ratio is 50%. So in year 6, the dividend is 0.50 * E6.

But E6 would be E5 * (1 + 8%) = E0*(1.25)^5 * 1.08.

So D6 = 0.50 * E0 * (1.25)^5 * 1.08.

Wait, but E5 is E0*(1.25)^5. Then, E6 = E5 * 1.08 = E0*(1.25)^5 * 1.08.

The terminal value at year 5 is the present value of all dividends from year 6 onwards. This is a growing perpetuity, so the formula is D6 / (r - g), where r is the required return and g is the perpetual growth rate.

So terminal value at year 5 (TV5) = D6 / (r - g) = [0.50 * E0 * (1.25)^5 * 1.08] / (0.115 - 0.08) = [0.50 * E0 * (1.25)^5 * 1.08] / 0.035.

But wait, we have to discount this terminal value back to the present. So the present value of TV5 is TV5 / (1 + r)^5.

Putting it all together, the current stock price P0 is the sum of the present value of the dividends for the first five years plus the present value of the terminal value.

So,

P0 = sum from t=1 to 5 of [D_t / (1 + r)^t] + TV5 / (1 + r)^5.

Now, each D_t is 0.20 * E0 * (1.25)^(t), so each term is [0.20 E0 (1.25)^t ] / (1.115)^t.

Wait, because the denominator is (1 + 0.115)^t.

So, simplifying each term:

D_t/(1.115)^t = 0.20 E0 (1.25/1.115)^t.

So the sum becomes 0.20 E0 * sum from t=1 to 5 of (1.25/1.115)^t.

Then, the terminal value part: TV5 is [0.50 E0 (1.25)^5 * 1.08 ] / 0.035.

But then, TV5 is in year 5 dollars, so we discount it back 5 years: TV5 / (1.115)^5 = [0.50 E0 (1.25)^5 * 1.08 / 0.035 ] / (1.115)^5.

Which simplifies to [0.50 E0 * 1.08 / 0.035 ] * [ (1.25)^5 / (1.115)^5 ) ].

Wait, because (1.25)^5 in numerator and (1.115)^5 in denominator from both the TV5 and the discounting factor.

So combining, P0 can be written as:

P0 = 0.20 E0 sum_{t=1 to5} (1.25/1.115)^t + [0.50 *1.08/(0.035)] E0 * [ (1.25/1.115)^5 ].

Now, let's compute the sum and the other terms.

First, let's compute (1.25/1.115). Let me calculate that.

1.25 divided by 1.115. Let's see:

1.115 is approximately 1.115.

1.25 / 1.115 ≈ 1.1205.

Wait, let me compute 1.25 ÷ 1.115.

1.115 × 1.12 = 1.115 * 1.12.

1.115 * 1 = 1.115.

1.115 * 0.12 = 0.1338.

Total is 1.2488. Hmm, which is just under 1.25. So 1.12 gives 1.2488, very close to 1.25. So 1.12 is about right.

So (1.25/1.115) ≈ 1.12.

Now, sum = sum_{t=1 to 5} (1.12)^t.

That's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from t=1 to n is a*(r^(n) -1)/(r-1), where a is the first term.

Wait, actually, the formula for sum from t=1 to n of r^t is r*(r^n - 1)/(r-1).

So here, r=1.12, n=5.

So sum = 1.12*(1.12^5 -1)/(1.12 -1).

Compute 1.12^5: Let's see. 1.12^1=1.12; 1.12^2=1.2544; 1.12^3≈1.4049; 1.12^4≈1.5735; 1.12^5≈1.7623.

So sum = 1.12*(1.7623 -1)/(0.12) ) = 1.12*(0.7623)/(0.12).

0.7623/0.12 ≈6.3525. Multiply by 1.12: ≈7.1148.

So the sum is approximately 7.1148.

So first part: 0.20 E0 * 7.1148 ≈ 1.42296 E0.

Now, the second part: [0.50 * 1.08 / 0.035 ] * [ (1.25/1.115)^5 ].

Compute each part:

0.50 *1.08 =0.54.

0.54 / 0.035 ≈15.4286.

Now, (1.25/1.115)^5: we saw earlier that 1.25/1.115≈1.12, so 1.12^5≈1.7623.

So 15.4286 *1.7623 ≈27.24.

So the second term is 27.24 E0.

So P0 = 1.42296 E0 +27.24 E0 ≈28.66296 E0.

So P0 ≈28.663 E0.

Now, the PE ratio is P0/E0. So that's 28.663, approximately 28.66.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 28.75, which is very close. Hmm, but perhaps my approximations have introduced some error. Let me check the calculations more accurately.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum or the terminal value. Let me double-check.

First, the sum of the first five years:

Each term is (1.25/1.115)^t, t from 1 to5.

Let me compute 1.25/1.115 exactly.

1.25 ÷ 1.115 ≈1.25 ÷1.115 ≈1.1205.

So more accurately, it's approximately 1.1205.

Calculating 1.1205^5.

Let me compute step by step:

1.1205^1 =1.1205.

1.1205^2=1.1205 *1.1205 ≈1.1205².

Calculating 1.12 *1.12 is 1.2544, but 1.1205 is a bit higher. Let's compute:

1.1205 *1.1205:

Multiply 11205 * 11205, but perhaps it's easier to approximate. Let me compute:

(1.12 +0.0005)^2 = 1.12² + 2*1.12*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 ≈1.2544 + 0.00112 +0.00000025≈1.25552.

But wait, 1.1205 is 1.12 +0.0005, so squaring gives:

(1.12)^2 + 2*(1.12)*(0.0005) + (0.0005)^2 ≈1.2544 +0.00112 +0.00000025 ≈1.25552025.

So 1.1205^2≈1.25552.

1.1205^3 =1.25552 *1.1205.

Compute 1.25552 *1.12 =1.4232 (since 1.25552*1.12≈1.4232), and 1.25552*0.0005≈0.00062776. So total≈1.4232 +0.00062776≈1.42382776.

1.1205^4≈1.42382776 *1.1205.

Compute 1.4238 *1.12 = let's see: 1.4238*1=1.4238; 1.4238*0.12=0.170856. Sum≈1.594656. Then 1.4238 *0.0005≈0.0007119. So total≈1.594656 +0.0007119≈1.5953679.

1.1205^5≈1.5953679 *1.1205.

1.5953679 *1.12 ≈1.5953679*1=1.5953679; 1.5953679*0.12≈0.1914445. Sum≈1.7868124. Then 1.5953679 *0.0005≈0.00079768. So total≈1.7868124 +0.00079768≈1.787610.

So 1.1205^5≈1.7876.

So the sum from t=1 to5 of (1.1205)^t is:

r=1.1205.

Sum = r*(r^5 -1)/(r-1).

r^5≈1.7876.

So numerator is 1.1205*(1.7876 -1) =1.1205*(0.7876)=approx 0.882.

Denominator is r-1=0.1205.

So sum≈0.882 /0.1205 ≈7.317.

So first part: 0.20 E0 *7.317≈1.4634 E0.

Now for the terminal value part:

TV5 = [0.50 * E6 ] / (0.115 -0.08) = [0.50 * E5 *1.08 ] /0.035.

E5 = E0*(1.25)^5.

(1.25)^5= approx 3.0517578125 (since 1.25^5 is 3.0517578125).

So E5=3.0517578125 E0.

E6=3.0517578125 E0 *1.08≈3.296 E0.

So D6=0.50 *3.296 E0=1.648 E0.

TV5=1.648 E0 /0.035≈47.0857 E0.

Now, the present value of TV5 is TV5 / (1.115)^5.

(1.115)^5: let's compute more accurately.

1.115^1=1.115.

1.115^2=1.115*1.115=1.252225.

1.115^3=1.252225 *1.115≈1.252225*1=1.252225; 1.252225*0.115≈0.143756. So total≈1.395981.

1.115^4=1.395981 *1.115≈1.395981*1=1.395981; 1.395981*0.115≈0.1604. Sum≈1.556381.

1.115^5=1.556381*1.115≈1.556381*1=1.556381; 1.556381*0.115≈0.1788. Sum≈1.735181.

So (1.115)^5≈1.735181.

Thus, present value of TV5 is 47.0857 E0 /1.735181 ≈27.15 E0.

So now, P0=1.4634 E0 +27.15 E0≈28.6134 E0.

So PE ratio is P0/E0≈28.6134, which is approximately 28.61.

Looking at the options, option A is 28.75, which is very close. So the correct answer should be A:28.75.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the D6 calculation.

Wait, E6 is E5 *1.08, and E5 is E0*(1.25)^5.

So E5= E0*(1.25)^5= E0*3.0517578125.

E6=3.0517578125 *1.08=3.296 E0.

D6=0.50 *3.296 E0=1.648 E0
