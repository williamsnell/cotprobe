Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about grand jury proceedings, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal procedure, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that grand juries are part of the criminal justice system, specifically involved in deciding whether to indict someone, which means bringing formal charges against them. The key here is to recall the characteristics of grand jury proceedings.

The question asks which option is not true. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The proceedings are conducted in secret. I think this is true. Grand juries are known for being closed proceedings, not open to the public, to protect the identities of witnesses and the details of the case, especially if no indictment is returned.

Option B: The proceedings are conducted by a judge. Wait, no, I don't think a judge runs the grand jury. The prosecutor, usually the district attorney, presents the case to the grand jury. The grand jury is made up of citizens, and they decide whether there's enough evidence to indict. So a judge isn't conducting it; that's probably not true.

Option C: The defendant has a right to present evidence. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. In a grand jury, the defendant doesn't have the same rights as in a trial. They can't have an attorney present, but I think they can present evidence, but it's limited. Wait, no, actually, in a grand jury, the defendant doesn't get to present evidence. It's the prosecutor who presents the case. So maybe C is false. But I'm not entirely certain. Or is it that the defendant can present evidence in some circumstances? I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: There is a right to Miranda warnings. Miranda applies when someone is in custody and being questioned. In grand jury proceedings, witnesses can be subpoenaed to testify, but they don't have Miranda rights in that context. So D is not true because Miranda warnings aren't required in grand jury proceedings. 

Option E: The proceedings are open to the public. No, I'm pretty sure grand juries are secret, so E is false. 

Option F: There is no right to have evidence excluded. I think this is true. In grand jury proceedings, the rules of evidence are more relaxed, so evidence that might be inadmissible at trial can be presented. So the defendant doesn't have the right to exclude evidence at this stage. 

Option G: The jury's decision must be unanimous. Wait, for a grand jury, the decision doesn't require a unanimous vote. I think it's a majority or something less than unanimous. So G is false. 

Option H: There is no right to counsel. I believe this is true. Defendants don't have the right to an attorney during grand jury proceedings. Their lawyers can't be present in the grand jury room. 

Option I: The jury is made up of 12 people. Yes, I think federal grand juries have 23 people, but they only need 12 to concur for an indictment. Or wait, maybe state grand juries vary, but I think the question is about a local businessman, so maybe it's a state grand jury? Wait, no, in federal cases, it's typically 23, but the question doesn't specify. But I'm not sure if the number is 12 or more. Wait, wait, I think a grand jury usually has more than 12, like 16 to 23, depending on the jurisdiction. So option I might not be correct. Or maybe it's 12, I'm getting confused.

Now, let's process each option again.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true about grand jury proceedings. So the incorrect statement is the one that's false.

So, let's reevaluate:

A: True, secret.
B: False, not conducted by a judge.
C: Hmm, can the defendant present evidence? I think the defendant doesn't have a right to present evidence in the grand jury. So C would be false because the statement says the defendant has a right, which is not correct.
D: Miranda warnings aren't given, so D is false.
E: False, as it's not open.
G: The decision doesn't need to be unanimous, so G is false.
H: True, no right to counsel.
I: Maybe false, if it's not 12 people.

Wait, but the options are A through J. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about what's NOT true, so the correct answer would be the false statement. So the question is which option is not true—so which is a false statement about grand juries.

So let's list each:

A: True
B: False (no judge)
C: False? Wait, no. I think the defendant doesn't have the right to present evidence in the grand jury. The grand jury hears the prosecutor's case, and the defendant isn't usually allowed to present evidence. So C says the defendant has a right to present evidence, which would be false. So C is a false statement, making it a correct answer to the question.

Alternatively, some sources say that a defendant can present evidence, but it's limited and not a right. Or perhaps in some jurisdictions, the defendant can, but generally, it's not a right.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: Grand juries are not conducted by a judge. That's correct, so B is false—so it's a statement that is not true about grand juries.

Option D: Miranda warnings are not applicable, so D is false.

Option E: Grand juries are secret, so E is false.

Option G: Unanimous decision is not required, so G is false.

Option I: The number of jurors. If the grand jury is 23, then I is false. But if it's 12, then I is true. Wait, federal grand juries have 23, but state might vary. The question is about a local businessman, so probably a state grand jury. Do state grand juries have 12? I'm not certain, but I think some states have 12-member grand juries, others have more. So this could vary, making I possibly true or false depending on the jurisdiction. But the question is general, so perhaps I is not necessarily true.

So, the options that are definitely false statements are B, C, D, E, G, I (maybe), and perhaps others.

But the question is which option is not true.

Wait, the question is: "What is not true about grand jury proceedings?" So the correct answer is the statement that is false about grand juries.

Let me list each option with whether it's true or false.

A: True. Grand jury proceedings are secret.
B: False. Grand juries are not conducted by a judge; it's the prosecutor who presents the case.
C: False? Or is it true? I'm getting conflicting info. If the defendant can present evidence, then C is true. Otherwise, it's false.

Wait, I think in grand juries, the defendant doesn't have the right to present evidence. The grand jury hears only the prosecution's side, so C would be false because the defendant does NOT have the right to present evidence. So C is a false statement.

D: Miranda warnings are not given, so D is false.
E: Grand juries are secret, so E is false.
F: True. There's no right to exclude evidence because the rules are more relaxed.
G: False. Grand juries don't require a unanimous vote.
H: True. No right to counsel during grand jury proceedings.
I: If the grand jury has more than 12, like 23, then I is false. But if it's 12, then I is true. I'm not certain, but I think in federal cases, it's 23, but state varies.

So, the possible false statements are B, C, D, E, G, I (maybe), and others.

But the question is which option is the incorrect statement about grand jury proceedings.

Looking back at the options, the question is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about what's NOT TRUE. So the correct answer is the option that is false about grand juries.

So, for example:

Option B says the proceedings are conducted by a judge. That's false; it's the prosecutor. So B is a false statement.

Option C says the defendant has a right to present evidence. That's false; the defendant doesn't have that right. So C is false.

Option D: There is a right to Miranda warnings. That's false because Miranda doesn't apply.

Option E: The proceedings are open. False.

Option G: Decision must be unanimous. False.

Option I: The jury is made up of 12 people. Maybe false, depending on jurisdiction.

So the question is, which of these is not true. The question is multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, but the choices given are A to I, since the options are labeled A to I.

Looking back at the question, the options are A to I, each with a statement.

Now, I need to figure out which of these is NOT true about grand juries.

So, the correct answer is the false statement.

So, let's evaluate each:

A: True.

B: False. Not conducted by a judge.

C: False. Defendant cannot present evidence.

D: False. No Miranda.

E: False. Proceedings are secret.

F: True. No right to exclude evidence.

G: False. Decision doesn't need to be unanimous.

H: True. No right to counsel.

I: Possibly false. If the grand jury has more than 12, then I is false.

But the question is asking which is not true, so which statement is incorrect.

Wait, the question is about a grand jury proceeding for a local businessman. So it's a state grand jury, not federal. I think state grand juries can vary. Some have 12 members, others more. For example, in some states, a grand jury is 12, others 16, 18, etc. So if the question is about a local (state) grand jury, perhaps I is true if the state uses 12. But if it's a federal grand jury, it's 23. But the question says "local businessman," implying state.

But the question is not about the number; it's about which statement is not true. So perhaps the correct answer is E because it's definitely false.

Wait, E says the proceedings are open to the public. That's definitely false because grand juries are secret. So E is a false statement, making it the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought the question was about which statement is not true, i.e., which is false. So E is definitely false.

But let me double-check the other options.

Option B: Not conducted by a judge. That's definitely false.

Option C: The defendant can present evidence. I'm not sure about this. Wait, I think the defendant doesn't have the right to present evidence. The grand jury hears the prosecution's case, and the defendant isn't allowed to present a defense. So C is a false statement.

Option D: Miranda warnings. No, Miranda isn't applicable, so D is false.

Option G: Unanimous decision. No, grand juries don't require unanimity, so G is false.

Option I: 12 people. If the grand jury has more than 12, then I is false, but if it's exactly 12, then I is true. I'm not certain about this.

But the question asks which is not true, so multiple options could be false. However, the correct answer is probably E because it's clearly false.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

E: The proceedings are open to the public.

That's definitely not true, so E is a false statement.

But wait, the question is about what's NOT true. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but another option, B, is also not true. So why isn't B the answer?

Because the question is a multiple-choice, and only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about all the options again.

The question is which of the options is not true about grand jury proceedings.

So, let's list each option's truthfulness:

A: True. Secret.

B: False. No judge.

C: False. No right to present evidence.

D: False. No Miranda.

E: False. Not open.

F: True. No exclusion of evidence.

G: False. No need for unanimous.

H: True. No counsel.

I: Maybe false, depending on jurisdiction.

Wait, but the question is about which is not true. So all of B, C, D, E, G, I are false, but the answer options only have one correct choice.

Wait, but the options are:

So the options are A to I, but the question is which is not true.

So, the correct answer must be the statement that is false about grand juries.

Looking again, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the most clearly false. Alternatively, it could be B.

Wait, the question is about a grand jury proceeding. So in a grand jury, the prosecutor presents the case, so B is false because a judge doesn't conduct it.

So, option B is a false statement, making it the correct answer.

But I'm a bit confused because multiple options are false.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "what is not true about grand jury proceedings," so any of the false statements would be correct answers, but the question expects only one correct option.

So, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: There is no right to counsel. Wait, H says there is no right to counsel, which is true. So H is a true statement, so it's not the answer.

Wait, no, H says "there is no right to counsel," which is correct because in grand jury proceedings, the defendant doesn't have the right to an attorney in the grand jury room. So H is a true statement, so it's not the answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for the statement that is definitely not true.

Option E: The proceedings are open to the public. Definitely false.

Option B: Conducted by a judge. Definitely false.

Option D: Miranda warnings. Definitely false.

Option C: Defendant can present evidence. Probably false.

Option G: Unanimous decision. Definitely false.

So, all of B, C, D, E, G are false. But the question is which is not true, so any of them could be the answer. But the options only have one correct answer, so perhaps the question is looking for a specific one.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the defendant's rights. So, option C says the defendant has a right to present evidence. I think that's not true because in grand juries, the defendant doesn't have that right. So C is false.

But then, the options are multiple, so perhaps the intended answer is E because it's more obviously false.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the most direct contradiction.

Wait, another angle: The question is about a grand jury, not a trial. So in a grand jury, the defendant doesn't have the right to present evidence, so C is false.

But let's check online.

Upon a quick check (but since I can't access the internet, I'll rely on memory), grand juries do not allow the defendant to present evidence. The defendant isn't even present unless subpoenaed as a witness, which is rare. So C is false.

Option B is also false because a judge isn't conducting the proceeding; the prosecutor is.

So, if I have to choose among the options, which one is not true, I think the intended answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because the grand jury isn't conducted by a judge.

Wait, another point: Grand juries are conducted by the prosecutor, not a judge. So B is false.

But the question is which option is not true, so multiple are false. But in the answer options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the most direct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, but no, H is true.

Wait, no, H says there's no right to counsel, which is correct, so H is a true statement, not the answer.

I think the intended answer is E: The proceedings are open to the public, which is false.

But I'm also considering that option B is false.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the only one that's clearly false without any nuance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because a judge doesn't conduct the grand jury.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, another approach: the question asks which is NOT true. So, the correct answer is the statement that is false.

Looking at the options again:

A: True.

B: False.

C: False.

D: False.

E: False.

F: True.

G: False.

H: True.

I: Maybe false.

So, the options that are false are B, C, D, E, G, and possibly I.

But the question is multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider common exam questions. I recall that grand jury proceedings are secret (so E is false), and that Miranda warnings don't apply (D is false), and that a judge doesn't conduct them (B is false), and that the decision isn't unanimous (G is false).

But the question is about what's not true, so which of these is the incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the most direct.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is B.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go with the most obvious false statement, which is E: The proceedings are open to the public. That's definitely not true, so E is the correct answer.
</think>

To determine which statement is not true about grand jury proceedings, each option must be evaluated based on the characteristics of grand juries:

- **A**: Grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret to protect witnesses and case details. This is true.  
- **B**: Grand juries are not conducted by a judge; rather, the prosecutor presents the case. This is false.  
- **C**: The defendant does not have a right to present evidence during grand jury proceedings. This is false.  
- **D**: Miranda warnings are not applicable in grand jury proceedings. This is false.  
- **E**: Grand jury proceedings are not open to the public. This is false.  
- **F**: There is no right to have evidence excluded, as the rules of evidence are more relaxed. This is true.  
- **G**: The jury's decision does not need to be unanimous. This is false.  
- **H**: There is no right to counsel during grand jury proceedings. This is true.  
- **I**: The size of the grand jury varies by jurisdiction but is often more than 12 members (e.g., 23 in federal cases). This is false if the grand jury has more than 12 members.
