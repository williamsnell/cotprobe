Okay, so I've got this question about lithic technology in the Arctic. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but let me think this through. The question is asking about a specific set of tools: wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins. I remember that different complexes or cultures are named after the regions where they were first found or significant sites.

Wait, I think micro-blades are a key point here. I remember that micro-blades are associated with certain toolkits, maybe from the Upper Paleolithic or later periods. Oh right, the Inuit and other Arctic peoples used micro-blades for tasks like cutting and processing materials, maybe even for harpoons or other tools.

So, the options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Ahrensburg Complex. I think Ahrensburg is a site in Germany, associated with the late Upper Paleolithic, maybe the Hamburgian culture. They were known for shouldered points, but I'm not sure if that's the one with micro-blades.

Option B: Solutrean. That's from France and Spain, known for their laurel-leaf blades and other distinctive tools. Not sure about micro-blades here.

Option C: Aurignacian. That's early Upper Paleolithic, associated with the first modern humans in Europe. They had blade tools, but I'm not certain if that's the Arctic one.

Option D: Nenana Complex. Nenana is in Alaska. I think this complex is associated with the initial peopling of the Americas, maybe around 12,000 years ago. They had a variety of tools, including blades and possible micro-blades.

Option E: Gravettian. Known for Venus figurines, more in Europe, and their tools include blades but perhaps not the specific ones mentioned.

Option F: Clovis. That's the famous culture with the large fluted points, associated with big game hunting in North America. Not sure about micro-blades here.

Option G: Denali Complex. Denali is in Alaska. I remember reading that the Denali complex is known for micro-blade technology. They used wedge-shaped cores, which fits the description. They also had burins and bifacial knives, which are mentioned in the question.

Option H: Mousterian. That's the Neanderthal toolkit, more associated with Levallois cores and flake tools, not micro-blades.

Option I: Magdalenian. Late Upper Paleolithic in Europe, known for harpoons and other tools, but again, not sure about the Arctic connection.

Option J: Folsom. Another North American culture, known for their fluted points used in hunting, not the same as the tools described here.

So, putting it together, the wedge-shaped cores and micro-blades point towards the Denali Complex. I think that's option G.

The lithic technology described, characterized by wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins, is most closely associated with the Denali Complex. This complex, named after the Denali region in Alaska, is known for its micro-blade technology and other tools that match the description provided in the question. Among the options given, the Denali Complex (Option G) fits best.

Answer: G
