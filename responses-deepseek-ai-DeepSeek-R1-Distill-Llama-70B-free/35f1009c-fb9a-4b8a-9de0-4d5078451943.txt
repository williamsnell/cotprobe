Question:

Defendant was waiting in line for post-Thanksgiving day sales. The door opened at 6 a.m. and hundreds of people rushed the entrance for a chance at a hugely discounted holiday gift. When defendant saw that there was a signed copy of a book written by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it, only to be blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She was using the bat as a blocking tool, but he was determined to get the book, so he deliberately stuck his leg out in front of her and tripped her. She fell hard and in the process ended up with a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart over a period of weeks, and ultimately caused her death. What crime can the defendant likely be convicted of?

Options:

A: Battery
B: First degree murder
C: Premeditated murder
D: Involuntary manslaughter
E: Second degree murder
F: Aggravated assault
G: Third degree murder
H: No crime, it was a accident.
I: voluntary manslaughter

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about criminal law, specifically what crime the defendant could be convicted of based on the scenario given. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's recap the situation. The defendant is in a crowded store on a post-Thanksgiving sale. He sees a book he wants, but an old lady with a baseball bat is blocking him. He decides to trip her by sticking his leg out, causing her to fall. She ends up with a blood clot that travels to her heart and causes her death weeks later.

So, the key here is to determine the level of intent and the resulting harm. I remember that crimes like murder, manslaughter, and assault have different elements, especially regarding intent and causation.

I think the first thing to consider is whether the defendant intended to kill her or cause serious harm. From the story, it doesn't seem like he intended to kill her. He just wanted to get the book and tripped her. So, first-degree murder, which requires premeditation and intent, probably doesn't fit here. Same with second-degree murder, which might involve a depraved heart or knowing it would cause serious harm. But again, he just tripped her, not intending death.

Battery is an option. Battery is the intentional and harmful or offensive touching of another person. He did intentionally trip her, which is a form of battery. But that's a misdemeanor, and the question is about the more serious charge because she died.

Involuntary manslaughter is when someone dies due to criminal negligence or during the commission of a misdemeanor. Here, the defendant committed a battery (a misdemeanor) which led to her death. So, under the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, he could be charged with involuntary manslaughter.

Voluntary manslaughter usually involves a heat of passion killing, like in the moment of provocation, which doesn't apply here because the act was more deliberate but not in the heat of passion.

Aggravated assault might be a consideration, but the question is about the result of death. So, manslaughter would be the more appropriate charge.

So, putting it together: the defendant is guilty of a misdemeanor (battery) that resulted in death, so involuntary manslaughter (option D) seems correct.

The defendant tripped the old lady with the intent to get the book, committing a battery. Although the act wasn't intended to cause death, her death resulted from this misdemeanor. Under the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, the defendant can be convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

Answer: D
