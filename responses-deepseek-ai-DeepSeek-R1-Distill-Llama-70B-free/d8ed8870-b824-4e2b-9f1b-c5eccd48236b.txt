Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about boiling points and solutions. Hmm, I remember that when you dissolve something in a solvent, it can change the boiling point. Oh right, that's called boiling point elevation. The formula for that is ΔT = k_b * m, where ΔT is the change in temperature, k_b is the boiling point elevation constant, and m is the molality of the solution.

Alright, the problem says that ethanol boils at 78.5°C. We're adding 10 grams of sucrose (C12H22O11) to 150 grams of ethanol. And the k_b for ethanol is 1.20°C per mol. I need to find the new boiling temperature.

First, I think I need to find the molality of the sucrose solution. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So I have to calculate the moles of sucrose and the kg of ethanol.

The molar mass of sucrose: let's see, carbon is about 12 g/mol, hydrogen is 1, oxygen is 16. So C12H22O11 would be (12*12) + (22*1) + (11*16). Let's calculate that.

12*12 is 144. 22*1 is 22. 11*16 is 176. Adding these together: 144 +22 is 166, plus 176 makes 342 g/mol. Right, so the molar mass of sucrose is 342 g/mol.

So 10 grams of sucrose is how many moles? Moles = mass / molar mass. 10 / 342. Let me compute that. 10 divided by 342 is approximately 0.02924 moles. Hmm, more precisely, like 0.029235 moles.

Wait, but I think I should be more accurate here. Let me do the exact division. 342 goes into 10... 0.029 times 342 is about 9.918, so 0.029 is roughly 0.02923.

Now, the solvent is ethanol. The mass is 150 grams. Oh right, for molality, we need kg. So 150 grams is 0.15 kg.

So molality m is moles solute divided by kg solvent. So m = 0.029235 mol / 0.15 kg. Let me compute that. 0.029235 / 0.15 equals approximately 0.1949 mol/kg. Let's call it about 0.195 m.

Wait, let me check the calculation. 0.029235 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 is 3/20, so dividing by 0.15 is the same as multiplying by 20/3. So 0.029235 * (20/3) is about 0.1949. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the boiling point elevation ΔT is k_b times m. So 1.20°C/m * 0.1949 m. Let's calculate that. 1.20 * 0.1949 is approximately 0.23388 degrees. So about 0.234°C increase.

So the original boiling point of ethanol is 78.5°C. Adding this ΔT gives 78.5 + 0.234 = 78.734°C. Let me round that to, say, 78.73°C. Looking at the options, option C is 78.73°C. Option G is 78.85, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the molar mass of sucrose. Let's recalculate it.

C:12*12=144. H:22*1=22. O:11*16=176. 144+22=166. 166+176=342. Yep, that's correct. So moles are 10/342 = approx 0.029235. Correct.

Ethanol's mass is 150g, which is 0.15 kg. So m = 0.029235 / 0.15 = 0.1949 m. Yes.

ΔT = 1.20 * 0.1949 = 0.2339. So adding to 78.5 gives 78.7339. Rounded to two decimal places, 78.73°C, which is option C. Hmm, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, the options given are A:78.5, B:79.5, C:78.73, D:79, E:78.9, F:78.65, G:78.85, etc. So C is 78.73, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be C.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, the formula is written as ΔT = i * k_b * m, where i is the van't Hoff factor. For sucrose, which doesn't dissociate in solution, i is 1. So that's correct. So no issue there. So the calculation seems right. So the answer is option C.

To determine the boiling point of the ethanol solution after dissolving sucrose, we use the boiling point elevation formula:

\[
\Delta T = k_b \cdot m
\]

where:
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in boiling point,
- \(k_b = 1.20 \, \text{°C/m}\) (boiling point elevation constant for ethanol),
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent).

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of sucrose
The molar mass of sucrose (\(C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}\)) is:

\[
\text{Molar mass} = (12 \cdot 12) + (22 \cdot 1) + (11 \cdot 16) = 144 + 22 + 176 = 342 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles of sucrose is:

\[
\text{Moles of sucrose} = \frac{\text{Mass of sucrose}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{10}{342} \approx 0.029235 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the molality of the solution
The mass of ethanol is \(150 \, \text{g} = 0.15 \, \text{kg}\). Molality is:

\[
m = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Kilograms of solvent}} = \frac{0.029235}{0.15} \approx 0.1949 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the boiling point elevation
Using the formula \(\Delta T = k_b \cdot m\):

\[
\Delta T = 1.20 \cdot 0.1949 \approx 0.2339 \, \text{°C}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the new boiling point
The original boiling point of ethanol is \(78.5 \, \text{°C}\). Adding the elevation:

\[
\text{New boiling point} = 78.5 + 0.2339 \approx 78.73 \, \text{°C}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The boiling point of the solution is approximately \(78.73 \, \text{°C}\), which corresponds to option **C**.
