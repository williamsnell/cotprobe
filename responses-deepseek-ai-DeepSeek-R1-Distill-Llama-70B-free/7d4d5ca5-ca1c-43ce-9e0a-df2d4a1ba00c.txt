Question:

The code fragment below is intended to display "odd" if the positive number num is odd.
 IF (<MISSING CONDITION>)
 DISPLAY “odd”

 Which of the following can be used to replace <MISSING CONDITION> so that the code fragment will work as intended?

Options:

A: (num MOD 1) = 1
B: (num MOD 3) = 1
C: (num DIV 2) = 1
D: (num MOD 1) = 0
E: (num MOD 2) = 1
F: (num MOD 2 ) = 0
G: (num DIV 2) = 0
H: (num MOD 0) = 1

Okay, so I have this programming problem here. The question is about determining the correct condition to check if a positive number is odd. Let me think through this step by step.

The code given is an IF statement that, when the condition is met, displays "odd". So the condition should be true when 'num' is an odd number.

Hmm, I remember that checking if a number is odd or even involves using modulo operations. The modulo operator gives the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, for even and odd checks, modulo 2 is commonly used.

Wait, right! If a number is even, dividing it by 2 will leave no remainder. So num MOD 2 would be 0 for even numbers. Conversely, if a number is odd, num MOD 2 would be 1 because there's a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

So the condition should check if num MOD 2 equals 1. Looking at the options, option E is (num MOD 2) = 1. That makes sense.

Let me glance through the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A: MOD 1. Well, any number MOD 1 is 0 because 1 divides into any number completely. So that's not useful here. Option B: MOD 3 equals 1? That would only be true for numbers like 1,4,7, etc. Not all odds. So that's not correct.

Option C: num DIV 2 equals 1. Wait, DIV is integer division. So for example, if num is 3, 3 DIV 2 is 1. But for num=5, it's 2 as well. But that doesn't directly tell us if it's odd. Because for even numbers, like 4, 4 DIV 2 is 2, which is different. But wait, the condition would be true for any num >=2. Because for num=2, 2 DIV 2 is 1, which would make the condition true. But num=2 is even, so the condition would incorrectly flag it as odd. So option C isn't correct.

Option D: MOD 1 equals 0. As I thought earlier, MOD 1 always gives 0, so that's true for any num, which isn't what we want since we only want it when num is odd.

Option F: MOD 2 equals 0. That's the condition for even numbers. So that would display "odd" when num is even, which is the opposite of what we want.

Option G: num DIV 2 equals 0. Let's see. For num=1, 1 DIV 2 is 0. So condition is true. That works. But what about num=3? 3 DIV 2 is 1, so condition would be false. So it only works for num=1, which isn't all odd numbers. So G isn't correct.

Option H: MOD 0 equals 1. Oh wait, MOD by zero is undefined in most programming languages. That would cause an error, so H isn't a valid option.

So putting it all together, the correct condition is option E: (num MOD 2) = 1.

To determine if a positive number `num` is odd, we use the modulo operation. A number is odd if `num MOD 2` equals 1, as this indicates a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: `num MOD 1` is always 0, so it's incorrect.
- **B**: `num MOD 3 = 1` applies only to specific odd numbers, not all.
- **C**: `num DIV 2 = 1` incorrectly flags even numbers like 2 as odd.
- **D**: `num MOD 1 = 0` is always true, not specific to odd numbers.
- **E**: `num MOD 2 = 1` correctly identifies odd numbers.
- **F**: `num MOD 2 = 0` checks for even numbers, not odd.
- **G**: `num DIV 2 = 0` only works for `num = 1`, not all odd numbers.
- **H**: `num MOD 0` is undefined and causes an error.

The correct condition is **E: (num MOD 2) = 1**.

Answer: E
