Okay, so I'm trying to solve this economics problem about consumer surplus under perfect competition. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a monopolist has constant average and marginal costs of 5. The market demand is Q = 53 - P. I need to find the consumer surplus when the market is perfectly competitive, meaning price equals marginal cost.

Wait, right, in perfect competition, firms produce where P = MC. Since the MC here is 5, the price would be 5. So I should find the quantity demanded at this price.

The demand equation is Q = 53 - P. If P is 5, then Q = 53 - 5 = 48. So at P=5, the quantity is 48 units.

But wait, consumer surplus is the area above the price line and below the demand curve. So I need to calculate the area of the triangle formed by the demand curve, the price line at P=5, and the P-axis.

The formula for consumer surplus is (1/2) * base * height. The base is the quantity at P=5, which is 48. The height is the difference between the maximum price consumers would pay (when Q=0) and the market price. When Q=0, P is 53, so the height is 53 - 5 = 48.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The demand equation is Q = 53 - P. Solving for P gives P = 53 - Q. So when Q is 0, P is 53. So the demand curve starts at (0,53) and goes down, crossing the quantity axis at P=0, Q=53.

So when P is 5, Q is 48. So the consumer surplus is the area between P=5 and P=53, but only up to Q=48.

So the base is 48, and the height is 53 - 5 = 48. So the area is (1/2) * 48 * 48.

Let me calculate that. 48 times 48 is 2304. Half of that is 1152.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 1152. So that should be the answer.

But wait, am I mixing up anything? Let me double-check. Under perfect competition, the equilibrium is where P=MC=5. The quantity supplied is where MC intersects the MC curve, but since MC is flat, supply is at Q=48. The demand at P=5 is 48, so that's the equilibrium quantity.

The consumer surplus is indeed the area above P=5 up to the demand curve, which forms a right triangle with base 48 and height 48. So yes, (48 *48)/2 = 1152.

So the answer should be H.
</think>

To calculate the consumer surplus under perfect competition, we start by determining the equilibrium price and quantity. In perfect competition, the price equals marginal cost (P = MC). Given that MC = 5, the equilibrium price is 5. Substituting P = 5 into the demand equation \( Q = 53 - P \), we find the equilibrium quantity \( Q = 53 - 5 = 48 \).

Consumer surplus is the area above the price line (P = 5) and below the demand curve, which forms a right triangle. The base of the triangle is the equilibrium quantity (\( Q = 48 \)), and the height is the difference between the maximum price consumers would pay (when \( Q = 0 \)) and the equilibrium price. From the demand equation, when \( Q = 0 \), \( P = 53 \), so the height is \( 53 - 5 = 48 \).

The formula for consumer surplus is:

\[
\text{Consumer Surplus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Consumer Surplus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \times 48 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2304 = 1152
\]

Thus, the consumer surplus under perfect competition is **1152**.
