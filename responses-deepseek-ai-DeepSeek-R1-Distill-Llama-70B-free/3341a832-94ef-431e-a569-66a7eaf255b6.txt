Question:

A man placed the following advertisement in his local newspaper:"Public Auction Sale . . . without reserve December 7, 10:00 a. m. 110 Walnut St. , City, StateEntire furnishings of home must go: antiques, piano, pool table, appliances, tables, stereo system, etc. "On the morning of December 7, a group of approximately 20 people showed up at the man's home. The first item the man put up for bid was an antique Baldwin grand piano. The man announced that the bidding would be "without reserve" and said, "What's the opening bid on this beautiful Baldwin grand piano?" A woman opened the bidding with $100. The man then commented, "This piano is worth at least $5,000. What other bids am I offered?" When the man did not receive any other bids, he informed the woman that he would not accept $100 and was removing the piano from the sale. If the woman asserts an action against the man for breach of contract, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the auctioneer asked for other bids after the woman's opening bid, validating her bid.
B: prevail, because whether or not the auction is "without reserve," goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids.
C: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer may withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale.
D: not prevail, because the auctioneer did not formally accept the woman's bid before withdrawing the piano.
E: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer invites offers, which he may accept or reject.
F: prevail, because the auctioneer stated that the piano is worth at least $5,000, implying a minimum bid.
G: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the discretion to withdraw any item from an auction.
H: prevail, because goods put up at an auction "without reserve" may not be withdrawn.
I: prevail, because the auction was advertised as "without reserve," meaning all items must be sold to the highest bidder.
J: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the right to reject any bid he considers too low.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about an auction and whether the woman can sue the man for breach of contract. Let me break down the scenario step by step.

The man advertised a public auction sale without reserve. That usually means that the items will be sold to the highest bidder, and the seller isn't setting a minimum price. So, he's obligated to sell it to whoever offers the highest bid, even if it's lower than what he thinks it's worth.

On the day of the auction, the man starts with an antique Baldwin grand piano. He announces that the bidding is without reserve and asks for the opening bid. A woman bids $100. He then comments that the piano is worth at least $5,000 and asks for other bids. But no one else bids, so he tells the woman he won't accept $100 and takes the piano off the sale.

The question is whether the woman can successfully sue for breach of contract.

I remember that in contract law, for an auction without reserve, once the bidding starts, the auctioneer can't withdraw the item unless there's a reserve. Since there's no reserve here, I think the auctioneer is supposed to sell it to the highest bidder, even if that's lower than expected.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. When an auction is without reserve, the auctioneer is under a duty to sell the item to the highest bidder. If he fails to do that, he might be in breach. So when the woman made the first bid, and no one else bid, the auctioneer should have accepted her bid because she was the highest (and only) bidder.

But wait, did the man actually accept her bid? In the scenario, he didn't say "sold" or formally accept. He just asked for other bids after her opening. So maybe the argument is whether a contract was formed.

In auctions, typically, the auctioneer's call for bids is an invitation to offer, not an offer themselves. So the bidders are making offers, and the auctioneer (or seller) can accept or reject. But in a without reserve auction, once the bidding starts, the auctioneer must accept the highest bid. If he doesn't, that's a breach.

So here, the man called for an opening bid, she bid $100, he asked for more bids, got none, so he should have accepted hers. By refusing, he broke the contract.

Looking at the options:

Option A says she prevails because the auctioneer asked for other bids, validating her bid. That might make sense because by asking for other bids after hers, he's treating it as a valid opening, so he can't back out.

Option B says she prevails because goods can't be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids. That also sounds right because without a reserve, once bidding starts, withdrawal isn't allowed.

Option J says she doesn't prevail because the auctioneer can reject any bid he thinks is too low. But in a without reserve auction, he can't do that. He has to accept the highest bid, even if it's low.

Option H says she prevails because without reserve means items can't be withdrawn. That also seems correct.

Wait, but some sources say that in without reserve auctions, the auctioneer can still withdraw items before the first bid, but once bidding starts, they can't. Here, he put it up for bid, so he can't withdraw it.

So, the correct reasoning is that once the auction starts, the seller must sell to the highest bidder. Therefore, the woman's bid was the only one, so he had to accept it. His refusal is a breach.

Looking back at the options, option A says she prevails because the auctioneer asked for other bids, validating her bid. That seems to fit because he treated her bid as a valid starting point, so he can't withdraw it.

Option H says goods can't be withdrawn in a without reserve auction. That's a bit broader but also correct.

Wait, but I think the key point is that once the auction starts (bidding begins), the seller can't withdraw. So without reserve, he's obligated to sell. Therefore, the woman should prevail.

So looking at the options, option A and H seem possible.

Option C says she doesn't prevail because the auctioneer can withdraw until sale is completed. But that's incorrect because without reserve, he can't withdraw once bidding starts.

Option E says she doesn't prevail because offers can be accepted or rejected. But in without reserve, once bidding starts, he must accept the highest bid.

So the correct answer should be either A or H.

Wait, the difference between A and H. Option A says because auctioneer asked for other bids, validating her bid. Option H says because goods can't be withdrawn without reserve.

I think H is more accurate because the advertisement was without reserve, so he can't withdraw. But I'm a bit confused.

Another angle: At common law, in an auction without reserve, the auctioneer can still withdraw items before any bid is made, but once a bid is made, he can't withdraw it. So here, the woman made a bid, so he can't withdraw. So her bid was valid, and he had to accept it.

Therefore, she can enforce the sale.

Looking at the options, option A says she prevails because the auctioneer asked for other bids, which validates her bid. So that's correct because by asking for more bids, he treated her bid as a valid opening, so it's a binding contract.

But option H says that goods may not be withdrawn in a without reserve auction. That's a general statement, but perhaps it's too broad. Because, as per common law, withdrawal is allowed before any bid, but not after.

So the correct answer should be either A or H.

Wait, but looking back, the advertisement was without reserve, and he started the bidding. So he can't withdraw. So the woman's bid was the highest, so he must accept.

So the answer is either A or H. But the options are as follows:

Option A: prevail because auctioneer asked for other bids, validating her bid.

Option H: prevail because goods may not be withdrawn.

Hmm. I think the correct reasoning is that in a without reserve auction, once the auction begins (bidding starts), the seller is bound to sell to the highest bidder. Therefore, the man couldn't withdraw it, so the woman should prevail.

So the correct answer would be H or A.

Wait, but another consideration: the auctioneer's statements. He said it's without reserve, so he's bound once the first bid is made. So the woman's bid was the only one, so he must accept.

So the answer should be option A because the auctioneer asked for other bids, which means he was treating her bid as valid. Alternatively, option H is correct because without reserve means no withdrawal.

I think the correct answer is A because the auctioneer's action of asking for other bids after her opening bid validates the bid, making it a binding contract.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Another approach: in an auction without reserve, when the auctioneer solicits bids, the seller is bound to sell to the highest bidder. So even if he didn't accept the bid formally, the woman's bid was the highest, and he can't withdraw.

So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says goods can't be withdrawn after auctioneer calls for bids. That seems to apply here because he called for bids, got one, then tried to withdraw.

So option B would be correct if that's the rule. But I'm not sure if the rule is that once the auctioneer calls for bids, withdrawal isn't allowed, regardless of whether any bids have been made.

Alternatively, the rule is that once a bid is made, withdrawal is not allowed.

So perhaps the correct answer is H, because without reserve means he can't withdraw, and the woman's bid was the only one, so he must accept.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the rules again.

In a without reserve auction, the auctioneer must sell to the highest bidder. If the auctioneer starts the bidding and someone makes a bid, the auctioneer can't withdraw the item from sale. So the woman's $100 bid was the only one, so the man must accept it.

Therefore, the woman would prevail because the auction was without reserve, and once the bidding started, he couldn't withdraw the item.

Looking at the options, option H says: prevail, because goods put up at an auction "without reserve" may not be withdrawn.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the answer is H.
</think>

In this scenario, the man advertised a public auction "without reserve," which typically means that the items must be sold to the highest bidder, even if the bid is lower than the seller's expectations. The woman placed the only bid of $100 on the piano, and the man attempted to withdraw the piano after stating it was worth at least $5,000. 

Under the rules of auctions, once an auction "without reserve" begins and a bid is made, the seller is obligated to sell the item to the highest bidder. The auctioneer cannot withdraw the item after bidding has commenced. Here, the woman's $100 bid was the only one, and the man's attempt to withdraw the piano after the bidding started constitutes a breach of contract. 

Among the options provided, option H correctly states that in an auction "without reserve," goods may not be withdrawn once bidding has started. This aligns with the principle that the seller is bound to sell to the highest bidder in such auctions.

**Answer: H**
