Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question says:

Let f(x) = 3x² - 2 and g(f(x)) = x² + x + 1. Find the sum of all possible values of g(25).

Hmm. I remember that g is a function that takes f(x) as its input. So g is a function composed with f(x). But I'm not exactly sure how to approach this. Let's break it down.

First, I know that f(x) is given by 3x² minus 2. So for any x, f(x) = 3x² -2. And g is a function that depends on f(x). The function g(f(x)) is given as x² +x +1.

Wait, so g(f(x)) is equal to x² + x + 1. But I need to find g(25). So somehow, I need to find what g is as a function, or find the x values that make f(x) equal to 25, and then plug those into g(f(x)).

Let me think. Maybe the approach is to find all x such that f(x) =25, and then evaluate g at those points. Since g is given as a function of f(x), which is a function of x, each x that gives f(x)=25 will give a corresponding g(25) value.

So first, I need to solve f(x) =25. Let's write that equation:

3x² - 2 =25.

Solve for x²:

3x² = 25 + 2 → 3x²=27 → x²=9 → x=3 or x=-3.

So there are two x values: 3 and -3.

Now, for each of these x values, I plug into g(f(x)) which is x² + x +1.

So for x=3:

g(f(3)) = (3)^2 +3 +1 =9+3+1=13.

For x=-3:

g(f(-3)) = (-3)^2 + (-3) +1=9-3+1=7.

Wait, so when x is 3, g(25) is 13. When x is -3, g(25) is 7. So the possible values of g(25) are 13 and 7.

But the question asks for the sum of all possible values of g(25). So 13 +7=20.

Looking at the options, option I is 20. So the answer should be I.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any calculation mistakes?

First, solving f(x)=25:

3x² -2=25 → 3x²=27 → x²=9 → x=±3. That seems right.

Then evaluating g at those points. Because g(f(x)) is given as x² +x +1. So when x=3, it's 9+3+1=13. When x=-3, 9-3+1=7. Sum is 20. Yep, that looks correct.

I think I got it right. So the answer is I.

To solve the problem, we start by finding the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( f(x) = 25 \). Given \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2 \), we solve:

\[
3x^2 - 2 = 25 \implies 3x^2 = 27 \implies x^2 = 9 \implies x = \pm 3.
\]

Thus, the two values of \( x \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \).

Next, we evaluate \( g(f(x)) \), which is given as \( g(f(x)) = x^2 + x + 1 \), at these \( x \) values:

1. For \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   g(f(3)) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
   \]

2. For \( x = -3 \):
   \[
   g(f(-3)) = (-3)^2 + (-3) + 1 = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7.
   \]

The possible values of \( g(25) \) are therefore \( 13 \) and \( 7 \). The sum of these values is:

\[
13 + 7 = 20.
\]

Thus, the sum of all possible values of \( g(25) \) is \( 20 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
