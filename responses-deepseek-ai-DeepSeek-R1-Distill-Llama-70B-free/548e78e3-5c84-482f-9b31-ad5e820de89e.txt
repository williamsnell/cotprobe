Question:

The citrate ion forms a tight bond with calcium ions so that the calcium is unable to react with other substances In view of this, why is sodium citrate added to whole blood immediately after it is drawn from a blood donor?

Options:

A: Sodium citrate is added to cause muscle spasms
B: Sodium citrate is added to catalyze the formation of fibrin
C: Sodium citrate is added to preserve the blood's color
D: Sodium citrate is added to stimulate immune responses
E: Sodium citrate is added to increase calcium ions
F: Sodium citrate is added to prevent coagulation
G: Sodium citrate is added to increase the blood's viscosity
H: Sodium citrate is added to enhance oxygen carrying capacity of the blood
I: Sodium citrate is added to decrease the blood's pH level
J: Sodium citrate is added as a nutrient for blood cells

Okay, so I have this question about why sodium citrate is added to blood after it's drawn. Hmm, I remember that when blood is drawn, especially for donations or tests, they use some kind of anticoagulant to prevent it from clotting. Because if the blood clots, it can't be used properly for transfusions or testing.

Wait, the question says citrate binds tightly with calcium ions. Oh right, calcium is important for blood coagulation. I think the clotting process involves several steps, and calcium ions play a key role in that. So if citrate grabs onto the calcium, it must be preventing the blood from clotting.

Looking at the options, let me go through them. Option A: Sodium citrate causing muscle spasms? No, that doesn't make sense. I don't think that's related. Option B: Catalyze fibrin formation. Fibrin is part of the clot, so catalyzing would mean it's helping to clot, but sodium citrate is an anticoagulant, so maybe the opposite. Option C: Preserve blood color? I don't think that's the main reason. Blood color is more about the hemoglobin and oxygen levels, not the additives.

Option D: Stimulate immune responses? No, that's not what I remember. Sodium citrate isn't for immune stuff. Option E: Increase calcium ionsâ€”no way, because citrate binds calcium, so it would decrease them. So E is wrong. Option F: Prevent coagulation. That sounds right because no calcium means the clotting can't proceed. So F seems correct.

Option G: Increase viscosity. I don't think so. Maybe if it's too thick, but that's not why they add it. Option H: Enhance oxygen carrying capacity. Sodium citrate shouldn't affect hemoglobin's ability to carry oxygen. Option I: Decrease pH. Citrate is a buffer maybe, but the main reason isn't pH; it's about preventing clots. Option J: Nutrient for blood cells. I don't think sodium citrate is a nutrient in that way.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F: Sodium citrate is added to prevent coagulation.

Sodium citrate is added to whole blood immediately after it is drawn to prevent coagulation. It works by binding tightly with calcium ions, which are essential for the blood clotting process. Without calcium, the clotting cascade cannot proceed, ensuring the blood remains usable for transfusions or testing. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

F: Sodium citrate is added to prevent coagulation.
