Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of India's population that used the internet in 2017. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I remember that India has a huge population, so even a small percentage could mean a lot of people. But I'm trying to recall some stats from around that time. I think internet penetration was growing but maybe not super high yet.

Wait, I remember reading that around 2017, India had a significant increase in internet users, partly because of cheaper data plans and smartphones. But what was the exact figure? I think it was around a third of the population. Maybe 30% or so.

Looking at the options, option B is 33%, which is close to my guess. Option J is 26%, which is a bit lower. I'm not sure if it was that high yet. Also, I think by 2018, the numbers were higher, so 2017 might have been a bit lower than that.

Another thought: I remember the Digital India initiative was pushing for more internet access, but maybe the adoption wasn't over 40% yet. So options like H (41%) seem a bit high for 2017.

I also recall some reports stating that urban areas had higher usage than rural. But overall, the national average might have been around 30%. So 33% sounds plausible.

Wait, maybe it's 26%? Because sometimes the numbers can vary based on the source. Some might count active users in the past three months, others might count any usage at all. But I think the question specifies the past three months, so it's about recent usage.

I'm a bit torn between 26% (J) and 33% (B). I think 26% sounds like it might be from an earlier year, but 33% could be the figure right around 2017. Let me think again. In 2016, I believe the percentage was lower, maybe around 20-25%, so by 2017 it would have increased. So 26% might have been in 2016, and 33% in 2017.

So I'm leaning towards B: 33%.

The question asks for the fraction of India's population that used the internet in the past three months as of 2017. Considering the context of growing internet adoption due to cheaper data and smartphones, the estimate is around a third of the population. Option B (33%) aligns with this reasoning, as it reflects the increase from lower percentages in earlier years like 2016. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: 33%

Answer: B
