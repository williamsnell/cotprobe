Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: x minus 10.5 equals -11.6. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but I think I can figure this out. Let me think about how to isolate x here.

Alright, the equation is x - 10.5 = -11.6. I remember that to solve for x, I need to get it by itself on one side. Right now, x is being subtracted by 10.5. So, the opposite of subtracting is adding. That means I should add 10.5 to both sides to cancel it out on the left.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I have x minus something, adding that something to both sides should give me x equals that something plus the other number. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, adding 10.5 to both sides. Let me write that out. On the left side, x -10.5 +10.5 would just be x. And on the right side, I have -11.6 +10.5. Hmm, what's -11.6 plus 10.5? Let me calculate that.

I think it's easier if I do it step by step. 10.5 is the same as 10 and a half. So, -11.6 plus 10 is -1.6. Then, adding 0.5 to that gives me -1.1, right? Because -1.6 + 0.5 is like moving half a point towards positive, so from -1.6 to -1.1.

So putting it all together, x equals -1.1. Now, looking at the options given, option C is -1.1. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me go through it again. Starting with x -10.5 = -11.6. Adding 10.5 to both sides gives x = -11.6 +10.5. Yeah, that's correct. And the calculation gives -1.1, so option C is right.

To solve the equation \( x - 10.5 = -11.6 \), we aim to isolate \( x \). Adding 10.5 to both sides cancels the subtraction on the left, resulting in:

\[
x = -11.6 + 10.5
\]

Performing the arithmetic:

\[
-11.6 + 10.5 = -1.1
\]

Thus, \( x = -1.1 \). The correct answer is option C.
