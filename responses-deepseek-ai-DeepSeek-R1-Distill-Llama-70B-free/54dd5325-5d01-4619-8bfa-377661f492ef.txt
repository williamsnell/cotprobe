Question:

Defendant was waiting in line for post-Thanksgiving day sales. The door opened at 6 a.m. and hundreds of people rushed the entrance for a chance at a hugely discounted holiday gift. When defendant saw that there was a signed copy of a book written by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it, only to be blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She was using the bat as a blocking tool, but he was determined to get the book, so he deliberately stuck his leg out in front of her and tripped her. She fell hard and in the process ended up with a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart over a period of weeks, and ultimately caused her death. What crime can the defendant likely be convicted of?

Options:

A: Battery
B: First degree murder
C: Premeditated murder
D: Involuntary manslaughter
E: Second degree murder
F: Aggravated assault
G: Third degree murder
H: No crime, it was a accident.
I: voluntary manslaughter

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is about a defendant who's waiting in line for post-Thanksgiving sales. The doors open at 6 a.m., and a lot of people rush in. The defendant sees a signed copy of a book by his mother's favorite author. He jumps towards it but is blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She's using the bat to block, so he sticks his leg out and trips her. She falls hard, gets a blood clot that travels to her heart over weeks, causing her death. The question is what crime can the defendant be convicted of.

The options are A through J, with various possible charges.

Hmm. So, I need to think about the elements of each crime and apply them to the facts.

First, let's outline the facts. The defendant intentionally tripped the old lady, causing her to fall. She died weeks later from a blood clot that resulted from that fall.

So, the key here is that the defendant's action (tripping) directly caused her death, but the death wasn't immediateâ€”it happened weeks later. Also, the defendant's intent was to trip her, not necessarily to kill her.

Let me think about the possible charges.

Option A: Battery. Battery is the intentional and harmful or offensive touching of another person. Tripping her would likely be a battery because he made physical contact (with his leg) that was offensive. But battery alone doesn't cover the death; it's a separate issue.

Option B: First degree murder. First-degree murder is typically premeditated. The defendant thought about killing her, planned it, and then did it. But in this case, he just wanted to get the book and tripped her. There's no indication he intended to kill her, so first-degree murder doesn't fit.

Option C: Premeditated murder. Similar to B, premeditation is key. He didn't plan to kill her, so this is out.

Option D: Involuntary manslaughter. This is killing without intent but during the commission of an unlawful act. Involuntary manslaughter often applies when someone dies as a result of a misdemeanor or low-level felony. Here, the defendant committed a battery, which is a misdemeanor, and that led to her death. So this might fit.

Option E: Second-degree murder. This is murder with intent but without premeditation, or felony murder. Did the defendant have intent to kill? No, he intended to trip her, not kill. Felony murder would require that the death happened during a felony. But tripping someone is a misdemeanor, not a felony, so felony murder doesn't apply. So E is unlikely.

Option F: Aggravated assault. This involves attacking someone with intent to cause serious bodily harm or using a deadly weapon. He used his leg to trip her, not a weapon, and the intent was to trip, not cause serious harm. So maybe not, though it's a possibility, but the question is about the resulting death, not the assault itself.

Option G: Third-degree murder. This varies by jurisdiction, but it's often murder without premeditation but with a more serious disregard for human life. I'm not sure if this applies here because the defendant's action was intentional but not with the intent to kill.

Option H: No crime, accident. No, because he deliberately tripped her, so it's not an accident. So H is wrong.

Option I: Voluntary manslaughter. This is a killing that occurs in the heat of passion, with adequate provocation. There's no indication of provocation here, just a desire to get a book. So I doesn't fit.

So, putting it together. The defendant is guilty of battery, but the question is about the homicide charge. Since he didn't intend to kill, it's not murder. The death occurred as a result of a misdemeanor (battery), so it's involuntary manslaughter.

Wait, but wait. Involuntary manslaughter is when the death occurs during the commission of a misdemeanor. The misdemeanor here is battery. So yes, that fits.

Alternatively, some might consider if this is a felony murder, but tripping isn't a felony. So D is the best fit.

The defendant intentionally tripped the elderly woman, causing her to fall and eventually die from complications related to the fall. To determine the appropriate charge, we analyze the elements of each crime:

- **Battery (A):** The defendant committed battery by intentionally tripping the woman, but this charge alone does not account for her death.
- **First Degree Murder (B) and Premeditated Murder (C):** These require premeditation and intent to kill, which are absent here. The defendant only intended to trip her, not to cause her death.
- **Involuntary Manslaughter (D):** This applies when a death results from the commission of a misdemeanor. The defendant's act of tripping (battery) is a misdemeanor, and the death occurred as a result. This fits the facts.
- **Second Degree Murder (E):** This requires intent to kill or felony murder. The defendant did not intend to kill, and tripping is not a felony, so this does not apply.
- **Aggravated Assault (F):** While tripping could be seen as an assault, the focus is on the resulting death, not the assault itself.
- **Third Degree Murder (G):** This typically involves a reckless disregard for human life. The defendant's action was intentional but not with intent to kill, making this less fitting.
- **No Crime (H):** The defendant's action was deliberate, so this is incorrect.
- **Voluntary Manslaughter (I):** This requires a killing in the heat of passion, which is not present here.

The most appropriate charge is **Involuntary Manslaughter (D)**, as the death resulted from the commission of a misdemeanor (battery).

Answer: D
