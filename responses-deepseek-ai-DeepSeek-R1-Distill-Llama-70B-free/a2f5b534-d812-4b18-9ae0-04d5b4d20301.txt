Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about calculating the de Broglie wavelengths of three different objects. The objects are: (a) a 10,000 kg truck moving at 27.8 m/s, (b) a 50 mg flea flying at 1 m/s, and (c) a water molecule moving at 500 m/s. We're supposed to find the wavelengths in centimeters for each, using Planck's constant h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

The options are from A to J, each giving three values. I need to calculate each wavelength and match them to the correct option.

I remember that the de Broglie wavelength λ is given by λ = h / (m*v), where m is mass and v is velocity. So the formula is straightforward, but I have to be careful with units since the answers are in centimeters.

Let me note down the given values:

For (a):
Mass m = 10,000 kg = 1e4 kg
Velocity v = 27.8 m/s

For (b):
Mass m = 50 mg = 50e-6 kg = 5e-5 kg
Velocity v = 1 m/s

For (c):
Hmm, wait. Wait, the problem says a water molecule. So I need to find its mass. I think a water molecule is H2O, which has a molar mass of approximately 18 grams per mole. So one molecule would be 18e-3 kg per 6.022e23 molecules (Avogadro's number). Let me calculate that.

Molar mass of H2O = 18 g/mol = 0.018 kg/mol.

Number of molecules per mole = Avogadro's number, N_A = 6.022e23 mol^-1.

So mass of one molecule m = 0.018 kg/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

Calculating that: 0.018 / 6.022e23 = approx 2.988e-26 kg.

Wait, let me do that more accurately.

0.018 / 6.022e23 = (1.8e-2) / (6.022e23) = 1.8/(6.022) * 1e-25 ≈ 0.2988 *1e-25 = 2.988e-26 kg.

So m ≈ 3e-26 kg.

Velocity for (c) is 500 m/s.

Okay, now I have all the m and v for each part. Now compute λ for each.

Let's start with part (a).

λ_a = h / (m_a * v_a)
h = 6.626e-34 J·s
m_a = 1e4 kg
v_a = 27.8 m/s

So, m*v = 1e4 * 27.8 = 2.78e5 kg·m/s.

λ_a = 6.626e-34 / 2.78e5 = let's calculate this.

6.626e-34 / 2.78e5 = (6.626 / 2.78) * 1e-39.

6.626 / 2.78 ≈ 2.383.

So λ_a ≈ 2.383e-39 meters.

Wait, wait, but the answer options are in centimeters, so I need to convert meters to cm. Since 1 m = 100 cm, so 1e-39 m = 1e-37 cm. So 2.383e-39 m = 2.383e-37 cm.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters. So to convert meters to centimeters, multiply by 100. So 1e-39 m is 1e-39 * 100 cm = 1e-37 cm.

So λ_a = 2.383e-39 m = 2.383e-37 cm. Let's approximate this as about 2.38e-37 cm. Looking at the options, I don't see this exact number yet, but let's proceed.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, m = 1e4 kg, v = 27.8 m/s.

m*v = 1e4 * 27.8 = 2.78e5 kg m/s.

h/(m v) = 6.626e-34 / 2.78e5 = ?

6.626e-34 / 2.78e5 = (6.626 / 2.78) * 1e-34-5 = 6.626 / 2.78 is about 2.383, so 2.383e-39 m.

Which is 2.383e-37 cm. So that would be 2.38e-37 cm.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E: 2.4e-37 cm, 1.3e-27 cm, 4.43e-9 cm.

So for part (a), it's 2.38e-37 cm, which would match E's first value of 2.4e-37.

Wait, let's do each part step by step.

Now part (b):

m = 50 mg = 50e-6 kg = 5e-5 kg
v = 1 m/s

m*v = 5e-5 *1 = 5e-5 kg m/s.

λ_b = h/(m v) = 6.626e-34 / 5e-5.

6.626e-34 /5e-5 = (6.626 /5 )e-34 +5 = 1.3252e-29 m.

Wait, wait, no: 6.626e-34 divided by 5e-5 is:

(6.626 /5) * 1e-34 / 1e-5 = 1.3252 * 1e-29.

So 1.3252e-29 meters.

Convert to centimeters: 1e-29 m = 1e-27 cm (since 1 m = 1e2 cm, so 1e-29 m * 1e2 cm/m = 1e-27 cm).

So λ_b = 1.3252e-29 m = 1.3252e-27 cm.

So about 1.3e-27 cm.

Looking at the options, E's second value is 1.3e-27 cm, which matches.

Now part (c):

m = 3e-26 kg
v = 500 m/s

m*v = 3e-26 * 500 = 1.5e-23 kg m/s.

λ_c = h/(m v) = 6.626e-34 / 1.5e-23.

Calculate that:

6.626e-34 /1.5e-23 = (6.626 /1.5) * 1e-11.

6.626 /1.5 ≈ 4.417.

So λ_c ≈ 4.417e-11 meters.

Convert to centimeters: 4.417e-11 m = 4.417e-9 cm, because 1e-11 m * 1e2 cm/m = 1e-9 cm.

So 4.417e-9 cm, which is approximately 4.42e-9 cm.

Looking at the options, E's third value is 4.43e-9 cm, which is very close.

So putting it together:

(a) ~2.38e-37 cm → option E's first value is 2.4e-37.

(b) ~1.3e-27 cm → E's second is 1.3e-27.

(c) ~4.42e-9 cm → E's third is 4.43e-9.

So the correct option is E.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Alternative approach: Let me compute each one again more accurately.

For (a):

λ_a = (6.626e-34) / (1e4 * 27.8) 

1e4 *27.8= 278000 = 2.78e5.

So 6.626e-34 / 2.78e5 = (6.626 /2.78) * 1e-39.

6.626 ÷ 2.78 → 2.383.

So 2.383e-39 m = 2.383e-37 cm. So yeah, about 2.38e-37 cm, which is option E's first value 2.4e-37. Close enough.

For (b):

λ_b = 6.626e-34 / (5e-5 *1) = 6.626e-34 / 5e-5 = 1.325e-29 m = 1.325e-27 cm. Option E's second is 1.3e-27. Correct.

For (c):

λ_c = 6.626e-34 / (3e-26 *500) = 6.626e-34 / (1.5e-23) = approx 4.417e-11 m = 4.417e-9 cm. Option E's third is 4.43e-9. Close enough.

So yes, option E is correct.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelengths of the given objects, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{m \cdot v}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( m \) is the mass of the object, and \( v \) is its velocity. The wavelengths are to be expressed in centimeters, so conversions from meters to centimeters are performed by multiplying by \( 100 \).

### Part (a): 10,000 kg truck moving at 27.8 m/s
- Mass: \( m_a = 10,000 \, \text{kg} = 1 \times 10^4 \, \text{kg} \)
- Velocity: \( v_a = 27.8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Momentum: \( m_a \cdot v_a = 1 \times 10^4 \cdot 27.8 = 2.78 \times 10^5 \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
- Wavelength: 
  \[
  \lambda_a = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2.78 \times 10^5} = 2.383 \times 10^{-39} \, \text{m} = 2.383 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm}
  \]
  This matches the first value in option **E**: \( 2.4 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm} \).

### Part (b): 50 mg flea flying at 1 m/s
- Mass: \( m_b = 50 \, \text{mg} = 50 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{kg} = 5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg} \)
- Velocity: \( v_b = 1 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Momentum: \( m_b \cdot v_b = 5 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 1 = 5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
- Wavelength:
  \[
  \lambda_b = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{5 \times 10^{-5}} = 1.325 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m} = 1.325 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{cm}
  \]
  This matches the second value in option **E**: \( 1.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{cm} \).

### Part (c): Water molecule moving at 500 m/s
- Mass of a water molecule: \( m_c = \frac{0.018 \, \text{kg/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}} = 2.988 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \)
- Velocity: \( v_c = 500 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Momentum: \( m_c \cdot v_c = 2.988 \times 10^{-26} \cdot 500 = 1.494 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
- Wavelength:
  \[
  \lambda_c = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.494 \times 10^{-23}} = 4.43 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m} = 4.43 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{cm}
  \]
  This matches the third value in option **E**: \( 4.43 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{cm} \).

### Final Answer
The calculated wavelengths for (a), (b), and (c) are \( 2.4 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm} \), \( 1.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{cm} \), and \( 4.43 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{cm} \), respectively. These values correspond to option **E**.
