Question:

What is meant by the term marginal costs?

Options:

A: the cost of all produced units
B: the fixed cost associated with the production facility
C: the cost of total production
D: the cost of initial unit of production
E: the additional cost of one more unit of production
F: the total revenue generated from the sale of one additional unit
G: the average cost of all units produced
H: the cost savings realized from producing one additional unit
I: the difference in cost between two levels of production
J: the cost of raw materials for all units produced

Okay, so I have this question about marginal costs, and I need to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what marginal costs mean. From what I remember, marginal costs have something to do with the cost of producing one more unit. Like, if a company is making widgets and they decide to make one extra widget, the cost of that one widget is the marginal cost. But wait, I should be careful because sometimes terms can be tricky.

Looking at the options:

Option A says "the cost of all produced units." That sounds more like total cost, not marginal. So probably not A.

Option B is "the fixed cost associated with the production facility." Fixed costs are things like rent or salaries that don't change with production levels. Marginal costs are more about variable costs, so B doesn't seem right.

Option C is "the cost of total production." Again, that's total cost, which includes fixed and variable costs. Not marginal.

Option D: "the cost of initial unit of production." That's the first unit. I don't think that's what marginal costs refer to. Marginal is about the next unit, not the first.

Option E: "the additional cost of one more unit of production." Oh, this rings a bell. Marginal cost is the extra cost for producing one more unit. So E looks correct.

Option F talks about total revenue from an additional unit. That's marginal revenue, not cost. So F is out.

Option G is average cost, which is total cost divided by the number of units. Not marginal.

Option H: cost savings from producing one more unit. That doesn't sound right. Marginal cost is an additional cost, not a saving.

Option I: difference in cost between two production levels. Well, marginal cost is the change when you produce one more unit. So it's a specific case of I. But I think the more precise term is E, which is about one additional unit, not just any two levels.

Option J is about raw materials for all units. That's part of variable costs, but not specifically the marginal cost, which is the cost of one more unit.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E.

The term "marginal costs" refers to the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of a good or service. It is a key concept in economics, particularly in understanding production decisions and cost structures. Among the given options:

- **A, C, G, J**: These relate to total costs, average costs, or costs of materials for all units, which are not the same as marginal costs.
- **B, D, H, I**: These describe fixed costs, initial unit costs, cost savings, or general differences in costs, which also do not align with the definition of marginal costs.
- **E**: This correctly identifies marginal costs as the additional cost of producing one more unit, making it the accurate choice.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: the additional cost of one more unit of production.**

Answer: E
