Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the semi-major axis of an asteroid's orbit. Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws are involved in orbital mechanics. Let me think about what each part means.

The problem says the asteroid Pallas has an orbital period of 4.62 years and an eccentricity of 0.233. But wait, I think Kepler's third law relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis, and the eccentricity affects the shape but not the size directly. So maybe I can use Kepler's law here.

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. The formula is usually written as P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. But since we're dealing with the same central body (I assume it's the Sun because it's an asteroid), the proportionality constant should be the same. Oh right, when using astronomical units and years, the formula simplifies. 

Wait, I think in units where the period is in Earth years, the semi-major axis in AU, the formula becomes P² = a³. But wait, that's for when the mass is the Sun's mass, right? So yeah, for an object orbiting the Sun, the formula is a³ = (P²) * (G * M_sun)^(1/3) but in AU and years, the constants might cancel out. Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused.

Let me get this straight. The actual formula in SI units would involve G and the mass of the Sun, which I can plug in, but it's easier to use the version where if P is in years and a is in AU, then P² = a³. But wait, that's only true for Earth's orbit, because 1 AU and 1 year make P² = a³ equal to 1. So for any other orbit, same central body, same proportionality holds. So a³ = P² where P is in years and a in AU. But wait, wait, that would mean a = (P²)^(1/3). So for example, Earth's P is 1 year, so a is 1 AU. If something has a period of 4 years, a would be cube root of 16, which is about 2.52 AU. 

But wait, the problem gives the period in years, and the answer is supposed to be in 10^11 meters. So I can't directly use the simplified formula because the units would be in AU. I think I need to calculate using Kepler's law in units that give meters.

So the correct formula is P² = (4π² * a³) / (G(M)), where M is the mass of the Sun. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact expression. Let me recall the precise version.

Kepler's third law in SI units is P² = (4π² a³) / (G(M+m)). Since the asteroid's mass is negligible compared to the Sun, M+m ≈ M. So P² = (4π² a³)/(G M). 

I need to find 'a' in meters. So rearranging the formula:

a³ = (G M P²) / (4 π²)

Then a = [ (G M P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But wait, what are the values for G, M (mass of Sun), and P?

Let's list the known constants:

G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

Mass of Sun, M = 1.9885e30 kg

P is given as 4.62 years. I need to convert that into seconds because G is in seconds.

So first, convert P from years to seconds.

One year is about 365.25 days. Each day has 24 hours, each hour 3600 seconds. So:

P = 4.62 years * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour

Let me compute that:

4.62 * 365.25 = let's see, 4 * 365 = 1460, 0.62 * 365 = 226.3, so total about 1686.3 days? Wait wait, 365.25 *4.62.

Wait, 4.62 * 365 = 4*365=1460, 0.62*365=225.7, total 1460+225.7=1685.7, plus 0.25*4.62 = about 1.155, so total about 1686.855 days.

Then 1686.855 days * 24 hours/day = 40564.52 hours.

40564.52 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = let's compute that.

40564.52 * 3600. Let's approximate:

40,000 * 3600 = 144,000,000.

564.52 *3600 = 2,034,672.

Total: 144e6 + 2.034e6 = 146,034,672 seconds.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

4.62 * 365.25 = ?

365.25 *4 = 1461, 365.25 *0.62 = 365.25 *0.6=219.15, 365.25 *0.02=7.305. So 219.15+7.305=226.455. Total P in days: 1461 + 226.455=1687.455 days.

Then multiply by 86400 seconds/day (since 24*3600=86400).

So 1687.455 * 86400 = ?

Let me compute that:

1687 * 86400 = let's see, 1000*86400=86,400,000.

600*86,400=51,840,000. 80*86,400=6,912,000. 7*86,400=604,800.

So adding 86,400,000 +51,840,000=138,240,000.

138,240,000 +6,912,000=145,152,000.

145,152,000 +604,800=145,756,800.

Then the 0.455 days: 0.455 *86,400 = let's compute.

0.4 *86400=34,560.

0.05 *86400=4,320.

0.005 *86400=432.

Adding: 34,560 +4,320=38,880 +432=39,312.

Total seconds: 145,756,800 +39,312 = 145,796,112 seconds.

Wait, that's more precise, but maybe I can just proceed with 4.62 years in seconds as approximately 145,796,000 seconds. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, to compute 4.62 * 365.25 = let me compute accurately:

365.25 *4.62:

Multiply 365.25 by 4, which is 1461.00.

365.25 *0.6 = 219.15.

365.25 *0.02 = 7.305.

Adding 1461 +219.15=1680.15 +7.305=1687.455 days.

Yes, that's correct. So 1687.455 days * 86400 sec/day = let's compute.

1687.455 *86400 = 

Let me compute 1687 *86400 = ?

Compute 1600 *86400 = 1600*8.64e4= 13,824,000,000? Wait, wait, 1600 *86400 = 1600 *8.64e4 = 1.6e3 *8.64e4 = (1.6*8.64) * 1e7.

1.6 *8 = 12.8, 1.6*0.64=1.024, so 12.8+1.024=13.824. So 13.824e7, which is 138,240,000.

Then 87.455 *86400:

Wait, wait, wait. 1687.455 is 1687 + 0.455. I've already done 1687 *86400.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial approach was to compute 1687.455 days *86400 sec/day. So 1687.455 × 86,400.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute as (4.62 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600) seconds.

Let me compute:

4.62 * 365.25 = 4.62 * 365.25.

Well, 4 *365.25=1461, 0.62 *365.25= 226.455. So total 1461+226.455=1687.455 days.

Each day is 86400 seconds, so 1687.455 * 86400 = ?

Let me compute 1687.455 * 86400.

I can compute 1687.455 * 8.64e4.

Alternatively, 1687.455 * 8.64e4 = 1687.455 * 86400.

But perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Wait, maybe I can use approximate values. Let me proceed.

So P in seconds is approximately 1687.455 * 86400 = let me compute 1687.455 * 86400.

Compute 1687 *86400 = 145, 756,800 (as earlier). Then 0.455 *86400 = 39,312. So total P = 145,756,800 + 39,312 = 145,796,112 seconds.

So P² is (145,796,112)^2. That's a big number. Let me think if I can compute a³ in terms of that.

Now, the formula is a³ = [G * M * P²]/(4 π²)

So plug in the numbers:

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

M = 1.9885e30 kg

P is 145,796,112 s

So compute numerator: G * M * P²

Denominator: 4 * π².

Let me compute numerator step by step.

First, compute G * M: 6.6743e-11 * 1.9885e30 = 

6.6743e-11 * 1.9885e30 = 6.6743 *1.9885e19.

Compute 6.6743 *1.9885:

6 * 2 =12, but more accurately:

6.6743 *1.9885 ≈ let's calculate:

6 *1.9885 =11.931

0.6743 *1.9885 ≈ approx 1.341.

So total about 11.931 +1.341 ≈13.272.

So 13.272e19 = 1.3272e20.

Now, multiply by P squared (P²):

P is 1.45796112e8 seconds.

So P² = (1.45796112e8 )² = (approx 1.458e8)^2 = about 2.124e16 s².

So G*M*P² = 1.3272e20 * 2.124e16.

Multiply exponents: 1e20 * 1e16 =1e36. Coefficients: 1.3272 *2.124 ≈ 2.815.

So G*M*P² ≈ 2.815e36 m³ s⁻².

Now, denominator is 4 π².

4 * (π^2) ≈4 *9.8696 ≈39.478.

So a³ = numerator / denominator = (2.815e36) / 39.478 ≈7.13e34 m³.

Then a is cube root of 7.13e34 m³.

Cube root of 7.13e34.

Let me express 7.13e34 as 713e32 = 71.3e33.

So cube root of 71.3e33 m³.

Cube root of 71.3 is about 4.14 (since 4^3=64, 4.1^3=68.921, 4.2^3=74.088). So 71.3 is between 4.1 and 4.2.

Compute 4.1^3 = 68.921.

4.15^3 = ?

4.15^3: 4^3=64, 3*(4^2)*0.15= 3*16*0.15=7.2, 3*(4)*(0.15)^2=3*4*0.0225=0.27, (0.15)^3=0.003375.

So 4.15^3 =64 +7.2 +0.27 +0.003375 =71.473375.

Wait, that's close to 71.3. So 4.15^3 is about 71.47, which is a bit higher than 71.3. So perhaps a is about 4.14 or 4.15.

But wait, the exponent is 33. So 4.14e (33/3) = 4.14e11 meters.

Because 1e33 is (1e11)^3.

So a ≈4.14e11 meters.

Wait, but let me double-check the cube root calculation.

We have a³ =7.13e34 m³.

Wait, no, wait: a³ is 7.13e34 m³? No, wait, earlier I said 7.13e34 is 71.3e33, so cube root is (71.3)^(1/3) * 1e11 m.

Because (1e33)^(1/3) is 1e11.

So (71.3)^(1/3) is around 4.14, so a ≈4.14e11 meters.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.15, which is very close. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, earlier I thought a is about 4.14e11 m, but the options are given in 1e11 m. So the answer would be 4.14, which is option I:4.15. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the steps.

Another approach: Use Kepler's law in AU and years, then convert to meters.

Because sometimes that's easier.

Using P in years (4.62) and a in AU.

Kepler's law: P² = a³ → a = (P²)^(1/3) → a = (4.62²)^(1/3).

Compute 4.62 squared: 4.62 *4.62.

4*4=16, 4*0.62=2.48, 0.62*4=2.48, 0.62^2=0.3844.

So (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=4, b=0.62.

So (4.62)^2 = 16 + 2*(4)(0.62) + (0.62)^2.

=16 + 4.96 +0.3844 = 21.3444.

So a³ = P² → a = (21.3444)^(1/3).

What is the cube root of 21.3444?

3^3=27, 2.7^3=19.683, 2.8^3=21.952.

So 2.8^3=21.952, which is a bit higher than 21.3444.

So 2.8^3=21.952.

We have 21.3444, which is between 2.7^3 (19.683) and 2.8^3.

Compute 2.75^3: 2.75 *2.75 =7.5625. 7.5625 *2.75:

7 *2.75=19.25, 0.5625 *2.75=1.546875. So total 19.25 +1.546875=20.796875.

2.75^3=20.7969.

Our a³ is 21.3444, which is larger than 20.7969.

So between 2.75 and 2.8.

Compute 2.77^3:

2.77 *2.77 = let's compute:

(2 +0.77)^2 =4 + 2*2*0.77 +0.77²=4 +3.08 +0.5929=7.6729.

Now, 7.6729 *2.77:

Multiply 7 *2.77=19.39.

0.6729 *2.77: approximately, 0.6 *2.77=1.662, 0.0729*2.77≈0.2016. So total ≈1.662 +0.2016=1.8636.

So total 19.39 +1.8636≈21.2536.

So 2.77^3≈21.2536, which is very close to 21.3444.

So the cube root of 21.3444 is approximately 2.77 AU.

So a ≈2.77 AU.

Wait, but wait. 1 AU is about 1.496e11 meters. So 2.77 AU = 2.77 *1.496e11 m.

Compute that:

2 *1.496e11=2.992e11.

0.77 *1.496e11: 0.7 *1.496e11=1.0472e11, 0.07 *1.496e11≈0.1047e11. So total 1.0472e11 +0.1047e11=1.1519e11.

So 2.992e11 +1.1519e11=4.1439e11 meters.

So approximately 4.14e11 meters, which is 4.14 when expressed in units of 1e11 m. That's option I:4.15.

Wait, but in the first method, using SI units, I got about 4.14e11, which matches this result.

So the semi-major axis is approximately 4.14e11 meters, which is 4.14 in terms of 1e11 m. Looking at the options, option I is 4.15, which is very close.

But wait, the options given are:

Options:

A:5.55

B:5.20

C:6.25

D:3.98
