Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about calculating the heat transferred when 100J of work is done on a system consisting of 1 mole of an ideal gas. It also mentions that at constant temperature, the change in internal energy (ΔE) is zero for the expansion of an ideal gas. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that the first law of thermodynamics is involved here. The first law states that the change in internal energy (ΔE) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W). So the formula is ΔE = Q - W.

Wait, wait, but wait. I've seen different conventions regarding the sign of work. I think it's important to clarify that. In physics, often work done by the system is considered positive, and work done on the system is negative. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that work is done on the system. So if the system is the gas, and work is done on it, that should be positive work. Or wait, no, let me think again. In the formula, work done by the system is positive. So if work is done on the system, W would be negative, right?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The formula is usually ΔE = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. Or is it ΔE = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system? I get confused sometimes.

Wait, let me think again. The first law is often written as ΔE = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So when the system does work on the surroundings, W is positive, and when work is done on the system, W is negative.

In this problem, work is done on the system, so W is negative. So W would be -100 J. Because the system is having work done on it.

Wait, no, no. I think I mixed it up. Let me get this straight. When work is done on the system, the work W in the equation is positive. Because the system is gaining energy. Wait, no. Let me think about it.

If the system does work on the surroundings, like expanding a gas, that's work done by the system. So W is positive, and thus in the equation ΔE = Q - W, W is subtracted. But if work is done on the system, like compressing the gas, then W is negative. So the formula becomes ΔE = Q - (-100 J) → ΔE = Q + 100 J.

But wait, the problem says the system is having work done on it, so W (work done by the system) is negative. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula as ΔE = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should clarify the signs as per the problem. Let's approach it step by step.

The system is an ideal gas. We have 1 mole of it. The work done on the system is 100 J. So the work W is positive 100 J because the surroundings are doing work on the gas.

But wait, the first law formula is ΔE = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system is the gas, and work is done on it, that means the system is not doing work, so W (done by system) is negative. So inserting W = -100 J.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. If the system (gas) does work, like expanding, that's positive W. If work is done on the system, like in compression, then W is negative. So in this case, work done on the system is +100 J, so W in the formula would be -100 J because it's work done on, not by.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as W being the work done by the system. So if work is done on the system, then W is negative.

So in the equation ΔE = Q - W.

Here, ΔE is given as 0 because it's at constant temperature for an ideal gas. So 0 = Q - W.

But wait, what's the value of W here? Since work is done on the system, the system is not doing work, so W is negative. So W is -100 J.

Plugging into the equation: 0 = Q - (-100 J) → 0 = Q + 100 J → Q = -100 J.

Wait, but that would imply that the heat is -100 J. So heat is released from the system. So is that possible?

Wait, let me think again. Let's make sure I'm not messing up the signs.

Another approach: The work done on the system is positive in the formula where ΔE = Q + W, with W being work done on the system.

Alternatively, using the standard formula ΔE = Q - W, where W is work done by the system.

So, since the system is the gas, and work is done on it, the system isn't doing work. So W (work done by the system) is negative. So inserting W = -100 J.

ΔE is zero because temperature is constant for ideal gas.

So 0 = Q - (-100 J) → Q = -100 J.

So the heat Q is -100 J. Which would mean that heat is being released from the system.

Wait, but let me think about the physical process. If the gas is at constant temperature and work is being done on it, which implies that it's being compressed. So when you compress a gas at constant temperature, the internal energy doesn't change (ΔE=0). So the heat must flow out of the system to compensate for the work done on it.

So the system is losing heat, so Q is negative. So the heat transferred is -100 J.

Wait, but the question is about the heat transferred when 100 J of work is done on the system. So the answer would be -100 J, which is option A.

But wait, the options are:

A: -100J

B: 200J

C: 150J

D: -200J

E: 50J

F: -150J

G: -50J

H: 0J

I: 100J

J: 250J

So option A is -100 J, which matches what I calculated.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. If work is done on the system, which is positive, and ΔE is zero, then the heat must be negative, so Q is negative. So the system loses heat. So the heat transferred is -100 J.

So the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we use the first law of thermodynamics, which states:

\[
\Delta E = Q - W
\]

where:
- \( \Delta E \) is the change in internal energy,
- \( Q \) is the heat transferred to the system,
- \( W \) is the work done by the system.

### Key Information:
1. The system consists of 1 mole of an ideal gas.
2. Work done **on** the system is \( +100 \, \text{J} \).
3. At constant temperature, \( \Delta E = 0 \) for an ideal gas.

### Sign Convention:
- Work done **by** the system is positive (\(+W\)).
- Work done **on** the system is negative (\(-W\)).

Since the problem specifies that work is done **on** the system, \( W = -100 \, \text{J} \).

### Substituting into the First Law:
\[
\Delta E = Q - W
\]
\[
0 = Q - (-100 \, \text{J})
\]
\[
0 = Q + 100 \, \text{J}
\]
\[
Q = -100 \, \text{J}
\]

### Interpretation:
The negative sign of \( Q \) indicates that heat is **released** from the system. This makes sense because when work is done on the system (e.g., compressing the gas) at constant temperature, the internal energy does not change (\( \Delta E = 0 \)), so the heat must flow out of the system to balance the energy.

### Final Answer:
The heat transferred is \( -100 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to **option A**.
