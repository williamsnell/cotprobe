Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a parachutist's terminal velocity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that terminal velocity is the maximum speed an object reaches when the force of gravity pulling it down is balanced by the force of air resistance pushing up. So, the equation should be something like the weight equals the drag force.

The parachutist's weight is given as 175 lb. Wait, pounds are a unit of force, right? So that's the force due to gravity. But sometimes when dealing with mass in physics, we might need to convert that to mass. But maybe I don't need to do that here because the formula might work directly with force.

The formula for drag force is 0.5 * density * velocity squared * drag coefficient * area. Oh wait, right, the drag force equation is F_d = ½ ρ v² C_d A. And at terminal velocity, F_d equals the weight, which is 175 lb.

So setting them equal: 175 = 0.5 * ρ * v_t² * C_d * A.

But wait, the units might be tricky here. The parachutist is in the English system, so pounds, feet, etc. Let me check the units for each variable.

The density of air is given at 70°F. Looking at the table, at 70°F, the density is 0.0750 lbm per cubic foot. Wait, but in the formula, the density should be in slugs per cubic foot because the standard unit for density in the English system for these equations is slugs/ft³. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Oh, right. The drag equation in English units can use lbm/ft³, but then you have to adjust the units because of the way force is calculated. Alternatively, since the parachutist's weight is in pounds-force, I'll probably need to convert density into slugs per cubic foot. Because in the formula, F_d in pounds would require the density to be in slugs.

Looking at the table, at 70°F, the density is 0.0750 lbm/ft³, which converts to 0.0750 / (32.174) slugs/ft³. Wait, because 1 slug is 32.174 lbm. So 0.0750 lbm/ft³ divided by 32.174 gives me the density in slugs/ft³.

Wait, but the table actually gives ρ in both lbm/ft³ and slugs/ft³ ×10^3. Oh, wait, no. The second column is slugs/ft³ multiplied by 10^3. So at 70°F, the slugs per cubic foot is 2.33 ×10^-3 slugs/ft³. Because in the table, for 70°F, the second column says 2.33 under slugs/ft³ ×10^3. So that's 2.33e-3 slugs/ft³, right?

So ρ is 2.33e-3 slugs/ft³.

The frontal area A is 2 ft². So that's straightforward.

The drag coefficient C_d is 0.80.

Now plug all into the equation:

175 = 0.5 * ρ * v² * C_d * A

We can rearrange this to solve for v:

v = sqrt( (2 * 175) / (ρ * C_d * A) )

Wait, let me recheck. The equation is:

F_d = 0.5 * ρ * v² * C_d * A.

At terminal velocity, F_d equals weight, which is 175 lb.

So 175 = 0.5 * ρ * v² * 0.8 * 2.

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.5 * ρ * 0.8 * 2.

Wait, 0.5 * 0.8 is 0.4, and 0.4 * 2 is 0.8. So denominator is 0.8 * ρ.

Wait no, perhaps I should structure it correctly. Let me write it step by step.

175 = 0.5 * ρ * v² * C_d * A.

So, solving for v²:

v² = (2 * 175) / (ρ * C_d * A)

Then v = sqrt( (2 * 175) / (ρ * 0.8 * 2) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. ρ is 2.33e-3 slugs/ft³. A is 2 ft². C_d is 0.8.

So the denominator becomes ρ * C_d * A = 2.33e-3 * 0.8 * 2.

Compute that: 2.33e-3 * 0.8 = 1.864e-3, multiplied by 2 is 3.728e-3.

So v² = (2 * 175) / 3.728e-3.

Compute numerator: 2 * 175 = 350.

So v² = 350 / 3.728e-3.

Let me compute that. 350 divided by 0.003728.

Let me compute 350 / 0.003728.

Hmm, 0.003728 is 3.728e-3. So 350 / 3.728e-3 = 350 / 0.003728.

Let me compute this division. 350 divided by 0.003728.

I can write this as 350 * (1/0.003728). 1/0.003728 is approximately 268.3. Because 0.003728 times 268 is about 1. Let me check: 0.003728 * 268 = ?

0.003728 * 200 = 0.7456.

0.003728 * 68 = approx 0.003728 *70=0.261, minus 0.003728*2=0.007456, so 0.261 -0.007456=0.2535.

So total is 0.7456 + 0.2535=0.9991, which is about 1. So 1/0.003728 ≈ 268.3.

So 350 * 268.3 ≈ ?

350 * 268 = 350*200=70,000; 350*68=23,800. So total 93,800. Then 350 *0.3=105, so total 93,905.

So v squared is approximately 93,905. So v is sqrt(93905).

What's the square root of 93,905?

Well, sqrt(90,000)=300, since 300^2=90,000. 305^2=93,025. Because 300^2=90k, 305^2= (300+5)^2=90,000 + 2*300*5 +25= 90,000 + 3000 +25=93,025.

93,905 is 93,025 + 880. So 305^2 is 93025.

Compute 306^2= (305+1)^2= 305^2 + 2*305 +1=93025 + 610 +1=93636.

But 93,905 is between 305^2 and 306^2.

Compute the difference: 93,905 -93,025=880.

Between 305 (93,025) and 306 (93,636). The difference between 93,636 and 93,025 is 611.

So 880 is 880/611 ≈ 1.44 of the way from 305 to 306.

So approximately, v ≈ 305 + 1.44*(1) ≈ 306.44. Wait, no, since 611 is the total, 880 is more than that. Wait, no, 611 is the difference between 305^2 and 306^2. Wait, 306^2 is 93,636, which is 611 higher than 93,025.

So 93,905 is 93,025 + 880. So 880 is less than 611? No, 880 is larger than 611. Because 611 is 611, and 880-611=269. So 880 is 611 +269.

Wait, so 93,025 +611=93,636 (which is 306^2). So 93,905 is 93,636 +269. So that's 306^2 +269.

So the square root would be 306 + 269/(2*306) approximately, using the linear approximation.

Because sqrt(a^2 + b) ≈ a + b/(2a).

So 269/(2*306) ≈ 269/612 ≈ 0.44.

So sqrt(93,905) ≈ 306 +0.44 ≈306.44.

Wait, that can't be, because 306.44^2 is approx (306 +0.44)^2=306^2 + 2*306*0.44 +0.44^2=93636 + 269.28 +0.1936≈93905.47, which matches our value. So v≈306.44 ft/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is E:307 fps. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator.

Let me go back to the equation:

v² = (2 * W) / (ρ * C_d * A)

Wait, W is 175 lb.

So 2 * 175 = 350.

Denominator: ρ=2.33e-3 slugs/ft³, C_d=0.8, A=2 ft².

So denominator is 2.33e-3 * 0.8 * 2.

Compute 2.33e-3 *0.8= 1.864e-3.

Then 1.864e-3 *2=3.728e-3.

So denominator is 3.728e-3.

v²=350 / 3.728e-3 = 350 / 0.003728.

As before, which is 93,905. So v is sqrt(93,905)= approx 306.4 ft/s. So about 306 fps.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: 307 fps. But let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 200 fps

B: 220 fps

C: 325 fps

D: 250 fps

E: 307 fps

F: 400 fps

G: 275 fps

H: 350 fps

I: 450 fps

J: 365 fps.

So 306 is closest to E:307, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me make sure the air density is correct.

Wait, the table gives for 70°F, the slugs/ft³ ×10^3 is 2.33. So that's 2.33e-3 slugs/ft³.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 350 / 0.003728 more accurately.

Let me compute 350 / 0.003728.

I can write 0.003728 as 3.728e-3.

So 350 / 3.728e-3 = 350 * (1/3.728e-3) = 350 * (1000/3.728) ≈ 350 * 268.333.

Wait, 3.728 * 268.3 = 3.728 * 268 = let's compute 3.728 *200=745.6, 3.728 *68=253. 184 (because 3.728*60=223.68 and 3.728*8=29.824 → 223.68+29.824=253.504). So 745.6+253.504=999.104. So 3.728 *268.3≈ 1000.

So, 1/3.728≈ 0.2683.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1/3.728.

But perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, 350 / 0.003728.

Let me write this division as 350 ÷ 0.003728.

I can use long division.

But maybe a quicker way is to note that 0.003728 is 3728e-6.

Wait, 0.003728 = 3.728e-3.

So 350 / 3.728e-3 = 350 * (1e3)/3.728 → 350,000 / 3.728.

Hmm, 350,000 ÷ 3.728.

Let me compute 3.728 * 93,000 = ?

Wait, 3.728 * 93,000 = 3.728 *9.3e4.

Wait, 3.728 *93,000.

Wait, 3.728 *90,000= 335,520.

3.728 *3,000=11,184.

So total is 335,520 +11,184=346,704.

But 350,000 is more than that. So 93,000 gives 346,704.

The difference is 350,000 -346,704=3,296.

Now, 3.728 * x =3,296 → x=3,296 /3.728 ≈ 884.5.

So total is 93,000 + 884.5=93,884.5.

So 3.728 * 93,884.5 ≈350,000. So 350,000 /3.728=approx 93,884.5.

So v²=93,884.5 → v= sqrt(93884.5)= approx 306.4 ft/s, same as before.

So the terminal velocity is approximately 306.4 ft/s, which is very close to 307 ft/s, option E.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is 307, so that's the correct answer. So I think the correct choice is E.
</think>

To determine the parachutist's terminal velocity, we use the relationship where the weight equals the drag force at terminal velocity. The drag force is given by:

\[
F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A
\]

At terminal velocity, \( F_d = W \), where \( W = 175 \, \text{lb} \). Rearranging for \( v \):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2W}{\rho C_d A}}
\]

### Step 1: Extract known values
- \( W = 175 \, \text{lb} \)
- \( C_d = 0.80 \)
- \( A = 2 \, \text{ft}^2 \)
- From the table, at \( 70^\circ \text{F} \), \( \rho = 2.33 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{slugs/ft}^3 \).

### Step 2: Plug values into the equation
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 175}{2.33 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.80 \cdot 2}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
\rho \cdot C_d \cdot A = 2.33 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.80 \cdot 2 = 3.728 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:
\[
2 \cdot 175 = 350
\]

Thus:
\[
v^2 = \frac{350}{3.728 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{350}{0.003728} \approx 93,905
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
v = \sqrt{93,905} \approx 306.4 \, \text{fps}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated terminal velocity is approximately \( 306.4 \, \text{fps} \), which is closest to option **E: 307 fps**.

Answer: E
