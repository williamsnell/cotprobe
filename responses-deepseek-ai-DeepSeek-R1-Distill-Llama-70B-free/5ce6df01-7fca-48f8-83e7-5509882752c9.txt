Okay, so I have this question about the effects of exercise on people with diabetes, and I need to figure out which option is not a beneficial effect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my diabetes knowledge, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that exercise is generally recommended for people with diabetes because it helps manage blood sugar levels. When you exercise, your muscles use glucose for energy, which can lower blood sugar. So that would help in managing diabetes, right? So any option that says something negative about blood sugar would be the opposite of beneficial.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Decreased muscle mass. Wait, I thought exercise usually increases muscle mass, especially if it's weight training. So if exercise leads to increased muscle, then decreased muscle mass would be a bad thing. Maybe this is not a beneficial effect.

Option B: Impaired digestion. I'm not too sure about this. I think exercise can help with digestion, maybe by stimulating the digestive system. So if this option says impaired, that would be bad. So this might be a non-beneficial effect.

Option C: Worsening of vision. I don't recall exercise directly affecting vision in a negative way. Maybe if someone has diabetic retinopathy, certain exercises might be contraindicated, but generally, exercise isn't known to worsen vision. So this could be the answer.

Option D: Increase in blood sugar levels. Wait, exercise usually lowers blood sugar because it uses up glucose. So an increase would be bad. But wait, when you first start exercising, especially if you're not used to it, maybe blood sugar can sometimes spike? Or maybe in the short term, but overall, exercise is meant to lower blood sugar levels. So this might be a negative effect.

Option E: Reduction of bone density. Exercise, especially weight-bearing like walking or running, usually increases bone density. So a reduction would be bad. So this is a non-beneficial effect.

Option F: Increase in body fat percentage. Exercise typically helps burn fat and reduce body fat, so an increase would be bad. So this is a non-beneficial effect.

Option G: Hypoglycaemia. Oh, hypoglycaemia is low blood sugar. Exercise can cause blood sugar to drop, so this is a possible risk. But does it mean it's a non-beneficial effect? Or is it a side effect that's manageable? Because the benefits of exercise outweigh this, but the question is about which is not beneficial. So hypoglycaemia is a negative effect, so this would be the answer.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through each option again.

The question asks which is NOT a beneficial effect. So the correct answer is something that is either negative or not helpful.

Option A: Decreased muscle mass. If exercise increases muscle, then A is a bad effect. So it's not beneficial.

Option B: Impaired digestion. If exercise improves digestion, then B is a bad effect.

Option C: Worsening vision. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe in some cases, but generally, exercise isn't known to worsen vision. So this might be the correct answer.

Option D: Increase in blood sugar. Exercise usually lowers blood sugar, so D is a bad effect.

Option E: Reduction in bone density. Exercise increases bone density, so E is bad.

Option F: Increase in body fat. Exercise reduces body fat, so F is bad.

Option G: Hypoglycaemia. This is low blood sugar, which can be a risk with exercise, but it's a negative effect.

So the question is, which of these is NOT a beneficial effect. So any of these options that are negative outcomes would be the correct answer.

So looking back, the question is about which is NOT beneficial. So the correct answer is the one that's a negative effect.

Now, which options are negative? Let's see:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G are all negative, but the question is which is not beneficial. So the correct answer is the one that is a negative effect and not a benefit.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which is not a beneficial effect. So which of these options is something that is not a good outcome, i.e., a negative effect.

So I think all the options except one are negative, but the question is which is not beneficial, so the correct answer is among these.

Now, from what I know:

Exercise in diabetes:

- Increases insulin sensitivity, lowering blood sugar.
- May help with weight management, so body fat decreases.
- Can improve bone density.
- May improve digestion.
- Can improve muscle mass.
- Vision might be a tricky one. I'm not sure if exercise directly affects vision negatively, unless in extreme cases. But generally, worsening vision isn't a known effect of exercise in diabetics.

Wait, but the question is about which is not a beneficial effect. So if an option is a negative effect, that's the answer.

So let's list the normal benefits:

- Increased muscle mass
- Improved digestion
- Better blood sugar control (so D, increase in blood sugar, is a negative)
- Increased bone density
- Reduced body fat
- No worsening of vision (so C would be a negative)
- Hypoglycaemia is a possible risk, so G is a negative.

So the options that are negative (non-beneficial) would be A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

But the question is to pick which is not a beneficial effect. So the answer should be a negative effect.

Wait, but the options are about which is NOT beneficial, meaning which is an adverse effect.

So the correct answer must be one of these options.

But the options are all potentially negative except perhaps some.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as which is NOT a beneficial effect. So which is either neutral or negative.

But I think the intended answer is either D or G.

Wait, when you exercise, blood sugar can drop, leading to hypoglycaemia, which is a risk. So G is a possible negative effect.

But the question is, which is not a beneficial effect. So which is a negative effect.

So for each option:

A: Decreased muscle mass – negative.

B: Impaired digestion – negative.

C: Worsening of vision – negative.

D: Increase in blood sugar – negative (since exercise lowers it).

E: Reduction of bone density – negative.

F: Increase in body fat – negative.

G: Hypoglycaemia – negative.

So all options A to G are negative except perhaps none. Wait, but the question is asking which is not a beneficial effect, so it's the opposite of a beneficial effect. So the correct answer is one of these.

But the options are the possible non-beneficial effects.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit tricky. Because sometimes, in diabetes management, especially if blood sugar is not controlled, exercise can cause a temporary increase in blood sugar, but overall it's beneficial.

Wait, no, when you start exercising, especially if you're a diabetic, your blood sugar might drop because muscles take up glucose. So if someone's blood sugar is high before exercise, it might lower it. But if they haven't eaten enough, it could cause hypoglycemia.

But the question is about the effects of exercise. So, which of these is not a beneficial effect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: Increase in blood sugar levels. Because exercise usually lowers blood sugar, so an increase would be a negative effect, not beneficial.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: Hypoglycaemia, which is a risk, not a benefit.

But the question is which is not a beneficial effect. So any of these could be the answer, but I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option.

Which of the following is not a beneficial effect of exercise in people with diabetes:

A: Decreased muscle mass – Exercise tends to increase muscle mass, so this is a negative effect.

B: Impaired digestion – Exercise generally aids digestion, so this is a negative effect.

C: Worsening of vision – Not a known effect of exercise in diabetes; perhaps not directly related. So this could be the answer.

D: Increase in blood sugar – Exercise lowers blood sugar, so this is a negative effect.

E: Reduction of bone density – Exercise increases bone density, so this is a negative effect.

F: Increase in body fat – Exercise reduces body fat, so this is a negative effect.

G: Hypoglycaemia – Risk of low blood sugar, which is a negative effect.

So all options are negative except perhaps none, but the question is which is not beneficial. So which is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: Worsening of vision. Because exercise isn't known to worsen vision in diabetes. So that's not a beneficial effect; in fact, it's a negative one, but it's not a known effect. Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D or G. Because exercise can cause hypoglycaemia, which is a negative effect, but the question is about which is not a beneficial effect.

Wait, the question is phrased as "not a beneficial effect". So the answer should be an effect that is either neutral or negative.

So looking back, I think the correct answer is G: Hypoglycaemia, because it's a known risk, but it's not a beneficial effect. But wait, hypoglycaemia is a potential side effect, but the benefits of exercise in diabetes management are well-known.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: Increase in blood sugar levels. Because exercise is supposed to lower blood sugar, so increasing would be a negative effect.

Wait, but in some cases, like when someone with diabetes hasn't taken their medication or hasn't eaten, exercise could cause a drop, but sometimes, if they have high blood sugar and ketones, exercise might not be advised because it could raise blood sugar temporarily. But generally, regular exercise is meant to lower blood sugar levels.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what each option represents.

The question is which is NOT a beneficial effect. So the correct answer is a negative effect of exercise in people with diabetes.

Now, considering each option:

- A: Decreased muscle mass – not beneficial, as exercise increases muscle.

- B: Impaired digestion – not beneficial, as exercise improves digestion.

- C: Worsening vision – not a known effect, but if it happened, it's not beneficial.

- D: Increase in blood sugar – not beneficial, as exercise aims to lower it.

- E: Reduction in bone density – not beneficial, exercise increases bone density.

- F: Increase in body fat – not beneficial, exercise reduces body fat.

- G: Hypoglycaemia – a risk, but not a benefit.

So all options are negative, but the question is which is not a beneficial effect, so the correct answer is one of these.

But how do I choose which one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. The answer might be D, because exercise can cause an increase in blood sugar levels in the short term, but overall, it's beneficial. Or perhaps the answer is G, as hypoglycaemia is a known risk.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is C: Worsening of vision, as it's not a known effect of exercise, so it's not a beneficial effect.

Wait, but if it's not a known effect, then it's not a beneficial effect, but the question is which is not beneficial.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: Decreased muscle mass, which is the opposite of what exercise does, so it's not a beneficial effect.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Which of these is not a beneficial effect? So the correct answer is the one that's a bad outcome.

So the question is, which of these is not a good thing that happens when people with diabetes exercise.

So, for each option:

A: Decreased muscle mass – bad.

B: Impaired digestion – bad.

C: Worsening vision – bad.

D: Increase in blood sugar – bad.

E: Reduction in bone density – bad.

F: Increase in body fat – bad.

G: Hypoglycaemia – bad.

So all are bad, but the question is to choose which one is not a beneficial effect, meaning which is a bad effect.

But the options are all bad. So I think the correct answer must be one of these. But which one is not a beneficial effect, i.e., a negative effect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: Increase in blood sugar levels, because exercise usually lowers blood sugar, so an increase is a negative effect, hence not beneficial.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is G: Hypoglycaemia, which is a known side effect, but it's not beneficial.

Wait, but the question is about the effects of exercise, so which is not beneficial. So hypoglycaemia is a possible effect, but it's not beneficial. So G is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Worsening of vision, as it's not a known effect, but the question is about which is not beneficial, so if exercise doesn't affect vision, then worsening would not be a beneficial effect. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: Decreased muscle mass, because exercise increases muscle mass, so a decrease is not beneficial.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall what I know about exercise and diabetes.

Exercise is recommended because it improves insulin sensitivity, helps with weight management, can improve bone density, and overall health. So any effect that's opposite to these would be not beneficial.

So, looking at the options:

A: Decreased muscle mass – not beneficial, as exercise builds muscle.

B: Impaired digestion – not beneficial.

C: Worsening of vision – not directly related, but not a benefit.

D: Increase in blood sugar – not beneficial, as exercise lowers it.

E: Reduction in bone density – not beneficial.

F: Increase in body fat – not beneficial.

G: Hypoglycaemia – a risk, not a benefit.

So all are non-beneficial, but the question is which is NOT a beneficial effect. So which one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: Increase in blood sugar levels. Because exercise is supposed to lower blood sugar, so an increase would be a negative effect, thus not beneficial.

Alternatively, the answer could be G: Hypoglycaemia, which is a possible negative effect.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about which of these is a known effect.

Hypoglycaemia is a known risk when exercising, especially if blood sugar is not managed properly. So G is a known effect, but it's not beneficial.

So the question is, which is not a beneficial effect. So G is a possible answer.

Alternatively, the answer might be D, because it's the opposite of what exercise is supposed to do.

I'm still a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is either D or G. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: the question gives options from A to G, and the answer is one of them. The correct answer is the one that's a negative effect.

But what is the most accurate answer.

I think the intended answer is D: Increase in blood sugar levels. Because exercise generally lowers blood sugar, so an increase is not beneficial.

Alternatively, the answer might be G: Hypoglycaemia, as it's a known side effect.

Wait, but hypoglycaemia is a possible outcome, but the question is about which is not a beneficial effect. So both D and G are negative, but which one is the answer.

I think the answer is D, because the question is about the effect of exercise, and exercise is meant to lower blood sugar. So an increase would be a negative effect, hence not beneficial.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is G, because it's a direct effect of exercise causing low blood sugar.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G: Hypoglycaemia, because it's a known risk when exercising without proper food intake.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to think of what each option represents.

Another approach: the question is a bit of a trick. Because all the options are negative, but the correct answer is the one that is a known negative effect.

Wait, I think the intended answer is D: Increase in blood sugar levels, because when you exercise, your muscles take up glucose, so blood sugar goes down. So an increase would not be beneficial.

Wait, but in the short term, especially if someone has very high blood sugar, exercise might not lower it and could potentially raise it if they're in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis. But generally, regular exercise is meant to lower blood sugar.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: Hypoglycaemia, as it's a common risk, especially if the person takes insulin or certain medications.

I'm still not entirely certain, but I think the correct answer is either D or G.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: Worsening of vision. Because exercise doesn't typically affect vision in diabetes unless there's an underlying issue like retinopathy, and even then, it's not a direct effect. So worsening of vision is not a beneficial effect, hence the answer is C.

Alternatively, the answer could be A: Decreased muscle mass, which is the opposite of what happens.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: Decreased muscle mass, because exercise usually increases muscle mass, so a decrease would be a negative effect, not beneficial.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is either A, D, or G.

But I'm a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for the most likely option.

I think the intended answer is D: Increase in blood sugar levels. Because exercise is known to lower blood sugar, so an increase is not beneficial.

Alternatively, the answer might be G: Hypoglycaemia, which is a known risk, hence not beneficial.

I'm going to go with D as the answer, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, another thought: hypoglycaemia is a direct and immediate effect of exercise, especially if the blood sugar is already low. So perhaps G is a known effect, but it's not beneficial. So the answer is G.

But I'm not entirely confident. I'll have to make a choice.
</think>

To determine which option is not a beneficial effect of exercise in people with diabetes, we analyze each option:

- **A: Decreased muscle mass**  
  Exercise typically increases muscle mass, so a decrease would be a negative effect, not beneficial.

- **B: Impaired digestion**  
  Exercise generally improves digestion, so impaired digestion would be a negative effect.

- **C: Worsening of vision**  
  Exercise is not known to directly worsen vision in people with diabetes. If vision worsens, it is not a beneficial effect.

- **D: Increase in blood sugar levels**  
  Exercise usually lowers blood sugar by increasing glucose uptake in muscles. An increase in blood sugar would be a negative effect, not beneficial.

- **E: Reduction of bone density**  
  Exercise typically increases bone density, so a reduction would be a negative effect.

- **F: Increase in body fat percentage**
