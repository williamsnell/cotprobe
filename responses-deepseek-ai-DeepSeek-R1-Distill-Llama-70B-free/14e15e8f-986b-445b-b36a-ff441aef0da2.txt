Okay, so I've got this problem about an induction motor and I need to estimate its full-load performance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question gives me a lot of parameters. Let's jot them down:

- Power output (P2): 200 W
- Voltage (V1): 240 V
- Frequency (f): 50 Hz
- Number of poles (p): 4
- Slip (s): 0.05 p.u.

The motor parameters are:
- r1 = 11.4 Ω
- x1 = 14.5 Ω
- (1/2)r2 = 11.6 Ω (so r2 is 23.2 Ω in total)
- (1/2)x2 = 7.2 Ω (so x2 is 14.4 Ω)
- (1/2)xm = 135 Ω (so xm is 270 Ω)
- Core and mechanical losses: 32 W

I'm trying to find the full-load performance, which I think refers to the power factor or maybe efficiency. Since the options are all in p.u. and some are around 0.6 to 0.85, maybe it's the power factor we're after.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify what exactly to calculate. Oh, wait, the options are all p.u. values, so probably the power factor, as efficiency is usually a percentage or sometimes in p.u., but more likely power factor here.

So, full-load performance—probably the power factor when operating at full load (rated load) with the given slip.

Let me recall the equivalent circuit of an induction motor. The motor can be represented with the stator circuit and the rotor circuit connected via a slip-dependent impedance.

The standard equivalent circuit includes:

- Stator resistance (r1)
- Stator leakage reactance (x1)
- Magnetizing reactance (xm) which is in parallel
- Rotor resistance (r2/s) and leakage reactance (x2) in series.

Wait, but in the given parameters, they provided (1/2)r2 and (1/2)x2. Oh right, because the equivalent circuit often uses half the rotor resistance and reactance in each parallel branch since the rotor is usually wye-connected. So I need to account for that.

Wait no, actually, I think in the equivalent circuit, the rotor parameters are referred to the stator side. So, for a wye-connected rotor, the resistance and reactance would each be r2 and x2, but when considering the equivalent circuit, sometimes they're divided by 2 because of the way the wye connection works. Or wait, maybe that's for the starting current calculations. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed carefully.

Wait, the problem gives (1/2)r2 as 11.6 Ω, so r2 is 23.2 Ω. Similarly, (1/2)x2 is 7.2 Ω, so x2 is 14.4 Ω. So these are the actual rotor parameters before being adjusted for slip. But in the equivalent circuit, the rotor resistance is divided by slip s, and the reactance is multiplied by slip, but wait, no, the impedance is (r2/s) + j x2. Wait, no, x2 is the same as it's referred to the stator frequency.

Wait, let me get this straight. The rotor's induced voltage is slip (s) times the stator's voltage. So the rotor resistance is r2, but when referred to the stator side, in terms of the equivalent circuit, the resistance is r2/(s). Or wait, maybe it's r2/(s) in the equivalent circuit. Hmm, I might need to set up the equations properly.

The equivalent circuit for the rotor is (r2/s + j x2). But wait, when considering the magnetizing reactance, which is xm, and the stator's x1, the total impedance is a combination of these.

Wait, perhaps I should model the motor's impedance and then compute the power factor. The power factor is the real power divided by the apparent power.

Alternatively, the power factor can be found using the stator current components. The stator current has a real component (I1 cosθ) and a reactive component (I1 sinθ). The power factor is cosθ, which is the ratio of real power to apparent power.

So, to find the power factor, I need to compute the stator current's real and reactive parts.

Alternatively, I can compute the input power and the apparent power. The input power is the sum of the stator copper losses, the rotor copper losses, the core losses, and the mechanical power output. Wait, but maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, the problem says the motor is running on rated load, so the output power is 200 W. But the full-load performance usually refers to the power factor, so I think we need to compute the power factor at full load.

So, let's think about the equivalent circuit approach.

The stator impedance is Z1 = r1 + j x1.

The rotor impedance, referred to the stator side, is Z2 = (r2/s) + j x2.

But wait, in the equivalent circuit, the magnetizing branch (xm) is in parallel with the series combination of (Z1 + Z2). Wait no, the stator impedance is in series with the parallel combination of the magnetizing branch and the rotor branch.

Wait, no, the correct equivalent circuit is:

The stator's impedance (r1 + jx1) is in series with the parallel combination of the magnetizing reactance xm and the rotor impedance (r2/s + jx2). So the total impedance is:

Z_total = (r1 + jx1) + [ (r2/s + jx2) || (j xm) ]

Wait, no, actually, the entire motor's equivalent circuit is:

The stator resistance r1 and stator leakage reactance x1 are in series. Then, in parallel to that is a branch with the magnetizing reactance xm. The other parallel branch is the rotor's impedance, which is (r2/s) + jx2, but this is all referred to the stator side.

Wait, maybe my confusion arises because I'm mixing up the different equivalent circuits. Let me try to draw it mentally.

The standard equivalent circuit is shown as:

- Voltage source V1.

- In series: r1, x1.

- Then, in parallel: one branch is the magnetizing reactance xm, and the other branch is the rotor's impedance, which is (r2/s) in series with x2.

Wait, no, the rotor's impedance is (r2/s + j x2). So the equivalent circuit has:

- V1 connected to a series combination of r1 and x1.

- Then, after that series combination, in parallel: one branch is the magnetizing reactance xm, and the other is the rotor branch (r2/s + jx2).

So the total impedance is (r1 + jx1) + [ (r2/s + jx2) || jxm ]

Wait, no, actually, the stator's impedance (r1 + jx1) is in series with the parallel combination of the magnetizing branch (jxm) and the rotor branch (r2/s + jx2).

So yes, Z_total = (r1 + jx1) + [ (r2/s + jx2) || jxm ]

Once I have Z_total, I can compute the stator current I1 as V1 divided by Z_total.

Then, the power factor is the real part of I1 times V1, divided by the apparent power V1 * I1.

Alternatively, since I1 = V1 / Z_total, then the power factor (cosθ) is Re[Z_total]/|Z_total|.

Wait, no. Because power factor is the cosine of the angle between V and I. So if I1 is the current, then cosθ = Re(V1 * conj(I1)) / (|V1| |I1| )

But since V1 is the voltage, which is a real number (assuming it's at reference), then the angle of I1 is the same as the angle of Z_total. So cosθ is Re(I1*) / |I1|, which is Re(Z_total*) / |Z_total|.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the real and imaginary parts of the impedance and then find the power factor as Re(Z_total) / |Z_total|.

Alternatively, I can compute the input power (real power) and the apparent power (which is voltage times current magnitude), then power factor is input power divided by apparent power.

But that might require more steps. Hmm.

Wait, the input power is equal to the sum of the stator copper losses (I1² r1), the rotor copper losses (I2² r2), the core losses (given as 32 W), and the mechanical power output (200 W). But wait, I think that's not the right way because the power flow has to account for the slip.

Wait, the mechanical power output is (1 - s) times the rotor copper losses, because the rotor converts some power into mechanical form. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, the input power (P_in) is equal to the stator apparent power, which is V1 * I1. The real part of this is the real power supplied.

The real power supplied (P_real) is then used to cover the losses and the mechanical output. So:

P_real = P_core_losses + P_stator_cu_losses + P_rotor_cu_losses + P_mech_output

But wait, the core losses are given as 32 W. The stator copper losses are I1² r1. The rotor copper losses are I2² r2. And the mechanical output is 200 W.

Wait, but the rotor copper losses are being converted into heat and some into mechanical power. So that might not be the correct way to model it.

Alternatively, the mechanical power is (1 - s) times the air gap power. Hmm, maybe that's a better approach.

The air gap power is the power transferred from the stator to the rotor through the air gap, which is (r2/s) * I2^2. Then, the mechanical power is (1 - s) times that.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem gives the mechanical output as 200 W, which is the power available at the shaft, and the slip s = 0.05, I can use that to find the air gap power.

Wait, air gap power P_gap = (r2/s) * I2^2.

But also, P_mech = P_gap * (1 - s) = 200 W.

So P_gap = 200 / (1 - 0.05) = 200 / 0.95 ≈ 210.526 W.

Hmm, perhaps I can proceed this way.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the stator current and then find the power factor.

But perhaps the better approach is to calculate the stator current components.

Let me try that.

So, the motor's equivalent impedance can be broken down into two parts: the stator's own impedance (r1 and x1) and the parallel combination of the magnetizing reactance and the rotor's impedance.

Z_total = (r1 + j x1) + [ ( (r2/s) + j x2 ) || (j xm) ]

I need to compute this Z_total and then find the current I1 = V1 / Z_total.

Once I have I1, I can compute the real and reactive power and hence the power factor.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute each component's values.

Given:

r1 = 11.4 Ω

x1 = 14.5 Ω

r2 = 2 * 11.6 Ω = 23.2 Ω

x2 = 2 * 7.2 Ω = 14.4 Ω

xm = 2 * 135 Ω = 270 Ω

Slip s = 0.05.

So, the rotor's impedance is (r2/s) + j x2.

Calculating (r2/s):

23.2 Ω / 0.05 = 464 Ω.

x2 is 14.4 Ω.

So the rotor's impedance is 464 + j14.4 Ω.

Now, the magnetizing reactance is j xm = j 270 Ω.

So the parallel combination of (464 + j14.4) and (j270) is:

Let me represent them as complex numbers.

Z_rotor = 464 + j14.4

Z_mag = j270

The parallel combination is (Z_rotor * Z_mag) / (Z_rotor + Z_mag)

Which is:

[ (464 + j14.4) * (j270) ] / [ (464 + j14.4) + j270 ]

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator:

(464)(j270) + (j14.4)(j270)

= j (464*270) + j^2 (14.4*270)

= j 125,280 + (-1) * 3,888

= -3,888 + j 125,280

Denominator:

464 + j14.4 + j270 = 464 + j (14.4 + 270) = 464 + j284.4

So the parallel impedance is (-3888 + j125280) / (464 + j284.4)

This looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can compute it using complex division.

Alternatively, I'll compute the magnitude squared.

Let me compute the denominator's magnitude squared: (464)^2 + (284.4)^2.

464^2 = approx 464*464. 400^2=160000, 64^2=4096, 2*400*64=51200. So 160000 + 51200 + 4096 = 215296. Wait, no, 464 is 400+64, so (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

So 464² = 400² + 2*400*64 + 64² = 160000 + 51200 + 4096 = 215296.

284.4^2: Let's compute 280^2 = 78400, 4.4^2=19.36, and 2*280*4.4=2464. So (280+4.4)^2 = 78400 + 2464 + 19.36 = 80883.36.

So denominator's magnitude squared is 215296 + 80883.36 = 296179.36.

The numerator is (-3888 + j125280). So its magnitude squared is (-3888)^2 + (125280)^2.

But maybe it's easier to compute the reciprocal and multiply.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the real and imaginary parts after division.

Let me denote:

Numerator: N = (-3888, 125280)

Denominator: D = (464, 284.4)

So, the parallel impedance Z_parallel = N / D.

Which can be calculated as:

Z_parallel = [ (N_real * D_real + N_imag * D_imag) + j (N_imag * D_real - N_real * D_imag) ) ] / (D_real^2 + D_imag^2)

So compute numerator and denominator.

First, D_real = 464, D_imag = 284.4.

N_real = -3888, N_imag = 125280.

Compute the real part of Z_parallel:

( (-3888) * 464 + 125280 * 284.4 ) / (464^2 + 284.4^2 )

Similarly, the imaginary part is:

(125280 * 464 - (-3888)*284.4 ) / (464^2 + 284.4^2 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute denominator D_denom = 464² + 284.4² = 215296 + 80883.36 = 296179.36.

Now, the real part numerator:

(-3888 * 464) = let's compute 3888 * 464.

Well, 3888 * 400 = 1,555,200

3888 * 64 = 248,832

Total is 1,555,200 + 248,832 = 1,804,032. But since it's negative, it's -1,804,032.

Next term: 125280 * 284.4.

Hmm, 125280 * 284.4 = let's compute 125280 * 284 = ?

Wait, perhaps approximate. 125280 * 280 = 35,078,400 (since 125280 * 28 = 3,507,840, so times 10 is 35,078,400)

125280 * 4.4 = 551,232.

So total is approx 35,078,400 + 551,232 = 35,629,632.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 125,280 * 284.4 is a large number, but let me check:

Wait, 125280 * 284.4 = 125280 * (200 + 80 + 4.4) = 125280*200=25,056,000; 125280*80=10,022,400; 125280*4.4=551,232. Sum: 25,056,000 +10,022,400 =35,078,400 +551,232=35,629,632.

So the real part numerator is (-1,804,032) + 35,629,632 = 33,825,600.

Now, the imaginary part numerator:

(125280 * 464) - (-3888 * 284.4 )

Compute 125280 * 464:

Let me compute 125280 * 400 = 50,112,000

125280 * 64 = 8,009,920

So total is 50,112,000 + 8,009,920 = 58,121,920.

Then, compute 3888 * 284.4:

3888 * 284 = let's compute 3888 * 200=777,600; 3888*80=311,040; 3888*4=15,552. So 777,600 + 311,040 = 1,088,640 +15,552=1,104,192.

3888 * 0.4 = 1,555.2

So total 1,104,192 + 1,555.2 = 1,105,747.2.

But since it's negative times negative, it's positive. So the term is 58,121,920 + 1,105,747.2 = 59,227,667.2.

So the imaginary part numerator is 59,227,667.2.

Now, putting it all together:

Z_parallel_real = 33,825,600 / 296,179.36 ≈ let's compute this
