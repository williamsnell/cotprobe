Okay, so I've got this question here about designing a communication program to get approval for a project, specifically an automotive recycling center, despite community opposition. The question is asking what advice a peer would give that made their similar program successful. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different approach.

Let me think... The peer's program worked even though there was strong opposition. So the advice must be something that effectively addresses the concerns and wins over the community.

Option A: "Kill them with kindness." That sounds like being overly nice, maybe to the point of not addressing real issues. I'm not sure if that would work in a situation with strong opposition. It might come off as insincere.

Option B: "Ignore their concerns." That seems like a bad idea. If you ignore the community's worries, they're likely to resist even more. It builds mistrust.

Option C: "Expose them to ridicule." That sounds aggressive and negative. Ridiculing people probably wouldn't help gain their approval. It might even make things worse.

Option D: "Bribe them into agreement." Bribery is unethical and illegal in many cases. Plus, it doesn't solve the underlying issues; it just buys temporary support, which isn't sustainable.

Option E: "Use aggressive tactics." Aggressive approaches can escalate conflicts. It's unlikely to win people over and might lead to more opposition.

Option F: "Solve their problems." This makes sense. If the community has concerns, addressing them directly by solving the problems they're worried about would build trust and support. It shows that you're listening and taking their issues seriously.

Option G: "Manipulate their emotions." Manipulation can be seen as deceitful. While it might work short-term, it can backfire if people feel they're being tricked.

Option H: "Overwhelm them with facts." While providing information is important, just throwing a lot of facts might not address the emotional or specific concerns of the community. It might come off as dismissive.

Option I: "Overpower them with authority." Using authority to push through doesn't usually win hearts and minds. It might lead to resentment rather than approval.

Option J: "Intimidate them with legal jargon." Intimidation is not a good strategy for gaining approval. It creates a hostile environment and doesn't foster cooperation.

So, putting it all together, the most effective approach would be to solve the community's problems. That builds trust and shows genuine concern, which is more likely to gain their approval.

The most likely advice is to solve the community's problems, as addressing their concerns directly builds trust and support, leading to successful project approval.
