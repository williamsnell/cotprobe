Okay, so I have this physics problem here about projecting a body upward and figuring out how high it will rise. Hmm, I remember from school that when you throw something straight up, it slows down due to gravity until it stops and starts falling back down. The question gives the initial speed as 1000 cm/s, and I need to find the maximum height it reaches.

Wait, I think the formula for maximum height when something is thrown straight up is something like (v²)/(2g), where v is the initial velocity and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Oh right, because at the maximum height, the final velocity is zero. So the equation comes from the kinematic equations, specifically v² = u² + 2as, where a is -g (since it's deceleration) and s is the displacement.

So let me plug in the numbers. The initial velocity u is 1000 cm/s. But wait, what's g in cm/s²? I know that g is approximately 9.8 m/s², which is 980 cm/s² because 1 m is 100 cm. So 9.8 m/s² * 100 = 980 cm/s². Yeah that's right.

So applying the formula: max height h = (v_initial)^2 / (2 * g). So substituting, h = (1000)^2 / (2 * 980). Let's compute that. 1000 squared is 1,000,000. 2 times 980 is 1960. So h = 1,000,000 / 1960.

Wait, let me calculate that. 1,000,000 divided by 1960. Hmm, 1960 goes into 1,000,000 how many times? Let me see. 1960 * 500 is 980,000. Because 1960 * 5 is 9800, so times 100 is 980,000. So 500 * 1960 is 980,000. Subtracting that from a million leaves 20,000. Now, 1960 goes into 20,000 about 10 times because 1960*10 is 19,600. So that's 10 more. So 500 + 10 = 510, with a remainder of 400. 1960 goes into 400 zero times, so the division is approximately 510.20 cm. Wait, no, wait: 1,000,000 divided by 1960 is the same as 1000000 ÷ 1960. Let me compute 1000000 / 1960.

Alternatively, perhaps I can simplify the fraction. 1,000,000 ÷ 1960 = (1,000,000 ÷ 20) ÷ (1960 ÷ 20) = 50,000 ÷ 98. Because 1960 /20 is 98. Then 50,000 ÷ 98. Hmm, 98 times 510 is 98 *500=49,000 and 98*10=980, so 49,980. So 510 gives 49,980, subtracting from 50,000 leaves 20. So 510 + (20/98) ≈ 510.204 cm. So about 510.2 cm.

Looking at the options, option C is 510 cm, which matches this calculation. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me double-check if I made any mistakes. Did I use the right formula? Yes, because when you have initial velocity upwards and gravity opposing it, the max height is when velocity becomes zero. So the formula (v²)/(2g) is correct.

Wait, let me check the unit conversion again. 9.8 m/s² is 980 cm/s². Yes, because 1 m is 100 cm. So 9.8 m/s² = 980 cm/s². So that part is correct.

Another thought: could air resistance affect this? Well, the problem doesn't mention air resistance, so we're assuming it's negligible. So it's just a straightforward projectile motion problem with only gravity acting on it.

So yeah, the calculation leads to approximately 510 cm. So the correct option is C.

To determine how high the body will rise when projected upward with a speed of 1000 cm/s, we use the kinematic equation for maximum height:

\[
h = \frac{v^2}{2g}
\]

Here:
- \( v = 1000 \, \text{cm/s} \) (initial velocity),
- \( g = 980 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity).

Substituting the values:

\[
h = \frac{(1000)^2}{2 \cdot 980} = \frac{1,000,000}{1960} \approx 510.2 \, \text{cm}.
\]

This calculation shows that the maximum height is approximately \( 510 \, \text{cm} \). Among the given options, the closest match is **510 cm**, which corresponds to option **C**.
