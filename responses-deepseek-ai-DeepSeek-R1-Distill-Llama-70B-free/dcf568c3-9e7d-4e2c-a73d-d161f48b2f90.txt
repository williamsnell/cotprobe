Question:

A lumber mill contracted to deliver one thousand8-foot sheets of plywood to a home improvement store on the first of each month for 10 consecutive months starting June 1. The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?

Options:

A: Judgment for the store, because the mill failed to have a contingency plan in place.
B: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.
C: Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.
D: Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.
E: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.
F: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.
G: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.
H: Judgment for the store, because the mill had a contractual obligation to deliver the goods.
I: Judgment for the mill, because they had informed the store about the issue in advance.
J: Judgment for the store, because the mill could have sourced lumber from another location.

Okay, so I need to figure out this contract law question. Let's read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The lumber mill had a contract to deliver 1000 8-foot sheets of plywood every month for 10 months starting June 1. So the first delivery is June 1, then July 1, August 1, and so on until March 1. They successfully delivered June, July, and August on time, and got paid. But then on August 16, the mill told the store they can't meet the September 1 delivery because their lumber reserve was destroyed by a forest fire. They asked the store to excuse them from further performance, but the store refused and demanded the remaining shipments on time. When September didn't arrive, the store sued for breach.

The question is asking what the court would decide. The options are A through J.

I remember that in contract law, there are several doctrines that can discharge a party's obligations. The main ones are impossibility, impracticability, frustration of purpose, and act of God. Let me think about each.

Impossibility of performance is when it's literally impossible to perform the contract. Like if the subject matter is destroyed. But usually, impossibility only applies if the destruction was not the fault of the party and was unforeseeable.

Act of God is similar but refers to natural events beyond anyone's control, like floods, earthquakes, etc. Forest fires might qualify here.

Frustration of purpose is when the main reason for the contract is destroyed, making the performance pointless. Like if you rent a venue and it burns down before the event.

Impracticability is when performance becomes extremely difficult or expensive, but not impossible.

So the mill's lumber was destroyed by a forest fire. They can't deliver because they don't have the materials. So they're claiming impossibility or act of God.

But wait, in the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which governs sales contracts like this, the rules might be a bit different than common law. Let me think about UCC Article 2, which deals with sales.

Under UCC ยง2-615, a seller can be excused from timely delivery if there's an unforeseeable contingency that makes performance impossible or commercially impracticable. This includes causes like war, natural disasters, or unforeseen governmental actions.

So the forest fire would likely fall under an unforeseeable event beyond the seller's control. However, the seller has to show that the event made performance impossible, not just more difficult.

But wait, the contract was for future deliveries. The lumber mill had a reserve that was destroyed. So for the September shipment and beyond, they can't perform because they don't have the lumber. So each delivery is a separate obligation, I think.

But the UCC also has something about the seller's duty to use reasonable efforts to mitigate. Did the mill try to get lumber from elsewhere? The problem doesn't say, but one of the options suggests that the mill could have sourced elsewhere. Option J says judgment for the store because the mill could have sourced from another location.

So if the mill could have gotten lumber elsewhere but chose not to, then the excuse wouldn't hold. Because under the UCC, the seller must make reasonable efforts to find substitute materials unless that's not possible.

In this case, the mill's reserve was destroyed, but perhaps they could have bought lumber from another supplier. If that's feasible, then the mill's failure to do so would mean they can't claim impracticability.

So looking at the options:

Option B: Judgment for the mill because performance is discharged by impossibility.

Option D: Judgment for the store because duties wouldn't be excused.

Option E: Mill discharged because unforeseeable hindrance.

Option G: Act of God.

Option J: Store because mill could have sourced elsewhere.

The question is whether the mill's failure to have a contingency plan or source elsewhere affects their excuse.

I think under UCC ยง2-615, the seller can be excused if the failure is due to an unforeseen cause beyond their control that makes performance impossible. But if they can get the materials elsewhere, then it's not impossible, just more expensive or difficult. So the key is whether sourcing from another location was possible, making the performance not impossible but merely impracticable.

If performance is commercially impracticable, the seller's obligation may be discharged, but only if the seller couldn't reasonably be expected to have contingency plans. Alternatively, if it's just impracticable but not impossible, then maybe the seller is still liable unless they can prove it's beyond their control and without fault.

Wait, the UCC requires that the cause must be beyond the seller's control and that the seller couldn't have reasonably been expected to anticipate and guard against it. So if the forest fire was an unforeseen event, like a sudden disaster, then the seller might be excused.

But if the seller could have obtained the plywood from another source, then they weren't excused. So the question becomes whether the mill could have reasonably sourced lumber elsewhere.

The problem doesn't say whether they tried or not, but the fact that they told the store they couldn't meet the deadline suggests that they didn't have an alternative source. But the store might argue that it's the mill's responsibility to have a backup plan.

In contract law, the party relying on impossibility or impracticability has the burden to show that performance is truly impossible, not just more difficult. If the mill could have obtained plywood from another supplier, even at a higher cost, then their performance isn't excused because it's not impossible, just more expensive. Therefore, the store could still demand performance.

So in this case, the court might find that the mill could have sourced the lumber elsewhere. Therefore, their inability to perform isn't due to impossibility but due to their own failure to secure alternative sources. Hence, the store would win.

Looking at the options, option J says judgment for the store because the mill could have sourced lumber from another location. That seems to align with this reasoning.

Another option is D, which says judgment for the store because duties wouldn't be excused. But D is more general, while J gives a specific reason.

Wait, but the question is about the September shipment. The mill's reserve was destroyed, so if they can't get any lumber, then no. But if they can buy from others, then they should.

So the correct answer would depend on whether the mill had alternative sources. Since the problem doesn't specify, but option J presents that as a possibility, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, some might think that a forest fire is an act of God, making option G correct. But under UCC, I think the analysis is more about impracticability and whether alternatives exist.

So I think option J is the correct answer.
</think>

The lumber mill contracted to deliver plywood to the home improvement store for 10 consecutive months but failed to meet the September 1 delivery due to a forest fire destroying their lumber reserve. The store sued for breach of contract. The court must determine whether the mill's performance is excused due to impossibility, impracticability, or other doctrines under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).

Under UCC ยง2-615, a seller may be excused from timely delivery if an unforeseeable event beyond their control makes performance impossible or commercially impracticable. However, the seller must demonstrate that the event was unforeseeable and that they could not reasonably have anticipated or mitigated it. Importantly, the seller must also show that they cannot obtain substitute materials from alternative sources.

In this case, the forest fire destroyed the mill's lumber reserve, which could qualify as an unforeseeable event beyond their control. However, the problem does not specify whether the mill attempted to source lumber from another location. If the mill could have reasonably obtained plywood from alternative suppliers, their failure to do so would mean that performance is not impossible, just more difficult or expensive. Therefore, the mill's obligation would not be excused, and the store could demand performance.

Option J aligns with this reasoning, as it highlights that the mill could have sourced lumber from another location, making their inability to perform a failure to fulfill the contract rather than an impossibility.
