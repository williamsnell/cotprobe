Question:

A state legislature has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state electionswho wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the federal court's adjudication of the candidate's suit?

Options:

A: The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.
B: The federal court should hear the case and make a ruling before the state court.
C: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.
D: The federal court should hear the case and defer its decision until after the state court's ruling.
E: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it is a matter of state law.
F: The federal court should hear the case because the state statute potentially violates federal law.
G: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it's a matter of electoral law.
H: The federal court should hear the case on the merits.
I: The federal court should refuse to hear the case as it lacks jurisdiction.
J: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.

Okay, so I've got this question about a legal scenario involving federal and state courts, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the situation: A state has a statute requiring write-in candidates to have their full name and office written in ink on the ballot. A Chinese-American candidate is using tear-off stickers with his name and office, which he's mailing to Chinese voters who might not be proficient in English. The election official says the stickers don't comply because they're not written in ink. The candidate sues in federal court claiming a constitutional violation, and his opponent sues in state court to stop the stickers.

The question is about what the federal court should do regarding the candidate's suit. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that when there's a case in federal court and a related state case, there are doctrines like abstention that might apply. Abstention is when a federal court decides not to hear a case, usually to let the state court decide certain issues first, especially if it involves state law or constitutional issues that the state court is better suited to handle.

In this case, the candidate is challenging the state statute on constitutional grounds. But the state court is already going to hear a case about the same statute—whether the stickers comply. If the state court rules on the state law issue, it might resolve the constitutional issue as well. For example, if the state court decides the statute doesn't require writing in ink and the stickers are okay, then the constitutional issue might become moot. Or if the state court upholds the statute, the federal court can address the constitutional challenge with the state's interpretation clarified.

The abstention doctrine, specifically the Pullman abstention, allows federal courts to wait for state courts to resolve ambiguous state law issues that could affect the federal constitutional question. Since the state court is about to rule on the merits soon (within three weeks), it makes sense for the federal court to wait. This avoids unnecessary federal court decisions on state law and possible constitutional issues that might not need to be reached if the state court resolves the matter.

Looking at the options:

A: Remand to state court. But the case is already in federal court, so remanding doesn't make sense. The federal court would usually keep jurisdiction unless it's abstaining.

B: Federal court hears it before state. That could lead to conflicting rulings, so probably not the best approach.

C: Political question. This doesn't seem to be a political question; it's a constitutional issue about voting rights, which courts can decide.

D: Hear and defer. That sounds like abstention—waiting for the state court's decision. This seems plausible.

E: Refuse because it's state law. No, because the federal court can hear constitutional issues.

F: Hear because of federal law. The case involves federal constitutional claims, so the federal court has jurisdiction. But the question is whether it should exercise it now or wait.

G: Electoral law. Not a correct reason to refuse; federal courts handle such cases.

H: Hear on merits. Maybe, but considering the state court is about to rule, it's better to wait.

I: Lack jurisdiction. No, federal courts have jurisdiction over constitutional claims.

J: Abstention doctrine. Yes, this fits. The situation calls for Pullman abstention because the state court is about to interpret the statute, which could resolve the constitutional issue.

So the correct answer would be either D or J. D says hear and defer, which is what abstention does. J says refuse because of abstention doctrine. Wait, but when a court abstains, does it refuse the case or defer?

Upon closer look, the federal court doesn't refuse to hear it entirely; it just waits for the state court to decide first. So the federal court would stay the proceedings until the state court rules. Therefore, the correct approach is to abstain under Pullman, which means the federal court defers its decision.

So looking at the options:

D says the federal court should hear the case and defer its decision until after the state court's ruling. That's correct because the federal court is choosing to wait, not dismissing the case.

Alternatively, J says the court should refuse to hear because of abstention. But I think abstention doesn't mean refusing to hear; it's a stay, not dismissal. So the court would hold the case while waiting for the state court.

Wait, but looking at the options, D says "hear the case and defer its decision," which aligns with the Pullman approach. So the federal court would keep the case but wait for the state court's ruling before deciding.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether a federal court should hear a constitutional challenge to a state statute regarding write-in ballots while a related state court case is pending. The federal court must decide whether to exercise jurisdiction immediately or defer to the state court's upcoming ruling. 

The scenario involves a state statute requiring write-in candidates' names and offices to be written in ink on the ballot. A candidate is using stickers instead, and both federal and state courts are addressing the issue. The federal court must consider doctrines like abstention, which allow federal courts to defer to state courts when state law issues could resolve or clarify federal constitutional questions.

The correct approach is **Pullman abstention**, where the federal court defers its decision to allow the state court to interpret the statute first. This avoids unnecessary rulings and potential conflicts. Since the state court is expected to rule soon, the federal court should hear the case but defer its decision until after the state court's ruling.

**Option D** correctly reflects this approach, as it involves the federal court hearing the case and deferring its decision until the state court's ruling. Other options, such as refusing jurisdiction or remanding, are incorrect because the federal court has jurisdiction over constitutional claims, and remand is unnecessary since the case is already in federal court.

ANSWER: D
