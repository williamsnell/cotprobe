Okay, so I've got this problem here about coding and probability distributions. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the optimal uniquely decodable code with the minimum expected number of symbols. The codewords start with a symbol from {7,8,9} and then followed by binary digits {0,1}.

Wait, right. So the first symbol is ternary, and the rest are binary. So each codeword is like a prefix from 7,8,9 followed by some combination of 0s and 1s.

The probability distribution given is p = (16/69, 15/69, 12/69, 10/69, 8/69, 8/69). There are six probabilities, so six symbols to code, each with their own probabilities.

I remember that for uniquely decodable codes, the Kraft-McMillan inequality must hold. The sum of p_i * 2^{-l_i} should be ≤ 1, where l_i is the length of the codeword for the ith symbol. Wait, wait, actually, the Kraft inequality uses the number of symbols in the code. Since the first part is ternary, maybe I should think in terms of base 3 and base 2.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. Each codeword starts with one symbol from {7,8,9}, which are three possibilities, so that's like base 3. Then, after that, each additional symbol is binary, so base 2. So the total number of possible codewords must be such that the Kraft inequality is satisfied for the code. But maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps each codeword is a sequence where the first part is a choice among three, and the rest are binary choices. So each codeword is a string where the first character is from a 3-symbol set, and the rest are binary.

But for the purposes of calculating the expected length, each position in the codeword contributes differently. So the first symbol is one of three, so it contributes log2(3) bits, but wait no, for the code lengths, each symbol after the first adds a binary digit, which is a bit. So the structure is that after the first symbol (which is 7,8,9), each subsequent digit is a bit (0 or 1).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model each codeword as a string where the first character is from a set of size 3, and each subsequent character is from a set of size 2. So the total number of possible codewords of length n is 3 * 2^{n-1}.

Wait, but for coding, each symbol is assigned a codeword, and the code must be uniquely decodable. So the code is a prefix code, perhaps, to ensure unique decodability. Because prefix codes (where no codeword is a prefix of another) are uniquely decodable.

So the approach is to assign codewords such that the shorter codewords are assigned to the higher probability symbols, to minimize the expected length.

But wait, the first symbol is from 7,8,9. So perhaps the first part is a ternary choice, and then the rest binary. So each codeword can be thought of as a sequence where the first part is one of three, and then each additional part is binary. So the length of the codeword is 1 (for the first symbol) plus the number of binary digits.

Alternatively, perhaps each codeword is like a tree where the first level has three branches (7,8,9), and each subsequent level has two branches (0,1). So each codeword's length is 1 plus the number of binary digits after.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the code's structure. Each codeword starts with 7,8, or 9, and then can have a binary suffix. So the possible codewords can be of varying lengths. For example, a codeword could be just "7", or "70", "700", etc. But wait, no, because the first symbol is mandatory, followed by any number of binary digits, including zero.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the first symbol is mandatory, followed by binary digits. So each codeword is at least length 1 (just 7,8,9), and can be longer. So for example, codewords could be:

- 7, 8, 9 (length 1)
- 70,71,80,81,90,91 (length 2)
- 700,701,..., etc. (length 3)
and so on.

But since each symbol must have a unique codeword, we need to assign the codewords in a way that the code is a prefix code. So, for example, if one codeword is "7", then no other codeword can start with "7", because that would make them non-unique. So if "7" is assigned to a symbol, then no other codeword can start with "7", meaning all longer codewords starting with "7" are unavailable.

Given that, the optimal code (to minimize the expected length) would involve assigning the shortest possible codewords to the most probable symbols. So the highest probability symbols get the shortest codewords.

But wait, the first symbol is one of three, so for the first level, we can assign each of the three to some symbol. But wait, there are six symbols, so we can't assign all to length 1. So perhaps assign the three most probable symbols to the three length-1 codewords (7,8,9), and then the remaining three symbols can have longer codewords, which would start with one of the first three symbols followed by a binary digit.

Wait, but in that case, the three length-1 codewords would take up all the first-level options, so the next level would require adding a binary digit. So the next available codewords would be of length 2, like 70,71,80,81,90,91. But wait, if we used all three first-level symbols for the three highest probabilities, then the other three symbols would have to have longer codewords, but how? Because each of the first three can have a 0 or 1 after them, giving six possible length-2 codewords. But wait, that's six, and we only need three more. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think in terms of the given probabilities. The probabilities are p = (16/69, 15/69, 12/69, 10/69, 8/69, 8/69). Let's sort them in descending order to assign shorter codes to higher probabilities.

So the order from highest to lowest would be:

1. 16/69

2. 15/69

3. 12/69

4. 10/69

5. 8/69

6. 8/69

So the first three symbols (assuming each gets a unique codeword) would get the shortest possible codewords. The first three in the sorted list can be assigned to 7,8,9, each of length 1.

The next three symbols (4,5,6 in the sorted list) would need longer codewords. Since each of 7,8,9 can have two possible extensions (0 or 1), that gives 3*2=6 possible length-2 codewords. But we only need three. So perhaps assign the next three symbols to three of the six possible length-2 codewords.

Wait, but how? Because each choice of 7,8,9 followed by 0 or 1 gives 6 options. So for the fourth symbol (10/69), perhaps assign 70, for the fifth (8/69) assign 80, and sixth (8/69) assign 90. Alternatively, the assignment could vary, but the idea is to assign the next available shortest codes to the next highest probabilities.

Wait, but the next three after the first three would be assigned to the next available shortest codewords, which are of length 2. So we can assign each of the next three symbols to one of the 6 possible length-2 codewords, but we need to pick three that have the highest possible probabilities.

Wait, but the initial idea is that the higher the probability, the shorter the codeword. So the fourth symbol in the sorted list (10/69) should get the shortest available codeword, which is length 2. Then the fifth and sixth would also get length 2.

Wait, but let me think about the structure again. The first three are assigned to 7,8,9 (length 1). The remaining three can be assigned to three of the six possible length-2 codewords.

So the next step is to assign the highest remaining probabilities to the shortest possible remaining codewords. So the fourth symbol (10/69) would get the next shortest available, which is a length-2 codeword. Similarly, the fifth and sixth would also get length-2.

But wait, each length-2 codeword starts with 7,8, or 9, followed by 0 or 1. So for example, 70, 71, 80, 81, etc.

So perhaps the optimal code assigns the highest remaining probability to the first available codeword. But I'm not sure about the exact assignment.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

Option D: [7,8,9,70,80,90]

So the first three are 7,8,9 (length 1), and the next three are 70,80,90 (length 2).

Let me check the expected value. The expected length would be sum (p_i * l_i), where l_i is the length of each codeword.

So the first three would have l=1, the next three l=2.

Calculating the expected length:

p1=16/69, l=1 → 16/69 *1

p2=15/69, l=1 →15/69 *1

p3=12/69, l=1 →12/69 *1

p4=10/69, l=2 →10/69 *2

p5=8/69, l=2 →8/69 *2

p6=8/69, l=2 →8/69 *2

Summing these:

(16+15+12)/69 *1 + (10+8+8)/69 *2

= (43/69) + (26/69)*2

= 43/69 + 52/69 = 95/69 ≈1.3768

Wait, but what if some of the codewords are longer? Let's see another option.

Option E: [7,8,9,700,800,900], so the first three are length 1, next three are length 3.

Expected length:

(16+15+12)/69 *1 + (10+8+8)/69 *3 = 43/69 + 26/69 *3 = 43/69 +78/69= 121/69 ≈1.75, which is worse than option D.

Option C: [7,8,9,710,810,910], which are length 3. So same as E, worse expected length.

Option B: [7,8,9,71,81,91], which are length 2. So same as D? Wait, no, in D, the next codewords are 70,80,90, also length 2. So the expected length would be same as D.

Wait, what's the difference between B and D? Let me check.

Option B: [7,8,9,71,81,91]

Each of the last three codewords is length 2, same as D.

So the expected length would be same as D. So why are both options present?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Because the code must be uniquely decodable, which requires that it's a prefix code.

Wait, if in option B, the codewords are 7,8,9,71,81,91. Is this a prefix code? Let's see: 7 is a codeword, and 71 starts with 7, so that would mean that 7 is a prefix of 71, which would violate the prefix code condition. Because once you have 7 as a codeword, you can't have any longer codewords starting with 7, as the decoder would mistake the longer one as the shorter one.

Wait, that's a key point. So the code must be a prefix code to ensure unique decodability. So if you assign 7 to one symbol, you can't have any other codeword starting with 7. So the next codewords can't have 7 as the first symbol if 7 is already taken as a codeword.

So looking back, the initial assignment would be to assign the first three symbols to 7,8,9. Then, for the remaining three symbols, you can't use any codewords that start with 7,8, or 9. Wait, that can't be right because all the codewords start with 7,8,9. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code structure.

Wait, perhaps the code is structured such that the first symbol is from 7,8,9, and then the rest are binary. So each codeword is uniquely identified by the first symbol and the following binary digits. So for example, 7 is a codeword of length 1. Then 70 is another codeword of length 2, which would be a different symbol. So in that case, the code isn't a prefix code because 7 is a prefix of 70. Which would cause ambiguity.

Wait, no. Because if 7 is a codeword, then when the decoder sees a 7, it knows it's the end of a codeword. So if a longer codeword starts with 7, the decoder would incorrectly stop at the first 7. So to have a uniquely decodable code, it must be a prefix code.

Ah, so if we assign 7 to a symbol, we cannot have any other codewords starting with 7. So that would mean that all the other codewords cannot start with 7. Similarly for 8 and 9.

Wait, but that's impossible because the problem states that the first symbol must be from 7,8,9. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem's structure.

Wait, perhaps the code is such that the first symbol is a 7,8, or 9, and then each subsequent symbol is a binary choice. So each codeword is a sequence where the first symbol is 7,8, or 9, and then the rest are 0 or 1. So the code is built as a tree where the first level has three nodes (7,8,9), and each of those branches into two children (0,1), and so on.

In that case, the code can't have any codewords that are prefixes of others. So, for example, if 7 is assigned to a symbol, then 70 and 71 can't be assigned to any other symbols, because they would be longer codewords starting with 7, which is already a codeword.

Wait, but that's a problem because after assigning 7 to one symbol, you can't use 70 or 71 for any other symbols. So the maximum number of symbols you can have in the code is three, each assigned to 7,8,9. But the problem has six symbols. So that approach won't work.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe the first symbol is a 7,8, or 9, and each subsequent digit is a binary digit, but the code is allowed to have variable length, as long as it's uniquely decodable. So the code must be a prefix code, so that no codeword is a prefix of another.

Wait, but that would require that if a codeword starts with 7, then no other codeword can start with 7. But that would limit the code to only three codewords, which isn't enough because we have six symbols.

Ah, perhaps the first symbol is ternary, and the rest are binary, but the code is structured in a way that allows for more codewords without violating the prefix condition.

Wait, maybe the code is built by having the first symbol as 7,8,9, and then the following binary digits form a binary code that is a prefix code in itself. So, for example, the first symbol is 7, and then the binary part is a prefix code, but that would require that each binary part is a prefix code. So perhaps each of the three initial symbols (7,8,9) can have their own set of binary suffixes, each forming a prefix code.

Wait, but that complicates things. Alternatively, think of the entire code as a ternary prefix for the first symbol and binary suffixes, ensuring that the entire code is a prefix code.

Wait, maybe the solution is to assign the three most probable symbols to the three shortest possible codewords (7,8,9), each of length 1. Then, for the remaining three symbols, assign them to codewords that are longer, but ensuring that they don't start with 7,8, or 9 as their first symbol. But that's impossible because all codewords must start with 7,8, or 9. So perhaps that approach won't work.

Wait, perhaps the structure is that after the first symbol (7,8,9), each subsequent symbol is binary, but the code is structured in a way that each codeword is uniquely identifiable without being a prefix of another. So the code must satisfy that no codeword is a prefix of another. For example, if a codeword is "70", then no other codeword can start with "70".

So, the code is built as a tree where each node can have up to three children (7,8,9) for the first level, and then each subsequent level can have two children (0,1). But to ensure it's a prefix code, once a node is assigned a codeword, none of its descendants can be assigned codewords.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently. The problem requires that the code be uniquely decodable, so the Kraft-McMillan inequality must hold. The sum over all codewords of (1/3) * (1/2)^{l_i -1} ≤ 1.

Wait, no, the Kraft inequality for a code with symbols from an alphabet of size D is sum (D^{-l_i}) ≤ 1. But in this case, the first symbol is from a 3-letter alphabet and the rest from a 2-letter alphabet. So each codeword's contribution would be (1/3) * (1/2)^{l_i-1}.

So the sum over all codewords of (1/3
