Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing alcohol solutions. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember these kinds of problems from chemistry class, where you mix different concentrations to get a desired concentration. 

The question says: How many gallons of a 74% alcohol liquid must be combined with 5 gallons of 90% alcohol to get a mixture that's 84% alcohol. The options are A through J, with various gallon amounts.

Alright, let's break it down. I think I should set up an equation for this. Let me call the unknown quantity, which is the gallons of the 74% solution, as x. 

So, the first solution is x gallons at 74% alcohol. That means the amount of pure alcohol in it is 0.74x gallons. The second solution is 5 gallons at 90% alcohol, so that's 0.9 * 5 = 4.5 gallons of pure alcohol.

When we mix them together, the total volume is x + 5 gallons. The total alcohol is 0.74x + 4.5 gallons. And the concentration of the mixture is supposed to be 84%, so 0.84 times the total volume.

So the equation should be: 0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84(x + 5). 

Let me write that out:

0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84x + 0.84*5

Wait, 0.84 *5 is 4.2, right? So the equation becomes:

0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84x + 4.2

Hmm, let me subtract 0.74x from both sides to get the x terms on one side. 

4.5 = 0.1x + 4.2

Wait, because 0.84x -0.74x is 0.1x. So now I have:

4.5 = 0.1x + 4.2

Subtract 4.2 from both sides:

4.5 -4.2 = 0.1x

0.3 = 0.1x

So, x = 0.3 / 0.1 = 3.

Wait, so x is 3 gallons. So the answer would be 3 gallons. Let me check the options. Option A is 3 gallons. So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me verify that. Let me plug x=3 back into the equation.

So, 0.74 *3 = 2.22 gallons of alcohol. The other solution is 4.5 gallons. So total alcohol is 2.22 +4.5=6.72 gallons.

Total volume is 3 +5 =8 gallons. So 6.72 /8 = 0.84, which is 84%. Yep, that checks out. So yeah, 3 gallons is correct.

To determine how many gallons of a 74% alcohol solution must be combined with 5 gallons of a 90% alcohol solution to obtain a mixture that is 84% alcohol, we set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) represent the gallons of the 74% alcohol solution. The total alcohol from the first solution is \( 0.74x \), and the total alcohol from the second solution is \( 0.9 \times 5 = 4.5 \) gallons. The total alcohol in the mixture is \( 0.74x + 4.5 \), and the total volume of the mixture is \( x + 5 \). Since the mixture is 84% alcohol, we have:

\[
0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84(x + 5)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84x + 4.2
\]

Subtract \( 0.74x \) from both sides:

\[
4.5 = 0.1x + 4.2
\]

Subtract \( 4.2 \) from both sides:

\[
0.3 = 0.1x
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{0.3}{0.1} = 3
\]

Thus, 3 gallons of the 74% alcohol solution are needed. Verifying, the total alcohol is \( 0.74 \times 3 + 4.5 = 6.72 \) gallons, and the total volume is \( 3 + 5 = 8 \) gallons. The concentration is \( \frac{6.72}{8} = 0.84 \), or 84%, which confirms the solution is correct.

The answer is **A: 3 gallons**.
