Question:

Four people own a property, and they agree to convey to an adult child of one of them. There is a purchasemoney mortgage on the property for which the four signed a promissory note as security. The loan was not satisfied at the time of the conveyance. The conveyance is a deed in fee simple to the adult child. The adult child then takes over the mortgage payments. The adult child stops making the payments and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who does not do a title search. The purchaser sues his grantor to get an order compelling him to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from his property. Will the court more than likely grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants?

Options:

A: Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.
B: Yes, but the court will also issue an order for the original four owners to pay a portion of the outstanding mortgage.
C: No, the court will order the purchaser to resume payments on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.
D: No, the court will order the bona fide purchaser to pay the outstanding mortgage.
E: Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.
F: Yes, the court will dismiss the case because the purchaser did not conduct a title search before buying the property.
G: No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.
H: No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.
I: No, the court will order the adult child and the original four owners to equally share the remaining mortgage payments.
J: Yes, because the court can only force the adult child to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, there are four people who own a property. They agree to convey it to an adult child of one of them. The property has a purchase-money mortgage, and all four signed a promissory note as security. The loan wasn't satisfied when they conveyed the property. The conveyance is a deed in fee simple to the adult child, who then takes over the mortgage payments.

But then, the adult child stops making payments and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who didn't do a title search. Now, the purchaser is suing his grantor (the adult child) to get an order to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from the property. The question is whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants.

Hmm. So, the key points are:

1. Four original owners convey to an adult child, who takes over mortgage payments.
2. Adult child defaults and sells to a bona fide purchaser without a title search.
3. Purchaser sues the adult child, and the adult child moves to dismiss.

I think the main issue here is about the liability for the mortgage and whether the purchaser can compel the grantor (adult child) to pay it off.

So, when the four owners conveyed the property to the adult child, they were probably doing a transfer subject to the existing mortgage. The promissory note was signed by all four, so they might still be personally liable on the debt, but the mortgage lien is on the property. But when the adult child took over, perhaps there was an assumption of the mortgage, making them personally liable as well. Or maybe the original four are still liable.

Wait, but when the adult child took over the payments, they probably became responsible for the mortgage. If they default, the lender could foreclose, but what about the purchaser?

The purchaser bought from the adult child but didn't do a title search. So, the purchaser might not have known about the mortgage. But as a bona fide purchaser, they might have some protections, but only if they paid value and had no notice. But if they didn't do a title search, maybe they had constructive notice because the mortgage is a public record. 

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, a bona fide purchaser without notice can take the property free of prior liens if they paid value without notice. But if they didn't do a title search, does that mean they had constructive notice? Because the mortgage is recorded, so they're charged with knowledge of it.

But the question says the purchaser is a bona fide purchaser who didn't do a title search. Wait, but if they didn't do a title search, maybe they're not bona fide because they should have known about the mortgage. Or does bona fide purchaser mean they paid value and had no actual knowledge, regardless of constructive notice? This part is a bit unclear.

Wait, I think in some states, a bona fide purchaser is someone who pays value without notice of prior claims. Notice can be actual or constructive (like from a recorded document). So if the mortgage was recorded, the purchaser is charged with constructive notice, so they can't claim bona fide purchaser status if they didn't do a title search. But if the mortgage wasn't recorded, that's different. In this case, the mortgage was on the property, so it's likely recorded.

So, if the purchaser didn't do a title search and the mortgage was recorded, they had constructive notice and thus can't be a bona fide purchaser. But the question says they are a bona fide purchaser, which is conflicting. Wait, maybe the problem states they are a BFP without a title search, but that might not make sense because they would have had constructive notice.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the adult child, when conveying to the purchaser, didn't pay off the mortgage, so the mortgage remains. The purchaser, as a BFP, might take the property subject to the mortgage because they had constructive notice, but if they didn't do a title search, maybe they can argue they had no actual knowledge and are BFP. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the scenario says the purchaser is a bona fide purchaser who did not do a title search. So, perhaps the court would consider that they had constructive notice because the mortgage was recorded, making them not a BFP. Or maybe the state follows the race-notice rule or something else. But I think in general, a BFP is without notice, actual or constructive.

So, the purchaser might not qualify as a BFP because they should have known about the mortgage through a title search. Therefore, the purchaser might be stuck with the mortgage lien.

But the question is about the purchaser suing the grantor (adult child) to compel them to pay the mortgage. The issue is whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss.

So, what's the liability here? In a typical sale, the seller is responsible for paying off any mortgages at closing, usually through the proceeds. If the seller doesn't do that, the buyer might have a claim against the seller for breach of contract or to require them to clear the title.

But in this case, the seller is the adult child, not the original four. The original four had given the property to the adult child, subject to the mortgage. The adult child then sold it to the purchaser, possibly without paying off the mortgage.

Wait, but when the adult child took over the mortgage payments, does that mean they assumed the mortgage? Or were they just making payments voluntarily? If they assumed the mortgage, they'd be personally liable, and the original four might be released, or perhaps they're still liable as well, depending on the agreement.

But when the adult child conveys to the purchaser, the mortgage would still be on the property unless it was paid off. So, the purchaser's property is subject to the mortgage. If the adult child didn't pay it off, the lender could foreclose, and the purchaser would face foreclosure unless they take over the payments.

But the purchaser is suing the adult child to pay the mortgage. So, can they compel the adult child to do that?

I think the issue is whether the purchaser can require the adult child to pay off the mortgage. In a typical real estate sale, the seller is required to provide clear title. If they don't, the buyer can sue for breach of contract or specific performance, requiring the seller to clear the title, which might involve paying off the mortgage.

But in this case, the adult child might not have the money to pay off the mortgage. So, can the court compel them to do so? Or is the remedy different?

Alternatively, the court might order the adult child to make the payments, but if they can't, the purchaser might have to take over the payments themselves to avoid foreclosure.

Wait, but in the scenario, the adult child has stopped making payments. So the mortgage is in default, and the purchaser is facing foreclosure. The purchaser wants the court to order the adult child to pay the mortgage and remove the lien.

So, the question is whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss. If the court dismisses, it means the purchaser loses and can't compel the adult child to pay.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes, because the purchaser didn't do a title search and it's their risk. So the court would dismiss.

Option G says no, the court will order the adult child to resume payments.

Option J says yes, because the court can only force the adult child to pay in full.

Hmm. So, the key is whether the purchaser can make the adult child pay the mortgage.

In real estate transactions, when a seller conveys property with a mortgage lien, the buyer typically has to assume the mortgage or the seller must pay it off. If the seller doesn't, the buyer can sue for specific performance, requiring the seller to clear the title.

But if the seller can't pay it off, perhaps because they don't have funds, the court might not be able to force them to do so. Instead, the buyer might have to take over the payments to avoid foreclosure.

But the problem is that the purchaser is suing to get the grantor (adult child) to pay the mortgage. So, can the court order that?

I think the court can order specific performance, requiring the seller to take actions to clear the title, which could include paying off the mortgage. But if the seller can't pay, the court might not be able to force them. Alternatively, the court might allow the buyer to pay the mortgage and seek reimbursement from the seller, but that might be a different remedy.

Wait, but in this case, the adult child is the seller. The original four owners gave the property to the adult child, subject to the mortgage. The adult child then sold it to the purchaser without paying off the mortgage.

If the adult child is the one who took over the mortgage payments, perhaps the original four are no longer liable. Or maybe they are still on the hook because they signed the promissory note.

But the question is about the lawsuit between the purchaser and the adult child. So, the issue is whether the court will order the adult child to pay the mortgage.

I think the court can order the adult child to pay, but if they can't, the court can't do much. Alternatively, the court might order the adult child to make payments, but if they default, the purchaser could be at risk.

Alternatively, the court might dismiss the case because the purchaser didn't do a title search and is now responsible for the mortgage.

So, looking at the options, option A says yes, grant the motion to dismiss because it's the purchaser's risk for not doing a title search.

But wait, the purchaser is a bona fide purchaser. If they are a BFP, they might take the property free of liens if they paid without notice. But if the mortgage was recorded, they had constructive notice, so they can't be a BFP. But the problem says they are a BFP, which is confusing.

Wait, the problem states that the purchaser is a bona fide purchaser who did not do a title search. That might mean they had no actual knowledge but had constructive notice because the mortgage was recorded. So, they might not qualify as BFP because they are charged with constructive notice. Thus, the court would say it's their fault for not doing the search, and they can't force the seller to pay.

So, in that case, the court would grant the motion to dismiss, as in option A.

Alternatively, if the purchaser is a BFP without notice, perhaps they can compel the seller to clear the lien. But if the mortgage was recorded, they aren't a BFP.

So, I think the answer is A: Yes, because it's the purchaser's risk for not doing a title search.

The question revolves around whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss in a case where a bona fide purchaser (BFP) sues their grantor (an adult child) to compel payment of an outstanding mortgage. The key facts are:

1. Four original owners conveyed the property to the adult child, subject to a purchase-money mortgage. The adult child took over mortgage payments but later defaulted and sold the property to a BFP who did not conduct a title search.
2. The BFP is now seeking to compel the adult child to pay the mortgage and remove the lien.

The central issue is whether the court will order the adult child to pay the mortgage or dismiss the case. The analysis focuses on the BFP's status and the implications of not conducting a title search.

### Key Analysis:
- **Bona Fide Purchaser Status**: A BFP is typically someone who pays value for the property without actual or constructive notice of prior liens. However, since the mortgage was likely recorded, the BFP had constructive notice, which undermines their BFP status. This means the purchaser cannot claim the protections afforded to a BFP.
- **Risk of Not Conducting a Title Search**: By failing to perform a title search, the purchaser assumed the risk of unknown liens or encumbrances, such as the outstanding mortgage. Courts generally hold that purchasers are responsible for uncovering such issues before closing.
- **Liability of the Adult Child**: While the adult child assumed the mortgage payments, the court cannot compel them to pay the mortgage if they lack the means. The purchaser’s remedy would typically involve addressing the issue of title at the time of closing, which they failed to do.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss because the purchaser assumed the risk of not conducting a title search and cannot compel the adult child to pay the mortgage.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The court cannot order the adult child to resume payments if they are unable to do so.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The court cannot force the adult child to pay the mortgage in full if they lack the financial capacity.

### Conclusion:
The court will likely grant the motion to dismiss because the purchaser’s failure to conduct a title search and their constructive notice of the mortgage mean they cannot compel the adult child to pay the mortgage.
