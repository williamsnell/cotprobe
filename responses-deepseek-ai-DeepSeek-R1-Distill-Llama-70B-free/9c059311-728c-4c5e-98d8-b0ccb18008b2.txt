Okay, so I have this economics question here about price floors. Hmm, I remember that price floors and ceilings are government interventions in markets. Let me think about what each does.

A price floor is a minimum price set above the equilibrium price, right? So when the government sets a price floor, they're setting a price that's higher than what the market equilibrium is. I think this is usually done to help sellers, like farmers or workers, because it ensures they get a certain minimum price for their goods or services.

Wait, so what happens when a price floor is implemented? If the price is set above equilibrium, the quantity supplied would increase because sellers are willing to sell more at the higher price. But the quantity demanded would decrease because consumers aren't as willing to buy at the higher price. So this creates a surplus, right? More supply than demand. So the government might have to intervene to buy up the surplus, like they do with agricultural products sometimes.

Looking at the options, the question is why the government establishes a price floor. So I need to figure out the purpose behind it. The options are A to J.

Option A: Eliminate a surplus. Wait, no, because price floors usually create surpluses, not eliminate them. So that can't be right.

Option B: Protect consumers from price hikes. Hmm, but price floors are about setting a minimum price. If the market price was lower, consumers might prefer lower prices. But if the government sets a floor, prices can't go below that, which might actually lead to higher prices than the market equilibrium. So this might not be protecting consumers; it could be the opposite.

Option C: Increase government revenue. I don't think so. Unless the government is imposing taxes or something, but a price floor itself doesn't directly generate revenue unless they're selling the surplus, but that's not the main purpose.

Option D: Eliminate a shortage. A shortage occurs when demand exceeds supply at the current price. A price floor would cause a surplus, not eliminate a shortage. So probably not D.

Option E: Help buyers of the good. Buyers would want lower prices, so a price floor that sets a higher minimum might not help them. Unless it's in a situation where prices were volatile and buyers wanted stability, but I don't think that's the main reason.

Option F: Promote competition among sellers. I don't see how a price floor would do that. If the price is set, sellers can't lower prices to compete, so maybe it reduces competition. Or perhaps it doesn't directly affect competition much.

Option G: Help sellers of the good. Yes, that makes sense. Sellers benefit because they're assured a minimum price, which can prevent their prices from dropping too low, especially if they're in a market where prices might otherwise be below their costs.

Option H: Control inflation. I'm not sure. Inflation is about general price levels rising. A price floor on a specific good might affect that good's price, but it's not a broad control measure. Plus, if the floor is set too high, it could contribute to inflation in that market, but that's probably not the intent.

Option I: Discourage consumption of the good. Higher prices typically reduce quantity demanded, so maybe it does that, but is that the main reason for a price floor? I think the main reason is to help sellers, not to reduce consumption.

Option J: Reduce production cost. I don't think so. Price floors affect the price, not the costs of production. Sellers might have higher revenue, which could help with costs, but that's not the direct intention.

So the main purpose of a price floor is to help sellers by ensuring they get a minimum price. So the correct answer should be G.

The government establishes a price floor to ensure that sellers receive a minimum price for their goods or services, protecting them from market prices that might fall below a sustainable level. This intervention is typically aimed at helping sellers, such as farmers or workers, by guaranteeing a stable income. While price floors can create surpluses by increasing supply and reducing demand, the primary intent is to support sellers rather than address surpluses, protect consumers, or control inflation.

- **A**: Incorrect. Price floors create surpluses, not eliminate them.
- **B**: Incorrect. Price floors set a minimum price, which could lead to higher prices for consumers, not protect them from price hikes.
- **C**: Incorrect. Price floors do not directly increase government revenue.
- **D**: Incorrect. Price floors cause surpluses, not eliminate shortages.
- **E**: Incorrect. Buyers typically prefer lower prices, and price floors may harm buyers by raising prices.
- **F**: Incorrect. Price floors do not promote competition among sellers.
- **G**: Correct. Price floors are established to help sellers by ensuring a minimum price.
- **H**: Incorrect. Price floors are not a tool for controlling inflation.
- **I**: Incorrect. While higher prices may reduce consumption, this is not the primary purpose of a price floor.
- **J**: Incorrect. Price floors do not reduce production costs.
