Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how the members of an arbitral tribunal are appointed. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is: How are the members of the arbitral tribunal appointed? The options are A, B, and C.

First, I remember that arbitration is a method of dispute resolution where parties agree to have their case decided by one or more arbitrators. The tribunal refers to the panel of arbitrators. Now, how are these members chosen?

I think it's common for parties to have some say in selecting the arbitrators. I've heard that in some cases, each party appoints their own arbitrator, and then those two might choose a third one together. So maybe the parties themselves select the members.

Looking at option A: "All the members are appointed by the parties." That sounds possible because if each party appoints one, and maybe they agree on the third, it's the parties making the appointments.

Option B says all are appointed by an impartial third party, like the ICJ president. I'm not sure about that. I don't think the ICJ is typically involved in appointing arbitrators unless the parties specifically agree to it. But in general, I think the parties usually select them, not a third party unless there's a default mechanism.

Option C mentions a restricted list. I've heard of the "list procedure" where parties are given a list and they pick from it. But does that mean all members are from that list? Or is it just one method available? I'm not certain, but I think the default is that parties can choose freely, not necessarily from a restricted list unless they agree to it.

Wait, in some arbitration rules, like the UNCITRAL rules, if the parties don't agree on the number of arbitrators or can't agree on appointments, a third party (like an institution) might step in. But that's more of a fallback, not the standard procedure.

So, normally, the parties themselves appoint the members. Each party might appoint one arbitrator, and they might jointly appoint the presiding one. So option A seems correct in that all members are appointed by the parties, either directly or through their agreement.

But wait, option C says "from a restricted list". I think that's part of the process in some cases. For example, under the ICSID rules, parties may choose arbitrators from a panel list. But I'm not sure if that's the general rule. The question is general, not specific to any institution.

So if the question is about how it's usually done, I think the answer is A. The parties appoint all the members, perhaps each choosing one and agreeing on the third.

Option B seems less likely because it's not common for all members to be appointed by a third party unless the parties can't agree, which is a different scenario.

So I'm leaning towards A being the correct answer.

The members of an arbitral tribunal are typically appointed by the parties involved in the dispute. Each party usually selects one arbitrator, and the two selected may then agree on a third arbitrator to preside. While there are instances where a third party, such as an institution, might appoint arbitrators if the parties cannot agree, this is not the standard procedure. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that all members are appointed by the parties.

Answer: A
