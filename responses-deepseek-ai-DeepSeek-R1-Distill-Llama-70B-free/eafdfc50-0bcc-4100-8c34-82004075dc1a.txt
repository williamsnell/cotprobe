Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about thermal expansion. Hmm, let's see what it says. An iron steam pipe is 200 feet long at 0°C, and I need to find out how much it'll increase in length when heated to 100°C. The coefficient of linear expansion, alpha, is given as 10 times 10^-6 per degree Celsius. Oh right, I remember that thermal expansion has to do with materials expanding when heated.

Wait, I think the formula for linear expansion is delta L equals alpha times L initial times delta T. Delta L is the change in length, right? So the change is the original length multiplied by the temperature change and the expansion coefficient.

Let me plug in the numbers. The initial length L is 200 ft. The temperature change delta T is from 0 to 100, so that's 100 degrees. Alpha is 10e-6 per °C. So delta L = 200 * 100 * 10e-6.

Wait, let me calculate that. 200 * 100 is 20,000. Multiply that by 1e-5 (since 10e-6 is 1e-5?) Wait, no, 10e-6 is 0.00001, right? So 200 * 100 = 20,000, and 20,000 times 1e-5 is 0.2? Because 20,000 times 0.00001 is 0.2. So delta L is 0.2 feet.

Looking at the options, E is 0.20 ft. So the answer should be E.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Alpha is 10 * 10^-6, which is 1e-5. So 200 ft * 100°C * 1e-5 (per °C) = 200 * 100 * 0.00001. 200 times 100 is 20,000. 20,000 * 0.00001 is 0.2. Yeah, that's right.

So the increase in length is 0.2 feet. So the correct option is E.

To determine the increase in length of the iron steam pipe when heated from 0°C to 100°C, we use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L_{\text{initial}} \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \( \alpha = 10 \times 10^{-6} \, ^\circ\text{C}^{-1} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \, ^\circ\text{C}^{-1} \) (coefficient of linear expansion),
- \( L_{\text{initial}} = 200 \, \text{ft} \) (initial length of the pipe),
- \( \Delta T = 100 \, ^\circ\text{C} - 0 \, ^\circ\text{C} = 100 \, ^\circ\text{C} \) (temperature change).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta L = (1 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 200 \cdot 100
\]

\[
\Delta L = 0.2 \, \text{ft}
\]

Thus, the increase in length of the pipe is 0.2 feet. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.20 ft**
