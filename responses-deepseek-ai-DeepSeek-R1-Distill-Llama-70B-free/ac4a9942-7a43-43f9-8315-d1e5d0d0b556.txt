Okay, so I've got this economics question here about cross-price elasticity. Hmm, I remember that cross-price elasticity measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. The formula is something like (percentage change in Qd of X) divided by (percentage change in price of Y). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll have to think this through.

The question says that the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0. I need to figure out what this implies about their relationship. Let me recall: cross-price elasticity can be positive or negative. If it's positive, that suggests that when the price of Y increases, the quantity demanded of X also increases. That makes sense because if two goods are substitutes, like Coke and Pepsi, when one becomes more expensive, people buy more of the other. So a positive elasticity would mean they're substitutes.

Wait, but what about complementary goods? Right, complementary goods are like cars and gasoline. If the price of gasoline goes up, people might buy fewer cars, which would mean the quantity demanded of cars (X) would decrease. So that would give a negative cross-price elasticity because an increase in Y's price leads to a decrease in X's quantity demanded.

So in this case, the cross-price elasticity is +2.0, which is positive. That points towards substitutes. Let me check the options. Option D says they are substitute goods, which seems right. 

What about the other options? Option A says independent goods. I think independent goods have zero cross-price elasticity because a change in one's price doesn't affect the other. So not A. 

Option B is Giffen goods. Giffen goods are a type of inferior good where the demand increases when price increases. But I don't think that's directly related to cross-price elasticity being positive. Wait, Giffen goods would have a positive own-price elasticity because demand goes up when price increases. But cross-price? Not sure, maybe not directly relevant here.

Option C is luxury goods. Luxury goods are about income elasticity, not cross-price. So no. Option E is Veblen goods, which are like snob appeal goods where higher price increases demand. Again, related to own-price elasticity, not cross. 

Option F is normal goodsâ€”again, about income elasticity. Normal goods have positive income elasticity. So not relevant to cross-price. Option G is inferior goods, which have negative income elasticity. But cross-price being positive doesn't directly indicate they're inferior. 

Option H is perfect substitutes. Perfect substitutes would have infinite cross-price elasticity, I think, because a small change in price would cause a massive shift. So a cross-price elasticity of 2.0 isn't perfect substitutes; it's just substitutes. So H is incorrect.

Option I says the demand for X is unit elastic with respect to Y's price. Unit elastic would mean the elasticity is exactly 1. But here it's 2.0, so I is incorrect.

Option J is complementary goods, which we already determined would have a negative cross-price elasticity, so J is out.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: substitute goods. Positive cross-price elasticity indicates that the goods are substitutes.

The cross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. A positive cross-price elasticity indicates that as the price of one good increases, the quantity demanded of the other good also increases. This relationship is characteristic of substitute goods, such as Coke and Pepsi, where consumers can switch between the two based on price changes.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Independent goods** have zero cross-price elasticity, meaning a change in one good's price does not affect the other. This is incorrect.
- **B: Giffen goods** are a type of inferior good with a positive own-price elasticity, but this does not relate to cross-price elasticity being positive. Incorrect.
- **C: Luxury goods** pertain to income elasticity, not cross-price elasticity. Incorrect.
- **D: Substitute goods** are consistent with a positive cross-price elasticity, as an increase in one good's price leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other. Correct.
- **E: Veblen goods** involve a positive own-price elasticity due to prestige value, not cross-price elasticity. Incorrect.
- **F: Normal goods** relate to positive income elasticity, not cross-price elasticity. Incorrect.
- **G: Inferior goods** have negative income elasticity, but cross-price elasticity being positive does not indicate inferiority. Incorrect.
- **H: Perfect substitutes** would have an infinite cross-price elasticity, not a value of 2.0. Incorrect.
- **I: Unit elastic demand** would require an elasticity of 1, not 2.0. Incorrect.
- **J: Complementary goods** have a negative cross-price elasticity, as an increase in one good's price decreases the demand for the other. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **D: goods X and Y are substitute goods**.
