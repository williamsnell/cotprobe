Question:

A landlord is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land on which is situated a large office building. The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions:"(1) The tenant covenants to pay the rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. "After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to an attorney, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. After the doctor failed to make his rental payments for the first two months of his lease, the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the tenant, because he was not directly responsible for the doctor's failure to pay rent.
B: the landlord, because the tenant and the assignees breached the lease agreement.
C: the tenant, because the landlord did not take action when the doctor failed to pay rent.
D: the tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.
E: the tenant, because the landlord did not formally approve the assignments.
F: the landlord, because he did not object to the assignments.
G: the landlord, because the doctor, as the final assignee, failed to fulfill his obligation to pay rent.
H: the tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.
I: the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.
J: the landlord, because the attorney failed to pay rent for two months.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this landlord-tenant law question. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

So, the landlord owns a tract of land with an office building and leased it to a tenant for seven years, from August 1, 2001, to July 31, 2008. The lease says the tenant must pay $750 monthly on the first day of each month.

After three years, the tenant assigned the entire remaining lease period to an attorney. The attorney took possession right away. Then, in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor moved in but didn't pay rent for the first two months. The landlord sued the tenant for the unpaid rent. The question is, who should win?

Hmm. So the key here is understanding lease assignments and the tenant's liability after assigning the lease. I remember that when a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee (the new tenant) takes over the obligations, but the original tenant might still be liable unless there's a novation.

Wait, what's a novation again? Oh right, a novation is when the landlord agrees to substitute the new tenant, releasing the original tenant from liability. Without a novation, the original tenant remains liable.

In this case, the lease was assigned twice: first from tenant to attorney, then attorney to doctor. So the original tenant assigned to the attorney, who then assigned to the doctor. The landlord didn't approve these assignments explicitly, as far as I can tell from the problem.

So the question is, is the original tenant still on the hook for the unpaid rent when the doctor stops paying?

I think the general rule is that when a tenant assigns the lease, the assignee becomes responsible, but the tenant remains liable unless the landlord has agreed to release them. So the tenant here is still liable because there's no mention of a novation or the landlord releasing them.

Looking at the options:

Option I: The landlord, because the tenant's obligation survived the assignments. That sounds right because the tenant is still liable.

Option H says the assignment was a novation, which I don't think is the case because the problem doesn't mention the landlord agreeing to substitute.

Options A, C, D, E: These seem to suggest the tenant isn't responsible, but I think they are because the assignment doesn't release them without landlord's approval.

Options B, G, J: B says both tenant and assignees breached. Maybe, but the suit is against the tenant. G says the doctor failed, so landlord can sue tenant because tenant is still liable. J says because attorney didn't pay, but the problem is about the doctor not paying.

Wait, the doctor didn't pay for two months. So the landlord is suing the tenant for those two months. Since the tenant is still liable, the landlord should win.

So the correct answer would be I, where the landlord can recover from the tenant because the tenant's obligation wasn't extinguished.

The question revolves around the landlord's ability to recover unpaid rent from the original tenant after the lease was assigned twice. The tenant assigned the lease to an attorney, who then assigned it to a doctor. The doctor failed to pay rent for two months, prompting the landlord to sue the original tenant. 

Under landlord-tenant law, when a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee becomes responsible for fulfilling the lease obligations. However, the original tenant remains liable unless there is a novationâ€”where the landlord explicitly agrees to release the original tenant from liability. In this case, there is no indication that the landlord approved the assignments or agreed to a novation. Therefore, the original tenant's obligation under the lease survives the assignments and remains enforceable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** is correct because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments, making the tenant liable for the unpaid rent.
- Other options are incorrect because they either mischaracterize the tenant's liability, ignore the lack of novation, or improperly focus on the actions of the assignees rather than the tenant's ongoing responsibility.

Thus, the landlord is entitled to recover the unpaid rent from the tenant.

Answer: I
