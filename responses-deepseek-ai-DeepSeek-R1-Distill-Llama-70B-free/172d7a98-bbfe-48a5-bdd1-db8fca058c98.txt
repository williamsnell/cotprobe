Question:

Calculate the number of moles of air in a column 1 cm^2 in area and rising from sea level to an altitude of 1.5 × 10^6 cm (about 10 miles), allowing for the barometric decrease in pressure. Assume air to be a uniform gas of molecular weight 29, and a uniform temperature of 0°C. Note that the atmospheric pressure is equal to the total weight of gas in a column of unit area and of infinite height. Conversion factors: R = 0.082 liter-atm/mole-deg = 8.31 × 10^7 ergs/mole-deg = 1.98 cal/mole-deg; 1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 1 × 10^6 dynes/cm^2.

Options:

A: 25.6 moles
B: 26.5 moles
C: 33.6 moles
D: 28.5 moles
E: 32.4 moles
F: 20.3 moles
G: 29.8 moles
H: 27.2 moles
I: 31.7 moles
J: 34.1 moles

Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about calculating moles of air in a column. I remember some concepts from chemistry, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply them here. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have a column of air with an area of 1 cm², extending from sea level to an altitude of 1.5e6 cm, which is about 10 miles. We need to find the number of moles of air in this column, considering the barometric decrease in pressure. Oh right, barometric pressure decreases with altitude.

The problem gives us some constants: molecular weight of air is 29 g/mol. Temperature is 0°C, which is 273 K. Oh, and atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atm, which equals the weight of the gas in a column of unit area and infinite height. Hmm. Also, the conversion factors are provided, like R values in different units. I think R is the gas constant, right? 0.082 L·atm/mol·K, or 8.31e7 erg/mol·K, or 1.98 cal/mol·K. Also, 1 atm is 760 mm Hg or 1e6 dynes/cm².

Wait, so the key here is that the pressure decreases with height, so the air isn't at uniform pressure. That means I can't just use the ideal gas law (PV = nRT) directly because pressure varies. Instead, I think I need to integrate over the height, considering how pressure changes with altitude.

I remember that the barometric formula relates pressure to altitude. The formula is P = P0 * exp(-Mgh/(RT)), where P0 is the pressure at sea level, M is molar mass, g is gravity, h is height, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. Oh wait, but wait: maybe that's an approximation. Alternatively, assuming the atmosphere is at constant temperature (which is given as 0°C here), the pressure decreases exponentially with height.

But wait, another approach: the total number of moles in the column can be found by considering the atmospheric pressure as the weight of the air. Hmm, the question says that atmospheric pressure equals the total weight of gas in a column of unit area and infinite height. So, maybe we can model the atmosphere as a column where the pressure P is equal to the weight of the air above.

Let me think. The pressure at any point in the atmosphere is due to the weight of the air above it. So for a small slice of air at height h with thickness dh, its mass would be (volume * density). But density is mass/volume, so mass is density * volume. Then, the weight (force) would be mass * g. So dP (the pressure from this slice) is equal to density * g * dV. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it.

Alternatively, the pressure decreases with height because the weight of the air above decreases as you go higher. So, the pressure gradient dP/dh = -density * g. Because as you go up (dh positive), the pressure decreases (dP negative). 

Using the ideal gas law, density (rho) is (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass. So, substituting into the pressure gradient:

dP/dh = - (PM/(RT)) * g

This is a differential equation. Let me write it as dP/P = -(Mg/(RT)) dh. Integrating both sides from 0 to h, with P from P0 to P.

So the integral of dP/P from P0 to P is ln(P/P0) = -(Mg/(RT)) * h. 

Which gives P = P0 exp(-Mgh/(RT)), which matches the barometric formula I thought earlier.

But wait, in this problem, we're looking for the total number of moles in the column. So perhaps we can model the total moles as the integral from h=0 to h=H of (P(h) / (RT)) * A dh, where A is the area. But since the area is 1 cm² and we're considering a column, maybe the volume element is A * dh. 

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT). But since P varies with h, the number of moles in a thin slice dh at height h would be (P(h) * A dh) / (RT), since volume is A dh.

So the total n is the integral from 0 to H of (P(h) * A) / (RT) dh.

Which is (A/(RT)) ∫ P(h) dh from 0 to H.

But P(h) = P0 exp(-Mgh/(RT)), so substituting:

n = (A P0)/(RT) ∫ exp(-Mgh/(RT)) dh from 0 to H.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = Mgh/(RT), so du = (Mg/(RT)) dh. Then, dh = (RT/Mg) du.

Then, the integral becomes (RT/(Mg)) ∫ exp(-u) du from u=0 to u= Mgh_max/(RT).

Which is (RT/(Mg)) [ -exp(-u) ] from 0 to (MgH)/(RT) )

Evaluating, it becomes (RT/(Mg)) [1 - exp(-MgH/(RT)) ].

So putting it all together:

n = (A P0/(RT)) * (RT/(Mg)) [1 - exp(-MgH/(RT)) ]

Simplify this expression.

A is 1 cm². P0 is 1 atm. R is 0.082 L·atm/mol·K, but wait, in the integral we have units involving pressure in dynes/cm², maybe? Hmm, I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Wait, let's check the units. H is given in cm, which is 1.5e6 cm. Hmm, but in the formula, H is in proper units (like meters) depending on R's units.

Wait, R is given as 8.31e7 erg/mol·K. Since 1 erg is 1 dyne·cm, and 1 atm is 1e6 dynes/cm². So perhaps using R in erg units would be better. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's compute each term step by step, making sure about the units.

First, let me gather all the necessary values and ensure their units are compatible.

Given:

- A = 1 cm²
- H = 1.5e6 cm = 1.5e4 meters (since 1 m = 100 cm, so 1.5e6 cm /100 = 1.5e4 m)
Wait wait, 1.5e6 cm is 15,000,000 cm. 1 meter is 100 cm, so 15,000,000 / 100 = 150,000 meters, which is 150 km. Wait, 1.5e6 cm is 15,000 meters? Wait, 1 m is 100 cm, so 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 1.5e6 cm * 0.01 m/cm = 1.5e4 meters, which is 15,000 meters or 15 km. Wait, but the question says about 10 miles. Oh, wait 1 mile is about 1.6 km, so 10 miles is 16 km. So 15 km is close enough. So H = 1.5e4 meters.

Wait, but maybe I should convert H to cm because pressure is given in terms of 1e6 dynes/cm². Let me think about units in the exponent MgH/(RT).

M is molar mass: 29 g/mol. Let's convert that to erg·s²/cm²? Not sure. Wait, R is 8.31e7 erg/mol·K. So R is in erg per mole per K. So to make the units work in the exponent, which must be dimensionless.

So, M is in grams/mol. g is in cm/s². H is in cm. R is in erg/mol·K. T is in K.

So let's put all in cgs units.

M = 29 g/mol = 29 g/mol.

g = 980 cm/s².

H = 1.5e6 cm.

R = 8.31e7 erg/mol·K.

T = 273 K.

So the exponent is (M * g * H) / (R * T).

Wait, M is in g/mol, g is cm/s², H is cm. R is erg/mol·K, which is (g·cm²/s²·mol·K). So let's compute the units:

(M g H) has units (g/mol) * (cm/s²) * cm = (g cm²)/(mol s²).

Denominator (R T) is (g cm²/(s² mol K)) * K = (g cm²)/(s² mol).

So the exponent's unit is (g cm²/mol s²) / (g cm²/(s² mol)) ) = ( (g cm²)/(mol s²) ) * (s² mol)/(g cm²) ) ) = dimensionless. So that's correct.

So let's compute the exponent.

Compute numerator: M g H = 29 g/mol * 980 cm/s² * 1.5e6 cm.

Wait, 29 * 980 = let's compute 29*1000 is 29,000, minus 29*20=580, so 29,000-580=28,420.

So 28,420 * 1.5e6 cm²/s²·mol.

Wait, but units: 29 g/mol * 980 cm/s² = (29 *980) g cm/(mol s²). Multiply by H (1.5e6 cm): 29 *980 * 1.5e6 (g cm²)/(mol s²).

Denominator: R*T =8.31e7 erg/mol·K * 273 K. Since erg is g cm²/s², this becomes (8.31e7 *273) (g cm²/s²) / mol.

So exponent is (M g H) / (R T) = [ 29 *980 *1.5e6 ] / (8.31e7 *273 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Compute numerator: 29 *980 = 28420. 28420 *1.5e6 = 28420 * 1,500,000 = 42,630,000,000. Hmm, 28420 * 1.5e6 is 28420 * 1.5 * 1e6: 28420 *1.5 is 42,630, so times 1e6 is 4.263e10.

Denominator: 8.31e7 *273 = 8.31e7 * ~2.73e2 = approx 2.27e10.

So exponent is 4.263e10 / 2.27e10 ≈ 1.877.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute denominator: 8.31e7 * 273.

8.31e7 = 83,100,000.

83,100,000 * 273 = let's compute 83,100,000 * 200 = 16,620,000,000.

83,100,000 * 73 = ?

83,100,000 *70=5,817,000,000.

83,100,000 *3=249,300,000.

Total of 5,817,000,000 +249,300,000 =6,066,300,000.

So total denominator is 16,620e6 +6,066.3e6 =22,686.3e6 =2.26863e10.

Numerator is 29 * 980 * 1.5e6.

29 *980 = 28,420.

28,420 *1.5e6 = 4.263e10.

So exponent is 4.263e10 / 2.26863e10 ≈ 1.878.

So u = 1.878.

So the integral [1 - exp(-u)] is 1 - exp(-1.878).

Compute exp(-1.878): approximately. Since exp(-2) is about 0.135, exp(-1.8) is about 0.165, exp(-1.878) would be a bit lower than 0.165. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach: 1.878 is approximately 1.88.

We know that ln(2) is about 0.693, e^(-1.6)= about 0.2019, e^(-1.8)=0.1653, e^(-1.9)=0.1496, e^(-2)=0.1353.

So e^(-1.88) is between e^(-1.8) and e^(-1.9). Let's interpolate.

The difference between 1.8 and 1.9 is 0.1, and between 0.1653 and 0.1496 is -0.0157.

At 1.88, which is 0.08 above 1.8, so 80% of the way from 1.8 to 1.9.

So 0.1653 - 0.0157 * 0.8 = 0.1653 - 0.01256 = 0.15274.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the function is exponential, it's not linear. Alternatively, perhaps using a Taylor approximation. But maybe it's easier to just accept that e^(-1.878)=approx 0.153.

So 1 - e^(-1.878) ≈ 1 - 0.153=0.847.

So the term [1 - exp(-MgH/(RT))] is approximately 0.847.

Now, compute n.

n = (A P0/(RT)) * (RT/(Mg)) * [1 - exp(-MgH/(RT)) ]

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, in the expression we had:

n = (A P0/(RT)) * (RT/(Mg)) * [1 - exp(-u)]

Wait, wait, earlier when substituting, I think I messed up. Let me re-express.

Wait, no, in the integral, we had:

n = (A P0/(RT)) * (RT/(Mg)) [1 - exp(-u)] )

So the RT in the numerator and denominator cancels out.

So n = (A P0/(M g)) [1 - exp(-u)].

Wait, that's a much simpler expression. So n = (A P0 (1 - exp(-u)) ) / (M g).

Wait, that makes sense because P0 is the pressure at the bottom, and as you go up, the pressure decreases.

Wait, so n = (A P0 / (M g)) [1 - exp(-MgH/(R T)) ]

But wait, let me double-check the units.

A is in cm². P0 is in dynes/cm² (since 1 atm =1e6 dynes/cm²). M is in g/mol. g is cm/s².

So (A * P0) has units cm² * (dynes/cm²) )= dynes.

(M g) has units (g/mol) * (cm/s²) )= (g cm)/(mol s²).

So n has units (dynes) / ( (g cm)/(mol s²) ) )

But 1 dyne is g cm/s².

So (dynes) is g cm/s².

So the units are (g cm/s²) / ( (g cm)/(mol s²) ) ) = mol.

Yes, correct.

So n = (A P0 (1 - exp(-u)) ) / (M g )

Now, plugging in the numbers.

A =1 cm².

P0 = 1 atm = 1e6 dynes/cm².

M =29 g/mol.

g =980 cm/s².

So:

n = (1 * 1e6 * (1 - exp(-1.878)) ) / (29 * 980 )

Compute numerator: 1e6 * 0.847 ≈ 8.47e5.

Denominator: 29 *980 = 29 * 980.

29 * 1000 =29,000, so 29*980=29*(1000-20) =29,000 - 580 =28,420.

So denominator is 28,420.

So n = 8.47e5 / 2.842e4 ≈ let's compute that.

8.47e5 is 847,000.

847,000 / 28,420 ≈ let's divide 847000 ÷ 28,420.

Approximately:

28,420 * 29.8 ≈ 28,420 * 30 = 852,600. But since 28,420 *29.8 = 852,600 - (28,420 * 0.2) → 852,600 -5,684=846,916.

Which is very close to 847,000.

So 28,420 *29.8 ≈ 846,916 → which is 84 less than 847,000.

So 29.8 + (84 / 28,420) → approximately 29.8 + 0.00295 ≈ 29.8.

So n≈29.8 moles.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 29.8, which would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations, as I might have made an error.

Wait, earlier when I computed [1 - exp(-u)] as approximately 0.847, that when multiplied by 1e6 gives 8.47e5.

Divide that by (29 *980) = 28,420:

8.47e5 / 2.842e4 → let me do it more accurately.

Compute 847000 ÷ 28420.

Divide 847000 by 28420.

Let me compute 28420 * 29.8:

28420 * 29 = ?

28420 *30 =852600 → subtract 28420 → 852600-28420=824180.

Then 28420 * 0.8=22736.

So 824180 +22736=846,916.

Which is 84 less than 847,000.

So 28420 *29.8 =846,916.

The difference is 847,000 -846,916=84.

So 84 /28,420 ≈ 0.002957.

So total n≈29.8 +0.002957≈29.8 mo
