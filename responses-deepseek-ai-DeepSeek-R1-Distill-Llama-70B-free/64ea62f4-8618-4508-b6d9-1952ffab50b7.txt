Okay, so I've got this gas problem to solve. Let's see what it says. Hmm, we're supposed to find the pressure required to compress a gas under certain conditions. Alright, I remember from my chemistry class that this has to do with the gas laws. But wait, which one exactly?

The problem states that we have 2 liters of gas at 700 mm pressure and 20°C, and we need to compress it into a 0.1-liter container at -150°C. Oh right, this sounds like the combined gas law because both pressure and temperature are changing, and the amount of gas (moles) is constant.

The combined gas law formula is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. Yeah, that's it. So I can plug in the values here.

Wait, but I need to make sure the temperatures are in Kelvin. Oh right, because gas laws require absolute temperatures. So for the initial temperature T1, 20°C is 293 K (because 20 + 273 = 293). And the final temperature T2 is -150°C. Oh wait, that's colder than room temperature. So I need to convert that too. Let me calculate: -150 + 273 = 123 K. Got it.

So P1 is 700 mmHg, V1 is 2 liters, T1 is 293 K. P2 is what we're solving for, V2 is 0.1 liters, and T2 is 123 K.

Plugging into the formula: P2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (V2 * T1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, multiply P1, V1, and T2: 700 mmHg * 2 L * 123 K. Let's do 700 * 2 first. That's 1400. Then 1400 * 123. Hmm, 1400 * 100 is 140,000, 1400 * 20 is 28,000, and 1400 *3 is 4,200. So adding those: 140k + 28k = 168k, plus 4.2k is 172,200. So numerator is 172,200.

Denominator is V2 * T1: 0.1 L * 293 K. 0.1 * 293 is 29.3.

So P2 is 172200 divided by 29.3. Let me do that division. Hmm, 172200 / 29.3. Let's see, 29.3 times 5000 is 146,500. Subtracting that from 172200 gives 25,700. Then, 29.3 times 800 is about 23,440. So 5000 + 800 = 5800, and 25,700 -23,440 is 2,260. Then 29.3 * 77 is around 2256.1. So 77 more. So total would be 5000 + 800 +77 = 5877.

Wait, but let me make sure I did that right. Maybe I should use a calculator approach. Wait, 29.3 * 5877? No, wait, I'm dividing 172200 by 29.3.

Alternatively, I could write it as 172200 ÷ 29.3. Let me see: 29.3 * 5877 ≈ 172200. So the calculation gives P2 as approximately 5877 mmHg.

Looking at the options, option C is 5877 mm. So that should be the answer. Oh wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the numbers.

Let me recalculate the numerator: 700 * 2 =1400, 1400 *123 = 172200. Correct. Denominator: 0.1 *293=29.3. Correct.

172200 divided by 29.3. Let me compute 29.3 * 5877.

Wait, 29.3 * 5000 is 146500.

29.3 * 800 is 23440. Adding those gives 146500 +23440=169,940.

Then, 29.3 *77 = let's compute 29.3*70=2051, 29.3*7=205.1, so total 2051+205.1=2256.1.

Adding 169940 + 2256.1= 172,196.1. Which is very close to 172200, so my P2 is approximately 5877 mmHg. So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C} = 20 + 273 = 293 \, \text{K} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = -150^\circ \text{C} = -150 + 273 = 123 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Identify known values
- \( P_1 = 700 \, \text{mmHg} \)
- \( V_1 = 2 \, \text{L} \)
- \( V_2 = 0.1 \, \text{L} \)

### Step 3: Rearrange the formula to solve for \( P_2 \):
\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{V_2 T_1}
\]

### Step 4: Substitute values and calculate
\[
P_2 = \frac{700 \cdot 2 \cdot 123}{0.1 \cdot 293}
\]

1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   700 \cdot 2 = 1400, \quad 1400 \cdot 123 = 172,200
   \]

2. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   0.1 \cdot 293 = 29.3
   \]

3. Divide:
   \[
   P_2 = \frac{172,200}{29.3} \approx 5877 \, \text{mmHg}
   \]

### Step 5: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated pressure is approximately \( 5877 \, \text{mmHg} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
