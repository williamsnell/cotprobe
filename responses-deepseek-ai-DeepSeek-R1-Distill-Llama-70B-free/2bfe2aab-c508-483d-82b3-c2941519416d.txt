Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the formation of sodium chloride and the equilibrium partial pressure of chlorine gas at different temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break this down.

The reaction given is Na(s) + (1/2)Cl2(g) ⇌ NaCl(s). The standard heat of formation is -98.6 kcal/mol, and it's temperature independent. So, I guess that means the ΔH doesn't change with temperature, which might simplify things.

The problem states that at 773 K, the partial pressure of chlorine gas is 1.672 × 10^-43 mmHg. And we're supposed to find the equilibrium partial pressure at 823 K. The options are all in various units, some in atm and some way too big or small, so I need to be careful with units.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with reactions at equilibrium, especially when they involve gases, the Van 't Hoff equation is useful. The Van 't Hoff equation relates the change in the equilibrium constant with temperature to the standard enthalpy change of the reaction. The equation is ln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/(R) [1/T2 - 1/T1], right?

But wait, in this case, what is K for this reaction? The reaction is Na(s) plus half Cl2(g) forming NaCl(s). Since Na and NaCl are solids, their activities are 1, so the equilibrium expression should only involve the partial pressure of Cl2. So K would be 1/(P_Cl2)^(1/2). Because K is products over reactants, and the products are NaCl (activity 1), so K = 1 / (Cl2)^(1/2).

So, K = 1 / (P_Cl2)^(1/2). Therefore, (P_Cl2) = 1/K². Hmm, or wait, K = 1/(P^(1/2)), so P = (1/K)^2. So if I can find K at each temperature, I can find P.

But K is temperature-dependent. The Van 't Hoff equation will help here. So I need to find how K changes with temperature.

Given that ΔH° is negative (-98.6 kcal/mol), the reaction is exothermic. So, according to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the temperature should shift the equilibrium to the left, increasing the partial pressure of Cl2 because the reverse reaction is favored. So at higher temperatures, P_Cl2 should be higher. Looking at the options, let's see which have higher pressures.

Wait, but wait—the given P at 773 K is 1.672e-43 mmHg. That's a really tiny pressure. At higher temp (823 K), since the reaction is exothermic, K decreases, so 1/K increases, so P increases. So the new P should be higher than before. Let me check the options. The options are in atm, except the given is in mmHg.

Wait, I should probably convert units first. The given P is in mmHg, and I might need to convert it to atm to use in the Van 't Hoff equation. Because R is usually in J or cal units, and pressure units need to be consistent.

Wait, no, because in the Van 't Hoff equation, K is unitless, so the pressure terms are in terms of activity relative to standard pressure (1 atm). So maybe I can work in mmHg, but I need to make sure the pressures are converted to a consistent unit. Alternatively, since the pressure is so low, maybe it's better to convert to atm.

Standard pressure is 1 atm = 760 mmHg. So 1.672e-43 mmHg is P1. Let me convert that to atm: P1 = (1.672e-43 mmHg) / 760 mmHg/atm ≈ 2.20e-46 atm. That's a really small pressure.

So at T1 = 773 K, P1 = 2.20e-46 atm. Then at T2 = 823 K, we need to find P2.

But wait, the Van 't Hoff equation uses K, not P directly. So I need to relate K1 and K2. Since K = 1/(P_Cl2)^(1/2), so:

K1 = 1 / sqrt(P1)
Similarly, K2 = 1 / sqrt(P2)

So, K2/K1 = sqrt(P1/P2)

Wait, let's think again. Let me write K for each temperature.

At T1: K1 = 1 / (P1)^(1/2)

At T2: K2 = 1 / (P2)^(1/2)

So, K2/K1 = (1/sqrt(P2)) / (1/sqrt(P1)) ) = sqrt(P1/P2)

So, ln(K2/K1) = 0.5 * ln(P1/P2 )

But according to Van 't Hoff equation,

ln(K2/K1) = (-ΔH°/R) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but what's the correct form of the Van 't Hoff equation? Let me recall. It can be written as ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) / (1), assuming ΔH° is constant. Wait, I might have the sign wrong.

The correct Van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) ( 1/T1 - 1/T2 ) / (1) )

But wait, ΔH° is negative here. Because the reaction is exothermic (heat is released), so ΔH° is negative.

Wait, the Van 't Hoff equation can be written as ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1)

But wait, I think another version is:

ln(K2/K1) = -(ΔH°/R) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me be precise. The Van 't Hoff equation is derived from the Gibbs free energy equation: ΔG° = -RT ln K.

For the reaction, ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. So, ΔG° = -RT ln K → RT ln K = -ΔG° = - (ΔH° - TΔS° )

But solving for ln K:

ln K = -ΔH°/(R T) + ΔS°/R

So, the slope of ln K vs 1/T is -ΔH°/R.

So, the equation is ln K2 - ln K1 = ( -ΔH°/R )(1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, because:

ln K2 - ln K1 = [ (-ΔH°/(R T2)) + ΔS°/R ]

minus [ (-ΔH°/(R T1)) + ΔS°/R ]

So the ΔS°/R terms cancel. What remains is:

(-ΔH°/(R T2)) + ΔH°/(R T1) ) = ΔH°/(R) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So,

ln (K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Yes, that's correct. So, substituting the numbers.

But wait, what is the sign of ΔH°? The reaction as written is Na(s) + (1/2)Cl2(g) → NaCl(s). The standard heat of formation is -98.6 kcal/mol. So, ΔH° is negative, -98,600 cal/mol because 1 kcal = 1000 cal.

Wait, wait, wait. The standard heat of formation (ΔHf°) is given as -98.6 kcal per mole. So, for this reaction, which forms one mole of NaCl, the ΔH° is -98.6 kcal/mol. So yes, negative.

So, substituting:

ln(K2/K1) = ( (-98600 cal/mol) / ( R ) ) * ( 1/773 - 1/823 )

Wait, R is the gas constant. But in which units? Since ΔH is in cal, R should be 1.987 cal/(mol·K), I think.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, which is 8.314/1000 cal/(mol·K) = 0.008314 cal/(mol·K). Or wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J, so R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Because 8.314 J/(mol·K) * (1 cal / 4.184 J) ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, putting it all together.

Compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/773 - 1/823). Let's compute this.

Compute 1/773 ≈ 0.0012942 and 1/823≈0.0012153.

So, 0.0012942 - 0.0012153 ≈ 0.0000789 K⁻¹.

So, 1/T1 - 1/T2 ≈ 7.89e-5 K⁻¹.

Then, (ΔH°/R) is (-98600 cal/mol) / (1.987 cal/mol·K) ≈ (-98600 / 1.987) ≈ -49,640 K.

Wait, let me compute that.

98600 / 1.987 → 98600 / 2 is about 49,300. But 1.987 is slightly less than 2, so 49,300 * (2/1.987) ≈ 49,300 * 1.006 → ~49,600. So approximately -49,640 K.

Then, multiply by (7.89e-5 K⁻¹):

-49640 K * 7.89e-5 K⁻¹ = -49640 * 7.89e-5 ≈ Let's compute 49640 * 7.89e-5.

Compute 49640 * 7.89e-5:

First, 49640 *7.89 = let's compute:

49640 *7 = 347480

49640 *0.89 = approx 49640*(0.8) = 39712 and 49640*(0.09)=4467.6 → total 39712+4467.6=44179.6

So total 347480 +44179.6 ≈ 391,659.6.

Then multiply by 1e-5: 391659.6e-5 = 39.16596.

So, so the product is approximately -39.166.

So, ln(K2/K1) ≈ -39.166.

So, K2/K1 = e^(-39.166) ≈ Let's compute that.

e^39 is a huge number. e^10≈22026, e^20≈4.85e8, e^30≈1e13, e^40≈2e17. So e^39 ≈ 1.7e17. So e^-39≈ 5.88e-18.

Wait, more accurately, but perhaps we can just keep it as e^-39.166.

But wait, let me think about this. Because this is ln(K2/K1) = -39.166, so K2 = K1 * e^(-39.166)

But earlier, I had that K = 1/sqrt(P). So K is inversely proportional to sqrt(P). So, K2 = K1 * e^(-39.166) → (1/sqrt(P2)) = (1/sqrt(P1)) * e^(-39.166)

So, sqrt(P2) = sqrt(P1) * e^(39.166) → P2 = P1 * [e^(39.166)]² = P1 * e^(78.332)

Wait, but that would make P2 much larger than P1, which makes sense because increasing temperature for an exothermic reaction shifts to left, so Cl2 increases. So P2 is P1 multiplied by e^(78.332).

But wait, let's compute e^78.332.

Wait, e^78 is a gigantic number. e^10≈22026, e^20≈4.85e8, e^30≈1e13, e^40≈2e17, e^50≈5e21, e^60≈8e25, e^70≈2e30, e^78≈ 3e33 (since e^70≈2.45e30, e^8≈2980, so e^78≈2.45e30 * 2980 ≈7.3e33). So e^78.332 is about 7.3e33 multiplied by e^0.332≈1.394 → ~1.018e34.

So, e^(78.332)≈1.0e34. So P2 ≈ P1 * (1e34).

Wait, but P1 is 2.2e-46 atm. So P2 ≈ 2.2e-46 atm * 1e34 → 2.2e-12 atm.

Wait, that's 2.2e-12 atm, which is 2.2e-12 mmHg * (1/760) → but wait, no, because 1 atm = 760 mmHg. So 2.2e-12 atm is 2.2e-12 *760 mmHg = 1.67e-9 mmHg.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer choices are all in atm except for the initial given. The options are A through J, with option A being 1.01e-41 atm, which is much smaller than 2.2e-12 atm. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Van 't Hoff setup. Let me double-check.

The reaction is Na(s) + (1/2)Cl2(g) → NaCl(s). The equilibrium expression is K = 1/(P_Cl2)^(1/2), because the reaction is as written, and solids have activity 1.

So, K is inversely proportional to sqrt(P_Cl2). So when K decreases, P increases, which aligns with our earlier reasoning.

So, using the Van 't Hoff equation:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

We have ΔH° = -98,600 cal/mol (since it's -98.6 kcal/mol), R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So,

ln(K2/K1) = (-98600 / 1.987) * (1/773 - 1/823 )

Compute 1/773 ≈ 0.0012942, 1/823≈0.0012153.

So 1/773 -1/823 ≈ 0.0000789.

Then,

(ΔH°/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) → (-98600/1.987) * 0.0000789 → Let's compute that.

First, 98600 / 1.987 ≈ 98600 / 2 → 49,300, but 1.987 is a bit less than 2, so it's about 49,640.

So, 49,640 * 0.0000789 → 49,640 * 7.89e-5 → let's compute.

Let me compute 49640 * 7.89e-5.

Multiply 49640 by 7.89e-5:

= 49640 * 7.89 * 1e-5

Compute 49640 *7.89:

= 49640 *7 = 347,480

49640 *0.89 → 49640*(0.8 + 0.09) = 396, (49640*0.8=39,712) and 49640*0.09=4,467.6 → total 44,179.6.

So total 347,480 +44,179.6 = 391,659.6.

Multiply by 1e-5 → 391,659.6e-5 = 39.16596.

So, 49,640 * 0.0000789 ≈ -39.166 (because ΔH is negative).

So, ln(K2/K1) = -39.166 → K2 = K1 * e^(-39.166)

But K1 = 1/(sqrt(P1)) → P1 is given. Wait, earlier I converted P1 to atm, right? P1 was 1.672e-43 mmHg, which is 1.672e-43 /760 → approximately 2.2e-46 atm.

So, K1 = 1/sqrt(2.2e-46) → sqrt(2.2e-46) is sqrt(2.2)*1e-23 → approx 1.483 *1e-23 → 1.483e-23.

So K1 ≈ 1/(1.483e-23) ≈ 6.74e22.

Then, K2 = K1 * e^(-39.166) → K2 ≈ 6.74e22 * e^(-39.166) → e^(-39.166) is about 3e-17, as before.

So, K2 ≈ 6.74e22 * 3e-17 → 2.022e6.

But K2 = 1/sqrt(P2) → so sqrt(P2) = 1/K2 → 1/(2.022e6) ≈ 4.94e-7.

Then, P2 = (4.94e-7)^2 ≈ 2.44e-13 atm.

Wait, but that's 2.44e-13 atm. Looking at the options, option H is 4.56e-40 atm. Not close. Option F is 3.33e-42 atm. Also not. Option C is 5.40e-43 atm. Hmm, none of the options match. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Van 't Hoff equation direction. Let me recheck the sign.

The Van 't Hoff equation is ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). ΔH is negative, so the right side is negative. So ln(K2/K1) is negative
