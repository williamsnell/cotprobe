Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which operation to use. Let me read it again. The question is about a car's gasoline tank. The tank can hold 15 gallons when it's full. Right now, there are 7 gallons in it. The question is asking how many more gallons are needed to fill the tank. And then I have to choose the correct mathematical operation from the options given.

Hmm, let's break it down. The tank's total capacity is 15 gallons. Currently, it has 7 gallons. So, to find out how much more is needed, I think I need to subtract the current amount from the total capacity. Because if you subtract what's already there from the total, you'll get the remaining amount needed to fill it up.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. So, 15 gallons is the full tank. 7 gallons are present. So, the difference between these two numbers will tell me how much more gas is required. So yeah, subtraction makes sense here.

Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Addition would be if I had some gas and wanted to add more to reach a certain point, but in this case, I don't think that's right. Multiplication would be for scaling quantities, like if I had a certain number of tanks to fill, but that's not the case here. Division also doesn't seem right because we're not splitting anything into parts. Square roots, factorials, Pythagoras theoremâ€”these all seem too complicated for such a straightforward problem. Exponential calculations and percentages are probably not needed here either. Estimation might be a method, but the question is about which operation is most appropriate, so subtraction is the direct approach.

So putting it all together, the correct operation is subtraction. Looking at the options, that's option I: Subtraction.

The correct operation to determine how many gallons are needed to fill the tank is subtraction.
