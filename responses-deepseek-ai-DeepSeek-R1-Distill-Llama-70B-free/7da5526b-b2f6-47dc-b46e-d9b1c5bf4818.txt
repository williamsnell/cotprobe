Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find how many integers from -200 to 200 inclusive are congruent to 5 mod 13. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when we say a number is congruent to 5 mod 13, it means when you divide that number by 13, the remainder is 5. But wait, negative numbers can be a bit tricky here. Oh right, because negative numbers can have positive remainders when divided. So I should probably think about how negative numbers fit into modular arithmetic.

So the range is from -200 to 200. Let's see, how many integers is that? Well, from -200 to 200 inclusive, that's 200 negative numbers, 200 positive, and zero. Wait no, from -200 to 200, including both ends: so the total count is 200 - (-200) + 1 = 401 numbers. So that's 401 integers in total.

But I don't need the total, I need how many of these are ≡5 mod13.

I think the approach here is to find the smallest and largest numbers in the range that satisfy the congruence, and then find how many terms are in that arithmetic sequence.

So first, I need to find the first integer >= -200 that is ≡5 mod13. Similarly, find the last integer <=200 that is ≡5 mod13.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to find all numbers in the range that satisfy the condition. Let me think about how to approach this.

Another thought: the numbers congruent to 5 mod13 form an arithmetic sequence where each term is 13 apart. So the sequence is 5, 18, 31, ..., up to some maximum. But wait, negative numbers also have their own terms. So the sequence would also include numbers like -8 (since -8 +13 =5, so -8 ≡5 mod13?), wait no, wait: let me check.

Wait, let's compute -200 mod13. No, perhaps I should find the first number in the range that is ≡5 mod13.

Alternatively, think about the general solution to x ≡5 mod13. The numbers are x =13k +5, where k is an integer.

So I need to find all integers k such that x=13k+5 is between -200 and 200, inclusive.

So let's set up inequalities:

-200 ≤13k +5 ≤200

Subtract 5 from all parts:

-205 ≤13k ≤195

Now, divide each part by 13:

-205 /13 = approx -15.769. Since k must be an integer, the smallest k is -15 because -15.769 is less than -15, so k starts at -15.

Wait wait, wait. Let me compute this carefully.

Wait, -205 ÷13: Let me compute 13 × (-15) = -195. So -205 is less than -195. So 13k ≥ -205 → k ≥ -205/13 ≈ -15.769. So the smallest integer k is -15 because -15.769 is more negative than -15. So k can be -15, -14, ..., up to the maximum where 13k +5 ≤200.

Wait, let me compute the upper limit: 195 ÷13 =15 exactly. So 13k ≤195 → k ≤15. So k can be from -15 to 15 inclusive.

Wait, but wait: when k=15, x=13*15 +5=195+5=200. Oh, 200 is included, so that's correct.

So the values of k run from -15 to 15. How many integers is that?

From -15 to 15 inclusive, that's 15 negative, zero, and 15 positive. So 15 +1 +15=31 numbers.

Wait, but wait. Let me count: from -15 to +15, the count is (15 - (-15)) +1 = 31.

So there are 31 integers in this range that satisfy x ≡5 mod13.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me think of k=-15: x=13*(-15)+5= -195 +5 =-190. Is -190 >=-200? Yes, because -190 is greater than -200.

k=15: x=195+5=200, which is within the range.

So the number of valid k is from -15 to 15 inclusive. That's 31 numbers.

So looking at the options, D is 31.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Alternative approach: find the first number >=-200 that is ≡5 mod13, and the last number <=200, then compute how many terms in the arithmetic sequence.

First, find the smallest x >=-200 where x ≡5 mod13.

Let me compute -200 mod13. Hmm, 13*15=195, 200-195=5. So 200 is 5 mod13. Wait, 200 mod13: 13*15=195. 200-195=5. So 200 ≡5 mod13.

Wait, but -200 mod13: Hmm, since 200 ≡5 mod13, then -200 ≡ -5 mod13, which is the same as 8 mod13 because 13-5=8.

So -200 is 8 mod13. So we need to find the next number after -200 that is 5 mod13.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the first x >=-200 where x ≡5 mod13.

So x=13k +5. We need 13k +5 >=-200.

So 13k >=-205 → k >=-205/13 ≈-15.769. So k must be >=-15 because k is integer. So the first x is when k=-15: x=13*(-15)+5= -195+5=-190.

Wait, but -190 is greater than -200, right? So yes, that's within the range.

Then the last x is when k=15: x=13*15+5=195+5=200, which is within the range.

So the numbers are from k=-15 to k=15, which is 31 numbers.

Therefore, the answer should be 31, which is option D.

To determine how many integers from $-200$ to $200$ are congruent to $5 \pmod{13}$, we start by recognizing that numbers congruent to $5 \pmod{13}$ form an arithmetic sequence of the form $x = 13k + 5$, where $k$ is an integer. 

The goal is to find all integers $k$ such that $x = 13k + 5$ lies within the range $-200 \leq x \leq 200$. Substituting $x$ into the inequality:

\[
-200 \leq 13k + 5 \leq 200
\]

Subtracting 5 from all parts:

\[
-205 \leq 13k \leq 195
\]

Dividing through by 13:

\[
-\frac{205}{13} \leq k \leq \frac{195}{13}
\]

Calculating the bounds:

\[
-15.769 \leq k \leq 15
\]

Since $k$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value of $k$ is $-15$, and the largest is $15$. Thus, $k$ ranges from $-15$ to $15$, inclusive. The total number of integers in this range is:

\[
15 - (-15) + 1 = 31
\]

Therefore, there are 31 integers between $-200$ and $200$ that are congruent to $5 \pmod{13}$. The correct answer is:

**D: 31**
