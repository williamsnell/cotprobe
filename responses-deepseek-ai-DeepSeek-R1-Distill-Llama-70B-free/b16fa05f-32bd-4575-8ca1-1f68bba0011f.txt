Okay, so I've got this problem here about choosing balls from a box. Let's see, the box has 4 red balls, 3 green, and 2 blue. I'm supposed to find out in how many ways I can choose 4 balls, with the condition that at least 2 are red.

Hmm, so the total number of balls is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9. But I'm not choosing all of them, just 4. And at least 2 must be red. So, I think the way to approach this is to consider the different possible scenarios where I have exactly 2 red, exactly 3 red, or exactly 4 red balls in my selection. Then, calculate each case and add them up.

Wait, but let me think again. Since there are only 4 red balls in total, the maximum reds I can have is 4. So the cases are 2, 3, or 4 red balls.

Let me break it down:

Case 1: Exactly 2 red balls. Then I need to choose 2 out of the 4 red. The remaining 2 balls can be any of the non-red, which are 3 green and 2 blue, making 5 non-red. So the non-red selection would be 2 balls from these 5.

Case 2: Exactly 3 red balls. So choose 3 red out of 4. Then the remaining 1 ball comes from the 5 non-red.

Case 3: Exactly 4 red balls. Choose all 4 red, and then the remaining 0 balls from non-red, which is just 1 way.

Wait, but wait a minute. There's a problem here. Because for case 3, if I choose 4 red balls, that's 4 balls total, so I don't need any more. So the non-red part would be 0. But I'm choosing exactly 4 red and 0 non-red. So the calculation for each case would be the product of the combinations for red and non-red.

So the formula for each case is C(red, k) * C(non-red, 4 -k), where k is the number of red balls (2,3,4).

Wait, no. Because the total balls chosen are 4. So for each case, the red count is k, and the non-red is 4 -k.

So for exactly 2 red: C(4,2) * C(5,2)
Exactly 3: C(4,3) * C(5,1)
Exactly 4: C(4,4) * C(5,0)

Let me calculate each part.

C(4,2) is 6. C(5,2) is 10. So 6*10=60.

C(4,3) is 4. C(5,1)=5. So 4*5=20.

C(4,4) is 1. C(5,0)=1. So 1*1=1.

Adding them up: 60 + 20 +1 =81. Wait, that can't be right because the total number of ways to choose 4 balls from 9 is C(9,4) = 126. So 81 is less than that, which makes sense because it's only the cases where at least 2 are red.

But wait, looking at the options given: the options are A:24, B:18, C:14, D:20, E:6, F:22, G:16, H:12, I:8, J:10.

Wait, none of the options match 81. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. Oh wait, the problem says the box has 4 red, 3 green, and 2 blue balls. So non-red is 3+2=5, which I had correct.

But maybe the approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of ways without any restriction and subtract the cases where red balls are less than 2.

So total ways to choose 4 balls is C(9,4) = 126.

Then subtract the cases where we have 0 red or 1 red.

Case 0 red: choose all 4 from the 5 non-red. So C(5,4)=5.

Case 1 red: C(4,1)*C(5,3). C(4,1)=4, C(5,3)=10. So 4*10=40.

So total invalid cases are 5 +40=45.

So valid cases (at least 2 red) would be 126 -45=81. Again, same result. But the options don't have 81.

Wait, but the options are up to 24. So I'm missing something here. Did I miscalculate the combinations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the balls are identical except for color. So maybe the problem is considering balls of the same color as indistinct. Wait, no, in combinations, when balls are identical except color, each color is a category. So for example, choosing 2 red, 1 green, 1 blue is a different case than 2 red, 0 green, 2 blue, etc.

Wait, but in the way I approached earlier, I treated the balls as distinct because I used combinations, but perhaps the problem treats the balls as identical within their colors, so perhaps it's a multinomial problem.

Wait, but the question is about the number of ways to choose the balls, considering their colors. So when you choose, say, 2 red, 1 green, and 1 blue, that's one way, but the balls are identical except for color, so each such selection is unique based on the counts of each color.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says "Balls are identical besides their colors." So perhaps each color is indistinct. So for example, any red ball is the same as another. So the number of ways to choose would be the number of color combinations that add up to 4, considering the constraints on the max per color.

Wait, that would be a different approach. Let me think.

If the balls are identical except for color, then the problem becomes selecting a certain number of red, green, and blue balls, such that their sum is 4, and the count of each color does not exceed their available numbers.

So, the total number of ways is the number of non-negative integer solutions to r + g + b =4, with r ≤4, g ≤3, b ≤2, and r≥2.

So, since r can be 2,3,4.

Let me list all possible (r,g,b) tuples where r is between 2 and 4, and g ≤3, b ≤2, and r+g+b=4.

For r=2:

Then g + b =2.

Possible g can be 0,1,2,3 (but since g +b=2 and b can't exceed 2, so:

g can be 0,1,2 (since 3 would require b=-1, which isn't possible).

Wait, but wait, for r=2, the possible g and b are such that g +b =2, and g<=3, b<=2.

So possible (g,b):

(0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Also (3, -1) but that's invalid.

So three possibilities.

For r=3:

Then g +b=1.

Possible (g,b):

(0,1), (1,0). Also (2,-1) invalid, etc.

So two possibilities.

For r=4:

Then g +b=0. So only (0,0).

So total possibilities: 3 (r=2) + 2 (r=3) +1 (r=4)=6.

So the number of ways is 6.

Wait, but the options have E:6. So the answer would be E:6.

But wait, earlier when I treated the balls as distinct, I got 81, but the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct approach here is to treat the balls as identical except for color, leading to 6 ways.

Wait, but the question says "choose 4 balls", so it's about combinations where order doesn't matter, and the balls are identical except for color. So each possible distribution of counts per color is a unique way.

So for example, 2 red, 1 green, 1 blue is one way.

So, in this approach, the number of ways is 6, which is option E.

But wait, let me recheck the possible (r,g,b) for each r.

r=2:

g can be 0: then b=2 → possible because b=2 is allowed (since there are 2 blue balls).

g=1: b=1 → allowed.

g=2: b=0 → allowed.

g=3: b=-1 → invalid.

So 3 ways.

r=3:

g can be 0: b=1 → allowed.

g=1: b=0 → allowed.

g=2: b=-1 → invalid.

So 2 ways.

r=4:

g=0, b=0 → allowed. Only 1 way.

Total: 3+2+1=6.

So the answer is 6, which is option E.

Wait, but let me think again. Because in this approach, the balls are treated as identical, so each color combination is unique. But the initial approach where I considered distinct balls gave a different result. So which approach is correct?

The problem says "Balls are identical besides their colors." So each color is a type, and the balls within a color are indistinct. So when selecting, the number of ways is the number of distributions of counts per color that satisfy the constraints.

So for example, if I pick r red, g green, and b blue, with r+g+b=4, then each such (r,g,b) is a unique way. So the number of such triplets is what we're counting.

So in this scenario, the answer is 6, which is option E.

But wait, let me think again because I might have made a mistake in considering the constraints.

Wait, for r=2, the possible g and b have to not exceed their maximums.

r=2:

g can be from 0 to 3, but since g + b=2, and b can't exceed 2.

So when g=3, b= -1 → invalid. So only g=0,1,2.

Similarly for other r's.

So total 6 ways, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the balls as distinct, so each selection is a combination, and the count is 81 as I initially thought, but since the options don't include 81, perhaps the intended approach is the other way.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me recalculate.

In the first approach, treating balls as distinct:

Case 1: 2 red, 2 non-red.

C(4,2) * C(5,2) =6 *10=60.

Case 2:3 red, 1 non-red.

C(4,3)*C(5,1)=4*5=20.

Case3:4 red, 0 non-red.

C(4,4)*C(5,0)=1.

Total:60+20+1=81.

But the options don't have 81, so perhaps the problem intended the other approach.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the problem's wording. Let me read the question again.

"A box contains 4 red, 3 green, and 2 blue balls. Balls are identical besides their colors. In how many ways can we choose 4 balls, if at least 2 are red?"

Wait, so the key here is that the balls are identical except for color, so the number of ways is the number of color distributions. So the answer would be 6, which is option E.

So the correct answer is E:6.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 balls from a box containing 4 red, 3 green, and 2 blue balls, with the condition that at least 2 of the chosen balls are red. The balls are identical except for their colors, so the number of ways corresponds to the number of valid color distributions that satisfy the constraints.

### Approach:
1. **Understand the constraints**: The box has 4 red, 3 green, and 2 blue balls. We need to choose 4 balls such that at least 2 are red. This means the number of red balls (r) can be 2, 3, or 4. For each value of r, the remaining balls (4 - r) can be a combination of green (g) and blue (b), subject to the limits of 3 green and 2 blue balls.

2. **List valid distributions**: For each possible value of r (2, 3, 4), determine the valid combinations of g and b such that:
   - \( r + g + b = 4 \)
   - \( g \leq 3 \), \( b \leq 2 \).

3. **Count the valid combinations**:
   - For \( r = 2 \): \( g + b = 2 \). Valid combinations are \((g, b) = (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0)\). This gives 3 ways.
   - For \( r = 3 \): \( g + b = 1 \). Valid combinations are \((g, b) = (0, 1), (1, 0)\). This gives 2 ways.
   - For \( r = 4 \): \( g + b = 0 \). The only valid combination is \((g, b) = (0, 0)\). This gives 1 way.

4. **Total number of ways**: Add the valid combinations for each case:
   \[
   3 \, (r = 2) + 2 \, (r = 3) + 1 \, (r = 4) = 6.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The number of ways to choose 4 balls with at least 2 red balls is 6. This corresponds to option **E**.
