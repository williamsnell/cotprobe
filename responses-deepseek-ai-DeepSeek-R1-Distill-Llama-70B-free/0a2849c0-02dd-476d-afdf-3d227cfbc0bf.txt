Okay, so I have this physics question here about light passing through different media. Let me think about what I remember from my classes. The question says that a beam of monochromatic light enters a glass window pane from the air. I need to figure out what changes: speed, wavelength, frequency, or direction.

Hmm, I remember that when light travels from one medium to another, like air to glass, its speed changes. Oh wait, because glass is denser than air, right? So the light should slow down. That makes sense because in a denser medium, the speed of light decreases. 

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to recall the properties. I think the frequency of the light doesn't change when it enters a different medium. Oh yeah, the frequency is related to the source of the light and remains constant when moving between media. So frequency stays the same.

So if the speed changes and the frequency doesn't, what about the wavelength? I remember that the speed of light in a medium is the product of the wavelength and the frequency (v = λf). Since the speed decreases and frequency is the same, the wavelength must decrease. Because if v goes down and f stays the same, λ must be v/f which is smaller.

So putting this together: when light enters glass from air, the speed decreases, the wavelength decreases, but the frequency remains the same. 

Looking at the options, I think option A is speed and wavelength. Wait, let's check the options again. Option A is speed and wavelength. Option B is speed, frequency, and wavelength. No, because frequency doesn't change. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but another thought—does direction change? No, wait, the question doesn't mention anything about the angle of incidence or refraction. Oh right, because it's a window pane, which I guess is parallel on both sides, so the light doesn't bend much. Or wait, actually, when light enters glass, it does bend towards the normal, so the direction changes. But wait, the question is about when it enters, so does the direction change as part of the process? Hmm, but the options don't all include direction. Let me look at the options again.

Looking back, option F says speed, wavelength, and direction. Option A says speed and wavelength. So if direction is part of the change, then F would be the answer. But the question is about the change in properties of the light beam itself. Direction is a change in the path, but the beam's properties like speed, wavelength, frequency.

Wait, but the question is phrased as the beam experiencing a change in something. So when the light enters the glass, it refracts, which changes its direction. But does direction count as a property that changes? Or is it considered a separate aspect.

Alternatively, maybe the question isn't considering direction because it's a flat window, so the beam continues in the same direction but slower and with shorter wavelength. Wait, no, even a flat pane would cause the light to bend a little. But perhaps the question is more about the intrinsic properties rather than the beam's path. So the physical properties (speed, wavelength) change, but the direction is about the path, which might not be part of the answer unless the option includes it.

Looking back at the options: option A is speed and wavelength. Option F includes direction. So which is correct?

Wait, the question says, "experiences a change in". So the beam's properties, so speed and wavelength change. Direction is about the path, which is the beam's direction, but whether the question counts it. I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, maybe the answer doesn't include direction because the beam's direction might not be considered a property of the light itself but rather its path. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the beam is moving straight through without bending, but that's not realistic since light refracts upon entering glass. So the direction does change. Hmm.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether it's perpendicular or at an angle. If it's entering perpendicular, then the direction doesn't change. So maybe the problem assumes it's entering perpendicular. That would mean direction doesn't change, so only speed and wavelength change.

But in reality, even at perpendicular incidence, the direction doesn't change. So in that case, the only changes are speed and wavelength. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I remember that when light enters a medium, the speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains same. So the correct answer is A: speed and wavelength.

Looking at the options again: option A is speed and wavelength. So that's the correct choice.

When monochromatic light enters a glass window pane from air, several properties of the light beam are affected. Specifically:

1. **Speed**: The speed of light decreases as it moves from air into glass, which is a denser medium.
2. **Wavelength**: The wavelength of the light also decreases because the speed is reduced, and the frequency remains constant. This relationship is described by the equation \( v = \lambda f \), where \( v \) is speed, \( \lambda \) is wavelength, and \( f \) is frequency.
3. **Frequency**: The frequency of the light remains unchanged, as it is determined by the source and does not depend on the medium through which the light travels.
4. **Direction**: While the direction of the light beam may change due to refraction, the question focuses on the intrinsic properties of the light beam itself, not its path. Therefore, direction is not considered in this context.

Given these considerations, the correct answer is that the light beam experiences a change in **speed and wavelength**.
