Okay, so I've got this problem about a tank with water and salt, and I'm supposed to find out how much salt is left after some time. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The tank starts with 100 gallons of fresh water, which I assume means no salt initially. Then, for the first 10 minutes, they're pouring in saltwater. The saltwater has half a pound of salt per gallon, and the rate is 2 gallons per minute. So, every minute, 2 gal of this salty water is added. But the mixture is leaving at the same rate, so the volume in the tank stays constant at 100 gallons, right?

Wait, so the first part is from t=0 to t=10 minutes. Then, after that, they stop and start adding fresh water for another 10 minutes, with the same inflow and outflow rates. I need to find the amount of salt after this additional 10 minutes.

Alright, let's tackle the first 10 minutes. So, during this time, salt is being added to the tank. The concentration of salt in the inflow is 0.5 lb/gal. The inflow rate is 2 gal/min, so the rate of salt entering the tank is 0.5 * 2 = 1 lb per minute.

But wait, the solution is also leaving the tank at the same rate. So, the concentration in the tank is changing over time, which affects how much salt is leaving. This sounds like a classic mixing problem, probably requiring a differential equation.

The general approach for these problems is to model the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time. Let me denote S(t) as the amount of salt in the tank at time t.

The rate of change of S(t) is the rate in minus the rate out. The rate in is 1 lb/min, as I calculated. The rate out depends on the concentration of the solution in the tank. The concentration is S(t) divided by the volume, which is constant at 100 gallons. So the rate out is (S(t)/100) * 2 gal/min, which is (2 S(t))/100 = S(t)/50 lb per minute.

So the differential equation is dS/dt = (rate in) - (rate out) = 1 - (S/50).

That's a first-order linear differential equation. The standard solution method would involve finding an integrating factor. Let me write it in standard form:

dS/dt + (1/50) S = 1.

The integrating factor is e^(∫(1/50)dt) = e^(t/50). Multiplying both sides by this factor:

e^(t/50) dS/dt + (1/50) e^(t/50) S = e^(t/50).

The left side is the derivative of [S * e^(t/50)] with respect to t. So:

d/dt [S e^(t/50)] = e^(t/50).

Integrate both sides from t=0 to t=10.

The integral of e^(t/50) dt is 50 e^(t/50) + C. So:

S e^(t/50) evaluated from 0 to 10 equals 50 e^(t/50) evaluated from 0 to 10.

So at t=10:

S(10) e^(10/50) - S(0) e^(0) = 50 [e^(10/50) - e^0].

But S(0) is 0, since the tank starts with fresh water. So:

S(10) e^(0.2) = 50 (e^0.2 - 1).

Wait, wait, 10/50 is 0.2, right? So:

S(10) = 50 (e^0.2 - 1) / e^0.2.

Simplify that:

S(10) = 50 [ (e^0.2 - 1) / e^0.2 ] = 50 [1 - e^(-0.2)].

Hmm, let me calculate that. Let me compute e^0.2 first. e^0.2 is approximately 1.2214. So e^-0.2 is 1/1.2214 ≈ 0.8187.

So 1 - 0.8187 is 0.1813. Multiply by 50: 50 * 0.1813 = around 9.065 lbs. So after 10 minutes, the tank has approximately 9.065 lbs of salt.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Because the inflow is 2 gal per min, salt concentration is 0.5 lb/gal, so yes, 1 lb per minute in. The outflow is 2 gal/min, but the concentration is S(t)/100 lb/gal, so 2*(S/100) = S/50 lb/min out. So the equation seems correct.

Now, after the first 10 minutes, the process stops, and then they pour in fresh water for the next 10 minutes. So from t=10 to t=20, the inflow is fresh water, which has 0 salt. So the rate in is 0 lb/min, and the rate out is again (S(t)/100) * 2 gal/min = S/50 lb/min.

So the differential equation for this second phase (t from 10 to 20) is dS/dt = 0 - (S/50) = -S/50.

This is a simpler equation. The solution is S(t) = S(10) e^(-t/50). But wait, that's from t=10 onwards, so let me adjust the time variable. Let τ = t -10, so τ goes from 0 to 10.

Then, dS/dτ = -S/50.

The solution is S(τ) = S(10) e^(-τ/50).

So at τ=10, which is t=20, S(20) = S(10) e^(-10/50) = S(10) e^(-0.2).

We already have S(10) ≈ 9.065 lbs. So:

S(20) = 9.065 * e^(-0.2) ≈ 9.065 * 0.8187 ≈ let's compute that.

9 * 0.8187 is about 7.3683, and 0.065 * 0.8187 is about 0.0532. So total is approximately 7.3683 + 0.0532 = 7.4215 lbs. Hmm, that's about 7.42 lbs.

Looking at the options, option B is 7.42 lb. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the numbers again.

First phase: 0 to 10 minutes.

Solution to dS/dt = 1 - S/50.

Integrate from 0 to 10.

S(t) = 50 (1 - e^(-t/50)) evaluated at t=10.

So S(10) =50 (1 - e^(-0.2)).

e^(-0.2)=0.8187.

So 1-0.8187=0.1813. 50 * 0.1813=9.065.

Yes.

Second phase: t=10 to 20.

S(t) = S(10) e^(-(t-10)/50).

At t=20, t-10=10, so exponent is -10/50=-0.2.

So S(20)=9.065 * e^(-0.2)=9.065 *0.8187≈7.42 lb.

Yes, that's correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the tank's salt content in two phases:

### Phase 1: Saltwater inflow (0 to 10 minutes)
- The tank initially contains 100 gallons of fresh water (no salt).
- Saltwater is added at a rate of 2 gal/min, with a salt concentration of \( \frac{1}{2} \, \text{lb/gal} \), so the rate of salt entering the tank is \( 1 \, \text{lb/min} \).
- The mixture leaves the tank at the same rate (2 gal/min), so the volume remains constant at 100 gallons.
- The rate of salt leaving the tank depends on the concentration of salt in the tank, given by \( \frac{S(t)}{100} \, \text{lb/gal} \), where \( S(t) \) is the amount of salt in the tank at time \( t \). Thus, the rate out is \( \frac{S(t)}{50} \, \text{lb/min} \).
- The differential equation for \( S(t) \) is:
  \[
  \frac{dS}{dt} = 1 - \frac{S}{50}.
  \]
- This is a first-order linear differential equation. Solving it with the integrating factor \( e^{t/50} \), we find:
  \[
  S(t) = 50 \left( 1 - e^{-t/50} \right).
  \]
- At \( t = 10 \), the amount of salt in the tank is:
  \[
  S(10) = 50 \left( 1 - e^{-0.2} \right).
  \]
  Using \( e^{-0.2} \approx 0.8187 \), we get:
  \[
  S(10) = 50 \left( 1 - 0.8187 \right) = 50 \cdot 0.1813 \approx 9.065 \, \text{lb}.
  \]

### Phase 2: Freshwater inflow (10 to 20 minutes)
- From \( t = 10 \) to \( t = 20 \), fresh water is added at 2 gal/min, so no salt enters the tank (\( \text{rate in} = 0 \)).
- The mixture leaves the tank at the same rate (2 gal/min), so the rate of salt leaving is \( \frac{S(t)}{50} \, \text{lb/min} \).
- The differential equation for \( S(t) \) is:
  \[
  \frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{S}{50}.
  \]
- Solving this equation with \( S(10) = 9.065 \, \text{lb} \) as the initial condition, we find:
  \[
  S(t) = S(10) e^{-t/50}.
  \]
- At \( t = 20 \), the amount of salt in the tank is:
  \[
  S(20) = 9.065 \cdot e^{-0.2}.
  \]
  Using \( e^{-0.2} \approx 0.8187 \), we get:
  \[
  S(20) = 9.065 \cdot 0.8187 \approx 7.42 \, \text{lb}.
  \]

### Final Answer
The amount of salt in the tank at the end of the additional 10 minutes is approximately **7.42 lb**.
