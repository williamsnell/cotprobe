Okay, I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this psychology ethics question. Let me read through it again.

So, Mrs. Wang's daughter is 14 and witnessed her best friend being assaulted three days ago. She's really upset—hasn't slept, won't eat, can't stop crying. The person getting the call is a psychologist with limited experience working with adolescents and in crisis intervention. But there's no one else in the community with more experience. The question is, what should the psychologist do ethically?

The options are from A to H. Let me go through each one.

Option A: See the daughter in therapy only until the crisis ends or until alternative services are found. That sounds reasonable because it's a temporary solution while looking for better help. But is it ethical to stop once the crisis is over? Maybe, but if they can't find alternative services, what then?

Option B: Offer to train Mrs. Wang in crisis intervention. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. The psychologist isn't experienced enough themselves, so training someone else might not be effective or ethical. It could put the responsibility on the parent, who might not be equipped.

Option C: Suggest waiting a few days before therapy. That's probably not a good idea because the girl is in acute distress. Delaying help could make things worse.

Option D: Agree to see her without disclosing lack of experience. That's unethical because informed consent is crucial. The client has the right to know about the therapist's experience level.

Option E: Refuse to see her because of lack of experience. This might seem ethical but could be abandoning someone in need. If there's no one else, refusing might not be the best choice.

Option F: Suggest trying to forget the incident. That's not helpful and could be harmful. People shouldn't be told to forget traumatic events; they need to process them.

Option G: Recommend group therapy with other adolescents. Maybe, but if the psychologist isn't experienced in crisis intervention, leading a group might not be appropriate. Also, the girl might need individual attention first.

Option H: Agree to see her because of some crisis intervention experience. Wait, the question says the psychologist has limited experience but not none. So if they have some, maybe it's okay. But is it ethical to take on a case beyond one's competence without informing?

Wait, the question says "you have limited experience... no one else more experienced." So the psychologist has to decide whether to help or not. Ethical principles here involve beneficence (do good), non-maleficence (do no harm), and possibly informed consent.

Option A seems like a good middle ground. They provide temporary help while seeking better resources. It doesn't involve deception or refusing help. So the psychologist would be doing their best within their capabilities and seeking alternatives.

Option H says agree to see her because of some experience. But if their experience is limited, maybe they should be cautious. Option A is better because it's a temporary measure, acknowledging that they might not be the best fit long-term.

So the ethical choice would be to offer help until the crisis passes or until a better option is found. That's option A.

The psychologist faces an ethical dilemma where a young girl is in acute distress following a traumatic event. The psychologist has limited experience with adolescents and crisis intervention, but no more experienced professional is available. Ethical principles guide the decision: beneficence (providing help), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and informed consent.

- **Option A** is appropriate as it offers temporary support while seeking alternative services, acknowledging the psychologist's limitations without abandoning the client.
- **Option H** involves agreeing to therapy based on some experience but may overlook the need for informed consent about the psychologist's limited expertise.

Thus, the most ethical choice is to provide temporary assistance while exploring better options.
