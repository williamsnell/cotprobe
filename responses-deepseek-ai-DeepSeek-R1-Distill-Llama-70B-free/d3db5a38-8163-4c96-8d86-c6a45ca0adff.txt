Okay, so I've got this problem about a capacitor where I need to find the voltage across it as a function of time. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about capacitors and their voltage-current relationships.

Wait, I remember that the current in a capacitor is related to the voltage by the equation i_C(t) = C * d(u_C(t))/dt. Oh right, because current is the rate of change of charge, and Q = C*V, so differentiating that gives i = C*dv/dt.

So the given current here is i_C(t) = cos(10^6 t). And the initial voltage u_C(0) is 1 volt. The capacitance is 10^-6 farads.

I think I need to find the voltage as a function of time, u_C(t). So since i = C dv/dt, I can rearrange that to find dv/dt = i_C(t)/C.

Let me plug in the values. dv/dt = cos(1e6 t) / (1e-6). Wait, 1e-6 is a small number, so dividing by it would make the value large. So 1 / 1e-6 is 1e6. So dv/dt = 1e6 * cos(1e6 t).

To find v(t), I need to integrate dv/dt with respect to time. So integrating 1e6 cos(1e6 t) dt.

The integral of cos(ax) is (1/a) sin(ax), right? So integrating 1e6 cos(1e6 t) would give 1e6 * (1/(1e6)) sin(1e6 t) + constant. Oh wait, because the integral of cos(ax) is (1/a) sin(ax). So the 1e6 and 1e6 would cancel, leaving sin(1e6 t) as part of the solution.

So v(t) = sin(1e6 t) + constant. Now, I need to apply the initial condition to find the constant.

At t=0, v(0) = 1 V. So plugging t=0 into the equation: 1 = sin(0) + constant. Sin(0) is 0, so the constant is 1.

So the voltage as a function of time is u_C(t) = 1 + sin(1e6 t).

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, wait a second. Did I get the integration correct? Because the integral of dv/dt is v(t). So dv/dt is 1e6 cos(1e6 t), so integrating that gives:

v(t) = ∫ 1e6 cos(1e6 t) dt.

Let me make substitution: let u = 1e6 t, so du = 1e6 dt. Then dt = du/(1e6). So substituting:

∫ 1e6 cos(u) * (du / 1e6) ) = ∫ cos(u) du = sin(u) + C.

So substituting back, that's sin(1e6 t) + C. So yes, that part is correct.

So v(t) = sin(1e6 t) + C. Applying initial condition t=0: 1 = sin(0) + C => C=1.

So the voltage is u_C(t) = 1 + sin(1e6 t). Now looking at the options, the correct one should have 1 plus sin(1e6 t).

Looking at the options:

Option B: 1 + sin(1e6 t). Option G is sin(...) -1, which doesn't fit. Option H is 1 - sin(...), no. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Because sometimes I mix up the integral when dealing with signs.

Wait, no, the integral of cos is sin, and the positive sign is correct. So option B is the one.

To solve for the voltage across the capacitor, we start with the fundamental relationship between current and voltage for a capacitor:

\[
i_C(t) = C \frac{d}{dt} u_C(t)
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} u_C(t) = \frac{i_C(t)}{C}
\]

The given current is \( i_C(t) = \cos(10^6 t) \), and the capacitance is \( C = 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} u_C(t) = \frac{\cos(10^6 t)}{10^{-6}} = 10^6 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

To find \( u_C(t) \), we integrate:

\[
u_C(t) = \int 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) \, dt
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 10^6 t \), \( du = 10^6 dt \), the integral becomes:

\[
u_C(t) = \int \cos(u) \, du = \sin(u) + C = \sin(10^6 t) + C
\]

Applying the initial condition \( u_C(0) = 1 \, \text{V} \):

\[
1 = \sin(0) + C \implies C = 1
\]

Thus, the voltage across the capacitor is:

\[
u_C(t) = 1 + \sin(10^6 t)
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**B: \( 1 + \sin(10^6 t) \)**

Answer: B
