Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bicycle's price being marked down, and I need to find the new price after the discount. Let me think through this step by step. 

The original price is $138.00, and it's discounted by 15%. Hmm, I remember that discounts work by subtracting a percentage of the original price. So first, I should probably calculate 15% of $138 and then subtract that from the original price to get the new price.

Wait, right, percentage calculations. To find a percentage of a number, you multiply that percentage (in decimal form) by the number. So 15% as a decimal is 0.15. So 0.15 times 138 should give me the discount amount.

Let me do the multiplication. 138 * 0.15. Let me break this down. 100 * 0.15 is 15, 30 * 0.15 is 4.5, 8 * 0.15 is 1.2. Wait, wait, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, 138 times 0.15. Let's see, 138 * 0.1 is 13.8, and 138 * 0.05 is 6.9. Adding those together, 13.8 + 6.9 equals 20.7. So the discount is $20.70.

Now, subtract that from the original price. $138.00 minus $20.70. Let's subtract: 138 minus 20 is 118, and then minus 0.70 more would be 117.30. So the new price should be $117.30.

Looking at the options, option G is $117.30, so that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Yes, 15% of 138 is 20.7, subtracting that from 138 gives 117.3. Yep, that's correct. So the new price is $117.30, which is option G.

To determine the new price of the bicycle after a 15% discount, first calculate 15% of the original price ($138.00). 

15% as a decimal is 0.15, so:
\[
138 \times 0.15 = 20.70
\]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[
138 - 20.70 = 117.30
\]

Thus, the new price of the bicycle is **$117.30**, which corresponds to option **G**.
