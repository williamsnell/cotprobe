Question:

How do motor or enactive codes differ from visual or verbal codes. Illustrate with examples.

Options:

A: Enactive codes store motor activity and can be utilized without active, conscious attention, unlike visual and verbal codes.
B: Visual codes are less detailed and less precise than enactive codes
C: Enactive and verbal codes are stored in the same way in the brain
D: Enactive codes require active, conscious attention
E: Enactive codes and visual codes are the same
F: Enactive codes are a type of verbal code used for complex problem-solving
G: Enactive codes are visual representations
H: Visual codes can be recalled without having ever been performed
I: Enactive codes are always accompanied by verbal explanations
J: Verbal codes are not based on language but on motor skills

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me about memory codes, specifically how motor or enactive codes differ from visual or verbal ones. I remember that when studying memory, there are different ways we encode information, like visual, verbal, and enactive. 

Let me think. Enactive codes are related to actions, right? Like when you remember how to ride a bike, you don't just think about it verbally or see it visually; you actually perform the actions. So maybe enactive codes are about the motor skills, the physical movements we do.

On the other hand, visual codes would be images, like picturing a sunset or a cat. Verbal codes are about language, like remembering words or sentences. So the key difference is that enactive is about doing, while visual and verbal are about seeing and language.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly states this difference. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says enactive codes store motor activity and can be used without conscious attention. That sounds right because once you learn how to ride a bike, you don't have to consciously think about each movement every time. So A could be a contender.

Option B claims visual codes are less detailed than enactive. I'm not sure about that. Visual can be very detailed, like remembering a face. So B might not be correct.

Option C says enactive and verbal are stored the same. No, I think they're stored differently since they involve different parts of the brain. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says enactive codes require active attention. That doesn't fit because, as I thought, once you've learned the motor skill, it's automatic. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E says enactive and visual are the same. No, they're different. E is wrong.

Option F says enactive is a type of verbal code. No, that's mixing things up. F is wrong.

Option G claims enactive codes are visual. No, they're about movement, not images. G is incorrect.

Option H says visual codes can be recalled without having been performed. That makes sense because you can visualize something you've never done. So H is true, but the question is about how enactive differs. Wait, the question is asking how enactive codes differ, so H is correct but is it the best answer? Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question is about how enactive differ from visual/verbal. So the correct answer should explain what enactive codes are and how they're different.

Looking back at A, it mentions motor activity and use without conscious attention. That's a key point about enactive codes. So A seems correct.

Option H is about visual codes being recalled without performance. While true, the question is about enactive's difference. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is **A**. Enactive codes differ from visual and verbal codes because they involve motor activities and can be utilized without active, conscious attention. For example, riding a bike is an enactive code, requiring physical movements that become automatic over time, unlike visual codes (like picturing a sunset) or verbal codes (like remembering words).

Answer: A
