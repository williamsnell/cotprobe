Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the change in Gibbs energy for ethanol when the pressure increases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but let me think through this.

Alright, the problem says we have 35 grams of ethanol. The density is given as 0.789 g/cm³. The pressure increases isothermally from 1 atm to 3000 atm. I remember that Gibbs energy change is related to pressure changes, especially when it's isothermal. Oh right, the formula for Gibbs free energy change when pressure changes is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), assuming it's an ideal gas. But wait, ethanol isn't a gas under normal conditions, right? It's a liquid. So maybe I should treat it as a liquid.

Wait, for solids and liquids, the change in Gibbs energy with pressure is different. I think the formula is ΔG = VΔP, where V is the molar volume. Because for liquids, the volume doesn't change much with pressure, so it's approximately constant. Oh, right, because the equation for Gibbs energy when pressure changes is ∫V dP from P1 to P2. If V is constant, then it's V*(P2 - P1).

So first, I need to find the molar volume of ethanol. Let's see, ethanol's molar mass is C2H5OH. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, hydrogen is 1, oxygen 16. So 2*(12) + 6*(1) + 16 + 1 = 24 +6 +17= 46.07 g/mol, right?

Wait, wait, let me recount. Ethanol is C2H5OH, which is C2H6O, so:

Carbon: 2 * 12 =24
Hydrogen:6 *1=6
Oxygen:16 *1=16
Total: 24+6+16=46 g/mol. Yes.

So molar mass is 46 g/mol. The mass given is 35 grams. So number of moles n = mass/molar mass = 35 / 46 ≈ 0.7609 moles.

Now, the volume of ethanol is mass divided by density. Mass is 35 g, density is 0.789 g/cm³. So volume V = 35 / 0.789 ≈ let's calculate that. 35 divided by 0.789. Let me compute 35 / 0.789. Hmm, 0.789 * 44 is about 34.7, so 35 is roughly 44.3 cm³ or 44.3 mL. So the volume is approximately 44.3 cm³.

But wait, the molar volume would be volume per mole. Oh wait, no. Wait, the Gibbs energy equation for this case uses the molar volume. So the total volume is 44.3 cm³ for 0.7609 moles. So molar volume Vm is (44.3 cm³) / (0.7609 mol). Let me compute that.

44.3 / 0.7609 ≈ let's see, 0.76 * 58 is around 44, so 44.3 / 0.7609 ≈ 58.2 cm³/mol. Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1 mole is 46 grams. So 46 grams divided by 0.789 g/cm³ is 46 / 0.789 ≈ 58.3 cm³ per mole. Oh, I see! Oh wait, because 35g is less than a mole, so when I compute V=35/0.789, that's the volume for 35g, which is n moles. So the molar volume is (35/0.789) / (35/46) ) = (46/0.789) cm³/mol. Which is 58.3 cm³/mol. So yes, about 58.3 cm³/mol.

Now, the change in pressure is from 1 atm to 3000 atm. So ΔP is 3000 -1 = 2999 atm. But I think I should use P2-P1 as 2999 atm.

Wait, but when I use the formula ΔG = n Vm ΔP, the units need to be consistent. Because normally, pressure is in Pa or something, but here it's in atm. Oh wait, but if Vm is in cm³/mol, and pressure is in atm, perhaps we can convert everything into compatible units.

Wait, the gas constant R is usually in units of L·atm/(mol·K), right? But in this case, since we're using the formula for liquids, which is ΔG = VΔP, where V is the molar volume and ΔP is pressure change. But wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the correct formula for Gibbs energy change when pressure changes is ΔG = V (P2 - P1), yes, but V is the molar volume. So if V is in cm³/mol, and pressure is in atm, then the units would be cm³·atm/mol. But R is known in L·atm/(mol·K), so perhaps I should convert cm³ to liters.

So 1 L is 1000 cm³. So 58.3 cm³ is 0.0583 L.

So now, n is 0.7609 moles, Vm is 0.0583 L/mol, ΔP is 2999 atm.

So ΔG = n * Vm * (P2 - P1) = 0.7609 * 0.0583 * 2999.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.7609 * 0.0583 = let's see, 0.76 * 0.058 is approximately 0.044. Then multiply by 2999.

0.044 * 3000 is 132, but since it's 2999, maybe 132 - 0.044 = approx 131.956.

So ΔG is about 132 L·atm.

But wait, we need to convert this into kJ because the options are in kJ.

I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J. So 132 L·atm * 101.325 J/(L·atm) = ?

Calculating 132 * 101.325.

Let me compute 100 * 101.325 = 10132.5 J.

32 * 101.325: 30*101.325 = 3039.75, 2*101.325=202.65 → 3039.75 + 202.65 = 3242.4 J.

So total is 10132.5 + 3242.4 = 13374.9 J, which is approximately 13,375 J or 13.375 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 12 kJ, J is 10, G is 8, etc. Hmm, but I got about 13.4 kJ, which isn't exactly in the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up the molar volume.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Molar mass of ethanol is 46.07 g/mol. So 35g is 35 / 46.07 ≈ 0.7595 moles.

Density is 0.789 g/cm³, so 35g has volume 35 / 0.789 ≈ 44.303 cm³. So molar volume Vm is 44.303 cm³ / 0.7595 mol ≈ let's compute that.

44.303 / 0.7595 ≈ let's see, 0.7595 * 58 = approx 44.0 (since 0.7595 * 60 =45.57). Hmm, 0.7595 *58 = 44.0? Let me compute 58*0.7595.

58 * 0.7 =40.6, 58 * 0.0595= approx 3.451. So total 40.6 +3.451=44.051. So that's correct. So Vm is 58.0 cm³/mol.

Wait, 44.303 / 0.7595 = let's compute more accurately.

44.303 ÷ 0.7595:

0.7595 * 58 = 44.051. So 44.303 -44.051= 0.252 left. So 0.252 / 0.7595 ≈ 0.332. So Vm ≈ 58.332 cm³/mol.

Convert that to liters: 58.332 cm³ = 0.058332 L.

So now, n=0.7595, Vm=0.058332 L, ΔP=2999 atm.

ΔG = n * Vm * ΔP.

So 0.7595 * 0.058332 = let's compute that:

0.75 *0.0583 = 0.043725. 0.0095 *0.0583≈ 0.000554. So total ≈ 0.044279.

Multiply by 2999 atm:

0.044279 * 2999 ≈ Let's compute 0.044279 * 3000 = 132.837. Then subtract 0.044279 *1 = 0.044279 → 132.837 - 0.044279 = 132.7927.

So ΔG ≈ 132.7927 L·atm.

Convert to J: 132.7927 * 101.325 ≈ let's compute.

132 * 100 = 13200, 132 *1.325≈ 174.9 → 13200 + 174.9=13374.9 J.

0.7927 *101.325 ≈ approx 80.26 J.

So total ≈13374.9 +80.26=13455.16 J → 13.455 kJ.

Hmm, but the options don't have 13.4 kJ. The closest is E:12, J:10, but wait, maybe I did something wrong in the formula.

Wait, wait, wait! The formula I used was ΔG = VΔP. But isn't the correct formula for Gibbs energy at constant temperature ΔG = n V_m (P2 - P1)? Or is it the other way around?

Wait another thing: ethanol is a liquid, so its volume is almost constant, but also, the change in Gibbs energy for a liquid under pressure change is given by ΔG = V (P2 - P1). But wait, another formula I remember is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) for gases, but for liquids, it's different because they're not compressible.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is ΔG = V T ΔP / (1 + (ΔP/β)), but that's when considering compressibility, which is probably negligible here. Alternatively, the approximate formula is ΔG ≈ V ΔP, assuming the volume doesn't change much.

Alternatively, I think I might have messed up the formula. Let me think: the differential of Gibbs free energy is dG = V dP - S dT. At constant temperature, dT=0, so dG = V dP. So the change in G is the integral from P1 to P2 of V dP. If V is constant, then ΔG = V (P2 - P1).

But wait, I think I might have mixed up molar Gibbs energy and total Gibbs energy. Oh! I think I forgot that V in the equation is the molar volume, so ΔG per mole is V_m (P2 - P1). So for n moles, it's n V_m (P2 - P1).

Wait, so then the calculation I did is correct. So the result is approximately 13.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:25, B:18, C:20, D:15, E:12, F:5, G:8, H:30, I:22, J:10.

Hmm, none of these is near 13.4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we should use the ideal gas law? But ethanol is a liquid, so that's not applicable. Unless the problem is considering ethanol as a gas, but that's not correct because at 1 atm, ethanol is a liquid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps the problem is about the change in Gibbs energy when the pressure is applied, which could relate to the work done. Alternatively, maybe I should use the equation for the change in Gibbs energy for a solid or liquid, which is ΔG = VΔP, where V is the molar volume, but in that case, perhaps I should have used the molar volume at the initial pressure. Oh wait, that's what I did.

Wait, another possibility is that the given options are in terms of kJ per mole, but no, the question says for 35g of ethanol.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong sign. Because when pressure increases, for a liquid, the Gibbs energy increases, so ΔG is positive, which I have, but the options don't have 13.4, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in unit conversion. Let me check the calculation again.

So, L·atm to J: 1 L·atm = 101.325 J.

So 132.7927 L·atm * 101.325 J/(L·atm)= 132.7927 * 101.325.

Let me compute this precisely:

132 * 100 = 13200.

132 * 1.325 = ?

1.325 *132:

1 *132=132.

0.325 *132: 0.3 *132=39.6, 0.025*132=3.3 → 39.6 +3.3=42.9.

So 1.325 *132=132 +42.9=174.9.

So 132 *101.325=13200 +174.9=13374.9 J.

Then the 0.7927 part: 0.7927 *101.325.

0.7 *101.325=70.9275.

0.0927 *101.325≈ let's compute 0.09 *101.325≈9.119, 0.0027 *101.325≈0.273. So total 9.119 +0.273=9.392.

So 0.7927 *101.325≈70.9275 +9.392≈80.32 J.

So total is 13374.9 +80.32=13455.22 J, which is 13.455 kJ.

Hmm, but the options don't have 13.4. So maybe the approach is wrong.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the pressure change is so large that the approximation ΔG = VΔP is not valid because ethanol's volume does change a bit. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the ideal gas law, but that would be incorrect for a liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers ethanol as a gas. Let me try that approach, just to see. Maybe the question is a trick.

If ethanol were a gas, then we'd use ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). Let's compute that.

n = 35g /46.07 g/mol ≈0.7595 moles.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Temperature isn't given, but since it's isothermal, but without T, perhaps it's 25°C (298 K). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify temperature, so maybe that's a problem.

Wait, the question doesn't give temperature. Oh wait, the problem states that it's isothermal but doesn't give T. Hmm, that's a problem because without T, we can't compute ΔG for a gas.

So maybe using the gas approach isn't possible. So I think my initial approach was correct, treating ethanol as a liquid.

But the answer I got isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molar volume calculation.

Wait, let me compute the molar volume again. The molar mass is 46.07 g/mol. The density is 0.789 g/cm³, so the volume per mole is 46.07 g / 0.789 g/cm³ = ?

46.07 / 0.789 = let's compute that. 0.789 *58 = approx 45.8, as earlier. So 46.07 /0.789 ≈58.35 cm³/mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the problem is that 35g is 0.7595 moles, so the volume is 35g /0.789 g/cm³ =44.303 cm³.

So for n=0.7595 moles, V=44.303 cm³.

So Vm=44.303 / 0.7595 ≈58.35 cm³/mol, as before.

So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Another formula for Gibbs energy at constant T is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but that's for gases. Alternatively, for solids and liquids, ΔG ≈ V (P2 - P1), which is what I used.

So I think my calculation of ~13.4 kJ is correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure difference.

Wait, the problem says pressure increases from 1 atm to 3000 atm, so ΔP is 2999 atm. But perhaps I should use P2/P1 in the gas formula, but that would require T, which isn't given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the bulk modulus. Wait, another approach is using the equation for solids and liquids where ΔG = -nRT ln(1 + β ΔP), but I don't know the bulk modulus for ethanol. So that's probably not the way.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given options are in kJ per mole, but the question is for 35g. Let's see, 35g is about 0.76 moles. So if the ΔG per mole is around 17.6 kJ, then 0.76 *17.6≈13.4 kJ. But the options don't have 17.6 per mole. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the molar Gibbs energy change and then multiplied by moles.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is ΔG = V_m (P2 - P1). So for 1 mole, ΔG = V_m (P2 - P1).

V_m is 58.35 cm³/mol = 0.05835 L/mol.

ΔP = 2999 atm.
