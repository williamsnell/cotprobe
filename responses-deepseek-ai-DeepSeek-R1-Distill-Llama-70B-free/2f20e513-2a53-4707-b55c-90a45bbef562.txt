Question:

A traffic accident occurred at a road intersection. A motorcycle, a car, and a truck were involved. The motorcyclist was injured and brought suit against the driver of the car and the driver of the truck. The jury returned a verdict finding that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three of the parties. The jury assigned 55 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the motorcyclist, 25 percent to the driver of the car, and 20 percent to the driver of the truck. The jury found that the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries was$100,000. The motorcyclist enforces the judgment against the driver of the car and collects $45,000 from the driver of the car. If the driver of the car then brings an action against the driver of the truck for contribution, the driver of the car should

Options:

A: recover $5,000.
B: recover $45,000, the amount he paid to the motorcyclist.
C: recover $35,000.
D: recover $25,000.
E: recover nothing, as he has already collected from the motorcyclist.
F: recover $20,000.
G: recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the driver of the truck.
H: recover $27,000.
I: recover $15,000.
J: recover $30,000.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically dealing with joint and several liability and contribution among defendants. Hmm, I remember that when multiple parties are found negligent, each can be held responsible for their share of the damages. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules, so I need to think this through carefully.

The scenario is a traffic accident involving a motorcycle, a car, and a truck. The motorcyclist sued both the car and truck drivers. The jury found all three parties at fault: the motorcyclist 55%, the car driver 25%, and the truck driver 20%. The total damages were $100,000.

The motorcyclist then enforced the judgment against the car driver and collected $45,000. Now, the car driver is suing the truck driver for contribution. The question is, how much can the car driver recover?

Wait, so the motorcyclist's total injury was $100k, but he was 55% at fault, so his recovery would be reduced by that percentage. So his actual recovery should be $100k * (1 - 0.55) = $45k. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, in some jurisdictions, the plaintiff can recover the full amount from any defendant, but defendants can seek contribution from each other based on their percentage of fault.

Wait, the motorcyclist collected $45k from the car driver. But the total he's supposed to get is $45k (since 55% of $100k is $55k, so he can recover $45k). So the car driver paid the full amount that the motorcyclist was entitled to. But the car driver was only 25% at fault, so shouldn't the truck driver, who was 20% at fault, pay his share?

In contribution actions, each defendant is responsible for their proportionate share. So the car driver paid the entire $45k, but he was only 25% liable. The truck driver is 20% liable, so perhaps the car driver can get the truck driver to pay their 20% share of the $45k.

Wait, let me break it down. The motorcyclist's total possible recovery is $45k because he was 55% at fault. The car driver was found 25% responsible, truck driver 20%. So the total liability is 25+20=45%, which matches the motorcyclist's recovery.

The car driver paid $45k, which is the full amount, but he's only liable for 25% of the total $100k, which would be $25k. So he overpaid by $20k ($45k paid minus $25k liability). So he can seek contribution from the truck driver for the truck driver's share.

The truck driver is 20% liable. So in terms of the total $100k, the truck driver owes $20k. But in terms of the motorcyclist's recovery, which was $45k, the truck driver's share is (20/45)*$45k? Wait, no. Alternatively, the car driver's overpayment is $20k, which is the amount he paid beyond his own liability. Since the truck driver's share is 20% of the total liability (25+20=45%), maybe the car driver can recover from the truck driver the proportionate share based on their percentages.

Wait, another approach: The motorcyclist's damages are $100k, but he's 55% at fault, so he can recover 45% of that, which is $45k. So the total liability is $45k. The car driver was 25% at fault, so his share is 25% of $100k, which is $25k. The truck driver's share is 20% of $100k, which is $20k.

Wait, but if the car driver paid the full $45k, he's seeking contribution from the truck driver for the truck's $20k share. Because the car driver paid $45k, which includes his own $25k and the truck's $20k. So he should be able to recover the $20k from the truck driver.

So the car driver paid $45k, which is $25k (his share) + $20k (truck's share). So he can get the $20k back from the truck driver.

Looking at the options, option F is $20k, and option C is $35k. Wait, no, option F says $20k. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me think again. Another angle: The car driver and truck driver are both defendants, each with their own percentages. The total liability is 25+20=45%, so their combined liability is 45% of $100k, which is $45k. The motorcyclist can recover up to $45k. The car driver paid the full $45k, so he can seek contribution from the truck driver for the truck's portion.

In some jurisdictions, when a defendant pays more than their share, they can recover from other defendants based on the proportion of fault. So the car driver's share is 25%, truck's 20%. So the total liability is 45%, so each is responsible for their percentage. The car driver paid 100%, so he can seek 20% from the truck driver.

Wait, the total liability is $45k. The car driver paid all of it. So the truck driver should contribute their 20% of $45k, which is $9k? Or is it based on their percentage of the total fault?

Wait, perhaps the contribution is based on the proportion of each defendant's fault. So the car driver was 25% and the truck 20%. Together, 45%. So the car driver's share is 25/45, which is 5/9. The truck's share is 20/45, which is 4/9. So the car driver, having paid the entire $45k, can get the truck driver to pay their 4/9 share, which is 4/9 *45k = 20k.

Yes, that makes sense. So the car driver should recover $20k from the truck driver. So the correct answer is F.

The question involves a traffic accident where a motorcyclist, a car driver, and a truck driver were found negligent. The jury assigned fault as follows: 55% to the motorcyclist, 25% to the car driver, and 20% to the truck driver. The total damages were $100,000, but the motorcyclist's recovery was reduced to $45,000 due to their 55% fault. The motorcyclist collected the full $45,000 from the car driver, who then sued the truck driver for contribution.

In this scenario, the car driver paid the entire $45,000, which represents the total recoverable damages. However, the car driver was only responsible for 25% of the total fault, and the truck driver was responsible for 20%. The car driver overpaid by $20,000 ($45,000 paid - $25,000 liability). The truck driver's share of the liability is $20,000 (20% of $100,000). Therefore, the car driver can recover $20,000 from the truck driver as their proportionate share of the liability.

The correct answer is **F: recover $20,000**.
