Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the force constant of H^127I using its infrared spectrum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's an intense line at 2309 cm^-1. I remember that in vibrational spectroscopy, the wavenumber of the absorption is related to the vibrational frequency of the molecule. Oh right, that's the fundamental vibrational frequency, which is usually the ν (nu) in the formulas.

Wait, so the formula connecting wavenumber and force constant is something like... Oh yeah, the equation is ν (in cm^-1) equals (1/(2πc)) multiplied by the square root of (k/μ), where k is the force constant and μ is the reduced mass of the molecule. But wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly. Oh wait, I think the actual formula relates the wavenumber (tilde ν) to the vibrational frequency (ν) as tilde ν = ν/c. So rearranging, ν = tilde ν * c.

So the main equation I need is the one that connects ν, k, and μ. Oh right, ν equals (1/(2π)) times the square root of (k/μ). But wait, when we have tilde ν, which is in cm^-1, that's ν/c. So substituting, we get:

tilde ν = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ).

I think that's correct. So rearranging this equation to solve for k, the force constant:

k = (tilde ν * 2πc)^2 * μ.

Right, so I'll need to compute this. Let's list the values I need.

First, the given tilde ν is 2309 cm^-1. The speed of light c is in cm/s, I believe. Let me confirm: the speed of light is approximately 3.0 x 10^10 cm/s.

Next, I need the reduced mass μ of HI. Since it's H^127I, the molecule is diatomic, so μ is (m_H * m_I) / (m_H + m_I). The masses here would be in atomic mass units (u), but I think I need to convert them into kilograms because the force constant is in N/m, which uses SI units.

Wait, the atomic masses: H is about 1 u, and I-127 is about 127 u. Wait, let me get the exact masses. The exact atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1.00784 u, and for iodine-127, it's 126.90447 u. But for calculations, perhaps I can approximate them as 1.008 u and 127 u respectively? Or maybe just 1 and 127 for simplicity, though that might introduce a small error. Let me think about the reduced mass calculation.

So, reduced mass μ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2). So for HI, m1 is H (1.008 u) and m2 is I (127 u).

But wait, I need to convert these atomic mass units into kilograms. I remember that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg. So I'll have to convert both masses.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the reduced mass in kg using the formula. Let's see:

μ = (m_H * m_I) / (m_H + m_I) 

m_H = 1.00784 u = 1.00784 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me calculate that. 1.00784 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 1.6735e-27 kg.

m_I = 127 u? Wait, wait, wait. Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Iodine-127 has an atomic mass of 127 u, right. So:

m_I = 127 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute that. 127 * 1.6605e-27. Let's see: 127 * 1.6605 = ?

Well, 100 * 1.6605 = 166.05, 27 *1.6605= 44.8035 → total 210.8535. So 210.8535e-27 kg → 2.108535e-25 kg.

Wait wait, wait: 127 * 1.6605e-27 = (127 * 1.6605) x 1e-27 → 210.85 (approx) x 1e-27 → 2.1085e-25 kg.

Now, m_H is 1.00784 u → 1.00784 * 1.6605e-27 → approx 1.6735e-27 kg.

So the reduced mass μ is (1.6735e-27 kg * 2.1085e-25 kg) / (1.6735e-27 + 2.1085e-25).

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.6735e-27) * (2.1085e-25) → 1.6735 * 2.1085 ≈ 3.53e-52 kg².

Denominator: 1.6735e-27 + 2.1085e-25 = let's see, 2.1085e-25 is much larger, so the sum is approximately 2.1085e-25 + 0.016735e-25 → 2.1252e-25 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.53e-52 / 2.1252e-25 = approx 1.66e-27 kg.

Wait, that's interesting. Because the reduced mass of HI is very close to the mass of H because I is so heavy compared to H. So μ is approximately 1.66e-27 kg, which is close to the mass of H. But let me double-check my calculations.

Alternative approach: compute in terms of u first, then convert to kg.

μ = (1.00784 u * 127 u) / (1.00784 + 127) u.

So denominator is 128.00784 u. Numerator is 1.00784 * 127 → approx 127.99 → about 128 u².

So μ ≈ (128 u²) / (128.00784 u) ) → μ ≈ (128/128.00784) u → approx 0.99993 u. So approximately 1 u.

Wait, but when I converted earlier, I got around 1.66e-27 kg, which is 1 u (since 1 u is 1.66e-27 kg). That makes sense. So the reduced mass is approximately 1 u, which is 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, but let me be precise. The exact calculation is:

μ = (m_H * m_I) / (m_H + m_I) 

m_H = 1.00784 u, m_I = 127 u.

So μ = (1.00784 * 127) / (1.00784 + 127) u.

Calculating numerator: 1.00784 * 127 = let's compute that. 1 * 127 =127, 0.00784 * 127 = approx 1. So total around 128.

Denominator: 1.00784 + 127 = 128.00784 u.

So μ = 128 / 128.00784 ≈ 0.99993 u → approx 0.99993 * 1.6605e-27 kg → 1.66e-27 kg.

So yes, μ is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

Now, going back to the formula for k:

k = (tilde ν * 2π c )² * μ.

Wait, let me write that in terms of the variables:

k = (tilde ν * 2 * π * c )^2 * μ.

Wait, no, the formula is tilde ν = (1/(2π c)) * sqrt(k/μ).

Wait, let me rederive this to make sure.

The vibrational frequency ν (in Hz) is given by ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ).

But the wavenumber tilde ν is ν/c, because tilde ν (cm^-1) equals ν (Hz) divided by c (cm/s). So:

tilde ν = ν / c → ν = tilde ν * c.

Substituting into the ν equation:

tilde ν * c = (1/(2π)) sqrt(k/μ) → 

sqrt(k/μ) = 2 π c tilde ν → 

k/μ = (2 pi c tilde ν)^2 → 

k = μ (2 pi c tilde ν)^2.

Yes, that's correct.

So now, putting in the numbers:

tilde ν = 2309 cm^-1.

c = speed of light in cm/s = 2.99792e10 cm/s approximately. Let me use 3e10 for simplicity, but probably I should use a more accurate value for precise calculation.

Wait, but in exams, sometimes approximations are used. Let's see what the options are, but perhaps I should be precise.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

Compute 2 * π * c * tilde ν.

c = 2.99792e10 cm/s.

tilde ν = 2309 cm^-1.

So 2 * pi * 2.99792e10 cm/s * 2309 cm^-1.

Let me compute this:

First, compute 2 * pi ≈ 6.2832.

So 6.2832 * 2.99792e10 = let's calculate that.

6.2832 * 3e10 would be approx 1.88496e11, but let's compute precisely.

2.99792e10 * 6.2832 = ?

Well, 2.99792e10 * 6 = 1.798752e11.

2.99792e10 * 0.2832 = ?

Let me compute 2.99792e10 * 0.2 = 5.99584e9.

2.99792e10 * 0.08 = 2.398336e9.

2.99792e10 * 0.0032 = approx 9.590944e7.

Adding those together: 5.99584e9 + 2.398336e9 = 8.394176e9, plus 9.590944e7 → 8.453566e9.

So total 1.798752e11 + 8.453566e9 = 1.88693e11.

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, 2.99792e10 * 6.2832 = 2.99792e10 * (6 + 0.2832) = (2.99792e10 *6) + (2.99792e10 *0.2832) → 1.798752e11 + 8.453e9 → 1.88693e11 cm/s.

Wait, but then multiply by tilde ν, which is 2309 cm^-1.

Wait, no, the 2 pi c tilde ν would be in s^-1? Let me see the units:

c is in cm/s, tilde ν in cm^-1. So 2 pi c tilde ν has units of (cm/s * cm^-1) → 1/s, which is correct for angular frequency (radian/s).

So 2 pi c tilde ν = 6.2832 * 2.99792e10 cm/s * 2309 cm^-1 → let's compute the numerical value.

Let me compute 2.99792e10 * 2309 = ?

2.99792e10 * 2000 = 5.99584e13.

2.99792e10 * 300 = 8.99376e12.

2.99792e10 * 9 = 2.698128e10.

Adding them: 5.99584e13 + 8.99376e12 = 6.795216e13 + 2.698128e10 ≈ 6.795216e13 cm²/s.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2.99792e10 cm/s * 2309 cm^-1 = 2.99792e10 * 2309 (cm/s * cm^-1) → 2.99792e10 * 2309 (1/s).

Wait, 2.99792e10 *2309 = ?

Let me compute 3e10 *2309 = 6.927e13, but let's be precise.

2309 = 2000 + 300 +9.

2.99792e10 * 2000 = 5.99584e13.

2.99792e10 * 300 = 8.99376e12.

2.99792e10 *9 = 2.698128e10.

Adding: 5.99584e13 +8.99376e12=6.7952e13 +2.698128e10=6.82489e13 (approx).

So 2.99792e10 *2309 = approx 6.82489e13.

Multiply by 6.2832 (which is 2 pi):

6.2832 * 6.82489e13 → let's compute 6 *6.82489e13=4.094934e14.

0.2832 *6.82489e13 → approx 1.9306e13.

Total: 4.094934e14 +1.9306e13=4.28759e14.

So 2 pi c tilde ν ≈ 4.28759e14 s^-1.

Wait, but let me double-check these calculations because they're getting a bit large and I might be making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute each step precisely.

Compute 2 * pi * c * tilde ν:

c = 2.99792e10 cm/s.

tilde ν = 2309 cm^-1.

So 2 * pi * 2.99792e10 * 2309.

Let's compute 2.99792e10 *2309 first.

2.99792e10 * 2309 = ?

Let me break it down:

2.99792e10 = 29979200000.

Multiply by 2309:

Hmm, 29979200000 * 2309. That's a big number. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 29979.2 * 2309 and then account for the 10^6 factor.

Wait, 29979.2 *2309 = ?

Well, 30000 *2309 = 69,270,000.

But 29979.2 is 30000 - 20.8.

So 69,270,000 - (20.8 *2309) → 20.8 *2309 = ?

20 *2309=46180.

0.8 *2309=1847.2.

Total:46180 + 1847.2=48,027.2.

So 69,270,000 -48,027.2=69,221,972.8.

So 29979.2 *2309 = 69,221,972.8.

Now, considering that 29979200000 = 29979.2e6 → so 29979.2e6 *2309 = 69,221,972.8e6 → 6.92219728e13.

Wait, that's 6.92219728e13? Because 69,221,972.8e6 is 6.92219728e13.

Then, multiply by 2 pi → 6.2832.

So 6.92219728e13 *6.2832 ≈ ?

Compute 6 *6.92219728e13 =4.153318e14.

0.2832 *6.92219728e13 = approx:

0.2 *6.92219728e13=1.384439e13.

0.08 *6.92219728e13=5.5377578e12.

0.0032 *6.92219728e13=2.215402e12.

Adding these together: 1.384439e13 +5.5377578e12=1.938, 1.938e13 +2.2154e12=2.160e13.

So total is 4.153318e14 + 2.160e13 = approx 4.3695e14.

So 2 pi c tilde ν ≈ 4.3695e14 s^-1.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the exponents. Let me recheck.

Wait, 29979200000 is 2.99792e10. So 2.99792e10 *2309 = ?

2.99792e10 *2309 = (2.99792 *2309) e10.

2.99792 *2309 → let's compute 3 *2309 = 6927, but since it's 2.99792, it's a bit less.

So 2.99792 *2309 = 2309 *3 - (0.00208 *2309).

Which is 6927 - (4.806) → 6922.194.

So 2.99792 *2309 ≈6922.194.

So 6922.194e10 → that's 6.922194e13.

Then, 2 pi times that is 6.2832 *6.922194e13 → which is approximately:

6 *6.922194e13 =4.153316e14.

0.2832 *6.922194e13 = let's compute 0.2 *6.922194e13=1.3844388e13.

0.08 *6.922194e13=5.5377555e12.

0.0032 *6.922194e13=2.21542e12.

Adding these: 1.3844388e13 +5.5377555e12 =1.938, 1.938e13 +2.21542e12 → 2.16e13.

So total is 4.1533e14 +2.16e13 =4.3693e14 s^-1.

So 2 pi c tilde ν ≈4.3693e14 rad/s.

Wait, but I think I might have confused the order. Because 2 pi c tilde ν would be in units of 1/s, which is correct.

Now, k is μ multiplied by (2 pi c tilde ν)^2.

So, (4.3693e14 )^2 = (4
