Okay, so I have this problem here about two linear equations and their graphs being perpendicular. Hmm, I need to find the value of 'a' in the second equation. Let's see.

The first equation is x + 2y + 3 = 0. I remember that the general form of a line is Ax + By + C = 0, and the slope is -A/B. So for this equation, A is 1 and B is 2. So the slope would be -1/2. I think that's right.

The second equation is ax + 2y + 3 = 0. Similarly, here A is 'a' and B is 2. So the slope would be -a/2. 

Wait, the problem says the two lines are perpendicular. Oh right, when two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. So I should set the product of the two slopes equal to -1.

Let me write that down. Slope1 * Slope2 = -1. So (-1/2) * (-a/2) = -1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me think again. Slope1 is -1/2 and Slope2 is -a/2. So their product should be -1.

So (-1/2) * (-a/2) = (a)/4. And this equals -1. So a/4 = -1? That can't be right because that would make a = -4. But wait, let's double-check.

Wait, no. If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes m1 and m2 satisfy m1 * m2 = -1. So m1 is -1/2, m2 is -a/2. So (-1/2) * (-a/2) = (a/4). Setting that equal to -1: a/4 = -1. So a = -4. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is -4. So that must be the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the slopes right? Let me make sure.

First equation: x + 2y +3 =0. Solving for y: 2y = -x -3 → y = (-1/2)x - 3/2. So slope is -1/2. Correct.

Second equation: ax + 2y +3=0 → 2y = -ax -3 → y = (-a/2)x - 3/2. So slope is -a/2. Correct.

Perpendicular condition: (-1/2) * (-a/2) = -1. Let's compute that. Multiplying (-1/2) and (-a/2) gives (a)/4. So (a/4) = -1 → a = -4.

Okay, so yeah, a is -4, which is option C.

To determine the value of \( a \) such that the graphs of the equations \( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \) and \( ax + 2y + 3 = 0 \) are perpendicular, we start by finding the slopes of the two lines.

1. For the first equation \( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \), solving for \( y \) gives:
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}.
   \]
   Thus, the slope (\( m_1 \)) is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).

2. For the second equation \( ax + 2y + 3 = 0 \), solving for \( y \) gives:
   \[
   y = -\frac{a}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}.
   \]
   Thus, the slope (\( m_2 \)) is \( -\frac{a}{2} \).

3. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must satisfy:
   \[
   m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1.
   \]
   Substituting \( m_1 = -\frac{1}{2} \) and \( m_2 = -\frac{a}{2} \), we get:
   \[
   \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) = -1.
   \]

4. Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{a}{4} = -1.
   \]

5. Solving for \( a \):
   \[
   a = -4.
   \]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is \( -4 \), which corresponds to option C.
