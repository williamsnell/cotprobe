Okay, so I've got this problem about the heating value of a coal sample. Hmm, I remember that heating value is related to the energy released when a substance is burned. I think it's measured in terms like Btu per pound or calories per gram. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says a 1.4447-gm sample of coal is burned in an oxygen-bomb calorimeter. The temperature rises by 7.795 degrees Fahrenheit, but wait, oh, they converted that to Celsius as 4.331°C. Oh right, sometimes in these calorimetry problems, you calculate the energy based on the temperature change.

The setup involves the calorimeter itself (which has a certain mass m_c) and the surrounding water (mass m_w). The water equivalent of the calorimeter is given as 2511 gm. Wait, water equivalent is a concept where the calorimeter's heat capacity is considered equivalent to a certain mass of water. So the formula for water equivalent should be m_w + (m_c * c_c / c_w), where c_c is the specific heat of the calorimeter and c_w is that of water. But since the problem gives the water equivalent directly, maybe I don't need to worry about calculating that part.

So the main idea here is to calculate the heat released by the coal burning, which then heats up the water and the calorimeter. The formula I remember is q = (heat capacity of the system) * (temperature change). But wait, the heat is absorbed by both the water and the calorimeter, so the total heat capacity is the combined effect.

The water equivalent is given as 2511 gm, so I can treat that as the effective mass of water. The specific heat of water is 1 cal/(g·°C), right? So the heat absorbed, q, should be q = (water equivalent) * (temp change in °C) * (specific heat of water).

Wait, but wait, the water equivalent is in grams, and specific heat is per gram, so the calculation would be straightforward.

Let me plug in the numbers. Water equivalent is 2511 gm, temp change is 4.331°C. So q = 2511 * 4.331 * 1 cal/(g·°C). Let me calculate that.

2511 multiplied by 4.331. Let's see, 2500 *4 is 10,000, 2500 *0.331 is about 827.5. So 2500 *4.331 is about 10,827.5. Then 11 *4.331 is about 47.641, so total would be around 10,827.5 + 47.641 = 10,875.141 calories. So approximately 10,875 cal.

But wait, what's the significance of this q? Oh, right, that's the heat released by the burning of the coal sample. So the coal's heating value is this q per unit mass of coal.

The sample's mass is 1.4447 gm. So the heating value in cal/gm would be q divided by mass. So 10,875 cal / 1.4447 gm.

Let me calculate that: 10,875 / 1.4447 ≈ let's see, 10,875 ÷ 1.4447. Let me approximate. 1.4447 is about 1.445. So 10,875 ÷ 1.445. Let's compute 1.445 * 7500 = 1.445 *7.5e3 = 10,837.5. That's close to 10,875. So 7500 cal/gm would give us 10,837.5. The difference is 10,875 - 10,837.5 = 37.5. So 37.5 /1.445 ≈ 26. So the heating value would be approximately 7526 cal/gm. Looking at the options, option C is 7525 cal/gm, that's really close.

Alternatively, maybe I should be precise. Let me calculate 10,875 ÷ 1.4447.

Let me compute 1.4447 * 7525 = ?

Wait, maybe I should do it as 10,875 /1.4447.

Let me compute 1.4447 * 7525:

First, 7000 *1.4447= 10,122.9

500 *1.4447= 722.35 → total so far 10,122.9 +722.35=10,845.25

25 *1.4447= 36.1175 → total 10,845.25 +36.1175=10,881.3675.

Wait, but 1.4447 *7525 is about 10,881.3675, which is slightly higher than 10,875. So perhaps the exact value is a bit less than 7525.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10,875 ÷1.4447.

Let me set it up as 1.4447 * x = 10,875.

x = 10,875 /1.4447 ≈ Let me do division step by step.

1.4447 ) 10,875.00

1.4447 goes into 10,875 how many times?

Let me compute 1.4447 * 7500 = 1.4447*7.5e3 = 10,835.25.

Subtract that from 10,875: 10,875 -10,835.25 = 39.75.

So 39.75 left. 1.4447 goes into 39.75 about 27.5 times (since 1.4447 *27= 39.0, and 1.4447*27.5=39.0 + 0.72235=39.72235). So 27.5.

So total x =7500 +27.5=7527.5 cal/gm.

Looking at the options, option C is 7525, which is very close. So the heating value is approximately 7525 cal/gm.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is 7525 cal/gm. Option E is 10,875 cal, which is the q value, but per gram it's per the sample. So the question is asking for the heating value of the coal sample, which is q per gram. So the correct answer should be 7525 cal/gm.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 7525 cal/gm, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in units. Wait, the temperature change was given in Fahrenheit but converted to Celsius. Oh wait no, the problem states the rise is 7.795 F° which is equal to 4.331 C°. So I used the correct Celsius value in the calculation. So that part is correct.

So the correct answer should be option C: 7525 cal/gm.

To determine the heating value of the coal sample, we calculate the heat released during combustion using the formula:

\[
q = \text{(water equivalent)} \times \text{(temperature change)} \times \text{(specific heat of water)}
\]

The water equivalent of the calorimeter is given as 2511 gm, the temperature change is \( \Delta T = 4.331^\circ \text{C} \), and the specific heat of water is \( 1 \, \text{cal/(g} \cdot ^\circ \text{C)} \). Substituting these values:

\[
q = 2511 \, \text{gm} \times 4.331^\circ \text{C} \times 1 \, \text{cal/(g} \cdot ^\circ \text{C)} = 10,875 \, \text{cal}
\]

This is the total heat released by the combustion of the coal sample. To find the heating value of the coal, we divide the total heat by the mass of the coal sample:

\[
\text{Heating value} = \frac{q}{\text{mass of coal}} = \frac{10,875 \, \text{cal}}{1.4447 \, \text{gm}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Heating value} \approx 7525 \, \text{cal/gm}
\]

This matches option C, which states \( 7525 \, \text{cal/gm} \). Therefore, the heating value of the coal sample is:

**C: 7525 (cal/gm)**
