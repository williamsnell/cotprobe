Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So Peter bought a typewriter for $125, but there's a 5% discount. Then there are taxes involved: state sales tax is 4.5% and city tax is 2.5%. I need to calculate how much Peter ended up paying.

First, I think I should calculate the discount. The original price is $125, and the discount is 5%. So, 5% of 125 is... let me compute that. 5% is 0.05, so 125 * 0.05 equals $6.25. So the discount is $6.25. That means the price after discount is 125 minus 6.25, which is $118.75. Okay, so the discounted price is $118.75.

Now, I have to apply the taxes. There are two taxes: state and city. Wait, are these taxes applied to the discounted price or the original price? I think taxes are usually applied after discounts because that's the final amount the seller receives. So the taxable amount is $118.75.

Wait, but sometimes sales tax might be calculated on the original price, but in this case, the problem says Peter bought it for $125 less a 5% discount, so I think the tax is on the discounted amount. So I'll proceed with that.

State tax is 4.5%, and city tax is 2.5%. So total tax rate is 4.5 + 2.5 = 7%. So 7% tax on $118.75.

Let me compute 7% of 118.75. 10% would be 11.875, so 1% is 1.1875. So 7% is 1.1875 *7. Let's see: 1 *7 is 7, 0.1875*7 is 1.3125, so total 7 + 1.3125 = 8.3125. So the tax is $8.3125.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, 7% is 0.07, so 118.75 * 0.07. Let me compute that. 100 *0.07 is 7, 18.75 *0.07 is 1.3125, so 7 + 1.3125 is 8.3125. So yes, $8.3125 tax.

So the total amount Peter paid is the discounted price plus tax. So that's 118.75 + 8.3125. Let me add those. 118.75 +8 is 126.75, plus 0.3125 is 127.0625. So approximately $127.06.

Looking at the options, option D is $127.06. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes taxes are applied one after another, but I don't think that's the case here. Because 4.5% and 2.5% are both sales taxes applied to the same base. So adding them gives the total tax rate of 7%, which is what I did. So that's correct.

So yes, the total amount is $127.06, which is option D.

To determine how much Peter paid for the typewriter, we start with the original price of $125 and apply a 5% discount. The discount amount is calculated as:

\[
\text{Discount} = 125 \times 0.05 = 6.25
\]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives the discounted price:

\[
\text{Discounted Price} = 125 - 6.25 = 118.75
\]

Next, we calculate the total tax. The state sales tax is 4.5%, and the city tax is 2.5%, giving a combined tax rate of:

\[
\text{Total Tax Rate} = 4.5\% + 2.5\% = 7\%
\]

Applying this tax rate to the discounted price:

\[
\text{Tax} = 118.75 \times 0.07 = 8.3125
\]

Adding the tax to the discounted price gives the total amount Peter paid:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 118.75 + 8.3125 = 127.0625 \approx 127.06
\]

Thus, the total amount Peter paid is approximately $127.06, which corresponds to option D.
