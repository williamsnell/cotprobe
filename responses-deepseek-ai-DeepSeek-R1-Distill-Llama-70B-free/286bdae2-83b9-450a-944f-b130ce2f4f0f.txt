Okay, so I've got this problem here with three equations and I need to find the value of 'a'. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The equations are:
1. a² / b = 1
2. b² / c = 2
3. c² / a = 3

Hmm, all right, so we're dealing with three variables here: a, b, and c. I remember that when you have multiple variables and equations, you can sometimes express each variable in terms of another and substitute them to solve for one variable.

Let me start with the first equation. Equation 1 is a² / b = 1. If I rearrange that, I can solve for b. So multiplying both sides by b gives a² = b. Then, dividing both sides by 1 (which is just multiplying), I get b = a². Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no. Let's see: a² divided by b equals 1, so a² = b * 1, which simplifies to b = a². Yeah, that's correct. So b is equal to a squared.

Now, moving on to equation 2: b² / c = 2. Again, I can solve for c here. Multiplying both sides by c gives b² = 2c. Then, dividing both sides by 2, c = b² / 2. But since I already have b in terms of a, I can substitute that in. Since b is a², substituting gives c = (a²)² / 2. Let's compute that: (a^2)^2 is a^4, so c = a^4 / 2.

Next, equation 3: c² / a = 3. I can solve for a here, but let's first express c in terms of a. From the previous step, we know c is a^4 / 2. So substituting into equation 3: ( (a^4 / 2) )² / a = 3. Let me compute that step by step.

First, square the c term: (a^4 / 2)^2 is a^(4*2) / (2^2) which is a^8 / 4. So the equation becomes (a^8 / 4) divided by a equals 3. Dividing by a is the same as multiplying by 1/a, so (a^8 / 4) * (1/a) = a^(8-1) /4 = a^7 /4.

And that's equal to 3. So, a^7 / 4 = 3. To solve for a, I can multiply both sides by 4, giving a^7 = 12. Then, taking the seventh root of both sides, a = 12^(1/7).

Wait, but let me double-check that. Let me retrace the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from equation 1: b = a². Equation 2: c = (b²)/2 = (a^4)/2. Equation 3: c² / a =3. So c squared is (a^4 /2)^2 = a^8 /4. Dividing by a gives a^7 /4 = 3. So a^7 is 12, so a is 12^(1/7), which would be option F.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option F is 6^(1/7), but I got 12^(1/7). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no, the options given are:

A: 2
B:7^(1/6)
C:12^(1/6)
D:12^(1/7)
E:6
F:6^(1/7)
G:1
H:2^(1/12)
I:7^(1/12)
J:3

So, 12^(1/7) is option D, not F. So that would make the correct answer D.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let's go through the steps again.

Equation 1: a² = b → b = a².

Equation 2: b² = 2c → (a²)^2 = 2c → a^4 = 2c → c = a^4 / 2.

Equation 3: c² = 3a → (a^4 / 2)^2 =3a → a^8 /4 =3a → Multiply both sides by 4: a^8 =12a → Divide both sides by a (since a is positive, a≠0): a^7 =12 → a=12^(1/7), which is option D.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D.
</think>

To solve for \(a\), we start with the given equations:

1. \(\frac{a^2}{b} = 1 \implies b = a^2\)
2. \(\frac{b^2}{c} = 2 \implies c = \frac{b^2}{2} = \frac{(a^2)^2}{2} = \frac{a^4}{2}\)
3. \(\frac{c^2}{a} = 3 \implies c^2 = 3a\)

Substituting \(c = \frac{a^4}{2}\) into \(c^2 = 3a\):

\[
\left(\frac{a^4}{2}\right)^2 = 3a \implies \frac{a^8}{4} = 3a
\]

Multiply through by 4:

\[
a^8 = 12a
\]

Divide both sides by \(a\) (since \(a > 0\)):

\[
a^7 = 12 \implies a = 12^{1/7}
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is \(12^{1/7}\), which corresponds to option **D**.
