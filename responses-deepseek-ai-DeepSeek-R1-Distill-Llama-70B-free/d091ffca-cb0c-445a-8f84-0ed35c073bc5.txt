Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the de Broglie wavelength of a radium alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus, He²+. The energy given is 4.8 MeV. Hmm, I've heard about de Broglie wavelength before, so I think it's related to the wave-particle duality concept.

Wait, de Broglie wavelength is the wavelength associated with a particle, right? The formula for that is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle. But I'm not entirely sure about the steps to get there. Let me think.

So the particle here is an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus. That means it's two protons and two neutrons, so its mass should be roughly four times the mass of a proton. Wait, but I should get the exact mass. Oh wait, I remember that the mass of a helium nucleus is about 4 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 1.66 x 10^-27 kg, so the mass m would be 4 * 1.66e-27 kg, which is 6.64e-27 kg.

But wait, the problem gives the energy as 4.8 MeV. Oh right, because this energy is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle. So I probably need to calculate the momentum from this kinetic energy.

Wait, but how do I relate kinetic energy to momentum? I remember that for relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², but at the same time, for particles like alpha particles, when they're emitted from radioactive decay, their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so maybe relativistic effects matter here. But I'm not sure if I can ignore them. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the kinetic energy is given in MeV, and the rest mass of the alpha particle is about 4 u, which is around 3.73 MeV/c², because each u is about 931.5 MeV/c². Wait, no, wait, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 4 u is 4 * 931.5 ≈ 3726 MeV/c², so 3.726 GeV/c².

Wait, but the kinetic energy here is 4.8 MeV. So that's much smaller than the rest mass energy. So the alpha particle is moving at non-relativistic speeds. So I can use the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula: KE = (1/2)mv², and also p = mv. So from KE, I can find v, and then p.

Alternatively, since KE = p²/(2m), solving for p gives p = sqrt(2mKE). That might be a better approach because it directly relates KE to momentum without needing to find velocity first.

Wait, but the energy is given in eV, and I need to make sure the units are consistent. Oh right, because in the formula, we have to have SI units. So I need to convert the energy from MeV to joules.

So 4.8 MeV is 4.8 million electron volts. Since 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules, so 4.8e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV equals approximately 7.7e-13 J.

Wait, let me compute that: 4.8e6 * 1.602e-19 = 4.8 * 1.602 = about 7.6896, so 7.6896e-13 J.

So KE is 7.6896e-13 J. Now, the mass m is 4 u. Wait, 1 u is 1.6605e-27 kg, so 4 u is 6.642e-27 kg.

So p = sqrt(2mKE). Plugging in the numbers:

p = sqrt(2 * 6.642e-27 kg * 7.6896e-13 J).

Let me compute the product inside the square root first.

2 * 6.642e-27 = 1.3284e-26.

Multiply that by 7.6896e-13: 1.3284e-26 * 7.6896e-13 = (1.3284 * 7.6896) x 10^(-26-13) = (let me compute 1.3284 * 7.6896).

Hmm, 1.3 * 7.7 is about 10.01. But more accurately:

1.3284 * 7.6896:

= (1 + 0.3284) * (7 + 0.6896)
= 1*7 + 1*0.6896 + 0.3284*7 + 0.3284*0.6896
=7 + 0.6896 + 2.2988 + 0.2265
= 7 + 0.6896 is 7.6896, plus 2.2988 is 9.9884, plus 0.2265 is 10.2149.

So approximately 10.2149e-39 kg² m²/s². So the square root of that is sqrt(10.2149e-39) = sqrt(10.2149) * 1e-19.5.

Wait, sqrt(10.2149) is about 3.194. And 1e-19.5 is 1e-19.5 = 3.16e-20 (since 10^-20 is 1e-20, 10^-19 is 1e-19, so 10^-19.5 is sqrt(1e-39) which is 3.16e-20).

Wait, no: 1e-39 is (1e-19.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-39) is 1e-19.5 = approx 3.16e-20.

So combining, sqrt(10.2149e-39) ≈ 3.194 * 3.16e-20 = let's compute 3.194 *3.16.

3 *3.16 is 9.48, 0.194 *3.16 is about 0.613, so total ≈10.093. So p ≈ 10.093e-20 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, the units. 10.093e-20 is 1.0093e-19 kg m/s.

So p ≈ 1.0093e-19 kg m/s.

Now, Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J s.

The de Broglie wavelength is lambda = h / p.

So lambda = 6.626e-34 / 1.0093e-19.

Compute that: 6.626 / 1.0093 ≈ 6.56 (since 6.626 ÷ 1 is 6.626, but 1.0093 is a bit more than 1, so it's about 6.56).

So 6.56e-34 / 1e-19 = 6.56e-15 meters.

Wait, because 1e-34 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-15.

So 6.56e-15 meters is 6.56e-15 m. To convert to centimeters, since 1 m is 100 cm, so 6.56e-15 m is 6.56e-13 cm. Wait, because 1e-15 m is 1e-13 cm. So 6.56e-15 m = 6.56e-13 cm.

Looking at the options, let me check. The options given are A through J.

Looking again:

Option J is 6.6 ×10^-13 cm.

Hmm, which matches approximately what I got, 6.56e-13 cm, so probably option J. But wait, let me double-check the calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, wait, I think I might have messed up the mass of the alpha particle. Let me double-check. An alpha particle is He²+, which is a helium nucleus, so it's two protons and two neutrons. The atomic mass unit for helium is about 4 u, but each u is 1.66e-27 kg, so 4 * 1.66e-27 = 6.64e-27 kg.

Wait, but when I computed m earlier, I used 6.64e-27 kg. So that's correct. Then the KE was 4.8 MeV, which I converted to 7.6896e-13 J. That seems correct.

Then p = sqrt(2 * m * KE) = sqrt(2 * 6.64e-27 * 7.6896e-13) → inside sqrt: 2*6.64e-27=1.328e-26, multiplied by 7.6896e-13 gives 1.328e-26 *7.6896e-13 = (1.328 *7.6896 )e-39 → as before, approx 10.21e-39 → sqrt gives 3.194e-19.5 → approx 1e-19 kg m/s.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the exponent. Let me re-calculate 1.328e-26 *7.6896e-13.

Multiplying the exponents: 1e-26 *1e-13 = 1e-39. So 1.328 *7.6896 is 10.21 as before. So 10.21e-39 is 1.021e-38. So sqrt(1.021e-38) is sqrt(1.021) * sqrt(1e-38) → approx 1.01 * 1e-19, because sqrt(1e-38) is 1e-19.

So p ≈ 1.01e-19 kg m/s.

Then lambda = h/p = 6.626e-34 / 1.01e-19 → 6.56e-15 m, which is 6.56e-13 cm. So option J is 6.6e-13 cm, which is very close.

Wait, but let me check another approach, perhaps using the relativistic relation. Because sometimes, even when KE is much smaller than rest mass, relativistic momentum could be slightly different, but for 4.8 MeV and rest mass energy 3726 MeV, the kinetic energy is much smaller, so non-relativistic is okay.

Alternatively, another formula for de Broglie wavelength when given kinetic energy is lambda = h / sqrt(2mK), which is what I used.

Wait, but wait, let me try to compute it more accurately.

KE = 4.8 MeV = 4.8e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.602e-19 J, so KE =4.8e6 *1.602e-19 = 7.6896e-13 J.

Mass m =4 u =4 *1.6605e-27 kg =6.642e-27 kg.

p = sqrt(2mKE) = sqrt(2 * 6.642e-27 *7.6896e-13).

Compute inside the square root:

2 * 6.642e-27 =1.3284e-26.

Multiply by 7.6896e-13: 1.3284e-26 *7.6896e-13.

Compute 1.3284 *7.6896 = let's do it accurately.

1.3284 *7 =9.2988.

1.3284 *0.6896: Let's compute 1.3284 *0.6 = 0.79704, 1.3284 *0.08=0.106272, 1.3284 *0.0096=0.012745.

Adding those: 0.79704 +0.106272=0.903312 +0.012745=0.916057.

So total is 9.2988 +0.916057=10.214857.

So 1.3284e-26 *7.6896e-13 =10.214857e-39 =1.0214857e-38.

Square root is sqrt(1.0214857e-38) = (1.0214857^0.5) *1e-19.

sqrt(1.0214857) is approx 1.0107.

So p =1.0107e-19 kg m/s.

Now, h =6.62607015e-34 J s.

So lambda =6.626e-34 /1.0107e-19 = (6.626 /1.0107) e-15.

Calculate 6.626 ÷1.0107:

1.0107 *6.56 = approx 6.626. Let me check: 1.0107 *6=6.0642, 1.0107 *0.56= 0.56595. So 6.0642 +0.56595=6.63015. So 6.56 gives 6.63015, which is a bit higher than 6.626. So perhaps 6.55?

1.0107 *6.55 = 6.6135. Hmm, 6.626-6.6135=0.0125. So perhaps 6.55 + (0.0125 /1.0107) ≈6.55 +0.01236 ≈6.562.

So 6.562e-15 m, which is 6.562e-13 cm.

Looking at the options, option J is 6.6e-13 cm, which is very close. So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but looking back, the options given were:

J:6.6 ×10^-13 cm.

Yes, that's correct.

To determine the de Broglie wavelength of a radium alpha particle (a helium nucleus, He²+) with an energy of 4.8 MeV, we use the formula for the de Broglie wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( p \) is the momentum of the particle. The momentum can be calculated using the relationship:

\[
p = \sqrt{2mE}
\]

Here, \( m \) is the mass of the alpha particle, and \( E \) is its kinetic energy.

### Step 1: Mass of the alpha particle
The alpha particle is a helium nucleus, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Its mass is approximately \( 4 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \). Thus:

\[
m = 4 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} = 6.642 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Step 2: Energy conversion
The kinetic energy of the alpha particle is given as \( 4.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Converting this to joules:

\[
1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}, \quad 4.8 \, \text{MeV} = 4.8 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}.
\]

\[
E = 4.8 \times 10^6 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} = 7.6896 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Momentum calculation
Using \( p = \sqrt{2mE} \):

\[
p = \sqrt{2 \times 6.642 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \times 7.6896 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}}.
\]

First, calculate the product inside the square root:

\[
2 \times 6.642 \times 10^{-27} = 1.3284 \times 10^{-26}, \quad 1.3284 \times 10^{-26} \times 7.6896 \times 10^{-13} = 1.021 \times 10^{-38}.
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{1.021 \times 10^{-38}} = 1.01 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: De Broglie wavelength
Using \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.01 \times 10^{-19}} = 6.56 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Convert to centimeters (\( 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm} \)):

\[
\lambda = 6.56 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} = 6.56 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated wavelength is:

**J: \( 6.6 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \)**.

Answer: J
