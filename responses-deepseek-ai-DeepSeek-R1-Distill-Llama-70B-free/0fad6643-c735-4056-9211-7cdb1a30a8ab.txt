Okay, so I have this question about attachment patterns in children, specifically the anxious-avoidant type. Hmm, I remember that attachment styles are categorized into secure and insecure types. The insecure ones include anxious-avoidant, anxious-ambivalent, and disorganized-disoriented. 

Wait, the question is asking about the anxious-avoidant pattern. I think I need to recall the characteristics of each. So, in the Strange Situation test, which is used to assess attachment, children's reactions to separation and reunion with their caregiver are observed.

Anxious-avoidant kids, I think, don't seem too distressed when their mother leaves. Like, they might not cry much or show much anxiety. But when the mother comes back, they avoid her. They might turn away or not seek comfort. So their behavior is kind of avoidant upon reunion.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the child shows little distress when separated and turns away when she returns. That fits with what I was thinking.

Option B says the child is more anxious when the mother is absent and seeks contact upon return. That sounds more like anxious-ambivalent, but I'm not sure. Or maybe secure? Wait, no, secure kids are distressed but easily comforted. Anxious-ambivalent might be very distressed and then ambivalent when the mother returns—like wanting comfort but also being angry.

Option C is very distressed and remains anxious. That might be the anxious-ambivalent type, where the child is really upset and doesn't calm down easily.

Option D: more anxious when mother is present. That doesn't sound right for avoidant. Maybe the disorganized type?

Option E: very distressed but easily comforted. That's secure attachment.

Option F: no preference between stranger and mother. Maybe that's the disorganized or maybe avoidant. But avoidant might actually prefer the mother but still not seek comfort. Or do they? I'm a bit confused here.

Option G: extreme distress and clings. That's probably anxious-ambivalent.

Option H: very distressed but pulls away upon return. That could be avoidant, but wait, I thought avoidant kids don't get very distressed. Or maybe they do? Wait, no, avoidant are less distressed during separation. So H might not fit. Because the question is about anxious-avoidant, which is a subtype. Wait, actually, I think anxious-avoidant is another term for anxious type. Or maybe avoidant is a subtype. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The main categories are secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-ambivalent, and disorganized.

Anxious-avoidant children show little distress when separated but avoid the mother upon return. So the description in option A fits: shows little distress when separated and turns away when she returns.

Option J says shows little distress and seeks comfort from a stranger. That doesn't fit because the avoidant child wouldn't seek comfort much from anyone, maybe. Or maybe they might, but the key is turning away from the mother.

So the correct answer should be A.

The anxious-avoidant attachment pattern is characterized by a child showing little distress during separation from their caregiver and avoiding the caregiver upon reunion. In the Strange Situation test, such children typically do not exhibit significant anxiety when the mother leaves and may turn away or avoid her when she returns, rather than seeking comfort. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: This option accurately describes the anxious-avoidant pattern, as the child shows little distress during separation and avoids the mother upon return.  
- **B**: This describes a child who is anxious when the mother is absent and seeks contact upon return, which aligns more with an anxious-ambivalent pattern.  
- **C**: A child who remains highly anxious after the mother returns fits the anxious-ambivalent type, not anxious-avoidant.  
- **D**: A child who is more anxious when the mother is present is not typical of anxious-avoidant attachment.  
- **E**: This describes a secure attachment, where the child is easily comforted upon reunion.  
- **F**: Indifference between a stranger and the mother could suggest disorganized attachment, not anxious-avoidant.  
- **G**: Extreme distress and clinging are characteristic of anxious-ambivalent attachment.  
- **H**: A child who is very distressed but pulls away upon return may fit the disorganized type, not anxious-avoidant.  
- **I**: Indifference to the mother’s presence or absence is not consistent with anxious-avoidant attachment.  
- **J**: Seeking comfort from a stranger does not align with the avoidant pattern, where the child avoids seeking comfort altogether.  

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it accurately reflects the behaviors associated with an anxious-avoidant attachment pattern.
