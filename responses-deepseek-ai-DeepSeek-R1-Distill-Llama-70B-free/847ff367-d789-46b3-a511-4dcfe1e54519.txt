Question:

What about asteroids makes them stand out in sky surveys searching for them?

Options:

A: They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars
B: Asteroids rotate at a high speed, making them stand out
C: Asteroids are larger than most celestial bodies, hence easier to spot
D: Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars
E: Asteroids have a distinct color that makes them stand out
F: Asteroids emit a lot of their own radiation
G: They emit a high amount of heat, making them detectable
H: They emit a unique sound frequency that can be detected
I: Asteroids emit pulsed radiation

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what makes asteroids stand out in sky surveys. Hmm, I remember that sky surveys are used to detect various celestial objects, and asteroids are one of them. But what's unique about asteroids that makes them noticeable?

Let me think about the options provided. Option A says they reflect enough sunlight to be brighter than background stars. That makes sense because I know asteroids are rocky bodies that reflect sunlight, so they might appear bright. But wait, aren't stars also bright? Maybe it's not just brightness.

Option B mentions high rotation speed. I'm not sure how rotation would make them stand out in surveys. Maybe if they spin fast, they might have a different shape or brightness variation, but I don't think that's the main reason they're detected.

Option C states they're larger than most celestial bodies. That doesn't seem right because asteroids vary in size, and many are actually quite small. Plus, other objects like planets and stars are larger.

Option D says they have substantial motion relative to background stars. Oh, right! I remember that asteroids are much closer to us and are in orbit around the Sun, so they move faster across the sky compared to distant stars. This motion causes them to appear as moving points in images taken over time, making them stand out when comparing multiple observations.

Option E suggests a distinct color. I think asteroids might have different spectral signatures, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason they're spotted in surveys. Surveys might use filters, but movement is probably more noticeable.

Option F, emitting their own radiation â€” that doesn't sound right. Asteroids are mostly rocky and don't emit much radiation on their own; they reflect sunlight.

Option G, emitting a lot of heat. Asteroids do emit some infrared radiation, but I don't think that's the main method used in optical sky surveys. Maybe for infrared surveys, but not the typical ones.

Option H, unique sound frequency. That doesn't make sense; sound doesn't travel in space, so we wouldn't detect that from Earth-based surveys.

Option I, pulsed radiation. I'm not aware of asteroids emitting pulsed radiation. That's more of a characteristic of objects like pulsars.

Putting it all together, the key factor is their motion. Because they're orbiting the Sun and are relatively close, their position changes more noticeably over time compared to distant stars. So when astronomers take multiple images of the same area, the moving objects (like asteroids) become apparent because they change position, while the stars remain in the same spot relative to each other.

So the correct answer should be D: They have substantial motion relative to the background stars.

The key factor that makes asteroids stand out in sky surveys is their substantial motion relative to the background stars. Asteroids are in orbit around the Sun and are much closer to Earth than most stars, causing them to move more noticeably across the sky over time. This movement allows them to be identified as moving points in images taken during different observations, distinguishing them from stationary background stars. 

Answer: D
