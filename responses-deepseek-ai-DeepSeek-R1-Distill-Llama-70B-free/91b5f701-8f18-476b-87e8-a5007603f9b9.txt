Okay, so I have this question about a Chinese technique used in construction, specifically involving stamped or pounded earth. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I'll read the question again: "What was the Chinese technique of stamped or pounded earth that was used in construction of house walls and defensive structures?" The options are A to J, each with different terms.

I remember learning that in ancient China, especially during the Qin Dynasty, they used a method where they compacted earth to build structures. The walls were made by pounding the earth to make it hard and durable. This technique allowed for strong walls without using bricks, which might not have been as common back then.

Looking at the options, option B is Qin manufacture. Qin relates to the Qin Dynasty, which I associate with the Terracotta Army and the Great Wall. But wait, the Great Wall's construction involved more than just rammed earth, right? Or was it that the Qin used this technique for their structures?

Option D is Lung-shan. I think Lung-shan is related to a type of pottery, maybe from the Neolithic period. Lung-shan culture might have been known for black pottery, but I'm not sure how that ties into construction techniques.

Option G is Hang-t'u. Hang-t'u sounds familiar. I think it's another term for "rammed earth." I've heard that Hang-t'u refers to the pounded earth method. So the walls were built by pounding the earth into molds, layer by layer, creating a solid structure.

Option B, Qin manufacture, might refer to the manufacturing techniques of the Qin, which could include the Terracotta Army, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the earth construction method.

Wait, another thought: the Great Wall's construction in the Qin Dynasty used rammed earth along with other materials. But the question is about the technique, not specifically the Great Wall.

So between B and G. I think Hang-t'u is the correct term for the technique. So G would be the answer.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the terms. Let me think again. Maybe the Qin used a specific method called something else. But I'm pretty sure Hang-t'u is the term for rammed earth in Chinese. So the answer should be G.

The Chinese technique of stamped or pounded earth used in construction is known as "Hang-t'u." This method involved compacting layers of earth to create durable walls for both houses and defensive structures. While the Qin Dynasty is famous for its Terracotta Army and contributions to the Great Wall, the term "Hang-t'u" specifically refers to the rammed earth technique. Therefore, the correct answer is G.
