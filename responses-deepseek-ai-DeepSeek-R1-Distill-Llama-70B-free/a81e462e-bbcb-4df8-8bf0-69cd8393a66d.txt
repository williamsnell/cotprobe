Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

James and Ramon are on a frozen pond, right? They're 20 meters apart. There's a mug midway between them, so that's at 10 meters from each. They're pulling on a rope that's stretched between them. The question is, when James has moved 6 meters toward the mug, how far has Ramon moved?

Hmm, I think I remember something about this from class. When two people pull on a rope, if they move towards each other, the total distance between them decreases. But wait, since they're on ice, which is frictionless, their center of mass might stay the same. Oh, right! The center of mass doesn’t change because there's no external force acting on the system. So whatever movement they make, the center of mass stays in the same spot.

Initially, the mug is right in the center, so the center of mass must be there too. Wait, but James is heavier than Ramon. Oh wait, no, the center of mass's position depends on their masses. Let me think about that.

The initial setup: James (90 kg) is at position 0, Ramon (60 kg) is at position 20 m. The mug is at 10 m, but that's just the midpoint. The center of mass isn't necessarily at the midpoint unless their masses are equal.

So the initial center of mass (Xcm) can be calculated using the formula:

Xcm = (m_James * x_James + m_Ramon * x_Ramon) / (m_James + m_Ramon)

Plugging in the values:

Xcm = (90 * 0 + 60 * 20) / (90 + 60)

That's (0 + 1200) / 150 = 1200 / 150 = 8 meters from James' initial position. So the center of mass is at 8 meters from James, which would be at 12 meters from Ramon (since the total is 20 m). So the mug is at 10 m, not at the center of mass.

Wait, but the mug is midway. So the system's center of mass isn't at the mug initially. But when they move, the center of mass doesn't change because there's no external force.

So after they move, the center of mass must still be at 8 meters from James's original position (or 12 meters from Ramon's original position).

Now, James has moved 6 meters towards the mug. Since he was at 0, moving 6 m towards the mug (which is at 10 m) puts him at position 6 m.

Let me denote James's new position as x_J and Ramon's new position as x_R.

The total distance between them must have changed because they moved towards each other. Wait, but the center of mass is fixed.

So the new positions must satisfy:

Xcm = (m_J * x_J + m_R * x_R) / (m_J + m_R) ) = 8 m.

We know that James is now at 6 m. So:

(90 * 6 + 60 * x_R) / 150 = 8

Let me compute that.

Multiply both sides by 150:

90*6 + 60 x_R = 1200

90*6 is 540.

So 540 + 60 x_R = 1200.

Subtract 540: 60 x_R = 660.

Divide by 60: x_R = 11 meters.

Wait, so Ramon is now at 11 meters. But initially, he was at 20 m. So how far has he moved?

He was at 20 m, now at 11 m. That's a movement of 20 -11 =9 meters towards the center? Wait, but wait. If the mug is at 10 m, and Ramon was at 20, moving to 11 would be moving 9 meters towards the mug. That seems a lot.

But let's double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, James was at 0, moved 6 m, so x_J =6. Ramon's new position is x_R. The center of mass is still at 8 m.

So (90*6 + 60*x_R) / 150 =8.

Yes, that's (540 +60 x_R) = 1200.

So 60 x_R=660 → x_R=11.

So Ramon is at 11 m. Since he was at 20 m, he moved 9 m towards the mug. So the answer would be 9 m, which is option F.

Wait, but the options given are A to J, and option F is 9. So the answer should be F.

But wait, another way to think about this. Since the center of mass doesn't move, the displacement of James and Ramon must be such that the weighted average stays the same.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the movement based on their masses. Because James is heavier, he moves less, and Ramon moves more. Wait, but in this case, James moved 6 m towards the mug, which is a significant distance. So perhaps Ramon moved more than 6 m.

Wait, but according to the calculation, he moved 9 m. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the system's movement in terms of their masses. Let me think differently.

The distance between them was initially 20 m. After moving, the distance would be (x_R - x_J). But since the center of mass hasn't moved, perhaps the way to find each movement is through their mass ratio.

Wait, the mass ratio is 90:60, which is 3:2. So for every meter Ramon moves, James moves 2/3 of that. Wait, because when James pulls, Ramon moves more because he's lighter. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Because when two people pull on a rope, the heavier one accelerates less. So if they start pulling, the heavier person (James) will move slower, and Ramon will move more. So the distance each moves would be inversely proportional to their masses.

Wait, but when they pull on the rope, the rope applies a tension force on each, and according to Newton's third law, the forces are equal and opposite. So the accelerations would be different because F=ma. So a_J = F/m_J, a_R = F/m_R. So since James is heavier, his acceleration is smaller. Therefore, in the same time, Ramon moves more distance than James.

But in this problem, James has moved 6 m. So how much has Ramon moved?

If the ratio of their accelerations is m_R : m_J (since a is inversely proportional to mass), then the ratio of distances would be the same as the ratio of their accelerations multiplied by the square of time (since distance is 0.5 a t²). So the distances would be in the ratio of a_J : a_R. Wait, no, because the time is same, so the distances would be proportional to a_J and a_R. Since a_J = F/m_J, a_R = F/m_R.

So the ratio of distances would be (F/m_J) * t² : (F/m_R) * t² → m_R : m_J.

Wait, because if a_J = F/m_J, then distance d_J = 0.5 a_J t² = 0.5 (F/m_J) t². Similarly, d_R = 0.5 (F/m_R) t². So the ratio d_J : d_R = (1/m_J) : (1/m_R) ) → d_J/d_R = m_R/m_J.

So m_R is 60, m_J is 90. So d_J/d_R = 60/90 = 2/3 → d_J = (2/3) d_R. So if James moved 6 m, then 6 = (2/3) d_R → d_R = 6*(3/2) =9 m.

Which matches the earlier calculation. So Ramon has moved 9 meters towards the mug. Therefore, the correct answer is F:9.0.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using the concept of the center of mass, which remains stationary in the absence of external forces. Initially, James (90.0 kg) is at position 0 m, Ramon (60.0 kg) is at position 20.0 m, and the mug is midway at 10.0 m. The center of mass of the system is calculated as:

\[
x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_{\text{James}} \cdot x_{\text{James}} + m_{\text{Ramon}} \cdot x_{\text{Ramon}}}{m_{\text{James}} + m_{\text{Ramon}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{90 \cdot 0 + 60 \cdot 20}{90 + 60} = \frac{1200}{150} = 8.0 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the center of mass is 8.0 m from James' initial position (or 12.0 m from Ramon's initial position). After James moves 6.0 m toward the mug, his new position is \(x_{\text{James}} = 6.0 \, \text{m}\). Let Ramon's new position be \(x_{\text{Ramon}}\). The center of mass remains unchanged, so:

\[
x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_{\text{James}} \cdot x_{\text{James}} + m_{\text{Ramon}} \cdot x_{\text{Ramon}}}{m_{\text{James}} + m_{\text{Ramon}}}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
8.0 = \frac{90 \cdot 6.0 + 60 \cdot x_{\text{Ramon}}}{150}.
\]

Multiplying through by 150:

\[
1200 = 540 + 60 \cdot x_{\text{Ramon}}.
\]

Solving for \(x_{\text{Ramon}}\):

\[
60 \cdot x_{\text{Ramon}} = 660 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{\text{Ramon}} = 11.0 \, \text{m}.
\]

Ramon was initially at 20.0 m, so the distance he has moved is:

\[
20.0 - 11.0 = 9.0 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, Ramon has moved 9.0 m toward the mug. The correct answer is:

**F: 9.0**
