Okay, so I've got this problem about B Corporation's total profit function, and I need to find the marginal profit and determine the output quantities. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the total profit function is given as π = - $3,000 - $2,400 Q + $350 Q² - $8.333 Q³. Wait, I think I remember that marginal profit is the derivative of the total profit function with respect to Q. Oh right, because profit is a function of output Q, so taking the derivative gives the marginal profit, which is the additional profit from producing one more unit.

So to find the marginal profit (MP), I need to take dπ/dQ. Let me compute that. The derivative of a function aQ³ + bQ² + cQ + d is 3aQ² + 2bQ + c. Applying that here:

The function is π = -3000 -2400 Q + 350 Q² -8.333 Q³. Wait, I should write it in standard form: π = -8.333 Q³ + 350 Q² -2400 Q -3000.

So taking the derivative term by term:

dπ/dQ = 3*(-8.333) Q² + 2*(350) Q + (-2400).

Let me compute each coefficient:

3 * (-8.333) = -25, because 8.333 is approximately 25/3. So 3*(25/3) is 25, but with the negative, so -25.

2*350 = 700.

So the MP function is MP = -25 Q² + 700 Q - 2400.

Wait, but the question is part a) asking for the marginal profit. Wait, no, part a) is to compute the marginal profit, which is the function MP(Q) as I derived. But part b) is to determine its output quantities. Oh, wait, wait, output quantities when? Oh, probably when marginal profit is zero, because that's where profit is maximized or minimized. So marginal profit equals zero would give the critical points, which could be maximum or minimum.

Wait, but the question says "determine its output quantities". Hmm, perhaps it's asking for the quantity where marginal profit is zero, which would be the profit-maximizing quantity if it's a maximum. Or maybe it's asking for when the marginal profit equals average profit or something else. Wait, but the question isn't entirely clear. Let me read it again.

The question says, "a) Compute the marginal profit b) Determine its output quantities." So part a is to find MP, which is the function, and part b is to find the output Q where perhaps MP equals zero, or maybe where MP is at a certain value, but the question isn't explicit. Wait, but the options are pairs of numbers, like 22 and 7, etc. So perhaps part a is asking for the MP function, but maybe the MP at a certain Q, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps part b is asking for the profit-maximizing quantity.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps part a is to compute marginal profit as a function, and part b is to find the output level where profit is maximized, which would be where the derivative (marginal profit) is zero.

So first, part a: compute marginal profit. So the MP is -25 Q² +700 Q -2400.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects just the expression, but in the options, the answers are numbers, so perhaps part a is to find the marginal profit at a certain Q, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the marginal profit equation and then finding the quantity where MP is zero, which would give the optimal Q.

Wait, the options are given as two numbers, like 22 and 7. So perhaps part a is the MP function's coefficients, but that doesn't fit with the options given. Alternatively, maybe part a is the value of MP at a particular Q, but without more context, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute the marginal profit function (which I did as MP = -25 Q² +700 Q -2400), and then for part b, find the quantity where marginal profit is zero, which would be the Q that maximizes total profit.

So let's proceed under that assumption.

So for part b, set MP equal to zero and solve for Q.

So:

-25 Q² +700 Q -2400 = 0.

Let me write that equation:

25 Q² -700 Q +2400 = 0. (I multiplied both sides by -1 to make it positive, which makes it easier to solve.)

Now, this is a quadratic equation in Q. Let's try to solve it using the quadratic formula.

The standard quadratic equation is a Q² + b Q + c = 0.

So here, a =25, b= -700, c=2400.

Wait, no, because when I multiplied by -1, the equation becomes 25 Q² -700 Q +2400 =0, so a=25, b=-700, c=2400.

Wait, no: Wait, if I have -25 Q² +700 Q -2400 =0, then I can multiply both sides by -1 to get 25 Q² -700 Q +2400 =0. So a=25, b=-700, c=2400.

The quadratic formula is Q = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Plugging in the values:

b² = (-700)^2 = 490000.

4ac =4 *25 *2400= 100 *2400=240,000.

So discriminant D = 490000 -240000 = 250000.

Square root of D is sqrt(250000) = 500.

So Q = [700 ±500]/(2*25).

Compute numerator:

First possibility: 700 +500=1200. So 1200/(50)=24.

Second possibility:700-500=200. 200/(50)=4.

So the solutions are Q=24 and Q=4.

Hmm, so the critical points are at Q=4 and Q=24 units.

But wait, in a cubic profit function, the firm's profit would have a maximum and a minimum, but in reality, the firm would choose the maximum point where the slope changes from positive to negative. So I think Q=24 is the profit-maximizing quantity, and Q=4 might be a minimum or another point.

Wait, but let me think again. The total profit function is a cubic equation. Taking the derivative gives a quadratic. So the profit function could have a local maximum and a local minimum. To determine which one is which, I can take the second derivative and check concavity.

The second derivative of π would be the derivative of MP, which is d²π/dQ² = -50 Q +700.

At Q=4: second derivative is -50*4 +700 = -200 +700=500, which is positive. So that's a local minimum.

At Q=24: second derivative is -50*24 +700= -1200 +700= -500, which is negative, indicating a local maximum. So the profit is maximized at Q=24 units.

So the output quantity that maximizes profit is 24 units.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 24 and 4 units. So for part b, the output quantities are 24 and 4 units, but since 24 is the maximum, perhaps the question is asking for both critical points, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question says part b is to "determine its output quantities." So perhaps it's referring to the two points where marginal profit is zero. So the two quantities are 24 and 4 units.

So looking at the options, option E is 24 and 4 units.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Let me double-check the quadratic solution.

The equation was 25 Q² -700 Q +2400=0.

Using the quadratic formula: Q = [700 ± sqrt(700² -4*25*2400)]/(2*25).

700² is 490000.

4*25*2400 = 100*2400=240000.

So sqrt(490000-240000)=sqrt(250000)=500.

So Q=(700 ±500)/50.

So 700+500=1200, 1200/50=24.

700-500=200, 200/50=4. Yep, that's correct.

So the two output quantities where marginal profit is zero are 24 and 4 units.

So for part a, the marginal profit function is MP = -25 Q² +700 Q -2400.

But looking at the options, the answers are numerical. So perhaps the question is asking for the marginal profit at a specific Q value, but the question doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps part a is to compute the MP function, but the options don't include functions. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the problem says "a) Compute the marginal profit b) Determine its output quantities." So part a) is to compute the MP function, which I have as MP = -25 Q² +700 Q -2400.

But then part b) is to find the output quantities, which are Q=24 and Q=4.

Looking at the options, option E is 24 and 4 units.

So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but let me check the options again to make sure.

Options:

A:22 and7

B:21 and8

C:23 and6

D:26 and2

E:24 and4

F:25 and3

G:20 and5

H:27 and1

I:18 and10

J:19 and9

Yes, E is 24 and 4, which matches what I found.

So I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start with the total profit function for B Corporation:

\[
\pi = -3000 - 2400Q + 350Q^2 - 8.333Q^3
\]

### Part (a): Compute the Marginal Profit
The marginal profit (MP) is the first derivative of the total profit function with respect to \( Q \). Taking the derivative:

\[
MP = \frac{d\pi}{dQ} = -25Q^2 + 700Q - 2400
\]

Thus, the marginal profit function is:

\[
MP = -25Q^2 + 700Q - 2400
\]

### Part (b): Determine the Output Quantities
To find the output quantities, we set the marginal profit equal to zero and solve for \( Q \):

\[
-25Q^2 + 700Q - 2400 = 0
\]

Dividing through by \(-25\):

\[
Q^2 - 28Q + 96 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
Q = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -28 \), and \( c = 96 \). Substituting these values:

\[
Q = \frac{28 \pm \sqrt{784 - 384}}{2} = \frac{28 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2} = \frac{28 \pm 20}{2}
\]

This gives two solutions:

\[
Q = \frac{28 + 20}{2} = 24 \quad \text{and} \quad Q = \frac{28 - 20}{2} = 4
\]

Thus, the output quantities where marginal profit is zero are \( Q = 24 \) and \( Q = 4 \).

### Final Answer
The marginal profit function is \( MP = -25Q^2 + 700Q - 2400 \), and the output quantities where marginal profit is zero are \( Q = 24 \) and \( Q = 4 \). Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: 24 and 4 units**
