Okay, I've got this insurance question to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about Mr. Griffin's car insurance cost based on certain factors. Hmm, I remember that insurance rates can depend on several variables like age, territory, coverage limits, and accident history.

First, let's look at the details provided. Mr. Griffin is 22 years old and single. His car is used strictly for pleasure, which probably means he doesn't commute or drive for work, so maybe lower mileage or less risk. His coverage is 25-and-50 bodily injury liability and $10,000 property damage. He lives in 04 territory and has had no accidents.

Wait, I think the numbers 25-and-50 refer to the liability coverage. So 25/50 would mean $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident for bodily injury. And $10k for property damage. So his coverage levels are 25/50/10.

Now, the territory is 04. I'm not exactly sure how territories are rated, but I remember that different areas have different base rates. Maybe 04 is a lower-risk area, so cheaper premiums. Also, no accidents mean he's probably eligible for a good driver discount or lower rates because of a clean record.

Age is a big factor too. At 22, he's considered young, so his premiums might be higher than someone older, like in their 30s or 40s. But since he's single and not married, maybe there's no discount for marital status, but I'm not sure if that affects it much.

I think the next step is to figure out how the base rate is calculated. Maybe each component of the coverage has a certain cost. Let's say the base rate for 25/50/10 in territory 04 is a certain amount. Then, we apply any discounts or multipliers based on age and accident history.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact multipliers. I remember that younger drivers, especially under 25, might have higher rates. So at 22, Mr. Griffin might be subject to a higher multiplier. But since he's had no accidents, perhaps that brings the cost down a bit.

I'm trying to recall if there's a standard formula or if this is something I need to piece together. Maybe in this problem, the base rate is determined by territory and coverage, and then multiplied by an age factor. Let's say the base rate is $X, and then multiplied by, say, 1.5 for being under 25. But since he's 22, maybe the multiplier is higher or lower?

Alternatively, perhaps each territory has a specific rate. For example, territory 04 might have a base rate of, say, $100. Then, for each coverage level, there might be add-ons or multipliers. But I'm not sure without more data.

Wait, looking at the answer options, the choices are all between $37 and $210. So the correct answer is probably somewhere in the middle range. Let's see, option C is $183.30, E is $210.75, which are higher. Options like B, F, J are around $100 to $150.

Since he's young, maybe the cost is higher. But without knowing the exact rate structure, it's a bit tricky. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the base rate is $125.50 (option F) for someone over 25 in territory 04. Then, for being under 25, there's an additional 50% added, making it around $188.25, which is close to option C's $183.30. Or maybe a different multiplier.

Alternatively, maybe the base rate is $78 (option H) for someone with his profile except age. Then, for being 22, they add a certain amount. $78 plus, say, $55, gets to $133, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. I've heard that in some rating systems, the age factor is applied as a multiplier. For example, a 22-year-old might have a 1.5x multiplier on the base rate. If the base rate for his coverage in territory 04 is, say, $120, then 1.5 times that would be $180, which is close to option C's $183.30. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Another angle: maybe the coverage levels affect the rate. 25/50/10 is lower than higher coverage, so the premium should be lower than someone with higher limits. But then, being young could increase it.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects you to know that territory 04 has a certain base rate, and then apply the age factor. Let's say the base rate for someone over 25 in territory 04 with 25/50/10 is $125.50 (option F). Then, for each year under 25, there's a surcharge. So for a 22-year-old, that's 3 years under. If each year adds, say, $15, that would add $45, making it $170.50, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe a flat multiplier. If under 25 adds 50%, then 125.50 * 1.5 is $188.25, which is near option C's $183.30.

Alternatively, maybe the base rate is $78 (option H) for a 30-year-old, and for 22, you add a young driver fee. Maybe $78 plus $100, which would be $178, again near option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done as: territory 04 rate is $58.60 (option G) for the base. Then, add for coverage. Wait, that might not make sense because the coverage is 25/50/10, which should be a standard part of the policy.

Alternatively, maybe each part of the coverage has a cost. For example, 25/50 BI might be a certain amount, and $10k property damage another. Let's say 25/50 is $100, and $10k is $20, totaling $120. Then, territory 04 might add a surcharge or have a multiplier. If territory 04 is 1.2 times the base, then 120*1.2= $144. Then, age factor: 22 is young, so maybe 1.5 times, leading to 144*1.5= $216, which is near option E's $210.75.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the territory 04 has a lower rate. Maybe the base rate is $78, and for age 22, it's doubled, making $156, which would be near option J's $150.20. But that's speculative.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is $183.30, which is one of the higher options. If the calculation leads to around $180, then option C is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another way: if the base rate without considering age is $120, and the age factor is 1.5, then 120*1.5=180. Adding maybe a small fee, it could reach $183.30, which is option C. That seems plausible.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C, $183.30.

To determine the cost of Mr. Griffin's insurance coverage, we analyze the factors provided:

1. **Coverage Limits**: Mr. Griffin has 25/50/10 coverage, meaning $25,000 bodily injury liability per person, $50,000 per accident, and $10,000 property damage liability. This is a standard coverage level.

2. **Territory**: He resides in territory 04, which likely has a specific base rate for insurance premiums. Territory ratings can significantly impact costs, with lower-risk areas typically having lower premiums.

3. **Age**: At 22 years old, Mr. Griffin is considered a young driver. Young drivers often face higher premiums due to increased risk, and a multiplier or surcharge may apply to the base rate.

4. **Accident History**: Having no accidents suggests Mr. Griffin qualifies for a clean driving record discount, which could lower the premium.

Given the options provided, we estimate the base rate for his coverage in territory 04 and apply an age-based multiplier. Assuming the base rate for a driver over 25 is around $120, a 1.5x multiplier for being under 25 would result in approximately $180. Adding minor adjustments, the total cost aligns closely with option C, $183.30.

Thus, the most reasonable answer is:

**C: $183.30**
