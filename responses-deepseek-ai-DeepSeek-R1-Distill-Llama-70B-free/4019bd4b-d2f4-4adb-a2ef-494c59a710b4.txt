Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Michael Walzer's views on responding to terrorism. I remember that Walzer is a political philosopher who has written about just war theory and ethics in warfare. The question is asking what Walzer considers particularly important when responding to terrorism.

The question is: "In responding to terrorism, says Walzer, it is particularly important that..." and then there are ten options from A to J.

I think I should start by recalling what I know about Walzer's arguments. I remember that he discusses the moral implications of war and the treatment of combatants versus non-combatants. In the context of terrorism, Walzer has some specific ideas about how states should respond without compromising their own moral standards.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: "we isolate the terrorists and cut off their resources." That sounds practical, but I'm not sure if that's what Walzer emphasizes. I think cutting off resources is a common strategy but not necessarily the key point he makes about the moral response.

Option B: "we focus on increasing security measures rather than retaliation." Security measures are important, but again, I don't recall this being the main point Walzer stresses in his ethical arguments about terrorism.

Option C: "we use the same tactics as terrorists to understand their methods." This seems problematic because using the same tactics would likely involve unethical methods, which I don't think Walzer would support. He's more about maintaining moral standards.

Option D: "we attack the lower-ranking terrorists first." I don't remember Walzer discussing hierarchy in terrorist organizations as a focal point in his arguments. It seems more tactical than ethical.

Option E: "we take immediate military action against the terrorists." Military action is a response, but Walzer might argue against hasty or disproportionate actions. He probably emphasizes ethical constraints even in military responses.

Option F: "we make an effort to convince the terrorists that they are acting wrongly." While this could be part of a strategy, I don't think it's the primary concern Walzer highlights. He might focus more on the moral conduct of the state's response rather than persuading terrorists.

Option G: "we publicly condemn the terrorists' actions." Public condemnation is important, but I'm not sure it's the key point Walzer makes about how to respond ethically. It's more about communication than the ethical approach to countering terrorism.

Option H: "we avoid harming terrorists to the same extent that we would avoid harming innocent civilians." Wait, that doesn't make sense. Innocent civilians should be protected, but terrorists are combatants. Maybe the point is about not targeting non-combatants, but I'm not sure this is the right way to phrase it.

Option I: "we negotiate with the terrorists to reach a peaceful resolution." Negotiation is a possible approach, but I think Walzer is more concerned with the moral limits on how we fight rather than the method of negotiation.

Option J: "we do not repeat the wrongs of terrorism in the process." This sounds familiar. I think Walzer argues that in responding to terrorism, it's crucial that states do not adopt the same immoral tactics as the terrorists. He emphasizes maintaining moral integrity and upholding ethical standards even in the face of such threats. So the state should not engage in terrorism itself or violate human rights in its response.

Putting it all together, the correct answer is probably J. Walzer's point is about not mirroring the unethical actions of terrorists and ensuring that the response remains morally justifiable.

The correct answer is J. Walzer emphasizes the importance of maintaining moral standards and not resorting to the same unethical tactics as terrorists. The state's response must uphold ethical integrity and avoid repeating the wrongs of terrorism.

Answer: J
