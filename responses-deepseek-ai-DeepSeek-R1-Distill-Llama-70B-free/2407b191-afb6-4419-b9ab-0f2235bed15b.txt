Okay, so I have this physics problem here about blackbody radiation and lightbulbs. Hmm, I remember that blackbody radiation relates to the spectrum of light emitted by objects at different temperatures. The question is about finding the temperature when the maximum wavelength emitted is 550 nm. I think I need to use Wien's Law for this.

Wait, Wien's Law says that the product of the temperature (in Kelvin) and the wavelength of maximum emission (in meters) is a constant. Oh right, the formula is λ_max * T = b, where b is Wien's displacement constant. I think the value of b is approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K.

So the given λ_max is 550 nm, but I need to convert that into meters. Oh yeah, 1 nanometer is 1e-9 meters. So 550 nm is 550e-9 meters. Let me write that down: 550e-9 m.

Now, rearranging Wien's Law to solve for temperature: T = b / λ_max. Plugging in the numbers, T would be (2.898e-3 m·K) divided by 550e-9 m.

Let me compute that. Let's first write 2.898e-3 divided by 550e-9. Wait, 550e-9 is the same as 5.5e-7 meters. So 2.898e-3 divided by 5.5e-7. Let me do the math.

Hmm, dividing 2.898e-3 by 5.5e-7. Maybe I can simplify this. Let's see, 2.898e-3 is 2,898e-6, and 5.5e-7 is 0.55e-6. So 2,898e-6 divided by 0.55e-6. The e-6 cancels out, so it's 2898 / 0.55.

Calculating 2898 divided by 0.55. Well, 0.55 times 5000 is 2750. Because 5000 * 0.5 is 2500, and 5000 * 0.05 is 250; 2500+250=2750. Wait, 2750 is less than 2898. The difference is 2898-2750=148.

Now, 0.55 times 269 ≈ 148? Let's check: 0.55 * 269. 200 * 0.55 is 110. 69 * 0.55 is approximately 37.95. So 110 + 37.95 is 147.95, which is about 148. So 269 + 5000 is 5269 K? Wait wait, wait. Because 5000 gives 2750, and 269 gives 148, adding up to 2898. So 5269 K.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation because it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 2.898e-3 divided by 550e-9. Let me write it as (2.898 / 550) * (1e-3 / 1e-9) ) = (2.898/550) * 1e6.

Wait, 1e-3 is 1e-3, and 1e-9 is 1e-9. So 1e-3 / 1e-9 = 1e6. So this becomes (2.898 / 550) * 1e6. Let me compute 2.898 divided by 550.

Calculating 2.898 / 550. Well, 550 is 5.5e2. So 2.898 /5.5e2 = 2.898 / (5.5 * 100) ) = (2.898 / 5.5) * (1/100) ) = approximately 0.527 * 0.01 = 0.00527. Wait that can't be right because 5.5 * 0.527 is about 2.8985. So yeah, 2.898/5.5 is approximately 0.527.

So 0.527 multiplied by 1e6 (because we have 1e6 from earlier). So 0.527e6 K is 527,000 K? That can't be right. Wait that doesn't make sense because the options are all around 5000 K.

Wait wait, I think I messed up the exponent. Let me try again.

Wait, 1e-3 divided by 1e-9 is 1e6? Because 1e-9 is 0.000000001, and 1e-3 is 0.001. So 0.001 / 0.000000001 is 1e6. Yeah that's correct.

So 2.898e-3 = 0.002898 meters.

Wait maybe I should compute it in a different way. Let me write it as (2.898 × 10^-3) / (550 × 10^-9) ) = (2.898 / 550) × (10^-3 / 10^-9) ) = (2.898/550) × 1e6. So yes, same as before.

So 2.898 divided by 550. Let's calculate that: 550 * 5 = 2750, which is larger than 2898? No wait, 2.898 is less than 550. Oh wait no, wait 2.898 is less than 550. No, 2.898 is about 2.9, and 550 is 550, so 2.9 / 550 is approximately 0.00527, as I did before.

Wait then, 0.00527 multiplied by 1e6 is 5270 K. Oh! Because 0.00527 times a million is 5270. So around 5270 K.

Looking at the options, option B is 5300 K, option A is 4500, C is 4800, D is 6000. So 5270 is closest to 5300 K. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, let me use more precise calculation. 2.898 / 550.

Calculating 2.898 / 550:

550 * 0.005 = 2.75. So 0.005 gives 2.75. The difference is 2.898 - 2.75 = 0.148.

Now, 0.148 / 550 = approximately 0.000269. So total is 0.005 + 0.000269 = 0.005269.

Multiply by 1e6 gives 0.005269 * 1e6 = 5269 K, which is approximately 5270 K. So the closest option is B: 5300 K.

To determine the temperature corresponding to a maximum wavelength of $\lambda_{\max} = 550 \, \text{nm}$, we use **Wien's Law**, which states:

\[
\lambda_{\max} \cdot T = b
\]

where $b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}$ is Wien's displacement constant. Rearranging for $T$:

\[
T = \frac{b}{\lambda_{\max}}
\]

The given wavelength $\lambda_{\max} = 550 \, \text{nm}$ must be converted to meters:  
\[
\lambda_{\max} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 5.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{5.5 \times 10^{-7}}.
\]

Simplify the division:

\[
T = \frac{2.898}{5.5} \times 10^{6} \, \text{K}.
\]

First, calculate $\frac{2.898}{5.5}$:

\[
\frac{2.898}{5.5} \approx 0.527.
\]

Now multiply by $10^6$:

\[
T \approx 0.527 \times 10^6 = 5270 \, \text{K}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided:

- **A: 4500 K** — Too low.
- **B: 5300 K** — Closest to the calculated value of 5270 K.
- **C: 4800 K** — Too low.
- **D: 6000 K** — Too high.

Thus, the best match is **B: 5300 K**.

Answer: **B**
