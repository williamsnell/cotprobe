Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about convex lenses and image formation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says: A convex lens with a focal length of 0.2 meters is used to examine a small coin on a table. The lens is initially held 0.3 meters above the coin, then moved to 0.1 meters. I need to figure out what happens to the image of the coin during this movement.

Wait, I remember that convex lenses can form both real and virtual images, depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point. Let me think about the different cases.

First, when the object is placed beyond the focal length (u > f), the image is real, inverted, and smaller. When the object is between f and the lens (u < f), the image is virtual, upright, and larger. Oh right, and when the object is exactly at f, the image is at infinity.

But wait, in this problem, the lens is moving towards the object. So the distance between the lens and the object (u) is decreasing over time. Let me calculate u in each case.

Initially, the distance from the lens to the coin is 0.3 m. Since the focal length is 0.2 m, the initial u is 0.3 m, which is greater than f (0.2 m). So the image should be real, inverted, and smaller. The image distance v can be found using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

Let me compute v when u = 0.3. 1/0.2 = 1/0.3 + 1/v. So 5 = 3.333 + 1/v → 1/v = 1.666 → v ≈ 0.6 m. So the image is 0.6 m on the other side of the lens.

Now, the lens is moved closer, to 0.1 m above the coin. So now u is 0.1 m, which is less than f (0.2 m). So now the object is within the focal length. In this case, the image should be virtual, upright, and larger than the object. And the image distance, using the lens formula again: 1/0.2 = 1/0.1 + 1/v → 5 = 10 + 1/v → 1/v = -5 → v = -0.2 m. So the image is virtual, 0.2 m on the same side as the object.

Wait, but what happens when the lens is moved between these two positions? So when the lens starts at u=0.3 (image real, inverted, smaller), and then is moved closer until u=0.1 (image virtual, upright, larger).

But what about when u is exactly equal to f? Let's see, if u = f = 0.2 m, then 1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/0.2 = 1/0.2 +1/v → so 5 =5 +1/v → 1/v=0 → v is infinity. So when u approaches f from above, v approaches infinity, and when u is less than f, v becomes negative (virtual image).

So during the movement, the lens starts with u=0.3 (real image), moves to u=0.2 (image at infinity), and then to u=0.1 (virtual image). 

Wait, but in terms of image size, when u is greater than f, the image is smaller. As the object moves closer to f (u decreasing from 0.3 to 0.2), the image moves further away (v increases). So the image size would increase as u approaches f because the image distance is increasing. Oh wait, because for real images, as v increases, the size of the image (height) depends on the magnification m = v/u. So when u decreases and v increases, m increases, so the image becomes larger.

But wait, when u is greater than f, as u decreases (moving the object closer to the lens beyond f), the image moves further away, making the image larger. So initially, the image is real and small, then as the lens moves down, the real image becomes larger until the object reaches f. Then, when u becomes less than f, the image becomes virtual and upright.

Wait, but in the case of virtual images, the image is formed on the same side as the object. So when the lens moves from u=0.3 to u=0.1, the image transitions from real to virtual. So what happens to the size? Hmm.

When u is decreasing from 0.3 to 0.2, the image is real and moving away, getting larger. At u=0.2, the image is at infinity. Then, as u goes below 0.2 (e.g., u=0.15, 0.1), the image becomes virtual and the image distance v is negative, with v being |v|= (f*u)/(u-f). So when u is just below f, |v| is large, meaning the image is large. As u continues to decrease (moving closer to the lens), |v| becomes smaller. Wait, let me compute that.

For u = 0.15 m:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 5 = 6.6667 + 1/v → 1/v = 5 - 6.6667 = -1.6667 → v ≈ -0.6 m.

So the image is virtual, 0.6 m on the same side as the object. The magnification m is v/u = (-0.6)/0.15 = -4. So the image is 4 times larger than the object and upright (since m is positive because both u and v are negative? Wait, u is positive when the object is real, and v is negative for virtual images. So m would be negative, which implies inverted. Wait no, wait, the sign conventions might be tripping me up here.

Wait, in the standard convention, for a real object, u is positive. For a virtual image, v is negative. So the magnification m = -v/u. So for u=0.15, m = -(-0.6)/0.15 = 4. Positive, so upright.

Wait, so m is positive, meaning upright image. So when u=0.15, the image is virtual, upright, and larger than the object.

When u=0.1, v is -0.2 m. So m = -v/u = -(-0.2)/0.1 = 2. So the image is upright, virtual, and twice as large as the object.

Wait, but when u is 0.3 m, m = v/u = 0.6/0.3 = 2. So positive 2, which would mean upright, but wait, no. Wait, when the image is real, v is positive, and u is positive. So m = v/u = 0.6/0.3 = 2. So that would be an upright image? Wait, no, because for a convex lens, when the object is beyond f, the image is real and inverted. So perhaps I'm getting the sign wrong.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise sign conventions. In optics, the object distance u is positive when the object is real (on the same side as the incoming light). The image distance v is positive when the image is real (on the opposite side of the lens), and negative when virtual (same side as object).

The magnification m is given by m = -v/u.

So when u = 0.3 m, v = 0.6 m → m = -0.6/0.3 = -2. So the image is inverted (negative) and twice as large as the object.

Wait, but that's when u > f, so image real, inverted, and smaller? Wait earlier I thought the image was smaller, but the magnification here is -2, implying larger. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. When the object is beyond f, the image is real, inverted, and smaller. Or is it larger?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the cases. Let me recall:

For a convex lens:

- Object at u > 2f: image is real, inverted, smaller, between f and 2f on the other side.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get it right. When u > 2f, the image is real, inverted, and smaller, located between f and 2f.

When u is between f and 2f, image is real, inverted, and larger than the object, located beyond 2f.

Wait, wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because for u > f, as u increases, the image approaches f from the other side. Hmm, perhaps I should make a table.

Let me consider:

Case 1: u > 2f.

Using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v → v = 1/(1/f -1/u) = (f u)/(u - f).

If u is much larger than f, then v ≈ f + f^2/u. So as u increases, v approaches f from above. So the image is just beyond f, so image distance is just over f.

In terms of size, the magnification is m = v/u. So for u approaching infinity, m approaches f/u → 0. So image is smaller.

Case 2: u = 2f.

Then 1/f = 1/(2f) + 1/v → 1/v = 1/f - 1/(2f) = 1/(2f) → v = 2f. So image is at 2f, same as object. So image size is same as object.

Case3: f < u < 2f.

In this case, v will be greater than 2f, so image is real, beyond 2f. Magnification m = v/u. Since v > u (because u is less than 2f and v is greater than 2f), m is positive and greater than 1. Wait, but since for convex lens, when u is between f and 2f, the image is real, inverted, and larger. So m is negative because image is inverted. So m = -v/u will be negative, meaning inverted.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's take u=0.3 m, f=0.2 m. So u > f but less than 2f (which is 0.4 m). So in this case, image is real, inverted, and larger.

Wait, earlier when I calculated u=0.3 m, I found v=0.6 m. So the image is 0.6 m from the lens on the opposite side. So m = -0.6/0.3 = -2 → inverted and twice as large as the object. But wait, that would mean the image is larger, but I thought when u>2f, image is smaller. Oh, wait, no. When u is between f and 2f, the image is larger. When u is beyond 2f, image is smaller.

Wait, let me recheck. At u=0.3 m, which is greater than f=0.2 but less than 2f=0.4 m. So the image is real, inverted, and larger than the object. So the image is 0.6 m from the lens on the opposite side, so the size is twice as big.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the initial position is u=0.3 m. So the image is real, inverted, and larger.

Then, as the lens is moved closer, u decreases. Let's say it moves to u=0.25 m (still greater than f=0.2). Then v = (f u)/(u -f) = (0.2 * 0.25)/(0.25 - 0.2) = 0.05 / 0.05 = 1 m. So v=1 m, so m= -1/0.25 = -4. So image is inverted and 4 times larger.

Wait, but as u decreases towards f, v increases, so the image becomes larger. So when u approaches f from above, v approaches infinity. So the image becomes larger and larger as the lens approaches u=f.

Then, when u becomes less than f, say u=0.1 m, the image becomes virtual, upright, and with v = (f u)/(u -f). Wait, u=0.1, so u -f is negative. So v = (0.2 * 0.1)/(0.1 -0.2 )= 0.02 / (-0.1) = -0.2 m. So the image is virtual, 0.2 m on the same side as the object. The magnification is m = -v/u = -(-0.2)/0.1 = 2. So the image is upright and twice as large as the object.

Wait, but when u approaches f from below, what's the image size? For u approaching f from below, let's say u=0.19 m. Then v = (0.2 * 0.19)/(0.19 -0.2) = 0.038 / (-0.01) = -3.8 m. So the image is 3.8 m on the same side, which is a large image. So as u approaches f from below, the image distance |v| increases, making the image larger.

But as u continues to decrease below f, say u=0.1 m, v=-0.2 m. So the image is smaller than when u was 0.15 m, for example.

Wait, perhaps I should compute m for u=0.15 m. So u=0.15, v = (0.2 * 0.15)/(0.15 -0.2 )= 0.03 / (-0.05) = -0.6 m. So m = -v/u = 0.6/0.15 = 4. So the image is 4 times larger.

At u=0.1 m, m=2. So the image is 2 times larger.

So when the lens moves from u=0.3 m (m=-2 → inverted, 2x) to u=0.2 m (image at infinity, m approaches -infinity, image extremely large) and then to u=0.1 m (m=+2, upright, 2x larger).

Wait, but the initial image when u=0.3 is inverted and 2x larger. Then as the lens moves closer, when u approaches 0.2 m, the image becomes larger and larger (real image). At u=0.2, image at infinity. Then, as u goes below 0.2, the image becomes virtual, upright, and starts at a large size (like 4x when u=0.15) then reduces as u decreases further.

So during the movement, the image starts as real, inverted, 2x. Then as the lens moves closer, the real image becomes larger and larger until u=0.2, where the image is at infinity. Then, as the lens moves even closer, the image becomes virtual, upright, but initially very large (as u approaches f from below) and then becomes smaller as u decreases further.

Wait, so the image size would first increase (as u decreases from 0.3 to 0.2), then when u < 0.2, the image becomes virtual and its size changes. Wait no, when u < f, the image is virtual and on the same side, and as u decreases, the image size first becomes very large near u=f, then decreases as u moves further away (i.e., as u becomes smaller than f, moving towards zero).

So during the movement from u=0.3 to u=0.1, the image starts as real, inverted, and 2x. Then as u decreases to 0.2, the real image becomes larger, approaching infinity. Then, beyond u=0.2, the image becomes virtual, upright, and starts at a large size (as u approaches 0.2 from below), and then as u continues to decrease, the image size decreases.

Wait, so the image size would first increase (from 2x to infinity as u approaches 0.2 from above), then when u becomes less than 0.2, the image size starts at a large value and then decreases.

But in the problem, the lens is moved from u=0.3 to u=0.1, so passing through u=0.2. So what's the overall effect on the image size?

The image starts at 2x, then becomes larger, then at u=0.2, image at infinity (so extremely large). Then, as u goes below 0.2, the image becomes virtual and its size decreases from a very large value down to 2x at u=0.1.

Wait, so the image size increases until u=0.2, then decreases again.

But wait, when u is 0.3, image size is 2x. At u=0.25, image size is 4x. At u=0.2, image is infinitely large. Then, for u=0.15, image size is 4x, and at u=0.1, it's 2x. So the image size first increases (from 2x to infinity), then decreases (from infinity to 2x), but wait, no, because when u goes below 0.2, the image becomes virtual and the size starts at a high value and decreases as u decreases.

Wait, but when u=0.15, image size is 4x, and at u=0.1, it's 2x. So the image size is decreasing as u decreases below 0.2.

So when the lens moves from 0.3 m to 0.1 m, the image's size first increases (as u approaches 0.2 from above), then after u=0.2, the image becomes virtual and its size starts high and then decreases as u moves further down.

So overall, the image size increases to a point, then decreases. So the image gets bigger, then smaller. But wait, in the options, I need to see which option matches this behavior.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Image gets bigger at first, then smaller.

Option G: Continually increases.

Option H: Gets smaller first, then bigger.

Option J: Image becomes inverted and decreases in size.

Wait, but the image also changes from real to virtual, which involves a change in orientation. The real image is inverted, and the virtual image is upright. So the image flips.

So during the movement, the image starts as real (inverted), then
