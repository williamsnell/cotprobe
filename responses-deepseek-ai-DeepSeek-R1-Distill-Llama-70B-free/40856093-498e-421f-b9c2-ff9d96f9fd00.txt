Question:

A march was held to call attention to the fact that minorities are still disenfranchised from the electoral process. A congressional report revealed that in the certain parts of the country, only 42% of minorities eligible to vote were, in fact, registered. The report also indicated that certain states had residency laws restricting a person's right to vote. As a consequence, Congress enacted a statute that makes any law denying minorities the right to vote shall be deemed unconstitutional. This federal statute will most likely be upheld under which of the following constitutional provisions?

Options:

A: Twenty-sixth Amendment.
B: Tenth Amendment.
C: Eighth Amendment.
D: Seventeenth Amendment.
E: Twentieth Amendment.
F: Fourteenth Amendment.
G: Thirteenth Amendment.
H: Nineteenth Amendment.
I: First Amendment.
J: Fifteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I've got this constitutional law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a march that brought attention to minorities being disenfranchised from the electoral process. A congressional report found that only 42% of eligible minorities were registered in certain parts. Also, some states had residency laws that restricted voting rights. Congress then enacted a statute that says any law denying minorities the right to vote is unconstitutional. The question is, under which constitutional provision will this statute most likely be upheld?

The options are A through J, each a different amendment.

Hmm. I remember that the Constitution has several amendments related to voting rights. Let me think about each relevant one.

The Fifteenth Amendment comes to mind. I think it was about race and voting. Yes, the Fifteenth Amendment says that the right to vote cannot be denied based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It gives Congress the power to enforce this by legislation. So if states are passing laws that effectively disenfranchise minorities, Congress can step in under the Fifteenth Amendment.

Then there's the Fourteenth Amendment, which deals with equal protection under the law. It's broader and has been used in many cases, including voting rights. But the question specifically mentions minorities being disenfranchised, which points more to race.

The Nineteenth Amendment is about sex, ensuring women's suffrage. That's not directly relevant here.

The Twenty-sixth Amendment is about age, lowering the voting age to 18. Not the issue here.

The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery, but that's not directly tied to voting rights, though it's about civil rights in a broader sense.

The Seventeenth Amendment deals with the direct election of Senators. Not relevant.

The Eighth Amendment is about cruel and unusual punishment. No connection.

The Tenth Amendment is about states' rights, reserving powers not given to the federal government. If Congress is enacting this law, the Tenth Amendment might be a limit, but the question is about which provision upholds the law, not challenges it.

The First Amendment is about free speech, religion, etc. Not directly related to voting rights.

The Twentieth Amendment deals with the start of presidential and congressional terms. Not applicable.

So, putting it together, the statute is about preventing racial discrimination in voting. The Fifteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce this. Therefore, the statute would be upheld under the Fifteenth Amendment, which is option J.

The question concerns a federal statute enacted to prevent laws that deny minorities the right to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment explicitly prohibits denying the right to vote based on race, color, or previous servitude and grants Congress the authority to enforce this through legislation. This directly addresses the issue of racial disenfranchisement described in the scenario, making the Fifteenth Amendment the most relevant constitutional provision for upholding the statute.

The other amendments either address different aspects of voting rights (e.g., the Nineteenth for sex, the Twenty-sixth for age) or unrelated matters (e.g., the Eighth for punishment, the Tenth for states' rights). None of these are as directly applicable as the Fifteenth Amendment, which specifically targets racial discrimination in voting.

Answer: J
