Okay, so I've got this problem about a digital filter, and I'm supposed to find its poles. Hmm, I remember that digital filters can be either Finite Impulse Response (FIR) or Infinite Impulse Response (IIR). The equation given is y(n) = (1/3)(x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2)). Let me think—since the output y(n) depends only on the current and past inputs x(n), x(n-1), x(n-2), that sounds like an FIR filter because there's no feedback from past outputs. FIR filters typically have a finite duration impulse response, and their transfer functions have only zeros, no poles. Wait, no, wait. Or do they? I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, actually, I'm getting this wrong. Let's get back to the basics. The general form of a digital filter is given by the difference equation:

y(n) = b0 x(n) + b1 x(n-1) + ... + bM x(n-M) 
        - a1 y(n-1) - ... - aN y(n-N)

In this case, the equation is y(n) = (1/3)x(n) + (1/3)x(n-1) + (1/3)x(n-2). So there are no terms involving previous y(n) terms. That means a1, a2, etc., are all zero. So the denominator of the transfer function is just 1, right?

The transfer function H(z) is the Z-transform of the impulse response. For an FIR filter like this, the transfer function would be a polynomial in z^-1. Let me write it out.

H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^-1 + z^-2). So H(z) = (1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) / 3.

Wait, but when finding poles and zeros, we look at the transfer function in terms of z, not z^{-1}. So maybe I should rewrite it in terms of z.

H(z) = (1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) / 3 = [z^2 + z + 1 ] / (3 z^2 )

So, the numerator is z^2 + z + 1, and the denominator is 3z^2.

The zeros of H(z) are the roots of the numerator: solving z^2 + z + 1 =0. The poles are the roots of the denominator, which is 3z^2 = 0, so z=0 with multiplicity 2. So the poles are at z=0, double pole.

Wait, but the options given don't include 0 as a possible pole. Let me check the options. The options are A:1/2, B:3, C:-3, D:-2, E:0, F:-1, G:-1/2, H:1, I:1/3, J:2.

Oh wait, option E is 0. So that's one possibility. But wait, in the denominator, the roots are z=0, so those are the poles.

But wait, in digital signal processing, sometimes people prefer to represent the transfer function in terms of positive powers of z. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in rewriting.

Alternatively, the transfer function can be expressed as H(z) = (b0 + b1 z^{-1} + b2 z^{-2}) / (1 + a1 z^{-1} + ... ), but since there are no a terms, denominator is 1. So H(z) is a finite polynomial in z^{-1}.

So when finding the poles, we set the denominator equal to zero. But the denominator is 1, so 1=0? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no—I think I mixed up the form.

Wait, perhaps I should have written the transfer function in terms of z instead of z^{-1}. Let me think again.

The standard form is H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) = [b0 + b1 z^{-1} + b2 z^{-2} ] / [1 + a1 z^{-1} + a2 z^{-2} + ... ]

In our case, the denominator is just 1, since there are no a coefficients. So H(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2} )

To find the poles, we look for the roots of the denominator polynomial when the expression is written as a ratio of two polynomials in z. So, perhaps I should multiply numerator and denominator by z^2 to eliminate the negative exponents.

H(z) = [ (1/3)(z^2 + z + 1) ] / z^2.

So the denominator is z^2, so the roots are z=0, each with multiplicity 2. So the poles are at z=0, both of them.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E is 0. So the poles are at z=0, which is option E. So the answer would be E.

But wait, am I confusing zeros and poles? Let me double-check. The zeros are where the numerator is zero, so z^2 + z +1 =0. The roots are complex, at z = [ -1 ± sqrt(1-4) ] / 2, which are complex conjugates on the unit circle. But the question is about the poles. The denominator is z^2, so the poles are at z=0, each with multiplicity 2. So the poles are at 0, which is option E.

Wait, but the options could be a bit tricky. Let me check the question again. It says determine the pole(s) of the filter. So the filter has two poles at z=0. So the possible answers are E:0.

So the correct answer should be E.

The given digital filter is described by the equation:

\[
y(n) = \frac{1}{3} \left( x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2) \right),
\]

where \( y(n) \) and \( x(n) \) are the nth samples of the output and input signals, respectively. This is an FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter because the output depends only on the current and past input values, with no feedback from past outputs.

To analyze the poles of the filter, we consider the Z-transform of the filter's impulse response. The transfer function \( H(z) \) is given by:

\[
H(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2} \right).
\]

Rewriting this in terms of positive powers of \( z \), we multiply the numerator and denominator by \( z^2 \):

\[
H(z) = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \left( z^2 + z + 1 \right)}{z^2}.
\]

From this expression, the numerator is \( z^2 + z + 1 \), and the denominator is \( z^2 \). The poles of the filter are the roots of the denominator polynomial. Since the denominator is \( z^2 \), the roots are \( z = 0 \), each with multiplicity 2. Therefore, the filter has two poles located at \( z = 0 \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 0**
