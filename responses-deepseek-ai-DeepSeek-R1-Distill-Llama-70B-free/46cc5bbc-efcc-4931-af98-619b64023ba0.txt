Question:

A highway patrol officer stopped a driver for speeding and found that the person had a suspended license. He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?

Options:

A: Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.
B: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have the driver's consent to search the car.
C: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had the right to search the car for officer safety reasons.
D: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had a reasonable suspicion to search the car due to the driver's suspended license.
E: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the car after finding out about the suspended license.
F: No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.
G: Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.
H: Yes, the motion will be granted because the cocaine was found in a personal item, not in plain sight.
I: No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.
J: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have a warrant to search the jacket on the back seat.

Okay, so I have this question about a legal scenario, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the situation is that a highway patrol officer stops a driver for speeding. He finds out that her license is suspended. He lets her husband drive the car home but arrests her for driving under suspension. Then, after securing her in the squad car, he searches her vehicle and finds a bag of cocaine in a zippered jacket on the back seat. She's then arrested for possession and intent to deliver. Now, before trial, she moves to suppress the cocaine evidence. The question is whether the trial court is likely to grant that motion.

Hmm, so the main issue here is the legality of the vehicle search. I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, searches generally require a warrant unless an exception applies. One of the exceptions is a search incident to a lawful arrest. But wait, I think the Supreme Court has narrowed that down.

I recall the case of Arizona v. Gant, which dealt with searching a vehicle after the arrest of the driver. In Gant, the Court held that police may search a vehicle incident to arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search or if it's reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense for which the person was arrested.

In this scenario, the driver was secured inside the squad car. So she's not within reaching distance of her own vehicle, which was outside. The officer searched the vehicle after arresting her for driving under suspension. The question is whether the search was lawful under the Gant standard.

Wait, driving under a suspended license is a misdemeanor, right? So when she was arrested, the officer might have had the authority to search the vehicle. But under Gant, the search incident to arrest is only allowed if the person is still in the area or if there's a reasonable belief that the vehicle contains evidence related to the offense.

In this case, the offense was driving with a suspended license. The evidence related to that offense would likely be on her person, like the license itself, not necessarily in the car. So unless the officer had another reason, like probable cause for another offense, the search might not be justified.

Alternatively, maybe the officer had probable cause to search the vehicle for other reasons, like if he saw something suspicious in plain view or smelled something. But the question doesn't mention any such factors. He found the cocaine in a jacket on the back seat, which suggests he had to search inside to find it.

Another angle: the officer allowed her husband to drive the car, so maybe the car was going to be moved. But the search happened after she was secured, so perhaps the officer didn't have a justifiable reason to search without a warrant.

Wait, but what about the fact that she was arrested for driving under suspension? Under Gant, the permissible search incident to arrest would require that she had access to the vehicle or that evidence of the crime (driving under suspension) is in the car. Since she was already in custody and the car was being driven by someone else, the officer might not have had the right to search without probable cause or a warrant.

So, considering all this, the search might have been unlawful because it didn't meet the Gant requirements. Therefore, the motion to suppress would likely be granted.

Looking at the options:

A: Says a warrant is needed unless exigent circumstances. That's generally true, but Gant allows search incident to arrest in some cases.

B: No consent. But consent isn't the issue here; it's about the right to search under Gant.

C: Officer safety. I don't think that's the main issue here. Officer safety might allow a pat-down, but not a full search of the vehicle.

D: Reasonable suspicion because of suspended license. Suspended license alone might not give reasonable suspicion for a search unless there's more.

E: Probable cause after suspended license. Again, maybe not enough on its own.

F: Valid search incident to arrest. But under Gant, that's probably not valid because she was secured and not near the car.

G: She was secured, so no expectation of evidence in the car related to the current arrest. This seems to align with Gant.

H: Cocaine in a personal item. Not sure if that's the main point; the issue is the search's legality, not the item's nature.

J: No warrant to search jacket. But if the search was incident to arrest, maybe the jacket could be searched. But under Gant, it's not allowed here.

So, the correct answer would probably be G: Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured, and police couldn't expect to find evidence related to the arrest in the car.

The question revolves around the legality of a vehicle search conducted after the driver was arrested for driving under a suspended license and secured in a squad car. Under the Fourth Amendment, searches generally require a warrant unless an exception applies. The key exception here is the "search incident to arrest," which the Supreme Court addressed in *Arizona v. Gant*. 

In *Gant*, the Court ruled that a vehicle search incident to arrest is permissible only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or if there is a reasonable belief that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense for which the person was arrested. In this case, the driver was secured in the squad car, meaning she was not within reaching distance of the vehicle. Additionally, the offense (driving under suspension) does not typically involve evidence that would be found in the vehicle itself, as the evidence (e.g., the suspended license) is usually on the person. Without additional factors, such as probable cause or exigent circumstances, the search does not meet the standards set by *Gant*.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, E, I, J**: These options either misapply the legal standards or focus on irrelevant factors like consent or the nature of the item searched.
- **C**: Officer safety is not the primary issue here, as the driver was already secured.
- **F**: A search incident to arrest is not valid under *Gant* because the driver was secured and not near the vehicle.
- **G**: This aligns with *Gant*, as the driver was secured, and there was no reasonable expectation of finding evidence related to the arrest in the vehicle.

Thus, the trial court is likely to grant the suppression motion because the search did not comply with the *Gant* standard.
