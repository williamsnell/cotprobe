Question:

This question refers to the following information.
But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

Okay, so I have this question about the decline of the Roman Empire and I need to figure out which other classical empires experienced similar reasons for their fall. The passage is from Edward Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." Let me break it down.

The passage mentions a few key points. First, the prosperity leading to decay. So as Rome got more prosperous, internal issues started to arise. Then, the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of their conquests. That makes sense because expanding too much can strain resources and lead to internal problems. Also, the military became a problem. The legions became mercenaries, lost their discipline, and started oppressing the republic and then the emperors. The emperors tried to maintain peace but ended up corrupting the military discipline, which made the empire weaker. Eventually, Barbarians overwhelmed the Roman world.

So the main reasons here are overextension of empire through conquests, military corruption and decline, internal decay due to prosperity, and external pressures from barbarian invasions.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find another empire or empires that had similar factors. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Ming and Aztec. The Ming dynasty was China's, known for isolationism. They had the Great Wall but their fall was more due to internal strife and the rise of the Qing. The Aztecs were conquered by the Spanish. Not sure about overextension and military decline in the same way as Rome.

Option B: Egyptian and Hittite. Ancient Egypt had a long decline, but I'm not sure about the same causes. The Hittite Empire fell due to invasions and internal turmoil, maybe, but not sure about military corruption as a main factor.

Option C: Han and Gupta. The Han Dynasty in China declined due to internal corruption, eunuchs, and peasant revolts. Gupta India's decline involved invasions and internal issues, but I'm not sure if it's the same as Rome's military issues. Wait, the Gupta Empire faced pressure from the Hephthalites, which are like barbarian invasions. But did they have military decline due to mercenaries? Maybe not exactly.

Option D: Macedonian and Seleucid. Both were Hellenistic empires after Alexander. They had a lot of internal conflicts and fragmentation. The Seleucids had to deal with external pressures like the Parthians and internal decay. But I'm not sure about military corruption or mercenaries being the main cause.

Option E: Mughal and Assyrian. The Mughal Empire in India declined due to regionalism and internal power struggles. Assyria fell due to a combination of internal issues and external attacks, but I don't recall military corruption being a primary factor.

Option F: Maurya and Babylonian. The Mauryan Empire in India declined after Ashoka; maybe due to fragmentation. Babylon fell to the Persians, but I don't think the same reasons apply here.

Option G: Tang and Ottoman. The Tang Dynasty had a decline due to regional warlords and internal issues. The Ottomans declined later, but in terms of military, they had janissaries who became powerful, leading to internal strife. That might be somewhat similar, as the military's power affecting the empire.

Option H: Qin and Etruscan. Qin China is famous for its short duration and strict policies leading to revolt. Etruscans were eventually absorbed into Rome, so not really the same.

Option I: Byzantine and Persian. The Byzantine Empire faced many challenges, including military overextension and invasions. The Sassanian Persians had their own issues, but I'm not sure about the specifics matching Rome's decline as per the passage.

Option J: Abbasid and Inca. The Abbasid Caliphate faced internal divisions and external invasions. The Inca Empire was conquered by the Spanish, so different reasons.

Wait, going back. The passage's main points are: prosperity leading to decay, overextension through conquest leading to more problems, military becoming corrupt and less disciplined, leading to oppression and eventual barbarian invasions.

Looking for empires that had similar reasons. The Han Empire, for example, had a strong military but faced internal corruption and eunuch influence which weakened the empire. They also dealt with invasions from the north, like the Xiongnu. But did their military become mercenaries? I'm not sure.

The Gupta Empire faced invasions from the Hephthalites, which are sometimes called the White Huns. Their empire declined after these invasions. But again, did their military decline due to becoming mercenaries? I'm not certain.

Wait, the Mauryan Empire after Ashoka had a period where the empire fragmented. Then the Gupta rose. But the decline of the Gupta was due to external invasions and internal issues.

Now, looking at option D: Macedonian and Seleucid. Both were vast empires that faced internal conflicts and external pressures. The Seleucids had a lot of territory and faced challenges from the Parthians and others. But the military corruption aspect isn't something I remember as a main cause.

Option G: Tang and Ottoman. The Ottomans had issues with their military, like the janissaries becoming too powerful and causing internal strife. The Tang Dynasty's decline involved regional military governors (jiedushi) gaining power, leading to a fragmented empire. So maybe their military structures became problematic, leading to decline.

Alternatively, looking at the Han and Gupta option (C), both had long periods of prosperity followed by decline. The Han had issues with eunuchs and corruption, but that's more bureaucracy than military. The Gupta's military might have been weakened by constant invasions, but I'm not sure about the mercenaries part.

Wait, the passage says the legions became like mercenaries and lost discipline. So looking for empires where the military became less reliable, perhaps mercenary forces, leading to internal issues.

The Abbasid Caliphate (option J) had issues with their military, like the use of Turkish slave soldiers (mamluks) who eventually took power. This could be similar to the military corruption aspect. The Inca Empire was small and fell to external conquest, so maybe not.

Hmm, another angle: the problem with the military in Rome was that they were away fighting distant wars, adopting vices, and becoming mercenaries who then turned against the state. So empires that had professional armies that became a threat to the state.

The Mughal Empire (option E) didn't exactly have that. The Qin Dynasty had a strong military but it was more about oppression leading to revolt. The Assyrians used a powerful military but their fall was due to a combination of internal turmoil and external attacks.

Wait, the Han and Gupta. Let me think again. The Han faced a problem where the military was not as strong, and there were internal revolts. The Gupta Empire's military was strained from fighting off invaders, leading to decline. Maybe the military was overextended, leading to internal decay.

So option C is Han and Gupta. Both were classical empires that faced similar issues as Rome: overextension, military strain, internal decay, and external invasions.

Alternatively, option G: Tang and Ottoman. The Tang's military was powerful but later faced challenges from regional commanders. The Ottomans had issues with their elite troops (janissaries) becoming a political force. So both had military-related issues leading to decline.

Wait, the passage emphasizes the military becoming corrupt and a threat to the state, leading to the empire's fall. So looking for empires where the military turned against the rulers, or where the military's discipline was corrupted.

The Tang Dynasty had issues with eunuchs and regional warlords, which weakened the central government. The Ottoman's janissaries did become a powerful force that could overthrow sultans, which is similar to the Roman legions oppressing the emperors.

So maybe option G, Tang and Ottoman, fit the description because their military forces became a problem for the rulers, leading to decline.

Alternatively, the Han and Gupta might not have had the same military issues but faced similar external and internal pressures.

I'm a bit torn between options C and G. The passage's main points are military corruption and overextension leading to decline.

Another angle: the Roman Empire's military was its strength, but when it became corrupt, it led to downfall. The Tang and Ottoman empires also had powerful militaries that eventually contributed to their decline through internal corruption or becoming too powerful.

So I'm leaning towards option G: Tang and Ottoman.

The passage from Edward Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" identifies key factors contributing to Rome's fall: prosperity leading to decay, overextension of conquests, military corruption and decline, and external pressures from barbarian invasions. The military, in particular, became corrupt and less disciplined, turning into a threat to the state. To determine which classical empires faced similar challenges, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A (Ming and Aztec):** The Ming Dynasty declined due to internal strife and isolationism, while the Aztecs were conquered by the Spanish. These factors do not align closely with Rome's military corruption and overextension.
- **Option B (Egyptian and Hittite):** Ancient Egypt's decline was gradual, and the Hittite Empire fell due to invasions and internal turmoil. Military corruption is not a primary factor here.
- **Option C (Han and Gupta):** The Han Dynasty declined due to internal corruption and eunuch influence, while the Gupta Empire faced invasions from the Hephthalites. While both empires experienced overextension and external pressures, the military corruption aspect is less pronounced.
- **Option D (Macedonian and Seleucid):** These Hellenistic empires faced internal conflicts and fragmentation, but military corruption is not highlighted as a main cause.
- **Option E (Mughal and Assyrian):** The Mughal Empire declined due to regionalism and power struggles, while Assyria fell to internal and external pressures. Military corruption is not a central factor.
- **Option F (Maurya and Babylonian):** The Mauryan Empire fragmented after Ashoka, and Babylon fell to the Persians. These declines do not closely mirror Rome's military-related issues.
- **Option G (Tang and Ottoman):** The Tang Dynasty faced challenges from regional warlords and eunuchs, while the Ottoman Empire's janissaries became a powerful political force, leading to internal strife. Both empires experienced military-related issues that weakened their central authority, aligning closely with Rome's decline.
- **Option H (Qin and Etruscan):** The Qin Dynasty's short duration was marked by oppression and revolt, while the Etruscans were absorbed into Rome. These factors do not match Rome's military corruption and overextension.
- **Option I (Byzantine and Persian):** The Byzantine Empire faced overextension and invasions, while the Sassanian Persians had internal and external challenges. However, military corruption is not emphasized.
- **Option J (Abbasid and Inca):** The Abbasid Caliphate faced internal divisions and invasions, while the Inca Empire was conquered by the Spanish. These factors differ from Rome's decline.

The most fitting option is **G (Tang and Ottoman)**, as both empires experienced military corruption and internal strife that weakened their central authority, similar to Rome's decline.

Answer: G
