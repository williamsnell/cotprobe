Question:

A previously healthy 24-year-old woman who is a college student comes to the office because of a 6-month history of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements. She takes no medications. She does not smoke or use illicit drugs. She drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 100/72 mm Hg. Physical examination, including digital rectal examination, shows no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A urease breath test result is negative. Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

Options:

A: Prednisolone
B: Omeprazole
C: Azathioprine
D: Lubiprostone
E: Loperamide
F: Infliximab
G: Metronidazole
H: Hydrocortisone
I: Rifaximin
J: Mesalamine

Okay, so I've got this question about a 24-year-old woman with some abdominal symptoms. Let me try to break it down.

She's presenting with a 6-month history of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. The symptoms get worse when she's preparing for exams, which probably means they're stress-related. But they improve after bowel movements. Hmm, so the symptoms seem to be related to her bowel movements, which might point towards a functional gastrointestinal disorder.

Her vital signs are normal: pulse 72, BP 100/72. BMI is 22, so she's not underweight or overweight. No medications except occasional alcohol. No smoking or illicit drugs. So probably not substance-induced issues.

Physical exam, including digital rectal, is normal. Blood tests like CBC and electrolytes are normal. Urea breath test is negative, which suggests H. pylori isn't present. Upper and lower endoscopies are normal, so no signs of structural issues like ulcers, inflammation, or infections.

So, considering the symptoms and the lack of findings, I'm thinking this might be irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is common and presents with abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. The fact that stress exacerbates her symptoms supports this because stress is a known trigger for IBS.

Now, looking at the symptoms more closely: she has constipation-predominant IBS because she's experiencing constipation and bloating. So the treatment should target constipation in IBS.

The options given are various medications. Let's go through them:

A: Prednisolone - that's a corticosteroid, used for inflammation. But her tests don't show inflammation, so probably not needed.

B: Omeprazole - a PPI, used for acid reflux. She doesn't have symptoms of GERD, so this might not help.

C: Azathioprine - an immunosuppressant, used in Crohn's or ulcerative colitis. Not applicable here since endoscopies are normal.

D: Lubiprostone - this is a chloride channel activator, which increases intestinal fluid secretion. It's used for constipation, especially in IBS-C.

E: Loperamide - this is for diarrhea, as it slows gut movement. She's constipated, so this would make it worse.

F: Infliximab - a biologic for autoimmune diseases like Crohn's. Again, not indicated here.

G: Metronidazole - antibiotic, used for infections like bacterial overgrowth. But her urease test is negative, and the endoscopies are normal.

H: Hydrocortisone - another steroid, same reasoning as A.

I: Rifaximin - an antibiotic sometimes used for IBS-D (diarrhea type) when small intestine bacterial overgrowth is suspected. Not sure if it's the best here since she's constipated.

J: Mesalamine - an anti-inflammatory used in IBD. Since there's no inflammation, this isn't needed.

So the most appropriate choice is D: Lubiprostone. It's approved for IBS-C. Alternatively, other options like fiber supplements or laxatives might be considered, but among the choices given, D fits best.

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a 6-month history of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. Her symptoms worsen with stress, such as during exam preparation, and improve after bowel movements. She has no significant medical history, and her physical examination, blood tests, urease breath test, and endoscopies are all normal. These findings suggest a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), as there is no evidence of inflammation, infection, or structural abnormalities.

Given her constipation-predominant symptoms, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would target IBS-C. Among the options provided:

- **Lubiprostone (D)** is a chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion, making it an effective treatment for constipation in IBS-C.
- Other options like **Loperamide (E)** and **Rifaximin (I)** are more suited for diarrhea-predominant IBS or other conditions, not constipation.
- Medications like **Omeprazole (B)**, **Prednisolone (A)**, **Azathioprine (C)**, **Infliximab (F)**, **Metronidazole (G)**, **Hydrocortisone (H)**, and **Mesalamine (J)** are not appropriate for this patient as they are used for conditions such as acid reflux, inflammation, or infections, which are not present here.

Thus, the most appropriate choice is **Lubiprostone**.

Answer: D
