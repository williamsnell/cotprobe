To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^4 \cdot 2 \cdot a^4 + a^{2+1-3}\) when \(a = 42\), let's break it down step by step.

1. **Simplify \(\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^4 \cdot 2 \cdot a^4\):**
   - \(\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{a^4}\).
   - Multiply by \(a^4\): \(\frac{1}{a^4} \cdot a^4 = 1\).
   - Multiply by 2: \(2 \cdot 1 = 2\).

2. **Simplify \(a^{2+1-3}\):**
   - \(2 + 1 - 3 = 0\).
   - Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1: \(a^0 = 1\).

3. **Combine the results:**
   - \(2 + 1 = 3\).

Thus, the final answer is **3**.

The correct option is **G**.
