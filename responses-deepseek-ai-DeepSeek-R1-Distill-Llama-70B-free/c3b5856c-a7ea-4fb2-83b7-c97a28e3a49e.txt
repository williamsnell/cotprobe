Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me read it again. The question says that real GDP per capita was $10,000 in 1990 and $15,000 in 2000. I need to find the amount of economic growth between these two years. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that economic growth is usually measured by the percentage change in real GDP over a period. Oh wait, right, real GDP per capita is used here because it accounts for population changes and inflation, so that's the correct measure for growth.

So the formula I think is needed here is the percentage change formula. The formula is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100 to get the percentage. Let me plug in the numbers. The old value is $10,000 in 1990, and the new value is $15,000 in 2000.

Calculating the difference first: 15,000 minus 10,000 equals 5,000. Then, divide that by the old value, which is 10,000. So 5,000 divided by 10,000 is 0.5. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is 50%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes people might confuse this with something like the average annual growth rate, but the question just asks for the amount of economic growth between the two years, not the annual rate. So it's a straightforward percentage change over the entire decade.

Looking at the options, option I is 50 percent. So that's the correct answer. Other options don't match. For example, option E is 25%, which would be if the growth was from 10k to 12.5k. Option D is 100%, which would mean it doubled to 20k. So yeah, 50% makes sense here.

The economic growth is calculated as the percentage change in real GDP per capita from 1990 to 2000. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{15,000 - 10,000}{10,000} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

I: 50 percent.

Answer: I
