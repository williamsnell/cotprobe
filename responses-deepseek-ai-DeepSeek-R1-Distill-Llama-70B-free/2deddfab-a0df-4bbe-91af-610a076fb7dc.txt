Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the freezing point depression and the degree of ionization of HF. Hmm, I remember that freezing point depression is related to the concentration of solute particles in a solution. But wait, HF is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't completely ionize in water. That must affect the calculation because the number of particles will be more than just the molecules of HF, but less than if it were a strong acid.

The problem says we have 10.0 grams of HF dissolved in 500 grams of water. The freezing point is -1.98°C. The freezing point depression (ΔTf) is given as 1.86°C·mol⁻¹·kg. Wait, no, wait. Freezing point depression is the change in freezing point, so the solution's freezing point is lower than pure water's 0°C. So the ΔTf here is the difference, which is 1.98°C because pure water freezes at 0, and the solution at -1.98. So ΔTf is 1.98°C.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. The formula is ΔTf = i * Kf * m. Here, m is the molality. So I can calculate the molality first, and then the van't Hoff factor i, which depends on the ionization.

Wait, the question is to find the degree of ionization, which is the percentage of HF that dissociates into ions. So first, I think I should find the molality of the solution considering the ionization.

Alright, let's start by calculating the molality. The formula is ΔTf = i * Kf * m. Here, m is the molality of the solute, but since HF ionizes, the effective molality (considering ions) is higher.

Wait, the actual formula is ΔTf = i * (molality of HF) * (Kf). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. For a weak electrolyte like HF, the dissociation is partial. So the total number of particles is (1 + α), where α is the degree of ionization. Since HF dissociates into H+ and F-, each mole of HF gives 2 moles of ions if fully ionized, but since it's weak, it's 1 + α.

Wait, but wait: HF ↔ H+ + F⁻. So for each mole of HF, we get (1 - α) moles of HF, α moles of H+, and α moles of F⁻. So the total moles of particles is (1 - α) + α + α = 1 + α. So the van't Hoff factor i is 1 + α.

So, the freezing point depression is given by ΔTf = i * m * Kf.

Wait, so in this case, m is the molality of HF before ionization. So m is the moles of HF per kg of solvent.

So first, I need to find m, the molality of HF. Then, use ΔTf = i * m * Kf, but since i is (1 + α), I can express everything in terms of α.

Wait, but wait, the problem is to find α. So we have to rearrange the equation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the molality (m) of HF.
2. Use the freezing point depression equation to find i, which is (1 + α).
3. Solve for α.

Wait, that's the plan. Let's start.

Step 1: Calculate molality.

HF has a molar mass of 20.0 g/mol (given). So moles of HF = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / 20.0 g/mol = 0.5 moles.

The solvent is 500 g of H2O, which is 0.5 kg. So molality m = moles / kg = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1.0 m.

So m is 1.0 mol/kg.

Step 2: Using the freezing point depression formula.

ΔTf = i * m * Kf

We know ΔTf is 1.98°C, m is 1.0, and Kf is 1.86°C·kg/mol.

So plug the values in:

1.98 = i * 1.0 * 1.86

Wait, solving for i: i = 1.98 / (1.86) ≈ 1.06445.

Hmm, wait, 1.98 divided by 1.86 is approximately 1.064. But wait, i can't be more than 2 because each HF can dissociate into 2 ions max. So 1.064 is possible because the degree of ionization is about 0.064, so about 6.4% ionized. But let me check the calculation.

Wait, 1.98 / 1.86. Let me compute it accurately.

1.98 ÷ 1.86. Let's see: 1.86 * 1 = 1.86. 1.98 -1.86=0.12. 0.12/1.86=0.064516. So i ≈ 1.0645.

So i = 1 + α ≈ 1.0645 → α ≈ 0.0645 → 6.45% ionization.

Looking at the options, option C is 6%, option F is 12%, and option G is 8%. So 6.45 is closest to 6%, which is option C. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the ΔTf. The solution's freezing point is -1.98°C, so the change is 1.98°C (since pure water is 0°C). So yes, that part was correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: for weak electrolytes, the molality in the freezing point formula is the molality of the solute before dissociation. So in our case, m is 1.0 m, correct. So the calculation for i is correct.

So i = 1.0645, which is 1 + α = 1.0645 → α ≈ 0.0645 → 6.45%, which is approximately 6%. So the correct answer would be option C, 6%.

But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of moles of HF.

We have 10.0 grams of HF. Molar mass is 20.0 g/mol, so moles = 10 / 20 = 0.5 mol. Solvent is 500 g = 0.5 kg. So molality is 0.5 / 0.5 = 1.0 m, correct.

So the rest of the steps are correct. Thus, the degree of ionization is approximately 6.45%, which is closest to option C:6%.
</think>

To calculate the degree of ionization of HF, we start by determining the molality of the HF solution. The molar mass of HF is given as 20.0 g/mol, and the mass of HF is 10.0 g. The number of moles of HF is:

\[
\text{Moles of HF} = \frac{\text{Mass of HF}}{\text{Molar Mass of HF}} = \frac{10.0}{20.0} = 0.5 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The solvent mass is 500 g, which is equivalent to 0.5 kg. The molality (\(m\)) is then:

\[
m = \frac{\text{Moles of HF}}{\text{kg of Solvent}} = \frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1.0 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

Next, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot m \cdot K_f,
\]

where \(i\) is the van’t Hoff factor, \(m\) is the molality, and \(K_f\) is the freezing point depression constant of water (\(1.86^\circ \text{C·kg·mol}^{-1}\)). The freezing point depression (\(\Delta T_f\)) is given as \(1.98^\circ \text{C}\). Substituting the known values:

\[
1.98 = i \cdot 1.0 \cdot 1.86.
\]

Solving for \(i\):

\[
i = \frac{1.98}{1.86} \approx 1.0645.
\]

For the dissociation of HF (\(\text{HF} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{F}^-\)), the van’t Hoff factor is \(i = 1 + \alpha\), where \(\alpha\) is the degree of ionization. Substituting \(i = 1.0645\):

\[
1 + \alpha = 1.0645 \implies \alpha = 1.0645 - 1 = 0.0645.
\]

Converting \(\alpha\) to a percentage:

\[
\alpha = 0.0645 \times 100 \approx 6.45\%.
\]

The closest option to 6.45% is 6%, which corresponds to **option C**.
