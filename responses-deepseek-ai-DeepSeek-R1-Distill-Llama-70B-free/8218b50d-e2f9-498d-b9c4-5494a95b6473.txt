Okay, so I've got this physics problem about standing waves, and I need to find the amplitude of motion at a specific point. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have two waves, y₁ and y₂. The equations are given as:

y₁ = 15 sin(3πt - 5x)
y₂ = 15 sin(3πt + 5x)

Hmm, wait, those look like wave functions. I remember that standing waves are formed by the superposition of two waves traveling in opposite directions. So y₁ is moving in the positive x-direction, and y₂ is moving in the negative x-direction because of the plus and minus signs in their arguments.

The question is about finding the amplitude at x = 21. Right, when two waves interfere to form a standing wave, the resulting displacement y is the sum of y₁ and y₂. So I should probably add these two wave functions together.

Wait, adding sinusoidal functions. I remember that when you have sin(A ± B), there are sum and difference identities. Oh right, the formula for sin A + sin B. Let me recall: sin A + sin B equals 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 ). Yeah, that's it.

So let's apply this identity to y = y₁ + y₂. Let me set A as (3πt -5x) and B as (3πt +5x). So adding them:

sin(A) + sin(B) = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 )

Calculating (A + B)/2: [ (3πt-5x) + (3πt+5x) ] / 2 = (6πt)/2 = 3πt.

And (A - B)/2: [ (3πt-5x) - (3πt+5x) ] / 2 = (-10x)/2 = -5x.

So putting it together: 2 sin(3πt) cos(-5x). But cosine is an even function, so cos(-5x) = cos(5x). So the sum becomes 2 sin(3πt) cos(5x) multiplied by the amplitude factor, which is 15 each, so wait the original functions had 15 as their amplitudes.

Wait wait, no, each y has an amplitude of 15, so when we add them, y = 15 sin(A) + 15 sin(B) = 15 [sin(A) + sin(B)] = 15 * [2 sin(3πt) cos(5x) ].

Wait no, wait. Let me correct that. The sum y₁ + y₂ would be 15 sin(A) + 15 sin(B). So factor out the 15: 15 [ sin(A) + sin(B) ] = 15 * 2 sin(3πt) cos(5x) ) = 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x).

So the resultant wave is y = 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). Wait, but I think the standard form for a standing wave is y(x,t) = [2A cos(kx)] sin(ωt), or something like that. So in this case, our y is 30 sin(ωt) cos(kx), which is slightly different, but essentially the same idea because sine and cosine are phase-shifted versions of each other.

But for the amplitude of the standing wave at a particular x, I think the maximum displacement (the amplitude) would be given by the coefficient in front. But wait, no. Wait, when you have y = [2A cos(kx)] sin(ωt), the amplitude at position x is 2A cos(kx). So the maximum possible amplitude is 2A, and it varies with x. So in this problem, the amplitude at a specific x is 30 cos(5x), because the 30 is the coefficient, and the sin(3πt) varies with time, but the amplitude is the maximum of that product.

Wait wait, no. Hmm, perhaps I should think again. The standing wave equation is often written as y(x,t) = 2A sin(kx) sin(ωt), in which case the amplitude is 2A |sin(kx)|. Alternatively, if it's written as y = [2A cos(kx)] sin(ωt), then the amplitude would be 2A |cos(kx)|.

Wait, in our case, we have y = 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). So comparing to the standard forms, perhaps the amplitude is 30 |cos(5x)|. So the amplitude at a particular x is 30 multiplied by the absolute value of cos(5x) evaluated at that x.

But let's make sure. So the general form is y(x,t) = [some function of x] * [some function of t]. The function of t is sin(ωt) or cos(ωt), which oscillates between -1 and 1. So the maximum displacement (amplitude) at each x is the coefficient in front, which is the function of x. So in our case, the amplitude as a function of x is 30 cos(5x), but since amplitude is a positive quantity, we'd take the absolute value.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the maximum value of y at that x, so actually, it's the coefficient in front of the sine or cosine time term. So in this case, the amplitude is 30 |cos(5x)|. Because the sine term varies between -1 and 1, so the maximum y is 30 |cos(5x)|.

So, the problem wants the amplitude at x = 21. So we plug x=21 into 30 |cos(5*21)|.

Let's compute 5*21: 5 *21 is 105. So cos(105). But wait, 105 radians? That's a lot. Hmm, wait, but wait, did I get the wave numbers right? Because usually, the wave number k is in radians per meter, but the x here is just a variable. So I think whether it's 105 radians depends on the units, but perhaps we're to treat x as unitless here. So cos(105) is the same as cos(105 radians).

Wait, but 105 radians is more than 2π (which is about 6.28). Let me compute 105 divided by 2π to see how many full circles that is.

2π is approximately 6.2832.

105 / 6.2832 ≈ 16.71. So that's 16 full circles and 0.71 of a circle. So 0.71 times 2π is about 4.46 radians. So cos(105) is equal to cos(4.46), because cosine is periodic with period 2π.

Wait, but wait, cos(theta) is periodic every 2π, so cos(105) = cos(105 - 2π *16 ). Let me compute 105 - (16 * 2π) = 105 - (32π). Let me compute 32π numerically: 32 *3.1416≈100.530. So 105 -100.530≈4.47 radians.

So cos(4.47) is about cos(4.47). Let's think about 4.47 radians. Pi is about 3.1416, so 4.47 is pi + 1.329 radians. So that's in the third quadrant where cosine is negative. So cos(4.47) ≈ -cos(1.329). Because cos(pi + theta) = -cos(theta).

Wait, wait, cos(pi + theta) is -cos(theta) if theta is in the first quadrant. Wait, let me think: pi + theta is in the third quadrant. The reference angle is theta. So cos(pi + theta) is -cos(theta). Similarly, sin(pi + theta) is -sin(theta).

So cos(4.47) = cos(pi + 1.329) = -cos(1.329). What's cos(1.329)? 1.329 radians is about 76 degrees (since pi radians is 180, so 1 rad ≈57.3 degrees. So 1.329 *57.3 ≈ 76 degrees).

So cos(76 degrees) is approximately 0.2419. So cos(1.329) ≈ 0.2419. Therefore, cos(4.47) ≈ -0.2419.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 4.47 radians numerically.

Using calculator, cos(4.47) ≈ cos(4.47) ≈ -0.2108. Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator. Let me think: 4.47 radians is between 3π/2 (≈4.712) and π (≈3.1416), so it's in the third quadrant. So cosine is negative there.

Let me compute cos(4.47). Using a calculator function: 4.47 radians is approximately cos(4.47) ≈ -0.9952? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, cos(4.47) is cos(4.47), let's see: 

Wait, 4 radians is about 229 degrees. 4.47 is about 256 degrees (because 0.47 rad ≈27 degrees: 0.47 * (180/pi) ≈27 degrees. So 4.47 rad ≈256 degrees. So in the third quadrant, 256-180=76 degrees into the third quadrant. So cos(256) is equal to -cos(76). So cos(76) is about 0.2419, so cos(256)= -0.2419.

So cos(4.47) ≈ -0.2419.

So going back, the amplitude at x=21 is 30 * |cos(5*21)| = 30 * |cos(105)| = 30 * |cos(4.47)| ≈30 * 0.2419 ≈7.257.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought cos(4.47)= -0.2419, so the absolute value would make it 0.2419. So 30 * 0.2419 is approximately 7.257.

Looking at the options, the closest option would be I:7.5, but let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:24, B:30, C:21, D:12, E:27, F:9.27, G:0, H:15, I:7.5, J:18.54.

So 7.257 is near 7.5, which is option I.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 5x=105 radians, but wait, 105 radians mod 2π. So 2π is about 6.28319. So 105 /6.28319 is approximately 16.714. So 16 full cycles, and 0.714*2π≈4.49 radians.

So cos(105) = cos(4.49). So 4.49 radians is 4.49 - pi (3.14159) = 1.348 radians above pi. So it's in the third quadrant. So cos(4.49) = -cos(1.348). Let's find cos(1.348) accurately. 1.348 radians is about 77.3 degrees. Cos(77.3 degrees) is approximately 0.2225. So cos(4.49) ≈ -0.2225.

So the absolute value is 0.2225. Multiply by 30: 30 *0.2225 ≈6.675. Hmm, that's about 6.68, which is closer to 6.8 or 7 perhaps. But the options don't have 6.68; the closest is 7.5 (option I) or perhaps 9.27 (option F).

Wait, maybe I should compute cos(105) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: when dealing with standing waves, the amplitude varies with position. The nodes occur where the amplitude is zero, and antinodes where it's maximum.

The amplitude is maximum when cos(5x) is ±1, so the maximum possible amplitude is 30*1=30. So the maximum amplitude is 30, which is option B.

But wait, that's the maximum amplitude overall, but the question is asking for the amplitude at x=21, so it's not necessarily the maximum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the superposition. Let me rederive it.

y1 =15 sin(3πt -5x)
y2=15 sin(3πt +5x)

The sum y = y1 + y2 = 15 [ sin(3πt -5x) + sin(3πt +5x) ]

Using the identity: sin A + sin B = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 )

So A =3πt -5x, B=3πt +5x.

(A + B)/2 = (6πt)/2 =3πt.

(A - B)/2 = (-10x)/2 = -5x.

So y=15 * [ 2 sin(3πt) cos(-5x) ].

Since cos is even, cos(-5x)=cos(5x), so y=30 sin(3πt) cos(5x).

So y=30 cos(5x) sin(3πt).

So the amplitude is 30 cos(5x). But amplitude is a positive quantity, so it's 30 |cos(5x)|.

Wait, but wait, if the standing wave is written as y(x,t)=A(x) sin(ωt), where A(x) is the amplitude function, then the amplitude at position x is |A(x)|. So in this case, A(x)=30 cos(5x). So the amplitude is 30 |cos(5x)|.

So at x=21, the amplitude is 30 |cos(5*21)|=30 |cos(105)|.

Now, cos(105 radians). Let me compute this more accurately.

But wait, 105 radians is a huge angle. Let me find an equivalent angle between 0 and 2π by subtracting multiples of 2π.

Compute 105 divided by 2π: 105 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈105 /6.2832 ≈16.714.

So take the integer part:16, so subtract 16 * 2π from 105.

16*2π=32π≈100.53096.

105 -100.53096=4.46904 radians.

So cos(105)=cos(4.46904).

Now, 4.46904 radians is greater than π (≈3.1416), so it's in the third quadrant where cosine is negative.

Compute cos(4.46904):

We can write 4.46904 = π + (4.46904 - π) = π + (4.46904 -3.1416)= π +1.32744.

So cos(π +θ) = -cosθ.

So cos(4.46904)= -cos(1.32744).

Now, compute cos(1.32744 radians):

1.32744 radians is approximately 76 degrees (since 1 rad≈57.3 degrees → 1.32744 *57.3≈76 degrees).

The cosine of 76 degrees is approximately 0.2419.

So cos(1.32744)≈0.2419.

Thus, cos(4.46904)= -0.2419.

Taking absolute value, |cos(4.46904)|=0.2419.

So the amplitude is 30 *0.2419≈7.257.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:7.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check using a calculator for the exact value of cos(4.46904).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator for better precision. Let's compute cos(4.46904):

Using a calculator: 4.46904 radians.

Compute cos(4.46904):

I can use a calculator to find cos(4.46904) ≈ -0.2108.

Wait, that's a different value than before. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the manual calculation.

Let me compute cos(4.46904) using a calculator.

Using a calculator: 4.46904 radians.

The calculator gives cos(4.46904) ≈ -0.2108.

So |cos(4.46904)|=0.2108.

So the amplitude is 30 * 0.2108≈6.324.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.32, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. The options are:

A:24, B:30, C:21, D:12, E:27, F:9.27, G:0, H:15, I:7.5, J:18.54.

So 6.32 is closest to option F:9.27, but that's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let's try another way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5x=105 radians. Wait, 105 radians is a lot, but perhaps I can find cos(105) using periodicity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as cos(105) = cos(105 - 17*2π), since 17*2π≈106.814, which is larger than 105. Hmm, perhaps 16*2π≈100.53, so 105-100.53=4.47 radians as before.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator for cos(4.47):

cos(4.47) ≈ cos(4.47) ≈-0.9952? No, that can't be right because cos(4.47) can't be -0.9952 because 4.47 is in the third quadrant, and at 4.712 (3π/2), cos is 0. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, 4.47 radians is about 256 degrees (since 4.47 * (180/π) ≈4.47 *57.3≈256 degrees). So cos(256 degrees) is the same as cos(180+76) degrees, which is -cos(76 degrees). Cos(76 degrees) is about 0.2419, so cos(256)≈-0.2419. So cos(4.47)
