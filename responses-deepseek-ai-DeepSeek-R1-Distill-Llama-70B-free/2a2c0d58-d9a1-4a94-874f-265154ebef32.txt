Okay, so I need to evaluate this series S, which is the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/(3^n). Hmm, I remember that this is a geometric series. Oh right, a geometric series has the form sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n, where r is the common ratio.

Wait, in this case, each term is 1/3^n. So that can be rewritten as (1/3)^n. So the common ratio r is 1/3. Got it.

I recall that the sum of an infinite geometric series where |r| < 1 is given by S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term. Here, the first term when n=0 is 1/(3^0) which is 1. So a is 1.

So plugging into the formula, S = 1 / (1 - 1/3). Let me compute that. 1 - 1/3 is 2/3. So 1 divided by (2/3) is the same as multiplying by 3/2. So S = 3/2. 

Looking at the options, option J is 3/2. So the answer should be J.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the series is 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ... Each term is a third of the previous one. The sum of such a series should be 1/(1 - 1/3) = 3/2. Yep, that's correct.

The series 

$$
S = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3^n}
$$

is a geometric series with the first term \( a = 1 \) and the common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{3} \). The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:

$$
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}, \quad \text{for } |r| < 1.
$$

Substituting \( a = 1 \) and \( r = \frac{1}{3} \):

$$
S = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2}.
$$

Thus, the sum of the series is \( \frac{3}{2} \), which corresponds to option J.
