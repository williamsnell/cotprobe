Question:

A restaurant used 231 eggs last week. Of these, 46 were brown in color. The remaining eggs were white in color. Which equation can be used to solve for w, the number of white eggs used last week?

Options:

A: w = 231 * 46
B: w = 231/46
C: 231+ 46w = 0
D: 46+w= 231
E: 231 = 46w
F: 231w = 46
G: 46 = 231w
H: w = 46 - 231
I: w= 231+ 46

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the right equation to solve for the number of white eggs used by the restaurant. Let's think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the restaurant used a total of 231 eggs last week. Out of these, 46 were brown, and the rest were white. I need to find the number of white eggs, which is represented by w.

Hmm, so the total eggs are the sum of brown eggs and white eggs. That makes sense because those are the only two colors mentioned. So, if I add the brown eggs and white eggs together, it should equal the total number of eggs used.

Wait, so mathematically, that would be brown eggs plus white eggs equals total eggs. So that's 46 (brown) plus w (white) equals 231 (total). So the equation is 46 + w = 231.

Looking at the answer choices, I need to see which one matches this equation. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: w = 231 * 46. That would be multiplication, which doesn't make sense here because we're adding two groups, not multiplying. So A's not right.

Option B: w = 231 / 46. Division? Hmm, why would we divide? That would give a different result, maybe an average or something, but that's not what we need here. We're looking for the sum, not a quotient.

Option C: 231 + 46w = 0. Wait, that's adding 231 and 46 times w, setting it to zero. That doesn't make sense because the total is 231, and we're trying to find w such that 46 plus w is 231. So C's equation doesn't fit.

Option D: 46 + w = 231. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. This equation correctly represents the total number of eggs as the sum of brown and white eggs. So D looks correct.

Option E: 231 = 46w. That would imply 46 multiplied by some w equals 231, which would make w a fraction. But we're not solving for how many dozens or anything, just the count of white eggs, which is 231 - 46, so E doesn't fit.

Option F: 231w = 46. Again, this would solve for w as 46 divided by 231, which is a fraction less than one. That can't be right because we're talking about whole eggs. So F's out.

Option G: 46 = 231w. Similar to E and F, this would result in a fractional w, which doesn't make sense here. So G's not correct.

Option H: w = 46 - 231. Wait, that would give a negative number because 46 is less than 231. That can't be right because the number of white eggs can't be negative. So H is incorrect.

Option I: w=231 +46. That would add both numbers, giving w as 277, which is more than the total eggs used. That doesn't make sense because the total is 231. So I is wrong.

So after checking all the options, the correct equation is option D: 46 + w = 231.

The correct equation to find the number of white eggs (w) is based on the total eggs used, which is the sum of brown and white eggs. Since 46 eggs were brown, the equation is:

46 + w = 231

This matches option D.
