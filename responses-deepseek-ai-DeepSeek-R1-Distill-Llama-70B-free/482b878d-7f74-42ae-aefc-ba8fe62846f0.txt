Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the unit rate for driving 308 kilometers in 4 hours. Hmm, unit rate usually means the rate per one unit of time, right? So in this case, I think I need to find out how many kilometers are covered per hour.

Alright, let's see. The formula for speed is distance divided by time. So that's 308 km divided by 4 hours. Let me do that calculation. 308 divided by 4... Let's see, 4 times 70 is 280, and 308 minus 280 is 28 left. 28 divided by 4 is 7, so 70 plus 7 is 77. Oh wait, that would make it 77 km/h. But wait, let me double-check that division because sometimes I make mistakes.

Alternatively, I can think of 4 times 77 is 308, right? 4 times 70 is 280, and 4 times 7 is 28, adding up to 308. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

But wait, the question says to round to the nearest hundredth if necessary. Oh wait, because 308 divided by 4 is exactly 77, so there's no need for rounding here. So the unit rate is 77 km/h.

Looking at the options, option I is 77 km/h. So that must be the correct answer.

The unit rate for driving 308 km in 4 hours is calculated by dividing the distance by time: 308 รท 4 = 77 km/h. Since the result is exact, no rounding is needed.
