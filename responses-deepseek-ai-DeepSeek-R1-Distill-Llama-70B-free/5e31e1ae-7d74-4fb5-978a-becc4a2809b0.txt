Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the molar mass of a gaseous compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the density is 1.23 kg/m³. Wait, kg? Oh right, usually densities are in grams per liter or something, but okay. So I need to convert that to grams per liter maybe? Because molar mass is usually in grams per mole.

Wait, 1 kg is 1000 grams, and 1 m³ is 1000 liters. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 m³ is actually (10^3 cm)^3, which is 1e6 liters? No wait, 1 liter is 1 dm³, and 1 m is 10 dm. So 1 m³ is (10 dm)^3 = 1000 liters. Oh right, so 1 m³ is 1000 liters. 

So the density is 1.23 kg/m³. Let's convert that to g/L. Since 1 kg is 1000 g, 1.23 kg is 1230 g. And 1 m³ is 1000 L. So dividing 1230 g by 1000 L gives 1.23 g/L. Oh, that's easier than I thought. So the density is 1.23 g/L.

Next, I remember that the molar mass can be found using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Oh wait, density is mass over volume, so maybe there's a formula that relates density, molar mass, pressure, and temperature.

Oh right, the formula is d = (PM)/(RT), where d is density, P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, let me make sure. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Density is mass over volume, so mass is density * volume, and n is mass divided by molar mass. So n = (density * V) / M.

Substituting into PV = nRT: PV = (dV/M) RT. The Vs cancel out, so P = (d M R T) / (d V) ? Wait, maybe I should rearrange it better.

Alternatively, I think the formula is d = (P M) / (R T). Let me see the units. Density is g/L, pressure is in kPa, R is usually in L·kPa/(mol·K), right? Hmm, but I might need to check the units to make sure.

Wait, let me think again: the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. n is moles, which is mass (m) divided by molar mass (M). So n = m/M. Mass m is density (d) times volume (V). So n = (d V)/(M).

Substituting into PV = nRT: PV = (d V / M) * R T. The V's cancel, so P = (d R T) / M. Rearranging, M = (d R T) / P.

Yes, that's correct. So M = (d * R * T) / P.

Now, let's plug in the numbers. But wait, the units must be consistent. Let's make sure all the units are compatible.

Density d is 1.23 kg/m³. Wait, earlier I converted that to 1.23 g/L because 1 kg/m³ is 1 g/L. So yes, 1.23 g/L.

Pressure P is given as 20 kPa. R is the gas constant. Now, what value of R should I use? Since P is in kPa, and the other units: R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but wait, J is m³·kPa because 1 J = 1 kPa·m³. So R in terms of (L·kPa)/(mol·K) would be different.

Wait, 1 m³ is 1000 L. So 8.314 J/(mol·K) is 8.314 (m³·kPa)/(mol·K). To convert to L, divide by 1000, so R is 8.314 / 1000 = 0.008314 (L·kPa)/(mol·K). Wait, no, because 1 J = 1 kPa·L, because 1 J = 1 Pa·m³. Since 1 Pa is 1 kg/(m·s²), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of unit conversions.

Alternatively, I can use R = 8.314 L·kPa/(mol·K). Wait no, wait. Let me look up R in different units.

Wait, I think R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), and since 1 J = 1 kPa * L, because 1 Pa = 1 N/m², 1 J = 1 Pa * m³, and 1 m³ is 1000 L. So 1 J = 1 Pa * 1000 L. So 1 kPa is 1000 Pa, so 1 kPa * L is 1000 Pa * L = 1000 * (N/m²) * m³ = 1000 N·m = 1000 J. So 1 kPa·L = 1000 J. Therefore, 1 J = 0.001 kPa·L.

So R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 * 0.001 kPa·L/(mol·K) ) = 0.008314 kPa·L/(mol·K).

So R is approximately 0.008314 L·kPa/(mol·K).

So now, let's plug the values into M = (d * R * T) / P.

d is 1.23 g/L. Wait, but in the formula, what are the units?

Wait, the formula M = (d R T)/P. Let's check the units:

d is g/L, R is (L·kPa)/(mol·K), T is K, P is kPa.

So units: (g/L) * (L·kPa)/(mol·K) ) * K / (kPa).

Simplify: (g/L * L )= g, (kPa cancels with kPa), (K cancels with K). So overall, units are g/mol, which is correct because molar mass is g/mol.

So the calculation is M = (1.23 g/L) * (0.008314 L·kPa/(mol·K)) * (330 K) ) / (20 kPa).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, let's compute numerator: 1.23 * 0.008314 * 330.

Calculate 1.23 * 0.008314 first.

1.23 * 0.008 = 0.00984. 1.23 * 0.000314 = approx 0.000386. So total approx 0.00984 + 0.000386 = 0.010226.

Wait, more accurately: 0.008314 * 1.23.

Let me compute 1.23 * 0.008 = 0.00984.

1.23 * 0.000314 = ?

0.0003 *1.23 = 0.000369, 0.000014 *1.23= 0.00001722. So total 0.00038622.

So adding to 0.00984 gives 0.01022622.

Then multiply by 330.

0.01022622 * 330 = ?

0.01 * 330 = 3.3.

0.00022622 * 330 = approx 0.0747.

So total is approx 3.3 + 0.0747 = 3.3747.

So numerator is approximately 3.3747 (units? Let's see: (g/L)*(L kPa/mol K)*(K) ) = g kPa/mol. Then divided by P in kPa, so denominator is 20 kPa.

So 3.3747 g kPa/mol / 20 kPa = 3.3747 /20 = 0.1687 g/mol? That doesn't make sense because the answer options are all around 100-200 g/mol.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Because 0.1687 g/mol is way too low, and the options are much higher.

Wait, let me redo the calculation more carefully.

M = (d * R * T) / P.

d = 1.23 g/L.

R = 0.008314 L·kPa/(mol·K).

T = 330 K.

P =20 kPa.

So compute numerator: 1.23 * 0.008314 * 330.

First, 1.23 * 0.008314.

Let me compute this precisely:

1.23 * 0.008314.

Break it down:

1.23 * 0.008 = 0.00984.

1.23 * 0.0003 = 0.000369.

1.23 * 0.000014 = 0.00001722.

So adding these:

0.00984 + 0.000369 = 0.010209.

0.010209 + 0.00001722 = 0.01022622.

So 1.23 * 0.008314 = 0.01022622.

Now multiply by 330:

0.01022622 * 330.

Calculate 0.01 * 330 = 3.3.

0.00022622 * 330 = 0.0747 (approx).

So total is 3.3 + 0.0747 = 3.3747.

So numerator is 3.3747 g·kPa/mol.

Denominator is P =20 kPa.

So M = 3.3747 / 20 = 0.1687 g/mol. Wait, that can't be right. The answer options are all in the hundreds.

Wait, I'm getting 0.1687 g/mol, but that doesn't make sense because molar masses are typically much larger than that. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Let me double-check the formula and the units.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for R. Let me think again about the units.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Since 1 J = 1 kPa * L, then R is 8.314 L·kPa/(mol·K). Because 1 J = 1 kPa * L.

Wait wait, no. Wait, 1 Pa = 1 N/m². 1 J = 1 N·m. So 1 J = 1 (N/m²) * m³ = 1 Pa·m³. And since 1 m³ is 1000 L, 1 J = 1 Pa * 1000 L = 1000 Pa·L.

So 1 Pa = 1 J/(1000 L). Therefore, 1 J = 1000 Pa·L.

So R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 * (1000 Pa·L) / (mol·K) ) = 8314 Pa·L/(mol·K).

But wait, Pa is a smaller unit than kPa. Let me convert that to kPa. Since 1 kPa = 1000 Pa.

So R = 8314 Pa·L/(mol·K) = 8.314 kPa·L/(mol·K).

Oh, wait, I think I see where I went wrong. Earlier, I thought R was 0.008314, but actually it's 8.314 when using kPa.

Because 1 J = 1000 Pa·L. So R in J is 8.314, which is 8.314 * 1000 Pa·L/(mol·K) = 8314 Pa·L/(mol·K) = 8.314 kPa·L/(mol·K).

So R is 8.314 L·kPa/(mol·K).

Ah! So I think I used 0.008314 before when I should have used 8.314. That's why the result was so small.

Let me recalculate with R =8.314.

So M = (d * R * T) / P.

d =1.23 g/L.

R =8.314 L·kPa/(mol·K).

T=330 K.

P=20 kPa.

Compute numerator: 1.23 * 8.314 * 330.

Calculate 1.23 * 8.314 first.

Let me compute that.

1.23 *8=9.84.

1.23 *0.314= let's compute 0.314 *1.23.

0.3 *1.23=0.369.

0.014*1.23=0.01722.

So 0.369 + 0.01722 = 0.38622.

So 8 *1.23=9.84, 0.314 *1.23=0.38622.

So total is 9.84 +0.38622 = 10.22622.

So 1.23 *8.314 = approx 10.2262.

Now multiply by 330.

10.2262 *330: 10 *330=3300, 0.2262 *330= approx 74.7.

So total is 3300 +74.7= 3374.7.

So numerator is 3374.7, denominator is 20.

So M=3374.7 /20 = 168.735 g/mol.

So approximately 168.74 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 169 g/mol. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure about the exact calculation.

Compute 1.23 *8.314 = ?

Let me compute 1.23 * 8 =9.84.

1.23 *0.314: let's compute 1.23 * 0.3=0.369, 1.23*0.014=0.01722. So 0.38622.

So 9.84 +0.38622=10.22622.

Then 10.22622 *330.

10 *330=3300.

0.22622 *330: 0.2 *330=66, 0.02622 *330=8.653 (approx 8.65). So 66+8.65=74.65.

So 3300 +74.65=3374.65.

Divide by 20: 3374.65 /20 = 168.8325 g/mol.

So approximately 168.83 g/mol, which is closest to option A:169 g/mol.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine the molar mass of the gaseous compound, we use the formula derived from the ideal gas law:

\[
M = \frac{d \cdot R \cdot T}{P}
\]

Where:
- \(d\) is the density of the gas,
- \(R\) is the gas constant,
- \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \(P\) is the pressure in kPa.

### Step 1: Convert the density
The given density is \(1.23 \, \mathrm{kg/m^3}\). Since \(1 \, \mathrm{kg/m^3} = 1 \, \mathrm{g/L}\), the density in appropriate units is:

\[
d = 1.23 \, \mathrm{g/L}
\]

### Step 2: Use the gas constant \(R\)
The gas constant \(R\) in units of \(\mathrm{L \cdot kPa / (mol \cdot K)}\) is:

\[
R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{L \cdot kPa / (mol \cdot K)}
\]

### Step 3: Plug in the values
Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[
M = \frac{(1.23 \, \mathrm{g/L}) \cdot (8.314 \, \mathrm{L \cdot kPa / (mol \cdot K)}) \cdot (330 \, \mathrm{K})}{20 \, \mathrm{kPa}}
\]

#### Step 3.1: Compute the numerator
\[
1.23 \cdot 8.314 = 10.22622
\]
\[
10.22622 \cdot 330 = 3374.65
\]

So, the numerator is approximately:

\[
3374.65 \, \mathrm{g \cdot kPa / mol}
\]

#### Step 3.2: Divide by the pressure
\[
M = \frac{3374.65}{20} = 168.83 \, \mathrm{g/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated molar mass is approximately \(168.83 \, \mathrm{g/mol}\), which is closest to option **A: 169 \, \mathrm{g/mol}\).

ANSWER: A
