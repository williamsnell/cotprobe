Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the smallest time T such that the absolute value of y(t) is less than 0.1 for all t greater than T. The equation given is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The initial conditions are y(0)=1 and y'(0)=0. And a is given as 1. 

First, I remember that for linear ODEs with constant coefficients, the solution can be found by finding the characteristic equation. So I should start by writing down the characteristic equation for this ODE.

The ODE is y'' + 2a y' + (a² +1)y = 0. Plugging a=1 into this, the equation becomes y'' + 2*1*y' + (1² +1)y = 0, which simplifies to y'' + 2y' + 2y = 0.

The characteristic equation for this would be r² + 2r + 2 = 0. To find the roots, I can use the quadratic formula: r = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a is 1, b is 2, and c is 2. So the discriminant is (2)^2 -4*1*2 = 4-8 = -4.

Since the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex conjugates. So r = [-2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [-2 ± 2i]/2 = -1 ± i. So the roots are -1+i and -1-i.

I remember that when the roots are complex, the general solution is of the form e^(α t) [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)], where α and β are the real and imaginary parts of the root, respectively. So here, α is -1 and β is 1.

So the general solution should be y(t) = e^(-t) [C1 cos(t) + C2 sin(t)]. Now I need to apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2.

First initial condition: y(0) = 1. Plugging t=0 into the solution, e^0 is 1, so y(0)= C1*1 + C2*0 = C1. Therefore, C1 =1.

Next, the second initial condition is y'(0)=0. I need to find the derivative of y(t) to use this. So let's compute y'(t):

y'(t) = d/dt [e^(-t) (C1 cos t + C2 sin t)]
Using the product rule, this is e^(-t) [ - (C1 cos t + C2 sin t) ) + ( -C1 sin t + C2 cos t ) ].

Simplify that: e^(-t) [ -C1 cos t - C2 sin t - C1 sin t + C2 cos t ]
Grouping like terms:
= e^(-t) [ (-C1 + C2) cos t + (-C1 - C2) sin t ]

At t=0, y'(0)=0. So plugging t=0 into y'(t):

y'(0) = [ (-C1 + C2 ) *1 + (-C1 - C2)*0 ] * e^0
= (-C1 + C2) *1 *1
So (-C1 + C2) =0.

We already know C1 is 1, so substituting:

-1 + C2 =0 → C2=1.

So the solution is y(t) = e^(-t) [ cos(t) + sin(t) ].

But wait, I think I can write this more neatly. There's an identity that A cos(t) + B sin(t) can be written as C cos(t - φ), where C is sqrt(A² + B²) and tan φ = B/A. Let me calculate that.

In this case, A=1, B=1. So the amplitude C is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). The phase shift φ is arctan(1/1)=45 degrees or π/4 radians. So y(t) can be written as sqrt(2) e^(-t) cos(t - π/4).

But maybe for the purpose of finding when |y(t)| < 0.1, using the original form is easier. Alternatively, the envelope of the solution is e^(-t) multiplied by a oscillating term with amplitude sqrt(2). So the maximum |y(t)| would be sqrt(2) e^(-t), because the cosine term is bounded between -1 and 1. So the envelope is sqrt(2) e^{-t}, so the actual y(t) is within plus or minus that.

Wait, but wait. Wait, y(t) is e^{-t} (cos t + sin t). Let me compute the exact expression. 

Alternatively, since the exponential term is decaying and the oscillation's amplitude is also modulated by it, the maximum value of |y(t)| occurs when cos(t) + sin(t) is at its maximum. Since cos(t) + sin(t) can be written as sqrt(2) sin(t + π/4), which has a maximum of sqrt(2) and a minimum of -sqrt(2). So the maximum value of |y(t)| is sqrt(2) e^{-t}.

So to find when |y(t)| < 0.1, I can set sqrt(2) e^{-t} = 0.1 and solve for t. Because beyond that t, the exponential decay will ensure that the oscillations are within 0.1.

So let's set sqrt(2) e^{-t} = 0.1.

Divide both sides by sqrt(2): e^{-t} = 0.1 / sqrt(2).

Take natural logarithm of both sides: -t = ln(0.1 / sqrt(2)).

Multiply both sides by -1: t = - ln(0.1 / sqrt(2)).

Computing the value:

First, compute 0.1 / sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is about 1.4142, 0.1 /1.4142 ≈ 0.07071.

Then, take the natural logarithm of that: ln(0.07071) ≈ Let me compute. I know ln(1)=0, ln(e)=1, and e is about 2.718. So ln(0.07071) is negative. Let me get the exact value.

Wait, 0.07071 is approximately e^-2.7, because e^-2 is about 0.1353, e^-3 is about 0.0498. So 0.07071 is between e^-2.7 and e^-2.6. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using calculator-like steps:

ln(0.07071) = ln(7.071e-2) = ln(7.071) + ln(1e-2) - Wait, no: 0.07071 = 7.071 * 10^-2, so ln(7.071) is about ln(7) is 1.9459, and 7.071 is sqrt(50)≈7.071, so ln(7.071)≈1.956. So ln(7.071 *10^-2) = ln(7.071) + ln(10^-2) = 1.956 - 4.605 ≈ -2.649.

So ln(0.07071) ≈ -2.649.

Thus, t = - (-2.649) = 2.649.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because 0.07071 is 0.1/sqrt(2)=0.1/1.4142≈0.07071. So ln(0.07071) would be negative.

So t = - ln(0.07071) = 2.649. So approximately 2.65.

Looking at the options, I see that option F is 2.1345, option I is 2.3754, option H is 2.0, option J is 1.6520, and option E is about 2.718, which is e. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options given:

A: 3.1415 (π)
B: 3.0000
C: 1.8763
D: 1.5708 (π/2)
E: 2.7183 (e)
F: 2.1345
G: 0.7854 (π/4)
H: 2.0000
I: 2.3754
J: 1.6520

I computed t≈2.649. But none of the options exactly match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should not approximate using the envelope but instead find the exact maximum. Because the oscillation could cause y(t) to sometimes be above and sometimes below the envelope. So perhaps the first time when y(t) crosses below 0.1 and stays there is when the envelope drops below 0.1. Or maybe y(t) could dip below 0.1 earlier due to the oscillation, but then go above again. So perhaps the safest approach is to find when the envelope is less than 0.1, ensuring that |y(t)| will always be below 0.1 after that point.

Alternatively, perhaps I should solve for when y(t) equals 0.1, considering the oscillation. Wait, but that might be complicated because the solution is a decaying oscillation. Alternatively, perhaps the exact solution is y(t)=sqrt(2) e^{-t} cos(t - π/4), as I thought earlier.

So the maximum of |y(t)| is sqrt(2) e^{-t}, so I can set that equal to 0.1 and solve for t.

So sqrt(2) e^{-t} = 0.1 → e^{-t} = 0.1 / sqrt(2) → t = - ln(0.1 / sqrt(2)).

Compute 0.1 / sqrt(2) ≈ 0.07071.

ln(0.07071) ≈ -2.645. So t ≈2.645. Hmm, but the options don't have exactly this number. Let me check the options again. The closest is option I: 2.3754, which is lower than 2.645. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the envelope. Let me think again. Wait, when I have y(t) = e^{-t} (cos t + sin t), the amplitude of the oscillation is sqrt( (cos t + sin t)^2 ) averaged over time, but the maximum amplitude at any time t is actually sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 )=sqrt(2), right? Because the maximum of (cos t + sin t) is sqrt(2), as I thought earlier.

So the envelope is indeed sqrt(2) e^{-t}, so the maximum possible |y(t)| is sqrt(2) e^{-t}, so when that is less than 0.1, |y(t)| will be less than 0.1 for all t beyond that point. So solving sqrt(2) e^{-t} = 0.1 gives t=ln(sqrt(2)/0.1). Wait, let's compute that correctly.

Wait, sqrt(2) e^{-t} = 0.1 → e^{-t} = 0.1 / sqrt(2) → take natural log: -t = ln(0.1) - 0.5 ln(2), since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the exact value:

e^{-t} = 0.1 / sqrt(2) → t = - ln(0.1 / sqrt(2)).

Compute 0.1 / sqrt(2) = 0.07071067811865476.

ln(0.07071067811865476) = let me compute using known values. I know that ln(0.1) is about -2.302585, and ln(1/sqrt(2)) is about -0.346574. So ln(0.07071) = ln(0.1 * 1/sqrt(2)) )= ln(0.1) + ln(1/sqrt(2))= (-2.302585) + (-0.693147/2)= -2.302585 -0.346574 ≈-2.64916.

So t = - (-2.64916) = 2.64916. So approximately 2.649.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option I: 2.3754, but that's lower than 2.649. Hmm, none of the options exactly match. Let me see if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.07071067811865476.

So ln(0.0707106781) = ?

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator: the natural logarithm of 0.07071 is approximately -2.645. So t is approximately 2.645.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the intended answer is option I: 2.3754, but that's lower. Alternatively, perhaps I should not have approximated the maximum as sqrt(2) e^{-t}, but perhaps the actual solution might dip below 0.1 earlier because of the oscillation, and then rise again. So perhaps I should find the times when y(t) = 0.1 and find the last such time, beyond which y(t) stays below 0.1.

But that's more complicated. Let me think about solving y(t) = 0.1.

Given y(t) = e^{-t} (cos t + sin t) = 0.1.

I need to solve e^{-t} (cos t + sin t) = 0.1.

This equation is transcendental, meaning it can't be solved exactly with algebra, so I'll have to approximate the solution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write y(t) as sqrt(2) e^{-t} cos(t - π/4), as I did earlier. So setting that equal to 0.1:

sqrt(2) e^{-t} cos(t - π/4) = 0.1.

We can write this as e^{-t} cos(t - π/4) = 0.1 / sqrt(2) ≈ 0.07071.

But solving this exactly for t isn't straightforward. So maybe I can use numerical methods or trial and error with the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the envelope is sqrt(2) e^{-t}, so when sqrt(2) e^{-t} =0.1, that gives t ≈2.645 as before. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong and I should have considered the actual y(t) function decaying and oscillating, and perhaps the maximums of y(t) occur at specific points. Wait, let me find the maximum points of y(t).

To find the maxima of y(t), I can take the derivative and set it to zero. Wait, but I already computed y'(t) earlier as e^{-t} [ (-C1 + C2) cos t + (-C1 - C2) sin t ].

Wait, with C1=1 and C2=1, y'(t) becomes:

y'(t) = e^{-t} [ (-1 +1) cos t + (-1 -1) sin t ] = e^{-t} [0 * cos t -2 sin t ] = -2 e^{-t} sin t.

Set y'(t) = 0 → -2 e^{-t} sin t = 0. Since e^{-t} is never zero, sin t = 0 → t = nπ, where n is integer.

So the extrema (maxima and minima) occur at t=0, π, 2π, etc. Let me compute y(t) at these points.

At t=0: y(0)=1.

At t=π: y(π) = e^{-π} [cos π + sin π] = e^{-π} [ (-1) + 0 ] = -e^{-π} ≈ -0.0432.

Wait, so at t=π (~3.1416), y(t) is about -0.0432, which is less than -0.1 in magnitude? No, wait, 0.0432 is less than 0.1.

Wait, wait: 0.0432 is less than 0.1, so |y(π)|=0.0432 <0.1. So that's actually below 0.1. But wait, then the next maximum before that would have been at t=π/2, let me check.

Wait, no, because the maxima occur at t=0, π, 2π, etc. At t=π, y(t) is negative and at about -0.0432. So the magnitude is 0.0432, which is less than 0.1. Hmm, so perhaps the function never exceeds 0.1 after t=0.

Wait, but wait, at t=0, y=1, which is way above 0.1, then it starts to decay. So perhaps the first time y(t) reaches 0.1 is between t=0 and t=π. But wait, when I computed using the envelope, I found that at t≈2.645, the envelope is 0.1. But according to y(π)= -0.0432, which is less than 0.1 in magnitude. So perhaps the function crosses 0.1 somewhere before π, but then continues to lower values.

Wait, but this seems conflicting. Let me compute y(t) at t=2.645. Let me compute sqrt(2) e^{-t} ≈ 1.4142 * e^{-2.645}.

Compute e^{-2.645}: e^2 is about 7.389, so e^2.645 is approximately e^2 * e^0.645. e^0.645 is about e^0.6=1.8221, e^0.645≈1.906. So e^2.645≈7.389 *1.906≈14.085. So e^{-2.645}=1/14.085≈0.07099. So sqrt(2)*0.07099≈1.4142*0.07099≈0.1003. So that's how I set the envelope equal to
