Question:

A college student owns an expensive sports car. His friend called him up one afternoon and asked to borrow his car for a date he had that night. The college student generously lent the car to his friend. On his way home from the date, basking in the memories of a beautiful evening, the friend lost control of the car and hit a pedestrian. As a result of the accident, and after learning that the friend had no money and no insurance, the pedestrian brought suit against the college student to recover for his injuries. He asserted a claim against the college student for negligent entrustment of a vehicle. During his case, the pedestrian introduced evidence that the friend had been in several previous accidents. In his defense, the college student offered the testimony of his girlfriend that the college student frequently lent his car to his friend. The girlfriend further testified that the college student gave his friend permission to use his car only after determining that the friend was a careful and attentive driver. The girlfriend's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as evidence of the friend's driving skill.
B: inadmissible, because it's irrelevant to the case.
C: admissible as a present sense impression.
D: inadmissible, because it's hearsay.
E: inadmissible, because it's opinion testimony.
F: admissible as a past recollection recorded.
G: admissible as character evidence.
H: admissible as evidence of habit.
I: inadmissible, because she is biased.
J: inadmissible, because it goes to the college student's character.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay and what's admissible in court. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a college student who lends his expensive sports car to a friend. The friend ends up hitting a pedestrian, and the pedestrian sues the college student for negligent entrustment. The pedestrian's case includes evidence that the friend had several previous accidents. The college student's defense includes testimony from his girlfriend. She says he often lends the car to the friend and that he only does so after checking that the friend is careful and attentive.

The question is about whether the girlfriend's testimony is admissible and under which category.

First, I need to understand what negligent entrustment is. From what I remember, negligent entrustment is when someone lends a thing (like a car) to another person who is known to be unfit or likely to cause harm. So the plaintiff here is arguing that the college student knew or should have known that his friend was a bad driver, hence negligent in lending the car.

Now, the girlfriend's testimony is about two things: that the college student often lent the car to the friend, and that he checked the friend's driving skill before lending. The pedestrian is suing, so the defense is trying to show that the college student acted reasonably by checking the friend's driving habits.

The options are about whether this testimony is admissible and the reason.

Looking at the options, I see that option H says it's admissible as evidence of habit. Habit is one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Habit refers to a person's regular practice of responding to a specific situation. So if the college student had a regular practice of checking the friend's driving before lending the car, that could be habit evidence.

Wait, but the girlfriend's testimony is about the college student's habit, right? She's saying he frequently lent the car and that each time he determined the friend was careful. So that's about the college student's routine or regular practice when lending the car.

Habit is admissible under FRE 406, I think. It's used to prove that a person acted in accordance with their habit on a particular occasion. So if the college student had a habit of checking, then on this occasion (when he lent the car), he likely checked, which would support his defense against negligent entrustment.

But wait, the girlfriend's testimony is about what the college student did each time he lent the car, which is a specific pattern. That would be habit, not just a character trait. Because habit is about specific, repetitive actions, whereas character is more about general disposition.

So option H says it's admissible as evidence of habit. That makes sense because the testimony is about the college student's regular practice of checking the friend's driving before lending the car.

Other options: Option A says it's admissible as evidence of the friend's driving skill. But the testimony is about the college student's actions, not directly about the friend's actual skill. It's about the student's assessment, but not evidence of the friend's skill itself. So A might not be correct.

Option D is about hearsay, but the girlfriend is testifying about her own observations of the college student's behavior, so it's not hearsay. She's not repeating something someone else said; she's recounting what she saw the college student do repeatedly.

Option B says it's irrelevant. But the testimony goes to the defense's claim that he acted carefully, so it's relevant to the negligent entrustment claim.

Option E is about opinion testimony. The girlfriend isn't giving an opinion; she's stating facts about what the college student did each time he lent the car.

Option G is character evidence. If it were about the college student's general character as a careful person, that might be character evidence, but here it's about specific habits related to lending the car, so it's habit, not character.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: admissible as evidence of habit.

The girlfriend's testimony is admissible as evidence of the college student's habit of checking the friend's driving skills before lending the car. This testimony demonstrates a regular practice, which is relevant to the defense against negligent entrustment. It is not hearsay because she is testifying about her own observations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: admissible as evidence of habit.**

H
