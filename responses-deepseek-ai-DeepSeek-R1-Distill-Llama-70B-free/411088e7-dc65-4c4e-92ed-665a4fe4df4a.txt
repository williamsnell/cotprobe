Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the sum of the digits of n, where n is the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the two smallest 3-digit primes. I remember that the smallest 3-digit number is 100, but wait, is 100 a prime? No, because it's divisible by 2 and 5. So I have to find the next number after 100 that's prime.

Let me think. The numbers after 100 are 101, 102, and so on. Is 101 a prime? I think it is. Because 101 is only divisible by 1 and itself. Let me check. Divided by 2? No, it's odd. Divided by 3? 3*33 is 99, 3*34 is 102, so no. 5? Ends with 1, so no. 7? 7*14 is 98, 7*15 is 105, so no. I don't think 101 has any divisors other than 1 and 101. So yes, 101 is prime.

So the first smallest 3-digit prime is 101. What's the next one? After 101 comes 102, but that's even, so not prime. 103? Let's check if 103 is prime. Divided by 2? No. Divided by 3? 3*34=102, 3*35=105, so no. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 7*14=98, 7*15=105, so no. 11? 11*9=99, 11*10=110, so no. So 103 is also prime.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. I thought 101 was the first, but wait, no. Let me make sure. What about 107, 109? No, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, 101 is the first, then 103 is the second. So the two smallest 3-digit primes are 101 and 103.

Wait, wait again. No, wait. Oh wait, 101 is the first, then 103 is the next. But wait, what about 107? No, 103 comes before 107. So the two smallest are 101 and 103.

Wait a second, am I missing something? Oh no, wait! What's the two-digit primes? Oh wait, no, the question is about three-digit primes. So the primes just above 100 are 101, 103, then 107, 109, etc.

So n is 101 multiplied by 103. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 101 * 103. Let's see, I can think of this as (100 + 1) * (100 + 3) = 100*100 + 100*3 + 1*100 + 1*3 = 10000 + 300 + 100 + 3 = 10403.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me do the multiplication another way to check. 101 times 100 is 10100, and 101 times 3 is 303. So 10100 + 303 = 10403. Yep, that's correct.

So n is 10403. Now I need to find the sum of its digits. Let's write out the number: 1 0 4 0 3.

Adding each digit: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3. That's 1 + 4 =5, 5 + 3=8. So the sum is 8.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A:8, B:9, etc. So the answer should be A:8.

Wait a second, but wait another moment. Did I get the two primes right? Let me make sure. The two smallest three-digit primes are 101 and 103. Let me think of primes in order. After 97 (which is a two-digit prime), the next primes are 101, then 103, then 107, 109, 113, etc. So yes, 101 and 103 are correct.

So n=101*103=10403. Sum of digits: 1+0+4+0+3=8. So the answer is A.
</think>

The two smallest 3-digit prime numbers are 101 and 103. Their product is calculated as:

\[
101 \times 103 = 10403
\]

The sum of the digits of \( n = 10403 \) is:

\[
1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 8
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

A: 8

Answer: A
