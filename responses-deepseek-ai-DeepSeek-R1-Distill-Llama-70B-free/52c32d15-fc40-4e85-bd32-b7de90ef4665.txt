Question:

In the procedure Mystery below, the parameter number is a positive integer.

 PROCEDURE Mystery (number)
 {
  REPEAT UNTIL (number <= 0)
  {
   number ← number - 2
  }
  IF (number = 0)
  {
   RETURN (true)
  }
  ELSE
  {
   RETURN (false)
  }
 }

 Which of the following best describes the result of running the procedure Mystery?

Options:

A: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is a multiple of 2 or 3, and it otherwise returns false.
B: The procedure returns false when the initial value of number is greater than 2, and it otherwise returns true.
C: The procedure returns false when the initial value of number is a prime number, and it otherwise returns true.
D: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is odd, and it otherwise returns false.
E: The procedure returns false when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns true.
F: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is less than 2, and it otherwise returns false.
G: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false.
H: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is 2, and it otherwise returns false.
I: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is a prime number, and it otherwise returns false.
J: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is greater than 2, and it otherwise returns false.

Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about this procedure called Mystery, and I need to figure out what it does based on the given code. The question is a multiple-choice, and I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's read the code carefully. The procedure takes a parameter called number, which is a positive integer. The code inside is a loop and an if-else statement.

The procedure starts with a REPEAT UNTIL loop. The condition is until number is less than or equal to zero. Inside the loop, number is decreased by 2 each time. So every iteration subtracts 2 from number, and this continues until number drops to zero or below.

Wait, no, actually the loop is REPEAT UNTIL (number <=0). So the loop runs as long as number is greater than 0. Because once number becomes 0 or less, it stops.

So what's happening? Let's think about some examples.

Let's say number is 4. The loop runs:

First iteration: 4-2=2 (number is 2, which is >0, so loop again.
Second iteration: 2-2=0 (number is 0, so loop stops.

Then, check if number is 0. It is, so return true.

Another example: number is 3.

First iteration: 3-2=1. Number is 1, loop again.
Second iteration: 1-2= -1. Now number is <=0, loop stops.

Check if number is 0? It's -1, so no. So return false.

Another example: number is 2.

Loop: subtract 2 → 0. So number is 0. Return true.

What about number is 1?

Loop: subtract 2 → -1. So loop stops. Number is -1, which isn't 0. So return false.

Wait, but what if the initial number is 0? But the problem says number is a positive integer, so that case isn't considered.

So what's the pattern here? Let's see.

If the initial number is even, does the procedure return true? Let's test:

number = 6 → loops 3 times, ends at 0 → return true.

number = 5 → loops:

5 →3 →1 →-1. Number is -1, so returns false.

So yes, seems like when the number is even, it returns true. Because subtracting 2 each time will eventually reach 0 if the starting number is even. But for odd numbers, subtracting 2 each time will make it odd each time until it goes below zero, ending at an odd negative number, so number isn't zero, hence return false.

Wait, but wait: let me think about number=0. But the parameter is positive, so we don't have to consider that.

So the function returns true if the initial number is even, else false. Because for even numbers, subtracting 2 each time will hit zero exactly, making number=0, so return true. For odd numbers, you can't reach zero by subtracting 2 each time because you end up at 1, then subtract 2 to get -1, which stops the loop, and then number is not zero, so return false.

So the procedure returns true if the initial number is even, else false.

Looking at the options:

Option G: returns true when initial number is even, else false. That's exactly what we concluded.

Option D: returns true when initial is odd; that's the opposite.

Option E: returns false when even. No, that's wrong.

So the correct answer should be G.

Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's test another number. Let's say number is 8:

8-2=6 →4 →2 →0 → loop stops. Return true.

Number is 7:

7-2=5 →3 →1 →-1 → loop stops. Not zero, return false.

Yep, that's correct.

So the correct option is G.

The procedure `Mystery` takes a positive integer `number` as input and repeatedly subtracts 2 from it until `number` becomes less than or equal to 0. After exiting the loop, it checks if `number` is exactly 0. If so, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Analyzing the behavior:

1. If the initial `number` is even, subtracting 2 repeatedly will eventually reduce it to 0 (e.g., 4 → 2 → 0). In this case, the procedure returns `true`.
2. If the initial `number` is odd, subtracting 2 repeatedly will never make it 0. Instead, it will become -1 (e.g., 3 → 1 → -1). In this case, the procedure returns `false`.

Thus, the procedure returns `true` if and only if the initial `number` is even.

From the given options, the correct description is:

**G: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false.**

Answer: G
