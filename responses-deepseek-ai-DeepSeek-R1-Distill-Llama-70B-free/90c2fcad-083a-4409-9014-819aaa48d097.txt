Okay, so I've got this question about tariffs and how they're imposed. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that tariffs can be imposed either for protective purposes or to raise revenue, and there are two different methods. I need to define these two methods and give an example of each.

Hmm, I remember that tariffs are taxes on imported goods. But the way they're applied can vary. I think there are two main types. One is based on the value of the item, and the other is a fixed amount per unit. Wait, let me get this straight.

So, the first type is ad valorem. Ad valorem means "according to value" in Latin, I believe. So that would mean the tariff is a percentage of the item's value. For example, if a tariff is 10% ad valorem on a car worth $10,000, the tariff would be $1,000. That makes sense because it's proportional to the value of the item.

The second type is specific tariffs. Specific tariffs are a fixed amount per unit of the imported good. So, for instance, if the tariff is $5 per pair of shoes, then each pair imported would have a $5 tax, regardless of their value. So whether the shoes are cheap or expensive, the tariff is the same per unit.

Wait, the question also asks for the two methods and examples. So the options are looking for the terms and then examples. Let me look at the options provided.

Option B is Ad valorem and specific. That matches what I was thinking. Ad valorem is based on value, and specific is per unit. So that's probably the correct answer.

Let me just make sure I'm not mixing up any terms. Are there other types of tariffs? I think there's also something called a compound tariff, which combines both ad valorem and specific, but the question is only asking about the two main methods, so B should be correct.

Examples: For ad valorem, maybe a 10% tariff on electronics. For specific, maybe $2 per kilogram of coffee imported. That fits.

Looking back at the options, option B is the only one that correctly identifies these two methods. So I'm confident that B is the right answer.
