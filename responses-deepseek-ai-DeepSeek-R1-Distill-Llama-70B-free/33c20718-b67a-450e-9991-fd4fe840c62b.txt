Question:

On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. If the mother asserts a wrongful death action against the doctor, she will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.
B: not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.
C: not prevail, because the hospital, not the doctor, is responsible for the errors of its employees.
D: prevail, because the doctor had a duty of care to ensure the correct blood type was administered.
E: prevail, because the doctor's failure to follow the hospital's rules indirectly led to the father's death.
F: not prevail, because the doctor did not personally administer the wrong blood type.
G: not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.
H: not prevail, because the doctor gave correct instructions to the nurse.
I: prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.
J: prevail, because the doctor should have ensured that the nurse followed the hospital's rule for blood transfusion orders.

Okay, so I've got this question about a medical malpractice case, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let's break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is on Thanksgiving Day, a father cuts his hand while carving a turkey. The knife severs an artery, so he loses a lot of blood. The mother calls their family doctor, who tells them to go to the hospital and says he'll meet them there. At the hospital, the doctor treats the father's hand and decides a blood transfusion is needed because of the blood loss. The father's blood type is A-positive, so the doctor tells a nurse (who's employed by the hospital) to get the blood. The nurse calls the blood bank and orders A-positive. But someone at the blood bank messes up, sending B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive. The father gets the wrong blood and dies.

The question is about whether the mother can successfully sue the doctor for wrongful death. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to understand the legal concepts here. It seems like a case involving negligence and possibly vicarious liability. The key issues are: who is responsible for the error, and did the doctor breach any duty of care.

The hospital has a rule that all blood transfusion orders must be in writing by the physician. But the doctor didn't follow that rule; he gave oral instructions instead. However, many other doctors at the hospital do the same, so maybe it's a common practice there.

So, the mistake happened at the blood bank, but the nurse was following the doctor's oral order. The problem is that the blood bank sent the wrong type, which was mislabeled. But the root cause seems to be the incorrect labeling, which might be the blood bank's error.

Now, the possible defendants here are the doctor, the nurse, the blood bank staff, and the hospital. But the question is specifically about suing the doctor.

In terms of legal theories, the doctor could be liable if he was negligent. Negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and harm. The doctor had a duty to ensure the patient received proper care. Did he breach that duty by not following the hospital's rule of getting a written order?

But the issue is whether that breach directly caused the harm. The doctor gave the correct oral instructions (A-positive), and the nurse followed by ordering A-positive. The error was at the blood bank when they sent B-positive mislabeled as A-positive. So the mistake wasn't in the ordering, but in the fulfillment.

I remember that in medical malpractice, the key is whether the healthcare provider's action or inaction was the proximate cause of the injury. Here, the doctor's action was giving an oral order instead of written. But the hospital's rule is about written orders to prevent errors. However, in this case, the error occurred not because of the oral order, but because the blood bank made a mistake.

So, the doctor's breach of the hospital's rule (not using a written order) might not have directly caused the wrong blood being administered. The nurse did correctly order A-positive. The problem was that the blood bank sent the wrong blood, perhaps due to their own negligence.

Another point is vicarious liability. The nurse was a hospital employee, so the hospital would be vicariously liable for her actions. But the blood bank employees are also hospital employees, so again, the hospital is liable, not the doctor.

So, the doctor's potential liability would hinge on whether his failure to follow the hospital's rule caused the error. But in this case, the error wasn't due to the oral order, since the order was correctly placed as A-positive. The mistake was in the blood bank's handling.

Therefore, the doctor didn't cause the error. The error was the blood bank's mistake. So, the mother can't hold the doctor liable because his action (oral order) didn't lead to the wrong blood being sent. The nurse followed the correct order, and the blood bank messed up.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the doctor is responsible because the blood bank's error led to the wrong blood. But the blood bank is the hospital's responsibility, not the doctor's. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says the mother won't prevail because the blood bank person wasn't the doctor's employee. That makes sense because vicarious liability is about the employer being responsible for their employees' actions. The blood bank staff aren't the doctor's employees, so the doctor isn't liable for their mistake. So B is a possible correct answer.

Option C says the hospital, not the doctor, is responsible. That's correct, but the question is about suing the doctor, so C might not directly answer why the mother wouldn't prevail against the doctor.

Option D says the doctor had a duty to ensure the correct blood type was administered. While that's true, the question is whether he breached that duty. He did order the correct type, just orally. The breach was not following the rule, but that didn't cause the error. So D might not be the right reason.

Option E suggests the doctor's failure to follow the rule indirectly caused the death. But if the oral order didn't lead to the error, then E is incorrect.

Option F says the doctor didn't administer the blood, so he's not liable. That's a possible point, but it's more about causation than the act itself.

Option H says because the doctor acted like others, he's not liable. That's about standard practice, but if the standard practice is negligent, that's not a defense. So H is probably wrong.

Option I says the mother would prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule. But again, the rule violation didn't cause the error, so I isn't correct.

Option J says the doctor should have ensured the nurse followed the rule. But the rule was about the doctor's responsibility, not the nurse's. The nurse followed the doctor's order correctly.

So, putting it together, the key is that the doctor's action (oral order) didn't cause the error. The blood bank made a mistake that the doctor couldn't have foreseen. Therefore, the mother can't hold the doctor liable. The hospital would be liable, but the question is about the doctor.

So, the correct answer is likely B: not prevail because the blood bank person wasn't the doctor's employee.

The question revolves around whether the doctor can be held liable for the father's death due to the administration of the wrong blood type. The key legal issues are negligence, duty of care, and causation. The doctor had a duty to ensure proper care but did not follow the hospital's rule requiring written orders for blood transfusions. However, the error occurred at the blood bank, where an unidentified employee mislabeled the blood. The nurse correctly followed the doctor's oral instructions to order A-positive blood, and the mistake was not due to the oral order but the blood bank's negligence.

The doctor's failure to follow the hospital's rule (oral order instead of written) did not directly cause the error, as the order was correct, and the mistake occurred later in the process. The blood bank employees are hospital staff, making the hospital responsible for their actions under vicarious liability, not the doctor. The doctor's breach of the hospital's rule did not proximately cause the harm, as the error was independent of his actions.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The doctor is not responsible for the blood bank's error, as it was not under his control.
- **B**: Correct. The mother cannot prevail because the blood bank employee, whose error caused the harm, was not the doctor's employee.
- **C**: Incorrect. While the hospital is responsible for its employees, the question focuses on the doctor's liability.
- **D**: Incorrect. The doctor's duty to ensure the correct blood type was fulfilled; the error occurred elsewhere.
- **E**: Incorrect. The doctor's failure to follow the rule did not indirectly cause the error.
- **F**: Incorrect. The doctor's lack of personal administration is not the key issue; causation is.
- **H**: Incorrect. Standard practice does not excuse negligence, but the doctor's actions did not cause the harm.
- **I**: Incorrect. The rule violation did not lead to the error.
- **J**: Incorrect. The doctor is not responsible for ensuring the nurse followed the rule, as the rule pertains to his own actions.

The correct answer is **B**, as the blood bank employee's error was not attributable to the doctor. 

Answer: B
