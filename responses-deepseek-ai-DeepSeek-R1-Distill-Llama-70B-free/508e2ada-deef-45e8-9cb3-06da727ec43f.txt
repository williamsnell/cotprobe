Question:

A manufacturer of ready-bake cake mixes is interested in designing an experiment to test the effects of four different temperature levels (300, 325, 350, and 375F), two different types of pans (glass and metal), and three different types of ovens (gas, electric, and microwave) on the texture of its cakes, in all combinations. Which of the following below is the best description of the design of the necessary experiment?

Options:

A: A randomized block design, blocked on temperature and type of pan, with 12 treatment groups
B: A completely randomized design with 6 treatment groups
C: A randomized block design, blocked on type of oven, with 24 treatment groups
D: A randomized block design, blocked on temperature, with six treatment groups
E: A completely randomized design with 18 treatment groups
F: A randomized block design, blocked on type of oven, with 12 treatment groups
G: A completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups
H: A randomized block design, blocked on type of pan, with 12 treatment groups
I: A completely randomized design with 12 treatment groups
J: A completely randomized design with nine treatment groups

Okay, so I've got this question about experimental design, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down the question. 

The scenario is a manufacturer testing cake mixes. They want to see how different factors affect the texture of the cakes. The factors they're looking at are temperature levels, types of pans, and types of ovens. Specifically, the temperatures are 300, 325, 350, and 375F. So that's four levels. Then there are two types of pans: glass and metal. And three types of ovens: gas, electric, and microwave.

The question is asking what kind of experimental design they should use to test all combinations of these factors. And then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm. So first, I need to think about the different kinds of experimental designs. The main ones I remember are completely randomized design (CRD), randomized block design (RBD), Latin squares, factorial designs, etc. 

In a completely randomized design, all the treatments are randomly assigned to the experimental units without any blocking. That is, every possible treatment is applied, and the subjects are randomly assigned. On the other hand, a randomized block design involves grouping subjects into blocks where each block contains subjects that are similar in some way, and then randomly assigning treatments within each block. This helps control for variation from the blocking factor.

Now, the question is about testing all combinations of the factors. So temperature has 4 levels, pan has 2, and oven has 3. The total number of treatment groups would be the product of these: 4 * 2 * 3 = 24. So each combination of temperature, pan, and oven is a different treatment. 

Looking at the options, let's see. The options mention things like treatment groups, whether it's completely randomized or blocked, and what's being blocked.

Option G says a completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups. That sounds like all possible combinations are being tested, each as a separate treatment. So if they have 24 different treatment groups and it's completely randomized, that fits. Because in CRD, each treatment is independent and assigned randomly.

Wait, but what about blocking? If they choose a randomized block design, what would that imply? The blocking would be done on a factor that they think affects the response but isn't part of the treatment factors they're testing. So for instance, if they thought that different batches of cake mix might affect the result, they could block on batches. But in this question, the factors they're testing are the variables (temp, pan, oven). So unless there's another factor they're concerned about, blocking isn't necessary. 

Wait, but the question says the experiment is testing all combinations. So it's a factorial design—specifically a 4x2x3 factorial, which results in 24 treatments.

Now, looking at the options again. Option G is a completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups. That makes sense because each combination is a treatment, and all are randomized.

Let me check the other options. Option A: blocked on temp and pan, 12 treatments. Wait, 4 temps, 2 pans, so 8 possible temp-pan combinations. But 12 doesn't fit. Maybe not.

Option E: CRD with 18 groups. 4*2*3 is 24, so 18 isn't right.

Option I: CRD with 12. No, 12 is less than 24. So that's not it.

So the correct design is a completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups. So the correct answer should be option G.

The experiment involves testing the effects of four temperature levels (300, 325, 350, and 375°F), two types of pans (glass and metal), and three types of ovens (gas, electric, and microwave) on the texture of cakes, with all combinations of these factors considered. This results in a total of \(4 \times 2 \times 3 = 24\) treatment groups. 

The question asks for the best description of the experimental design. A completely randomized design (CRD) is appropriate here because all possible combinations of the factors are being tested, and the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units without blocking. Since the factors being tested (temperature, pan, and oven) are the variables of interest, there is no need for blocking unless an additional factor is identified that could influence the results.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option G** correctly describes the design as a completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups, which matches the factorial nature of the experiment.
- Other options either misrepresent the number of treatment groups or incorrectly suggest blocking on factors that are already part of the treatment variables.

Thus, the best description of the experimental design is a completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups.

Answer: G
