Okay, so I've got this economics question here about Adam Smith and Ricardo. I'm a bit rusty on my economic theories, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking how Ricardo modified Adam Smith's theory on free trade. Adam Smith argued for free trade based on economic efficiency, saying goods should be produced where they can be made with the fewest resources. That sounds familiarâ€”Smith's idea was about absolute advantage, right? Absolute advantage is when one country can produce a good more efficiently (with fewer resources) than another.

Now, Ricardo came after Smith and built upon his ideas, but I think he introduced a different concept. I remember something about comparative advantage. Oh right, Ricardo's model is about comparative advantage, not absolute. So while Smith focused on absolute efficiency, Ricardo said countries should specialize based on their opportunity costs. That makes sense because even if a country isn't the most efficient at producing something, it might still be beneficial for them to trade if the opportunity cost is lower.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with Ricardo introducing comparative advantage. Let's go through the choices:

A: Ricardo suggested production where demand is highest. Doesn't sound right; I think Smith was more about efficiency, Ricardo about opportunity costs.

B: Argued for self-sufficiency. No, Ricardo was a proponent of free trade, so this is the opposite.

C: Opposed free trade. No, he supported it but with a different reasoning.

D: Introduced Absolute Advantage. No, that was Smith's idea.

E: Supported Smith's theory. Not exactly, he modified it by introducing a new concept.

F: Emphasized international tariffs. I don't think Ricardo focused on tariffs; his main point was about specialization.

G: Formulated Comparative Advantage. Yes, this rings a bell. Ricardo is known for the theory of comparative advantage.

H: Trade based on tech advancement. Maybe, but I think that's more like a different approach, perhaps from others.

I: Trade only between similar production costs. That doesn't fit with comparative advantage, which allows trade even when absolute advantages differ.

J: Highest cost production. No, Ricardo's idea would lower costs through specialization.

So the correct answer should be G: Ricardo formulated the Law of Comparative Advantage.

Ricardo modified Adam Smith's theory by introducing the concept of comparative advantage, which focuses on countries specializing in producing goods based on lower opportunity costs rather than absolute efficiency. This approach supports free trade by emphasizing mutually beneficial specialization, even if one country isn't the most efficient at producing everything.

Answer: G
