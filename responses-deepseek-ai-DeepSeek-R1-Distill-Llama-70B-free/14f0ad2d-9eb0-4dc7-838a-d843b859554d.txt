Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the entropy of a reaction involving iron and oxygen. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The reaction given is Fe(γ) + ½ O₂(g) ⇌ FeO(s) at high temperatures, specifically 1200°C, and we need to calculate the entropy change at that temperature. The data provided includes several reactions and their respective ΔCp expressions and enthalpy changes for different temperature ranges.

First, I remember that entropy change for a reaction at a certain temperature can be calculated using the standard entropy values if we know the temperature, but here the temperature is much higher than 25°C, so I'll need to account for the change in entropy with temperature.

Looking at the data:

- Reaction (A) is Fe(α1) + ½ O₂ → FeO, valid from 25°C to 760°C, with a ΔCp given.
- Reaction (B) at 760°C is Fe(α1) → Fe(α2), ΔH is +660 cal/mol.
- Reaction (C) is Fe(α2) + ½ O₂ → FeO, valid from 760°C to 910°C, with a ΔCp.
- Reaction (D) at 910°C is Fe(α2) → Fe(γ), ΔH is +220 cal/mol.
- Reaction (E) is Fe(γ) + ½ O₂ → FeO, valid from 910°C upwards, with its own ΔCp.

So the target reaction (E) occurs at T ≥910°C, but we need to find the entropy at 1200°C. To get the entropy change for reaction (E) at 1200°C, I think I need to calculate it using the ΔCp expression provided for reaction (E). But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entropy changes step by step from 25°C up to 1200°C, accounting for phase changes and reactions along the way.

Let me outline the process:

1. Calculate the entropy change for each reaction step as temperature increases from 25°C to 1200°C.
2. For each temperature range, use the ΔCp to find how the entropy changes with temperature.
3. Sum all these contributions to get the total entropy change at 1200°C.

Wait, but the overall reaction at 1200°C is reaction (E). So perhaps I can model the entropy change as the sum of the entropy of reaction (E) at some base temperature plus the integral of ΔCp/T dT from that base temperature to 1200°C.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the entropy at each transformation.

Another approach: The standard entropy change ΔS° at temperature T can be found by integrating the heat capacity at constant pressure, because dS = (Cp/T) dT. So, for each temperature range where the reaction's ΔCp is given, I can calculate the contribution to the entropy change.

Wait, but the reactions change with temperature. So perhaps I should split the problem into segments:

- From 25°C to 760°C: Reaction (A) is the form of Fe reacting with O2 to form FeO. The ΔCp for reaction (A) is given.

- At 760°C, Fe(α1) turns into Fe(α2), which is reaction (B), an endothermic process. The entropy change here would be ΔS = ΔH / T, since for a phase change at a specific temperature, ΔS = ΔH_T / T.

- Then from 760°C to 910°C, reaction (C) is the one, with its own ΔCp.

- At 910°C, Fe(α2) turns into Fe(γ), reaction (D), another endothermic step, so again ΔS = ΔH / T.

- Finally, from 910°C to 1200°C, reaction (E) is active, with its own ΔCp.

So the overall approach is to calculate the entropy change for the reaction as it proceeds through each of these steps, summing them all up.

Let me structure this:

The target reaction is Fe(γ) + ½ O₂ → FeO(s) at 1200°C.

But to get here, the Fe goes through phase changes:

At 25°C, it's Fe(α1). So to get to Fe(γ) at 1200°C, it undergoes:

1. Reaction (A): Fe(α1) + ½ O₂ → FeO, up to 760°C.

But wait, no, because the reaction changes with temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the overall reaction is the same as reaction (E), and to find its ΔS at 1200°C, considering that the standard ΔS for reaction (E) is given at the base temperature of 910°C. Wait, no, the standard entropy values are given at 25°C, I think.

Wait, the problem gives standard entropies at 25°C for Fe(α1), O2(g), and FeO(s). So maybe I should calculate the entropy change for the reaction at 25°C and then adjust it for the temperature change up to 1200°C, considering each step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the entropy change for reaction (E) at 1200°C by starting from the entropy at 910°C and then integrating the Cp over the temperature range from 910 to 1200.

Wait, maybe let's think about it this way:

The entropy change of reaction (E) at 1200°C, ΔS°(1200), can be calculated using the ΔCp for reaction (E) from 910°C to 1200°C.

But to get the base entropy at 910°C, I need to consider the entropy contributions from all the steps leading up to 910°C.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

Calculate the standard entropy change at 25°C for the target reaction. Then, calculate how that entropy changes as the temperature increases to 1200°C, considering each temperature interval and the respective ΔCp expressions.

Wait, but the target reaction isn't the same as reaction (A) or (C). Because the initial and final states change as the iron phase changes.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the overall process as the sum of several steps:

1. At 25°C, the reaction is Fe(α1) + ½ O₂ → FeO. Let's compute ΔS° for this reaction at 25°C.

2. Then, as temperature increases to 760°C, we have reaction (A) with its ΔCp.

3. At 760°C, Fe(α1) → Fe(α2), which has ΔH = +660 cal/mol.

4. Then from 760°C to 910°C, reaction (C) is active, with its own ΔCp.

5. At 910°C, Fe(α2) → Fe(γ), ΔH=+220 cal/mol.

6. From 910°C to 1200°C, reaction (E) is active, with its own ΔCp.

Wait, but actually, the target reaction is reaction (E), which is the same as the overall reaction we're considering. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the reaction path as a series of steps where each step corresponds to a temperature range and phase changes, and accumulate the entropy changes.

But this seems a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the steps in terms of entropy changes:

First, calculate the entropy change from 25°C to 760°C for reaction (A). Then account for the phase change at 760°C, then reaction (C) from 760°C to 910°C, then phase change at 910°C, then reaction (E) from 910°C to 1200°C.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the overall reaction at 1200°C is the same as reaction (E), so perhaps the entropy change for reaction (E) at 1200°C can be calculated by knowing its entropy at 910°C and then integrating the Cp/T from 910 to 1200.

But then, the entropy of reaction (E) at 910°C is the same as the entropy of the overall reaction at that temperature. Hmm, but reaction (E) starts at 910°C, so perhaps its ΔS at 910°C is the standard ΔS for that reaction at that temperature.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find another approach.

The entropy change for a reaction at a temperature T can be calculated using the standard entropy values at 25°C plus the integral of ΔCp/T dT from 25°C to T.

But here, the reaction changes form at different temperatures because of phase changes. So perhaps I need to compute the entropy change for each interval, considering the appropriate reaction and its ΔCp.

So let's split the temperature range into segments where the reaction is as per the given data.

1. From 25°C (298 K) to 760°C (1033 K): reaction (A) is active.

2. At 760°C, phase change (B) occurs: Fe(α1) → Fe(α2), ΔH = +660 cal/mol.

3. From 760°C to 910°C (1183 K): reaction (C) is active.

4. At 910°C, phase change (D): Fe(α2) → Fe(γ), ΔH = +220 cal/mol.

5. From 910°C to 1200°C (1473 K): reaction (E) is active.

So the overall reaction at 1200°C is reaction (E), but to get the entropy change at that T, I need to consider the entropy of each step from 25°C up.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model the overall process as the target reaction (E) at 1200°C, and compute the entropy change by considering how the reaction's entropy evolves from 25°C to 1200°C, accounting for the phase changes and reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entropy change at 1200°C as being the sum of the entropy changes from each interval.

Let me try to compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute ΔS for reaction (A) at 25°C.

The standard entropy values are:

Fe(α1): 6.49 cal/(deg·mol)
O₂(g): 49.02 cal/(deg·mol)
FeO(s):14.05 cal/(deg·mol)

So for reaction (A): Fe(α1) + ½ O₂ → FeO.

ΔS°(A) at 25°C = [14.05] - [6.49 + (½ * 49.02)].

Calculating that:

6.49 + (½ *49.02) =6.49 +24.51=30.99.

So ΔS°(A) at 25°C =14.05 -30.99= -16.94 cal/(deg·mol).

Now, from 25°C to 760°C, reaction (A) is active, and its ΔCp is given as 3.9 -4.42e-3 T -0.47e-5 T^-2.

So the entropy change due to reaction (A) over this temperature range is the integral from T1=298 K to T2=1033 K of [ΔCp(A)/T] dT.

Wait, but actually, the entropy change for the reaction from T1 to T2 is the integral of (ΔCp/T) dT from T1 to T2. Because for each reaction, the entropy change with temperature is the integral of (ΔCp/T) dT.

But wait, for reaction (A), from 25°C to 760°C, the reaction is active, so the entropy change for reaction (A) over this interval is the integral of ΔCp(A)/T dT from 298 to 1033 K.

Let me compute that integral.

ΔCp(A) =3.9 -4.42e-3 T -0.47e-5 T^(-2).

So the integral becomes:

∫ [3.9 / T ] dT from 298 to 1033 K,

plus ∫ [ (-4.42e-3) / T ] dT,

plus ∫ [ (-0.47e-5) * T^(-2) / T ] dT.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because ΔCp is multiplied by (1/T), so:

ΔCp(A)/T = [3.9 / T ] + [ (-4.42e-3) * (1/T) ] + [ (-0.47e-5) * T^(-2) * (1/T) ].

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the last term. Let me clarify:

ΔCp(A) =3.9 -4.42e-3 T -0.47e-5 T^-2.

So ΔCp(A)/T = 3.9/T -4.42e-3 - 0.47e-5 T^-3.

Ah, that makes more sense. Because when you divide each term by T, the T in the denominator increases the exponent by 1.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (3.9 / T ) dT → 3.9 ln(T)

∫ (-4.42e-3) dT → -4.42e-3 T

∫ (-0.47e-5) * T^(-3) dT → (-0.47e-5) * (T^(-2)/(-2)) )= 0.235e-5 T^(-2)

So evaluating from T1=298 to T2=1033:

The integral is [3.9 ln(T2) -4.42e-3 T2 - 0.235e-5 / T2 ] - [3.9 ln(T1) -4.42e-3 T1 - 0.235e-5 / T1 ]

Let me compute each part numerically.

Compute each term at T2=1033 K:

Term1: 3.9 * ln(1033) ≈3.9 * 6.938 ≈27.158

Term2: -4.42e-3 *1033 ≈-4.573

Term3: -0.235e-5 /1033 ≈-2.275e-8

So sum for T2: 27.158 -4.573 -0.00000002275 ≈22.585

At T1=298 K:

Term1:3.9 * ln(298)≈3.9 *5.700≈22.23

Term2:-4.42e-3 *298≈-1.318

Term3:-0.235e-5 /298≈-7.88e-8

Sum for T1:22.23 -1.318 -0.0000000788≈20.912

So the integral from 298 to 1033 is (22.585 -20.912)=1.673 cal/(deg·mol).

So the entropy change from reaction (A) over this interval is approximately +1.673 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, but wait, the reaction (A)'s ΔS at 25°C was -16.94. Then, the entropy change for reaction (A) from 25°C to 760°C is +1.673, so the total entropy change up to 760°C is ΔS_total = (-16.94) +1.673 = -15.267 cal/(deg·mol).

But wait, that's just for reaction (A) and the temperature change up to 760°C. Then, at 760°C, the phase change (B) occurs: Fe(α1) → Fe(α2), ΔH=+660 cal/mol.

The entropy change for this phase change is ΔS = ΔH / T.

So ΔS_B =660 cal/mol /760°C. Wait, but wait, the temperature is in Kelvin, right? So 760°C is 1033 K.

So ΔS_B =660 /1033 ≈0.639 cal/(deg·mol).

So add this to the total: -15.267 +0.639≈-14.628.

Next, from 760°C to 910°C, reaction (C) is active. Reaction (C) is Fe(α2) + ½ O₂ → FeO(s).

The ΔCp for reaction (C) is given as -0.92 +1.50e-3 T -0.47e5 T^(-2).

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check the problem statement again.

Ah, no, for reaction (C), ΔC_p is -0.92 +1.50e-3 T - 0.47e-5 T^(-2). Wait, no, the user wrote it as 0.47 × 10^-5 T^-2. So yes, correct.

So ΔCp(C) = -0.92 +1.50e-3 T -0.47e-5 T^-2.

Again, to find the entropy change from 760°C (1033 K) to 910°C (1183 K), we compute the integral of ΔCp(C)/T dT over that interval.

ΔCp(C)/T = (-0.92)/T +1.50e-3 -0.47e-5 * T^(-3).

So the integral is:

∫ (-0.92 / T ) dT → -0.92 ln(T)

∫ 1.50e-3 dT →1.50e-3 T

∫ (-0.47e-5) T^(-3) dT → (-0.47e-5) * (T^(-2)/(-2)) )= 0.235e-5 T^(-2)

Evaluated from T1=1033 to T2=1183 K.

Compute each term at T2=1183:

Term1: -0.92 * ln(1183)≈-0.92 *7.075≈-6.509

Term2:1.50e-3 *1183≈1.7745

Term3:0.235e-5 /1183≈1.988e-8

Sum at T2: -6.509 +1.7745 +0.00000001988≈-4.7345

At T1=1033:

Term1: -0.92 * ln(1033)≈-0.92*6.938≈-6.383

Term2:1.50e-3 *1033≈1.55e-3 *1033≈1.55 *1.033≈1.600 (Wait, 1.5e-3 *1033=1.5 *1033 /1000=1.5*1.033≈1.55 approx.

Wait, wait, let's compute more accurately:
