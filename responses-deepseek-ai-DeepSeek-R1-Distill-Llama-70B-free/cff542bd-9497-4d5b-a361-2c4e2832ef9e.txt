Okay, so I've got this question about the Wien bridge oscillator and its feedback factor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can think it through.

Alright, Wien bridge oscillator. I remember it's a type of electronic oscillator, and it uses an op-amp. The basic idea is that it provides a sinusoidal output without needing an inductive circuit, which is cool because inductors can be bulky sometimes.

Wait, the feedback factor... Oh right, the feedback factor in an oscillator is crucial because it determines the condition for oscillation. For an oscillator to work, the product of the gain (A) and the feedback factor (β) must be equal to 1. So, Aβ = 1. But wait, isn't it that the loop gain should be exactly 1 for sustained oscillations without distortion? So the feedback factor plays a key role here.

The Wien bridge configuration: I think it's a type of RC oscillator. The bridge part probably refers to some sort of balanced circuit. Let me recall the structure. The Wien bridge has two resistors and two capacitors, right? Maybe something like a series RC in one arm and a parallel RC in another.

Oh wait, no, the Wien bridge for the oscillator typically uses a positive feedback loop. The op-amp takes the output and feeds it back in a way that creates oscillations at a specific frequency.

So the feedback factor β is the ratio of the feedback signal to the output signal. In the case of the Wien bridge, the feedback network is designed in a way that the feedback factor is 1/3 or something like that. Wait, why would that be?

Let me think about the circuit. The Wien bridge has a certain configuration where the feedback comes from a combination of resistors and capacitors. The op-amp is connected in such a way that the feedback is a fraction of the output. So for the oscillator to start and maintain oscillations, the gain must be set so that when multiplied by β, it equals 1.

I remember that for the Wien bridge oscillator, the feedback factor β is 1/3. Because the calculation goes something like this: the gain of the op-amp (A) is set to 3, so that when you multiply A by β (which is 1/3), you get 1, satisfying the Barkhausen criterion for oscillation. So the feedback factor β is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option E is 1/3. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but did I get that right? Let me double-check. Another way to think about it is the transfer function of the Wien bridge. The transfer function of the feedback network is something like (R2/(R1+R2)) / (1 + jωRC). But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, considering that the feedback is taken from a certain point in the network. In the Wien bridge, the feedback is taken such that the ratio is 1/3. Oh right, because the bridge has two feedback resistors in a way that the voltage is divided into three parts, so β is 1/3.

So yes, the feedback factor is 1/3, which is option E.

The Wien bridge oscillator is a type of RC oscillator that uses an op-amp and a feedback network to produce sinusoidal oscillations. The feedback factor (β) is a critical parameter, as it determines the condition for sustained oscillations. For an oscillator, the product of the gain (A) and the feedback factor (β) must equal 1, i.e., \( A\beta = 1 \).

In the Wien bridge configuration, the feedback network is designed such that the feedback factor is \( \beta = \frac{1}{3} \). This is because the feedback signal is derived from a specific combination of resistors and capacitors in the network, which divides the output voltage into three parts. To satisfy the Barkhausen criterion for oscillation, the gain of the op-amp is typically set to 3, ensuring that \( A\beta = 1 \).

Given the options, the feedback factor of the Wien bridge oscillator is \( \frac{1}{3} \), which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
