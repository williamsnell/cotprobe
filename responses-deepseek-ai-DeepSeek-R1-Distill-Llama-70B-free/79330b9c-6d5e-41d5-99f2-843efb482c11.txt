Question:

Explain the development of an individual who is not psychologically well-adjusted, according to Rogers.

Options:

A: Rogers posits that consistent positive reinforcement leads to maladjustment as it prevents the development of a realistic self-concept.
B: Rogers believes that personal evaluations by others, especially during childhood, result in a distancing or incongruence between the experiences of the self and the experiences of the organism, leading to psychological maladjustment.
C: According to Rogers, the primary factor in psychological maladjustment is the individual's failure to achieve their full economic potential.
D: Rogers suggests that well-adjustment is hindered when an individual adopts the values of others as their own without question.
E: Rogers believes that evaluations by others have no impact on a child's psychological adjustment
F: Rogers believes that a lack of discipline and structure in childhood is the main contributor to psychological maladjustment.
G: Rogers asserts that psychological maladjustment arises primarily from an individual's inability to engage in abstract thinking.
H: Rogers believes that psychological well-being is determined solely by genetic factors, with environmental factors playing no role.
I: Rogers believes that the child's self-concept is always in congruence with the experiences of the organism
J: Rogers believes that the child's self-regard is always conditional

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Carl Rogers and his theories on psychological adjustment. Hmm, I remember that Rogers was a humanistic psychologist, so his ideas are about self-actualization and the person-centered approach. The question is about how an individual becomes maladjusted according to Rogers.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let me think about what Rogers said. I think he talked a lot about the self-concept and conditions of worth. Oh right, he believed that when people receive conditional positive regard, meaning they're only praised or loved when they meet certain standards, it can distort their self-concept.

So, if a child is only approved of when they behave in certain ways, they might start to see themselves through those conditions. This can create a discrepancy between their real experiences (the organism's experiences) and their self-concept. That's called incongruence, right? And that leads to maladjustment because the person isn't being true to themselves.

Looking at the options:

Option A says consistent positive reinforcement leads to maladjustment. Wait, positive reinforcement is more Skinner's thing, behavioral. Rogers isn't about reinforcement in that way. Plus, consistent positive reinforcement might actually help, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe not if it's conditional.

Option B: Personal evaluations by others, especially in childhood, cause a distancing or incongruence between self and organism experiences. That sounds right. Because when others evaluate us, we internalize those as conditions for our self-worth, leading to incongruence.

Option C is about economic potential. No, Rogers isn't focused on that. It's more about emotional and psychological aspects.

Option D: Adopting others' values without question. That seems related because it would mean the person isn't true to their own self. So this could cause maladjustment, as they're not being authentic.

Option E: Evaluations by others have no impact. No, that's the opposite of what Rogers would say.

Option F: Lack of discipline. I don't think that's Rogers' point. He's more about the emotional environment than structure or discipline.

Option G: Abstract thinking. No, his theory isn't about cognitive abilities like that.

Option H: Genetic factors. No, Rogers was more about the environment and social interactions.

Option I: Self-concept always congruent. No, that's not right. Maladjustment happens when they're not congruent.

Option J: Child's self-regard always conditional. Hmm, well, I think Rogers says that conditional regard is a problem, but does he say it's always conditional? Or is it that when it's conditional, it causes issues.

Wait, the question is about the development of a maladjusted individual. So according to Rogers, when others impose their evaluations, the child's self-concept becomes based on those evaluations, leading to a split between their real experiences and their self-concept. That's incongruence.

So looking back, option B says that personal evaluations cause a distancing or incongruence between self and organism experiences, leading to maladjustment. That fits.

Option D is about adopting others' values. That's also a point, but I think B is more directly about the cause of incongruence.

Wait, another angle: Rogers' theory says that when parents (significant others) place conditions on their love and approval, the child develops a self-concept based on these conditions, leading to a split. So the evaluations by others create this incongruence.

So option B is correct. Evaluations by others, especially in childhood, cause this split.

Wait, what about option D? It says adopting others' values without question hinders well-adjustment. That seems true too, but the question is about the development of maladjustment. So B is more about the cause, while D is about a result maybe.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The question asks about the development of psychological maladjustment according to Carl Rogers. Rogers, a humanistic psychologist, emphasized the importance of self-concept and the impact of conditional positive regard. He argued that when individuals, especially children, receive evaluations or approval from others based on certain conditions, they internalize these as their self-worth. This can lead to a discrepancy, or incongruence, between their true experiences (organism's experiences) and their self-concept. This incongruence is a key factor in psychological maladjustment.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Consistent positive reinforcement is not a concept Rogers focuses on, and it does not align with his theory of maladjustment.
- **Option B**: Correct. This directly reflects Rogers' idea that evaluations by others, especially in childhood, create a distancing or incongruence between the self and organism experiences, leading to maladjustment.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Economic potential is not a factor in Rogers' theory of psychological adjustment.
- **Option D**: While adopting others' values without question can contribute to maladjustment, this is more of a result rather than the primary cause, which is better captured by Option B.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Evaluations by others are central to Rogers' theory, so this is the opposite of his view.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Lack of discipline is not a focus of Rogers' theory.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Abstract thinking is unrelated to Rogers' theory of maladjustment.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Rogers emphasizes environmental factors, not genetic ones.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Rogers argues that self-concept is often incongruent with organism experiences, not always congruent.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While conditional self-regard is problematic, Rogers does not suggest it is always conditional.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as it accurately captures Rogers' explanation of how evaluations by others lead to incongruence and maladjustment.

Answer: B
