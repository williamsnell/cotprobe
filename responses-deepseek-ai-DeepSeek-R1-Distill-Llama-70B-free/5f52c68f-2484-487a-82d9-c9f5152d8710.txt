Okay, so I have this physics problem here about lasers and moving mirrors. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says a laser emits a monochromatic light beam with wavelength lambda, which falls normally on a mirror moving at velocity V. I need to find the beat frequency between the incident and reflected light. The options are A through J.

Wait, beat frequency. I remember that beat frequency is the difference between two frequencies when they're close to each other. So in this case, the incident light and the reflected light have slightly different frequencies because the mirror is moving. That makes sense because when the mirror moves, it's like the source is moving relative to the observer, causing a Doppler shift.

So the setup is: the laser's light hits a moving mirror. The mirror is moving at velocity V. Since the light is hitting normally, it's head-on. So I think the Doppler effect will come into play here twice—once when the light is coming towards the mirror and once when it's reflected back.

Wait, let me think. The light is incident on the mirror, which is moving towards or away from the source. Let's say the mirror is moving towards the source. When the mirror moves towards the source, the frequency of the reflected light will be higher than the incident because of the Doppler effect. But wait, because the mirror is moving, both the incident and reflected light will experience a Doppler shift. Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate the frequency of the incident and the frequency of the reflected, then find the beat frequency as the difference between them.

Wait no, the incident light is coming from the laser, which is stationary. But the mirror is moving. So when the mirror is moving towards the laser, the light that hits the mirror has a higher frequency because the mirror is approaching. Then, when the light reflects, since the mirror is moving towards the source, the reflection would cause another shift. So the total shift would be a combination of both the approaching and receding effects?

Wait, let me clarify. The Doppler effect for light when the source is moving towards the observer is f' = f * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ). But wait, in this case, the mirror is the observer moving towards the source. Or is it the source moving towards the observer? Because the mirror is reflecting the light back. Wait, perhaps I should model it as the mirror acting as a moving reflector.

Another approach: when the mirror moves towards the incident light, the frequency of the light as seen by the mirror is higher. Then, when the mirror reflects it, the reflection will have an additional Doppler shift because the mirror is moving towards the observer (if the mirror is moving towards the original source, it's moving away from the reflected direction? Or opposite. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that when a mirror moves with velocity V towards the source, the light that reflects off it will have a frequency shift of twice the Doppler shift. Because the light's wavelength is effectively compressed twice—once when it hits the moving mirror and once when it reflects back.

Wait, let me think of it step by step.

The initial frequency is f = c / lambda.

When light hits a moving mirror, the mirror acts like a moving observer. So the observed frequency by the mirror is f1 = f * (c + V_mirror) / (c - V_source). Wait, but the source is stationary, so V_source is zero. So f1 = f * (c + V_mirror) / c. Wait, no, because if the mirror is moving towards the source, then relative to the source, the mirror's speed is V. Alternatively, I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula when the observer is moving towards the source.

Wait, the standard Doppler formula when the observer is moving towards the source is f' = f * (c + v_obs) / c. So in this case, the mirror is the observer moving towards the source. So the observed frequency f1 is f multiplied by (c + V)/c, where V is the speed of the mirror towards the source.

But wait, then when the light reflects off the mirror, the mirror is moving towards the source, so the reflection would cause another Doppler shift. Because now the mirror is moving towards the source, which is the original direction, but the reflected light is going back towards the source. So for the reflected light, the mirror is moving in the same direction as the reflected light? Or opposite?

Alternatively, when the mirror is moving towards the source, the reflection can be considered as the mirror emitting the reflected light. So when the mirror emits the light back, it's moving towards the source, so the frequency increases again.

Wait, perhaps the total shift is double the single Doppler shift. So the first shift is due to the mirror moving towards the source when the light hits it. Then, the reflected light has another shift because the mirror is moving towards the source as it reflects the light back.

Wait, let me model this. Let's say the mirror is moving towards the source with speed V. The incident light has frequency f0 = c/lambda.

When the mirror is moving towards the source, the frequency observed by the mirror is f1 = f0 * (c + V)/c. Because the observer (mirror) is moving towards the source.

Then, when the mirror reflects the light, it's like a source moving towards the observer (the original source is now the observer for the reflected light). So the reflected light's frequency f2 is f1 * (c + V)/c. Because the mirror (as a source) is moving towards the observer.

So f2 = f0 * (c + V)^2 / c^2.

Then, the beat frequency is the difference between the original frequency f0 and this new frequency f2.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the initial light is hitting the mirror, and the mirror's movement causes a Doppler shift upon incidence and another upon reflection. So the initial shift when the light is coming in, and another shift when it's going back. So the total shift is twice the effect. But in terms of the formula, each shift would be (1 + V/c) for each Doppler shift.

Wait, but when the mirror is moving towards the source, when the light hits, the light's frequency increases by a factor of (c + V)/c. Then, when the light reflects back, because the mirror is moving towards the source, the reflected light's frequency as seen by the source would be higher by another (c + V)/c factor. So the total f2 = f0 * ( (c + V)/c )^2.

So the beat frequency is f2 - f0. But wait, the beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two frequencies. So f2 - f0 would be f0 [ ( (c + V)^2 / c^2 ) - 1 ].

Wait, but let me think about the non-relativistic case, where V is much smaller than c. Then we can approximate (c + V)^2 ≈ c^2 + 2 c V. So (c + V)^2 / c^2 = 1 + 2V/c + (V/c)^2. Ignoring the (V/c)^2 term, it's approximately 1 + 2V/c.

So f2 ≈ f0 (1 + 2V/c )

So the beat frequency would be f2 - f0 ≈ f0 * 2V/c.

But what is f0? f0 is c / lambda.

So substituting, beat freq ≈ (c/lambda) * 2V/c = 2V/(lambda).

Wait, that's 2V/lambda.

Looking at the options, option F is 2v/λ. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. So in the approximation, when V is small compared to c, the beat frequency is 2V/lambda.

Another way to think: the Doppler shift when moving towards is f' = f (1 + v/c) for small v. So when the light hits the mirror, the frequency increases by (1 + v/c). Then, when it reflects back, it's another increase by (1 + v/c). So the total is (1 + v/c)^2 ≈ 1 + 2v/c, leading to a beat frequency of f0 * 2v/c. Which again is 2v/lambda.

Yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, another approach: the change in wavelength.

The initial wavelength is lambda. When the mirror moves towards the source, the observed wavelength on incidence is lambda' = lambda * c/(c + V). Then, upon reflection, the wavelength observed by the source is lambda'' = lambda' * c/(c + V) = lambda c^2 / (c + V)^2.

But this might complicate things more. Alternatively, think in terms of frequency.

So the beat frequency is the difference between the original and the shifted frequency: f_shifted - f0.

Which, as we calculated, is approximately 2v/(lambda).

Looking at the options:

Option F is 2v/λ.

So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the beat frequency between the incident and reflected light when a mirror moves at velocity \( V \), we analyze the Doppler effect. The laser emits light with frequency \( f_0 = \frac{c}{\lambda} \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( c \) is the speed of light. When the mirror moves towards the source, the frequency of the light observed by the mirror increases due to the Doppler effect. This can be approximated as:

\[
f_1 = f_0 \left( 1 + \frac{V}{c} \right)
\]

Upon reflection, the light is Doppler-shifted again because the mirror is moving towards the source. The reflected frequency is then:

\[
f_2 = f_1 \left( 1 + \frac{V}{c} \right) = f_0 \left( 1 + \frac{V}{c} \right)^2
\]

For small \( V/c \), we can expand \( \left( 1 + \frac{V}{c} \right)^2 \) as \( 1 + 2\frac{V}{c} \), so:

\[
f_2 \approx f_0 \left( 1 + 2\frac{V}{c} \right)
\]

The beat frequency is the difference between the reflected frequency \( f_2 \) and the original frequency \( f_0 \):

\[
\Delta f = f_2 - f_0 = f_0 \left( 1 + 2\frac{V}{c} \right) - f_0 = f_0 \cdot 2\frac{V}{c}
\]

Substituting \( f_0 = \frac{c}{\lambda} \), we get:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \cdot 2\frac{V}{c} = \frac{2V}{\lambda}
\]

Thus, the beat frequency is \( \frac{2V}{\lambda} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
