Question:

A boy found a bicycle lock for which the combination was unknown. The correct combination is a four-digit number, $d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4$, where $d_i, i=1,2,3,4$, is selected from $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$, and 8 . How many different lock combinations are possible with such a lock?

Options:

A: 32768
B: 8192
C: 2048
D: 1000
E: 7000
F: 256
G:  4096
H: 16384
I: 1024
J: 512

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bicycle lock combination. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, the lock uses a four-digit number, each digit being d1, d2, d3, d4. Each of these digits can be selected from 1 to 8. I need to find out how many different combinations are possible.

Wait, so each digit has 8 possible choices because they're using numbers 1 through 8. Right, and there are four digits in the combination. So for each position in the combination, there are 8 options.

I remember that when calculating the number of possible combinations for something like this, you multiply the number of options for each position together. So that's 8 for the first digit, times 8 for the second, and so on.

Let me think, 8 multiplied by itself four times is 8^4. Let me calculate that. 8 squared is 64, so 8 cubed is 512, and 8^4 would be 512 multiplied by 8 again. Let's do that: 512 * 8. Hmm, 500*8 is 4000, and 12*8 is 96, so adding those gives 4096.

So the total number of combinations should be 4096. Looking at the options, option G is 4096, so that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Each digit is independent of the others, right? So for each of the four positions, the number of choices doesn't decrease because you can reuse digits. Like, the first digit being a 3 doesn't stop the second from being a 3 again. So yes, it's 8 options each time.

So yeah, 8^4 is 4096. So the answer must be G.

The problem involves determining the number of possible combinations for a four-digit bicycle lock, where each digit ($d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4$) can be selected from the numbers 1 to 8. Since each digit has 8 possible choices and the digits are independent of each other, the total number of combinations is calculated by raising 8 to the power of 4:

\[
8^4 = 8 \times 8 \times 8 \times 8 = 4096
\]

Thus, the total number of different lock combinations is 4096. Among the given options, the correct answer is **G: 4096**.
