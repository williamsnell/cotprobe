Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the minimum vertex cover of an undirected graph. The graph G has edges E = {<0,2>, <2,4>, <3,4>, <1,4>}. And the condition is that node 0 must be part of the vertex cover. I'm a bit rusty on vertex covers, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. So, every edge must have at least one endpoint in the cover. The goal is to find the smallest such set possible.

Given that 0 is already in the cover, that takes care of the edge <0,2>. So the other edges we need to cover are <2,4>, <3,4>, and <1,4>.

Let me list out the edges again for clarity:
- 0 connected to 2
- 2 connected to 4
- 3 connected to 4
- 1 connected to 4

Since 0 is in the cover, the edge <0,2> is covered. Now, for the remaining edges, each must have at least one of their endpoints in the cover.

Looking at these remaining edges:
- <2,4> can be covered by either 2 or 4.
- <3,4> can be covered by 3 or 4.
- <1,4> can be covered by 1 or 4.

I need to choose the minimal set. Let me think about the best way to cover these edges with as few nodes as possible.

Option 1: Include 4 in the cover. If I include 4, then all three edges <2,4>, <3,4>, and <1,4> are covered. So the cover would be {0,4}, which seems pretty minimal. Let's check if this works. So 0 covers <0,2>, and 4 covers the other three edges. That's two nodes, which is great.

Option 2: What if I don't include 4? Then I have to cover each of those edges with their other endpoints. So I'd need to include 2, 3, and 1. That would make the cover {0,1,2,3}, which is four nodes. That's way worse than option 1.

So clearly, including 4 gives a smaller cover. So the minimal vertex cover including 0 is {0,4}.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other options that could be better? Let me see.

What if I include 2 and 4. Then 0,2,4. But that's three nodes. So that's worse than just 0 and 4.

Or, what about including 1 and 4? Then 0,1,4. That's three nodes again. So that's more than necessary.

Alternatively, including 4 alone covers all the other edges. So yeah, {0,4} is the minimal.

Wait, but let me look at the answer options. The options are:

A: [0,1,2]
B: [0,2,4]
C: [0,1,4]
D: [0,4]
E: [0,3,4]
F: [0,1,3]
G: [0,1]
H: [0,2,3]
I: [0,2]
J: [0,3]

So D is [0,4], which is what I think is correct. So the answer should be D.

But wait, just to make sure I'm not missing any edge cases. Let me think again.

If I choose 0 and 4, does that cover all edges?

- <0,2> is covered by 0.
- <2,4> is covered by 4.
- <3,4> is covered by 4.
- <1,4> is covered by 4.

Yes, all edges are covered. So the minimal vertex cover when 0 is included is indeed {0,4}.
</think>

To determine the minimum vertex cover of the graph \( G \) with edges \( E = \{<0,2>, <2,4>, <3,4>, <1,4>\} \), where 0 must be included in the vertex cover, we need to ensure that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in the cover. 

A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in the set. The goal is to find the smallest such set. Since 0 is already in the cover, the edge \( <0,2> \) is covered. The remaining edges to cover are \( <2,4> \), \( <3,4> \), and \( <1,4> \).

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Including 4 in the cover**: If 4 is included, it covers all three remaining edges \( <2,4> \), \( <3,4> \), and \( <1,4> \). Thus, the vertex cover becomes \( \{0, 4\} \), which is minimal with only two nodes.

2. **Not including 4 in the cover**: If 4 is excluded, the remaining edges must be covered by their other endpoints (2, 3, and 1). This would result in a larger vertex cover \( \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \), which is suboptimal.

3. **Other combinations**: Including additional nodes like 2, 3, or 1 along with 4 only increases the size of the vertex cover without providing any advantage. For example:
   - \( \{0, 2, 4\} \): Covers all edges but has three nodes.
   - \( \{0, 1, 4\} \): Also covers all edges but has three nodes.
   - \( \{0, 3, 4\} \): Covers all edges but has three nodes.

### Conclusion:
The smallest vertex cover that includes 0 is \( \{0, 4\} \), as it covers all edges with only two nodes. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: [0, 4]**
