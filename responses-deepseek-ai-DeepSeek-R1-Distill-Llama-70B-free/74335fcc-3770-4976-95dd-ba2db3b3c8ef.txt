Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that each of the given ionized isotopes is projected with the same speed into a uniform magnetic field B, and the initial velocity is perpendicular to B. I need to find which combination of mass and charge results in a circular path with the largest radius.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it moves in a circular path. The radius of that path depends on the mass, charge, velocity, and the magnetic field strength. Oh right, the formula for the radius is r = (m * v) / (q * B), where m is mass, v is velocity, q is charge, and B is the magnetic field.

Wait, but all the isotopes are projected with the same speed, meaning v is the same for all. And the magnetic field B is uniform, so it's the same for all as well. So the radius r depends on (m)/(q) because v and B are constants across all options. Oh, but wait, the charges are negative here, but since radius is based on the magnitude, the sign doesn't matter. So I can just consider the absolute value of q.

The problem is asking for the largest radius. Since r is proportional to m/q, the larger the m/q ratio, the larger the radius. So I need to find the option where m divided by the absolute value of q is the largest.

Let me look at each option and calculate m/q for each.

Option A: m=20 u, q=–2e. So m/q is 20/2=10.
Option B: m=20, q=–1. So 20/1=20.
Option C: m=18, q=–3. 18/3=6.
Option D: m=16, q=–5. 16/5=3.2.
Option E: m=18, q=–4. 18/4=4.5.
Option F: m=17, q=–4. 17/4=4.25.
Option G: m=19, q=–2. 19/2=9.5.
Option H: m=16, q=–6. 16/6≈2.666.
Option I: m=21, q=–1. 21/1=21.
Option J: m=22, q=–2. 22/2=11.

Now, let me list all these m/q values:

A:10, B:20, C:6, D:3.2, E:4.5, F:4.25, G:9.5, H:~2.67, I:21, J:11.

Looking for the largest m/q ratio. Let's see:

Option I has 21, which is the highest. Next is B with 20, then J with 11, A with 10, then G:9.5, E:4.5, F:4.25, C:6, D:3.2, H:2.67.

So Option I has the highest m/q, which would give the largest radius.

Wait, but I should double-check each calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recheck:

Option I: m=21 u, q=–1 e. So 21 divided by 1 is 21. That's correct.

Option B: 20/1=20. That's correct.

Option J: 22/2=11. Right.

So yes, Option I has the highest ratio. Therefore, the largest radius is for option I.

To determine which ionized isotope has the largest circular path radius when projected into a uniform magnetic field \( B \) with the same initial velocity \( v \) (perpendicular to \( B \)), we use the formula for the radius of the circular path:

\[
r = \frac{m \cdot v}{q \cdot B}
\]

Since \( v \) and \( B \) are constants across all options, the radius \( r \) is proportional to the ratio \( \frac{m}{q} \). The larger the \( \frac{m}{q} \) ratio, the larger the radius. The charge \( q \) is negative in all cases, but since the radius depends on the magnitude of \( q \), the sign can be ignored.

Now, calculate \( \frac{m}{q} \) for each option:

- **A**: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
- **B**: \( \frac{20}{1} = 20 \)
- **C**: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- **D**: \( \frac{16}{5} = 3.2 \)
- **E**: \( \frac{18}{4} = 4.5 \)
- **F**: \( \frac{17}{4} = 4.25 \)
- **G**: \( \frac{19}{2} = 9.5 \)
- **H**: \( \frac{16}{6} \approx 2.67 \)
- **I**: \( \frac{21}{1} = 21 \)
- **J**: \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \)

The largest \( \frac{m}{q} \) ratio is for **Option I** (\( \frac{21}{1} = 21 \)), which corresponds to the largest radius. Therefore, the isotope with \( m = 21 \, \text{u} \) and \( q = -1 \, \text{e} \) will have the largest circular path.
