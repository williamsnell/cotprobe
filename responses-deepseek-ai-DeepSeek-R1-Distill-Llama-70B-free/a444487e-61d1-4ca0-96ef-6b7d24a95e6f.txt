Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding the question.

The problem is about a court investigating an event T. Two witnesses, Alf and Bob, are called. Both Alf and Bob assert that T occurred. I need to find the probability that T actually occurred given both Alf and Bob's testimonies. 

The given probabilities are:
- Alf's reliability (truth-telling probability), alpha = 9/10 = 0.9
- Bob's reliability, beta = 9/10 = 0.9
- The prior probability of T occurring, tau (τ) = 1/1000 = 0.001

So, the events are:
- A: Alf says T occurred.
- B: Bob says T occurred.

We're looking for P(T | A and B). That is, the probability that T happened given both A and B.

I remember that this is a classic Bayesian probability problem. Bayes' theorem will be useful here. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is:

P(T|A,B) = [P(A,B|T) * P(T)] / P(A,B)

So I need to compute each part of this equation.

First, let's break down each component.

1. P(T): This is given as τ = 0.001.

2. P(A,B|T): The probability that both Alf and Bob say T occurred given that T actually occurred. Since Alf and Bob are independent (no collusion), this should be the product of their individual probabilities of telling the truth.

So P(A|T) = alpha = 0.9
P(B|T) = beta = 0.9
Thus, P(A,B|T) = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81

3. P(A,B): The probability that both Alf and Bob say T occurred, regardless of whether T actually happened or not. This can happen in two mutually exclusive scenarios:
   a. T occurred, and both told the truth.
   b. T did not occur, but both lied.

So P(A,B) = P(A,B|T) * P(T) + P(A,B|not T) * P(not T)

I already have P(A,B|T) as 0.81, and P(T) is 0.001, so the first term is 0.81 * 0.001 = 0.00081.

Now, the second term: P(A,B|not T) is the probability that both Alf and Bob lied about T occurring. Since they're independent, their lies are independent events.

P(not T) = 1 - τ = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999.

P(A|not T): Alf lying, which is (1 - alpha) = 0.1
Similarly, P(B|not T) = 0.1

So P(A,B|not T) = 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01

Therefore, the second term is 0.01 * 0.999 = 0.00999

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Oh, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because P(A,B|not T) is when both say T occurred even though T didn't. So when T didn't happen, Alf would lie by saying it did, and same with Bob.

So yes, P(A|not T) is 0.1, same for Bob. So 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01. Then multiplied by P(not T) = 0.999 gives 0.00999.

So putting it all together, P(A,B) = 0.00081 + 0.00999 = 0.0108.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 0.00081 plus 0.00999 equals 0.0108 exactly, because 0.00081 is 81e-5 and 0.00999 is 999e-4, which is 99.9e-3. Let me convert them to the same exponent:

0.00081 = 81e-5 = 0.81e-3
0.00999 = 9.99e-3

Adding them: 0.81e-3 + 9.99e-3 = (0.81 + 9.99)e-3 = 10.8e-3 = 0.0108.

So P(A,B) is 0.0108.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|A,B) = [0.81 * 0.001] / 0.0108

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, P(A,B|T) is 0.81, and P(T) is 0.001, so the numerator is 0.81 * 0.001 = 0.00081.

So numerator = 0.00081, denominator = 0.0108.

So P(T|A,B) = 0.00081 / 0.0108.

Let me compute that. 0.00081 divided by 0.0108.

Hmm. Let me write it as (81e-5) / (108e-4) ) 

Which is (81/108) * (1e-5 / 1e-4) ) 

1e-5 / 1e-4 is 0.1, so 81/108 is 0.75. So 0.75 * 0.1 = 0.075.

So P(T|A,B) is 0.075, which is 7.5%.

Wait, but let me make sure I did that correctly.

Another way: 0.00081 ÷ 0.0108.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

0.00081 * 10000 = 8.1
0.0108 * 10000 = 108

So 8.1 / 108 = ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 8.1:

8.1 ÷8.1 =1

108 ÷8.1 = 13.333...

So 1 / 13.333... is 0.075.

Yes, so 0.075.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 0.075.

So the correct answer is F.

To determine the probability that event \( T \) occurred given that both Alf and Bob testified that \( T \) occurred, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T|A,B) = \frac{P(A,B|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(A,B)}
\]

### Step 1: Define the known probabilities
- \( P(T) = \tau = 0.001 \)
- \( P(A|T) = \alpha = 0.9 \), \( P(B|T) = \beta = 0.9 \)
- \( P(A,B|T) = P(A|T) \cdot P(B|T) = 0.9 \cdot 0.9 = 0.81 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.999 \)
- \( P(A|\neg T) = 1 - \alpha = 0.1 \), \( P(B|\neg T) = 1 - \beta = 0.1 \)
- \( P(A,B|\neg T) = P(A|\neg T) \cdot P(B|\neg T) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \)

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(A,B) \)
The total probability \( P(A,B) \) includes two scenarios:
1. \( T \) occurred, and both Alf and Bob told the truth.
2. \( T \) did not occur, but both Alf and Bob lied.

\[
P(A,B) = P(A,B|T) \cdot P(T) + P(A,B|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(A,B) = (0.81 \cdot 0.001) + (0.01 \cdot 0.999) = 0.00081 + 0.00999 = 0.0108
\]

### Step 3: Apply Bayes' theorem
Using the numerator \( P(A,B|T) \cdot P(T) = 0.81 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00081 \) and the denominator \( P(A,B) = 0.0108 \):

\[
P(T|A,B) = \frac{0.00081}{0.0108} = 0.075
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that \( T \) occurred given that both Alf and Bob declared it occurred is \( 0.075 \), which corresponds to **Option F**.
