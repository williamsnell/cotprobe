Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is about a student dropping a water balloon from a tall building, and then hearing the splash after a certain time. We need to find the height of the building. Hmm.

Alright, the data given is that the time between dropping the balloon and hearing the splash is 4.021 seconds. And the speed of sound is 331 m/s. Oh wait, right, because the balloon takes time to fall, and then the sound takes time to come back up. So the total time is the sum of the time it takes for the balloon to hit the ground and the time for the sound to travel back up.

So I think I need to set up two equations here. One for the falling time (t1) and one for the sound time (t2). The total time is t1 + t2 = 4.021 s.

Wait, the balloon is under free fall, so the height of the building (let's call it h) can be found using the equation for free fall without air resistance. The equation is h = (1/2) * g * t1², where g is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.8 m/s².

And for the sound, the time t2 is the distance h divided by the speed of sound. So t2 = h / 331.

So substituting, t1 = sqrt(2h/g), because from h = (1/2) g t1² → t1 = sqrt(2h/g). Or wait, solving for t1: t1 = sqrt(2h/9.8).

So the total time is t1 + t2 = 4.021 s. So,

sqrt(2h/9.8) + h/331 = 4.021.

Hmm, that's an equation with h as the unknown. I need to solve for h.

This seems a bit tricky because it's not a straightforward algebraic equation. Maybe I can make an approximation or use substitution.

Wait, let's try to approach this step by step. Let me denote t1 as the time the balloon takes to fall, and t2 as the time the sound takes to come up. So t1 + t2 = 4.021.

So t1 = sqrt(2h/g) → sqrt(2h/9.8) = t1.

t2 = h / 331.

So substituting, sqrt(2h/9.8) + h/331 = 4.021.

Hmm, solving this equation exactly might be a bit tough because it's a mix of square root and linear terms. Maybe I can make an initial approximation. Assume that the time for the sound is small compared to the falling time. Because usually, the speed of sound is much higher than the speed of a falling object, so t2 would be much smaller than t1.

Wait, but in this case, the total time is about 4 seconds. So if the building were, say, 80 meters, the time to fall would be sqrt(2*80/9.8) → sqrt(160/9.8) = sqrt(16.326) ≈ 4.04 seconds. Wait, that's already more than 4 seconds, which would imply that the t2 is negative, which can't be. So maybe the building is lower than that.

Wait, no, because if the balloon takes, say, 3 seconds to fall, then the sound would take t2 = h/331. For h = (1/2)*9.8*(3)^2 = 44.1 meters. Then t2 = 44.1 / 331 ≈ 0.133 seconds. So total time is 3.133 s, which is less than 4.021 s. So maybe the building is higher, but not too high.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an initial guess for h and iterate.

Alternatively, let's try to set up the equation and solve it numerically.

Let me write the equation again:

sqrt( (2h)/9.8 ) + h/331 = 4.021.

Let me square the terms to eliminate the square root, but I need to be careful because that might complicate things.

Let me let’s denote x = h. Then:

sqrt( (2x)/9.8 ) + x/331 = 4.021.

Let me subtract x/331 from both sides:

sqrt( (2x)/9.8 ) = 4.021 - (x/331).

Now square both sides:

(2x)/9.8 = [4.021 - (x/331)]^2.

Expand the right side:

= (4.021)^2 - 2*(4.021)*(x/331) + (x/331)^2.

Calculate each term:

(4.021)^2 ≈ 16.17 (since 4^2=16, 4.02^2≈16.16). Let me compute 4.021*4.021:

4 *4 =16, 4*.021=0.084, .021*4=0.084, .021^2=0.000441. So (4 + 0.021)^2= 16 + 2*(4)(0.021) + 0.021^2 = 16 + 0.168 + 0.000441 = 16.168441.

So that's approximately 16.1684.

So,

(2x)/9.8 = 16.1684 - (2*4.021*x)/331 + (x^2)/(331^2).

Let me compute each coefficient step by step.

Compute 2*(4.021)/331: 8.042 / 331 ≈ 0.02429.

So the equation becomes:

(2x)/9.8 = 16.1684 - 0.02429 x + (x²)/(109561).

Wait, 331 squared is 331*331. 300^2=90000, 31^2=961, 2*(300)(31)=18600, so (331)^2= (300+31)^2= 90000 + 18600 + 961= 109561.

So,

(2x)/9.8 ≈ 0.20408 x ≈ 16.1684 - 0.02429 x + x² / 109561.

Multiply both sides by 9.8 to eliminate the denominator on the left:

2x ≈ 9.8 * [16.1684 -0.02429 x + x² / 109561 ].

Compute 9.8 * 16.1684: Let's compute 16 *9.8=156.8, 0.1684 *9.8≈ 1.651. So total ≈ 156.8 +1.651= 158.451.

Then, 9.8 * (-0.02429 x) ≈ -0.2384 x.

9.8 * (x²/109561) = (9.8 x²)/109561 ≈ 0.0000893 x².

So putting it all together:

2x ≈ 158.451 - 0.2384 x + 0.0000893 x².

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 158.451 - 0.2384 x + 0.0000893 x² - 2x.

Combine like terms:

0.0000893 x² - (0.2384 + 2) x + 158.451 = 0.

Which is:

0.0000893 x² - 2.2384 x + 158.451 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let's write it as:

a x² + b x + c = 0.

Where a = 0.0000893,

b = -2.2384,

c = 158.451.

The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a).

Compute the discriminant D = b² -4ac.

b² = (2.2384)^2 = let's compute 2^2=4, 0.2384^2≈0.0568, 2*(2)(0.2384)=0.9528. So (2 + 0.2384)^2 = 4 + 0.9528 + 0.0568 ≈ 5.0096.

So D ≈ 5.0096 - 4*(0.0000893)*(158.451).

Compute 4ac: 4 *0.0000893 *158.451 ≈ 4 * 0.01414 (since 0.0000893 *158 ≈ 0.0141).

So 4ac ≈ 4 * 0.0141 ≈ 0.0564.

So D ≈5.0096 -0.0564 ≈4.9532.

Square root of D: sqrt(4.9532)≈2.2265.

Now, x = [2.2384 ± 2.2265]/(2 *0.0000893).

Compute numerator for the positive solution first:

2.2384 + 2.2265 =4.4649.

So x =4.4649 / (0.0001786).

Compute 4.4649 / 0.0001786.

Hmm, 4.4649 / 0.0001786 ≈ let's see:

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.0001: 44649 / 1.786 ≈ Approximately 25000? Let me compute 1.786 *25000=44650. So x≈25000.

Wait, that can't be right. That would imply the building is 25,000 meters tall, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra earlier. Let me check.

Wait, when I squared both sides of the equation, perhaps I introduced extraneous solutions, but getting 25,000 meters doesn't make any sense. So maybe I made a mistake in the algebra steps.

Let me re-examine the steps.

Original equation after substitution:

sqrt( (2x)/9.8 ) + x/331 = 4.021.

Let me try a different approach. Let me let’s assume that t2 is small compared to t1. For example, maybe the building is around 50 meters. Let's compute t1 and t2.

If h=50m,

t1 = sqrt(2*50/9.8) = sqrt(100/9.8) ≈sqrt(10.204) ≈3.193 s.

t2 =50/331 ≈0.151 s.

Total time =3.193 +0.151≈3.344 s, which is less than 4.021 s.

So, the building must be taller.

What if h=70 m?

t1= sqrt(2*70/9.8)=sqrt(140/9.8)=sqrt(14.2857)=≈3.78 s.

t2=70/331≈0.2115 s.

Total≈3.78+0.2115≈3.99 s. Close to 4.021. So the height is a bit higher than 70 m.

What about 71 m (option A)?

t1= sqrt(2*71/9.8)=sqrt(142/9.8)=sqrt(14.4898)=≈3.804 s.

t2=71/331≈0.2146 s.

Total≈3.804+0.2146≈4.0186 s. That's very close to 4.021 s.

So option A is 71 m. Let me check the options: option A is 71 m. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to solve the equation, I ended up with a very large x, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the quadratic approach isn't the best because the equation might be better solved numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra when expanding. Let me think: when I squared both sides, perhaps I should have kept more precise terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of trial and error is better, as the time is close to 4 seconds, and h=71 m gives a total time of about 4.0186, which is within 0.0024 seconds, which is probably within the calculation error.

So the correct answer is A:71m.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of the building, \( h \), given that the total time from dropping the balloon to hearing the splash is \( t_{\text{total}} = 4.021 \, \mathrm{s} \). This total time includes two components: the time it takes for the balloon to fall (\( t_1 \)) and the time it takes for the sound of the splash to travel back up to the roof (\( t_2 \)).

### Step 1: Key Equations
1. **Free fall equation**:  
   The time for the balloon to fall is given by:  
   \[
   t_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}
   \]  
   where \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. **Sound travel equation**:  
   The time for the sound to travel back up is:  
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{h}{v_{\text{sound}}}
   \]  
   where \( v_{\text{sound}} = 331 \, \mathrm{m/s} \).

3. **Total time**:  
   The total time is the sum of \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \):  
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} + \frac{h}{v_{\text{sound}}}
   \]

### Step 2: Solve for \( h \)
Substituting the known values into the total time equation:  
\[
4.021 = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{9.8}} + \frac{h}{331}
\]

This equation is nonlinear and challenging to solve algebraically. Instead, we can use trial and error to estimate \( h \).

### Step 3: Trial and Error
1. **For \( h = 70 \, \mathrm{m} \):**  
   \[
   t_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2(70)}{9.8}} = \sqrt{14.2857} \approx 3.78 \, \mathrm{s}
   \]  
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{70}{331} \approx 0.2115 \, \mathrm{s}
   \]  
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = 3.78 + 0.2115 \approx 3.99 \, \mathrm{s}
   \]  
   This is slightly less than \( 4.021 \, \mathrm{s} \), so the building must be slightly taller than \( 70 \, \mathrm{m} \).

2. **For \( h = 71 \, \mathrm{m} \):**  
   \[
   t_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2(71)}{9.8}} = \sqrt{14.4898} \approx 3.804 \, \mathrm{s}
   \]  
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{71}{331} \approx 0.2146 \, \mathrm{s}
   \]  
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = 3.804 + 0.2146 \approx 4.0186 \, \mathrm{s}
   \]  
   This is very close to \( 4.021 \, \mathrm{s} \), making \( h = 71 \, \mathrm{m} \) the best estimate.

### Step 4: Verify the Answer
The height of the building is approximately \( 71 \, \mathrm{m} \), which matches option **A**.
