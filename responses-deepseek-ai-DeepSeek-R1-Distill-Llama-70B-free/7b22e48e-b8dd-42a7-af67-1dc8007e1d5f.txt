Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Okay, the question is about converting mass entirely into energy and then using that energy to power a light bulb. Hmm, I remember that Einstein's equation E=mc² is involved here. Oh right, that's the one that relates mass and energy. So the key is to find out how much energy is produced when 1 kg is converted, and then see how long that energy can power a 100-W bulb.

Wait, the bulb uses 100 J each second. So, 100 watts means 100 joules per second. Right, because a watt is a joule per second. So the bulb consumes energy at that rate.

First, I need to calculate the total energy from the 1 kg mass. E = mc². What's the value of c? Oh, speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Squaring that gives 9 x 10^16 m²/s².

So putting it in, E = 1 kg * (3e8)^2. Let me calculate that: 3e8 squared is 9e16. So E = 1 * 9e16 = 9e16 joules. Okay, that's a lot of energy.

Now, the light bulb uses 100 J every second. So the total time the bulb can run is the total energy divided by the power. So time t = E / P. E is 9e16 J, P is 100 W (which is 100 J/s). So t = (9e16) / 100 = 9e14 seconds. Wait, because 9e16 divided by 100 is 9e14.

But the answer options are in years, not seconds. So I need to convert seconds into years. How many seconds are in a year? Hmm. Let's think. A year is 365 days. Each day has 24 hours, each hour 60 minutes, each minute 60 seconds. So 365 * 24 * 60 * 60.

Calculating that: 365 * 24 is 8760 hours in a year. Then 8760 * 60 = 525,600 minutes. 525,600 * 60 = 31,536,000 seconds. So approximately 3.154e7 seconds per year.

So the time in years is t_seconds divided by seconds per year. So 9e14 s / 3.154e7 s/year. Let me compute that. 9e14 / 3.154e7 is the same as (9 / 3.154) * 1e7. 9 divided by 3.154 is approximately 2.852. So 2.852e7 years. Wait, that's about 2.85 x 10^7 years.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B is 1.2e7, which is way smaller. Option E is 5.5e7, which is bigger. Option G is 4.2e7. Hmmm, wait, wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial energy calculation. E=mc²: 1kg*(3e8)^2 = 9e16 J. Yes, that's correct. Then, 9e16 J / 100 J/s = 9e14 seconds.

Wait, 9e14 divided by 3.154e7 is approximately (9 /3.154) * 1e7.

9 divided by 3.154: 3.154 goes into 9 about 2.85 times, so 2.85e7 years. Looking at the options, I don't see 2.85e7. Hmm, let's look again.

The options are:

A: 3e7

B:1.2e7

C:9e6

D:2e8

E:5.5e7

F:7.5e6

G:4.2e7

H:2.9e7

I:1.5e7

J:6.3e7

Oh wait, option H is 2.9e7. So my calculation came to around 2.85e7, which is about 2.9e7. So H would be the closest.

But wait another thing: perhaps I made a mistake in the number of seconds per year. Let me recalculate that more accurately.

Seconds in a year: 365 days * 24 * 60 * 60.

365 * 24 = 8760.

8760 * 60 = 525600.

525600 *60=31,536,000 seconds. So that's 3.1536e7 seconds.

So 9e14 / 3.1536e7 = (9e14)/(3.1536e7) = (9/3.1536) * 1e7.

9 divided by 3.1536 is approximately 2.852. So 2.852e7 years. So that's approximately 2.85e7. So the closest option is option H:2.9e7 years.

Wait, but wait. Let me try another approach. Let me compute 9e16 J / 100 J/s = 9e14 s.

Now, 1 year is about 3.154e7 seconds.

So 9e14 / 3.154e7 = (9 /3.154) * 1e7.

Compute 9 ÷3.154.

3.154 × 2 =6.308.

3.154 ×2.8= 3.154 *2=6.308, 3.154 *0.8=2.5232. So 6.308+2.5232=8.8312. That's for 2.8 times.

3.154 *2.85 = ?

2.8 gives 8.8312. 0.05 more: 3.154 *0.05 =0.1577. So 8.8312+0.1577=8.9889. Which is close to 9.

So 2.85 times.

So 2.85e7 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:2.9e7. So that's the answer.

To determine how long a 100-W light bulb could be illuminated by converting 1 kg of mass entirely into energy, we use Einstein's equation \( E = mc^2 \). Here, \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so:

\[
E = 1 \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{J}.
\]

The light bulb consumes energy at a rate of \( 100 \, \text{J/s} \), so the total time the bulb can operate is:

\[
t = \frac{E}{P} = \frac{9 \times 10^{16}}{100} = 9 \times 10^{14} \, \text{seconds}.
\]

To convert seconds into years, we use the fact that one year has approximately \( 3.154 \times 10^7 \, \text{seconds} \). Thus:

\[
t = \frac{9 \times 10^{14}}{3.154 \times 10^7} = \frac{9}{3.154} \times 10^7 \approx 2.85 \times 10^7 \, \text{years}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \( 2.85 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \) is \( 2.9 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \), which corresponds to option **H**.

**Answer: H**
