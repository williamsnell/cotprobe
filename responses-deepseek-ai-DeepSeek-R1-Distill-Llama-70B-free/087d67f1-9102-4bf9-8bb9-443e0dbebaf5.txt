Question:

A defendant was convicted of assault of a federal officer and imprisoned in a federal penitentiary. While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, "You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. " Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted?

Options:

A: Yes, because the informant was acting as an agent of the government in a deceptive manner.
B: No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.
C: Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.
D: No, because the confession was made to a fellow inmate, not to a law enforcement official.
E: Yes, because the defendant was not read his Miranda rights before confessing to the informant.
F: Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.
G: No, because the defendant was not under direct questioning by law enforcement at the time of the confession.
H: No, because the confession was voluntary.
I: No, because the defendant was already convicted of a crime and thus lost his right to avoid self-incrimination.
J: No, because the defendant's safety in prison was not the responsibility of the informant.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with confessions and the use of informants. I'm a bit rusty on my law, but I'll try to think this through.

The scenario is: A defendant was convicted of assaulting a federal officer and is in a federal prison. While there, federal agents start investigating the murder of his 11-year-old stepdaughter from two years prior. They think he did it. So, they plant an informant in the prison. The informant pretends to be an organized crime figure and befriends the defendant. The defendant is getting threatened by other inmates because of a rumor he killed a child. The informant brings up the subject several times, but the defendant denies it. Later, when the defendant is getting rough treatment, the informant offers to protect him but says, "You have to tell me the truth... if you want me to help you." The defendant then confesses to the informant, who was working for the government. Now, the defendant moves to suppress this statement before trial.

The question is whether the motion to suppress should be granted.

The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that under US law, confessions must be voluntary to be admissible. The key case here is probably Hoffa v. United States, where the Supreme Court held that the use of a paid informant did not necessarily make a confession involuntary, especially if the informant didn't use coercive tactics.

In this case, the informant was acting on behalf of the government. The defendant was in a prison setting, and the informant offered protection in exchange for the truth. So, the question is whether this constitutes coercion or whether the confession was voluntary.

I think about the concept of "voluntariness." The court looks at the totality of circumstances to determine if the confession was voluntary. Factors include whether there was physical or psychological coercion, promises made, etc.

Here, the informant offered protection from other inmates in exchange for the truth. The defendant was under threat, so perhaps the informant's offer could be seen as creating a situation where the defendant felt compelled to confess to avoid harm.

But wait, in Hoffa, the Court said that even if the informant was a friend, as long as there was no coercion, the confession stands. So if the informant didn't make any threats or promises beyond what a friend might, it's okay.

In this case, the informant's promise of protection could be seen as a promise that might induce a confession. But I also recall that in some cases, offering protection doesn't necessarily make the confession involuntary if the defendant is in a situation where he's already under threat from others. The government isn't directly causing the threat, so maybe it's not coercion by the state.

Alternatively, the argument could be that the government created the situation by placing the informant, who then offered protection. But I think the courts have held that as long as the government didn't directly cause the coercion, it's acceptable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the informant was acting as an agent of the government in a deceptive manner. But I think deception alone isn't enough; it's about whether it's coercive.

Option B: No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct wasn't inherently coercive. This seems plausible because the informant didn't use physical force or threats, just offered protection, which might not be enough.

Option C: Yes, because the informant was a false friend. But Hoffa says that's not sufficient grounds to suppress.

Option D: No, because the confession was to a fellow inmate. But that's not the issue; the issue is whether it was voluntary.

Option E: Yes, because Miranda rights weren't read. But Miranda applies when the defendant is in custody and being interrogated by a government agent. Here, the informant is a private citizen, so Miranda doesn't apply. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of violence, absent protection. So the threat was from other inmates, not the government. The government didn't create the threat, so maybe this isn't coercion by the state. Unless the government's actions somehow made the situation worse.

Option G: No, because not under direct questioning by law enforcement. That's true, but the issue is voluntariness, not Miranda.

Option H: No, because the confession was voluntary. This depends on the analysis.

Option I: No, because he was already convicted. But the right against self-incrimination still applies in future prosecutions, so this isn't correct.

Option J: No, because the informant wasn't responsible for his safety. Not sure, but the point is about the voluntariness of the confession.

So, putting it together, the key issue is whether the informant's actions constituted coercion. The government's informant offered protection in exchange for the truth, but the threat was from other inmates, not the government. So, under the totality of circumstances, it's likely that the confession was voluntary because there was no overt coercion by the government. Therefore, the motion to suppress should not be granted.

Looking back at the options, option B says no because under totality, the conduct wasn't coercive. Option H says no because voluntary. So which is correct?

Hoffa's case is similar. The Court held that the informant's actions, being a friend, didn't make the confession involuntary. So here, the informant didn't make any threats; he just offered protection, which may have induced the confession, but if it's not seen as coercive, then it's voluntary.

So the answer would be either B or H. Wait, option B is about the conduct not being inherently coercive, and option H is about the confession being voluntary.

In the case, the defendant was under duress from other inmates, but the government didn't create that situation. So the offer of protection might be seen as a factor, but not enough to make it involuntary.

So I think the correct answer is B or H. Wait, but in the scenario, the defendant was already being threatened, and the informant offered protection only if he told the truth. Does that constitute a promise that would make the confession involuntary?

I think the key is that the government didn't create the threat. The threat was from other inmates. The informant's offer of protection in exchange for the truth might be seen as an inducement, but not necessarily coercion. The court would look at whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would feel compelled to confess.

If the defendant felt that without the informant's protection, he'd be harmed, but the government didn't cause that situation, then it's not coercive. Therefore, the confession is voluntary.

So the answer would be either B or H. Since option H directly states the confession was voluntary, which aligns with the analysis, I think H is correct. Alternatively, B talks about the conduct not being inherently coercive, which also supports the same conclusion.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Supreme Court in Arizona v. Roberson held that police conduct that they know would lead the suspect to believe that their only way to get help is to confess may be coercive. But in this case, the informant wasn't a police officer, so maybe that's different.

Alternatively, in United States v. Henry, the Court held that the government cannot use promises of leniency or protection to induce a confession. But in that case, the informant was used to obtain information, and the Court found that the defendant's confession was involuntary because the government had promised protection in exchange for information.

Wait, that's a key point. In Henry, the Court said that when the government uses an informant to extract a confession under circumstances that would create a substantial risk of coercion, it's a violation. So in that case, the informant promised protection, and the Court found the confession involuntary.

So in our case, the informant offered protection in exchange for the truth, which might be similar to Henry. So the answer would be that the confession should be suppressed because the informant's promise of protection made it involuntary. That would support option A, C, F, or H.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me clarify. In Henry, the Court held that the confession was involuntary because the government's informant created a situation where the defendant reasonably believed he needed to confess to obtain protection, which the Court found to be coercive. So in that case, the motion to suppress was granted.

In our case, the facts are similar: the informant offers protection in exchange for the truth, and the defendant confesses. So under Henry, this would render the confession involuntary, so the motion should be granted.

Looking at the options, option F says yes because the confession was coerced by the threat of violence, absent protection. That seems to align with Henry.

So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but earlier I thought the threat wasn't from the government, but Henry says that the government's actions through the informant can create the coercive situation.

So in this case, the government placed the informant, who then offered protection in exchange for the confession. So the government's action indirectly created the situation where the defendant felt compelled to confess to get protection.

So under Henry, the confession would be involuntary, and the motion to suppress granted. So the answer would be F.

But let me check the options again. Option F is: Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.

Yes, that seems to fit.

Alternatively, option A says yes because the informant was deceptive. But Henry wasn't about deception; it was about the offer of protection.

So I think the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's confession to a government informant should be suppressed. The key issue is voluntariness under the totality of circumstances. The informant, acting on behalf of the government, offered protection to the defendant in exchange for the truth, while the defendant was already under threat from other inmates due to a rumor. The analysis hinges on whether this offer of protection constituted coercion.

Under **United States v. Henry**, the Supreme Court held that when the government uses an informant to extract a confession by offering protection or leniency, it can create a coercive environment, rendering the confession involuntary. In this case, the informant's offer of protection in exchange for the truth aligns with the coercive scenario described in **Henry**. The government, through the informant, created a situation where the defendant reasonably believed he had to confess to obtain protection, thereby compelling the confession.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Deception alone does not render a confession involuntary; the focus is on coercion.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the informant's conduct may not be inherently coercive, the offer of protection in exchange for the truth creates a coercive dynamic under **Henry**.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The "false friend" doctrine is not sufficient grounds for suppression without evidence of coercion.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The confession's admissibility does not depend on whether it was made to a fellow inmate but on voluntariness.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. **Miranda** rights do not apply here because the informant was not a law enforcement official conducting interrogation.
- **Option F**: Correct. The confession was coerced by the threat of violence, and the informant's offer of protection motivated the defendant to confess, aligning with **Henry**.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The issue is voluntariness, not whether the defendant was under direct questioning by law enforcement.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The confession was not voluntary due to the coercive nature of the informant's offer of protection.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The defendant's prior conviction does not negate his right against self-incrimination in this case.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The informant's responsibility for the defendant's safety is irrelevant to the voluntariness of the confession.

The correct answer is **F**, as the confession was coerced by the threat of violence and the informant's offer of protection, making it involuntary under **Henry**.

Answer: F
