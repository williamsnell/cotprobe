Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a stone being thrown horizontally from a bridge with an initial speed of 30 m/s. I need to find the stone's total speed when it hits the water 4 seconds later. They also mentioned that air resistance is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects are thrown horizontally, their horizontal and vertical motions are independent. Oh right, that's because in projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components are treated separately. So the horizontal speed doesn't affect the vertical, and vice versa.

So the initial speed is 30 m/s horizontally. That means the horizontal component of the velocity (let's call it v_x) is 30 m/s and stays the same throughout the motion because there's no air resistance (so no horizontal forces acting on it). So v_x remains 30 m/s the whole time.

Now, the vertical motion. Since the stone is thrown horizontally, the initial vertical velocity (v_y) is 0. But gravity will act on it, causing it to accelerate downward. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s² downward. 

Since the stone is in free fall for 4 seconds, I can calculate the vertical component of the velocity at that time. The formula for velocity under constant acceleration is v = u + at. Here, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is 9.8 m/s², and t is 4 seconds.

Let me plug the numbers in. So v_y = 0 + 9.8 * 4. Let's calculate that. 9.8 *4 is 39.2 m/s. So the vertical component of the velocity when it hits the water is 39.2 m/s downward.

Wait, but wait. I should make sure about the direction. Since it's moving downward, the velocity is positive in the downward direction, but when calculating speed, direction doesn't matter because speed is scalar. So the magnitude is 39.2 m/s.

Now, to find the total speed of the stone when it enters the water, I need to find the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector. The velocity has two components: v_x and v_y. Since these are perpendicular to each other, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total speed.

So total speed v = sqrt(v_x² + v_y²). Plugging the numbers in: v_x is 30, v_y is 39.2.

Calculating each square: 30 squared is 900, and 39.2 squared is approximately... let's see, 39^2 is 1521, 0.2^2 is 0.04, and the cross term 2*39*0.2 is 15.6. So (39.2)^2 is 39^2 + 2*39*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 1521 + 15.6 + 0.04 = 1536.64.

Adding 900 and 1536.64 gives 2436.64. Then take the square root of that. Let me think, what's the square root of 2436.64?

I remember that 49^2 is 2401, because 50^2 is 2500. So 49^2 = 2401. 49.2^2 would be (49 + 0.2)^2 = 49^2 + 2*49*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 2401 + 19.6 + 0.04 = 2420.64. Hmm, but our number is 2436.64, which is higher.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's see, 49.36^2 is 2436.64, because 49.36 squared equals (49 + 0.36)^2. Let's check: 49^2=2401, 2*49*0.36=35.28, and 0.36^2=0.1296. So adding all together: 2401 +35.28 = 2436.28, plus 0.1296 is 2436.4096, which is approximately 2436.41. So the square root of 2436.64 is approximately 49.36 m/s.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check those numbers because I might have messed up the exact value of 39.2 squared. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 39.2 *39.2 more accurately. 

39.2 * 39.2: Let's compute 39 *39 = 1521. Then, 39 *0.2 is 7.8, so 0.2*39.2 is 7.84. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute it step by step.

39.2 * 39.2: 

= (30 +9.2) * (30 +9.2)
= 30^2 + 2*(30)*(9.2) + (9.2)^2
= 900 + 2*276 + 84.64
= 900 + 552 = 1452, plus 84.64 gives 1536.64. Oh wait, that's correct. So v_x squared is 900, v_y squared is 1536.64, sum is 2436.64.

So the square root is sqrt(2436.64) = 49.36 m/s.

Looking at the answer options: 

A: 100 m/s → way too high.

B:50→ No, 49.36 is about 50 but in the options, is there a closer one?

Wait, the options are:

A:100

B:50

C:70

D:30

E:110

F:120

G:60

H:80

I:90

J:40

Wait, so 49.36 is closest to 50 m/s, which is option B. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recalculate the vertical velocity. Oh wait, the acceleration is 9.8 m/s², and time is 4 seconds. So v_y = 9.8 *4 = 39.2 m/s. That's correct.

So the horizontal component is 30, vertical 39.2. The resultant speed is sqrt(30² +39.2²) = sqrt(900 +1536.64)=sqrt(2436.64)=49.36 m/s.

So the total speed is approximately 49.36 m/s, which is closest to option B:50 m/s.

But wait, let me check if any of the options match exactly. Let me think again: 30^2 is 900, 39.2^2 is 1536.64, sum is 2436.64. Square root is 49.36. The options don't have 49.36, but option B is 50.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether to take g as 10 m/s² for simplicity, but in that case, the vertical speed would be 40 m/s, making the total speed sqrt(30^2 +40^2) = 50 m/s exactly, which would be option B.

Ah, maybe the problem expects us to use g=10 m/s² for simplicity. Let me recalculate with g=10.

So v_y = 10 m/s² *4 s =40 m/s.

Then, the total speed is sqrt(30^2 +40^2) = sqrt(900+1600) = sqrt(2500)=50 m/s. So that's exactly option B.

The question didn't specify the value of g, but in many textbooks, especially in introductory problems, g is taken as 10 m/s² for simplification. So perhaps the intended answer is 50 m/s.

So the correct answer is B:50 m/s.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the stone as a projectile. The stone is thrown horizontally with an initial speed of \( v_x = 30 \, \text{m/s} \), and its horizontal motion remains unchanged throughout because there is no air resistance. The vertical motion is influenced by gravity, with an acceleration of \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

The vertical velocity \( v_y \) after 4 seconds is calculated using the formula \( v_y = u + at \), where \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \) (initial vertical velocity), \( a = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( t = 4 \, \text{s} \). This gives:

\[
v_y = 0 + 9.8 \cdot 4 = 39.2 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The total speed of the stone is the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector, which combines the horizontal and vertical components. Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}.
\]

Substituting \( v_x = 30 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( v_y = 39.2 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
v = \sqrt{30^2 + 39.2^2} = \sqrt{900 + 1536.64} = \sqrt{2436.64} \approx 49.36 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

However, in many introductory problems, \( g \) is often approximated as \( 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for simplicity. Recalculating with \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):

\[
v_y = 10 \cdot 4 = 40 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Then, the total speed becomes:

\[
v = \sqrt{30^2 + 40^2} = \sqrt{900 + 1600} = \sqrt{2500} = 50 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

This matches option B exactly. Therefore, the total speed of the stone when it enters the water is approximately \( 50 \, \text{m/s} \).
