Okay, so I have this question about Francois Quesnay and the Physiocrats. I remember that they were economists from before Adam Smith. The question is asking why they argued that the source of all wealth is agriculture. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I think the Physiocrats were a school of thought in economics. They were big on agriculture being the primary source of wealth. I recall that they believed that only through agriculture could you have a net product because it's the only sector that can produce more than what's put into it. They might have argued that other sectors, like manufacturing or services, don't generate new wealth but just transform existing materials.

So looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says wealth is based on financial investments and the stock market. That doesn't sound right for Physiocrats because they were more about the real economy, especially agriculture. Option B suggests wealth comes from the working class's labor. That sounds more Marxist, not Physiocratic. They were more about land and agriculture than labor.

Option C is about arts and culture. No way, that's probably not it. Option D says commerce is the source. I think they downplayed the role of commerce compared to agriculture. They might have seen commerce as just moving existing wealth, not creating new.

Option E is government policy. I don't think that's it. The Physiocrats were more about natural resources and production. Option F says industry is the source. Wait, no, because before the Industrial Revolution, Physiocrats were more focused on agriculture. They didn't see industry as the main source yet.

Option G is about natural resources like mining. But I think they specifically emphasized agriculture over other natural resources. Mining might be part of it, but the question says agriculture is the source, so G might not be the answer.

Option H says agriculture is the only possible source of new wealth. That rings a bell. I remember the term 'net product' from their theories, meaning that only agriculture produces a surplus beyond what's needed for input costs. So, other sectors don't add new wealth, just circulate existing resources.

Option I is about technological innovation. While important, I don't think that's why the Physiocrats focused on agriculture. They were more into the land's productivity rather than technology driving wealth.

Option J says wealth is created through trade. Again, that's more like mercantilism or maybe Adam Smith's ideas about trade benefiting countries. Physiocrats were more about production, especially in agriculture.

So putting it all together, the Physiocrats believed that only agriculture could create new wealth because it's the only sector with a net product. Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

The Physiocrats, led by Francois Quesnay, argued that agriculture is the sole source of new wealth because it uniquely generates a net productâ€”a surplus beyond the inputs required for production. This belief was central to their economic theory, as they viewed other sectors like manufacturing and commerce as merely transforming existing resources rather than creating new wealth. Among the options provided, the one that aligns with this reasoning is:

H: Agriculture is the only possible source of new wealth.

Answer: H
