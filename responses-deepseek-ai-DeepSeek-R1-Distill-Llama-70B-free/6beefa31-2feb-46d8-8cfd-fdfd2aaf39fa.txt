Okay, so I've got this problem here about carburizing steel. Hmm, I remember that carburizing is a process where carbon is diffused into a metal to increase its surface hardness. The question gives some parameters, and I need to calculate the carbon concentration at certain depths after a specific time.

Let me read the question again. The initial carbon concentration is 0.30% by weight. The steel is placed in a carburizing atmosphere for 1.5 hours. The surface concentration (c_A,s) is 0.75%. The diffusivity (D) of carbon in steel is 1.1 × 10^-11 m²/sec. I need to find the concentration at 0.015 cm, 0.025 cm, and 0.045 cm under the surface.

Wait, okay, I think this is a diffusion problem, probably using Fick's laws. Since it's a semi-infinite solid with a constant surface concentration, the error function solution would apply here. Oh right, the equation is:

c(x,t) = c_A,s + (c_initial - c_A,s) * erf(x/(2*sqrt(D*t)))

Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think the equation is:

(c - c_initial)/(c_surface - c_initial) = 1 - erf(x/(2*sqrt(D*t)))

Alternatively, I might have it mixed up. Let me think. Oh right, the correct form is:

(c - c0)/(c_s - c0) = 1 - erf(x/(2√(D t)))

Where:
- c is the concentration at depth x and time t,
- c0 is the initial concentration,
- c_s is the surface concentration,
- D is the diffusivity,
- t is time.

So I can rearrange this to solve for c.

Let me plug in the numbers. But first, I need to make sure all units are consistent. The diffusivity is given in m²/s, time is in hours, so I need to convert time to seconds. Let's compute that.

Time t = 1.5 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 5400 seconds.

The depth x is given in centimeters, so I should convert that to meters. 

0.015 cm = 0.00015 meters,
0.025 cm = 0.00025 meters,
0.045 cm = 0.00045 meters.

Wait, wait. No, wait 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 0.015 cm is 0.0015 meters (since 0.015 cm = 1.5e-3 m), same for the others.

Wait, wait, actually, 1 cm = 0.01 m. So 0.015 cm is 0.015 * 0.01 m = 0.00015 m, which is 1.5e-4 m. Yes, that's correct.

So for each x (depth), compute the argument for the error function, which is x/(2*sqrt(D*t)).

Let me compute D*t first. D is 1.1e-11 m²/s, t is 5400 s.

D*t = 1.1e-11 * 5400 = Let me compute that. 1.1 *5400 = 5940, so D*t=5.94e-8 m².

Take the square root: sqrt(5.94e-8) = Let's compute that. So sqrt(5.94) is about 2.437, and sqrt(1e-8) is 1e-4. So 2.437e-4 m.

Then, 2*sqrt(D*t) = 2 * 2.437e-4 = 4.874e-4 m.

Now, for each x, compute x/(4.874e-4 m), then plug into the error function.

Let me compute each x value:

1. x = 0.00015 m (0.015 cm):

x/(2√(D t)) = 0.00015 / (4.874e-4) ≈ 0.00015 / 0.0004874 ≈ 0.3076

2. x=0.00025 m (0.025 cm):

0.00025 / 0.0004874 ≈ 0.5127

3. x=0.00045 m (0.045 cm):

0.00045 /0.0004874 ≈ 0.923.

Now I need to find the error function for each of these values. Hmm, I don't remember the exact values, but I can approximate them using a table or an approximate formula.

I remember that the error function erf(z) can be approximated, and for small z, it's roughly (2/sqrt(π)) (z - z^3/3 + z^5/10 - ... ), but for larger z, maybe using a table.

Alternatively, I can use an approximate polynomial for erf(z). Let me think about some standard values.

z=0.3:

erf(0.3) ≈ 0.3286

z=0.5:

erf(0.5)=0.5205

z=0.92:

What's erf(0.92)? Let me think. I remember that erf(1)=0.8427, erf(0.9)=0.7969, erf(0.95)=0.8209. So erf(0.92) would be between 0.7969 and 0.8209.

Alternatively, let's interpolate using a table I recall.

Wait, I might be mixing up exact values, but perhaps using an approximate method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation formula for erf(z). Let me think. One approximation is:

For z ≤ 0.75, erf(z) ≈ (2/sqrt(π)) (z - z^3/3 + z^5/10 - z^7/42 + ... )

But maybe it's easier to use a table lookup.

Alternatively, maybe I should just try to remember approximate values.

Wait, for z=0.3076, let me call it approximately 0.31.

Looking at a table:

z | erf(z)
0.3 | 0.3286
0.31 | approximately 0.33?

Hmm, perhaps interpolating. Let me see, 0.3 is 0.3286, 0.31 is 0.33?

Wait, wait, perhaps I can use a more precise method.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion for erf(z) around z=0.3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the values for each z.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the following approach:

Compute 1 - erf(z), which is the same as the complementary error function erfc(z). But I'll proceed.

So for each z:

z1=0.3076 → erfc(z1) = 1 - erf(z1) = ?

z2=0.5127 → erfc(z2)=1 - erf(z2)

z3=0.923 → erfc(z3)=1 - erf(z3)

Let me try to compute approximate values for each.

For z1=0.3076:

Using the approximation erf(z)= (2/sqrt(pi)) (z - z^3/3 + z^5/10 - z^7/42 + ... )

z=0.3076

Compute terms up to z^7.

z=0.3076

Term 1: z = 0.3076

Term 2: z^3/3 = (0.3076)^3 / 3 ≈ (0.0291) /3 ≈ 0.0097

Term3: z^5/10 = (0.3076)^5 /10 ≈ (0.0282) /10 ≈ 0.00282

Term4: z^7/42 = (0.3076)^7 /42 ≈ (0.0275)/42 ≈ 0.000655

So erf(z) ≈ (2/sqrt(pi)) [0.3076 - 0.0097 + 0.00282 -0.000655 ]

Compute the bracket:

0.3076 -0.0097 = 0.2979

+0.00282 → 0.3007

-0.000655 → ~0.30005

Multiply by 2/sqrt(pi). sqrt(pi)=1.77245, so 2/1.77245≈1.128.

So 1.128 * 0.30005 ≈ 0.339.

But wait, I think for higher z, say beyond 0.3, the approximation might not be the best. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a table value. Wait, from my memory, erf(0.3)=0.3286, erf(0.31)=approx 0.33, erf(0.3076) would be about 0.33 perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the better approach is to use the complementary error function (erfc(z)) and use an approximation for it.

Wait, another approach: for z up to 0.95, erfc(z) can be approximated with:

erfc(z) ≈ (e^{-z²} )*(a1 + a2 z + a3 z² + a4 z^3) / (1 + b1 z + b2 z^2 + b3 z^3 + b4 z^4 )

But I'm not sure of the exact coefficients, so perhaps it's better to just proceed with known approximate values.

Alternatively, I can use the following approximate values:

z=0.3076 → erf(z)= approx 0.33.

z=0.5127 → erf(z)= approx 0.52.

z=0.923 → erf(z)= approx 0.80 (since erf(0.9)=0.7969, erf(1.0)=0.8427, so 0.923 would be around 0.80 maybe? Let me think. At 0.9, 0.7969; 0.95 is 0.8209. So 0.923 is between 0.9 and 0.95. Maybe around 0.806? I'm not sure, perhaps I can use a linear approximation.

Wait, from z=0.9 to z=1.0, erf increases from 0.7969 to 0.8427, which is about 0.0458 increase over 0.1 z. So for z=0.923, which is 0.923=0.9 +0.023, so the increase would be 0.023/0.1 * 0.0458 ≈ 0.0105. So 0.7969 + 0.0105≈0.8074.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed with these approximate values.

So now, the equation is:

(c - 0.30) / (0.75 - 0.30) = 1 - erf(z)

(c - 0.3)/(0.45) = 1 - erf(z)

So c = 0.3 + 0.45*(1 - erf(z)).

Wait, no, wait. The equation is (c - c0)/(c_s - c0) = 1 - erf(z), so

c = c0 + (c_s - c0) * (1 - erf(z)).

Wait, wait: c = c0 + (c_s - c0) * [1 - erf(z/(2√(D t)))].

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let me double-check the equation. Fick's second law for a semi-infinite solid with constant surface concentration:

c(x,t) = c_s + (c0 - c_s) * erf( x/(2√(D t)) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

The correct equation is:

(c(x,t) - c_initial) / (c_surface - c_initial) = 1 - erf( x/(2√(D t)) )

So,

c(x,t) = c_initial + (c_surface - c_initial) * [1 - erf(x/(2√(D t})]

So yes, c = c0 + (c_s - c0) * (1 - erf(z)), where z = x/(2√(D t)).

So for each x, compute z, then compute 1 - erf(z), multiply by (0.75-0.30)=0.45, then add 0.30.

So let's compute each depth.

First depth: x=0.015 cm = 0.00015 m → z=0.3076.

Assume erf(z)=0.33.

Then,

c = 0.30 + 0.45*(1 - 0.33) = 0.30 + 0.45*(0.67) = 0.30 + 0.3015 = 0.6015% → approx 0.60%.

Wait, but maybe I was too approximate with erf(z)=0.33. Let's see, if the exact value is 0.3286 for z=0.3, then for z=0.3076, it's maybe around 0.33.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more accurate. Let me try to get better approximate values for each z.

Let me think about using a table of erf(z) values.

Looking up a table of erf(z):

For z=0.3076, let's approximate it between z=0.3 and z=0.31.

z | erf(z)
0.3 | 0.3286
0.31 | 0.3415 (I think. Wait, perhaps I'm making this up. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that erf(0.3)=0.3286, erf(0.35)=0.3794, so perhaps for z=0.3076, it's around 0.33, as before.

So let's proceed with erf(z1)=0.33.

Then,

c1 = 0.3 + 0.45*(1 - 0.33) = 0.3 + 0.45*(0.67)= 0.3 + 0.3015=0.6015 → ~0.60%.

Second depth: x=0.025 cm → 0.00025 m → z=0.5127.

Erf(z)=erf(0.5127). Let me think. From the table, erf(0.5)=0.5205, erf(0.52)=approx 0.5478? Wait, perhaps I can estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps using erf(0.5)=0.5205, erf(0.6)=0.6039, so for z=0.5127, which is about 0.51, the erf would be around 0.54 perhaps.

Wait, actually, no, because erf(0.5)=0.5205, erf(0.51) would be slightly higher. Let me think, using a linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

The difference between erf(0.5)=0.5205 and erf(0.6)=0.6039 is 0.0834 over 0.1 z. So per 0.01 z, it's 0.00834.

So for z=0.51, which is 0.01 above 0.5, erf(z)=0.5205 + 0.00834=0.5288.

Similarly, z=0.5127 is 0.0127 above 0.5 → 0.0127*(0.0834/0.1)=0.0127 * 0.834= ~0.0106. So erf(z)=0.5205 + 0.0106=0.5311.

Wait, but that's a rough approximation. Alternatively, perhaps using a better method.

Alternatively, I can use the Taylor expansion around z=0.5.

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Let's proceed with erf(0.5127)=0.53.

Then,

c2 = 0.3 + 0.45*(1 - 0.53) = 0.3 + 0.45*(0.47) = 0.3 + 0.2115=0.5115% → ~0.51%.

Wait, but perhaps I was too approximate. Let me try to get a better estimate for erf(0.5127).

Another approach: looking for more precise values. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator here, but since I can't, let's proceed with 0.53.

Third depth: x=0.045 cm → 0.00045 m → z=0.923.

Erf(0.923): Let's think. At z=0.9, erf=0.7969; z=1.0, erf=0.8427.

So for z=0.923, which is 0.023 above 0.9. The derivative of erf(z) at z=0.9 is (since d/dz erf(z) = 2/sqrt(pi) e^{-z²} ).

Compute 2/sqrt(pi)=1.128379.

At z=0.9, e^{-0.81}= e^{-0.81} ≈ 0.4449.

So the derivative is 1.128379 * 0.4449 ≈ 0.502.

So, the change in erf(z) for a small dz around z=0.9 is approximately 0.502 * dz.

So, for dz=0.023, the change in erf(z) is ~0.023 * 0.502 ≈ 0.0115.

So, erf(0.923) ≈ erf(0.9) + 0.0115=0.7969 +0.0115=0.8084.

Therefore, 1 - erf(z3)=1 -0.8084=0.1916.

So,

c3 = 0.3 + 0.45 * 0.1916 = 0.3 + 0.0862=0.3862% → ~0.39%.

Wait, so summarizing:

At 0.015 cm → 0.60%.

0.025 cm → 0.51%.

0.045 cm → 0.39%.

Looking at the options, let's see which option matches these values.

Option C: 0.60%, 0.51%, 0.39% → yes.

Option C says 0.60, 0.51, 0.39.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.58, 0.49, 0.37

B: 0.55, 0.45, 0.35

C: 0.60, 0.51,
