Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Lebesgue measure. Hmm, I remember Lebesgue measure is a way of assigning a "volume", "area", or "length" to subsets of n-dimensional space, right? For the real line, it's like the generalization of the notion of length.

The problem is: Let A be the set defined as A = {n + sum_{p=1}^∞ a_p 2^{-2p} : n is an integer, a_p is 0 or 1}. I need to find the Lebesgue measure of A.

Wait, so A is constructed by taking all integers n and adding to each a sum where each term is a_p times 2^{-2p}. The a_p can be either 0 or 1. So this sum is like a binary expansion but scaled by 2^{-2p} instead of 2^{-p}.

Let me try to parse this. Each element in A is an integer plus a sum of terms where each term is either 0 or 2^{-2p}. So for each p, we choose whether to add 2^{-2p} or not. So the sum is over p from 1 to infinity, which means it's an infinite series.

What does this look like? Let's write out the first few terms. For p=1, it's 2^{-2} = 1/4. p=2, 2^{-4}=1/16. p=3, 2^{-6}=1/64, etc. So each term is getting smaller, and the sum is between 0 and the sum of all 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... That's a geometric series with first term 1/4 and ratio 1/4, so the sum would be (1/4)/(1-1/4)) = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3. So each element is n plus a number between 0 and 1/3.

Wait, so each integer n is the base, and then we're adding a fractional part that's in [0, 1/3). Because each sum can't exceed 1/3, as I just calculated. So A is a union of intervals around each integer n, each interval being [n, n + 1/3).

But wait, n is any integer. So A is the union of [n, n + 1/3) for all integers n. So each of these intervals is of length 1/3, and they're spaced one unit apart.

Now, the Lebesgue measure of A would be the sum of the measures of these intervals because they're disjoint. Each interval has measure 1/3, and there are countably many of them (one for each integer n). But wait, the Lebesgue measure of a countable union of disjoint intervals is the sum of their lengths.

But wait, the sum of 1/3 over all integers n would be infinite, because there are infinitely many integers. So each n contributes 1/3, so the total measure would be (1/3) * ∞ = ∞.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would suggest the measure is infinity, but looking at the options, F is Infinity. But wait, the set A is a subset of the real line, right? So it's a countable union of intervals each of length 1/3. But wait, the Lebesgue measure is sigma-additive, so the measure would indeed be the sum of 1/3 over all integers n, which is infinite.

But wait a second, maybe I'm missing something. Because each element is n plus the sum, and the sum is between 0 and 1/3. So each n contributes an interval of length 1/3. But if you take all integers n, then the intervals [n, n + 1/3) for each n are non-overlapping and spread out all over the real line. So the total measure is indeed the sum over n of 1/3, which diverges. So the measure of A is infinite.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the sum is not varying with n, but for each n, the fractional part is in [0, 1/3). So for each n, the set is just [n, n + 1/3). So the entire set A is the union of these intervals. So yes, each is length 1/3, and there are countably infinitely many, so the measure is sum_{n} (1/3) = infinite.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum's upper limit. Let's check the sum of a_p 2^{-2p} with a_p 0 or 1. So the maximum sum would be when all a_p are 1. So sum_{p=1}^\infty 2^{-2p} = sum_{p=1}^\infty 1/(4^p). That's a geometric series with first term 1/4, ratio 1/4, so sum is (1/4) / (1 - 1/4)) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3. So yes, each interval is [n, n + 1/3), length 1/3.

So the measure is the sum over all n of 1/3, which is infinite. So the Lebesgue measure is infinite, which would correspond to option F.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: each element in A is n plus a number in [0, 1/3). So the set A is the union of [n, n + 1/3) for all integers n. The Lebesgue measure of each [n, n + 1/3) is 1/3, and since these intervals are disjoint, the measure of A is countably infinite times 1/3, which is infinity.

So the answer should be F: Infinity.

The set \( A \) is defined as \( A = \{n + \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} a_p 2^{-2p} : n \in \mathbf{Z}, a_p = 0 \text{ or } 1\} \). Each element of \( A \) consists of an integer \( n \) plus a sum where each term \( a_p 2^{-2p} \) is either 0 or \( 2^{-2p} \). The sum \( \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} a_p 2^{-2p} \) converges to a value in the interval \([0, 1/3)\), as the maximum sum occurs when all \( a_p = 1 \), giving \( \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} 2^{-2p} = 1/3 \).

Thus, \( A \) can be expressed as the union of intervals \( [n, n + 1/3) \) for all integers \( n \). Each interval has a Lebesgue measure of \( 1/3 \), and since these intervals are disjoint and spread across the real line, the total Lebesgue measure of \( A \) is the sum of the measures of these intervals. Because there are countably infinitely many such intervals, the total measure is infinite.

Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of \( A \) is **infinite**.
