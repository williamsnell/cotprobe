Okay, so I have this economics question here about elasticity of demand. Hmm, I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The question is about Mr. Krinsky selling chocolate bars.

At 25 cents each, he sells 100 per week. When he drops the price to 20 cents, sales go up to 110. I need to determine if the demand is elastic or inelastic.

Wait, elasticity is calculated using the formula: Elasticity (Ed) = (Percentage change in quantity demanded) / (Percentage change in price). If the absolute value is greater than 1, demand is elastic. Less than 1, inelastic. Exactly 1 is unit elastic.

So first, find the percentage change in quantity demanded. The quantity goes from 100 to 110 when price drops. The change is +10. So (10/100)*100 = 10% increase.

Percentage change in price: Price drops from 25 to 20 cents. The change is -5. So using the average of the two prices, maybe? Or calculate it as a percentage of the original price. Oh right, the formula uses the average of the initial and new price to calculate percentage change. Or wait, sometimes it's done using the initial price. Wait, actually, it's better to use the midpoint method for more accurate calculation, especially when the changes are large.

Wait, but in this case, the price change is from 25 to 20, which is a 5 cent decrease. So the percentage change in price is (5/25)*100 = 20% decrease. Because (change is 5, original price is 25). Or wait, some sources might average the initial and new price. Oh wait, the formula is: percentage change in price is (new price - old price)/(old price) *100. Or wait, sometimes it's done as (change)/(average of old and new). I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, another approach: using the initial price to calculate percentage change. So, the price drops by 5 cents from 25 to 20. So the percentage change is (5/25)*100 = 20% decrease.

So the percentage change in quantity is 10%, and the percentage change in price is 20% (but since it's a decrease, it's a negative value, but elasticity uses the absolute value).

So elasticity Ed = (10%) / (20%) = 0.5.

Since 0.5 is less than 1, the demand is inelastic. Wait, but waitâ€”when the price drops and quantity demanded increases, but elasticity is inelastic. Because the percentage change in quantity is smaller than the percentage change in price.

Wait, but I thought that when demand is elastic, a price decrease leads to an increase in quantity, and total revenue increases. Let me think about revenue. At 25 cents, revenue is 25 * 100 = 2500 cents. At 20 cents, it's 20 * 110 = 2200 cents. So revenue decreased from 2500 to 2200. That means when price drops and revenue drops, demand is inelastic. Because in elastic demand, revenue would increase when price decreases (since quantity effect outweighs price effect).

So in this case, when Mr. Krinskys lowers the price, his revenue goes down. That suggests inelastic demand because the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price, so elasticity is less than 1.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier gave Ed = 0.5, which is inelastic.

So the correct answer should be that the demand is inelastic.

Looking at the options, option C is Inelastic. Option A is elastic.

So the answer is C.

To determine whether the demand for chocolate bars is elastic or inelastic, we calculate the price elasticity of demand using the formula:

\[
\text{Elasticity (Ed)} = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate percentage change in quantity demanded
The quantity demanded increases from 100 bars to 110 bars when the price drops. The change in quantity is:

\[
\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded} = \frac{10}{100} \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### Step 2: Calculate percentage change in price
The price decreases from 25 cents to 20 cents. The change in price is:

\[
\text{Percentage change in price} = \frac{5}{25} \times 100 = 20\%
\]

### Step 3: Calculate elasticity
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Ed} = \frac{10\%}{20\%} = 0.5
\]

Since the elasticity value (0.5) is less than 1, the demand is **inelastic**. This means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price.

### Step 4: Verify with revenue
At 25 cents, revenue is:

\[
25 \times 100 = 2500 \text{ cents}
\]

At 20 cents, revenue is:

\[
20 \times 110 = 2200 \text{ cents}
\]

Revenue decreases when the price drops, further confirming that demand is inelastic (as revenue moves in the opposite direction of price when demand is inelastic).

### Final Answer
The demand for chocolate bars is **inelastic**.
