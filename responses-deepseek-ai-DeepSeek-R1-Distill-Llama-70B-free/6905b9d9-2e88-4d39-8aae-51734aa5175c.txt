Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with nuclear physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the minimum kinetic energy of a proton in a medium-sized nucleus.

Wait, the nucleus has a diameter of 8.0 x 10^-15 meters. I remember that the nucleus is really small, so that's a typical size. But how does that help me find the kinetic energy?

I think I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle here. Oh right! The uncertainty principle relates to the confinement of particles. Since the proton is confined in the nucleus, its position is somewhat known, which means its momentum must have some uncertainty. And from that, we can find a minimum kinetic energy.

So the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp the uncertainty in momentum, and h is Planck's constant. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on whether it's h or ħ (h-bar). Oh yeah, the formula with ħ is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the exact form, but since I can't, I'll proceed carefully.

Alternatively, I remember that for estimating the minimum kinetic energy, we can model the proton as a particle in a box. The idea is that the proton is confined within the nucleus, so its wavelength is related to the size of the nucleus.

The diameter is given as 8e-15 m, so the radius would be half of that, 4e-15 m. But wait, in the particle in a box model, the size L is the length of the box. So for a nucleus, which is 3D, but maybe we can approximate it as a 1D box for simplicity. Or perhaps it's a 3D box, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the minimum kinetic energy occurs when the de Broglie wavelength is comparable to the size of the nucleus. So the momentum p is related to the wavelength λ by p = h/λ. If the proton is confined to a region of diameter d, then λ is roughly d. So p ≈ h/d.

But wait, since the diameter is the size, perhaps the uncertainty in position is about d/2, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to model it as the de Broglie wavelength being on the order of the nuclear diameter. So, let's proceed.

So, let's calculate the momentum using p ≈ h / d.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes I see h-bar (ħ) used, which is h/(2π). So ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So if p ≈ ħ / (d), since the uncertainty in position Δx is about d, then Δp is roughly ħ / Δx. Wait, from the uncertainty principle, Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

Wait no, the uncertainty principle says Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So if Δx is of the order of the size of the nucleus, say d, then Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). But wait, maybe for an order of magnitude estimate, we can ignore the factor of 2 and take Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx). So, Δp ≈ ħ/d.

So p ≈ ħ / d.

Then, the kinetic energy K is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the proton.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, d is 8e-15 m.

ħ is approx 1.05e-34 J·s.

m (proton mass) is about 1.67e-27 kg.

So p = 1.05e-34 / 8e-15 = (1.05 /8 )e-19 = approx 0.13125e-19 kg·m/s.

Then p squared is (0.13125e-19)^2 = approx 1.72e-38 kg²·m²/s².

Divide by 2m: 2 * 1.67e-27 kg = 3.34e-27 kg.

So K ≈ 1.72e-38 / 3.34e-27 = approximately 5.15e-12 J.

Wait, but the options are in MeV. Oh right, I need to convert Joules to MeV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, which is 1.602e-13 J.

So K is 5.15e-12 J. To convert to MeV:

5.15e-12 J / 1.602e-13 J/MeV = approx (5.15 / 1.602) * 10^( -12 +13 ) = approx 3.21 *10^1 MeV? Wait, that would be 32.1 MeV. But that's way higher than any of the options given. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right. The options are all much smaller. Did I mess up the calculation?

Wait a minute, perhaps I used the wrong value for d. Oh wait, the diameter is 8e-15 m. So the radius is 4e-15 m. But in the particle in a box model, the length L is the size of the box. For a 3D box, the energy levels are higher, but perhaps in 1D it's simpler.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the de Broglie wavelength as being equal to the diameter, not twice the radius. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

p = ħ / d.

Wait, no, in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle approach, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is ħ/(2Δx), where Δx is the position uncertainty. So if Δx is about the size of the nucleus, d, then Δp ≈ ħ/(2d).

So p ≈ ħ/(2d).

Then, the kinetic energy K = p²/(2m).

So let's recalculate:

p = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 8e-15 m) ) = 1.05e-34 / 1.6e-14 = approx 6.5625e-21 kg·m/s.

p squared: (6.5625e-21)^2 ≈ 4.3e-41 kg²·m²/s².

Divide by 2m: 2 * 1.67e-27 kg = 3.34e-27 kg.

So K = 4.3e-41 / 3.34e-27 = approx 1.287e-14 J.

Now convert to MeV.

1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J. So 1.287e-14 / 1.602e-13 = approx 0.0803 MeV, which is about 0.08 MeV.

Wait, that's 0.08 MeV. Looking at the options, option G is 0.08, which is 0.08 MeV. So the answer would be G.

But let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, when I computed p as ħ/(2d), that's correct for the uncertainty principle approach, I think. Because Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), so using that gives a lower momentum than the previous approach.

So the correct calculation gives about 0.08 MeV, which is option G.

To determine the minimum kinetic energy of a proton in a medium-sized nucleus with a diameter of \(8.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \(\Delta x\) is the uncertainty in position, \(\Delta p\) is the uncertainty in momentum, and \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). For a proton confined in a nucleus, \(\Delta x\) is approximately the size of the nucleus, so \(\Delta x \sim d = 8.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}\). This gives:

\[
\Delta p \sim \frac{\hbar}{2 \cdot \Delta x}.
\]

Substituting \(\hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\Delta x = 8.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}\):

\[
\Delta p \sim \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \cdot 8.0 \times 10^{-15}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{1.6 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The minimum kinetic energy \(K\) is related to the momentum \(p\) by:

\[
K = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]

where \(m\) is the mass of the proton, \(m \approx 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\). Substituting \(p \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg·m/s}\):

\[
K = \frac{(6.59 \times 10^{-21})^2}{2 \cdot 1.67 \times 10^{-27}} = \frac{4.34 \times 10^{-41}}{3.34 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 1.30 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}.
\]

To convert this energy to MeV, recall that \(1 \, \text{MeV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}\):

\[
K \approx \frac{1.30 \times 10^{-14}}{1.602 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 0.08 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the minimum kinetic energy of the proton is approximately \(0.08 \, \text{MeV}\), which corresponds to option **G**.
