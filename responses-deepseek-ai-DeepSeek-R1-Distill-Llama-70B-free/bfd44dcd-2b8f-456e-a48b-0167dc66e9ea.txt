Okay, so I've got this question about integral domains and their characteristics. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says that every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite. Statement 2 claims that every integral domain with a prime characteristic is finite. I need to determine if each is true or false.

Starting with Statement 1: Integral domains with characteristic 0. I remember that the characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive number of times you have to add the multiplicative identity to get zero. If there's no such number, the characteristic is 0.

Integral domains are commutative rings with unity where there are no zero divisors. So for characteristic 0, the ring must contain a copy of the integers, right? Because if you add 1 to itself n times and never get zero, the ring has an infinite number of elements. Wait, because if the ring didn't have infinitely many elements, the integers mod something would repeat, leading to a non-zero characteristic. So yes, I think Statement 1 is true.

Now Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite. Hmm. Wait, the characteristic being prime means that the ring's underlying additive structure is a vector space over the field of that prime order. But wait, is every integral domain with prime characteristic necessarily finite?

Wait a second, I remember something about finite fields. Finite fields have prime power order, and their integral domains are finite. But what about an integral domain with characteristic p, where p is prime, but the ring itself is infinite? For example, the ring of polynomials over a finite field, like Z/pZ[x], is that an integral domain? Yes, because polynomials over a field are an integral domain. But wait, Z/pZ[x] is an infinite ring. So if an integral domain has characteristic p (a prime), can it be infinite?

Yes, exactly. So Statement 2 is false. Because there are integral domains with prime characteristic that are infinite. So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.

Looking at the options, I need to find where Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Let me check the options.

Option I: True, False. That's what I think. Let me review the options again to make sure.

Option I says Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Yes. So the answer should be I.

Statement 1: Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.  
An integral domain with characteristic 0 contains a subring isomorphic to the integers, which implies the ring must be infinite. Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.  
While finite fields (e.g., $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$) are finite integral domains of prime characteristic, there exist infinite integral domains with prime characteristic, such as $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the ring of polynomials over a finite field. Thus, Statement 2 is **False**.

The correct option is **I: True, False**.

**Answer: I**
