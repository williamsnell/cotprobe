Okay, so I've got this question about research ethics in an introductory psychology class. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is asking whether it's ethical for students to be required to participate in one of the university's ongoing research projects.

First, I remember that in research ethics, informed consent is a big deal. Participants should know what they're getting into, right? So, if the students are required to participate, I need to think about whether that's forcing them, which might be a problem. But wait, maybe they have the option to opt out or choose an alternative activity.

Looking at the options, option A says it's ethical as long as students aren't forced. But if participation is required, that might mean they are forced. So maybe A isn't correct because being required could be a form of force. 

Option B says it's unethical if the results aren't shared. I'm not sure that's the main issue here. Not sharing results might be a different concern, but the question is about the ethics of requiring participation, not about sharing results.

Option C mentions sensitive topics. The question doesn't specify the topic, so I don't think C is the right choice here. It's more about the requirement itself.

Option D says it's ethical if they can choose the project. That makes sense because choice allows autonomy. But the question says they have to participate in one of the projects, but maybe they get to pick which one. If so, that could make it more ethical. But I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option E says it's ethical only if they get class credit. I'm not sure about this. Sometimes, class credit might be an incentive, but the core issue is about consent and coercion. So this might not be the main factor.

Option F says it's ethical only if related to class subject. Maybe that's a good practice, but I don't think it's the ethical make-or-break point here. The question is more about the requirement.

Option G says it's ethical as long as they can choose an alternative activity. Oh, that sounds familiar. I think that's a key point. If students can opt out by doing something else instead of participating in research, that makes the participation voluntary. So this would make the practice ethical because they're not being forced without an alternative.

Option H mentions informed consent. Informed consent is crucial, but if participation is mandatory, even with consent, it might still be problematic because true consent requires the ability to refuse without negative consequences. So H might not be sufficient on its own.

Option I talks about compensation. I don't think compensation is a requirement for ethical research participation, especially in academic settings where participation is often part of the course.

Option J says it's clearly unethical. But if there are proper safeguards, like alternatives, it might not be clearly unethical. So J might not be correct.

Putting it all together, the key issue is whether the students are being forced without an alternative. If they can choose an alternative activity, then their participation is voluntary, making it ethical. So option G seems correct because it addresses the voluntariness by offering an alternative.

The question revolves around the ethics of requiring students to participate in research projects. The key ethical concern is whether participation is voluntary or forced. Option G correctly identifies that the practice is ethical as long as students can choose an alternative activity, ensuring their participation is voluntary and not coercive. 

Answer: G
