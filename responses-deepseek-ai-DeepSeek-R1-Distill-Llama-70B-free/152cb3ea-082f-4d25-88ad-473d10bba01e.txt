Okay, so I've got this question here about drafts and discounting, and I'm a bit rusty on my finance terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Mr. Owens accepted a draft dated July 11 for $544.20 at 4% with a term of 3 months. Then he discounted it on August 2 at 5%. The bank charged a (1/8)% collection fee. I need to find the proceeds. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to calculate it correctly.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that a draft is like a bill of exchange, right? When a business accepts a draft, they're essentially agreeing to pay a certain amount on a future date. In this case, the draft is for $544.20, and the term is 3 months. The date is July 11, so the due date should be October 11, because three months later.

Now, Mr. Owens is discounting this draft on August 2. Discounting means he's getting the present value of the draft from the bank before it's due. The discount rate here is 5%, but wait, the draft itself was accepted at 4%. I think the 4% is the interest rate for the term, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe that's the interest rate for the draft, but the discounting is done at a different rate.

Wait, maybe I should think about the calculations involved. When you discount a bill, you calculate the present value using the discount rate. So the formula for the present value is the face value divided by (1 + discount rate * time). But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula here.

Alternatively, the proceeds from discounting would be the face value minus the discount. The discount is calculated as face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time remaining until maturity.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Calculate the time between the discount date (August 2) and the due date (October 11). That's the time factor for the discount calculation.

2. Determine the discount amount using the discount rate (5%) and the time factor.

3. Subtract the discount and any fees to get the proceeds.

Wait, but the discounting is done at 5%, and the bank also charges a collection fee of 1/8 percent. I need to account for that fee as well.

Let me break it down.

First, find the time from August 2 to October 11. Let me count the days. August has 31 days, so from August 2 to August 31 is 30 days (since the 2nd is day 1, so 31-2 = 29 days? Wait, no. Let me think again. If today is August 2, then the days remaining in August are 31 - 2 = 29 days, but since August 2 is the starting point, perhaps it's 30 days from August 2 to September 1 (including August 2?), wait no, that's not right.

Wait, no. Let me calculate the number of days correctly.

From August 2 to August 31: August has 31 days, so 31 - 2 = 29 days remaining in August.

Then September has 30 days.

From October 1 to October 11 is 11 days.

Wait, wait. The discount date is August 2, and the due date is October 11. So the period between August 2 and October 11 is:

August: 31 days total. From August 2 to August 31 is 30 days (because 31 minus 2 is 29, but since you include both the start and end dates, it's 30 days? Wait no, if I start on the 2nd, the number of days from the 2nd to the 31st is 30 days (including the 2nd and 31st). Or is it 29? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how many days are left after August 2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the days using a date calculator approach.

August 2 to August 31: 30 days (because from August 2 to August 31 is 30 days, including both start and end? No, wait, no. Wait, August 2 to August 3 is 2 days. So August 2 to August 31 is 30 days: 31 - 2 = 29 days, but including the start day, it's 30 days? No, wait, let's think in terms of if you have from day 1 to day 31, that's 31 days. So from August 2 to August 31 is 31 - 2 + 1 = 30 days. Because you include both the start and end dates.

So August has 30 days from August 2 to August 31.

September has 30 days.

Then October 1 to October 11 is 11 days.

So total days are 30 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 11 (Oct) = 71 days.

Wait, but wait. The term was 3 months, so the due date is October 11, correct. So the time from August 2 to October 11 is 71 days.

But wait, in some financial calculations, especially for things like bills, we often use a 360-day year for calculations, which is based on 30 days per month. So I think that's probably the case here.

So using the 30/360 method, each month is 30 days. So the time from August 2 to October 11 would be calculated as:

From August 2 to August 30: 30 - 2 = 28 days.

Wait, wait, no, if using 30/360, each month is treated as 30 days, so:

August: 30 days.

From August 2 to August 30: 30 - 2 + 1 = 29 days? Or is it 30 - 2 = 28 days? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, since the discount is for a term that's a fraction of a year, I can calculate it as (days)/(360). But perhaps an easier approach is to calculate the exact days and then convert to a fraction of a year.

Wait, another approach: the number of days between August 2 and October 11. Let's count each month:

From August 2 to August 31: 31 - 2 + 1 = 30 days.

September has 30 days.

From October 1 to October 11: 11 days.

So total days = 30 + 30 + 11 = 71 days.

So 71 days is the time period.

Now, the discount rate is 5% per annum, so the discount would be calculated as:

Discount = Face Value × Discount Rate × (Time in years)

Time in years is 71/360, since it's using a 360-day year.

So:

Discount = 544.20 × 5% × (71/360)

Let me compute that.

First, 5% is 0.05.

71/360 is approximately 0.197222...

So, 544.20 × 0.05 × 0.197222.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 544.20 × 0.05 = 27.21.

Then, 27.21 × 0.197222 ≈ 5.373.

So the discount is approximately $5.373.

Therefore, the proceeds from discounting would be Face Value minus discount: 544.20 - 5.373 = 538.827. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the options are all around 540-550, so maybe I'm missing something. Also, I haven't considered the collection fee yet.

Wait, the bank charged a (1/8)% collection fee. So that's 0.125% of something. I think the collection fee is based on the face value. So, the collection fee would be 544.20 × 0.125% = 544.20 × 0.00125.

Let me calculate that: 544.20 × 0.00125 = 0.68025.

So the total deduction is discount plus collection fee: 5.373 + 0.68025 ≈ 6.05325.

Therefore, proceeds would be 544.20 - 6.05325 ≈ 538.14675, which is approximately $538.15. But looking at the options, the closest is option G: $540.00, but that's higher than my calculation. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount rate is applied differently. Wait, the draft was accepted at 4%, but the discounting was done at 5%. So maybe the 4% is the interest rate for the draft, and the 5% is the discount rate.

Wait, another thought: when a bill is discounted, the interest is calculated on the face value. But perhaps the 4% is the interest rate that the drawer would pay, while the discounting uses the bank's rate of 5%.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the present value using the 5% discount rate. So the present value would be Face Value divided by (1 + (discount rate × time)).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach or whether it's a simple discount calculation. Let's think again.

Simple discount formula is:

Discount = F × r × t

Proceeds = F - Discount

So that's what I did earlier, which gave me around $538.15, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the time.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the time as 3 months minus the days from July 11 to August 2. Because the draft is dated July 11, and the discount date is August 2, so the time remaining is from August 2 to October 11.

Wait, the term is 3 months from July 11, so that's until October 11. So from August 2, the remaining time is 70 days. Wait, earlier I calculated 71 days, but perhaps it's 70 days?

Wait, wait, let me recount. From August 2 to August 31: 30 days (including both days, because August 2 is day 1, August 3 is day 2, etc., so August 31 is day 30).

Then September is 30 days, so from August 2 to September 30 is 30 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) = 60 days.

Then from October 1 to October 11 is 11 days.

So 60 + 11 = 71 days.

Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial counting.

Wait, perhaps the time from August 2 to October 11 is 70 days. Let me check using a calendar:

August has 31 days. So August 2 to August 31: 31 - 2 = 29 days. But since we include both start and end dates, it's 30 days (from August 2 to August 31 inclusive is 30 days).

Then September is 30 days.

Then October 1 to October 11: 11 days.

So 30 + 30 + 11 = 71 days.

So that's correct. 71 days.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the 4% as part of the calculation somehow. Wait, the draft was accepted at 4%—perhaps that's the interest rate that would apply if the bill were held until maturity, but when discounting, the bank uses its own rate, which is 5%. So the 4% might not directly affect the calculation unless it's about the interest that would have been earned.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.

Wait, maybe the calculation is based on the 4% as the discount rate, but the problem says he discounted it at 5% with a collection fee. So perhaps the 4% is irrelevant here, and the 5% is the discount rate.

Wait, the question says Mr. Owens accepted a draft dated July 11 for $544.20 at 4% with a term of 3 months. So perhaps that 4% is the interest rate on the draft, but when discounting, the bank uses its own rate of 5%, plus a collection fee.

Wait, but when you discount a bill, you're essentially getting the present value, which is calculated using the bank's discount rate (5%), not the rate on the bill itself. So perhaps the 4% is just part of the bill's terms, but for discounting, we use 5%.

So proceeding with that, the discount is calculated as F * r * t, where F is 544.20, r is 5%, and t is 71/360.

So that gives me the discount of approximately $5.373 as before.

Then, subtracting the collection fee of 1/8%, which is 0.125% of 544.20, which is approximately $0.68025.

So total deductions: 5.373 + 0.68025 ≈ 6.05325.

Therefore, proceeds = 544.20 - 6.05325 ≈ 538.14675, which is about $538.15, but that's not one of the options. The closest option is G: $540.00, but it's higher than my result.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the time is calculated in months and fractions of a month, using 30 days per month.

From August 2 to October 11:

August: 31 days. So from August 2 to August 31 is 30 days (since 31 - 2 +1 = 30). So that's 1 month.

September: 30 days, so that's another month.

From October 1 to October 11: 11 days, which is 11/30 of a month.

So total time is 2 months and 11/30 of a month, which is 2.3667 months. To convert this into years for the discount calculation, we divide by 12: 2.3667 / 12 ≈ 0.1972 years.

Wait, that's the same as 71 days (since 71/360 ≈ 0.1972). So same result.

Hmm, so the discount is 544.20 * 0.05 * (71/360) ≈ 5.373.

Proceeds: 544.20 - 5.373 = 538.827.

Then subtract the collection fee: 0.68025.

538.827 - 0.68025 ≈ 538.14675.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied after the discount, or maybe it's a flat fee. Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is applied to the proceeds, not the face value.

Wait, the question says the bank charged a (1/8)% collection fee. It doesn't specify on what. Typically, collection fees are based on the face value, but perhaps it's based on the proceeds after discount. Hmm, that could change things.

Let me recalculate:

If the collection fee is based on the proceeds, then:

Proceeds after discount: 544.20 - 5.373 = 538.827.

Then collection fee is 538.827 * 0.00125 ≈ 0.6733.

So total proceeds would be 538.827 - 0.6733 ≈ 538.1537.

Still around $538.15, which isn't matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the time is calculated differently. Maybe the term is 3 months, and the discounting happened on August 2, which is 22 days after July 11 (July has 31 days, so from July 11 to July 31 is 21 days, so August 2 is 22 days later). So the remaining term is 3 months minus 22 days.

Wait, 3 months is 90 days (using 30 days per month). So 90 - 22 = 68 days remaining. So time = 68/360 ≈ 0.1889 years.

Let me try that. So discount = 544.20 * 0.05 * (68/360).

Compute 544.20 * 0.05 = 27.21.

27.21 * (68/360) = 27.21 * 0.1889 ≈ 5.144.

So discount is $5.144.

Proceeds after discount: 544.20 - 5.144 = 539.056.

Then, collection fee of (1/8)% on face value: 544.20 * 0.00125 = 0.68025.

So proceeds after fee: 539.056 - 0.68025 ≈ 538.37575, which is around $538.38.

Still not matching any options. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time from July 11 to August 2.

July 11 to July 31: 31 - 11 = 20 days. So including July 11, it's 21 days.

Then August 2 is the next day, so the time from July 11 to August 2 is 22 days.

So the remaining term is 90 days (3 months) - 22 days = 68 days.

So using 68/360 as the time factor.

Wait, perhaps I should use that.

So discount = 544.20 * 0.05 * (68/360) ≈ 5.144.

Proceeds: 544.20 - 5.144 = 539.056.

Then subtract the collection fee of 0.68025.

539.056 - 0.68025 = 538.37575, which is approximately $538.38.

But the options don't have this. So I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the discount rate is 5%, but the calculation is done differently. Let me check another approach.

Another way to calculate the discount is:

Discount = (Face Value × Rate × Time) / (1 + (Rate × Time))

But that's for compound interest, but in simple discount, it's just Face Value × Rate × Time.

Wait, perhaps the question is using 360 days for the year, which I've been using, so my calculation is correct. But the options don't include $538, so I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is not subtracted but is part of the discount. Or perhaps the 4% is used in some way.

Wait, perhaps the 4% is the interest rate on the draft, and the discounting is done at 5%, so the effective rate is higher. But I'm not sure how that would factor in.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4% is the discount rate, and the 5% is something else. Wait, the problem says he discounted it at 5%. So the 5% is the discount rate.

Wait, let me
