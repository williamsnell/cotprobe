Okay, so I've got this question about the speed of an electromagnetic wave in empty space. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that electromagnetic waves include things like light, radio waves, microwaves, and others. Oh wait, right, the speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant.

Wait, what's the exact value again? I think it's something like 3 times 10 to the 8 meters per second. Or was it 3.00 multiplied by 10^8? Oh yeah, I remember the teacher emphasizing that in a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. But when rounded, it's 3.00 × 10^8 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is exactly that: 3.00 × 10^8 m/sec. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think any of the other options are close to that number. Let me just double-check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option B is half of that, so that's probably the speed in some other medium like glass or water. Option C is 5e8, which is faster than light, but that's impossible in a vacuum. The others are either too slow or too fast.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is A.

The speed of an electromagnetic wave in empty space is a well-known constant, approximately \(3.00 \times 10^8\) m/s. This is the speed of light in a vacuum, which applies to all electromagnetic waves. Among the given options, only option A matches this value.

Answer: A
