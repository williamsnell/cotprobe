Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Alexander's telephone bill. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question says that Alexander's monthly telephone bill averaged $17.05 last year. And this amount was 10% more than the previous year's monthly charge. I need to find out what the monthly charge was the previous year.

Hmm, so let's break it down. Last year's average is higher than the previous year by 10%. That means the previous year's amount plus 10% of that amount equals $17.05. 

Wait, so if I let the previous year's charge be X, then X plus 10% of X equals $17.05. Alternatively, I can think of it as X multiplied by 1.10 equals $17.05. Because 10% more is the same as multiplying by 1.1. 

So the equation would be: X * 1.10 = 17.05. To find X, I need to divide both sides by 1.10. 

Let me do that calculation. So X = 17.05 / 1.10. Hmm, let me compute that. 

Wait, 17.05 divided by 1.10. I can think of this as 17.05 รท 1.1. Let me do the division step by step. 

Since 1.1 is the same as 11/10, dividing by 1.1 is the same as multiplying by 10/11. So 17.05 * (10/11) would give me X. 

Calculating that: 17.05 * 10 is 170.5. Then divide by 11. 170.5 รท 11 equals... let's see. 11 times 15 is 165, subtract that from 170.5, you get 5.5 left. 5.5 divided by 11 is 0.5. So total is 15.5. 

So X is $15.50. Let me check the options to see which one matches. Looking at the options: 

Option I is $15.50. That must be the correct answer. 

Wait, but to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify. If the previous year was $15.50, adding 10% would be $15.50 * 1.10. Let's compute that. 15.50 * 1.10 is 17.05, which matches the given amount. So yes, that's correct.
</think>

To determine the previous year's monthly charge, let the charge be \( X \). Since last year's charge was 10% more than the previous year, we have:

\[
X \times 1.10 = 17.05
\]

Solving for \( X \):

\[
X = \frac{17.05}{1.10} = 15.50
\]

Thus, the previous year's monthly charge was **$15.50**, which corresponds to option **I**.
