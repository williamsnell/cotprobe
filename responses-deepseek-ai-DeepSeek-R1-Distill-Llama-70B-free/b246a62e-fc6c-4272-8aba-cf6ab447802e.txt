Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing and statistical sampling. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that an auditor is using statistical sampling to test whether cash disbursements were properly authorized. The sample results show that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. I need to figure out what the auditor would most likely reduce under these circumstances.

Let me break down the key terms here. Statistical sampling is a method auditors use to select a sample from a population to make conclusions about that population. The sample rate of deviation is the percentage of deviations found in the sample. The allowance for sampling risk is a margin that accounts for the fact that the sample might not perfectly represent the population. If their sum is higher than the tolerable rate, that means the risk that the auditor is taking on by using the sample is too high.

So the auditor's sample isn't providing sufficient confidence. What does that mean for their testing strategy? Let me think about the audit risk model. Audit risk is composed of inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor's procedures won't detect a material misstatement if it exists. Statistical sampling is a substantive test, which is part of detection risk.

In statistical sampling, if the sample results plus the sampling risk are higher than tolerable, the auditor has a problem with detection risk. Because the sample isn't giving them enough confidence. So the auditor needs to adjust something to bring the total risk down.

Wait, what are the options again? Let me look. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different action.

The question is about what the auditor would reduce. So, what's the auditor's next step when sample results are worse than expected?

If the sample indicates a higher deviation rate than acceptable, the auditor might need to increase the sample size to get a more precise result, which would reduce sampling risk. But wait, the question says the sample rate plus the allowance (sampling risk) is over the tolerable rate. So, perhaps the auditor needs to do more testing to reduce detection risk.

Alternatively, maybe the auditor would lower the assessed level of control risk. Because if they think controls are weaker, they might rely less on them and do more substantive testing. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in the audit risk model, the auditor can adjust various components. If statistical sampling shows high risk, the auditor might have to rely more on other methods. Or perhaps they adjust their reliance on controls.

Wait, the question is about reducing something. Let me think about the options:

Option B: Planned reliance on prescribed control. So if the sample shows a high deviation, maybe the auditor can't rely as much on the controls. Because if controls aren't working, then they have to do more substantive testing. So perhaps they reduce their reliance on the controls, which would require more testing elsewhere.

Option D: Assessed level of control risk. But that's the oppositeâ€”if the sample shows high deviations, control risk might be higher, not lower. So the auditor might assess control risk as higher, not reduce it.

Option J: Planned reliance on substantive tests. Wait, if the sample indicates a problem, maybe they would increase their reliance on substantive tests. But the question is about reducing something.

Wait, maybe the tolerance for deviations is set too high. If the sample's deviation rate plus the allowance exceeds the tolerable rate, perhaps the auditor needs to lower the tolerable rate. Option C is about reducing the tolerable rate. But that doesn't seem right because the tolerable rate is a threshold set by the auditor based on acceptable risk. If the sample exceeds it, they probably can't just lower the threshold; they have to take action.

Alternatively, maybe they have to increase the sample size to reduce sampling risk, which would bring the total below the tolerable rate. But that's not one of the options here.

Wait, another approach: when using statistical sampling, the auditor calculates the sample size based on factors like the tolerable rate, expected deviation rate, and desired confidence level. If after sampling, the results are worse than expected, the auditor might have to adjust their assessment. Perhaps they need to increase the sample size, but that's not an option here.

Looking at the options, option B is about reducing planned reliance on prescribed control. If the sample shows that the controls aren't effective (high deviation rate), the auditor can't rely on them as much. So they would reduce their planned reliance on those controls. That makes sense because if the controls aren't catching the deviations, the auditor needs to rely less on them and do more substantive testing.

Alternatively, option J says reduce planned reliance on substantive tests, which seems opposite because if controls aren't reliable, you'd do more substantive testing, not less.

Wait, the question says the sample results indicate that the sample rate plus allowance exceeds the tolerable rate. So the auditor's statistical sampling suggests a higher risk than acceptable. What can the auditor do? They might have to accept a higher risk, but that's not ideal. Alternatively, they could adjust their approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the auditor needs to decrease detection risk. Since detection risk is part of the audit risk model, and it's affected by the effectiveness of substantive tests. If the sample results are bad, detection risk is too high, so the auditor needs to lower it. How? By doing more testing, perhaps increasing sample size, but again, that's not an option here.

Wait, looking back at the options, option J says reduce planned reliance on substantive tests. That doesn't make sense if you need to increase testing. So maybe that's not the answer.

Option B: Reduce planned reliance on prescribed control. So if the sample shows that the controls aren't effective, the auditor's planned reliance on those controls would decrease. That would mean they have to do more substantive testing, which would increase the extent of testing, thus reducing detection risk.

So the correct answer is B. But I'm a bit confused because I thought when controls are weak, you do more substantive tests, which would mean not reducing reliance on them but increasing. Alternatively, maybe the reliance is on the effectiveness of the controls, so if the sample indicates that the controls aren't working, you can't rely on them as much, thus reducing your planned reliance.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is B.

When an auditor uses statistical sampling to test cash disbursements and finds that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, it indicates that the detection risk is higher than acceptable. This situation suggests that the auditor cannot rely as heavily on the prescribed controls, as the sample results imply that the controls may not be operating effectively. 

Reducing the planned reliance on the prescribed control procedures is the most appropriate response, as it reflects the auditor's decreased confidence in the controls' effectiveness. This adjustment would likely lead to an increase in substantive testing to mitigate the elevated detection risk. 

Other options, such as reducing the tolerable rate (C) or the assessed level of control risk (D), are less appropriate because the tolerable rate is a predefined threshold, and the assessed level of control risk would likely increase, not decrease, given the sample results. Similarly, reducing reliance on substantive tests (J) would be counterproductive, as the auditor needs to strengthen, not weaken, detection procedures in this scenario.

Thus, the correct answer is:

B: Planned reliance on the prescribed control.
