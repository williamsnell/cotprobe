Okay, so I've got this question about DC machines, specifically lap winding. Hmm, I remember that lap windings are a type of armature winding in DC machines. The question is asking about the average pitch when there are 100 conductors and 10 parallel paths.

Wait, what's a conductor in this context? Oh right, in armature windings, the conductors are the wires that carry the current. So there are 100 of them. And parallel paths... I think in a lap winding, the number of parallel paths equals the number of poles. Or is that for wave windings? No, wait, no. Wait, in wave windings, the number of parallel paths is 2, regardless of the number of poles. Lap windings, on the other hand, have a number of parallel paths equal to the number of poles. So if there are 10 parallel paths, that would mean 10 poles.

Average pitch... I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Pitch usually refers to the distance between similar points in the winding. For a lap winding, I think the average pitch is the number of conductors divided by the number of poles. Or wait, maybe it's the number of conductors divided by the number of parallel paths. Oh wait, parallel paths are equal to the number of poles in lap windings, so those two are the same thing here.

So the formula I remember is average pitch = number of conductors / number of parallel paths. So 100 divided by 10 is 10. But wait, let me think again. If each parallel path has a certain number of conductors in series, then the average pitch would be the total divided by the number of paths. Yeah, that makes sense. So 100/10 equals 10. So the average pitch is 10.

Looking at the options, option E is 10. So the answer should be E.

The question involves determining the average pitch of a lap winding in a DC machine with 100 conductors and 10 parallel paths. In lap windings, the number of parallel paths equals the number of poles. The average pitch is calculated as the total number of conductors divided by the number of parallel paths. 

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Average Pitch} = \frac{\text{Number of Conductors}}{\text{Number of Parallel Paths}} = \frac{100}{10} = 10
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

E: 10

Answer: E
