Okay, so I need to figure out who was the President of the United States when Bill Clinton was born. Let me start by recalling when Bill Clinton was born. I think he was born in the 1940s. Wait, no, maybe the 50s? Let me think. Oh right, Bill Clinton was born on August 19, 1946. So that's during the 1940s.

Now, I need to remember who the President was around that time. After World War II, the President was Harry S. Truman, right? Because Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945, and Truman took over. So Truman was president from 1945 to 1953. So in 1946, that's definitely Truman's term.

Let me look at the options. Option B is Harry S Truman. That must be the correct answer. Wait, are there any other options close to that time? Option F is Franklin Roosevelt, but he died in 1945, so by 1946, he's no longer president. Option I is Dwight Eisenhower, but he became president later, in the 50s. So yeah, it's definitely Truman.
