Question:

A 35-year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her body mass index was 23 kg/m2 before surgery, and, except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. The patient remains unable to eat 6 days after surgery. Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient?

Options:

A: oral protein-rich diet
B: feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube
C: feeding through a jejunostomy tube
D: central hyperalimentation
E: intravenous saline solution
F: peripheral hyperalimentation
G: oral carbohydrate-rich diet
H: feeding through a gastrostomy tube
I: oral fat-free modular diet
J: intravenous dextrose solution

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient's nutritional needs after surgery. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 35-year-old woman who had a cholecystectomy, which is the removal of the gallbladder, and she's experiencing nausea and vomiting because of a protracted ileus. I remember that an ileus is when the bowel stops moving properly, so it's like a temporary obstruction. Protracted means it's lasting longer than usual. She can't eat for six days after surgery. 

Her BMI was 23 before surgery, which is in the normal range, so she's not underweight or overweight. She was otherwise healthy except for the cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder, so that's why she had the surgery. 

The question is about the most appropriate form of nutritional support for her. The options are A through J, each representing different types of nutritional support. 

I need to think about the different ways to provide nutrition in such cases. So, the options include oral diets (like protein-rich, carbohydrate-rich, fat-free), various types of tube feeding (nasogastric, jejunostomy, gastrostomy), and intravenous options (saline, dextrose, hyperalimentation).

First, considering her situation: she can't eat because of nausea and vomiting. So oral intake is probably not feasible right now. So options A, G, I, J (oral options) might not be the best choice. But wait, J is IV dextrose, which is different. 

Looking at the other options, she can't take food by mouth, so they need to find another way. Tube feeding is an option. Tube feeding can be through the nose (nasogastric), through the stomach (gastrostomy), or directly into the small intestine (jejunostomy). 

Now, thinking about her condition. She had abdominal surgery, specifically gallbladder removal, and now has a protracted ileus. Ileus means the intestines aren't moving, so the gut isn't functioning normally. So any feeding method that requires the gut to process food might not be possible immediately.

Wait, but if the ileus is protracted, does that mean the whole GI tract is inactive? Or is it just part of it? I think in a post-surgical ileus, especially after abdominal surgery, the small intestine might recover before the stomach. So sometimes, even if the stomach isn't moving, the small bowel can still absorb nutrients if you bypass the stomach.

So, for someone who's had a recent abdominal surgery and has an ileus, the preferred method might be to feed past the stomach. That would mean a jejunostomy tube, because it delivers nutrients directly into the jejunum, which is part of the small intestine. That way, she can get the necessary nutrients without relying on the stomach, which might not be emptying properly.

Alternatively, a nasogastric tube goes into the stomach, but if the stomach isn't emptying, the feed could stay there and cause more nausea or even lead to aspiration. So maybe that's not the best option right now. 

Another option is central hyperalimentation, which is total parenteral nutrition (TPN) given through a central vein. It's used when the gut isn't working at all and the patient can't take any enteral nutrition. But TPN is more invasive and has more risks, like infections, so it's usually reserved for when enteral feeding isn't possible. Since this patient might still be able to have enteral feeding via the small intestine, using a jejunostomy tube would be better than going straight to IV nutrition.

Peripheral hyperalimentation is another IV option, but it's less concentrated than central and typically can't provide all the necessary nutrients for a prolonged period. Also, peripheral lines have a higher risk of complications compared to central lines, but they're less risky than central lines. 

So, putting this together, the best option would be enteral feeding via a jejunostomy tube because it bypasses the stomach, which is not functioning due to the ileus, and allows the small intestine to absorb the nutrients. This approach supports the gut without requiring the stomach to empty, which it can't do right now.

Looking at the options, option C is feeding through a jejunostomy tube. Option B is nasogastric, which might not be effective if the stomach isn't emptying. Option D is central hyperalimentation, which is IV and more invasive, so not the first choice unless necessary. Option F is peripheral hyperalimentation, which again is IV and less optimal. 

So the correct answer should be C.
</think>

The patient is a 35-year-old woman who underwent cholecystectomy and is experiencing nausea and vomiting due to a protracted ileus, preventing her from eating for 6 days post-surgery. Her BMI is normal, and she was otherwise healthy before the surgery. The goal is to determine the most appropriate form of nutritional support.

Since oral intake is not feasible due to nausea and vomiting, options involving oral diets (A, G, I) are not suitable. Intravenous options like central hyperalimentation (D) and peripheral hyperalimentation (F) are more invasive and typically reserved for when enteral feeding is not possible. Similarly, intravenous saline (E) and dextrose (J) do not provide adequate nutrition for prolonged periods.

Tube feeding options include nasogastric (B), gastrostomy (H), and jejunostomy (C). Nasogastric feeding involves delivering nutrients to the stomach, but the patient’s ileus suggests gastric stasis, making this less effective. Gastrostomy tube feeding is similar to nasogastric in that it relies on stomach function, which is compromised in this case.

Jejunostomy tube feeding (C) is the most appropriate option because it bypasses the stomach and delivers nutrients directly into the jejunum (small intestine). The small intestine often recovers faster than the stomach after abdominal surgery, allowing for effective nutrient absorption even during an ileus. This method is less invasive than central hyperalimentation and avoids the complications associated with parenteral nutrition.

Answer: C
