Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the power absorbed by a circuit element. Hmm, power in electrical circuits... I remember that power is usually calculated as the product of voltage and current, P = v * i. But wait, I need to make sure I'm getting the signs right because if the current is entering the positive terminal, the power could be positive or negative depending on the situation.

The question gives me two parts, (a) and (b), and I need to find the power at t=10 seconds for each case. Let me start by understanding each part.

First, let's look at part (a): v1 is equal to 6 times the derivative of i1 with respect to time, di1/dt. And the current i1 is given as 2e^(-0.1)t Amperes. Wait, wait, no, the expression is i1 = 2e^(-0.1)t A. Hmm, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, perhaps it's 2e^(-0.1t) A? Because when t is a variable, it's usually multiplied, not in the exponent's exponent. So I think it's i1 = 2e^(-0.1t) A.

So, for part (a), v1 = 6*(di1/dt). Let me compute di1/dt first.

i1(t) = 2e^(-0.1t). The derivative of this with respect to t would be di1/dt = 2 * (-0.1) e^(-0.1t) = -0.2 e^(-0.1t).

So v1 = 6 * (-0.2 e^(-0.1t)) = -1.2 e^(-0.1t) volts.

Now, the power P is v1 * i1. So P = (-1.2 e^(-0.1t)) * (2e^(-0.1t)) ) = -2.4 e^(-0.2t).

Wait, because when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So e^(-0.1t) * e^(-0.1t) is e^(-0.2t). So that's correct.

Now, plugging t=10s into this. Let me compute e^(-0.2*10) = e^(-2) ≈ 0.1353 (since e^2 is about 7.389, so 1/7.389≈0.1353).

So P = -2.4 * 0.1353 ≈ -0.3247 Watts. Hmm, looking at the options, that's approximately -0.325 W. Let me check the options. Option G is -0.325 W and 3.02 W for part (a) and (b). But wait, I'm not sure yet, let me compute part (b) as well.

Moving to part (b): v1 is given by (1/6)^t ∫ from 0 to t of i1 dt^1 + 2 V. Wait, that integral notation is a bit confusing. The integral of i1 dt from 0 to t, so that's the integral of 2e^(-0.1τ) dτ from τ=0 to τ=t. Oh wait, and then multiplied by (1/6)^t, and then adding 2V.

First, let me compute the integral ∫ i1 dt from 0 to t. i1 is 2e^(-0.1t), so its integral is ∫2e^(-0.1τ) dτ from 0 to t.

The integral of e^(aτ) dτ is (1/a)e^(aτ), so here a is -0.1. So integral becomes [2*( -10 ) e^(-0.1τ) ] evaluated from 0 to t.

So that's 2*(-10)[e^(-0.1t) - e^0] = -20 [e^(-0.1t) - 1] = -20e^(-0.1t) + 20.

So the integral is 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)).

Now, multiply this by (1/6)^t and add 2 V.

So v1 = (1/6)^t * [20(1 - e^(-0.1t))] + 2.

Now, I need to compute this at t=10s.

Let me break it down:

First compute (1/6)^10. 6^10 is a large number. Let me compute it approximately.

6^1 =6
6^2=36
6^3=216
6^4=1296
6^5=7776
6^6=46656
6^7=279936
6^8=1,679,616
6^9=10,077,696
6^10=60,466,176.

So (1/6)^10 ≈ 1.6548e-8. That's a very small number.

Next, compute 20*(1 - e^(-0.1*10)) = 20*(1 - e^(-1)).

e^(-1) is approximately 0.3679, so 1 - 0.3679 = 0.6321. Multiply by 20: 20 * 0.6321 = 12.642.

Now multiply this by (1/6)^10: 12.642 * 1.6548e-8 ≈ let's compute this.

12.642 * 1.6548e-8: 12.642 * 1.6548 ≈ 20.94, so 20.94e-8 = 2.094e-7 volts.

Then, add 2 V. So v1 ≈ 2.094e-7 + 2 ≈ 2.0000002094 V.

So v1 is approximately 2 V at t=10s.

Now, the power P is v1 * i1(t=10s). i1 is 2e^(-0.1*10) = 2e^(-1) ≈ 2 * 0.3679 = 0.7358 A.

So P = 2 V * 0.7358 A ≈ 1.4716 W. Wait, but looking back at the options, for part (b), the numbers are all around 3.0 W or so. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me recheck part (b). The expression is v1 = (1/6)^t * ∫ i1 dt + 2 V. The integral is ∫i1 dt from 0 to t, which we found to be 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)).

So v1 = (1/6)^t * 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)) + 2.

Wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately, perhaps I messed up a step.

Wait, (1/6)^t is e^(t ln(1/6)) ) = e^(-t ln6). At t=10, that's e^(-10 * ln6). Let me compute ln6: ln6 ≈ 1.7918. So 10*ln6 ≈ 17.918, so e^-17.918 is a very small number, approximately 1.65e-8.

So (1/6)^10 is indeed about 1.65e-8.

Now, 20*(1 - e^(-1)) is 20*(1 - 0.3678794412) = 20*(0.6321205588) ≈12.64211176.

Multiply this by 1.65e-8: 12.64211176 * 1.65e-8.

Let me compute 12.6421 * 1.65 first. 12 * 1.65 = 19.8, 0.6421 *1.65 ≈1.059. So total around 20.859. Then 20.859e-8 is 2.0859e-7 V.

So v1 is approximately 2.0859e-7 + 2.0 = 2.00000020859 V. So about 2.0 V.

Then, i1 at t=10s is 2e^(-1) ≈0.7358 A.

So P = 2.0 * 0.7358 ≈ 1.4716 W. Wait, but the options for part (b) are around 3.0 W. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the expression. Let me read part (b) again.

v1 is (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral of i1 from 0 to t, plus 2 V.

Wait, perhaps it's [(1/6)^t multiplied by the integral] plus 2 V.

Wait, did I compute the integral correctly? Let me recheck.

i1 is 2e^(-0.1t). The integral ∫i1 dt from 0 to t is ∫2e^(-0.1τ) dτ from 0 to t.

The integral of e^aτ dτ is (1/a)e^aτ. So with a = -0.1, it's (1/-0.1) e^(-0.1τ) → -10 e^(-0.1τ). Multiply by 2: 2 * (-10) e^(-0.1τ) → -20 e^(-0.1τ).

Evaluated from 0 to t: [-20 e^(-0.1 t)] - [-20 e^(0)] → -20 e^(-0.1t) + 20 → 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)).

Yes, that's correct.

So at t=10s, the integral is 20*(1 - e^(-1)) ≈20*(0.63212)≈12.642.

Multiply by (1/6)^10: 12.642 * 1.65e-8 ≈ 2.09e-7 V. So adding 2 V gives 2.0000002 V approximately.

Hmm, then P = 2.0000002 * 0.7358 A ≈ 1.4716 W. But none of the options have 1.47 W for part (b). The options all have around 3 V for part (b). Did I make a mistake in computing v1?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression. Let me look again: v1 = (1/6)^t * ∫i1 dt + 2 V.

Wait, maybe the expression is (1/6) * t * ∫i1 dt + 2 V? But that wouldn't make sense with the way it's written. The way it's written, it's (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral, plus 2 V.

Wait, perhaps the integral is ∫i1 dt^1, which might imply ∫i1 (dt)^1, which is just ∫i1 dt, so that's the same as before. So I think my calculation is correct, but the result doesn't match any of the options for part (b). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (1/6)^10. Let me compute (1/6)^10 more accurately.

Wait, 1/6 is approximately 0.1666667.

(0.1666667)^10: Let's compute step by step.

(0.1666667)^2 ≈ 0.0277778.

(0.0277778)^2 ≈ 0.0007716.

(0.0007716) * (0.0277778) = approx 0.00002143.

Wait, but that's for the 5th power. Wait, maybe I should compute it as (1/6)^10 = 1/(6^10).

6^10 is 60,466,176 as I calculated before. So 1/60,466,176 ≈ 1.6537e-8.

Hmm, which is what I had before.

So 12.642 * 1.6537e-8 = Let me compute this more precisely.

12.642 * 1.6537e-8:

Calculate 12 * 1.6537e-8 = 1.98444e-7.

0.642 * 1.6537e-8: 0.6 * 1.6537e-8 = 9.9222e-9; 0.042 *1.6537e-8≈6.95054e-10.

Adding those together: 9.9222e-9 + 6.95054e-10 ≈ 1.06177e-8.

So total is 1.98444e-7 + 1.06177e-8 ≈ 2.0905e-7 V.

So v1 ≈ 2.0905e-7 + 2.0 = 2.000000209 V.

So the power is approximately 2.000000209 V * 0.7358 A ≈ 1.4716 W.

But looking at the options, for part (b), the closest is option E: 3.0 W, but that would require v1 to be higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the expression for v1. Let me check again.

Wait, the expression is v1 = (1/6)^t ∫ i1 dt from 0 to t + 2 V.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1/6)^t as e^(-t ln6), which for t=10 is e^(-17.917), which is approximately 1.6537e-8. So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to this, the power would be around 1.47 W, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of v1. Let me try an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the integral of i1 is incorrect. Let me recompute the integral.

i1(t) = 2e^(-0.1t).

The integral from 0 to t is ∫2e^(-0.1τ) dτ.

Let me compute it again. The integral of e^(aτ) dτ is (1/a)e^(aτ), so here a=-0.1, so it's (1/-0.1) e^(-0.1τ) = -10 e^(-0.1τ).

Multiply by 2: 2*(-10) e^(-0.1τ) = -20 e^(-0.1τ).

Evaluated from 0 to t: [-20 e^(-0.1t)] - [-20 e^0] = -20 e^(-0.1t) + 20 = 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)).

So that's correct. So the integral is correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for v1. The user wrote v1 = (1/6)^t ∫i1 dt^1 + 2 V. Maybe the ∫i1 dt^1 is the integral of i1 with respect to t, which is correct as I did. Alternatively, perhaps it's (1/6) * t multiplied by the integral, but that seems unlikely given the notation.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is (1/6)^(t) multiplied by the integral plus 2 V, which is what I did.

Wait, maybe I should re-express v1 as:

v1 = (1/6)^t * [20(1 - e^(-0.1t))] + 2.

So at t=10, that's (1/6)^10 * 20*(1 - e^(-1)) + 2.

Which is (1.6537e-8) * 12.642 + 2.

12.642 * 1.6537e-8 = 2.0905e-7, so v1 ≈ 2.000000209 V.

Then, i1 is 2e^(-1) ≈0.7358 A.

So P = v1 * i1 ≈ 2.000000209 * 0.7358 ≈ 1.4716 W.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, looking back, the current is given as i1 = 2e^(-0.1)t A. Did I misinterpret this as 2e^(-0.1t) A? Because if it's 2e^(-0.1) * t A, then i1 would be 2e^(-0.1) * t. But that would change everything.

Wait, this is a crucial point. The original current is i1 = 2e^(-0.1)t A. So perhaps it's 2e^(-0.1) * t, which is 2 * e^(-0.1) * t. Wait, but that would make i1 a function that increases linearly with time, which doesn't make sense because the exponential would be a constant. That would mean as t increases, the current increases, which is not typical for an exponential decay. So I think the intended function is i1 = 2e^(-0.1t) A, i.e., the exponent is -0.1t.

So I think my initial approach was correct. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b).

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the expression is v1 = (1/6) * t * ∫i1 dt + 2 V. But the way it's written is (1/6)^t ∫ ... So that would mean (1/6) raised to the power of t.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, but assuming it's correct, I have to proceed.

Wait, let me compute the power for part (b) again. If v1 is approximately 2 V and i1 is approximately 0.7358 A, then P = 2 * 0.7358 ≈1.4716 W. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that (1/6)^t is 6^(-t). So 6^(-10) is 1/6^10, which is correct as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is ∫i1 dt from 0 to t, but perhaps I should have considered the integral from 0 to infinity or something else, but no, the problem states from 0 to t.

Hmm, maybe
