Question:

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

Options:

A: Severing the ventral root results in loss of motor function, but sensation remains intact.
B: Severing the dorsal root causes hyperactivity in movement, while severing the ventral root leads to increased sensation.
C: Severing the dorsal root will lead to loss of sensation and reflex action, but if the ventral root is severed, the rat would sense the stimulation but would not be able to react.
D: Severing the dorsal root has no impact on sensation or motor function, while severing the ventral root causes tremors.
E: Severing the dorsal root won't have an effect
F: Severing the dorsal root causes a loss of motor function, whereas severing the ventral root has no effect on the rat.
G: Both the dorsal and ventral root severing lead to enhanced reflex actions.
H: Severing either root causes paralysis
I: Severing the dorsal root results in enhanced sensation, but severing the ventral root causes complete paralysis.
J: Severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation

Okay, so I'm faced with this question about the effects of severing the dorsal versus ventral roots of a nerve in a rat's leg. Hmm, I remember that the nervous system has two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which includes nerves. The PNS is divided into the somatic and autonomic systems, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, the question is about the roots of the nerve. I think each spinal nerve has two roots: dorsal and ventral. The dorsal root is sensory, carrying information from sensory receptors towards the CNS. The ventral root is motor, carrying signals from the CNS to muscles and glands.

So if the dorsal root is severed, the sensory input would be lost. The rat wouldn't feel anything in that area because the signals can't reach the spinal cord. But motor function should still be intact since the ventral root is still connected. So the rat could still move the leg, but wouldn't feel sensations there.

On the other hand, if the ventral root is cut, the motor signals can't get out. So the muscles wouldn't receive the signals to move. The rat would lose motor function in that leg; it might not be able to move it. But the sensory part is fine because the dorsal root is still there. So the rat would feel sensations but can't move the leg.

Wait, but what about reflexes? Reflexes involve both sensory (dorsal) and motor (ventral) roots. For example, when you touch something hot, the sensory neuron sends a signal to the spinal cord, which then sends a motor signal to move the hand away. So if the dorsal root is cut, the sensory part is gone. No reflexes that depend on that root would work because the signal can't get in. However, the motor part is still intact, so if a signal could get to the motor neurons, they could act. But without the sensory input, the reflex won't occur.

So, for the question: severing the dorsal root leads to loss of sensation and reflexes, but motor function remains. Severing the ventral root leads to loss of motor function, but sensation and reflexes would require the dorsal root, so if only the ventral is cut, the sensory input is still there, but the reflex can't happen because the motor part is gone.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the ventral root is cut, the motor function is lost. The reflex arc needs both the sensory (dorsal) and motor (ventral) parts. So, if either is cut, the reflex is lost. But if the dorsal is cut, the rat can't feel, so no sensory input. If the ventral is cut, the rat can feel (because the sensory is intact), but can't move.

So, specific to the options:

The question asks, what happens when the dorsal root is severed, and how does the effect vary if the ventral root is severed instead.

Option C says: Severing the dorsal root leads to loss of sensation and reflex action, but severing the ventral root means the rat would sense the stimulation but can't react. That sounds correct.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Severing the ventral root results in loss of motor function, but sensation remains. That's correct for the ventral part. But the question is about both parts.

Option C is more comprehensive, explaining both effects.

Option F says the dorsal root causes loss of motor function, which is incorrect. The ventral root is motor.

Option A: If the ventral is cut, yes, motor is lost, but sensation remains. So A is correct for the ventral part, but the question is about both.

Wait, the question is phrased: How will severing the dorsal affect the rat, and how would the effect vary if the ventral is severed. So the correct answer must address both.

Looking at option C again: Dorsal severed: loss of sensation and reflex. Ventral severed: can sense but can't react. That fits.

Other options: Option A only talks about the ventral. So the correct answer is C.

The dorsal root of a nerve is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS), while the ventral root carries motor signals from the CNS to muscles and glands. Severing the dorsal root disrupts sensory input, leading to a loss of sensation and reflex actions, as the sensory signals cannot reach the CNS. However, motor function remains intact because the ventral root is still functional.

If the ventral root is severed, motor function is lost, meaning the rat cannot move the affected leg. However, sensation remains intact because the dorsal root is still connected, allowing sensory information to reach the CNS. Reflex actions, which require both sensory and motor components, would also be impaired in this case.

Among the options provided, **Option C** accurately describes these effects: severing the dorsal root results in loss of sensation and reflex action, while severing the ventral root means the rat can sense stimulation but cannot react.

Answer: C
