Okay, so I've got this problem here about parametric equations in the xy-plane. The question is asking about the length of a curve defined by x = cos t and y = sin t, where t ranges from 0 to pi. Hmm, I need to find the length of this curve. Let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that the formula for the length of a parametric curve defined by x(t) and y(t) from t=a to t=b is given by the integral from a to b of the square root of (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2) dt. So the formula is L = ∫√[(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2] dt from a to b.

Alright, so first I need to find the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt. Let's compute them.

Given x = cos t, so dx/dt is -sin t. And y = sin t, so dy/dt is cos t. So now, I can plug these into the formula.

So the integrand becomes sqrt[ (-sin t)^2 + (cos t)^2 ].

Simplifying inside the square root: (-sin t)^2 is sin²t, and (cos t)^2 is cos²t. So sin²t + cos²t is 1. So the square root of 1 is just 1.

Wait, so the integrand is 1? That makes the integral straightforward. The integral from 0 to pi of 1 dt is just the difference in t between pi and 0, which is pi. So the length would be pi.

But wait a second, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The parametric equations x=cos t and y=sin t are the equations of a circle with radius 1, right? Because normally x=cos t and y=sin t parameterize the unit circle.

So when t goes from 0 to pi, it's tracing the circle from (1,0) to (-1,0), which is the upper half of the circle (since sin t is positive between 0 and pi). So the length of this curve should be half the circumference of the unit circle.

The circumference of a full circle is 2πr. Since r=1, it's 2π. Half of that is π. So yes, that matches my earlier calculation.

So the length is π. Looking at the options, option J is π.

The problem involves finding the length of a curve defined by the parametric equations \( x = \cos t \) and \( y = \sin t \), where \( t \) ranges from 0 to \( \pi \). To determine the length of this curve, we use the formula for the arc length of a parametric curve:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

First, compute the derivatives of \( x \) and \( y \) with respect to \( t \):
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = \cos t
\]

Substitute these into the arc length formula:
\[
L = \int_{0}^{\pi} \sqrt{(-\sin t)^2 + (\cos t)^2} \, dt
\]

Simplify the integrand:
\[
\sqrt{\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t} = \sqrt{1} = 1
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
L = \int_{0}^{\pi} 1 \, dt = \pi
\]

This result makes sense because the parametric equations \( x = \cos t \) and \( y = \sin t \) describe the unit circle. When \( t \) ranges from 0 to \( \pi \), the curve traces the upper half of the circle, which has a length equal to half the circumference of the circle. The circumference of a full unit circle is \( 2\pi \), so half of it is \( \pi \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: \( \pi \)**

Answer: J
