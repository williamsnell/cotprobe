Okay, so I've got this question about inductor impedance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question is: What's the impedance of a 1-henry inductor at angular frequencies of 100, 1000, and 10,000 rad/sec? The options are from A to J, each with three values.

Wait, I remember that inductors have impedance that depends on the frequency. Oh right, the formula for inductive reactance is X_L equals j times omega times L. Oh wait, but since we're talking about the magnitude of impedance, it's just omega multiplied by L. Because the impedance Z is jωL, so the magnitude is ωL.

So the inductor has L = 1 H. So the impedance at each frequency will just be omega times 1, which is omega itself in ohms.

Let me jot that down. So for each given ω:

- First frequency: 100 rad/s → X_L = 100 * 1 = 100 ohms.
- Second: 1000 rad/s → X_L = 1000 ohms.
- Third: 10,000 rad/s → X_L = 10,000 ohms.

Wait, but looking at the options, which option has 100, 1000, 10,000 in that order?

Looking at the options:

Option B: 100, 1000, 10,000. Yep, that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh right, inductors oppose changes in current, and their reactance increases with frequency. So higher frequency means higher impedance. So the order makes sense: 100 < 1000 < 10,000.

Looking again at the options, Option B is the only one that matches these exact numbers in order. So yeah, I'm confident it's B.

The impedance of an inductor is given by the formula \( Z = j\omega L \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency and \( L \) is the inductance. The magnitude of the impedance is \( Z = \omega L \). For a 1-henry inductor (\( L = 1 \, \text{H} \)), the impedance at different angular frequencies is calculated as follows:

- At \( \omega = 100 \, \text{rad/s} \): \( Z = 100 \times 1 = 100 \, \Omega \).
- At \( \omega = 1000 \, \text{rad/s} \): \( Z = 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \, \Omega \).
- At \( \omega = 10,000 \, \text{rad/s} \): \( Z = 10,000 \times 1 = 10,000 \, \Omega \).

Thus, the impedances are \( 100 \, \Omega \), \( 1000 \, \Omega \), and \( 10,000 \, \Omega \) at the given frequencies, respectively. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is **B**.
