Question:

Which of the following statements about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer?

Options:

A: Nonsampling risk can be completely eliminated with careful planning.
B: Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.
C: Sampling risk is only applicable when the auditor tests each item in the population.
D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.
E: Nonsampling risk is eliminated when a substantive test is restricted to a sample.
F: Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.
G: Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about audit sampling risks, specifically for a nonissuer. I'm a bit rusty on my auditing terms, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking which statement about audit sampling risks is correct. The options are A through G, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should remember what sampling and nonsampling risks are. From what I recall, sampling risk is the risk that the auditor's conclusions based on a sample may be different from the conclusions if the entire population were tested. So it's about the uncertainty because you're not testing every single item. Nonsampling risk, on the other hand, arises from factors other than the sampling process. It could be due to poor audit procedure design, or maybe the auditor misapplied the procedures, or perhaps there was a failure to recognize a misstatement.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says: Nonsampling risk can be completely eliminated with careful planning. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I remember that nonsampling risks can be reduced with good planning, like designing proper audit procedures, but they can't be completely eliminated. There's always some risk, no matter how careful you are. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. Wait, that sounds a bit off. Sampling risk is more about the variability in the sample. When you apply audit procedures to a sample, there's a risk that the sample doesn't represent the whole population accurately. So I think B is describing something else, maybe nonsampling risk? Or perhaps it's just phrased incorrectly. Not sure yet, I'll come back to it.

Option C: Sampling risk is only applicable when the auditor tests each item in the population. No, that can't be right. If you test the whole population, that's 100% testing, so there's no sampling involved, and thus no sampling risk. Sampling risk applies when you're testing a sample, not the whole population. So C is wrong.

Option D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. Hmm, that sounds more like nonsampling risk. Because selecting wrong procedures is a mistake in the audit process, not a result of sampling variability. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Nonsampling risk is eliminated when a substantive test is restricted to a sample. That doesn't make sense. If you're restricting to a sample, you're introducing sampling risk, but nonsampling risks can still exist. For example, if the wrong procedure is used on the sample, that's a nonsampling risk. So E is wrong.

Option F: Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. Wait, isn't that the definition of sampling risk? Because it's about the sample vs. the population. So F is mixing up the terms. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. Yes, that rings a bell. For example, if the auditor doesn't catch a misstatement because they applied the wrong test or didn't perform the test correctly, that's a nonsampling risk. So G seems correct.

Let me double-check each point. Sampling risk is about the sample not being representative. Nonsampling is about other issues, like using wrong procedures or misjudging something.

So looking back:

A: Wrong, can't eliminate nonsampling risk completely.

B: Unclear, but I think it's not correct about sampling risk.

C: Wrong, sampling applies when not testing all.

D: Describes nonsampling, so D is wrong.

E: Wrong, nonsampling isn't eliminated.

F: Confuses sampling and nonsampling.

G: Correct. Nonsampling includes failure to detect misstatements.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is determined by understanding the distinction between sampling risk and nonsampling risk in auditing. Sampling risk arises from the uncertainty that the conclusions drawn from a sample may not represent the entire population. Nonsampling risk, however, is unrelated to sampling and can occur due to factors like poor audit procedure design, incorrect application of procedures, or failure to recognize misstatements.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Nonsampling risk cannot be completely eliminated, only reduced, through careful planning.
- **B**: Incorrect. Sampling risk is not about the uncertainty in applying audit procedures but rather the variability in sample representation.
- **C**: Incorrect. Sampling risk applies when testing a sample, not when testing the entire population.
- **D**: Incorrect. This describes nonsampling risk, as it pertains to selecting inappropriate audit procedures.
- **E**: Incorrect. Nonsampling risk is not eliminated when testing a sample; it can still occur.
- **F**: Incorrect. This describes sampling risk, not nonsampling risk.
- **G**: Correct. Nonsampling risk can arise when an auditor fails to recognize misstatements, such as using inappropriate procedures or misapplying tests.

Thus, the correct answer is **G**.
