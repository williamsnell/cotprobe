Okay, so I have this question about Aristotle's terminology, specifically about incontinence. Hmm, I remember that in philosophy, especially in Aristotle's ethics, there are terms like continence and incontinence. I think they relate to how people act in the face of their desires or emotions.

Wait, let me try to recall. Aristotle talked about virtues and vices, and how people can have different states regarding their control over their actions. I think incontinence is when someone knows what's right but doesn't act on it. Or is it when they act against their better judgment despite knowing better?

Oh right, I remember that incontinence (often called 'akrasia' in Greek) is when a person acts against their own judgment. So, they might know that a certain action is wrong, but they do it anyway because of their feelings or desires. So, it's like knowing something is bad but going ahead and doing it.

Looking at the options: let's go through them one by one.

Option A says one knows feelings are inappropriate but acts anyway. That sounds a bit like incontinence, but I'm not sure if it's exactly what Aristotle meant. Maybe.

Option B is knowing feelings are wrong and not acting. That seems like the opposite, maybe continence or self-control.

Option C is acting on feelings regardless of appropriateness. That's more like a lack of self-control but not necessarily tied to knowing right or wrong.

Option D is not knowing actions are wrong. That's more like ignorance, not incontinence because incontinence involves knowing.

Option E says knowing actions are wrong and doing them anyway. That fits with what I was thinking earlier. So this might be the correct answer.

Option F is not acting despite knowing actions are right. That sounds like a different problem, perhaps something like laziness or inability to act, not incontinence.

Option G is doing the right action for the wrong reason. That's more about motivation, not about acting despite knowing better.

Option H is not knowing actions are right, which again is about knowledge rather than the conflict in incontinence.

Option I is doing the right action without understanding why. That's about comprehension, not about acting against judgment.

So I think the correct answer is E. Because incontinence is when you know something is wrong, but you do it anyway because of your feelings or desires overcoming your judgment.

In Aristotle’s terminology, incontinence (or 'akrasia') refers to acting against one’s better judgment. Specifically, it occurs when a person knows that an action is wrong but still performs it, often due to being overcome by emotions or desires. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Acting on inappropriate feelings despite knowing they are wrong is close but not precise.  
- **B**: Refraining from acting on inappropriate feelings aligns more with self-control or continence.  
- **C**: Acting on feelings without regard for appropriateness describes a lack of self-control but not necessarily incontinence.  
- **D**: Not knowing actions are wrong relates to ignorance, not incontinence.  
- **E**: Knowing actions are wrong but doing them anyway perfectly captures Aristotle’s concept of incontinence.  
- **F**: Not acting despite knowing actions are right describes a different issue, not incontinence.  
- **G**: Doing the right action for the wrong reason concerns motivation, not incontinence.  
- **H**: Not knowing actions are right is about ignorance, not incontinence.  
- **I**: Doing the right action without understanding why pertains to comprehension, not incontinence.  

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as it directly matches Aristotle’s definition of incontinence.
