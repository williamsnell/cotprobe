Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is: If p is a prime number and a is an integer, what is (a^p - a) mod p? And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, alright, I remember something about modular arithmetic and primes. Oh right, there's Fermat's Little Theorem. Let me think about that. So Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. But wait, what if a is divisible by p? Oh right, if a is a multiple of p, then a mod p is 0, so a^p is also 0 mod p, and subtracting a would be 0 - 0, which is 0 mod p.

So the theorem applies when a and p are coprime, meaning a isn't a multiple of p. So in that case, a^(p-1) mod p is 1. Then, if I multiply both sides by a, I get a^p ≡ a mod p. So that means a^p minus a would be congruent to 0 mod p.

Wait, so (a^p - a) mod p is 0 in all cases, whether a is a multiple of p or not. Because if a is a multiple of p, both a^p and a are 0 mod p, so their difference is 0. And if a is not a multiple, then by Fermat's theorem, a^p is congruent to a, so again the difference is 0.

So the answer should be 0, which is option E.

Let me double-check. Take p=3, a=2. 2^3 is 8. 8 - 2 is 6. 6 mod 3 is 0. Another example: p=5, a=7. 7^5 is 16807. Subtract 7 gives 16800. 16800 mod 5 is 0. Or if a=5, then 5^5 is 3125. 3125 -5=3120. 3120 mod 5 is 0. Yep, seems consistent.

The problem asks for the value of \((a^p - a) \mod p\) where \(p\) is a prime number and \(a\) is an integer. This can be solved using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \(p\) is prime and \(a\) is not divisible by \(p\), then \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\). Multiplying both sides by \(a\) gives \(a^p \equiv a \mod p\). Therefore, \(a^p - a \equiv 0 \mod p\).

If \(a\) is divisible by \(p\), then \(a \equiv 0 \mod p\), and so \(a^p \equiv 0 \mod p\). In this case, \(a^p - a \equiv 0 - 0 \equiv 0 \mod p\). Thus, in all cases, \((a^p - a) \mod p = 0\).

Examples confirm this result:
- For \(p = 3\) and \(a = 2\), \(2^3 - 2 = 6\), and \(6 \mod 3 = 0\).
- For \(p = 5\) and \(a = 7\), \(7^5 - 7 = 16800\), and \(16800 \mod 5 = 0\).
- For \(p = 5\) and \(a = 5\), \(5^5 - 5 = 3120\), and \(3120 \mod 5 = 0\).

Thus, the correct answer is **E: 0**.

Answer: E
