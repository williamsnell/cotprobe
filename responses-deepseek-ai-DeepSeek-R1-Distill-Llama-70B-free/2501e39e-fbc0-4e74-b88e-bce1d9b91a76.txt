Question:

Which one of following statements about nitrogen balance is correct?


Options:

A: Positive nitrogen balance means that there is a net loss of protein from the body
B: Positive nitrogen balance means that the body is in a state of nitrogen deficiency.
C: In negative nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds
D: Negative nitrogen balance indicates a net gain of protein in the body.
E: In positive nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.
F: Positive nitrogen balance means that the body excretes more nitrogenous compounds than it consumes.
G: In nitrogen equilibrium the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is greater than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.
H: In positive nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is equal to the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.

Okay, so I have this question about nitrogen balance, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I remember about nitrogen balance.

Nitrogen balance is about the body's intake of nitrogen versus its excretion. Proteins are made of amino acids, which contain nitrogen. When the body breaks down proteins, it releases nitrogen, which is then excreted.

I remember that positive nitrogen balance means the body is taking in more nitrogen than it's excreting. So the body is retaining more nitrogen. Since proteins are built from amino acids, which have nitrogen, a positive balance suggests that the body is building more proteins than it's breaking down. That would happen during growth, like in children, or when someone is building muscle, maybe like bodybuilders or during recovery from an illness.

Negative nitrogen balance would be the opposite. The body is excreting more nitrogen than it's taking in. This means the body is breaking down proteins faster than it's making them. This could happen during fasting, starvation, or when someone is very ill and can't retain enough protein.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: Positive nitrogen balance means net loss of protein. Hmm, wait, no. Positive balance should mean net gain, not loss. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Positive means nitrogen deficiency. That doesn't make sense. If you're in positive, you have more intake, so no deficiency. B is wrong.

Option C: Negative balance where excretion is less than intake. Wait, negative balance is when excretion is higher than intake. Because if you're excreting more than you take in, the body is losing nitrogen. So C is incorrect because it's saying excretion is less, which would be positive.

Option D: Negative balance indicates net gain of protein. No, negative balance is net loss. So D is wrong.

Option E: Positive balance: excretion less than intake. That sounds right. Because if you take in more than you excrete, the balance is positive. So E seems correct.

Option F: Positive balance means excreting more. No, that's the opposite. Positive is when more is retained, so F is wrong.

Option G: Nitrogen equilibrium is when excretion is greater than intake. Wait, equilibrium is when they're equal. So G is incorrect because it says excretion is greater, which would be negative balance.

Option H: Positive balance when excretion equals intake. No, equilibrium is when they're equal. So H is wrong.

So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E. Positive nitrogen balance occurs when the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds, indicating a net gain of protein in the body.

Answer: E
