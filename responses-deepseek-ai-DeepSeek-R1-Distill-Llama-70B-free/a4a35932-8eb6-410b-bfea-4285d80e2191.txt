Okay, so I've got this problem about bond yields, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the effective yield of a bond. The bond has a 6 and a half percent coupon rate, meaning it pays 6.5% of its face value each year. The face value is $1,000. But the bond is purchased at 8 and a quarter percent, which I think refers to the price as a percentage of the face value. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no—when a bond is purchased at a certain price, like 8 and 1/4, that's probably the price expressed as a percentage of face value. So 8.25 would mean the bond is bought for 108.25% of the face value, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

Wait, bonds are often quoted in terms of percentages. So if a bond is bought at 8 and 1/4, that's 8.25, which usually means that the price is 8.25% of the face value. But wait, that can't be right because a bond's face value is typically $1000, so 8.25 would be $82.50, which seems too low for a bond purchase. Hmm, maybe I got this wrong. Alternatively, sometimes prices are quoted as a percentage, but sometimes they include fractions. Wait, maybe 8 and 1/4 is in terms of 32nds, which is a common way to quote bond prices. So 8 and 1/4 means 8.25, but in 32nds, that would be 8 + 8/32 = 8.25. So the price is $825. Wait, but wait, a bond's face value is $1000. If the price is 8 and 1/4, does that mean 8.25% of $1000, which is $82.50? Or does it mean the bond is selling for 108.25? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how bond prices are usually presented. For example, if a bond is quoted at 100, that's 100% of face value, so $1000. If it's quoted at 80, that's $800. But sometimes, especially for government bonds, the prices can be in 32nds. So 8 and 1/4 would be 8.25 in terms of 32nds. Wait, no, 8 and 1/4 would be 8.25, but that doesn't make sense because 8.25 would be less than face value, implying the bond is bought at a discount. Alternatively, perhaps the price is 8.25 in terms of 32nds, which would translate to 8 + 8/32 = 8.25, but that can't be right because 8.25 as a price would mean $825, which is a discount. But I'm getting a bit confused, so perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the question says the bond is purchased at 8(1/4). Maybe that's 8.25, meaning 8.25% of face value, so $82.50? That seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps the notation is 8 and 1/4 dollars, so $8.25 per $100 face, but that doesn't add up either. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the bond is priced at 8.25, which is 8.25% of face value. So if face value is $1000, then the purchase price is 0.0825 * 1000 = $82.50. But that seems really low for a bond, especially if it's a 6.5% coupon. Wait, but that would mean the bond is selling at a deep discount, which would cause the yield to be higher than the coupon rate, which is 6.5%. But the options given go up to 8.25%, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, but another possibility is that the bond is purchased at a price of 8.25, meaning 8.25 times the face value. So $1000 * 8.25 = $8250, which seems high, but that would imply a premium. Then the yield would be lower than the coupon rate. But the coupon is 6.5%, and some of the options are lower than that, like 6.8%, 6.9%, etc. So I'm a bit stuck on this part. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to proceed.

The formula for the effective yield (or yield to maturity) of a bond is calculated using the formula:

YTM = (C + (F - P)/n) / ((F + P)/2)

Where:
C = annual coupon payment
F = face value
P = purchase price (current price)
n = number of years until maturity

Wait, but I think this is an approximation, and the actual formula is more complex, involving the present value of each coupon payment. Alternatively, the exact formula would require solving for the discount rate that makes the present value of coupons and face value equal to the purchase price.

But perhaps the question expects me to use the approximation formula, especially since it's a multiple-choice question.

Alternatively, the effective annual yield can be calculated by finding the discount rate that makes the present value of coupons and face value equal to the purchase price. But without knowing the maturity, it's hard to compute. Wait, the problem doesn't mention the time to maturity. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the bond is a perpetuity, but that's unlikely because perpetuities don't have a face value repayment. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. It says "a 6(1/2)% bond with a face value of $1,000 purchased at 8(1/4)". Wait, perhaps 8(1/4) is the price as a percentage, so 108.25% of face value, meaning the purchase price is $1082.50. Because 8(1/4) could mean 8 and 1/4 percent, so 8.25%, but that would imply a price of $82.50, which seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 and 1/4 as a price in dollars, meaning $8.25 per $100 face, but that's $82.50 again. I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps 8(1/4) is in 32nds, which is how some bonds are quoted. So 8 and 1/4 would be 8.25 in 32nds. Wait, 32nds are used in fractions, so 1/4 in 32nds is 8/32, so 8.25 would be 8 + 8/32 = 8.25 in terms of 32nds. So the price would be 8.25/32. Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the price is 8 and 1/4 dollars, which is $8.25 per $100 face value. So for a $1000 face value, that would be $82.50. But then the coupon is 6.5%, so $65 per year. But that seems like a very low price, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with that assumption. So the purchase price P is $82.50. The face value F is $1000. The coupon payment C is 6.5% of $1000, which is $65 per year. But I don't know the number of years until maturity. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the time to maturity, I can't compute the YTM. Wait, perhaps the bond is sold at a discount, and it's a zero-coupon bond? No, because it has a coupon payment. Alternatively, maybe it's a one-year bond. But I'm not told that.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the bond is sold at a certain price, and I have to compute the yield without considering time. Hmm, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the question is miswritten, but I have to proceed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The bond has a 6.5% coupon rate, face value $1000, and is purchased at 8.25. Perhaps 8.25 is the price as a percentage of face value, so 108.25% of face value. So the purchase price P is $1,082.50. Then, the coupon is $65 per year. If I assume the bond has, say, 10 years to maturity, but without that info, I can't compute it. So I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler than I'm making it. Maybe it's asking for the current yield, which is the coupon payment divided by the purchase price. So current yield would be (65)/(purchase price). But if the purchase price is $1082.50, then 65/1082.50 ≈ 6.0%. But that's not matching any of the options. Alternatively, if the purchase price is $825, then 65/825 ≈ 7.88%, which is close to option C: 7.8%. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because current yield doesn't account for the capital gain or loss.

Wait, the question asks for the effective yield, which I think is the yield to maturity (YTM), not the current yield. So I need to calculate YTM, which requires knowing the time to maturity, which I don't have. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the bond is purchased at a discount and that the time to maturity can be determined from the price. Alternatively, maybe it's a perpetuity, but that doesn't make sense because perpetuities don't have a face value repayment. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the bond is a 10-year bond or some standard term, but the question doesn't specify. Since the question doesn't provide the time to maturity, perhaps I'm supposed to assume it's a particular term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick question where the yield is just the coupon rate, but that's not right because the bond is bought at a discount or premium.

Wait, let's try an example. Let's say the bond has 20 years to maturity. Then, the YTM would be calculated by finding the discount rate that equates the present value of all future cash flows to the purchase price. But without knowing the time, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the question is miswritten, and the purchase price is 82.5, which is 82.5% of face value, so $825. Then, using that, I can compute YTM. But again, without the time, I can't do it. So maybe the question expects me to compute the current yield, but that's not the same as effective yield.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the yield as the coupon rate adjusted for the purchase price, but that's not correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a simple formula. The effective yield can be approximated by the coupon payment divided by the purchase price, but that's current yield, not effective yield. Alternatively, if the bond is sold at a discount, the effective yield would be higher than the coupon rate.

Wait, let's try to think in terms of the approximation formula for YTM. The formula I mentioned earlier is:

YTM ≈ (C + (F - P)/n) / ((F + P)/2)

But without knowing n, the number of years, I can't compute this. So perhaps the question expects me to ignore the time factor, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the bond is a 1-year bond. If that's the case, then the YTM would be (C + (F - P)) / P. So let's try that.

Assuming P is $825 (if 8.25 means 82.5% of face value), and F is $1000, C is $65.

So YTM = (65 + (1000 - 825)) / 825 = (65 + 175)/825 = 240/825 ≈ 0.2909 or 29.09%. But that's way higher than any of the options, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, if P is $1082.50 (108.25% of face value), then YTM would be (65 + (1000 - 1082.50))/1082.50. Wait, but (1000 - 1082.50) is negative 82.50, so that would be (65 -82.50)/1082.50 = (-17.50)/1082.50 ≈ -0.01617 or -1.617%, which is negative, which doesn't make sense because the YTM can't be negative if you're paying a premium and receiving a coupon. Hmm, maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume it's a 1-year bond. Maybe it's a 2-year bond. Then, YTM would be calculated as the rate that discounts the coupons and face value to the purchase price. But without knowing n, I can't do that. So I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coupon rate adjusted for the purchase price, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple percentage calculation.

Wait, maybe the effective yield is just the coupon rate divided by the purchase price as a percentage of face value. So if the bond is bought at 108.25, then the denominator is 1.0825. So 6.5 / 1.0825 ≈ 6.0%. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, if the purchase price is 82.5, then 6.5/0.825 ≈ 7.878%, which is about 7.88%, which would round to 7.9%, but the closest option is C:7.8%. So maybe that's the intended approach, even though it's not the correct way to calculate YTM.

Wait, but effective yield usually refers to the yield to maturity, which would require knowing the time to maturity. Since the question doesn't provide that, perhaps it's expecting the current yield, which is coupon divided by price. So if the price is $825, then current yield is 65/825 ≈ 7.878%, which is approximately 7.9%, but the closest option is C:7.8%. Alternatively, perhaps the price is 108.25, making current yield 65/1082.5 ≈ 6.0%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the purchase price. Let me think again. If the bond is purchased at 8(1/4), that's 8.25. Now, in bond pricing, sometimes 8.25 could refer to 8.25%, which would mean $82.50. Alternatively, it could refer to 8.25 in 32nds, which would be 8.25/32 = 0.2578125, so 25.78125% of face value, which would be $257.81. That doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps the price is 8.25, meaning $8.25 per $100 face value. So for a $1000 face value, that's $82.50. Then, the coupon is 6.5%, so $65 per year.

If I assume that the bond is a 10-year bond, then I can calculate the YTM using the formula for present value of an ordinary annuity.

The formula for YTM (r) is found by solving:

P = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r + F / (1 + r)^n

Where P is purchase price, C is annual coupon, F is face value, and n is years to maturity.

But without knowing n, I can't compute this. So perhaps the question expects me to assume a certain n, but that's not given.

Wait, maybe the question is using a different approach. Let me think of the effective yield as the coupon rate adjusted for the price. So if the bond is bought at a discount, the effective yield increases, and if bought at a premium, it decreases.

So, the formula could be:

Effective Yield = Coupon Rate / (Purchase Price / Face Value)

So, if the purchase price is 82.5% of face value, then:

Effective Yield = 6.5% / 0.825 ≈ 7.878%, which is approximately 7.9%. The closest option is C:7.8%. Alternatively, if the purchase price is 108.25, then:

Effective Yield = 6.5% / 1.0825 ≈ 6.0%, but that's not an option.

So perhaps the intended answer is C:7.8%. But I'm not entirely sure because this approach isn't the correct way to calculate YTM, but given the information, maybe that's what the question expects.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the yield as a simple percentage without considering time value, which would be the current yield. So, 65 / 825 = 0.07878 or 7.878%, which rounds to 7.9%, but the options don't have that, so perhaps they rounded to 7.8%, which is option C.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.8%, which matches this calculation. So I think that's the intended answer.
</think>

To determine the effective yield of a 6.5% bond with a face value of $1,000 purchased at 8.25, we first interpret the purchase price. The notation "8(1/4)" likely refers to 8.25% of the face value, meaning the bond is purchased for $82.50. The annual coupon payment is $65 (6.5% of $1,000).

The effective yield, or yield to maturity (YTM), is typically calculated using the formula:

\[
YTM = \frac{C + \frac{F - P}{n}}{\frac{F + P}{2}}
\]

However, the time to maturity (\(n\)) is not provided in the question, making it impossible to compute the exact YTM. Given this limitation, the problem likely expects an approximation based on the current yield, which is calculated as:

\[
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Purchase Price}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{65}{82.50} \approx 7.878\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent, the effective yield is approximately 7.9%. Among the provided options, the closest match is **7.8%**, which corresponds to option C.

Thus, the effective yield of
