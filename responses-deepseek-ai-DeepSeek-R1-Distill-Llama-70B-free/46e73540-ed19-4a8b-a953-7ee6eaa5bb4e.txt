J: 1

Answer:
    <think>


To solve the equation \(\left(\frac{1}{25}\right)^{x + 2} = 125^{-x}\), I'll start by expressing both sides with the same base. 

First, I recognize that \(25 = 5^2\) and \(125 = 5^3\). This allows me to rewrite the equation as:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5^2}\right)^{x + 2} = \left(5^3\right)^{-x}.
\]

Simplifying the left side, \(\frac{1}{5^2} = 5^{-2}\), so the equation becomes:

\[
\left(5^{-2}\right)^{x + 2} = 5^{-3x}.
\]

Using the power of a power property, \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), I can simplify further:

\[
5^{-2(x + 2)} = 5^{-3x}.
\]

Now that the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:

\[
-2(x + 2) = -3x.
\]

Expanding the left side:

\[
-2x - 4 = -3x.
\]

Adding \(3x\) to both sides:

\[
x - 4 = 0.
\]

Finally, adding 4 to both sides gives:

\[
x = 4.
\]

So, the solution is \(x = 4\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
