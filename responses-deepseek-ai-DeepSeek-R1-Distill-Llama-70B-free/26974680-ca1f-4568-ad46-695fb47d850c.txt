Question:

A 31-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of an oozing, foul-smelling wound on her foot for 2 days. Physical examination shows a 4-cm, necrotizing wound with a purplish black discoloration over the heel. Crepitant bullae producing profuse amounts of serous drainage are seen. A Gram stain of a tissue biopsy specimen shows gram-positive rods. The causal organism most likely produces which of the following virulence factors?

Options:

A: Enterotoxin
B: Exotoxin A
C: Polysaccharide capsule
D: Hemolysin
E: α-Toxin
F: Pneumolysin
G: Fimbriae
H: Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin
I: Protein A
J: Shiga toxin

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a foot wound. Let's break it down step by step.

So, the patient is a 31-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes. She comes in because of an oozing, foul-smelling wound on her foot that's been there for two days. From what I remember, diabetic patients are prone to foot ulcers, especially because of neuropathy and poor circulation. These ulcers can easily become infected.

Looking at the physical exam findings: a 4-cm necrotizing wound with purplish black discoloration on the heel. Necrotizing suggests that the tissue is dying, which could mean necrotizing fasciitis or another severe infection. The presence of crepitant bullae—blisters that crackle when pressed, indicating gas in the tissue—is a key clue. Gas in tissues usually points towards gas gangrene, which is caused by anaerobic bacteria, especially Clostridium species.

The Gram stain of the tissue biopsy shows gram-positive rods. Gram-positive rods that cause gas gangrene are typically Clostridium perfringens (formerly known as C. welchii). This bacterium is known for producing several toxins, but the main ones are the alpha toxin and theta toxin.

Now, the question is about the virulence factor produced by the causal organism. Let's look at the options:

A: Enterotoxin – That's more associated with Clostridium difficile, which causes diarrhea and colitis, not typically gas gangrene.

B: Exotoxin A – I think that's produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It's involved in destroying tissue but not related to the gas production here.

C: Polysaccharide capsule – This is more about bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella, helping them evade the immune system, but not relevant here.

D: Hemolysin – Some bacteria produce hemolysins to break down red blood cells, but I'm not sure which ones. Maybe Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. But the key issue here is gas and necrosis, not just hemolysis.

E: α-Toxin – Yes, Clostridium perfringens produces alpha toxin, which is a phospholipase C. It breaks down cell membranes, causing cell death and tissue necrosis. This fits the scenario.

F: Pneumolysin – That's from Streptococcus pneumoniae, involved in lung infections, not relevant here.

G: Fimbriae – These are for adhesion, like in E. coli or Neisseria. Not related to the toxin production here.

H: Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin – That's part of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Since the Gram stain here is positive, this isn't the case.

I: Protein A – Staphylococcus aureus has protein A, which helps in binding to antibodies. Not relevant here.

J: Shiga toxin – Produced by Shigella or E. coli (like E. coli O157:H7). Causes severe diarrhea or hemolytic uremic syndrome. Not related to gas gangrene.

So the correct answer should be E: α-Toxin, produced by Clostridium perfringens, which is the likely causative organism here based on the gram-positive rods and gas production.

The patient is a 31-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with a necrotizing foot wound. The wound exhibits purplish black discoloration, crepitant bullae, and serous drainage, which are hallmark signs of gas gangrene. The Gram stain reveals gram-positive rods, and the clinical presentation strongly suggests Clostridium perfringens as the causal organism. This bacterium is notorious for producing α-toxin (phospholipase C), which causes tissue necrosis and gas production by breaking down cell membranes. Among the options provided, α-toxin is the most relevant virulence factor associated with the described condition.

E: α-Toxin
