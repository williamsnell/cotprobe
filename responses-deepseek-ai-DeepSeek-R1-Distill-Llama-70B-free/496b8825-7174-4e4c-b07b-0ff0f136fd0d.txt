Okay, so I've got this physics question about mirrors and images. Hmm, I remember that mirrors can be a bit tricky, but I think I can figure this out. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking about the distance of the image behind a plane mirror. Wait, so when you look in a mirror, the image appears to be behind it, right? I think that's correct. The options are A through J, each giving different possibilities.

I remember from my classes that mirrors, especially plane mirrors, produce virtual images. Virtual images can't be projected on a screen because the light rays don't actually come from the image; they just appear to. So the image's position is virtual, meaning it's behind the mirror.

Now, the key point here is the distance of the image compared to the object's position. Oh right, the law of reflection says that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. So the light rays coming from the object bounce off the mirror and create the image.

Wait, how does that affect the image distance? I think the image is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. So if I stand two meters in front of the mirror, my image appears two meters behind it. So the distance is equal to my distance in front.

Looking at the options, option B says "your distance in front of the mirror". That matches what I was thinking. But let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with something else.

Wait, what's the difference between real and virtual images again? Real images are formed by converging rays, like in a concave mirror, and you can project them on a screen. Virtual images, like in a plane mirror, can't be projected because the rays are diverging. But the distance aspectâ€”yes, the image distance is equal to the object distance for plane mirrors.

So the image is virtual and located behind the mirror at the same distance as the object is in front. So the correct answer should be B. Let me look at the other options quickly to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A says height, which doesn't make sense because distance is about position, not size. C and D talk about halves, which I don't think applies here. E and H are about being less or more, but no, it's equal. F and G are multiples, which again, no. I and J involve squares and roots, which don't fit.

So yeah, I'm confident it's B.

The question asks about the distance of an image behind a plane mirror. When light reflects off a plane mirror, it follows the law of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This results in the formation of a virtual image behind the mirror. The key point is that the distance of the image behind the mirror is equal to the distance of the object in front of the mirror.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The image distance is unrelated to the object's height.
- **B**: Correct. The image distance behind the mirror is equal to the object's distance in front of the mirror.
- **C**: Incorrect. The image distance is not half the object's height.
- **D**: Incorrect. The image distance is not half the object's distance from the mirror.
- **E**: Incorrect. The image distance is not less than the object's distance.
- **F**: Incorrect. The image distance is not three times the object's distance.
- **G**: Incorrect. The image distance is not twice the object's distance.
- **H**: Incorrect. The image distance is not more than the object's distance.
- **I**: Incorrect. The image distance is not related to the square of the object's distance.
- **J**: Incorrect. The image distance is not the square root of the object's distance.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as the image distance behind the mirror equals the object's distance in front of the mirror.

Answer: B
