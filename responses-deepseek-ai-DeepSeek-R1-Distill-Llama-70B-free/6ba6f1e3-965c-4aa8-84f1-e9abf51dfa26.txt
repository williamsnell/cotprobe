Question:

Three friends decided to go bowling together. They made a friendly wager on the match, with the winner receiving a free beer from the other two guys. In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should

Options:

A: not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.
B: not prevail, as the third friend's silence does not qualify as an act of negligence.
C: prevail, because the third friend contributed to his injury by remaining silent.
D: prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.
E: prevail, because the third friend was an accomplice in the first friend's actions.
F: prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.
G: not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.
H: prevail, because the third friend had a moral obligation to warn him.
I: not prevail, because the third friend could not have predicted the first friend's actions.
J: not prevail, because the third friend did not directly cause the injury.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically negligence, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is about three friends bowling. There's a dispute over whether the first friend fouled, and the second friend accuses him of it. The first friend denies it. Then, when the second friend isn't looking, the first friend hits him on the head with a bowling ball, causing an injury. The third friend saw everything but didn't warn the second friend. Now, the second friend is suing the third friend. The question is whether the second friend will prevail in his claim against the third.

So, the issue here is whether the third friend had a duty to warn the second friend. In tort law, generally, there's no duty to rescue someone unless certain conditions are met. Like, if you're just a bystander, you don't have to help. But there are exceptions, right?

One exception is if you have a special relationship with the person in danger, like a parent-child or employer-employee relationship. Another exception is if you caused the danger somehow, then you have a duty to help. Or if you undertook to help, you can't just stop and leave the person worse off.

In this case, the third friend didn't cause the danger. The first friend was the one who hit the second. The third friend just saw what was happening but didn't warn. So, was there a duty for the third friend to act?

I remember the case of Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, where a psychotherapist had a duty to warn a potential victim because the patient had threatened them. But that's a specific situation where there's a foreseeable victim and a special relationship (like therapist-patient). Does that apply here?

Wait, the Tarasoff case is more about the duty of a therapist to warn third parties, which is a specific scenario. In general, without such a special relationship, courts usually don't impose a duty to rescue. So in this case, the third friend is just a friend, not in any special relationship that would create a duty to warn.

Another angle: if the third friend's inaction somehow contributed to the injury, could that be negligence? But I think the general rule is that there's no duty to act unless one of those exceptions applies.

So, looking at the options:

Option A says the third friend was under no duty to warn. That aligns with what I was thinking.

Option D says the third friend was aware of the danger. Awareness alone doesn't create a duty unless there's more.

Option E suggests the third was an accomplice, but there's no indication they helped plan or encouraged the attack.

Option I says the third couldn't have predicted the first's actions, but actually, the third did see what was about to happen, so predictability isn't the issue.

So the main point is whether the third had a duty. Since they're just friends without a special relationship and didn't cause the danger, there's no duty. So the second friend shouldn't prevail against the third.

Wait, but could there be an argument that by being present and not warning, the third friend worsened the situation? Like, if the second friend had known, he could have avoided the injury. But I don't think that's enough to establish a duty. The law typically doesn't require bystanders to act unless specific circumstances apply.

So I think the correct answer is A: not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.

The question revolves around whether the third friend had a legal duty to warn the second friend of impending harm, which would make them liable for negligence. In tort law, there is generally no duty to rescue or warn others unless specific exceptions apply, such as a special relationship (e.g., parent-child or employer-employee), causing the danger oneself, or undertaking to help and then stopping in a way that worsens the situation.

In this case, the third friend was merely a bystander and did not cause the danger. There is no indication of a special relationship or any other exception that would impose a duty to warn. Awareness of the danger alone does not create a legal obligation to act. Therefore, the third friend had no duty to warn the second friend, and the second friend cannot prevail in a claim against the third friend.

The correct answer is **A: not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.**
