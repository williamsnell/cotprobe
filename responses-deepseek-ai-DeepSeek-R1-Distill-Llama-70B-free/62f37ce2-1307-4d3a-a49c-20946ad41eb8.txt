Okay, so I've got this problem about a steel shaft transferring power through gears, and I need to find the force exerted on each bearing. Hmm, let's think. The question says the shaft transfers 50 hp to another parallel shaft. The gear has a diameter of 5 inches and revolves at 1000 rpm. The pressure angle is 25 degrees.

Alright, I remember that when dealing with gears, the torque can be found using the horsepower formula. Oh right, the basic formula is torque (T) equals horsepower multiplied by 5252 divided by the rpm. Wait, let me make sure: T (in lb-ft) = HP * 5252 / rpm.

So plugging in the numbers, HP is 50, rpm is 1000. So T = 50 * 5252 / 1000. Let's calculate that. 50 times 5252 is 262600, divided by 1000 gives 262.6 lb-ft. Hmm, wait, but I think torque is usually expressed in lb-in, so I should convert that. Since 1 ft is 12 inches, 262.6 lb-ft is 262.6 * 12 = 3149.2 lb-in. Wait, no, wait—no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Because the formula gives torque in lb-ft, but I might need it in lb-in for calculating the force on the bearings? Or wait, maybe I don't need to convert units yet.

Wait, another approach: the torque on the gear will create a tangential force on the teeth. The formula for tangential force (F) is F = (T * 1000) / (D * π), but wait, no, that's for metric. Oh wait, in inches, diameter D is in inches, torque T is in lb-in. So F = (2 * T) / D. Because torque is r cross F, which is (D/2) * F = T. So F = 2T / D.

Wait, let me think again. Torque (T) is force (F) times radius (r). So T = F * r, so F = T / r. The radius r is D/2, so F = 2T / D. Oh wait, yes, because r = D/(2), so F = T/(D/2) )= 2T/D.

So I have T in lb-ft, but D is in inches. So I need to make sure the units are compatible. Let's see, D is 5 inches. So I should convert T to lb-in. Oh wait, because 1 ft is 12 inches. So 262.6 lb-ft is 262.6 * 12 = 3149.2 lb-in. Oh yeah, that makes sense.

Now, F = 2 * T / D. T is 3149.2 lb-in, D is 5 in. So F = 2 * 3149.2 /5. Let's compute that. 3149.2 *2 is 6298.4. Divided by 5 gives 1259.68 lb. So the tangential force is about 1259.68 pounds. But wait, that's the force on the gear tooth. But the question is about the force on each bearing.

Wait, right. Because the gear is equally spaced from the shaft bearings, so the shaft is simply supported between two bearings. The tangential force creates a moment, and the bearings each carry part of the load. So the total radial force from the gear is the tangential force divided by the sine of the pressure angle? Or wait, no, that's for axial load if it's a helical gear or something. Wait, no, in spur gears, the force is purely tangential, so the radial load (on the bearings) would be due to the tangential force's bending moment.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the bearings are supporting the shaft. The gear applies a force at its pitch circle. So the gear exerts a tangential force F on the shaft. The shaft is supported by two bearings, and the distance between the bearings is equal to the gear's pitch diameter. Or wait, the problem says the gear is equally spaced from the shaft bearings. So the distance from each bearing to the gear is the same. So the length between the two bearings is twice that distance. Wait, maybe I should sketch it out. The shaft is supported by two bearings, and the gear is in between, equally spaced from each bearing. So the gear is at the midpoint between the two bearings. So the distance from each bearing to the gear is L/2, where L is the distance between the bearings.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance between the bearings. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something here. Oh, perhaps the length of the shaft isn't necessary because the force on each bearing is just half the tangential force? No, that can't be right because in a simply supported beam, the force at each bearing would depend on the load's position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the gear is equally spaced from both bearings, the shaft is simply supported, and the gear is at the midpoint. So the gear applies a force F (tangential) at the midpoint. The reaction forces at the bearings would each be F/2. Wait, is that correct? Because in a simply supported beam with a point load at the center, each end reaction is half the load.

So in that case, each bearing would have a radial force of F / 2. So F is 1259.68 lb, so each bearing would have about 629.84 lb. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are around 600-800. Hmm, closest are option C:620, G:580, etc. So 630 isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go back. Let's recheck the steps.

First, torque calculation. 50 hp, 1000 rpm.

T (lb-ft) = (50 hp * 5252) / 1000 rpm. So 50 *5252 = 262600. Divided by 1000 is 262.6 lb-ft. Convert that to lb-in: 262.6 *12= 3149.2 lb-in.

Then, F = 2T / D. D is 5 inches. So 2 * 3149.2 = 6298.4. Divide by 5: 1259.68 lb. Correct.

Each bearing would support half of that if the load is in the middle. So 1259.68 / 2 = 629.84 lb. So around 630 lb. But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are A:695, B:650, C:620, D:710, E:675, F:760, G:580, H:740, I:725, J:780.

Wait, 630 isn't an option. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait, maybe I forgot to consider the axial load or the radial component due to the pressure angle? Because in gears, the force isn't purely tangential; there's a radial component.

Wait, in spur gears, the contact force has two components: tangential (which we calculated as F) and radial. The radial component is F * tan(theta), where theta is the pressure angle. Wait, no, wait—actually, the radial component is F * tan(pressure angle). Because the force on the tooth is at the pressure angle. So the total force on the gear tooth is F_tangential (which we have as 1259.68 lb), and the radial component would be F_radial = F_tangential * tan(25 degrees).

Wait, let me think: the gear tooth is at a pressure angle of 25 degrees. So the force exerted on the tooth (which is the same as the tangential force) has a radial component. So F_radial = F_tangential * tan(25°). Wait, no, because the force on the tooth is acting at an angle. The tangential component is F, and the radial component is F * tan(theta), where theta is the pressure angle.

Wait, no. Wait, think of the tooth as a wedge. The force applied has a tangential component and a radial component. The torque is based on the tangential component. But the radial component is F_r = F_t * tan(theta).

So F_r = F_t * tan(25°). Let's calculate that. F_t is 1259.68 lb.

Tan(25°) is approximately 0.4663.

So F_r = 1259.68 * 0.4663 ≈ 587.5 lb.

Wait, but that's the radial force. So for each bearing, how does this come into play?

Hmm, the radial force is directed towards the center of the gear. So that would cause a bending moment on the shaft. Wait, but I'm trying to find the force exerted on each bearing. So the bearings have to support both the radial load and the tangential load.

Wait, but earlier I considered only the tangential load. It seems I may have missed the radial component. So each bearing would have to support both the radial force and the tangential force's contribution.

Wait, but in reality, the bearings are typically designed to handle radial and axial loads, not tangential. Or wait, no— the bearings in this setup are supporting the shaft which is under both bending and torsion due to the gear.

Wait, perhaps I should model the shaft as a simply supported beam with the gear applying a point load at its midpoint. The point load would have both a tangential component (which causes bending) and a radial component (which also contributes to bending).

Wait, but the tangential force is causing a torque, which the bearings don't directly react to, because torque is a twisting moment, and the bearings typically handle the radial and axial loads. So maybe the tangential force creates a bending moment, which the bearings must react.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total force on the bearings, combining both the tangential and radial components. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The force on each bearing is the radial force from the gear, which includes both the tangential and radial components. Wait, no, the radial force from the gear is the component that's perpendicular to the tooth, which is F_r. But the tangential force F_t is causing a moment that the bearings have to react.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the shaft as a simply supported beam with the gear force at the center. The total force on the bearings would be the sum of the reactions from the bending moment caused by the tangential force and the radial force. Or maybe the radial force is a separate component acting on the shaft.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total force on each bearing considering both the radial component and the bending due to the tangential force.

Wait, maybe the bearings are only affected by the radial component because the tangential force creates a torque that's transmitted through the shaft, but the bending moment from the tangential force would cause a shear force that each bearing must support.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. The force on each bearing would be the radial component of the gear force, which is F_r. Because the tangential component would cause rotation but not a force on the bearings.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the tangential force would create a bending moment that translates into forces on the bearings.

Wait, perhaps the total force on each bearing is the vector sum of the radial component and the tangential component divided by two because the bearings are spaced symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps each bearing experiences a force equal to the radial component. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to find a formula or approach.

Alternatively, I've read that when a spur gear is mounted on a shaft with two bearings, the radial load on each bearing can be calculated based on the gear's radial force.

Wait, the radial force on the gear is F_r = F_t * tan(theta), where theta is the pressure angle.

So F_r is 587.5 lb, as calculated earlier. Since the gear is midway between the bearings, each bearing would have a radial load of F_r / 2. So 587.5 / 2 = 293.75 lb. But that's much lower than the options given.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the force on each bearing, which should be higher than just the radial component.

Alternatively, perhaps the total force on each bearing is the vector sum of the radial component and the tangential component divided by two.

Wait, but the tangential component is a shear force that causes bending, not a direct force on the bearings. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total force on the shaft from the gear. The gear applies a force at a certain distance from each bearing, causing a moment. The sum of the moments around each bearing would give the reaction forces.

Let me model the system. The shaft is supported by two bearings, distance L apart. The gear is in the middle, so distance from each bearing to the gear is L/2.

The gear applies a tangential force F_t downward at the midpoint. This creates a bending moment on the shaft. The bearings must provide upward forces R1 and R2 to balance the system.

Taking moments about the left bearing: R2 * L = F_t * (L/2). So R2 = F_t / 2. Similarly, taking moments about the right bearing: R1 * L = F_t * (L/2). So R1 = F_t / 2.

So each bearing carries R = F_t / 2. Which brings me back to the initial calculation where each bearing has a force of 629.84 lb. But that's not in the options.

Wait, but perhaps I also need to account for the radial component of the gear force. Because the gear not only applies a tangential force but also a radial force outward (or inward, depending on the direction).

Wait, the radial force from the gear would be F_r = F_t * tan(theta), as earlier. So F_r is 587.5 lb. Since the shaft is supported by two bearings, each bearing would carry half of this radial force. So each bearing's radial load is F_r / 2 ≈ 293.75 lb.

But wait, the radial load and the tangential load are perpendicular to each other. So the total force on each bearing would be the vector sum of these two components.

So each bearing has:

Radial component: 293.75 lb.

Tangential component: 629.84 lb.

Wait, but wait, the tangential component is causing a bending moment, not a direct force on the bearing. Or is it? I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the total force on each bearing is the radial component plus the tangential component divided by 2. Because the tangential component's force (F_t) is applied at the midpoint, each bearing supports half of F_t.

Wait, but F_t is a shear force, not a load that's distributed to the bearings as a radial force. Maybe I'm mixing the concepts here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total force on each bearing is the square root of (F_t/2)^2 + (F_r/2)^2.

So F_bearing = sqrt( (629.84)^2 + (293.75)^2 )

Let me compute that. 629.84 squared is approx 629.84^2 = let's see, 630^2 is 396900, so 629.84^2 is about 396,884.

293.75^2 is approximately (290)^2 = 84100, but more accurately: 293.75 *293.75 = let's compute:

293.75 * 293.75:

= (300 - 6.25)^2 = 300^2 - 2*300*6.25 + 6.25^2

= 90000 - 3750 + 39.0625 = 90000 - 3750 = 86250 + 39.0625 = 86289.0625.

So F_bearing^2 = 396884 + 86289.0625 = 483,173.0625.

Square root of that is sqrt(483173) ≈ let's see, 695^2 is 483,025. Because 700^2 is 490,000. 695^2 = (700-5)^2 = 490000 - 2*700*5 +25 = 490000 -7000 +25=483025. So sqrt(483173)≈695.2 lb.

Ah, so that brings us to approximately 695 lb per bearing. Looking at the options, option A is 695 lbs. So that would be the answer.

Wait, let me recap. The total force on each bearing is the vector sum of half the tangential force and half the radial force. So F = sqrt( (F_t/2)^2 + (F_r/2)^2 ). Plugging in the numbers gives about 695 lbs. Which matches option A.
</think>

To evaluate the force exerted on each bearing, we start by calculating the torque transmitted by the shaft. The torque \( T \) in lb-ft is given by:

\[
T = \frac{\text{HP} \times 5252}{\text{rpm}}
\]

Substituting the given values (\( \text{HP} = 50 \), \( \text{rpm} = 1000 \)):

\[
T = \frac{50 \times 5252}{1000} = 262.6 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]

Converting torque to lb-in (\( 1 \, \text{lb-ft} = 12 \, \text{lb-in} \)):

\[
T = 262.6 \times 12 = 3149.2 \, \text{lb-in}
\]

The tangential force \( F_t \) exerted by the gear is calculated using the formula:

\[
F_t = \frac{2T}{D}
\]

where \( D \) is the gear diameter (\( D = 5 \, \text{in} \)):

\[
F_t = \frac{2 \times 3149.2}{5} = 1259.68 \, \text{lb}
\]

Next, the radial component of the gear force \( F_r \) is determined using the pressure angle (\( \theta = 25^\circ \)):

\[
F_r = F_t \tan(\theta)
\]

\[
F_r = 1259.68 \tan(25^\circ) \approx 1259.68 \times 0.4663 = 587.5 \, \text{lb}
\]

Since the gear is equally spaced from the bearings, each bearing supports half of the tangential and radial forces. The forces on each bearing are:

\[
F_{\text{bearing,t}} = \frac{F_t}{2} = \frac{1259.68}{2} =
