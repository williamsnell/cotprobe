Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let me read it again and figure out what I need to do. The question is about a cylinder piston arrangement compressing air. The initial conditions are 70°F and 14.7 psia, and it's being compressed to 294 psia. The process follows a reversible process with the relation PV^1.3 = C. 

Part (a) asks for the work performed and the heat transferred, and part (b) is about calculating the specific heat, which is considered constant here. They also mention that Q - W = ΔE = ΔU, which I think refers to the first law of thermodynamics, where the change in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done.

Hmm, right, so for a reversible process with PV^n = C, it's a polytropic process. The general formulas for work and heat transfer in such processes should be applicable here. 

First, I'll note down the given data. The initial pressure P1 is 14.7 psia, and the final pressure P2 is 294 psia. The temperature T1 is 70°F, which I should convert to Rankine for calculations because thermodynamic equations typically use absolute temperatures. 

Wait, how do I convert Fahrenheit to Rankine? Oh right, T(R) = T(F) + 459.67. So 70°F is 70 + 459.67 = 529.67 R.

Since it's a polytropic process, PV^n = C, and n is given as 1.3. I remember that for such processes, the work done can be calculated using the formula:

Work, W = (P2 * V2 - P1 * V1) / (n - 1)

But wait, I don't have V1 or V2. Hmm, maybe I can express V2 in terms of V1 using the pressure ratio. From PV^n = C, we can write (P1 V1^n) = (P2 V2^n). Solving for V2 gives V2 = V1 * (P1/P2)^(1/n).

Alternatively, I can express the work in terms of pressures. Let me think. Another formula I remember is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1)

Wait, no, that's not quite right. For expansion, work is positive, for compression, it's negative. Let me get the correct formula.

Wait, the correct expression for work done on the system during compression is:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (n - 1)

But wait, no—actually, when the system is compressed, work is done on the system, so by the first law, W would be positive. But I think the formula I have in mind is for expansion work. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, I can relate the work using the initial and final states. Since it's a polytropic process, the work can be expressed as:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n - 1)

But I need to express V2 in terms of V1. Since PV^n = C, V2 = V1 (P1/P2)^(1/n).

So substituting that into the work equation:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 * V1 (P1/P2)^(1/n)) / (n -1 )

Hmm, but I don't have V1. Wait, maybe I can find the ratio of V1 and V2. Because in the polytropic process, the relation between T and P is also known: (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

Wait, but I'm dealing with work and heat here. Maybe I should focus on the work formula in terms of P and V.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express the work done using the formula:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (1 - n)

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think about the derivation. For a polytropic process, the work done by the system is the integral of P dV from V1 to V2. So W = ∫ P dV from V1 to V2.

Since PV^n = C, P = C V^(-n). So W = ∫ C V^(-n) dV from V1 to V2.

Integrating that gives C [ V^(-n +1) / (-n +1) ) ] evaluated from V1 to V2.

But C is P1 V1^n, so substituting that in:

W = P1 V1^n [ (V2^(-n+1) - V1^(-n+1)) / ( -n +1 ) ]

Which simplifies to:

W = (P1 V1^n) / (1 - n) [ V2^(1 -n) - V1^(1 -n) ]

But since V2 = V1 (P1/P2)^(1/n), substitute that in:

V2^(1-n) = [ V1 (P1/P2)^(1/n) ]^(1-n) = V1^(1-n) (P1/P2)^[(1-n)/n]

So substituting back:

W = (P1 V1^n) / (1 -n ) [ V1^(1-n) (P1/P2)^[(1-n)/n] - V1^(1-n) ) ]

= (P1 V1^n * V1^(1-n)) / (1 -n ) [ (P1/P2)^( (1-n)/n ) -1 ]

Simplify P1 V1^n * V1^(1-n): V1^(n + 1 -n) = V1^1, so it becomes P1 V1.

So W = (P1 V1) / (1 -n ) [ (P1/P2)^( (1-n)/n ) -1 ]

But (1 -n ) is negative because n =1.3, so (1 -n )= -0.3. So we can write:

W = (P1 V1) [ (P2/P1 )^( (n-1)/n ) -1 ] / (n -1 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm getting this correctly. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of pressures.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since I know the relation between P and V, I can find the work done as:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (n -1 )

But I need to express V2 in terms of V1. From PV^1.3 = C,

V2 = V1 (P1/P2)^(1/1.3) 

Wait, n is 1.3, so 1/n is approximately 0.769.

So V2 = V1 * (14.7/294)^(1/1.3)

Calculating that exponent first: 14.7/294 is approximately 0.05. Let me compute 0.05^(1/1.3).

1/1.3 is approximately 0.769. So 0.05^0.769. Let me compute that.

Hmm, using natural logs: ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957. Multiply by 0.769: -2.9957 *0.769 ≈ -2.305. Exponentiate: e^(-2.305) ≈ 0.1. So V2 is about V1 * 0.1. So V2 ≈ 0.1 V1.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.05^(0.769). Alternatively, since 0.05 is 1/20, 1/20^(0.769) = 20^(-0.769). 20^0.769 is approximately e^(0.769 * ln20). ln20 is about 2.9957, so 0.769 * 2.9957 ≈ 2.304. e^2.304 ≈ 10. So 20^0.769≈10, so 20^(-0.769)=1/10=0.1. So V2=0.1 V1.

So V2 = 0.1 V1.

Then, the work W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (n-1) = (294 * 0.1 V1 -14.7 V1 ) / (0.3)

Compute numerator: 294 *0.1 V1 =29.4 V1, 14.7 V1 subtracted gives 14.7 V1. So 29.4 -14.7 =14.7 V1.

So W = (14.7 V1) / 0.3 = 49 V1.

Wait, but units? Hmm, I'm not sure about the units yet. Because the options are in ft-lbm and Btu.

Wait, but I'm not given the volume or mass, which is confusing. How can I find the work without knowing V or mass?

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I should express work per unit mass or something. Or perhaps the problem assumes a certain mass.

Wait, the question doesn't give mass, but maybe I can express the work in terms of P and V, but I'm not getting anywhere without specific values.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of specific work and specific heat transfer. Or maybe the problem expects me to assume that the mass is 1 lbm, which would make the specific quantities apply.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to find the mass. Because I have initial pressure, temperature, and volume (since V2 is a function of V1).

Wait, but I don't have V1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can express the work in terms of the initial temperature and pressure, using the ideal gas law.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = mRT. But without mass, maybe I can express work in terms of mRT.

Wait, but perhaps I can proceed as follows.

Let me think about the work done during compression. For a polytropic process, the work done on the system (since it's compression) is given by:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (n - 1)

As earlier. But I need to express V1 and V2 in terms of the gas constant and temperature.

Because from the ideal gas law, V = mRT/P. So V1 = m R T1 / P1, and V2 = m R T2 / P2.

Wait, but T2 can be found from the polytropic relation. Since for a polytropic process, T1 V1^(n-1) = T2 V2^(n-1). So T2 = T1 (V1/V2)^(n-1).

Alternatively, we can use (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

Yes, that's a better approach. Because from PV^n = C and TV^(1-n) = C, combining gives T = C P^{(n-1)/n} V^{-(n-1)}, but perhaps it's easier to relate T2 to T1 using pressures.

So, T2 = T1 (P2/P1)^[(n-1)/n]

Given that n=1.3, (n-1)=0.3, so (n-1)/n=0.3/1.3≈0.2308.

So,

T2 = 529.67 R * (294 /14.7)^0.2308

Calculate the ratio 294/14.7: 294 /14.7 is 20. Because 14.7 *20=294.

So,

T2 = 529.67 * (20)^0.2308

Compute 20^0.2308. Let me calculate ln(20^0.2308) = 0.2308 * ln20 ≈ 0.2308 * 2.9957 ≈ 0.6915. So e^0.6915≈2. So T2≈529.67 *2=1059.34 R.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Since 20^0.2308: Let's see, 20^0.2 is about 2.5119, and 20^0.03 is about 1.231. So 2.5119 *1.231≈3.09. So T2≈529.67 *3.09≈1637 R.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute ln(20)=2.9957.

So 0.2308 *2.9957=0.6915.

e^0.6915 = let's see, e^0.69 is about 1.993, e^0.6915≈1.996. So 20^0.2308≈1.996, approximately 2. So T2=529.67 *2≈1059.34 R.

Wait, but that's the temperature after compression. Now, how does this help me find the work?

Hmm, perhaps I can express the work in terms of the internal energy change and heat transfer.

Wait, the first law says Q - W = ΔU. Also, for an ideal gas, ΔU = m C_v (T2 - T1), where C_v is the specific heat at constant volume.

But I also know that for a polytropic process, the heat transfer Q is given by:

Q = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) * (1 - n)/(n -1 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see. For a polytropic process, the work done is W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1)/(n-1), and the heat transfer Q is m C_v (T2 - T1) + W.

Wait, no, wait. From the first law, Q = ΔU + W. And since ΔU = m C_v (T2 - T1), and W is the work done by the system, which in compression is negative (since work is done on the system), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let me clarify the sign conventions. In thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered positive, and work done on the system is negative. So in this case, since the piston is compressing the air, the system is doing negative work (work is done on it), so W will be negative.

So, W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1)/(n-1) = (P2 V2 - P1 V1)/(0.3). But since P2 V2 < P1 V1 (because V2 is smaller), the numerator would be negative, making W negative, which aligns with our convention of work done on the system being negative.

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute P2 V2 and P1 V1. Since P2=294 psia, V2= V1*(14.7/294)^{1/1.3}≈0.1 V1. So P2 V2=294 *0.1 V1=29.4 V1. P1 V1=14.7 V1. So 29.4 V1 -14.7 V1=14.7 V1. So W=14.7 V1/(0.3)=49 V1. So positive, but since it's compression, work done on the system, which is negative. Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is W = -(P2 V2 - P1 V1)/(n -1 ). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The work done on the gas during compression is positive. So, perhaps the formula would be:

W_on = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1)

In that case, if P2 V2 < P1 V1, then W_on is positive, which makes sense.

So, let me recast that.

W_on = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1)

Which would be positive in compression.

Since V2=0.1 V1, P2 V2=294 *0.1 V1=29.4 V1. P1 V1=14.7 V1.

So,

W_on=(14.7 V1 -29.4 V1)/(0.3) = (-14.7 V1)/0.3 = -49 V1.

Wait, that gives a negative value, which doesn't make sense because work done on the system should be positive. So perhaps the correct formula is (P2 V2 - P1 V1)/(n-1), but then in this case, that would be negative, implying work done on the system is negative, which is confusing.

I think I'm getting stuck on the sign conventions. Let me try a different approach. Let me think in terms of the first law.

We have Q = W + ΔU.

But the problem states that Q - W = ΔU, which suggests that in the given equation, W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work (expansion), W is positive, and if work is done on the system (compression), W is negative. But since it's compression, W is negative.

Wait, the problem statement says "Q - W = ΔE = ΔU". So if W is the work done by the system, then for compression, W is negative, so Q - W would be Q - (-|W|) = Q + |W| = ΔU.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on finding the work per unit mass, and then the heat transfer per unit mass.

Let me try to express everything in terms of specific quantities (per unit mass).

We know that for an ideal gas, PV = mRT. So V = mRT/P.

So, V1 = (m R T1)/P1, and V2 = (m R T2)/P2.

Earlier, we found T2 = T1 (P2/P1)^[(n-1)/n]

So substituting T2 into V2:

V2 = (m R T1 (P2/P1)^[(n-1)/n ]) / P2.

Simplify:

V2 = (m R T1) / (P2) * (P2/P1)^(0.3/1.3) )

= m R T1 (P2/P1)^(0.3/1.3 -1 )

Wait, 0.3/1.3 is approximately 0.2308. So 0.2308 -1= -0.7692.

So,

V2 = m R T1 (P2/P1)^(-0.7692 )

= m R T1 (P
