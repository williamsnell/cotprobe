Okay, so I've got this question about the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and the classic aging pattern. Hmm, I remember that the WAIS-R is an IQ test that measures different aspects of intelligence. It's divided into Verbal and Performance subtests. I think the Verbal part includes things like Vocabulary, Information, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Similarities, and maybe some others. The Performance part has tasks like Picture Completion, Block Design, Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, and Digit Symbol.

Wait, the question is about the classic aging pattern, which is defined by a decline on specific subtests. I recall that as people age, certain abilities tend to decrease while others remain more stable. From what I've read before, crystallized intelligence, which includes knowledge and verbal skills, tends to remain stable or even improve with age. Fluid intelligence, which involves problem-solving and adaptability, tends to decline.

So the Verbal subtests, like Vocabulary and Information, are related to crystallized intelligence. They usually don't decline as much. On the other hand, Performance subtests, which rely more on fluid intelligence, often show a decline. Specific Performance subtests might include Block Design, which tests spatial reasoning and problem-solving. I think Digit Symbol is another one that shows a decline.

The question asks about the subtests where there's a decline of 2 points. I remember something about the classic pattern involving a decrease on two Performance subtests. Let me think: Block Design and maybe Digit Symbol? Or is it Arithmetic and Digit Span?

Wait, Arithmetic and Digit Span are part of the Verbal subtests. No, wait, the Verbal subtests are Vocabulary, Information, Similarities, and maybe some others. Wait, no, the WAIS-R's Verbal subtests include Vocabulary, Information, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Similarities, and Comprehension. The Performance subtests are Picture Completion, Block Design, etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The classic aging pattern refers to a specific decline. I think the two subtests that decline are Arithmetic and Digit Span, but wait, those are Verbal subtests. Or am I mixing things up?

Wait, no. I think I remember that the classic aging pattern on the WAIS-R refers to a decline on the Digit Symbol (which is a Performance subtest) and maybe Block Design. Alternatively, the pattern might involve a decline on two Performance subtests. Or perhaps it's the Digit Span and Arithmetic, which are Verbal but more time-dependent.

Wait, another approach: the Wechsler scales have a concept where certain subtests are more sensitive to aging. I think Digit Span and Arithmetic are considered "hold" tests, meaning they don't decline as much. No, wait, that can't be right. Hold tests are those that remain stable, like Vocabulary and Information. So the decline would be on the Performance subtests.

Wait, the question is about the classic aging pattern defined as a decline of 2 points on which subtests. I think the correct answer involves the Block Design and maybe Object Assembly subtests, but I'm not sure how the options are presented.

Looking at the options:

Option E: All Performance subtests. So if the decline is on all Performance subtests, that's possible but the question says "2 decline on which subtest(s)", so maybe two specific ones.

Option A: Arithmetic and Digit Span. Those are Verbal subtests. If those decline, that would be unusual, but I think in the classic pattern, Verbal subtests remain more stable.

Option F: Block Design only. Maybe, but the question says "subtest(s)" plural, but the option is singular. Hmm the question says "2 decline on which subtest(s)", so it's two points, but the subtests could be two specific ones.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the classic aging pattern on the WAIS-R refers to a decline on the Block Design and Digit Symbol subtests, which are Performance subtests. But looking at the options, option E is all Performance subtests, which is a broader category.

Wait, the question is about a "decline of 2" on which subtests. I think specifically, the two subtests that show a significant decline with age are Block Design and Digit Symbol. But looking at the options, none of the options directly mention both. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Arithmetic and Digit Span. Those are both Verbal, so I don't think these decline.

B: All except Block Design. No, that doesn't make sense.

C: Similarities and Picture Completion. Similarities is Verbal, Picture Completion is Performance.

D: Vocabulary only. Unlikely, as Vocabulary is a hold.

E: All Performance. So all Performance subtests decline. That might be the case, but the question is about which specific ones. Wait, the question says "the classic aging pattern is defined as 2 decline on which subtest(s)", so two points of decline, but the subtests could be two specific ones.

Wait, perhaps the two subtests are Block Design and Digit Symbol, but I don't see an option that includes both. Let me look at the options again.

Option E is All Performance subtests, which would include Block Design, Digit Symbol, etc. But if the question is asking for the specific two, then E would be too broad.

Wait, another thought: I think the classic aging pattern on the WAIS-R is characterized by a decline on the Digit Symbol and Block Design subtests. Therefore, the two subtests are part of the Performance category. So looking at the options, option E is all Performance subtests. But the question is about which two specifically, not all.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is E, because the decline affects all the Performance subtests. Alternatively, if the question is about a "2" point decline, maybe it's referring to two subtests, not the scale.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: All Performance subtests. Because the Performance scale is more affected by aging. Alternatively, the correct answer could be A, but I don't think so because Arithmetic and Digit Span are Verbal, which are more hold.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific subtests. The WAIS-R's Verbal subtests include Vocabulary, Information, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Similarities, and Comprehension. The Performance subtests include Picture Completion, Block Design, Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, and Digit Symbol.

Classic aging pattern: Verbal IQ tends to be more stable, Performance IQ declines. So the decline would be on the Performance subtests. But the question is about which subtests specifically are the ones that decline.

Wait, I think the classic pattern is that Block Design and Digit Symbol show significant decline. So among the options, E says all Performance subtests. Or perhaps the answer is E because all Performance subtests decline.

But let me think again: the question says "2 decline on which subtest(s)". So maybe it's a decline of 2 points on two subtests. If E includes all Performance, which are multiple, but the question is about the specific ones. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the term "classic aging pattern" is sometimes referred to as the " Aphasia-like" pattern, where certain Verbal subtests decline, but that's more in cases of brain damage. No, that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's the "dementia-like" pattern, but that's different.

Wait, I think I'm confusing it with other patterns. The classic aging pattern on the WAIS-R is that Performance IQ declines more than Verbal. So the decline is on the Performance subtests.

Looking back at the options, option E is "All Performance subtests". So the answer would be E.

Wait, but the question says "decline on which subtest(s)", and the options are:

A: Arithmetic and Digit Span (Verbal)
E: All Performance
G: All except Vocabulary (so all except Verbal Vocabulary)
Hmm, perhaps E is correct.

The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) assesses intelligence through Verbal and Performance subtests. Verbal subtests, such as Vocabulary and Information, are associated with crystallized intelligence, which tends to remain stable with age. In contrast, Performance subtests, such as Block Design and Digit Symbol, are linked to fluid intelligence, which often declines as people age. The classic aging pattern on the WAIS-R is characterized by a decline in Performance subtests, as fluid intelligence is more sensitive to aging effects. 

Given the options, the decline is most accurately reflected in the Performance subtests collectively, as they are more affected by aging. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: All Performance subtests.
