Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area bounded by the spiral r = ln θ, and the interval for θ is from π to 2π. The answer choices are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the formula for the area in polar coordinates involves integrating r squared over the angle interval. The formula is (1/2) multiplied by the integral of r squared dθ, right? So the area A should be:

A = (1/2) ∫[θ=π to θ=2π] (ln θ)^2 dθ

Wait, yeah, that makes sense. So I need to compute this integral of (ln θ)^2 from π to 2π. But how do I do that? I'm a bit rusty on integrating (ln θ)^2.

I think integration by parts might be the way to go. Integration by parts is where you let u be a part of the integrand that you can differentiate, and dv is the rest. The formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du.

So let me set u = (ln θ)^2. Then du would be 2 ln θ * (1/θ) dθ. And dv would be dθ, which means v = θ.

Wait, putting that into the integration by parts formula:

∫(ln θ)^2 dθ = u*v - ∫v du = (ln θ)^2 * θ - ∫ θ * 2 ln θ * (1/θ) dθ.

Simplify that. The integral becomes θ (ln θ)^2 - 2 ∫ ln θ dθ.

Now I have to compute ∫ ln θ dθ, which I think I remember. Let's do integration by parts again for this new integral.

Let u = ln θ, so du = (1/θ) dθ. dv = dθ, so v = θ.

So ∫ ln θ dθ = u*v - ∫ v du = θ ln θ - ∫ θ*(1/θ) dθ.

That simplifies to θ ln θ - ∫1 dθ = θ ln θ - θ + C.

So going back, the original integral becomes θ (ln θ)^2 - 2 [θ ln θ - θ] + C.

Putting it all together, the integral of (ln θ)^2 dθ is θ (ln θ)^2 - 2θ ln θ + 2θ + C.

Now, I need to evaluate this from θ = π to θ = 2π.

So the definite integral from π to 2π is:

[ (2π)(ln 2π)^2 - 2*(2π)*ln(2π) + 2*(2π) ] - [ (π)(ln π)^2 - 2*(π)*ln π + 2*(π) ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, evaluate at θ = 2π:

Term 1: 2π (ln(2π))²
Term 2: -2*(2π)*ln(2π) = -4π ln(2π)
Term 3: 2*(2π) = 4π

Then, evaluate at θ = π:

Term 4: π (ln π)^2
Term 5: -2π ln π
Term 6: 2π

So plugging into the definite integral:

= [Term1 + Term2 + Term3] - [Term4 + Term5 + Term6]
= [2π (ln(2π))² - 4π ln(2π) + 4π] - [π (ln π)^2 - 2π ln π + 2π]

Now, I can factor out π from each term where possible.

Let me compute each part numerically. Maybe I can compute each part step by step.

First, compute ln(2π) and ln(π). Let me approximate these values.

π ≈ 3.1416
2π ≈ 6.2832

ln(π) ≈ ln(3.1416) ≈ 1.1447
ln(2π) ≈ ln(6.2832) ≈ 1.8379

So, let's compute each term:

At θ=2π:
Term1 = 2π * (1.8379)^2 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * (3.3833) ≈ 6.2832 * 3.3833 ≈ let's calculate 6 * 3.3833 is 20.2998, 0.2832 *3.3833≈ ~0.957, so total ≈ 21.2568.

Term2: -4π * 1.8379 ≈ -4 * 3.1416 * 1.8379 ≈ -12.5664 * 1.8379 ≈ let's see, 12 * 1.838 is about 22.056, 0.5664 *1.838≈ ~1.04, so total ≈ -23.096.

Term3: 4π ≈ 12.5664.

So sum of terms at 2π: 21.2568 -23.096 +12.5664 ≈ (21.2568 +12.5664)=33.8232 -23.096=10.7272.

Now at θ=π:
Term4 = π * (1.1447)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 1.3133 ≈ approx 4.127.

Term5: -2π * 1.1447 ≈ -6.2832 *1.1447 ≈ about -7.199.

Term6: 2π ≈6.2832.

So sum of terms at π: 4.127 -7.199 +6.2832 ≈ (4.127 +6.2832)=10.4102 -7.199=3.2112.

Now, the definite integral is the value at 2π minus the value at π: 10.7272 -3.2112=7.516.

But wait, wait! Because the integral I computed is the integral of (lnθ)^2 dθ from π to 2π, which is 7.516. Then the area A is (1/2)*7.516 ≈3.758.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option J is 3.743, which is close. Wait, maybe I made some approximation errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check the approximations.

Let me recalculate more accurately.

First, compute ln(π) accurately: π=3.14159265, ln(3.14159265)=1.144729885.

ln(2π)=ln(6.283185307)=1.837877066.

Compute terms:

At θ=2π:

Term1: 2π*(ln(2π))^2 = 2π*(1.837877066)^2.

Compute (1.837877066)^2: 1.837877066 *1.837877066.

Let me compute 1.8 *1.8=3.24, 1.8*0.0378= approx 0.068, 0.0378^2= approx 0.00143. Wait, perhaps better to do exact calculation:

1.837877066 *1.837877066:

= (approx) 1.83788^2 = (1.8)^2 + 2*(1.8)*(0.03788) + (0.03788)^2.

= 3.24 + 2*(1.8*0.03788)= 3.24 + 2*(0.06818) =3.24 +0.13636=3.37636.

Plus (0.03788)^2= approx 0.001435.

So total (1.83788)^2 ≈3.37636 + 0.001435=3.3778.

So Term1=2π *3.3778 ≈ 6.283185307 *3.3778.

Compute 6 *3.3778=20.2668, 0.283185307 *3.3778≈ ~0.956.

Total Term1≈20.2668 +0.956≈21.2228.

Term2: -4π *1.837877066 = -4 *3.14159265 *1.837877066.

Compute 4 *3.14159265=12.5663706.

12.5663706 *1.837877066 ≈ let's compute 12 *1.837877=22.054527, 0.5663706 *1.837877≈approximately 1.042.

So Term2≈- (22.054527 +1.042)= -23.0965.

Term3: 4π=12.5663706.

So sum for θ=2π: 21.2228 -23.0965 +12.56637.

21.2228 +12.56637=33.78917; 33.78917 -23.0965=10.6927.

At θ=π:

Term4: π*(ln π)^2=3.14159265*(1.144729885)^2.

Compute (1.144729885)^2: 1.144729885 *1.144729885.

Approximate as 1.14473^2. Let's compute 1^2=1, 0.14473*2=0.28946, (0.14473)^2≈0.02095. So (approx 1 + 0.28946 + 0.02095)=1.3104.

But precise calculation: 1.144729885^2 = let's compute 1.144729885 *1.144729885.

1.1 *1.1=1.21, 1.1 *0.044729885=0.04920287, 0.044729885 *1.1=0.04920287, 0.044729885^2≈0.002.

Wait, perhaps better to calculate 11447^2 (approximate as 11447 = 1.1447e4):

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approximation.

(1.144729885)^2 ≈ (using calculator steps):

=1.144729885 *1.144729885
= (1 + 0.144729885)^2
=1 + 2*(0.144729885) + (0.144729885)^2
=1 + 0.28945977 + 0.02094433
=1.3104041.

So Term4=3.14159265 *1.3104041≈3.14159265*1.3104.

Compute 3 *1.3104=3.9312, 0.14159265*1.3104≈ approx 0.14159265 *1.3=0.184, and 0.14159265 *0.0104≈0.00147. So total≈0.184+0.00147=0.1855. So Term4≈3.9312 +0.1855≈4.1167.

Term5: -2π *1.144729885 = -2 *3.14159265 *1.144729885.

Compute 2 *3.14159265=6.2831853. Multiply by 1.144729885: 6.2831853 *1.144729885.

6 *1.144729885=6.86843931, 0.2831853*1.144729885≈ approx 0.2831853*1=0.2831853, 0.2831853*0.144729885≈~0.0409. So total≈0.2831853 +0.0409≈0.3241. So overall 6.2831853 *1.144729885≈approx 6.8684 +0.3241=7.1925. So Term5= -7.1925.

Term6: 2π=6.283185307.

So sum for θ=π: 4.1167 -7.1925 +6.283185307.

4.1167 +6.283185307=10.40 (approx), 10.40 -7.1925=3.2075.

So definite integral is 10.6927 -3.2075≈7.4852.

Then the area A is (1/2)*7.4852≈3.7426.

Looking at the options, option J is 3.743, which matches this calculation. So the correct answer should be J.
</think>

To find the area bounded by the spiral \( r = \ln \theta \) over the interval \( \pi \leq \theta \leq 2\pi \), we use the formula for the area in polar coordinates:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 1: Integration by Parts
To compute the integral \( \int (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta \), we use integration by parts. Let:

- \( u = (\ln \theta)^2 \), so \( du = 2 \ln \theta \cdot \frac{1}{\theta} \, d\theta \),
- \( dv = d\theta \), so \( v = \theta \).

Applying integration by parts:

\[
\int (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta = \theta (\ln \theta)^2 - \int \theta \cdot 2 \ln \theta \cdot \frac{1}{\theta} \, d\theta.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\int (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta = \theta (\ln \theta)^2 - 2 \int \ln \theta \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \int \ln \theta \, d\theta \)
Using integration by parts again for \( \int \ln \theta \, d\theta \), let:

- \( u = \ln \theta \), so \( du = \frac{1}{\theta} \, d\theta \),
- \( dv = d\theta \), so \( v = \theta \).

Thus:

\[
\int \ln \theta \, d\theta = \theta \ln \theta - \int \theta \cdot \frac{1}{\theta} \, d\theta = \theta \ln \theta - \theta + C.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
Substituting back, the integral of \( (\ln \theta)^2 \) becomes:

\[
\int (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta = \theta (\ln \theta)^2 - 2 \left( \theta \ln \theta - \theta \right) + C.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\int (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta = \theta (\ln \theta)^2 - 2\theta \ln \theta + 2\theta + C.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Definite Integral
Evaluate the definite integral from \( \theta = \pi \) to \( \theta = 2\pi \):

\[
\int_{\pi}^{2\pi} (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta = \left[ \theta (\ln \theta)^2 - 2\theta \ln \theta + 2\theta \right]_{\pi}^{2\pi}.
\]

#### At \( \theta = 2\pi \):
- \( \ln(2\pi) \approx 1.8379 \),
- \( \theta (\ln \theta)^2 = 2\pi (1.8379)^2 \approx 21.2228 \),
- \( -2\theta \ln \theta = -4\pi (1.8379) \approx -23.0965 \),
- \( 2\theta = 4\pi \approx 12.5664 \).

Sum at \( \theta = 2\pi \): \( 21.2228 - 23.0965 + 12.5664 \approx 10.6927 \).

#### At \( \theta = \pi \):
- \( \ln(\pi) \approx 1.1447 \),
- \( \theta (\ln \theta)^2 = \pi (1.1447)^2 \approx 4.1167 \),
- \( -2\theta \ln \theta = -2\pi (1.1447) \approx -7.1925 \),
- \( 2\theta = 2\pi \approx 6.2832 \).

Sum at \( \theta = \pi \): \( 4.1167 - 7.1925 + 6.2832 \approx 3.2075 \).

#### Definite Integral:
\[
\int_{\pi}^{2\pi} (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta = 10.6927 - 3.2075 \approx 7.4852.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the Area
The area is:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 7.4852 \approx 3.7426.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to \( 3.7426 \) is **3.743**, which corresponds to **J**.
