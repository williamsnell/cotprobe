Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question says that a force of 2000 dynes produces an acceleration of 500 centimeters per second squared. I need to find the mass of the object being accelerated. The options are given from A to J, each with a different mass in grams. 

Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that force, mass, and acceleration are related by Newton's second law. The formula I think is F equals m times a, right? So F = ma. That makes sense because the more force you apply, the more acceleration you get, and the mass is how much stuff is in the object, which affects how easily it accelerates.

But wait, the units here are in dynes and centimeters per second squared. I'm more familiar with the metric system where force is in newtons, mass in kilograms, and acceleration in meters per second squared. Oh right, I need to make sure the units are consistent so that when I calculate, everything lines up correctly.

Let me think about the units involved. One dyne is equal to how many newtons? I think 1 dyne is 0.00001 newtons because 1 newton is 10^5 dynes. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. I recall that 1 kilogram is 1000 grams. And in terms of force, 1 newton is 10^5 dynes because the metric system uses grams, and dynes are the CGS unit of force. So 1 N = 10^5 dynes. So if the force here is 2000 dynes, I need to convert that into newtons or work with grams and centimeters.

Wait, maybe I should stick to the CGS system since the given units are in dynes and centimeters. Because in the CGS system, the formula F = ma will have F in dynes, m in grams, and a in cm/s². Because I remember that 1 dyne equals 1 gram times 1 cm/s². So if I have F in dynes, a in cm/s², then m will be in grams.

So let's plug the numbers in. F is 2000 dynes, a is 500 cm/s². So m = F/a. So m = 2000 / 500. Let me compute that. 2000 divided by 500 is 4. So 4 grams? 

Wait, looking at the options, option F is 4 gm. So that's probably the answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the unit conversions.

Alternative approach: Let me try converting everything to SI units to see if I get the same answer. Force is 2000 dynes. Since 1 dyne is 1e-5 newtons, so 2000 dynes is 2000e-5 N, which is 0.02 N. Acceleration is 500 cm/s², which is 5 m/s² because 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 500 cm is 5 m. Wait, no, wait. No, the acceleration is 500 cm/s². So converting that to m/s²: 500 cm/s² equals 500 * 0.01 m/s², which is 5 m/s². 

So now using F = ma, so m = F/a. F is 0.02 N, a is 5 m/s². So m = 0.02 /5 = 0.004 kg. Because in SI, mass is in kg. 0.004 kg is 4 grams because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So again, I get 4 grams. So that's consistent. So the mass must be 4 grams, which is option F.

But wait, looking back at the options, option F is 4 gm. So that's the correct answer. I think I'm confident now.

To solve the problem, we use Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. The given values are:

- \( F = 2000 \, \text{dynes} \)
- \( a = 500 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \)

Since the units are in the CGS system (dynes and centimeters), we can directly solve for \( m \) in grams using the formula \( m = \frac{F}{a} \). Substituting the values:

\[
m = \frac{2000}{500} = 4 \, \text{grams}.
\]

To verify, we can also convert the units to SI units:

- \( 1 \, \text{dyne} = 10^{-5} \, \text{newtons} \), so \( 2000 \, \text{dynes} = 0.02 \, \text{N} \),
- \( 1 \, \text{cm/s}^2 = 0.01 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), so \( 500 \, \text{cm/s}^2 = 5 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Using \( m = \frac{F}{a} \) in SI units:

\[
m = \frac{0.02}{5} = 0.004 \, \text{kg} = 4 \, \text{grams}.
\]

Both methods confirm that the mass is \( 4 \, \text{grams} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
