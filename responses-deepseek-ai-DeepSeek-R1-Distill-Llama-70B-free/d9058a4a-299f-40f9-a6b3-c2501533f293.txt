Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with character evidence in a criminal trial. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the scenario is a man on trial for securities fraud. He takes the stand to testify in his own defense. During direct examination, his attorney tries to present evidence of his good character. The prosecution objects. The question is about which statement is correct regarding the admissibility of that evidence.

First, I remember that when a defendant testifies, they can offer evidence of their good character, but there are some rules around it. I think that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(a), character evidence is generally not admissible in criminal cases to prove that the defendant acted in accordance with their character on the occasion in question. However, there's an exception when the defendant offers it as part of their defense. 

Wait, so if the defendant takes the stand, they can introduce evidence of their good character. But I think there's a limit. I remember that the defendant can introduce evidence of their good character, but only in the form of reputation or opinion testimony. They can't just introduce specific acts of good conduct unless it's part of their reputation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character. That sounds correct because the defendant is allowed to present evidence of their good character when they testify. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Option B: The defendant may not introduce evidence to show honesty because character evidence is inadmissible. This can't be right because when the defendant testifies, they can present character evidence. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The defendant may introduce evidence of his past good deeds. I think this is incorrect because specific acts aren't admissible. They can only present reputation or opinion evidence. So past good deeds as specific acts wouldn't be allowed. So C is wrong.

Option D: The defendant may introduce evidence to show honesty. Well, honesty is a trait related to character. So if they're allowed to present good character evidence, then D might be correct. But wait, the form matters. They can't present specific acts, but can they present reputation for honesty? I'm not sure if this is allowed or if it's considered a specific trait. 

Option E: The defendant may introduce evidence to show truthfulness. Similar to D, truthfulness is another character trait. But again, the form matters. I think the defendant can present evidence of good character, which could encompass truthfulness if it's about reputation.

Option F: The defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it's inquired into on cross-examination. I don't think that's right. Once the defendant takes the stand, they can present their own character evidence on direct without waiting for cross.

Option G: The defendant may not introduce evidence of good character unless the prosecution first attacks his character. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think the defendant can introduce good character evidence even if the prosecution hasn't attacked their character. Because when the defendant testifies, they can offer it as part of their case. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The defendant may not introduce evidence to show honesty unless it's inquired into on cross-examination. This is similar to F. I think once the defendant is on the stand, they can bring up their honesty as part of their character without the prosecution having to bring it up first. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The defendant may introduce evidence to show dishonesty. No, that doesn't make sense. The defendant would want to show positive traits, not negative ones. Plus, the question is about the prosecution objecting to the defense presenting good character evidence, so I is irrelevant.

So reviewing, the correct approach is that the defendant can introduce evidence of their good character, such as reputation or opinion, when they testify. Specific acts (like past good deeds) aren't allowed. So looking at the options:

A says the defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character. That's correct because the defendant can present such evidence when testifying.

D says the defendant may introduce evidence to show honesty. Wait, but how is that presented? If it's about reputation for honesty, then it's allowed. But if it's specific acts, it's not. So perhaps D is correct if it's about reputation. Similarly, E is about truthfulness. 

Wait, let me think again. I remember that when a defendant testifies, they can offer evidence of their good character, which could include traits like honesty or truthfulness, but the evidence must be in the form of reputation or opinion, not specific acts.

Looking back at the options, option A is generalâ€”showing good moral character. Option D and E are more specific traits. But the question is about whether the defendant can introduce such evidence. So the correct answer should be that the defendant may introduce evidence of good character, so A is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think when the defendant testifies, they can offer evidence of their good character as part of their testimony. So option A is correct. But I also thought that the prosecution can then attack the defendant's character with specific acts, but that's a different matter.

So the correct answer here is A. The defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character.

The correct answer is based on the principle that a defendant who testifies in their own defense may introduce evidence of their good moral character. This is allowed under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(a), which permits the defendant to present character evidence as part of their defense. However, such evidence must be presented in the form of reputation or opinion testimony, not through specific acts. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that the defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character, which aligns with the rule allowing character evidence when the defendant testifies.
- **Option B** is incorrect because character evidence is admissible when the defendant testifies.
- **Option C** is incorrect because specific acts of good conduct are not admissible; only reputation or opinion testimony is allowed.
- **Option D** and **Option E** are less precise than Option A, as they focus on specific traits (honesty and truthfulness) rather than the broader concept of good moral character.
- **Option F** and **Option H** are incorrect because the defendant can introduce character evidence on direct examination without waiting for cross-examination.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the defendant can introduce good character evidence even if the prosecution has not attacked their character.
- **Option I** is irrelevant and incorrect, as the defendant would not introduce evidence of dishonesty.

Thus, the most accurate and comprehensive answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
