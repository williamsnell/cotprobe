Okay, so I have this question about white noise processes and their properties. Hmm, I remember that white noise is a type of random process, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let's break down each part.

The question lists four statements (i-iv) and asks which are true for a white noise process. The options are combinations of these statements labeled A to J.

First, I'll try to recall what each term means. White noise, as I remember, is a process where each observation is independent of the others. So each shock is random and doesn't depend on previous ones.

Statement (i): A zero mean. I think white noise usually has a mean of zero because each shock is random around zero. So (i) should be correct.

Statement (ii): A constant variance. Yes, because in white noise, the variance doesn't change over time. Each shock has the same variance. So (ii) is correct.

Statement (iii): Autocovariances that are constant. Wait, autocovariance measures the covariance between the process at different lags. For white noise, except at lag zero (which is the variance), the autocovariances should be zero. So if autocovariances are constant, maybe that's not right. Or am I mixing up something? Oh wait, the autocovariance function for white noise is zero except at lag zero. So (iii) says the autocovariances are constant. But if they're zero except at lag zero, then the only non-zero value is at lag zero. So the autocovariance isn't constant across all lags, because at lag zero it's non-zero, and elsewhere it's zero. So statement (iii) is incorrect.

Statement (iv): Autocovariances that are zero except at lag zero. Yes, that's exactly what I just thought. So (iv) is correct.

So now, which statements are correct? (i) yes, (ii) yes, (iii) no, (iv) yes.

Wait, let me double-check. White noise is characterized by being a sequence of uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and constant variance. The autocovariance at lag zero is the variance, and at other lags, it's zero. So (i), (ii), and (iv) are correct, and (iii) is wrong.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H is (i), (ii), and (iv) only. That matches our conclusion.

Wait, let me review the options again. The options are:

A: (ii), (iii), (iv) only → No, because (iii) is wrong.

B: All four → No, because (iii) is wrong.

C: (i) and (ii) only → Because it misses (iv).

D: (i), (ii), (iii) → Includes (iii), which is wrong.

E: (i) and (iii) → No, (iii) is wrong.

F: (i), (iii), (iv) → Again, (iii) is wrong.

G: (ii) and (iv) → Missing (i).

H: (i), (ii), (iv) → Correct.

I: (ii) and (iii) → No.

J: (iii) and (iv) → No.

So the correct answer is H.

A white noise process is characterized by being a sequence of uncorrelated random variables with the following properties:

1. **Zero mean**: White noise has a mean of zero because each shock is random and centered around zero.  
2. **Constant variance**: The variance of the process does not change over time.  
3. **Autocovariances**: The autocovariance function is zero at all lags except lag zero, where it equals the variance.  

Analyzing the statements:  
- **(i)** is correct because white noise has a zero mean.  
- **(ii)** is correct because white noise has constant variance.  
- **(iii)** is incorrect because autocovariances are not constant across all lags; they are zero except at lag zero.  
- **(iv)** is correct because autocovariances are zero except at lag zero.  

Thus, the correct combination is **(i), (ii), and (iv)**. Among the options, **H** matches this combination.
