Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer that has 16, 15, and 12 as its factors. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the question says the number has factors of 16, 15, and 12. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this a bit mixed up. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question is asking for the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 16, 15, and 12. Oh right, because if a number has factors of 16, 15, and 12, that means those numbers are factors of it. So the number must be a common multiple of all three. So I'm looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 15, and 12.

Alright, so to find the LCM, I should break each number down into its prime factors.

Let's start with each number:

16: I know 16 is 2 to the power of 4, so 2^4.

15: That's 3 times 5, so 3^1 * 5^1.

12: 12 factors into 2^2 * 3^1.

Now, the LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations.

So for prime 2: the highest power is 2^4 (from 16).

For prime 3: the highest power is 3^1 (both 15 and 12 have 3^1).

For prime 5: the highest power is 5^1 (only in 15).

So the LCM should be 2^4 * 3^1 * 5^1.

Let me calculate that.

2^4 is 16, 3 is 3, 5 is 5. So 16 *3 =48, then 48 *5=240.

So the LCM is 240. Let me check the options. Option A is 240, so that's the answer.

Wait, but I should make sure. Let me verify if 240 is indeed divisible by all three numbers.

240 divided by 16: 240 /16 =15. Yes, that's an integer.

240 divided by 15: 16, which is integer.

240 divided by 12: 20, which is integer.

Yes, so 240 is the smallest such number. So the correct option is A.

To determine the smallest positive integer that has 16, 15, and 12 as factors, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. The LCM is calculated by taking the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers:

- **16** = \(2^4\)
- **15** = \(3^1 \cdot 5^1\)
- **12** = \(2^2 \cdot 3^1\)

The LCM is obtained by multiplying the highest powers of each prime:
- For \(2\): \(2^4\)
- For \(3\): \(3^1\)
- For \(5\): \(5^1\)

Thus, the LCM is:
\[
2^4 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 = 16 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 240
\]

Verification:
- \(240 \div 16 = 15\) (integer)
- \(240 \div 15 = 16\) (integer)
- \(240 \div 12 = 20\) (integer)

Therefore, the smallest positive integer with factors of 16, 15, and 12 is **240**.
