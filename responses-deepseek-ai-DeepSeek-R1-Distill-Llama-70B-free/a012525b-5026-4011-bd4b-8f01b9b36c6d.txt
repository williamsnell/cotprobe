Okay, so I've got this problem about folding a piece of paper. Let me read it again. The paper is 8.5 by 11 inches. We're folding it in half repeatedly, each time folding the longer side. I need to find the longest side after the second fold, and express it as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, okay, so first, let me visualize this. The paper is standard US letter size. The longer side is 11 inches, the shorter is 8.5. When you fold it in half, you're bringing the longer side together, right?

Wait, so each fold is along the longer side. So the first fold would be along the 11-inch side. When you fold it in half, the longer side gets halved, but the shorter side becomes the longer one now? Or wait, does the longer side become the shorter?

Wait, no. Let me think. When you fold a rectangle in half by bringing the longer sides together, the new dimensions will have the shorter side and half the longer side. So, for example, if the paper is 8.5 by 11, first fold: the longer side is 11, so when you fold it, the new longer side becomes 8.5 inches, and the other side becomes 11/2 = 5.5 inches. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you fold 11 in half, it becomes 5.5, but the other side is still 8.5. So after the first fold, the dimensions are 8.5 by 5.5. Now, the longer side is 8.5 inches.

Wait, no, after the first fold, the paper is folded along the longer side, so the original longer side (11) is now half, 5.5. But what's the other dimension? It would be the same as the shorter side before folding, which is 8.5. So after the first fold, the paper is 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches. So now, the longer side is 8.5 inches.

Wait, but wait a second. When you fold a paper in half, the dimensions change. Let's think of it as the area being halved each time. The original area is 8.5 * 11 = 93.5 square inches. After first fold, it's 8.5 * 5.5 = 46.75. Wait, no, that's not right because 8.5 *5.5 is 46.75, but the original area is 93.5, so half would be 46.75. So that's correct.

So after the first fold, the dimensions are 8.5 by 5.5. So the longer side is now 8.5 inches. Now, the second fold: we take this 8.5-inch longer side and fold it in half. So the new longer side would be 5.5 inches, and the folded side becomes 8.5 / 2 = 4.25 inches. Wait, no, because when you fold the longer side, the new longer side becomes the shorter of the two.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me try a different approach. Each fold is along the longer side, resulting in the longer side being halved each time.

So first, the paper is 8.5 (width) by 11 (length). First fold: fold along the length, so the new length becomes 11/2 = 5.5 inches. The width remains 8.5 inches. So after first fold, the dimensions are 8.5 by 5.5. Now, the longer side is 8.5 inches.

Second fold: fold along the longer side, which is 8.5 inches. So 8.5 / 2 = 4.25 inches. But wait, when you fold it, the other dimension (5.5 inches) becomes the longer side again? Because the paper is folded in half, so the other side is now longer.

Wait, no. Let me think of it physically. If I have a paper that's 8.5 by 5.5 after the first fold. The longer side is 8.5. So I fold it along the longer side, bringing the two 8.5-inch ends together. The resulting paper would have dimensions of 5.5 inches by 4.25 inches. So the longer side now is 5.5 inches.

Wait, but wait, 5.5 is longer than 4.25. So after the second fold, the longer side is 5.5 inches. But wait, that doesn't make sense because 5.5 is longer than 4.25. So the longer side after the second fold would be 5.5 inches.

But wait, that's the same as after the first fold. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the folding affects the dimensions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model each fold step by step.

First, initial dimensions: 8.5 (width) x 11 (height). Longer side is 11.

First fold: fold along the longer side (height of 11). So after folding, the height becomes 11/2 = 5.5 inches. The width remains 8.5 inches. So now, the paper is 8.5 x 5.5. So the longer side is 8.5 inches.

Second fold: fold along the longer side, which is now 8.5 inches. So we halve the 8.5-inch side. 8.5 / 2 = 4.25 inches. The other side was 5.5 inches. So after the second fold, the dimensions are 5.5 inches x 4.25 inches. Therefore, the longer side is 5.5 inches.

Wait, but 5.5 is longer than 4.25, so yes, that's correct. So the longest side after the second fold is 5.5 inches.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.5. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thought. Alternatively, when folding, perhaps the longer side becomes the shorter side after each fold.

Wait, let's think of the first fold: 11 inches becomes 5.5, so the paper is 8.5 x 5.5. Now, the longer side is 8.5. Fold that, so 8.5 becomes 4.25. So the dimensions are 5.5 x 4.25. So the longer side is 5.5 inches, which is option B.

Yes, that makes sense.

The problem involves repeatedly folding an 8.5-by-11-inch piece of paper in half, each time along the longer side, and determining the length of the longest side after the second fold.

1. **Initial dimensions**: The paper starts with dimensions 8.5 inches (shorter side) and 11 inches (longer side).

2. **First fold**: The longer side (11 inches) is folded in half, reducing it to \( \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \) inches. After the first fold, the dimensions are 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches, with the longer side now being 8.5 inches.

3. **Second fold**: The new longer side (8.5 inches) is folded in half, reducing it to \( \frac{8.5}{2} = 4.25 \) inches. After the second fold, the dimensions are 5.5 inches by 4.25 inches, with the longer side now being 5.5 inches.

Thus, the length of the longest side immediately after the second fold is 5.5 inches.

The correct answer is **B**.
