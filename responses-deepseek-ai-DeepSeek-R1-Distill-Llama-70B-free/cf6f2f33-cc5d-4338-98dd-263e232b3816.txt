Okay, so I've got this question about homomorphisms from Z to Z_2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, first, I need to remember what a homomorphism is. A group homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. So for any a and b in the domain, f(a + b) should equal f(a) + f(b) in the codomain.

The question is asking about homomorphisms from Z (the integers under addition) to Z_2 (the integers modulo 2, which is like {0,1} with addition mod 2). So I need to find all possible functions f: Z → Z_2 that satisfy the homomorphism property.

Wait, Z is an infinite cyclic group, right? And Z_2 is a finite cyclic group of order 2. So what do homomorphisms between cyclic groups look like? I think for cyclic groups, a homomorphism is determined by where the generator is sent. But Z is infinite, so its generator is 1 (since every integer can be generated by adding 1 to itself repeatedly).

In Z_2, the elements are 0 and 1. So if I define f: Z → Z_2, then f(1) can be either 0 or 1 in Z_2, because those are the only elements. Let me think: if f(1) = 0, then for any integer n, f(n) = f(1+1+...+1) n times, which would be f(1) added n times. But in Z_2, adding 0 any number of times is still 0. So in this case, every integer maps to 0.

On the other hand, if f(1) = 1, then for any n, f(n) = 1 added n times in Z_2. Since addition in Z_2 wraps around modulo 2, this means f(n) is 0 if n is even and 1 if n is odd. So this gives a different mapping where even integers go to 0 and odd to 1.

Wait, but are there any other possibilities? Since 1 is the generator of Z, the homomorphism is entirely determined by where 1 is mapped. Because for any n in Z, f(n) = f(1)^n, but since we're dealing with addition, it's more like f(n) is f(1) added n times.

So in Z_2, the possible images for f(1) are only 0 and 1. Therefore, there are two possible homomorphisms: one that sends everything to 0, and one that sends even numbers to 0 and odd to 1.

Wait, but I should double-check if these are the only options. Are there any other elements in Z_2? No, it's just 0 and 1. So yes, only two choices for f(1). Each choice gives a unique homomorphism.

So the number of homomorphisms from Z to Z_2 is 2. Looking back at the options, option J is 2, so the answer should be J.

To determine the number of homomorphisms from \( \mathbb{Z} \) (the integers under addition) to \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) (the integers modulo 2, with elements \{0, 1\}), we analyze the structure of these groups and the properties of homomorphisms.

1. **Understanding the Groups**:  
   - \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an infinite cyclic group generated by 1.  
   - \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) is a finite cyclic group of order 2, with elements 0 and 1.  

2. **Homomorphism Properties**:  
   A group homomorphism \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_2 \) must satisfy \( f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \). Since \( \mathbb{Z} \) is generated by 1, the homomorphism is entirely determined by the image of 1 in \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \).

3. **Possible Images of 1**:  
   In \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \), the elements are 0 and 1. Thus, \( f(1) \) can only be mapped to 0 or 1.  
   - If \( f(1) = 0 \), then for any \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \), \( f(n) = f(1 + 1 + \dots + 1) = 0 \). This defines the trivial homomorphism where every integer maps to 0.  
   - If \( f(1) = 1 \), then for any \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \), \( f(n) = n \cdot f(1) \). In \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \), this means \( f(n) = 0 \) if \( n \) is even and \( f(n) = 1 \) if \( n \) is odd. This defines a non-trivial homomorphism.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Since there are only two possible choices for \( f(1) \) (0 or 1), there are exactly two homomorphisms from \( \mathbb{Z} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \). These correspond to the trivial homomorphism and the non-trivial homomorphism described above.

Thus, the number of homomorphisms from \( \mathbb{Z} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) is **2**.
