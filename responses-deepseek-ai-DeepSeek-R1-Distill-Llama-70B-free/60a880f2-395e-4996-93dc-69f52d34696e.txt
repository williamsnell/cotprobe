Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

Darv Co. has a current ratio of 3-to-1 and a quick ratio of 1-to-1. Current liabilities are $322,000. The question is asking for the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses. Hmm, right.

Alright, let's think about what these ratios mean. The current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. And the quick ratio is (current assets minus inventory minus prepaid expenses) divided by current liabilities. Oh wait, because the quick ratio excludes inventory and prepaid expenses from current assets. So that's important.

So, the current ratio is 3:1. That means current assets are 3 times current liabilities. Since current liabilities are $322,000, current assets must be 3 * 322,000. Let me calculate that. 3 times 322 is 966, so 966,000. So current assets are $966,000.

Now, the quick ratio is 1:1. So (current assets - inventory - prepaid expenses) divided by current liabilities equals 1. We know current liabilities are 322,000, so the numerator must be equal to 322,000. 

Wait, let me write the equations out. 

Current ratio: CA / CL = 3/1 → CA = 3 * CL = 3 * 322,000 = 966,000.

Quick ratio: (CA - Inventory - Prepaid) / CL = 1/1 → CA - Inventory - Prepaid = CL → 966,000 - (Inventory + Prepaid) = 322,000.

So I can rearrange that to find Inventory + Prepaid: 

Inventory + Prepaid = 966,000 - 322,000 = 644,000.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check because sometimes I mix up the formulas. Quick ratio is (current assets - inventory - prepaid expenses) all over current liabilities. So yeah, the numerator is 322,000 because the ratio is 1, so 322,000 divided by 322,000 is 1. So that makes sense.

So the total of inventory and prepaid expenses is 644,000. Let me look at the options. Option F is 644,000. Option F should be the correct answer.

The current ratio is calculated as current assets (CA) divided by current liabilities (CL). Given the current ratio is 3-to-1 and CL is $322,000, CA is:

\[
CA = 3 \times CL = 3 \times 322,000 = 966,000.
\]

The quick ratio is calculated as (CA - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) divided by CL. Given the quick ratio is 1-to-1 and CL is $322,000, the numerator (CA - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) must equal $322,000. Therefore:

\[
CA - (Inventory + Prepaid) = CL \implies 966,000 - (Inventory + Prepaid) = 322,000.
\]

Solving for Inventory + Prepaid:

\[
Inventory + Prepaid = 966,000 - 322,000 = 644,000.
\]

From the options provided, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is **$644,000**, which corresponds to option F.

**Answer: F**
