Okay, so I have this problem to calculate the volume of a cylinder containing CO2. Hmm, let me think through the steps.

Alright, the data given is 60 lbm of carbon dioxide at 230°F and 23 psig pressure. Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia. I need to find the volume, and the options are from A to J.

First, I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, I need to make sure I'm using the right units here because the gas constant R depends on the units.

Wait, the pressure is given in psig. Oh right, psig is gauge pressure, so I have to convert that to absolute pressure. So absolute pressure P is psig + atmospheric pressure. So P = 23 psig + 14.7 psia = 37.7 psia.

Next, the temperature is 230°F. I think I need to convert that to absolute temperature, which is in Rankine. To convert Fahrenheit to Rankine, the formula is T(R) = T(F) + 459.67. So 230 + 459.67 equals 689.67 R.

Now, the number of moles n is needed. I have the mass of CO2 as 60 lbm. The molecular weight of CO2 is 44.01 (carbon is 12.01, oxygen is 16 each, so 12.01 + 2*16 = 44.01 g/mol). So moles n = mass / molecular weight. But wait, the units need to be consistent. The mass is in lbm, so I should convert that to pounds-mass, but since molecular weight is in lbm per lbmol, I think the units will work out.

Wait, wait. Molecular weight in English units is typically in lbm per lbmol. So 44.01 g/mol is 44.01 lbm per lbmol divided by 453.592 (since 1 lbm = 453.592 grams). Wait, no, actually, because 1 lbmol is 454 grams roughly. So I think I can just use n = mass (lbm) / molecular weight (lbm/lbmol). So n = 60 / 44.01 ≈ 1.363 lbmol.

Wait, I'm getting n as approximately 1.363 lbmol. Let me double-check that calculation. 60 divided by 44.01 is about 1.363, yes.

Now, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. I need to find V. So V = nRT / P.

But wait, I need to make sure R is in the correct units. R in English units is 10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol·R). Let me confirm that value. Yes, I think R is 10.7316 for those units.

Putting it all together:

n is 1.363 lbmol,
R is 10.7316,
T is 689.67 R,
P is 37.7 psia.

So V = (1.363 * 10.7316 * 689.67) / 37.7.

Let me calculate the numerator first. 1.363 * 10.7316 ≈ 14.63. Then 14.63 * 689.67 ≈ around 14.63 * 690 ≈ 10,000? Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 1.363 * 10.7316 = let's compute:

1.363 * 10 = 13.63

1.363 * 0.7316 ≈ approximately 1.363 * 0.7 is 0.954, and 1.363 * 0.0316 is about 0.043. So total ≈ 0.954 + 0.043 = 0.997. So total is 13.63 + 0.997 = 14.627 lbmol·R/(psia·ft³) * R? Wait, no, wait, that's just the product n*R. Then multiply by T.

Wait no, V = (nRT)/P. So nRT is 1.363 * 10.7316 * 689.67.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 1.363 * 10.7316:

1 * 10.7316 = 10.7316

0.363 * 10.7316 ≈ 3.896 (since 0.3 *10.73=3.219, 0.063*10.73≈0.676; total around 3.895)

So total is 10.7316 + 3.895 ≈ 14.6266.

Then multiply by T = 689.67 R.

14.6266 * 689.67 ≈ Let me compute 14.6266 * 700 = 10,238.62, but since 689.67 is less than 700 by about 10.33, I'll subtract 14.6266 *10.33.

14.6266 *10 = 146.266, 14.6266 *0.33≈4.826. So 146.266 +4.826 = 151.092. So 14.6266*689.67 ≈ 10,238.62 -151.092 ≈ 10,087.528.

Then divide by P =37.7 psia.

So V = 10,087.528 / 37.7 ≈ Let's compute 37.7 * 267 = 37.7*200=7540, 37.7*67=2525.9. 7540 +2525.9= 10065.9. So 267 gives about 10065.9, which is close to our numerator of 10,087.5. So 267 *37.7=10065.9, so 10,087.5 would be a little less than 267.

Wait, 37.7 *267=10065.9, which is 21.4 higher than 10,087.5. So 267 - (21.4/37.7) ≈ 267 - 0.567 ≈ 266.433. So V ≈ 266.433 ft³.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, the options are A:250, B:290, C:275, D:238, E:300, F:268, G:320, H:215, I:310, J:285.

Wait, I calculated around 266.4 ft³. The closest option is F:268 ft³. But let me double-check my calculation because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate the numerator.

n=60 lbm /44.01 lbm/lbmol= 60/44.01.

Let me compute 60/44.01. 44.01 *1=44.01, 44.01*1.36=44.01*1=44.01, 44.01*0.36=15.8436; so 44.01+15.8436=59.8536. So 1.36 gives 59.85 lbm. So 60 is 1.36 + (0.1464/44.01). 0.1464/44.01 is about 0.0033, so n≈1.3633 lbmol.

n=1.3633.

R is 10.7316.

So n*R=1.3633 *10.7316= Let's compute:

1 *10.7316=10.7316

0.3 *10.7316=3.2195

0.06 *10.7316=0.6439

0.0033 *10.7316≈0.0354.

Adding up: 10.7316 +3.2195=13.9511; +0.6439=14.595; +0.0354=14.6304.

So nR=14.6304.

Multiply by T=689.67 R.

14.6304 *689.67 = Let me compute this as 14.6304 * 689.67.

I'll break it down:

14 * 689.67 = 9655.38

0.6304 *689.67 ≈ 0.6*689.67=413.80, 0.0304*689.67≈20.94. So total 413.80 +20.94=434.74.

So total nRT=9655.38 +434.74=10090.12.

Now, P=37.7 psia.

V=10090.12 /37.7= Let's compute this division.

37.7 * 267= ?

37 * 267= 9879.

0.7 *267=186.9.

So total 9879 +186.9=10065.9.

We have 10090.12, which is 10090.12-10065.9=24.22 higher.

Now, 24.22 /37.7 ≈ 0.642.

So 267 +0.642=267.642 ft³.

Approximately 267.6 ft³.

Looking at the options, F is 268 ft³, which is very close. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but maybe I should check if using more precise values would get closer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular weight.

Wait, the molecular weight of CO2 is 44.01 g/mol. So 1 lbmol is 44.01 lbm? Wait no, wait. No, wait, in the English system, the molecular weight is in lbm per lbmol. So yes, 44.01 lbm per lbmol. So n =60/44.01=1.363 lbmol. That seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure conversion was wrong. The pressure is 23 psig plus 14.7 psia, which is 37.7 psia. Correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in gas calculations, CO2 might not behave ideally, especially at high pressures. But the problem says to use the ideal gas law, I think, because it doesn't mention anything else. So we proceed with PV=nRT.

So I think my calculation is correct, leading to approximately 267.6 ft³, which is closest to option F:268 ft³.

To calculate the volume of the cylinder containing 60 lbm of carbon dioxide at 230°F and 23 psig, the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \) is applied. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Convert pressure to absolute pressure**:  
   Since the pressure is given as 23 psig (gauge pressure), the absolute pressure \( P \) is:  
   \[
   P = 23 \, \text{psig} + 14.7 \, \text{psia} = 37.7 \, \text{psia}.
   \]

2. **Convert temperature to Rankine**:  
   The temperature in Rankine is:  
   \[
   T = 230 \, \text{°F} + 459.67 = 689.67 \, \text{°R}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of moles (\( n \))**:  
   The molecular weight of CO\(_2\) is 44.01 lbm/lbmol. Using the mass of CO\(_2\) (\( m = 60 \, \text{lbm} \)):  
   \[
   n = \frac{m}{\text{molecular weight}} = \frac{60}{44.01} \approx 1.363 \, \text{lbmol}.
   \]

4. **Apply the ideal gas law**:  
   The gas constant \( R \) in English units is \( 10.7316 \, \text{psia-ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·°R}) \). Rearranging \( PV = nRT \) to solve for \( V \):  
   \[
   V = \frac{nRT}{P}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   V = \frac{(1.363)(10.7316)(689.67)}{37.7}.
   \]  
   First, calculate the numerator:  
   \[
   nRT = (1.363)(10.7316)(689.67) \approx 10,090.12 \, \text{lbmol·psia·°R}.
   \]  
   Then divide by \( P \):  
   \[
   V = \frac{10,090.12}{37.7} \approx 267.6 \, \text{ft}^3.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated volume is approximately \( 267.6 \, \text{ft}^3 \), which is closest to option **F: 268 ft\(^3\)**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: 268 ft\(^3\)**
