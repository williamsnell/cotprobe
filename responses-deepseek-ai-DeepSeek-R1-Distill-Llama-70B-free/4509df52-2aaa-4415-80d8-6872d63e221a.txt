Okay, so I've got this problem here about an installment plan for a radio. Let me try to figure it out. The radio costs $39.90, and the installment plan requires a $5 down payment and then $3.10 a month for a year. I need to find the annual interest rate for this plan. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how to approach this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I think I should figure out the total amount paid under the installment plan. The down payment is $5, and then there are 12 monthly payments of $3.10 each. So the total paid would be 5 plus (3.10 * 12). Let me calculate that: 3.10 times 12 is 37.20. Adding the down payment, the total is 5 + 37.20 = $42.20. So over the year, the total paid is $42.20 for a radio that's priced at $39.90. That means the extra $2.30 is interest, right?

Wait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Because the interest is calculated differently in installment plans. I remember something about the time value of money and maybe using the concept of present value. Oh right, the installment plan is a series of payments, so each payment's present value should add up to the original price. The interest rate would be the rate that makes the present value of all payments equal to $39.90.

So, the formula I think I need is the present value of an annuity. The present value (PV) is calculated as PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. Then, since we're looking for the annual rate, we'll have to figure out the monthly rate first and then multiply by 12.

Wait, but the down payment is a lump sum right now, so the present value would be the down payment plus the present value of the monthly payments. So the equation would be:

Down payment + (PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]) = Price of the radio.

Plugging in the numbers: 5 + 3.10 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-12)/r] = 39.90.

So I need to solve for r here. But this seems a bit tricky because r is in the denominator and also in an exponent. I think I might have to use trial and error or an approximation method since solving algebraically could be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of simple interest, but I don't think that's accurate here because the payments are spread out over time, so each payment reduces the principal.

Wait, maybe another approach: calculate the total interest paid and then find the effective interest rate based on the initial amount.

Wait, the total amount paid is $42.20, and the price is $39.90, so the interest is $42.20 - $39.90 = $2.30. But that's over a year, so the interest rate would be (2.30 / 39.90) * 100. Let me compute that: 2.3 /39.9 is approximately 0.0576, so 5.76%. But wait, that's the simple interest rate, but since the payments are made monthly, maybe the effective rate is higher because each payment reduces the principal.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of the installment plan as a loan where the present value is $39.90, and the payments are $3.10 per month for 12 months, with a down payment of $5. So the loan amount would be $39.90 - $5 = $34.90. So the present value of the 12 monthly payments should equal $34.90.

So the equation becomes: 34.90 = 3.10 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]

I can rearrange this equation to solve for r. Let me call the monthly rate i. So,

34.90 = 3.10 * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i ]

Divide both sides by 3.10: 34.90 / 3.10 = [ (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i ]

Calculating 34.90 / 3.10: 34.9 / 3.1 = 11.258... So 11.258 ≈ [ (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i ]

So now I need to solve for i in the equation: (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i = 11.258.

This seems like it's going to require some iteration because I can't solve it algebraically easily. Let me try plugging in different interest rates to see which one gets me close to 11.258.

Let me start with a guess. Let's try i=1% per month.

(1 - (1.01)^-12 ) / 0.01 = (1 - 1/1.012196) ≈ (1 - 0.8874) / 0.01 = 0.1126 / 0.01 = 11.26.

Oh, wait, that's really close to 11.258. So i is approximately 1% per month. So the monthly rate is 1%, which would make the annual rate 12% (1% * 12). But wait, that's the simple annual rate. However, the effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.01)^12 - 1 ≈ 12.68%. Hmm, but the options don't have 12.68%. Looking back at the options, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are A:14%, B:17.5%, C:10%, D:15%, E:19.8%, F:20%, G:5%, H:8%, I:12.2%, J:25%.

Wait, I:12.2% is there. But according to my calculation, the effective rate would be around 12.68%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the nominal annual rate, which would be 12% (1% per month). But 12% isn't an option either. Hmm, option I is 12.2%, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me compute (1 - (1.01)^-12)/0.01.

(1.01)^12 is approximately 1.126825. So (1 - 1/1.126825) = 1 - 0.887449 = 0.112551. Dividing by 0.01 gives 11.2551, which is about 11.255. So the present value factor is 11.255, which when multiplied by 3.10 gives 34.90 (3.10*11.255=34.90). So that's correct. So the monthly rate is 1%, which gives an effective annual rate of approximately 12.68%. But none of the options match exactly. Wait, maybe the question expects the nominal rate, which is 12% annual, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the exact monthly rate is slightly more than 1%. Because when I tried i=1%, the factor was 11.255, which is a bit higher than 11.258. Wait no, the calculated factor was 11.2551, which is a bit less than 11.258. So perhaps the rate is a little higher than 1% per month.

Let me try i=1.005% (0.1005 in decimal). Let's compute (1 - (1.01005)^-12 ) / 0.01005.

First, compute 1.01005^12. Let me approximate this step by step. Maybe using logarithms or a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a financial calculator approach, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try i=1% gives a factor of 11.2551, which is a bit less than 11.258. The target is 11.258, so to get a slightly higher factor, the rate would have to be a bit lower than 1% because a lower rate increases the present value factor. Wait, actually, higher interest rates decrease the present value factor. So if the factor is 11.2551 at 1%, which is a bit lower than 11.258, I need a slightly lower rate to get a higher factor. Because as the rate decreases, the (1/(1+i)^n) term increases, leading to a higher numerator and thus a higher factor.

Wait, wait, let me correct that. The present value factor increases when the interest rate decreases. So if at i=1%, the factor is 11.2551, but we need 11.258, which is a bit higher. So I need a slightly lower interest rate.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because when the interest rate is lower, the factor increases. So if i is 1%, factor is 11.2551. To get 11.258, which is a bit higher, I need a slightly lower i.

So perhaps i=0.99% per month.

Let me try i=0.99%: 0.0099 as the decimal.

Compute (1 - (1.0099)^-12 ) / 0.0099.

First, compute 1.0099^12. Let me compute step by step.

1.0099^1 = 1.0099

^2 = 1.0099 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0198

^3 ≈ 1.0198 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0297

^4 ≈ 1.0297 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0396

^5 ≈ 1.0396 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0495

^6 ≈ 1.0495 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0594

^7 ≈ 1.0594 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0693

^8 ≈ 1.0693 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0793

^9 ≈ 1.0793 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0893

^10 ≈ 1.0893 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.0993

^11 ≈ 1.0993 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.1093

^12 ≈ 1.1093 * 1.0099 ≈ 1.1192

So (1.0099)^12 ≈ 1.1192. So 1/(1.0099)^12 ≈ 0.8923.

So (1 - 0.8923) = 0.1077.

Divide by 0.0099: 0.1077 / 0.0099 ≈ 10.8788.

Wait, that's lower than 11.2551, which can't be right because a lower i should give a higher factor. Hmm, maybe my approximation for (1.0099)^12 is way off. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the present value factor more accurately. Let me try a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps use the Newton-Raphson method to solve for i.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that at i=1%, the factor is 11.255, which is just slightly below 11.258. So the exact i is very close to 1%, so the annual rate would be approximately 12.68% effective, but perhaps the question expects the nominal rate of 12%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the simple interest method, but then the rate would be lower.

Wait, maybe I should compute the effective rate correctly. Because if the monthly rate is 1%, then the effective annual rate is (1 + 0.01)^12 -1 ≈ 0.126825, which is 12.68%. But since this is one of the options, I don't see it. The closest is I:12.2%. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the APR, which is 12% (1% per month *12), but that's the nominal rate, not the effective rate. However, perhaps the question is just asking for the nominal annual rate, which would be 12%, but that's not an option. Wait, option I is 12.2%, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should calculate the interest as the total paid minus the price, then find the rate based on the average outstanding balance.

The total paid is $42.20, price is $39.90, so interest is $2.30. The average outstanding balance would be (initial balance + final balance)/2. The initial balance is $39.90 - $5 = $34.90. Each month, the balance reduces by $3.10. Wait, but the payments include both principal and interest, so the balance reduces over time.

Alternatively, perhaps using the simple interest formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time.

But here, the principal is $34.90, time is 1 year, so Rate = Interest / (Principal * Time) = 2.30 / (34.90 * 1) ≈ 0.0658 or 6.58%. But that doesn't match any of the options either.

Hmm, I must be missing something. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the internal rate of return of the payments, which is what I did earlier. But then the effective rate is around 12.68%, which isn't an option. Wait, looking back, option I is 12.2%, which is close. Maybe the exact calculation gives 12.2%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the present value calculation. Let me try using a more precise method.

I can set up the equation again: 5 + 3.10 * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i ] = 39.90.

So 3.10 * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i ] = 34.90.

Divide both sides by 3.10: [ (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i ] = 34.90 / 3.10 = 11.2580645.

So we're looking for i such that (1 - v^12)/i = 11.2580645, where v = 1/(1+i).

This is a bit tricky without a calculator, but perhaps I can use trial and error.

Let me try i=0.0075 (0.75% per month):

v = 1/(1.0075) ≈ 0.99254.

v^12 ≈ (0.99254)^12 ≈ let's compute step by step.

0.99254^2 ≈ 0.98518.

^4: (0.98518)^2 ≈ 0.97056.

^8: (0.97056)^2 ≈ 0.94168.

Now, 0.94168 * 0.99254^4 ≈ 0.94168 * 0.97056 ≈ 0.9133.

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 0.99254^12.

Alternatively, using the rule of 72 or logarithms, but perhaps it's easier to approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for present value factor.

But maybe another approach: The present value factor at i=0.75% is [1 - (1.0075)^-12 ] / 0.0075.

Compute 1.0075^12:

(1.0075)^12 ≈ e^(12 * ln(1.0075)).

ln(1.0075) ≈ 0.007472906.

12 * 0.007472906 ≈ 0.0896748.

e^0.0896748 ≈ 1.0937.

So (1.0075)^12 ≈ 1.0937.

So 1/(1.0075)^12 ≈ 0.9130.

So [1 - 0.9130]/0.0075 = (0.087)/0.0075 ≈ 11.6.

Which is higher than 11.258. So the factor is 11.6 at 0.75% per month. But we need it to be 11.258, which is lower. So to get a lower factor, we need a higher interest rate because higher i reduces the present value factor.

So let's try i=0.8% per month.

v=1/(1.008) ≈ 0.99203.

Compute v^12: (0.99203)^12.

Again, using logarithms: ln(0.99203) ≈ -0.00797.

12 * (-0.00797) ≈ -0.09564.

e^-0.09564 ≈ 0.9089.

So 1/(1.008)^12 ≈ 0.9089.

[1 - 0.9089]/0.008 = 0.0911 / 0.008 ≈ 11.375.

Still higher than 11.258. So we need a higher i.

Try i=0.85% per month.

v=1/1.0085 ≈ 0.99154.

Compute v^12: (0.99154)^12.

ln(0.99154) ≈ -0.00847.

12 * (-0.00847) ≈ -0.10164.

e^-0.10164 ≈ 0.9038.

So 1/(1.0085)^12 ≈ 0.9038.

[1 - 0.9038]/0.0085 = 0.0962 / 0.0085 ≈ 11.329.

Wait, that's higher than 11.258. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, if i increases, the denominator increases, and the numerator (1 - v^12) increases as v decreases, so the overall factor [ (1 - v^12)/i ] should decrease as i increases. Wait, but in my previous step, when i increased from 0.75% to 0.8%, the factor decreased from 11.6 to 11.375, which makes sense. So as i increases, the factor decreases.

So at i=0.8%, factor is 11.375.

We need it to be 11.258, which is lower than 11.375, so we need a higher i.

Let me try i=0.85% gave a higher factor than expected. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, when i=0.85%, the numerator is 1 - 0.9038 = 0.0962, divided by
