Question:

What external strategies do elites employ?

Options:

A: Elites may also use economic strategies, such as the manipulation of currency or the imposition of sanctions, to maintain their power and control.
B: An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.
C: Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.
D: An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the external strategies that elites employ. Let's see, the question is asking which option correctly describes such strategies. The options are A through D, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll try to understand each option one by one.

Option A says, "Elites may also use economic strategies, such as the manipulation of currency or the imposition of sanctions, to maintain their power and control." Hmm, so this is talking about economic methods. I know that sanctions are often imposed by powerful countries on others, but do elites within a country use manipulation of currency? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure if this is an external strategy. Currency manipulation could affect internal economies, but sanctions can be an external tool used against other countries. I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

Option B: "An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats." Wait, this is about weak states using private military companies. So, this would be more of an internal security measure, using external forces. But the question is about external strategies that elites employ. Hmm, maybe this is external because they're bringing in foreign mercenaries, but I'm not certain if that's considered an external strategy. It might be more of a hybrid approach.

Option C: "Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met." So, this is about avoiding alliances. Elites in weak states might avoid forming alliances with stronger states because the stronger states might demand reforms or democratization. That makes sense as an external strategy because it's about how the weak state interacts with other countries. But I'm not sure if this is the strategy elites use to maintain power. It's more about avoiding external pressures, but does it help them maintain control? Maybe, because they avoid external interference that could threaten their regime.

Option D: "An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants." This sounds like a strategy where elites restrict movement and expel certain groups. That seems more like an internal strategy, controlling who is in the country. It's about domestic policies rather than external actions. So probably not the answer.

Now, thinking about what external strategies mean. External strategies would involve actions taken outside the state's borders or interactions with other states. So, for elites, what do they do externally to maintain power?

Option B talks about using foreign mercenaries. That's bringing in external resources to help with internal security, so it's an external strategy because they're engaging with foreign entities. Option A is about economic measures like sanctions or currency manipulation. Sanctions are usually imposed externally, but elites using them might be more about affecting other countries, not sure if that's the case here.

Option C is about avoiding alliances to prevent external pressures. That's an external strategy because it's about how they relate to other states. So, elites in weak states might avoid alliances with powerful states to prevent having to make democratic reforms, which could threaten their power.

Wait, the question is about external strategies that elites employ, not necessarily the state's strategies. So, do elites use alliances or avoid them? If they avoid alliances, that's a strategy to maintain their power by not getting entangled with stronger states that might impose conditions.

Alternatively, Option B is about using foreign military help, which is an external strategy because it's about engaging with other countries or companies. So, using private military companies from abroad would be an external strategy.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

External strategies for elites would involve actions beyond their borders. So, if they employ foreign mercenaries, that's engaging external resources. Similarly, imposing sanctions would be an external action, but that's typically something done by a powerful state against another, not sure if elites in a weak state would impose sanctions on others.

Option C is more about not engaging with powerful states, which is a passive external strategy. So, the elites avoid alliances to prevent external interference that could lead to democratization, which would threaten their power.

So, which options are correct?

The question is about what external strategies do elites employ. So, looking for actions that involve interacting with other states or entities outside their own.

Option B: Using foreign mercenaries is an external strategy because they're bringing in external forces. Option C is about avoiding alliances, which is also an external strategy related to foreign policy.

So, now I'm a bit stuck between B and C.

Wait, the question is phrased as "what external strategies do elites employ?" So, the possible answers could be any of these.

Looking back, I think Option B is more about internal security using external resources, so it's a mix. Option C is about foreign policy choices, which are definitely external.

I'm more inclined towards Option C being correct because it's about how they interact with other states on a strategic level to maintain their power. Avoiding alliances prevents external pressures that could force changes in their regime.

Alternatively, Option A is about economic strategies. If elites manipulate currency or impose sanctions, that's an external economic strategy. But usually, sanctions are imposed by stronger states on weaker ones, not the other way around. So, maybe A isn't the right answer.

In that case, I think the correct answer is B or C. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another angle: the question is about external strategies that elites employ. So, if they're using foreign mercenaries, that's an external strategy because they're relying on external actors. So, B would be correct in that sense.

Alternatively, avoiding alliances (C) is also an external strategy but more about non-action.

I think the more direct external strategy is B, where they are actively engaging with external entities to bolster their internal security. So, employing foreign mercenaries is an external strategy.

Wait, but the question says "external strategies", so using foreign military companies would be an external action. So, Option B is correct.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another thought: sometimes, weak states might align with powerful ones for protection, but the option C says they avoid alliances because of conditions. So, maybe that's a strategy to maintain their internal power by avoiding external interference.

I think I'm going to go with Option B as the answer, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps Option C is correct because avoiding alliances is a strategic choice in their foreign policy to maintain their regime's security.

Wait, the question is from a political science or international relations perspective. I remember that in some cases, authoritarian regimes avoid alliances with democratic states to prevent pressure for democratization. So, Option C makes sense as an external strategy.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of each option again.

Option B: Using private military companies as force multipliers. So, this is about security, using external resources to deal with internal threats. It's an external strategy because they're engaging with foreign entities.

Option C: Avoiding alliances with powerful states to prevent conditions that might lead to democratization. This is a foreign policy strategy, so definitely external.

So, both B and C are external strategies, but the question is which one is correct.

The question is about what EXTERNAL strategies do elites employ. So, perhaps both B and C could be correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, the options are A through D, so I have to choose which one is correct.

I think the correct answer is B: An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.

Because this is about using external resources (foreign companies and mercenaries) to deal with internal issues, which is an external strategy.

Alternatively, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is A, but I think it's more about economic strategies, which might not be the primary external strategy for maintaining power.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is B.

But now I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the terminology. External strategies would involve actions taken outside the state's borders or interactions with other states. So, using foreign mercenaries is an external action because it's involving other countries' entities. Avoiding alliances is also external, as it's about foreign relations.

So, both B and C involve external strategies, but the question is asking which one is correct.

Perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, the question is phrased as "external strategies do elites employ?" So, looking at each option:

A: Economic strategies like manipulating currency or imposing sanctions. Typically, sanctions are imposed by stronger states, but maybe elites in a country could impose sanctions on others. Not sure.

B: Using foreign mercenaries to secure the state. This is about bringing in external help, which is an external strategy.

C: Avoiding alliances to prevent democratization pressures. Also an external strategy.

D: Expelling foreigners and restricting borders. That's more of an internal strategy.

So, the question is, which of these is an external strategy.

Between B and C.

I think the answer is B because it's about actively engaging with external actors (mercenaries) to bolster their position. C is about not engaging, which is a passive strategy.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, another angle: the question is about ELITES employing strategies. So, if a weak state is using foreign mercenaries, it's the state's action, which is controlled by the elites. So, Option B would be correct.

Alternatively, Option C is about the state avoiding alliances, which is also an elite decision.

I'm going to have to make a choice. I think the answer is B.
</think>

The question asks about external strategies that elites employ, with options A through D provided. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed in detail:

- **Option A** discusses economic strategies like currency manipulation or sanctions. While sanctions are typically imposed by powerful states, it's unclear if elites in weak states would use such measures. This option seems less relevant to the context of external strategies for maintaining power.

- **Option B** highlights the use of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers. This is an external strategy because it involves engaging with foreign entities to bolster internal security. It is a direct and active external strategy.

- **Option C** focuses on avoiding alliances with powerful states to prevent democratization pressures. This is also an external strategy, as it involves foreign policy decisions. However, it is more of a passive strategy compared to actively engaging with external actors.

- **Option D** involves expelling foreign workers and restricting borders, which is more of an internal strategy focused on domestic control rather than external interactions.

Between **Option B** and **Option C**, both involve external strategies, but **Option B** stands out as it describes an active engagement with external resources (foreign mercenaries) to maintain power. While **Option C** is also valid, it is more about avoiding external pressures rather than actively employing external strategies.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B**
