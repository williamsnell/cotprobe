Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about Rune Co.'s cash balance on December 31. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that Rune Co.'s checkbook balance on December 31 was $10,000. That's the balance they have in their checkbook, so that's the amount they think they have in the bank, right? But then there are two items in the safe that I need to consider.

The first item is a $4,000 check payable to Rune, postdated January 3. It's not included in the December 31 checkbook balance because it's a postdated check, meaning it's dated after December 31. So, since the check is from a customer but isn't valid until January, it's in the safe but not part of the cash Rune can use yet. So I don't think this affects the December 31 cash balance because it's not deposited yet, and since it's postdated, it wouldn't be considered cash on Dec 31. So maybe this $4,000 isn't added to the checkbook balance yet.

The second item is a $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15 and was included in the December 31 checkbook balance. But the bank returned it on December 30 as NSF (not sufficient funds). Oh, okay, so this check was deposited, so initially, it increased the checkbook balance. But then the bank returned it, which means the bank took that $1,000 back out. So as of December 30, the bank has already debited this amount, meaning the bank balance would have gone down by $1,000. But wait, the check was in the December 31 checkbook balance, so perhaps Rune's checkbook still shows it as a deposit, but the bank has already returned it. So this might mean that the checkbook balance is higher than the actual bank balance because of this NSF check.

Wait, but the problem says it was included in the December 31 checkbook balance but was returned on December 30. Hmm, so the check was deposited and added to the checkbook, but the bank processing found it NSF and returned it before December 31. So in the checkbook, the balance includes this $1,000, but in reality, the bank has already taken it out. So the checkbook balance is $10,000, but the actual cash is less by $1,000 because that check bounced.

But wait, the check was redeposited on January 2. So after December 31, they redeposit it, and it clears on January 9. But that's after the balance sheet date, so it doesn't affect December 31. So for December 31, that $1,000 is bad and should be subtracted from the cash because it's not valid.

So the checkbook balance is $10,000, but the actual cash should adjust for the NSF check. Also, the postdated check isn't part of cash yet because it's dated in January. So how does that affect the cash reported on the balance sheet?

Wait, the balance sheet is as of December 31, so we need to report cash as of that date. Cash in the bank would be the checkbook balance adjusted for any items not yet processed by the bank.

Wait, no. Normally, the checkbook balance is the company's record, and the bank statement may have differences. But in this case, the bank has already processed the NSF check by December 30, so the bank balance is lower than the checkbook by $1,000. So the correct cash balance should be the checkbook balance minus the NSF check, because that check isn't valid anymore.

So the checkbook balance is $10,000, but because the $1,000 check was returned, the actual cash is $9,000. Then, the $4,000 postdated check is sitting in the safe as of December 31 but isn't considered cash yet, so it's not added to the cash balance. So the total cash should be $9,000.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the two items are:

1. $4,000 postdated check (Jan 3) in the safe. Not included in checkbook. So since it's not deposited, it's not part of cash on Dec 31. So it's just an asset, maybe a note receivable, but not cash.

2. $1,000 check deposited on Dec 15, included in checkbook, but NSF and returned on Dec 30. So the checkbook shows it as a deposit, so the checkbook balance includes it, but the bank has already taken it out because it's NSF. So the bank balance is $10,000 minus $1,000, which is $9,000. Therefore, the cash in the bank is $9,000.

Plus, any cash on hand. The problem says that the items in the safe are these two checks. The $4k is a postdated check, so it's not cash yet. The $1k is in the safe, but it's NSF, so it's not valid. Therefore, the cash in the safe is zero for these items because one is invalid and the other isn't cash yet.

Wait, but wait. The $1k check was returned by the bank on Dec 30, so as of Dec 31, the bank balance is $9k, right? Because the bank has already taken out the $1k. So in the balance sheet, cash would be the bank balance of $9k, plus any other cash on hand.

Wait, but the question says that the check was redeposited on Jan 2. So on Dec 31, the $1k check is in the safe again, because it was returned and then redeposited after December 31. So, does that mean that on Dec 31, the check is back in the safe, so it's counted as cash?

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to outline each item:

1. $4,000 postdated check (dated Jan 3) received in December. It's in the safe on Dec 31. Since it's postdated, it's not deposited yet, so it's not considered cash as of Dec 31. So it's a receivable, but not cash.

2. $1,000 check deposited on Dec 15. It was included in the checkbook, so the checkbook balance went up by $1k. But the bank returned it on Dec 30 as NSF. So the bank would have reduced the bank balance by $1k on Dec 30, making the bank balance $9k. The check was then redeposited on Jan 2, which is after Dec 31. So as of Dec 31, the check is back in the possession of Rune Co., in their safe. So does this $1k check count as cash on Dec 31?

Wait, the initial deposit was made on Dec 15, and the check was returned on Dec 30. So on Dec 30, the bank takes back the $1k, so the bank balance goes down. But then, the check is redeposited on Jan 2. So as of Dec 31, where is the check? It was returned, so Rune Co. would have it in their safe again. So on Dec 31, the check is in the safe. But since it's an NSF check, it's not valid, so it's not considered cash.

Wait, but if the check is in the safe on Dec 31, does that mean it's part of the cash on hand? Or is it considered a deposit in transit or something else?

Wait, no, because the check was deposited, then returned, so it's no longer in the bank. So on Dec 31, the check is back with Rune Co. But since it's an NSF check, it's not a valid check. So it doesn't count as cash because it's not a good instrument. So the cash in the safe would not include this $1k.

Wait, but the problem says that the check was redeposited on Jan 2. So perhaps on Dec 31, the check is in the safe, but it's not yet redeposited. So as of Dec 31, the check is in the possession of Rune Co., but it's an NSF check. So it's not cash, right?

So, the cash in the bank is $9k because the bank took back the $1k. The cash in the safe would be the $4k postdated check, which isn't cash yet, and the $1k check, which isn't valid. So the total cash is just the bank balance of $9k.

Wait, but wait: The check was returned on Dec 30, so the bank adjusted it. The checkbook balance was $10k, but the bank's balance is $9k. So the correct cash balance as per the bank is $9k. Plus, any cash on hand, but in this case, the only items in the safe are the two checks, which aren't cash.

So the total cash reported on the balance sheet should be $9,000.

Looking at the options, option F is $9,000. So the answer should be F.

To determine the amount Rune Co. should report as cash on its December 31 balance sheet, we need to analyze the two items in the safe and their impact on the cash balance:

1. **$4,000 Postdated Check (January 3):**  
   This check is dated January 3 and was not included in the December 31 checkbook balance. Since it is postdated, it is not considered cash as of December 31. It remains in the safe as a receivable but does not affect the cash balance.

2. **$1,000 Check Deposited December 15:**  
   This check was deposited on December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance. However, it was returned by the bank on December 30 as "NSF" (not sufficient funds). As a result, the bank reduced the cash balance by $1,000 on December 30. Although the check was redeposited on January 2, this occurred after December 31 and does not affect the December 31 cash balance. As of December 31, the check is back in the safe, but since it is NSF, it is not considered valid and therefore not included in cash.

The checkbook balance as of December 31 is $10,000, but the bank has already adjusted for the NSF check, reducing the cash balance to $9,000. The $4,000 postdated check and the $1,000 NSF check in the safe do not qualify as cash on December 31. Therefore, the cash reported on the balance sheet should be $9,000.

**Answer: F**
