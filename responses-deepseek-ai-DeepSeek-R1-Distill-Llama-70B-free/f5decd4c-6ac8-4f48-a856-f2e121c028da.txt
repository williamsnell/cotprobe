Okay, so I've got this question about the moons of Mars. Hmm, I remember that Mars has two moons, but I'm a bit fuzzy on their names. Let me try to recall.

Wait, I think one of them starts with a 'P'. Oh right, Phobos! Yeah, that rings a bell. I remember it's a small moon, and the name Phobos comes from Greek mythology, I think. Phobos was one of the sons of Ares, who's the Greek god of war. Since Mars is the Roman god of war, it makes sense they'd use names from that mythology.

And the other moon... I'm pretty sure it starts with a 'D'. Deimos, maybe? Oh yes, Deimos. So the two moons are Phobos and Deimos. I've heard that Deimos is the outer moon, and Phobos is closer to Mars. They were discovered in the late 19th century, I believe.

Let me look at the options now. Option A: Deimos and Triton. Wait, Triton is Neptune's moon, right? So that's not correct. Option B: Phobos and Demos. Demos doesn't sound familiar. Oh wait, Demos is an asteroid, I think. Not a moon of Mars. So B is wrong.

Option C: Triton and Deimos. Again, Triton is Neptune's, so no. Option D: Phobos and Deimos. That matches what I was thinking. Option E: Tritos and Desmos. Doesn't ring a bell. F: Phobos and Mars II. Mars II might be a designation, but I don't think that's the official name. G: Phobos and Tritos. No, that's mixing up with Neptune again. H: Phobos and Triton. Still wrong because of Triton. I: Tritos and Deimos. Wrong again. J: Deimos and Mars I. Mars I isn't the name of the moon.

So the correct answer must be D: Phobos and Deimos.

The two moons of Mars are Phobos and Deimos. These names originate from Greek mythology, with Phobos (meaning "fear" or "panic") and Deimos ("dread") being the sons of Ares, the Greek god of war. Mars, being the Roman equivalent of Ares, appropriately has moons named after these mythological figures. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Incorrect, as Triton is a moon of Neptune.
- **B**: Incorrect, as Demos refers to an asteroid, not a moon of Mars.
- **C**: Incorrect, as Triton is not associated with Mars.
- **D**: Correct, as Phobos and Deimos are the actual names of Mars' moons.
- **E-J**: All incorrect due to misattribution or incorrect naming.

Thus, the correct answer is **D: Phobos and Deimos**.
