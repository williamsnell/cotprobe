Question:

A survey shows that a mayoral candidate is gaining votes at a rate of 2000t + 1000 votes per day, where t is the number of days since she announced her candidacy. How many supporters will the candidate have after 60 days, assuming that she had no supporters at t = 0?

A: 6000000
B: 3000000
C: 120000
D: 4200000

F: 3200000
G: 1800000
H: 4000000
I: 3660000
J: 6600000

Okay, so I have this math problem here about a mayoral candidate gaining votes over time. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says that the candidate's votes are increasing at a rate of 2000t + 1000 votes per day. So, t is the number of days since she announced. The question is asking how many supporters she'll have after 60 days, assuming she started with none.

Wait, so this is like a rate problem. I remember that when something is changing at a certain rate over time, you can find the total by integrating the rate over that time period. Oh right, because integration gives the accumulation of a rate.

The rate here is given by 2000t + 1000. So to find the total votes after 60 days, I need to integrate this function from t=0 to t=60. 

Let me write that down. The integral of (2000t + 1000) dt from 0 to 60. The integral of 2000t is 2000*(t²/2), which is 1000t². And the integral of 1000 is 1000t. So putting it together, the integral is 1000t² + 1000t, evaluated from 0 to 60.

Now plugging in t=60: 1000*(60)^2 + 1000*(60). Let's compute each part. 60 squared is 3600, so 1000*3600 is 3,600,000. Then 1000*60 is 60,000. Adding them together gives 3,600,000 + 60,000 = 3,660,000.

Wait a second, but looking at the options, option I is 3,660,000. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way, without calculus. Because the rate is 2000t + 1000. So each day's votes increase by that amount. So the total votes after 60 days would be the sum of each day's votes from day 1 to day 60.

The formula for the sum of 2000t + 1000 from t=1 to t=60 is the same as the integral approach, right? Because each day adds that amount. So the sum would be sum(2000t) + sum(1000) from t=1 to 60.

Sum(2000t) from t=1 to n is 2000*(n(n+1)/2). Sum(1000) from t=1 to n is 1000*n. So for n=60, that becomes 2000*(60*61)/2 + 1000*60.

Calculating that: 2000*(3660/2) = 2000*1830 = 3,660,000. Then 1000*60 is 60,000. Adding them gives the same result, 3,660,000. So that confirms it.

Wait, but looking back, the initial condition says she had no supporters at t=0. So t=0 implies day 0, which is before day 1. So the calculation from 0 to 60 includes t=0, but at t=0, the votes would be 0 because she had no supporters. So integrating from 0 to 60 is correct.

Wait, but in the first method, the integral from 0 to 60 gives the area under the curve, which is the total accumulated votes. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be 3,660,000, which is option I.

To determine how many supporters the mayoral candidate will have after 60 days, we start with the given rate of votes per day: 

\[
\text{Rate} = 2000t + 1000
\]

where \( t \) is the number of days since the candidacy was announced. Since the candidate had no supporters at \( t = 0 \), the total number of supporters after 60 days is the accumulation of votes over this period. This requires integrating the rate function over time:

\[
\text{Total Votes} = \int_0^{60} (2000t + 1000) \, dt
\]

The integral of \( 2000t \) is \( 1000t^2 \), and the integral of \( 1000 \) is \( 1000t \). Thus, the total votes are:

\[
\text{Total Votes} = \left[ 1000t^2 + 1000t \right]_0^{60}
\]

Substituting \( t = 60 \):

\[
1000(60)^2 + 1000(60) = 1000(3600) + 1000(60) = 3,600,000 + 60,000 = 3,660,000
\]

This calculation confirms that the candidate will have 3,660,000 supporters after 60 days. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**I: 3,660,000**
