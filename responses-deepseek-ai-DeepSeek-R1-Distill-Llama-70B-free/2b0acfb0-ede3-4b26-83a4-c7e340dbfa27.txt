Okay, so I've got this problem about brine flowing into a tank and stuff. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember this is a mixing problem, probably involving differential equations. 

So, the setup: Brine with 20% salt by mass is flowing into a well-stirred tank at 20 kg/min. The tank initially has 1000 kg of brine with 10% salt. The solution leaves at 10 kg/min. I need to find the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time theta.

Wait, wait. First, I should note the rates. The inflow is 20 kg/min, and the outflow is 10 kg/min. So the net change in the mass of the brine in the tank is inflow minus outflow. That would be 20 -10 = +10 kg/min. So the mass in the tank increases over time. Oh right, initially it's 1000 kg, so after time theta, the mass M(theta) would be 1000 + 10*theta kg. That's important because the concentration depends on the total mass.

Now, the concentration of salt in the inflow is 20%, so 0.2 kg salt per kg brine. The initial concentration is 10%, so initially there's 1000 kg * 0.10 = 100 kg of salt in the tank.

The solution leaves at 10 kg/min, so the concentration of salt in the outflow will depend on the current concentration in the tank at time theta. Let's denote S(theta) as the amount of salt in the tank at time theta. Then, the concentration in the tank is S(theta)/M(theta), and the outflow rate of salt is (S(theta)/M(theta)) * (outflow rate) = (S(theta)/M(theta)) *10 kg/min.

So the rate of change of salt in the tank is:

dS/d(theta) = (inflow salt rate) - (outflow salt rate)

The inflow salt rate is 20 kg/min * 20% = 4 kg/min.

The outflow salt rate is (10 kg/min) * (S(theta)/M(theta)).

So putting it together:

dS/d(theta) = 4 - [10 * S(theta) / M(theta)]

But M(theta) is 1000 + 10 theta, as I found earlier.

So substituting M(theta):

dS/d(theta) = 4 - [10 S(theta) / (1000 +10 theta)]

Hmm, this looks like a linear differential equation. I can write it as:

dS/d(theta) + [10/(1000 +10 theta)] S(theta) =4

Alternatively, simplifying the denominator:

[10/(10(100 + theta))] = 1/(100 + theta)

So the equation becomes:

dS/d(theta) + [1/(100 + theta)] S(theta) =4

This is a first-order linear ODE, so I can use an integrating factor.

The standard form is dy/dt + P(t) y = Q(t)

So here, P(theta) =1/(100 + theta), Q(theta)=4.

The integrating factor mu(theta) is exp( ∫ P(theta) d theta )

So ∫ [1/(100 + theta)] d theta = ln(100 + theta)

So mu(theta) = exp(ln(100 + theta)) = 100 + theta

Multiply both sides by mu(theta):

(100 + theta) dS/d(theta) + (100 + theta)*(1/(100 + theta)) S =4*(100 + theta)

Simplify:

(100 + theta) dS/d(theta) + S =4(100 + theta)

The left side is the derivative of [ (100 + theta) S ] with respect to theta.

So:

d/d(theta) [ (100 + theta) S ] =4(100 + theta)

Integrate both sides:

(100 + theta) S = ∫4(100 + theta) d theta + C

Compute the integral:

Let u =100 + theta, du = d theta.

∫4u du =4*(u²/2) + C = 2u² + C

So:

(100 + theta) S = 2(100 + theta)^2 + C

Solve for S:

S(theta) = [2(100 + theta)^2 + C ] / (100 + theta)

Simplify:

S(theta) = 2(100 + theta) + C/(100 + theta)

Now apply initial condition. At theta=0, S(0)=100 kg.

So:

100 = 2*(100 +0) + C/(100+0)

100= 200 + C/100

C/100 = 100-200= -100

So C= -100 *100= -10,000

Thus, S(theta)= 2(100 + theta) -10,000/(100 + theta)

Hmm, let me compute that.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the integration step.

Wait, when I integrated 4(100+theta) d theta, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me redo that integral.

Wait, ∫4(100 + theta) d theta.

Let u =100 + theta, du=1 d theta.

So ∫4u du = 4*(u^2/2) + C = 2 u^2 + C = 2(100 + theta)^2 + C.

So that part was correct.

So S(theta)= [2(100 + theta)^2 -10,000 ]/(100 + theta )

Let me expand numerator:

2( (100 + theta)^2 ) = 2*(10000 + 200 theta + theta^2 )= 20000 +400 theta + 2 theta^2

So numerator is 20000 +400 theta +2 theta^2 -10,000 = 10000 +400 theta +2 theta^2

So numerator is 2 theta^2 +400 theta +10000

Denominator is 100 + theta.

So S(theta)= (2 theta^2 +400 theta +10000 )/(100 + theta )

Looking at the options, option J is S = [(2θ² +400θ +10000)/(100 + θ)], which matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option J: S = [(2θ² +400θ +10000)/(100 + θ)]

Yes, that's correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the mixing process in the tank. The inflow rate of brine is 20 kg/min with 20% salt, and the outflow rate is 10 kg/min. The tank initially contains 1000 kg of brine with 10% salt, so the initial amount of salt is \( S(0) = 100 \, \text{kg} \). The total mass of brine in the tank at time \( \theta \) is \( M(\theta) = 1000 + 10\theta \), since the net mass increase rate is \( 20 - 10 = 10 \, \text{kg/min} \).

The rate of change of salt in the tank is given by:

\[
\frac{dS}{d\theta} = \text{inflow rate of salt} - \text{outflow rate of salt}.
\]

The inflow rate of salt is \( 20 \, \text{kg/min} \times 0.2 = 4 \, \text{kg/min} \). The outflow rate of salt is proportional to the concentration of salt in the tank, which is \( \frac{S(\theta)}{M(\theta)} \), multiplied by the outflow rate of brine, \( 10 \, \text{kg/min} \). Thus, the outflow rate of salt is \( \frac{10S(\theta)}{M(\theta)} \).

Substituting \( M(\theta) = 1000 + 10\theta \), the differential equation becomes:

\[
\frac{dS}{d\theta} = 4 - \frac{10S(\theta)}{1000 + 10\theta}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{dS}{d\theta} + \frac{S(\theta)}{100 + \theta} = 4.
\]

This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). The integrating factor is:

\[
\mu(\theta) = \exp\left(\int \frac{1}{100 + \theta} \, d\theta\right) = 100 + \theta.
\]

Multiplying through by the integrating factor:

\[
(100 + \theta) \frac{dS}{d\theta} + S(\theta) = 4(100 + \theta).
\]

The left-hand side is the derivative of \( (100 + \theta)S(\theta) \), so:

\[
\frac{d}{d\theta} \left[ (100 + \theta)S(\theta) \right] = 4(100 + \theta).
\]

Integrating both sides:

\[
(100 + \theta)S(\theta) = \int 4(100 + \theta) \, d\theta.
\]

Expanding the integral:

\[
\int 4(100 + \theta) \, d\theta = 4 \int (100 + \theta) \, d\theta = 4 \left[ 100\theta + \frac{\theta^2}{2} \right] + C,
\]

where \( C \) is the constant of integration. Simplifying:

\[
(100 + \theta)S(\theta) = 400\theta + 2\theta^2 + C.
\]

Solving for \( S(\theta) \):

\[
S(\theta) = \frac{2\theta^2 + 400\theta + C}{100 + \theta}.
\]

Applying the initial condition \( S(0) = 100 \, \text{kg} \):

\[
100 = \frac{2(0)^2 + 400(0) + C}{100 + 0}.
\]

This gives \( C = 10,000 \). Substituting \( C \) back:

\[
S(\theta) = \frac{2\theta^2 + 400\theta + 10,000}{100 + \theta}.
\]

Thus, the expression for the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time is:

\[
S(\theta) = \frac{2\theta^2 + 400\theta + 10,000}{100 + \theta}.
\]

Comparing with the options, this matches **Option J**.
