Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, the problem is about a container with a piston. The container has an area of 1 square foot and a volume of 5 cubic feet. It holds 2 cubic feet of an ideal gas initially at a pressure of 10 atmospheres. There's a piston weighing 1440 pounds that's being held in place by an external force. The container is open to the atmosphere, which is at 1 atm. The setup is such that when the external force is released, the piston rises without friction. Also, the gas is kept at the same temperature throughout. The questions are about finding the velocity of the piston as it moves and the total vertical displacement it reaches. The options are given from A to J.

Okay, starting with part a), the velocity of the piston. I think this is a problem involving the balance of forces and pressure. Since the gas is ideal and the temperature is constant, it's an isothermal process.

So initially, the gas is at 10 atm, but when the piston moves, it'll expand, right? Because the external force is removed, the piston will rise, allowing the gas to expand until the internal pressure equals the external pressure, which is 1 atm. But wait, the piston's weight might also affect the pressure. Hmm.

Wait, the container is open to the atmosphere, so the external pressure is atmospheric pressure (1 atm). When the external force is released, the piston will move until the pressure inside equals the atmospheric pressure. But the piston's weight affects the pressure as well. So the final pressure inside will be the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the piston's weight.

Wait, no. Because the piston is subject to the gas pressure from below and atmospheric pressure from above. Since it's open, the pressure above is 1 atm. So the gas inside must push with enough force to support the piston's weight plus any external pressure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this.

The piston is in equilibrium when the forces balance. The force from the gas pressure (internal) minus the external pressure (atmospheric) times the area should equal the weight of the piston.

So, the pressure difference times area equals the weight. 

So, (P_gas - P_atm) * A = Weight of piston.

Since the container's area is 1 ft², A = 1 ft².

The piston's weight is 1440 lb. Wait, but pounds can be a bit tricky here. I remember that in the English system, pounds can refer to force (like weight) or mass, but here it's given as force because it's a weight. So, the piston's weight is 1440 lb-force (lbf).

So, the pressure difference is (P_gas - P_atm) = Weight / Area. Since Area is 1 ft², the pressure difference is 1440 lb-ft⁻². Because pressure is force per unit area, so lb per square foot.

Wait, but 1 atm is about 2116.2 pounds per square foot (lb/ft²). So, 1 atm is 2116.2 lb/ft². So, the pressure inside the container when the piston is in equilibrium will be higher than atmospheric by 1440 lb/ft².

Wait, no, when the piston is at rest after moving, the pressure inside (P2) must satisfy (P2 - P_atm) * A = piston weight. So P2 = P_atm + (piston weight / A).

So, P2 = 1 atm + 1440 lb/ft².

Wait, but P_atm is 2116 lb/ft², so P2 = 2116 + 1440 = 3556 lb/ft²? That seems high, but let me think again.

Wait, no. Because the piston is subject to the gas pressure from below and atmospheric pressure from above. So the net pressure is P_gas (inside) = P_atm (above) + (weight of piston)/A.

Because the piston is in mechanical equilibrium. So the internal pressure P2 must be higher than atmospheric to support the piston's weight.

So, P2 = P_atm + (W_piston / A).

So, P2 = 1 atm (2116 lb/ft²) + 1440 lb/ft².

Wait, 1 atm is 2116 lb/ft², correct. So 2116 +1440 = 3556 lb/ft². So P2 is 3556 lb/ft².

Wait, but the initial pressure is 10 atm. Let me convert 10 atm to lb/ft² for comparison.

10 atm = 10 * 2116 = 21160 lb/ft².

So initially, the pressure is 21160 lb/ft², and the volume is 2 ft³. Wait, but the container's total volume is 5 ft³, so perhaps initially the piston is at a certain position, say, when the volume is 2 ft³.

Wait, but the container's volume is 5 ft³, so initially, with 2 ft³ of gas, the piston must be at a position where the volume is 2 ft³. Since the area is 1 ft², the height (or length) corresponding to 2 ft³ is 2 ft. So the piston is 2 feet down, and the rest (3 feet) is empty above it? Or perhaps that's the initial position. But I'm not sure if that's needed right now.

But when the piston is released, the gas expands until it reaches equilibrium, where the internal pressure equals the atmospheric pressure plus the piston's weight over the area.

So now, the process is isothermal. Since the temperature is kept the same, we can use Boyle's Law for an ideal gas at constant temperature. Boyle's Law states that P1 V1 = P2 V2.

Wait, but in this case, the pressure changes, and the volume changes. So, let me think about the initial and final states.

Initial state (1): P1 = 10 atm (21160 lb/ft²), V1 = 2 ft³.

Final state (2): P2 = 3556 lb/ft² (since P2 = 1 atm + 1440 lb/ft² = 2116 + 1440 = 3556 lb/ft²), and V2 is the volume after expansion.

So applying Boyle's Law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

Plugging in the numbers:

21160 lb/ft² * 2 ft³ = 3556 lb/ft² * V2.

So, solving for V2: V2 = (21160 * 2) / 3556.

Calculating that:

21160 * 2 = 42320.

42320 / 3556 ≈ let's compute this. 3556 * 12 = 42672. Hmm, 3556 * 11.9 ≈ 42320?

Wait, 3556 * 11 = 39116, 3556 * 12 = 42672. The numerator is 42320, which is between 11 and 12 times 3556.

So 42320 - 3556*11 = 42320 - 39116 = 3204.

3556 * 0.9 = 3200.04, so 11.9 gives us 3556*(11 +0.9) = 3556*11 + 3556*.9 = 39116 + 3200.04 = 42316.04, which is very close to 42320. So V2 ≈ 11.9 + (3.96/3556) ≈ 11.9 + 0.0011 ≈ 11.9011 ft³.

Wait, but the container's total volume is 5 ft³. So V2 can't be 11.9 ft³, that's impossible. That suggests I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, hmm. Because the container is fixed in size, the maximum volume the gas can expand to is 5 ft³. But according to the calculation, V2 would be about 11.9 ft³, which is larger than the container's volume. That can't happen, so perhaps the piston can't expand beyond the container's limit. So the maximum volume is 5 ft³, so V2 is 5 ft³.

Wait, but in that case, using Boyle's Law:

P1 V1 = P2 V2 => 10 atm * 2 ft³ = P2 *5 ft³ => P2 = (10 * 2)/5 = 4 atm.

But earlier, I thought the final pressure would be P_atm + (weight)/Area, which was 3556 lb/ft², but that's 3556 / 2116.2 ≈ 1.68 atm. So which is it?

Wait, this is confusing. Because the piston's weight would influence the pressure, but if the container's physical limit (volume) is reached before the pressure drops to 3556 lb/ft², then the piston can't move beyond that point. So perhaps the volume stops at 5 ft³, and the pressure at that point would be higher than P2 as calculated earlier.

Wait, but that can't be, because the piston can't go beyond the container. So let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this correctly. The piston is pushed up by the gas expanding until either the pressure equals the external pressure plus the piston's weight over area, or until the piston can't move further because it's reached the top of the container. So we have to find which comes first.

So, the maximum possible volume is 5 ft³. Let's compute the pressure at V=5 ft³. Using Boyle's Law: P = (P1 V1) / V = (10 atm * 2 ft³)/5 ft³ = 4 atm. So P_final would be 4 atm if the volume reaches 5 ft³.

But 4 atm is higher than the P2=1 atm + (piston weight)/(Area) = 1.68 atm. So in this case, the piston would stop at the point where the internal pressure equals P2=1.68 atm, but only if that happens before the volume reaches 5 ft³. But according to the calculation, at V2=11.9 ft³, the pressure would be 1.68 atm, but the container only allows up to 5 ft³. So the piston cannot reach that point because the container's volume is limited to 5 ft³. Therefore, the piston will stop when V=5 ft³, with the pressure at 4 atm.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4 atm is higher than the P2=1.68 atm. So the piston would continue moving until the internal pressure equals P2. But how can that be if the container's volume is only 5 ft³?

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up two scenarios. Let me think again. The container is open to the atmosphere, so when the piston moves up, the gas expands, and the pressure drops. The piston will move until the upward force from the gas equals the sum of the piston's weight and the atmospheric pressure force.

Wait, the forces on the piston are:

Upward force: P_gas * A.

Downward forces: piston weight (W) + P_atm * A.

At equilibrium, P_gas * A = W + P_atm * A.

So, P_gas = (W/A) + P_atm.

Which is the same as earlier, P2 = (W/A) + P_atm.

Wait, but P2 in the gas would be when the system is in equilibrium. If the volume allowed by the container is enough to reach that pressure, then that's where it stops. If the container's maximum volume isn't enough to reach that pressure, then the piston would hit the top, and the pressure would be higher than P2.

So in our problem, the initial volume is 2 ft³, and the container's total volume is 5 ft³, so the piston can move up by (5-2)=3 ft. Let's see what the pressure would be at V=5 ft³.

Using Boyle's Law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

P1=10 atm, V1=2 ft³, V2=5 ft³.

So P2 = (10 atm * 2) /5 = 4 atm.

Which is higher than P2 required for equilibrium (which was 1.68 atm). So that means that the piston would stop before reaching the top of the container. Because once the gas expands enough to reach P2=1.68 atm, the net force becomes zero, and the piston stops moving.

Wait, that can't be, because the piston is moving up as the gas expands, reducing the pressure. So when the pressure drops to P2=1.68 atm, the piston will stop, even if the container has more volume available. So the maximum volume isn't necessarily reached; it stops when the pressure equilibrium is achieved.

So in this case, the final pressure is P2=1.68 atm, and the volume V2 can be found using Boyle's Law.

So V2 = (P1 V1)/P2 = (10 atm * 2 ft³) / 1.68 atm.

1.68 atm is approximately 1.68 * 2116 lb/ft², but when using ratios in Boyle's Law, the units should cancel out as long as P1 and P2 are in the same units.

Wait, but 10 atm is P1, and P2 is 1.68 atm. So V2 = (10 * 2) / 1.68 = 20 / 1.68 ≈ 11.90476 ft³.

But the container's maximum volume is 5 ft³, so the piston can't go beyond that. Therefore, the piston would reach the top of the container before the pressure drops to 1.68 atm. So the final state is when V=5 ft³ and P=4 atm. That would mean that the piston doesn't stop until it hits the top of the container.

Wait, but that leads to a pressure higher than the equilibrium pressure. So in that case, the piston would be moving beyond the point where the forces balance. That doesn't make sense because the piston would stop once the net force is zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the piston can move beyond the container? No, the container's physical limit is 5 ft³, so the piston can't go beyond that. So the piston will stop when it reaches the top, even if the pressure is higher than the equilibrium pressure. So in that case, the maximum volume is 5 ft³, and the pressure is 4 atm, which is higher than the equilibrium pressure of 1.68 atm. Therefore, the piston would continue moving until it can't, but in reality, the container's limit would stop it. So that might mean that the piston can't reach the equilibrium pressure, so the maximum expansion is when V=5 ft³, P=4 atm. But in that case, the internal pressure is higher than the equilibrium pressure, so there would still be a net upward force, but the piston can't move further, so perhaps the piston would stay there, but that seems a bit odd.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a situation where the piston can move until the pressure inside equals the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the piston's weight (P2=1.68 atm). But if the container's volume is enough to allow that, then the piston moves to that volume. Otherwise, it can't.

So, let me compute the volume at P2=1.68 atm.

V2 = (10 atm * 2 ft³) / 1.68 atm ≈ 11.90476 ft³.

But the container's maximum volume is 5 ft³, so it's not possible. Therefore, the piston can only expand to 5 ft³, leading to a final pressure of 4 atm. But then, that leaves a higher pressure inside than needed for equilibrium, meaning that the piston would have a net upward force even when at the top. But since it can't move further, perhaps the system can't reach equilibrium. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense. So maybe the piston would oscillate, but in this problem, it's stated that the piston rises until it stops, implying a maximum displacement.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the piston is moving, perhaps the question is about the velocity it reaches when it starts moving, before any displacement occurs. Or maybe it's about the maximum velocity it attains during its motion, but that would involve dynamics, perhaps with acceleration.

Alternatively, considering energy conservation. When the piston is released, the gas does work in expanding, and the piston's potential energy increases as it rises. Since the process is isothermal (temperature constant), the internal energy of the ideal gas doesn't change, so the work done by the gas is equal to the heat exchanged. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the velocity is determined by when the net force on the piston is zero. Wait, no, when the piston is moving, the net force would cause acceleration, but at some point, the forces balance, leading to zero acceleration. But I'm not sure how to get the velocity from that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the piston moving up until it reaches the point where the pressure inside equals the atmospheric pressure plus the piston's weight over the area. And in doing so, calculate the velocity as it moves. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the forces acting on the piston when it's moving. The piston's acceleration would be determined by the net force. But to find the velocity, maybe we can consider the energy. The potential energy change of the piston would equal the work done by the gas expanding.

Wait, let me try that approach.

The piston has a weight W = 1440 lb. If it moves up by a distance Z (in feet), its potential energy increases by W * Z.

The gas expands from V1=2 ft³ to V2= V1 + A * Z, since area A=1 ft², so V2 = 2 + Z.

The work done by the gas during expansion is the integral of P dV. Since the process is isothermal, P = nRT/V. But since T is constant, and for an ideal gas, PV = nRT => P = nRT/V. But since it's isothermal, we can use P1 V1 = P2 V2, so P2 = (P1 V1)/V2.

Alternatively, the work done for isothermal expansion is W = nRT ln(V2/V1). But since PV = nRT, at initial state, nRT = P1 V1. So W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1).

But this work done would be equal to the change in potential energy of the piston, which is W_piston * Z
