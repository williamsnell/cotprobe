Okay, so I have this question here about converting tax rates from percentages to mills per dollar of assessed valuation. Hmm, I remember that mills are a unit used in property taxation. Let me think about how that conversion works.

Wait, right, I think 1% is equal to 10 mills. Because 1% is 0.01 in decimal, and if I remember correctly, 1 mill is 0.001 dollars per dollar of assessed value. So 1% would be 10 times 0.001, which is 0.01. Yeah, that makes sense.

So if 1% equals 10 mills, then to convert a percentage to mills, I should multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by 100 and then by 10? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. 

Oh, wait, maybe it's simpler. If 1% = 10 mills, then to get mills from a percentage, I can multiply the percentage by 10. Because 1% is 10 mills, so 2% is 20, etc. So for any given percentage, like 3.06%, I just multiply by 10 to get the number of mills.

Let me test this with an example. If I have 1%, that's 10 mills. So 3.06% would be 3.06 * 10 = 30.6 mills. Similarly, 6.85% would be 6.85 * 10 = 68.5 mills. 

Looking at the options, option F says 3.06% is 30.6 and 6.85% is 68.5. That matches what I just calculated. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that 1 mill is $0.001 per dollar. So if the tax rate is 1%, that's $0.01 per dollar, which is 10 times 0.001, so yeah, 10 mills. So the conversion is percentage * 10. So the calculation seems correct.

So the correct answer should be option F.

To convert tax rates from percentages to mills per dollar of assessed valuation, we use the fact that 1% equals 10 mills. Therefore, multiplying the percentage by 10 gives the number of mills. 

- For 3.06%, the calculation is \( 3.06 \times 10 = 30.6 \) mills.  
- For 6.85%, the calculation is \( 6.85 \times 10 = 68.5 \) mills.  

Option F matches these calculations.  

F: 3.06% = 30.6 mills per dollar, 6.85% = 68.5 mills per dollar  

Answer: F
