Question:

A tenant lived in a small apartment building that was owned by a landlord. In July, the landlord was killed in an accident. In August, the tenant brought an action against the administrator of the landlord's state. The tenant alleged that he and the landlord had a contract under the terms of which the landlord was supposed to pay him $50 a week to mow the lawn and perform small maintenance repairs for the other tenants. He claimed that the landlord had not paid him for the past six months. He testified that there was a written contract and that the landlord kept the only copy of it in his home. At trial, he called the landlord's accountant to testify about the contract. The accountant testified that she had seen the contract. She further testified about the terms of the contract, consistent with the tenant's testimony. She testified that the contract, along with many other documents pertaining to the landlord's business, had most likely been destroyed when the landlord's business office was robbed a few months earlier. The trial judge should rule that the accountant's. testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.
B: admissible, because it corroborates the tenant's claims.
C: inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.
D: inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.
E: admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.
F: inadmissible, because the accountant is an interested party.
G: admissible, because it falls under the business record exception.
H: inadmissible, because it constitutes hearsay evidence.
I: inadmissible, due to the lack of physical contract as evidence.
J: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

So, the situation is that a tenant is suing the administrator of his landlord's estate. The landlord died, and the tenant claims they had a contract where the landlord would pay him $50 a week to mow the lawn and do small repairs. The tenant says the landlord didn't pay him for six months. He testified that there was a written contract, but the landlord kept the only copy at home. Then, the tenant called the landlord's accountant as a witness. The accountant said she saw the contract and described terms that matched the tenant's story. But she also said the contract was probably destroyed when the office was robbed a few months earlier.

The question is about whether the accountant's testimony is admissible, and the options are from A to J.

I remember that when a written document is involved, the best evidence rule usually applies. The best evidence rule says that to prove the content of a writing, you need to produce the original unless you can explain why it's unavailable. So if the contract was destroyed, maybe that's a reason.

But wait, the tenant is trying to prove the existence of the contract through the accountant's testimony about what she saw. So the issue is whether the accountant's testimony is allowed. Let me think about the exceptions to the best evidence rule. There's an exception when the original is lost or destroyed, especially if it's not due to the party's fault. Here, the office was robbed, so it's likely the contract was stolen and destroyed. So the tenant can introduce secondary evidence, like a copy or testimony about the content.

But is the accountant's testimony considered secondary evidence? I think under FRE 1004, if the original is lost or destroyed without fault, secondary evidence is admissible.

Wait, but another point: the accountant is testifying about the terms of the contract based on her memory. Is that hearsay? Because the accountant is recounting what she saw in the contract, which is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So that would be hearsay. Unless there's an exception.

Hearsay exceptions include business records. The business records exception (FRE 803(6)) allows records of regularly conducted activity. But the accountant's testimony about the contract is about what she saw, but the contract itself would be a business record. Wait, the contract is prepared in the regular course of business, so it's a business record. But the accountant is testifying from her memory of it, not the record itself. So maybe the business records exception doesn't apply here because the original document isn't being presented.

Alternatively, the accountant's testimony might be allowed under the exception for lost documents, using secondary evidence. So maybe the testimony is admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances, which would make option E correct.

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible as a written admission by a party opponent. I don't think so because the accountant isn't the party opponent; she's just a witness.

B: Admissible because it corroborates. Corroboration isn't a rule of admissibility; it's more about weight.

C: Inadmissible because not best evidence. But if the original is lost, secondary evidence is allowed, so C might not be correct.

D: Dead Man's Statute. That applies when a party is deceased and the other party is testifying about a conversation or transaction with the deceased. But here, the tenant is testifying, and the accountant is a third party. So D might not apply.

E: Admissible as secondary evidence. This seems possible.

F: Inadmissible because accountant is interested. I don't think mere interest makes testimony inadmissible; it goes to credibility, not admissibility.

G: Admissible under business record exception. But the accountant's testimony isn't the business record itself, so maybe not.

H: Inadmissible as hearsay. The testimony is about the terms of the contract, which is hearsay unless an exception applies.

I: Inadmissible due to lack of contract. No, because secondary evidence can be used.

J: Admissible as hearsay exception. Maybe, but which exception?

Wait, the contract is a written document, so if it's lost, the testimony about its contents is allowed under the secondary evidence rule, not necessarily a hearsay exception. Because the content of the document is being proven through testimony, which is secondary evidence. So the hearsay issue is about the contract's terms, which would require an exception. Alternatively, the testimony itself is not hearsay because it's about a document's content, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. The contract is an out-of-court statement (the landlord's promise) offered to prove the truth (that the landlord promised to pay). So that's hearsay. Unless the contract is a business record, which it is, but the accountant isn't testifying based on the business record; she's testifying from her own memory. So maybe the business records exception doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, maybe the accountant's testimony is admissible as secondary evidence under FRE 1004, which allows testimony about the content of a writing if the original is lost. So the testimony is admissible as secondary evidence, making option E correct.

So looking back, the options are:

E: admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the accountant's testimony regarding the terms of a written contract that was allegedly destroyed. The tenant is suing the landlord's estate, claiming the landlord failed to pay him under their agreement. The accountant testified about the contract's terms, stating that the document was likely destroyed during a robbery. The issue is whether this testimony is admissible.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Best Evidence Rule**: Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), the best evidence rule requires the original document to prove the content of a writing. However, if the original is lost or destroyed without fault, secondary evidence (such as testimony about the document's contents) is admissible under FRE 1004.

2. **Hearsay Consideration**: The accountant's testimony about the contract's terms could be considered hearsay because it involves an out-of-court statement (the contract) offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (the landlord's obligation to pay). However, the testimony may fall under exceptions, such as the business records exception (FRE 803(6)) or secondary evidence provisions.

3. **Business Records Exception**: While the contract itself qualifies as a business record, the accountant's testimony is based on her memory, not the document itself. Thus, the business records exception does not directly apply here.

4. **Secondary Evidence**: Since the contract was likely destroyed during a robbery, the tenant can introduce secondary evidence, such as the accountant's testimony, to prove the contract's terms. This aligns with FRE 1004, which allows testimony about the contents of a lost or destroyed document.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. The accountant's testimony is not a written admission by a party opponent.
   - **B**: Incorrect. Corroboration is not a basis for admissibility.
   - **C**: Incorrect. Secondary evidence is admissible when the original is lost or destroyed.
   - **D**: Incorrect. The Dead Man's Statute does not apply here.
   - **E**: Correct. The testimony is admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.
   - **F**: Incorrect. The accountant's interest does not render the testimony inadmissible.
   - **G**: Incorrect. The testimony does not qualify under the business records exception.
   - **H**: Incorrect. While hearsay is a concern, the testimony is admissible under exceptions for secondary evidence.
   - **I**: Incorrect. The lack of the physical contract does not bar the testimony.
   - **J**: Incorrect. The testimony is admissible under the secondary evidence rule, not as a general hearsay exception.

The accountant's testimony is admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances because the original contract was likely destroyed, and the testimony provides a reliable account of its terms.

**Answer: E**
