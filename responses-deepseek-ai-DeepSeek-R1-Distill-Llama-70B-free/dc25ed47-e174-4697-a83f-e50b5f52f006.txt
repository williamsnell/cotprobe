Question:

Before the close of evidence in a federal negligence trial, the defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence. Before instructing the jury, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, which did not include the defendant's contributory negligence instruction or any instruction on contributory negligence. Neither party objected, either then or after the judge had given the instructions. The jury after the judge had given the instructions. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judge entered judgment on the verdict. The defendant would like to appeal the verdict on the ground that the judge should have instructed the jury on contributory negligence. Has the defendant preserved the issue for appeal?

Options:

A: Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.
B: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was a valid point of appeal.
C: No, because the defendant did not raise the issue of contributory negligence during the trial.
D: Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.
E: No, because the defendant did not reiterate the need for the instruction after it was not included.
F: Yes, because the judge did not give an instruction on contributory negligence.
G: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was ignored by the judge.
H: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Okay, so I've got this question about preserving an issue for appeal in a federal negligence trial. Hmm, I need to figure out whether the defendant has done everything necessary to appeal the judge's decision not to instruct the jury on contributory negligence.

Let me start by recalling the rules about jury instructions and preserving issues for appeal. I remember that in federal courts, parties must object to jury instructions or the lack thereof to preserve the issue. The process usually involves submitting proposed instructions, the judge deciding which ones to give, and then the parties having a chance to object before the instructions are finalized.

In this case, the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence. The judge told both parties which instructions she would give, and the defendant's wasn't included. Neither the defendant nor the plaintiff objected at that time. Then, after the judge gave the instructions, the jury came back with a verdict for the plaintiff.

So the key here is whether the defendant properly preserved the issue. I think the rule is that you have to object when the judge notifies you of the instructions, or at least before the jury starts deliberating. If you don't, you might waive that issue on appeal.

Wait, the defendant submitted the instruction, but when the judge said she wasn't including it, the defendant didn't say anything. So by not objecting at that point, did they waive their right to appeal that issue?

Let me think about the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, Rule 51, which deals with jury instructions. Rule 51(b) says that to preserve an issue, a party must state distinctly the matter of law and the controlling authority, or the reason why the instruction is correct. And they have to do this on the record, either before the jury is instructed or, if the court informs the parties of its proposed instructions, then any objections must be made at that time.

So in this scenario, the judge informed the parties in advance. The defendant didn't object then, nor did they object after the instructions were given. So they didn't make a timely objection as required by Rule 51.

Looking at the answer choices, option H says: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties. That seems to fit. The defendant didn't object when they had the chance, so they can't raise it on appeal.

Other options, like A and D, suggest that submitting the instruction is enough, but I don't think so. The submission isn't sufficient without an objection when the judge excludes it. So the correct answer should be H.

The issue revolves around whether the defendant preserved the claim of error regarding the judge's failure to instruct the jury on contributory negligence. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51, a party must timely object to the omission of an instruction when the court provides an opportunity to review and object to the proposed instructions. In this case, the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence, but when the judge informed the parties that she would not include it, the defendant failed to object. This failure to object at the appropriate time waived the issue for appeal.

Option H correctly identifies that the defendantâ€™s failure to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give precludes them from raising the issue on appeal. Other options, such as A and D, incorrectly suggest that merely submitting the instruction is sufficient, but the law requires a timely objection to preserve the issue.

Answer: H
