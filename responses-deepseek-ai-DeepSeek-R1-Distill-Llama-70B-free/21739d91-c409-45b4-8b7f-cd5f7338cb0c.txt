Okay, so I've got this problem here about rotational transitions in a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says that the J=2 to 3 transition occurs at 126.4 GHz. They're asking for the frequency of the J=5 to 6 transition. Right, I remember that in rotational spectroscopy, the energy levels are quantized and the transitions between them follow certain selection rules.

Wait, the selection rule for rotational transitions in diatomic molecules is that ΔJ = ±1. So, J can go from 2 to 3, which fits, and similarly from 5 to 6. Got it.

I think the energy levels for rotation are given by the formula E_J = B * J * (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. Oh wait, right, and the frequency of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. So the frequency ν is proportional to the change in energy, which is E_upper - E_lower.

The energy difference ΔE for a transition from J to J+1 would be E_{J+1} - E_J. Let's compute that.

E_J = B J (J+1)
E_{J+1} = B (J+1)(J+2)
So ΔE = E_{J+1} - E_J = B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ]
Let me expand that: (J+1)(J+2) is J² +3J +2, and J(J+1) is J² + J. Subtracting them: (J²+3J+2) - (J² + J) = 2J + 2. So ΔE = B (2J + 2) = 2B (J+1).

Wait, but wait, in terms of frequency, since E = hν, so ν = ΔE / h. So the frequency should be proportional to 2B (J+1).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), right? So the difference when going from J to J+1 is E_{J+1} - E_J = B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ].

Wait, calculating that again: (J+1)(J+2) = J² + 3J + 2, J(J+1) is J² + J. Subtracting, J² +3J+2 - J² -J = 2J + 2. So ΔE = B*(2J + 2) = 2B (J+1). So the energy difference is 2B (J+1). Therefore, the frequency ν is proportional to (J+1). Because ν = ΔE / h. So ν ∝ (J+1).

Wait, is that correct? Because for each transition J→J+1, the frequency increases linearly with J+1. So for J=2→3, the frequency is proportional to 3. For J=5→6, it's proportional to 6. So the ratio of the frequencies would be 6/3 = 2. So if the J=2→3 transition is at 126.4 GHz, the J=5→6 would be twice that, so 252.8 GHz.

Wait, but wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. Let's think about the energy levels. The rotational energy levels are quantized and given by E_J = B J (J + 1). So the transition from J to J+1 would involve absorbing a photon with energy E = E_{J+1} - E_J = B ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) = B (J^2 + 3J + 2 - J^2 - J ) = B ( 2J + 2 ) = 2B (J + 1).

So E is proportional to (J +1). But since energy E = h ν, where h is Planck's constant, ν is proportional to E. So ν ∝ (J+1) * B. Wait, but B itself is a constant for the molecule, so for different transitions in the same molecule, B is the same. So the frequency should be proportional to (J +1).

So for the first transition, J=2 to J=3, J is 2, so (J+1)=3. The frequency is 126.4 GHz. For the second transition, J=5 to J=6, (J+1) =6. So the frequency should be (6/3) times larger, so 2 times 126.4 GHz. Let me calculate that: 126.4 *2 = 252.8 GHz. So the answer should be 252.8 GHz. Looking at the options, option B is 252.8 GHz.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because another way to think about it is the selection rule. The allowed transition is ΔJ=+1. So the frequency of the transition J→J+1 is proportional to (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1). Wait no, in terms of the quantum number, sometimes the frequency is said to be proportional to 2J+1 or something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the rotational constant B. The energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), with B = ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the transition frequency from J to J+1 is (E_{J+1} - E_J)/h = [B ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] / h.

Simplify that: B(2J + 2)/h = 2B (J+1)/h.

So ν = 2B(J +1)/h.

Wait, but B has units of energy per (angular momentum quantum number squared), but more accurately, B is given in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) or frequency. Alternatively, another approach: the rotational constant B is related to the frequency of the transition. Alternatively, in some contexts, the frequency is given by ν = 2B (J + 1). So for each J→J+1 transition, the frequency increases by 2B each time J increases by 1.

Wait, that might not be the case. Wait, let me re-express: For J=2→3, ν1 = 2B (2 +1) = 6B. And for J=5→6, ν2=2B (5+1)=12B. So the ratio ν2/ν1 = (12B)/(6B) )= 2. So ν2=2*ν1= 2*126.4 GHz=252.8 GHz, which is option B.

So that's correct. So the answer is B:252.8 GHz.

The problem involves determining the frequency of the $J=5$ to $6$ rotational transition in a diatomic molecule, given that the $J=2$ to $3$ transition occurs at $126.4 \, \mathrm{GHz}$. 

Rotational energy levels in diatomic molecules are quantized and given by $E_J = B J (J+1)$, where $B$ is the rotational constant. The energy difference between two adjacent levels $J$ and $J+1$ is:

\[
\Delta E = E_{J+1} - E_J = B \left[(J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1)\right] = 2B (J+1).
\]

The frequency of the absorbed photon corresponding to this energy difference is proportional to $\Delta E / h$, where $h$ is Planck's constant. Since $B$ and $h$ are constants for a given molecule, the frequency $\nu$ is proportional to $(J+1)$. 

For the $J=2 \to 3$ transition, $\nu_1 \propto (2+1) = 3$. For the $J=5 \to 6$ transition, $\nu_2 \propto (5+1) = 6$. The ratio of the frequencies is:

\[
\frac{\nu_2}{\nu_1} = \frac{6}{3} = 2.
\]

Thus, $\nu_2 = 2 \cdot \nu_1 = 2 \cdot 126.4 \, \mathrm{GHz} = 252.8 \, \mathrm{GHz}$.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 252.8 GHz.**
