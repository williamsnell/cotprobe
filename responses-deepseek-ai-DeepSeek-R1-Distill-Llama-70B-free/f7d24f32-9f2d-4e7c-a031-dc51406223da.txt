Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In a frictionless world economy, resources would be perfectly mobile. As it is now, immigration, emigration and capital outflow restrictions severely limit resource mobility. How do the changes in supply and demand, and the consequent price changes, brought about by application of comparative advantage, tend to compensate for the immobility of re- sources .

Options:

A: Trade causes the price of resources to skyrocket
B: Trade causes the price of resources to become more volatile
C: Trade roughly matches up the worldwide demand for resources, with the world-wide supply.
D: Trade leads to a scarcity of resources in regions with comparative disadvantage
E: Trade results in an equal distribution of resources across all countries regardless of supply and demand
F: Trade perpetuates the immobility of resources by creating dependency on imports
G: Trade eliminates the need for resource mobility
H: Trade leads to a surplus of resources
I: Trade consistently reduces the worldwide demand for resources
J: Trade ensures that resources are only allocated to the most developed economies

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a frictionless world economy where resources are perfectly mobile. But in reality, there are restrictions like immigration, emigration, and capital outflows that limit how resources can move around. The question is asking how changes in supply and demand, along with the resulting price changes caused by comparative advantage, compensate for the immobility of resources.

Hmm. So, when resources can't move easily between countries, how does trade help make up for that? I remember that comparative advantage is about countries specializing in producing goods where they have lower opportunity costs. So even if a country is worse at producing everything, they can still benefit by focusing on what they're relatively better at.

Without resource mobility, countries might not be using their resources in the most efficient way. But trade allows them to export goods they're good at producing and import goods they're not. So this should affect supply and demand in some way.

The question is about how supply and demand changes, and price changes, compensate for immobile resources. So when countries trade, they're effectively moving goods instead of resources. So the supply of goods becomes more balanced globally because countries are producing what they're best at and trading.

Looking at the options:

A: Trade causes resource prices to skyrocket. I don't think so. Prices might adjust, but skyrocket seems too extreme.

B: More volatile prices. Not sure. Maybe, but I don't see volatility as the main point here.

C: Trade matches worldwide demand with supply. That sounds plausible. If countries specialize, the global supply of each good should better match the global demand.

D: Scarcity in regions with comparative disadvantage. Wait, comparative disadvantage is what a country isn't good at. But through trade, they can import those goods, so maybe it's not scarcity but relying on imports.

E: Equal distribution regardless of supply and demand. That doesn't seem right. Trade doesn't make everything equal; it's based on relative efficiency.

F: Trade makes dependency on imports, so it keeps resources from moving. I'm not sure. Maybe, but I don't think it's the main compensation mechanism.

G: Eliminates need for resource mobility. Oh, because if resources can't move, trade allows goods to move instead. So maybe this is it.

Wait, but the question is about how supply and demand changes compensate. So when countries trade, the supply of goods they produce increases because they specialize, and the demand for goods they import decreases because they can get them from elsewhere. So globally, supply and demand for each good balance out more efficiently than if each country tried to produce everything.

So option C says trade roughly matches worldwide demand and supply. That makes sense because countries produce more of what they're good at, increasing the global supply of those goods, and import others, which affects demand.

Option G says trade eliminates the need for resource mobility. I think that's also a possible answer. Because instead of moving resources (like labor or capital), you move the goods. So the resources don't need to move because the goods are traded.

Wait, the question is about how changes in supply and demand compensate. So maybe the correct answer is C because it's about matching demand and supply. Or G because it's about eliminating the need for resource movement.

Let me think again. The question states that resources are immobile, so how do supply and demand changes (due to comparative advantage) compensate.

When a country specializes based on comparative advantage, it increases the supply of the goods it's good at producing. This leads to a surplus in those goods, which can be exported. Conversely, it imports goods that it's not as efficient at producing. So globally, the supply and demand for each good become more balanced because each good is produced where it's cheapest, and trade allows countries to meet their demands without having to produce everything domestically.

So option C says trade roughly matches worldwide demand for resources with supply. Wait, but resources are inputs, and the question is about immobility of resources. So perhaps when resources can't move, trade in goods allows the effective allocation of resources across countries. So the resources are used where they're most efficient, and the goods are traded, making the overall supply and demand for goods balanced globally.

So the answer would be C. Or maybe G. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: In a world with immobile resources, countries specialize and trade. This specialization leads to each country's resources being used more efficiently. So the supply of goods from each country increases where they have an advantage, and the demand for those goods elsewhere is met through imports. So the global supply and demand for each good are balanced through trade, which compensates for the immobility of resources.

So option C is about matching demand and supply worldwide. So I think that's the correct answer.

In a world where resources are immobile, trade allows countries to specialize in producing goods based on comparative advantage. This specialization increases the global supply of goods that countries are efficient at producing and allows them to import goods they are not. As a result, trade helps balance the worldwide demand for resources with the worldwide supply of goods, compensating for the immobility of resources. This mechanism ensures that resources are used more efficiently and that global markets for goods become more balanced.

The correct answer is:

C: Trade roughly matches up the worldwide demand for resources, with the worldwide supply.
