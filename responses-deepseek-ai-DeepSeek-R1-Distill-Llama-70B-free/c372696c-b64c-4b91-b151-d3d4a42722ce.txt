Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because derivatives can be tricky, especially when inverse trigonometric functions are involved. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: If z equals the arctangent of e raised to the power of (1 plus (1 plus x) squared), what's the derivative of z with respect to x at x equals 0. Hmm, okay. So they want the partial derivative ∂z/∂x evaluated at x=0.

Let me break this down. The function z is arctan(e^{f(x)}), where f(x) is 1 + (1 + x)^2. So, z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}).

I remember that to find the derivative of arctan(u) with respect to x is (u') / (1 + u²). But wait, in this case, u is e^{something}, so I'll have to apply the chain rule.

Let me write down the steps:

First, let me find the derivative of arctan(u) with respect to u. That's 1/(1 + u²). Then, I need to multiply by the derivative of u with respect to x.

So, u = e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}. Let's compute du/dx.

The derivative of e^v is e^v times the derivative of v. Here, v is 1 + (1 + x)^2. So, dv/dx is the derivative of (1 + x)^2, which is 2(1 + x) times the derivative of (1 + x), which is 1. So, dv/dx = 2(1 + x).

Putting that together, du/dx = e^{1 + (1 + x)^2} * 2(1 + x).

Now, putting it all together, dz/dx = [1 / (1 + u²)] * (du/dx). So:

dz/dx = [1 / (1 + (e^{1 + (1 + x)^2})²)] * [e^{1 + (1 + x)^2} * 2(1 + x)].

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me simplify the expression.

Simplify the denominator: 1 + u² is 1 + [e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}]^2. Which is 1 + e^{2*(1 + (1 + x)^2)}.

So, dz/dx = [e^{1 + (1 + x)^2} * 2(1 + x)] / [1 + e^{2*(1 + (1 + x)^2)} ].

Hmm, that's the general form. Now, we need to evaluate this at x=0.

So, plug in x=0:

Compute (1 + x) first: 1 + 0 = 1. So, (1 + x)^2 is 1 squared, which is 1. So, the exponent 1 + 1 is 2. So, e^{2}.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

u = e^{2}, so u² = (e²)^2 = e^4.

So, the denominator becomes 1 + e^4.

The numerator: e^{2} * 2*(1 + 0) = e² * 2 * 1 = 2e².

So, dz/dx at x=0 is (2e²) / (1 + e^4).

Wait, let me compute that numerically to see which option it matches.

First, compute e². e is approximately 2.71828, so e squared is about 7.38906. Then, e^4 is (e²)^2, which is approximately (7.38906)^2 = about 54.59815.

So, the denominator is 1 + 54.59815 = 55.59815.

The numerator is 2 * 7.38906 ≈ 14.77812.

So, the derivative is 14.77812 / 55.59815.

Let me compute that division.

14.77812 ÷ 55.59815 ≈ Let's see. 55.59815 goes into 14.77812 about 0.266 times. Wait, let me do a more precise calculation.

Dividing 14.77812 by 55.59815:

Approximately:

55.59815 * 0.26 = 14.4657 (since 0.2 is 11.11963, 0.06 is about 3.3359, adding gives 14.4555; close to 14.778). The difference is about 0.3125.

So, 0.26 + (0.3125 / 55.59815) ≈ 0.26 + 0.0056 ≈ 0.2656.

Wait, perhaps a calculator would give a more precise value. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out e² from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let's see:

dz/dx at x=0 is (2e²) / (1 + e^4) = (2 e²) / (1 + e^4).

I can write this as 2/(e^{-2} + e^{2} ), but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of hyperbolic functions, but perhaps it's not necessary.

Alternatively, compute the numerical value precisely.

Numerator: 2e² ≈ 2 * 7.389056 ≈ 14.778112.

Denominator: 1 + e^4 ≈ 1 + (e²)^2 ≈ 1 + (7.389056)^2.

Calculating 7.389056 squared:

7 *7=49, 0.389056 *7≈2.7234, so 7.389 *7.389 is approximately (7 + 0.389)^2 = 7² + 2*7*0.389 + 0.389² = 49 + 5.446 + 0.1513 ≈ 54.5973.

So denominator is 54.5973 +1 = 55.5973.

So, 14.778112 / 55.5973 ≈ Let's compute.

55.5973 * 0.266 ≈ 14.7781. Because 55.5973 * 0.2 = 11.11946; 0.06 is 3.3358; 0.006 is 0.3336. Adding 0.2+0.06+0.006=0.266. So 11.11946 +3.3358=14.45526 + 0.3336=14.78886. Wait, but the numerator is 14.778112, which is a bit less than 14.78886.

So perhaps 0.266 *55.5973 ≈14.78886, which is a bit larger than numerator's 14.7781.

So let's compute 14.7781 /55.5973.

Let me compute 55.5973 * x =14.7781. So x=14.7781/55.5973 ≈ ?

Divide 14.7781 by 55.5973:

55.5973 goes into 14.7781 about 0.266 times.

But wait, perhaps 0.266 is too high because 0.266 *55.5973=14.78886, which is a bit higher than 14.7781. So the actual value is slightly less than 0.266.

Compute the difference: 14.78886 -14.7781 = 0.01076.

So, 0.01076 is the excess. So, to find how much less than 0.266.

So, (0.01076) /55.5973 ≈ 0.0001936.

So, x ≈ 0.266 - 0.0001936 ≈ 0.2658.

So approximately 0.2658.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 0.4752

B: 0.6210

C:0.4123

D:0.5678

E:0.5439

F:0.2896

G:0.3017

H:0.1345

I:0.6571

J:0.2198

Wait, none of the options are near 0.2658. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the derivative steps. Let me go back.

The function is z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}).

Then, dz/dx = [ derivative of arctan(u) ] * du/dx.

Derivative of arctan(u) is 1/(1 + u²).

u = e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}.

du/dx = e^{1 + (1 + x)^2} * derivative of (1 + (1 + x)^2), which is 2(1 + x)*1.

So, dz/dx = [1/(1 + u²)] * e^{1 + (1 +x)^2} * 2(1+x).

Wait, but u is e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}, so 1/(1 + u²) is 1/(1 + e^{2*(1 + (1 +x)^2)}).

So, dz/dx = [e^{1 + (1+x)^2} * 2(1 +x)] / [1 + e^{2*(1 + (1+x)^2)} ].

At x=0, (1 +x)=1, so (1+x)^2=1.

So exponent: 1 + 1 =2.

So u = e^2.

dz/dx at x=0 is [e^2 * 2 *1 ] / [1 + (e^{2})^2 ].

Which is (2 e²) / (1 + e^4).

Wait, is that correct? Oh, because (e^{2})^2 is e^4, yes.

So, the expression is 2 e² / (1 + e^4) ≈ 2 * 7.389056 / (1 + 54.59815) ≈ 14.778112 / 55.59815 ≈ 0.2658.

But the options don't have 0.2658. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, wait, another approach: Let's compute e^2 and e^4 accurately.

e^2 is approximately 7.38905609893.

e^4 is (e^2)^2, which is (7.38905609893)^2.

Let me compute that more accurately.

7 *7 is 49.

7 * 0.389056 is approximately 2.723.

0.389056 * 7 is another 2.723.

0.389056 * 0.389056 is approximately 0.1513.

Wait, maybe I should compute 7.389056^2.

7.389056 *7.389056:

= (7 + 0.389056)^2.

= 7^2 + 2 *7 *0.389056 + (0.389056)^2.

= 49 + 2 * 7 *0.389056 + 0.151314.

Compute each term:

49 is 49.

2 *7 =14; 14 *0.389056 ≈ 5.446784.

0.389056^2: let's compute 0.38 *0.38 = 0.1444, 0.009056^2 is negligible. Alternatively, 0.389056 *0.389056.

Compute 0.3 *0.3=0.09.

0.3 *0.089056=0.0267168.

0.089056 *0.3= another 0.0267168.

0.089056 *0.089056 ≈ 0.007925.

Adding all:

0.09 + 0.0267168 + 0.0267168 + 0.007925 ≈ 0.09 + 0.0534336 + 0.007925 = 0.1513586.

So, putting it all together:

49 + 5.446784 = 54.446784, plus 0.1513586 is approximately 54.5981426.

So, e^4 ≈54.5981426.

So, the denominator is 1 + 54.5981426 =55.5981426.

Numerator: 2 * e^2 ≈2 *7.38905609893=14.7781122.

So, 14.7781122 /55.5981426 ≈ Let's compute this division more precisely.

Let me compute 14.7781122 divided by 55.5981426.

I can write this as approximately 0.2658.

But looking at the options, none of them are 0.2658. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the derivative. Let me check that again.

Wait, maybe I forgot to apply the chain rule correctly.

Let me rederive.

z = arctan(u), where u = e^{v}, and v =1 + (1 +x)^2.

dz/dx = (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dx.

du/dx = e^v * dv/dx.

dv/dx is derivative of 1 + (1 +x)^2. Which is 2(1 +x) *1.

So, yes, dz/dx is [e^v * 2(1 +x)] / (1 + (e^v)^2).

Which is [e^v * 2(1 +x)] / (1 + e^{2v}).

So at x=0, v =1 + (1 +0)^2 = 2.

So, dz/dx = [e^2 * 2 *1 ] / (1 + e^{4}).

So, that's correct.

So, the computed value is approximately 0.2658.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G:0.3017, but that's higher. Option F:0.2896, which is 0.2896, which is a bit higher than 0.2658.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 2e²/(1+e⁴) exactly, numerically.

Let me compute e² = about 7.38905609893.

e^4 = (e²)² ≈ 54.59815.

So, 1 + e^4 ≈55.59815.

2e² ≈14.778112.

So, 14.778112 /55.59815.

Let me compute this division accurately.

Let me write it as 14.778112 ÷55.59815.

Let me compute 55.59815 * 0.26 = ?

55.59815 *0.2 =11.11963.

55.59815 *0.06=3.33589.

Adding 0.26 gives 14.45552.

Now, 14.778112 -14.45552 =0.322592 remaining.

So, for the remaining 0.322592, how much more do I need?

Compute 0.322592 /55.59815 ≈ approximately 0.005804.

So total is 0.26 +0.005804=0.265804.

So, about 0.2658.

Now, looking at the options, the closest option isn't present. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Wait, perhaps I misread the function.

Let me read the problem again.

z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, is the exponent 1 + (1 +x)^2, or perhaps (1 + (1 +x))^2 ?

No, the exponent is 1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, 1 plus (1 +x) squared.

So, the calculations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of another function or perhaps I messed up the derivative of arctan.

Wait, another thought: The derivative of arctan(u) is 1/(1 + u^2) times du/dx. So that's correct.

Wait, is there perhaps an error in the chain rule? Let me think again. Compute du/dx correctly.

u = e^{f(x)}, where f(x) =1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, du/dx = e^{f(x)} * f’(x).

f’(x) = 2(1+x) *1.

So, yes, that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this using another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'll use substitution. Let me let y = 1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, at x=0, y =1 +1=2.

Then, z = arctan(e^y).

So, dz/dx = dz/dy * dy/dx.

dz/dy is derivative of arctan(e^y) with respect to y.

Which is [e^y / (1 + (e^y)^2 ) ].

dy/dx is 2(1 +x).

So, dz/dx = [e^y / (1 + e^{2y}) ] * 2(1 +x).

At x=0, y=2, so:

dz/dx = [e^2 / (1 + e^{4}) ] * 2.

Which is the same as before, 2e²/(1 +e^4) ≈0.2658.

So, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I miscalculated the exponent.

Wait, perhaps the function is z = arctan( e^{1 + (1 +x)^2} ), which I interpreted as e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}, but perhaps it's e^{1} + (1 +x)^2?

Wait, no, that's not possible because the exponent must be a single term. So, 1 + (1 +x)^2 is the exponent.

So, the original setup is correct.

Wait, let me compute the numerical value again more accurately.

Compute 2e² = 2 *7.38905609893 ≈14.7781122.

Compute 1 + e^4 =1 +54.59815 ≈55.59815.

So, 14.7781122 /55.59815 ≈0.2658.

Looking at the options, none of them match. The closest
