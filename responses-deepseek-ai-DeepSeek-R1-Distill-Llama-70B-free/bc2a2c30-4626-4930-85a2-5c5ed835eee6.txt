Okay, I need to calculate the Hamming distances between each pair of the given codewords and find the minimum distance. The codewords are 000000, 010101, 101010, and 110110. I remember that the Hamming distance is the number of positions where the corresponding symbols are different.

Let me list all possible pairs first. Since the order matters (like A to B and B to A are the same), I'll consider each unique pair once. The codewords are:

1. 000000
2. 010101
3. 101010
4. 110110

So the pairs I need to check are:

- Pair 1 and 2
- Pair 1 and 3
- Pair 1 and 4
- Pair 2 and 3
- Pair 2 and 4
- Pair 3 and 4

I'll go through each pair one by one.

Starting with Pair 1 and 2 (000000 and 010101):
Compare each bit:
Position 1: 0 vs 0 → same.
Position 2: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 3: 0 vs 0 → same.
Position 4: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 5: 0 vs 0 → same.
Position 6: 0 vs 1 → different.
So there are 3 differences. Hamming distance is 3.

Next, Pair 1 and 3 (000000 and 101010):
Compare each bit:
Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 2: 0 vs 0 → same.
Position 3: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 4: 0 vs 0 → same.
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 6: 0 vs 0 → same.
Differences in positions 1,3,5. So distance is 3 again.

Now, Pair 1 and 4 (000000 and 110110):
Compare each bit:
Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 2: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 3: 0 vs 0 → same.
Position 4: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 6: 0 vs 0 → same.
Differences at positions 1,2,4,5 → 4 differences. So distance is 4.

Moving to Pair 2 and 3 (010101 and 101010):
Compare each bit:
Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 2: 1 vs 0 → different.
Position 3: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 4: 1 vs 0 → different.
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 6: 1 vs 0 → different.
Wait, that's all 6 positions different. So distance is 6.

Pair 2 and 4 (010101 and 110110):
Comparing each bit:
Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 2: 1 vs 1 → same.
Position 3: 0 vs 0 → same.
Position 4: 1 vs 1 → same.
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 6: 1 vs 0 → different.
Differences at positions 1,5,6. So 3 differences, distance is 3.

Lastly, Pair 3 and 4 (101010 and 110110):
Compare each bit:
Position 1: 1 vs 1 → same.
Position 2: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 3: 1 vs 0 → different.
Position 4: 0 vs 1 → different.
Position 5: 1 vs 1 → same.
Position 6: 0 vs 0 → same.
Differences at positions 2,3,4 → 3 differences. Distance is 3.

Now compiling all the distances I found:
- 1-2: 3
- 1-3: 3
- 1-4:4
- 2-3:6
- 2-4:3
- 3-4:3

The minimum distance is the smallest value among these. Looking, the smallest is 3. Wait wait, wait a minute. Did I miss any pair with a smaller distance? Let me double-check.

Wait, the first pair (1-2) had a distance of 3, same as others. So the minimal is 3. Looking at the options, option H is 3.

Wait, but the options are from A to J, with H being 3. So the answer should be H.

To determine the minimum Hamming distance among the codewords 000000, 010101, 101010, and 110110, we calculate the Hamming distance for all unique pairs. The Hamming distance is defined as the number of positions where the corresponding symbols differ.

### Pairs and Their Hamming Distances:
1. **Pair 1 and 2 (000000, 010101):**  
   Differences at positions 2, 4, and 6.  
   Hamming distance = 3.

2. **Pair 1 and 3 (000000, 101010):**  
   Differences at positions 1, 3, and 5.  
   Hamming distance = 3.

3. **Pair 1 and 4 (000000, 110110):**  
   Differences at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.  
   Hamming distance = 4.

4. **Pair 2 and 3 (010101, 101010):**  
   Differences at all positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
   Hamming distance = 6.

5. **Pair 2 and 4 (010101, 110110):**  
   Differences at positions 1, 5, and 6.  
   Hamming distance = 3.

6. **Pair 3 and 4 (101010, 110110):**  
   Differences at positions 2, 3, and 4.  
   Hamming distance = 3.

### Summary of Hamming Distances:
- Pair 1-2: 3  
- Pair 1-3: 3  
- Pair 1-4: 4  
- Pair 2-3: 6  
- Pair 2-4: 3  
- Pair 3-4: 3  

The minimum Hamming distance among all pairs is **3**.

### Final Answer:
H
