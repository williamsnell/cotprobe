Okay, so I have this math problem here: "What is three fifth of 100?" And I need to choose the correct answer from the options A to J. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when someone says "a fraction of a number," it means multiplication. So, three fifths of 100 should be 3/5 multiplied by 100. That makes sense. So I can write it as (3/5) * 100.

Now, let's compute that. 3 divided by 5 is 0.6. So 0.6 times 100. Wait, 0.6 times 100 is 60, right? Because 0.6 is the same as 60 cents, and 100 would make it 60 dollars or just 60 units. So three fifths of 100 is 60.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one is 60. Let me check each option. Option A is 50, no. B is 20, no. C is 3, that's too small. D is 90, too big. E is 80, also bigger than 60. F is 60, that's the one I'm looking for. G is 100, no. H is 30, no. I is 70, no. J is 5, no.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check my calculation. Another way to think about it is dividing 100 into 5 equal parts. So each part is 100/5 = 20. Then three parts would be 3*20 = 60. Yep, that confirms it.

Alternatively, I could simplify the fraction. 3/5 is the same as 60/100, so 60% of 100 is 60. That's another way to see it. So definitely, the answer should be 60.

Looking back at the options, F is 60. So I think the correct answer is F.

The question asks for three fifths of 100, which is calculated as (3/5) * 100. Simplifying, 3 divided by 5 is 0.6, and 0.6 multiplied by 100 equals 60. Checking the options, 60 corresponds to option F. 

Answer: F
