Okay, so I have this question about the catharsis theory and its relation to frustration and aggression. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that catharsis has something to do with releasing pent-up emotions, right? Let me think. The question says that frustration always leads to aggression, and vice versa, but what does the catharsis theory say that's not supported by research.

Wait, I think the catharsis theory suggests that acting out aggressive feelings can actually reduce aggression. Like, if you're angry, punching a pillow might make you feel better and less likely to act aggressively later. But I also recall that research doesn't really back this up. In fact, some studies show that engaging in aggressive acts might actually increase future aggression because it reinforces the behavior.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that describes what the catharsis theory states. Let's go through them:

Option A: Aggressive acts can only be predicted by physical characteristics. That doesn't sound right. I don't think catharsis is about prediction based on physical traits.

Option B: Feelings of anonymity lead to more violence. That's more about deindividuation, I think, not catharsis.

Option C: Aggressive acts increase further aggression. Wait, this seems opposite of catharsis. If catharsis says aggression reduces future aggression, then this would contradict it. But the question is about what catharsis states, which is unsupported by research.

Option D: Frustration is a prerequisite for any aggressive act. That sounds like the frustration-aggression hypothesis, which says that aggression is always caused by frustration. But the question is about catharsis theory.

Option E: Catharsis theory states high stress leads to more aggression. Hmm, not sure. I think catharsis is more about releasing stress through aggression, which would reduce it, not increase.

Option F: Aggression is always a response to perceived injustice. That's more like the frustration-aggression link, maybe.

Option G: Aggressive act reduces inclination to engage in other aggressive acts. Oh, this fits. Catharsis theory would say that acting aggressively (like venting) reduces future aggression. But research doesn't support this; in fact, it might do the opposite.

Option H: Aggressive acts are always due to unresolved childhood issues. Doesn't relate to catharsis.

Option I: Assigned roles affect aggression. Not sure, maybe related to role theory, but not catharsis.

Option J: High temperature leads to more aggression. That's the heat hypothesis, which is a different topic.

So the question is about what catharsis theory states but isn't supported. So catharsis says that aggressive acts reduce future aggression, which is option G. But wait, the question's first statement is about frustration leading to aggression, so maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the initial statement says "Frustration always leads to aggression/aggression always predicated by frustration." That's the frustration-aggression hypothesis, which is a different theory. The question is about catharsis theory's stance on this issue, which isn't supported.

Wait, no. The question is: What does the catharsis theory state regarding the issue that frustration leads to aggression, but is unsupported by research.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the question.

"Frustration always leads to aggression/aggression always predicated by frustration. What does the CATHARSIS THEORY states in this issue, but is unsupported by research?"

So the issue is the statement that frustration always leads to aggression. The question is asking what catharsis theory says about this, but which isn't backed by research.

Wait, I'm confused. I think I might have mixed up the theories. Let me clarify.

The frustration-aggression hypothesis (by Dollard et al.) says that frustration always leads to some form of aggression. But the catharsis theory, as I remember, is about the idea that expressing aggression (like venting) will reduce future aggression. So catharsis theory says that acting aggressively can reduce aggression, which is the opposite of what some research shows.

Wait, but the question is about catharsis theory's position on the frustration-aggression link. So perhaps the catharsis theory doesn't directly address that, but the question is phrased as what does catharsis theory state regarding the issue that frustration leads to aggression.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The options are about what the catharsis theory states, which isn't supported. So looking for the option that aligns with catharsis theory's claims.

Option G says aggressive acts reduce inclination for more aggression. So catharsis theory would state that, which is option G. But research doesn't support this; in fact, acting aggressively can increase it.

So the answer should be G.
</think>

The catharsis theory suggests that engaging in aggressive acts can reduce the inclination to engage in further aggression, as it provides a release for pent-up emotions. This idea is often referred to as "venting." However, research does not support this claim; in fact, studies indicate that acting aggressively may actually increase future aggression by reinforcing the behavior. Among the given options, the one that aligns with what the catharsis theory states is:

**G: Aggressive act reduces inclination to engage in other aggressive acts.**

This is the correct answer because it directly reflects the catharsis theory's claim, even though research does not support it.

Answer: G
