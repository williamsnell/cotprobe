We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.
"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place."

Okay, so I've got this history question here about the Progressive Party and the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913. Hmm, let me try to think through this. 

First, I remember that the Progressive Party, also known as the Bull Moose Party, was formed in 1912. They were all about progressive reforms, right? Their platform emphasized things like social justice, equal opportunity, and government being for the people. The quote given talks about using the nation's resources and institutions for the general interest and setting public welfare first. So, they were probably against policies that favored big businesses or special interests over the common people.

Now, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff. I think that was a Democratic tariff reduction. Wait, wasn't that during Woodrow Wilson's presidency? Oh right, the Underwood Tariff was passed in 1913, which lowered tariffs. I remember that lower tariffs were a Democratic stance because higher tariffs were seen as benefiting corporations and the wealthy, while lower tariffs could help consumers by reducing prices.

But wait, what about the Progressives? They were a third party, right? They had Teddy Roosevelt as their candidate in 1912. I think Roosevelt's platform was about trust-busting and more government regulation. So, they were against monopolies and for the common man. 

So, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a Democratic initiative. The question is whether Progressives would endorse it. Progressives were generally in favor of lower tariffs because high tariffs were seen as helping big businesses, which they opposed. So, if the tariff was lowering rates, Progressives might support it. But wait, the options might have more nuance.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's "Square Deal". The Square Deal was about fairness, so maybe they'd support lower tariffs as fair. But I'm not sure if they specifically endorsed this tariff.

Option B: Yes, because the tariff promoted industrial justice. Industrial justice sounds like part of the Progressive platform. Lower tariffs could reduce prices for consumers, which helps workers, promoting industrial justice.

Option C: No, because the tariff did not promote equal opportunity. Hmm, I'm not sure. Lower tariffs might help equal opportunity by making goods cheaper, but maybe the Progressives wanted more than just tariff changes.

Option D: No, because the tariff was seen as a perversion of the Constitution's intent. I don't think the tariff itself was constitutional issue; it's more about economic policy.

Option E: Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties. Well, the Democrats did, but does that mean Progressives would endorse it? Progressives might have aligned on some points with Democrats, but were they the same?

Option F: No, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson. Wait, that's possible. The Progressive Party split from the Republicans, and Wilson was a Democrat. But the tariff was a Democratic policy; would Progressives oppose it just because it's Wilson's? Or would they support it if it aligns with their values.

Option G: No, because the Progressive party was against any form of taxation. No, that's not right. Progressives weren't against all taxes; they wanted fairer taxes, like maybe more progressive income taxes, not necessarily against tariffs entirely.

Option H: No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's "New Nationalism". Wait, what's New Nationalism? I think Roosevelt's New Nationalism was about a strong federal government regulating the economy. So, if the tariff was lowering rates, I'm not sure how that ties into New Nationalism. Maybe Progressives under Roosevelt would have their own economic policies, which might not align with the Democratic tariff.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Underwood-Simmons Tariff lowered tariffs, which was a Democratic approach. The Progressives, especially under Roosevelt, were more about regulating business and maybe not so much about free trade. But I'm not sure if they would endorse a Democratic tariff reduction.

Alternatively, I remember that the Progressive Party's platform might have included tariff reform, but I'm not certain if they specifically supported lower tariffs. They wanted to break up trusts and monopolies, which high tariffs might protect. So, lower tariffs would help consumers but might hurt certain industries. 

Wait, the Progressive platform in 1912 did include tariff reform as one of their goals. They wanted to reduce tariffs to decrease the cost of living for the average person. So, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff, which lowered tariffs, would align with that.

But wait, the Underwood-Simmons was a Democratic measure. So even if the Progressives agreed with the policy, would they endorse a Democratic tariff? Or would they be against it because it's from the opposing party?

Alternatively, maybe the Progressives were more focused on other issues, like direct primaries or women's suffrage, and the tariff was a secondary issue.

Looking back at the options, option B says yes because it promoted industrial justice. Industrial justice would mean fair wages and working conditions. Lower tariffs could lead to cheaper goods, which helps workers. So the Progressives would support it for that reason.

Option E says yes because Democrats wanted lower duties. But the question is about Progressives, not Democrats. So E might not be the right reason.

Option H says no because of New Nationalism. If New Nationalism was more about regulation and a strong central government, perhaps the tariff was seen differently. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The Underwood Tariff also had a revenue aspect. It lowered tariffs and instituted a small income tax. Progressives often supported income taxes as a more progressive form of taxation. So maybe they would support the tariff because it included that.

But the question is about whether they would endorse the tariff itself. The main point is that the tariff was lowering rates, which aligns with Progressive goals of helping the common man by reducing prices.

So, looking at the options again, option B says yes because it promotes industrial justice. That seems plausible.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: the Progressive Party in 1912 was led by Roosevelt, who had his own ideas. Maybe the party was more focused on breaking up trusts than on tariffs. So perhaps they didn't have a strong stance on the tariff, but the party platform likely included tariff reform.

Alternatively, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was passed by Democrats, and the Progressives were a separate party, so maybe they didn't endorse it. But the question is whether they would generally endorse it, not whether they voted for it.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: the Underwood Tariff was part of Wilson's New Freedom policies, which aimed to lower tariffs and break up trusts. The Progressives, especially under Roosevelt, had their New Nationalism, which was a bit different but also aimed at regulating big business.

Wait, the Progressive platform from 1912 does mention the need to secure equal opportunity and industrial justice. So lower tariffs would fit into that because they reduce the cost of goods, helping the average person.

So, the answer would be yes, because the tariff promoted industrial justice, which is option B.

The Progressive Party of 1912, led by Theodore Roosevelt, was committed to principles of social justice, equal opportunity, and industrial justice. Their platform emphasized the need to prioritize public welfare and combat special interests, particularly those that benefited corporations and the wealthy at the expense of the common man. High tariffs were often seen as favoring big businesses, while lower tariffs could reduce prices for consumers and promote fairness.

The Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913, a Democratic initiative under Woodrow Wilson, lowered tariffs and aligned with the Progressive goal of reducing the cost of living for the average person. This policy could be seen as promoting industrial justice, a key tenet of the Progressive platform, by helping workers and consumers. While the Progressives were a separate party and may not have explicitly endorsed the Democratic measure, the tariff's objectives align with their values.

Considering the options:

- **Option A** ties endorsement to Teddy Roosevelt's "Square Deal," which emphasized fairness, but it does not directly address the tariff's alignment with Progressive goals.
- **Option B** correctly identifies that the tariff promoted industrial justice, a core Progressive value.
- **Option C** suggests the tariff did not promote equal opportunity, which contradicts the potential benefits of lower tariffs for consumers.
- **Option D** incorrectly frames the tariff as a constitutional issue, which was not the focus of Progressive criticism.
- **Option E** links endorsement to Democratic support, but the question asks about Progressive views, not Democratic alignment.
- **Option F** incorrectly assumes opposition based on anti-Wilson sentiment, but the tariff's merits should be evaluated independently.
- **Option G** falsely claims Progressives opposed all taxation, while they actually advocated for fairer taxation.
- **Option H** ties opposition to Roosevelt's "New Nationalism," but this does not directly conflict with the tariff's goals.

The most accurate answer is **Option B**, as the tariff's reduction of duties aligns with the Progressive commitment to industrial justice and public welfare.

Answer: B
