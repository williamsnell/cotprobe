Alright, so I've got this question about Phil Jackson and which NBA team he played for before he became a coach. Hmm, okay, let's think this through. I remember that Phil Jackson is a really famous coach, especially with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. But the question is about his playing career, not his coaching.

Wait, Phil Jackson played in the NBA before coaching, right? I think he was a player before moving into coaching. So which team was that? I'm trying to recall. I know the New York Knicks have been around a long time, and I think he might have played for them.

Let me think about the options. The options are from A to J, with A being New York Knicks. I remember hearing that Phil Jackson played for the Knicks. Wasn't he part of their roster in the 70s or something? Maybe during the time when they had some success, like the early 70s perhaps.

Wait, but I also remember that sometimes players have longer careers, so maybe he played for another team too, but the question is asking which of the following he played for. So looking at the options, A is Knicks, B is Celtics, C is 76ers, D is Spurs, E is Warriors, F is Rockets, G is Lakers, H is Pistons, I is Bulls, J is Heat.

I think the Knicks are the correct answer here. I don't recall him playing for the Bulls or Lakers as a player because those are more associated with his coaching career. So he played for the Knicks, and then later coached the Bulls and Lakers to multiple championships.

I'm pretty confident it's the Knicks, so the answer should be A.

The answer is A: New York Knicks.
