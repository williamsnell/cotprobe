Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the mean weight of a sample of rats. The weights given are 2 lbs, 3 lbs, 6 lbs, 8 lbs, and 9 lbs. Hmm, I remember that the mean is like the average, right? So I think I need to add up all these weights and then divide by how many there are.

Let me start by adding them up. Let's see, 2 plus 3 is 5. Then 5 plus 6 is 11. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, I think I should add each one step by step. So 2 + 3 = 5. Then 5 + 6 = 11. Then 11 + 8 = 19. Oh wait, no, that's not right because 11 plus 8 should be 19? Wait, 11 plus 8 is 19. Then 19 plus 9 is 28. So the total weight is 28 pounds.

Now, how many rats are there? Let me count. There are five weights: 2,3,6,8,9. So that's five rats. So to find the mean, I divide the total by the number of samples. So 28 divided by 5. Let me do that calculation. 5 times 5 is 25, so 5 times 5.6 is 28. Because 5 times 5 is 25, plus 5 times 0.6 is 3, so 25+3=28. So 28 divided by 5 is 5.6.

Looking back at the options, option F is 5.6 lbs. So the mean weight should be F.

Wait, just making sure I added correctly. Let me add the numbers again. 2 +3 is 5, plus 6 is 11, plus 8 is 19, plus 9 is 28. Yep, that's correct. And 28 divided by 5 is indeed 5.6. So the answer must be F.

To find the mean weight of the sample of rats, we first sum their weights: 2 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 28 lbs. There are 5 rats in total. Dividing the total weight by the number of rats gives 28 รท 5 = 5.6 lbs. 

The correct answer is F: 5.6 lbs.
