The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A uniformed United States Park Policeman pulled over a motorist for going through a red light. The man reacted gruffly, telling the officer that he had no authority to stop him. There was a brief scuffle, and the officer issued two more charges, for disorderly conduct and failure to obey an officer. Eventually, the defendant pled guilty to the red light citation and the other two charges were dismissed. He then filed a federal court action against the park policeman in which he asserted a Bivens civil rights claim for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The first legal theory was that the park officer lacked authority to stop the plaintiff on a New York street and arrest him for a state traffic violation. He claimed that the officer was outside of his federal park land jurisdiction. Will the court likely uphold the authority of the park police under these facts?

Options:

A: The U.S. Park Police officer was within his rights to make an arrest, but he had to immediately transfer the defendant to state police.
B: The officer was within his authority to make the arrest, but only because the defendant acted in a disorderly manner and failed to obey an officer.
C: Federal officers, including the U.S. Park Police, cannot make arrests for state law violations under any circumstances.
D: The officer's authority to make an arrest depends on the specific agreement between the federal park system and the state of New York.
E: The federal officer is allowed to arrest for homicide and serious felonies but cannot make traffic arrests within a state's geographical jurisdiction.
F: The federal officer was way outside his scope of authority and he clearly cannot make an arrest outside of the confines of the federal park systems.
G: All federal officers can make arrests for all criminal offenses within a state's geographical jurisdiction under the priority status of federal law and federal law officers.
H: The U.S. Park Police have the authority to make a warrantless arrest for a state law violation because of statutory grants of authority from the various states.
I: All U.S. Park Police officers have nationwide jurisdiction and can make arrests for any offenses, regardless of whether they occur on federal or state land.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the authority of a U.S. Park Police officer. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

So the situation is that a Park Policeman pulled over a motorist in New York for running a red light. The driver was gruff and questioned the officer's authority. There was a scuffle, and the officer added charges for disorderly conduct and failure to obey. Later, the defendant pled guilty to the red light citation, and the other charges were dropped. Now, he's suing the officer in federal court under a Bivens claim for false arrest and malicious prosecution. His main argument is that the Park Police officer didn't have the authority to stop him on a New York street for a state traffic violation because he was outside his federal park jurisdiction.

The question is whether the court will uphold the officer's authority. So I'm looking at the options A through I and trying to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to understand the legal framework here. U.S. Park Police are federal law enforcement officers, right? Their primary jurisdiction is over federal parks and properties. But what happens when they're off those areas? Do they have authority to enforce state laws elsewhere?

I remember that federal law enforcement officers generally have authority to make arrests for federal offenses anywhere, but when it comes to state laws, their authority might be more limited. However, I think there's something about them being able to assist state and local police, maybe under certain conditions.

Wait, there's this concept of "concurrent jurisdiction." If a state and the federal government have an agreement, federal officers might be able to enforce state laws. Or perhaps under the doctrine of "arrests in aid of a state officer," but I'm not too sure about that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the officer was within his rights but had to transfer the defendant immediately to state police. I'm not certain about that requirement. I don't recall if federal officers must immediately hand over someone to state authorities when making a state arrest.

Option B suggests the arrest was valid only because of the disorderly conduct and failure to obey. But the initial stop was for a red light, which is a state traffic violation. So this option seems to ignore the initial authority to stop for the traffic violation.

Option C claims federal officers can't make arrests for state law violations under any circumstances. That doesn't sound right. I think they can in certain situations, like with mutual agreements or assisting local police.

Option D says the officer's authority depends on a specific agreement between the federal park system and New York. That sounds plausible. I think some federal agencies have memoranda of understanding with states that allow their officers to enforce state laws beyond federal property.

Option E states that federal officers can arrest for serious felonies like homicide but not for traffic offenses. That might be the case, but I'm not sure if it's a general rule. Maybe it depends on the specific laws or agreements.

Option F argues the officer was outside his authority entirely because it wasn't on federal park land. But I think there are situations where federal officers can act off federal property, especially if assisting or under an agreement.

Option G claims all federal officers can arrest for any state offense anywhere because federal law takes priority. That seems too broad. I don't think federal officers have unlimited authority to enforce state laws everywhere.

Option H says Park Police can make arrests for state violations due to statutory grants from states. So if the state has authorized federal officers to enforce their laws, then yes. That makes sense, but I'm not sure if that's a general rule or only under specific circumstances.

Option I suggests Park Police have nationwide jurisdiction. I don't think that's accurate. Their jurisdiction is probably more limited, perhaps to their specific areas unless there's an agreement.

So, considering all this, the correct answer probably revolves around whether the Park Police had authority based on an agreement with the state. So looking back, option D says it depends on a specific agreement between the federal park system and New York. That seems right because without such an agreement, the officer might not have authority to enforce state traffic laws off federal land.

But wait, I remember that some federal officers, like the Park Police, have authority under the Assimilated Crimes Act or other federal statutes that allow them to enforce state laws in certain areas. Or maybe it's under 16 U.S.C. ยง 1a-6, which gives them authority to make arrests and enforce laws within units of the National Park System. But if the stop was outside the park, maybe they don't have that authority unless there's a mutual aid agreement.

So if New York and the federal government have an agreement allowing Park Police to enforce traffic laws in the state, then the officer's actions would be valid. If not, then the arrest might be seen as outside his authority.

So the answer would be D: The officer's authority depends on the specific agreement between the federal park system and the state of New York.

The question revolves around whether a U.S. Park Police officer had the authority to stop and arrest a motorist on a New York street for a state traffic violation. The defendant argued that the officer lacked jurisdiction outside federal park land, but the key issue is whether federal officers can enforce state laws under specific circumstances.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Federal officers do not necessarily need to immediately transfer a defendant to state police after making an arrest for a state violation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The validity of the arrest depends on the initial authority to stop for the traffic violation, not just the subsequent charges.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Federal officers can make arrests for state law violations under certain conditions, such as with state agreements or when assisting local law enforcement.
- **Option D**: Correct. The officer's authority to enforce state laws likely depends on a specific agreement between the federal park system and the state of New York.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While federal officers may have limited authority for certain offenses, this option oversimplifies the rules for traffic violations.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Federal officers can act outside federal property under specific agreements or circumstances.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Federal officers do not have unlimited authority to enforce state laws everywhere.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While statutory grants of authority exist, they are not universally applicable without specific agreements.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. U.S. Park Police do not have nationwide jurisdiction to enforce all offenses.

The correct answer is **D**, as the officer's authority to enforce state laws depends on whether there was a specific agreement between the federal park system and New York State.

**Answer: D**
