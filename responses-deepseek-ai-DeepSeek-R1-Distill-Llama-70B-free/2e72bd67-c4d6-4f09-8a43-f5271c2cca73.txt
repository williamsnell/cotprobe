Okay, so I've got this problem about bacterial growth. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that the bacteria increase at a rate proportional to the number present. Oh right, that sounds like exponential growth. I remember that exponential growth can be modeled by the equation N(t) = N0 * e^(kt), where N0 is the initial population, k is the growth rate, and t is time. Or wait, sometimes it's written as N(t) = N0 * (b)^t, where b is the growth factor. Hmm, which one should I use here?

The question gives me that the initial population is 200, and it triples in 10 hours. So N0 is 200, and after t=10 hours, N(t)=600. I need to find the number after 24 hours, which is a full day.

Maybe I should first find the growth rate, k. Let's go with the exponential model. So using N(t) = N0 * e^(kt).

At t=10, N=600. So plugging in:

600 = 200 * e^(k*10)

Divide both sides by 200: 3 = e^(10k)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(3) = 10k

So k = ln(3)/10. Let me calculate that. I know ln(3) is about 1.0986, so 1.0986 /10 is approximately 0.10986 per hour.

Now, I need to find N(24). So plug t=24 into the equation.

N(24) = 200 * e^(0.10986 *24)

Calculate the exponent: 0.10986 *24 = approximately 2.6366.

e^2.6366 is about... Let me think. e^2 is about 7.389, and e^0.6366 is approximately e^0.6 is 1.822, and e^0.6366 is a bit higher. Maybe around 2.0? Wait, wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, 2.6366 is close to 2.636. Let me see, e^2.636. Alternatively, maybe I can break it down. Wait, 2.6366 is actually ln(14), because ln(14)=2.639, so approximately that. So e^2.639 is 14. So e^2.6366 is a bit less, maybe around 13.9 or so.

So N(24)=200 * approximately 14. That would be 2800. But wait, looking at the options, I see option D is 2793, which is close. But let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait another approach: maybe using the doubling time formula. Oh wait, but the problem says the population triples, not doubles. But perhaps using the same idea.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to model it using the continuous growth formula, but perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, like using the rule of 72 or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the initial approach gave me approximately 2800, which matches option D. But let me try using the other growth model, the discrete one. Because sometimes, problems like this use the formula N(t) = N0 * (growth factor)^(t). 

Wait, in 10 hours, it triples, so the growth factor is 3^(1/10) per hour. So the formula would be N(t) = 200*(3)^(t/10).

So for t=24 hours, it's N(24)=200*(3)^(24/10) = 200*(3)^2.4.

What's 3^2.4? Let's compute that. 3^2=9, 3^0.4 is approximately... Let me think. 3^0.5 is sqrt(3)=1.732. So 0.4 is a bit less than that.

I can use logarithms. 3^x = e^(x ln3). So 0.4 * ln3 ≈ 0.4 *1.0986≈0.4394. e^0.4394 is about 1.552. So 3^0.4≈1.552.

So 3^2.4 =3^2 *3^0.4≈9 *1.552=13.968.

So N(24)=200 *13.968≈2793.6, which is approximately 2794. Option D is 2793, which is very close. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me try to compute 3^0.4 more precisely. Let me use natural logs.

Let me compute 3^0.4.

Take ln(3)=1.098612289.

Multiply by 0.4: 0.4394449156.

Now, e^0.4394449156.

I can compute e^0.43 as approx 1.5365, e^0.44≈1.5527. Wait, 0.43944 is between 0.43 and 0.44. Let's estimate.

Hmm, using Taylor series perhaps, but maybe I should just accept that it's approximately 1.552.

So 9 *1.552 is 13.968, so 200 *13.968=2793.6, so 2794, which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another approach is to see how many 10-hour periods are in 24 hours. There are 2 full periods (20 hours) and 4 hours left.

So after 10 hours: 200 *3=600.

After 20 hours: 600*3=1800.

After 24 hours, that's 4 more hours. So now, the population increases from 1800 over 4 hours. But the rate is proportional, so we need to find the growth factor for 4 hours.

Wait, the growth is continuous, so the formula is still N(t) = N0 e^(kt), right? So for t=24, it's better to compute it all at once, but perhaps breaking it down:

After 20 hours, it's 1800. Now, the next 4 hours: the growth rate is k= ln3/10 per hour. So k=0.10986 per hour.

So for 4 hours, the growth factor is e^(0.10986 *4) = e^0.43944, which is the same as 3^0.4, which we've calculated as about 1.552. So 1800 *1.552=?

1800 *1.5 is 2700, 1800 *0.052=93.6, so total 2700+93.6=2793.6. Same as before.

So the approximate number is 2794, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option D is 2793, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

The problem involves bacterial growth modeled by exponential growth. The initial population \( N_0 = 200 \) triples in 10 hours, so \( N(10) = 600 \). The goal is to find the population after 24 hours.

Using the exponential growth formula:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot e^{kt}
\]

At \( t = 10 \), \( N(10) = 600 \). Substituting:

\[
600 = 200 \cdot e^{10k}
\]

Dividing through by 200:

\[
3 = e^{10k}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(3) = 10k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \frac{\ln(3)}{10} \approx 0.10986 \, \text{per hour.}
\]

Now, calculate \( N(24) \):

\[
N(24) = 200 \cdot e^{0.10986 \cdot 24}
\]

First, compute the exponent:

\[
0.10986 \cdot 24 \approx 2.6366
\]

Then, \( e^{2.6366} \approx 14 \). Thus:

\[
N(24) = 200 \cdot 14 = 2800
\]

To refine the calculation, note that \( 2.6366 \approx \ln(14) \), so \( e^{2.6366} \approx 14 \). This gives \( N(24) \approx 2800 \). However, using a more precise calculation for \( e^{2.6366} \), the result is approximately 13.968, leading to:

\[
N(24) = 200 \cdot 13.968 \approx 2793.6
\]

This matches option D, which is 2793. Thus, the approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day is:

**D: 2793**
