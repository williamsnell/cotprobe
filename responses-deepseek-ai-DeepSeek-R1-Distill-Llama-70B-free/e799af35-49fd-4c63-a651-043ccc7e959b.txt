Okay, so I've got this problem about a journal bearing, and I need to find the temperature under two conditions: when it's self-cooled and when it's externally cooled. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding the problem.

The bearing has a diameter of 3 inches and a length of 3 inches. It's installed in a housing with enough air passages, which probably means it's well-ventilated. The shaft is rotating at 100 rpm and exerts a load of 1200 lbs on the bearing. The coefficient of friction is 0.025, and the surrounding air is at 60°F.

So, part (a) is self-cooled, meaning it's air-cooled. Part (b) is externally cooled with a coolant flowing at 1 lb/min, specific heat 0.45 Btu/lb°F, and it leaves at 60°F. I need to calculate the bearing temperature for both scenarios.

First, I remember that the heat generated by friction in the bearing needs to be dissipated. The bearing temperature will rise until the heat loss equals the heat generated.

For part (a), self-cooled, the heat will be lost through convection to the surrounding air. The formula for heat loss is Q = h*A*(T_b - T_air), where h is the convection coefficient, A is the surface area, T_b is the bearing temperature, and T_air is the ambient.

But wait, I need to find the heat generated first. Friction power is torque multiplied by angular velocity. Torque is the frictional force times the radius. The frictional force F is μ*N, where N is the normal force, which here is the load. So F = μ * W, where W is the load.

So F = 0.025 * 1200 lbs = 30 lbs. Torque τ = F * r, where r is the radius. The diameter is 3", so radius is 1.5". So τ = 30 * 1.5 = 45 in-lbs.

Angular velocity ω is 100 rpm. To convert to radians per second: 100 rpm * (2π rad / 60 s) ≈ 10.472 rad/s.

Power P is τ * ω. So P = 45 in-lbs * 10.472 rad/s. Wait, but what's the unit conversion here? Because 1 hp is 550 ft-lbs/s, but I might need to convert in-lbs to ft-lbs first.

Alternatively, perhaps using consistent units. Let me see. Let's compute P:

45 in-lbs = 45/12 ft-lbs = 3.75 ft-lbs. Multiply by 10.472 rad/s (since torque is in ft-lbs and angular velocity in rad/s, the product would be ft-lbs/s, which is equivalent to horsepower times 550, but perhaps it's easier to calculate in watts or Btu.)

Wait, maybe I should compute the power in horsepower. Alternatively, convert everything to consistent units.

Alternatively, I can compute the heat generated in Btu per minute or per hour, since the cooling might be using Btu units.

Wait, let's think in terms of power in watts. 1 Watt = 1 N·m/s. Let me see:

Torque τ is 45 in-lbs. Let's convert that to N·m. 1 lb is approximately 4.44822 N, and 1 inch is 0.0254 meters.

So τ = 45 lb-in = 45 * 4.44822 N * 0.0254 m = 45 * 0.113 N·m ≈ 5.085 N·m.

Angular velocity ω = 100 rpm = 100 * (2π/60) ≈ 10.472 rad/s.

Power P = τ * ω ≈ 5.085 * 10.472 ≈ 53.3 Watts.

Wait, but 53.3 Watts is about 0.0716 horsepower. Alternatively, I can compute the power as:

Power (W) = (Torque in N·m) * (angular velocity in rad/s) → so that's correct.

Now, convert that to Btu per hour because the cooling part uses Btu. 1 Watt is approximately 3.41214 Btu/h. So 53.3 W * 3.41214 ≈ 182 Btu/h.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat generated in horsepower and then convert. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, using imperial units:

Torque τ = 45 in-lbs.

Power P = τ * rpm * (1 min/60 s) * (1/(12 in/ft)) * (1 hp/(550 ft-lbs/s)).

Wait, that might get messy. Alternatively, let me compute in horsepower.

Power (hp) = (Torque (ft-lbs) * rpm) / (550 * 12) * (1/(60)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in watts as I did before.

So P ≈ 53.3 W. To Btu per hour: 53.3 * 3.41214 ≈ 182 Btu/h, which is about 3.03 Btu/min.

Wait, no, 182 / 60 ≈ 3.03 Btu per minute. Wait no: 53.3 W is 53.3 * 3.41214 = 182 Btu/h, which is 182/60 ≈ 3.03 Btu per hour? Wait, no, wait: 1 Watt is 3.41214 Btu/h, so 53.3 W is 53.3 * 3.41214 ≈ 182 Btu/h, so per minute that's 182 / 60 ≈ 3.03 Btu/min.

Wait, no. Wait, 53.3 W is 53.3 * 3.41214 Btu/h. So 53.3 * 3.41214 = approximately 182 Btu/h, which is 182 divided by 60 minutes gives about 3.03 Btu per minute. Wait no, that's not right. Because 53.3 W is power, so per hour it's 53.3 * 3.41214 = 182 Btu in an hour. So per minute, that's 182 / 60 ≈ 3.03 Btu per minute.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

1 Watt = 1 Joule per second = 3.41214 Btu/h.

So 53.3 W is 53.3 * 3.41214 ≈ 182 Btu per hour.

So in one hour, the bearing generates 182 Btu of heat.

But for part (a), when it's self-cooled by air, the heat loss is Q = h*A*(T_b - T_air).

Wait, but what is h, the convection coefficient? I don't have that value given. Hmm, perhaps I need to make an assumption or find a typical value.

Wait, the problem says the housing has a sufficient number of air passages, so it's probably well-ventilated. For air cooling with natural convection, h is typically around 5 to 15 W/m²K. But since we're working in imperial units, maybe 1 to 3 Btu/(h·ft²·°F).

Wait, because 1 W/m²K is approximately 0.176 Btu/(h·ft²·°F). So 5 W/m²K is about 0.88 Btu/(h·ft²·°F), and 10 W/m²K is about 1.76.

So perhaps assuming h is about 1.5 Btu/(h·ft²·°F) for natural convection in air, which is a reasonable estimate.

The surface area A of the bearing: the bearing is a journal, which is a cylinder. The surface area is the lateral surface area, which is 2πrL.

r is diameter/2, 1.5 inches, which is 0.125 feet. Length L is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet.

So A = 2 * π * 0.125 ft * 0.25 ft = 2 * π * 0.03125 ≈ 0.19635 square feet.

So A ≈ 0.196 ft².

So the heat loss Q is h*A*(T_b - T_air). This must equal the heat generated, which is 182 Btu/h.

So 182 = h * A * (T_b - 60°F).

Solving for T_b:

h = 1.5 Btu/(h·ft²·°F),
A = 0.196 ft².

So 182 = 1.5 * 0.196 * (T_b -60)

Calculate 1.5 * 0.196 = 0.294.

So 182 = 0.294*(T_b -60)

T_b -60 = 182 / 0.294 ≈ 619.4 °F.

Wait, that would make T_b = 60 + 619.4 = 679.4°F. That's way too high. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Because the power is 53.3 W, which is 53.3 J/s. So per hour, that's 53.3 * 3600 ≈ 192,000 J/h. Converting to Btu: 192,000 J/h / 1055.06 ≈ 182 Btu/h. That part seems correct.

Wait, but the heat loss per hour is h*A*(T_b - T_air). So if the bearing is generating 182 Btu per hour, and the heat loss is 1.5 * 0.196 * (T_b -60), which is 0.294 (T_b -60). So 0.294 (T_b -60) = 182 → T_b -60 = 182 / 0.294 ≈ 619 → T_b ≈ 679°F. But that's impossible because the options are all under 160°F. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Ah, wait a second. The bearing's surface area is much larger than I thought. Wait, the bearing is in a housing with air passages, so perhaps the housing's surface area is what's relevant, but the problem refers to the bearing itself. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula for the convection.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat generated in horsepower and then use another approach.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the heat generated per unit time is equal to the friction torque times angular speed. So power P = torque (in lb-ft) times rpm times 2π/(60*12), because torque is in lb-ft, rpm is per minute, and converting to radian per second and ft-lb to lb-ft.

Wait, this might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for power generated by a bearing: P = (μ * W * D * N) / (2 * 12), where μ is the friction coefficient, W is the load in lbs, D is diameter in inches, N is rpm.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me check the formula.

I think the general formula for power loss in a bearing is P = (μ * W * D * π * N) / (12 * 60), where W is the load, D is diameter in inches, N is rpm, and P is in horsepower.

So plugging in the numbers: μ = 0.025, W=1200 lbs, D=3 inches, N=100 rpm.

So P = (0.025 * 1200 * 3 * π * 100) / (12 * 60).

Calculate numerator: 0.025 * 1200 =30. 30 *3=90. 90* π≈282.743. 282.743 *100=28274.3.

Denominator: 12 *60 =720.

So P = 28274.3 /720 ≈ 39.26 horsepower.

Wait, that can't be right. 39 horsepower seems way too high for a 3" bearing. That would generate a lot of heat, leading to high temperatures. But the options are up to 160°F, which is plausible.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula I'm trying to recall is for the power loss in bearings, which is P = (μ * W * D * N) / (2 * 12 * 60). Because torque is μ*W*D/2 (since torque is force times radius, and radius is D/2), and power is torque times angular speed in radians per second.

Wait, let's compute torque first:

Torque τ = μ * W * (D/2) → D is 3 inches, so radius is 1.5 inches. So τ = 0.025 * 1200 * 1.5 = 45 in-lbs.

Now, convert τ to lb-ft: 45 in-lbs = 45/12 = 3.75 lb-ft.

Angular speed in radians per second: 100 rpm = (100 * 2π) /60 ≈ 10.472 rad/s.

Power P (in ft-lb/s) = τ * ω = 3.75 lb-ft * 10.472 rad/s ≈ 39.255 ft-lb/s.

Convert to horsepower: 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s. So P ≈ 39.255 /550 ≈ 0.0714 hp.

That's more reasonable. So about 0.0714 horsepower.

Now, convert that to Btu per hour. 1 hp = 2544.43 Btu/h. So 0.0714 hp * 2544.43 ≈ 181.8 Btu/h. Which matches my earlier calculation of around 182 Btu/h.

So the heat generated is 182 Btu per hour.

Now, for part (a), the bearing is self-cooled, meaning the heat is dissipated by natural convection to the surrounding air. So Q = h*A*(T_b - T_air) = 182 Btu/h.

We need to find h, the convection coefficient. Let's assume natural convection for a horizontal cylinder. The formula for h depends on the Grashof and Prandtl numbers, but for an approximate calculation, I can use a typical h value for air cooling.

From tables, for natural convection from a horizontal cylinder (like a pipe), with air at room temperature, h is typically in the range of 2-5 W/m²K, but let's convert that to imperial units.

1 W/m²K ≈ 0.176 Btu/(h·ft²·°F). So 2 W/m²K ≈ 0.353, 5 W/m²K ≈ 0.88.

Since the housing has sufficient air passages, perhaps h is on the higher end, say 0.8 Btu/(h·ft²·°F).

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the bearing isn't just a cylinder; perhaps the housing's surface area is larger. But the problem refers to the bearing's dimensions, which are 3" diameter and length. So the surface area would be the lateral surface of the bearing.

So A = 2πrL. Diameter is 3", so r=1.5". Length L=3".

Convert r and L to feet: 1.5" = 0.125 ft, 3" = 0.25 ft.

A = 2 * π * 0.125 * 0.25 ≈ 0.19635 ft².

So, A ≈ 0.196 ft².

Now, Q = h*A*(T_b - T_air) = 182 Btu/h.

Plugging in h=0.8 Btu/(h·ft²·°F),

0.8 * 0.196 * (T_b -60) =182.

0.1568 * (T_b -60) = 182.

T_b -60 = 182 / 0.1568 ≈ 1161.5 °F.

That gives T_b = 60 + 1161.5 ≈ 1221.5°F, which is way too high. That can't be right because the options are way lower.

I must be doing something wrong here. Maybe I'm using the wrong h value. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be using the bearing's surface area plus the housing's area, but the problem states the housing has sufficient air passages, so maybe the effective area is larger. But the problem only gives the bearing's dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the units for h. Let me double-check the conversion.

Yes, 1 W/m²K = 0.176 Btu/(h·ft²·°F). So if h is 5 W/m²K, that's 5 * 0.176 = 0.88 Btu/(h·ft²·°F). But using h=0.88 gives:

0.88 * 0.196 * (T_b -60) =182.

So 0.172 (T_b -60) =182 → T_b =60 + (182/0.172) ≈60 +1059 ≈ 1119°F. Still way too high.

Wait, this can't be right. Clearly, I must be missing something. Maybe the problem expects to neglect the natural convection and instead compute using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the heat generated is being underestimated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the bearing's length is 3 inches, and diameter 3 inches, but the actual surface area in contact with air is larger. Alternatively, maybe the formula for heat generated is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the temperature rise using the formula ΔT = (P)/(h*A), where P is the power in watts, and h and A in appropriate units.

Wait, but that's what I did. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the heat generation rate and cooling rate differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T_b = T_air + (Q/(h*A)). So T_b = 60 + (182)/(h*0.196). But I need to find h.

Wait, maybe I can find h using the Nusselt number for a cylinder. The Nusselt number Nu = h*D/k, where k is thermal conductivity of air.

But to find Nu, I need the Reynolds number Re, which depends on air velocity. But since it's natural convection, the velocity is induced by the temperature difference, making it more complicated.

Alternatively, for natural convection around a horizontal cylinder, the average Nusselt number can be approximated using the formula:

Nu = 0.36 + 0.072 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/6), for 10^3 < Gr*Pr < 10^9.

The Grashof number Gr = (g * β * q'' * D^3) / (ν^2), where q'' is heat flux (Q/A).
