Okay, so I've got this question about Epicurus and his view on death. Hmm, I remember that Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher, the founder of Epicureanism. From what I recall, Epicureanism is a school of thought that emphasizes the pursuit of moderate desires as a way to attain happiness and avoid physical pain and mental distress.

Wait, the question is asking about how Epicurus conceives of death. I think he had some specific ideas about death, maybe something to do with the soul and the body. Oh right, I remember something about atoms. Epicurus believed that the soul is made up of very fine atoms, right? And when a person dies, these atoms disperse. So, if the soul is just atoms that break apart, then death would mean the end of the soul. 

But what does that imply about death itself? I think he argued that once we die, we cease to exist. So, death is the end of all sensations and experiences. Because if the soul is gone, there's no consciousness or feeling anymore. That makes sense because if there's no soul, there's nothing to experience anything after death.

So, the question is asking which option matches that. Let's look at the options again. Option G says "the deprivation of all sensation." That sounds right because if you're dead, you can't feel anything anymore. 

I should double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A says death is the greatest harm. Wait, didn't Epicurus say something about death not being bad because once you're dead, you can't experience any suffering? So, he wouldn't see it as a harm. 

Option B is an illusion, but I don't think that's right. He didn't say death doesn't exist; he acknowledged it as the end. Option C is transformation into a higher being, which sounds more like Plato or some religious views, not Epicurus. 

Option D is part of a rebirth cycle, which relates to reincarnation, but Epicureanism doesn't believe in that. They thought the soul dissolves. Option E is eternal suffering, which is more like the Christian concept of hell, I think. 

Option F, ultimate bliss, doesn't fit because that's more like a heavenly state, not what Epicurus taught. Option H is the final stage of life, which is vague but doesn't capture the specific idea. Option I is the beginning of the afterlife, which again, Epicurus didn't believe in an afterlife. Option J is a stage to reach enlightenment, which is more Buddhist or something else.

So, the only one that fits is G: the deprivation of all sensation. Because Epicurus believed that when you die, your soul breaks apart, and you can't feel anything anymore.

Epicurus conceives of death as the end of existence, where the soul, composed of fine atoms, disperses, leading to the cessation of all sensation and consciousness. This aligns with the idea that death is the deprivation of all sensation.

Answer: G
