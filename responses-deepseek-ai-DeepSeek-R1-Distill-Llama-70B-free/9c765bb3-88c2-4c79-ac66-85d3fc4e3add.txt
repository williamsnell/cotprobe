Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question says that an atom remains in an excited state for 10^-8 seconds, and I need to find the uncertainty in the energy of that state. The options are A through J, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from my studies. Oh right, the principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like energy and time, can be known simultaneously. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, so in this problem, the time given is 10^-8 seconds. I guess that's the Δt here. But wait, is it the uncertainty in time or the lifetime of the excited state? I think when an atom is in an excited state for a certain time, that time is related to the uncertainty in energy. So here, Δt would be 10^-8 seconds.

Now, I need to plug this into the equation to find ΔE. Let me write down the formula again: ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Because I think the minimum uncertainty is when ΔE * Δt equals ħ/2, so solving for ΔE gives me (ħ/2) / Δt, but wait, sometimes the approximation is written as ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt) or maybe without the two. I might be getting that mixed up.

Wait, let's get the exact formula right. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(4π), but sometimes it's approximated as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. Or maybe I'm confusing it with another form. Wait, I think the precise inequality is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2), that's the more correct version. So if we're calculating the minimum uncertainty, it's ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

Alternatively, I've heard it presented as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, dropping the 2 and the factor. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe the commonly used approximation in such problems is ΔE ≈ ħ / (Δt). So perhaps I should proceed with that.

But wait, let me get the exact value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-27 erg seconds. Then, ħ is h divided by 2π, so ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg s.

Okay, so if I use ΔE ≈ ħ / (Δt), then substituting the numbers: ΔE = (1.0545718e-27 erg s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-19 ergs.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match that. Let me see the options again.

Options: 

A: 7.5e-20

B:8e-18

C:1e-17

D:6.6e-21

E:6.6e-19

F:5e-19

G:6.6e-20

H:6.6e-18

I:4.4e-19

J:9.9e-20

Hmm, my calculation gave about 1.05e-19 ergs. None of the options exactly match that. Oh wait, but perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle's energy-time form is often written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the correct formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt).

So let me recalculate with that correction. So ΔE = (1.0545718e-27 erg s) / (2 * 1e-8 s).

That would be 1.0545718e-27 / (2e-8) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-19 = approx 0.527e-19, which is 5.27e-20 ergs.

Wait, but that's 5.27e-20, which is 5.3e-20. Looking at the options, option G is 6.6e-20, which is larger. Option D is 6.6e-21, which is smaller. Hmm, not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value of ħ. Let me recalculate with exact numbers.

ħ = h/(2π) = 6.62607015e-27 erg s / (2 * 3.1415926535) ≈ 6.62607015e-27 / 6.283185307 ≈ let's compute that.

6.62607015 /6.283185307 ≈ approximately 1.0545718, so 1.0545718e-27 erg s.

So when I compute ħ/(2Δt), it's (1.0545718e-27) / (2 * 1e-8) = 1.0545718e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-19 = 0.5272859e-19 = 5.272859e-20 ergs.

So approximately 5.27e-20 ergs. Looking at the options, G is 6.6e-20, which is about 25% higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the formula used in the problem doesn't include the factor of 2. Maybe the question assumes ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, not ħ/(2). So if I just take ħ/Δt, that would give 1.05e-19, which is about 1e-19. But looking at the options, option E is 6.6e-19, which is much higher. Wait, that's about 6.6e-19, which is 6.6 times higher than my 1e-19.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1e-8 seconds is the Δt. So 1e-8. So if I compute 1.05e-27 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-19. So without the factor of 2, that's 1.05e-19. But none of the options match that exactly.

Looking at the options again: option E is 6.6e-19, option F is 5e-19, option I is 4.4e-19, G is 6.6e-20, which is ten times less than E.

Hmm. I'm getting 5.27e-20 when I include the 2 factor, and 1.05e-19 without. Neither matches the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe it's ΔE = ħ * (1/Δt), but let me think again. Oh wait, I might have miscalculated the exponents. Let me compute this again carefully.

ΔE = ħ / (2Δt) => (1.0545718e-27 erg s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-27 / 1e-8 = 0.5272859e-19 erg.

Wait, 1e-27 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-19. So yes, 5.27e-20.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for ħ or h. Let me try using h instead of ħ. Wait, if I use h instead, that would be 6.626e-27 erg s divided by 2π times Δt. Wait, no, that's the same as using ħ. So that shouldn't change anything.

Wait another approach: perhaps the formula used here is ΔE = h/(2π Δt). Because ħ is h/(2π), so substituting, ħ = h/(2π). So the formula is (h/(2π)) / (2Δt) )? Wait, no, the formula is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt), which is (h/(2π)) / (2Δt) = h/(4π Δt).

Wait, but that can't be. Let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in energy-time form is often written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty is when ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, so using that, ΔE = (1.0545718e-27 erg s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) ) = 5.27e-20 erg.

But again, looking at the options, the closest is G:6.6e-20, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1.05e-27 divided by 2e-8.

Wait, 1e-27 / 1e-8 is 1e-19. So 1.05e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.05/2) * 1e-19 = 0.525e-19 = 5.25e-20.

Hmm. So the correct answer should be approximately 5.25e-20 ergs.

But looking at the options, option G is 6.6e-20, which is about 25% higher. None of the other options are close. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the approximation without the factor of 2, so let's see that.

If I compute without the 2, ΔE = 1.05e-19 ergs. The closest option to that is option F:5e-19, which is about half. Or option I:4.4e-19, which is 4.4e-19. Hmm, 1e-19 is 10 times smaller than 1e-18, which is option E:6.6e-19. Wait, no, 1e-19 is 0.1e-18. So 6.6e-19 is 0.66e-18, which is larger than 1e-19.

Wait, perhaps the question used a different value for Planck's constant. Let me check the exact value. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.62607015 × 10^-27 erg seconds. ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg s.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses 1e-27 for ħ, which would be incorrect, but just for the sake of checking. If ħ is approximated as 1e-27, then ΔE would be 1e-27 / (2 *1e-8) = 5e-20, which is 5e-20. But that's still not matching the options, as option G is 6.6e-20.

Wait, perhaps the problem used h instead of ħ. Let me see what happens if I use h. So if I mistakenly use h instead of ħ, then:

ΔE = h/(2Δt) = (6.626e-27 erg s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) ) = 6.626e-27 / 2e-8 = 3.313e-19 ergs. But that's 3.3e-19, which is not an option either. The closest is option F:5e-19, option E:6.6e-19.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used was ΔE = h/(Δt * 2π). Let's try that.

h = 6.626e-27, Δt=1e-8.

So ΔE = 6.626e-27 / (2 * 3.1416 * 1e-8) ) = 6.626e-27 / (6.2832e-8) ) = approximately 1.0545e-19 ergs. Which brings us back to the same number as before. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, but assuming that's not the case, maybe I'm missing something else. Oh! Wait, maybe the time given is 1e-8 seconds, and I should compute the uncertainty in energy as ΔE = ħ / (2Δt). So with ħ as 1.05457e-27, that's 1.05e-27 / (2 * 1e-8) = 5.27e-20. So that's 5.27e-20. But none of the options match that exactly. The closest is option G:6.6e-20, but that's about 25% higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a rounded value of ħ as 1.0e-27 erg s. Let me try that. So 1.0e-27 / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 5e-20. Still, that's 5e-20, which isn't any of the options. Hmm.

Looking again at the options, option E is 6.6e-19, which is ten times higher than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, when I compute 1.05457e-27 divided by 2e-8, that's 1.05e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.05 / 2) * (1e-27 / 1e-8) )= 0.525 * 1e-19 = 5.25e-20. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using natural units where ħ is taken as 1, but that doesn't make sense here because the units are in ergs and seconds, so ħ must be in those units.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the closest option is G:6.6e-20, but that's 6.6e-20, which is about 25% higher than my calculated 5.25e-20. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, could it be that the time is 1e-8 seconds, and I should compute in terms of ergs? Let me think again. So, the formula is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) = (1.05457e-27 erg s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) = (1.05457e-27) / 2e-8 = (1.05457 / 2 ) * 1e-19 = 0.527e-19 = 5.27e-20 ergs. So 5.27e-20 ergs.

Looking at the options again, G is 6.6e-20, which is about 6.6 times 1e-20. So 6.6e-20. My calculation is about 5.27e-20. Hmm, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the correct value of ħ. Let me check the exact value. The exact value of ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-27 erg s. So if I compute 1.0545718e-27 / (2 * 1e-8) = 5.272859e-20 ergs.

But none of the options match this exactly. So perhaps the intended approach was to use the approximation without the factor of 2. Let's try that.

If ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt = 1.05e-27 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-19 ergs. But that's 1.05e-19, which is not among the options. The closest is option E:6.6e-19, which is about six times higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for ħ. For example, if ħ is taken as 6.6e-27 erg s, then ΔE = 6.6e-27 / (2e-8) = 3.3e-19 ergs. But that's 3.3e-19, which isn't an option either.

Wait, maybe the question uses h instead of ħ. Let me see. If I use h = 6.626e-27 erg s, then ΔE = h/(2Δt) = 6.626e-27 / (2e-8) = 3.313e-19. Again, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the formula without the 2, so ΔE = h/(Δt * 2π). Let's compute that. h is 6.626e-27, so (6.626e-27) / (2 * 3.1416 * 1e-8) ) = 6.626e-27 / 6.2832e-8 = approximately 1.0545e-19 ergs. Which is the same as using ħ. So that brings me back again.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's look at the options again. Option E is 6.6e-19 ergs, which is 6.6 times larger than my 1.05e-19 (which is without the 2 factor). So perhaps the question assumes that ΔE Δt = ħ, without the 2, so that ΔE = ħ / Δt = 1.05e-19 ergs. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the relation ΔE = h/(Δt), so using h instead of ħ. Let me compute that. h is 6.626e-27 erg s. So 6.626e-27 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-19 ergs. That's 6.6e-19, which is option E.

Ah! So perhaps the question used the formula ΔE = h/Δt, without considering the factor of 2π (since ħ = h/(2π)), which would be incorrect according to the Heisenberg principle. But maybe that's what the question expects.

So if I calculate ΔE as h / (Δt), that gives 6.626e-27 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-19 ergs, which is approximately 6.6e-19, which is option E.

But wait, the Heisenberg principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so using h/Δt would be incorrect. But perhaps
