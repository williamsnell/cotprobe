Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the cost of hiking boots and the selling price. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

The question says that a pair of hiking boots costs $25 to produce. The company, Sure-grip Shoe Co., wants to sell them for 15% more than the cost. The question is asking for the manufacturer's increase over the cost. Hmm, I think that means the profit they make, right?

Wait, wait. So the cost is $25. They want to sell it for 15% more than that. So I need to calculate 15% of $25 and then add that to the cost to get the selling price. Or wait, is the increase just the 15% part, without adding it to the cost? Let me think.

The question is specifically asking for the manufacturer's increase over the cost. That should just be the amount added to the cost, which is 15% of $25. So I don't need to calculate the selling price, just the increase part.

So 15% of 25. How do I calculate that? Well, percentage calculations can be a bit tricky sometimes, but I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. 

15% as a decimal is 0.15. So I multiply 25 by 0.15. Let me do that: 25 * 0.15. Hmm, 25 times 0.1 is 2.5, and 25 times 0.05 is 1.25. So adding those together, 2.5 + 1.25 gives 3.75. So the increase is $3.75.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes I get confused whether to multiply by the percentage or do something else. So another way to think about it: 10% of 25 is 2.5, so 5% would be half of that, which is 1.25. So 15% is 10% +5%, which is 2.5 +1.25=3.75. Yep, same result.

Looking at the options, I see option J is $3.75. So that should be the correct answer.

The cost to produce the hiking boots is $25. The Sure-grip Shoe Co. wants to sell them for 15% more than the cost. To find the increase, we calculate 15% of $25:

\[
15\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.15 \times 25 = 3.75
\]

Thus, the manufacturer's increase over the cost is **$3.75**.
