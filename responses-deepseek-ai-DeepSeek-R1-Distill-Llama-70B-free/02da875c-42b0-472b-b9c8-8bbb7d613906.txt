Okay, so I've got this question about a logical fallacy. The statement is, "The universe, like a watch, must have a maker." And I need to choose the correct fallacy from the options A to D. Hmm, I remember that there are several types of fallacies, so I should probably think through each option to see which one fits.

First, the statement is comparing the universe to a watch. A watch is something that we know is made by a maker because it's a complex object designed for a specific purpose. So the argument is saying that since the universe is complex, it must also have a maker, just like the watch does. This is a classic example of an analogy being used to make a point about something more complex.

Now, looking at the options. Option A is Fallacy of Accident. I think that's when someone applies a general rule to a specific case without proper justification. Like, just because something is usually true doesn't mean it applies in every situation. But I'm not sure if that's what's happening here. The argument isn't about applying a general rule to a specific case; it's more about drawing a parallel between two things.

Option B is Questionable Analogy. That sounds relevant because the argument uses an analogy between the universe and a watch. A questionable analogy would be when the comparison isn't strong enough or the two things aren't actually similar in the relevant ways. The universe and a watch are both complex, but maybe the comparison doesn't hold because one is a human-made object and the other is the entire cosmos. So maybe the analogy isn't valid, making this the fallacy.

Option C is Questionable Cause. This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because two things are related, one must be the cause of the other. For example, correlation doesn't imply causation. But in this case, the argument isn't about causation in that sense. It's more about inferring a maker based on complexity, so maybe it's not the best fit.

Option D is Fallacy of Composition. This happens when someone assumes that what's true for a part is true for the whole. Like, if every part of a car is made of metal, the whole car is made of metal. But that's not directly what's happening here. The argument isn't about parts and wholes; it's about comparing two separate entities based on their characteristics.

So, putting it all together, the statement uses an analogy between the universe and a watch to argue for a maker. The issue is whether the analogy is strong enough. Watches have known makers, but does that mean the universe must too? The criticism would be that the analogy is questionable because the two aren't sufficiently similar in the relevant aspects. Therefore, the fallacy here is a Questionable Analogy, which is option B.

The statement "The universe, like a watch, must have a maker" uses an analogy to argue that the universe requires a creator because of its complexity, similar to how a watch requires a maker. This comparison is an example of drawing a parallel between two entities. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Fallacy of Accident**: This occurs when a general rule is misapplied to a specific case. The argument here isn't about applying a general rule but rather about using an analogy.
- **B: Questionable Analogy**: This fallacy happens when the comparison between two things lacks sufficient relevance or similarity. The analogy between the universe and a watch is problematic because, while both are complex, the universe is not a human-made object, making the comparison weak.
- **C: Questionable Cause**: This involves assuming causation based on correlation. The argument isn't about causation but rather about inferring a maker based on complexity.
- **D: Fallacy of Composition**: This occurs when assuming what's true for a part is true for the whole. The argument isn't about parts and wholes but about comparing two separate entities.

The correct fallacy is **Questionable Analogy** because the comparison between the universe and a watch is flawed due to insufficient similarity in relevant aspects.

Answer: B
