Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the fugacity of carbon dioxide using the reduced Berthelot equation. Hmm, I remember that fugacity is a measure of the chemical potential of a gas, and for real gases, it's not the same as the pressure because they don't behave ideally.

The equation given is z = (PV)/(RT) = 1 + [9/(128)] * [(PT_c)/(P_c T)] * [1 - 6*(T_c²/T²)]. Wait, I need to make sure I get the equation right. So z is the compressibility factor here. Right, because for ideal gases, z is 1, but real gases deviate.

The problem gives T_c as 304.3 K and P_c as 73.0 atm. The conditions we're looking at are T = 150°C and P = 50 atm. Oh wait, I need to convert that temperature to Kelvin because the critical temperature is given in K. So 150°C is 423.15 K.

So the first step is to calculate the reduced temperature (T_r) and reduced pressure (P_r). T_r is T / T_c, and P_r is P / P_c. Let me calculate those.

T_r = 423.15 K / 304.3 K ≈ 1.390. Hmm, let me do exact division: 423.15 / 304.3. Let me see, 304.3 times 1.39 is about 423.0 something. So approximately 1.390.

P_r = 50 atm / 73.0 atm ≈ 0.6849. Let me compute it more precisely: 50 /73 = approximately 0.6849315.

Now, the equation for z is given. Let me plug in the numbers. So z = 1 + (9/128) * (P_r T_c) / (P_c T) [Wait, no, looking again, the term after 1 is [9/(128)] * [(PT_c)/(P_c T)] * [1 - 6*(T_c^2/T²)].

Wait, the term (PT_c)/(P_c T) can be rewritten as (P/P_c) * (T_c / T) = (P_r) * (1 / T_r). Because T_c/T = 1 / T_r, since T_r = T/T_c.

So the term becomes (P_r) * (1 / T_r). Then the whole term is (9/128) * (P_r / T_r) * [1 - 6*(1 / T_r²)].

Wait, let me think again. The term (T_c^2)/(T^2) is (T_c / T)^2. Since T_c / T is (1 / T_r), so (T_c^2)/(T^2) = 1 / T_r². So the term inside the brackets is [1 - 6/(T_r²)].

So putting it all together, z = 1 + (9/128) * (P_r / T_r) * [1 - 6/(T_r²)].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute T_r and P_r again.

T = 150°C = 423.15 K.

T_r = T / T_c = 423.15 / 304.3 ≈ 1.390.

P_r = 50 /73 ≈ 0.6849.

Now compute (P_r / T_r) = 0.6849 / 1.390 ≈ 0.4928.

Next, compute the term in brackets: [1 - 6/(T_r²)].

T_r squared is (1.390)^2 ≈ 1.932. So 6/(1.932) ≈ 3.106. So 1 - 3.106 = -2.106. Wait, that's negative. So the term is -2.106.

Now, multiply (9/128) * (P_r / T_r) * [1 - 6/(T_r^2)].

So 9/128 is approximately 0.0703125.

Multiply that by (P_r / T_r) = 0.4928: 0.0703125 * 0.4928 ≈ 0.03462.

Then multiply by [bracket term] which is -2.106: 0.03462 * (-2.106) ≈ -0.0729.

So z ≈ 1 + (-0.0729) = 0.9271.

Wait, that's the compressibility factor. So z = PV/(RT) = 0.9271.

Wait, but wait, I thought z is used to find the fugacity. Fugacity f is given by f = P * exp( ∫ (z-1)/P dP from 0 to P ), but that's at constant temperature. Alternatively, I think for the Berthelot equation, there's another approach. Alternatively, I remember that for the fugacity coefficient, φ, which is f/P, is calculated using the equation ln φ = (1/(RT)) ∫ (V - RT/P) dP from 0 to P, but that's for real gases.

Wait, perhaps the Berthelot equation gives the fugacity directly. Alternatively, perhaps the fugacity coefficient can be found using the z equation.

Wait, the fugacity f is equal to φ P, where φ is the fugacity coefficient. And the fugacity coefficient can be found using the compressibility factor. The formula is ln φ = ∫ (z-1)/P dP from 0 to P, at constant T.

But integrating z with respect to P would require knowing z as a function of P. Alternatively, for the Berthelot equation, perhaps there's a specific expression for the fugacity.

Wait, another approach. I think for the Berthelot equation, the fugacity coefficient can be calculated using an equation derived from the compressibility factor. Let me look up the general formula.

Wait, I think the general expression is ln φ = (2a)(b + 2a) term, but for the given z equation, perhaps it's better to use the virial expansion approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation for fugacity can be derived from the equation of state. Since the equation is given in terms of z, perhaps using the formula:

ln φ = (z-1) - ln z.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The fugacity coefficient is given by the integral from 0 to P of (z-1)/P dP.

So, with z expressed as a function of P, I can compute the integral.

Given that z = 1 + [9/(128)] * (P T_c)/(P_c T) [1 - 6 (T_c^2)/(T²)].

Wait, let me re-express this z equation in terms of P. Let me write z as:

z = 1 + A * P,

where A is [9/(128)] * [T_c/(P_c T)] * [1 - 6 (T_c²)/(T²)].

So z = 1 + A P.

Then, the integral for ln φ becomes ∫ (z-1)/P dP from 0 to P.

So (z-1) = A P, so (z-1)/P = A.

Then, the integral from 0 to P of A dP is A P.

So ln φ = A P.

So φ = exp(A P).

But wait, let me make sure. When z = 1 + A P, then (z-1) = A P. So (z-1)/P = A. The integral of A dP from 0 to P is A P.

So ln φ = A P.

So φ = exp(A P).

Hmm, that seems manageable.

Let me compute A. A is [9/(128)] * [T_c/(P_c T)] * [1 - 6 (T_c^2)/(T^2)].

Wait, T is 423.15 K, T_c is 304.3 K.

So let's compute each part of A.

First, compute [T_c/(P_c T)]:

T_c = 304.3 K, P_c = 73.0 atm, T =423.15 K.

So T_c/(P_c T) = (304.3) / (73.0 * 423.15) ≈ 304.3 / (30871.05) ≈ 0.00986 atm⁻¹.

Wait, let me compute 73 *423.15. 73 *400 is 29,200. 73 *23.15 is about 73*23=1679, 73*0.15≈11, so total ≈1679 +11=1690. So 29,200 + 1,690 = 30,890. So 73 *423.15 ≈30871.05. So 304.3 / 30871.05 ≈ 0.00986 atm⁻¹.

Next, compute [1 -6 (T_c²)/(T^2)].

T_c² = (304.3)^2 ≈ 92,600 (exact value: 304.3 * 304.3 = let me compute 300^2=90,000, 4.3^2=18.49, and cross terms 2*300*4.3=2580. So total 90,000 +2580 +18.49=92598.49.

T^2 is (423.15)^2 ≈ (approx 423^2=178,929, and 0.15^2 is 0.0225, so about 178,929.0225). So 423.15² ≈ 178,929.0.

So (T_c²)/(T^2) =92598.49 /178929.0 ≈ 0.5178.

So 6 * (T_c²/T²) =6 *0.5178≈3.1068.

So [1 - 3.1068] = -2.1068.

Now, A = (9/128) * [0.00986] * [ -2.1068 ].

Compute each multiplication step.

9/128 ≈ 0.0703125.

Multiply by 0.00986: 0.0703125 * 0.00986 ≈ 0.000693.

Then multiply by -2.1068: 0.000693 * (-2.1068) ≈ -0.00146.

So A ≈ -0.00146.

Wait, but with the units? Because P is in atm, A is in (unitless, I think). Because when you multiply by P (in atm), you get a unitless term for the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units. Let me think: z is unitless. So the term [9/(128)] is unitless. [T_c/(P_c T)] has units of (K) / (atm * K) )= 1/atm. So [T_c/(P_c T)] has units of 1/atm. Then [1-6(T_c²/T²)] is unitless. So the entire term after 1 is (unitless) * (1/atm) * P (atm), because (PT_c)/(P_c T) is (atm * K) / (atm * K) ) = unitless. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in breaking down the equation.

Wait, the term in the equation is [ (PT_c) / (P_c T) ].

So P is in atm, T_c in K, P_c in atm, T in K.

So (PT_c)/(P_c T) = (atm * K) / (atm * K) )= unitless. So the entire factor is 9/128 times a unitless term times another unitless term. So z is unitless.

Therefore, when I computed A, it's [9/128] * [T_c/(P_c T)] * [1 -6 (T_c^2/T^2)].

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me recompute A correctly.

Compute each part again.

Compute [T_c/(P_c T)] = 304.3 / (73.0 * 423.15) = ?

Wait, 73 *423.15 = 73*(400+23.15) = 73*400=29,200; 73*23.15= approx 73*(20)=1460, 73*(3.15)=229.95. So 1460+229.95=1689.95. So 29,200 +1689.95=30,889.95.

So [T_c/(P_c T)] = 304.3 / 30,889.95 ≈ 0.00986 (as before).

Then [1 -6*(T_c^2/T^2)] = -2.1068 (as before).

So [9/128] = 0.0703125.

So A = 0.0703125 * 0.00986 * (-2.1068).

Let me compute 0.0703125 * 0.00986 first.

0.0703125 * 0.00986 = approximately 0.000693.

Then multiply by (-2.1068): 0.000693 * (-2.1068) ≈ -0.00146.

So A ≈ -0.00146.

Now, ln φ = A * P.

Because the integral was A * P.

So with P =50 atm,

ln φ = (-0.00146) *50 ≈ -0.073.

Then φ = exp(-0.073) ≈ 1 - 0.073 + (0.073^2)/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.9294.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Exp(-0.073) is approximately:

We know that exp(-x) ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x³/6 for small x.

x =0.073.

1 -0.073 = 0.927.

x² = 0.073^2 = 0.005329. Divided by 2: 0.0026645.

So 0.927 + 0.0026645 ≈ 0.92966.

x³ = 0.073^3 ≈ 0.000389. Divided by 6 ≈ 0.0000648.

So subtract that: 0.92966 - 0.0000648 ≈ 0.9296.

So φ ≈ 0.9296.

Thus, the fugacity f = φ * P = 0.9296 *50 atm ≈46.48 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 46.4 atm, which is very close. So the answer should be G.

To calculate the fugacity of carbon dioxide at 150°C and 50 atm using the reduced Berthelot equation, the following steps were taken:

1. **Convert Temperature to Kelvin**:  
   \( T = 150^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 423.15 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Calculate Reduced Temperature (\( T_r \)) and Reduced Pressure (\( P_r \)):**  
   Using \( T_c = 304.3 \, \text{K} \) and \( P_c = 73.0 \, \text{atm} \):  
   \[
   T_r = \frac{T}{T_c} = \frac{423.15}{304.3} \approx 1.390, \quad P_r = \frac{P}{P_c} = \frac{50}{73.0} \approx 0.6849.
   \]

3. **Express the Compressibility Factor (\( z \)) Using the Berthelot Equation**:  
   The given equation is:  
   \[
   z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{P T_c}{P_c T} \cdot \left[ 1 - 6 \cdot \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right].
   \]  
   Substituting \( \frac{P T_c}{P_c T} = P_r / T_r \) and \( \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} = 1 / T_r^2 \), the equation becomes:  
   \[
   z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{P_r}{T_r} \cdot \left[ 1 - \frac{6}{T_r^2} \right].
   \]

4. **Compute Each Term**:  
   - \( \frac{P_r}{T_r} = \frac{0.6849}{1.390} \approx 0.4928 \),  
   - \( \frac{6}{T_r^2} = \frac{6}{(1.390)^2} \approx 3.106 \),  
   - \( 1 - \frac{6}{T_r^2} = 1 - 3.106 = -2.106 \).  

   Substituting these into the equation for \( z \):  
   \[
   z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \cdot 0.4928 \cdot (-2.106).
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \frac{9}{128} \approx 0.0703125 \), then:  
   \[
   z = 1 + 0.0703125 \cdot 0.4928 \cdot (-2.106) \approx 1 - 0.0729 = 0.9271.
   \]

5. **Calculate the Fugacity Coefficient (\( \phi \))**:  
   The fugacity coefficient is related to \( z \) by:  
   \[
   \ln \phi = \int_0^P \frac{z-1}{P} \, dP.
   \]  
   For the given \( z \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   \ln \phi = A \cdot P,
   \]  
   where \( A = \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{T_c}{P_c T} \cdot \left[ 1 - \frac{6 T_c^2}{T^2} \right] \).  

   Substituting values:  
   - \( \frac{T_c}{P_c T} = \frac{304.3}{73.0 \cdot 423.15} \approx 0.00986 \),  
   - \( 1 - \frac{6 T_c^2}{T^2} = -2.106 \),  
   - \( A = 0.0703125 \cdot 0.00986 \cdot (-2.106) \approx -0.00146 \).  

   Thus,
