Question:

Research has shown that people who read a job description written only with male pronouns (e.g., he, his) are more likely to think of an employee as male than people who read a description that uses gender-neutral language (e.g., he or she). This finding is most closely linked to

Options:

A: the linguistic relativity hypothesis.
B: gender schema theory.
C: the social role hypothesis.
D: modeling.

Okay, so I've got this question here about psychology, specifically related to how language affects perceptions of gender in job descriptions. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my classes.

The question says that when job descriptions use only male pronouns like "he" and "his," people are more likely to imagine the employee as male compared to when gender-neutral language is used, like "he or she." The finding is linked to one of the given theories.

The options are A through D: linguistic relativity hypothesis, gender schema theory, social role hypothesis, and modeling. 

First, I should probably break down each option to understand which one fits best.

Option A: Linguistic relativity hypothesis. I remember that this theory suggests that the language we speak influences the way we think. Like, if a language has specific words for colors, people might perceive those colors differently. But does this relate to pronouns affecting gender perception? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the closest fit.

Option B: Gender schema theory. Oh right, gender schema theory is about how people organize information based on gender. Schemas are like mental frameworks that help us categorize information. So when we read job descriptions with male pronouns, our gender schema might lead us to think of a man because that's the schema we're activating. That sounds relevant because it's about how the language primes certain gendered mental structures.

Option C: Social role hypothesis. This hypothesis, as I recall, is about how different social roles (like different jobs) are perceived as more suited to one gender. For example, nursing might be seen as a female role. But the question is more about the pronouns influencing the imagery rather than the role itself fitting a gender. So maybe this isn't the best fit.

Option D: Modeling. Modeling is a concept from Bandura's social learning theory. It's about learning behaviors by observing and imitating others. I don't see a direct link here because the question is about language influencing perception, not about observing and imitating behavior.

So putting it together, the finding is about how pronouns (male) influence the perception of the employee's gender. Gender schema theory explains that using male pronouns activates the male schema, making people think of a male employee. The linguistic relativity is more about language affecting thought processes in general, but gender schema is more specific to gender-related cognitive structures.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: gender schema theory.

The question examines how the use of male pronouns in job descriptions influences people's perception of the employee's gender, linking this finding to a specific psychological theory. 

- **Option A (linguistic relativity hypothesis)** suggests that language influences thought, but it is more general and not specifically tied to gender perception.
- **Option B (gender schema theory)** explains how people organize information based on gender, with schemas acting as mental frameworks. Using male pronouns activates the male schema, leading to the perception of a male employee, making this the most relevant choice.
- **Option C (social role hypothesis)** focuses on how jobs are associated with specific genders, which is less directly related to the pronoun-induced imagery in the question.
- **Option D (modeling)** involves learning through observation, which does not apply to the language-perception link described.

The best fit is **gender schema theory**, as it directly addresses how language primes gendered mental structures, influencing perception.

Answer: B
