Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Anscombe criticizing Sidgwick. Hmm, I remember that Anscombe was a philosopher who wrote a lot about ethics, and she was quite critical of certain utilitarian approaches. Sidgwick is known for his work in ethics, especially his book "Methods of Ethics," where he defends utilitarianism, right?

Wait, the question is asking what Anscombe criticized Sidgwick for. From what I recall, Anscombe's famous article "Modern Moral Philosophy" was pretty critical of Sidgwick and others. She argued against the idea that morality can be based solely on consequences, which is consequentialism. So Sidgwick, being a consequentialist, would be a target for her.

Looking at the options, option A says he supports the principle of consequentialism. That sounds right because Sidgwick was a utilitarian, which is a form of consequentialism. So if Anscombe is against that, then A could be the reason.

But wait, let me think about the other options. Option B says he endorses the divine law conception. I think Sidgwick actually didn't go for that. He tried to base ethics on reason rather than divine command. So B might not be correct.

Option C says he claims a natural balance in the universe. I'm not sure about that. I think that's more of a concept from someone else, maybe like the idea of natural law or something else.

Option D is about the principle of double effect. I remember that the principle of double effect is more associated with Catholic moral theology, distinguishing between intended and foreseen consequences. Anscombe might have criticized Sidgwick for not considering this, but I'm not sure. Wait, Sidgwick was a utilitarian, so he probably didn't use that principle much because utilitarianism focuses on outcomes regardless of intent.

Option H says he doesn't distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. That ties into the principle of double effect. So if Sidgwick doesn't make that distinction, Anscombe might criticize him for that. But is that the main point she made?

Wait, I think Anscombe's main criticism was against Sidgwick's consequentialism. She argued that the concepts of morality that many philosophers used, like Sidgwick, were based on a law conception without a divine lawgiver, which she thought was problematic. But more specifically, she was against the idea that the rightness of an action is determined solely by its consequences.

So looking back, the options are A to J. The question lists options, and the correct answer would be the one that matches Anscombe's criticism.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to remember the key points. In her article, Anscombe argues that the concepts of moral obligation and duty are incoherent without a divine lawgiver. She criticizes philosophers like Sidgwick for employing these concepts without the necessary theological backing. But she also had issues with consequentialism.

Wait, another angle: Anscombe is known for promoting virtue ethics and criticizing utilitarian and deontological approaches. So if Sidgwick is a utilitarian, Anscombe would oppose his consequentialism. So option A seems correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is "all of the above." So if more than one option is correct, E would be the choice. But I'm not sure if all the options listed (A, B, C, D) are things Anscombe criticized Sidgwick for.

I think Sidgwick didn't endorse the divine law (option B), so B might not be correct. Option C, the natural balance, I'm not sure. Option D, the principle of double effect, which is about intention. Sidgwick, as a utilitarian, probably didn't focus on intentions, so he might not have believed in the principle of double effect. So D could be a point of criticism.

But wait, the principle of double effect is more about the permissibility of causing harm as a side effect versus intending it. So if Sidgwick doesn't consider that, Anscombe might have pointed that out. So option H says he doesn't distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. That's a key part of the principle of double effect. So if Sidgwick neglects that distinction, Anscombe would criticize him for that.

Wait, but then which options are correct? The question is phrased as "Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick on the grounds that:"

Looking at the options, A is about consequentialism. H is about not distinguishing between foreseen and intended consequences. So if the question is giving multiple points, perhaps more than one option applies.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and the answer choices are from A to J, with E being "all of the above," which would include A, B, C, D. But I don't think B and C are correct. So perhaps E is not the right answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H because Anscombe emphasizes the importance of intention and the distinction between intended and foreseen consequences, which is part of her critique of Sidgwick's consequentialism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to structure this.

Main points of Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick:

1. She argues against consequentialism, which Sidgwick supports. So option A is correct.

2. She criticizes the neglect of the concept of intention and the distinction between intended and foreseen consequences. So option H is correct.

3. Does she say anything about the principle of double effect? I think she does discuss that in the context of criticizing the failure to consider intention. So option D might not be correct because the principle of double effect is more of a Catholic teaching, but Sidgwick not believing in it might be a point.

Wait, but Sidgwick, as a utilitarian, would likely not believe in the principle of double effect because that principle is about the morality of actions where bad effects are foreseen but not intended. Utilitarians focus on overall consequences, not the intention behind the action.

So perhaps options A and H are both correct. But looking at the options, the only way both could be correct is if one of the options combines them. But the options are separate, so the question is whether the correct answer is A, H, or perhaps E if multiple apply.

Wait the options are A to J, and the question is what is the grounds of her criticism. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but the way the options are structured, E is "all of the above," but the above would be options A, B, C, D. But I'm not sure if all of those are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H because that's a specific point she makes about the failure to distinguish between types of consequences.

Wait, let me think about the exact content. In her "Modern Moral Philosophy," Anscombe does argue that the concepts like "ought" and "obligation" are only intelligible within a divine law framework, which Sidgwick and others don't accept. But she also criticizes the failure to consider intention and the nature of the action itself, which is tied to the principle of double effect.

So perhaps the main criticism is about Sidgwick's consequentialism (A) and his failure to consider the role of intention (H). But wait, the options don't combine A and H, so perhaps the question is looking for the best single option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I don't think so because I don't think all options A-D are correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the exact points. In her article, Anscombe says that Sidgwick's ethics are a "muddle" because he tries to combine different methods, but more importantly, she criticizes his utilitarian approach, which she sees as flawed because it doesn't account for the moral significance of intention and the nature of the act itself.

So, she would criticize Sidgwick for being a consequentialist (A) and for not distinguishing between intended and foreseen consequences (H). So the question is which of these is an option.

Looking back, the options are:

A: he supports the principle of consequentialism.

H: he does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one’s action.

So the question is whether the correct answer is A, H, or perhaps another option.

Wait, the question is asking which option is correct, and the options are A-J, with E being all of A-D.

I think the primary criticism is about consequentialism, so A is correct. But I'm also pretty sure that Anscombe's critique includes the point about intention and the failure to distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences, which would be option H.

So which one is the answer? The question is about what Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick for, and the options include A and H.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H because that's a specific point she makes, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the answer might be E if multiple options are correct, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I don't think all of A-D are correct.

Wait, another approach: looking up the exact criticism. From what I remember, Anscombe's main points against Sidgwick include his acceptance of consequentialism and his failure to consider the role of intention and the principle of double effect.

So in the options, A is correct, H is correct. But the options don't include a combination of A and H. So perhaps the answer is H, as that's a more specific criticism.

Wait, but the question is about the grounds of her criticism. So perhaps the answer is H because that's a specific point she makes, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, but I'm not sure because I don't think all of A-D are correct.

Wait, let me think again. The options are:

A: consequentialism

B: divine law

C: natural balance

D: principle of double effect

E: all of the above.

So E would mean A, B, C, D are all correct. But I don't think B and C are correct. So E is not the answer.

So the answer must be either A, H, or another option.

Wait, the options are A to J. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, maybe the answer includes both A and H, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but I think the primary criticism is against his consequentialism, so A is correct.

But I'm a bit torn. Maybe I should look for more clues.

Wait, another point: Anscombe's article is from 1958, and in it, she argues against the dominant ethical theories of her time, which were utilitarianism and deontological. She argues that both are flawed because they don't consider the concept of intention properly.

So she would criticize Sidgwick, a utilitarian, for not considering intention, which ties into option H. So H would be correct.

But she also criticizes his consequentialism, so A is correct.

Wait, but the question is looking for the grounds of her criticism, and the options are separate. So perhaps the answer is H because that's a specific point she makes beyond just consequentialism.

Alternatively, the answer could be both A and H, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is expecting H as the answer.

Wait, but the options are A-J, and the correct answer is among them. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I don't think so because options B and C are not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that would require all of A-D to be correct, which I don't think is the case.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The main points are that Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick for his consequentialism (A) and for not distinguishing between intended and foreseen consequences (H). Since the question asks for the grounds, and both A and H are correct, but they're separate options, perhaps the answer is both, but since that's not an option, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H because that's a specific aspect of her critique, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, but I don't think so. I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should go with H as the answer because that's a specific point she makes about intention, which is a key part of her critique beyond just consequentialism.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "on the grounds that," which might include multiple points. So if both A and H are correct, but they're separate options, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because it's a more specific criticism that Anscombe is known for.

I think I'll go with H as the answer.

Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick primarily for his adherence to consequentialism, as seen in his utilitarian approach, which she argues is flawed. Additionally, she critiques his failure to distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences, a key aspect of the principle of double effect, which she sees as essential for ethical decision-making. While Sidgwick's consequentialism (option A) is a significant point of criticism, Anscombe's emphasis on the importance of intention and the distinction between foreseen and intended consequences (option H) is a more specific and central aspect of her critique. Therefore, the best answer is:

H: he does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one’s action.

Answer: H
