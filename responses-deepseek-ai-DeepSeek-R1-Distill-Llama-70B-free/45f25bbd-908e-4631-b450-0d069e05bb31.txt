Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about psychological techniques, specifically in the context of treating someone who's obese. Hmm, I remember that different therapeutic approaches use various methods to change behavior. Let me try to break this down.

The question says: Asking an obese person to restrict eating to limited situations, like a specific place in the kitchen at particular times of the day. So the idea is to control when and where they eat. I think this is about setting boundaries on their eating habits.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which term matches this technique. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Counter conditioning. I recall that counter conditioning is a technique where you pair an unwanted behavior with a new, pleasant stimulus to replace the old response. Like, if someone fears dogs, they might be exposed to dogs while doing something enjoyable. But in this question, it's about restricting eating times, not pairing with a new stimulus. So maybe not A.

Option B: Response control. Response control sounds like it's about controlling the responses or behaviors. If you limit eating to certain times and places, you're controlling the response of eating. That might fit, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: Exposure therapy. Exposure therapy involves gradually exposing someone to the feared object or situation without any danger, helping them become desensitized. Like treating a fear of heights by exposing them to heights in a safe way. But this question is about restricting, not exposing, so probably not C.

Option D: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a broad approach that focuses on changing thought patterns and behaviors. It includes various techniques, but the specific method here is about restricting eating times, which might be a part of CBT but isn't the name of the technique itself. So D might not be the answer, but I'm not certain.

Option E: Aversive conditioning. This involves associating an unpleasant stimulus with an unwanted behavior to reduce it. For example, using a bitter-tasting substance on nails to stop biting them. The question doesn't mention anything unpleasant being associated with eating, just restricting when and where they eat. So probably not E.

Option F: Self-punishment. This is when someone punishes themselves for certain behaviors. Again, the scenario doesn't involve punishment, just restriction. So F isn't the right choice.

Option G: Self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is when individuals keep track of their behaviors, like writing down what they eat. The question is about restricting, not monitoring, so G doesn't fit.

Option H: Reinforcement control. This sounds like controlling the reinforcements or rewards given for behaviors. If you're only allowing eating at certain times, maybe it's about controlling positive reinforcement by limiting when rewards (food) are given. That could be a possibility. I need to think more about this.

Option I: Systematic desensitization. This is a type of exposure therapy where you gradually expose someone to an anxiety-provoking stimulus in a controlled manner. It doesn't seem related to the eating restriction scenario, so I can rule out I.

So, narrowing it down. The technique here is about controlling the situations under which a behavior occurs. So, response control (B) or reinforcement control (H). What's the difference between the two?

Response control would involve controlling the behavior itselfâ€”like only allowing eating at certain times. Reinforcement control would involve controlling the consequences (rewards) that follow the behavior. If you limit eating to specific times, you might be controlling the reinforcement by only allowing eating then, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Restricting eating to certain times and places sounds like establishing a routine or controlling the environment in which eating occurs. This might be a form of self-control strategy, perhaps under response control.

I think response control refers to limiting the circumstances under which a response (like eating) can occur. So by setting specific times and places, you're controlling the response. That would make option B the correct answer.

The question involves identifying the psychological technique where an obese person is asked to restrict eating to specific times and places. The key is to determine which term best describes this method of controlling behavior.

- **Counter conditioning (A):** Involves pairing an unwanted behavior with a new, pleasant stimulus. This does not fit, as the scenario focuses on restricting eating, not introducing a new stimulus.
- **Response control (B):** Refers to controlling the circumstances under which a behavior occurs. Restricting eating to specific times and places aligns with this definition, as it limits the conditions for the eating behavior.
- **Exposure therapy (C):** Involves gradual exposure to a feared stimulus. This is unrelated to the scenario, as the focus is on restriction, not exposure.
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (D):** A broader approach that includes various techniques. While this method might be part of CBT, it is not the specific term for restricting eating times.
- **Aversive conditioning (E):** Associates an unpleasant stimulus with an unwanted behavior. The scenario does not involve unpleasant associations, so this is incorrect.
- **Self-punishment (F):** Involves punishing oneself for certain behaviors. The scenario focuses on restriction, not punishment.
- **Self-monitoring (G):** Involves tracking behaviors, such as eating. The scenario is about restricting, not monitoring.
- **Reinforcement control (H):** Involves controlling rewards for behaviors. While this might indirectly relate, the focus here is on restricting the behavior itself, not the rewards.
- **Systematic desensitization (I):** A type of exposure therapy. This is unrelated to the scenario.

The most accurate term for restricting eating to specific times and places is **response control**, as it directly involves controlling the conditions under which the behavior occurs.
