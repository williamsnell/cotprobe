Okay, so I've got this question about a rectangular broad crested weir. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my hydraulics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The weir is 30 feet long, right? And the discharge coefficient is 0.7. The upstream water level is 2 feet over the crest. I need to find the discharge, and there are multiple choices provided.

Wait, I remember that the formula for discharge over a weir involves the coefficient, the length, and the head. Oh right, the general formula is Q = Cd * L * H^(3/2), but wait, I think that's for a V-notch weir. Or is it for a rectangular weir?

Wait no, for a rectangular weir, the formula is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2). Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the formula might be Q = Cd * L * H^(3/2) * (sqrt(2g)/2)? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the correct formula for a rectangular broad-crested weir is Q = Cd * L * H^(3/2) * (g^(1/2)) / something. Alternatively, perhaps it's Q = (Cd * L * H^(3/2)) * sqrt(2g) / something. Wait, I'm not getting this right.

Wait, I think for a broad-crested weir, the discharge is calculated using the formula Q = Cd * L * (2g)^(1/2) * H^(3/2). Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The standard formula for a rectangular weir is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2). Or maybe that's when the weir is a certain type. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is Q = Cd * L * (g * H^3)^(1/2). Hmm, that doesn't look right.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for a broad-crested weir is Q = (Cd * L * (2g)^(1/2)) * H^(3/2). Or is it different? I think I better clarify this.

Wait, I remember that the discharge over a broad-crested weir can be given by Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2). Oh wait, no, perhaps for a sharp-crested weir, the formula is different. Let me think: for a rectangular sharp-crested weir, the formula is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2). But wait, that might not be right either.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't do that right now because I'm just trying to think through this. Let me try to recall. Oh right, I think the correct formula for a rectangular broad-crested weir is Q = (Cd * L * sqrt(2g)) / 3 * H^(3/2). No, wait, that doesn't sound familiar.

Wait, another approach. The general formula for a broad-crested weir is Q = Cd * L * (g H^3)^(1/2) * (2/3). Or maybe it's Q = (2/3) Cd L sqrt(2g) H^(3/2). That rings a bell.

Alternatively, maybe it's Q = Cd * L * (2g H^3)^(1/2) * (1/3). Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should just jot down the variables and see.

Given variables:
- Length (L) = 30 ft
- Cd (discharge coefficient) = 0.7
- Head (H) = 2 ft

We need to compute Q in cfs (cubic feet per second).

Wait, I think the formula is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2).

Wait, let's break it down. The standard formula for a rectangular sharp-crested weir is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2). So for a broad-crested weir, perhaps the formula is different?

Wait, perhaps for a broad-crested weir, the formula is Q = Cd * L * sqrt(2g/3) * H^(3/2). No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is Q = Cd * L * (g^(1/2)) * H^(3/2) * something.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the general approach. The discharge over a weir is given by Q = Cd * A * v, where A is the area of the flow and v is the velocity. But that's too vague.

Alternatively, the formula for a broad crested weir is sometimes expressed as Q = (Cd * L * H^(3/2)) * sqrt(2g) / 3. Or perhaps, I've heard that the discharge equation for a broad-crested weir is Q = (2/3) * sqrt(2g) * Cd * L * H^(3/2).

Wait, let me compute this. Let's say the formula is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2).

So plugging in the numbers:

Cd = 0.7
L = 30 ft
H = 2 ft
g is 32.2 ft/s².

Compute each part step by step.

First, sqrt(2g) = sqrt(2 * 32.2) = sqrt(64.4) ≈ 8.026 ft^0.5/s.

H^(3/2) = (2)^(3/2) = 2 * sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828 ft^(3/2).

Now, let's compute the terms:

(2/3) * Cd * L = (2/3) * 0.7 * 30.

Calculate that: (2/3)*0.7 = approx 0.4667. Multiply by 30: 0.4667 *30 ≈ 14.0.

So, 14.0 multiplied by sqrt(2g) which is 8.026:

14.0 * 8.026 ≈ 112.364.

Then multiply by H^(3/2) which is 2.828:

112.364 * 2.828 ≈ Let's compute 112 * 2.828 first.

112 * 2.828: 100*2.828=282.8, 12*2.828≈33.936 → total ≈316.736.

So, approximately 316.736 cfs.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options start at 430, 450, etc. So I must have done something wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe for a broad-crested weir, the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: I've heard that for a broad-crested weir, the discharge can be calculated using Q = Cd * L * (2/3) * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2), which is what I did. But perhaps the correct formula doesn't have the 2/3 factor. Maybe it's just Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2) / something else.

Wait, maybe I should check the units. Let's see: Q should be in ft³/s.

Cd is dimensionless. L is in ft. H is in ft. So the term sqrt(2g) is in ft^0.5/s.

So when I multiply all together:

Cd (dimensionless) * L (ft) * sqrt(2g) (ft^0.5/s) * H^(3/2) (ft^(3/2)).

Multiplying the units: ft * ft^0.5/s * ft^1.5 = ft^(0.5 +1.5 +1) / s → ft^(3) / s → which is correct for Q (ft³/s).

So the formula with the (2/3) factor would give me 316.7 cfs, but that's not an option. So perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait another possibility: Maybe the formula is Q = Cd * L * (g H^3)^(1/2) * (2/3). Let's try that.

Compute g*H^3: 32.2 ft/s² * (2)^3 = 32.2 *8=257.6 ft³/s².

sqrt(257.6) ≈ 16.045 ft^(3/2)/s.

Multiply by (2/3): 16.045 * (2/3) ≈ 10.697.

Then multiply by Cd * L: 0.7 *30=21.

So 21 *10.697 ≈ 224.5 cfs. That's even smaller, so that can't be right. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the correct formula for a broad-crested weir is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * (2g H)^0.5 * H.

Wait, let me think differently. The general approach for a weir is that the flow rate depends on the head and the length. For a rectangular weir, the formula is often written as Q = (2/3) * C_d * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2). But perhaps for a broad-crested weir, the formula is different because the approach is subcritical, and the length is considered as the width.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is Q = Cd * (L) * (g H^3)^(1/2) * (2/3). Wait, let me compute that.

Again, H is 2 ft, so H^3 is 8. g is 32.2, so g H^3 = 32.2 *8 = 257.6.

sqrt(257.6) ≈ 16.045.

Then multiply by 2/3: 16.045 * (2/3) ≈10.697.

Multiply by Cd (0.7) and L (30): 0.7 *30 =21. 21 *10.697 ≈ 224.5 cfs. Again, too low.

Hmm, another possibility is that the formula uses H to the power of 5/4 or something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the formula with that of a triangular weir.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula Q = Cd * L * (2g)^(1/2) * H^(3/2) / 3. Let me try that.

So, (2g)^(1/2) = sqrt(64.4) ≈8.026.

H^(3/2)=2.828.

Multiply 8.026 *2.828 ≈22.627.

Divide by 3: ≈7.542.

Multiply by Cd * L: 0.7 *30=21. 21 *7.542≈158.48 cfs. Nope, even lower.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is Q = (Cd * L * H^(3/2)) * sqrt(g/(2)).

Wait, let's compute that. sqrt(g/2)=sqrt(16.1)≈4.012.

H^(3/2)=2.828.

Multiply 4.012 *2.828≈11.34.

Multiply by Cd* L=21 → 21*11.34≈238 cfs. Still too low.

I'm getting confused here. Let me think about the units again. The formula I have must produce the correct units, which it does. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula for a broad-crested weir is Q = (Cd * L) * ( (2/3) * sqrt(2g) ) * H^(3/2).

Wait, that's the same as before. So 0.7 *30 =21. 2/3 * sqrt(64.4)= 0.6667 *8.026≈5.35.

21 *5.35 ≈112.35.

Then multiply by H^(3/2)=2.828: 112.35*2.828≈316.7 cfs. Same result as before.

But the options don't have 316.7. The closest is option A:465, D:430, etc. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for a broad-crested weir is different. Oh wait, I think I might have confused it with the formula for a sharp-crested weir. Maybe for a broad-crested weir, the formula is Q = Cd * L * ( g^(1/2) ) * H^(3/2).

So let's try that. So Q = 0.7 *30 * sqrt(32.2) * (2)^(3/2).

Compute each part:

sqrt(32.2)=5.676 ft^0.5/s.

(2)^(3/2)=2.828 ft^(3/2).

So 0.7 *30 =21.

21 *5.676=119.256.

119.256 *2.828≈ Let's compute 119 *2.828 and 0.256*2.828.

119 *2.828: 100*2.828=282.8, 19*2.828≈53.732 → total 282.8+53.732=336.532.

0.256 *2.828≈0.725.

Total ≈336.532 +0.725≈337.257 cfs.

That's still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q = Cd * L * (2/3) * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2), which is what I did earlier, but the calculation gives me around 316 cfs, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute with the formula Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2).

So:

Cd =0.7, L=30, H=2.

Compute sqrt(2g)=sqrt(64.4)=8.025.

H^(3/2)=2.828.

Now, (2/3) * Cd * L = (2/3)*0.7*30.

Compute 0.7 *30=21. 21 * (2/3)=14.

So 14 *8.025=112.35.

Then multiply by H^(3/2)=2.828: 112.35 *2.828≈ Let's compute 112 *2.828 and 0.35*2.828.

112*2.828=316.736.

0.35*2.828≈0.9898.

Total around 316.736+0.9898≈317.725 cfs.

Still not matching the options. So maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q = Cd * L * (g^(1/2)) * H^(3/2) * (2/3).

Wait, let me compute that.

So (2/3) * Cd= (2/3)*0.7≈0.4667.

L=30 → 0.4667 *30≈14.

g^(1/2)=5.676.

H^(3/2)=2.828.

Multiply all together: 14 *5.676 *2.828.

First 14 *5.676=79.464.

79.464 *2.828≈ Let's calculate 79 *2.828=222.772, 0.464*2.828≈1.312. Total≈224.084 cfs.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Q = Cd * L * (2g)^(1/2) * H^(3/2) / 3.

So again, sqrt(2g)=8.025. H^(3/2)=2.828.

So 0.7 *30=21.

21 *8.025=168.525.

Divide by 3: 56.175.

Multiply by 2.828: 56.175 *2.828≈ Let's compute 56*2.828=158.768, 0.175*2.828≈0.495. Total≈159.263 cfs.

Nope.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the formula is Q = Cd * L * H^(3/2) * sqrt(2g/3). Let's try that.

So sqrt(2g/3)=sqrt(64.4/3)=sqrt(21.4667)=4.635 ft^0.5/s.

H^(3/2)=2.828.

Cd=0.7, L=30.

So 0.7 *30=21.

21 *4.635≈97.335.

97.335 *2.828≈ Let's compute 97*2.828=274.876, 0.335*2.828≈0.947. Total≈275.823 cfs.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Q = Cd * L * (2g H)^0.5 * (H/3). Let's compute that.

2g H = 64.4 *2=128.8.

sqrt(128.8)=11.348 ft/s.

H/3=2/3≈0.6667.

Multiply all: 0.7 *30=21.

21 *11.348≈238.308.

238.308 *0.6667≈158.87 cfs. No, that's not working.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the units again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for g. Wait, g is 32.2 ft/s², right? So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Q = (2/3) * Cd * L * (sqrt(2g)) * H^(3/2), but I'm not getting the right value. Let me try calculating it again with more precision.

Compute each step accurately:

Cd = 0.7
L = 30 ft
H = 2 ft
g = 32.2 ft/s²

sqrt(2g) = sqrt(2 *32.2) = sqrt(64.4) = 8.025 ft^0.5/s

H^(3/2) = (2)^(1.5) = 2 * sqrt
