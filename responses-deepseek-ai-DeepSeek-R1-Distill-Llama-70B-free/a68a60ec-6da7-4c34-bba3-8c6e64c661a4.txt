Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing, specifically about selecting a sample for a substantive test. Hmm, I need to figure out when an auditor would stratify the population. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what's stratification in sampling? From what I remember, stratification is dividing the population into subgroups or strata that share similar characteristics. This is usually done to make the sample more representative and increase the efficiency of the test. So the auditor would do this when the population has different segments that might behave differently or have varying risks.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts. Oh right, this sounds like when the population has large and small items. Stratifying by size makes sense because large amounts are more material, so they might sample more from the large stratum. This could be a case where stratification is used.

Option B: Desired assessed level of control risk is less than the prior year. Control risk relates to the auditor's assessment of the likelihood that material misstatements could occur due to internal controls. If it's lower, maybe the auditor trusts the controls more. But does that directly relate to stratification? I'm not too sure. Maybe not the main reason for stratification.

Option C: The auditor needs to test a large amount of transactions. Testing more transactions might relate to sample size rather than stratification. Stratification is about how you divide the population, not necessarily the number of transactions.

Option D: There is a significant amount of unrecorded transactions. Unrecorded transactions would affect the audit, maybe leading to different testing methods, but I'm not sure how that ties directly to stratification. Maybe it's more about adjusting journal entries or other procedures.

Option E: Technique to be used is attribute sampling. Attribute sampling is a type of sampling where you're testing for the presence or absence of a characteristic (like yes/no). Stratification can be used here, but I'm not certain if this is the main reason the auditor would stratify. It's a technique that might use stratification, but perhaps not the scenario in the question.

Option F: The population is homogeneous in nature. If the population is homogeneous, meaning similar across all segments, then stratification might not be necessary because there's little variation. So this probably isn't the correct option.

Option G: The auditee has a high level of internal control. High internal control might mean lower risk, so the auditor might use a smaller sample or different methods, but I don't see a direct link to stratification.

Option H: Auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred. If fraud is suspected, the auditor might use more judgmental sampling or other targeted methods, but stratification could be part of it. Not sure if this is the primary case for stratification.

Option I: The auditor plans to reduce the sample size due to time constraints. Reducing sample size might involve other methods, but stratification is about how the population is divided, not necessarily reducing size.

Option J: The population has a wide dispersion. Wide dispersion means that the items in the population vary a lot. For example, some are very large, others small. Stratification would make sense here because you can separate the large from the small to get a better sample. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Now, trying to decide between options A and J. Option A is about giving more weight to large amounts, which implies the population has a mix of sizes. Option J is about the population being widely dispersed. They might be similar, but I think wide dispersion (option J) is a broader reason for stratification. Stratification is often used when the population varies in some way, like size, risk, etc. So when the population has a wide dispersion, meaning the values are spread out a lot, the auditor would stratify to ensure each segment is adequately represented.

So the answer is either A or J. Wait, the question asks "the auditor most likely would stratify the population if the..." So the condition that makes stratification appropriate is when the population is varied. So option J says the population has a wide dispersion, which is a good reason to stratify.

But wait, option A says the auditor wants to give more representation to large amounts. That's another valid reason. Stratification can be done to ensure that certain segments (like large amounts) are adequately sampled. So both A and J seem relevant.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the auditor most likely would stratify the population if the..." So when would stratification be most appropriate? I think it's when the population has a wide dispersion, which is option J. Because in that case, treating the population as homogeneous would be inefficient. So stratification helps in such cases.

Alternatively, option A is about giving greater weight to large amounts. So maybe that's a specific reason, but the general reason is that the population is varied (J). So I'm a bit torn. But I think the correct answer is J: the population has a wide dispersion.

In auditing, stratification involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) with similar characteristics to improve the efficiency and representativeness of the sample. The question asks when an auditor is most likely to stratify the population.

- **Option A**: Giving greater representation to large recorded amounts suggests the population includes both large and small items. Stratification by size is appropriate here, as large amounts are often more material.
- **Option B**: A lower assessed level of control risk might influence sample size but doesn’t directly relate to stratification.
- **Option C**: Testing a large number of transactions relates more to sample size than stratification.
- **Option D**: Unrecorded transactions might affect audit procedures but don’t directly tie to stratification.
- **Option E**: Attribute sampling can use stratification, but this isn’t the primary reason for stratifying.
- **Option F**: A homogeneous population doesn’t require stratification, as there’s little variation.
- **Option G**: High internal control might reduce sample size but doesn’t directly link to stratification.
- **Option H**: Suspecting fraud might lead to targeted sampling but isn’t the primary case for stratification.
- **Option I**: Reducing sample size due to time constraints doesn’t directly relate to stratification.
- **Option J**: A population with wide dispersion (e.g., varying sizes or risks) is a strong reason for stratification, as it ensures adequate representation across different segments.

While both **A** and **J** are relevant, **J** is the broader and more general reason for stratification. Wide dispersion in the population makes stratification necessary to ensure each segment is appropriately represented. Therefore, the most likely reason is **J: The population has a wide dispersion**.

Answer: J
