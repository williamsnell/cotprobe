Question:

Berscheid’s (1983) emotion-in-relationship model proposes that strong positive emotions are LESS likely to be elicited during the later stages of an intimate relationship than in its initial stages because:

Options:

A: over time, partners become more emotionally distant due to familiarity.
B: "over time, people become ""emotionally immune"" to the behaviors of others."
C: in the later stages, each partner's behavior becomes more erratic and unpredictable.
D: in the later stages, each partner works harder to be sensitive to the other’s needs.
E: in the later stages, each person is more self-centered and less other-centered.
F: in the later stages, each partner's behavior has become more predictable.
G: over time, partners become more independent and less reliant on each other for emotional support.
H: in the later stages, each partner is more focused on their own emotional needs.
I: in the later stages, each partner has less emotional investment in the relationship.

Okay, so I have this question about Berscheid’s emotion-in-relationship model from 1983. Hmm, I remember that Berscheid did some work on emotions in relationships, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The question is asking why strong positive emotions are less likely in the later stages of an intimate relationship compared to the initial stages. The options are A through I.

I think Berscheid's model suggests that emotions are tied to the intensity of the relationship. In the beginning, when a relationship is new, people experience a lot of strong emotions because everything is novel and exciting. As time goes on, things settle down, and the intensity decreases.

So why would that happen? Maybe because the relationship becomes more predictable. When you first start dating someone, every interaction is new and can cause strong emotions, whether positive or negative. But as you get to know each other better, you can predict each other's behaviors more accurately. That predictability might reduce the intensity of emotions because there's less surprise or uncertainty.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Partners become more emotionally distant due to familiarity. That sounds possible. Familiarity could lead to less emotional intensity because the excitement of the new relationship wears off.

Option B: People become emotionally immune to others' behaviors. I'm not sure about this term "emotionally immune." It might mean they don't react as strongly, but I don't recall this exact term from Berscheid's model.

Option C: Behavior becomes more erratic. No, I think the opposite happens. Relationships usually become more predictable over time, not less.

Option D: Partners work harder to be sensitive. That seems more like a reason for emotions to stay strong, not decrease.

Option E: More self-centered. That doesn't directly relate to the decrease in positive emotions, unless being self-centered leads to less emotional connection. But I'm not sure if that's what Berscheid said.

Option F: Behavior becomes more predictable. This lines up with what I was thinking earlier. Predictability reduces the emotional highs because the relationship becomes routine.

Option G: Partners become more independent. Maybe, but the question is about emotions, not independence. They might rely less on each other emotionally, but I'm not sure if that directly ties to the intensity of emotions.

Option H: More focused on own emotional needs. Again, this relates to self-centeredness, which I'm not sure is the main point here.

Option I: Less emotional investment. This could make sense because if you're less invested, you might feel less strongly. But I thought Berscheid's model was more about the change in emotional intensity due to the relationship's stage rather than investment.

So narrowing it down, the main idea I remember is that the initial stages have high emotional arousal because everything is new and intense. Later on, as the relationship becomes more established, the emotions stabilize and may not be as strong. This ties into the idea of predictability. So option F seems to fit because when behavior is predictable, the emotional highs aren't as frequent.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is option A, where emotional distance increases with familiarity. Emotional distance could lead to less strong emotions. But I think Berscheid's model is more about the emotional arousal diminishing because the relationship isn't as novel anymore, which is more about predictability than emotional distance.

So I'm leaning towards option F.

Berscheid’s emotion-in-relationship model suggests that strong positive emotions diminish in the later stages of an intimate relationship due to increased predictability. In the initial stages, novelty and unpredictability lead to heightened emotional intensity. Over time, as partners become more familiar and behaviors become routine, the emotional highs decrease because the relationship becomes more predictable and less surprising. 

Among the options, F ("in the later stages, each partner's behavior has become more predictable") aligns most closely with this reasoning, as predictability reduces emotional intensity. Other options, such as A ("emotionally distant due to familiarity") or I ("less emotional investment"), were considered but do not capture the core idea of predictability driving the decrease in emotional arousal.

Answer: F
