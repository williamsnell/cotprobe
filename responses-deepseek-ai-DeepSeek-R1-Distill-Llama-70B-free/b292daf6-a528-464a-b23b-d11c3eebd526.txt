Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of heat transfer concepts. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem is about air being transported through a rectangular duct. Let me jot down the details. The air is at 170°F, and the duct dimensions are 3 inches high and 6 inches wide. The duct is 18 feet long, and the walls are maintained at 65°F. The airflow rate is 25 lbm/hr. I need to find the bulk mean temperature of the air as it leaves the duct.

Hmm, bulk mean temperature... I remember that's the average temperature of the fluid (air here) as it flows through the duct. So it's like the temperature you'd measure if you mixed all the air perfectly at that point.

Wait, how do I approach this? Oh right, this is a problem involving convection heat transfer. The air is cooling as it flows through the duct because the walls are cooler. So heat is being lost from the air to the walls.

I think I should use the concept of heat loss and energy balance. The heat lost by the air should equal the heat gained by the walls, but since the walls are maintained at a constant temperature, the heat is being transferred from the air to the surroundings through the walls.

Oh, right, the formula for convective heat transfer is Q = h*A*ΔT, where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

Wait, but how do I find h? Oh, that's where the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number come into play. Because we have a rectangular duct, I might need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Then, use the appropriate correlation for the Nusselt number to find h.

Let me think. The flow is through a rectangular duct, so the hydraulic diameter is important. Hydraulic diameter D_h is (2*H*W)/(H + W), where H is height and W is width. So H is 3 inches, W is 6 inches.

Calculating D_h: (2*3*6)/(3+6) = (36)/(9) = 4 inches. Wait, 4 inches is 4/12 = 1/3 feet or about 0.0333 feet. But maybe I should keep it in inches for now, since other units might be in inches too.

Wait, the duct's length is 18 feet, which is 216 inches. Hmm, but perhaps converting all measurements to consistent units is better, like feet and pounds.

Wait, the airflow rate is 25 lbm/hr. To find the velocity, I probably need the mass flow rate, but maybe the velocity is more useful. Velocity would be needed for Reynolds number.

So, let's convert everything to consistent units. Let's go with inches and hours, but maybe convert to feet and seconds eventually since standard units for these properties are in feet and seconds.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me organize this.

First, find the air properties at the initial temperature. The air enters at 170°F. But since most property tables are in absolute temperatures, I should convert this to Rankine. So 170°F is 170 + 459.67 = 629.67 R.

Wait, but to calculate the properties, I might need the viscosity, thermal conductivity, specific heat, etc. Alternatively, perhaps I can use approximations for air at around this temperature.

Alternatively, I remember that for air, the Prandtl number is around 0.7, and it's roughly constant. That might come in handy later.

Now, let's find the velocity of the air in the duct. The duct's cross-sectional area is 3 inches * 6 inches = 18 square inches. Wait, but the airflow rate is 25 lbm/hr. So I need to find the velocity from the mass flow rate.

The mass flow rate m_dot is 25 lbm/hr. The density of air at 170°F (which is pretty hot) would be lower than at standard conditions.

Wait, air density can be found using the ideal gas law: rho = P/(R*T). But what's the pressure? The problem doesn't specify, so I think we assume atmospheric pressure, which is about 14.7 psia. But wait, actually, in HVAC situations, it's often standard to assume atmospheric pressure unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but perhaps we can find the density of air at 170°F. Let me think. At standard conditions (70°F, 14.7 psia), the density of air is about 0.0749 lbm/ft³. But at higher temperatures, it's lower. 

So for air at 170°F, which is 629.67 R, the density would be rho = P/(R*T). P is 14.7 psia, R is the specific gas constant for air, which is 1716 ft·lb/lbm·R.

Wait, let's compute that: rho = 14.7 / (1716 * 629.67). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1716 * 629.67 = 1716 * 600 is 1,029,600, and 1716 * 29.67 ≈ 1716 *30=51,480, so total around 1,081,080. So 14.7 / 1,081,080 ≈ 1.36e-5 lbm/ft³. That seems really low. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Maybe look up the density of air at 170°F. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the specific volume, which is the inverse of density.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the mass flow rate and the cross-sectional area to find the velocity. Because m_dot = rho * A * V. So V = m_dot / (rho * A).

But I need rho in lbm/ft³ and A in ft², and m_dot in lbm/s. Oh wait, the units are all over the place. Let me convert everything to consistent units.

First, m_dot is 25 lbm/hr. Let's convert that to lbm/s: 25 / 3600 ≈ 0.006944 lbm/s.

The cross-sectional area of the duct: 3 inches by 6 inches. So 3/12 ft = 0.25 ft, 6/12 ft = 0.5 ft. So area A = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 ft².

So V = m_dot / (rho * A).

But I need rho at 170°F. Let me look up the density of air at 170°F. Alternatively, use the ideal gas law.

At 14.7 psia, R = 1716 ft·lb/(lbm·R), T = 170°F = 629.67 R.

rho = P/(R*T) = 14.7 / (1716 * 629.67) 

Wait, 14.7 is in psia, and R is in ft·lb/(lbm·R), so the units should work out to lbm/ft³.

So 1716 * 629.67 = 1,081,080. So 14.7 / 1,081,080 ≈ 1.36e-5 lbm/ft³. That seems too small, but let's proceed.

So V = 0.006944 lbm/s / (1.36e-5 lbm/ft³ * 0.125 ft²)

Compute denominator: 1.36e-5 * 0.125 = 1.7e-6 lbm/(ft²·s).

So V = 0.006944 / 1.7e-6 ≈ 4085 ft/s. That's way too high! That can't be right because the speed of sound in air is about 1100 ft/s at that temperature, and 4000 ft/s is supersonic, which doesn't make sense for a duct flow. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the units for the specific gas constant R. Let me double-check.

The specific gas constant R for air is 53.3533 ft·lb/lbm·R. Wait, wait, no, wait! I think I confused the units. Because sometimes R is given in ft·lb/lbm·R as 53.35, but sometimes 1716 is used in different contexts. Wait, no, 1716 is the value for R in (lb·ft)/(lbm·R), but wait, no. Wait, actually, the specific gas constant R for air is 1716 ft·lb/(lbm·R) when using pounds-mass. Or maybe it's 53.35 ft·lb/(lbm·R). Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the correct value. The specific gas constant for air is approximately 53.35 ft·lb/(lbm·R). So perhaps I used the wrong R earlier, which led to the wrong density.

So let's recalculate rho. With R = 53.35 ft·lb/(lbm·R), T = 629.67 R, P = 14.7 psia.

rho = P/(R*T) = 14.7 / (53.35 * 629.67)

Calculating the denominator: 53.35 * 629.67 ≈ 53.35 * 600 = 32,010, and 53.35 * 29.67 ≈ 1,582. So total about 33,592. So 14.7 / 33,592 ≈ 0.000437 lbm/ft³. That's 4.37e-4 lbm/ft³. Hmm, that still seems low. Wait, at standard conditions (70°F, 529.67 R), the density is about 0.0749 lbm/ft³, right? So at higher temperature, it's lower, so 0.000437 lbm/ft³ seems way too low.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong R. Alternatively, perhaps I should use R as 1716 lb·ft/(lbm·R). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because 1716 is the value for the universal gas constant when using lb units, but for air, the specific R is 1716 / M, where M is the molecular weight. Air's molecular weight is about 28.97 lbm/lbmol, so R = 1716 / 28.97 ≈ 59.17 ft·lb/(lbm·R). Wait, that's more accurate.

So R for air is approximately 1716 / 28.97 ≈ 59.17 ft·lb/(lbm·R).

So let's recalculate rho. rho = 14.7 psia / (59.17 * 629.67 R)

Calculate denominator: 59.17 * 629.67 ≈ let's compute 60 * 630 = 37,800, so approximately 37,800. So 14.7 / 37,800 ≈ 3.89e-4 lbm/ft³. Still lower than standard conditions, which makes sense, but let's see.

So with rho ≈ 0.000389 lbm/ft³.

Now compute velocity V = m_dot / (rho * A).

m_dot is 25 lbm/hr = 25/3600 ≈ 0.006944 lbm/s.

A is 0.25 ft * 0.5 ft = 0.125 ft².

So V = 0.006944 / (0.000389 * 0.125) 

Compute denominator: 0.000389 * 0.125 ≈ 0.0000486 lbm/(ft²·s).

So V ≈ 0.006944 / 0.0000486 ≈ 142.8 ft/s.

Hmm, that's better. 142.8 ft/s is about 97 mph, which seems high for a duct, but maybe it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the units. Because m_dot is lbm/s, rho is lbm/ft³, A is ft². So the units would be lbm/s / (lbm/ft³ * ft²) )= (1/s) * ft³ / (ft²) )= ft/s. So the units check out.

So V ≈ 143 ft/s. Now, to find the Reynolds number, Re = (V * D_h) / nu, where nu is the kinematic viscosity of air at 170°F.

Wait, what's the kinematic viscosity of air at 170°F? I think at standard conditions (70°F), nu is about 0.0000167 ft²/s. At higher temperatures, it increases. Let me look up or estimate it.

I recall that the viscosity of air increases with temperature. At 200°F, it's around 0.000020 ft²/s. So at 170°F, perhaps around 0.000018 ft²/s. Let me use 0.000018 ft²/s as an estimate.

But wait, maybe I should be more precise. Alternatively, I can use the dynamic viscosity and then find nu as mu/rho.

Dynamic viscosity mu for air at 170°F. At standard conditions, mu is about 0.0000407 lbm/(ft·s). At higher temps, it's higher. At 200°F, it's about 0.000046 lbm/(ft·s). So at 170°F, perhaps around 0.000043 lbm/(ft·s).

Then, nu = mu / rho. So if rho is 0.000389 lbm/ft³, then nu = 0.000043 / 0.000389 ≈ 0.1105 ft²/s.

Wait, that's much higher than my initial estimate. So nu ≈ 0.1105 ft²/s.

Wait, let me recheck. If mu is around 0.000043 lbm/(ft·s), and rho is 0.000389 lbm/ft³, then nu = mu/rho = 0.000043 / 0.000389 ≈ 0.1105 ft²/s.

So Re = (V * D_h) / nu.

D_h is the hydraulic diameter. The duct is 3" high and 6" wide. So D_h = (2*3*6)/(3+6) = 36/9 = 4 inches. Convert to feet: 4/12 = 0.3333 ft.

So Re = (143 ft/s * 0.3333 ft) / 0.1105 ft²/s ≈ (47.666 ft²/s) / 0.1105 ft²/s ≈ 431. So Re ≈ 431.

Wait, that's a Reynolds number around 431. So the flow is laminar because Re < 2300. Hmm, but sometimes the transition is considered around 2000, but typically, Re < 2100 is laminar, above is turbulent.

So in this case, Re ~430, so definitely laminar flow.

Now, for laminar flow in a rectangular duct, the heat transfer coefficient can be determined using the appropriate Nusselt number correlation.

I remember that for laminar flow in a rectangular duct, the Nusselt number depends on the aspect ratio and whether the flow is developing or fully developed. Since the duct is 18 ft long, which is quite long, I can assume the flow is fully developed.

The aspect ratio (AR) is W/H = 6/3 = 2. So AR = 2.

I think the Nusselt number for a rectangular duct with uniform wall temperature in laminar flow is given by:

Nu = ( ( (AR + 1)/(AR) )^2 + ( (AR + 1)/(AR) )^2 ) / ( (AR + 1)/(AR) ) ) ? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think for a rectangular duct with AR = W/H, the Nusselt number can be calculated using the formula:

Nu = 4.44 + 8.03*(AR)^{-1} for AR ≥ 1 and RePr < 100.

Wait, or perhaps another correlation. Alternatively, for a rectangular duct, the Nusselt number in fully developed flow is a function of the aspect ratio and the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers.

Wait, but perhaps since the flow is laminar and fully developed, and assuming constant wall temperature, the Nusselt number can be determined using a specific formula.

Wait, I think the Nusselt number for a rectangular duct in laminar flow with uniform wall temperature is given by:

Nu = ( ( ( ( (5/3) * AR ) + (1/3) ) ) )

Wait, no, that's not ringing a bell. Alternatively, I think for a square duct (AR=1), the Nu is about 5.33 in laminar flow. For higher aspect ratios, it decreases.

Wait, let me look this up in my notes. Oh, right, for a rectangular duct with aspect ratio AR = W/H, the Nusselt number for fully developed flow and uniform wall temperature is given by:

Nu = 4.44 + 8.02/AR

Wait, is that right? Or maybe it's Nu = 4.44 + 8.02/(AR). Let me see.

Alternatively, another source says that for a rectangular duct with AR = W/H, the Nusselt number in fully developed laminar flow is:

Nu = 4.44 + 8.03/(AR)

So with AR=2, Nu = 4.44 + 8.03/2 ≈ 4.44 + 4.015 ≈ 8.455.

Wait, that seems plausible. So Nu ≈ 8.455.

Now, the Nusselt number is defined as Nu = h * D_h / k, where k is the thermal conductivity of air.

So h = Nu * k / D_h.

We need the thermal conductivity of air at the bulk temperature. Wait, but the bulk temperature is changing along the duct, so perhaps we can take the average temperature between inlet and outlet.

But since we don't know the outlet temperature yet, maybe we can approximate using the inlet temperature, 170°F, or perhaps an average.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the film temperature, which is the average of the bulk temperature and the wall temperature. But since the bulk is changing, perhaps it's better to proceed with an iterative approach.

But for now, let's proceed with the inlet temperature.

At 170°F, thermal conductivity of air, k, is about 0.0167 Btu/(hr·ft·°F). Wait, let me confirm. At 200°F, k is around 0.0175, so at 170°F, maybe around 0.0165.

Let me use k
