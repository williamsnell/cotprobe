Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem is about calculating the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for a reaction at a specific temperature, 600°C. The reaction given is SO2(g) + (1/2) O2(g) → SO3(g). I've been provided with a table containing the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) and heat capacity (Cp) data for each substance involved. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the standard enthalpy change for a reaction can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH°_rxn = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)

But wait, that's at 298 K (25°C), right? Since the question is asking for ΔH° at 600°C, which is 873 K, I need to account for the temperature dependence of enthalpy. So the formula should incorporate the heat capacities to adjust for the temperature change.

I think the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy change at the given temperature using the Kirchhoff's law, which relates the change in enthalpy with temperature. The equation for the reaction's enthalpy as a function of temperature is:

ΔH°(T) = ΔH°(298) + ∫(T2 to T1) [Σ Cp(products) - Σ Cp(reactants)] dT

Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

ΔH°(T) = ΔH°(298) + ∫(from 298 to T) ΔCp dT

Where ΔCp is the heat capacity change of the reaction, i.e., Cp(products) - Cp(reactants).

So I'll need to compute ΔCp as a function of temperature and then integrate it from 298 K to 873 K.

Let me list out the steps I need to follow:

1. Calculate ΔH° at 298 K.
2. Determine ΔCp as a function of T.
3. Integrate ΔCp from 298 K to 873 K to find the change in enthalpy due to temperature.
4. Add this change to the ΔH° at 298 K to get ΔH° at 600°C.

Starting with step 1: Calculate ΔH° at 298 K.

The reaction is SO2 + ½ O2 → SO3.

ΔH°_rxn (298) = [ΔHf°(SO3)] - [ΔHf°(SO2) + (½)(ΔHf°(O2))]

Looking at the data:

ΔHf°(SO3) = -93,900 cal/mol
ΔHf°(SO2) = -70,970 cal/mol
ΔHf°(O2) = 0 cal/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)

So plugging the numbers:

ΔH°_rxn = (-93900) - [ (-70970) + (½)(0) ] = (-93900) - (-70970) = (-93900 + 70970) = -22930 cal/mol.

Wait, but that's in cal. Since the options are in both cal and kJ, I need to be careful with units. Let me note that 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 1 kJ = 239 cal approximately. But maybe I can keep it in cal for now and convert later if needed.

So ΔH° at 298K is -22,930 cal/mol. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option I is -22,930 cal, which would be this value. But wait, that's at 298 K, and the question is asking for 600°C, which is 873 K. So I can't stop here.

Next step is to calculate the change in enthalpy from 298 K to 873 K. For that, I need to find ΔCp as a function of temperature and integrate it over that interval.

ΔCp = Cp(SO3) - [ Cp(SO2) + ½ Cp(O2) ]

Each Cp is given as a function of temperature. Let's write down each Cp expression:

For SO3(g):
Cp = 12.65 + 6.40e-3 * T (for T between 273-900 K)

Wait, the table says for SO3(g), Cp is 12.65 + 6.40 × 10^-3 T, and the temperature range is 273-900 K. Since 873 K is within this range, we can use this expression.

SO2(g): Cp =11.40 +1.714e-3 T -2.045e5 T^-2, valid from 273-2000 K.

O2(g): Cp =7.52 +0.81e-3 T -9e4 T^-2, same temp range as SO2.

So let's compute each Cp at the average temperature or perhaps treat it as a function. Since the temperature range is from 298 to 873, and each Cp is a function of T, we might need to integrate each term. Alternatively, perhaps we can express ΔCp as a function of T and then integrate from 298 to 873.

Let me write out each Cp:

Cp_SO3 = 12.65 + 0.00640 * T
Cp_SO2 = 11.40 + 0.001714 * T - (204500)/T²
Cp_O2 = 7.52 + 0.00081 * T - (90000)/T²

Now, ΔCp = Cp_SO3 - [ Cp_SO2 + ½ Cp_O2 ]

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute Cp_SO3:

12.65 + 0.00640 T

Compute Cp_SO2 + ½ Cp_O2:

= [11.40 +0.001714 T -204500/T²] + ½ [7.52 +0.00081 T -90000/T² ]

Let me compute ½ Cp_O2:

= 3.76 + 0.000405 T - 45000/T²

Adding to Cp_SO2:

11.40 + 0.001714 T -204500/T² + 3.76 +0.000405 T -45000/T²

Combine like terms:

11.40 +3.76 = 15.16

0.001714 T + 0.000405 T = 0.002119 T

-204500/T² -45000/T² = -249500/T²

So, Cp_SO2 + ½ Cp_O2 = 15.16 + 0.002119 T - 249500/T²

Now, ΔCp = Cp_SO3 - (Cp_SO2 + ½ Cp_O2 ) 

= [12.65 + 0.00640 T ] - [15.16 + 0.002119 T -249500/T² ]

= 12.65 -15.16 + (0.00640 -0.002119) T + 249500 / T²

Compute each part:

12.65 -15.16 = -2.51

0.00640 -0.002119 = 0.004281

So ΔCp = -2.51 + 0.004281 T + 249500 / T²

Wait, but wait: because it's Cp_SO3 minus (Cp_SO2 + ½ Cp_O2), which is 12.65 +0.0064 T minus [15.16 + 0.002119 T -249500/T²]. So the signs:

= 12.65 -15.16 + 0.0064 T - 0.002119 T + 249500/T² 

Which gives:

= (-2.51) + (0.004281) T + 249500 / T²

So the expression for ΔCp(T) is:

ΔCp = (-2.51) + 0.004281 T + (249500)/T²

Now, the integral of ΔCp from T1=298 K to T2=873 K will give the change in enthalpy due to temperature, which when added to ΔH° at 298 K gives ΔH° at 873 K.

So, the integral ∫ΔCp dT from 298 to 873.

Let me compute each term separately.

Integrate term by term:

Integral of (-2.51) dT = -2.51 * T

Integral of 0.004281 T dT = 0.004281 * (T²)/2 = 0.0021405 T²

Integral of 249500 / T² dT = 249500 * integral T^(-2) dT = 249500 * (-1/T) = -249500 / T

Putting it all together, the integral from T1 to T2 is:

[ (-2.51 T2 + 0.0021405 T2² - 249500 / T2 ) ] - [ (-2.51 T1 + 0.0021405 T1² - 249500 / T1 ) ]

Now, plug in T1=298 and T2=873.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute each term at T2=873:

-2.51 * 873 = let's calculate that.

2.51 * 800 = 2008, 2.51*73=183.23 → total 2008+183.23=2191.23 → so -2191.23 cal/mol (since Cp is in cal/(K·mol), the integral would be in cal/mol).

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check the units. Cp is in cal/(K·mol), so when you integrate over K, you get (cal/(K·mol)) * K → cal/mol.

So each term is in cal/mol.

Compute:

-2.51 *873 = -2.51 *873 = Let me compute 2 *873=1746, 0.51*873=445.73 → 1746+445.73=2191.73 → so -2191.73 cal/mol.

0.0021405 * (873)^2 → 0.0021405 * (873)^2. First compute 873^2.

873 *873: Let me compute 800^2=640000, 73^2=5329, and 2*(800)*(73)= 2*800*73= 116800 → 640000 +116800=756800 +5329=761,129. So 873^2 = 761,129.

Now, 0.0021405 *761129 = Let's compute 761129 * 0.002 = 1522.258, and 761129 *0.0001405 ≈ 761129 *0.0001=76.1129, 761129*0.0000405≈30.825. So total ≈76.1129 +30.825≈106.9379. So 0.002*761129 is 1522.258 +0.0001405*761129≈1522.258 +106.94≈1629.2 cal/mol.

Wait, no, more accurately, 0.0021405 = 0.002 + 0.0001405.

So 761129 * 0.002 = 1522.258.

761129 * 0.0001405 = 761129 * 0.0001 is 76.1129, and 761129 *0.0000405 is 30.825. So total 76.1129 +30.825≈106.9379.

So 0.0021405 *761129 ≈1522.258 +106.938≈1629.196 cal/mol.

Then, the third term: -249500 /873. Let's compute that.

249500 ÷873 ≈ let's see: 873 *285 = approx 873*200=174,600; 873*80=69,840 → 174600+69,840=244,440. 873*5=4,365 → 244,440+4,365=248,805. Now, 249500-248,805=695 left. 695 /873≈0.796. So 285.8 → approximately 285.8.

So -249500/873 ≈ -285.8 cal/mol.

Now, putting together the terms at T2=873:

-2191.73 (from first term) + 1629.196 (second term) -285.8 (third term) 

= (-2191.73 +1629.196) = (-562.534) → then -562.534 -285.8 = -848.334 cal/mol.

Now, compute the same terms at T1=298:

-2.51 *298 = let's compute that: 2.51 *300=753, subtract 2.51*2=5.02 → 753-5.02=747.98 → so -747.98 cal/mol.

0.0021405 * (298)^2. 298^2 = 88804.

0.0021405 *88804 → 0.002*88804=177.208, 0.0001405*88804≈12.488. So total ≈177.208 +12.488≈189.696 cal/mol.

-249500 /298 → 249500 ÷298. Let's compute 298*835=298*(800+35)=238400 + 10,430=248,830. 249500-248,830=670. 670/298≈2.25. So 835+2.25=837.25 → -837.25 cal/mol.

Now, sum the terms at T1=298:

-747.98 +189.696 -837.25 = (-747.98 +189.696) = (-558.284) → then -558.284 -837.25 = -1,395.534 cal/mol.

Now, the integral from 298 to 873 is [value at 873] - [value at 298] → (-848.334) - (-1,395.534) )= (-848.334 +1,395.534) = 547.2 cal/mol.

So the change in enthalpy due to temperature is +547.2 cal/mol.

Wait, that seems a positive change. So the total ΔH° at 873 K is ΔH°(298) + ΔH_temp.

ΔH°(298) was -22,930 cal/mol. So adding 547.2 cal/mol gives:

-22,930 + 547.2 = -22,382.8 cal/mol.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 22,930 minus 547.2 is 22,382.8, but since it's negative, it's -22,382.8 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait: the integral gave a positive 547.2 cal/mol. So the reaction's enthalpy becomes more positive (less negative) as temperature increases. That makes sense because the reaction is exothermic, and higher temperatures may make it less exothermic.

So ΔH°(873) = -22,930 +547.2 → approximately -22,382.8 cal/mol.

Now, looking at the options, option F is -22,369.4 cal, which is very close. Option I is -22,930 cal, which is the ΔH° at 298 K.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are very close, and perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Let me recheck the integral calculation.

So, the integral from 298 to 873 of ΔCp dT is:

For T2=873: (-2.51)(873) +0.0021405*(873)^2 + (-249500/873)
= (-2.51 *873) +0.0021405*(761129) + (-249500/873)
= (-2191.73) + (0.0021405 *761129) + (-285.8)
= (-2191.73) + (1629.196) + (-285.8)
= (-2191.73 +1629.196) = (-562.534) → then -562.534 -285.8 = -848.334 cal/mol.

For T1=298: (-2.51 *298) +0.0021405*(298)^2 + (-249500/298)
= (-747.98) + (0.0021405 *88804) + (-837.25)
= (-747.98) + (189.696) + (-837.25)
= (-747.98 +189.696) = (-558.284) → then -558.284 -837.25 = -1,395.534 cal/mol.

The difference is (-848.334) - (-1,395.534) )= 547.2 cal/mol.

So that part seems correct.

So ΔH°(873) is -22,930 +547.2 = -22,382.8 cal/mol.

Looking at the options, option F is -22,369.4 cal. Close, but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the integration.

Wait, let me recheck the integral calculations with more precision.

First, let's compute each term at T2=873 and T1=298 with more accurate numbers.

Compute for T2=873:

Term1: -2.51 *873 = let's compute 2.51 *873.

2.51 * 800 = 2008.0

2.51 *73 = let's compute 2*73=146, 0.51*73=37.23 → 146+37.23=183.23 → so 2008 +183.23=2191.23 → term1 = -2191.23 cal/mol.

Term2: 0.004281 * (873)^2 / 2 → Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake in the integral of 0.004281 T dT. The integral of a T term is (1/2) a T². So the integral of 0.004281 T dT is 0.0021405 T².

Wait, no, no, wait: the integral of 0.004281 T dT is (0.004281/2) T² = 0.0021405 T². So I had that correct.

So for T2=873, term2 is 0.0021405 * (873)^2.

Compute 873^2: 800^2=640000, 2*800*73= 116800, 73^2=5329. So 640000 + 116800=
