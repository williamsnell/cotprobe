Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is asking me to compute the division of two negative fractions: (-18/7) divided by (-6/5). Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you divide fractions, you multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor. So, the first thing I need to do is rewrite the division problem as a multiplication problem.

Wait, but both the numerator and the denominator are negative. Oh right, a negative divided by a negative gives a positive result. That's a good start because it means the final answer will be positive, so I can maybe eliminate any options that are negative, but looking at the options, they all seem positive. So that might not help me narrow it down right away.

Alright, so the problem is (-18/7) divided by (-6/5). To change the division into multiplication, I take the reciprocal of the second fraction. The reciprocal of -6/5 is -5/6. But wait, since both are negative, the negatives will cancel out. Let me make sure I get that right. So, (-18/7) divided by (-6/5) becomes (-18/7) multiplied by (5/-6). No, wait, no, the reciprocal is 5/6, but since the denominator is negative, the reciprocal would be positive 5/6 because the negatives cancel each other out. Oh wait, no, actually, when you take reciprocal, the sign stays the same unless you're dealing with both signs. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the original problem is two negatives: the numerator is -18/7 and the denominator is -6/5. So when you rewrite it as multiplication, it's (-18/7) * (5/-6). But when you multiply two negatives, the result is positive. So maybe I should just treat the signs first. So, two negatives make a positive, so the overall result will be positive. So now I can focus on the magnitude.

So the problem simplifies to (18/7) divided by (6/5). Now, to divide fractions, I multiply by the reciprocal. So 18/7 multiplied by 5/6. Let me write that down: (18 * 5) divided by (7 * 6). So 18 times 5 is 90, and 7 times 6 is 42. So that gives me 90/42.

Wait, but 90 and 42 can both be divided by 6. Let me simplify that fraction. 90 divided by 6 is 15, and 42 divided by 6 is 7. So 90/42 simplifies to 15/7. So the result is 15/7.

Looking at the options provided, option H is 15/7. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So starting over: (-18/7) divided by (-6/5). Both negatives mean positive result. So 18/7 divided by 6/5 is the same as 18/7 times 5/6. Multiplying numerators: 18*5=90. Denominators:7*6=42. So 90/42 reduces by dividing numerator and denominator by 6: 15/7. Yep, that's correct. So option H is right.

To solve the problem $$\frac{-\frac{18}{7}}{-\frac{6}{5}},$$ we start by recognizing that dividing two negative fractions results in a positive fraction. Thus, the problem simplifies to:

$$\frac{\frac{18}{7}}{\frac{6}{5}}.$$

Next, we rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal of the divisor:

$$\frac{18}{7} \times \frac{5}{6}.$$

Now, we perform the multiplication of the numerators and the denominators:

$$\frac{18 \times 5}{7 \times 6} = \frac{90}{42}.$$

To simplify $$\frac{90}{42},$$ we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

$$\frac{90 \div 6}{42 \div 6} = \frac{15}{7}.$$

Thus, the final result is $$\frac{15}{7}.$$ Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:

H: $$\frac{15}{7}$$
