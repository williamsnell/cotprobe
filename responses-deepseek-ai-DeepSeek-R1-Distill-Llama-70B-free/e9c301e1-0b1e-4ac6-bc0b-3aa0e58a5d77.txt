Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking. The question gives me three different electron configurations labeled (a), (b), and (c), each with their atomic numbers (z). I'm supposed to determine the correct ionic symbols for each and then choose the right option from the given choices.

Alright, let's break it down. I think the first thing to do is analyze each configuration one by one.

Starting with part (a): z=11, and the electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶. Hmm, wait, z is the atomic number, which is the number of protons. So for z=11, that's sodium (Na). The electron configuration for Na is [Ne] 3s¹, but here it's written as 1s² 2s² 2p⁶. Wait, that only sums up to 2+2+6 = 10 electrons. Oh wait, because after 2p⁶, that's the neon configuration, but z=11 means one more electron. So maybe the given configuration is for Na+? Because Na has 11 electrons, but if it loses one, it becomes Na+ with 10 electrons, which matches 1s² 2s² 2p⁶. So the ion here is Na+.

So part (a) should be Na+.

Moving on to part (b): z=25, configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d⁵. Let's count the electrons. 2+2+6=10, then 2+6+5=13. So 10+13=23 electrons. Wait, z is 25, so this is a cation. The neutral atom would have 25 electrons, so losing two electrons would give 23. So what element loses two electrons?

Looking at z=25, the element is manganese (Mn). But wait, the electron configuration for Mn neutral is [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s². So when it loses electrons, it typically loses the 4s electrons first. So losing two electrons would make it Mn²+ with a configuration of [Ar] 3d⁵. But wait, the given configuration is 3d⁵, right? Because the given is 1s² up to 3d⁵, which is 23 electrons. So that's Mn²+.

Wait, but sometimes transition metals can lose more electrons. Wait, but Mn usually shows +2, +4, +7 oxidation states. So if it's lost two electrons, it would be Mn²+.

Wait, but let me double-check. The neutral Mn has 25 electrons. The ion here has 23, so it's lost two. So yes, Mn²+.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake. Let me think about another possibility. If the configuration was 3d^5, that's for Mn²+ because Mn neutral is 3d^5 4s^2. Losing two electrons (from 4s) makes it 3d^5, so Mn²+.

So part (b) is Mn²+.

Wait, but looking at the options below, I need to check. Let me hold on and look at all three parts first.

Part (c): z=29, configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d^10. Let's calculate the electrons. 2+2+6=10, 2+6=8, +10=18, so total 10+18=28 electrons. Since z=29, it's lost one electron. So the neutral atom has 29 electrons, losing one makes 28, so the ion is +1 charge.

What element is z=29? That's copper (Cu). Copper has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d^10 4s^1. If it loses one electron, it becomes Cu+ with a configuration of [Ar] 3d^10. So the ion is Cu+.

Alternatively, sometimes Cu loses two electrons, becoming Cu²+, but in this case, it's only lost one, so it's Cu+.

So, summarizing:

(a) Na+1, which is Na+

(b) Mn²+

(c) Cu^+

Wait, but looking back, part (b) has a configuration of 3d^5, which would be Mn²+ because Mn has 5 d-electrons in the neutral state. So the ion would be Mn²+.

Now, I need to look at the options provided and see which one matches.

Looking at the options (A-J):

Option J: (a) Na+, (b) Fe^2+, (c) Ag^+1

Wait, no, part (b) for option J is Fe^2+. But according to my analysis, part (b) is Mn²+.

Option J's (c) is Ag^+1. Oh, wait, part (c) is Cu^+, not Ag. So that doesn't fit.

Looking for an option where:

a is Na+, b is Mn²+, c is Cu+.

Let me check each option.

Option G: (a) Na+, (b) Mn²+, (c) Cu^+1. Wait, what's the third part? Option G says (c) Cu^+1. So that fits.

Wait, but let me check others.

Option I: (a) Na+, (b) Mn^7+, (c) Cu^2+. No, because (b) is Mn^7+ which is too high.

Option E: (a) Be²+, which is wrong. So no.

Option B: (a) F^- (wrong), so no.

Option D: (a) Ne^+ (wrong), no.

Option C: (a) Mg^+ (no, Mg is z=12, maybe but (a) is Na+).

Option F: (a) Al^3+ (no, z=13), so no.

Option H: (a) Li^+ (no), so no.

Option A: (a) K+ (z=19, but (a) is z=11), so no.

So the only option that matches is option G.

Wait, but let me double-check my analysis.

Wait, part (b): z=25 is Mn. So the ion is Mn²+, correct. So in the options, which option has Mn²+?

Looking at the options:

Option G: (b) Mn^+2.

Yes, because G says (b) Mn^+2.

So (a) Na+, (b) Mn²+, (c) Cu+.

Looking at the options, option G has (a) Na+, (b) Mn^+2, (c) Cu^+1.

So that fits perfectly.

So the correct answer should be option G.

To determine the correct ionic symbols for the given electron configurations, we analyze each case based on the atomic number (z) and the electron configuration provided:

### Part (a):  
- **z = 11**, electron configuration: **1s² 2s² 2p⁶**  
  - The atomic number z = 11 corresponds to sodium (Na).  
  - The given configuration has 10 electrons, which matches the configuration of Na⁺ (sodium loses one electron to achieve a stable noble gas configuration).  
  - Therefore, the ion is **Na⁺**.

### Part (b):  
- **z = 25**, electron configuration: **1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d⁵**  
  - The atomic number z = 25 corresponds to manganese (Mn).  
  - The given configuration has 23 electrons, which means the neutral atom has lost 2 electrons.  
  - Manganese typically loses 2 electrons from its 4s orbital, resulting in **Mn²⁺**.  
  - Therefore, the ion is **Mn²⁺**.

### Part (c):  
- **z = 29**, electron configuration: **1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d¹⁰**  
  - The atomic number z = 29 corresponds to copper (Cu).  
  - The given configuration has 28 electrons, which means the neutral atom has lost 1 electron.  
  - Copper typically loses 1 electron from its 4s orbital, resulting in **Cu⁺**.  
  - Therefore, the ion is **Cu⁺**.

### Matching with the Options:  
- From the analysis:  
  - (a) Na⁺  
  - (b) Mn²⁺  
  - (c) Cu⁺  
- The only option that matches all three is **Option G**: (a) Na⁺, (b) Mn²⁺, (c) Cu⁺.
