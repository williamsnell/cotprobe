Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with witness credibility and prior convictions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a defendant on trial for robbery. The defense attorney is planning to call a witness who has a prior conviction for misdemeanor battery, and the attorney has filed a motion to prevent the prosecution from questioning the witness about that conviction. I need to determine whether the motion will be granted or denied.

First, I remember that in evidence law, a witness's credibility can be attacked using prior convictions. But there are rules about which convictions can be used. I think the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) have specific guidelines here.

I recall that FRE 609 deals with the impeachment of a witness through prior convictions. Under FRE 609(a), a party may attack a witness's credibility by evidence of a prior conviction if the conviction is for a felony or a misdemeanor involving dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment. But for other misdemeanors, I think the rule is different.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. FRE 609(b) says that for convictions other than felonies or those involving dishonesty, the court may allow the evidence if it's more than a certain period old. Or wait, actually, FRE 609(a) allows using felony convictions and misdemeanors involving dishonesty without time limits. For other misdemeanors, like battery, which isn't a crime of dishonesty, I think the time limit applies.

So, for a misdemeanor that's not a crime of dishonesty, the prior conviction can be used to impeach the witness only if the conviction is less than 10 years old. Wait, but wait again. Let me clarify. FRE 609(b) says that if the conviction is more than 10 years old, evidence of it is admissible only if it's a felony and the court determines that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect. But for misdemeanors not involving dishonesty, the general rule in some jurisdictions might be that if it's over a certain period, like 10 years, it can't be used. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the question says the witness was convicted nine years ago. So that's less than 10 years. So if the conviction is a misdemeanor not involving dishonesty, can the opposing party still bring it up?

I think that under FRE 609(a), only felonies and crimes of dishonesty can be used without any time restriction. For other misdemeanors, they can be used only if they occurred within the past 10 years, but wait, no—actually, the 10-year period is for when the conviction is beyond that, and the court may still allow it if it's a felony and the probative value outweighs the prejudice.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me rephrase: FRE 609(a)(1) says that evidence of a conviction is admissible for any felony, and for any misdemeanor that involves dishonesty or false statement. For other misdemeanors, I think the general rule is that they can be admitted if they're within 10 years, but maybe the court has discretion beyond that.

Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look up the exact rule. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, but I'll try to remember.

So, for a misdemeanor that doesn't involve dishonesty, like battery, the prior conviction can be used to impeach the witness's credibility only if the conviction is less than 10 years old. Because if it's older than 10 years, then it's not automatically admissible unless the court decides it's more probative than prejudicial, which is a higher bar.

In this case, the conviction is nine years old, so it's less than 10. That means, under FRE 609(a), can the prosecution use it? Wait, no. FRE 609(a) allows for the use of any felony or any misdemeanor involving dishonesty, without a time limit. But for other misdemeanors, like battery, which is a crime of violence but not dishonesty, the time limit applies.

Wait, no, I think for other misdemeanors, the general rule is that they cannot be used unless they are less than 10 years old. So, since this is nine years old, it's within the 10-year period, so the prosecution can bring it up.

Wait, but the defense is trying to prevent the prosecution from questioning the witness about this. So the defense filed a motion to disallow the prosecution from bringing up the prior conviction. So the question is whether that motion will be granted or denied.

If the prosecution is allowed to bring up the prior conviction, then the defense's motion would be denied. So, if the prior conviction is admissible under the rules, the motion is denied.

So in this scenario, the witness's prior conviction is a misdemeanor battery, which is not a crime of dishonesty. It's nine years old. So under FRE 609(b), evidence of a conviction is admissible if it's a felony, or a misdemeanor involving dishonesty, or if it's a misdemeanor not involving dishonesty but the conviction is within the past 10 years. Wait, but I'm getting myself confused again.

Wait, I think the key point is that FRE 609(a) allows for impeachment using a prior conviction if:

1. It's a felony; or
2. It's a misdemeanor involving dishonesty or false statement.

For other misdemeanors, the general rule is that they can be used only if they occurred within the past 10 years, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. FRE 609(b) says that if the conviction is more than 10 years old, the court may still allow it if it's a felony and the probative value outweighs the prejudice. But for misdemeanors that are not crimes of dishonesty, I think they can be used only if they are less than 10 years old. Or perhaps the 10-year period applies only to felonies.

Wait, perhaps the time limit applies only to felonies. Let me think again. FRE 609(a) says that evidence of a conviction is admissible to attack credibility if:

- It is a felony conviction, or
- It is a misdemeanor conviction involving dishonesty or false statement.

Then, FRE 609(b) deals with the situation where the conviction is more than 10 years old. It says that in such cases, the evidence is admissible only if:

- The conviction is for a felony, and
- The court determines that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect.

So, for a misdemeanor that's not a crime of dishonesty, regardless of the time, can the prosecution use it to impeach? Or is it only allowed if it's within 10 years?

Wait, I think that under FRE 609(a), only the specified convictions (felonies and dishonesty misdemeanors) can be used to impeach, without any time limit. But for other misdemeanors, the general rule is that they can't be used to impeach unless they are less than 10 years old. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no, I think the 10-year limit is for when the conviction is a felony that's more than 10 years old. For other misdemeanors, maybe the time limit doesn't apply, but the court has discretion.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: For any felony, regardless of when it happened, it can be used to impeach under 609(a). For misdemeanors involving dishonesty, same thing—no time limit. For other misdemeanors, like battery, the conviction can be used only if it's within 10 years. So if it's been nine years, it's within the limit, so the prosecution can bring it up.

So in this question, the witness has a nine-year-old misdemeanor battery conviction. Since it's a misdemeanor not involving dishonesty, and it's within 10 years, the prosecution can use it to impeach. Therefore, the defense's motion to disallow the prosecution from questioning the witness about this prior conviction would be denied.

Looking at the options:

Option A: denied, because the conviction is relevant to the witness's credibility.

Option B: denied, because the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party.

Option C: granted, because the prejudice to the defendant outweighs the probative value.

Option D: denied, because it's public record.

Option E: granted as a matter of right.

Option F: denied because of untimely motion.

Option G: denied because less than 10 years since conviction.

Option H: granted because past has no bearing.

Option I: granted because unrelated.

So, the correct reasoning is that the conviction is within 10 years, so it's admissible. Therefore, the motion would be denied.

Looking at the options, option G says "denied, because a period of less than 10 years has elapsed since the date of conviction." That seems to fit.

Wait, but wait—another point: The defense is trying to prevent the prosecution from bringing it up. So if the rule is that such a conviction can be used within 10 years, the prosecution can question the witness about it, so the defense's motion would be denied.

Alternatively, option A says it's denied because it's relevant to credibility. That's a more general statement, but the specific reason here is the time factor.

So between A and G. Let me think about the rule again. The fact that it's within 10 years is the key here. Because for a misdemeanor not involving dishonesty, you can only use it if it's within 10 years. So the prosecution can bring it up because it's within 10 years, so the motion is denied.

So option G is correct: denied because less than 10 years have passed.

Alternatively, option A is about relevance, but the specific reason is the time frame. So the better answer is G.
</think>

The question revolves around whether a defendant's motion to prevent the prosecution from questioning a witness about a prior misdemeanor battery conviction, which is nine years old, will be granted or denied. Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 609, the admissibility of prior convictions to impeach a witness's credibility depends on the nature of the conviction and its age.

FRE 609(a) allows the use of felony convictions and misdemeanor convictions involving dishonesty or false statements, without any time restrictions. For other misdemeanors, such as battery, the rule permits their use to impeach credibility only if the conviction occurred within the past 10 years. Since the witness's conviction is nine years old, it falls within the 10-year window, making it admissible for impeachment purposes.

Given this, the defense's motion to disallow the prosecution from questioning the witness about the prior conviction will likely be denied because the conviction is within the allowable time frame. Among the provided options, the most accurate reason for the denial is that less than 10 years have elapsed since the conviction.
