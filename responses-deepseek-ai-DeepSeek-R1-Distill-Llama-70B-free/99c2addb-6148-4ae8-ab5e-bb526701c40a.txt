Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the psychological impact of physical deviation in adolescents. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what "physical deviation" means in this context. I think it refers to any physical characteristic that's different from what's considered typical or average among peers. This could include things like being much taller or shorter, having a different body shape, or any other physical feature that stands out.

Now, the question is about the psychological impact. Adolescence is a time when individuals are particularly sensitive about their appearance because they're going through significant physical changes and are also developing their self-identity. Peer opinions are crucial during this stage, so any physical difference might affect how they feel about themselves.

Looking at the options:

Option A says physical deviation has no impact. That doesn't seem right. I remember reading that body image issues often start in adolescence, and any deviation can lead to self-esteem problems or social issues.

Option B suggests superior athletic performance. Maybe in some cases, like being taller for basketball, but not necessarily all deviations. Plus, the question is about psychological impact, not performance.

Option C talks about a heightened sense of physical well-being. That seems unlikely. If someone feels different physically, especially in a way that's noticeable, they might feel self-conscious, not more well-being.

Option D claims it diminishes the importance of peer relationships. I don't think so. If anything, physical differences might make peer relationships more challenging, but they don't necessarily make them less important to the adolescent.

Option E says it causes excitement. I can't see why that would be the case. Excitement is more about positive experiences, and physical deviation is more likely to cause stress or anxiety.

Option F states it can cause stress and anxiety. This makes sense because standing out physically can lead to teasing, bullying, or feelings of not fitting in, which are sources of stress and anxiety.

Option G suggests it enhances social acceptance. That seems opposite of what I think. Being different might lead to social exclusion rather than acceptance.

Option H links it to increased academic performance. I don't see a direct connection between physical deviation and academic success. It's more about the psychological effects than academic ones.

Option I claims it's always associated with increased creativity. That's a strong statement, and I don't think there's evidence that physical differences always lead to creativity. It might in some cases, but not universally.

Option J says it results in immediate popularity. Popularity often depends on social dynamics, and being physically different might not make someone popular; in fact, it could have the opposite effect.

Putting it all together, the most plausible answer is F. Adolescents with physical deviations are more likely to experience stress and anxiety because of societal pressures, peer reactions, and self-perception issues.

The psychological impact of physical deviation in adolescents is significant. Adolescence is a sensitive period where self-image and peer acceptance are crucial. Physical differences can lead to stress and anxiety due to factors like teasing, social exclusion, and self-consciousness. 

Options analysis:
- **A, C, D, E, G, H, I, J** are incorrect as they either deny any impact, suggest positive outcomes, or make unrealistic claims.
- **B** is context-dependent and not universally applicable.
- **F** correctly identifies that physical deviation can cause stress and anxiety, aligning with the challenges adolescents face regarding their body image and social interactions.

Answer: F
