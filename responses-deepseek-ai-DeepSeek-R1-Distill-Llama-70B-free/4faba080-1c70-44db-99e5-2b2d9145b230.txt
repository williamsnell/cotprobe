Okay, so I've got this problem here about Frank Lee and Steve Barnes being partners. I'm a bit rusty on partnership accounting, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says Barnes gets a weekly salary of $300, and then 1/3 of the remaining net income. The rest, which would be 2/3, goes to Lee. The total profits are $28,269. I need to find out how much each partner receives.

Hmm, wait. So the total profit is $28,269. Barnes gets a salary first, which is $300 per week. But wait, the problem doesn't specify over what period, but I think the salary is just a flat $300, not weekly here because the total profit is a single figure. Maybe the $300 is a one-time salary, not per week? Or perhaps it's a weekly salary, but the total profits are for the year or something. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the time period, which is a bit confusing. Oh, but maybe it's just a one-time salary, so I'll proceed as if Barnes gets $300 first, and then the remaining profit is split.

So step one: subtract Barnes's salary from the total profit. So $28,269 minus $300 equals $27,969. That's the remaining net income to be split.

Now, Barnes gets 1/3 of that remaining amount, and Lee gets 2/3. So let's calculate Barnes's share after the salary. 1/3 of 27,969 is... let me do the math. 27,969 divided by 3. Let's see, 27,000 divided by 3 is 9,000, and 969 divided by 3 is 323. So together, that's 9,323. So Barnes gets $9,323 from the split.

Wait, but wait. Barnes also gets the $300 salary. So his total would be $300 plus $9,323, which is $9,623. Lee's share is 2/3 of the remaining $27,969. So 2/3 of 27,969 is 18,646. Wait, let me check that calculation.

Wait, 27,969 times 2/3. Let me compute 27,969 divided by 3, which is 9,323, then multiplied by 2 gives 18,646. Yes.

So Barnes gets $9,623 and Lee gets $18,646. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact amount. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: Barnes: $20,000, Lee: $8,269

B: Barnes:8,089, Lee:20,180

C:15,600, 12,669

D:9,423, 18,846

E:19,823, 8,446

F:12,089, 16,180

G:11,423, 16,846

H:4,223, 24,046

I:10,089, 18,180

J:13,500,14,769

Hmm. Barnes's total is $9,623, which isn't exactly an option, but let me see. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the remaining profit after salary. Let me recalculate.

Total profit is $28,269. Subtract Barnes's salary of $300: 28,269 -300 = 27,969.

Now, of this, Barnes gets 1/3, so 27,969 * 1/3 = 9,323.

So Barnes's total is 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

Lee gets 2/3 of 27,969: 27,969 * 2/3 = 18,646.

Wait, but none of the options match these numbers exactly. Let me look again.

Looking at option D: Barnes gets $9,423 and Lee gets $18,846.

Hmm, that's close. Let me see where I might have gone wrong.

Wait maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me compute 27,969 divided by 3 again.

Let me do 27,969 รท3:

3 into 27 is 9, 3 into 9 is 3, 3 into 9 is 3, wait wait: 3 into 27 is 9, subtract 27, bring down 9. 3 into 9 is 3, subtract 9, bring down 6. 3 into 6 is 2. So 9,323. So that's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem considers the salary as weekly, but the total profit is annual. Wait, if the profits are $28,269, and Barnes gets a weekly salary of $300, then the number of weeks would matter. But the problem doesn't specify the time period. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the $300 is a weekly salary, but the total profit is for a different period. Like, maybe it's the total for the year, and Barnes's salary is per week. So if the year is 52 weeks, his salary would be 52 * 300 = $15,600 per year.

Wait, that would change things. Let me recalculate.

If Barnes's salary is $300 per week, and the total profit is for a year, then his annual salary would be 52 * 300 = 15,600.

So subtract that from the total profit: 28,269 - 15,600 = 12,669.

Now, the remaining $12,669 is split as 1/3 to Barnes and 2/3 to Lee.

Barnes's share from the split would be 12,669 * 1/3 = 4,223.

Adding his salary, he gets 15,600 + 4,223 = 19,823.

Lee gets 12,669 * 2/3 = 8,446.

Looking at the options, option E is Barnes: $19,823, Lee: $8,446. That matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought the $300 was a flat rate, but considering it's weekly, maybe the intended approach is to calculate it annually. That would make sense because the total profit is given as a single figure, but the salary is weekly. So the correct approach is to compute Barnes's annual salary first.

So the correct total for Barnes is 15,600 (salary) + 4,223 (his share) = 19,823. Lee gets 8,446.

Looking back at the options, option E matches exactly: Barnes $19,823, Lee $8,446.

Wait, but earlier when I treated $300 as a flat fee, I got Barnes at $9,623 and Lee at $18,646, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the $300 as a weekly salary, so annual salary is 52*300=15,600. Then the remaining profit is 28,269-15,600=12,669. Then split that into 1/3 and 2/3.

Yes, that makes more sense because the options include E as a possible choice. So the correct answer would be option E.

To determine how much each partner receives, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Total Profits**: $28,269.
2. **Barnes's Salary**: $300 per week. Since the problem does not specify the time period for the total profits, we assume the salary is annualized. Thus, Barnes's annual salary is \( 52 \times 300 = 15,600 \).
3. **Remaining Net Income**: Subtract Barnes's salary from the total profits:  
   \[
   28,269 - 15,600 = 12,669.
   \]
4. **Profit Split**: After deducting Barnes's salary, the remaining $12,669 is split as follows:
   - Barnes receives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of $12,669:  
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12,669 = 4,223.
     \]
   - Lee receives \( \frac{2}{3} \) of $12,669:  
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 12,669 = 8,446.
     \]
5. **Total for Each Partner**:
   - Barnes's total = Salary + Share of profits:  
     \[
     15,600 + 4,223 = 19,823.
     \]
   - Lee's total = Share of profits:  
     \[
     8,446.
     \]

Finally, comparing these amounts to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Barnes: $19,823, Lee: $8,446.**
