Okay, so I need to figure out the balance after 10 years for three different scenarios. Let me take it step by step.

First, the initial investment is $1,000 at 4% annual interest, compounded annually. There are three parts: a, b, and c.

Starting with part (a): No further deposits or withdrawals. So this is a simple compound interest problem.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^n, where P is principal, r is rate, n is time in years.

Here, P is $1,000, r is 4% or 0.04, and n is 10 years.

So A = 1000 * (1 + 0.04)^10.

Calculating that: 1.04^10. Let me compute this. I remember that 1.04^10 is approximately 1.480244. So 1000 * 1.480244 is about $1,480.24. Hmm, looking at the options, let me see which ones have approximately $1,480 for part (a). Let's check the options:

Option A: $1,465
Option B: $1,485
Option C: $1,490
Option D: $1,400
Option E: $1,470
Option F: $1,485.50
Option G: $1,475
Option H: $1,480
Option I: $1,480
Option J: $1,500

So part (a) seems to be around $1,480. So options H, I, and maybe F are in the ballpark.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 1.04^10 more accurately. Maybe I should compute it step by step. Let's see:

Year 1: 1.04
Year 2: 1.0816
Year 3: 1.124864
Year 4: approx 1.16985856
Year 5: ~1.2166529024
Year 6: 1.265319018
Year 7: 1.3159317798
Year 8: 1.3685690507
Year 9: 1.4233128128
Year 10: 1.480244285

So 10 years gives about 1.480244, so 1000 * that is 1480.24. So in the options, part (a) is H ($1,480) and I ($1,480). Let's keep that in mind.

Moving on to part (b): depositing $30 at the beginning of each year, including the tenth. So that's an annual deposit, made at the start of each year.

So this is an annuity due, I think. Because the deposit is made at the beginning of the period. So each deposit earns interest for the entire year.

The formula for future value of an annuity due is: FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r * (1 + r). Or wait, wait, no, the formula can be written as FV = PMT * [((1 + r)^n - 1)/r] multiplied by (1 + r). Alternatively, since each payment is made at the beginning, each payment is compounded for n, n-1, ..., 1 years.

Alternatively, the future value can be calculated as the sum of each deposit compounded for the remaining years.

So for each deposit of $30, the first deposit (at time 0) will be at the end of year 10: 30*(1.04)^10.

The second deposit is at the beginning of year 1, so it's at the end of year 10: 30*(1.04)^9.

And so on, until the tenth deposit, which is at the beginning of year 10, so it's only compounded once: 30*(1.04)^0 =30.

So the total FV from the deposits is 30 * [ (1.04)^10 + (1.04)^9 + ... + (1.04)^0 ].

Wait, that's a geometric series. The sum would be 30 * [ ( (1.04)^11 - 1 ) / (1.04 - 1) ) ] / (1.04^0)? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the sum S = 1 + (1.04) + (1.04)^2 + ... + (1.04)^10-1.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because each deposit is made at the beginning of the year, so the first deposit (year 0) is compounded for 10 years, the second (year 1) for 9, etc., until the 10th deposit (year 9) which is compounded for 1 year. So the sum is 30 * sum_{k=1 to 10} (1.04)^(k-1 + 10 - (k-1))? Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify:

Each deposit is made at year t=0, t=1, ..., t=9 (since the 10th deposit is at the beginning of year 10, which is t=10, but then it's only in the account for 0 years, because it's deposited at the end of the 10-year period). Wait, wait, the question says "including the tenth". So the deposits are made at the beginning of each year, including the tenth. So that's t=0 to t=9, because the beginning of the 10th year is t=9. Or wait, no. Let me think about when the deposits occur.

Wait, the initial deposit is made at time 0. Then each subsequent deposit is made at the beginning of each year, so year 1, year 2, ..., year 10. Wait, but the 10-year period is from year 0 to year 10. So the first deposit is at t=0, and the 10th deposit is at t=10, but that's the end of the investment period. So that deposit would not earn any interest. Because it's deposited right at the end.

So for the 10 deposits, each is made at the start of the year. So the first deposit at t=0, then t=1, t=2,..., t=9. Because t=10 is the end, and the deposit at t=10 would be part of the end balance but not earn interest. So the number of deposits is 10, but the last one is at t=9, which is the start of the 10th year.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The question says "deposit $30 at the beginning of each year, including the tenth". So the tenth deposit is at the beginning of the tenth year, which is t=9 (since the first year is t=1, after t=0). So the 10 deposits are made at t=0, t=1, t=2, ..., t=9. Each of these is then compounded for (10 - t) years.

So the FV of the deposits is sum_{t=0 to 9} 30*(1.04)^(10 - t). Alternatively, sum_{n=1 to 10} 30*(1.04)^(n), where n is from 1 to 10. Wait, no. Because when t=0, it's 30*(1.04)^10. When t=1, 30*(1.04)^9, etc., until t=9: 30*(1.04)^1.

So the sum is 30*[ (1.04)^1 + (1.04)^2 + ... + (1.04)^10 ].

So that's a geometric series with a= (1.04), ratio=1.04, n=10 terms.

The sum of the series is 30 * [ (1.04*( (1.04)^10 -1 )) / (1.04 -1) ) ].

Wait, the formula for sum of a geometric series is S = a1*(r^n -1)/(r-1), where a1 is the first term. So here, a1 is (1.04), and the number of terms is 10.

So S = (1.04) * ( (1.04)^10 -1 ) / (0.04).

Wait, let me compute (1.04)^10 again, which is approx 1.480244. So (1.04)^10 -1 is 0.480244.

So S = 1.04 * 0.480244 / 0.04.

Compute numerator: 1.04 * 0.480244 = approx 0.499005.

Divide by 0.04: 0.499005 / 0.04 = approx 12.4751.

So S ≈ 12.4751.

Multiply by 30: 30 * 12.4751 = approx 374.253.

So the FV from deposits is $374.25.

But wait, I think I might have miscalculated because I thought the sum is from t=0 to t=9, which is 10 terms, but the way I modeled it here, the sum is from (1.04)^1 to (1.04)^10, which is 10 terms. So that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach: The future value of each deposit is 30*(1.04)^n, where n is the number of years it's been in the account. So deposit at t=0: n=10, t=1: n=9, ..., t=9: n=1.

So the sum is 30*( (1.04)^1 + (1.04)^2 + ... + (1.04)^10 ). So yes, same as before.

So that sum is 30 * [ (1.04*( (1.04)^10 -1 )) / (1.04 -1) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute (1.04)^10 accurately.

Earlier, 1.04^10 is 1.480244285. So (1.04)^10 -1 = 0.480244285.

Multiply by 1.04: 0.480244285 * 1.04 = 0.49900518.

Divide by 0.04: 0.49900518 / 0.04 = 12.4751295.

Multiply by 30: 30 * 12.4751295 ≈ 374.25388, so approximately $374.25.

Then, the initial investment of $1,000 grows to $1,000 * 1.04^10 = $1,480.24 (from part a).

So the total balance for part (b) is 1,480.24 + 374.25 = $1,854.49.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what part (b) is in each option. For example, option H has part (b) as $1,854.81. Hmm, very close. Option B has $1,855, but part (a) is $1,485 which is a bit off.

So according to my calculation, part (b) is approximately $1,854.49, which is very close to option H's $1,854.81. So maybe small calculation differences due to rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the sum more precisely. Let me compute each deposit's FV.

Compute each term:

Deposit 1: 30*(1.04)^10 = 30 * 1.480244 ≈ 44.40732

Deposit 2: 30*(1.04)^9 ≈ 30 * 1.4233128 ≈ 42.69938

Deposit 3: 30*(1.04)^8 ≈ 30 * 1.368569 ≈ 41.05707

Deposit 4: 30*(1.04)^7 ≈ 30 * 1.3159317 ≈ 39.47805

Deposit 5: 30*(1.04)^6 ≈ 30 * 1.265319 ≈ 37.95957

Deposit 6: 30*(1.04)^5 ≈ 30 * 1.2166529 ≈ 36.49958

Deposit 7: 30*(1.04)^4 ≈ 30 * 1.1698585 ≈ 35.09555

Deposit 8: 30*(1.04)^3 ≈ 30 * 1.124864 ≈ 33.74592

Deposit 9: 30*(1.04)^2 ≈ 30 * 1.0816 ≈ 32.448

Deposit 10: 30*(1.04)^1 ≈ 30 * 1.04 = 31.2

Now sum all these:

44.40732 + 42.69938 = 87.1067

Plus 41.05707 → 128.16377

Plus 39.47805 → 167.64182

Plus 37.95957 → 205.60139

Plus 36.49958 → 242.10097

Plus 35.09555 → 277.19652

Plus 33.74592 → 310.94244

Plus 32.448 → 343.39044

Plus 31.2 → 374.59044.

So sum is approximately $374.59.

So the total would be $1,480.24 (from part a) + $374.59 = $1,854.83.

That's about $1,854.83. Looking at the options, option H's part (b) is $1,854.81. That's very close, so that's probably the correct option.

Now, part (c): withdrawing $30 at the end of each year, including the tenth.

So this is a series of withdrawals at the end of each year. So the first withdrawal is at the end of year 1, second at end of year 2, etc., up to the end of year 10.

So the initial investment is $1,000. Each year, it earns 4% interest, then $30 is withdrawn.

This is a present value of an ordinary annuity problem, but in reverse. Alternatively, we can model it as each withdrawal affecting the principal.

The formula for the future value after regular withdrawals is:

FV = P*(1+r)^n - PMT * [ ((1+r)^n -1)/r ]

Wait, but let me think again. Each withdrawal is made at the end of the year, so the first withdrawal is at t=1, last at t=10.

The future value would be the initial amount growing for 10 years, minus the sum of the present values of each withdrawal compounded to t=10.

Alternatively, each withdrawal is a cash outflow at the end of year t, so their future values at t=10 would be 30*(1.04)^(10 - t).

So for each withdrawal at t=1: FV = 30*(1.04)^9.

At t=2: 30*(1.04)^8.

...

At t=10: 30*(1.04)^0 =30.

So the total FV of withdrawals is 30 * sum_{k=0 to 9} (1.04)^k.

Which is 30 * [ (1.04)^10 -1 ) / (1.04 -1) ].

Compute that sum: sum = (1.04^10 -1)/0.04 → (1.480244 -1)/0.04 → 0.480244 /0.04 =12.0061.

So sum ≈12.0061.

Multiply by 30: 30 *12.0061 ≈ 360.183.

So the FV of the withdrawals is $360.18.

The initial investment grows to $1,000*(1.04)^10 = $1,480.24.

But since we're making withdrawals, the FV is 1,480.24 - 360.18 = $1,120.06.

Looking at the options, let's see. For part (c), looking for about $1,120.06.

Option H: $1,120.07. Very close.

Option B: part (c) $1,120.

Option H's part (c) is $1,120.07, which matches.

So putting it all together:

a: ~$1,480.24 → matches H's a: $1,480.

b: ~$1,854.83 → matches H's b: $1,854.81.

c: ~$1,120.06 → matches H's c: $1,120.07.

So the correct answer would be option H.
</think>

To determine the balance after 10 years for the given scenarios, we analyze each part systematically:

---

### **(a) No further deposits or withdrawals**
This is a simple compound interest problem. The formula for compound interest is:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$1,000 \) (principal),
- \( r = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 10 \) years.

Calculating \( A \):
\[
A = 1000 \cdot (1 + 0.04)^{10} = 1000 \cdot 1.480244 \approx \$1,480.24
\]

This matches the value for part (a) in **Option H**.

---

### **(b) Deposit of $30 at the beginning of each year, including the tenth**
This is an annuity due, where deposits are made at the beginning of each year. The future value of these deposits can be calculated using the formula for the future value of an annuity due:

\[
FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \cdot (1 + r)
\]

Where:
- \( PMT = \$30 \) (annual deposit),
- \( r = 0.04 \),
- \( n = 10 \).

First, calculate the future value of the deposits:
\[
FV = 30 \cdot \frac{(1 + 0.04)^{10} - 1}{0.04} \cdot (1 + 0.04)
\]

Using \( (1.04)^{10} \approx 1.480244 \):
\[
FV = 30 \cdot \frac{1.480244 - 1}{0.04} \cdot 1.04 = 30 \cdot 12.0061 \cdot 1.04 \approx \$374.25
\]

The initial investment grows to:
\[
A = 1000 \cdot (1 + 0.04)^{10} \approx \$1,480.24
\]

Adding the future value of deposits:
\[
\text{Total balance} = 1480.24 + 374.25 \approx \$1,854.49
\]

This matches the
