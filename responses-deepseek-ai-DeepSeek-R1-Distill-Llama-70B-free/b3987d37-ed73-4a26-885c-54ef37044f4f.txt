Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is asking me to translate the sentence "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy" into predicate logic and choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I remember that translating English sentences into predicate logic involves using predicates and logical connectives correctly.

First, I need to break down the sentence. "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy." So, this is a disjunction because it's using "either...or." In logic, disjunction is represented by the ∨ symbol. 

Now, I should identify the predicates and the variables or constants involved. The predicate here is "is a latte boy." Let's assume that the predicate is L, where Lx means "x is a latte boy." Taylor and Eric are specific individuals, so they would be represented by constants, let's say t for Taylor and e for Eric.

So, the sentence can be broken down as: Taylor is a latte boy OR Eric is a latte boy. In symbols, that would be Lt ∨ Le. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Lt ∨ Le. That looks exactly like what I have. But wait, let me check all options to be sure.

Option B: Lx ∨ Ly. This seems more like a general statement about two variables, not specific individuals Taylor and Eric. So probably not the right choice.

Option C: Lt ∧ Le. This is a conjunction, meaning both Taylor and Eric are latte boys. But the original sentence says "either...or," which is inclusive or, but not necessarily both. So C might not be correct unless the context implies inclusivity, but in logic, "or" is usually exclusive unless stated otherwise. Hmm, but wait, in logic, ∨ is inclusive or. So if the sentence is "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy," it includes the possibility that both could be, but it's not required. So C would mean both are, which is not what the sentence says. So C is out.

Option D: L(t ∧ e). Wait, that would mean L applied to the conjunction of t and e. But that doesn't make much sense because L is a predicate that takes a single argument. So t ∧ e would be a truth value, and then L of that would be applying L to a proposition, which isn't how predicates work. So D is incorrect.

Option E: tL ⊃ eL. This looks like an implication, where if Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is. That's not what the sentence says. The original sentence doesn't imply causation or condition, just that at least one is. So E is wrong.

Option F: tL ∨ eL. Oh wait, that's the same as Lt ∨ Le, just written with the subject first. In predicate logic, Lt is shorthand for L(t), so tL would mean the same. So F is Lt ∨ Le, same as A. Wait, but I thought A was Lt ∨ Le, but F is tL ∨ eL. Are they the same? Yes, because Lt is the same as L(t), so tL is just switching the order, but logically equivalent. So both A and F seem correct. Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back at the options, I think I might have misread. Let me list them again:

A: Lt ∨ Le  
B: Lx ∨ Ly  
C: Lt ∧ Le  
D: L(t ∧ e)  
E: tL ⊃ eL  
F: tL ∨ eL  
G: Lx ∧ Ly  
H: L(t ∨ e)  
I: E ∨ T  
J: Tl ⊃ El  

Wait, so F is tL ∨ eL, which is the same as Lt ∨ Le, which is option A. So why are there two options that seem correct? Or am I misunderstanding the notation?

Wait, maybe the notation is different. In some notations, Lt is written as L(t), and tL would be written as L(t). Wait, no, that's the same thing. Or perhaps in some contexts, the order matters, but in standard predicate logic, the predicate symbol comes before the argument. So Lt would be L(t), whereas tL would be written as L(t), but I think that's not standard. So perhaps F is written as tL ∨ eL, which would be L(t) ∨ L(e), same as Lt ∨ Le. So both A and F are correct? But that can't be, since the options are unique.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the notation. Let me think again. In predicate logic, the standard way is to write the predicate followed by the arguments in parentheses. So L(t) is correct, written as Lt in the options. So option A is Lt ∨ Le, which is correct. Option F is tL ∨ eL, which would be L(t) ∨ L(e), same as A. So why are both A and F present?

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me check the original question again. The options are labeled A to J, so each letter corresponds to an expression.

Wait, perhaps the difference is that in option A, it's Lt ∨ Le, which is using the predicate L with t and e as arguments, while option F is tL ∨ eL. But in standard logic, the predicate comes first, so L(t) is Lt, so option A is correct. Option F's notation might be unconventional. Or perhaps in the options, the letters are written after the predicate, making it tL as in L(t). But that's non-standard. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, I'm getting confused because both A and F seem to represent the same thing. Let me think about this again.

The sentence is "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy." So, in logic, this is (L(t) ∨ L(e)). So which option matches this?

Option A: Lt ∨ Le → which is L(t) ∨ L(e), correct.

Option F: tL ∨ eL → which would be L(t) ∨ L(e), same as A. But in standard notation, Lt is L(t), so A and F are the same. But that can't be right because each option is unique.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation in the options. Let me check again.

Looking at the options:

A: Lt ∨ Le → So Lt is L(t), Le is L(e).

F: tL ∨ eL → So tL is L(t), eL is L(e).

So both A and F represent the same thing. But that can't be, because each option is a different choice. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the options are using different predicates. Let me check the question again. The question says "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy." So the predicate is "is a latte boy," which is L. So the terms are Lt and Le.

Wait, perhaps the options are using different letters for the predicate. Let me see:

Option I is E ∨ T, which doesn't make sense because E and T would be predicates or variables, but without context, it's unclear.

Option J is Tl ⊃ El, which is an implication, but that's not what the sentence says.

So going back, the correct translation should be Lt ∨ Le, which is option A, but option F is tL ∨ eL, which is the same as A. But since both options are present, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options are written differently. For example, in option F, it's tL ∨ eL. But in standard notation, the predicate symbol comes first, so Lt is correct. So perhaps option A is the correct one, and F is written incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different notation where the constant comes before the predicate, like tL meaning L(t). But that's unconventional. So in that case, F would be correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The sentence is a disjunction: Taylor is a latte boy OR Eric is a latte boy. So in logic, it's L(t) ∨ L(e). So looking at the options, which one matches this.

Option A: Lt ∨ Le → Yes, because Lt is L(t), Le is L(e).

Option F: tL ∨ eL → If tL is L(t), then this is also correct.

But wait, in standard logic notation, the predicate comes first, so Lt is correct, and tL would be non-standard. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

But I'm a bit confused because both A and F seem to represent the same thing. Let me check the possible answer letters again.

Wait, the correct answer should be F? Or A? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option F is tL ∨ eL. If tL is L(t), then it's the same as Lt. So F is L(t) ∨ L(e), which is the same as A. But since A and F are both options, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, maybe in option F, tL is a single predicate, like tL is a predicate where t is a variable, but that doesn't make sense because t is a constant. So no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a different notation where the subject comes first, so tL is L(t). If that's the case, then F is the correct answer.

But in standard logic, the predicate comes first, so Lt is L(t). So the correct translation would be Lt ∨ Le, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider each option's structure.

The original sentence is "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy." So it's a disjunction of two propositions: Taylor is a latte boy, and Eric is a latte boy.

In logic, this is (L(t) ∨ L(e)).

Looking at the options:

A: Lt ∨ Le → Correct, as explained.

B: Lx ∨ Ly → This uses variables x and y, not specific constants t and e. So it's a general statement, not about Taylor and Eric specifically. So B is wrong.

C: Lt ∧ Le → This is a conjunction, meaning both are latte boys. The sentence doesn't say both, just at least one. So C is wrong.

D: L(t ∧ e) → This would mean that the conjunction of t and e is a latte boy. But t and e are individuals, so t ∧ e is a truth value, not an individual. So L(t ∧ e) doesn't make sense. D is wrong.

E: tL ⊃ eL → If Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is. This is an implication, not a disjunction. So E is wrong.

F: tL ∨ eL → If tL is L(t), then this is L(t) ∨ L(e), same as A. So F would also be correct, but I think the standard notation is Lt, so A is correct.

G: Lx ∧ Ly → Again, variables, and a conjunction. Not applicable here.

H: L(t ∨ e) → This would mean that the disjunction of t and e is a latte boy. But t and e are individuals, so t ∨ e is a truth value. So L(t ∨ e) is applying L to a truth value, which doesn't make sense. H is wrong.

I: E ∨ T → Without context, E and T could be anything. Probably not relevant here.

J: Tl ⊃ El → Again, an implication, and the notation is unclear. Probably wrong.

So, the correct answer should be either A or F. But since both represent the same thing, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it uses the standard notation where the predicate comes first.

Wait, but in the options, F is written as tL ∨ eL, which is the same as A. So why are both options present? Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different notation where the subject comes before the predicate. For example, tL means L(t). In that case, F would be correct.

Wait, but in standard predicate logic, the predicate symbol comes before the argument, so Lt is correct. So the correct answer should be A.

But I'm a bit confused because F seems to represent the same thing. Let me think of it this way: in the sentence, the structure is "Taylor is a latte boy" which is Lt. So "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy" would be Lt ∨ Le, which is option A.

So the answer is A.

The question asks to translate the sentence "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy" into predicate logic. This sentence is a disjunction, meaning "or," and involves the predicate "is a latte boy," represented as \( L \), with Taylor and Eric as specific individuals, represented by the constants \( t \) and \( e \). 

In predicate logic, the sentence can be expressed as \( L(t) \lor L(e) \), which is read as "Taylor is a latte boy or Eric is a latte boy." This matches the structure of the original sentence.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A: \( Lt \lor Le \)**  
  This directly represents \( L(t) \lor L(e) \), which is the correct translation. The notation \( Lt \) is shorthand for \( L(t) \), and \( Le \) for \( L(e) \). This matches the required disjunction.

- **Option B: \( Lx \lor Ly \)**  
  This uses variables \( x \) and \( y \) instead of the specific constants \( t \) and \( e \). It represents a general statement about two variables, not the specific individuals Taylor and Eric. Therefore, it is incorrect.

- **Option C: \( Lt \land Le \)**  
  This represents a conjunction, meaning "Taylor is a latte boy and Eric is a latte boy." The original sentence uses "or," not "and," so this is incorrect.

- **Option D: \( L(t \land e) \)**  
  This applies the predicate \( L \) to the conjunction \( t \land e \). However, \( t \land e \) is a truth value, not an individual, and \( L \) is a predicate that applies to individuals. This is nonsensical and incorrect.

- **Option E: \( tL \supset eL \)**  
  This represents an implication, meaning "If Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is a latte boy." The original sentence does not express a conditional relationship, so this is incorrect.

- **Option F: \( tL \lor eL \)**  
  If \( tL \) is interpreted as \( L(t) \) and \( eL \) as \( L(e) \), this is equivalent to \( L(t) \lor L(e) \), which matches the original sentence. However, the notation \( tL \) is non-standard, as predicates typically come before their arguments in standard logic. Thus, while it is logically equivalent, it is less conventional than Option A.

- **Option G: \( Lx \land Ly \)**  
  This uses variables \( x \) and \( y \) and represents a conjunction, which does not match the original sentence. It is incorrect.

- **Option H: \( L(t \lor e) \)**  
  This applies the predicate \( L \) to the disjunction \( t \lor e \). However, \( t \lor e \) is a truth value, not an individual, and \( L \) is a predicate that applies to individuals. This is nonsensical and incorrect.

- **Option I: \( E \lor T \)**  
  Without context, \( E \) and \( T \) are unclear. This does not correspond to the original sentence and is incorrect.

- **Option J: \( Tl \supset El \)**  
  This represents an implication, meaning "If Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is a latte boy." The original sentence does not express a conditional relationship, so this is incorrect.

Between Options A and F, both represent the correct logical structure, but Option A uses the standard notation where the predicate comes before the argument (\( Lt \) for \( L(t) \)). Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice.
