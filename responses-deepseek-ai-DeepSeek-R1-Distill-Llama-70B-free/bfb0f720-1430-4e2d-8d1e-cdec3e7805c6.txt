Okay, so I have this question about Marge Simpson's hair color. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see, Marge is a character from The Simpsons, right? I remember she's the mom. Her hair is pretty distinctive, but I'm trying to recall the exact color.

Wait, Marge has that big hairdo, like a tall blue beehive or something. Oh yeah, it's blue! But wait, isn't her hair actually a different color? Or is it just the style that's making it look blue? No, no, I think the color is blue. Let me think about other characters. Homer's hair is... well, he's almost bald but has a bit of brown. Bart and Lisa have yellow hair, I believe. Wait, no, that's their skin color? No, wait, no, The Simpsons characters have yellow skin, but their hair is different. So Marge's hair is blue, right?

But wait, I might be confusing her with another character. Let me visualize her. She's wearing a green dress and has that tall hair. Oh, right, the hair is blue. So the answer should be blue. Looking at the options, B is blue. So the correct choice is B.
