Okay, I need to solve this problem about Frank Bryant's compensation. Let me read the question carefully.

So Frank is a salesman for a refrigerator company. He gets all his travel expenses compensated, and he has a drawing account of $600 per month. His commission structure is a bit tiered. Let me break it down.

His commission is:
- 2% on the first $30,000 of sales.
- 2.5% on the next $10,000 (so up to $40,000 total).
- 3% on anything over $40,000.

In this particular month, his sales are $41,180. So that's $1,180 over $40k. Also, he paid $332.75 in travel expenses and took the full $600 drawing.

Wait, so how does this all work? I think the order of calculation is important. Let me think step by step.

First, calculate his total commission based on his sales. Then, subtract the drawing account because that's like an advance or allowance, and then add back the travel expenses he paid out of pocket. Or wait, maybe the drawing account is subtracted from his total earnings, and then the travel expenses are added back? Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says he is "allowed a drawing account of $600 per month." So I think that means he can draw up to $600 as an advance against his commissions. So the drawing is subtracted from his earned commission, but if his commission isn't enough, maybe the company covers it? But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the drawing is an expense that comes out of his commission. So his total earnings would be commission minus drawing, and then add the travel expenses since they're reimbursed.

Wait, the problem says he is compensated for all travel expenses, which probably means the company pays him back. So the process should be:

Total commission earned → subtract the drawing account → then add the reimbursed travel expenses.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the drawing is like an advance; he takes $600, which is subtracted from his commission. Then, any travel expenses he paid are added back (since they're reimbursed).

So step by step:

1. Calculate the commission based on the sales tiers.

Sales are $41,180.

First tier: $30,000 at 2% → 0.02 * 30,000 = $600.

Next tier: $10,000 at 2.5% → 0.025 * 10,000 = $250.

The remaining $1,180 (41,180 -40,000) at 3% → 0.03 * 1,180 = Let me calculate that. 1% is 11.8, so 3% is 35.4.

So total commission is 600 + 250 +35.4 = $885.40.

2. Then subtract the drawing account. So $885.40 - $600 = $285.40.

3. Then add back the travel expenses, which are $332.75. So 285.40 + 332.75 = $618.15.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. So the formula is: (Commission) - (Drawing) + (Travel Expenses).

So yes: 885.40 - 600 = 285.40; 285.40 + 332.75 = 618.15.

Looking at the options, option D is $618.15. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let's recheck the commission tiers.

First $30k at 2%: 30,000 *0.02=600.

Next $10k (from 30k to 40k) at 2.5%: 10,000 *0.025=250.

Remaining 1,180 at 3%: 1,180 *0.03=35.4.

Total commission: 600+250=850, plus 35.4 is 885.4. That's correct.

Then subtract drawing: 885.4-600=285.4.

Add travel expenses: 285.4+332.75=618.15. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be D: $618.15.

To determine the amount due Frank Bryant for the month, we calculate his total commission based on his sales, subtract his drawing account, and then add his reimbursed travel expenses.

1. **Commission Calculation**:  
   - **First $30,000 of sales**: 2% of $30,000 = $600.  
   - **Next $10,000 of sales (from $30,000 to $40,000)**: 2.5% of $10,000 = $250.  
   - **Sales exceeding $40,000 (i.e., $1,180)**: 3% of $1,180 = $35.40.  
   - **Total Commission**: $600 + $250 + $35.40 = **$885.40**.

2. **Subtract Drawing Account**:  
   - Frank is allowed a drawing account of $600 per month.  
   - $885.40 (total commission) - $600 (drawing account) = **$285.40**.

3. **Add Reimbursed Travel Expenses**:  
   - Frank paid $332.75 in travel expenses, which are reimbursed.  
   - $285.40 + $332.75 = **$618.15**.

Thus, the amount due Frank Bryant for the month is **$618.15**.

**Answer: D**
