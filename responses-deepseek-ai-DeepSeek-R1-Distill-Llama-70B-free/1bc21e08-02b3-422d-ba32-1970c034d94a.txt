Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the stability of some metal complexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me four different complex ions and their dissociation reactions. Each reaction has an equilibrium constant, k. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing NH3 concentration at equilibrium when starting with 1 M of each complex. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, right, the equilibrium here is for each complex dissociating into the metal ion and ammonia. The lower the k value, the more stable the complex is because it doesn't dissociate as much. So for each complex, we can think about how much it tends to stay intact.

Let me list the complexes and their k values:

1. Cu(NH3)₂4+ → Cu²+ + 4NH3, k = 1.0e-12
2. Co(NH3)₂6+ → Co²+ + 6NH3, k = 4.0e-5
3. Co(NH3)₃6+ → Co³+ + 6NH3, k = 6.3e-36
4. Ag(NH3)₂+ → Ag+ + 2NH3, k = 6.0e-8

Wait, actually, each k is the dissociation constant. So a smaller k means the complex is more stable because it's less likely to dissociate. So the complex with the smallest k is the most stable, and thus requires a lower concentration of NH3 to stay in solution.

Wait, but the question is about the increasing NH3 concentration needed to be in equilibrium with the complex. So higher k implies more dissociation, meaning more free NH3 is needed to shift the equilibrium back to the complex side. Or wait, no. Let me think about Le Chatelier's principle.

The reaction is: complex ↔ metal ion + NH3. K is [metal][NH3]^n. So higher K means the complex dissociates more, so higher [NH3] is needed for the reaction to go back to forming the complex. But wait, the question is about the concentration of NH3 in equilibrium when starting with 1M of each complex.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the stability of the complexes. The more stable a complex is, the less it dissociates, so the lower the concentration of NH3 in solution, because less NH3 is released.

So the higher the K, the less stable the complex. So the complex will dissociate more, releasing more NH3 into the solution. So higher K → higher [NH3] in solution.

Wait, but wait, the question states: arrange them in order of increasing NH3 concentration. So the complex with the lowest [NH3] at equilibrium comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Since K is [M][NH3]^n, for each complex, the [NH3] is proportional to (K / [M])^(1/n). But each starts at 1M, and when the complex dissociates, [M] increases, but for simplicity, let's assume that x is small compared to 1, so [M] ≈ x, and [NH3] ≈ ... Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K.

Let's take each reaction:

For reaction 1: K = [Cu²+][NH3]^4 = 1e-12. Let's say at equilibrium, [Cu²+] = x, and [NH3] = y. So 1e-12 = x * y^4. Since the initial concentration of the complex is 1M, and assuming x is small (because K is small), then x ≈ 1e-12 / y^4.

Wait, but solving for y in terms of K and x is complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compare the K values and their relation to the NH3 concentration.

Alternatively, for each complex, the lower the K, the more stable the complex, so the less it dissociates, leading to lower [NH3]. Therefore, the order of [NH3] from lowest to highest would be the order of increasing K.

Wait, no, because K itself is dependent on the number of NH3 molecules involved. For example, reaction 1 has 4 NH3, reaction 3 has 6, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of NH3 for each, assuming that the complex dissociates a little.

Let me think for each complex:

Assume that the change is x, so:

For each complex, the dissociation is:

Complex → M^n+ + n NH3.

Wait, no, the stoichiometry varies. For reaction 1, it's 4 NH3; reaction 2 is 6, etc.

Let me take each reaction and model their K expressions.

1. Cu(NH3)_4²+ ↔ Cu²+ + 4NH3: K1 = [Cu²+][NH3]^4 = 1e-12.

Assuming initial concentration is 1 M, and change is x. So at equilibrium, [Cu(NH3)_4²+] = 1 - x ≈ 1 (since K is small, x is tiny). [Cu²+] = x, [NH3] = 4x (since 4 moles are released per mole of complex that dissociates). Wait, no, because each dissociation releases 4 NH3 molecules, so [NH3] = 4x.

So, K1 = x*(4x)^4 = x*(256 x^4) = 256 x^5 ≈ 1e-12.

So 256 x^5 = 1e-12 → x^5 = 1e-12 /256 ≈ 3.9e-15 → x ≈ (3.9e-15)^(1/5) ≈ approx (1e-14.5) → wait, 1e-15 is (1e-3)^5, since (1e-3)^5 is 1e-15. So 3.9e-15 is about 1.5e-3^5. So x≈ (3.9e-15)^(0.2) = e^( (ln 3.9 + (-15) ln10)/5 ) → but maybe that's getting too deep. But for the purpose of comparing, perhaps I can compute the exponents.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to realize that for each K, the [NH3] is related by a formula. Let's try to model each:

Let me consider each complex and write their K expressions:

1. K1 = [Cu²+][NH3]^4 = 1e-12. Let [NH3] = y. So [Cu²+] = 1e-12 / y^4. But [Cu²+] is equal to the amount of complex that dissociated, which is also (since each gives one Cu²+ and 4 NH3), [Cu²+] = x. So y = 4x (since for each x, 4 NH3 is added). Wait, no, if x is the amount of complex that dissociates, then [Cu²+] = x, and [NH3] = 4x (because each dissociation produces 4 NH3). So K1 = x*(4x)^4 = x * 256x^4 = 256 x^5 = 1e-12 → x^5 = (1e-12)/256 → x^5 ≈ 3.9e-15 → x ≈ (3.9e-15)^(1/5). Let me compute 3.9e-15^(1/5):

The fifth root of 1e-15 is 1e-3 (since (1e-3)^5 = 1e-15). So 3.9e-15 is about 3.9 times that, so the fifth root is approximately (3.9)^(1/5) times 1e-3. 3.9 is about 3, and fifth root of 3 is around 1.245. So x ≈ 1.245e-3 M.

Then [NH3] =4x ≈ 4*(1.245e-3) ≈ 4.98e-3 M.

Wait, but wait, this is for complex 1.

Complex 2: Co(NH3)6²+ → Co²+ +6NH3, K=4e-5.

Similarly, K2 = [Co²+][NH3]^6 =4e-5.

Let x be [Co²+] = x, so [NH3] =6x.

So K2 =x*(6x)^6 =x*6^6 x^6 =6^6 x^7 =4e-5.

6^6 is 46656, so 46656 x^7=4e-5 → x^7 =4e-5 /46656 ≈ 8.58e-10 → x ≈ (8.58e-10)^(1/7).

Let me compute this. 1e-9 is (1e-9)^(1/7) is about 1e-9^(0.1428) → approximately 1e-1.285 ≈ 5.23e-2? Wait, wait, perhaps a better way is to take logs.

ln(x) = (ln(8.58e-10 )) /7 → ln(8.58) is about 2.15, ln(1e-10) is -23.02585. So ln(8.58e-10)=2.15-23.02585≈-20.875 → divided by 7 → -2.982 → exponentiate: e^-2.982≈0.050 → x≈0.05 M.

Then [NH3]=6x≈0.3 M.

Hmm, that's a lot higher than complex 1.

Complex 3: Co(NH3)6³+ → Co³+ +6NH3, K=6.3e-36.

So K3 = [Co³+][NH3]^6 =6.3e-36.

Let x be [Co³+] =x → [NH3]=6x.

So 6.3e-36 = x*(6x)^6 =x *6^6 x^6 =46656 x^7 → x^7 =6.3e-36 /46656 ≈1.35e-40 → x≈(1.35e-40)^(1/7).

Take log: ln(x)= (ln(1.35e-40))/7 → ln(1.35)≈0.3, ln(1e-40)= -92. So (0.3-92)/7≈-91.7/7≈-13.1 → e^-13.1≈ approx 2.2e-6 → x≈2.2e-6 M.

[NH3] =6x≈1.3e-5 M.

Wait, that's much lower than complex 2 but higher than complex 1? Wait, wait, complex 1 had [NH3]=~5e-3 M, complex 3 has 1.3e-5 M. So lower than complex 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because complex 3 has a much lower K. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, K3 is 6.3e-36, which is smaller than K1's 1e-12. So complex 3 is more stable. So [NH3] should be lower. But according to my calculation, complex 3 has [NH3]=1.3e-5 M, which is lower than complex 1's 5e-3 M. So that makes sense.

Wait, but wait, the math for complex 3: x≈2.2e-6 M, so [NH3]=6x=1.32e-5 M.

Now complex 4: Ag(NH3)₂+ → Ag+ + 2NH3, K=6e-8.

So K4= [Ag+][NH3]^2=6e-8.

Let x be [Ag+]=x, [NH3]=2x.

So K4 =x*(2x)^2 =x*(4x^2)=4x^3 =6e-8 → x^3=6e-8/4=1.5e-8 → x≈(1.5e-8)^(1/3) ≈ 2.47e-3 M.

Then [NH3]=2x≈4.94e-3 M.

So compiling the [NH3] values:

Complex 1: ~4.98e-3 M

Complex 2: ~0.3 M

Complex 3: ~1.32e-5 M

Complex 4: ~4.94e-3 M

Wait, but wait, complex 4's [NH3] is about 5e-3, which is similar to complex 1. But let me see the exact numbers.

Wait, complex 4's K is 6e-8. Let me re-calculate.

K4=6e-8=4x^3 → x^3= (6e-8)/4=1.5e-8 → x= cube root of 1.5e-8.

Cube root of 1e-8 is 1e-8^(1/3)= ~2.15e-3 (since (2.15e-3)^3≈1e-8). 1.5e-8 is 1.5 times that, so cube root is approx 2.15e-3 * (1.5)^(1/3). 1.5^(1/3) is about 1.15, so x≈2.47e-3 M.

Then [NH3]=2x≈4.94e-3 M.

So let me list all [NH3]:

1. Cu: ~4.98e-3 M

2. Co²+: 0.3 M

3. Co³+: 1.32e-5 M

4. Ag+: 4.94e-3 M

So the order from lowest [NH3] to highest would be:

Co³+ (1.3e-5) < Cu (4.98e-3) < Ag (4.94e-3) < Co²+ (0.3)

Wait, wait, wait, no, 4.94e-3 is about 0.005 M, and 4.98e-3 is 0.005 M as well. So which is lower? Well, 4.94 is lower than 4.98, so Ag is lower than Cu.

Wait, that's not correct. 4.94e-3 is 0.00494, and 4.98e-3 is 0.00498. So Ag is lower than Cu.

So the order from lowest to highest [NH3] is:

Co³+ < Ag+ < Cu²+ < Co²+

Because Co³+ has ~1.3e-5, then Ag has ~4.94e-3, then Cu has ~4.98e-3, then Co²+ has 0.3 M.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 4.94e-3 is 0.00494, 4.98e-3 is 0.00498. So Ag is less than Cu.

So the order is Co³+ → Ag+ → Cu²+ → Co²+.

Wait, but let me check the [NH3] values again:

Co³+: ~1.3e-5

Ag+: ~4.94e-3

Cu: ~4.98e-3

Co²+: 0.3

So the order from lowest to highest is:

Co³+ (smallest) → Ag+ → Cu²+ → Co²+ (largest)

So the arrangement is Co³+, Ag+, Cu²+, Co²+.

Looking at the options, let's see which letter corresponds.

Options:

A: Ag+, Co²+, Co³+, Cu²+ → No, starts with Ag.

B: Cu²+, Co²+, Ag+, Co³+ → No, starts with Cu.

C: Co²+, Ag+, Cu²+, Co³+ → No.

D: Co³+, Co²+, Ag+, Cu²+ → No, Co²+ after Co³+.

E: Ag+, Cu²+, Co²+, Co³+ → No.

F: Cu²+, Ag+, Co³+, Co²+ → No.

G: Co²+, Cu²+, Co³+, Ag+ → No.

H: Cu²+, Co³+, Ag+, Co²+ → No.

I: Co³+, Ag+, Cu²+, Co²+ → Yes, this matches what we have.

J: Ag+, Co³+, Cu²+, Co²+ → No.

So option I is Co³+, Ag+, Cu²+, Co²+.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The correct order is Co³+ (lowest NH3) → Ag+ → Cu²+ → Co²+.

Looking at option I:

I: Co³+, Ag+, Cu²+, Co²+ → yes, which is the order we determined.

Wait, but let me look at the options:

Option I: Co^3+, Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^2+.

So the correct order is Co^3+ < Ag+ < Cu^2+ < Co^2+.

Wait, but K values are:

Co^3+ has K=6.3e-36 → very small, so NH3 is lowest.

Ag has K=6e-8 → higher than Co^3+, so higher NH3.

Cu has K=1e-12 → higher than Co^3+ but lower than Ag and Co^2+.

Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, for K, a lower K means more stable complex, which implies lower [NH3] because less dissociation.

Wait, but wait, that's where I might have gotten confused earlier.

So the K is the dissociation constant. So for a more stable complex (lower K), the [NH3] should be lower because the complex doesn't dissociate as much, releasing less NH3.

So the order of increasing [NH3] is from the most stable (lowest K) to least stable (highest K).

The K values are:

Co³+ →6.3e-36 (smallest K)

Cu²+ →1e-12

Ag+ →6e-8

Co²+ →4e-5 (largest K)

So the order of [NH3] from lowest to highest is Co³+, Cu²+, Ag+, Co²+.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation where Ag+ had lower [NH3]
