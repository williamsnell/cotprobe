Question:

A driver and passenger were driving to work in the former's automobile one morning. As they were traveling at a speed of 20 m. p. h. (which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, "Look at that car upside down. " The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will

Options:

A: recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.
B: recover only a portion of damages, because both the driver and the owner of the abandoned auto were negligent.
C: recover nothing, because he was distracted while driving.
D: recover all of his damages, because the owner of the abandoned auto was negligent.
E: recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.
F: recover all of his damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard.
G: recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.
H: recover nothing, because he was driving at a speed that didn't allow him to stop in time.
I: recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically negligence and comparative fault. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario: A driver and passenger are in a car going 20 mph, which is within the speed limit. The passenger points out an overturned car, and the driver looks over. While he's distracted, he doesn't see an abandoned car with a flat tire 200 feet ahead and crashes into it. Now, the driver is suing the owner of the abandoned auto. The jurisdiction uses a comparative negligence system.

First, I need to figure out the possible negligence here. The driver was distracted by looking at the overturned car. So, was he negligent in taking his eyes off the road? Probably, because drivers have a duty to keep their attention on the road. But the passenger's action of pointing it outâ€”does that make the passenger at fault? Or is the driver solely responsible for his own distraction?

Then there's the owner of the abandoned car. Leaving a car in the middle of the highway with a flat tire could be negligent. The owner might have a duty to remove the vehicle or at least make sure it's not a hazard.

Comparative negligence comes into play because the jurisdiction has it. So if both the driver and the owner were negligent, their damages would be apportioned accordingly.

Wait, but the options mention whether the driver can recover anything. Let's look at the options:

Option B says the driver can recover a portion because both were negligent. That makes sense under comparative negligence. But wait, what if the driver's own negligence was the primary cause?

Another point is whether the owner's action was a superseding cause. Like, the driver's distraction was a foreseeable event? Or was the owner's leaving the car there an unforeseeable event that breaks the chain of causation?

Wait, no. The driver's distraction was caused by the passenger pointing out something. The driver chose to look away. So the driver's negligence is in not keeping a proper lookout. The owner's negligence is in abandoning the car, creating a hazard.

So both parties were negligent. Comparative negligence would reduce the driver's recovery by his percentage of fault. So he can't recover all, but only a portion. So looking at the options, option B says "recover only a portion because both were negligent." That seems right.

But wait, another thought: If the owner's car was just sitting there, maybe the driver had enough time to stop if he wasn't distracted. So without the distraction, he might have seen it in time. So the owner's negligence was leaving the car, which was a hazard. The driver's negligence was being distracted.

So both were at fault. Hence, comparative negligence applies, and the driver can only recover a portion of the damages, not all.

Looking back at the options, option B seems correct. Other options like A, which mentions supervening cause, probably isn't right because the driver's own action (looking away) isn't a superseding cause. It's a foreseeable event. So A is out.

Option C says he can't recover because he was distracted. That's too harsh; comparative negligence would allow partial recovery, not bar it entirely.

Option D says he can recover all because the owner was negligent. But that ignores the driver's own negligence, which contributed to the crash.

Option E says he can recover a portion because the auto was in plain view. But the issue isn't whether he should have seen it, but that he was negligent in looking away.

Option H suggests speed was an issue, but the speed was within the limit. So H isn't right.

So I think the correct answer is B: recover only a portion because both the driver and the owner were negligent.

The scenario involves a driver and passenger where the driver crashes into an abandoned vehicle after being distracted by the passenger pointing out an overturned car. The jurisdiction applies a comparative negligence statute, meaning liability will be apportioned based on the fault of each party.

The driver was negligent for failing to keep a proper lookout by being distracted, while the owner of the abandoned vehicle was negligent for leaving it in the highway, creating a hazard. Both parties' negligence contributed to the accident. Under comparative negligence, the driver can recover only a portion of the damages, as their recovery will be reduced by their percentage of fault.

Option B is correct because it reflects the principle of comparative negligence, where both parties share fault, and the driver's recovery is proportionally reduced. Other options either ignore the driver's negligence, misapply legal doctrines like superseding cause, or fail to account for the comparative fault system.

Answer: B
