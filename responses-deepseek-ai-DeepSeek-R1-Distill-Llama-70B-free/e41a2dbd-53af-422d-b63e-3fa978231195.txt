F: the aggressor feels threatened or endangered.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Berkowitz's revision to the frustration-aggression hypothesis. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the original hypothesis was by Dollard and his colleagues in 1939. They proposed that frustration always leads to aggression. But Berkowitz revised that, right? So Berkowitz must have added some conditions where frustration leads to aggression.

I think Berkowitz's main point was that frustration doesn't always cause aggression. There must be other factors involved. So the question is asking under what condition does frustration lead to aggression according to Berkowitz.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The target is lower-status. I'm not sure about this. Maybe, but I don't recall this being Berkowitz's main point.

Option B: High stress. Stress might be related to frustration, but Berkowitz's revision was more about the presence of aggressive cues.

Option C: Aggressive cues in the environment. Oh wait, I think this rings a bell. Berkowitz said that frustration leads to aggression when there are cues that make aggression a likely response. Like if you're frustrated and see something that reminds you of aggression, you're more likely to act aggressively.

Option D: Aggression leads to desirable outcomes. That sounds more like reinforcement or something, maybe related to learning theory, not Berkowitz's specific revision.

Option E: Target shows weakness. I don't think that was Berkowitz's condition. Maybe it's more about target attractiveness or something else.

Option F: Aggressor feels threatened. That might relate to other theories, like the cognitive neo-association model, perhaps, where threat leads to aggression.

Option G: Blame on external factors. Not sure. Maybe related to attribution theory.

Option H: Rewarded for aggression before. That's more about operant conditioning, like Skinner. Berkowitz's revision was more about environmental cues.

Option I: Lack of social support. Hmm, not sure how that ties in. Maybe social support reduces aggression, but I don't think that's what Berkowitz focused on.

Option J: Internal locus of control. That's about whether people attribute control to internal or external factors. Not directly related to Berkowitz's frustration-aggression hypothesis.

So putting it all together, Berkowitz added that frustration leads to aggression when there are aggressive cues present. So the answer should be option C.

Berkowitz (1971) revised the original frustration-aggression hypothesis, suggesting that frustration leads to aggression when certain conditions are present. Specifically, Berkowitz proposed that frustration results in aggression when there are aggressive cues in the environment. These cues can trigger aggressive responses by making aggression a more salient or likely reaction. Among the given options, the correct answer aligns with this condition.

Answer: C
