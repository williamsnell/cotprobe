Okay, so I've got this tort question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the situation is about a judge who lives next door to a father. The judge recently sentenced the father's son to six months in prison for a narcotics charge. Now, the father wants revenge. One afternoon, when the judge is mowing his lawn, the father sets up a water sprinkler behind some shrubs that separate their properties. When the judge comes near, the father turns on the sprinkler, which drenches the judge without him seeing it coming.

The question is asking which tort or torts the judge can recover against the father for. The options are A through I, each listing a combination of torts.

First, I need to recall the elements of each tort mentioned in the options. Let's go through each possible tort and see if it applies here.

Starting with battery. Battery is an intentional tort that involves harmful or offensive contact with another person. The contact must be intentional and without consent. So, in this case, the father turned on the sprinkler, causing water to hit the judge. Did this cause harmful contact? Well, water might not be harmful, but it's definitely offensive, especially since it drenched him. So, that could count as battery.

Next, assault. Assault is an intentional act that causes reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. It's about putting someone in fear of immediate harm. Here, the judge didn't see the water coming, so he didn't have any apprehension before it happened. So, assault might not apply because there was no fear beforehand.

Trespass to land is another tort. It involves intentional and unauthorized entry onto another's land, which causes damage. Did the father's water sprinkler constitute an entry onto the judge's land? Well, water can be considered as entering the land, so perhaps this is a trespass to land. But wait, trespass to land usually involves a physical invasion, like stepping on the property or throwing something onto it. The water from the sprinkler would land on the judge's lawn, so that might count as a trespass to land.

Trespass to chattels is about interference with personal property. The sprinkler water hit the judge, not his property, so that might not apply here. Unless the water damaged the judge's lawnmower or something, but the question doesn't mention that.

Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires intentional and extreme conduct causing severe emotional distress. The father's action was intentional revenge, but did it cause severe distress? The question just says the judge was drenched, not that he suffered emotional distress. So IIED might not apply unless we assume the embarrassment or stress from being soaked, but it's not clear if it's severe enough.

Negligence would involve a breach of duty causing injury, but here the father's act was intentional, not careless. So negligence probably doesn't fit.

So, considering all this:

- Battery: Intentional contact with offensive touching (water). Yes.
- Trespass to land: Water entering the judge's property. Yes.
- Assault: No, because no apprehension.
- IIED: Maybe, but not clearly severe.

Looking at the options, option G is Battery and Trespass to Land. Option I includes assault, which I don't think applies. Option A includes IIED, which I'm not sure about. Option D includes trespass to chattels, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be G: Battery and Trespass to Land.

The scenario involves a judge who was drenched by a neighbor's water sprinkler as an act of revenge. To determine the applicable torts, we analyze the elements of each:

1. **Battery**: This requires intentional and offensive contact. The father intentionally activated the sprinkler, causing water to hit the judge, which is an offensive touching. Battery applies here.

2. **Trespass to Land**: This involves unauthorized entry onto another's property. The water from the sprinkler entered the judge's property, constituting a trespass to land.

3. **Assault**: This requires reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Since the judge did not see the water coming, there was no apprehension, so assault does not apply.

4. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: While the act was intentional, the question does not specify severe emotional distress, making IIED unlikely.

5. **Negligence and Trespass to Chattels**: These do not apply, as the act was intentional and did not involve interference with personal property.

The correct answer is the combination of battery and trespass to land.
