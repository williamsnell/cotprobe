Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about two independent Poisson processes, N₁(t) and N₂(t), with rates λ₁=1 and λ₂=2 respectively. They merge into a process N(t) = N₁(t) + N₂(t). We're given that N(1) = 2, and we need to find the probability that N₁(1) = 1.

Hmm, okay. So N(1) is the sum of N₁(1) and N₂(1), right? So if N(1)=2, that means N₁(1) + N₂(1) = 2. And we're looking for the probability that N₁(1) is exactly 1. That would make N₂(1) equal to 1 as well, because 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but I think I should approach this using conditional probability. Because we're given that the total N(1) is 2, and we want the probability that N₁(1) is 1 under that condition.

So the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, since we're given B (N(1)=2), and the event A is N₁(1)=1, which implies that N₂(1)=1 as well, so the joint occurrence is just the scenario where both N₁ and N₂ equal 1.

Wait, or is it? Let me think again. When N(1)=2, N₁(1) can be 0,1,2. So the possible cases are N₁=0, N₂=2; N₁=1, N₂=1; N₁=2, N₂=0. Each of these contributes to the total probability of N(1)=2.

So the idea is that the probability we want is the probability that N₁=1 and N₂=1, given that N₁ + N₂=2.

But since N₁ and N₂ are independent, the joint probability P(N₁=k, N₂=m) is P(N₁=k) * P(N₂=m).

So to compute P(N₁=1 | N(1)=2), we can sum over all possible k and m where k + m = 2, and compute the probabilities, then find the ratio where k=1.

Wait, more systematically: The conditional probability P(N₁ = k | N₁ + N₂ = 2) is equal to [P(N₁=k) * P(N₂=2−k)] divided by the sum over all possible k of P(N₁=k) * P(N₂=2−k)].

So the denominator is the total probability that N₁ + N₂ = 2, which would be the sum for k=0 to 2 of P(N₁=k) * P(N₂=2−k).

So let's compute each term.

First, for k=0: P(N₁=0) is e^−λ₁ * (λ₁^0)/0! = e^−1 * 1/1 = 1/e ≈ 0.3679.

Then P(N₂=2) is e^−2 * (2^2)/2! = e^−2 *4/2 = (4/2)e^−2= 2/e² ≈ 0.2707.

So the product for k=0: (0.3679) * (0.2707) ≈ 0.0996.

For k=1: P(N₁=1) is e^-1 *1^1/1! = e^-1 ≈0.3679.

P(N₂=1) is e^-2 *2^1/1! = 2 e^-2 ≈0.2707*2=0.5414? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, e^-2 is about 0.1353, so 2 * e^-2 is approximately 0.2707.

So the product for k=1: (0.3679) * (0.2707) ≈ 0.0996.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 0.3679 is e^-1, and 0.2707 is 2 e^-2. Let me calculate the product again.

Wait, 0.3679 * 0.2707 = approximately 0.0996.

Then for k=2: P(N₁=2) is e^-1 *1^2/2! = e^-1 / 2 ≈ 0.1839.

P(N₂=0) is e^-2 *2^0 /0! = e^-2 *1 = e^-2 ≈0.1353.

So the product for k=2 is 0.1839 * 0.1353 ≈ 0.0249.

Now, sum all these up: 0.0996 (k=0) + 0.0996 (k=1) + 0.0249 (k=2) ≈ 0.2241.

Wait, but wait, that sum is the denominator, which is the total probability P(N(1)=2). Let me check: Alternatively, since N(t) is a Poisson process with rate λ1 + λ2 = 3. So P(N(1)=2) is e^-3 * 3^2 / 2! = (9/2) e^-3 ≈ (4.5) * 0.0498 ≈ 0.2241. Yes, that matches.

So the denominator is 0.2241.

Now, the numerator is the probability for k=1, which is 0.0996.

So the conditional probability is 0.0996 / 0.2241 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0996 / 0.2241. Let me compute this division.

Approximately, 0.0996 is about 0.1, and 0.2241 is about 0.224. So 0.1/0.224 ≈ 0.446, but let's compute it more accurately.

0.0996 ÷ 0.2241 ≈ Let's do it:

Compute 0.0996 / 0.2241:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to make it 996 / 2241.

Let me compute 996 ÷ 2241.

Hmm, let's see: 2241 * 0.444 = 2241 * 0.4 = 896.4; 2241 * 0.044 = approx 2241 * 0.04 = 89.64; 2241 * 0.004=8.964. So 0.4 +0.04 +0.004 = 0.444. So 0.4 gives 896.4, 0.04 gives 89.64 (total 986.04), 0.004 gives 8.964 (total 995.004). So 0.444 * 2241 = approx 995.004, which is just under 996. So 0.444 gives about 995. So 996 is about 0.444 + (1/2241) which is negligible. So approximately 0.444.

Wait, but wait, 0.0996 /0.2241 is approximately 0.444, so 44.4%.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.4444, which is 4/9, exactly 0.4444.

Wait, but wait, I thought when I calculated 0.0996/0.2241, the division gave approximately 0.444.

Let me double-check the exact calculation.

Compute e^-1 *1 * e^-2 *2 / (e^-3 * 3^2 / 2!) )

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this without calculating the numerical values.

Let me think: N₁ and N₂ are independent Poisson processes. So given that N(t) = N₁(t) + N₂(t) = 2, what's the probability N₁(t) =1?

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as a binomial distribution, where each event in N(t) is attributed to either process 1 or 2, with probabilities proportional to their rates.

Wait, since the processes are independent, the probability that any single event comes from N₁ is p = λ₁/(λ₁ + λ₂) = 1/(1+2) = 1/3. Similarly for N₂, it's 2/3.

So given that there are 2 events, the number of events from N₁ follows a binomial distribution with n=2 and p=1/3. So the probability that exactly 1 event is from N₁ is C(2,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^1 = 2 * (1/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 ≈ 0.4444.

Ah, that's another approach. So the answer would be 4/9, which is approximately 0.4444, which is option D.

So that's a quicker way than computing all the individual Poisson probabilities.

To solve the problem, we analyze the scenario where two independent Poisson processes, \( N_1(t) \) and \( N_2(t) \), with rates \( \lambda_1 = 1 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \), respectively, are merged into \( N(t) = N_1(t) + N_2(t) \). We are given that \( N(1) = 2 \), and we need to find the probability that \( N_1(1) = 1 \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Conditional Probability Setup**:  
   The probability \( P(N_1(1) = 1 | N(1) = 2) \) is calculated using the formula for conditional probability:  
   \[
   P(N_1(1) = 1 | N(1) = 2) = \frac{P(N_1(1) = 1, N_2(1) = 1)}{P(N(1) = 2)}.
   \]

2. **Joint Probability \( P(N_1(1) = 1, N_2(1) = 1) \)**:  
   Since \( N_1(1) \) and \( N_2(1) \) are independent,  
   \[
   P(N_1(1) = 1, N_2(1) = 1) = P(N_1(1) = 1) \cdot P(N_2(1) = 1).
   \]  
   Using the Poisson probability formula:  
   \[
   P(N_1(1) = 1) = e^{-1} \cdot \frac{1^1}{1!} = e^{-1}, \quad P(N_2(1) = 1) = e^{-2} \cdot \frac{2^1}{1!} = 2e^{-2}.
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   P(N_1(1) = 1, N_2(1) = 1) = e^{-1} \cdot 2e^{-2} = 2e^{-3}.
   \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(N(1) = 2) \)**:  
   The merged process \( N(t) \) is a Poisson process with rate \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = 3 \). The probability \( P(N(1) = 2) \) is:  
   \[
   P(N(1) = 2) = e^{-3} \cdot \frac{3^2}{2!} = \frac{9}{2}e^{-3}.
   \]

4. **Conditional Probability**:  
   Substituting into the conditional probability formula:  
   \[
   P(N_1(1) = 1 | N(1) = 2) = \frac{2e^{-3}}{\frac{9}{2}e^{-3}} = \frac{4}{9}.
   \]

5. **Alternative Interpretation**:  
   The problem can also be viewed as a binomial distribution, where each event in \( N(1) = 2 \) is attributed to \( N_1(1) \) or \( N_2(1) \) with probabilities proportional to their rates. The probability that exactly 1 event is from \( N_1(1) \) is:  
   \[
   P(N_1(1) = 1) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}\right)^1 \left(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}\right)^1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probability that \( N_1(1) = 1 \), given \( N(1) = 2 \), is \( \frac{4}{9} \approx 0.4444 \). This corresponds to **option D**.
