Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: The virus uses a different enzyme to replicate its genetic material
B: The virus has a unique replication cycle that does not involve nucleic acids
C: The virus is immune to DNAase
D: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase
E: DNAase selectively only attacks bacterial DNA
F: The virus's genetic material is composed of proteins, not nucleic acids
G: The virus rapidly mutates to resist the effects of DNAase
H: The RNA in the virus is transformed into DNA
I: The virus has a protective shell against DNAase
J: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor proteins

Okay, so I've got this question about DNAase and its effects on bacterial cells versus RNA viruses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says that when DNAase is added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed, which means it gets broken down. Because of that, the cell can't make any more proteins and eventually dies. But when DNAase is added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. I need to explain why that happens.

Wait, what's DNAase? Oh right, DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So it hydrolyzes DNA into smaller components. So in the bacterial cell, adding DNAase would destroy the DNA, which is essential for the cell's functions like replication and protein synthesis. Without DNA, the cell can't transcribe RNA or make proteins, so it dies. That makes sense.

But then why don't RNA viruses get affected the same way? The question says they continue to produce proteins. So maybe it's because RNA viruses don't rely on DNA? Because their genetic material is RNA instead of DNA.

So if the virus has RNA as its genome, adding DNAase wouldn't affect it since DNAase specifically targets DNA. RNA viruses would have their RNA intact, so they can still use that RNA for their needs, like replicating and making proteins. Oh wait, but how do they make proteins? Viruses can't make proteins on their own; they rely on the host's machinery. So in the host cell, the RNA virus's RNA would be used to make proteins, and if the host's DNA is intact, the host can still make the necessary proteins for the virus.

Wait, but the question says that when DNAase is added to the virus, they continue to produce proteins. So maybe the key here is that the virus's genetic material is RNA, and DNAase doesn't act on RNA. So the virus's RNA isn't affected, so it can still function.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase. That sounds right because DNAase only breaks down DNA, not RNA.

Other options: Option C says the virus is immune to DNAase, but that's not necessarily true. It's more about the enzyme's target. Option A suggests a different enzyme, but I don't think that's the case here. Option F says the virus uses proteins as genetic material, which isn't true because viruses have either DNA or RNA. Option I suggests a protective shell, but I don't think that's relevant here. Option J talks about inhibitors, but that's an extra step and not the primary reason.

So the correct answer should be D. Because RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic material, DNAase doesn't affect them. So they can still produce proteins because their RNA remains intact.

The question involves understanding the effect of DNAase on bacterial cells and RNA viruses. DNAase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes DNA, disrupting bacterial cells by destroying their DNA, which is essential for protein synthesis and cell survival. However, RNA viruses are unaffected by DNAase because their genetic material is RNA, not DNA. DNAase specifically targets DNA, so it does not interfere with RNA viruses' ability to produce proteins. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly states that RNA viruses are not affected by DNAase because their genetic material is RNA, which DNAase does not act upon. This is the most accurate explanation.
- Other options, such as C (immunity to DNAase), A (different enzyme), F (genetic material as proteins), I (protective shell), and J (inhibitor proteins), are either incorrect or unnecessary complications.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.
