Okay, so I've got this math problem here about medication dosage, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations yet, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that 960 mg of Cotrimoxazole is prescribed every 12 hours, and we need to find the daily dose in grams. The options are A through J, but I'm focusing on the calculation right now.

Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many doses are taken in a day. Since it's every 12 hours, that means twice a day, right? Because 24 hours divided by 12 is 2. So the patient takes two doses each day.

Each dose is 960 mg. So for two doses, I'd multiply 960 mg by 2. Let me write that out: 960 mg * 2 = 1920 mg per day. 

But wait, the question asks for the dose in grams, not milligrams. I remember that 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams. So I need to convert 1920 mg into grams. To do that, I divide by 1000, because there are 1000 mg in a gram.

So 1920 mg divided by 1000 equals 1.92 grams. Hmm, but let me double-check that because sometimes I get confused between grams and milligrams.

Wait, 1000 mg is 1 gram, so 1920 mg is 1.92 grams. That makes sense. So the daily dose should be 1.92 grams.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.92. So that's probably the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Another way to think about it: Each dose is 960 mg. Two doses would be 960 * 2 = 1920 mg, which is 1.92 grams. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The options don't have 1920 mg as a choice except for option G, but the question asks for grams, so G is 1920 mg, which is 1.92 grams. Wait no, option G is 1920, but the unit isn't specified. Oh wait, the options are in grams because the question says to choose grams. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are: A:1.92, B:0.192, C:0.96, D:0.0192, E:19.2, F:3.84, G:1920, H:960, I:2.88. So G is 1920, which I think is in grams? Wait, no, that can't be right because 1920 grams would be way too high for a drug dose. Oh, wait, no, the question says 960 mg, which is less than a gram per dose. So G is 1920 grams, which is 1,920,000 mg, which is way too high. So that must be a wrong option. So I think my initial calculation of 1.92 grams is correct, so option A.

Wait, did I miscalculate anything? Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe convert each dose to grams first before multiplying by two. 960 mg is 0.96 grams per dose (since 960 รท 1000 = 0.96). Then, two doses would be 0.96 * 2 = 1.92 grams. Yep, same result. So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is A:1.92.

The problem involves calculating the daily dose of Cotrimoxazole in grams, given that 960 mg is prescribed every 12 hours. 

1. **Determine the number of doses per day**: Since the medication is taken every 12 hours, there are 2 doses in a 24-hour period.
2. **Calculate the total daily dose in milligrams**: Each dose is 960 mg, so for 2 doses:  
   \( 960 \, \text{mg} \times 2 = 1920 \, \text{mg} \).
3. **Convert milligrams to grams**:  
   \( 1920 \, \text{mg} \div 1000 = 1.92 \, \text{g} \).

Thus, the daily dose is 1.92 grams. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **A: 1.92**.
