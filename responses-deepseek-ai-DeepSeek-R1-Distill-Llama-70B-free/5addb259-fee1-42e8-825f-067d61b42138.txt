Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an aircraft in level flight, and I need to find the effective lift area. Hmm, let's see what I remember about aerodynamics and lift.

Alright, the problem states that the aircraft is flying in level flight at 250 km/hr. Wait, units are important here. I think I should convert that speed into meters per second because the standard conditions for air are probably given in SI units. Oh right, 1 km is 1000 meters, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 250 km/hr divided by 3.6 should give m/s. Let me do that calculation: 250 / 3.6 ≈ 69.444 m/s. Yeah, that's right.

The lift coefficient is given as 0.4, and the drag coefficient is 0.0065. But wait, drag coefficient might not be needed here because the question is about lift area. Oh, right, the mass is 850 kg. Since the aircraft is in level flight, the lift must equal the weight. So I can probably use the lift equation to find the area.

The lift equation is L = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * Cl * A, where rho is air density, v is velocity, Cl is the lift coefficient, and A is the area. Since the craft is in level flight, L equals the weight, which is mass times gravity. So, L = m * g. Let me write that out.

So, m * g = 0.5 * rho * v² * Cl * A. I need to solve for A, the area. Rearranging the equation, A = (2 * m * g) / (rho * v² * Cl). 

But wait, what's the value of rho under standard conditions? I think standard sea level air density is about 1.225 kg/m³. Yeah, that's right.

Now plugging in the numbers:

m = 850 kg
g = 9.81 m/s²
rho = 1.225 kg/m³
v = 69.444 m/s (from earlier)
Cl = 0.4

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 2 * m * g = 2 * 850 * 9.81. Let's calculate that. 850 * 2 is 1700. 1700 * 9.81. Hmm, 1700 * 9 is 15300, and 1700 * 0.81 is 1377. So total numerator is 15300 + 1377 = 16677. Hmm, wait no, wait. Wait, 850 * 9.81 is 8338.5. So 2 times that is 16677 N. Right.

Denominator: rho * v² * Cl. Let's compute v squared first. 69.444 squared. Let me see, 70 squared is 4900, but 69.444 is a bit less. Let's compute 69.444^2. 69^2 is 4761. 0.444^2 is about 0.197. Then cross terms: 2 * 69 * 0.444 = about 61.536. So total would be 4761 + 61.536 + 0.197 ≈ 4822.73 m²/s². Hmm, but maybe more accurately, 69.444 is 250/3.6, so (250/3.6)^2 = (62500)/(12.96) ≈ 4822.9167 m²/s².

So denominator is 1.225 * 4822.9167 * 0.4.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 1.225 * 0.4 = 0.49. Then 0.49 * 4822.9167. Let's calculate 4822.9167 * 0.49.

Well, 4822.9167 * 0.4 is 1929.1667, and 0.09 times is 4822.9167 *0.09 = 434.0625. So adding them gives 1929.1667 + 434.0625 = 2363.2292.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1.225 * 4822.9167 = let me check that again. Hmm, perhaps I should compute 1.225 * 4822.9167 first. 1.225 * 4000 is 4900, 1.225 * 800 is 980, 1.225 * 22.9167 is about 27.91. So adding those: 4900+980=5880, 5880+27.91≈5907.91. Then multiply by 0.4: 5907.91 *0.4= 2363.164.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in breaking it down. Let me redo that part. So denominator is (1.225 kg/m³) * (v squared in m²/s²) * (Cl). So v squared is 4822.9167, and Cl is 0.4. So 1.225 * 4822.9167 = let me compute that. 

1.225 * 4822.9167. Let me do 4822.9167 * 1.225 step by step.

4822.9167 * 1 = 4822.9167
4822.9167 * 0.2 = 964.5833
4822.9167 * 0.02 = 96.4583
4822.9167 * 0.005 = 24.1146

Adding all together: 4822.9167 + 964.5833 = 5787.5. Then +96.4583 = 5883.9583. Then +24.1146 ≈ 5908.0729.

So 1.225 * 4822.9167 ≈5908.0729. Now multiply by Cl which is 0.4: 5908.0729 *0.4= 2363.22916.

So the denominator is approximately 2363.229.

Now, the area A is numerator (16677) divided by denominator (2363.229).

Computing 16677 / 2363.229.

Let me do this division. Let's approximate 2363.229 * 7 = 16543.603. Because 2363 *7 is 2363*5=11815, plus 2363*2=4726, so 11815+4726=16541. So 7 *2363=16541. So 16677 -16541=136. So 7 plus (136/2363.229).

136 divided by 2363.229 is approximately 0.0576. So total is about 7.0576 m².

Looking at the options, option B is 7.03, option I is 6.95, option A is7.10, option C is7.20. Wait, my calculation is approximately 7.0576, which is about 7.06 m².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, when I computed v in m/s, 250 km/h is 250 * 1000 m / 3600 s = 250000/3600 ≈ 69.444 m/s. Correct.

Lift equation: L = 0.5 * rho * v² * Cl * A.

L equals weight, which is m * g. So:

m * g = 0.5 * rho * v² * Cl * A.

So rearranged: A = (2 * m * g) / (rho * v² * Cl).

Plugging in the numbers:

2 * 850 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 1700 *9.81 = let me compute that again. 850 * 2 is 1700. 1700 *9.81.

Compute 1700 *9 =15300; 1700 *0.81= 1377. So total is 15300 +1377=16677 N. That's correct.

Denominator: rho=1.225, v=69.444, Cl=0.4.

v squared is (69.444)^2 = 4822.9167.

Then denominator: 1.225 * 4822.9167 * 0.4.

Wait, denominator is 1.225 * (v²) * Cl.

Wait, 1.225 *0.4 =0.49.

0.49 * 4822.9167 = let me compute that.

0.4 *4822.9167 =1929.16668.

0.09 *4822.9167 =434.0625.

Adding: 1929.16668 +434.0625 =2363.2292.

So denominator is 2363.2292.

A=16677 / 2363.2292 ≈7.057 m².

Hmm, the options don't have exactly 7.057, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:7.10

B:7.03

C:7.20

D:6.80

E:8.00

F:5.50

G:6.30

H:6.60

I:6.95

J:7.50.

So the closest is A:7.10 and I:6.95.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v squared.

Wait, 69.444 squared: 69.444 *69.444.

Let me compute this more accurately.

69.444 *69.444:

= (70 - 0.556)^2

=70^2 - 2*70*0.556 + (0.556)^2

=4900 - 77.44 + 0.309136.

=4900 -77.44 is 4822.56, plus 0.309136 is 4822.8691.

Which is approximately 4822.87, which is close to what I had before. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator calculation.

Wait, denominator is 1.225 * 4822.87 *0.4.

Wait, 1.225 * 0.4 is 0.49, correct. Then 0.49*4822.87= ?

Let me compute 4822.87 * 0.49.

Hmm, 4822.87 *0.4 = 1929.148.

4822.87 *0.09 = 434.0583.

Adding: 1929.148 +434.0583=2363.2063.

So denominator is 2363.2063.

Numerator is 16677.

So A=16677 /2363.2063.

Let me compute this division.

2363.2063 *7 =16543.4441.

Subtracting from numerator: 16677 -16543.4441= 133.5559.

Now, 133.5559 /2363.2063 ≈0.0565.

So total A≈7.0565 m², which is approximately 7.057 m².

Looking back at the options, the closest is option A:7.10, but perhaps I should look for more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the given speed is in km/h, and I correctly converted it. 250 km/h is 250,000 m/3600 s.

Wait, wait, 250 km/h = 250 * (1000 m)/(3600 s) = (250,000)/(3600) = approx 69.4444 m/s. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 2*m*g with more precision.

2 *850 is 1700, and 1700 *9.81.

Let me compute 1700 *9.81 accurately.

1700 *9=15300.

1700 *0.81=1700 *0.8=1360, 1700*0.01=17 → 1360 +17=1377.

So 15300 +1377=16677. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options have some rounding. Let me see:

If the answer is approximately 7.057, then the closest option is A:7.10 or I:6.95.

Wait, 7.057 is closer to 7.06, which is closer to 7.06 than to 7.10 or 6.95.

Looking at the options, option I is 6.95, which is 0.107 less than 7.057, and option A is 7.10, which is 0.043 more than 7.057. So 7.057 is closer to 7.10 than to 6.95.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, 1.225 *4822.9167 = let me compute it again.

1.225 *4822.9167.

Compute 4822.9167 *1 =4822.9167.

4822.9167 *0.2=964.58334.

4822.9167 *0.02=96.458334.

4822.9167 *0.005=24.1145835.

Adding all together: 4822.9167 +964.58334=5787.50004.

Plus 96.458334 is 5883.95837.

Plus 24.1145835 is 5908.07295.

So 1.225 *4822.9167 =5908.07295.

Then multiply by 0.4 gives 5908.07295 *0.4=2363.22918.

So denominator is 2363.22918.

So 16677 /2363.22918= let's compute this more accurately.

Compute 2363.22918 ×7 =16543.20426.

Subtracting from 16677: 16677 -16543.20426=133.79574.

Now, 133.79574 /2363.22918 ≈0.0566 (since 2363.22918 ×0.056=132.581, and 0.0566×2363.22918≈133.3).

Wait, 0.0566 *2363.22918 = let's compute:

0.05 *2363.22918=118.161595.

0.006 *2363.22918=14.179375.

0.0006 *2363.22918≈1.41795.

Adding: 118.161595 +14.179375=132.34097 +1.41795≈133.7589.

So 0.0566 gives approximately 133.7589, which is very close to our remainder of 133.79574. So the division is 7.0566, approximately 7.0566 m².

So approximately 7.057 m².

Looking at the options again:

A is 7.10

B is7.03

I is6.95.

So 7.057 is closest to 7.06, which isn't an option, but perhaps the closest option is A:7.10, but that's 0.043 higher. Alternatively, perhaps the options have some rounding, maybe to two decimal places.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the lift equation. Oh wait, lift is (1/2) rho v² Cl A. Yes, that's correct.

Another possibility: the given speed is in km/h, and I correctly converted it to m/s. Yes, 250 divided by 3.6 is 69.444 m/s.

Wait another thing: the question asks for the effective lift area, which is the same as the wing area in this context, right?

Another point: the value of g. Did I use 9.81 m/s²? Yes.

Wait, perhaps the air density is different. Wait, standard conditions at sea level is 1.225 kg/m³, which I used. Correct.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 7.057 m². Looking at the options, the closest is 7.06, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 7.03, which is option B, but that would require our calculation to be lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division step.

Let me try the division again.

16677 divided by 2363.22918.

I can write it as 16677 ÷2363.22918.

Let me see, 2363.22918 ×7 =16543.20426.

Subtracting from 16677:

16677.00000

-16543.20426

= 133.79574.

Now, bring down a zero (treating this as 133.795740).

Now, 2363.22918 goes into 1337.9574 how many times? Well, 2363 ×0.5 is 1181.5, so 0.056 times as before.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 133.79574 /2363.22918.

So 133.79574 ÷2363.22918 ≈0.0566.

So the total is 7.0566 m², which is approximately 7.057 m².

So I think the correct answer is approximately 7.06 m², but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options include I:6.95 m². Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator or denominator.

Wait, let me check the numerator again. 2*m*g is 2*850*9.81=1700*9.81=16677. Correct.

Denominator: rho*v²*Cl=1.225*(69.444)^2*0.4.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 69.444 squared as 4822.9167, correct.

1.225 *4822.9167=5908.07295.

Multiply by Cl (0.4):5908.07295 *0.4=2363.22918.

Yes.

So 16677 /2363.22918=7.0566.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer to be rounded to two decimal places, so 7.06, but the closest option is A:7.10. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, but assuming the options are correct, perhaps the intended answer is 7.03, which is option B. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v squared. Let me recalculate 69.444 squared.

69.444 squared: 69
