Question:

Before a proposal to merge two towns was placed on a ballot, the state attorney general issued an advisory opinion stating that the measure did not, in her opinion, violate any statutory or constitutional provisions. Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both towns. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from one of the towns initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the proposal. The suit reached the state supreme court and was found to be constitutional under both state and federal law. The plaintiffs now file a motion seeking to have thiscase reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court. The Court may

Options:

A: not hear the case, because it was decided on independent state grounds.
B: not hear the case, because the U.S. Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over state matters
C: not hear the case, but may have it remanded to federal district court.
D: hear the case because it involves a constitutional issue
E: hear the federal issues involved, but decline to rule on the state issue.
F: hear the case, but only rule on the constitutionality of the merger
G: hear the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs have a right to a federal hearing
H: rely on the advisory opinion rendered by the state attorney general and not hear the case on its merits.
I: not hear the case, because the U.S. Supreme Court does not review state supreme court decisions unless federal law is violated.
J: not hear the case, because the state supreme court's decision is final

Okay, so I have this question about the U.S. Supreme Court's jurisdiction, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a merger between two towns. Before the proposal was on the ballot, the state attorney general gave an advisory opinion saying it didn't violate any laws or the constitution. Then the voters passed it. After the election but before the merger happened, two taxpayers sued to stop it, claiming it's unconstitutional. The state supreme court found it constitutional under both state and federal law. Now the plaintiffs want the U.S. Supreme Court to review it.

So the question is what the U.S. Supreme Court can do. The options are A through J.

I remember that the U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to review state court decisions, particularly when federal questions are involved. But there are some exceptions and rules about when they can do that.

Option A says the Court may not hear the case because it was decided on independent state grounds. I recall the independent state grounds doctrine, which says that if a state court decision is based on state law that's independent and adequate to support the judgment, the Supreme Court won't review it. But in this case, the state supreme court considered both state and federal constitutional issues. So if the decision was based on federal grounds as well, then the Supreme Court can review it. So A might not be correct because the case involves federal issues, not just independent state grounds.

Option B claims the Court doesn't have jurisdiction over state matters. That's not right because the Supreme Court does have appellate jurisdiction over state courts when federal questions are involved, under Article III. So B is incorrect.

Option C suggests the Court won't hear it but may remand to federal district court. Remanding usually happens if the Court finds a lower court made a mistake, but in this case, the state supreme court already decided it. Plus, the U.S. Supreme Court can review state court decisions directly without remanding. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D says the Court will hear it because it's a constitutional issue. Well, the Court does have the authority to hear cases involving federal constitutional issues. But it's not mandatory; the Court can choose whether to grant certiorari. So it's possible, but I'm not sure if it's the best option yet.

Option E suggests the Court will hear the federal issues but not the state ones. That makes sense because the Supreme Court's main role is to interpret federal law and the Constitution, not state laws. So if the state court decision rested on both state and federal grounds, the Supreme Court could review the federal aspects. So E might be a good candidate.

Option F says they'll hear it and rule only on the merger's constitutionality. That sounds too narrow because the case involves both state and federal issues. The Court could choose to address only the federal parts, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to frame it.

Option G claims the Court will hear it because plaintiffs have a right to a federal hearing. I don't think that's accurate. The Supreme Court isn't obligated to hear every case; it's discretionary unless it's a mandatory appeal, which this isn't. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H says the Court will rely on the state attorney general's opinion and not hear the case. Advisory opinions are just thatâ€”advisory. They don't bind the courts, so the Supreme Court wouldn't necessarily rely on that to refuse the case. So H is unlikely.

Option I states the Court won't hear it unless federal law was violated. But the state court already found the law constitutional under federal standards. So if there's no federal issue left, the Court might not take it. But earlier, the plaintiffs attacked on constitutional grounds, so maybe there's still a federal question. I'm a bit confused here. The question is whether the Court can or cannot review based on certain criteria.

Option J says the Court won't hear it because the state supreme court's decision is final. But that's not true because the U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court and can review state court decisions when federal issues are involved. So J is incorrect.

Now, going back to the options. The state supreme court ruled on both state and federal grounds. The U.S. Supreme Court can review the federal issues. However, if the state court's decision was based on independent and adequate state grounds, the Supreme Court cannot review it. But in this case, the state court also decided federal constitutional issues, so the independent state grounds doctrine wouldn't block review of those federal issues.

Wait, the question says the state supreme court found it constitutional under both state and federal law. So the decision could be supported by either, meaning that even if one is wrong, the other is enough. But the U.S. Supreme Court can review the federal issues if they were decided. So the Court has the authority to hear the case on the federal issues.

Looking back at the options, E says they'll hear the federal issues but not the state ones. That sounds correct because the Court only reviews federal questions. Alternatively, D says they'll hear it because it's a constitutional issue, but the Court doesn't have to take every constitutional case; it's within their discretion.

Wait, the question is about what the Court "may" do, not what it must do. So it's possible for the Court to choose whether to review. But the options are about what the Court can do, not whether it must.

So if the case involves a federal constitutional issue, the Court has the authority to review it, but it's discretionary. So the Court may decide to hear it because it involves a constitutional issue (D), or it may choose to hear only the federal parts (E). But the question is about whether the Court can hear the case at all.

The key point is that when a state court decision is based on both state and federal grounds, and the federal grounds are sufficient to uphold the decision, the U.S. Supreme Court can review the federal issues. So the Court has the authority to review the federal issues.

So option E seems correct: the Court can hear the federal issues but doesn't have to address the state ones.

Alternatively, option D says they'll hear it because it's a constitutional issue. But it's more accurate that they can hear the federal parts, not necessarily the whole case.

I think E is the better choice. So the answer should be E.

The U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to review state court decisions when federal questions, such as constitutional issues, are involved. In this case, the state supreme court ruled on both state and federal constitutional grounds. The independent state grounds doctrine does not apply here because the decision also addressed federal issues, allowing the U.S. Supreme Court to review those aspects.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because the case involves federal constitutional issues, so the independent state grounds doctrine does not bar review.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction over state matters involving federal questions.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because remanding to federal district court is unnecessary when the state supreme court has already decided the case.
- **Option D**: While the Court may hear the case due to constitutional issues, it is not obligated to do so and can choose which parts to review.
- **Option E**: Correct because the Court can review the federal issues while declining to address the state issues, as its primary role is to interpret federal law and the Constitution.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because the Court is not limited to ruling only on the constitutionality of the merger; it can address broader federal issues.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because the plaintiffs do not have an automatic right to a federal hearing; the Court's review is discretionary.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because advisory opinions are non-binding and do not influence the Court's decision to hear a case.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because the Court can review state court decisions when federal issues are involved, regardless of whether federal law was "violated."
- **Option J**: Incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court is the final authority and can review state court decisions involving federal questions.

The most accurate answer is **Option E**, as the U.S. Supreme Court may choose to review the federal constitutional issues while declining to address the state-specific issues.

**Answer: E**
