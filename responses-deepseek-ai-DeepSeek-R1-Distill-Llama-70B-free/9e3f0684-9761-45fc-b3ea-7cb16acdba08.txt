Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out how much I need to deposit annually at a 6% interest rate over ten years to end up with $300,000. Hmm, I think this is a present value of an annuity problem. Let me try to remember how that works.

Wait, right, an annuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals. Since the payments are annual, each year I put in the same amount, and that earns interest over time. So the formula I need is probably the present value of an ordinary annuity formula.

The formula for the present value (PV) of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

Where:
- PV is the present value (the amount we need to find the PMT for),
- PMT is the annual payment,
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal),
- n is the number of years.

Wait, but in this question, the PV is actually the future value we're targeting, which is $300,000. Or am I getting it wrong? No, wait, the present value here is the initial amount, but since we're making payments each year, maybe I need to think differently. Oh wait no, no, wait. No, the present value here is the sum needed today to reach the future value through the annuity payments. Or wait, maybe I'm confusing present and future value.

Wait, no, the question is about the amount that must be deposited annually. So each year, you put in an amount, say PMT, and each of those PMTs earns interest for a different number of years. So the total future value after ten years is the sum of each PMT compounded annually for their respective periods.

So the formula for the future value of an annuity is:

FV = PMT * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Ah yes, that's right. Because each payment grows at r for a different number of periods. So I have to rearrange this formula to solve for PMT.

Given that FV is $300,000, r is 6% or 0.06, and n is 10 years.

So plugging in the numbers:

300,000 = PMT * [ ( (1 + 0.06)^10 - 1 ) / 0.06 ]

I need to compute the value inside the brackets first.

Let me calculate (1.06)^10. I remember that 1.06^10 is approximately 1.790847. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, 1.06^5 is about 1.33822557, and 1.06^10 is that squared, so 1.33822557^2. Let's see, 1.3382 * 1.3382. 1.3 *1.3 is 1.69, 0.0382*1.3 is about 0.04966, so maybe around 1.79. So I'll go with 1.790847.

So (1.790847 - 1) = 0.790847.

Then divide that by 0.06: 0.790847 / 0.06 = approximately 13.1741.

So the equation becomes:

300,000 = PMT * 13.1741

To solve for PMT, divide both sides by 13.1741:

PMT = 300,000 / 13.1741 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 300,000 / 13.1741.

Hmm, 13.1741 * 22,000 = ?

Let me see, 13 * 22,000 = 286,000. 0.1741 *22,000 is about 3,830. So total around 289,830. Close to 300k, but a bit less.

Wait, perhaps I should do the division more accurately.

300,000 ÷ 13.1741.

Let me compute 300000 /13.1741.

Let me approximate:

13.1741 × 22,761 = ?

Wait, that's probably one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: $22,761

B: $15,000

C: $20,000

D: $18,500

E: $30,000

F: $34,000

G: $26,500

H: $28,250

I: $25,000

J: $32,000

So option A is 22,761. Let me see if that's correct.

Wait, let me compute 22,761 × 13.1741.

22,761 × 13 = 296,  (22,761 ×10=227,610) + (22,761 ×3=68,283) → 227,610 +68,283=295,893.

Then 22,761 × 0.1741= let's see:

0.1 ×22,761=2,276.1

0.07 ×22,761=1,593.27

0.0041 ×22,761≈93.21

Adding these: 2,276.1 +1,593.27=3,869.37 +93.21≈3,962.58.

So total is 295,893 +3,962.58≈299,855.58, which is very close to 300,000. So option A's PMT of $22,761 gives approximately $299,855.58, which is about $300k. So that seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should check another way. Let me compute 300,000 /13.1741.

Let me do the division step by step.

13.1741 goes into 300,000 how many times?

First, 13.1741 × 22,000 = 289,  as before. 22,000 ×13.1741=289,  let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 22,000 ×13.1741 = 22,000×13 +22,000×0.1741.

22,000×13=286,000.

22,000 × 0.1741= 3,830.2.

So total 286,000 +3,830.2=289,830.2.

So 22,000 gives us 289,830.20.

The difference between 300,000 and 289,830.20 is 10,169.80.

Now, how much more PMT is needed to cover the 10,169.80?

Each additional dollar in PMT contributes approximately 13.1741 dollars to the FV.

So 10,169.80 /13.1741 ≈ about 771. So adding 771 to 22,000 gives 22,771. But that's not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute 300,000 /13.1741.

Let me do it step by step.

So 13.1741 × 22,761 = ?

22,761 ×13 = 295,  as before.

Wait, but perhaps better to compute 300,000 ÷13.1741.

Let me compute 13.1741 × 22,761: 22,761 ×13=295,893, and 22,761 ×0.1741≈3,962.5, so total is 299,855.5, which is very close to 300k. So 22,761 is the correct PMT.

Looking at the options, option A is $22,761. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the annual deposit required to yield $300,000 at an annual interest rate of 6% over ten years, we use the formula for the future value of an annuity:

\[
FV = PMT \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( FV = 300,000 \) (target future value),
- \( r = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 10 \) (number of years),
- \( PMT \) is the annual payment to be determined.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( PMT \):

\[
PMT = \frac{FV \times r}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

First, calculate \( (1 + r)^n \):
\[
(1 + 0.06)^{10} \approx 1.790847
\]

Then, compute the denominator:
\[
(1.790847 - 1) / 0.06 = 0.790847 / 0.06 \approx 13.1741
\]

Now, solve for \( PMT \):
\[
PMT = \frac{300,000}{13.1741} \approx 22,761
\]

Thus, the annual deposit required is approximately $22,761. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**A: $22,761**
