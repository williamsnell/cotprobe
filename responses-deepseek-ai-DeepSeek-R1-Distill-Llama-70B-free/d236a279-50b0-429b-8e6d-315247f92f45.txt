Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the work done on a crate. I remember that work is related to force and distance. Oh right, the formula is work equals force multiplied by distance, right? So W = F * d.

Wait, but what's the force here? The crate has a mass of 100 kg, so I think the force they're talking about is the gravitational force, which is the weight. Because when you lift something, you're working against gravity. So the force would be the mass multiplied by acceleration due to gravity. Oh wait, what's the value of g? I think it's about 9.8 m/s².

So the force F is m * g. That would be 100 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me calculate that. 100 times 9 is 900, and 100 times 0.8 is 80, so 900 +80=980 N. So the force is 980 Newtons.

The distance it's lifted is 2 meters. So the work done should be 980 N * 2 m. Let me do that math. 980 times 2 is 1960 Joules. Hmm, that's the work done.

Wait a second, let me look at the options. The options are A:200, B:3000, C:400, D:1000, E:2400, F:800, G:2000, H:500, I:1600, J:1200. Oh wait, none of these options are 1960. Did I do something wrong?

Hmm, maybe I used the wrong value for g. Oh wait, sometimes in problems, especially simpler ones, they approximate g as 10 m/s² instead of 9.8. Let me try that. So 100 kg * 10 m/s² = 1000 N. Then work is 1000 N * 2 m = 2000 J. Oh, that's option G.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify to use g=10. It just says the crate is hoisted. I'm a bit confused. Should I use 9.8 or 10? In real calculations, 9.8 is more accurate, but maybe the problem expects 10 for simplicity. Let me check the options again. 1960 isn't there, but 2000 is (option G). So probably the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for something else, like power instead of work. Wait no, the question definitely says work, so power isn't involved here. Power is work over time. Oh wait, the time given is 4 seconds. But work doesn't use time; power does. So the work is just force times distance, regardless of time. So the 4 seconds is a red herring here, or perhaps part of a different calculation.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in calculating the force? Let me double-check. Mass is 100 kg. So 100 * 10 is 1000 N, that's correct. 100 *9.8 is 980 N. So the work with g=9.8 is 1960 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question expects g=10, giving 2000 J, option G.

I think that's the case. So the answer should be G: 2000 J.

The work done on the crate is calculated using the formula \( W = F \cdot d \), where \( F \) is the force and \( d \) is the distance. The force required to lift the crate is its weight, which is \( F = m \cdot g \). Given the mass \( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \) and assuming \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (a common approximation in such problems), the force is:

\[
F = 100 \cdot 10 = 1000 \, \text{N}.
\]

The distance lifted is \( d = 2 \, \text{m} \), so the work done is:

\[
W = 1000 \cdot 2 = 2000 \, \text{J}.
\]

Although using \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) yields \( W = 1960 \, \text{J} \), this value is not among the provided options. Since \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is likely intended for simplicity, the correct answer is:

**G: 2000 J.**
