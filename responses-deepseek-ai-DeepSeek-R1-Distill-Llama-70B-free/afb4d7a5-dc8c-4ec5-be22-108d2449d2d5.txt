Okay, so I've got this question about Laplace transforms, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question gives me the Laplace transform of f(t) = e^(kt), where k is a complex constant. I need to find the Laplace transforms for four functions: cosh(kt), sinh(kt), cos(kt), and sin(kt). There are multiple-choice options, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the Laplace transform of e^(kt) is 1/(s - k). That's given. But wait, since k is complex, it's Re{k} + i Im{k}, right? So when I plug that into the transform, it will handle both real and imaginary parts.

Now, I need to find the transforms for the hyperbolic functions first: cosh and sinh. I recall that cosh and sinh can be expressed in terms of exponentials. Specifically, cosh(kt) = [e^(kt) + e^(-kt)] / 2 and sinh(kt) = [e^(kt) - e^(-kt)] / 2. So maybe I can use the linearity of the Laplace transform here.

For L{cosh(kt)}, taking the Laplace transform of each term: L{e^(kt)} is 1/(s - k), and L{e^(-kt)} is 1/(s + k). So adding them and dividing by 2 gives [1/(s - k) + 1/(s + k)] / 2. Let me compute that. Let's see, 1/(s - k) + 1/(s + k) equals [ (s + k) + (s - k) ) ] / (s^2 - k^2) ). The numerator becomes 2s, so when I divide by 2, it's (2s)/2 = s. So overall, L{cosh(kt)} = s / (s^2 - k^2).

Wait, but wait—hold on. Because in the given options, I have to see if this matches any of them. For example, looking at option J: L{cosh kt} is s/(s² -k²), which matches what I just got. So that's correct for cosh.

Next, L{sinh(kt)} is similar. Using the expression sinh(kt) = [e^(kt) - e^(-kt)]/2. Taking Laplace transforms: [1/(s -k) - 1/(s +k)] / 2. Combining the fractions: [ (s +k) - (s -k) ) ] / (s² -k²) ) divided by 2. The numerator is 2k, so divided by 2 gives k/(s² -k²). So L{sinh(kt)} = k/(s² -k²).

Looking at the options again, in option J, L{sinh kt} is k/(s² -k²), which matches. So that's good so far.

Now, moving on to the trigonometric functions: cos(kt) and sin(kt). Since k is a complex constant, I think Euler's formula applies here. Euler's formula states that e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. So maybe I can express cos(kt) and sin(kt) using exponentials and then take the Laplace transform.

Wait, but in this case, k is complex. Let me denote k as a complex number, say k = a + ib, where a and b are real. Then kt would be (a + ib)t. But perhaps it's easier to consider k as a purely imaginary number, but wait, no. Wait, the question allows k to be complex, but when dealing with cos(kt) and sin(kt), perhaps we can express them in terms of exponential functions with real exponents multiplied by complex terms. Alternatively, maybe I can think of cos(kt) as [e^(ikt) + e^(-ikt)] / 2, but that's when k is real. Hmm, but in this case, k is complex. Maybe a better approach is to note that cos(kt) can be written as the real part of e^(ikt), but I'm not sure if that applies directly here.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Normally, for real functions, cos(ωt) is [e^(iωt) + e^(-iωt)]/2. But in this problem, k is a complex constant, so when I write cos(kt), it's the hyperbolic or trigonometric cosine of a complex argument. Wait, but in the context of Laplace transforms, when we have functions like cos(kt) where k is complex, it's treated as a function whose Laplace transform can be found using the exponential form.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express cos(kt) and sin(kt) in terms of e^(kt) and e^(-kt), but with k being complex.

Wait, let me think about the standard Laplace transforms. Normally, for real k, L{cos(kt)} = s/(s² +k²), and L{sin(kt)} = k/(s² +k²). But here, k is complex, so the s² +k² might involve complex numbers.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step. Let's express cos(kt) as [e^(ikt) + e^(-ikt)] / 2. Wait, no, because if k is complex, then ik would be multiplying t. Alternatively, perhaps using hyperbolic functions when k is imaginary.

Wait, maybe I should think of k as a complex variable, so when I take cos(kt), it's the same as the real part of e^(i(kt)), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed as follows.

Express cos(kt) as [e^{i(kt)} + e^{-i(kt)}]/2. Then, taking Laplace transform:

L{cos(kt)} = (1/2)[ L{e^{i kt}} + L{e^{-i kt}} } ]

We know that L{e^{kt}} = 1/(s -k), so for e^{i kt}, that's 1/(s - ik), and for e^{-i kt}, that's 1/(s + ik). So:

L{cos(kt)} = (1/2)[ 1/(s - ik) + 1/(s + ik) ) ]

Let me compute that. The two terms combine as [ (s + ik) + (s - ik) ) ] / ( (s - ik)(s + ik) ) ) * (1/2)

The numerator becomes 2s. The denominator is s² + k² (since (s - ik)(s + ik) = s² - (ik)^2 = s² + k²). So:

L{cos(kt)} = (2s)/(2(s² + k²)) ) = s/(s² +k²).

Wait, but that's the same as the standard Laplace transform of cos(kt) when k is real. So that's correct. So L{cos kt} = s/(s² +k²).

Similarly, for sin(kt), we can write it as [e^{i kt} - e^{-i kt}]/(2i). Taking Laplace transform:

L{sin(kt)} = (1/(2i)) [ L{e^{i kt}} - L{e^{-i kt}} } ]

Which is (1/(2i)) [ 1/(s - ik) - 1/(s + ik) ) ]

Let me compute that. The numerator becomes [ (s + ik) - (s - ik) ) ] / ( (s - ik)(s + ik) ) ) * (1/(2i)).

The numerator here is [ s + ik - s + ik ] = 2ik.

So:

[2ik ] / (s² +k²) ) * (1/(2i)) ) = (2ik)/(2i (s² +k²)) ) = k/(s² +k²).

So L{sin(kt)} = k/(s² +k²).

Now, let's check which option matches these results.

So summarizing:

L{cosh(kt)} = s/(s² -k²)
L{sinh(kt)} = k/(s² -k²)
L{cos(kt)} = s/(s² +k²)
L{sin(kt)} = k/(s² +k²)

Looking at the options:

Option J says:

L{cosh kt} = [s/(s^2 -k^2)], which matches.

L{sinh kt} = [k/(s^2 -k^2)], which matches.

L{cos kt} = [s/(s^2 +k^2)], which matches.

L{sin kt} = [k/(s^2 +k^2)], which matches.

So option J is correct.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure. Option J is the only one that fits all four transforms correctly. For example, option F has L{cosh} as s/(s² +k²), which is wrong because for cosh it should be s/(s² -k²). So F is incorrect.

Option J is the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we start with the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = e^{kt} \), where \( k \) is a complex constant, given as \( \mathcal{L}\{e^{kt}\} = \frac{1}{s - k} \). Using this, we derive the Laplace transforms of \( \cosh(kt) \), \( \sinh(kt) \), \( \cos(kt) \), and \( \sin(kt) \) by expressing these functions in terms of exponentials and applying the linearity of the Laplace transform.

1. **Hyperbolic Functions**:
   - \( \cosh(kt) = \frac{e^{kt} + e^{-kt}}{2} \): Taking the Laplace transform, we get:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\cosh(kt)\} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{s - k} + \frac{1}{s + k} \right) = \frac{s}{s^2 - k^2}.
     \]
   - \( \sinh(kt) = \frac{e^{kt} - e^{-kt}}{2} \): Taking the Laplace transform, we get:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\sinh(kt)\} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{s - k} - \frac{1}{s + k} \right) = \frac{k}{s^2 - k^2}.
     \]

2. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - \( \cos(kt) = \frac{e^{ikt} + e^{-ikt}}{2} \): Taking the Laplace transform, we get:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\cos(kt)\} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{s - ik} + \frac{1}{s + ik} \right) = \frac{s}{s^2 + k^2}.
     \]
   - \( \sin(kt) = \frac{e^{ikt} - e^{-ikt}}{2i} \): Taking the Laplace transform, we get:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\sin(kt)\} = \frac{1}{2i} \left( \frac{1}{s - ik} - \frac{1}{s + ik} \right) = \frac{k}{s^2 + k^2}.
     \]

3. **Matching with Options**:
   - From the derived results:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\cosh(kt)\} = \frac{s}{s^2 - k^2}, \quad \mathcal{L}\{\sinh(kt)\} = \frac{k}{s^2 - k^2},
     \]
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\cos(kt)\} = \frac{s}{s^2 + k^2}, \quad \mathcal{L}\{\sin(kt)\} = \frac{k}{s^2 + k^2}.
     \]
   - Comparing with the options, only **Option J** matches all four transforms:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\cosh(kt)\} = \frac{s}{s^2 - k^2}, \quad \mathcal{L}\{\sinh(kt)\} = \frac{k}{s^2 - k^2},
     \]
     \[
     \mathcal{L}\{\cos(kt)\} = \frac{s}{s^2 + k^2}, \quad \mathcal{L}\{\sin(kt)\} = \frac{k}{s^2 + k^2}.
     \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J**
