Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the ionization energy of singly ionized helium using the Bohr theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Wait, ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom, right? So for singly ionized helium, that means removing the only electron left, because helium normally has two electrons. But when it's singly ionized, He+, it has only one electron. So we're looking to ionize that last electron.

I remember that in the Bohr model, the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms (which have only one electron) can be calculated using the formula E_n = - (Z² * R_H) / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. But wait, helium has a nuclear charge Z of 2, right? So Z would be 2 here.

Oh wait, the Rydberg constant R_H is about 13.6 eV. So for helium, the energy levels would be scaled by Z squared, which is 4 in this case. So the energy levels for He+ would be E_n = - (4 * 13.6 eV) / n².

But wait, the ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from the ground state to infinity, which is n approaching infinity. So the ionization energy is the difference between the ground state energy (n=1) and when the electron is free (E=0). So the energy required would be the absolute value of the ground state energy.

So E_ground = - (4 * 13.6) / 1² = -54.4 eV. Therefore, the ionization energy would be 54.4 eV. But I need to check the options provided.

Looking at the options, option G is 54.394 eV, which is very close to 54.4. There's a slight difference, probably due to a more precise value of the Rydberg constant. Let me think about the exact value of R_H.

Oh right, the Rydberg constant is approximately 13.6057 eV. So let's recalculate with that exact value. Z=2, so 2 squared is 4.

E = - (4 * 13.6057) eV. So that's 4 * 13.6057 = 54.4228 eV. But wait, ionization energy is the positive value, so 54.4228 eV. Looking back at the options, option G is 54.394, which is a bit lower. Hmmm. Did I miss something?

Wait, another thought: sometimes the Rydberg constant is given in terms of kJ/mol as well. Oh wait, the question asks for the answer in both eV and kJ/mol. Oh wait, no, the options are given in eV and kJ·mol⁻¹. Wait, looking again, the options A to J are in eV except option D is in eV as well. Wait, the options provided are all eV except option D, but D says 60.321 eV. Wait, no, looking again:

Options:

A: 48.359 eV

B:52.307 eV

C:70.215 eV

D:60.321 eV

E:49.977 eV

F:45.678 eV

G:54.394 eV

H:50.456 eV

I:58.642 eV

J:65.123 eV

So G is 54.394 eV, which is close to what I calculated. Why the slight discrepancy? Oh, perhaps because I used 13.6 as an approximate value. Let me compute it more precisely.

R_H is approximately 13.605698 eV. So 4 * 13.605698 = 54.422793 eV. So 54.4228 eV. But option G is 54.394. Hmm, that's a bit off. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait another thought: maybe the formula uses the ionization energy as the energy released when the electron is bound, so the ionization energy is positive 54.42 eV. But perhaps in some references, the Rydberg constant is taken as 13.6 eV exactly, leading to 54.4 eV. But the options don't have exactly that.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 54.394. That's very close but not exactly 54.4. Is there another factor I'm missing? Oh wait, maybe the Rydberg constant used in the problem is 13.6 eV, not the more precise 13.6057. If I use 13.6 eV, then the ionization energy would be 4 * 13.6 = 54.4 eV. But none of the options have 54.4. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up eV and kJ/mol?

Wait, the question also asks for the value in kJ·mol⁻¹. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute it in both units. Wait, but the options only provide eV options. Oh no, the question is just to select from the options given, which are in eV. So perhaps the correct option is G:54.394 eV.

Wait, but why the exact value is 54.394? Let me compute using 13.6057 eV. So 4 * 13.6057 = 54.4228. But that's 54.4228 eV. The option G is 54.394, which is 54.394. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check if the formula is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the ionization energy formula is 13.6 * Z² eV. So for He+, Z=2. So 13.6 * 4 = 54.4 eV.

But the options don't have 54.4. The closest is G:54.394. Maybe the exact value uses more precise constants. Let me think: the Rydberg constant is 13.605693 eV. So 4 * 13.605693 = 54.422773 eV. Hmm, but that's still not matching any of the options exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the ionization energy in kJ/mol as well, but the options only give eV. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the Rydberg constant with the ionization energy of hydrogen. Let me think: the ionization energy of hydrogen is 13.6 eV (from the Bohr model). Then, for He+, it's Z² times that, so 4 * 13.6 = 54.4 eV.

Looking back, option G is 54.394, which is very close to 54.4. It's possible that the options have rounded it, or maybe used a slightly different Rydberg value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me recheck: the ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from n=1 to n=infinity. So the energy of the electron in the ground state is E1 = -54.4 eV. So the ionization energy is +54.4 eV.

So the closest option is G:54.394 eV. Maybe the exact calculation with precise R_H gives 54.394 instead of 54.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers. Let me compute 4 * 13.6057 eV.

13.6057 * 4 = 54.4228 eV. Hmm, which is not matching any of the options. So perhaps the question expects the value without considering more precise Rydberg constants.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in thinking that He+ has Z=2. Wait, He+ has a nucleus charge of +2, with one electron. So yes, Z=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ionization energy in terms of kJ/mol, but the options are all in eV. So perhaps the answer is 54.4 eV, which is not exactly an option, but the closest is G:54.394.

Wait, reviewing the options again: option B is 52.307, which is 13.6 * 3.85, but I don't know. Option G is the only one close to 54.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ionization energy in kJ/mol as well, but the options don't provide that. The question states that the answer should be in eV and in kJ/mol, but the options are all single values. Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the eV part, but the options are labeled as eV or kJ, but looking back, the options are all eV except D and perhaps others? Wait, no, looking back:

Options A-J: All are eV except perhaps D, but no, D is 60.321 eV. So all options are in eV.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct Bohr model calculation gives 54.4 eV, and the closest option is G:54.394 eV. So I think the correct answer is G.

To calculate the ionization energy of singly ionized helium (He⁺) using the Bohr theory, we start by recognizing that He⁺ is a hydrogen-like atom with a nuclear charge \( Z = 2 \). The energy levels of such atoms are given by the formula:

\[
E_n = -\frac{Z^2 \cdot R_H}{n^2}
\]

where \( R_H \) is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, approximately \( 13.6 \, \mathrm{eV} \) (or more precisely \( 13.6057 \, \mathrm{eV} \)).

For the ground state (\( n = 1 \)) of He⁺, the energy is:

\[
E_1 = -\frac{2^2 \cdot R_H}{1^2} = -4 \cdot R_H
\]

Substituting \( R_H = 13.6 \, \mathrm{eV} \), we find:

\[
E_1 = -4 \cdot 13.6 = -54.4 \, \mathrm{eV}
\]

The ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from the ground state to infinity, which is the absolute value of \( E_1 \):

\[
\text{Ionization Energy} = +54.4 \, \mathrm{eV}
\]

Using the more precise value of \( R_H = 13.6057 \, \mathrm{eV} \), the ionization energy becomes:

\[
\text{Ionization Energy} = 4 \cdot 13.6057 = 54.4228 \, \mathrm{eV}
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value to \( 54.4 \, \mathrm{eV} \) or \( 54.4228 \, \mathrm{eV} \) is \( 54.394 \, \mathrm{eV} \), which corresponds to option G. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight variations in the constants used.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: 54.394 eV**
