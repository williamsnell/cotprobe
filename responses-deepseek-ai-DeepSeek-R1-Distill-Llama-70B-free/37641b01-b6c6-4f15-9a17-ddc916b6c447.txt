Alright, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the rate of return on an investment. Let's see, I need to buy a machine for $1,000, and it's supposed to save me $150 every year for the next 10 years. The question is asking for the rate of return on this investment, and I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when calculating the return on investment, especially for something like this, it's probably an internal rate of return (IRR) problem. Because we're looking at the cash flows over time and determining the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) zero.

So the initial outlay is $1,000, which is a cash outflow. Then each year, I save $150, which is a cash inflow. Since these savings happen every year for 10 years, it's an annuity. So I think the formula for the present value of an annuity applies here.

Wait, the formula for NPV is the present value of all cash inflows minus the initial investment. Since we're looking for the rate of return, the NPV should be zero. So:

NPV = 0 = Initial Outlay + (Annual Savings / (r - (1 + r)^-n)) )

Wait, I think the formula is:

NPV = -Initial Investment + (Cash Inflow * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r])

Right, because the present value of an annuity formula is [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r multiplied by the annual cash flow. So substituting the numbers:

0 = -1000 + 150 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-10 ) / r ]

So I need to solve for r in this equation. Hmm, but solving this equation algebraically might be tricky because r is in both the numerator and denominator, and it's also an exponent. I think I'll have to use trial and error or some approximation method.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the IRR formula or look for a way to approximate it. Let me think about the possible options given and see if any of them fit when I plug them into the equation.

The options are A:14%, B:9.5%, C:8.05%, D:10%, E:8.5%, F:12%, G:11.3%, H:5%, I:7.5%, J:6.2%.

I can maybe try plugging in some of these and see which one brings the NPV close to zero.

Let me start with option C:8.0516%. I wonder why that's an option. Let me try calculating the present value of the $150 annual savings at 8.0516% for 10 years.

The present value factor for an annuity is [1 - (1 + r)^-n]/r.

Plugging in r=8.0516% or 0.080516, and n=10.

So the factor would be [1 - 1/(1.080516)^10] / 0.080516.

Calculating denominator first: (1.080516)^10. Let me compute this.

1.080516^1 =1.080516
^2= approx 1.080516 * 1.080516 ≈ 1.1668
^3≈1.1668*1.0805 ≈1.2593
^4≈1.2593*1.0805≈1.3613
^5≈1.3613*1.0805≈1.4715
^6≈1.4715*1.0805≈1.5906
^7≈1.5906*1.0805≈1.7181
^8≈1.7181*1.0805≈1.8578
^9≈1.8578*1.0805≈2.0089
^10≈2.0089*1.0805≈2.1708.

So 1/(1.080516)^10 ≈ 1 / 2.1708 ≈ 0.4609.

So [1 - 0.4609] = 0.5391. Divided by 0.080516 gives 0.5391 / 0.080516 ≈6.6875.

So the present value of the annuity is 150 * 6.6875 = 1003.125.

Then the NPV is -1000 + 1003.125 = 3.125. That's pretty close to zero, but not exactly. So maybe the correct rate is a little higher than 8.0516%, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check that exponent again. Maybe I miscalculated 1.080516^10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more precise method. Alternatively, use the rule of 78 or another estimation, but perhaps trying another rate would help.

Let's try option E:8.5%. So r=0.085.

Compute [1 - (1.085)^-10 ] / 0.085.

1.085^10: Let me compute that more accurately.

1.085^1=1.085
^2=1.177225
^3=1.2770 (approx)
Wait, maybe using a calculator approach:

Year 1: 1.085
Year 2: 1.085 * 1.085 = 1.177225
Year 3: 1.177225 *1.085 ≈ 1.277 (exact value: 1.177225 *1.085 = 1.285 approximately)
Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate each step:

Year 1: 1.085
Year 2: 1.085 * 1.085 = 1.177225
Year 3: 1.177225 *1.085: Let's compute 1.177225 *1.085.

1.177225 * 1 = 1.177225
1.177225 *0.08 = 0.0941778
1.177225 *0.005=0.005886125
So total ≈1.177225 +0.0941778=1.2714 +0.005886=1.2773.

Year 3: ≈1.2773.

Year4: 1.2773 *1.085.

Compute 1.2773 *1.085:

1.2773 *1 =1.2773
1.2773 *0.08 =0.102184
1.2773 *0.005=0.0063865
Adding: 1.2773 +0.102184=1.3795 +0.0063865≈1.3859.

Year4:≈1.3859.

Year5: 1.3859*1.085.

1.3859 *1.085: Let's compute:

1.3859 *1=1.3859
1.3859 *0.08=0.110872
1.3859 *0.005=0.0069295
Adding: 1.3859 +0.110872=1.49677 +0.0069295≈1.5037.

Year5:≈1.5037.

Year6: 1.5037 *1.085.

1.5037 *0.08=0.1203; 1.5037*0.005=0.0075185. So 1.5037 +0.1203=1.6240 +0.0075=1.6315.

Year6:≈1.6315.

Year7:1.6315 *1.085.

1.6315 *0.08=0.13052; *0.005=0.0081575. So 1.6315 +0.13052=1.7620 +0.0081575≈1.77016.

Year7:≈1.7702.

Year8:1.7702 *1.085.

1.7702 *0.08=0.141616; *0.005=0.008851. Sum:1.7702 +0.141616=1.9118 +0.008851≈1.9207.

Year8:≈1.9207.

Year9:1.9207 *1.085.

1.9207 *0.08=0.153656; *0.005=0.0096035. Sum:1.9207 +0.153656=2.074356 +0.0096035≈2.08396.

Year9:≈2.0840.

Year10:2.0840 *1.085.

2.0840 *0.08=0.16672; *0.005=0.010420. Sum:2.0840 +0.16672=2.25072 +0.01042≈2.26114.

So (1.085)^10≈2.26114.

So 1/(1.085)^10≈1/2.26114≈0.4423.

So [1 - 0.4423] = 0.5577. Divided by 0.085: 0.5577 / 0.085≈6.565.

So the present value is 150 *6.565≈982.5.

Then NPV= -1000 +982.5= -17.5. So that's negative, meaning r=8.5% gives an NPV of -17.5, which is less than zero. So the actual rate must be a bit lower than 8.5% because when we tried r=8.0516%, the NPV was +3.125, and at 8.5% it's -17.5. So the correct rate lies between 8.05% and 8.5%.

Wait, but in the options, option C is 8.0516%, and E is 8.5%. So perhaps the correct answer is C because when I tried 8.0516%, the NPV was 3.125, which is close to zero. Maybe I made a mistake in those calculations.

Wait, but 8.0516% gave me a positive NPV, which suggests that at that rate, the investment is profitable. But the exact rate where NPV=0 would be the IRR.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try another approach, using the IRR formula for an annuity.

The formula for IRR when you have an initial outlay and equal annual receipts is:

r = (Annual Receipt) / (Initial Outlay) * (1 + (1 + n)^0.5 -1 )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. I think it's more accurate to use the Newton-Raphson method, but that might be complicated without a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that IRR for an annuity can be found using the formula:

r ≈ (C / P) * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ]

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the rule of thumb that for an annuity, the IRR can be approximated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the equation and solve for r numerically.

So the equation is:

1000 = 150 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-10 ) / r ]

Let me denote P = 1000, A = 150, n=10.

So P = A * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Which can be rewritten as:

P/A = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So 1000/150 = 6.6667 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-10 ) / r ]

So 6.6667 = [1 - v^10 ] / r, where v = 1/(1 + r)

So, let me denote r as the decimal rate.

So 6.6667 = (1 - (1/(1 + r))^10 ) / r

This is the same as the initial equation. So I need to find r such that this holds.

I can try using trial and error.

We know that at r=8.0516%, the left side was 6.6875, which is higher than 6.6667, meaning that the denominator was a bit low, so perhaps a slightly higher rate will bring it down.

Wait, wait, the present value factor is inversely related to r. So as r increases, the factor decreases.

Wait, when I tried r=8.0516%, the present value of the annuity was 1003.125, which is higher than 1000, so the factor was 6.6875 (which is 1003.125/150).

But we need the factor to be 6.6667 (since 1000/150 ≈6.6667).

So when the factor is 6.6875 at 8.0516%, which is higher than 6.6667, that means the rate is a bit lower than 8.0516% because higher rates lower the factor.

Wait, no. If at 8.0516% the factor is 6.6875, which is higher than 6.6667, that suggests that to get a lower factor, we need a higher rate.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

At r=8.0516%, the present value is 1003.125, which is greater than 1000, so the NPV is positive. We need the rate where the present value equals 1000, so we need a higher rate than 8.0516% to reduce the present value to 1000.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Because when r increases, the present value decreases. So if at 8.0516% the present value is 1003.125, which is higher than 1000, to make it exactly 1000, we need a slightly higher rate, which would bring the present value down.

So, perhaps the correct rate is a bit higher than 8.0516%.

But looking at the options, option C is 8.0516%, and option E is 8.5%. The correct rate is between 8.05% and 8.5%, but closer to 8.05% since at 8.0516% the present value is 1003, which is very close to 1000.

Wait, but when I tried 8.0516%, the present value was 1003.125, so the NPV is +3.125. So the actual IRR is a bit higher than 8.0516% because at that rate, the NPV is still positive. So perhaps trying r=8.1%.

Let me compute the present value factor at 8.1% (0.081).

So (1.081)^10. Let me compute that:

1.081^1=1.081
^2=1.081*1.081≈1.1676
^3=1.1676*1.081≈1.2623
^4=1.2623*1.081≈1.3663
^5=1.3663*1.081≈1.4790
^6=1.4790*1.081≈1.6003
^7=1.6003*1.081≈1.7305
^8=1.7305*1.081≈1.8705
^9=1.8705*1.081≈2.0218
^10=2.0218*1.081≈2.1875.

So 1/(1.081)^10≈1/2.1875≈0.4569.

So [1 - 0.4569] =0.5431. Divided by 0.081: 0.5431 / 0.081≈6.704.

So present value of annuity:150 *6.704≈1005.6.

So NPV= -1000 +1005.6=5.6. Still positive, so rate needs to be higher.

Wait, but I thought at higher rates the present value would be lower. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try r=8.2%.

Compute (1.082)^10.

1.082^1=1.082
^2=1.082*1.082≈1.1697
^3=1.1697*1.082≈1.2660
^4=1.2660*1.082≈1.3711
^5=1.3711*1.082≈1.4848
^6=1.4848*1.082≈1.6077
^7=1.6077*1.082≈1.7400
^8=1.7400*1.082≈1.8814
^9=1.8814*1.082≈2.0345
^10=2.0345*1.082≈2.2027.

So 1/(1.082)^10≈0.4544.

[1-0.4544]=0.5456. Divided by 0.082: 0.5456/0.082≈6.6585.

So present value:150 *6.6585≈999.775.

So NPV≈-1000 +999.775≈-0.225.

That's very close to zero. So at r=8.2%, the NPV is approximately -0.225, which is just slightly negative. So the exact IRR is between 8.1% and 8.2%.

Wait, but the options don't have 8.1% or 8.2%. The closest options are C:8.0516%, E:8.5%, and perhaps others.

Wait, but my calculation at 8.2% gives an NPV of almost zero. So perhaps the correct answer is around 8.2%, but that's not one of the options. Let me check which option is closest.

Looking back at the options: option C is 8.0516%, which we calculated to have an NPV of +3.125, and option E is 8.5%, which gave an NPV of -17.5. Hmm, that seems like a big drop. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should try r=8.05% exactly.

Compute (1.0805)^10:

Wait, I think earlier I tried 8.0516% and got (1.080516)^10≈2.1708, which
