Question:

Black-headed gulls remove broken eggshells from their nests immediately after the young have hatched. Explain the biological significance of this behavior.

Options:

A: Gulls remove eggshells as a part of their feeding habit
B: Gulls use the removed eggshells as a source of calcium for the young birds
C: Eggshell-removing behavior is significant in that it reduces the chances of a nest being robbed, thus enhancing the survival of offspring.
D: The removal of eggshells is a ritualistic behavior with no direct biological significance
E: Gulls remove eggshells to reuse them for building nests
F: Gulls remove eggshells to prevent injury to the young birds in the nest
G: The removal of eggshells is a territorial display to deter rival gulls from the area
H: Eggshells are removed to make space for more eggs to be laid in the same season
I: Removing eggshells helps regulate the temperature within the nest for the young birds
J: The gulls remove the eggshells to keep their nests clean

Okay, so I've got this question about black-headed gulls and why they remove broken eggshells after the young have hatched. Hmm, I'm not exactly a bird expert, but I remember learning a bit about animal behaviors and their purposes. Let me think this through.

The question is asking for the biological significance of this behavior. So, why would gulls do this? Let's look at the options.

Option A says it's part of their feeding habit. Wait, gulls removing eggshells to eat them? I don't think so. The eggshells are from their own nests, so feeding on them doesn't make much sense. Plus, eggshells are mostly calcium, which they might need, but I don't recall gulls eating their own eggshells. Maybe other birds do, but I'm not sure about gulls.

Option B suggests using the shells as a calcium source for the young. That sounds plausible because birds, especially females, need calcium for egg production. But wait, the young have already hatched, so maybe the adults don't need the calcium anymore. Or perhaps the chicks do? I'm not certain about this. But I'm leaning away from this because I think the main reason is more about nest safety than nutrition.

Option C states that removing eggshells reduces nest robbery, enhancing offspring survival. Oh, that makes sense. If the nest is clean, it might be less visible to predators. I remember that some birds remove eggshells to avoid attracting predators. Predators might be drawn to the sight or smell of eggshells. So by removing them, the gulls make the nest less conspicuous, reducing the chance of predation or robbery.

Option D says it's a ritualistic behavior with no direct significance. I don't think so. Most animal behaviors have some evolutionary reason. Ritualistic behaviors usually have some function, even if it's not immediately obvious. So I doubt this is the correct answer.

Option E is about reusing shells for nests. That seems unlikely because eggshells are brittle and not much use for building. Plus, nests are usually made before eggs are laid, so after hatching, I don't think they're building anymore.

Option F is about preventing injury to the chicks. Maybe the sharp edges could hurt them? But chicks are small, and the shells are probably not that sharp. Also, I think the main reason is more related to predators than to injury.

Option G is a territorial display. I don't see how removing eggshells would signal territory. Displays usually involve visual or auditory signals, not cleaning up.

Option H suggests making space for more eggs. But once the eggs have hatched, the breeding season is probably moving on. Also, I don't think gulls lay more eggs in the same nest after some have hatched. They usually have a clutch and that's it for the season.

Option I is about regulating nest temperature. Maybe, but I'm not sure how removing shells would affect temperature. Maybe the shells insulate, but after hatching, the chicks might not need it as much. But I don't recall this being a common reason for birds to remove shells.

Option J is about keeping the nest clean. While that's a possibility, the question is about the biological significance. Keeping the nest clean might prevent disease, but I think the main reason is more about hiding the nest from predators.

Putting it all together, the most logical answer seems to be option C. Removing eggshells reduces the chance of the nest being detected by predators or robbers, thus protecting the young and enhancing their survival chances.

The black-headed gulls' behavior of removing broken eggshells after hatching is best explained by option C. This action reduces the visibility of the nest to predators or potential robbers, thereby enhancing the survival of the offspring. It is a common strategy in many bird species to minimize detection and protect their young. 

Answer: C
