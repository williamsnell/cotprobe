Question:

Each of the four jet engines on an Airbus A380 airliner develops athrust (a forward force on the airliner) of 322,000 N (72,000 lb).When the airplane is flying at 250 m/s, what horsepower does each engine develop? (Unit: hp)

Options:

A: 85000
B: 130000
C: 120000
D: 115000
E: 108000
F: 140000
G: 75000
H: 70000
I: 100000
J: 95000

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about jet engines and horsepower. Hmm, let me think. I remember that horsepower is a unit of power, which relates to work done over time or force times velocity. The problem gives me the thrust each engine produces and the speed of the airplane. I need to find the horsepower per engine.

Wait, the data: each engine develops 322,000 N of thrust. The plane is moving at 250 m/s. Oh right, power is force multiplied by velocity. So P = F * v. That makes sense because power is the rate at which work is done, and work is force times distance, so multiplying by velocity (distance per time) gives power.

So calculating that, 322,000 N times 250 m/s. Let me do that math. 322,000 * 250. Let me break it down. 300,000 *250 = 75,000,000, and 22,000 *250 = 5,500,000. So total is 75,000,000 +5,500,000 = 80,500,000 watts? Because 1 watt is 1 joule per second, which is N*m/s, so yeah, that's the unit.

But wait, the question asks for horsepower, not watts. I remember that 1 horsepower is about 745.7 watts. So I need to convert watts to horsepower. 

So I take the power in watts and divide by 745.7 to get horsepower. So 80,500,000 divided by 745.7. Let me calculate that. 

Hmm, 80,500,000 / 745.7. Let me approximate. 80,500,000 divided by 700 is about 115,000. But since 745.7 is a bit more than 700, the result would be a little less than 115,000. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 80,500,000 ÷ 745.7. Let me see. 745.7 times 100,000 is 74,570,000. Subtract that from 80,500,000: 80,500,000 -74,570,000 = 5,930,000 left. Now, how many times does 745.7 go into 5,930,000? Let's see, 5,930,000 ÷745.7 ≈ around 7950. Wait, that can't be right because adding that to the 100,000 would give way over. Oh wait no, wait, because I already took 100,000 hp, which is 74,570,000 watts. So the remaining 5,930,000 would be 5,930,000 /745.7 ≈ 7950 watts, which is about 7950 /745.7 ≈ 10.66 horsepower. So the total is approximately 100,000 +10.66 = 110,660 hp? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 745.7 * 108,000 is about 80,500,000. Let me check that.

Wait, 108,000 hp = 108,000 * 745.7. Let me compute 100,000 *745.7 =74,570,000. 8,000 *745.7 is 5,965,600. Adding them, 74,570,000 +5,965,600=80,535,600. Oh that's very close to 80,500,000. So 108,000 hp would be approximately 80,535,600 watts, which is just a little over our calculated 80.5 million. So that's about right. So each engine would produce approximately 108,000 horsepower.

Looking at the options, option E is 108,000. So the answer should be E.

To determine the horsepower developed by each engine, we start with the relationship between power, force, and velocity: 

\[
P = F \cdot v
\]

Here, the thrust force \( F \) is 322,000 N, and the velocity \( v \) is 250 m/s. Substituting these values:

\[
P = 322,000 \cdot 250 = 80,500,000 \, \text{W}
\]

Next, we convert watts to horsepower using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{hp} = 745.7 \, \text{W} \):

\[
\text{Horsepower} = \frac{80,500,000}{745.7} \approx 108,000 \, \text{hp}
\]

Thus, each engine develops approximately 108,000 horsepower. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**E: 108,000**
