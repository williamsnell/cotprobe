Okay, so I have this problem about distributing overhead based on floor space. Hmm, I remember that overhead allocation is a common topic in managerial accounting. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that Department A occupied 8,100 square feet out of a total of 121,500 square feet used by the company. The total overhead for the month was $97,500. I need to find out how much of that overhead Department A has to bear.

Wait, so the distribution is based on floor space. That means each department's share is proportional to the square footage they occupy relative to the total. So I should calculate the ratio of Department A's space to the total space and then apply that ratio to the total overhead.

Let me write that down. Department A's space is 8,100 sq ft. Total space is 121,500 sq ft. So the ratio is 8,100 divided by 121,500. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 8,100 divided by 121,500. Let me see... 121,500 divided by 100 is 1,215. 8,100 divided by 1,215? Wait, maybe I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 100, so that's 81/1215. Does that reduce further? Let me see, 81 and 1215. 1215 divided by 81 is 15. Because 81 times 15 is 1215. Oh right, because 81 *10 is 810, 81*5 is 405, so 810+405=1215. So 81/1215 simplifies to 1/15. So 8,100 / 121,500 equals 1/15.

Wait, so the ratio is 1/15. Then the overhead for Department A would be total overhead multiplied by 1/15. The total overhead is $97,500. So 97,500 * (1/15) equals... let me calculate that. 

Well, 97,500 divided by 15. Let me think. 15 times 6,000 is 90,000. That leaves 7,500 remaining. 15 * 500 is 7,500. So 6,000 + 500 is 6,500. So 97,500 /15 is 6,500. Therefore, Department A's share is $6,500.

Looking at the options, option A is $6,500. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine Department A's share of overhead based on floor space, we calculate the proportion of space occupied by Department A relative to the total space. Department A occupies 8,100 sq. ft. out of 121,500 sq. ft., which simplifies to a ratio of 1/15. Applying this ratio to the total overhead of $97,500:

\[
\text{Department A's share} = \frac{1}{15} \times 97,500 = 6,500
\]

Thus, Department A's share of overhead is $6,500.
