Okay, so I've got this question about accounting for a capital projects fund in a county government. I'm a bit rusty on governmental accounting, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that Best County's capital projects fund had certain receipts during the year. The receipts listed are:

1. Transfer from the general fund: $100,000
2. Federal capital grant: $75,000
3. Special assessment for capital improvements: $300,000

And the question is asking what amount of revenues should Best County report in its capital projects fund at the end of the year. The options are A through J, each with a different dollar amount.

Hmm. I remember that in governmental accounting, funds are accounted for differently than a regular business. The capital projects fund is one of the governmental funds, right? So the rules are a bit specific about what's considered revenue for this fund.

Let me think about each of these receipts and how they are treated.

First, the transfer from the general fund. I think transfers between funds are treated as revenues in the receiving fund. So the capital projects fund would record this $100,000 as a transfer from another fund, which is considered revenue. So that's definitely part of the revenues.

Second, the federal capital grant. Grants are also considered revenues. But wait, I'm a bit confused about when they're recognized. If the grant is for a specific project, it's probably recognized when it's received or when the eligibility criteria are met. Here, it's given as a receipt, so I assume it's been received during the year. So the $75,000 would be revenue as well.

Third, the special assessment for capital improvements. Special assessments are levied on taxpayers for specific improvements that benefit them. In the context of the capital projects fund, I believe these assessments are considered revenues. So the $300,000 should be added as revenue.

Wait, but I'm recalling something about how in some funds, like the general fund, revenues are based on the modified accrual basis, meaning they're recognized when they're both measurable and available to pay for current period expenditures. But the capital projects fund is a governmental fund, so the same rules apply. However, when it comes to special assessments, sometimes they can be treated as revenue when they're imposed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the special assessment is collected by the county on behalf of the capital projects fund, then the fund would record it as revenue when it's received.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states these are receipts during the year. So regardless of when they were levied, the money was received, so they should be recorded as revenues in this year.

So adding them up: 100k + 75k + 300k = 475k. Let me check the options. Option E is 475,000. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the transfer from the general fund. Do transfers count as revenue? Because sometimes in fund accounting, a transfer is just moving money from one fund to another, but in the receiving fund, it's considered a revenue. For example, the general fund might transfer money to the capital projects fund to finance a project, and the capital projects fund would record that as a transfer revenue.

Yes, I think that's correct. So all three items are considered revenues for the capital projects fund. So the total is 100k +75k +300k = 475k. So the correct answer is E, 475,000.

The capital projects fund receives revenues from various sources, which are recognized based on the modified accrual basis of accounting. The receipts provided are:

1. **Transfer from the general fund ($100,000):** This is considered a revenue in the capital projects fund as it represents a transfer from another fund to support capital projects.

2. **Federal capital grant ($75,000):** Grants are recognized as revenue when received, and since this amount is listed as a receipt, it is included in the revenues.

3. **Special assessment for capital improvements ($300,000):** Special assessments collected for capital improvements are treated as revenues when received.

Adding these amounts together:  
$100,000 + $75,000 + $300,000 = $475,000.

Thus, the total revenues reported in the capital projects fund at the end of the year are $475,000.
