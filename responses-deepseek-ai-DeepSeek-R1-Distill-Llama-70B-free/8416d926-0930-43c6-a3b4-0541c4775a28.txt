Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about using Poiseuille's Law to calculate the rate of flow in a small human artery. Hmm, I remember that Poiseuille's Law is related to fluid dynamics, specifically the flow of viscous fluids in tubes. Let me try to recall the formula.

Wait, Poiseuille's Law is Q equals (pi times pressure difference times radius to the fourth power) divided by (8 times eta times length), something like that. Oh right, the formula is Q = (π ΔP R^4) / (8 η L). Yeah, that sounds right.

So the problem gives me the values: eta is 0.027, R is 0.008 cm, I think I stands for the length, which is 2 cm, and P is the pressure difference, which is 4000 dynes per square centimeter.

Wait, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me see, the radius is in centimeters, length also in centimeters, eta is given in what units? Oh, wait, I think the units for eta here are poise. Because in the CGS system, eta is measured in poise, where 1 poise is 1 dyne·s/cm². So yeah, that makes sense.

So plugging in the numbers. Let me jot them down:

η = 0.027 Poise (which is dyne·s/cm²)
R = 0.008 cm
L = 2 cm
ΔP = 4000 dynes/cm²

So Q = (π * 4000 * (0.008)^4) / (8 * 0.027 * 2 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: π * 4000 * (0.008)^4.

Wait, (0.008)^4. Let me compute 0.008^4. 0.008 is 8e-3, so (8e-3)^4 is 8^4 * 1e-12. 8^4 is 4096. So 4096e-12, which is 4.096e-9. Wait, wait no: 8^4 is 4096, yes. So (0.008)^4 = (8e-3)^4 = (8^4)*(1e-3)^4) = 4096 * 1e-12 = 4.096e-9 cm^4.

So the numerator becomes π * 4000 * 4.096e-9.

Let me compute 4000 * 4.096e-9 first. 4000 is 4e3, so 4e3 * 4.096e-9 = (4 *4.096) * 1e-6. 4 *4.096 is about 16.384. So 16.384e-6. That's 1.6384e-5.

Multiply by π: approximately 3.1416 * 1.6384e-5. Let's see, 3.1416 * 1.6384 is around 5.15... So 5.15e-5. So numerator is about 5.15e-5.

Now the denominator: 8 * 0.027 * 2. So 8 * 0.027 is 0.216, multiplied by 2 is 0.432.

So Q = 5.15e-5 / 0.432.

Let me compute 5.15e-5 divided by 0.432. 5.15e-5 is 0.0000515. 0.432 is approximately 0.432.

So 0.0000515 / 0.432 = let's see. Let me write it as 5.15e-5 / 4.32e-1.

Which is (5.15 / 4.32) * 1e-4.

5.15 divided by 4.32 is approximately 1.192. So 1.192e-4.

So Q is approximately 1.192e-4 cm³/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.19e-4 cm³/s, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be D.

To calculate the rate of flow \( Q \) in a small human artery using Poiseuille's Law, we use the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4}{8 \eta L}
\]

### Given values:
- \(\eta = 0.027 \, \text{Poise (dyne·s/cm}^2\text{)}\)
- \(R = 0.008 \, \text{cm}\)
- \(L = 2 \, \text{cm}\)
- \(\Delta P = 4000 \, \text{dynes/cm}^2\)

### Step 1: Compute \( R^4 \)
\[
R^4 = (0.008)^4 = (8 \times 10^{-3})^4 = 8^4 \times 10^{-12} = 4096 \times 10^{-12} = 4.096 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{cm}^4
\]

### Step 2: Compute the numerator (\( \pi \Delta P R^4 \))
\[
\pi \Delta P R^4 = 3.1416 \times 4000 \times 4.096 \times 10^{-9}
\]
\[
4000 \times 4.096 \times 10^{-9} = 1.6384 \times 10^{-5}
\]
\[
\pi \times 1.6384 \times 10^{-5} \approx 5.15 \times 10^{-5}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the denominator (\( 8 \eta L \))
\[
8 \eta L = 8 \times 0.027 \times 2 = 0.432
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( Q \)
\[
Q = \frac{5.15 \times 10^{-5}}{0.432} \approx 1.192 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated flow rate is approximately \( 1.19 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s} \), which matches option **D**.
