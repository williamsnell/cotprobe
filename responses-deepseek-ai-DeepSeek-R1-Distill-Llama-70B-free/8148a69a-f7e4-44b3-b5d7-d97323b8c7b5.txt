Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the scenario is.

An elderly woman goes into a convenience store to cash her Social Security check. The owner says he can't cash it because of his policy. She then threatens him, saying she has a bomb in her pocketbook and will blow up the store if he doesn't give her money. But actually, she doesn't have a bomb. The owner isn't fooled but feels sorry for her and agrees to cash the check. She takes the money and leaves with her cane. Later, the owner realizes she didn't endorse the check. Now, the question is what crime, if any, has she committed.

The options are A through I, including things like blackmail, fraud, robbery, etc.

First, I need to break down the elements of each crime to see which applies here.

Starting with robbery: Robbery is the unlawful taking of property from another person through force or fear. The key elements are the taking, the use of force or fear, and the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. But in this case, the woman didn't actually take the money through force. She threatened, but the owner wasn't deceived and gave her the money out of sympathy, not fear. So maybe it's not robbery.

What about attempted robbery? Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards it. She did threaten, but since the owner wasn't actually intimidated, perhaps the attempt wasn't completed. Or maybe the attempt is still present because she tried to instill fear, even if it didn't work.

Blackmail is another option. Blackmail typically involves threatening to reveal something unless demands are met. But here, she's threatening to use a bomb, which is more of a direct threat of violence. So maybe not blackmail.

Fraud involves deception for personal gain. She lied about having a bomb, but the owner wasn't deceived. So the element of deceit causing the owner to act might not be present. Therefore, fraud might not apply here.

False pretenses would involve obtaining title to property through a false representation with intent to defraud. Again, since the owner wasn't deceived, this might not fit.

Conspiracy to commit robbery would require an agreement with another person, which isn't present here since she acted alone.

Assault is another thought. Assault can be through words that create apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. She threatened to blow up the store, which could be considered an assault. But wait, the threat was of a future action, not immediate. She said she'd blow it up if he didn't comply. So maybe it's not assault because there's no immediate apprehension of harm.

Threatening behavior could be a possibility. Some jurisdictions have laws against making threats, even if they're not carried out. But I'm not sure if this is a recognized crime in the context of the options given.

Wait, the woman didn't have a bomb, so she wasn't actually capable of carrying out the threat. But she still made the threat. So even if the owner wasn't deceived, the act of threatening could still be a crime in itself. But I'm trying to think if that falls under any of the options provided.

Looking back, the woman's actions: she made a threat to get money, but the owner wasn't afraid and complied out of pity. So for robbery, the owner's state of mind is important. If the owner wasn't in fear, then robbery wouldn't apply because the element of force or fear isn't met. So robbery is out.

Attempted robbery might still apply because she took a substantial step towards committing robbery by making the threat, intending to take the money through fear. Even if the fear wasn't actually induced, the attempt could still be charged. So maybe H: Attempted robbery.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, for an attempt, the defendant must have the specific intent to commit the crime and take a substantial step towards it. Here, she intended to get the money by threatening, so that fits. Even if the threat wasn't believable, the attempt is still there.

Alternatively, if the owner wasn't actually placed in fear, some might argue that attempted robbery isn't applicable because the force or fear element isn't met. But I think the attempt focuses on her actions, not the victim's reaction. So she attempted to create fear to get the money, so it's attempted robbery.

Another angle: she obtained the money through a threat, but the owner gave it willingly without fear. Does that mean she didn't commit robbery? Because robbery requires the taking against the will of the owner through force or fear. If the owner gave it voluntarily, even though she threatened, maybe it's not robbery. But she still tried to take it through force or fear, so it's attempted robbery.

Wait, but if the owner wasn't afraid, then she didn't actually put him in fear. So does that negate the robbery charge? Because robbery requires that the victim experiences fear. If she tried to cause fear but failed, does that make it attempted robbery?

Hmm. So, in this case, the woman tried to use force (through the threat) to take the money. But the owner wasn't actually in fear. So, the crime would be an attempt, since she intended to commit robbery but didn't complete it because the necessary element (fear) wasn't present.

So, looking at the options, H is Attempted robbery. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: since she got the money, even if the owner wasn't in fear, she still took the money. But robbery requires that the taking be through force or fear. If the owner wasn't in fear, then the taking wasn't through force or fear, so she didn't commit robbery. But she did attempt to use force to take it, which would be attempted robbery.

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer is H: Attempted robbery.
</think>

The woman attempted to take money by threatening the store owner with a bomb, intending to create fear. However, the owner was not deceived or intimidated and instead complied out of sympathy. Robbery requires the unlawful taking of property through force or fear, but since the owner was not actually in fear, the elements of robbery are not fully met. Nevertheless, the woman took a substantial step toward committing robbery by making the threat, demonstrating the specific intent required for an attempt. Therefore, her actions constitute attempted robbery.

Answer: H
