Question:

The Department of Health plans to test the lead level in a specific park. Because a high lead level is harmful to children, the park will be closed if the lead level exceeds the allowed limit. The department randomly selects several locations in the park, gets soil samples from those locations, and tests the samples for their lead levels. Which of the following decisions would result from the type I error?

Options:

A: Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit
B: Closing the park based on a predicted future lead level increase
C: Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
D: Closing other parks when their lead levels are within the allowed limit
E: Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
F: Not testing the lead levels at all and closing the park
G: Keeping other parks open when their lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
H: Disregarding the test results and keeping the park open regardless of the lead levels
I: Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit
J: Closing the park based on lead levels from a different park

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistics, specifically about Type I errors. Hmm, I remember that Type I errors are a concept in hypothesis testing. Let me think through this carefully.

The scenario is about a Department of Health testing lead levels in a park. If the lead is too high, they'll close the park because it's harmful to children. So, they take soil samples from random locations and check the lead levels.

The question is asking which decision would result from a Type I error. I need to recall what a Type I error is. Oh right, a Type I error is when you reject the null hypothesis even though it's actually true. It's a false positive. So, it's like when you think there's an effect or a problem when there really isn't one.

In this context, the null hypothesis would probably be that the lead levels are within the allowed limit. Because if the lead is within the limit, the park should stay open. The alternative hypothesis would be that the lead level exceeds the limit, meaning the park should be closed.

So, a Type I error happens when the test incorrectly concludes that the lead level is too high (rejects the null) when in reality it's within the allowed limit. That would lead to the park being closed unnecessarily.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Keeping the park open when levels are within the limit. That's correct, not an error.

Option B: Closing based on future lead levels. I don't think that's a Type I error; it's more about prediction, maybe a different kind of error.

Option C: Keeping the park open when levels are too high. That's a Type II error, failing to detect a real problem.

Option D: Closing other parks with safe levels. Hmm, not directly related to this park's test.

Option E: Closing the park when levels are too high. That's correct action, not an error.

Option F: Not testing and closing. That's a policy decision, not an error from the test.

Option G: Keeping other parks open when they have high levels. Again, not about this test's outcome.

Option H: Disregarding results and keeping open regardless. That's ignoring data, not a Type I error.

Option I: Closing the park when levels are within the limit. Oh wait, that's exactly the Type I error scenario. Because the null was that levels are safe, and if you reject the null (close the park) when the levels are safe, that's a false positive.

Option J: Closing based on other parks' data. That's a different issue, maybe a sampling error but not a Type I.

So the correct answer should be option I: Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit.

The correct answer is I. A Type I error occurs when a test incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis, leading to an unnecessary action. Here, closing the park when lead levels are within the allowed limit is a Type I error.
