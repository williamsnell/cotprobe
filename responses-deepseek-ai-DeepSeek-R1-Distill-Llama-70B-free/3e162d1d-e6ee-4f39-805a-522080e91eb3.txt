Question:

A defendant was booked on a commercial airline flight. When the defendant arrived at the airport, two undercover police narcotics agents observed him. His appearance and actions led the police to believe that he fit the description of a predetermined profile of a drug courier. The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.
B: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to search the bag.
C: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics.
D: denied, because the search was conducted with the help of a narcotics detection dog.
E: denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.
F: granted, because the police coerced the defendant into handing over his bag.
G: granted, because the police did not have the right to prevent the defendant from boarding the plane.
H: denied, because the defendant voluntarily handed over his bag to the police.
I: denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.
J: granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with searches and seizures. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break down the scenario step by step.

First, the defendant was booked on a flight and was observed by undercover narcotics agents. They thought he fit a drug courier profile. So, the officers approached him, told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. He asked why, and they explained about the profile. Then they asked for his overnight bag, but he refused. The officers then said he wouldn't be allowed to board the plane unless they inspected the bag. So, the defendant changed his mind about flying and decided not to board. But the officers still asked for the bag, and he handed it over. They let him leave. The next day, they did a dog sniff, which indicated narcotics, so they opened the bag and found heroin. The defendant is charged, and now his attorney is moving to suppress the evidence.

The question is whether the motion will be granted or denied. So, the issue is whether the police's actions were constitutionalâ€”specifically, did they have the right to search the bag, and was the evidence obtained legally.

Let me think about the legal principles involved. This seems to involve the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The key is whether the police had probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and whether the search was conducted with a warrant.

When the officers approached the defendant, they were likely conducting a Terry stop, which requires reasonable suspicion. But here, they wanted to inspect his bag. The defendant refused at first, but then after being told he couldn't board without the inspection, he handed it over. Wait, but he decided not to fly, so did that change things?

In the case of Florida v. Bostick, the Supreme Court held that police approaching a bus passenger and asking to search luggage does not necessarily constitute a seizure, as the passenger can refuse and walk away. But in this scenario, the officers told the defendant he wouldn't be permitted to board unless they inspected the bag. That sounds more coercive. If the defendant felt he had no choice but to comply, that might be a problem.

But then, he decided not to fly. So, perhaps he was free to leave. But when he handed over the bag, was that voluntary? Or was it under duress because the officers were preventing him from boarding? If the officers had no authority to prevent him from boarding, then threatening to prevent him could be seen as coercion, making the consent invalid.

Wait, but the officers were at the airport. Can they prevent someone from boarding a flight? I'm not sure. In some cases, airlines might cooperate with police, but legally, the police can't detain someone without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. So, if the officers had reasonable suspicion, they could detain him, but if not, then detaining him or preventing him from boarding would be unlawful.

But in this case, the officers approached him because he fit a drug courier profile. Drug courier profiles have been criticized, but courts have sometimes allowed them if they include specific factors beyond just race or appearance. The key is whether the profile gives reasonable suspicion.

Assuming the profile was sufficient, the officers had reasonable suspicion to approach and ask questions. But when they asked for the bag, the defendant refused. So, they told him he couldn't board unless he complied. That might be an unlawful detention because they didn't have probable cause to search without a warrant. So, by conditioning his ability to board the flight on handing over the bag, they might have compelled him to consent, which would make the consent invalid.

If the consent was invalid, then the search was unlawful, and the evidence should be suppressed. But wait, he did change his mind about flying. So, he was free to leave, but he gave the bag. Hmm, maybe that's a point. If he was free to leave, then handing over the bag might be seen as voluntary. But the coercion part is tricky.

Alternatively, the police had the bag, and the next day they did a dog sniff. A dog sniff is not considered a search under the Fourth Amendment (see United States v. Place), so they don't need a warrant for that. If the dog alerts, that gives probable cause to search the bag without a warrant. So, if the initial detention and seizure of the bag were lawful, then the dog sniff and subsequent search would be okay.

But the initial issue is whether the police had the right to take the bag. If they had reasonable suspicion, they could have detained the bag under the theory of "exigent circumstances," perhaps. Or maybe they had probable cause after the dog sniff. Wait, no, the dog sniff happened the next day. So, the initial taking of the bag would need justification.

Wait, the police didn't have a warrant when they took the bag, so if they seized it without probable cause, that's a problem. But maybe they had probable cause based on the profile and observations. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, if the defendant voluntarily handed over the bag, then the police can search it. But was the consent voluntary? If he felt coerced because they were preventing him from boarding, then it's not voluntary. So, the key is whether the police's actions constituted an unlawful detention, making the consent coerced.

In the case where police threaten to prevent someone from boarding a flight unless they consent, courts have sometimes found that to be coercive, especially if the person isn't free to leave. But if the person decides not to fly and hands over the bag, maybe it's seen as voluntary.

Wait, but the defendant decided not to fly, so he wasn't trying to board anymore. So, maybe the officers' threat was moot because he wasn't going to board. Therefore, when he handed over the bag, it was voluntary because he wasn't under any compulsion to board. Hmm, that's a possible angle.

Alternatively, the police's initial approach and detention might have been unlawful if they didn't have reasonable suspicion. If the profile was too vague, then the detention was unlawful, and any evidence obtained should be suppressed.

Putting this all together, I think the motion to suppress would be granted if the police didn't have probable cause or a warrant to search the bag. But the dog sniff doesn't require a warrant. However, the initial seizure of the bag might require probable cause. If the police had reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant, maybe they could have detained the bag as well under the theory that it might contain evidence. But without probable cause, they can't search it without a warrant.

Wait, but the dog sniff isn't a search, so they can do that without a warrant. If the dog sniffs and alerts, that gives probable cause, allowing them to search the bag without a warrant. So, the process would be: take the bag, do a dog sniff, get probable cause, then search.

But the problem is whether they could legally take the bag in the first place. If the defendant handed it over voluntarily, then it's okay. If he was coerced, then it's not.

Another angle: when the defendant decided not to fly, he was free to leave. So, the officers could have let him go, but instead, they asked for the bag. If he gave it to them voluntarily, then the police can use it. So, maybe the consent was voluntary because he wasn't under arrest or detention anymore.

Wait, but the officers had to have lawful possession of the bag. If he handed it over without any coercion, then they can use it. So, if the court finds that the defendant voluntarily relinquished the bag, then the subsequent search is okay.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Granted because no probable cause to hold the bag overnight. Maybe, because without probable cause, they can't hold it unless there's exigent circumstances, which I don't see here.

Option B: Granted because no warrant. But if the dog sniff is enough to get probable cause, then they can search without a warrant. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Denied because reasonable suspicion. But reasonable suspicion allows for detention, not search. They need probable cause for that.

Option D: Denied because dog sniff. But the issue is the seizure of the bag, not the sniff itself.

Option E: Denied because profile. The profile might give reasonable suspicion, but not probable cause.

Option F: Granted because coercion. If the consent was coerced, this would be correct. But if he voluntarily handed it over after deciding not to fly, maybe not.

Option G: Granted because police couldn't prevent boarding. If they didn't have authority to prevent him, then their threat was unlawful, making the consent coerced. So this could be a reason to grant the motion.

Option H: Denied because voluntary. If the court finds the consent was voluntary, this applies.

Option I: Denied because lawful detention. If the initial detention was lawful, but without probable cause, they can't search.

Option J: Granted because unlawful detention. If the initial detention was unlawful, then evidence is suppressed.

So, the main issues are: was the initial stop lawful (reasonable suspicion), was the defendant's consent voluntary, and was the seizure of the bag lawful.

In Florida v. Bostick, the court said that as long as the police don't coerce, asking to search is okay. Here, the police told him he couldn't board unless he let them inspect. That might be seen as coercive. But then he decided not to fly. So, when he handed over the bag, was he under duress? Or was he free to leave, making the consent voluntary?

If the court finds that the officers' actions were coercive, then the consent was not voluntary, and the seizure of the bag was unlawful. That would make option F or G correct.

Alternatively, if the court finds that the consent was voluntary because he wasn't trying to board anymore, then the search is okay, making option H correct.

But I think the key point is that the officers had no authority to prevent him from boarding the plane. So, when they told him he couldn't board unless he handed over the bag, that was an unlawful detention, which coerced him into giving the bag. Therefore, the consent was not voluntary, and the evidence should be suppressed.

So, the motion would be granted. Looking at the options, option F says granted because the police coerced him. Option G says granted because police couldn't prevent boarding.

Alternatively, option A says granted because no probable cause to hold the bag. But if the police had reasonable suspicion, they might have been able to hold it temporarily.

Wait, without probable cause, they can't seize the bag. So, even if they had reasonable suspicion, they can't take the bag without probable cause unless under exigent circumstances. Here, there's no exigency mentioned, so they needed probable cause to seize the bag. Since they didn't have that yet, holding the bag overnight was unlawful. So option A would apply.

But I'm a bit confused. The police didn't have probable cause at the time they took the bag, but after the dog sniff, they did. But the initial seizure without probable cause would make the evidence inadmissible.

So, the answer might be A: granted because no probable cause to hold the bag overnight.

Wait, but the police didn't have probable cause when they seized the bag. They only got probable cause after the dog sniff the next day. So, the seizure was unlawful because it was without probable cause, making the evidence inadmissible. So option A would be correct.

Alternatively, if the defendant voluntarily handed over the bag, then the police can hold it and do the sniff. So, if the court finds the consent was voluntary, then the search is okay, making option H correct.

I think the coercion is the key factor. If the police's actions were coercive, then the consent is invalid. But if he decided not to fly and handed it over, it's voluntary.

In the case where the police threaten to prevent boarding unless you consent, that's seen as coercion, especially if you're not free to leave. But once he decided not to fly, maybe the coercion is gone.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between options A and F.

Wait, another angle: the police didn't have a search warrant. So, even if they had probable cause after the dog sniff, if they seized the bag without probable cause initially, the evidence might still be tainted.

But if the defendant abandoned the bag, but in this case, he handed it over, so it's not abandonment. So, the initial seizure was without probable cause, making it unlawful, thus the evidence should be suppressed. So, option A would be correct.

Alternatively, if the police had reasonable suspicion to detain the bag, maybe under the theory that it might contain evidence, but I think reasonable suspicion allows detention of the person, not the property without probable cause.

So, I'm leaning towards option A: granted because no probable cause to hold the bag.

Wait, but another point: when the defendant gave the bag to the police, did he consent? If he consented freely, then the police can search it. But if he only did so because the police were preventing him from boarding, which they had no authority to do, then the consent was coerced.

So, if the police had no authority to prevent him from boarding, their threat was an unlawful assertion of power, making the consent invalid. So, option F would apply.

Alternatively, if the police had the right to prevent him from boarding based on reasonable suspicion, then their actions were lawful.

But generally, the police can't prevent someone from boarding a flight without probable cause. So, their threat to prevent boarding unless he handed over the bag would be coercive, making the consent invalid.

So, in that case, the evidence would be suppressed, making option F correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck between options A and F.

Another approach: what's the legal standard for airport stops? In United States v. Mendenhall, the Supreme Court held that a person is seized only if a reasonable person would not feel free to leave. If the officers' conduct created an apprehension that they would use force to detain the defendant, then it's a seizure.

In this case, the officers told the defendant he couldn't board unless he let them inspect. If he felt he had no choice but to comply, then it's a seizure. But when he decided not to fly, perhaps he was free to leave, making the subsequent handing over of the bag voluntary.

But I think the key is that the initial detention was unlawful because the police didn't have reasonable suspicion. Or if they did, but then when he decided not to fly, he wasn't under detention anymore, so handing over the bag was voluntary.

Wait, but the profile might not be enough for reasonable suspicion. If the profile was too vague, then the initial stop was unlawful, and any consent would be tainted. But if the profile was specific enough, then the stop was lawful.

Assuming the profile was sufficient, the initial stop was lawful. Then, when he decided not to fly, he wasn't under detention, so handing over the bag was voluntary.

In that case, the police could search it after the dog sniff. So, the motion to suppress would be denied because the consent was voluntary. That would make option H correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the best answer is option A: granted because no probable cause to hold the bag. Because the police didn't have probable cause when they seized the bag, so holding it overnight was unlawful, and the evidence should be suppressed, regardless of the dog sniff.

The question revolves around whether the police's actions in seizing the defendant's bag and subsequently searching it were constitutional under the Fourth Amendment. The key issues are: (1) whether the initial detention and seizure of the bag were lawful, (2) whether the defendant's consent to hand over the bag was voluntary, and (3) whether the police had probable cause or reasonable suspicion to justify their actions.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Detention and Reasonable Suspicion**:  
   The police approached the defendant because he fit a drug courier profile. Courts have sometimes allowed such profiles if they include specific factors, but they must provide reasonable suspicion to justify a Terry stop. If the profile was too vague, the initial detention could be deemed unlawful. However, if the profile was sufficiently specific, the detention may have been lawful.

2. **Consent and Coercion**:  
   The officers told the defendant he couldn't board the plane unless he handed over his bag. This could be seen as coercive, as the police likely had no authority to prevent him from boarding without probable cause. If the defendant felt compelled to comply due to this threat, his consent would not be voluntary. However, after the defendant decided not to fly, he may no longer have been under duress, potentially making the consent voluntary.

3. **Seizure of the Bag**:  
   The police seized the bag without a warrant. For the seizure to be lawful, they would need probable cause or exigent circumstances. Since no exigent circumstances are mentioned, the seizure would require probable cause. If the police only had reasonable suspicion, the seizure would be unlawful. The subsequent dog sniff, which is not considered a search, could provide probable cause for opening the bag, but the initial seizure must still be justified.

4. **Outcome of the Motion to Suppress**:  
   If the court finds that the police coerced the defendant into handing over the bag or that they lacked probable cause to seize it, the evidence would be suppressed. Conversely, if the court determines that the defendant voluntarily relinquished the bag after deciding not to fly, the search may be deemed lawful.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A**: Granted because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight.  
  This is a strong option because the police likely lacked probable cause at the time of seizure, making the holding of the bag unlawful.

- **Option B**: Granted because the police did not have a warrant to search the bag.  
  This is incorrect because a warrant is not required if the police obtain probable cause after a lawful dog sniff.

- **Option C**: Denied because the police had reasonable suspicion.  
  Reasonable suspicion allows for detention but not for seizing and searching the bag without probable cause.

- **Option D**: Denied because the search was conducted with the help of a narcotics detection dog.  
  The dog sniff itself is lawful, but the issue is the initial seizure of the bag.

- **Option E**: Denied because the defendant fit the profile of a drug courier.  
  A profile alone does not provide probable cause for seizure.

- **Option F**: Granted because the police coerced the defendant into handing over his bag.  
  This is plausible if the court finds the defendant's consent was coerced by the threat of preventing him from boarding.

- **Option G**: Granted because the police did not have the right to prevent the defendant from boarding the plane.  
  This is also plausible because the police likely had no authority to prevent boarding without probable cause.

- **Option H**: Denied because the defendant voluntarily handed over his bag.  
  This would apply if the court finds the consent was voluntary after the defendant decided not to fly.

- **Option I**: Denied because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.  
  This would apply only if the initial detention and seizure were lawful, which is questionable.

- **Option J**: Granted because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.  
  This would apply if the initial detention was unlawful due to insufficient reasonable suspicion.

### Conclusion:

The most likely outcome is that the motion to suppress
