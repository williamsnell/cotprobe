Question:

According to Krause and Williams, what agenda would most likely attract scholars to the 'broad church' of security studies?

Options:

A: To question the referent object, to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and to change the way in which security is studied.
B: To address security from a positivist perspective, challenging the dominance of traditional security paradigms, and shifting academic attention to the individual as a referent point.
C: To question the dominance of liberalism and realism in the international system, to apply critical knowledge to the security dilemma faced by states and to redress the power imbalances that lead to intra-state conflict.
D: To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about security studies according to Krause and Williams. The question is asking which agenda would most likely attract scholars to the 'broad church' of security studies. Hmm, I remember that the broad church refers to a more inclusive approach that expands beyond traditional security concepts.

First, let me think about what Krause and Williams argue. I recall that they're part of the broader debate in security studies, particularly critical security studies. The traditional approach focuses on the state as the primary referent object and military security as the main concern. But the broad church is about expanding this.

Option A says to question the referent object, challenge military security's primacy, and change how security is studied. That sounds like it's pushing for a broader perspective, moving beyond the state and military. So this could be a good fit.

Option B talks about a positivist perspective and shifting focus to the individual. Wait, positivism is more about scientific methods and objectivity, which might not directly relate to broadening the referent objects. Also, individual as referent point is part of human security, which is broader, but the positivist angle might not align with the critical approaches I associate with the broad church.

Option C is about challenging liberalism and realism, applying critical knowledge to the security dilemma, and addressing power imbalances causing intra-state conflict. This seems more about theoretical approaches and specific policy issues rather than expanding the definition of security itself.

Option D suggests accounting for all possible referent objects and expanding security's definition broadly. That sounds similar to the idea of broadening, but maybe it's too broad? Or perhaps it's exactly what the broad church is about.

Wait, the term 'broad church' implies inclusivity but perhaps a structured expansion. So Krause and Williams might be arguing for a broader approach that includes various referent objects beyond the state. So option A talks about questioning the referent object and changing how security is studied, which aligns with expanding the field. Option D is about expanding the definition to include any agent threatening referent objects, which is also broad.

I think I need to recall more precisely. The broad church, as per some readings, is about expanding security beyond traditional state-centric and military-focused views. So it's not just about including more referent objects, but also changing the way we study securityâ€”like moving beyond state security to include societal, economic, environmental, etc.

Option A says to question the referent object, challenge military security as paramount, and change study methods. That covers expanding what security includes and how it's approached, which sounds right.

Option D is about expanding the definition to include any agent threatening referent objects. That might be too vague and not necessarily tied to the methodological change that the broad church might advocate for.

So I'm leaning towards Option A.

The 'broad church' of security studies, as discussed by Krause and Williams, emphasizes expanding the field beyond traditional state-centric and military-focused perspectives. It advocates for questioning the referent object of security, challenging the primacy of military security, and rethinking how security is studied. This approach aligns with Option A, which encapsulates these elements by promoting a broader perspective that includes various referent objects and methodologies. Option D, while related, focuses more on expanding the definition without necessarily addressing the methodological changes central to the broad church. Therefore, Option A best captures the agenda that would attract scholars to this inclusive approach.

Answer: A
