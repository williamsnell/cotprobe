Question:

Solve for the sum of all possible values of $x$ when $3^{x^2+4x+4}=9^{x+2}$.

Options:

A: 3
B: -5
C: -2
D: -4
E: 2
F: 1
G: -3
H: 0
I: 4
J: 5

Answer:
    <think>


To solve the equation \( 3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2} \), we start by expressing both sides with the same base. Notice that \( 9 = 3^2 \), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = (3^2)^{x + 2}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 3^{2(x + 2)}
\]

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:

\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2(x + 2)
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:

\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2x + 4
\]

Subtracting \( 2x + 4 \) from both sides to bring all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 + 2x = 0
\]

Factoring the quadratic equation:

\[
x(x + 2) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
\]

The sum of all possible values of \( x \) is:

\[
0 + (-2) = -2
\]

Thus, the answer is:

**C: -2**
