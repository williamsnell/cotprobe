Question:

A town had been experiencing a rash of bank robberies. All the witnesses at each bank had described a man with a gun who said, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!" Following a series of leads, the detectives in the case finally made an arrest. At the police station, the suspect was placed in a lineup. One of the victims observed the lineup, and after each of the six participants stated, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today," the victim identified the suspect as the perpetrator. The defendant's attorney subsequently moved to suppress the out-of-court identification, arguing that because the defendant was forced to speak, this violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, which had been invoked previously by the defendant. The police requirement that the defendant state at the lineup, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today"

Options:

A: was a permissible police procedure as the statement was not incriminating.
B: violated the defendant's right to a fair trial.
C: was an infringement on the defendant's right to counsel.
D: was not a violation because the defendant had already invoked his right to remain silent.
E: would not prohibit the defendant's lineup identification from being introduced at trial.
F: would make the defendant's lineup identification admissible only if corroborated by other evidence.
G: invalidated the lineup.
H: tainted the victim's identification of the defendant.
I: was an acceptable method of identification because the defendant was not under oath.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is about a town with a series of bank robberies. In each robbery, the suspect used a specific phrase: "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!" The police arrested a suspect and put him in a lineup. During the lineup, each participant, including the suspect, was made to say that exact phrase. A victim then identified the suspect based on this.

The defendant's attorney is moving to suppress the out-of-court identification, arguing that forcing the suspect to speak violated his Fifth Amendment right, which he had previously invoked. The question is about whether the police's action was permissible or not.

First, I need to remember what the Fifth Amendment protects. The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination means that a person can't be compelled to be a witness against themselves. This includes being forced to make statements that could incriminate them in a crime.

In this case, the suspect was forced to utter the specific threat used during the robberies. The issue is whether this constitutes compelled self-incrimination. If the statement is incriminating, then it's a problem. But if it's not, then it's permissible.

I recall a Supreme Court case, Schmerber v. California, where the court held that the Fifth Amendment doesn't protect against the compelled production of physical evidence, like blood tests or handwriting samples, unless the evidence is testimonial in nature. But this case isn't about physical evidence; it's about speech.

Another relevant case is United States v. Wade, which deals with lineups and the right to counsel. But here, the issue is about forced speech, not the presence of counsel.

Wait, there's also the case of Doyle v. Ohio, but that's about using post-Miranda silence against the defendant, which isn't directly relevant here.

Another case comes to mind: the Supreme Court case where the defendant was forced to give a voice exemplar. In that case, the court held that providing a voice sample wasn't compelled self-incrimination because it's physical evidence, not testimonial. So, the Fifth Amendment doesn't bar the government from requiring a person to give a voice exemplar.

Applying that here, the police made the suspect repeat the specific phrase. The defendant was forced to speak, but the statement itself is being used as a means of identification, not as evidence of guilt from his own mouth. So, is this considered testimonial?

Wait, but isn't the content of the statement incriminating? Because in the robberies, that exact phrase was used. So, if the suspect says it, it's evidence that he's the robber. So compelling him to say it would be forcing him to provide evidence against himself.

Alternatively, the argument could be that the statement is not incriminating in itself. It's just a phrase that could be used by anyone. So, making the suspect say it doesn't necessarily incriminate him unless the prosecution links it to the crime through other evidence.

But wait, the Fifth Amendment protects against compelled self-incrimination. So if the act of speaking those words tends to incriminate the defendant, then it's a violation.

In the case where the suspect is forced to repeat the words used in the crime, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, it's about identificationâ€”so the police are trying to see if the voice matches what the victim remembers. On the other hand, the content of the statement is the same as what the robber used, so it could be self-incriminating.

I think the key here is whether the statement is considered testimonial. Testimonial evidence is communication that is subject to the Fifth Amendment protection. If the police are compelling the suspect to make a statement that could be used as evidence against him, that's a problem.

But wait, in the lineup, the purpose is identification, not to get the suspect to confess. So maybe it's permissible because it's part of the identification process, not an interrogation.

Alternatively, the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply here because the suspect isn't being forced to confess; he's just repeating a phrase for identification purposes. So the statement's content isn't being used to incriminate him; it's the act of speaking that's being used to identify his voice or manner.

Hmm, but the problem says that the victim identified the suspect after hearing each person say the phrase. So the identification is based on the voice and the words spoken. But the words themselves are incriminating because they're the same as the robber's.

So the question is whether forcing the suspect to say those words violates the Fifth Amendment.

Another approach is to consider whether the statement is "compelled" for the purpose of incrimination. If the primary purpose is identification, perhaps it's allowed. But if the statement's content is incriminating, then it's a problem.

I think the courts have held that certain physical acts, even if they involve speech, don't violate the Fifth Amendment if they're not testimonial. For example, providing a handwriting sample or a voice exemplar is permissible because it's considered a physical act, not testimonial.

In this case, making the suspect repeat a specific phrase might fall into the same category. The suspect isn't testifying against himself; he's just providing a voice sample. The content of the sample is what's used for identification, but the act of speaking isn't testimonial.

Wait, but the content is incriminating. So perhaps it's a bit different. If the police had the suspect say, "I robbed the bank," that would clearly be compelled self-incrimination. But in this case, the phrase is a command the robber made. So the suspect is repeating the robber's words, not confessing.

So maybe the key is whether the statement is self-incriminating. If the suspect is forced to say something that directly incriminates him, like a confession, that's a problem. But if it's a neutral phrase, even if used in a robbery, then it's permissible.

Wait, but the phrase itself, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today," isn't a confession. It's a command. So the suspect isn't admitting to the robbery by saying it. He's just mimicking the robber's speech. So perhaps it's not self-incriminating because it's not an admission of guilt.

Alternatively, if the suspect is forced to say words that could link him to the crime, it might be considered incriminating. But the Fifth Amendment doesn't protect against identification procedures, unless those procedures are compelled and testimonial in nature.

I think the correct approach here is that the Fifth Amendment doesn't bar the police from compelling a suspect to utter certain words for identification purposes, as it's not considered testimonial. Therefore, the lineup procedure was permissible.

Looking back at the options, option A says it was permissible because the statement wasn't incriminating. Option E says it wouldn't prohibit the identification from being introduced. Option G says it invalidated the lineup.

If the statement isn't incriminating, then option A would be correct. But if the statement is incriminating, then the procedure would be a violation. So, is the statement incriminating?

The statement itself is a threat used in the commission of the crime. If the suspect is forced to repeat it, could that be used as evidence that he was the robber? Because the robber used those exact words.

But in the context of a lineup, the purpose is voice identification. The victim is identifying the voice, not the content. So the content is just a means to that end. Therefore, the statement's content isn't being offered to prove guilt but to allow the victim to identify the voice.

Wait, but the content is the same as the crime, so it could be that the statement is being used in a way that incriminates the suspect. So the act of making him say it could be seen as compelling him to produce evidence against himself.

Alternatively, the Supreme Court has held that certain acts, even if they involve speech, don't implicate the Fifth Amendment if they're not testimonial. For example, in United States v. Dionisio, the court held that compelling a suspect to provide a voice exemplar didn't violate the Fifth Amendment because it's a physical act, not testimonial communication.

So, applying Dionisio here, making the suspect repeat the phrase would be permissible because it's a physical act (voice exemplar) and not testimonial.

Therefore, the police procedure was permissible because the statement wasn't incriminating in the sense that it's a testimonial communication. It's more of a physical evidence procedure.

So the correct answer would be option A: was a permissible police procedure as the statement was not incriminating.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is considered incriminating because it's the same as the robber's words, making option A incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, in Dionisio, the court said that a voice exemplar isn't protected by the Fifth Amendment because it's not testimonial. So even if the content is incriminating, the act of speaking isn't protected. So the content's incriminating nature doesn't matter because the Fifth Amendment isn't barring the physical act of speaking.

So in this case, the suspect was compelled to speak, but that's permissible under Dionisio. Therefore, the lineup wasn't invalidated, and the identification can be used.

So the correct answer would be option A or E. Option A says the statement wasn't incriminating, which might not be accurate because the content is incriminating, but the procedure is permissible regardless.

Wait, no. Option A's reasoning is that the statement wasn't incriminating. But if the statement is incriminating, then option A would be wrong, but the procedure might still be permissible because it's a physical act.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options are about the police procedure. So if the procedure was permissible because it's a voice exemplar, then option E says it wouldn't prohibit the identification. But the question is about whether the procedure violated the Fifth Amendment.

The issue is whether compelling the suspect to speak violated his Fifth Amendment rights. Under Dionisio, it didn't because it's a physical act, not testimonial. So the police's action was permissible, making option A the correct choice.

But wait, option A says the statement wasn't incriminating. The statement was the same as the robber's, so it was incriminating. So perhaps the police's action was permissible not because the statement wasn't incriminating, but because it's a physical act.

Wait, no. The Fifth Amendment doesn't protect against providing physical evidence, regardless of whether it's incriminating. So even if the statement is incriminating, the act of providing it as a voice exemplar is permissible.

In that case, the police's requirement didn't violate the Fifth Amendment, so the attorney's motion to suppress would fail, and the identification would be admissible. So looking at the options, the correct one would be that the procedure was permissible, which is option A or E.

Option E says the identification wouldn't be prohibited from being introduced. So if the procedure was permissible, then the identification is admissible. So perhaps option E is correct.

But wait, the question is about the police's action, not whether the evidence is admissible. The question is whether the procedure violated the Fifth Amendment. So if the procedure was permissible, then the answer is A. If the procedure was a violation, but the identification is still admissible, that would be a different issue.

Wait, I think the correct analysis is that compelling the suspect to speak didn't violate the Fifth Amendment because it's a physical act, not testimonial. So the police procedure was permissible, making option A correct.

But I'm a bit confused because option A's reasoning is that the statement wasn't incriminating. But in reality, the statement was incriminating. However, the Fifth Amendment doesn't bar compelled physical acts, even if they're incriminating. So the reasoning in option A might not be accurate, but the conclusion that the procedure was permissible is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the procedure didn't violate the Fifth Amendment because it's a voice exemplar, which is permissible. So the lineup wasn't invalidated, making option E correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: permissible because statement not incriminating.

E: wouldn't prohibit lineup ID from being introduced.

If the procedure was permissible, then the identification is admissible, so E would be correct. But the question is about whether the police's action violated the Fifth Amendment.

The question asks whether the police requirement violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment right. So if the answer is no, then the correct option is A or another.

I think the correct answer is A: was a permissible police procedure as the statement was not incriminating.

But wait, that might not be accurate because the statement was incriminating. So perhaps the correct reasoning is under Dionisio, the procedure is permissible regardless of the statement's content.

So perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the police's action did violate the Fifth Amendment because the statement was incriminating. So the identification would be suppressed.

Wait, but in Dionisio, the court held that voice exemplars are permissible. So the statement's content doesn't matter because it's a physical act.

So, the police's action was permissible, meaning the attorney's motion to suppress would fail. Therefore, the lineup identification would still be admissible. So the correct answer would be option E: would not prohibit the defendant's lineup identification from being introduced at trial.

Wait, but the question is about whether the police's action was a violation, not about the admissibility of the evidence. The question is asking which option correctly describes the police's action.

The options are about whether the police's requirement was permissible or a violation.

So, if the police's action was permissible, then the correct answer is A or E. But A is about the statement not being incriminating, which might not be the case. Alternatively, the procedure was permissible under Dionisio, making the police's action acceptable.

Wait, but the options don't mention Dionisio or voice exemplars. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, as the identification would still be admissible.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recap.

The Fifth Amendment issue is whether compelling the suspect to speak violates his right against self-incrimination. If the speech is testimonial, it's protected. If it's a physical act (like a voice exemplar), it's not protected.

In this case, the suspect was made to repeat a phrase for voice identification. That's a physical act, so it's permissible. Therefore, the police's action didn't violate the Fifth Amendment, and the lineup identification is admissible.

So the correct answer would be option A, but I'm not entirely sure because the statement is incriminating. However, the key is that it's a physical act, so the statement's content doesn't matter.

Wait, but the content does matter. If the suspect is forced to say something that directly incriminates him, like a confession, that's a problem. But if it's a statement that's used for identification, not as a confession, then it's permissible.

So in this case, the statement is used for voice identification, not as a confession. Therefore, it's permissible, making option A correct.

But I'm still a bit confused because the statement's content is the same as the robber's. So the act of saying it could be seen as incriminating.

Alternatively, the Fifth Amendment protects against being compelled to be a witness against oneself, which includes testimonial communications. Since the suspect's statement is being used as evidence of his guilt, it's testimonial and thus protected.

Wait, that would mean that the police's action was a violation, making option G (invalidated the lineup) correct.

But in Dionisio, the court said that voice exemplars are not protected. So perhaps the correct answer is that the procedure was permissible, making option A correct.

I think I'm going to go with option A: was a permissible police procedure as the statement was not incriminating.

Wait, no, because the statement was incriminating. So perhaps the correct answer is that it was permissible under Dionisio, making the statement admissible, so option E.

Ugh, this is tricky. I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the Fifth Amendment was invoked by the defendant. So perhaps the issue is whether the police can compel him to speak after he invoked. But the right to remain silent can be invoked, but in the context of a lineup, the police can still require physical acts, even if the suspect has invoked.

So, even if the suspect invoked his Fifth Amendment right, the police can still compel him to participate in a lineup and provide a voice exemplar because it's a physical act, not testimonial.

Therefore, the police's action was permissible, so option A is correct.

I think I'll settle on option A.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the police's requirement for the defendant to repeat the phrase "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!" during a lineup violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The key issue is whether compelling the defendant to speak constituted impermissible compelled self-incrimination or whether it was a permissible police procedure.

The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled testimonial communications that incriminate the speaker. However, certain physical acts, even if they involve speech, are not considered testimonial and are therefore not protected by the Fifth Amendment. For example, the Supreme Court has held that providing a voice exemplar is a physical act and not testimonial, making it permissible even if the content of the speech could be incriminating.

In this case, the police required the defendant to repeat a specific phrase used during the robberies. The purpose of this was voice identification, which is a physical act rather than a testimonial communication. While the phrase itself is incriminating, the act of speaking it for identification purposes does not violate the Fifth Amendment. This aligns with precedent such as *United States v. Dionisio*, where the court ruled that compelling a voice exemplar does not infringe on Fifth Amendment rights.

Given this reasoning, the police procedure was permissible because the statement was not considered testimonial, even though its content was incriminating. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: was a permissible police procedure as the statement was not incriminating.**
