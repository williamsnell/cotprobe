Okay, so I have this problem about a repulsion-start, induction-run motor, and I need to find the starting current and starting torque. Hmm, I remember that repulsion motors have some specific characteristics. Let me think about what I know.

The motor is rated 2 hp, 220 volts, 4 poles, 60 cycles. The full-load torque is 96.5 oz-ft, and the maximum torque as an induction motor is 228 oz-ft. I guess the starting torque is different from the full-load, probably higher or lower depending on the type.

Looking at the parameters given: r1 is 0.765 ohms, X0 is 57 ohms, X1 is 1.88 ohms. K_r is 0.935, X2 is also 1.88 ohms, and r2 is 1.58 ohms. Then there's a lot more parameters like a, C, k_wl, r_c, a3, r_b, and a brush-shift angle of 16 degrees. I'm not sure I remember all these terms, but I think some are for the starting torque calculation.

Wait, the starting torque for a repulsion motor... I think the formula involves some reactances and resistances. Oh right, the starting torque when it's operating as a repulsion motor. The formula is something like (V^2 * a * (r2 / (r1 + r2)) ) divided by ( (r1 + r2)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ). But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's torque = ( (3 * V^2) / (2π n_sync ) ) * ( r2 a^2 ) / ( (r1 + a^2 r2 )^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) ) or something like that. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to find the starting torque. As a repulsion motor, the starting torque formula is important. I remember that the starting torque T_s is given by:

T_s = ( (a^2) * V^2 * r2 ) / ( (r1 + a^2 r2 )^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) ) * (some constant)

Wait, also considering the number of poles and synchronous speed. The synchronous speed n_sync is (120 * f) / poles, which here is (120*60)/4 = 1800 rpm.

But torque is in oz-ft, so I need to convert units correctly. I think the formula involves converting the torque from motor terms to oz-ft.

Wait, another approach: The starting torque for a repulsion motor can be calculated using the formula:

T_start = (3 * a^2 * V^2 * r2) / ( (r1 + a^2 r2)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) * (1 / (2π n_sync)) ) * (60 * 2π / (12 * 5252)) ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the units. Alternatively, maybe I should use the general torque equation for a motor, considering the starting conditions.

Let me think about the equivalent circuit. For a repulsion motor starting, the stator has an applied voltage V, and the rotor is shorted through the brushes. The starting torque is similar to an induction motor but adjusted for the brush shift and the transformation ratio.

Wait, the transformation ratio a is given as 4.68. So a = stator to rotor turns ratio. So when calculating reactances and resistances on the rotor side, they need to be referred to the stator.

So for X1 and X2, which are the stator and rotor reactances, but wait, X1 is the stator leakage reactance, and X2 is the rotor leakage reactance, but since the rotor is shorted, X2 would be on the rotor side.

Wait, but in the starting condition, the rotor is effectively short-circuited. So the impedance seen from the stator would be the parallel combination of the stator's impedance and the rotor's impedance, but considering the transformation ratio.

Wait no, perhaps it's better to model the rotor as a short-circuited secondary, so the equivalent impedance is ( (r1 + j X1) || ( (r2 + j X2)/a^2 ) ). Because the rotor quantities are referred to the stator by dividing by a^2.

So the total impedance Z is (r1 + j X1) in parallel with (r2 + j X2)/a^2.

So the starting current I_start is V divided by Z, where Z is the parallel combination.

Calculating that first would give me the starting current. Then the torque can be found using the formula for torque in terms of the current and the angle between the stator and rotor currents.

Alternatively, I remember that the starting torque for a repulsion motor can be calculated as:

T_start = ( (a^2) * V^2 * r2 ) / ( (r1 * a^2 + r2 )^2 + (X1 + X2 )^2 ) ) * (1 / (2π n_sync )) * (some factor for oz-ft)

But I'm a bit unsure. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, compute the denominator: (r1 a² + r2 )² + (X1 + X2 )².

r1 is 0.765, a is 4.68, so r1 a² = 0.765 * (4.68)^2.

4.68 squared is about 21.9, so 0.765 * 21.9 ≈ 16.73. Then plus r2, which is 1.58. So 16.73 +1.58 = 18.31.

So (18.31)^2 ≈ 335.3.

X1 + X2 is 1.88 +1.88 = 3.76 ohms. So (3.76)^2 ≈ 14.14.

Adding these gives 335.3 +14.14 ≈ 349.44.

Now the numerator is a² * V^2 * r2.

a² is (4.68)^2 ≈21.9. V is 220 volts, so V² is 220^2=48400. r2 is 1.58.

So numerator = 21.9 *48400 *1.58.

Let me compute that. 21.9 *48400 = approx 1,059, 060 (since 20*48400=968,000, 1.9*48400≈91,960 → total 1,059,  060?).

Wait more accurately: 21.9 *48400 = (20 +1.9)*48400 = 20*48400=968000, 1.9 *48400=91960 → total 968000 +91,960=1,059,960.

Multiply by 1.58: 1,059,960 *1.58 ≈ 1,059,960 *1.5 = 1,589,440 and 1,059,960 *0.08 ≈ 84,796.8 → total approximately 1,674,236.8.

So numerator is about 1,674,237, denominator 349.44.

So T_start = (1,674,237) / 349.44 → approx 4,790.5.

But wait, that's the torque in some unit. What's the unit here? I think it's in N-m or lb-ft. Wait, no, because I think the formula gives torque in some base unit.

Wait, no, let me think again. The torque formula in induction motors often uses the formula T = (3 V^2 r2 ) / ( (R_total)^2 + (X_total)^2 ) * (1/(2π n_sync)).

But in this case, the equation I'm using is for a repulsion motor, so perhaps the formula is similar but adjusted for the transformation ratio.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes: Starting torque for repulsion motor is ( a^2 V^2 r2 ) / ( (r1 a^2 + r2 )^2 + (X1 + X2 )^2 ) ) * (1/(2π n_sync )) * (60 * 2π / (12 * 5252)) ) to convert to oz-ft.

Wait, because 1 N-m is approximately 0.7376 oz-ft. But maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, the formula with all the constants might be T = ( (a^2 * V^2 * r2 ) / ( (r1 a^2 + r2 )^2 + (X1 + X2 )^2 ) ) * ( 1 / (2π n_sync )) ) * ( 60 * 2π / (12 * 5252) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to compute the torque in N-m first, then convert to oz-ft.

Wait, another approach: The torque in a motor is given by T = (3 * I1 * I2 * sin(theta) ) / (2π n_sync ) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the torque can be found using the formula T = ( (a^2) * V^2 * r2 ) / ( (r1 a^2 + r2 )^2 + (X1 + X2 )^2 ) ) * (1 / (2π n_sync )) * K, where K is a constant to convert to oz-ft.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should look for the exact formula.

Wait, I think the general formula for starting torque in a repulsion motor is:

T_start = ( (a^2) * V^2 * r2 ) / ( (r1 a^2 + r2 )^2 + (X1 + X2 )^2 ) ) * (1 / (2π n_sync )) ) * ( 60 * 2π / (12 * 5252) )

Wait, that might be the case. Because 1 N-m is 0.7376 oz-ft, but perhaps the conversion includes 60 Hz to rpm.

Wait, let me compute the torque in N-m first.

n_sync is 1800 rpm. 2π n_sync (in radians per minute) is 2 * π * 1800 = 3600 π radians per minute.

But torque in N-m is T = (a² V² r2 ) / ( (r1 a² + r2 )² + (X1 + X2 )² ) ) * (1 / (2π n_sync )) * (1/ (2π n_sync )) ) ? I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the starting current first, then use that to find torque.

Starting current I_start is V divided by the impedance. The impedance is the parallel combination of (r1 + j X1) and (r2 + j X2)/a².

So, the parallel impedance Z is [ (r1 + j X1) * ( (r2 + j X2)/a² ) ] / [ (r1 + j X1 ) + (r2 + j X2 )/a² ) ]

Let me compute the real and imaginary parts.

Compute denominator first: [ (r1 + j X1) + ( (r2 + j X2) /a² ) ]

r1 is 0.765, (r2 /a² ) is 1.58 / (4.68)^2 → 1.58 / 21.9 ≈ 0.0722.

So real part: 0.765 + 0.0722 ≈ 0.8372 ohms.

Imaginary part: X1 + (X2 /a² ) = 1.88 + (1.88 /21.9) ≈ 1.88 + 0.0858 ≈ 1.9658 ohms.

So denominator is 0.8372 + j 1.9658.

Now the numerator is (r1 + j X1) * (r2 + j X2)/a².

(r2 /a² ) is 0.0722 as before.

So (r2 /a² ) = 0.0722, (X2 /a² ) = 1.88 /21.9 ≈ 0.0858.

So the terms in the numerator are:

(r1)*(r2/a²) = 0.765 * 0.0722 ≈ 0.0553.

(r1)*(j X2/a²) = j 0.765 * 0.0858 ≈ j 0.0657.

(j X1)*(r2/a² ) = j 1.88 * 0.0722 ≈ j 0.1358.

(j X1)*(j X2/a² ) = j^2 1.88 * 0.0858 → j^2 is -1, so - (1.88 *0.0858 )= -0.1612.

So adding all terms:

Real parts: 0.0553 -0.1612 ≈ -0.1059.

Imaginary parts: 0.0657 + 0.1358 ≈ 0.2015.

So numerator is (-0.1059 + j 0.2015).

Denominator is 0.8372 + j 1.9658.

So Z is (numerator) / (denominator) = (-0.1059 + j 0.2015 ) / (0.8372 + j 1.9658 )

To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of denominator.

Denominator's conjugate is 0.8372 - j 1.9658.

So denominator magnitude squared: (0.8372)^2 + (1.9658)^2 ≈ 0.7013 + 3.865 ≈ 4.5663.

Numerator becomes:
(-0.1059)(0.8372) + (0.2015)(-1.9658) + j [ (-0.1059)(-1.9658) + (0.2015)(0.8372) ]

Wait, better to compute as:

( (-0.1059 + j 0.2015 ) * (0.8372 - j 1.9658 ) )

= (-0.1059 * 0.8372) + (-0.1059)*(-j1.9658) + j0.2015*0.8372 + j0.2015*(-j1.9658 )

Compute each term:

Real parts:

-0.1059 * 0.8372 ≈ -0.0887

j0.2015 * (-j1.9658 ) → j*(-j) is 1, so 0.2015 *1.9658 ≈ 0.3964.

So real total: -0.0887 + 0.3964 ≈ 0.3077.

Imaginary parts:

-0.1059*(-j1.9658 ) → j*(0.1059*1.9658 ) ≈ j 0.2083.

j0.2015 * 0.8372 → j*(0.2015*0.8372 ) ≈ j 0.1687.

So imaginary total: j (0.2083 + 0.1687 ) = j 0.377.

So overall, the numerator after multiplication is (0.3077 + j 0.377).

So Z = (0.3077 + j 0.377 ) / 4.5663 ≈ (0.0673 + j 0.0825 ) ohms.

So the magnitude of Z is sqrt(0.0673^2 + 0.0825^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0045 + 0.0068 ) = sqrt(0.0113 ) ≈ 0.1063 ohms.

So I_start = V / Z = 220 / 0.1063 ≈ 2070 amps. That can't be right, because the options are around 30 amps. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that's way too high. Probably I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the parallel impedance. Let me try a different approach. The parallel impedance of two impedances Z1 and Z2 is (Z1*Z2)/(Z1 + Z2). So Z1 is (r1 + j X1 ) and Z2 is (r2 + j X2 ) / a².

So Z_parallel = [ (r1 + jX1 ) * ( (r2 + jX2 )/a² ) ] / [ (r1 + jX1 ) + (r2 + jX2 )/a² ]

Let me compute this again more carefully.

First, compute (r2 + j X2 )/a²:

r2 = 1.58, X2 =1.88.

So (r2 + jX2 )/a² = (1.58 + j1.88 ) / (4.68^2) = (1.58 + j1.88 ) /21.9 ≈ 0.0722 + j0.0858.

Similarly, (r1 + jX1 ) = 0.765 + j1.88.

Now, let me compute Z1 + Z2 = (0.765 + j1.88 ) + (0.0722 + j0.0858 ) = 0.8372 + j1.9658.

Now, Z1 * Z2 = (0.765 + j1.88 ) * (0.0722 + j0.0858 )

Multiply these out:

= 0.765 *0.0722 + 0.765 * j0.0858 + j1.88 *0.0722 + j1.88 * j0.0858.

= 0.0553 + j0.0657 + j0.1358 + j² * 0.1604.

Since j² = -1, last term is -0.1604.

So real part: 0.0553 -0.1604 = -0.1051.

Imaginary part: 0.0657 +0.1358 = 0.2015.

So Z1 * Z2 = (-0.1051 + j0.2015).

Thus, Z_parallel = (-0.1051 + j0.2015 ) / (0.8372 + j1.9658 )

To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by denominator's conjugate:

Denominator's conjugate is 0.8372 - j1.9658.

So numerator becomes (-0.1051 + j0.2015 )*(0.8372 - j1.9658 )

= (-0.1051 * 0.8372 ) + (-0.1051
