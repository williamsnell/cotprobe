Question:

Why must mosses and liverworts (phylumBryophyta) always live in close association with the water?

Options:

A: They release spores that can only germinate in water
B: They have no roots, so they must be submerged in water to remain upright
C: They require high humidity environments but do not need direct contact with water
D: Their leaves are adapted to absorb water directly from the atmosphere
E: They lack efficient water absorption and transport systems, and their reproduction requires water.
F: They are aquatic plants
G: They use water as a habitat to avoid predators
H: They need water to photosynthesize
I: They cannot survive in dry environments

Okay, so I have this question about why mosses and liverworts, which are in the phylum Bryophyta, need to live close to water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my botany, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, Bryophytes are non-vascular plants, which means they don't have a true vascular system like xylem and phloem. That probably affects how they handle water. Without a good transport system, they can't move water from roots to the rest of the plant efficiently. So they must get their water in a different way.

Wait, but why do they need to be near water specifically? I think it's because they need moisture for two main reasons: their structure and their reproduction. Since they don't have roots, they can't absorb water from the soil like other plants. Instead, they absorb water through their leaves, which are usually thin. So they need a humid environment where water is readily available.

Also, I remember that mosses and liverworts reproduce via spores. And I think their sexual reproduction involves water. Like, the sperm cells need water to swim to the egg. If they're not near water, the sperm can't move, so reproduction would be impossible.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Spores germinate in water. I'm not sure if that's the main reason. I think spores can germinate in moist environments, but maybe they don't need to be fully in water.

Option B: No roots, submerged to stay upright. Wait, no, they don't need to be submerged. They just need the environment to be moist. Also, they don't have roots, but that's not directly why they need water for being upright. They can grow on surfaces as long as it's humid.

Option C: High humidity but no direct contact. Hmm, maybe. They do require high humidity, but don't they need some contact? Like, if it's too dry, they can't get water. But I'm not sure if this is the best answer.

Option D: Leaves absorb water from atmosphere. That's probably true because they don't have roots, so their leaves take in water. But does that explain why they need to be near water? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option E: Lack efficient water absorption and reproduction needs water. Oh, this sounds right. They can't absorb water well because no vascular system, so they need external moisture. Plus, their reproduction (like sperm movement) requires water. So this combines both reasons.

Option F: They are aquatic. No, they're not fully aquatic. They live in damp environments but not submerged all the time.

Option G: Use water to avoid predators. I don't think that's the reason. Predators aren't the main issue here.

Option H: Need water for photosynthesis. No, photosynthesis requires CO2 and light, not necessarily being in water. They can do it as long as they have enough moisture.

Option I: Can't survive dry environments. That's true, but the question is why. So while I is correct in part, it's not the full reason.

So the best answer seems to be E. They lack efficient water systems and their reproduction requires water. That covers both the structural need and the reproductive necessity.

Mosses and liverworts (phylum Bryophyta) must live in close association with water primarily due to two key reasons. First, they lack an efficient water absorption and transport system because they are non-vascular plants, meaning they don't have xylem or phloem to move water through the plant. As a result, they rely on external moisture, typically absorbed through their thin leaves. Second, their reproductive process requires water. Sexual reproduction in these plants involves sperm cells that need water to swim to the egg for fertilization. Without water, this process cannot occur. While other options touch on related aspects, such as the need for high humidity or the inability to survive in dry environments, option E provides the most comprehensive explanation by addressing both the structural limitations and the reproductive requirements.
