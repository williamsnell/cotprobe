Okay, so I've got this problem here: compute the binomial coefficient of 85 choose 82. Hmm, binomial coefficients, right? They're like the numbers you see in Pascal's triangle. I remember that the binomial coefficient, which is written as C(n, k) or sometimes as n choose k, represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n without considering the order.

Wait, the formula for this is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)! ). So for this problem, it's 85 choose 82. Let me write that down to visualize it better. So that would be 85! divided by (82! times (85-82)! ). Oh wait, 85-82 is 3, so it's 3! in the denominator.

But wait, calculating factorials for such large numbers like 85! seems complicated. There must be a smarter way to simplify this without computing all those big factorials. Oh right, I remember that factorials can be simplified by expanding them. Let me think about it.

So 85! is 85 × 84 × 83 × 82! because 82! is 82 × 81 × ... × 1. So when I write 85! as 85 × 84 × 83 × 82!, then the 82! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So that leaves me with (85 × 84 × 83) divided by 3! since the denominator is 82! times 3!.

Wait, 3! is 6. So now I have (85 × 84 × 83) / 6. Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 85 and 84. 85 times 84... let me calculate that. 80 times 84 is 6720, and 5 times 84 is 420, so 6720 + 420 is 7140. So 85 × 84 is 7140.

Now, multiply that by 83. Oh boy, 7140 × 83. Let me break that down. 7000 ×83 is 581,000. 140 ×83 is... 100×83 is 8300, 40×83 is 3320, so 8300 +3320 is 11620. So 581,000 + 11,620 is 592,620. So 85 ×84 ×83 equals 592,620.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me double-check that multiplication. Because 85 ×84 is 7140, right? Then 7140 ×83. Let me see: 7000 ×83 is 581,000, 140 ×83 is 11,620. So 581,000 + 11,620 is 592,620. Okay, that part seems correct.

Now, divide 592,620 by 6. Let's do that. 592,620 ÷6. 6 ×90,000 is 540,000. So subtract 540,000 from 592,620, we get 52,620. Now, 6 ×8,000 is 48,000. So subtract 48,000 from 52,620, which leaves 4,620. Then, 6 ×700 is 4,200, so subtract that and we have 420 left, which is exactly 6 ×70. So adding up: 90,000 +8,000 =98,000; then 700 is 98,700; then 70 is 98,770. So the result is 98,770.

Wait, but let me think again. Because 85 choose 82 is the same as 85 choose 3, right? Because choosing 82 items out of 85 is the same as choosing which 3 to leave out. So 85 choose 3 is another way to compute it. Let me confirm that.

The formula says that C(n, k) = C(n, n -k). So yes, C(85,82) = C(85,3). So maybe calculating C(85,3) is easier, which is what I just did. So then, the answer should be 98,770.

Looking back at the options, option G is 98,770. So the correct answer should be G.

To compute $\dbinom{85}{82}$, we use the property of binomial coefficients that $\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}$. Thus, $\dbinom{85}{82} = \dbinom{85}{3}$. 

The formula for a binomial coefficient is:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

For $\dbinom{85}{3}$:

\[
\dbinom{85}{3} = \frac{85!}{3!(85-3)!} = \frac{85 \times 84 \times 83}{3!}
\]

Since $3! = 6$, we calculate:

\[
85 \times 84 \times 83 = 592,620
\]

Then divide by 6:

\[
\frac{592,620}{6} = 98,770
\]

Thus, $\dbinom{85}{82} = 98,770$. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

G: 98770
