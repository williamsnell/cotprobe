Okay, so I've got this question about DNA strands and their complementary sequences. Hmm, I remember that DNA is made up of two strands that are complementary to each other. Each base pairs with its specific partner: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). 

The question gives me a DNA strand sequence: 5′ CGA TTG 3′. Wait, DNA strands are antiparallel, right? So the complementary strand will run in the opposite direction. That means the 5' end of the given strand will pair with the 3' end of the complementary strand.

Let me break it down. The given strand is 5' C G A T T G 3'. To find the complementary strand, I need to reverse the order and then take the complement of each base. So first, reverse the sequence. The original is C G A T T G, so reversing it gives G T T A G C.

Now, taking the complement of each base. G becomes C, T becomes A, T becomes A, A becomes T, G becomes C, C becomes G. Wait, so let me go step by step.

Original sequence after reversing: G T T A G C.

Now, each base's complement:

G → C

T → A

T → A

A → T

G → C

C → G

So the complementary sequence is C A A T C G. But wait, since the original was reversed, the complementary strand should run 5' to 3' in the opposite direction. Or am I getting that mixed up?

Wait, no. The given strand is 5' CGA TTG 3'. So the complementary strand would be 3' ... 5', but when written in the standard 5' to 3' direction, it should be the reverse complement.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's write the complementary strand as the reverse of the original, but with each base's complement.

So original is 5' C G A T T G 3'.

The complementary strand, written in 5' to 3' direction, would be the reverse complement. So, first take the complement of each base in the original:

C → G

G → C

A → T

T → A

T → A

G → C

So the complementary sequence, without reversing, would be G C T A A C. But that's still in the same direction, 5' to 3'. But wait, no, the complementary strand is antiparallel, so it would run in the opposite direction. So the complementary sequence as written in 5'→3' would be the reverse of that.

Wait, let me think again. The original strand is 5' CGA TTG 3'. So the complementary strand, which pairs with it, would have the sequence that is the reverse complement. So for each base, starting from the 3' end of the original.

Original sequence: positions 1 to 6 are C, G, A, T, T, G.

The complementary strand will pair each base in reverse order. So position 6 (G) pairs with C at the beginning of the complementary strand.

Let me write it step by step.

Original: 5' [C][G][A][T][T][G] 3'

Complement: 3' [G][C][T][A][A][C] 5'

But when we write the complementary strand in 5' to 3' direction, we reverse it. So from 5' to 3', the complementary strand is C A A T C G.

Wait, no, because 3' end of the complement is C, so when written 5' to 3', it's C A A T C G, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the complementary sequence is the reverse complement. So the correct way is to take the original, reverse it, then take the complement of each base.

So original: C G A T T G.

Reversed: G T T A G C.

Now take the complement of each base in this reversed sequence:

G → C

T → A

T → A

A → T

G → C

C → G

So the complementary sequence is C A A T C G.

So in 5'→3' direction, the complementary strand is 5' C A A T C G 3'.

Looking at the options, I need to find which option matches this.

Let me look at the options:

Option C: 5' GCU AAC 3' → that's G C U A A C, but wait, wait DNA uses T, not U. So that's not right. Wait, the options have DNA sequences, so it's T instead of U.

Wait, each option is given as DNA, so all Ts.

Option C: G C T A A C → 5' GCT AAC 3' → GCTAAC. Hmm, no, wait, let me see.

Wait, the complementary sequence I found was C A A T C G, which is CATCGC? No, wait, let me spell it out:

C, A, A, T, C, G → so 5' CAATCG 3'.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 5' GCU AAC 3' → G C T A A C → No.

Option I: 5' CAA TCG 3' → C A A T C G → That's exactly what I have.

Wait, option I is 5' CAA TCG 3' → which is C A A T C G. So that's the complementary sequence.

Wait, let me double-check. So the original is 5' CGATTG 3'. The complementary strand is 3' GCCTAA C 5', which when written 5' to 3' is C AATCG → wait, no, wait. Wait, original is 5' CGATTG 3' (positions 1-6: C, G, A, T, T, G).

The complementary strand should be 3' GCTAA C 5', which is the reverse complement. When written 5' to 3', that's C AATCG → 5' CAATCG 3'.

Looking at the options, which one is 5' CAATCG 3'? Let me check each option.

Option I: 5' CAA TCG 3' → Yes, that's CAATCG.

So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but let me look at the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Option C is GCTAAC → which is G C T A A C. No.

Option A: TCGAAT → T C G A A T → No.

Option B: GTTAGC → G T T A G C → No.

Option D: GTTCGA → G T T C G A → No.

Option E: TTACGC → T T A C G C → No.

Option F: AGCTTA → A G C T T A → No.

Option G: same as original → No.

Option H: GCTAAC → same as option C.

Option J: ACGTTA → A C G T T A → No.

So yes, option I is the correct one.

To determine the complementary sequence of the DNA strand 5′ CGA TTG 3′, we need to follow the rules of base pairing in DNA: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). Additionally, DNA strands are antiparallel, meaning the complementary strand runs in the opposite direction.

1. **Reverse the original sequence**: The given sequence is 5′ C G A T T G 3′. Reversing it gives 3′ G T T A G C 5′.

2. **Take the complement of each base**:  
   - G → C  
   - T → A  
   - T → A  
   - A → T  
   - G → C  
   - C → G  

   Applying these transformations to the reversed sequence (G T T A G C), the complementary sequence becomes 5′ C A A T C G 3′.

3. **Match with the options**: The complementary sequence 5′ C A A T C G 3′ corresponds to option **I: 5′ CAA TCG 3′**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
