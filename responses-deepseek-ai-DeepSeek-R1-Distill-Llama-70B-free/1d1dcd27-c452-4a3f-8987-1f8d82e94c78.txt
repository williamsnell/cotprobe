Okay, so I've got this question here about a children's TV character known as 'Da Niao' in China. I'm not exactly sure who that is off the top of my head, but I can try to work through it.

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking for a character's Chinese name, 'Da Niao', and I need to pick the correct one from the given options. Let's look at the options again:

A: Barney
B: Tinky Winky
C: Mickey Mouse
D: Winnie the Pooh
E: Big Bird
F: Thomas the Tank Engine
G: Bob the Builder
H: Dora the Explorer
I: Peppa Pig
J: SpongeBob SquarePants

Hmm. 'Da Niao' translates to 'Big Bird' in English. Wait, does it? Because 'Da' means big, and 'Niao' is bird. So 'Big Bird' would be 'Da Niao' in Chinese. That makes sense because I remember Sesame Street's Big Bird being a large, yellow bird character. So looking at the options, Big Bird is option E.

But wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Sometimes names can be tricky. For example, Winnie the Pooh is known as 'Xiong Winnie' or something like that in Chinese, not 'Da Niao'. Mickey Mouse is 'Mi Lao' or 'Mi Laoshu', I think. Tinky Winky is from the Teletubbies; I don't know his Chinese name, but probably not 'Da Niao'. Peppa Pig is 'Zhu Zhu Xiao Pengyou' or something similar. SpongeBob is 'Haishui Shao Bobo'. Thomas the Tank Engine might be 'Thomas Chufengche', I'm not sure. Dora is 'Duoluo' or 'Duoluo Lulu'. Bob the Builder is 'Bobo Jianzhu Shi'. Barney, I'm not certain about. So, none of those other options seem to match 'Da Niao'.

So putting it all together, 'Da Niao' is Big Bird, which is option E.
