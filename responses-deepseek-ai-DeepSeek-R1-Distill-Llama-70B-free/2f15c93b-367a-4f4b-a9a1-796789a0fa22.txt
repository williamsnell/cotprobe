Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a rifle, bullet, and recoil. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with conservation of momentum. Oh right, momentum before equals momentum after. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem has three parts: a, b, and c. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): The rifle weighs 7 pounds and shoots a bullet that's 1 ounce. Wait, the units are different—pounds and ounces. I need to convert them to the same unit. Oh yeah, 1 pound is 16 ounces, so 7 pounds is 112 ounces. The bullet is 1 ounce. 

Momentum is mass times velocity. Since the rifle is free to move, the total momentum before the shot is zero because both are at rest. So after the shot, the momentum of the rifle and bullet must equal zero. That means their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the rifle's recoil speed as Vr and the bullet's speed as Vb. Oh wait, the bullet's speed is given as 1120 feet per second. So Vb is 1120 ft/s.

The masses are m_rifle = 7 pounds = 112 oz, and m_bullet = 1 oz. Wait, but wait, do I need to convert these into slugs because the units for momentum in the English system are pound-seconds, but velocity is in ft/s. Oh right, because pounds are units of force, not mass. Hmm. Oh wait, but when using the conservation of momentum with imperial units, sometimes people use the weight in pounds as the mass implicitly, but I think I need to convert them into slugs because acceleration is in ft/s², and F=ma would require mass in slugs.

Wait, maybe I should just work with the ratios because the actual units might cancel out. Let me think. So the momentum of the rifle is m_rifle * Vr and the bullet's is m_bullet * Vb. Since the rifle's momentum is opposite, it's -m_r Vr + m_b Vb = 0. So m_r Vr = m_b Vb. Therefore, Vr = (m_b / m_r) * Vb.

But wait, the masses are in ounces. So m_b is 1 oz, m_r is 112 oz. So Vr = (1/112) * 1120.

Let me calculate that: 1/112 is approximately 0.00892857. Multiply by 1120, that's 1120 * (1/112) = 10 ft/s. Wait, but wait, I'm not considering the units correctly. Because pounds and ounces are units of force, not mass. So I need to convert ounces to slugs.

Wait, okay, maybe I should clarify the mass units. In the English system, weight (force) is in pounds, mass is in slugs. So 1 pound force = 1 slug * 32.174 ft/s². So to get mass, I have to divide the weight by 32.174.

So the rifle's mass is 7 lb / 32.174 ≈ 0.2177 slugs. The bullet's mass is 1 oz, which is 1/16 lb, so 1/16 /32.174 ≈ 0.00195 slugs.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Because when you set up conservation of momentum, the units might work out if you treat the weights as proportional to mass. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that in the English system, the mass in slugs can be found by dividing weight in pounds by 32.174. So for part (a), the rifle's weight is 7 lb, so mass is 7/32.174 slugs ≈ 0.2177 slugs. The bullet's weight is 1 oz, which is 1/16 lb, so mass is (1/16)/32.174 ≈ 0.00195 slugs.

But maybe I can just work with the ratio, so the masses in ounces would be 112 oz for the rifle and 1 oz for the bullet. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the unit conversion and just use the weights as if they were masses. Like, in some problems, they treat pounds as mass units, which is technically incorrect but done for simplicity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the units. So momentum is mass times velocity, and in the English system, mass is in slugs. So I need to convert pounds to slugs.

So, rifle's weight is 7 lb, so mass m_r = 7 / 32.174 ≈ 0.2177 slugs. Bullet is 1 oz, which is 1/16 lb. So m_b = (1/16) / 32.174 ≈ 0.00195 slugs.

Momentum before firing is zero. After firing, momentum is m_r * Vr (rifle) plus m_b * Vb (bullet) equals zero.

So 0.2177 * Vr + 0.00195 * 1120 = 0.

Hmm, but wait, the bullet is moving forward, so Vb is positive, and the rifle recoils backward, so Vr is negative.

Wait, but I'm solving for Vr. Let's plug in the numbers.

0.2177 * Vr + (0.00195)(1120) = 0.

So 0.2177 Vr = - (0.00195 * 1120)

Calculate 0.00195 * 1120: 0.00195 * 1000 is 1.95, so 0.00195 * 1120 is about 2.184.

So 0.2177 Vr = -2.184. Therefore, Vr ≈ -2.184 / 0.2177 ≈ -10.03 ft/s. So the recoil speed is approximately 10 ft/s backward. But wait, in part (a), the options don't have 10 as an option. Wait, looking back, the options are A through J. Looking at the options, option E is (a) 10 ft/s. Yes, option E for part (a) is 10 ft/s. Wait, but I need to make sure.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting Vr as about -10 ft/s, so 10 ft/s backward. So part (a) answer is 10 ft/s.

Now, part (b): Rifle is held tight against a man weighing 133 pounds. So total mass is 7 lb + 133 lb = 140 lb. So the combined mass is 140 lb. So m_total = 140 /32.174 ≈ 4.352 slugs.

The bullet's mass is still 1 oz, 0.00195 slugs. So again, the total momentum after firing is m_total * V + m_b * Vb = 0.

So 4.352 * V + 0.00195 * 1120 =0.

So 4.352 V = - (0.00195 * 1120) → 4.352 V ≈ -2.184 → V ≈ -2.184 /4.352 ≈ -0.502 ft/s. So about 0.5 ft/s backward.

Looking at the options, part (b) in option E is 0.5 ft/s. So that fits.

Now part (c): The bullet embeds in a 3 lb 7 oz block. Let's convert that weight to mass. 3 lb 7 oz is 3 + 7/16 = 3.4375 lb. So mass is 3.4375 /32.174 ≈ 0.1068 slugs. The bullet's mass is 0.00195 slugs, so combined mass is 0.1068 + 0.00195 ≈ 0.10875 slugs.

The bullet's initial speed is 1120 ft/s. So the block plus bullet will move with some speed V after impact. So the momentum of the bullet before embedding is m_b * Vb. So 0.00195 slugs * 1120 ft/s ≈ 2.184 slug*ft/s.

After embedding, the combined mass (0.10875 slugs) moves at speed V, so momentum is 0.10875 * V.

Conservation of momentum: 2.184 = 0.10875 * V → V ≈ 2.184 /0.10875 ≈ 20.08 ft/s. So approximately 20 ft/s forward.

Looking at the options, part (c) in option E is 20 ft/s. So all three parts match option E: (a) 10, (b) 0.5, (c) 20.

So the answer should be option E.

To solve the problem, we apply the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum before an event equals the total momentum after the event. The problem has three parts, and each is addressed as follows:

---

### Part (a): Recoil speed of the rifle
The rifle weighs 7 pounds (112 ounces), and the bullet weighs 1 ounce. The bullet is fired with a speed of 1120 ft/s. Using conservation of momentum:

\[
m_{\text{rifle}} V_{\text{rifle}} = m_{\text{bullet}} V_{\text{bullet}}
\]

Converting weights to masses in slugs (1 lb = 32.174 ft/s², so 1 slug = 32.174 lb):
- Rifle mass: \( m_{\text{rifle}} = \frac{7}{32.174} \approx 0.2177 \, \text{slugs} \)
- Bullet mass: \( m_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{1/16}{32.174} \approx 0.00195 \, \text{slugs} \)

Solving for the rifle's recoil speed (\( V_{\text{rifle}} \)):
\[
V_{\text{rifle}} = -\frac{m_{\text{bullet}} V_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{rifle}}}
\]
\[
V_{\text{rifle}} = -\frac{0.00195 \cdot 1120}{0.2177} \approx -10 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Thus, the rifle recoils at approximately **10 ft/s backward**.

---

### Part (b): Recoil speed of the rifle and man
The rifle is held by a man weighing 133 pounds, so the total mass is:
\[
m_{\text{total}} = \frac{7 + 133}{32.174} \approx 4.352 \, \text{slugs}
\]

Using conservation of momentum again:
\[
m_{\text{total}} V_{\text{total}} = m_{\text{bullet}} V_{\text{bullet}}
\]

Solving for the recoil speed (\( V_{\text{total}} \)):
\[
V_{\text{total}} = -\frac{m_{\text{bullet}} V_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{total}}}
\]
\[
V_{\text{total}} = -\frac{0.00195 \cdot 1120}{4.352} \approx -0.5 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Thus, the rifle and man recoil at approximately **0.5 ft/s backward**.

---

### Part (c): Speed of the block plus bullet
The bullet embeds itself in a block of wood weighing 3 pounds and 7 ounces (3.4375 pounds). The total mass is:
\[
m_{\text{block + bullet}} = \frac{3.4375}{32.174} + \frac{1/16}{32.174} \approx 0.10875 \, \text{slugs}
\]

Using conservation of momentum:
\[
m_{\text{block + bullet}} V_{\text{block + bullet}} = m_{\text{bullet}} V_{\text{bullet}}
\]

Solving for the speed of the block plus bullet (\( V_{\text{block + bullet}} \)):
\[
V_{\text{block + bullet}} = \frac{m_{\text{bullet}} V_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{block + bullet}}}
\]
\[
V_{\text{block + bullet}} = \frac{0.00195 \cdot 1120}{0.10875} \approx 20 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Thus, the block plus bullet moves at approximately **20 ft/s forward**.

---

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- (a) Recoil speed of the rifle: **10 ft/s backward**
- (b) Recoil speed of the rifle and man: **0.5 ft/s backward**
- (c) Speed of the block plus bullet: **20 ft/s forward**

The correct option is **E**.
