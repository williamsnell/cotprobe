Question:

Police officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was routinely taking place in a particular room at a local motel. The motel manager authorized the officers to enter the room and provided them with a passkey. Without obtaining a warrant, the officers knocked on the room's door, announced their presence, and told the occupants that they would like to speak with them. The officers then heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. They then used the passkey and entered the room, where they saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet. The occupants of the room were charged with drug dealing and have moved to suppress the drugs. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?

Options:

A: No, because the sound of flushing toilet provided sufficient reason for immediate entry.
B: Yes, because the motel manager did not have the authority to consent to the officers' entry.
C: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.
D: Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.
E: No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.
F: Yes, because the officers should have waited for the occupants to open the door.
G: No, because the occupants were actively destroying evidence.
H: Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.
I: No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.
J: No, because the officers had probable cause to enter the room.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about whether the court should grant a motion to suppress evidence in a drug case. The situation involves police officers entering a motel room under certain circumstances, and the defendants are trying to suppress the evidence obtained.

Let me try to break this down. So the officers had probable cause to believe drug dealing was happening in this particular motel room. The motel manager gave them a passkey and authorized entry. They didn't get a warrant. They knocked, announced themselves, and told the occupants they wanted to talk. Then they heard yelling and the toilet flushing repeatedly. So the officers used the passkey and went in, saw drugs being dumped into the toilet, and charged the occupants.

The question is whether the court should suppress the drugs. The options are from A to J.

I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. A warrantless search is usually unreasonable unless an exception applies. So the key here is to figure out if an exception applies.

One exception is consent. If someone with authority consents, the police can enter without a warrant. Here, the motel manager gave permission. But wait, does the manager have the authority to consent to a search of a room rented by someone else? I think generally, a hotel owner or manager can consent to searches of rooms because they retain a possessory interest or the right to enter. So the manager's consent might be valid. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe if the guests are paying and have a reasonable expectation of privacy, the manager's consent isn't enough. Hmm.

Another exception is exigent circumstances. That's when there's an emergency situation that requires immediate action to prevent destruction of evidence, etc. Here, the officers heard the toilet flushing, which suggests evidence was being destroyed. So the question is whether the situation created by the officers' knock and announcement (which probably prompted the flushing) counts as exigent circumstances.

Wait, but did the officers create the exigency themselves? I remember a case where the police can't benefit from exigent circumstances if they themselves created the situation. Like, if they knock and announce, prompting the suspects to flush evidence, then the police can't use that as an excuse. Because they caused the destruction of evidence by their own actions.

So in this case, the officers announced themselves, which likely made the occupants realize they were there to search. So the occupants started flushing. If the officers were the ones who caused the situation, then they can't claim exigent circumstances. So the entry without a warrant would be illegal.

Alternatively, if the officers had a warrant, it wouldn't matter, but here they didn't. So the warrantless entry would need an exception. If the manager's consent was valid, then the entry was okay. But if not, then they need another exception.

Wait, but if the manager's consent was valid, then the search is okay. So which is it? Let me think.

In the case of a hotel room, the manager typically has the authority to enter the room, perhaps for maintenance or if the rent isn't paid. So the manager's consent would allow the police to enter without a warrant, under the consent exception. But wait, if the police are using the consent as a basis, they have to make sure the person giving consent has the authority. So if the manager allowed entry, that might be sufficient.

But in this case, the police had probable cause. So with probable cause and exigent circumstances, they can enter without a warrant. But if they created the exigent circumstances, then that doesn't apply.

So, the officers announced themselves, which is standard procedure (knock and announce). But by doing so, they likely caused the occupants to start destroying evidence. So if the officers themselves caused the emergency, then they can't use that as an excuse to enter without a warrant.

So the entry would be unlawful, and the evidence should be suppressed.

So looking at the options:

Option D says yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances they created. That seems to fit. If the officers' actions caused the flushing, then they can't claim exigent circumstances.

Option E says no because exigent circumstances justified entry. But if they created the circumstances, E wouldn't apply.

Option B says yes because the manager didn't have authority. I'm not sure about that. If the manager did have authority, then B is wrong.

Option J says no because they had probable cause. But probable cause alone doesn't allow entry without a warrant unless an exception applies. So J is incorrect.

So the main issue is whether the officers created the exigent circumstances. If so, then the motion to suppress should be granted, meaning the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another possibility is that the manager's consent was valid, making the entry legal regardless of exigent circumstances. So if the manager could consent, then the entry was lawful.

I think the Supreme Court has held that a hotel manager can give consent for police to enter a room. For example, in the case where the manager has a master key and allows police entry, that's considered valid consent. So if the manager authorized entry, then the police didn't need a warrant.

But in this case, the police went in after hearing the flushing, so perhaps they used the passkey because of the exigent circumstances. Or maybe they just used the passkey based on the manager's consent.

Wait, the facts say the manager authorized them to enter and provided a passkey. So the officers had the key. Then, when they knocked and announced, and heard flushing, they used the key to enter.

So the issue is whether the initial entry was valid. If the manager's consent was valid, then the entry was lawful. But if the manager couldn't consent, then the entry was unlawful unless another exception applies.

So, if the manager's consent was valid, then the answer would be either I or E. Wait, option I says no because the manager consented. But if the manager's consent was valid, then the entry was lawful, and the evidence isn't suppressed. So the court shouldn't grant the motion.

But earlier I thought that the officers created the exigent circumstances, which would make the entry without a warrant invalid. But if the manager's consent was sufficient, then the officers didn't need exigent circumstances. They could enter based on consent.

So perhaps the answer depends on whether the manager's consent was valid. If it was, then the answer would be that the motion to suppress is denied, so options like I, E, or G.

Alternatively, maybe the consent wasn't valid because the manager didn't have authority, so option B.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of the relevant case law.

In Stoner v. California, the Supreme Court held that a hotel guest does not have standing to object to a search of the room if the manager consents, because the guest has no reasonable expectation of privacy once the manager has the right to enter. So in that case, the manager's consent was sufficient, and the search was valid.

So applying that here, the manager's consent would be valid, and the officers' entry would be lawful under the consent exception. Therefore, the evidence wouldn't be suppressed, meaning the answer would be I: No, because the motel manager consented.

But wait, in this case, the officers used the passkey after knocking and hearing flushing. So they might have used the consent as a basis, but also, maybe the consent was given before any exigent circumstances arose.

Wait, the manager authorized them to enter and provided the passkey. So they had the authority to enter without a warrant based on the manager's consent. So when they knocked and the occupants started flushing, the officers could enter under the manager's consent, without needing to rely on exigent circumstances.

Alternatively, maybe the initial entry was based on consent, so the subsequent observation of drug disposal would be admissible.

Wait, but the problem says that without obtaining a warrant, the officers knocked and announced, then heard the flushing. So perhaps the initial plan was to get consent, but they didn't enter until after they heard the flushing.

Hmm, maybe the consent was for entry, so the moment they were authorized, the entry was legal. So the timing doesn't matter. They had the authority to enter, so when they heard the flushing, they could enter immediately.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the officers used the passkey only after the flushing started, which could be seen as entering under exigent circumstances, not just the consent.

Wait, if the manager's consent was enough, then the officers could have entered at any time. So when they heard the flushing, they used the key to enter, which was permitted by the consent. So the entry was lawful under the consent exception, and the evidence is admissible.

In that case, the correct answer would be I: No, because the motel manager consented.

But I'm a bit torn because the officers might have used the consent as a way to get in, but perhaps the consent was valid. So the answer would be I.

Alternatively, another angle: The Supreme Court case of Kentucky v. King. In that case, the police suspected a drug dealer was in an apartment. They knocked and announced, the occupant tried to destroy evidence, and the police forced entry. The court held that the police didn't create the exigency, so the entry was lawful under exigent circumstances. Wait, in that case, the court said that the police's action of knocking didn't create the exigency because it's standard procedure. So the destruction of evidence by the occupant was foreseeable, but the police didn't create the exigency.

Wait, but in this scenario, the officers had a passkey due to the manager's consent. So perhaps they didn't need to knock and announce, but they did so anyway. Then, upon hearing the flushing, they used the key to enter.

But if the manager's consent was valid, then the officers were lawfully present when they heard the flushing, so they could enter without needing to rely on exigent circumstances. Or maybe the consent was sufficient, so the entry was lawful.

Alternatively, the officers had probable cause and exigent circumstances because evidence was being destroyed, and they could enter without a warrant. But if they created the situation, then that's not allowed.

Wait, in Kentucky v. King, the court said that the police didn't create the exigency by knocking and announcing because that's part of the standard procedure. So the destruction of evidence was a foreseeable consequence, but the police didn't create the exigency. Therefore, the entry was justified under exigent circumstances.

In this case, the officers had probable cause and heard the flushing, which indicated destruction of evidence, and they had a passkey. So perhaps even if the manager's consent was valid, the alternative justification is exigent circumstances.

So if the manager's consent was valid, the entry is lawful. If not, then the exigent circumstances apply. But if the manager's consent was valid, then the answer is I. If the consent wasn't valid, then they need to rely on exigent circumstances, but if they created the situation, then it's not allowed.

Wait, but in Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court held that the police didn't create the exigency when they knocked and announced, leading the occupant to destroy evidence. So even if the officers' actions led to the destruction, it's still considered exigent circumstances.

So in this case, the officers knocked, announced, then heard flushing. So under Kentucky v. King, this would be exigent circumstances, allowing the officers to enter without a warrant. So even if the manager's consent wasn't valid, the entry would still be lawful under exigent circumstances.

Wait, but the manager's consent is a separate issue. If the manager's consent was valid, then the entry was lawful regardless of the exigent circumstances. But if the consent wasn't valid, then they need to rely on exigent circumstances, which in this case, under Kentucky v. King, would apply.

So the answer would depend on whether the manager had the authority to consent. If yes, then I is correct. If no, then E is correct because exigent circumstances apply.

Wait, in the Stoner case, the manager's consent was enough because the guest didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy. So the manager's consent would be valid here.

Therefore, the answer should be I: No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.

But then, some might argue that the officers used the passkey only after the flushing started, implying they relied on exigent circumstances rather than the consent. But if the consent was already given, they could enter at any time, so the timing doesn't matter.

I think the correct answer is E or I. But considering Stoner, I would say the manager's consent was valid, so the entry was lawful. So the answer is I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says No because exigent circumstances justified entry. Option I says No because the manager consented.

So which applies? If both the consent and exigent circumstances apply, but the question is whether the court should grant the motion to suppress.

If the consent was valid, then the evidence isn't suppressed. So the answer would be I.

Alternatively, if the consent wasn't valid, then the officers would need to rely on exigent circumstances, which, under Kentucky v. King, would apply. So the answer would be E.

But I think the manager's consent was valid, so the answer is I.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, a hotel manager can't consent to a search if the room is rented and occupied, because the guest has a reasonable expectation of privacy. But the Supreme Court in Stoner said that the guest doesn't have standing because the manager has the right to enter. So the manager's consent is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is I: No, because the motel manager consented.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

Option I: No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.

Yes, that's correct. So the court should not suppress the evidence because the manager's consent was valid.

The question revolves around whether the court should grant the motion to suppress evidence obtained when police officers entered a motel room without a warrant. The officers had probable cause to believe drug dealing was occurring in the room, and the motel manager provided them with a passkey and authorized entry. The officers knocked, announced themselves, and heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet before using the passkey to enter and observe drugs being destroyed.

Key legal principles include the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the consent exception, and exigent circumstances. A warrantless search is generally unreasonable unless an exception applies. Here, the officers relied on the motel manager's consent and the exigent circumstances of evidence destruction.

1. **Consent Exception**: The motel manager's consent is a critical factor. Under Supreme Court precedent (e.g., *Stoner v. California*), a hotel manager has the authority to consent to police entry into a rented room because the guest does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy once the manager retains the right to enter. Therefore, the manager's consent likely justified the officers' entry.

2. **Exigent Circumstances**: Exigent circumstances, such as the destruction of evidence, can justify warrantless entry. In *Kentucky v. King*, the Supreme Court held that police do not create exigent circumstances merely by knocking and announcing their presence, even if this leads to the destruction of evidence. Here, the officers' knock and announcement led to the flushing of the toilet, which indicates exigent circumstances. However, if the manager's consent was valid, the officers would not need to rely on this exception.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The flushing of the toilet alone does not automatically provide sufficient reason for immediate entry without considering the legal framework.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The motel manager likely had the authority to consent to the officers' entry under *Stoner v. California*.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The absence of a warrant does not necessarily make the search unlawful if an exception applies.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the officers' actions may have prompted the flushing, *Kentucky v. King* establishes that police do not create exigent circumstances by knocking and announcing.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. Exigent circumstances are not the primary justification here because the manager's consent likely sufficed.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The officers were not required to wait for the occupants to open the door once they had probable cause and a valid basis for entry.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. While the occupants were destroying evidence, this is not the sole justification for the officers' entry.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Exigent circumstances can excuse the lack of a warrant in appropriate cases.
   - **Option I**: Correct. The motel manager's consent provided a valid legal basis for the officers' entry, making the search lawful under the consent exception.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. Probable cause alone does not justify warrantless entry unless an exception applies, but the manager's consent made the entry lawful.

Given the analysis, the motel manager's consent was valid and provided a lawful basis for the officers' entry. Therefore, the court should not grant the motion to suppress, and the correct answer is:

**I: No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.**

Answer: I
