Question:

A shop owner domiciled in State A sued a distributor in a federal district court in State A for breach of a contract. The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

Options:

A: No, because the distributor and the wholesaler conduct business in different states.
B: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.
C: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not directly related to the distributor's claim.
D: No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.
E: No, because the distributor has invoked the jurisdiction of the court.
F: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not a compulsory counterclaim.
G: No, because the wholesaler and distributor are incorporated in the same state.
H: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.
I: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.

Okay, so I've got this question about federal jurisdiction, specifically dealing with diversity jurisdiction and when a court can hear a case. Let's see if I can work through this step by step. 

The scenario is a shop owner suing a distributor in federal court in State A. The shop owner is from State A, and the distributor is incorporated in State B but has its principal place of business in State C. So the initial lawsuit probably is based on diversity jurisdiction because we have parties from different states.

The distributor then brings in a third-party defendant, the wholesaler, claiming the wholesaler should indemnify them. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B but has its principal place of business in State A. Now, the wholesaler has a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment of the goods. The distributor moves to dismiss this counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The question is whether this motion should be granted.

I remember that for a federal court to have jurisdiction over a case, it must meet certain criteria, usually either federal question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. Here, the original case is likely based on diversity because the parties are from different states. 

But when a third party is brought in, the court's jurisdiction over that third-party claim depends on whether there's a basis for jurisdiction. Since this is a state law claim, we're probably looking at diversity again.

So, for the counterclaim, the court needs to determine if there's diversity between the distributor and the wholesaler. The distributor is from State B (since it's incorporated there) with a principal place in State C. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B but has its principal place in State A. 

Wait, wait. For diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is considered a citizen of both the state where it's incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business. So the distributor's citizenship would be State B and State C. The wholesaler's citizenship is State B and State A.

So, when looking at diversity between the distributor (plaintiff in the counterclaim, I think?) and the wholesaler (defendant in the counterclaim?), we need to see if they have diverse citizenship. 

The distributor is from State B and State C. The wholesaler is from State B and State A. So, they share State B citizenship. That means they are not diverse because they have a common state of citizenship. Without diversity, the court can't exercise diversity jurisdiction over the counterclaim.

But wait, there's another angle: the court might have supplemental jurisdiction. Supplemental jurisdiction allows the court to hear claims that are part of the same case or controversy, even if they don't meet the diversity requirements, as long as the main claim has jurisdiction.

So the original claim is based on diversity, so the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim if it's part of the same case. Since the counterclaim arises from the same transaction—the contract and the goods—it should be covered under supplemental jurisdiction.

Wait, but the distributor is moving to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. So if the court has jurisdiction via supplemental, the motion should be denied. 

But let me think again. The counterclaim is between the distributor (State B and C) and the wholesaler (State B and A). Since they share State B, no diversity. But because the original suit is in federal court, the counterclaim relates to the same transaction, so supplemental applies. Therefore, the court can hear it, and the motion to dismiss should not be granted.

Looking at the answer options:

Option H says "No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim." That would mean the motion is denied, which aligns with what I'm thinking.

Wait, another thought. The amount in controversy for the counterclaim is $60,000. The original claim was $100k, which meets the diversity amount. But for the counterclaim, even if diversity exists, the amount must exceed $75k. Since 60k is less than that, if the court relies solely on diversity, it wouldn't have jurisdiction. But with supplemental jurisdiction, the amount doesn't matter because it's tied to the main claim. So even though the counterclaim is below the threshold, the court can still hear it under supplemental.

So the correct answer would be H, because the court has supplemental jurisdiction.

To determine whether the motion to dismiss the wholesaler's $60,000 counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be granted, we must analyze the jurisdictional basis for the counterclaim. The original lawsuit is likely based on diversity jurisdiction, as the shop owner (a citizen of State A) sued the distributor (a citizen of State B and State C). Federal courts can exercise diversity jurisdiction when all parties are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

The wholesaler, as a third-party defendant, is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business in State A. The distributor, as the plaintiff in the counterclaim, is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business in State C. For diversity jurisdiction to apply to the counterclaim, the distributor and the wholesaler must be citizens of different states. However, both parties share citizenship in State B, so there is no diversity of citizenship between them. Without diversity, the court cannot exercise diversity jurisdiction over the counterclaim.

Nevertheless, the court may still exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim. Supplemental jurisdiction allows federal courts to hear claims that are part of the same case or controversy as the main claim, even if they do not independently satisfy the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. Since the wholesaler's counterclaim arises from the same transaction (the contract and the goods) as the main claim, it is part of the same case or controversy. Therefore, the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim, and the motion to dismiss should not be granted.

The correct answer is:

H: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.
