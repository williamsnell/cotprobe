Okay, so I have this question about an air-vapor mixture, and I need to find the partial pressure of the water vapor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's think this through step by step.

Alright, the mixture consists of 1 lbm of dry air and 0.15 lbm of vapor. The temperature is 85°F, and the pressure is 20 psia. Wait, I remember that in such mixtures, each gas contributes its own partial pressure, and the total pressure is the sum of these partial pressures.

So the question is asking for the partial pressure of water vapor. I think I can use the ideal gas law for each component. Oh right, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, I need to find the number of moles for each component first.

Let me get the molecular weights right. Dry air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but the molecular weight of dry air is approximately 28.97 lbm/lbmol. Water vapor is H2O, which has a molecular weight of 18.015 lbm/lbmol.

So for dry air:
moles_air = mass_air / M_air = 1 lbm / 28.97 lbm/lbmol ≈ 0.0345 lbmol (I'll calculate this more precisely later, but just a rough estimate for now).

For water vapor:
moles_water = mass_water / M_water = 0.15 lbm / 18.015 lbm/lbmol ≈ 0.008325 lbmol.

Wait, the total pressure is 20 psia. But each gas contributes to the total pressure through their partial pressures. So the total pressure P_total = P_air + P_water.

Since both are ideal gases (I think we can assume that at these conditions), each partial pressure can be found using PV = nRT for each component.

But wait, another approach: the mole fractions. The mole fraction of water vapor is (moles_water) / (moles_air + moles_water). Then P_water = mole_fraction_water * P_total.

Alternatively, calculating each partial pressure using the ideal gas law for each component because they don't interact.

But wait, I think using the mole fraction approach is simpler because we have the total pressure given. Let me try that.

So first, calculate the moles of each. Let's get precise here.

M_air = 28.97 lbm/lbmol
M_water = 18.015 lbm/lbmol

moles_air = 1 / 28.97 ≈ 0.034487 lbmol
moles_water = 0.15 / 18.015 ≈ 0.008325 lbmol

Total moles = 0.034487 + 0.008325 ≈ 0.042812 lbmol

Mole fraction of water, y_water = moles_water / total_moles ≈ 0.008325 / 0.042812 ≈ 0.1943, or about 19.43%.

Wait, that seems high. Oh wait, 0.15 lbm of water is actually more than the air in mass, but since water has a lower molecular weight, the mole count is higher. Hmm, maybe that's right.

Wait, but wait, the total pressure is 20 psia. So the partial pressure of water would be y_water * P_total.

So P_water = 0.1943 * 20 ≈ 3.886 psia. But none of the options are around 3.88. Wait, the options are A:0.1234, B:1.0, C:0.4719, D:0.5964, E:5.0, F:0.75, G:0.308, H:2.5, I:0.023596, J:20.

Hmm, so none of the options match 3.88. So I must be doing something wrong here. Maybe I confused mass and moles somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe I should approach this using the ideal gas law for each component.

For each gas, the partial pressure can be found using PV = nRT.

But to use that, I need to find the specific volume or something else. Alternatively, let's think in terms of the total volume.

Wait, but I don't know the volume. Hmm. Wait, but if the temperature is the same for both, and the volume is the same, then P = nR(T/V), so the partial pressures are proportional to the number of moles.

So P_air = (n_air / n_total) * P_total
Similarly for P_water.

Wait, that's the same as using mole fractions. So maybe I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

moles_air = 1 / 28.97 = approximately 0.034487 lbmol
moles_water = 0.15 / 18.015 = approximately 0.008325 lbmol
Total moles = 0.034487 + 0.008325 = 0.042812 lbmol

So mole fraction of water is 0.008325 / 0.042812 ≈ 0.1943, which is 19.43% of 20 psia is 3.886 psia. That's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the saturation pressure of water at 85°F, not the partial pressure from the mixture. Oh wait, because if the air is dry and it's mixed with vapor, the vapor's partial pressure depends on whether it's saturated or not.

Wait, but the question doesn't mention anything about saturation. It just says an air-vapor mixture. So perhaps the approach is correct, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

moles_air = 1 lbm / 28.97 lbm/lbmol = 1 / 28.97 ≈ 0.034487 lbmol
moles_water = 0.15 lbm / 18.015 lbm/lbmol ≈ 0.15 / 18.015 = 0.008325 lbmol.

Total moles = 0.034487 + 0.008325 = 0.042812 lbmol.

Mole fraction of water: 0.008325 / 0.042812 ≈ 0.1943, so 0.1943 * 20 psia = 3.886 psia.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the partial pressure of the water vapor regardless of the air, but I'm not seeing how that would be. Wait, another approach: using the specific humidity.

Wait, specific humidity (ω) is the mass of water per mass of dry air. So ω = 0.15 lbm / 1 lbm = 0.15 lbm water per lbm dry air.

But how does that help? Well, I remember that the partial pressure of vapor can also be calculated using the formula involving specific humidity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the vapor pressure at the given temperature, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the temperature is 85°F. Let's convert that to Rankine for gas law calculations. 85°F = 85 + 459.67 = 544.67 °R.

But wait, if I use the ideal gas law for each component:

For water vapor:
P_water * V = n_water * R_water * T

Similarly, for dry air:
P_air * V = n_air * R_air * T

But since both are in the same volume and temperature, the ratio of their pressures is equal to the ratio of their moles times the ratio of their gas constants.

Wait, R for air is 53.3533 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R), and R for water vapor is 85.763 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, so P_water / P_air = (n_water * R_water) / (n_air * R_air)

Because (n_water R_water T) / (n_air R_air T) ) = (n_water R_water) / (n_air R_air) ) = (P_water V) / (P_air V) ) = P_water / P_air.

So P_water = P_air * (n_water R_water) / (n_air R_air )

But since P_total = P_air + P_water = 20 psia, I can set up equations:

P_air + P_water = 20 psia.

Substituting P_water from above:

P_air + P_air * (n_water R_water)/(n_air R_air) ) = 20.

So P_air (1 + (n_water R_water)/(n_air R_air) ) = 20.

I can compute the term (n_water R_water)/(n_air R_air):

n_water = 0.008325 lbmol
n_air = 0.034487 lbmol
R_water = 85.763
R_air = 53.3533

So (0.008325 * 85.763) / (0.034487 * 53.3533) )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 0.008325 * 85.763 ≈ 0.7139

Denominator: 0.034487 * 53.3533 ≈ 1.839

So the term is approximately 0.7139 / 1.839 ≈ 0.3886

So 1 + 0.3886 = 1.3886

So P_air = 20 / 1.3886 ≈ 14.4 psia

Then P_water = 20 - 14.4 = 5.6 psia.

Wait, but 5.6 isn't one of the options. The closest is E:5.0psia and H:2.5psia.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, let's compute (n_water R_water)/(n_air R_air) again.

n_water = 0.15 / 18.015 = 0.008325 lbmol
n_air = 1 / 28.97 = 0.034487 lbmol
R_water = 85.763 (ft·lbf/(lbmol·R))
R_air = 53.3533 (ft·lbf/(lbmol·R))

So n_water * R_water = 0.008325 * 85.763 ≈ let's compute:

0.008 *85.763 = 0.686, 0.000325*85.763≈0.0279. So total ≈0.7139.

n_air * R_air = 0.034487 *53.3533 ≈ let's see:

0.03 * 53.3533 ≈ 1.6006, 0.004487 *53.3533≈0.2393. So total ≈1.8399.

So 0.7139 / 1.8399 ≈ 0.3885.

So 1 + 0.3885 = 1.3885.

So P_air = 20 / 1.3885 ≈ 14.4 psia.

P_water = 20 - 14.4 = 5.6 psia.

But the options don't have 5.6. Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption. Maybe the approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the vapor is an ideal gas and uses the total pressure to find the partial pressure based on mole fractions. But according to that, I got around 3.88 psia, which also isn't among the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option E is 5.0 psia, which is close to my 5.6, but not exact. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the R values or mole counts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me try to calculate the partial pressure using the ideal gas law for water vapor, assuming the volume can be found from the total pressure and then applying it to the water.

Wait, let's consider the total mixture. Total moles are n_total = 0.042812 lbmol.

Using PV = n_total R_total T.

Wait, but what is R_total? Since it's a mixture, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, using the total pressure and specific gas constants.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should use the specific humidity approach.

Wait, specific humidity ω is 0.15 lbm water / 1 lbm dry air = 0.15.

I recall that the partial pressure of vapor can be calculated using ω and the total pressure. There's a formula: P_v = (ω / (M_water)) * P_total * M_air / (M_air + ω M_water) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the relation between specific humidity and partial pressure.

Wait, another formula: The partial pressure of water vapor can be found by P_v = (ω * P) / (0.622 + ω), where 0.622 is the ratio of molecular weights (M_water / M_air).

So 0.622 is 18.015 / 28.97 ≈ 0.622.

So ω = 0.15.

So P_v = (0.15 * 20 psia) / (0.622 + 0.15) = (3 psia) / (0.772) ≈ 3.887 psia.

Again, about 3.89 psia. But none of the options match, except maybe E is 5.0, which is higher.

Wait, but earlier when using n_water and R_water, I got 5.6, which is close to 5.0, but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using the saturation pressure of water at 85°F. Let me check: the saturation pressure of water at 85°F is about 0.596 psia (from steam tables). But that's the pressure if the vapor is saturated. However, the question doesn't state whether the vapor is saturated or not. It's just an air-vapor mixture at 20 psia.

Wait, but if it's not saturated, the partial pressure can be anything up to the saturation pressure. But without additional information, I can't use that approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to use the ideal gas law for the mixture, considering the water vapor as a separate gas. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up mass and mole units.

Wait, another approach: Let's find the specific volume of the mixture and then compute the partial pressure.

But without knowing the volume, that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume using the total pressure and the total moles.

Wait, using PV = n_total R_total T.

Wait, but R_total for the mixture would be based on the mole fractions. So R_total = (n_air R_air + n_water R_water) / (n_air + n_water).

Which would be (0.034487 * 53.3533 + 0.008325 * 85.763) / (0.042812)

Calculating numerator:

0.034487 *53.3533 ≈ 1.839

0.008325 *85.763 ≈ 0.7139

Total numerator ≈ 1.839 + 0.7139 = 2.5529

So R_total = 2.5529 / 0.042812 ≈ 59.64 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

Now, with R_total, P_total = 20 psia, T = 544.67 °R.

So V = n_total R_total T / P_total.

n_total = 0.042812 lbmol.

V = (0.042812 lbmol) * (59.64 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R)) * (544.67 °R) ) / (20 psia).

Let me compute that:

0.042812 * 59.64 ≈ 2.5529.

2.5529 * 544.67 ≈ let's see, 2.5 * 544.67 is 1361.675, 0.0529 *544.67≈28.8, total ≈1390.475 ft·lbf.

Divide by 20 psia: 1390.475 / 20 = 69.5238 ft³.

So V ≈ 69.524 ft³.

Now, using the ideal gas law for water vapor: P_water V = n_water R_water T.

So P_water = (n_water R_water T) / V.

n_water = 0.008325 lbmol.

R_water = 85.763 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

T = 544.67 °R.

So numerator = 0.008325 *85.763 *544.67.

Compute step by step:

0.008325 *85.763 ≈ 0.7139.

0.7139 *544.67 ≈ let's compute 0.7 *544.67=381.27, 0.0139 *544.67≈7.56. So total ≈ 388.83 ft·lbf.

Then P_water = 388.83 / 69.524 ≈ 5.595 psia.

Again, I get around 5.595 psia, which is close to 5.6 psia. But the options don't have that. The closest is E:5.0 psia, but that's not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_total or specific volume. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different value for R.

Wait, maybe using R in different units. Wait, I used R in ft·lbf units, but perhaps I should use psi units? No, because the units should work out when using consistent units. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the R_total.

Wait, let me check R_total again.

n_air R_air = 0.034487 lbmol * 53.3533 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) = approximately 1.839 ft·lbf/R.

n_water R_water = 0.008325 lbmol * 85.763 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) ≈ 0.7139 ft·lbf/R.

Total R_total = (1.839 + 0.7139) / 0.042812 lbmol → 2.5529 / 0.042812 ≈ 59.64 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R). That seems correct.

Hmm. So maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about finding the partial pressure using the ideal gas law for each component without considering the mole fractions. So each component's pressure is based on their own moles, R, and T, but in the same volume. So P_air = n_air R_air T / V, P_water = n_water R_water T / V.

But since I don't know V, maybe I can express P_water as
