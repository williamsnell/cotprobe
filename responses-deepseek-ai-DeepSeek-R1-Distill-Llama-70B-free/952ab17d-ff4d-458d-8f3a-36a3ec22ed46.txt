Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability question. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a newly married couple plans to have four children, and we need to find the probability that they'll have three daughters and one son. It also mentions that the sex ratio is 1:1, which I think means that the chance of each child being a boy or girl is equal, so 50% each.

Hmm, right, so each child has two possibilitiesâ€”boy or girl. Since each birth is an independent event, the outcome of one doesn't affect the others. So I remember something about combinations and probabilities here.

I think the way to approach this is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total possible outcomes. The total number of possible gender combinations for four children would be 2^4, which is 16. Because each child has two possibilities, right?

Wait, but wait. Actually, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^4, which is 16. Each child is an independent event, so each has a probability of 1/2.

Now, the favorable outcomes are the number of ways the couple can have exactly three daughters and one son. So I need to calculate how many different ways this can happen. Oh right, this is a combination problem. Because the order matters in terms of which child is the son or daughter.

So the number of ways to choose which one of the four children is the son (since there's only one son). The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!).

In this case, n is 4 (total children) and k is 1 (the number of sons). So 4 choose 1 is 4!/(1! * 3!) = (4*3*2*1)/(1 * 3*2*1) )= 4. So there are 4 favorable outcomes.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the number of ways to arrange three D's and one S. So it's like the number of permutations of the multiset. So that would be 4!/(3!1!) which is also 4. So that makes sense.

So the number of favorable outcomes is 4. The total possible is 16. So the probability is 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4. Wait, but wait, that's 0.25.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh no, wait a second. Because each outcome has a probability of (1/2)^4, since each child is an independent event with probability 1/2 for each gender. So each of the 16 possible outcomes has a probability of 1/16.

So the probability of getting exactly three daughters and one son is the number of favorable cases multiplied by the probability of each case. Which is 4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4.

So the probability is 1/4, which would be option E.

Wait, wait another thing. But wait, I'm confusing something. The problem says three daughters and one son. So the count is correct as 4, and that leads to 4/16=1/4.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the binomial distribution. The probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by (n choose k) * (p)^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Here, p is the probability of a daughter, which is 0.5, and k is 3.

So plugging in the numbers: (4 choose 3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^(1) = 4 * (1/8) * (1/2) = 4 * (1/16) )= 4/16=1/4. So same answer.

So yeah, the answer should be E: 1/4.

To determine the probability that a newly married couple planning to have four children will have three daughters and one son, we start by noting that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl (1:1 sex ratio). Since each birth is an independent event, the total number of possible gender combinations for four children is \( 2^4 = 16 \).

Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which are the number of ways to have exactly three daughters and one son. This is a combinatorial problem where we need to choose 1 out of 4 children to be the son. Using the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 1 \), so:

\[
\binom{4}{1} = \frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 4
\]

Thus, there are 4 favorable outcomes. Each outcome has a probability of \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16} \). The total probability is therefore:

\[
4 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

This result can also be verified using the binomial probability formula:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Here, \( n = 4 \), \( k = 3 \), and \( p = 0.5 \). Substituting these values:

\[
P(3) = \binom{4}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability of having three daughters and one son is \( \frac{1}{4} \).
