Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at a higher temperature, 1500 K. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g) is -115,595.8 cal at 25°C, which is 298 K. I need to find the heat of combustion at 1500 K. Hmm, I remember that the heat of combustion is the enthalpy change when a substance burns in oxygen, so this reaction is exactly that for hydrogen.

Wait, but wait. The given ΔH° is at 298 K, but we need it at 1500 K. So I think this involves calculating the change in enthalpy with temperature for each substance involved. Oh right, because the value of ΔH° depends on temperature.

I recall that the enthalpy change at a different temperature can be calculated using the equation:

ΔH2 = ΔH1 + ∫(T1 to T2) ΔCp dT

Where ΔCp is the heat capacity at constant pressure for the reaction. So first, I need to find the ΔCp for the reaction as written.

The reaction is 2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(g). So let's write the heat capacities (Cp) for each substance. I think the Cp values are in cal/(mol·K), and I'll need to find them for each reactant and product.

I remember some standard Cp values:
- H₂(g) has a Cp around 6.95 cal/(mol·K).
- O₂(g) is about 7.99 cal/(mol·K).
- H₂O(g) is around 8.33 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, am I mixing up C_v and C_p? Oh right, for diatomic gases, C_p is (5/2 R) and for polyatomic, higher. But maybe I should just stick to the data I remember.

So for the reaction:

ΔCp = [2 * Cp(H₂O)] - [2 * Cp(H₂) + 1 * Cp(O₂)]

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔCp = [2 * 8.33] - [2 * 6.95 + 7.99]

Calculating each part:

2 * 8.33 = 16.66

2 * 6.95 = 13.9; 13.9 + 7.99 = 21.89

So ΔCp = 16.66 - 21.89 = -5.23 cal/(mol·K)

Hmm, that's negative. So from 298 K to 1500 K, the temperature change is a rise, and since ΔCp is negative, the enthalpy change will increase (since dT is positive, but ΔCp is negative, the integral might be negative).

Wait, no, the integral of ΔCp from T1 to T2. So the change in ΔH is ΔH2 = ΔH1 + (ΔCp)(T2 - T1), assuming ΔCp is constant over the temperature range.

So T1 is 298 K, T2 is 1500 K. The difference is 1500 - 298 = 1202 K.

So the change in enthalpy would be ΔH1 + (ΔCp)(ΔT).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The formula is ΔH at T2 = ΔH at T1 + integral from T1 to T2 of ΔCp dT. If ΔCp is constant, it's just ΔCp * (T2 - T1).

So ΔH at 1500 K = (-115595.8 cal) + (-5.23 cal/K) * 1202 K

Calculating that second term: -5.23 * 1202.

Let me compute 5 * 1202 = 6010, 0.23 * 1202 = approx 276.46. Total is 6010 + 276.46 = 6286.46. So with the negative, it's -6286.46 cal.

So ΔH at 1500 K = -115595.8 + (-6286.46) = -115595.8 -6286.46 = approximately -121,882.26 cal.

Wait, but wait. That doesn't seem to match any of the options. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cp values. Maybe I should double-check the standard Cp values for these substances.

Ah, another thought: the reaction as written has 2 moles of H₂O(g), and 2 moles of H₂ plus 1 mole of O₂. So the moles of gas are 3 on the reactant side (2 +1) and 2 on the product side. So the change in moles of gas is 2 -3 = -1. But I don't think that affects the Cp calculation unless we're considering ideal gas behavior, but I think the Cp approach is the way to go.

Wait, another thing: I might have the wrong sign for the reaction. Let me think. The reaction is exothermic as written, so ΔH is negative. When temperature increases, the value of ΔH would become more negative or less?

Wait, the calculation I did gave a more negative value than the original. Because the ΔCp is negative, and we're increasing the temperature, so the overall ΔH becomes more negative. But wait, that's only if the reaction is exothermic. Or does the sign of ΔCp determine that?

Wait, the equation is ΔH2 = ΔH1 + ΔCp*(T2 - T1). So in this case, since ΔCp is negative, and (T2-T1) is positive, the change is negative. So the new ΔH is more negative than the original, or less? Because adding a negative number makes it more negative.

Wait, the original ΔH is -115,595.8 cal. Adding a negative number (like -6,286) would make it -121,882 cal, which is more negative. But looking at the options, the options are all around -115,000 to -122,000. So maybe that's correct, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is -121,500 cal, which is close to my calculation of about -121,882. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ΔCp.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong Cp values. Let me verify the Cp for each substance.

I think the correct Cp values (in cal/(mol·K)) at standard conditions are approximately:

H₂(g): 6.95
O₂(g): 7.99
H₂O(g): 9.70 (Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. I think H₂O(g) has a higher Cp.)

If that's the case, let me recalculate ΔCp.

ΔCp = [2*9.70] - [2*6.95 + 7.99]

2*9.70 = 19.4

2*(6.95) =13.9; 13.9 +7.99=21.89

So ΔCp =19.4 -21.89 = -2.49 cal/(mol·K)

Oh, that's a different number. So previously I had -5.23, but if H₂O(g) is 9.70, then ΔCp is about -2.49.

So the change in ΔH would be ΔH1 + ΔCp*(T2 - T1) = -115595.8 + (-2.49)*1202.

Calculating (-2.49)*1202:

2 *1202 =2404
0.49 *1202 = approximately 590.98
Total is 2404 + 590.98=2994.98, but with the negative sign, it's -2994.98 cal.

So ΔH at 1500 K = -115595.8 -2994.98 = -118,590.78 cal.

Looking at the options, option E is -120,000, which is close but not exact. Option D is -122,000, which is even further. Option C is -118,000, which is very close to my calculated -118,590.78.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise Cp values. Let me look up the exact Cp's.

Wait, I'm trying to remember, but I might not have exact values. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use Kirchhoff's law, which relates the change in enthalpy with temperature.

Another approach is that the heat of combustion is typically given per mole of fuel. Wait, but in this case, the reaction is 2 H₂, so the ΔH° is for 2 moles. So the heat of combustion of H₂ would be (ΔH°)/2 per mole. But wait, the question is to find the heat of combustion at 1500 K, so perhaps it's the same as the ΔH for the reaction at that temperature.

Wait, the standard heat of combustion is the enthalpy change for the complete combustion of one mole of a substance. So in this reaction, 2 moles of H₂ are burned, releasing 115595.8 cal. So per mole, it's 115595.8 / 2 = 57,797.9 cal. But that's at 298 K.

But the question is asking for the heat of combustion at 1500 K, so perhaps I need to compute the ΔH at that temperature and then divide by 2 if necessary. Wait, but the question says 'calculate the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas', which is per mole. So perhaps I should compute the ΔH for 1 mole at 1500 K.

Wait, but the given reaction is 2 H₂ → 2 H₂O, so the ΔH is for 2 moles. So when I calculate the new ΔH at 1500 K, it's for 2 moles, and thus the heat of combustion would be that value divided by 2.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says, "calculate the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at 1500 K". Heat of combustion is typically the enthalpy change when one mole combusts. So yes, the given ΔH is for 2 moles, so per mole it's half that.

But wait, in my earlier calculation, I considered the reaction as written, which is 2 moles. So when I compute the new ΔH, it's for 2 moles, so I don't need to adjust it further.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the reaction as 1 mole of H₂. Let me clarify.

The reaction given is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O, ΔH1 = -115595.8 cal.

So for 1 mole of H₂, the ΔH would be half that: -57,797.9 cal at 298 K.

But when calculating the change with temperature, the ΔCp would also be per mole reaction, so perhaps I should adjust that as well.

Wait, perhaps it's better to work with the reaction as given, then adjust at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the given ΔH is per mole of reaction or per mole of H₂. But the reaction is for 2 moles of H₂, so the given ΔH is for 2 moles.

So when I calculate the new ΔH at 1500 K, it's for 2 moles, so that's correct.

But let's proceed.

So using the correct ΔCp of -2.49 cal/(mol·K) (assuming H₂O Cp is 9.70), the change is -2.49 * 1202 = -2994.98 cal.

So ΔH at 1500 K = -115595.8 + (-2994.98) = -118590.78 cal.

Looking at the options, option C is -118,000 cal, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cp for H₂O(g) is actually 8.33, not 9.70. Let me think. Maybe I was confusing liquid and gas. Wait, H₂O as gas has higher heat capacity than as liquid.

Wait, standard Cp for H₂O(g) is around 8.33 cal/(mol·K). If that's the case, then my initial calculation with ΔCp=-5.23 would be accurate. But that gave me a ΔH of about -121,882 cal, which doesn't match any of the options except maybe option G (-121,500), but that's not exact.

Wait, perhaps the Cp values I'm using are not precise. Maybe I should look up the exact Cp values.

Wait, but I'm trying to think without external resources. Let me recall the Cp values more accurately.

H₂(g) Cp: approximately 6.95 cal/(mol·K).
O₂(g) Cp: approximately 7.99 cal/(mol·K).
H₂O(g): around 9.70 cal/(mol·K) (some sources say around 9.70).

Wait, if that's the case, then the ΔCp would be 2*(9.70) - [2*(6.95) + 7.99] = 19.4 - (13.9 +7.99)= 19.4 -21.89= -2.49 cal/(mol·K). So that's correct.

So using that, the ΔH at 1500 K is -115,595.8 + (-2.49 *1202) = -115,595.8 - 2,994.98 ≈ -118,590.78 cal.

Looking at the options, option C is -118,000 cal, which is very close. So perhaps that's the answer. But let me see the options again.

Options are:

A: -119,767 cal

B: -117,250

C: -118,000

D: -122,000

E: -120,000

F: -116,500

G: -121,500

H: -113,000

I: -115,595.8

J: -114,300

So my calculation is approximately -118,591, which is closest to option C (-118,000). But wait, another thing: the assumption that ΔCp is constant over the temperature range from 298 K to 1500 K might not be accurate. Heat capacities do change with temperature, but for this problem, perhaps we're assuming they're constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using more precise Cp values or consider the temperature dependence, but without specific data, that's difficult.

Another approach: perhaps the given ΔH° is the standard enthalpy of formation for H₂O(g). Wait, but the reaction given is combustion, so it's the enthalpy of reaction.

Wait, perhaps another way to calculate this is to use the standard molar enthalpies of formation at both temperatures. But that would require knowing the enthalpies of formation at 1500 K, which I don't have. Alternatively, use Kirchhoff's law as done before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when considering the reaction direction. Let me double-check.

The reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O, ΔH° = -115,595.8 cal at 298 K.

At higher temperatures, the enthalpy change becomes more negative if the reaction is exothermic and ΔCp is negative, because the system is losing more heat as temperature increases. Wait, or is it the opposite? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, when ΔCp is negative, as T increases, the change in ΔH would be (ΔCp)(ΔT). So if ΔCp is negative and ΔT is positive (T2 > T1), then the change in ΔH is negative, making the overall ΔH more negative. So yes, the earlier calculation holds.

So with that, the ΔH at 1500 K is around -118,591 cal, which is closest to option C (-118,000 cal).

But wait, let me think again about the Cp values. Maybe I should use more precise values. For example, perhaps the Cp for H₂O(g) is indeed higher than 9 cal/(mol·K). Let me try with Cp(H₂O)= 9.70.

Wait, let me recompute with precise numbers.

ΔCp = 2*(9.70) - (2*6.95 +7.99) = 19.40 - (13.9 +7.99) = 19.40 -21.89 = -2.49 cal/(mol·K).

ΔT = 1500 -298 = 1202 K.

So ΔH change = -2.49 * 1202 = -2.49 * 1200 = -2988, plus -2.49*2= -4.98, so total -2992.98 cal.

Adding to the original ΔH: -115,595.8 + (-2992.98) = -118,588.78 cal, which rounds to approximately -118,589 cal.

Looking back at the options, option C is -118,000 cal, which is the closest. So I think the answer is option C.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question expects the answer to be the same as the standard ΔH°, assuming that ΔH doesn't change with temperature, which would make option I (-115,595.8) the answer. But that doesn't make sense because the temperature is higher. So I think the correct approach is to adjust for temperature, leading to option C.

To calculate the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at 1500 K, we start with the given reaction:

\[
2H_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2H_2O(g), \quad \Delta H^\circ = -115,595.8 \, \text{cal at 298 K}.
\]

The heat of combustion at a different temperature can be calculated using Kirchhoff's law:

\[
\Delta H_2 = \Delta H_1 + \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \Delta C_p \, dT,
\]

where \( \Delta C_p \) is the heat capacity change for the reaction, calculated as:

\[
\Delta C_p = \sum C_p(\text{products}) - \sum C_p(\text{reactants}).
\]

Using standard heat capacity values:
- \( C_p(H_2) = 6.95 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \),
- \( C_p(O_2) = 7.99 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \),
- \( C_p(H_2O, g
