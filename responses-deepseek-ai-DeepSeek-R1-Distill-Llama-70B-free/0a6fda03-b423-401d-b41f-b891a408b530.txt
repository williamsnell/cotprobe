Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Burke buying some bonds, and I need to figure out how much interest he'll receive. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says he bought three 5(1/4)% bonds. Each bond has a par value of $1,000, and the interest is paid semiannually. Wait, 5(1/4)%â€”does that mean 5 and a quarter percent? So that's 5.25%, right? Because 1/4 of a percent is 0.25%, so altogether it's 5.25%.

Now, since the interest is paid semiannually, that means he gets paid twice a year, right? So each payment would be half of the annual interest. But wait, how do I calculate that?

Let me think. The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, but since this is semiannual, the time per period is half a year. Wait no, actually, when bonds pay interest semiannually, the annual interest rate is divided by two, and each payment is calculated based on that.

Wait, each bond has a par value of $1,000. So the annual interest for one bond would be 5.25% of $1,000. Let me calculate that. 5.25% is 0.0525 in decimal. So 1000 * 0.0525 equals... let's see, 1000 * 0.05 is 50, and 1000 * 0.0025 is 2.5. So total would be 52.5 dollars per bond per year.

But wait, the interest is paid semiannually, so each payment is every six months, meaning each payment is half of the annual interest. So that would be 52.5 divided by 2, which is 26.25 dollars per payment per bond. But wait, that's only if they're paying semiannual interest. Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated as (5.25% / 2) each time. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is: each semiannual payment is (par * rate) / 2. Wait, no, the annual rate is 5.25%, so each semiannual payment would be (5.25% / 2) applied to the par value. So that's (0.0525 / 2) * 1000 = 0.02625 * 1000 = 26.25 per payment per bond.

But wait, the question is asking how much interest he'll receive. So he's getting it semiannually, but we're probably just asked for the annual interest, or the total per payment? Let me check the question again. It says, "how much interest will he receive?" It doesn't specify a time period, but typically, bonds pay interest each period, but maybe the question is asking for the total annual interest he receives. Or perhaps the amount each time.

Wait, the options are various amounts. Let's see, if each bond pays 26.25 per semiannual period, then for three bonds, each payment would be 3 * 26.25 = 78.75. So if he receives this every six months, then annually he'd get 2 * 78.75 = 157.50. But the question is a bit ambiguous about the time frame. Hmm.

Wait, the question is phrased as "how much interest will he receive?" without specifying a particular period. But in bond contexts, when they say interest paid semiannually, each payment is half the annual rate. So the annual interest per bond is 52.5, so with three bonds, that's 3 * 52.5 = 157.50 annually. But wait, looking at the options, option H is $157.50, but another option is D: $78.75. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the amount he receives each payment, not annually. Because if he's getting it semiannually, each payment is 78.75 for three bonds. So each six months, he gets 78.75. But the question isn't clear on whether it's asking per payment or annually. Hmm.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "how much interest will he receive?" Without any time frame. But in such contexts, if it's paid semiannually, the interest per period is calculated, but the total annual interest would be double that. So perhaps the intended answer is the annual interest he receives.

Wait, let me think again. For each bond:

Annual interest per bond: 5.25% of $1000 = 52.50.

Semiannual payment is half of that, so 26.25 per bond.

He has three bonds, so each semiannual payment is 3 * 26.25 = 78.75. So over a year, he'd receive two payments of 78.75, totaling 157.50.

But the question is asking how much interest he'll receive. It's possible that the question is asking for the total annual interest, which would be 157.50. But let me check the answer options. Option H is 157.50, which is option H. Alternatively, if the question is only asking for one semiannual payment, the answer would be 78.75, which is option D.

Wait, the question says "how much interest will he receive?" Without any time frame. So perhaps it's asking for the total interest per year, which would be 3 bonds * 52.50 = 157.50. So the answer would be H.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Each bond: 5.25% annually. 1000 * 5.25% = 52.50 per year. So three bonds would be 3 * 52.50 = 157.50 per year. Since the interest is paid semiannually, each payment is 26.25 per bond, so 78.75 per payment. But over a year, you get two payments, so 157.50.

So the question is, are we being asked for the annual interest or the semiannual payment? The way it's phrased, I think it's asking for the total interest he receives, which would be annually, so 157.50. So the correct option is H.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for each payment. Let me see the options again. Option D is 78.75, which would be each semiannual payment. But the question doesn't specify a time frame, so it's a bit ambiguous. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the problem says "interest is paid semiannually." So each payment is 26.25 per bond, so for three bonds, that's 78.75 each time. So the amount he receives each time is 78.75. But the question is about how much interest he receives. So if it's per payment, the answer is D. If it's annual, it's H.

But the question is phrased as a single amount, not per year. So maybe it's the semiannual payment. So 78.75 would be the amount he receives each time. So the answer is D.

Wait, but the problem says "how much interest will he receive?" without specifying over what period. So perhaps it's considering the annual interest, which would be 3 * 52.50 = 157.50. So that's option H.

Wait, but another way to think: when interest is paid semiannually, the amount per payment is (face value * rate) / number of payments. So for each bond: (1000 * 5.25%) / 2 = (52.50) / 2 = 26.25. So for three bonds, 3 * 26.25 = 78.75 per payment. So if the question is about each payment, it's D. If it's about the total per year, it's H.

So the question is a bit ambiguous. But in the context of multiple-choice questions, perhaps the intended answer is D, 78.75, because it's the amount he receives each time. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the annual interest, which would be H.

Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify a time period, so perhaps it's annual interest, which is 5.25% per bond, so for three bonds, 3*52.50=157.50, which is option H.

I think that's the case. So the answer is H.

To determine how much interest Mr. Burke will receive, we analyze the given information:

1. **Bond Details**: Mr. Burke purchased three bonds, each with a par value of $1,000 and an annual interest rate of 5(1/4)%, which is 5.25% or 0.0525 in decimal form.

2. **Annual Interest per Bond**:  
   The annual interest for one bond is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Par Value} \times \text{Rate} = 1000 \times 0.0525 = 52.50
   \]

3. **Total Annual Interest for Three Bonds**:  
   Since Mr. Burke owns three bonds, the total annual interest is:  
   \[
   \text{Total Annual Interest} = 3 \times 52.50 = 157.50
   \]

4. **Semiannual Payments**:  
   The interest is paid semiannually, meaning the annual interest is split into two equal payments. Each semiannual payment per bond is:  
   \[
   \text{Semiannual Interest per Bond} = \frac{52.50}{2} = 26.25
   \]  
   For three bonds, each semiannual payment is:  
   \[
   \text{Semiannual Payment for Three Bonds} = 3 \times 26.25 = 78.75
   \]

5. **Interpreting the Question**:  
   The question asks, "How much interest will he receive?" without specifying a time frame. In bond contexts, this typically refers to the total annual interest unless otherwise stated. Therefore, the total annual interest Mr. Burke will receive is $157.50.

6. **Answer Selection**:  
   Among the options provided, $157.50 corresponds to **Option H**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: $157.50**
