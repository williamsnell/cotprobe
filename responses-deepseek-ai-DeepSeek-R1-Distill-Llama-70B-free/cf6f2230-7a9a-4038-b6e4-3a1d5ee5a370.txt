F: A qualified privilege of fair comment existed because the newspaper was reporting on a matter of public interest.
G: The newspaper would be relieved of any liability for defamation because the senator is a public figure.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this defamation question about a U.S. senator suing a newspaper. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that defamation cases involving public figures have different standards than those involving private individuals. Public figures are people like politicians, celebrities, etc., who are in the public eye. The key case I think is New York Times v. Sullivan, which deals with this.

In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that for a public official to win a defamation claim, they must prove that the statement was made with "actual malice." Actual malice means that the defendant knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth.

So, in this question, the senator is a public figure. He's suing the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper published a story about him having ties to organized crime, which he claims is false.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The newspaper is liable regardless of truth because the report was damaging. That doesn't sound right. Truth is usually a defense in defamation, so I don't think A is correct.

Option B: Because the senator is a public figure, he has to prove malice. That aligns with what I remember from New York Times v. Sullivan. So B seems accurate.

Option C: The newspaper isn't liable if they had credible sources. Wait, isn't that about negligence? But for public figures, it's not just about being negligent; it's about actual malice. So even if they had credible sources, if they acted with malice, they could still be liable. So C might not be correct because it's not just about credible sources; it's about the knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard.

Option D: The newspaper isn't liable because of the First Amendment. That's too broad. The First Amendment does protect, but there's the malice standard, so D isn't entirely correct because the newspaper could still be liable if malice is proven.

Option E: Senator must prove a personal vendetta. That's not the standard. Malice doesn't require a vendetta, just knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Qualified privilege of fair comment. I think fair comment applies more to opinions based on true facts, maybe in cases of criticism of public performances or something. Not sure how that applies here. The story is about ties to crime, which is a factual claim, so F might not be the right answer.

Option G: Newspaper isn't liable because the senator is a public figure. No, that's not right. Public figures can still sue if they prove malice. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Absolute privilege. Absolute privilege applies in certain situations like legislative or judicial proceedings. Publishing a news story isn't covered by absolute privilege, so H is wrong.

Option I: Must prove malice and direct harm. Wait, no, in defamation, once the statement is defamatory and published, the law sometimes presumes damages, especially for libel. So the plaintiff doesn't always have to prove specific harm, especially if it's per se defamation (like accusing someone of a crime). So I might not be correct.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be B. Because the senator is a public figure, he has the burden to prove that the newspaper acted with actual malice.
