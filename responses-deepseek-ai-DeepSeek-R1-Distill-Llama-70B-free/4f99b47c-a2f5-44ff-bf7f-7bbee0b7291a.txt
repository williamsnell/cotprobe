Okay, so I need to figure out which of the two used car offers is lower and by how much. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the first dealer's offer. The car is priced at $2,500, and there's a 15% discount. I remember that to calculate a percentage discount, I can multiply the original price by the discount percentage and then subtract that from the original price.

So for the first car, the discount is 15% of $2,500. Let me compute that: 15% is the same as 0.15. So 0.15 * 2500 = 375. So the discount is $375. Now, subtracting that from the original price: 2500 - 375 = 2125. So the first car costs $2,125 after the discount.

Now, the second dealer offers the car for $2,350 less 10%, plus a $25 tune-up charge. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to calculate the discount here. 10% of 2350 is 0.10 * 2350. Let me do that: 0.1 * 2350 is 235. So the discount is $235. Subtracting that from $2,350 gives me 2350 - 235 = 2115. But wait, there's an additional $25 tune-up charge, so I need to add that. So 2115 + 25 = 2140. So the second car costs $2,140.

Now, comparing both offers: the first is $2,125 and the second is $2,140. So the first is cheaper. But wait, wait! Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First dealer: 2500 - 15% discount. 15% of 2500 is 375, so 2500 - 375 is indeed 2125. That's correct.

Second dealer: 2350 with 10% discount. 10% of 2350 is 235, so 2350 - 235 = 2115. Then adding 25 gives 2140. That's right.

So the first offer is $2,125, the second is $2,140. The difference between them is 2140 - 2125 = 15. So the first offer is $15 less than the second. Wait, no, wait! Wait, wait. Wait, no, the question is asking which is lower, and how much less. So the first offer is lower by $15.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck. Because the question says, the second dealer's offer is $2,350 less 10% plus $25. So the first car after discount is $2,125. The second is $2,140. So the difference is $15, with the first being lower. So the lower offer is the first one by $15. So the question is which is lower and by how much. So the answer would be that the first offer is lower by $15. So looking at the options, option G is $15.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the options. The question is multiple-choice, so the options are A to J. Let me see: the options are for the amount less. So the first offer is $2,125, second is $2,140, so the first is lower by 15. So the answer would be G, which is $15.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate:

First dealer: 2500 * 0.85 (since 100% -15% =85%). 2500 *0.85. Let me compute 2500 * 0.8 =2000, and 2500 *0.05=125. So 2000+125=2125. Correct.

Second dealer: 2350 *0.90 (10% discount). 2350 *0.9. Let's see, 2000 *0.9=1800, 350*0.9=315. So 1800+315=2115. Then add 25: 2115+25=2140. Correct.

So the first is 2125, second 2140. The difference is 15. So the first is lower by $15, which is option G.

The first dealer's offer is $2,125 after applying a 15% discount on $2,500. The second dealer's offer is $2,140 after applying a 10% discount on $2,350 and adding a $25 tune-up charge. Comparing the two, the first offer is lower by $15.

Answer: G
