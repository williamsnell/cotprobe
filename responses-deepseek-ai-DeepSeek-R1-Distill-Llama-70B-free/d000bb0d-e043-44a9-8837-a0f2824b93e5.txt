Okay, so I've got this insurance question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The building was damaged by fire, and the loss is $78,000. There are four insurance companies involved: A, B, C, and D. Their policies have face values of $15,000, $10,000, $12,500, and $37,500 respectively. The question is asking how much each company would pay on this loss, and there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that when a property is insured by multiple companies, the payment is usually based on the concept of contribution or prorata. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

In insurance, if a risk is covered by several policies, each policy might be considered a separate contract. But sometimes, especially in property insurance, the policies are written on a "prorata" basis, meaning that each insurer contributes proportionally based on their policy limit relative to the total insurance.

Wait, but another possibility is that each company's policy is considered a primary coverage. No, that doesn't make sense here because the total of all policies is way more than the loss. So probably, each company contributes proportionally.

Alternatively, I think the way it works is that each company's share of the loss is calculated based on their policy's face value as a proportion of the total insured amount.

So first, I should calculate the total insurance coverage. Let's add up all the policies: 15,000 + 10,000 + 12,500 + 37,500. Let's see, 15+10 is 25, plus 12.5 is 37.5, plus 37.5 is 75, so $75,000 total.

Wait, the loss is $78,000, which is more than the total insurance ($75k). So that means under the prorata approach, each company would pay their proportion of the loss, but considering the total insurance is less than the loss. Wait, no, waitâ€”if the total insurance is $75k and the loss is $78k, does that mean each company pays their full policy amount? Or is it a coinsurance situation?

Wait, no, I think if the total insurance is less than the loss, each company would pay up to their policy limit. But wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify. The prorata liability means that each company covers a proportion of the loss, not necessarily their full policy. So the total insurance is $75k, and the loss is $78k. So the total insurance is less than the loss, so the insured would only recover up to the total insurance, but each company contributes based on their proportion.

Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. Suppose the loss is more than any individual policy, but the total policies add up to $75k. So the loss is $78k, which is more than the total insurance. So does each company just pay their full policy amount, because the total insurance can't cover the full loss? Or do they still pay proportionally, but only up to their policy limits?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that each company is responsible for their proportionate share of the loss, but limited by their policy's face value. So the calculation would be: each company's payment is (their face value / total insurance) multiplied by the loss, but not exceeding their policy.

Wait, no, that approach can't be right because if the loss is higher than the total insurance, then the total payments from all companies would be equal to the total insurance, not the full loss. But wait, the loss is $78k, and the total insurance is $75k. So the insured would only get $75k total from all companies, which is less than the actual loss. So each company's payment is (their policy / total insurance) * loss. But wait, that would give a total of (sum of all policies / total insurance) * loss, which is (75k /75k)*78k=78k, but that's more than the total insurance. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between two concepts: prorata and excess coverage. Let me try to remember. If the total insurance is less than the loss, then each company would pay up to their policy limit. So in this case, all companies would pay their full policy amounts, totaling $75k, and the insured would bear the remaining $3k as a loss.

But wait, that may not be correct because sometimes the prorata approach would mean that each company contributes a proportion of the loss, but not exceeding their policy. So the correct approach is to calculate each company's share as (policy amount / total insurance) * loss, but if that amount exceeds their policy, they only pay up to their policy limit.

Wait, let's test this. Let's compute each company's share as (policy / total insurance) * loss.

Total insurance is $75k, loss is $78k.

Company A's share: (15k /75k) *78k = 0.2 *78k=15.6k. But Company A's policy is only $15k, so they would pay $15k.

Company B: (10k/75k)*78k= approx 10.4k. But their policy is 10k, so they'd pay 10k.

Company C: (12.5k/75k)*78k= approx 13k. Their policy is 12.5k, so they pay 12.5k.

Company D: (37.5k/75k)*78k= 0.5 *78k=39k. But their policy is 37.5k, so they pay 37.5k.

Wait, but if I add these up: 15 +10 +12.5 +37.5=75k, which is correct because the total insurance is 75k, so the payments add up to that. So the insured would get 75k, and the remaining 3k is uninsured.

So each company's payment is the lesser of (policy amount) or (proportion of the loss). So Company A would pay 15k, B 10k, C 12.5k, D 37.5k.

Looking at the options, option E says exactly that: Company A pays $15k, B $10k, C $12.5k, D $37.5k.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Another approach: If the total insurance is $75k, which is less than the $78k loss, each company would cover their proportionate share of the loss, but not exceeding their policy. So their payment is the minimum of (policy amount, (policy / total insurance)*loss).

So for each company:

A: min(15k, (15/75)*78k)= min(15k, 15.6k)=15k

B: min(10k, (10/75)*78k)= min(10k, 10.4k)=10k

C: min(12.5k, (12.5/75)*78k)= min(12.5k, 13k)=12.5k

D: min(37.5k, (37.5/75)*78k)= min(37.5k, 39k)=37.5k

So yes, each company pays their policy's full amount, and the total is 75k, leaving a $3k loss for the insured.

So the correct answer should be option E.

To determine how much each insurance company would pay on the $78,000 loss, we first calculate the total insurance coverage provided by all companies: 

\[
\$15,000 + \$10,000 + \$12,500 + \$37,500 = \$75,000
\]

The total insurance coverage (\$75,000) is less than the loss amount (\$78,000). Under the prorata approach, each company's payment is calculated as the lesser of:

1. Their proportionate share of the loss, which is \((\text{Policy Amount} / \text{Total Insurance}) \times \text{Loss}\), or  
2. Their policy limit.

### Calculations for Each Company:
- **Company A**:  
  Proportionate share: \((\$15,000 / \$75,000) \times \$78,000 = \$15,600\).  
  Since this exceeds their policy limit of \$15,000, they pay **\$15,000**.

- **Company B**:  
  Proportionate share: \((\$10,000 / \$75,000) \times \$78,000 = \$10,400\).  
  Since this exceeds their policy limit of \$10,000, they pay **\$10,000**.

- **Company C**:  
  Proportionate share: \((\$12,500 / \$75,000) \times \$78,000 = \$13,000\).  
  Since this exceeds their policy limit of \$12,500, they pay **\$12,500**.

- **Company D**:  
  Proportionate share: \((\$37,500 / \$75,000) \times \$78,000 = \$39,000\).  
  Since this exceeds their policy limit of \$37,500, they pay **\$37,500**.

### Total Payments:
Adding up the payments from all companies:  
\[
\$15,000 + \$10,000 + \$12,500 + \$37,500 = \$75,000
\]

This matches the total insurance coverage, leaving the remaining \$3,000 of the loss uninsured.

### Correct Option:
The payments align with **Option E**, where:  
- Company A pays \$15,000,  
- Company B pays \$10,000,  
- Company C pays \$12,500, and  
- Company D pays \$37,500.

**Answer: E**
