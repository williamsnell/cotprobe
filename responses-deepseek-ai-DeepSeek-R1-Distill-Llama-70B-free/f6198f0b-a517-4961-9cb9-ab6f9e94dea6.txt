Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these capitalization questions. 

Alright, the question is about Pine Co. purchasing land to build a factory. They bought the land for $450,000, and there was an existing building there. They had to tear that building down before starting construction. Let me list out all the costs they've incurred:

- Land purchase: $450,000
- Razing the old building: $60,000
- Title insurance and legal fees: $30,000
- Architect's fees: $95,000
- New building construction: $1,850,000

The question is asking what amount Pine should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building. Hmm, I remember that when a company buys land and constructs a building, certain costs are capitalized, but not all. So I need to figure out which of these costs are part of the building's cost and which are part of the land.

Wait, the land cost is separate from the building. So the land's cost would include the purchase price, plus any costs to get it ready for use. But the building's cost includes construction costs and any costs related to getting ready to construct it. 

Let me go through each item:

1. **Land purchase ($450,000):** This is straightforward. This is the cost of the land, so it's part of the land asset, not the building.

2. **Razing old building ($60,000):** This is the cost to remove the existing structure. I think this is considered part of the land preparation. Because once you tear down the old building, it's like getting the land ready for the new construction. So this might be added to the land cost. Wait, but sometimes, demolition costs are considered part of the building's cost if they're necessary for the new construction. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I'll have to think. Oh right, when you acquire land with an old building, the cost to remove it is added to the total cost of the land. Because the land's value includes getting it ready for use. So this $60k should be added to the land cost, making land total $450k + $60k = $510k.

3. **Title insurance and legal fees ($30,000):** These are costs related to the purchase of the land. So they're part of the land's cost. So add this to the land as well. Now land is $450k + $60k + $30k = $540k.

4. **Architect's fees ($95,000):** These are related to the design of the new building. I think these are considered part of the construction costs and should be capitalized as part of the building's cost. So this goes into the building.

5. **New building construction cost ($1,850,000):** Obviously, this is the main part of the building's cost.

So the building's total cost is the sum of the architect's fees and the construction cost. That would be $95,000 + $1,850,000 = $1,945,000.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other costs that should be included? Like, sometimes things like interest during construction or other indirect costs might be included, but those aren't mentioned here. So I think it's just those two.

So the total cost to capitalize for the building is $1,945,000. Looking at the options, let's see. Option C is $1,945,000. So that's the answer. 

But wait, did I miss anything? Let me make sure. The land costs are $540,000, but the building is separate. So the options are only about the building. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine the amount Pine Co. should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building, we need to identify which costs are associated with the building and which are associated with the land. The relevant costs are as follows:

1. **Land purchase ($450,000):** This is the cost of the land and is not part of the building's cost.
2. **Razing old building ($60,000):** This cost is incurred to prepare the land for construction and is therefore added to the land cost.
3. **Title insurance and legal fees ($30,000):** These are costs related to the acquisition of the land and are also added to the land cost.
4. **Architect's fees ($95,000):** These are costs related to the design of the new building and are capitalized as part of the building's cost.
5. **New building construction cost ($1,850,000):** This is the primary cost of constructing the building and is included in the building's cost.

The land cost is calculated as:
\[
\text{Land cost} = \$450,000 + \$60,000 + \$30,000 = \$540,000
\]

The building cost is calculated as:
\[
\text{Building cost} = \$95,000 + \$1,850,000 = \$1,945,000
\]

Thus, the amount Pine Co. should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building is **$1,945,000**.
