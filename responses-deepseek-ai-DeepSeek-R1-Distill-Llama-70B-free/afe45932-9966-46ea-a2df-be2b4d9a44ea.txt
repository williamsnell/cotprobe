Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking. 

The question says there's a store with 8 fish tanks, and each tank holds 40 liters of water. They're asking for the total number of liters in all the tanks. Hmm, that sounds like a multiplication problem because when you have multiple groups of the same quantity, you multiply to find the total.

Wait, let me make sure I'm understanding it correctly. Each tank is 40 liters, and there are 8 tanks. So I need to calculate 8 times 40. 

I remember that 8 times 4 is 32, so 8 times 40 should be 320. Because 40 is 4 times 10, so 8 * 4 is 32, and then times 10 is 320. That makes sense. 

Let me check the options again. The options are A:400, B:380, C:280, D:300, E:360, F:340, G:5, H:420, I:320, J:48. So option I is 320, which matches what I calculated. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward multiplication. Just to double-check, 8 times 40: 40 plus 40 is 80 (that's two tanks), so four tanks would be 160, and eight tanks double that, so 320. Yep, that's correct. 

So the answer should be I.

The total amount of water in all the fish tanks is calculated by multiplying the number of tanks (8) by the liters per tank (40), resulting in 320 liters.

I: 320.
