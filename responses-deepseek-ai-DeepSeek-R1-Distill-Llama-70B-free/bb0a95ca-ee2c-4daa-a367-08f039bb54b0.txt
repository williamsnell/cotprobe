Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jim and Joe being partners. They share profits and losses equally, and last year their firm made a net profit of $28,400. The question is asking what each partner's share of the profit is. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let's start by understanding the situation. Jim and Joe are partners, and they split profits and losses equally. That means whatever the profit is, each of them gets half of it. So the total profit is $28,400, and since they're equal partners, each gets 50% of that amount.

Hmm, so to find each partner's share, I just need to divide the total profit by two. Let me do the calculation: 28,400 divided by 2 equals... let me see, 28,400 divided by 2 is 14,200. So each of them should get $14,200.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes in partnerships, the profit-sharing ratio can be different, but the question clearly states that they share equally. So yes, it's a 50-50 split.

Looking at the answer choices, I see option G is $14,200 each. That matches my calculation. Let me make sure none of the other options are trying to trick me. Option D is $10,800, which is exactly a third of the total profit. But wait, wait, waitâ€”no, a third would be around 9,466, which isn't even one of the options. So maybe I should look again.

Wait, no, 28,400 divided by 3 is about 9,466, but that's not relevant here because there are only two partners. So each gets half. So option G is correct.

I don't think I've missed anything here. The question is straightforward, and the math checks out. So yeah, each partner gets $14,200.

The total net profit of the firm is $28,400, and since Jim and Joe are equal partners, they split the profit equally. Each partner's share is calculated as:

\[
\frac{\$28,400}{2} = \$14,200
\]

Among the answer choices, the correct option is **G: $14,200 each**.
