Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. The question is about the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) and how many points on the interval [0, π] satisfy it for the function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the MVT applies to functions that are continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b). The theorem states that there exists at least one c in (a, b) such that the derivative at c equals the average rate of change over [a, b]. So for f(x) to satisfy MVT on [0, π], the function must meet these conditions.

Wait, but the question isn't about whether MVT applies, but how many points satisfy it. Oh right, I think the question is asking for the number of points where the derivative equals the average rate of change. Because MVT says there's at least one, but sometimes there can be more.

So first, I should check if f(x) is continuous and differentiable on the given interval. Well, sine functions are continuous and differentiable everywhere, so f(x) is definitely continuous on [0, π] and differentiable on (0, π). So MVT does apply here.

Next, I need to compute the average rate of change of f(x) over [0, π]. The average rate is (f(π) - f(0))/(π - 0). Let me calculate f(0) and f(π).

f(0) = 2 sin(0) + sin(0) = 0 + 0 = 0.

f(π) = 2 sin(π) + sin(4π). Sin(π) is 0, and sin(4π) is also 0 because 4π is a multiple of 2π. So f(π) is 0.

So the average rate of change is (0 - 0)/(π - 0) = 0. So the MVT tells us there's at least one c in (0, π) where f'(c) = 0.

Wait, but the question is about how many such points exist where f'(x) = 0. So I need to find the number of critical points in (0, π) where the derivative is zero. Because each such point is where the MVT is satisfied.

So let's compute the derivative f'(x). f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x. The derivative is f'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x.

We need to find all x in (0, π) such that 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0.

Let me write that equation: 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0.

Hmm, solving this equation might be tricky. Maybe I can simplify it. Let's factor out a 2: 2 [cos x + 2 cos 4x] = 0. So cos x + 2 cos 4x = 0.

I can use trigonometric identities to simplify this. I remember that cos 4x can be expressed as 2 cos^2 2x - 1, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, using multiple-angle identities. Let me think: cos 4x is 2 cos^2 2x - 1, but maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, express cos 4x in terms of cos x. I think cos(4x) can be written as 8 cos^4 x - 8 cos^2 x + 1. Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, using the identity cos 4x = 2 cos^2 2x - 1, and then cos 2x = 2 cos^2 x - 1. So substituting, cos4x = 2 (2 cos^2 x -1)^2 -1.

But that might lead to a quartic equation, which is a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps using the sum-to-product identities. Let's see:

cos x + 2 cos 4x = 0.

Let me write 2 cos 4x as 2 cos 4x. Maybe I can express cos x + 2 cos 4x as a product. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of cos x.

Alternatively, let me make a substitution. Let θ = x. So the equation is cos θ + 2 cos 4θ = 0.

Hmm, another identity: cos 4θ can be written as 2 cos 2θ * 2 cos 2θ - 1. Wait, no, cos 4θ is 2 cos^2 2θ - 1. So, perhaps I can write the equation in terms of cos 2θ.

Wait, let's try that. Let me let y = 2θ. So θ = y/2. Then cos θ = cos(y/2), and cos 4θ = cos(2y).

So substituting, the equation becomes cos(y/2) + 2 cos(2y) = 0.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps I can write cos 4x in terms of cos x. Let me think: using the double-angle formula.

Alternatively, perhaps express both terms in terms of multiple angles. Let's try to write the equation as:

cos x = -2 cos 4x.

So cos x = -2 cos 4x.

Hmm, maybe using the identity for cos A + cos B. But in this case, it's cos x plus 2 cos4x. Wait, maybe I can write 2 cos4x as something else.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. But that applies when the coefficients are 1. Here, the coefficients are 1 and 2, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this. Let me see: cos x + 2 cos4x = 0.

Another idea: perhaps express cos4x in terms of cosx. Let me recall that cos4x can be written as 8 cos^4 x - 8 cos^2 x + 1. So substituting:

cosx + 2*(8 cos^4 x - 8 cos^2 x + 1) = 0.

Expanding that: cosx + 16 cos^4 x - 16 cos^2 x + 2 = 0.

Rearranged: 16 cos^4 x -16 cos^2 x + cosx + 2 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quartic equation in terms of cosx. That seems complicated, but maybe it can be factored or analyzed for roots.

Let me let u = cos x. Then the equation becomes 16 u^4 -16 u^2 + u + 2 = 0.

So I have 16u^4 -16u^2 + u + 2 = 0.

This is a quartic equation, which might be tough to factor. Maybe I can try to factor it.

Looking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 2 over factors of 16. So possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±1/2, ±1/4, etc.

Let me test u=1: 16(1)^4 -16(1)^2 +1 +2 = 16 -16 +1 +2=3 ≠0.

u=-1: 16(-1)^4 -16(-1)^2 + (-1) +2= 16-16-1+2=1≠0.

u=1/2: 16*(1/2)^4 = 16*(1/16)=1; -16*(1/2)^2= -16*(1/4)=-4; u=1/2. So 1 -4 + 0.5 +2= (1-4)=-3 + 2.5= -0.5≠0.

u= -1/2: 16*(1/16)=1; -16*(1/4)=-4; u= -0.5. So 1-4 + (-0.5) +2= (1-4)= -3 +1.5= -1.5≠0.

u=2: 16*16=256; -16*4= -64; u=2. So 256 -64 +2 +2= 196≠0.

Hmm, not promising. Maybe there are no rational roots, so factoring might not be easy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to find the number of real roots of this equation in the interval u ∈ [-1, 1], since u = cosx and x is in [0, π], where cosx ranges from -1 to 1.

Wait, but wait, x is in [0, π], so cosx ranges from -1 to 1, but specifically, for x between 0 and π, cosx is between -1 and 1. Actually, when x=0, cos0=1; x=π/2, cos(π/2)=0; x=π, cosπ=-1.

But since u = cosx, and x is between 0 and π, u ranges from -1 to 1. So the equation 16u^4 -16u^2 +u +2=0. Let's call this function g(u) =16u^4 -16u^2 +u +2.

I need to find how many real roots g(u) has in u ∈ [-1, 1], which correspond to real x in [0, π] via u=cosx.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Maybe instead of substituting, I should find the number of solutions to f'(x)=0, which is 2 cosx +4 cos4x=0.

Wait, perhaps using another identity. Let me think about expressing cos4x in terms of cosx.

I know that cos4x = 2 cos^2 2x -1, and cos2x = 2 cos^2x -1. So substituting, cos4x = 2*(2 cos^2x -1)^2 -1.

Expanding that: 2*(4 cos^4x -4 cos^2x +1) -1 = 8 cos^4x -8 cos^2x +1.

So cos4x = 8 cos^4x -8 cos^2x +1.

Substituting back into the equation f'(x)=0:

2 cosx +4*(8 cos^4x -8 cos^2x +1)=0.

Let me compute that:

2 cosx + 32 cos^4x -32 cos^2x +4 = 0.

Rearranged: 32 cos^4x -32 cos^2x +2 cosx +4 =0.

Hmm, looks similar to what I had earlier. So perhaps this approach isn't getting me anywhere. Maybe I can consider another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me set t = x, so the equation is 2 cos t +4 cos4t=0.

Wait, perhaps express cos4t in terms of cos t. Alternatively, perhaps express cos4t as 2*(2 cos^2 2t -1), but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let me factor out 2 cos t.

Wait, 2 cos t +4 cos4t=0 => 2 cos t = -4 cos4t => cos t = -2 cos4t.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe it's easier to graph or think about the behavior of the function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write cos4x in terms of multiple angles. Let me think: cos4x = 2 cos2x * 2 cos2x -1. Wait, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write both cosx and cos4x in terms of exponentials, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation 2 cos x +4 cos4x=0. Let's write it as 2 cosx = -4 cos4x.

Divide both sides by 2: cosx = -2 cos4x.

Hmm, maybe square both sides? But that might introduce extraneous solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express cos4x in terms of cosx. Let me think again: cos4x = 8 cos^4x -8 cos^2x +1.

So substituting:

cosx = -2*(8 cos^4x -8 cos^2x +1).

So, cosx = -16 cos^4x +16 cos^2x -2.

Bring all terms to one side: 16 cos^4x -16 cos^2x + cosx +2=0.

Which is the same quartic as before. So perhaps I need to find the number of real roots of this equation in u=cosx, where u is between -1 and 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the function g(u) =16u^4 -16u^2 +u +2 and see how many times it crosses zero in u ∈ [-1,1].

Let me compute g(u) at several points.

At u=1: 16(1)^4 -16(1)^2 +1 +2=16-16+1+2=3>0.

At u=0: 0 -0 +0 +2=2>0.

At u=-1:16(1) -16(1) + (-1) +2= (16-16)=0 +1=1>0.

Hmm, so at u=-1, g(-1)=1; u=0, g(0)=2; u=1, g(1)=3. So all positive. That suggests that the function doesn't cross zero in u ∈ [-1,1], but wait, that can't be right because then f'(x) would never be zero, which would mean MVT only applies once? But that doesn't make sense because the derivative could have multiple zeros.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me double-check the substitution steps.

Wait, when I substituted cos4x, I got to 32 cos^4x -32 cos^2x +2 cosx +4=0. Then I let u=cosx, giving 32u^4 -32u^2 +2u +4=0. Hmm, wait earlier I thought it was 16u^4, perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let me go back. The derivative f'(x)=2 cosx +4 cos4x=0. So 2 cosx +4 cos4x=0.

Expressing cos4x as 8 cos^4x -8 cos^2x +1:

So 2 cosx +4*(8 cos^4x -8 cos^2x +1)=0.

Compute each term: 4*8=32, 4*(-8)=-32, 4*1=4.

So equation becomes: 2 cosx +32 cos^4x -32 cos^2x +4=0.

Rearranged:32 cos^4x -32 cos^2x +2 cosx +4=0.

Ah, so the quartic is 32u^4 -32u^2 +2u +4=0, not 16u^4 etc. I must have made a mistake earlier.

So the correct substitution is u=cosx, leading to 32u^4 -32u^2 +2u +4=0.

Now, let's analyze this function h(u)=32u^4 -32u^2 +2u +4.

We need to find the number of real roots in u ∈ [-1,1].

Let me compute h(u) at various points.

At u=1: 32(1) -32(1) +2(1)+4=32-32+2+4=6>0.

At u=0: 0 -0 +0 +4=4>0.

At u=-1:32(1) -32(1) +2*(-1) +4=32-32-2+4=2>0.

So at the endpoints and at u=0, h(u) is positive. But maybe it dips below zero somewhere in between.

Let me check u=0.5: h(0.5)=32*(0.5)^4 -32*(0.5)^2 +2*(0.5)+4.

Compute each term:

32*(1/16)=2; -32*(1/4)= -8; 2*(0.5)=1; +4.

Adding up: 2-8= -6; -6+1= -5; -5+4= -1. So h(0.5)= -1.

So at u=0.5, h(u) is negative.

Similarly, check u= -0.5:

h(-0.5)=32*(0.5)^4 -32*(0.5)^2 +2*(-0.5)+4.

Same as u=0.5 except the linear term.

32*(1/16)=2; -32*(1/4)= -8; 2*(-0.5)= -1; +4.

Adding: 2-8= -6; -6-1= -7; -7+4= -3.

So h(-0.5)= -3.

So the function h(u) is positive at u=1 (h=6), positive at u=0 (h=4), positive at u=-1 (h=2), but negative at u=0.5 and u=-0.5.

This suggests that the function crosses the x-axis somewhere between u=0 and u=1, and also between u=-1 and u=0.

Wait, but since u is in [-1,1], and the function is continuous, by Intermediate Value Theorem, if it goes from positive to negative, there must be a root in that interval.

So between u=0.5 and u=1, h(u) goes from -1 to 6, so crosses zero once.

Between u=-1 and u=-0.5, h(u) is at u=-1, h=2; at u=-0.5, h=-3. So it goes from positive to negative, implying a root in (-1, -0.5).

Between u=-0.5 and u=0, h(u) goes from -3 to 4, so another root there.

Between u=0 and u=0.5, h(u) goes from 4 to -1, implying another root.

Between u=0.5 and u=1, as before, another root.

Wait, but wait, how many times does h(u) cross zero? Let me think:
