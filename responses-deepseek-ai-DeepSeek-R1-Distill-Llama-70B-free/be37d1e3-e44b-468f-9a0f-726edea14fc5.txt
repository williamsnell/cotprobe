Question:

Jason cleans swimming pools in a perfectly competitive local market. A profit maximizer, he can charge $10 per pool to clean 9 pools per day, incurring total variable costs of $80 and total fixed costs of $20. Which of the following is true?

Options:

A: Jason should clean 10 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.
B: Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10.
C: Jason should clean 8 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.
D: Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.
E: Jason should clean 8 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.
F: Jason should clean 10 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.
G: Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.
H: Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $20.
I: Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic profits of $10.
J: Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic profits of $10.

Okay, so I need to solve this economics question about Jason cleaning swimming pools. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says Jason operates in a perfectly competitive market, which means he's a price taker, right? He can't influence the market price; he just takes whatever the market sets. So, he can't change the price per pool he charges. The question gives me that he can charge $10 per pool. That's probably the market price.

He cleans 9 pools a day. So, his total revenue would be price multiplied by quantity, which is 10 * 9 = $90. Got that.

His total variable costs (TVC) are $80. TVC are the costs that vary with output, like labor or supplies. His total fixed costs (TFC) are $20. TFC are costs that don't change regardless of output, like rent.

So, total costs (TC) would be TVC + TFC, which is 80 +20 = $100.

Profit is total revenue minus total cost. So, 90 - 100 = -$10. Wait, that means he's making a loss of $10. But wait, the question is about whether he should continue operating or shut down.

In a perfectly competitive market, a firm will shut down if the total revenue is less than total variable costs. Because if TR < TVC, the firm can't even cover its variable costs, so it's better to shut down and avoid those variable costs. But if TR >= TVC, even if there's a loss, the firm can cover some of the fixed costs.

In this case, TR is $90 and TVC is $80. So TR > TVC. That means he should continue operating because he can cover his variable costs and contribute something to fixed costs. So he won't shut down.

So options that talk about shutting down (B, H, I) are probably incorrect because TR is greater than TVC.

Now, the next part is about how many pools he should clean. The question states he's currently cleaning 9 pools. But is that the profit-maximizing quantity?

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm maximizes profit by producing where marginal cost equals marginal revenue (MR). Since the market is perfectly competitive, MR is equal to price. So he should produce until MC = $10.

Wait, but the question says he is currently cleaning 9 pools. So perhaps he is already at the point where MC = MR, which would mean he's maximizing profit. But let's think about costs.

Wait, but I don't have the marginal cost (MC) data here. The problem doesn't give me MC at 9 pools. Hmm. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that 9 pools is the quantity where MC=MR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question gives that when he cleans 9 pools, he gets $90 in revenue, with TVC $80 and TFC $20. So total costs are $100, leading to a loss of $10.

But the question is, what should he do? Since TR > TVC, he should continue operating. So he should clean 9 pools, but he's making a loss of $10.

Wait, but the options say things like economic losses. So let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: clean 9 pools, economic losses of $20.

Option G: clean 9 pools, losses of $10.

Hmm. So which is correct?

Wait, total revenue is $90, total cost is $100. So the loss is $10, not $20. So option G says loss of $10.

But wait, wait. Economic profit is TR - TVC - TFC?

Wait, no. Wait, accounting profit is TR - TC. Economic profit is accounting profit plus any implicit costs, but in this case, we don't have information about implicit costs. So economic loss would be the same as accounting loss, which is $10.

So the correct situation is that Jason should continue cleaning 9 pools, incurring an economic loss of $10.

So looking at the options:

Option G: Jason cleans 9 pools, economic losses of $10.

Option D says $20 loss, which would be if TC were $110, but no, TC is $100.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option G: D: 9 pools, $20 loss. No, option D is 9 pools, loss $20.

Option G: 9 pools, loss $10.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer should be option G.

Jason operates in a perfectly competitive market, meaning he is a price taker and cannot influence the market price. He currently cleans 9 pools per day at a price of $10 per pool, generating total revenue (TR) of $90. His total variable costs (TVC) are $80, and total fixed costs (TFC) are $20, resulting in total costs (TC) of $100. 

Since TR ($90) is greater than TVC ($80), Jason should continue operating in the short run because he can cover his variable costs and contribute to fixed costs. Shutting down would result in losing the entire TVC, so continuing operation is the better choice.

Jason's accounting loss is calculated as TR - TC = $90 - $100 = -$10. This loss is economic as well, as there is no mention of implicit costs in the problem. Therefore, Jason should clean 9 pools per day, incurring an economic loss of $10.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option G** correctly states that Jason should clean 9 pools per day with an economic loss of $10.
- Other options either misstate the number of pools, the amount of loss, or suggest shutting down, which is not optimal since TR > TVC.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G

Answer: G
