Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a stone being thrown upward. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question says the stone is thrown vertically upward with an initial speed of 5 m/s. I need to find its velocity after 3 seconds. Oh right, I remember that when objects are thrown upwards, gravity affects their motion.

Wait, so the initial velocity is 5 m/s upward. But wait, in physics, we usually take upward as positive and downward as negative, right? So the initial velocity u is 5 m/s. The acceleration would be due to gravity, which is pulling the stone back down. So acceleration a is -g, which is -9.8 m/s². Oh wait, or is it -10 sometimes for approximation? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but I think in many cases, they use 10 m/s² for simplicity. Let me check the options. Looking at the choices, they have options like 25 m/s, 35, etc. Let me see: if I use 10 m/s², that might give me one of these numbers.

So the formula I need is probably the one for velocity after time. The equation is v = u + a*t. Right? So v equals initial velocity plus acceleration times time. Let's plug in the numbers. u is 5 m/s, a is -10 m/s² (since it's downward), and t is 3 seconds.

Calculating that: v = 5 + (-10)*3. So that's 5 - 30, which equals -25 m/s. Oh wait, the negative sign means it's in the opposite direction, which is downward. So the velocity is 25 m/s downward.

Looking at the options, option A is 25 m/s downward. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So initial velocity up is positive, acceleration down is negative. So yes, after 3 seconds, the velocity is 5 - 30 = -25 m/s. So yeah, option A is correct.

To determine the velocity of the stone 3 seconds after being thrown vertically upward with an initial speed of 5 m/s, we use the kinematic equation:

\[
v = u + a \cdot t
\]

Here:
- Initial velocity \( u = 5 \, \text{m/s} \) (upward, taken as positive),
- Acceleration \( a = -10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (downward, due to gravity),
- Time \( t = 3 \, \text{s} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
v = 5 + (-10) \cdot 3 = 5 - 30 = -25 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the velocity is downward. Thus, the velocity of the stone after 3 seconds is \( 25 \, \text{m/s} \) downward.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 25 m/s, downward**
