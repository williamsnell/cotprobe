Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with burglarizing a pharmacy. The break-in allegedly occurred late one evening after the store had closed for business. The defendant was identified as the perpetrator of the crime by a film that was recorded during the burglary from a hidden camera. When the defendant was apprehended, he denied involvement in the crime and told the arresting officers that he had been out of town when the burglary occurred. Prior to trial, the defendant's court appointed attorney filed a motion requesting discovery of the videotape film that was recorded during the perpetration of the crime. The trial judge granted the request and ordered the prosecution to send a duplicate copy of the videotape to the defendant's attorney. Following the judge's ruling, the prosecuting attorney, pursuant to state law, then filed a discovery motion specifically asking the defendant whether he planned to raise an alibi defense. The prosecuting attorney also sought discovery of the identity of such an alibi witness. Assume that the judge requires the defendant to respond as to whether the defendant intends to raise an alibi defense. May the judge also require the defendant to disclose the identity of the alibi witness?

Options:

A: No, because revealing the identity of the witness might put the witness at risk.
B: No, because it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial.
C: No, because by requiring the defendant to reveal information before he is tactically ready to do so substantially impairs his ability to successfully defend himself.
D: Yes, because the prosecution should have an opportunity to investigate the merits of the alibi.
E: Yes, as long as the prosecution provides the defendant with a list of their witnesses in return.
F: Yes, because the defendant must prove his innocence.
G: Yes, because the court has a right to know the identity of all witnesses.
H: No, because such disclosure constitutes an implied representation that is testimonial in character and, thus, violates the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.
I: No, because the prosecution is not entitled to know the defense's strategy.
J: Yes, because the defendant waived any claim of privilege when he sought discovery of the film from the prosecution.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with discovery and alibi defenses. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The scenario is that a defendant is charged with burglary. He was caught on a hidden camera, but he claims he was out of town. His attorney requested the videotape, which the judge granted. Then the prosecution filed a discovery motion asking if he plans to use an alibi defense and wants to know the identity of the alibi witness. The question is whether the judge can require the defendant to disclose the alibi witness's identity.

Hmm. I remember that there are rules about discovery in criminal cases, especially regarding alibis. I think the prosecution can ask about an alibi, but I'm fuzzy on the specifics. 

Wait, I recall that in the US, under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, specifically Rule 12.1, the defendant may be required to give notice of an alibi defense. The prosecution can request this information, and if the defendant provides it, they must disclose the names and addresses of alibi witnesses. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

So, in this case, the judge is requiring the defendant to respond whether he intends to raise an alibi. The question is about whether the judge can also require disclosure of the witness's identity.

In the options, the correct answer likely hinges on whether such disclosure is permissible under the law. I think the idea is that requiring the defendant to disclose the alibi witness helps the prosecution investigate the alibi. But there's also the issue of the defendant's rights and possible self-incrimination.

Option D says yes because the prosecution should have the chance to investigate the merits. That sounds plausible. But I remember something about the defendant not being compelled to disclose their defense strategies, but alibi might be an exception.

Wait, the case of Williams v. Florida comes to mind. If I remember correctly, the Supreme Court held that states can require defendants to provide notice of an alibi and the witnesses they intend to call. The Court said that such discovery rules don't violate the Fifth Amendment because the defendant is only required to disclose facts, not to provide evidence of their guilt. So, requiring the identity of the alibi witness is permissible.

So in this scenario, the judge can require the defendant to disclose the identity of the alibi witness. That would make option D correct. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option C says no because it impairs the defendant's ability to defend. But Williams v. Florida suggests that it's okay. So C is probably wrong.

Option H says no because it's testimonial and violates self-incrimination. But again, the Supreme Court ruled that it's permissible, so H isn't correct.

Option I says the prosecution isn't entitled to the defense's strategy. But alibi is a specific defense, and the rules allow for this disclosure, so I is incorrect.

Option D seems to be the right choice because it's about the prosecution's opportunity to investigate the alibi, which is allowed.

In criminal cases, the rules of discovery balance the prosecution's need to investigate defenses against the defendant's rights. Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, specifically Rule 12.1, and as upheld by the Supreme Court in *Williams v. Florida*, defendants may be required to provide notice of an alibi defense and disclose the identity of alibi witnesses. This rule does not violate the Fifth Amendment because it involves disclosing factual information, not self-incriminating testimony. The prosecution's ability to investigate the alibi is a legitimate interest, and courts are permitted to require such disclosure. 

Analyzing the options:

- **D**: Correct. The prosecution is entitled to investigate the alibi, making this disclosure permissible.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The Supreme Court has ruled that such disclosure does not substantially impair the defendant's ability to defend.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The disclosure is not testimonial and does not violate self-incrimination rights.  
- **I**: Incorrect. The prosecution is entitled to this specific information about the alibi defense.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

D

Answer: D
