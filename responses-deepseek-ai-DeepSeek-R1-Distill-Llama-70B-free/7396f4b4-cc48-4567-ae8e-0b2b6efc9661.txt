Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Arthur's "greater moral evil rule." I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking what the principle says. The options are A through J, each presenting a different statement. I need to understand what each option means and which aligns with the concept of the "greater moral evil rule."

From what I remember, moral philosophy often discusses the idea of choosing between evils. I think this rule has something to do with choosing the lesser evil when faced with two bad options. It's like the idea that sometimes you have to pick the option that does the least harm.

Looking at the options:

Option A says morality itself is a great evil. That doesn't sound right. The principle isn't about morality being evil; it's about choosing between evils.

Option B suggests people should commit the lesser evil for personal gain. Wait, personal gain doesn't seem to fit. The rule is more about minimizing harm, not about personal benefit.

Option C talks about moral responsibility for the greater evil. It's about who is responsible, but the rule is about choosing actions, not assigning blame.

Option D says people can keep their earnings unless giving them away prevents a greater evil. This seems to tie wealth to preventing evil, which might be related. Maybe it's about using resources to prevent worse outcomes.

Option E states people must share wealth to prevent a greater evil. This sounds similar to D but uses "morally obligated." So E is about an obligation, while D is about entitlement.

Option F claims being rich is evil and we should live moderately. That's more about wealth itself being bad, which doesn't directly tie to the greater evil rule about choices.

Option G says it's always wrong to do evil, regardless of circumstances. That's an absolutist view, which doesn't fit with the idea of choosing between evils.

Option H mentions two evils not making a good. That's like the idea that two wrongs don't make a right, which is a different concept.

Option I says people can do a smaller evil to prevent a greater one. This aligns with what I was thinking earlierâ€”choosing the lesser evil to avoid a worse outcome.

Option J claims evil is subjective. While that's a valid point, it doesn't directly explain the greater moral evil rule.

So, the rule is about choosing the lesser evil when necessary. That matches Option I. Option E is about sharing wealth, which might be a specific application, but the general principle is about allowing a smaller evil to prevent a larger one. Therefore, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is:

I: people are allowed to do a smaller evil to prevent a greater one.
