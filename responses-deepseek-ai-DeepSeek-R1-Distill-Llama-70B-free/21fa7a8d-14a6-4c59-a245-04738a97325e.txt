Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about ionization energy. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom as 13.527 eV. I remember that ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. For hydrogen, which has only one electron, the ionization energy is 13.6 eV, but here it's given as 13.527, so maybe it's a specific value used here.

The question asks for the second ionization energy of a helium atom. Wait, helium has two electrons. The first ionization energy would be removing the first electron, and the second would be removing the second. But wait, once the first electron is removed, the remaining is He+, which is a hydrogen-like ion with Z=2.

I also recall that the ionization energy for a hydrogen-like atom (like He+) depends on the nuclear charge Z. The formula for the ionization energy (IE) is given by IE = (Z^2 * R_H) * (1/(n_initial^2)), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. Oh, wait, the general formula for the energy levels is E_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2)/(n^2). So the ionization energy is the energy required to go from n=1 to n=infinity. So for He+ (Z=2), the ionization energy would be 13.6 eV * (2^2) = 13.6 *4 = 54.4 eV? Wait, but the given hydrogen ionization is 13.527 eV, so maybe I should use that value.

Wait, the problem statement gives a general equation for emission spectra. The equation is ν = Z² R_H (1/n₁² − 1/n₂²), where ν is the wave number. But I'm trying to find the ionization energy, which relates to the energy required to remove an electron from a specific energy level.

So for the second ionization energy of He, that's the energy needed to remove the second electron from He+ (since He starts as neutral, first ionization gives He+, second gives He²+ which is just a bare nucleus, but wait, no. Wait, helium is He⁰ (neutral) with two electrons. First ionization removes one electron, making He+ with one electron. The second ionization removes the remaining electron, making He²+.

So the second ionization energy is the energy required to ionize He+ from its ground state (n=1) to n=infinity. So the energy required is the ionization energy of He+.

The formula for ionization energy is E = 13.527 eV * Z², because for hydrogen, Z=1, so E=13.527 eV. For He+, Z=2.

So substituting Z=2, E=13.527 * (2)^2 = 13.527 *4 = 54.108 eV.

Wait, looking back at the options, option F is 54.108 eV. So that should be the answer.

But wait, just to make sure. The given equation is for emission spectra. Do I need to use that? Well, the second ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron, which would correspond to the energy difference between n=1 and n=∞.

So using the formula E = Z² * R_H * hc / n², but wait, ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron from energy level n to infinity. So the energy for ionization is E = (Z² * R_H) * (1/n_initial²), because when moving to infinity, the term becomes zero.

Wait, but the Rydberg constant R_H is given in terms of wave numbers, but here we're dealing with energy in eV. Let me make sure about the units.

Alternatively, since the hydrogen atom's ionization energy is given as 13.527 eV, which equals 13.6 eV approximately, so that's for Z=1. So for Z=2, it's (2)^2 times that value, so 4*13.527 = 54.108 eV.

So the answer should be F: 54.108 eV.

To calculate the second ionization energy of a helium atom, we start by recognizing that the second ionization energy corresponds to the energy required to remove the remaining electron from the He⁺ ion, leaving it as He²⁺. The He⁺ ion is a hydrogen-like system with a nuclear charge \( Z = 2 \).

The ionization energy for a hydrogen-like atom is given by the formula:

\[
E = Z^2 \cdot \text{Ionization energy of hydrogen}
\]

Here, the ionization energy of hydrogen is provided as \( 13.527 \, \text{eV} \). Substituting \( Z = 2 \) for He⁺:

\[
E = 2^2 \cdot 13.527 = 4 \cdot 13.527 = 54.108 \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the second ionization energy of helium is \( 54.108 \, \text{eV} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 54.108 eV**
