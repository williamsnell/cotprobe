Question:

A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2 days ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (101°F).

Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?

Options:

A: Disruption of vascular basement membranes
B: Decreased plasma protein concentration
C: Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure
D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation
E: Reduced lymphatic drainage
F: Release of thromboxane
G: High blood pressure
H: Release of histamine
I: Separation of endothelial junctions
J: Increased hydrostatic pressure

Okay, so I have this medical question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The patient is a 35-year-old man who comes to the physician with pain and swelling in his right arm. He scraped it on a tree branch two days ago. His temperature is 38.3°C, which is a bit high, like a low-grade fever. When they examined his right forearm, there's edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the trauma site. Fluctuant means it's fluid-filled, like a blister or abscess maybe? And the area is really tender when they touch it.

The question is asking about the primary mechanism causing the edema in this patient. The options are from A to J, each a different mechanism.

I remember that edema is the accumulation of excess fluid within the interstitial tissue. It can result from various factors like increased hydrostatic pressure, decreased oncotic pressure, lymphatic obstruction, or increased capillary permeability.

In this case, the patient has a history of trauma, a scrape, which got infected maybe, given the signs of inflammation—redness, swelling, pain, and warmth. The presence of a fluctuant lesion suggests a collection of pus, so probably an abscess or cellulitis.

So thinking about the pathophysiology, when there's an infection or inflammation, the body's immune response kicks in. Inflammation leads to the release of histamine and other chemical mediators from mast cells. These mediators cause the blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. So the capillaries start leaking more fluid into the interstitial space.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation. That fits because inflammation causes the capillaries to become leaky, leading to edema.

Option I: Separation of endothelial junctions. That's related too because the increased permeability is due to the endothelial cells separating, allowing proteins and fluid to escape. But is that the primary mechanism or just a part of the process?

Option H: Release of histamine. Histamine does cause increased permeability, but the question is about the mechanism, not the cause. So the primary mechanism would be the result of histamine, which is the increased permeability.

Other options: 

A: Disruption of vascular basement membranes—maybe in more severe cases like with certain diseases or burns, but this seems like a typical infection.

B: Decreased plasma protein concentration—happens in liver or kidney diseases, but not likely here.

C: Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure—usually that would decrease edema, but in heart failure, it's increased hydrostatic that causes edema. So this is probably not it.

E: Reduced lymphatic drainage—could cause edema, but the scenario doesn't suggest blockage of lymph nodes or filariasis or something.

F: Release of thromboxane—thromboxane is more involved in platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, not directly causing edema.

G: High blood pressure—systemic hypertension doesn't directly cause localized edema like this. It's more of a systemic issue.

J: Increased hydrostatic pressure—like in heart failure or obstructive sleep apnea, but again, that's more systemic, not localized to a trauma site.

So the primary mechanism here is increased capillary permeability due to inflammation. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between D and I. Because increased permeability is due to separation of endothelial junctions. So is the mechanism the separation or the permeability increase? The question asks for the primary mechanism, so I think it's the increased permeability, which is option D. Because that's the overall effect leading to edema, while the separation is a part of how it happens. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, the primary mechanism is the separation of endothelial junctions (I), which allows fluid to leak. So which one is considered the primary?

Hmm. I think the mechanism leading to edema is the increased permeability, which is due to the separation of the junctions. So the increased permeability is the mechanism, making D the correct answer. Because the question is about the mechanism, not the underlying cause.

So I'll go with D.

The patient is a 35-year-old man presenting with pain, swelling, and fever after scraping his arm, which has developed into a fluctuant erythematous lesion. The clinical signs suggest an inflammatory response, likely due to infection. Edema in this context is primarily caused by increased capillary permeability, a hallmark of inflammation. This occurs because inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, cause blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable, allowing fluid and proteins to leak into the interstitial space. 

Analyzing the options:

- **D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation** is the most accurate answer, as it directly describes the primary mechanism leading to edema in this inflammatory process.
- **I: Separation of endothelial junctions** is a contributing factor but is a more specific process underlying the increased permeability, not the primary mechanism itself.
- Other options, such as decreased plasma protein concentration (B), reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure (C), reduced lymphatic drainage (E), and others, are less relevant to this localized inflammatory scenario.

Thus, the primary mechanism of edema development in this patient is increased capillary permeability due to inflammation.

Answer: D
