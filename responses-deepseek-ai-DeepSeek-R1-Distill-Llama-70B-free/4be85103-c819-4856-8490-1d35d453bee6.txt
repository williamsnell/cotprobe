Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Augustine's views on happiness. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what Augustine claims is necessary for one to be happy. The options are A through J, each listing different possibilities. I remember that Augustine was a Christian philosopher and theologian, so his ideas probably relate to religious or philosophical concepts rather than scientific ones.

Looking at the options, A is about the fundamental laws of physics. That doesn't seem right because Augustine's focus wasn't on physics. Similarly, J talks about natural occurrences, which might be more about science than philosophy or theology. So I can probably eliminate A and J.

Option B says the purpose of life. That sounds plausible because many philosophers, especially those with religious inclinations, emphasize understanding life's purpose as key to happiness. Augustine might argue that knowing one's purpose, especially in relation to God, leads to true happiness.

Option C is about the existence of the divine. Augustine was deeply influenced by Christianity, so believing in God or the divine would be central to his views. But does he say that just knowing the existence is enough, or is it more about knowing the purpose?

Option D mentions the causes of good and evil. While Augustine did discuss the problem of evil, I'm not sure if he tied that directly to happiness. It seems more like a related but separate issue.

Option E says both A and B. Wait, A is physics laws, which I don't think Augustine emphasized for happiness, so E is probably not correct.

Option F combines E and F, but E is already A and B, and F isn't defined here. Wait, the options probably have a typo, but I think F is just an option that's not relevant because E is already covered.

Option G is about the nature of the universe. Again, more of a scientific angle, which doesn't fit Augustine's focus.

Option H says neither E nor F. But since E is A and B, and I think B (purpose of life) is correct, H might not be right.

Option I is neither A nor B. So if A is wrong, but B is correct, I wouldn't choose I.

Wait, let me clarify. The question is about what Augustine claims is necessary for happiness. From what I recall, Augustine argued that true happiness comes from knowing and loving God. He believed that without a relationship with God, humans can't achieve true happiness. So, knowing the purpose of life, which is to know and serve God, would be central.

So between B and C. Option B is purpose of life, C is existence of divine. Which one is more accurate?

Augustine's Confessions talk about the restless heart until it finds rest in God. So knowing God exists (C) is part of it, but the purpose of life (B) is more about why we're here. So maybe B is the better answer.

Alternatively, maybe it's C because without believing in the divine, one can't know the purpose. But I think the key is that knowing the purpose, which is tied to the divine, is what brings happiness.

So I'm leaning towards B: the purpose of life. But wait, another thought. Augustine might have said that to be happy, one must know God, which would tie into knowing the divine (C). Or perhaps both B and C are part of it.

Wait, looking at the options again. The question is about what Augustine claims is necessary to know. So, he might say that one must know the purpose of life, which inherently involves knowing the divine.

Hmm, but the options are separate. So the options are: B is purpose, C is existence of divine. Which one is the correct answer?

I think in Augustine's view, knowing the purpose of life is the key, and that purpose is to know and love God. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but another angle: in his work, Augustine emphasizes that the happy life is the life lived in pursuit of divine wisdom. So perhaps knowing the existence of the divine (C) is necessary to achieve happiness.

Alternatively, maybe the question is pointing towards B. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should think about primary sources. In "On the Happy Life," Augustine writes that true happiness is obtained by knowing and partaking in the divine. So perhaps knowing the existence of the divine is the key.

But then again, knowing the purpose of life is closely tied to that. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B because without knowing the purpose (which is to seek God), one can't be happy. So the answer is B.

Wait, but looking back, I think the correct answer is B: the purpose of life. Because Augustine's philosophy centers on the idea that humans were made for God, and thus our purpose is to know and love Him. So knowing that purpose leads to happiness.

So I'll go with option B.
</think>

Augustine, a Christian philosopher and theologian, emphasized that true happiness is achieved through a relationship with God. Among the options provided, the most relevant is knowing the purpose of life, as this aligns with Augustine's belief that human purpose is to know and love God. While knowing the existence of the divine (Option C) is important, Augustine's focus on the purpose of life (Option B) as the key to happiness makes B the correct answer.

Answer: B
