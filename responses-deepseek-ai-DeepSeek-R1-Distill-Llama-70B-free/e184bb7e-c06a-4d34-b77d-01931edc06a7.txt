Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about primary prevention, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the facets of primary prevention. I remember that prevention in public health is categorized into different levels or types. I think the main ones are primary, secondary, tertiary, and sometimes quaternary. But wait, the question is specifically about primary prevention and its facets.

Wait, primary prevention is about preventing disease before it occurs. So, it's the first level of prevention. I think the facets or types within primary prevention are more specific strategies. I remember terms like universal, selective, and indicative prevention. Let me break that down.

Universal prevention would target the entire population, regardless of risk factors. Like vaccination campaigns or adding fluoride to waterâ€”everyone gets it because it's meant to prevent diseases in the general population.

Selective prevention targets specific groups that are at higher risk. For example, offering certain vaccines to people traveling to areas where a disease is common, or providing folic acid supplements to pregnant women to prevent birth defects.

Indicative prevention, if I recall correctly, is aimed at individuals who have a higher risk due to certain factors, but aren't necessarily showing symptoms yet. It's more personalized. Like screening for genetic predispositions or offering counseling to people with a family history of a disease.

So the facets of primary prevention are universal, selective, and indicative. Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Universal, selective, and preventive. Hmm, 'preventive' seems too broad; that's more the category than a facet.

Option B: Primary, secondary, tertiary. No, those are the different levels, not the facets within primary.

Option C: Primary, secondary, quaternary. Again, different levels, not facets.

Option D: General, selective, indicative. 'General' sounds similar to universal, but not the exact term I remember.

Option E: Universal, selective, indicative. Yes, this matches what I was thinking.

Option F: Primary, universal, indicative. No, because 'primary' is the category, not a facet within it.

Options G, H, I, J: Either use wrong terms or don't fit.

So the correct answer should be option E.

The facets of primary prevention are strategies aimed at preventing disease before it occurs. They include universal prevention (targeting the entire population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicative prevention (targeting individuals with specific risk factors). Among the options, only option E correctly lists these facets.

Answer: E
