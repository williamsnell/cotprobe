Question:

A typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed by treatment withlysozyme, an enzyme that selectively dissolves the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? Explain. What is the biochemicaldifference between the cell walls of bacteria, and plants?

Options:

A: The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is equal to the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of insoluble peptidoglycan, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.
B: The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure. The cell wall of bacteria is similar to that of plants, both composed of cellulose.
C: The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall as long as it is provided with an external structural support. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, distinct from the cellulose-based cell walls of plants.
D: The cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of peptidoglycan.
E: The bacterial cell can only live without its cell wall in a hypertonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is higher outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of chitin, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.
F: The bacterial cell can survive without its cell wall in a hypotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is lower outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is made of glycoproteins, in contrast to the cellulose in plant cell walls.
G: The bacterial cell cannot survive without its cell wall in any circumstances.
H: The cell wall of bacteria is composed of lipids.
I: The bacterial cell wall can regenerate quickly after removal, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily. The biochemical difference is that bacterial cell walls have a higher lipid content compared to the cellulose-rich cell walls of plants.
J: The bacterial cell cannot live without its cell wall because it provides essential nutrients. The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.

Okay, so I have this question about bacterial cell walls and what happens when they're removed. Hmm, I remember that bacterial cell walls are important for structure, but I'm not exactly sure what happens without them. Let me think.

The question says the cell wall is removed using lysozyme. I've heard that lysozyme breaks down peptidoglycan, which is a component of bacterial cell walls. So if the cell wall is gone, what happens to the cell?

I think about how cells handle osmotic pressure. Plants have cell walls that prevent them from bursting in hypotonic solutions because the wall provides support. Similarly, I think bacteria might rely on their cell walls for the same reason. Without the cell wall, the plasma membrane would be exposed.

So if the cell wall is removed, the bacterial cell would be like a protoplast. I remember that in hypotonic solutions, cells without a cell wall can swell and burst because there's nothing to stop the influx of water. But if the solution is isotonic, then there's no net movement, so the cell might survive. Oh wait, but waitâ€”bacteria can sometimes survive without their cell walls, but they might need some support.

Wait, the options are about whether the cell can live and the composition differences. The question also asks about the biochemical difference between bacterial and plant cell walls.

So, plant cell walls are mainly cellulose, right? And bacterial cell walls are peptidoglycan (also called murein). So any option saying bacterial cell walls have peptidoglycan and plant have cellulose would be correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Bacterial cell can live without cell wall in isotonic medium. Cell walls are insoluble peptidoglycan vs. plant's cellulose. That sounds right. Because if the medium is isotonic, the cell won't swell or shrink, so the plasma membrane isn't stressed.

Option B says cell walls are similar (cellulose), which I don't think is correct. Bacteria have peptidoglycan, not cellulose.

Option C says cell wall is a mix of proteins and carbs. I think bacteria's cell walls are primarily peptidoglycan, which is a mix of sugar and amino acids, so maybe that's correct, but C says 'provided with external support' which I'm not sure about. I thought without the cell wall, they can live in isotonic without support.

Option D: Plant cell walls have peptidoglycan? No, that's wrong.

Option E: Cell wall is chitin? No, bacteria don't have chitin. Chitin is like in fungi cell walls or exoskeletons.

Option F: Made of glycoproteins? No, that's not right. Bacterial cell walls are peptidoglycan.

Option G: Can't survive without cell wall. I don't think so. I remember that in isotonic they can survive.

Option H: Lipids? No, cell walls aren't made of lipids.

Option I: Regenerate quickly? Not sure, but I don't think so. Lysozyme treatment probably inhibits that. Also, the lipid content part is wrong.

Option J: Made of lignin? No, lignin is in plant cell walls, not bacterial.

So now, back to the first part. If the cell wall is removed, can the bacteria live? If the medium is isotonic, then yes. Because the cell won't experience osmotic pressure differences. Without a cell wall, the plasma membrane is the only barrier, and it can handle being in a solution that's the same concentration.

So the correct answer should be option A. Let me check option A again. It says the cell can live in isotonic, and cell walls are peptidoglycan versus plant's cellulose. Yes, that matches what I was thinking.

The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is equal to the bacterial protoplasm. This is because the plasma membrane alone can maintain the cell's integrity in the absence of the cell wall, provided there is no osmotic stress. The biochemical difference between bacterial and plant cell walls lies in their composition: bacterial cell walls are primarily made of peptidoglycan (a sugar-amino acid polymer), while plant cell walls are composed of cellulose (a polysaccharide). 

Option A correctly states this, as it aligns with the understanding that bacteria can survive without their cell walls in isotonic conditions and accurately describes the compositional difference between bacterial and plant cell walls.
