Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about factors that impact moral intensity. Hmm, I remember that moral intensity is a concept related to ethical decision-making. I think it refers to how strongly a situation is perceived as moral or ethical. The factors that influence this intensity are usually some specific elements.

The question is asking which three factors are correct. The options are A through J, each listing three terms. I need to figure out which three are the actual factors.

I recall that Jones proposed a model of moral intensity, which includes several components. Let me try to remember them. I think the factors are: social consensus, proximity, and temporal immediacy. Wait, but I might be mixing up some terms.

So, social consensus refers to the degree to which there's a shared understanding or agreement about what's right or wrong. If people widely agree that something is wrong, that would increase the moral intensity.

Proximity probably relates to how close the issue is to the person, either physically or emotionally. Like, if you see someone in distress right in front of you, that's more immediate than hearing about it happening far away.

Temporal immediacy, I think, is about the timing. If the consequences of an action are immediate rather than distant, the moral intensity is higher. So, if something bad is happening right now, it feels more urgent than something that might happen years later.

Wait, let me make sure. Are there other factors? I think there's also magnitude of consequences and concentration of effect, but those might not be part of this question. The question asks for three factors, so I'm confident the three I mentioned are the main ones.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one has social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity.

Looking through the options:

Option B: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. That matches exactly what I was thinking.

Option A has social dissensus, which is the opposite. So that's incorrect.

Option D says spatial immediacy instead of temporal. Spatial would relate to physical space, maybe like proximity, but I think the correct term is temporal.

Option E has cultural dissensus, which I don't think is one of the factors.

Option G has cultural consensus, which doesn't sound right either.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The question asks which three factors impact moral intensity. Moral intensity refers to the degree to which a situation is perceived as ethical or moral. Based on Jones' model, the key factors are social consensus, proximity, and temporal immediacy. 

- **Social consensus** refers to the extent of shared agreement about what is right or wrong.
- **Proximity** relates to how close the issue is to the individual, either physically or emotionally.
- **Temporal immediacy** concerns the timing of consequences, with immediate effects increasing moral intensity.

Among the options, only **Option B** correctly lists these three factors: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, and Proximity.

Answer: B
