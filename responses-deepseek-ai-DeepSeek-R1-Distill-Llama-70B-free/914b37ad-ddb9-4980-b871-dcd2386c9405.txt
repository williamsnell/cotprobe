Question:

A writer sent a four-page synopsis of an idea for a new television series to a Hollywood producer. He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work." She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?

Options:

A: The court will rule that there can be no contract as the writer didn't explicitly state his expectation for compensation for the idea itself.
B: The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.
C: The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.
D: The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.
E: The court will rule that there was a unilateral contract, with the producer obligated to pay only if he used the idea.
F: The court will rule that the writer's case is invalid as there was no written agreement.
G: The court will rule that the producer's assistant lacked the authority to form a contract, and thus, no contract exists.
H: There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.
I: The court will rule that the phone call between the writer and the producer's assistant formed a verbal contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it carefully.

The situation is: A writer sent a four-page synopsis for a TV series idea to a producer. He responded to an ad in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant on the phone and mentioned expecting compensation. The assistant said, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work." She said she'd discuss it with her boss. Months later, a casting call appears with a nearly identical plot and characters. The writer sued for breach of contract, and the producer says there was no contract.

The question is, what would the court likely rule?

The options are A through J. I need to think about contract formation. For a contract to exist, there must be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, sometimes contracts can be express or implied.

So the writer sent the synopsis in response to an ad. That could be considered an offer. The producer's assistant's statement about paying might indicate acceptance. But wait, the assistant said she'd go over it with her boss. So maybe the producer hasn't accepted yet.

But in contract terms, when someone submits an idea, there's the issue of whether there was an implied promise to pay if the idea is used. Sometimes courts look at the circumstances to see if there's an implied contract, like if a person submits an idea expecting payment, and the recipient knows that and uses the idea, it can imply a promise to pay.

In this case, the writer mentioned expecting compensation, and the assistant responded positively. So maybe there was an implied agreement that if the producer used the idea, they'd pay for it.

Looking at the options:

A: No contract because no explicit compensation for the idea. But the assistant said they always pay, so maybe it's implied.

B: Implied in fact contract based on conduct. That sounds possible because their actions (submitting idea, positive response) could imply a contract.

C: No consideration, treated as a gift. But the writer did expect compensation, so it's not a gift.

D: Express contract because of mutual assent. But did they have a clear agreement? The assistant didn't commit, just said she'd check with her boss.

E: Unilateral contract. I'm not sure. Unilateral is when one party makes an offer, and the other accepts by performance. Here, maybe the producer would have to pay if they used it, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

F: No written agreement. But contracts can be verbal unless the statute of frauds applies. Since it's for a TV series idea, I don't think the statute of frauds requires it to be written.

G: Assistant lacked authority. But if the assistant was acting within her role, maybe she had apparent authority. So the producer can't claim she wasn't authorized.

H: Too many terms missing, too indefinite. But courts can sometimes imply terms, especially in the context of the industry standards.

I: Verbal contract formed. That's possible, but depends on the court's view.

So, thinking about it, the key is whether there was an implied contract. The writer submitted the idea, the producer's assistant acknowledged that they pay for writers' work, which could imply that if they use it, they'll pay. So this might be an implied-in-fact contract based on their conduct. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but the assistant didn't accept the offer yet. She said she'd discuss with her boss. So was there an acceptance? Or was it just a continued negotiation?

In some cases, when a submission is made with the expectation of payment, and the company uses it, courts have found an implied contract. So even if the company didn't explicitly accept, the subsequent use can imply acceptance.

So the court would likely find an implied-in-fact contract based on the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.

The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.
