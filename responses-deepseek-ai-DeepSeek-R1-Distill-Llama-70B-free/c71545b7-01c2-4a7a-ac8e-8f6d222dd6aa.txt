Question:

What data support the theory that short-term memory is essentially auditory?

Options:

A: The theory is supported by the fact that people can remember music better than words.
B: Experiments that reveal short-term memory performs equally well with auditory, visual, and kinesthetic information.
C: Short-term memory does not involve auditory processes.
D: Findings that suggest short-term memory is linked primarily to tactile sensations and the ability to remember textures.
E: Studies indicating that individuals recall visual patterns with higher accuracy than auditory information.
F: Observations that people with better spatial awareness have superior short-term memory.
G: Short-term memory is visual.
H: Research demonstrating that short-term memory capacity is significantly increased when information is presented visually rather than auditorily.
I: Experiments showing auditory recoding in recall process and the detrimental effects of interruptions in rhythmic sequence on recall.
J: Evidence showing a correlation between short-term memory and olfactory senses.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about short-term memory and whether it's essentially auditory. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that there are different theories about how memory works, especially regarding the senses involved in short-term memory.

The question is asking which data supports the theory that short-term memory is mainly auditory. So I need to think about what I know about short-term memory. I recall something about the modal model of memory, which includes sensory memory, short-term (or working memory), and long-term. 

Wait, I think the idea that short-term memory is auditory comes from the concept of echoic memory, which is the brief storage of auditory information. But wait, isn't there also iconic memory for visual information? So maybe the theory isn't that it's only auditory, but that it's primarily processed through auditory means.

Oh right, there's the phonological loop in working memory, as per Baddeley's model. The phonological loop handles auditory and verbal information. So if someone is testing this, they might look at how auditory information is processed in short-term tasks.

Looking at the options now. Option I says experiments showing auditory recoding in the recall process and the effects of interruptions in rhythmic sequences on recall. That sounds familiar. Auditory recoding would mean that information is processed through hearing or speech. For example, when you repeat information to yourself, that's an auditory strategy. And if a rhythmic sequence is interrupted, it might affect how well you can recall the information, supporting the idea that auditory processing is key.

Option A talks about remembering music better than words. But I'm not sure if that's specific to short-term memory. Plus, maybe some people are better with music, but that's more about long-term memory perhaps.

Option B says experiments show equal performance across different senses, which would contradict the theory, so that's not supporting it.

Option C says short-term doesn't involve auditory, which is the opposite of the theory.

Options D, E, F, G, H, J all relate to other senses like tactile, visual, olfactory, etc., so they don't support the auditory theory.

So the correct answer should be I. It directly relates to auditory processes in short-term memory through recoding and the impact of interruptions, which would affect recall if the memory is auditory-based.

The theory that short-term memory is essentially auditory is supported by experiments demonstrating auditory recoding in the recall process and the detrimental effects of interruptions in rhythmic sequences on recall. This aligns with the concept of the phonological loop in working memory, which processes auditory and verbal information. 

The correct answer is:

I: Experiments showing auditory recoding in recall process and the detrimental effects of interruptions in rhythmic sequence on recall.

Answer: I
