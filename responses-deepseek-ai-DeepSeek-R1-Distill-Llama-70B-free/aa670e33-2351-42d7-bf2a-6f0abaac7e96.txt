Okay, I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which molecule has an octet around the central atom. Hmm, the options are A through E, each with different compounds. Let me think step by step.

So, the question is about the octet rule. The octet rule says that atoms tend to have eight electrons in their outer shell, which makes them stable. For main-group elements, this usually means they'll form bonds to reach that octet. But sometimes, some elements might have less than eight, especially if they're in a different group or if the structure is different.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: BF3. Boron is in group 3, so it has three valence electrons. Fluorine has seven, so each F needs one electron to complete its octet. So, BF3 has B as the central atom. Each F forms a single bond with B. So, B has three bonds, each contributing two electrons (since each bond is two electrons). Wait, no, each bond contributes two electrons, but each bond is counted for both atoms. So for B, each single bond gives it two electrons. So three bonds would be 3 * 2 = 6 electrons around B. Boron has three valence electrons, so 3 + 3*(1 from each F in the bond) = 6. Oh wait, no, the structure of BF3 is trigonal planar. Boron has three bonds, each single. Each bond contributes two electrons, but for the octet, it's the number of electrons around the central atom. So B has three single bonds, which is 6 electrons. So it has only six electrons, not eight. So BF3 doesn't have an octet around the central atom. So option A is out.

Option B: BeF2. Beryllium is in group 2, so it has two valence electrons. Fluorine again has seven. So each F needs one electron. Be forms two single bonds, each with F. So each bond contributes two electrons to Be. So two bonds would be 4 electrons. Be has two valence electrons, so 2 + 4 = 6 electrons around Be. So again, only six, not eight. So BeF2's central atom doesn't have an octet. So option B is also not correct.

Option C: PF5. Phosphorus is in group 15, so it has five valence electrons. Fluorine has seven, so each F needs one. PF5 has P as the central atom with five F atoms attached. Each F forms a single bond. Each single bond contributes two electrons to P. So five bonds would give 5 * 2 = 10 electrons. But wait, phosphorus can expand its octet because it's in the third period and can use d orbitals. So having 10 electrons would be more than an octet. Wait, but the question is about having an octet. Alternatively, maybe the structure has some double bonds. Let me think: PF5. The Lewis structure. Phosphorus has five valence electrons. Each F has seven, so each needs one more. So each forms a single bond. So how many electrons around P? Each single bond contributes two electrons, so 5 * 2 =10. But wait, 10 is more than 8. So in this case, the central atom has 10 electrons. So PF5's P has an expanded octet, not a regular octet. But the question is about having an octet. So I think whether it's exactly eight or more than eight is the key. The question is which has an octet, so PF5's P has more than eight. So option C is not correct.

Option D: NH4+. Nitrogen is in group 15, has five valence electrons. In NH4+, each H contributes one electron. So four H atoms contribute four electrons. So total around N is 5 (N's) + 4 (from H) = 9? Wait, but wait: when you form bonds, each single bond is two electrons. So N is bonded to four H atoms, so four single bonds. Each bond contributes two electrons, so 4 * 2 =8 electrons around N. Plus, N's original valence electrons? Wait, no, the counting is that each bond contributes to the count. So for the octet, the central atom's valence electrons plus the bonds' electrons should equal eight (or more in expanded cases). Let me recount: N has five valence electrons. Each H provides one electron (since H has one), so each single bond is two electrons. So four single bonds mean 4 * 2 =8 electrons from bonds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when N forms a single bond with each H, each bond contributes two electrons, but how does that add to N's octet? Let me think about the Lewis structure. N has five valence electrons. Each H has one. So in NH4+, the structure is N with four single bonds. So the total electrons around N would be 4*2=8. So N has an octet. So that's correct. So option D would be correct.

Option E: SF6. Sulfur is in group 16, so six valence electrons. Each F has seven, so each needs one. So six F atoms. Each forms a single bond with S. Each single bond contributes two electrons, so 6 * 2 =12 electrons around S. But wait, sulfur is in the third period, so it can have an expanded octet. So it's more than eight, so it's not an octet. So E is out.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The question is which has an octet around the central atom. So for each option:

A: BF3 → 6 electrons → no.
B: BeF2 → 6 → no.
C: PF5 → 10 → no.
D: NH4+ →8 → yes.
E: SF6 →12 → no.

So only option D has eight electrons. So the answer is D.

To determine which molecule has an octet of electrons around the central atom, we analyze each option based on the octet rule, which states that atoms tend to have eight electrons in their outer shell for stability. Here's the analysis:

- **Option A: BF₃**  
  Boron (group 3) has three valence electrons. Each fluorine forms a single bond with boron, contributing two electrons per bond. With three bonds, boron has 3 × 2 = 6 electrons around it. This is less than an octet, so BF₃ does not satisfy the octet rule.

- **Option B: BeF₂**  
  Beryllium (group 2) has two valence electrons. Each fluorine forms a single bond with beryllium, contributing two electrons per bond. With two bonds, beryllium has 2 × 2 = 4 electrons around it. Adding its two valence electrons gives a total of 6 electrons, which is less than an octet. Thus, BeF₂ does not satisfy the octet rule.

- **Option C: PF₅**  
  Phosphorus (group 15) has five valence electrons. Each fluorine forms a single bond with phosphorus, contributing two electrons per bond. With five bonds, phosphorus has 5 × 2 = 10 electrons around it. This exceeds an octet, as phosphorus can expand its octet due to its ability to use d orbitals. Therefore, PF₅ does not have a standard octet.

- **Option D: NH₄⁺**  
  Nitrogen (group 15) has five valence electrons. Each hydrogen forms a single bond with nitrogen, contributing two electrons per bond. With four bonds, nitrogen has 4 × 2 = 8 electrons around it. This satisfies the octet rule, making NH₄⁺ the correct answer.

- **Option E: SF₆**  
  Sulfur (group 16) has six valence electrons. Each fluorine forms a single bond with sulfur, contributing two electrons per bond. With six bonds, sulfur has 6 × 2 = 12 electrons around it. This exceeds an octet, as sulfur can also expand its octet. Thus, SF₆ does not have a standard octet.

The only molecule where the central atom has exactly eight electrons is **NH₄⁺**.
