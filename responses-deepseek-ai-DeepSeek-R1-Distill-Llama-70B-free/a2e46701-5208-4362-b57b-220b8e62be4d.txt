Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about World War II and psychological concepts. Hmm, the question is about why millions of Jews and other minorities were slaughtered because they were blamed for Germany's problems. The question is asking what psychological concept this illustrates.

Let me think. I remember that scapegoating is when a group is blamed for the problems of others. So, in this context, the Nazis blamed Jews for Germany's financial and social issues. But the question is about which defense mechanism this is.

Wait, the options are A through J. The choices are things like sour grapes, sweet lemons, sublimation, rationalization, projection, reaction formation, repression, denial, regression, displacement.

I think I need to recall the definitions of each defense mechanism to figure this out. Let's go through them.

Sour grapes rationalization is when someone despises something they can't have. Like if you can't get a job, you say it's not a good job anyway. But this doesn't fit the scenario here.

Sweet lemons rationalization is the opposite, I think. Making the best of a bad situation. Not relevant here.

Sublimation is channeling unacceptable impulses into more acceptable behaviors, like art or sports. Doesn't fit with blaming others.

Rationalization is making excuses or justifying behavior with logical reasons, but not the same as blaming others.

Projection is when you attribute your own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. Like if you dislike someone and think they dislike you. So the Nazis might have projected their own faults onto the Jews. But wait, is that exactly what happened? Or is it more about displacing anger?

Wait, displacement is redirecting emotional reactions from the original source to a safer or more acceptable one. Like if you're mad at your boss, you yell at your spouse. So in this case, the Germans were upset about their economic situation, and instead of blaming their leaders or the system, they blamed Jews. That sounds like displacement because they're redirecting their frustration towards a different target.

Projection, on the other hand, is more about attributing one's own feelings to others. Like if someone hates Jews because they think Jews hate them, which might be a form of projection, but I'm not sure if that's the main concept here.

So the question is whether the example is projection or displacement. Scapegoating often involves displacement because the target is a substitute for the real cause of the frustration. The real cause might be something else, like political or economic issues, but the anger is directed at a minority group.

So putting it all together, the slaughter of Jews was because they were blamed for problems they didn't cause. That's displacement of aggression from the real source (maybe the government or economic systems) to an innocent group.

Wait, but another angle is that they might have been using projection. Like, the Nazis had their own issues, and they projected their faults onto the Jews. For example, accusing Jews of controlling banks when maybe the Nazis themselves were responsible for economic issues. But I'm not certain if that's the main mechanism here.

Alternatively, displacement is about redirecting the emotions. The Germans were frustrated with their situation, so they displaced that anger onto Jews, making them the scapegoats.

I think the correct term here is displacement, which is option J.

The question involves identifying the psychological concept illustrated by the scapegoating of Jews and minorities during World War II, where they were blamed for Germany's financial and social problems. Scapegoating in this context involves redirecting frustration and anger toward an innocent group rather than addressing the actual causes of the issues. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Sour grapes** and **sweet lemons** rationalization are about coping with unattainable desires or making the best of bad situations, which are irrelevant here.
- **Sublimation** involves channeling unacceptable impulses into positive behaviors, which doesn't fit.
- **Rationalization** is about justifying actions with logical excuses, which isn't the focus here.
- **Projection** involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to others, which could apply but isn't the primary mechanism.
- **Displacement** is about redirecting emotions from the original source to a safer target, which aligns with blaming Jews for broader societal issues.

The correct concept is **displacement**, as the Nazis redirected their frustration with economic and social problems onto a scapegoat group.
