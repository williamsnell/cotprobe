Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as it applies to merchants. Hmm, I remember that when two merchants are dealing with each other, there are specific rules about how additional terms in an acceptance are handled. Let me try to break this down.

The question is asking which statement is not true about additional terms proposed in the acceptance between merchants. The options are A through J. I think I need to recall what the UCC says about this. From what I remember, under the UCC, when a merchant offers to buy goods and another merchant accepts, any additional terms in the acceptance can become part of the contract even if they weren't in the original offer. But wait, there are exceptions to that.

So, I think the key point is that if the additional terms are proposed in the acceptance by a merchant, they become part of the contract unless certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that the additional terms would materially alter the contract. If they do, then they don't become part of it unless the offeror (the one who made the offer) agrees. Another condition is if the offeror objects within a reasonable time. Also, if the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer, then the additional terms wouldn't be included.

Wait, but I also remember that if both parties are merchants, additional terms are more likely to be included unless they fall into one of those exceptions. So the general rule is that additional terms become part of the contract unless they're objectionable in one of those specified ways.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: They become part of the contract only if both parties are merchants. Wait, no. Because I think that when both are merchants, the additional terms do get in under certain conditions. But maybe if one isn't a merchant, the common law applies, which is more strict. But the question is about transactions between merchants, so maybe the option is correct in that context? Hmm, maybe not. Because the UCC rule about additional terms applies when both are merchants, but the option says it's only part of the contract if both are merchants, which might be true, but I'm not sure if that's the correct statement here.

Option B: They become part of the contract only if the offeree doesn't object within a reasonable time. That sounds familiar. Because if the offeree (the one who received the offer) objects timely, the terms don't become part. So this is a condition under which they do become part, so B is a correct statement. So the question is which is not true, so B is true, so it's not the answer.

Option C: They become part only if the offeree agrees within a reasonable time. Wait, but I thought it's about objection, not agreement. Because under UCC, the offeree doesn't have to agree; if they don't object, the terms become part. So this option is saying the terms are included only if the offeree agrees, but I think that's not correct. Because the UCC doesn't require the offeree to agree; silence can be acceptance. So C is not correct, so it's a possible answer.

Option D: Additional terms always become part. No, because as I thought earlier, there are exceptionsâ€”like if they materially alter the contract or the offeror objects. So D is false, which could make it the answer.

Option E: Only if in writing. I think that's not the case. The UCC doesn't require the additional terms to be in writing; they can be oral. So E is not true, which might be the answer.

Option F: They become part unless they materially alter the agreement. Yes, that's correct. So F is a true statement, so it's not the answer.

Option G: Only if the offeror sends written confirmation. I'm not sure about this. Wait, no, I think under the UCC, the offeror (the one who made the offer) doesn't have to send a written confirmation. The additional terms can become part unless the offeree objects. So G is not true, making it a possible answer.

Option H: They never become part. That's incorrect because the UCC says they can become part under certain conditions. So H is false, so it's a possible answer.

Option I: They become part unless the offer expressly limits. Yes, that's correct. So I is a true statement, not the answer.

Option J: They become part unless the offeror objects within reasonable time. Yes, that's correct. Because if the offeror objects timely, the terms don't become part. So J is true, not the answer.

Now, the question is which option is not true. So let's look back.

The question is about what is NOT true. So which of these is a false statement.

Option D says additional terms always become part. But that's not true because there are exceptions (material alteration, timely objection). So D is false.

Option E says they become part only if in writing. That's not true because the terms can be oral. So E is false.

Option C says the offeree must agree within a reasonable time. But under UCC, the offeree doesn't have to agree; they just have to not object. So C is false.

Similarly, G says offeror must send written confirmation, which isn't required. So G is false.

So the question is which option is not true about additional terms proposed in the acceptance.

Wait, the question is about what's not true. So the correct answer would be a statement that is false.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is which one is not true.

The correct answer should be the statement that is false regarding the inclusion of additional terms.

Let me think about UCC 2-207. So under 2-207, additional terms become part of the contract unless:

1. The offer expressly limits acceptance to its terms.

2. The additional terms would materially alter the contract.

3. The offeror objects within a reasonable time.

If the additional terms are proposed in the acceptance by a merchant, these are the exceptions.

So, looking at each option:

Option B: They become part only if offeree doesn't object. But wait, the offeree is the one who receives the offer; in this context, the offeree is the one who sends the acceptance. So the additional terms are in the acceptance. The offeror (the party who made the offer) can object. So in Option B, it's the offeree (who is the one accepting) not objecting. That might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify:

In the context of 2-207, when the offeror sends an offer, and the offeree responds with an acceptance that includes additional terms, those terms can become part unless the offeror (the original offeror) objects.

So Option B says the terms become part only if the offeree (the one who sent the acceptance) doesn't object. That doesn't make sense because it's the offeror (the original offeror) who would object. So perhaps Option B is incorrect because it's the wrong party.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The offeror is the party making the offer, and the offeree is the party to whom the offer is made. When the offeree sends an acceptance with additional terms, under 2-207, those terms become part unless:

- The offeror (the original offeror) has limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.

- The additional terms are a material alteration.

- The offeror objects within reasonable time.

So the offeree in this context is the one sending the acceptance. So, if the option is talking about the offeree (the one sending the acceptance) not objecting, that's not relevant. Because the offeree is the one proposing the terms, so they wouldn't object. The one who can object is the offeror.

So Option B says the terms become part only if the offeree doesn't object. But that's wrong because it's the offeror who can object, not the offeree. So Option B is incorrect.

Wait, but in the options, Option B refers to the offeree not objecting. Since the offeree is the one who proposed the terms, they wouldn't object. So the correct condition is that the offeror doesn't object. So Option B is incorrect because it's the wrong party. So the statement in B is not true, meaning B is a false statement.

But wait, the question is about what is NOT true. So I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Let's list each option and evaluate whether it's true or false.

Option A: They become part only if both are merchants. Under UCC 2-207, the rule applies when both are merchants, so if one isn't, the common law applies (additional terms are treated as proposals and don't become part unless accepted). So A is true because the additional terms become part only when both are merchants. So A is a correct statement, so it's not the answer.

Option B: Only if the offeree doesn't object. But the offeree is the one sending the acceptance, so the one who can object is the offeror. So B is incorrect because it's the wrong party. So B is a false statement.

Option C: Only if offeree agrees within reasonable time. But under 2-207, the offeree (the party sending the acceptance) doesn't need to agree; their additional terms are included unless the offeror objects. So C is incorrect because it's saying the terms are included only if the offeree agrees, which is not required. So C is false.

Option D: Additional terms always become part. No, because of exceptions (material alteration, timely objection). So D is false.

Option E: Only if in writing. No, they can be oral. So E is false.

Option F: Unless they materially alter. Correct. So F is true.

Option G: Only if offeror sends written confirmation. No, written confirmation isn't required. So G is false.

Option H: They never become part. No, because sometimes they do. So H is false.

Option I: Unless offer expressly limits. Correct. So I is true.

Option J: Unless offeror objects within reasonable time. Correct. So J is true.

So the question is which option is not true. So the false statements are B, C, D, E, G, H.

The question is asking which is NOT true, so which option is false.

Now, looking back at the original question: "what is not true about additional terms proposed in the acceptance?"

So all the false options are possible answers. Wait, but the options are all about what's not true, so the correct answer is the statement that is false.

So, the question is to pick the false statement.

Wait, let me re-read the question. "In transactions between merchants, what is not true about additional terms proposed in the acceptance?"

So, the correct answer is the statement that is false regarding additional terms in the acceptance when both parties are merchants.

Now, considering UCC 2-207(2), it says that between merchants, additional terms become part of the contract unless they materially alter it, or the offeror objects, etc.

So, the false statements would be those that contradict this.

Looking again:

Option D says "Additional terms always become part of the contract." But that's not true because sometimes they don't, like when the offeror objects. So D is false.

Option E says "only if in writing." But 2-207 doesn't require writing, so E is false.

Option C says "only if offeree agrees within reasonable time." No, because the offeree doesn't have to agree; the terms are included unless the offeror objects. So C is false.

Option G says "only if offeror sends written confirmation within reasonable time." No, written confirmation isn't required. So G is false.

Option B is about the offeree not objecting, which is incorrect because it's the offeror who can object. So B is false.

So, multiple options are false. But the question is a multiple-choice, so only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the most direct answer.

The question is about what's not true. So which statement is incorrect.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is likely D, because it says additional terms always become part, which is false. Alternatively, E is false because they don't need to be in writing.

Wait, but which option is the correct answer to the question? The question is about which statement is not true.

Another approach is to recall that under UCC 2-207, additional terms proposed in the acceptance by a merchant will become part of the contract unless:

1. The offer is limited to its own terms.

2. The terms would materially alter the contract.

3. The offeror (the party who made the offer) objects within a reasonable time.

So any statement that says the terms become part of the contract without considering these exceptions would be false.

Looking at the options:

Option F: They become part unless they materially alter. This is correct, so it's not the answer.

Option I: They become part unless the offer limits. Correct, so not the answer.

Option J: They become part unless the offeror objects. Correct, so not the answer.

So, the false statements are options that don't include these exceptions.

Option D: Additional terms always become part. This is false because sometimes they don't, as per the exceptions.

Option E: Only if in writing. False, because 2-207 doesn't require writing.

Option C: Only if offeree (the accepting party) agrees. No, the offeree doesn't have to agree; the terms are in their acceptance. So C is incorrect.

Option B: Only if offeree (accepting party) doesn't object. No, because it's the offeror who can object, not the offeree.

So which of these is the correct answer to the question.

The question is asking which is NOT true, so which statement is false.

Looking at the options provided, the question is about what is not true. So I need to pick the false statement about the additional terms.

I think the correct answer is D: Additional terms always become part of the contract. Because this is not true; sometimes they don't. So D is false.

But wait, let's make sure. Another possibility is E.

Option E: They become part only if the additional terms are in writing. But under 2-207, the additional terms can be oral, so E is false.

Similarly, option C is false because it's about the offeree agreeing, which isn't necessary.

But the question is about which statement is not true. So which of the options is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because the terms don't need to be in writing.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the UCC, the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, but 2-207 deals with the inclusion of additional terms regardless of whether they're written or oral. So E is false because the terms don't have to be in writing.

Similarly, D is false because the terms don't always become part.

So which of the options is the correct answer.

Looking back at the options, the question is multiple-choice, and the options are:

Options are A through J.

The question is about which statement is not true.

I think the correct answer is D: Additional terms always become part of the contract. Because this is incorrect; they don't always become part. So D is the false statement, making it the correct answer to the question.

But I'm also considering that option E is false, but perhaps it's a trick. No, because the UCC doesn't require the terms to be in writing. So E is definitely false.

Wait, but the question is about what is NOT true. So the correct answer would be any of the false statements. But the options only allow one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the other options have more nuanced reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the original options. Looking at the options again:

Option D: Additional terms always become part of the contract.

Option E: They become part only if the additional terms are in writing.

Which is not true.

I think D is a more direct answer because it's a clear overstatement. They don't always become part; sometimes they don't. So D is not true, making it the correct answer.

Alternatively, E is also not true, but perhaps the question is more about the general inclusion of terms, making D the better answer.

Wait, but the options are not mutually exclusive. The question is about which is not true. So perhaps the answer is D.

Alternatively, let's think about what each option is testing.

Option D says the terms always become part, which is false. So D is incorrect.

Option E says they become part only if in writing, which is also false.

But which option is the correct answer to the question.

Wait, perhaps I should check what each option is saying.

The correct answer is the statement that is not true. So, if an option presents a condition that is not required, then it's not true.

Option E says that the terms become part only if written. But under UCC, the terms can be oral. So E is false.

Option D says the terms always become part, which is false.

So both D and E are false. But the question is a multiple-choice, so only one answer is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, as it's a more direct statement about the terms always being included, which is a common misconception.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, because it's a specific condition that is not required.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about which of these is more clearly incorrect.

In UCC 2-207, the additional terms don't have to be in writing. So E is definitely false.

Similarly, D is false because it's an overstatement.

But the question is about which is not true.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D.

Alternatively, I might have to make a choice based on the options given. Since the question is about what's not true, and D is a clear overstatement, I think the answer is D.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, in the original question, the options are:

A: Only if both merchants.

B: Only if offeree doesn't object.

C: Only if offeree agrees.

D: Always become part.

E: Only if in writing.

F: Unless material alteration.

G: Only if offeror sends written confirmation.

H: Never become part.

I: Unless offer limits.

J: Unless offeror objects.

So, the correct answer is the statement that is not true, i.e., the false statement.

So, which options are false?

Option D: Always included? No.

Option E: Only if written? No.

Option C: Only if offeree agrees? No, because the offeree is the one sending the terms; they don't need to agree again.

Option B: Only if offeree doesn't object. No, it's the offeror who can object.

Option G: Only if offeror sends written confirmation. No, not required.

So, all these are false. But the question is which is not true, so the
