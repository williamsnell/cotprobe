Question:

Discuss the role of attitudes and expectancy in attention.

Options:

A: Attitudes and expectancy are only relevant in the initial stages of attention.
B: Attitudes and expectancy only affect long-term memory.
C: Attitudes and expectancy alter the intensity of stimuli required to capture attention.
D: Attitudes and expectancy only affect attention during high-stress situations.
E: Attitudes and expectancy affect attention by increasing the speed of cognitive processing for all types of information.
F: Attitudes and expectancy only influence our perception of size and duration.
G: Attitudes and expectancy change the sensory modalities we pay attention to.
H: Attitudes and expectancy guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.
I: Attitudes and expectancy primarily determine the accuracy of our visual attention.
J: Attitudes and expectancy have no effect on attention.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question about the role of attitudes and expectancy in attention. Hmm, I remember that attention is about how we focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others. But how do attitudes and expectancy play into that?

Wait, I think attitudes are like our evaluations or feelings towards something. So if I like something, I might pay more attention to it. And expectancy is about what we expect to happen, right? Like when we anticipate something, we're more likely to notice it.

So in the context of attention, maybe these factors influence what we pay attention to. I remember something about selective attention, where we choose what to focus on based on our interests or expectations. So if I expect to see something, like a friend at a party, I might be more attentive to anything that resembles them.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A says they're only relevant initially. That doesn't sound right because attention is an ongoing process. B says they only affect long-term memory, but the question is about attention, not memory. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says they alter the intensity needed to capture attention. Hmm, maybe. Like if I expect a phone call, even a faint ring might catch my attention. So lower intensity could be enough. That makes sense, but I'm not sure if that's the primary effect.

Option D limits it to high-stress situations. I don't think that's correct because attention is influenced in various conditions, not just stressful ones.

Option E suggests they speed up cognitive processing for all information. I don't think so because if we're focused on specific things, other information might be processed more slowly or ignored.

Option F talks about perception of size and duration. That sounds more related to how we perceive stimuli, not so much about what we attend to.

Option G says they change sensory modalities. Like maybe focusing on hearing vs. sight, but I'm not sure if that's the main role here.

Option H states that they guide focus by making relevant info stand out and excluding others. That sounds familiar. Like when you're interested in a topic, you pay attention to related stuff and tune out the rest. So attitudes (interest) and expectancy (anticipation) both make certain things more salient.

Option I is about accuracy of visual attention. I don't recall that as a primary function. It's more about what we focus on, not necessarily how accurate it is.

Option J claims no effect, which I know isn't true because there's plenty of research showing these factors influence attention.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is likely H. It explains how attitudes and expectancy help highlight relevant information and filter out the irrelevant stuff, which aligns with what I remember about selective attention.

The correct answer is:

H: Attitudes and expectancy guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.

This option accurately captures how attitudes (our evaluations or feelings toward stimuli) and expectancy (our anticipation of events) influence attention by highlighting relevant information and filtering out irrelevant details, a key aspect of selective attention.

Answer: H
