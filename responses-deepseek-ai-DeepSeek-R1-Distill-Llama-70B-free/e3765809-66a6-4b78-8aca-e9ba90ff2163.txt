Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that an impure sample of aluminum sulfate is analyzed by forming a precipitate of barium sulfate. They added excess BaCl2 to ensure complete precipitation. After washing and drying, they got 2.000 grams of BaSO4. The original sample weighed 1.000 grams. I need to find the percentage of aluminum sulfate in the sample.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when you have compounds reacting, you can use stoichiometry to find out the masses involved. The reaction here is between aluminum sulfate and barium chloride. Let me think about the chemical equation.

Aluminum sulfate is Al2(SO4)3. When it reacts with BaCl2, which is in excess, the products should be BaSO4 and AlCl3. So the reaction is:

Al2(SO4)3 + 3 BaCl2 → 2 AlCl3 + 3 BaSO4

Wait, does that balance? Let me check. On the left, there are 2 Al, 3 S, 12 O (from sulfate) and 3 Ba, 6 Cl. On the right, 2 Al, 3 Ba, 3 S, and then the O and Cl in AlCl3 and BaSO4. Yeah, that seems balanced. Each BaSO4 has one Ba and one SO4.

So the key here is that each mole of Al2(SO4)3 produces 3 moles of BaSO4. Or wait, looking at the equation, each mole of Al2(SO4)3 produces 3 moles of BaSO4. So the mole ratio is 1:3.

Now, I have 2.000 grams of BaSO4. I need to find how many moles that is. The molar mass of BaSO4 will be the molar masses of Ba, S, and O4. Ba is about 137.33 g/mol, S is 32.07, and O is 16. So 137.33 + 32.07 + (4*16)= 137.33+32.07=169.4, plus 64 is 233.4 g/mol. Wait, wait, let me calculate that again.

Ba: 137.33
S: 32.07
O4: 16 *4 = 64
Total: 137.33 +32.07 = 169.4 +64 = 233.4 g/mol.

So moles of BaSO4 = mass/molar mass = 2.000 g / 233.4 g/mol. Let me compute that. 2/233.4 is approximately 0.00856 moles.

Wait, 233.4 times 0.00856 equals approximately 2. So that's correct.

Since the reaction produces 3 moles of BaSO4 for each mole of Al2(SO4)3, the moles of Al2(SO4)3 are moles BaSO4 divided by 3.

So moles of Al2(SO4)3 = 0.00856 /3 ≈ 0.002853 mol.

Now, I need to find the mass of Al2(SO4)3 corresponding to that. The molar mass of Al2(SO4)3: Al is about 26.98 g/mol, so 2*26.98 = 53.96. S is 32.07, O4 is 64, but wait, each sulfate is SO4^2-, and there are 3 of them, so 3*(32.07 + 64) = 3*(96.07) = 288.21.

Wait wait, no, Al2(SO4)3 has 2 Al, 3 S, and 12 O (since each sulfate has four O and there are three sulfates, 3*4=12). So molar mass calculation:

Al: 2 * 26.98 = 53.96
S: 3 * 32.07 = 96.21
O: 12 * 16 = 192
Adding them up: 53.96 +96.21 = 150.17 +192= 342.17 g/mol.

So moles of Al2(SO4)3 are 0.002853 mol. Mass is moles * molar mass = 0.002853 * 342.17 g/mol.

Let me calculate this. 0.002853 * 342.17. Hmm, 0.0028 * 342 is about 0.956, but let's be more precise.

0.002853 * 342.17 = ?

Well, 342.17 * 0.002 = 0.68434
0.000853 * 342.17: Let's compute 0.0008 *342.17 = 0.273736, and 0.000053 *342.17≈ 0.01814. So 0.273736 +0.01814=0.291876. So total is 0.68434 +0.291876= 0.976216 grams.

Wait, wait, 0.002853 * 342.17 = let's compute 342.17 * 0.002 = 0.68434. Then 342.17 * 0.000853.

Wait, 0.0008 *342.17= 0.273736, 0.000053 *342.17 = approx 0.01814. So 0.273736 +0.01814= 0.291876. So total is 0.68434 +0.291876= 0.976216 grams.

So the mass of Al2(SO4)3 in the original sample is approximately 0.9762 grams.

Wait wait, but the original sample was 1.000 grams. So the percent is (mass of Al2(SO4)3 / sample mass) *100. So (0.9762 /1.000)*100 = 97.62%.

Looking at the options, option D is 97.8%, which is close. Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, I'll redo the BaSO4 moles more accurately. BaSO4 molar mass is 137.33 +32.07 + (16*4)= 137.33+32.07=169.4 +64=233.4 g/mol.

Molar mass of Al2(SO4)3: 2*(26.98) = 53.96, 3*(32.07 +16*4) =3*(32.07+64)=3*(96.07)=288.21. 53.96 +288.21=342.17 g/mol.

Moles of BaSO4: 2.000g /233.4 g/mol = let's compute that precisely.

233.4 is 233.4, 2/233.4=0.00856... 

So moles BaSO4 = 0.00856 moles.

Moles of Al2(SO4)3 = 0.00856 /3 = 0.0028533... mol.

Mass of Al2(SO4)3: 0.0028533 *342.17 = let me compute this accurately.

342.17 * 0.0028533.

Compute 342.17 * 0.002 = 0.68434

342.17 * 0.0008 = 0.273736

342.17 * 0.0000533 = let's calculate 0.00005 *342.17=0.0171085, 0.0000033 *342.17≈0.001129.

So 0.0171085 +0.001129≈0.0182375.

Adding it all: 0.68434 +0.273736 = 0.958076, plus 0.0182375 gives 0.9763135 grams.

So 0.9763 grams of Al2(SO4)3 in a 1.000 gram sample gives a percentage of 97.63%, which is approximately 97.6%. Looking at the options, option D is 97.8%, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a slight mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles more precisely.

Let me recompute the moles of BaSO4.

2.000 /233.4 = let's use exact division.

233.4 is 2334/10, so 2/(2334/10) )= 20/2334 = 10/1167 ≈0.00856 moles.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 2.000 /233.4:

233.4 × 0.00856 = 2.000?

Wait 233.4 * 0.008 = 1.8672; 233.4 *0.0005 =0.1167. So 0.0085 would be 233.4*(0.008+0.0005)= 1.8672 +0.1167=1.9839. But 2.000 is 0.0161 more. So 0.0161 /233.4 = approx 0.0000689. So total moles would be 0.0085 +0.0000689≈0.0085689.

So moles of BaSO4 is approximately 0.0085689.

So moles of Al2(SO4)3 is 0.0085689 /3 = 0.0028563 mol.

Now, the molar mass of Al2(SO4)3 is 342.17 g/mol as before.

So mass is 0.0028563 *342.17 = let's calculate this.

0.0028563 *300=0.85689

0.0028563 *42.17= Let's compute 0.0028563 *40=0.114252; 0.0028563*2.17=approx 0.006195.

So 0.114252 +0.006195=0.120447.

Adding to 0.85689: 0.85689 +0.120447=0.977337 grams.

So that's approximately 0.9773 grams. So the percentage is (0.9773 /1.000)*100=97.73%.

Hmm, that's about 97.7%. The options are A:75.4, B:84.3, C:66.7, D:97.8, E:2.2, F:10.5, G:100, H:56.1, I:42.9, J:89.5.

So 97.7 is closest to option D, 97.8%. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but did I make any error in the stoichiometry? Let me check the reaction again.

The reaction is Al2(SO4)3 + 3 BaCl2 → 2 AlCl3 + 3 BaSO4. So yes, 1 mole of Al2(SO4)3 gives 3 moles of BaSO4. So the ratio is correct.

Another way to approach this is using the formula for percentage. The formula would be:

% Al2(SO4)3 = [ (mass BaSO4 / molar mass BaSO4) * (molar mass Al2(SO4)3 /3) ] / sample mass *100.

So substituting the numbers:

(2.000 g / 233.4 g/mol) * (342.17 g/mol /3) /1.000 g *100.

Which is (2/233.4) * (342.17/3) *100.

Compute 2/233.4 ≈0.00856.

342.17/3≈114.057.

Multiply 0.00856 *114.057: 0.00856 *100=0.856; 0.00856 *14.057≈0.1204. So total ≈0.856 +0.1204=0.9764. Multiply by 100 gives 97.64%. So again, approximately 97.6%, which is very close to option D, 97.8%. I think the slight discrepancy is due to rounding during calculations. So D is the correct answer.

To determine the percentage of aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃) in the sample, we use stoichiometry based on the reaction:

\[
\text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 + 3 \text{BaCl}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{AlCl}_3 + 3 \text{BaSO}_4
\]

From the reaction, 1 mole of Al₂(SO₄)₃ produces 3 moles of BaSO₄. The steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Calculate the molar mass of BaSO₄**:  
   \[
   \text{Ba: } 137.33 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{S: } 32.07 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{O}_4: 16 \times 4 = 64 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of BaSO}_4 = 137.33 + 32.07 + 64 = 233.4 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

2. **Determine the moles of BaSO₄**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of BaSO}_4 = \frac{\text{Mass of BaSO}_4}{\text{Molar mass of BaSO}_4} = \frac{2.000 \, \text{g}}{233.4 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00856 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate the moles of Al₂(SO₄)₃**:  
   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Al₂(SO₄)₃ produces 3 moles of BaSO₄. Therefore:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = \frac{\text{Moles of BaSO}_4}{3} = \frac{0.00856}{3} \approx 0.002853 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Calculate the molar mass of Al₂(SO₄)₃**:  
   \[
   \text{Al: } 2 \times 26.98 = 53.96 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{S: } 3 \times 32.07 = 96.21 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{O}_{12}: 12 \times 16 = 192 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = 53.96 + 96.21 + 192 = 342.17 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

5. **Calculate the mass of Al₂(SO₄)₃**:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = \text{Moles of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 \times \text{Molar mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = 0.002853 \, \text{mol} \times 342.17 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 0.9773 \, \text{g}
   \]

6. **Calculate the percentage of Al₂(SO₄)₃ in the sample**:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3}{\text{Mass of sample}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = \left( \frac{0.9773 \, \text{g}}{1.000 \, \text{g}} \right) \times 100 \approx 97.7\%
   \]

7. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest option to 97.7% is **97.8%**, which corresponds to **option D**.

**Answer: D**
