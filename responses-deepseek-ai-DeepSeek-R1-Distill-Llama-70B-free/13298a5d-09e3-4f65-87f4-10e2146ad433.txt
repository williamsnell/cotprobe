Question:

A mother has an 11-year-old daughter. The mother is legally separated from her husband and has filed for divorce. The mother and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother went out to dinner and left her daughter at home. Upon leaving the house, the mother locked the door to her bedroom. While the mother was gone, the daughter found a spare key to her mother's bedroom and opened the door. While rummaging through her mother's dresser, she found a bag containing white powder. Concerned that the bag might contain drugs, the daughter called her father to ask his advice. The husband instructed her to call the police. The daughter then telephoned the police station and reported what she had found. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to her home. The daughter allowed the police to come inside and led them to her mother's bedroom. She gave the officers the bag, which they took to the station house for a lab test. After the results confirmed that the bag contained cocaine, the mother was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The mother's attorney has filed a motion to prevent the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the daughter, and husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.
B: denied, because the police were acting on the daughter's concern for her mother's wellbeing.
C: denied, because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.
D: denied, because the daughter had a reasonable concern for her mother's safety.
E: denied, because the cocaine was found in a common area of the home, not a private space.
F: granted, because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.
G: granted, because the husband did not physically give consent for the police to enter the home.

Okay, so I've got this law question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's a criminal procedure question, probably dealing with the Fourth Amendment and the admissibility of evidence. The scenario involves a mother, her daughter, and some police activity.

Alright, let me read through the question again carefully. So, the mother is legally separated from her husband, and they're getting a divorce. They own their home as joint tenants. One night, the mother goes out, locks her bedroom door, and the daughter finds a spare key, enters the bedroom, finds a bag of white powder, thinks it's drugs, calls her dad, who tells her to call the police. The daughter then calls the cops, lets them in, gives them the bag, which turns out to be cocaine. Now the mother is charged, and her attorney is trying to suppress the evidence.

The question is about whether the motion to suppress should be granted or denied. So the options are from A to J, but the choices given are A through G.

I need to figure out if the police entry and seizure were legal. The key issue here is whether the daughter had the authority to let the police into her mother's bedroom, especially since she's a minor. Also, considering that the parents are joint tenants and legally separated, who has authority over the premises.

So, Fourth Amendment rights prevent unreasonable searches and seizures. For the police to enter without a warrant, they need either consent or exigent circumstances. Here, the daughter let them in, so the question is whether her consent was valid.

In general, a minor can consent to a search, but the issue is whether they have apparent authority to do so. Also, in this case, the daughter is 11, so she's a minor. But does she have the authority to let the police into her mother's bedroom? Or does the mother have a reasonable expectation of privacy in her locked bedroom?

I remember that in some cases, a co-tenant or someone with equal access can consent to a search. But here, the parents are joint tenants, so both have an equal right to the property. However, the mother locked her bedroom, which might indicate she expects privacy there.

The daughter used a spare key to enter her mother's room. So, she had access, but does that mean she can give consent for the police to enter? The thing is, a child's consent might not be considered valid if they don't have authority over the area. But wait, the daughter lives there, so maybe she does have some authority.

I think about the case where a spouse can consent to a search of their shared areas, but maybe not the other spouse's private areas. But since the parents are separated and the mother is living there, perhaps the daughter, as a resident, has the authority.

Wait, but the mother locked her bedroom. So, that's a private space within the home. The daughter entering with a keyâ€”does that mean she has permission, and therefore can extend that permission to the police?

I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. The general rule is that any person with apparent authority to consent can allow a search. For minors, it depends on whether they have sufficient control and whether a reasonable officer would believe they have authority.

In this case, the daughter is 11 and lives there. She found the key, which suggests she has access to her mother's room, perhaps with permission. So when she lets the police in, maybe the police would reasonably believe she has authority.

But wait, the mother locked the door, which might indicate that even the daughter doesn't have permission to enter. Or perhaps the daughter does have a key, implying she does have access. So maybe the daughter's consent is valid.

Alternatively, another angle is that the daughter's father is a joint owner. Did the daughter call her father, and he told her to call the police. But the father wasn't present, so he didn't consent directly. But the daughter, acting on his instruction, let the police in.

But the key issue is whether the daughter's consent was valid. If she had the authority, then the evidence isn't suppressed. If not, the motion to suppress is granted.

Looking at the options, option F says the motion should be granted because the daughter didn't have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom. Option A says it's denied because the daughter and husband, as co-owners, had authority.

Wait, but the husband didn't give consent directly. The daughter called the police on her own, with her father's advice. So the husband's co-ownership might not directly translate to the daughter's authority.

I think the critical point is whether the daughter had the authority to consent to the search of her mother's bedroom. Since the bedroom was locked, it's a private area. Normally, a child can't consent to the search of a parent's private space unless they have actual authority.

So, in this case, the mother locked the door, indicating she expects privacy. The daughter used a spare key, but does that mean she had permission to enter? Maybe, but does that extend to letting the police in?

I think the Supreme Court case of Georgia v. Randolph comes into play here. In that case, a spouse could not consent to the search of premises when the other spouse was present and objected. But here, the mother wasn't present; she was out. So the question is whether, in her absence, the daughter can consent.

But wait, in Randolph, the court held that one tenant cannot consent to a search over the objection of another tenant. But when the objecting tenant isn't present, can the other tenant consent? Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. In Randolph, the police went to a home where the suspect (Randolph) refused consent, but his wife gave consent. The court held that the wife's consent was not valid because Randolph was present and refused. So when the objecting party is present, their refusal takes precedence.

In this case, the mother is not present. So if the daughter, as a co-occupant (even though she's a minor), can consent, then the search is valid. But wait, the mother and daughter are the residents. The mother is the parent, but the daughter is a minor. Does a minor have the authority to consent to a search of a parent's locked room?

I think that in this scenario, the daughter's consent might not be sufficient because the room was locked, indicating the mother's expectation of privacy. Even though the daughter had a key, she might not have the authority to consent to a police search, especially since she's a minor. The police might need a warrant or consent from an authorized person.

So the answer would be that the motion should be granted because the daughter didn't have apparent authority. Looking at the options, that's option F.

The question revolves around whether the daughter's consent to allow the police to enter her mother's locked bedroom and seize evidence (cocaine) is valid under the Fourth Amendment. The mother, who is legally separated from her husband and owns the home in joint tenancy, locked her bedroom, indicating an expectation of privacy. The daughter, who is 11 years old, found a spare key, entered the bedroom, discovered the cocaine, and called the police. She then let them in and handed over the bag.

The key issue is whether the daughter had the authority to consent to the police entering her mother's locked bedroom. While minors can sometimes consent to searches, the validity of their consent depends on whether they have apparent authority over the area in question. In this case, the mother locked the bedroom, which suggests she expected privacy, even from her daughter. Although the daughter had a key and access, this does not necessarily mean she had the authority to allow the police to search the room, especially since it was locked and likely considered a private space.

Under Fourth Amendment precedent, a co-tenant or occupant can consent to a search, but when the area in question is locked and belongs to another occupant (here, the mother), the consent of the absent occupant is generally required unless exigent circumstances exist. Since the mother was not present and there is no indication of exigent circumstances, the daughter's consent may not be sufficient to justify the search.

Given these considerations, the motion to suppress the evidence should be granted because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.
