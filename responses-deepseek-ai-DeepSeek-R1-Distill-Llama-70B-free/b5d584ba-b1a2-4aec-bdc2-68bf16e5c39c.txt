Okay, so I've got this problem here about a capacitor, and I need to find the insulation resistance. Let me see what I remember about capacitors and their discharge.

The problem says it's a 1 microfarad capacitor. Oh right, micro is 10^-6, so 1e-6 F. It's charged to 1V at time t=0 and then disconnected. After 100 hours, the voltage drops to 0.9V. I need to find the insulation resistance.

Hmm, I remember that when a capacitor is disconnected, it should ideally hold the charge, right? But if there's some resistance, like insulation resistance, it will discharge over time. So the voltage isn't staying at 1V; it's dropping because of that resistance.

The formula I think is related to the discharge of a capacitor through a resistor. The voltage over time is given by an exponential decay. The formula is V(t) = V0 * e^(-t/(RC)), where V0 is the initial voltage, t is time, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance.

Wait, so in this case, V(t) is 0.9V, V0 is 1V. So plugging in, 0.9 = e^(-t/(RC)). Let me write that down.

0.9 = e^(-t/(RC)).

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for t/(RC). So ln(0.9) = -t/(RC). That means t/(RC) = -ln(0.9).

Wait, because 0.9 is less than 1, ln(0.9) is negative, so the negative cancels out. So t/(RC) = ln(1/0.9) or ln(10/9). Let me compute ln(10/9). Wait, 10/9 is approximately 1.1111. The natural log of that is about 0.10536.

So t/(RC) ≈ 0.10536.

Now, solving for R: R = t/(C * 0.10536).

Wait, let me double-check: R = t/(C * (ln(V0/V))) )? Because V(t) = V0 e^{-t/(RC)}, so rearranged, t/(RC) = -ln(V/V0). Which is the same as ln(V0/V) = t/(RC).

So R = t/(C * ln(V0/V)).

Right, so V0 is 1V, V is 0.9V. So ln(1/0.9) is ln(10/9) as I thought earlier.

Now, t is 100 hours. But wait, in the formula, the units matter. Capacitance is in farads, which is coulombs per volt, and the unit for R is ohms (which is volts per ampere, but more importantly, for RC time constant, the unit is seconds when R is in ohms and C in farads).

So I need to convert 100 hours into seconds. Let's see, 100 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 6000 minutes. Then 6000 * 60 seconds per minute = 360,000 seconds. So t is 3.6e5 seconds.

C is 1 microfarad, which is 1e-6 farads.

So plugging into R = t/(C * ln(10/9)).

Let me compute the denominator. C is 1e-6 F. ln(10/9) is about 0.10536.

So denominator is 1e-6 * 0.10536 = 1.0536e-7.

Numerator is t = 3.6e5 seconds.

So R = (3.6e5) / (1.0536e-7).

Let me compute that. 3.6e5 is 360,000. 1.0536e-7 is 0.00000010536.

So 360,000 divided by 0.00000010536. Let me compute that step by step.

360,000 / 0.00000010536.

Wait, that's the same as 360,000 * (1 / 0.00000010536). Let me compute 1/0.00000010536.

1e7 is 10,000,000. So 0.0000001 is 1e-7. 0.00000010536 is 1.0536e-7. So 1 / 1.0536e-7 is approximately 9.49e6. Because 1e7 is 10 million, and 1.0536 is about 5% higher than 1, so 1/1.0536 is about 0.95. So 0.95 * 1e7 is 9.5e6.

Wait, more accurately, 1 / 1.0536 ≈ 0.9487. So 0.9487e7 → 9.487e6.

So 360,000 * 9.487e6 = ?

Let's compute 360,000 * 9.487e6.

But wait, 360,000 is 3.6e5. So 3.6e5 * 9.487e6 = 3.6 * 9.487 * 1e11.

3.6 *9.487 is approximately let's compute that: 9 *3.6 is 32.4, 0.487 *3.6 is about 1.7532. So total is 34.1532. So 34.1532e11, which is 3.41532e12 Ohms.

Wait, let me compute more precisely.

Because 3.6 *9.487: 9 *3.6=32.4, 0.487 *3.6= 1.752 (approx). So 32.4+1.752=34.152.

So R ≈34.152e11 Ohms → 3.4152e12 Ohms.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 3.42e12. Oh wait, 3.415 is close to 3.42, so option C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation to see if I made any mistake.

Wait, let me recompute ln(10/9). Let me calculate ln(10/9) accurately.

10/9 is approximately 1.1111111.

The natural logarithm of 1.1111111 can be calculated as ln(1 + 0.1111111). Using the Taylor series: ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... for x <1.

x=0.1111111.

x=0.1111

x^2=0.012345, x^3=0.001371742, x^4=0.0001524168.

So ln(1.1111) ≈ 0.1111 - 0.012345/2 + 0.0013717/3 - 0.0001524/4.

Compute each term:

0.1111

Second term: 0.012345/2=0.0061725 → subtract this: 0.1111-0.0061725=0.1049275.

Third term: 0.0013717/3 ≈0.0004572 → add: 0.1049275 +0.0004572 = 0.1053847.

Fourth term: 0.0001524/4=0.0000381 → subtract: 0.1053847 -0.0000381=0.1053466.

So up to the fourth term, ln(10/9)≈0.1053466.

Earlier approximation was 0.10536, so that's accurate enough.

So now, R= t/(C * ln(10/9)).

t=100 hours=360,000 seconds.

C=1e-6 F.

So R=360000 / (1e-6 * 0.1053466).

Compute denominator: 1e-6 * 0.1053466= 1.053466e-7.

So R=360000 / 1.053466e-7.

Compute 360000 divided by 1.053466e-7.

360000 = 3.6e5.

So 3.6e5 / 1.053466e-7 = (3.6 / 1.053466) ) * 1e12.

Compute 3.6 /1.053466.

Let me calculate that. 1.053466 ×3.4= 3.584 (since 1 ×3.4=3.4, 0.053466 ×3.4≈0.1817 → 3.4+0.1817=3.5817).

Wait 3.4 *1.053466= 3.5818.

But 3.6 is a bit higher, so 3.6 is 3.4 + 0.2.

So 0.2 *1.053466=0.210693.

So 3.4 gives 3.5818, plus 0.210693 is 3.7925. Wait, but wait, I'm not doing this right.

Wait, I need to compute 3.6 / 1.053466.

Let me consider 3.6 ÷1.053466.

Well, 1.053466 times 3.42 would be 3.42 * 1.053466.

Wait, perhaps better to just compute 3.6 ÷1.053466.

Alternatively, 3.6 / 1.053466 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.053466 ×3.415 = ?

1.053466 *3 =3.1604.

1.053466 *0.415=?

Compute 1.053466 *0.4= 0.4213864.

1.053466 *0.015=0.015802.

Adding 0.4213864 +0.015802=0.4371884.

So 3.1604 +0.4371884=3.5975884.

Ah, so 3.415 ×1.053466≈3.5976, which is just under 3.6.

The difference is 3.6 -3.5975884=0.0024116.

So how much more than 3.415 do we need to get to 3.6?

Let me compute 3.415 + delta, where delta is the amount we need.

We have 3.415 *1.053466=3.5975884. We need 3.6, which is 3.5975884 +0.0024116.

So delta *1.053466 = 0.0024116 → delta = 0.0024116 / 1.053466 ≈0.002288.

So 3.415 +0.002288=3.417288.

So approximately 3.4173.

So 3.6 /1.053466≈3.4173.

So R≈3.4173e12 Ohms.

So looking at the options, option C is 3.42e12, which matches.

Wait, but let me compute the exact value more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just calculate it with more exactness.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation.

Wait, 100 hours is 100 * 3600 seconds. 100*3600=360,000 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute R exactly using more precise numbers.

Let me recompute:

R = t/(C * ln(10/9)).

t=360,000 s.

C=1e-6 F.

Compute 360,000 / (1e-6 * 0.1053466) = 360000 / (1.053466e-7).

Compute 360000 divided by 1.053466e-7.

So 360000 / 1.053466e-7 = (360000 * 1e7) ) /1.053466.

Wait 360000 *1e7 is 3.6e5 *1e7=3.6e12.

Wait no, 360000 is 3.6e5. So 3.6e5 / 1.053466e-7 = (3.6e5) / (1.053466e-7) )= (3.6 /1.053466) ) * (1e5 / 1e-7) )= 3.4153 *1e12 → 3.4153e12 Ohms.

Which is approximately 3.415e12. The options have C as 3.42e12, which is very close.

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the discharge of a capacitor through its insulation resistance. The voltage across the capacitor decreases exponentially over time according to the formula:

\[
V(t) = V_0 e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\]

Here:
- \( V_0 = 1 \, \text{V} \) (initial voltage),
- \( V(t) = 0.9 \, \text{V} \) (voltage after 100 hours),
- \( t = 100 \, \text{hours} = 360,000 \, \text{seconds} \),
- \( C = 1 \, \mu\text{F} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \),
- \( R \) is the insulation resistance to be determined.

### Step 1: Rearrange the formula
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{V(t)}{V_0}\right) = -\frac{t}{RC}
\]

Rearranging for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{t}{C \ln\left(\frac{V_0}{V(t)}\right)}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\ln\left(\frac{V_0}{V(t)}\right)\)
Given \( V_0 = 1 \, \text{V} \) and \( V(t) = 0.9 \, \text{V} \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{V_0}{V(t)}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.9}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{10}{9}\right)
\]

Using approximations or a calculator:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{10}{9}\right) \approx 0.10536
\]

### Step 3: Substitute values into the formula
Substitute \( t = 360,000 \, \text{s} \), \( C = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \), and \( \ln\left(\frac{10}{9}\right) \approx 0.10536 \):

\[
R = \frac{360,000}{(1 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 0.10536}
\]

First, compute the denominator:

\[
(1 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 0.10536 = 1.0536 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Now divide:

\[
R = \frac{360,000}{1.0536 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{3.6 \times 10^5}{1.0536 \times 10^{-7}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
R = (3.6 / 1.0536) \times 10^{12} \approx 3.415 \times 10^{12} \, \Omega
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The computed resistance \( R \approx 3.415 \times 10^{12} \, \Omega \) is closest to option **C: \( 3.42 \times 10^{12} \, \Omega \)**.
