Okay, so I have this question about the largest Hindu temple complex ever built, and I need to figure out where it's located. The options are A through J, each being a different place. Let me start by recalling what I know about Hindu temples and their sizes.

I remember that Angkor Wat is a really famous temple, but wait, isn't that in Cambodia? I think Angkor Wat is actually a Buddhist temple, though. Or is it? Maybe I'm mixing things up. I should double-check that. No, wait, I think Angkor Wat was originally Hindu, dedicated to Vishnu, but later it became Buddhist. So maybe it's considered both? But the question is about the largest Hindu temple complex, so if Angkor Wat is primarily Buddhist now, that might not be the right answer.

Another thought: I've heard of Prambanan in Indonesia. Prambanan is a massive Hindu temple complex in Java, right? It's a UNESCO World Heritage site. So that's option G: Java. But I'm not entirely sure if it's the largest.

Wait, there's also the temple at Borobudur, but isn't that Buddhist? Yeah, Borobudur is a Buddhist site in Java. So maybe Prambanan is the Hindu one in Java.

Then there's the option of Cambodia, which is option F. If Angkor Wat is in Cambodia, and it's a Hindu temple, that might be the answer. But earlier I thought it's more Buddhist now. Hmm.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Angkor Wat is in Cambodia, and it was built as a Hindu temple but later transformed into a Buddhist site. So if the question is about the largest Hindu temple complex ever constructed, maybe it's still Angkor Wat because of its original purpose and size. Or perhaps the largest functioning Hindu temple is somewhere else.

Wait, another point: the question says "ever constructed," so the original purpose might make it count. Also, Angkor Wat is indeed a massive complex, bigger than Prambanan perhaps? I'm not sure about the sizes.

Alternatively, I think there's a temple in India that's very large. But looking at the options, the choices are Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Bali, Thailand, Bombay, Cambodia, Java, Delhi, Nepal, Calcutta. So India's cities are Bombay (Mumbai), Delhi, and Calcutta (Kolkata). 

I know that the Akshardham Temple in Delhi is very large, but I'm not sure if it's the largest. Also, the question is about the largest ever, which might be an ancient one rather than a modern one.

So, going back, if Angkor Wat in Cambodia (option F) is the largest, that's a possibility. But I'm not certain whether it's considered a Hindu temple complex or not. Maybe the answer is Java, option G, because of Prambanan.

Wait, I should compare the sizes. Angkor Wat covers about 400 acres, I think. Prambanan is about 100 hectares, which is roughly 247 acres. So Angkor Wat is bigger. So if the question is about the largest, then Angkor Wat would be the answer, and it's in Cambodia, option F.

But wait, the question is about a Hindu temple complex. If Angkor Wat is now a Buddhist site, does that disqualify it? Or is it still considered a Hindu temple because it was built as one? I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is Java, because Prambanan is a Hindu temple complex, and perhaps it's considered the largest. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, I think Prambanan is actually a collection of temples, and it's a major Hindu site. But I'm not sure if it's bigger than Angkor Wat. I think Angkor Wat is more extensive.

So putting it together, I think the largest Hindu temple complex is Angkor Wat in Cambodia, option F. But I'm a bit unsure because of its current religious affiliation. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Java, option G, because Prambanan is a Hindu complex and the largest in the Hindu world.

Wait, another point: sometimes the largest Hindu temple is the one in Angkor Wat, but others might argue that it's no longer primarily Hindu. So perhaps the answer is Java, option G.

I'm a bit torn. But I think the intended answer is F: Cambodia, because Angkor Wat is widely recognized as the largest temple complex, even if it's now used more for Buddhism. So I'll go with F.

The question asks for the location of the largest Hindu temple complex ever constructed. To determine this, it's important to consider both the size and the original purpose of the temple complexes mentioned.

- **Option F: Cambodia** is home to Angkor Wat, which is one of the largest temple complexes in the world. While it was originally built as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, it later transitioned to a Buddhist site. Despite its current religious affiliation, its original purpose and massive size (covering approximately 400 acres) make it a strong candidate.

- **Option G: Java** is known for the Prambanan temple complex, a significant Hindu site and a UNESCO World Heritage location. However, it is smaller than Angkor Wat, spanning about 247 acres.

Given that the question specifies the "largest Hindu temple complex ever constructed," Angkor Wat in Cambodia is the most fitting answer due to its size and original Hindu purpose, even though it is now primarily associated with Buddhism.
