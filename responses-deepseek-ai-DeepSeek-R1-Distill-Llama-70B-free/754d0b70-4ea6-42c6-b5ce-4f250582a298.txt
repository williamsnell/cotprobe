Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating monthly payments and true annual interest rates for two different flat rate charges. Hmm, I remember that flat rate means the interest is calculated on the original principal, right? So, the charges are 3% and 5% on a $500 loan, which has to be repaid in 12 equal monthly installments.

Wait, I think the first step is to calculate the total interest paid in each case. For part (a), the charge is 3%, so the interest would be 0.03 * 500 = $15. Then, the total amount to repay is 500 + 15 = $515. Since it's paid over 12 months, the monthly payment would be 515 / 12. Let me calculate that: 515 divided by 12 is approximately $42.92 (since 12 * 42.92 equals 515.04, which is close enough). So that's the monthly payment for 3%.

Now, for part (b), the charge is 5%, so interest is 0.05 * 500 = $25. Total repayment is 525, so monthly is 525 / 12 = $43.75. So the payments are $42.92 (a) and $43.75 (b). Let me check the options to see which ones have these payments. Looking at the options:

Option B: Payments 42.92 and 43.75. That's a match for what I calculated.

Option H has payments swapped, so no. Option J has the same payments as B, but perhaps different interest rates.

Wait, I need to calculate the true annual interest rate next. The true rate is the effective annual rate based on the monthly payments.

I think I should use the formula for the effective interest rate. Since the payments are monthly, each payment includes interest and principal. The effective rate can be found using the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) formula, which in this case is the rate that makes the present value of the payments equal to the principal.

The formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PV is the present value (the initial amount, $500), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods (12).

So I need to solve for r in this equation.

Let me start with part (a), where PMT is $42.92.

So, 500 = 42.92 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]

Hmm, I can rearrange this to solve for r. It's a bit tricky without a financial calculator, but I can use trial and error or approximate.

Alternatively, I remember that the effective annual rate (EAR) for a loan can be calculated with:

EAR = (1 + (r))^n - 1

But wait, that's when r is the periodic rate. Here, I'm trying to find the periodic rate first, then the EAR.

So for part (a), PMT is 42.92.

I can set up the equation as:

500 = 42.92 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]

I need to find r such that this holds.

Alternatively, I might use the approximate formula for the effective rate. But perhaps a better approach is to use an iterative method.

Let me try:

Assume r is the monthly rate. Let me try r = 0.4% (0.004). Let's compute the denominator:

(1 - (1.004)^-12) / 0.004

(1.004)^12 is about 1.048. So 1 - 1/1.048 ≈ 0.048 / 0.004 = 12?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute (1.004)^12 more accurately.

Wait, 1.004^12: Let's compute it step by step.

1.004^1 = 1.004

^2 = 1.008016

^3 ≈ 1.012048

^4 ≈ 1.016128

^5 ≈ 1.020266

^6 ≈ 1.024462

^7 ≈ 1.028726

^8 ≈ 1.033059

^9 ≈ 1.037464

^10 ≈ 1.041942

^11 ≈ 1.046495

^12 ≈ 1.051117

So (1.004)^12 ≈ 1.0511.

So 1/(1.0511) ≈ 0.9514.

So 1 - 0.9514 = 0.0486. Divided by 0.004 is 12.15. So the denominator is 12.15.

So 42.92 * 12.15 ≈ 522. So 42.92 * denominator is 522. But the left side is 500. So 500 = 522, which is too high. So the r I chose (0.4%) is too low. Because when r is lower, the denominator is larger, making the right side larger than 500.

Wait, wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think: If I have a lower r, the term [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ] increases, because (1 + r)^-12 is smaller, so 1 - that is larger, and divided by a smaller r, so the denominator is larger. So for a given PMT, if I have a lower r, the present value would be higher. So in our case, the present value is 500. So if my calculated present value using r=0.4% gives 522, which is higher than 500, I need a higher r.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If the interest rate is higher, each payment has more value in terms of present value. Because higher discount rate reduces the present value of future payments. Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the present value (PV) is calculated as the sum of PMT/(1+r)^n for each period. So higher r makes each PMT worth less in present terms, thus lowering the sum.

So if with r=0.4%, I got 522 as the PV, which is higher than 500, that means that the actual r must be higher, because a higher rate would lower the PV to 500.

So I need to find r such that 42.92 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-12)/r] = 500.

Let me try r=0.45% (0.0045).

Compute (1.0045)^12.

Hmm, 1.0045^12. Let me approximate.

At 0.45%:

1.0045^12 = ?

We can use the formula (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) when r is small, but maybe better to compute step by step.

1.0045^1 = 1.0045

^2 = 1.0045 * 1.0045 = approx 1.009025

^3 ≈ 1.01358 (since 1.009025 *1.0045 ≈ 1.01358)

^4 ≈ 1.01818

^5 ≈ 1.02283

^6 ≈ 1.02753

^7 ≈ 1.03229

^8 ≈ 1.03711

^9 ≈ 1.04199

^10 ≈ 1.04694

^11 ≈ 1.05196

^12 would be approximately 1.05705.

So 1/(1.05705) ≈ 0.9456.

1 - 0.9456 = 0.0544. Divided by 0.0045: 0.0544 / 0.0045 ≈ 12.0889.

So the denominator is 12.0889.

So 42.92 * 12.0889 ≈ 42.92 *12 = 514.6, 42.92*0.0889≈ ~3.82, total ≈518.42. But we need the product to be 500, so 518 is still higher. So we need a higher r.

Let me try r=0.5% (0.005).

Compute (1.005)^12. I remember that (1.005)^12 is approximately 1.061678.

So 1/(1.061678)≈0.9417. So 1-0.9417=0.0583. Divided by 0.005: 0.0583/0.005=11.66.

So denominator is 11.66.

42.92 *11.66 ≈ let's see, 42.92 *10=429.2, 42.92 *1.66≈71.29, so total≈500.49. Oh wait, that's very close to 500!

So r=0.5% gives us a PV of approximately 500.49, which is almost 500. So the monthly rate is approximately 0.5%, making the effective annual rate (EAR) = (1 + 0.005)^12 -1 ≈ 6.1678% -1 = 5.1678%, which is approximately 5.2%.

So for case (a), the true annual rate is about 5.2%.

Now for case (b), the monthly payment is $43.75.

So again, using the same formula:

500 = 43.75 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]

We need to find r that satisfies this.

Let me try r=0.75% (0.0075).

Compute (1.0075)^12. Let's approximate:

1.0075^12: Let me compute step by step.

1.0075^2 = 1.015006

^3≈1.022769

^4≈1.030610

^5≈1.038529

^6≈1.046529

^7≈1.054616

^8≈1.062797

^9≈1.071081

^10≈1.079475

^11≈1.087985

^12≈1.096614.

So 1/(1.096614)= approx 0.9123.

1 - 0.9123=0.0877. Divided by 0.0075: 0.0877 / 0.0075≈11.693.

So 43.75 *11.693 ≈43.75 *11=481.25, 43.75 *0.693≈30.34, total≈511.59. But we need the product to be 500. So 511.59 is higher than 500, which suggests that r is too low. Need a higher r.

Wait, because with r=0.75%, the present value is 511.59, which is higher than 500, so the actual r must be higher to bring the PV down to 500.

Let me try r=0.8% (0.008).

Compute (1.008)^12. Well, 1.008^12. Let me compute:

1.008^2=1.016064

^3=1.024192 (approx 1.016064 *1.008=1.024192)

^4=1.032416

^5=1.040784

^6=1.049305

^7=1.057981

^8=1.066820

^9=1.075823

^10=1.084993

^11=1.094342

^12=1.103875.

So 1/(1.103875)= approx 0.9051.

1 - 0.9051 =0.0949. Divided by 0.008: 0.0949/0.008=11.8625.

So 43.75 *11.8625 ≈43.75 *11=481.25, 43.75 *0.8625≈37.73, total≈518.98. Still higher than 500. Hmm, maybe I need a higher rate.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I can try a higher r.

Let me try r=0.9% (0.009).

Compute (1.009)^12.

1.009^12: Let's see, 1.009^2=1.018081.

^3≈1.02715.

^4≈1.03636.

^5≈1.04575.

^6≈1.05532.

^7≈1.06511.

^8≈1.07511.

^9≈1.08534.

^10≈1.09581.

^11≈1.10653.

^12≈1.11751.

So 1/(1.11751)=approx 0.8948.

1 - 0.8948=0.1052. Divided by 0.009: 0.1052/0.009≈11.689.

So 43.75 *11.689 ≈43.75*11=481.25; 43.75 *0.689≈30.14. Total≈511.39. Still above 500.

Hmm, maybe I need to go higher. Let's try r=1.0% (0.01).

(1.01)^12= approx 1.126825.

1/(1.126825)=0.8874.

1 -0.8874=0.1126. Divided by 0.01:11.26.

43.75 *11.26 = Let's compute: 43.75 *11=481.25, 43.75 *0.26≈11.375, total≈492.625. That's below 500. So when r=1%, the PV is 492.625.

Wait, when r=0.9%, PV was 511.39; at r=1%, it's 492.625. We need a PV of exactly 500. So the correct r is between 0.9% and 1.0%.

Let me try r=0.95% (0.0095).

Compute (1.0095)^12.

Well, 1.0095^12: Let me make an approximate calculation. Alternatively, perhaps use the rule of 78 or another method, but maybe better to linearly approximate.

At r=0.9%, PV was 511.39.

At r=1.0%, PV=492.625.

The difference in PV is 511.39 -492.625=18.765 over a 0.1% change in r.

We need to find the r where PV=500. 500 is 11.39 below 511.39 (at 0.9%: 500=511.39 -11.39).

So fraction=11.39 /18.765≈0.6075.

So r=0.9% + 0.6075*(0.1%)=0.9% +0.06075%≈0.96075%.

So approximately 0.961% monthly rate.

So the EAR is (1 + 0.0096075)^12 -1.

Calculating that:

(1.0096075)^12.

Let me compute this step by step.

1.0096075^2= approx 1.019313.

^3≈1.02893.

^4≈1.03856.

^5≈1.04829.

^6≈1.05822.

^7≈1.06836.

^8≈1.07865.

^9≈1.08911.

^10≈1.09977.

^11≈1.11065.

^12≈1.12180.

So 1.1218, so EAR≈12.18%.

Wait, but earlier when I tried r=0.008 (0.8%), the PV was 518.98, which is way above 500. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the EAR formula.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the effective interest rate when payments are made monthly.

The formula is:

EAR = (1 + (I/(P(1 - (1 + I)^-n)/n)))^n -1

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the effective annual rate can be calculated as:

EAR = (1 + (PMT * r * (1 - (1 + r)^-n))/ (PMT * (1 - (1 + r)^-n) - I)))^n - 1

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that the effective rate can be calculated as:

EAR = (1 + (r))^n -1, where r is the periodic rate.

Wait, but in this case, the periodic rate isn't the same as the flat rate. Hmm.

Wait, in case (a), the flat rate is 3%, but the effective rate we found was about 5.2%. So maybe the same approach applies here.

Wait, if the monthly rate is 0.96%, then the EAR is (1.0096)^12 -1 ≈ 12.2%? But wait, earlier when I tried r=0.96%, the EAR would be higher than that. Wait, wait, no, 0.96% is the monthly rate. So 0.96% *12=11.52%, but that's the nominal annual rate. The EAR would be higher because of compounding.

Wait, let me compute (1 + 0.0096)^12.

Which is approximately 1.0096^12.

As I calculated earlier, around 1.1218, so 12.18% EAR.

Wait, but the flat rate in case (b) is 5%, so the true rate is around 12.18%. So looking at the options, let's see which ones match.

Option B says for 3%, monthly payment is 42.92, true rate 5.5%. For 5%, payment 43.75, true rate 9.2%. Hmm, but my calculation for 5% gave around 12.18%, so that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Because in case (b), the flat rate is 5%, so the interest is 25, total repayment 525, monthly 525/12=43.75.

So the monthly payment is correct. Now, to find the true rate:

We have to find the EAR where 500 = 43.75 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]

Let me try a different approach.

I can rearrange the present value formula
