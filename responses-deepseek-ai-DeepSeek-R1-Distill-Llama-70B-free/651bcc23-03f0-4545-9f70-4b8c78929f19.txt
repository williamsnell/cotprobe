Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that the base of a solid is the region bounded by x² equals 4y and the line y equals 2. Each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. I need to find the volume of this solid, and the options are from A to J.

Hmm, okay, so let me break this down. First, I need to visualize the region. The equation x² = 4y is a parabola that opens upwards. The line y=2 is a horizontal line. So the region bounded by these two should be the area where the parabola is below y=2. 

Wait, so solving for x in the parabola equation, x goes from -something to +something at a given y. For y=2, x²=4*2=8, so x is from -2√2 to 2√2. But I'm not sure if I need that right now.

The key part is that each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. Hmm, when they say perpendicular to the y-axis, that means the cross-sections are taken in the x-z plane, right? So for each y, the cross-section is a square.

But wait, the base is in the x-y plane, bounded by x²=4y and y=2. So the solid extends along the z-axis, with each cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis being a square. So for each y, the cross-sectional area is a square, and the side length depends on y.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: cross-sections perpendicular to the y-axis would vary with y. So each cross-section at a particular y is a square whose side length is determined by the x and z dimensions at that y. But since the base is in x and y, perhaps the cross-sections are in x and z.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of slices. For a given y, the solid's cross-section is a square. The area of this square would then be (side length)^2, and the volume would be the integral of that area as y goes from 0 to 2, since the region is bounded below by y=0 (the parabola starts at the origin) up to y=2.

Wait, no. The region is bounded by x²=4y and y=2. The parabola x²=4y has its vertex at (0,0), and y=2 is a horizontal line. So the bounded region is all points (x,y) where y ranges from 0 up to 2, and for each y, x ranges from -2√y to +2√y. Because x²=4y ⇒ x=±2√y.

So for each y between 0 and 2, the width in the x-direction is from -2√y to 2√y, which is a total width of 4√y. Now, the cross-sections perpendicular to the y-axis are squares. So the side length of each square is equal to the width in the x-direction at that y. But wait, the cross-section is two-dimensional, so the square's side would correspond to both x and z directions. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing something here.

Wait, the cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square in the x-z plane. So for each y, the square extends in x and z. But the base is in the x-y plane, so the limits in x at each y are from -2√y to 2√y, which is a length of 4√y. So if the cross-section is a square, then in the x direction, the length is 4√y, so the side of the square must be 4√y. But wait, that can't be right because the cross-section is a square, so both x and z should have the same length.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The cross-section's side is determined by the x-range and the z-range. But the problem states that each plane section is a square, so perhaps the side length is the same in both x and z directions. But how does that relate to the base?

Wait, maybe it's better to model this using the method of slicing. Since each cross-section is a square, the area A(y) at height y is (side length)^2. But the side length of the square would be determined by the width in the x-direction at that y. Because the solid is formed by moving this square along the y-axis, but each square's side is determined by the x-width at that y.

Wait, let me think again. The region in the x-y plane is bounded by x²=4y and y=2. So for each y between 0 and 2, the x ranges from -2√y to 2√y, which is a total width of 4√y. Now, if each cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square, then the side length of the square would be this width, 4√y. But wait, no. Because the cross-section is in the x-z plane, so the square's side length would be determined by the x and z extents. But how?

Wait, perhaps the solid is constructed such that at each y, the cross-section is a square whose side is equal to the x-width at that y. So the area A(y) would be (4√y)^2 = 16 y. Then the volume would be the integral from y=0 to y=2 of A(y) dy, which is ∫16 y dy from 0 to 2. That integral would be 16*(y²/2) evaluated from 0 to 2, so 16*(4/2 - 0) = 16*2 =32. So the volume would be 32, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistake. Let me go through it again.

The base is the area between the parabola x²=4y and y=2. So the region is bounded below by the parabola and above by y=2.

For each y in [0,2], the x ranges from x=-2√y to x=2√y, so the width in x is 4√y.

Now, the cross-sections perpendicular to the y-axis are squares. So for each y, the cross-section is a square whose side length is this x-width, 4√y. So the area of each cross-section is (4√y)^2 = 16 y.

Therefore, the volume is the integral from y=0 to y=2 of 16 y dy.

Calculating that integral:

∫16 y dy from 0 to 2 = 16 ∫y dy from 0 to 2 = 16 [ (y^2)/2 ] from 0 to 2.

At y=2: (2^2)/2 = 4/2 = 2.

So 16 * 2 = 32.

So the volume is 32, which corresponds to option B.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes cross-sections perpendicular to an axis can be interpreted as being in the other direction. Let me just double-check.

If the cross-sections are perpendicular to the y-axis, then they're taken along planes where y is constant, so slices along the x-z plane. The area of each such slice is a square.

The length in the x-direction at each y is 4√y, as we have. So the square's side would be 4√y, making the area (4√y)^2=16 y. So yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length is determined differently. For example, maybe the side is the distance from the origin to x=2√y, which is 2√y, and then the square has side 2√y, so area would be (2√y)^2=4y. Then the integral would be ∫4y dy from 0 to 2, which is 4*(y²/2) from 0 to2=4*(2)=8, which is option A. But that would be if the side is only from x=0 to x=2√y, but no, the region from x=-2√y to x=2√y is symmetric, so the total width is 4√y.

Wait, wait. If the cross-section is a square, then the side length in x would be from -a to +a, where a is 2√y, making the total width 2a = 4√y. But if the square has side length 4√y, then the area is (4√y)^2=16y. Alternatively, if the square is built such that the side is from 0 to 2√y, making the side length 2√y, but that would ignore the negative x side, which doesn't make sense because the region includes both positive and negative x. So I think the correct approach is to take the full width as the side length, which is 4√y. So area would be (4√y)^2=16y.

Thus, the integral is 16y dy from 0 to 2, giving 32, which is option B. So I think the correct answer is B:32.

The base of the solid is the region bounded by the parabola \(x^2 = 4y\) and the line \(y = 2\). The parabola \(x^2 = 4y\) opens upward, and the line \(y = 2\) is a horizontal boundary. The region is therefore bounded below by the parabola and above by \(y = 2\). For a given \(y\), the \(x\)-values range from \(-2\sqrt{y}\) to \(2\sqrt{y}\), giving a total width of \(4\sqrt{y}\) in the \(x\)-direction.

The problem states that each plane section perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis is a square. This means that at each \(y\), the cross-sectional area in the \(x\)-\(z\) plane is a square whose side length is equal to the width in the \(x\)-direction, which is \(4\sqrt{y}\). The area of each square is therefore:

\[
A(y) = (4\sqrt{y})^2 = 16y
\]

To find the volume of the solid, we integrate the cross-sectional area \(A(y)\) over the range of \(y\) from 0 to 2:

\[
\text{Volume} = \int_0^2 A(y) \, dy = \int_0^2 16y \, dy
\]

Evaluating the integral:

\[
\int_0^2 16y \, dy = 16 \int_0^2 y \, dy = 16 \left[\frac{y^2}{2}\right]_0^2 = 16 \left(\frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2}\right) = 16 \cdot 2 = 32
\]

Thus, the volume of the solid is \(32\), which corresponds to option **B**.
