Question:

A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim's estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim's estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim's estate then asked the witness the following question, "Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim's broken nose?" The witness replied, "Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, And that's only the beginning. "Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because it reports the defendant's adoptive admission of the victim's assertion.
B: inadmissible, because it is a character evidence.
C: admissible, because it is considered a prior bad act.
D: inadmissible, because it violates the defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him.
E: inadmissible, because it is a prejudicial evidence.
F: inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.
G: admissible, because it is a statement made by a party opponent.
H: admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.
I: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible, because it constitutes an excited utterance.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the situation is a civil trial for wrongful death. The defendant was acquitted in a murder trial, but now the victim's estate is suing him. During the civil trial, a witness who worked with both men is called. The witness testifies that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said the defendant caused it. Then, the attorney asks if the defendant was present during that conversation and if he said anything. The witness says yes, the defendant was there, and after the victim accused him, the defendant said, "And that's only the beginning."

Now, the defendant's attorney objects. The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

I need to think about the rules of evidence here. The key issue is probably hearsay and any exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the victim's statement about the defendant breaking his nose is hearsay. But maybe there's an exception.

Wait, but the defendant made a statement in response. The defendant's statement is "And that's only the beginning." So, the defendant's statement is being offered against him. That might be an admission by a party opponent, which is an exception under FRE 801(d)(2). So, the defendant's statement isn't hearsay because it's an admission.

But what about the victim's statement? The victim is deceased, so it's a statement by someone else. The victim said the defendant broke his nose, which is a statement that would typically be hearsay. Unless it falls under another exception.

Wait, the question is about the entire testimony being objected. The question combines both the victim's statement and the defendant's response. The attorney's question was about both. So, the testimony includes two statements: the victim's and the defendant's.

So, the victim's statement: broken nose caused by defendant. That's hearsay. Are there any exceptions here? Maybe if it's a statement of identification of a person made after perceiving him, under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps a statement under belief of impending death, but there's no indication he was dying at the time.

Alternatively, maybe the victim's statement is not being offered for the truth (that the defendant broke his nose), but just to show that the victim made the statement, which led to the defendant's response. But that might be a way to get around hearsay, but I'm not certain.

But the main point is the defendant's response. The defendant's statement is an admission, so it's admissible. But the victim's prior statement might still be hearsay unless it's covered by another exception.

Wait, but in this case, the witness is recounting a conversation where both the victim and the defendant made statements. The defendant's statement is nonhearsay as an admission, but the victim's statement is hearsay unless it's covered by an exception. So the victim's statement would be inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Alternatively, maybe the victim's statement is not being offered for the truth, but to provide context for the defendant's statement. So, perhaps it's admissible for that limited purpose, but the defendant's statement is the main part.

Wait, but the question is whether the entire testimony is admissible. The testimony includes both statements. If part is inadmissible, it could taint the whole thing unless the inadmissible part is curable.

Alternatively, maybe the victim's statement can be admitted under the excited utterance exception. FRE 803(2) allows for excited utterances made under stress of a startling event. The victim coming in with a broken nose and immediately telling the witness might qualify as an excited utterance, assuming he was still under stress from the event.

But the broken nose happened two weeks before, so perhaps not. If the event was recent, it might be excited, but two weeks later? Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is a present sense impression under 803(1), made while perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. But again, two weeks later, probably not.

So, if the victim's statement is inadmissible hearsay, then the entire testimony is inadmissible unless the defendant's statement can be considered without it.

Wait, but the defendant's statement is admissible as an admission. So, maybe the witness can testify to the defendant's statement, but not to the victim's statement. So, in that case, the victim's statement might be inadmissible, but the defendant's statement is admissible. But the way the question is phrased, the witness testifies to both. So, perhaps the court would have to decide whether the victim's statement is admissible.

Alternatively, maybe the victim's statement is admissible as a statement against interest. But wait, it's the victim's statement, not the defendant's. The statement against interest exception (804(b)(3)) applies when the declarant is unavailable, and the statement was against their interest at the time. So, the victim's statement that the defendant broke his nose might be against the victim's interest if it's an admission of some sort, but I'm not sure. It's more of an accusation against the defendant. So, maybe not a statement against the victim's interest.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dying declaration, but there's no indication the victim thought they were dying when they made the statement.

Hmm. Another approach: the defendant's statement is clearly admissible as a party admission. The victim's statement is hearsay. But perhaps it's admissible for the limited purpose of providing context for the defendant's statement. So, the fact that the victim accused the defendant is necessary to understand the defendant's response. In that case, the victim's statement would be admissible for that purpose, but not for the truth. But if the plaintiff's attorney is offering it to prove that the defendant broke the victim's nose, then it's hearsay and inadmissible.

Wait, but in the question, the attorney asked about the defendant's presence and response. So the primary purpose is to get the defendant's statement in, which is non-hearsay. The victim's statement is being used to set up the defendant's response, so maybe it's admissible as background. But if the plaintiff is trying to prove that the defendant actually broke the nose, then the victim's statement is hearsay and inadmissible.

So, if the testimony is about both, the court might have to instruct the jury that the victim's statement is not for the truth but only to provide context for the defendant's statement. But in civil cases, sometimes courts are more lenient.

Alternatively, the victim's statement is hearsay and inadmissible, so the entire testimony is inadmissible because part is inadmissible and part is admissible. But that doesn't make sense because the defendant's statement is admissible.

Wait, but the way the question is structured, the testimony includes both the victim's and the defendant's statements. So, if one part is inadmissible and the other is admissible, the court would have to determine whether the inadmissible part can be separated. But if the inadmissible part (victim's statement) is being offered to prove the truth, then it would be inadmissible, and the testimony as a whole would be inadmissible unless the inadmissible part is curable.

Alternatively, maybe the victim's statement is non-hearsay because it's a statement offered to show the effect on the listener, but in this case, it's being offered to show that the defendant made a threat, which might relate to the defendant's intent or motive in the shooting.

Wait, but the victim's statement is about a past event (the nose breaking). So, if the purpose is to show that the defendant made a threat, the victim's prior statement may not be necessary. Or maybe it's part of the same conversation.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options.

Option A: Admissible as adoptive admission. Adoptive admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(B) is when a party, by words or conduct, manifests that it adopted a statement. So, if the victim accused the defendant, and the defendant, by saying "And that's only the beginning," indicates agreement. So, the defendant's statement could be seen as adopting the victim's assertion, making the victim's statement admissible as an adoptive admission.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the defendant didn't deny it, but instead responded in a way that could be seen as agreeing that he did it and implying more to come. So, under adoptive admission, both statements would be admissible. Because the defendant's response indicates he's adopting the victim's statement.

So, in that case, the victim's statement is being offered as an adoptive admission, which is an exception to hearsay. So, the testimony is admissible. That would make option A correct.

But wait, adoptive admission applies when the statement is made by someone else, and the party (here, defendant) adopts it. So, the victim's statement would be offered as a statement that the defendant adopted, making it an admission. So, the victim's statement is hearsay, but it's exempt under the adoptive admission rule.

So, the entire testimony is admissible because it's an adoptive admission by the defendant. So, option A says it's admissible as an adoptive admission. That seems correct.

Option G says it's a statement by a party opponent, which is similar but perhaps broader. But the key is that the victim's statement is hearsay, but it's being used as part of the defendant's adoptive admission.

So, the correct answer should be A.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony that includes both the victim's statement and the defendant's response. The victim's statement, "the defendant broke his nose," is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. For it to be admissible, it must fall under a hearsay exception. 

The defendant's response, "And that's only the beginning," is not hearsay because it is a statement by a party opponent, which is admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2). However, the admissibility of the victim's statement depends on whether it qualifies under a hearsay exception. 

One potential exception is the adoptive admission rule under FRE 801(d)(2)(B). This rule applies when a party, by words or conduct, manifests that it has adopted a statement made by another. Here, the defendant's response could be interpreted as adopting the victim's accusation, as it implies agreement or acknowledgment rather than denial. Therefore, the victim's statement, when paired with the defendant's response, qualifies as an adoptive admission, making it admissible.

Given this analysis, the testimony is admissible because it reports the defendant's adoptive admission of the victim's assertion.
