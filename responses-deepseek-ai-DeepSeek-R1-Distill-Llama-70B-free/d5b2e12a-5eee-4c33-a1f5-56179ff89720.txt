Okay, so I've got this question about electromagnetic radiation and wavelengths. Hmm, I remember that electromagnetic radiation comes in different types, each with different wavelengths and energies. The question is asking which one has the longest wavelength. The options are A to J, including things like microwaves, red light, radio waves, gamma rays, etc.

Wait, I think the electromagnetic spectrum is arranged from longer wavelengths to shorter, or is it the other way around? Oh right, I think it starts with radio waves having the longest wavelengths and then goes to microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays having the shortest. So the order from longest to shortest wavelength is: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, then visible (like red, orange, yellow, blue), followed by ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma.

So looking at the options, the choices are C: Radio waves, A: Microwaves, F: Infrared. Wait, but the question is asking for the longest, which would be radio waves. So the correct answer should be option C.

I should double-check. Radio waves have longer wavelengths than microwaves, right? Yes, because microwaves are higher frequency than radio waves. Frequency and wavelength are inversely related (since speed of light is constant, c = λν). So higher frequency means shorter wavelength. So radio waves have longer λ than microwaves and the others.

So the answer is C.

The electromagnetic spectrum is ordered by wavelength, from longest to shortest: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Among the options given, radio waves (option C) have the longest wavelength.

Answer: C
