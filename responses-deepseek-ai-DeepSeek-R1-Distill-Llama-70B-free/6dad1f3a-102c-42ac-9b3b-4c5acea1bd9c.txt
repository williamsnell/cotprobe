Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about electrolysis, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the electrolysis of molten magnesium bromide, and what products we should expect at the cathode and anode.

Hmm, I remember that electrolysis involves passing an electric current through a compound to break it down into its elements. The setup usually has two electrodes: the cathode (where reduction happens) and the anode (where oxidation occurs). Since magnesium bromide is a salt, when it's molten, it should dissociate into its ions. So, MgBr2 would split into Mg²+ and Br⁻ ions.

Wait, wait. Actually, MgBr2 is a strong electrolyte, so in the molten state, it breaks down into Mg²+ and Br⁻ ions. So during electrolysis, the cations go to the cathode and the anions to the anode.

At the cathode, reduction occurs. The available ions are Mg²+ and maybe H+ if there's water, but since it's molten MgBr2, I don't think water is involved. So the Mg²+ ions will gain electrons to become Mg metal. So the cathode should produce magnesium.

At the anode, oxidation happens. The anions present are Br⁻. So each Br⁻ loses an electron to form Br2. So bromine gas should be released at the anode.

Wait, but sometimes in aqueous solutions, you have to consider OH⁻ ions for the anode, but here it's molten, so only Br⁻ is present. So yes, Br⁻ will oxidize to Br2.

So putting it together: at the cathode, Mg²+ + 2e⁻ → Mg. At the anode, 2 Br⁻ → Br2 + 2e⁻.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one says Mg at the cathode and Br2 at the anode.

Let me scan the options:

Option D: magnesium at cathode and bromine at anode. That's D.

Looking at the other options. Option G says Mg at cathode and O2 at anode, but O2 isn't involved here because it's molten, not aqueous. Option I says Mg at anode—no, because Mg²+ goes to the cathode. Option D seems right.

The electrolysis of molten magnesium bromide involves the dissociation of MgBr₂ into Mg²⁺ and Br⁻ ions. During electrolysis, the Mg²⁺ ions are reduced at the cathode to form magnesium metal, while the Br⁻ ions are oxidized at the anode to form bromine gas (Br₂). 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly states that magnesium is produced at the cathode and bromine at the anode.
- Other options, such as **G** and **I**, incorrectly involve oxygen or reverse the electrode products, which are not relevant for the electrolysis of molten MgBr₂.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
