Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a man on a turntable. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with rotational motion and conservation of angular momentum. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that the man is holding weights in each hand, and he's rotating. When he drops his hands, the weights move closer to his body—or wait, no, actually, the question says the final distance is 6 inches. Oh, wait, wait, the original distance was 3 feet, which is 36 inches, right? So when he drops his hands, the weights move closer. Wait, no—oh wait, no, no. Wait, the original distance is 3 ft, which is 3 feet, so that's 36 inches. Then the final distance is 6 inches, which is 0.5 ft. Wait, but that seems like the weights are moving inward. So the man is bringing the weights closer, which would cause him to spin faster because of conservation of angular momentum.

Wait, but wait, the question says he drops his hands to his sides. Oh, so maybe the weights are moving from 3 ft to 0.5 ft from the axis? Because 6 inches is 0.5 ft. So, that's a big change in the moment of inertia.

Right, angular momentum is conserved because there's no external torque, assuming the turntable is frictionless and all that. So the initial angular momentum equals the final angular momentum.

The initial moment of inertia would be the man's moment plus the two weights. Wait, the man's moment of inertia is given as a constant, 4 slug-ft². So I = I_man + I_weights_initial.

Each weight is 10 lb. Wait, but in physics, mass is in slugs, so I need to convert pounds to slugs. Oh wait, right, because the formula for the moment of inertia involves mass, not force. So 10 lb is the weight, so mass m = weight / g, where g is 32.2 ft/s² approximately. So m = 10 / 32.2 ≈ 0.3106 slugs per weight.

Each weight is at a distance of 3 ft from the axis, so I_weights_initial = 2 * m * r² = 2*(0.3106)*(3)^2. Let me calculate that: 2 * 0.3106 * 9 = 2 * 2.7954 ≈ 5.5908 slug-ft².

So total initial I is 4 + 5.5908 ≈ 9.5908 slug-ft².

His initial angular velocity is one revolution per 2 seconds. I need to convert that to radians per second. One revolution is 2π radians, so ω_initial = 2π / 2 = π rad/s.

Now, when he drops the weights to his sides, the distance becomes 0.5 ft. So I_weights_final = 2 * m * (0.5)^2. Let's compute that: 2 * 0.3106 * 0.25 = 2 * 0.07765 ≈ 0.1553 slug-ft².

So total final I is 4 + 0.1553 = 4.1553 slug-ft².

Because angular momentum L = I * ω is conserved, I_initial * ω_initial = I_final * ω_final.

So ω_final = (I_initial / I_final) * ω_initial.

Plugging the numbers in: (9.5908 / 4.1553) * π.

Let me calculate that division. 9.5908 divided by 4.1553. Let's see:

4.1553 * 2 is 8.3106. So 9.5908 -8.3106 = 1.2802. So that's 2 + (1.2802 /4.1553). 1.2802 /4.1553 is approximately 0.308. So total is about 2.308. So ω_final ≈ 2.308 * π rad/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.67 pi, but that's higher. Option A is 2.13 pi. Hmm, maybe I messed up some calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass or inertia.

Wait, each weight is 10 lb, so mass is 10/32.2 ≈ 0.3106 slugs each. That's correct.

I_weights_initial: 2 * 0.3106 * (3)^2 = 2 * 0.3106 *9 = 2 *2.7954=5.5908. Yes.

I_initial = 4 +5.5908=9.5908.

I_weights_final: 2*0.3106*(0.5)^2= 2 *0.3106 *0.25= 0.1553. Correct.

I_final=4+0.1553=4.1553.

So ratio is 9.5908 /4.1553. Let me compute that more accurately.

4.1553 * 2.3 = let's see: 4.1553 *2 =8.3106; 4.1553 *0.3=1.2466. So 8.3106+1.2466=9.5572. Hmm, which is just a bit less than 9.5908. So 2.3 gives 9.5572, and the difference is 9.5908-9.5572=0.0336.

How much more than 2.3 do we need? 0.0336 /4.1553 ≈ 0.0081. So approximately 2.308. So 2.308 times pi.

Looking at the options, let's see the options given:

A: 2.13 pi

D: 2.67 pi

Wait, I'm getting about 2.308 pi. None of the options exactly match that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial I?

Wait, wait, the question says the man's moment of inertia is constant and equal to 4 slug-ft². So that's I_man =4. The weights are separate.

Wait, when he brings the weights inward, their moment of inertia decreases, so the total I decreases, causing ω to increase.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I_initial and I_final.

Wait, wait, another thought. Wait, the weights are dropped to his sides, but if he's at the center, when he drops his hands, does the distance become zero? No, because the question says the final distance is 6 inches. So 0.5 ft from the axis, so they're at 0.5 ft, not zero.

So the calculations I did should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the conversion from pounds to slugs. Let me double-check that. Weight is 10 lb, so mass is 10/32.2 lb-mass? No, wait, weight W = m * g, so m = W/g, where W is in pounds, and g is 32.2 ft/s².

Yes, so m = 10 /32.2 ≈ 0.3106 slugs. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the initial and final I.

Wait, I_initial is I_man + I_weights_initial =4 +5.5908=9.5908.

I_final is 4 +0.1553=4.1553.

So ratio is 9.5908 /4.1553.

Calculating that exactly:

Let me write it as 9.5908 ÷4.1553.

Hmm, let's do it step by step.

4.1553 x 2 =8.3106 → subtract from 9.5908, gives 1.2802.

Bring down a zero: 12.802 (wait, but this is decimal division).

Wait, 4.1553 into 9.5908.

Divide 9.5908 by 4.1553.

So 4.1553 * 2 =8.3106. 9.5908 -8.3106=1.2802.

Now, 4.1553 goes into 1.2802 how many times? 0.3 times because 4.1553 *0.3=1.2466.

Subtract 1.2466 from 1.2802: gives 0.0336.

Bring down a zero: 0.336.

4.1553 goes into 0.336 about 0.08 times (since 4.1553 *0.08=0.3324).

So total is 2.3 +0.08 = 2.38 approximately. Wait, no, wait, the initial 2 is first, then 0.3, then 0.08.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 9.5908 /4.1553.

Let me approximate:

4.1553 * 2.3 = ?

2 *4.1553=8.3106.

0.3 *4.1553=1.24659.

So 8.3106 +1.24659=9.55719.

Difference: 9.5908 -9.55719=0.03361.

So 0.03361 /4.1553= approx 0.00809.

So total is 2.3 +0.00809=2.30809.

So 2.308 * pi ≈ 7.25 rad/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 2.67 pi (which is about 8.39 rad/s), which is higher than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Wait, the initial angular velocity is one revolution per 2 seconds. So ω_initial = (2π rad) / 2 sec = π rad/s. Correct.

Wait, but wait, the man's moment of inertia is 4 slug-ft², but when he brings the weights in, does that affect his own moment of inertia? The question says that the man's moment of inertia is constant, so that's fixed at 4. So that part is correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the initial moment of inertia of the weights. Let me recalculate that.

Each weight is 10 lb, so mass m = 10 /32.2 = approx 0.3106 slugs.

Initial distance from axis r_initial =3 ft.

So I_weights_initial = 2 * m * r² = 2*(0.3106)*(3)^2 = 2 *0.3106*9 =5.5908.

Yes, that's correct.

Final r is 0.5 ft. So I_weights_final = 2 *0.3106*(0.5)^2= 0.1553.

So I think the calculations are correct.

So ω_final is 2.308 * pi rad/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 2.67 pi. Wait, but that's higher than 2.3. Hmm, perhaps I did a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial and final moments are mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, initial I is 9.5908, final I is 4.1553. So ratio is bigger than 2, so ω increases.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the ratio. Wait, 9.5908 divided by 4.1553.

Let me compute 4.1553 *2.3 =9.557, which is less than 9.5908.

The difference is 9.5908-9.557=0.0338.

So 0.0338 /4.1553 ≈0.00813.

So 2.308, which is approximately 2.31 pi.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.13 pi, which is 2.13, which is less than 2.3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Wait, the weights are 10 lb each, so combined 20 lb. So mass is 20/32.2 =0.6211 slugs total.

Wait, but wait, no, each weight is 10 lb, so each is 0.3106 slugs. So two weights: 0.6211 slugs.

Wait, but when calculating the moment of inertia, it's 2 * m * r². So for initial I, 2*(0.3106)*(3)^2. Wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial angular velocity was wrong. The problem says one revolution in 2 seconds, so ω_initial is 2π/2= pi rad/s. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio again.

I_initial =4 + (2 *0.3106 *9) =4 +5.5908=9.5908.

I_final =4 + (2 *0.3106 *0.25)=4 +0.1553=4.1553.

So ratio I_initial/I_final =9.5908/4.1553= approximately 2.308.

So ω_final =2.308 * pi.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:2.67 pi, but that's higher. Wait, that's 2.67, which is 0.36 higher than 2.3.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation of the moments.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute I_initial and I_final again.

I_initial = I_man + 2*(m*r^2) =4 + 2*(10/32.2)*3^2.

Wait, 10 lb is each weight, so each is 10/32.2 slugs. So 2*(10/32.2)*3^2 = 2*(10/32.2)*9 = (20*9)/32.2 = 180/32.2 ≈5.5908. So same as before.

I_final =4 + 2*(10/32.2)*(0.5)^2=4 +2*(10/32.2)*0.25=4 + (20 *0.25)/32.2=4 +5/32.2=4 +0.1553=4.1553.

So the ratio is 9.5908/4.1553=2.308.

Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded. Let me see the given options again.

Options:

A: 2.13 pi

B:1.2 pi

C:4 pi

D:2.67 pi

E:3.2 pi

F:1.5 pi

G:3 pi

H:1.75 pi

I:2.5 pi

J:2.8 pi

Wait, none of these exactly match 2.308 pi. So perhaps the correct answer is not among them, but that can't be. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial I. Wait, the initial I is the man's I plus the weights' I. The man is 4 slug-ft², and the two weights each contribute m r².

Wait, no, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question says the original distance is 3 ft, and final is 6 inches, but I thought 6 inches is 0.5 ft. But wait, wait, 6 inches is 0.5 ft, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I_initial. Let me compute it again.

I_initial =4 + 2*(10/32.2)*(3)^2.

Compute 3^2:9.

10/32.2=0.3106.

2 *0.3106 *9 = 5.5908.

So 4+5.5908=9.5908.

Yes.

I_final=4 +2*(10/32.2)*(0.5)^2.

0.5^2=0.25.

So 2*0.3106 *0.25=0.1553.

4 +0.1553=4.1553.

So the ratio is 9.5908/4.1553=2.308.

So ω_final=2.308 pi.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:2.67 pi, but that's higher. Option I is 2.5 pi.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the ratio.

Wait, 9.5908 divided by 4.1553.

Let me compute it more accurately.

4.1553 * 2 =8.3106. Subtract from 9.5908: 1.2802 remains.

Now, 4.1553 * 0.3=1.24659. Subtract from 1.2802: 0.03361 remains.

So 0.03361 /4.1553=approximately 0.008085.

So total is 2.308085. So approximately 2.308 pi.

But none of the options is close to that. Hmm. Maybe I should check if I've misread the question.

Wait, the problem states that the original distance is 3 ft, and the final is 6 in. So 3 ft to 0.5 ft. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the man's moment of inertia is 4, but when he brings the weights in, does his own moment of inertia change? The question says it's constant, so no.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the man plus weights as a system, and the man's I is 4, but when he brings the weights in, perhaps the I changes more. Wait, but no, the weights' I depends on their distance.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the ratio again.

I_initial =4 + (2 *10/32.2 *3^2) =4 + (2*0.3106*9)=4+5.5908=9.5908.

I_final=4 + (2 *10/32.2 *0.5^2)=4 + (2*0.3106*0.25)=4+0.1553=4.1553.

So the ratio is 9.5908 /4.1553=2.308.

So ω_final=2.308 pi rad/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:2.67 pi (which is 2.67*3.14=8.39) and option I:2.5 pi (7.85). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial units.

Wait, wait, perhaps the man's initial angular velocity is 1 revolution per 2 seconds. So that's (2π rad)/2 s = π rad/s. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps the answer options are given in terms of multiples of pi, so 2.308 pi is approximately 2.3 pi. But the options don't have
