Question:

A woman leased a condo from the owner for a period of one year. After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?

Options:

A: After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.
B: Because the woman had indicated her intention to stay by remodeling the kitchen, the owner cannot revoke the option to purchase.
C: Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.
D: Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.
E: Because the woman had started using the condo as her own by remodeling it, this signified her acceptance of the purchase option.
F: Because the woman had lived in the condo for more than half the lease period, she has the right to purchase the property.
G: Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.
H: Because the owner had given written option to purchase the condo, the owner cannot revoke it unilaterally.
I: Because the woman had spent a significant amount on remodeling the kitchen, she had vested interest in the property thus forming an enforceable contract.
J: Because the woman had received written approval from the owner for remodeling, this constituted as acceptance of the purchase option.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the situation is that a woman leased a condo for a year. After six months, the owner gave her a written option to buy the condo for $100k before the lease ended. She then spent $10k remodeling the kitchen with the owner's approval. A month before the lease ended, the owner revoked the option. A week later, she tried to accept the option, but he refused. Now she's suing for breach of contract. The question is about her strongest argument that a contract was formed.

Hmm. I remember that an option in contract law is typically an offer that's kept open by consideration. So, normally, an offer can be revoked unless it's an option where the offeror is bound not to revoke for a certain period. But here, the woman didn't pay for the option separately; she just leased the place and then got the option. So maybe the consideration comes from her actions after getting the option?

Wait, she spent $10k on remodeling. Does that count as consideration for the option? Or is it part of the lease? The owner approved the remodeling, so maybe that's an issue. I think that when someone detrimentally relies on an offer, it can make the offer irrevocable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. So if she relied on the option to her detriment by spending money, the owner can't revoke it.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A says that after remodeling, an option contract resulted because the owner knew she was relying to her detriment. That sounds like promissory estoppel. The idea is that even without consideration, if the offeree relies in a way that the offeror expected, the offer can't be revoked.

Option B says because she remodeled, the owner can't revoke. But I think it's more about reliance than just the act of remodeling. So maybe B is too simplistic.

Option C mentions the owner being a merchant and the offer being irrevocable for up to three months. I don't recall the scenario stating the owner is a merchant. Also, the written offer's irrevocability under UCC might apply, but I don't think it's the case here.

Option D says the offer invited a return promise, and she accepted by remodeling. But acceptance is usually a return promise, not an action like remodeling. So D might not be right.

Option E says remodeling signified acceptance. No, acceptance is usually when you agree to the terms. She didn't accept yet; she just remodeled. So E might confuse acceptance with reliance.

Option F talks about living there more than half the lease. I don't see how that gives her a right to purchase. The option is separate from the lease.

Option G says she had until the lease ended to accept, so the revocation was ineffective. Wait, the owner revoked a month before the lease ended, and she tried to accept a week later. Normally, an option without consideration can be revoked unless it's within the time period. But without consideration, the offer could be revoked. Unless there's something making it irrevocable. So if the offer was open until the lease ended, and she accepted within that time, but the owner revoked it earlier, maybe that's an issue.

Option H says because it's a written option, the owner can't revoke unilaterally. But written options can usually be revoked unless there's consideration. So H might not be correct unless the option itself was supported by consideration, which I don't think is the case here.

Option I says she has a vested interest because she spent a lot. I'm not sure about that. Vested interests usually come when the contract is formed. But if the contract isn't formed yet, spending money might not give her a vested interest, but it could be part of promissory estoppel.

Option J says the approval for remodeling was acceptance. No, because she didn't accept the option; she just got permission to remodel. So J is probably wrong.

So, going back, the strongest argument is probably based on promissory estoppel. She relied on the offer to her detriment by spending money, and the owner knew about it. So option A says that. Option G is about the time limit, but if the offer wasn't supported by consideration, the owner could revoke it even before the lease ended, unless it's within the option period. Since she tried to accept within the option period, but the owner revoked it before, maybe that's an issue. But I think the better argument is that the owner can't revoke because of her reliance (promissory estoppel), making option A correct.

Wait, but wait. The option was given as a written offer. Under the common law, offers can be revoked unless there's consideration for the option. Here, the option was part of the lease agreement perhaps? Or maybe the remodeling counts as consideration. If she spent $10k with the owner's approval, maybe that's the consideration for the option, making it a valid option contract that can't be revoked.

Oh, wait, under contract law, an option requires consideration to be enforceable. If she gave up something (like spending money) in exchange for the option, then it's a valid option that can't be revoked. So maybe the remodeling was the consideration.

In that case, the option is binding, and the owner can't revoke it. So looking at the options, which one covers that.

Option A talks about reliance, which is promissory estoppel. Option I talks about vested interest due to spending, but that's not the same as consideration.

Alternatively, maybe the remodeling was done with the owner's permission, so it could be seen as part of the consideration for the option. So the option was supported by consideration, making it irrevocable. So in that case, when the owner revoked, he was in breach.

Looking at the options, option H says because it's a written option, the owner can't revoke it. But written alone doesn't make it irrevocable without consideration. So if the remodeling was the consideration, then the option is binding, and the owner can't revoke.

But none of the options directly state that the remodeling was consideration. Option A is about reliance, which is a different concept.

Wait, so the question is about which argument is her strongest. If the option was supported by consideration, that's a stronger argument than promissory estoppel. So perhaps the remodeling was the consideration.

But she spent the money after the option was given. So the timing matters. Was the $10k a modification supported by consideration? Or was it part of the original lease?

Alternatively, maybe the option was given during the lease, and she spent the money in reliance on the option, which makes the offer irrevocable under promissory estoppel. So in that case, the option couldn't be revoked because she relied on it.

So between A and H. H says because it's a written option, can't revoke. But I think without consideration, the written option can still be revoked. So H is incorrect.

So the best argument is A, that the owner knew she was relying to her detriment, making the option irrevocable under promissory estoppel.

Wait, but some sources say that when an offer is for a sale of real property, the option is enforceable without consideration if the offeree substantially changes position in reliance. So maybe that applies here.

In that case, the woman's strongest argument would be based on promissory estoppel, making option A correct.

Alternatively, if the remodeling was with the owner's permission, perhaps that's sufficient to make the option irrevocable because it shows reliance.

So I think the answer is A.

The question revolves around whether an enforceable contract was formed when the woman tried to accept the owner's option to purchase the condo after the owner revoked it. The key issue is whether the owner's revocation was valid or if the option remained irrevocable due to the woman's reliance or actions.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: This argues that the woman's $10,000 expenditure on remodeling, done with the owner's knowledge and approval, constitutes detrimental reliance on the option. Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, an offer can become irrevocable if the offeree relies on it to their detriment, and the offeror expects such reliance. This is a strong argument because the woman's actions demonstrate reliance on the option.

- **Option B**: While remodeling might indicate the woman's intention to stay, this option oversimplifies the situation. The ability to revoke an option depends on legal principles like consideration or promissory estoppel, not just the act of remodeling.

- **Option C**: This incorrectly assumes the owner is a merchant and invokes UCC rules about irrevocable offers. However, the scenario does not indicate the owner is a merchant, and the UCC does not apply here.

- **Option D**: This suggests that remodeling constituted acceptance, but acceptance typically requires a clear manifestation of intent to accept the offer, not just actions like remodeling.

- **Option E**: This conflates remodeling with acceptance. Remodeling alone does not signify acceptance; it is better understood as reliance.

- **Option F**: Living in the condo for more than half the lease period does not grant a right to purchase unless explicitly agreed upon, which is not the case here.

- **Option G**: While the option was open until the lease expired, the owner's revocation before the woman accepted raises questions about whether the revocation was valid. However, this option does not address why the revocation was ineffective, making it weaker than Option A.

- **Option H**: A written option alone does not make it irrevocable unless supported by consideration. Without consideration, the owner could revoke the option, so this argument is insufficient.

- **Option I**: Spending money on remodeling does not automatically create a vested interest in the property. This argument is weaker than promissory estoppel.

- **Option J**: Approval for remodeling does not constitute acceptance of the purchase option. Acceptance requires a clear manifestation of intent to accept the offer.

### Conclusion:
The strongest argument is **Option A**, as it relies on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The woman spent $10,000 on remodeling with the owner's knowledge and approval, demonstrating detrimental reliance on the option. This makes the owner's revocation inequitable and the option irrevocable.
