Okay, so I've got this electromagnetic wave problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem states that a plane wave is traveling in a medium where the relative permeability (mu_r) and relative permittivity (epsilon_r) are both 1. The conductivity sigma is 0.1 mho/m (which I think is the same as S/m). The frequency is 1590 MHz. The electric field intensity is 10 V/m. I need to find the conduction current density, the displacement current density, and the total current density. Then, among the options A to J, I have to choose which one is correct.

Hmm, right. So, let's break this down. I remember that in a medium, the current density has two components: conduction current and displacement current. The conduction current is due to the free charges moving under the influence of the electric field, and the displacement current is due to the time-varying electric field.

The formulas I think I need are:
1. Conduction current density J_c = sigma * E
2. Displacement current density J_d = epsilon * (dE/dt)
3. The total current density J = J_c + J_d

Wait, but wait. Actually, I think the displacement current density is the derivative of the electric displacement D. Oh right, displacement current density is the time derivative of D. So J_d = dD/dt.

But D is epsilon times E, right? So D = epsilon * E. So dD/dt would be epsilon times dE/dt.

But wait, in this problem, E is the electric field intensity, which is sinusoidal. So I should probably represent E as a phasor, since we're dealing with AC here. Because the wave is a plane wave, so E is varying sinusoidally with time.

Let me think about the phasor notation. The electric field can be written as E(t) = E0 * cos(omega t + phi). But when using phasors, we represent this as a complex exponential, so E = E0 e^{j(omega t + phi)}}. But for this problem, I think we can assume that the phase is zero unless stated otherwise, so E(t) = E0 cos(omega t).

Wait, but when dealing with phasors in AC circuits, the current and voltage are represented as phasors, and the derivatives become j omega times the phasor. So in this case, the displacement current density would involve j omega times the permittivity and the electric field phasor.

Wait, but let's get the parameters straight. The medium has mu_r = 1, so mu = mu_0 * mu_r = mu_0. Similarly, epsilon_r = 1, so epsilon = epsilon_0 * epsilon_r = epsilon_0. Okay. So the intrinsic impedance of the medium is eta = sqrt(mu/epsilon) = sqrt(mu_0/epsilon_0) = eta_0, the impedance of free space, which is about 377 ohms. But maybe that's more than I need right now.

So first, let's compute the conduction current density J_c. That's straightforward: J_c = sigma * E. Wait, but E here is the peak value? Or the rms? Hmm, in the problem statement, the electric field intensity is given as 10 V/m. I think that's the peak value, but sometimes it's the rms. Oh wait, in electromagnetics, when they give the electric field of a wave, they usually state it as the peak value unless specified otherwise. So I think E is 10 V/m peak.

So J_c = sigma * E = 0.1 S/m * 10 V/m = 1 A/m². Wait, because S is the unit of conductance, which is inverse resistance. So mho is S, right. So 0.1 S/m times 10 V/m gives 1 A/m². So part (a) would be 1 A/m². Looking at the options, option D has (a) as 1, and option I has (a) 1.5, etc.

Wait, but let me check the units again. Sigma is in mho/m, which is S/m. E is V/m. So J_c is S/m * V/m = (S*V)/(m²). But since S is A/V, so S*V is A. So (A)/(m²), which is A/m². So yeah, 0.1 *10=1 A/m².

So (a) is 1 A/m². Now, looking at the options, let's see which ones have part (a)=1. Looking, option D says (a) 1 Amp/m², and option I's (a) is 1.5, so no. So possibly D is the answer, but let's check.

Next, part (b) is the displacement current density J_d. So J_d is the time derivative of D. D is epsilon * E, so dD/dt = epsilon * dE/dt.

Since E is varying sinusoidally, E(t) = E0 cos(omega t). So dE/dt = -E0 omega sin(omega t).

But wait, in phasor notation, the derivative d/dt corresponds to j omega. So when using phasors, J_d = j omega epsilon E.

Wait, but let's think in terms of phasors. The displacement current density J_d is equal to j omega epsilon E, where E is the phasor. But since E is 10 V/m, the peak value, in phasor form, E = 10 e^{j0} V/m.

So J_d = j omega epsilon E. But wait, let me compute the numerical value.

First, compute omega. The frequency is given as 1590 MHz, which is 1.59e9 Hz. So omega = 2 pi f = 2 * pi * 1.59e9 ≈ 1e10 rad/s. Wait, let me compute 2*pi*1.59e9: 1.59e9 is approx 1.59 * 1e9, multiply by 2*pi, that's about 9.96e9, roughly 1e10 rad/s.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately: 1.59 * 1e9 = 1,590,000,000 Hz. 2 * pi *1.59e9 = approx 9.96e9 rad/s. So omega ≈ 1e10 rad/s.

Now, epsilon is epsilon_0, which is approximately 8.85e-12 F/m.

So J_d = j omega epsilon E. Let's plug the numbers in.

omega is approx 1e10 rad/s, epsilon is 8.85e-12 F/m, and E is 10 V/m.

So J_d = j * 1e10 * 8.85e-12 * 10 = j * 8.85e-2 = j * 0.0885 A/m².

Wait, but that's the magnitude. So the displacement current density is 0.0885 A/m², and since it's j times that, it's leading the conduction current by 90 degrees, because J_d is purely imaginary.

Wait, but in terms of sinusoidal functions, if J_c is in phase with E, then J_d, being the derivative of E, leads by 90 degrees. So J_d would be proportional to sin(omega t + 90 degrees), which is cos(omega t), but in phasor terms, it's j times.

Wait, but wait. The phasor for J_d is j omega epsilon E. So when converting back to time domain, J_d(t) would be the real part of J_d phasor e^{j omega t}, which would be 0.0885 cos(omega t + 90°), which is the same as 0.0885 sin(omega t + 180° + 90°)? Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently.

Wait, J_d in phasor form is j * (omega epsilon E). So when taking the real part, Re[J_d e^{j omega t}] is equal to omega epsilon E sin(omega t), because j is equivalent to e^{j pi/2}, so multiplying by e^{j omega t} gives e^{j (omega t + pi/2)}, whose real part is cos(omega t + pi/2), which is -sin(omega t). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express J_d in terms of its sinusoidal form. Since E(t) = E0 cos(omega t), then dE/dt = -E0 omega sin(omega t). So D = epsilon E(t) = epsilon E0 cos(omega t). So dD/dt = -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t).

So J_d(t) = dD/dt = -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t). But the negative sign indicates that J_d is out of phase with E by 90 degrees. So in terms of a phasor, this would be represented as J_d = -j epsilon E0 omega.

Wait, but I'm getting a little tangled here. Let me think again: E(t) = E0 cos(omega t). Then, dE/dt = -E0 omega sin(omega t). So D(t) = epsilon E(t) = epsilon E0 cos(omega t), so dD/dt = -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t). Therefore, J_d(t) = -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t) = epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t + pi), because adding pi shifts it by 180 degrees.

But wait, when expressed as a phasor, the amplitude is J_d = epsilon E0 omega e^{j (pi/2)}, because the sine function leads by 90 degrees compared to cosine. Wait, no. Let's see: cos(theta) is the real part, and sin(theta) is the imaginary part, which is leading by 90 degrees. So, if E is cos(omega t), then dE/dt is -omega sin(omega t), which is -omega Im[e^{j omega t}]. So in phasor terms, dE/dt = -j omega E_phasor.

So, J_d = epsilon * dE/dt = -j omega epsilon E_phasor.

So the phasor for J_d is -j omega epsilon E. Therefore, the magnitude is omega epsilon E, and the phase is -90 degrees, or 270 degrees, which is equivalent to saying it's leading E by 90 degrees.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me compute the numerical value again. E is 10 V/m, omega is approx 1e10 rad/s, epsilon is 8.85e-12 F/m.

So the magnitude of J_d is omega * epsilon * E = 1e10 * 8.85e-12 * 10.

Calculating that: 1e10 * 8.85e-12 = 8.85e-2. Multiply by 10 gives 0.885 A/m².

Wait, wait a minute! Earlier I thought it was about 0.0885, but now I'm getting 0.885. Which is correct?

Wait, no, let's recompute: omega is 2 pi f. f is 1590 MHz, which is 1.59e9 Hz. So omega = 2 * pi * 1.59e9 ≈ 1e10 rad/s? Let me check:

2 * pi * 1.59e9 = approx 9.96e9 rad/s, which is about 1e10 rad/s. So 1e10 is a rounded value.

So J_d's magnitude is (1e10 rad/s) * (8.85e-12 F/m) * (10 V/m) = 1e10 * 8.85e-12 *10.

Compute the exponents: 1e10 * 1e-12 is 1e-2. 8.85 *10 is 88.5. So 88.5e-2 is 0.885 A/m².

Wait, so that's 0.885 A/m². Hmm. But wait, I thought earlier I got 0.0885, but that was a miscalculation. So correct value is 0.885 A/m². Okay, so J_d is 0.885 A/m², and it's leading by 90 degrees because it's the derivative of E.

Wait, but in terms of current density, the displacement current J_d is a current that's in phase with the derivative of E, which means it's 90 degrees leading relative to E. So in terms of sinusoidal functions, if E is cos(omega t), then J_d is proportional to sin(omega t), which can be written as cos(omega t - pi/2), or as sin(omega t), which is leading by 90 degrees.

So in the options, the displacement current density (part b) should be expressed as something like 0.88 sin(omega t + phase). Let's see, in option D, part (b) is 0.883 sin(omega t + pi/2) A/m².

Wait, because if J_d is proportional to sin(omega t), which is the same as cos(omega t - pi/2), but expressed as a sine with a phase shift. Alternatively, if the phase is pi/2, then sin(omega t + pi/2) is equal to cos(omega t), which is in phase with E. Wait, no, that can't be right because J_d should lead E by 90 degrees.

Wait, no, E is cos(omega t), and dE/dt is -sin(omega t), so J_d is proportional to -sin(omega t), which is the same as sin(omega t + pi), but as a phasor, it's -j times the E phasor. So in terms of magnitude and phase, J_d would have a magnitude of 0.885 A/m² and a phase of -90 degrees, or 270 degrees, which can also be written as +270 degrees or -90 degrees.

But when expressing it as a sine function, sin(theta + pi) is the same as -sin(theta), so J_d(t) = 0.885 sin(omega t + pi/2 + pi) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express J_d in terms of its phasor representation. So J_d has a magnitude of 0.885 A/m² and a phase that leads E by 90 degrees. So if E is represented as a phasor with 0 degrees, J_d would be at +90 degrees, which is j times E's phasor.

Wait, but earlier I thought J_d was -j omega epsilon E, which would mean a phase of -90 degrees. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me go back. E(t) = E0 cos(omega t). So dE/dt = -E0 omega sin(omega t). So D(t) = epsilon E(t) = epsilon E0 cos(omega t), so dD/dt = -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t). Therefore, J_d(t) = dD/dt = -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t).

So J_d is proportional to -sin(omega t), which can be written as sin(omega t + pi). So in phasor terms, that would be represented as J_d_phasor = -epsilon E0 omega j^0? Wait, no. Let me think about phasors again.

In phasor notation, E(t) = Re[E_phasor e^{j omega t}], and dE/dt would be Re[ j omega E_phasor e^{j omega t} } ].

So, D(t) = epsilon E(t), so D_phasor = epsilon E_phasor. Therefore, dD/dt corresponds to j omega D_phasor, so J_d_phasor = j omega epsilon E_phasor.

Wait, but in our case, E_phasor is E0 (since E(t) = E0 cos(omega t) implies E_phasor = E0). So J_d_phasor = j omega epsilon E0.

Thus, J_d_phasor is a purely imaginary current, leading E_phasor by 90 degrees.

So when converting back to time domain, J_d(t) = Re[ J_d_phasor e^{j omega t} ] = Re[ j omega epsilon E0 e^{j omega t} } ].

j is e^{j pi/2}, so this becomes Re[ omega epsilon E0 e^{j (omega t + pi/2)} ] = omega epsilon E0 cos(omega t + pi/2).

But cos(theta + pi/2) is equal to -sin(theta), so J_d(t) = -omega epsilon E0 sin(omega t).

Wait, so J_d(t) is equal to -omega epsilon E0 sin(omega t). So in terms of the options given, the displacement current density is a sine wave with a phase of pi/2, but negative. Wait, no, because the expression is -sin(omega t), which is the same as sin(omega t + pi).

So perhaps in the options, it's expressed as a sine function with a phase shift. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option D: part (b) is 0.883 sin(omega t + pi/2) A/m². Wait, 0.883 is close to 0.885, which is our computed value. So the magnitude is about 0.88 A/m².

Wait, but according to our calculation, J_d(t) is -0.885 sin(omega t), which is 0.885 sin(omega t + pi). So in the options, if a part (b) is expressed as 0.883 sin(omega t + pi/2), that would mean it's leading by 90 degrees, but positive, whereas our result is leading by 180 degrees, which is a negative sine wave.

Hmm, that's conflicting. Did I make a mistake in the sign?

Wait, let's double-check the expression for J_d. So J_d = dD/dt. Since D = epsilon E, and E = E0 cos(omega t), then D = epsilon E0 cos(omega t). So dD/dt = -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t). Therefore, J_d(t) is negative of that, which is -epsilon E0 omega sin(omega t) = -0.885 sin(omega t).

So that's equivalent to 0.885 sin(omega t + pi), because sin(theta + pi
