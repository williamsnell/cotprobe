Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Erik Erikson's theory. Hmm, I remember that Erikson proposed a series of psychosocial stages, each with its own challenge or conflict. Each stage is associated with a specific age and a particular virtue or outcome.

The question is asking about people who look back on their lives with regret and feel unfulfilled. So, I think this relates to the last stage of Erikson's theory. Let me recall the stages:

1. Trust vs. Mistrust (infancy)
2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (toddler)
3. Initiative vs. Guilt (early school age)
4. Industry vs. Inferiority (later school age)
5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (adolescence)
6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)
7. Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood)
8. Integrity vs. Despair (late adulthood)

Right, the eighth stage is Integrity versus Despair. So, in this stage, individuals reflect on their lives. If they feel a sense of fulfillment and integrity, they successfully resolve this stage. But if they feel regret and that their life lacked meaning, they experience despair.

The question is about unsuccessful resolution, so the correct stage would be Integrity vs. Despair. Looking at the options, option D is integrity versus despair. The other options are earlier stages: for example, option B is intimacy vs. isolation, which is about relationships in young adulthood.

So the answer should be D.

The question pertains to Erikson's psychosocial stages, specifically the stage where individuals reflect on their life's fulfillment. The eighth stage, Integrity versus Despair, deals with late adulthood, where people either feel fulfilled (integrity) or regretful (despair). The correct answer is D: integrity versus despair.

Answer: D
