Okay, so I have this math problem here: compute (1/3) percent of 1,109. Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on percentages, but I'll try to remember.

First, I think percentages are parts per hundred. So when they say (1/3)%, that's like saying (1/3) per hundred. Wait, no, actually, 1% is 1 per 100, so (1/3)% would be (1/3) divided by 100, right? Or maybe I should think of it as a decimal first.

Wait, maybe I should convert the percentage to a decimal to make it easier. So (1/3) percent as a decimal would be (1/3) divided by 100. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 3 is approximately 0.3333... So 0.3333 divided by 100 is 0.003333... So that's about 0.003333.

Now, I need to find this percentage of 1,109. So that's 1,109 multiplied by 0.003333. Let's do the multiplication.

Let me write this out: 1,109 * 0.003333. Hmm, alternatively, maybe I can compute 1,109 divided by 300 because 1/3% is the same as 1 divided by 300? Wait, wait a second. Because 1% is 1/100, so (1/3)% is (1/3)/100, which is 1/(3*100) = 1/300. So yes, (1/3)% is equal to 1/300.

So instead of multiplying by 0.003333, I can just divide 1,109 by 300. Let me try that. 1,109 divided by 300.

Well, 300 times 3 is 900, subtract that from 1,109, I get 209 left. Then 300 goes into 209 zero times, so I add a decimal point. 300 goes into 2090 how many times? Let's see, 300*6 is 1800, which leaves 290. 300*7 is 2100, which is too much. So 6 times. 6*300 is 1800, subtract from 2090 leaves 290.

Bring down a zero: 2900. 300 goes into 2900 nine times because 9*300 is 2700. Subtract, 200 left. Bring down another zero: 2000. 300 goes into 2000 six times (6*300=1800). Subtract, leaves 200 again. So we're seeing a pattern here.

So putting it all together, 1,109 / 300 is 3.696666... and so on. So approximately 3.6967.

Wait, but let me check my math again. Because 300 * 3.6967 is 300*(3 + 0.6967) = 900 + 300*0.6967. 300 * 0.6 is 180, 300 * 0.0967 is approx 29.01. So 180+29.01=209.01, so total 900+209.01=1109.01. Oh, that's close to 1,109, so that makes sense.

So the result is approximately 3.6967. Now, looking at the options, which one is closest to this value?

Looking at the options:

A: 0.553 → too small.

B: 0.3697 → also too small.

C: 7.218 → Hmm, that's higher than my result.

D:3.6597 → Close to my 3.6967.

E:1.109 → No.

F:4.219 → Higher.

G:6.993 → Also higher.

H:11.09 → Way too high.

I:2.8145 → Lower than my result.

J:5.0948 → Higher.

Wait, so my result is 3.6967, and the closest option is D:3.6597. Let me check if I made a calculation error. Maybe I should compute 1,109 * 0.003333.

Let me do that. 1,109 * 0.003333.

Let me compute 1,109 * 0.003. 0.003 is 3 thousandths. 1,000 * 0.003 is 3, 109*0.003 is 0.327. So total is 3 + 0.327 = 3.327.

Now, the remaining part is 0.000333... So 1,109 * 0.000333.

1,109 * 0.0003 is 0.3327, and 1,109 * 0.0000333 is approximately 0.036963. Adding them together: 0.3327 + 0.036963 ≈ 0.36966.

So total is 3.327 + 0.36966 ≈ 3.69666, which matches my earlier calculation.

So the correct value is approximately 3.6967. Now looking back, option D is 3.6597, which is a bit lower. Wait, am I sure about my calculation? Because 1/3% is 0.003333...

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1,109 * (1/3) / 100.

(1/3) is approximately 0.333333. So 0.333333/100 is 0.0033333.

So 1,109 * 0.0033333 = ?

Let me compute 1,109 * 0.003 = 3.327.

Then 1,109 * 0.0003333 = let's approximate.

1,109 * 0.0003 = 0.3327.

1,109 * 0.0000333 ≈ 0.036963.

Adding those gives 0.36966.

So total is 3.327 + 0.36966 = 3.69666.

So about 3.6967, which is 3.6967. Looking at the options, the closest is D:3.6597. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1,109 * (1/3) divided by 100.

Alternatively, 1/3 percent of 1,109 can be calculated as (1,109 × 1) / (3 × 100) = 1,109 / 300.

Which is what I did earlier, giving approximately 3.6967.

Looking at the options, D is 3.6597, which is a bit off. Wait, perhaps I should check if the options are correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me compute 1,109 / 300 more accurately.

300 × 3 = 900.

1,109 - 900 = 209.

So it's 3 and 209/300.

209 divided by 300.

Let me compute 209 ÷ 300.

300 goes into 209 zero times. Add a decimal.

300 goes into 2090 six times (6 × 300 = 1800). 2090-1800=290.

Bring down a zero: 2900.

300 goes into 2900 nine times (9 × 300=2700). 2900-2700=200.

Bring down a zero: 2000.

300 goes into 2000 six times (6 ×300=1800). 2000-1800=200.

So the pattern repeats: 6, 9, 6, 9, etc.

So 209/300 = 0.696666...

So 3 + 0.696666... = 3.696666..., which is 3.6967 when rounded to four decimal places.

So the exact value is approximately 3.6967.

Looking at the options again:

Option D:3.6597 is 3.6597.

Wait, that's about 0.037 less than 3.6967. Hmm, that's a bit of a difference. Let me see if I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1/3) percent of 1,109 as (1,109 × 1) / (3 × 100).

Which is 1,109 ÷ 300. Let me compute 1,109 ÷ 300 using another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 1,109 as 1,100 + 9.

1,100 ÷ 300 = 3.6666...

9 ÷ 300 = 0.03.

So 3.6666... + 0.03 = 3.696666..., which is the same as before.

So same result.

So I'm confident the correct value is approximately 3.6967.

Looking back at the options, D is 3.6597, which is lower, and the next higher option is F:4.219, which is higher. So none of the options exactly match 3.6967. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says (1/3)% of 1,109.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/3 of 1,109, then find 1% of that.

Wait, no. Wait, 1% of 1,109 is 11.09. So (1/3)% would be 11.09 divided by 3, which is approximately 3.6967. So same result.

So the correct answer should be approximately 3.6967. So the closest option is D:3.6597, but that's not very close. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong, or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I should compute 1,109 × (1/3) ÷ 100.

Wait, perhaps 1,109 ÷ 3 is 369.666..., then divided by 100, which is 3.69666..., which is same as before.

So again, same result.

Wait, maybe I should look for any miscalculation. Let me try another approach.

Compute 1,109 × 0.003333333.

Compute 1,109 × 0.003 = 3.327.

1,109 × 0.0003 = 0.3327.

1,109 × 0.0000333 = approximately 0.036963.

Adding them: 3.327 + 0.3327 = 3.6597, plus 0.036963 gives 3.69666.

Wait, wait, that's different. Because 0.003333333 is 0.003 + 0.0003 + 0.0000333.

Wait, but 0.003333333 is 3.33333e-3, which is 0.0033333333.

So 1,109 × 0.0033333333 = let's compute:

1,109 × 0.003 = 3.327.

1,109 × 0.0003333333 = ?

Wait, 0.0003333333 is 1/3000.

So 1,109 × (1/3000) = 1,109 ÷ 3000.

Which is 0.369666...

So 3.327 (from 0.003) plus 0.369666 (from 0.0003333) equals 3.696666..., which matches.

Hmm, but when I compute 1,109 × 0.0003, I get 0.3327, and 0.036963 from 0.0000333. So 0.3327 + 0.036963 is 0.369663. Adding to 3.327 gives 3.696663.

But wait, 0.0003 is 3e-4, and 0.0000333 is 3.3333e-5. So 0.0033333 is 3.3333e-3, which is 0.003 + 0.0003 + 0.0000333.

Wait, but when I compute 1,109 × 0.0033333, it's 3.69666.

But when I compute 1,109 × 0.003, I get 3.327, and 1,109 × 0.0003333 is 0.36966. So 3.327 + 0.36966 = 3.69666.

So no mistake there.

But looking at the options, the closest is D:3.6597.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 1,109 × 0.0003.

Wait, 1,109 × 0.0003 is 0.3327.

And 1,109 × 0.0000333 is 0.036963.

Adding: 0.3327 + 0.036963 = 0.369663.

Adding to 3.327 gives 3.696663.

So the correct result is approximately 3.6967.

Wait, so perhaps none of the options exactly match, but the closest is D:3.6597. But that's off by about 0.037.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.553

B:0.3697

C:7.218

D:3.6597

E:1.109

F:4.219

G:6.993

H:11.09

I:2.8145

J:5.0948

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that can't be, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1/3) percent of 1,109 differently. Let me think: 1% is 11.09, so 1/3 of that is 11.09 ÷ 3 = 3.696666...

Which again matches what I have.

So the correct answer should be approximately 3.6967, but the options don't have that. The closest is D:3.6597, but that's lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check for any miscalculations. Let me compute 1,109 × 0.0033333 more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

1,109 × 0.0033333.

Compute 1,109 × 3.3333e-3.

3.3333e-3 is 0.0033333.

So 1,109 × 0.0033333.

Let me compute this step by step.

1,109 × 0.003 = 3.327.

1,109 × 0.0003 = 0.3327.

1,109 × 0.00003 = 0.03327.

1,109 × 0.000003 = 0.003327.

Wait, but 0.0033333 is 0.003 + 0.0003 + 0.00003 + 0.000003.

So adding all these:

0.003: 3.327.

0.0003: 0.3327.

0.00003: 0.03327.

0.000003: 0.003327.

Adding all four: 3.327 + 0.3327 = 3.6597.

Plus 0.03327 = 3.69297.

Plus 0.003327 = 3.6963.

Wait, so that's 3.6963.

So that's 3.6963, which is approximately 3.6963.

So again, the correct result is approximately 3.6963, which is 3.6963.

Looking at the options, D is 3.6597, which is lower, and the next option is F:4.219, which is higher.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.

The question is to compute (1/3) percent of 1,109.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1% of 1,109, which is 11.09, then divide by 3.

11.09 ÷ 3 is 3.696666..., which is what I got.

So again, the correct answer is 3.6967.

But looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest is D:3.6597, which is 3.6597.

Wait, but 3.6967 is approximately 3.697. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options were intended to have a different value. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I'm reading the options correctly.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option D is 3.6597.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 1,109 × (1/3) first, then find 1% of that.

Wait, 1/3 of 1,109 is 369.666..., then 1% of that is 3.69666..., which is same as before.

So same result.

I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 3.6967, but none of the options match exactly. However, the closest option is D:3.6597. But wait, that's a difference of about 0.037, which is quite a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me try another approach: using fractions.

(1/3) percent is (1/3)/100 = 1/(300).

So 1,109 × 1 / 300 = 1,109 / 300.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

300 into 1,109.

300 × 3 = 900.

1,109 - 900 = 209.

Bring down a 0: 2090.

300 × 6 = 1800.

2090 - 1800 = 290.

Bring down a 0: 2900.

300 × 9 = 2700.

2900 - 2700 = 200.

Bring down a 0: 2000.

300 × 6 = 1800.

2000 - 1800 = 200.

Bring down a 0: 2000 again.

So the pattern repeats, giving 3.696666...

So again, 3.6967.

So I think the correct answer should be 3.6967, but the options don't have that. Unless I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem was (1/3) of 1,109%, which would be different. But that's not what the question says.

The question says (1/3) percent of 1,109, which is (1/3)% ×1,109.

So I think the correct answer is 3.6967, but the options don't
