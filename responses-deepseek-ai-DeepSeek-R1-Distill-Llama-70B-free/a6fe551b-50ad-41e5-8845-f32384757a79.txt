Okay, so I've got this question about monopolistic competition and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see... I remember that monopolistic competition is one of the market structures in economics. I think it's somewhere between perfect competition and monopoly. 

Wait, perfect competition has a lot of firms selling identical products, right? And in monopoly, there's only one seller. So monopolistic competition must be something in between. Oh yeah, I think in monopolistic competition, there are many firms, but they don't sell exactly the same products. Instead, they offer differentiated products. Like how different brands of soda might have similar products but each brand is a bit different.

The question is asking which characteristic is correct. The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Very few competitors. No, I don't think so. Monopolistic competition has many competitors, not very few. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: One firm sets the market price. That sounds more like a monopoly situation where a single firm has pricing power. In monopolistic competition, each firm has some power to set prices but not complete control. So B is likely incorrect.

Option C: Identical products offered by each firm. No, that's perfect competition. Monopolistic competition has product differentiation, so products are similar but not identical. So C is wrong.

Option D: Excess capacity. Hmm, I remember something about firms in monopolistic competition not producing at the lowest possible cost because they have excess capacity. So D could be the right answer.

Option E: Significant barriers to entry. I think that's more of a monopoly thing. Monopolistic competition has relatively easy entry and exit, so E is probably not correct.

Option F: Only one seller in the market. That's a pure monopoly, so F is wrong.

Option G: Firms are price takers. No, that's again perfect competition. In monopolistic competition, firms are price setters because they have some market power, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Homogeneous market demand. I'm not sure about this. Wait, homogeneous demand would mean all consumers see the products as the same, but in monopolistic competition, products are differentiated, so demand is more heterogeneous. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: Pricing at minimum ATC in long run. ATC is average total cost. I think in the long run, firms might not be producing at the minimum ATC because they have excess capacity. So I don't think I is correct.

Option J: Economically efficient in the long run. Economic efficiency would mean producing at the lowest ATC and where marginal cost equals price. But in monopolistic competition, firms might not achieve this because of excess capacity and higher prices than marginal cost. So J is probably wrong.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: Excess capacity. Because in monopolistic competition, firms produce less than the optimal level, leading to excess capacity. This is because each firm's demand is elastic, but not perfectly elastic like in perfect competition. So they can't lower prices without losing customers, but also don't produce up to the point of minimum cost.

The correct answer is D: Excess capacity. Monopolistic competition is characterized by many firms offering differentiated products, leading to each firm operating below its optimal capacity due to the nature of their demand curves. This results in excess capacity, as firms do not produce at the lowest possible cost level.

Answer: D
