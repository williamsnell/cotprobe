Okay, so I have this problem about a tank containing a saturated air-vapor mixture. The conditions are 240°F and 55 psia. The mixture has 1 lb of dry air. I need to find the volume of the tank and the mass of the water vapor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

First, I remember that when dealing with air-vapor mixtures, especially saturated ones, the psychrometric chart might be useful. But wait, I think I can approach this using the ideal gas law, but I'm not sure if it's applicable here.

Wait, the mixture is saturated. That means the air is at its dew point, right? So the partial pressure of the water vapor is equal to the saturation pressure at that temperature. But wait, the pressure given is 55 psia, which is higher than atmospheric pressure. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. The total pressure is 55 psia, and the mixture is saturated. So the partial pressure of the vapor (water) is the saturation pressure at 240°F. But I need to find what that saturation pressure is.

I think I should look up the saturation pressure of water at 240°F. Maybe I can find that in the steam tables. I'm trying to recall, but let's think. At 240°F, I believe the saturation pressure is around 55 psia? Wait, no, that's the given total pressure. Oh wait, maybe that's a coincidence.

Wait, another approach. If the mixture is saturated, then the vapor is at the saturation state corresponding to the temperature. So at 240°F, the saturation pressure of water is indeed 55 psia, which matches the given total pressure. So that makes sense. So the water vapor is at its saturation pressure here.

Now, I can treat the dry air and the water vapor as two separate ideal gases. Because the total pressure is the sum of their partial pressures.

The total pressure P_total is 55 psia. Since it's a saturated mixture, the partial pressure of the water vapor (P_v) is equal to the saturation pressure at 240°F, which is 55 psia. Wait, that can't be right because if P_v is 55 psia, then the partial pressure of dry air would be zero, which doesn't make sense because we have 1 lb of dry air.

Wait, no, that can't be. I think I made a mistake here. Because in a saturated mixture, the vapor is at the saturation pressure for the given temperature, but the total pressure includes the partial pressures of both air and vapor. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, in a saturated air-vapor mixture, the vapor is the saturation vapor pressure at that temperature, and the total pressure is the sum of the air's partial pressure and the vapor's. Oh wait, but in this case, the total pressure is given as 55 psia, and the temperature is 240°F. So perhaps the vapor's partial pressure is the saturation pressure at 240°F, which I thought was 55 psia. But that would leave no room for the air's partial pressure, which can't be right since we have 1 lb of air.

So maybe I'm wrong about the vapor pressure. Let me think again. Let's look up the saturation pressure of water at 240°F. I think that at 240°F, the saturation pressure is actually lower than 55 psia. Wait, let me try to remember. At 212°F, it's 14.7 psia (atmospheric). At higher temps, the saturation pressure increases. So maybe at 240°F, it's about 55 psia? Wait, that would mean that P_v is 55 psia, which is the total pressure, so the air's partial pressure would be zero. That's impossible because we have air present.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Maybe the total pressure is 55 psia, and the vapor is at a lower partial pressure, with the rest being air. But then why is the mixture saturated? Because saturation implies that the vapor is at its maximum possible partial pressure for that temperature.

Wait, maybe I should think about the fact that the mixture is saturated, so the vapor is at the saturation pressure for 240°F, regardless of the total pressure. So if the saturation pressure at 240°F is, say, 55 psia, then yes, that would mean the vapor's partial pressure is 55 psia, and the total pressure would have to be higher. But wait, in this problem, the total pressure is 55 psia, which would imply that the partial pressure of the vapor is 55 psia, and the air's partial pressure is zero, which can't be right.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the properties for saturated air. The specific humidity (w) is the mass of vapor per mass of dry air. For a saturated mixture, the specific humidity is the maximum possible at that temperature.

Wait, but I don't remember the exact value of specific humidity at 240°F. Maybe I can find it using steam tables or psychrometric charts. Alternatively, I can use the ideal gas law for both air and vapor.

Let me try this. The total pressure is 55 psia. The mixture is dry air and saturated water vapor. So I can write P_total = P_air + P_vapor.

Since the mixture is saturated, P_vapor = P_sat at T = 240°F. Let me find P_sat at 240°F. From steam tables, I think that the saturation pressure at 240°F is approximately 55 psia. Wait, that brings me back to the earlier problem. Because then P_air would be zero, which can't be right because we have 1 lb of dry air.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the units. Let me double-check: 55 psia is pounds per square inch absolute. Wait, let me look up the saturation pressure of water at 240°F. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the steam tables.

Wait, from what I remember, at 240°F, the saturation pressure is about 55 psia. So yes, that would mean that the water vapor is at 55 psia. But then if the total pressure is 55 psia, the air can't have any pressure, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the total pressure isn't the sum of the partial pressures. No, that's not correct. Dalton's law says P_total = P_air + P_vapor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the temperature given is not the saturation temperature but the actual temperature. Wait, no, because the problem states it's a saturated mixture, which means the vapor is at the saturation state for that temperature.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the steam tables. Let me think: At 240°F, what's the saturation pressure? Let me try to recall. I think that at 240°F, the saturation pressure is actually lower than 55 psia. Wait, let's see: 14.7 psia is at 212°F (boiling point). At higher temperatures, the saturation pressure increases. For example, at 250°F, I think it's around 60 psia. So maybe at 240°F, it's about 55 psia. Hmm, that would fit, but that brings us back to the problem that P_air would be zero.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the air is dry and the vapor is at the saturation pressure. So the air's partial pressure would be P_air = P_total - P_vapor.

Wait, if P_total is 55 psia, and P_vapor is 55 psia, then P_air would be zero, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my initial assumption. So perhaps the saturation pressure at 240°F is lower than 55 psia.

Wait, maybe I should look up exact values. Let me try to recall or think through. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed without knowing the exact P_sat and see if that clarifies.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the air and vapor each contribute to the total pressure. So P_air = m_air * R_air * T / V, and P_vapor = m_vapor * R_vapor * T / V.

But since the mixture is saturated, m_vapor is the maximum possible for that temperature, so the specific humidity w is the maximum, which is w = 0.622 * P_vapor / (P_total - P_vapor). But wait, since P_vapor is the saturation pressure at T, which I thought was 55 psia, but that causes P_air to be zero, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the specific humidity w is m_vapor / m_air. And in a saturated mixture, w is the maximum possible at that T. So I can find w from the psychrometric chart or steam tables.

Alternatively, I can use the ideal gas law for each component.

Let me try this approach.

Given:
- T = 240°F = 240 - 32 * 5/9 = let's see: 240°F is 115.56°C (because 32°F is 0°C, and each degree C is 1.8° F, so 240-32=208°F above 0°C. 208 / 1.8 = approx 115.56°C).

But maybe it's easier to work in absolute temperature in Rankine. So T = 240 + 459.67 = 699.67 °R.

We have m_air = 1 lb.

Let me find the partial pressure of air, P_air.

From Dalton's law: P_total = P_air + P_vapor.

But I'm not sure about P_vapor, since I thought it's the saturation pressure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the saturation pressure at 240°F. Let's say it's P_sat. Then P_vapor = P_sat.

Wait, perhaps I can look up P_sat at 240°F. Let me think: At 240°F, I think the saturation pressure is 55 psia. But that would mean P_air = 55 psia (total) - 55 psia (vapor) = 0, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm wrong about P_sat at 240°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the pressure units. Wait, 55 psia is much higher than atmospheric, so maybe P_sat at 240°F is indeed 55 psia. But then, that would mean that the air's partial pressure is zero, which doesn't make sense because we have 1 lb of dry air.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't a saturated mixture but just a mixture where the vapor is present, but not necessarily at the saturation state. No, the problem clearly states it's a saturated air-vapor mixture, so the vapor must be at the saturation state for that temperature.

Hmm. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's think about the specific volume.

Wait, the volume of the tank can be found by considering the total mass and using the ideal gas law, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the dry air and vapor separately.

The ideal gas law for dry air: P_air * V = m_air * R_air * T.

Similarly, for vapor: P_vapor * V = m_vapor * R_vapor * T.

Since the mixture is saturated, I can find P_vapor from the saturation pressure at T=240°F.

Wait, but I'm stuck because if P_vapor is 55 psia, then P_air would be zero, which can't be. So perhaps I'm wrong about P_vapor being 55 psia.

Wait, maybe the total pressure is 55 psia, and the vapor's partial pressure is less than that, so that the air's partial pressure is P_air = 55 - P_vapor.

But since the mixture is saturated, the vapor's partial pressure is the saturation pressure at T.

So I need to find P_sat at 240°F.

Wait, I think I remember that at 240°F, the saturation pressure is approximately 55 psia. So that would imply that P_vapor = 55 psia, and thus P_air = 0 psia. But that can't be correct because the air is present.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the temperature given is higher than the saturation temperature for 55 psia. Let me check: If 55 psia is the saturation pressure, what temperature does that correspond to?

From steam tables, the saturation temperature for 55 psia is indeed around 240°F. So yes, that means P_vapor = 55 psia, which is the same as P_total. Therefore, P_air = 0 psia, which is impossible. So this can't be right.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is that the system is at 55 psia and 240°F, but the vapor isn't at the saturation state. But the problem says it's a saturated mixture, so that can't be.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific humidity can be determined from the psychrometric chart at 240°F and 55 psia. But I don't have the chart, so I have to rely on calculations.

Wait, I think the specific humidity w is given by w = 0.622 * P_vapor / P_air.

But since the mixture is saturated, P_vapor is the saturation pressure at T, which I thought was 55 psia, but that leads to P_air = 0, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the specific humidity is determined differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law for each component.

Let me denote:

m_air = 1 lb

P_air = ?

P_vapor = P_sat at 240°F = 55 psia.

Wait, but then P_air = P_total - P_vapor = 55 - 55 = 0 psia. Which is impossible because m_air is 1 lb.

So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming P_vapor is 55 psia. Maybe the saturation pressure at 240°F is lower than 55 psia.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think through this again.

If the total pressure is 55 psia, and the temperature is 240°F, then the saturation pressure at 240°F must be less than or equal to 55 psia. Because if it's higher, then the vapor would condense, but since the system is saturated, the vapor is at its maximum possible pressure for that temperature.

Wait, but if the saturation pressure is lower than 55 psia, then P_vapor is that lower value, and P_air would be 55 psia minus that.

So perhaps I need to find the saturation pressure at 240°F, which I think is indeed 55 psia, but that creates a problem because then P_air would be zero.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the temperature given is not the saturation temperature but higher. Let me think: If the system is at 55 psia and 240°F, and it's a saturated mixture, then the vapor must be at the saturation state corresponding to 55 psia, which I think is 240°F, making P_vapor = 55 psia. Then P_air = 0, which is impossible.

This seems like a contradiction. Maybe the problem is misstated, but I have to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the concept. Maybe the total pressure isn't the sum of the partial pressures. No, that's Dalton's law, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by treating the air and vapor as ideal gases and applying their respective gas laws.

So, for dry air:

P_air = m_air * R_air * T / V

Similarly, for vapor:

P_vapor = m_vapor * R_vapor * T / V

But since the mixture is saturated, P_vapor = P_sat at T.

Wait, but if T is 240°F, then P_sat is 55 psia. So P_vapor = 55 psia.

So the total pressure P_total = P_air + P_vapor = P_air + 55 = 55 psia (given).

So P_air + 55 = 55 → P_air = 0 psia.

Which is impossible because m_air is 1 lb. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the mixture is saturated, but the vapor is at a lower pressure. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the tank is at 55 psia, but the vapor is at a lower pressure, so the air's partial pressure is 55 - P_vapor.

Wait, maybe the specific humidity w can help. w is the mass of vapor per unit mass of dry air. And for a saturated mixture, w is the maximum possible.

The formula for specific humidity in a saturated mixture is:

w = (0.622 * P_vapor) / P_air

But P_air = P_total - P_vapor.

So substituting, w = 0.622 * P_vapor / (P_total - P_vapor)

But since P_vapor is the saturation pressure at T, which is 55 psia, substituting that in:

w = 0.622 * 55 / (55 - 55) → division by zero, which is undefined. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that maybe the given pressure is the absolute pressure, and perhaps I'm supposed to find the specific humidity, then find the mass of vapor.

Wait, perhaps the specific humidity is given by w = m_vapor / m_air.

Given m_air = 1 lb, if I can find w, then m_vapor = w * 1 lb.

So how to find w. From the psychrometric chart, w is determined at the saturation state, which would be at the given temperature.

Alternatively, using the relation:

w = 0.622 * (P_vapor) / (P_total - P_vapor)

But again, if P_vapor is 55 psia, and P_total is 55 psia, this becomes undefined.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try looking up the specific humidity at 240°F and 55 psia.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the steam tables to find the specific volume of the vapor and the specific volume of the air.

Wait, for the dry air, the specific gas constant R_air is 53.3533 ft·lbf/(lb·°R). For water vapor, R_vapor is 85.7667 ft·lbf/(lb·°R).

So, let me write the ideal gas equations for both.

For dry air:

P_air * V = m_air * R_air * T

For vapor:

P_vapor * V = m_vapor * R_vapor * T

But I don't know V, m_vapor, P_air, or P_vapor except that P_air + P_vapor = 55 psia.

Wait, and since the
