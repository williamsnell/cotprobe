Question:

The earthworm has a central nerve cord running along the entire length of the body. When an earthworm is cut into several parts, severing its nerve cord in the process, each part will go on crawling around for some time. How can each fragment carry out crawling movement even after the nerve cord is severed?

Options:

A: The earthworm can regenerate its nerve cord quickly.
B: The earthworm has a backup nerve cord that takes over when the main one is severed.
C: The earthworm uses chemical signals to communicate and coordinate movement between segments.
D: The earthworm's body movements are controlled by a fluid-filled hydraulic system independent of the nerve cord.
E: The earthworm has a centralized brain controlling all movements.
F: The earthworm's movements are not controlled by its nervous system.
G: The earthworm has more than one neural center controlling and coordinating its activities.
H: The earthwormâ€™s skin is sensitive to touch, allowing for movement without a nerve cord.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this earthworm question. So, the question is about how each part of the earthworm can still move even after the nerve cord is cut. Hmm, I remember that earthworms have a central nerve cord that runs along their body. But when they're cut into pieces, each part can still crawl for a bit. So, why is that?

I think the key here is understanding the structure of the earthworm's nervous system. I remember that in earthworms, the nervous system is a little different from, say, humans. They have a decentralized nervous system to some extent. Wait, but I thought they have a central nerve cord, so maybe it's more centralized. Or is it?

Wait, no, wait. The central nerve cord is like a main structure, but maybe each segment has its own ganglia. Oh right, each segment of the earthworm has a pair of ganglia, which are like clusters of nerves. So these ganglia can function somewhat independently. So when the main nerve cord is cut, each segment's ganglia can still control that part's movement without the central cord.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The earthworm can regenerate its nerve cord quickly. I don't think that's right because the question says each part continues moving, implying it doesn't need regeneration immediately.

Option B: Backup nerve cord. I don't recall earthworms having a separate backup. It's more about the existing structure.

Option C: Chemical signals between segments. That might be a factor, but the question is about movement after the nerve is severed, so maybe not the main reason.

Option D: Hydraulic system. Earthworms do have a hydrostatic skeleton, using fluid pressure for movement. But how does that relate to the nerve cord? Maybe the muscles can still contract without the nerve's control? No, because the nerves usually control muscle contractions.

Option E: Centralized brain. If the brain is central, cutting the cord would stop all movement. But each part moves, so this can't be right.

Option F: Movements not controlled by nervous system. That doesn't make sense because the nerve cord is part of the nervous system.

Option G: More than one neural center. Oh, right, each segment has its own ganglion acting as a neural center. So even if the main cord is cut, each segment's ganglion can control its own muscles, allowing movement.

Option H: Skin sensitivity. I don't think the skin's sensitivity allows movement without the nerve cord. The movement is more about muscle coordination than reacting to touch.

So the correct answer should be G: The earthworm has more than one neural center controlling and coordinating its activities. Because each segment's ganglion can take over locally.

The earthworm's ability to continue moving after its nerve cord is severed can be explained by its nervous system structure. Each segment of the earthworm contains a pair of ganglia, which act as local neural centers. These ganglia can function independently of the central nerve cord, allowing each segment to control its own movements even when the main nerve cord is cut. This decentralized control mechanism enables the earthworm to maintain crawling movements in each fragment without relying on a centralized brain or a backup nerve cord.

Answer: G
