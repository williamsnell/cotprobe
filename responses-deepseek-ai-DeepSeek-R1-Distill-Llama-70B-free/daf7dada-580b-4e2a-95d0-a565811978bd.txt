Okay, so I need to find the markup on a stock that's worth $230,000 at retail. The cost is 70% of the selling price. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what exactly markup means here. I think markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So, the profit or the amount added to the cost to get the selling price.

Wait, let me make sure. Markup is calculated as selling price minus cost. Right, so the formula would be Markup = Selling Price - Cost. But wait, the cost is given as 70% of the selling price. Oh, so the selling price is $230,000, so the cost is 70% of that.

Let me calculate the cost first. 70% of $230,000. To find 70%, I can multiply 230,000 by 0.7. Let me do that. 230,000 times 0.7... 230 times 0.7 is 161, so 161,000. So the cost is $161,000.

Now the markup would be the selling price minus the cost. Selling price is $230,000. Subtracting $161,000 from that gives me $69,000. So the markup is $69,000. Let me check the options. Option D is $69,000, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between markup and margin. Markup is on cost, but sometimes people talk about markup on selling price. Oh wait, no, the question says the cost is 70% of the selling price. So the markup here is straightforward. Another way: if cost is 70%, then the selling price is cost plus markup. So selling price is 230,000, which is cost plus markup. Cost is 70% of 230k, which is 161k, so markup is 230k - 161k = 69k.

Yes, I think I'm confident that the answer is D.

To determine the markup on the stock, we first calculate the cost, which is 70% of the selling price. The selling price is $230,000, so the cost is:

\[
\text{Cost} = 0.7 \times 230,000 = 161,000
\]

Markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost:

\[
\text{Markup} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost} = 230,000 - 161,000 = 69,000
\]

Thus, the markup is $69,000. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

D: $69,000

Answer: D
