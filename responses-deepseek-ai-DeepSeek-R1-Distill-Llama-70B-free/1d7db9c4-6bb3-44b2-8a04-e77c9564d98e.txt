Okay, so I have this problem here about a town needing money and figuring out the tax rate. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the town needs $465,000 for its financial obligations. I guess that's the total amount they need to collect through taxes. Then, the assessed valuation of the property is $10,000,000. I remember that the tax rate is usually calculated based on the assessed value.

Wait, how do you calculate the tax rate again? I think it's the amount needed divided by the assessed valuation, and then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. Oh right, because tax rate is a percentage.

So the formula should be: (Total Amount Needed / Assessed Valuation) * 100 = Tax Rate.

Let me plug in the numbers. The total amount is $465,000, and the assessed valuation is $10,000,000. So that's 465,000 divided by 10,000,000. Hmm, doing that division. 

Wait, 465,000 divided by 10,000,000. Let me compute that. 465 divided by 10,000 is 0.0465. Because 465,000 is 465 * 1000, and 10,000,000 is 10,000 * 1000, so the 1000s cancel out, leaving 465/10,000. 

So 465 divided by 10,000 equals 0.0465. To get the percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives 4.65%. 

Looking at the options, option H is 4.65%. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I do the math right? 465,000 divided by 10,000,000. Let's see, 10,000,000 divided by 1000 is 10,000. 465,000 divided by 1000 is 465. So 465/10,000 is 0.0465. Yep, that's 4.65%. So I think I'm confident that H is the correct answer.

The town needs $465,000 and has an assessed valuation of $10,000,000. To find the tax rate:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{465,000}{10,000,000} \right) \times 100 = 4.65\%
\]

From the options, 4.65% corresponds to option H.
