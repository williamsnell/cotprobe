Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a toy car and a toy truck colliding. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the truck's mass is double the car's mass. So if the car's mass is m, the truck's is 2m. They collide, and I need to compare their accelerations during the collision.

Wait, right, when objects collide, they exert forces on each other. Newton's third law comes into play here. Oh yeah, the forces are equal and opposite. But wait, the question is about acceleration, not force.

Oh, right, acceleration depends on force and mass. Newton's second law, F=ma. So if F is the force exerted by the car on the truck, then the truck's acceleration a_truck would be F/(2m). And the car's acceleration a_car would be F/m because its mass is m.

Wait, but wait a second. So if the force on the truck is F, then the force on the car is -F because they're opposite. But since acceleration is F/m, the car's acceleration would be (F)/m upwards, and the truck's would be F/(2m). So the car's acceleration is twice as much as the truck's. But wait, direction-wise, since the forces are opposite, the accelerations would be in opposite directions too.

So the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's, and in the opposite direction. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option F says double the magnitude and opposite direction. Option B is half and opposite. So F seems right.

Wait, wait, I think I might have mixed up which is which. Because if the truck is more massive, it would have less acceleration. So if the car is lighter, same force would cause a bigger acceleration in the car. So yeah, the car's acceleration is bigger.

So the car's acceleration is (F/m) and the truck's is (F/(2m)). So a_car is 2*a_truck. So compared to the truck's acceleration, the car's is double in magnitude, and opposite in direction.

So that's option F.

The problem involves a collision between a toy car and a toy truck, where the truck's mass is double the car's mass. During the collision, the forces exerted on each object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction according to Newton's third law. However, acceleration depends on both force and mass, as described by Newton's second law, \( F = ma \).

Let the car's mass be \( m \) and the truck's mass be \( 2m \). If the force exerted on the truck is \( F \), its acceleration is \( a_{\text{truck}} = \frac{F}{2m} \). For the car, the force is the same magnitude but opposite in direction, so its acceleration is \( a_{\text{car}} = \frac{F}{m} \). Comparing the two, \( a_{\text{car}} = 2a_{\text{truck}} \). Thus, the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's acceleration and in the opposite direction.

From the given options, the correct choice is **F: double the magnitude and in the opposite direction**.

Answer: F
