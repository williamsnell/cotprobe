Okay, so I have this economics question here about equilibrium price and quantity when the price of a substitute good changes. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that good X is a close substitute for good Z. So if the price of X rises, what happens to the equilibrium for Z? I remember that substitutes are goods that can be used in place of each other. So if X becomes more expensive, people might switch to buying Z instead.

Wait, so the price of X goes up. Since X and Z are substitutes, the demand for Z should increase because Z becomes more attractive when X is pricier. When demand increases, I think that shifts the demand curve for Z to the right. 

At equilibrium, the supply and demand curves meet. If demand goes up, the equilibrium point moves along the supply curve. Assuming the supply of Z is upward sloping (which is usually the case), a higher demand would lead to both a higher equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity for Z. 

Let me visualize this. The demand curve for Z shifts right. So at every price point, more people want to buy Z. The suppliers, seeing higher demand, will produce more, which means the quantity increases. And since the price is determined by where supply and demand meet, the price of Z should also go up.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one where both equilibrium price and quantity rise. Let me check the options:

A: Price falls, quantity same → No, opposite.
B: Price rises, quantity same → No, quantity should change.
C: Price same, quantity falls → No, demand increased.
D: Price falls, quantity rises → That's if demand decreased.
E: Price rises a lot, quantity falls slightly → Doesn't make sense because higher demand should increase quantity.
F: Both fall → Opposite.
G: Both same → No change? Doesn't fit.
H: Price same, quantity up → Maybe if supply is perfectly elastic, but generally, price should rise.
I: Price up, quantity down → That's for a decrease in demand, but here demand increases.
J: Both rise → Yes, that's what I thought.

So the correct answer should be J.

When the price of good X, a close substitute for good Z, rises, the demand for good Z increases because consumers switch to Z as it becomes relatively more attractive. This shifts the demand curve for Z to the right. As a result, both the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of good Z increase, assuming the supply curve is upward sloping. 

The correct answer is the option where both the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity rise.
