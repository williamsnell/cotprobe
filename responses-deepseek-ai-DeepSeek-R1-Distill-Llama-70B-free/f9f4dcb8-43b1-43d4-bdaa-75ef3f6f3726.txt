Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that X1, X2, X3 are independent random variables taking positive integer values. Their probability mass functions are given by P(X_i = x) = (1 - p_i) * p_i^{x-1} for x=1,2,... and each i=1,2,3. The parameters are p1=1/2, p2=1/4, p3=1/8. I need to find the probability that X1 < X2 < X3.

Wait, so each X_i follows a geometric distribution. Oh right, because the PMF is (1-p)p^{x-1}, which is the geometric distribution starting at x=1. So each represents the number of trials until the first success, with success probabilities p1, p2, p3 respectively.

Since the variables are independent, the joint probability P(X1 < X2 < X3) would be the sum over all possible x1, x2, x3 where x1 < x2 < x3 of the product of their individual probabilities.

So, mathematically, it's P(X1 < X2 < X3) = sum_{x1=1 to ∞} sum_{x2=x1+1 to ∞} sum_{x3=x2+1 to ∞} P(X1=x1) P(X2=x2) P(X3=x3).

That's a triple sum, which might be a bit complicated. But maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without summing an infinite number of terms.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since all three variables are independent, perhaps I can compute the expectation of the indicator variable that X1 < X2 < X3. But I'm not sure if that's easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probability by conditioning. For example, fix X1 = x, then find the probability that X2 > x and X3 > X2.

Wait, that might work. Let's try that approach.

So, P(X1 < X2 < X3) = sum_{x=1 to ∞} P(X1 = x) * P(X2 > x) * P(X3 > X2 | X2 > x). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, for each x1, compute P(X2 > x1) and then for each x2 > x1, compute P(X3 > x2), so the total is sum_{x1=1}^∞ P(X1 = x1) * [sum_{x2 = x1+1}^∞ P(X2 = x2) * P(X3 > x2)} ].

Wait, maybe that's the way. Let's break it down.

First, compute P(X2 > x1) for a given x1. Since X2 is geometric with parameter p2, P(X2 > x1) = (p2)^{x1}.

Because for a geometric distribution starting at 1, P(X2 > x1) is the probability that the first x1 trials are failures, which is (1 - p2)^{x1} * p2^0? Wait no, wait. Wait, no—Wait, the PMF is P(X2 = x) = (1-p2) p2^{x-1}, so P(X2 > x) = sum_{k=x+1}^∞ (1-p2) p2^{k-1}.

Let me compute that sum. Let me let S = sum_{k=x+1}^\infty (1-p2) p2^{k-1} = (1-p2) p2^{x} sum_{n=0}^\infty p2^{n} }.

Because when k = x+1, then it's (1-p2) p2^{x} * 1, then k=x+2 is (1-p2) p2^{x+1}, etc. So the sum becomes (1-p2) p2^x * sum_{n=0}^∞ p2^{n} } = (1-p2) p2^x * (1/(1 - p2)) ), since sum of a geometric series with ratio p2 is 1/(1-p2) when |p2| <1.

So that simplifies to p2^x. Therefore, P(X2 > x1) = p2^{x1}.

Similarly, for a given X2 = x2, P(X3 > x2) = p3^{x2}.

Putting it all together, the probability P(X1 < X2 < X3) is the sum over x1=1 to ∞ of [P(X1 =x1) * P(X2 >x1) * P(X3 > X2 | X2 >x1)} ].

Wait, but wait. Because once X2 >x1, X3 has to be greater than X2, which is at least x1+1. But I think I can model this as, for each x1, the probability that X2 >x1 is P(X2 >x1) = p2^{x1}, and then given X2 >x1, the probability that X3 > X2 is sum_{x2=x1+1}^\infty P(X2=x2) * P(X3 >x2) }.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the triple sum as a product of geometric series.

Wait, let's think about it differently. The variables are independent, so the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities. So P(X1 < X2 < X3) = sum_{x1=1}^\infty sum_{x2=x1+1}^\infty sum_{x3=x2+1}^\infty P(X1=x1) P(X2=x2) P(X3=x3)}.

Which can be written as sum_{x1=1}^\infty [ P(X1=x1) * sum_{x2=x1+1}^\infty [ P(X2=x2) * sum_{x3=x2+1}^\infty P(X3=x3) } ] } ].

So let me compute the inner sum first: sum_{x3=x2+1}^\infty P(X3=x3) = (1-p3) sum_{x3=x2+1}^\infty p3^{x3 -1}.

Which is (1-p3) * p3^{x2} sum_{k=0}^\infty p3^{k} } = (1-p3) p3^{x2} * (1/(1-p3)) ) = p3^{x2}.

So the inner sum for x3 is p3^{x2}.

Then, the middle sum becomes sum_{x2=x1+1}^\infty P(X2=x2) * p3^{x2}.

Which is sum_{x2=x1+1}^\infty (1-p2) p2^{x2-1} * p3^{x2}.

We can factor out (1-p2) p2^{-1}, so it becomes (1-p2) p2^{-1} sum_{x2=x1+1}^\infty (p2 p3)^{x2}.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

P(X2=x2) = (1-p2) p2^{x2 -1}, so when we multiply by p3^{x2}, it's (1-p2) p2^{x2-1} p3^{x2} = (1-p2) p2^{-1} (p2 p3)^{x2}.

So the sum becomes (1-p2) p2^{-1} sum_{x2=x1+1}^\infty (p2 p3)^{x2}.

This is a geometric series with first term (p2 p3)^{x1 + 1} and ratio (p2 p3).

So the sum is (1-p2) p2^{-1} * [ (p2 p3)^{x1 +1} / (1 - p2 p3) ) ].

Wait, because sum_{n=k}^\infty r^n = r^k / (1 - r), assuming |r| <1.

So putting that together, the middle sum becomes:

(1-p2) / p2 * [ (p2 p3)^{x1 +1} / (1 - p2 p3) ) ]

Simplify it: (1-p2) (p2 p3)^{x1 +1} ) / [ p2 (1 - p2 p3) ) ]

Which simplifies to (1-p2) (p2 p3)^{x1} p2 p3 / [ p2 (1 - p2 p3) ) ]

Wait, (p2 p3)^{x1 +1} = (p2 p3)^{x1} * p2 p3. So that's correct.

So then, the middle sum becomes [ (1-p2) p2 p3 (p2 p3)^{x1} ) ] / [ p2 (1 - p2 p3) ) ]

The p2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

(1-p2) p3 (p2 p3)^{x1} / (1 - p2 p3 )

So the middle sum is [ p3 (1 - p2) (p2 p3)^{x1} ] / (1 - p2 p3 )

Now, the entire expression is sum_{x1=1}^\infty P(X1 = x1) * [ p3 (1-p2) (p2 p3)^{x1} / (1 - p2 p3) ) ]

P(X1 =x1) is (1-p1) p1^{x1 -1}.

So substituting:

sum_{x1=1}^\infty (1-p1) p1^{x1 -1} * [ p3 (1-p2) (p2 p3)^{x1} / (1 - p2 p3) ) ]

We can factor out the constants:

(1-p1) * p3 (1-p2) / [ (1 - p2 p3) ) ] * sum_{x1=1}^\infty p1^{x1 -1} (p2 p3)^{x1}.

Let me write that sum as sum_{x1=1}^\infty [ p1^{x1 -1} (p2 p3)^{x1} } ]

Which is sum_{x1=1}^\infty (p2 p3)^{x1} / p1^{1 -x1} }

Wait, more accurately, p1^{x1-1} * (p2 p3)^x1 = p1^{x1 -1} (p2 p3)^x1 = (p2 p3)^x1 * p1^{-1} p1^x1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor p1^{x1 -1} = p1^{x1} / p1. So:

sum = sum_{x1=1}^\infty (p2 p3)^{x1} * p1^{x1 -1} = (1/p1) sum_{x1=1}^\infty (p1 p2 p3)^{x1}.

Which is (1/p1) * sum_{x1=1}^\infty (p1 p2 p3)^{x1}.

That's a geometric series where each term is (p1 p2 p3)^{x1}, starting at x1=1.

So sum_{x1=1}^\infty r^{x1} = r/(1 - r), where r = p1 p2 p3.

So the sum becomes (1/p1) * [ (p1 p2 p3) / (1 - p1 p2 p3) ) ].

Putting it all together, the entire expression is:

(1-p1) * p3 (1-p2) / (1 - p2 p3) ) * (1/p1) * (p1 p2 p3) / (1 - p1 p2 p3) )

Simplify this:

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, constants:

(1-p1) * p3 (1-p2) / (1 - p2 p3) ) * (1/p1) * (p1 p2 p3) / (1 - p1 p2 p3) )

= (1-p1) * p3 (1-p2) * (1/p1) * (p1 p2 p3) ) / [ (1 - p2 p3)(1 - p1 p2 p3) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1-p1) * p3 (1-p2) * (1/p1) * p1 p2 p3

The p1 cancels with 1/p1, giving:

(1-p1) * p3 (1-p2) * p2 p3.

So numerator: (1-p1) (1-p2) p2 p3^2.

Denominator: (1 - p2 p3)(1 - p1 p2 p3).

So the entire expression becomes [ (1-p1)(1-p2) p2 p3^2 ] / [ (1 - p2 p3)(1 - p1 p2 p3) ) ].

Now plug in the given values: p1=1/2, p2=1/4, p3=1/8.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute numerator:

(1 - p1) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

(1 - p2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

p2 = 1/4.

p3^2 = (1/8)^2 = 1/64.

So numerator: (1/2) * (3/4) * (1/4) * (1/64).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me see:

Wait, numerator is (1-p1)(1-p2) p2 p3^2.

So substituting:

(1/2) * (3/4) * (1/4) * (1/8)^2.

Wait, (1/8)^2 is 1/64.

So computing:

1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8.

3/8 * 1/4 = 3/32.

3/32 * 1/64 = 3/(32 * 64) = 3/2048.

So numerator is 3/2048.

Denominator is (1 - p2 p3) * (1 - p1 p2 p3).

Compute each term:

p2 p3 = (1/4)(1/8) = 1/32.

So 1 - p2 p3 = 1 - 1/32 = 31/32.

p1 p2 p3 = (1/2)(1/4)(1/8) = 1/(2*4*8) )= 1/64.

So 1 - p1 p2 p3 = 1 - 1/64 = 63/64.

Thus denominator is (31/32) * (63/64) = (31 * 63) / (32 * 64).

Compute 31 *63: 31*60=1860, 31*3=93, so 1860 +93=1953.

32*64=2048.

So denominator is 1953/2048.

Putting numerator and denominator together:

Probability = (3/2048) / (1953/2048) = 3 / 1953.

Simplify this fraction. Let's see, 3 divides into numerator and denominator.

3 ÷3=1.

1953 ÷3: Let's compute 1953/3.

3*651=1953, because 3*600=1800, 3*51=153, so 1800+153=1953. So 1953/3=651.

So it becomes 1/651.

Wait, but 651 can be further divided by 3: 6+5+1=12, which is divisible by 3.

651 ÷3= 217. So 651=3*217.

So 1/651 = 1/(3*217) = 1/(3*217).

Wait, but 217: 217 ÷7 = 31, because 7*31=217. So 217=7*31.

Thus, 651 = 3*7*31. So 1/651 is in simplest form.

So the probability is 1/651.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, numerator is 3/2048, denominator is 1953/2048. So 3/2048 divided by 1953/2048 is (3)/(1953) = 1/651.

Yes.

Wait, but 1/651 is approximately 0.001536. Let me compute 1/651 numerically.

651 goes into 1 zero times. 651 into 10 is 0.0... Let's compute 1/651.

Well, 651 * 0.001 = 0.651, so 0.001 is 651/1000, which is 0.651, so 1/651 is approximately 0.001536.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.00153619831, which matches this value.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 1/651, which is approximately 0.001536. So option E is 0.00153619831.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the algebra.

Wait, let me go back through the steps.

We had P(X1 < X2 < X3) = sum over x1 of P(X1 =x1) * P(X2 >x1) * P(X3 > X2).

Wait, earlier I thought that P(X3 > X2) given X2 would be sum over x2 >x1 of P(X2=x2) * P(X3 >x2).

Wait, but in my approach, I used that P(X3 >x2) = p3^{x2}, which I think is correct because it's a geometric distribution.

Wait, perhaps I should check that.

For X3, P(X3 >x2) = sum_{x3=x2+1}^\infty P(X3=x3) = sum_{x3=x2+1}^\infty (1-p3) p3^{x3-1}.

Which is (1-p
