Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman who's previously healthy. She's been having episodes of severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness in her hands and feet for three months. Her vital signs are normal, and the physical exam didn't show anything unusual. They also ran some tests: thyroid function studies and an ECG, both of which were normal. So, the question is asking what's the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for her.

Hmm, so let's break this down. The symptoms she's experiencing—severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness—these sound like panic attacks. Panic attacks can include physical symptoms like a racing heart, shortness of breath, and tingling sensations, along with intense fear or anxiety. Since she's had these episodes for three months, it's probably panic disorder.

Now, considering her test results: thyroid issues can sometimes cause anxiety-like symptoms, but her thyroid function is normal. The ECG is normal too, so it's not a heart-related issue like arrhythmias, which can mimic panic attacks.

So, the likely diagnosis here is panic disorder. Now, what's the first-line treatment for panic disorder? From what I remember, SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are usually the go-to. They're effective and have a relatively good safety profile compared to other options.

Looking at the options:

A: Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, typically used for schizophrenia or acute psychosis. Not a first choice for anxiety unless it's a severe case with agitation, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

B: Risperidone is another antipsychotic. Again, not usually first-line for anxiety disorders.

C: Paroxetine is an SSRI. That fits with what I was thinking earlier. SSRIs like paroxetine, sertraline, or fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for panic disorder.

D: Methadone is an opioid used for pain and opioid detox. Definitely not indicated here.

E: Diazepam is a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines like diazepam or alprazolam can be used for acute anxiety or panic attacks, but they're usually recommended for short-term use because of the risk of dependence and tolerance. However, they can be effective.

F: Chlorpromazine is another antipsychotic, not used for anxiety as a first-line treatment.

G: Methylphenidate is a stimulant used for ADHD. Not relevant here.

H: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic. Again, not a first choice for panic disorder.

I: Lithium is a mood stabilizer used primarily for bipolar disorder. Not indicated here unless she has mania, which isn't mentioned.

So the options are between C: Paroxetine and E: Diazepam. Now, I need to decide which is more appropriate as the initial pharmacotherapy.

SSRIs are considered first-line because they're effective for long-term management and have fewer side effects compared to benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are good for quick relief but are typically recommended for short-term use due to dependence risks. Since the patient has been having episodes for three months, it's a chronic issue, so an SSRI like paroxetine would be better suited for long-term management.

Wait, but sometimes patients might be started on a benzodiazepine temporarily while waiting for the SSRI to take effect, which can take a few weeks. But the question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy, implying the primary treatment.

So the best answer is C: Paroxetine.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a 3-month history of episodes characterized by severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness in her hands and feet. These symptoms are consistent with panic disorder. Her normal thyroid function, ECG, and physical examination rule out other potential causes such as thyroid dysfunction or cardiovascular issues. 

For panic disorder, first-line treatment typically involves SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) due to their efficacy and safety profile for long-term management. Among the options provided:

- **A, B, F, H** (antipsychotics) and **I** (lithium) are not appropriate for panic disorder.  
- **D** (methadone) and **G** (methylphenidate) are unrelated to the treatment of anxiety or panic disorder.  
- **E** (diazepam), a benzodiazepine, can provide rapid relief for acute anxiety but is generally recommended for short-term use due to risks of dependence and tolerance.  

**C** (paroxetine), an SSRI, is the most appropriate choice for long-term management of panic disorder. SSRIs are preferred over benzodiazepines for chronic conditions due to their safety and efficacy.
