Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jerry paying interest on a loan. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is: How much interest will Jerry pay on his loan of $400 for 60 days at 6% per year? The options are A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky. I think the basic formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. Right? Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years. 

So, let's break down the numbers given. The principal P is $400. The rate R is 6% per year, which I should convert to a decimal. To do that, I divide by 100, so 6% becomes 0.06. 

Now, the time is 60 days. But wait, the formula uses time in years, not days. So I need to convert 60 days into a fraction of a year. I think there are 365 days in a year, right? So 60 days would be 60/365 years. Let me calculate that: 60 divided by 365. Let me see, 60 divided by 365 is approximately 0.1644 years. 

Putting it all together: I = 400 * 0.06 * (60/365). Let me compute that step by step. 

First, 400 multiplied by 0.06. Let's see, 400 * 0.06 is 24. That's the interest for one year. But since it's only for 60 days, I need to find a fraction of that. 

So, 24 multiplied by (60/365). Let me calculate 60/365 first. 60 divided by 365 is roughly 0.1644. So 24 * 0.1644 equals... let me do that multiplication. 

24 * 0.1644. Let's see: 20 * 0.1644 is 3.288, and 4 * 0.1644 is 0.6576. Adding them together, 3.288 + 0.6576 equals approximately 3.9456 dollars. 

Wait, that's around $3.95. Looking at the options, the closest one is G: $3.00, but that's not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again. 

Wait, wait. Maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me recalculate 60/365. 60 divided by 365: 365 goes into 60 zero times, so 0. Let's compute 600 divided by 365. 365 * 1 is 365, subtract from 600: 235 left. Bring down a zero: 2350. 365 goes into 2350 six times (6*365=2190). Subtract, get 160. Bring down a zero: 1600. 365 goes into 1600 four times (4*365=1460). Subtract, 140 left. Bring down a zero: 1400. 365 goes into 1400 three times (3*365=1095). Subtract, 305. So far, I've got 60/365 = 0.16438... approximately 0.1644. 

So back to I = 400 * 0.06 * 0.1644. Let me compute 400 * 0.06 first, which is 24. Then 24 * 0.1644 = let's compute 24 * 0.1 = 2.4, 24 * 0.06 = 1.44, 24 * 0.0044= approximately 0.1056. Adding those together: 2.4 + 1.44 is 3.84, plus 0.1056 gives about 3.9456. So about $3.95. 

Looking at the options, the closest choice is G: $3.00, but that's not exact. Wait, maybe I did something wrong. Let me try another approach. 

Alternatively, some people use 360 days in a year for calculations, especially in business contexts. Let me try that. So 60/360 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 years. 

So I = 400 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 400 * 0.01 = 4. So that would be $4.00, which is option C. 

Hmm, that's a different result. So which method is correct? I think the standard is 365 days unless stated otherwise, but sometimes 360 is used. The question doesn't specify, so maybe I should go with the 365-day method. 

Wait, but when I calculated with 365, I got about $3.95, which isn't an option. The options are $3.00, $4.00, etc. So perhaps the question expects using 360 days. 

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as (400 * 6%) for 60 days. Let me think in terms of per day. The annual rate is 6%, so the daily rate would be 0.06 / 365 ≈ 0.00016438. Multiply by 60 days: 0.00016438 * 60 ≈ 0.00983. Then multiply by principal: 400 * 0.00983 ≈ $3.93, which is again about $3.93. 

But none of the options exactly match that. The closest options are G: $3.00 or C: $4.00. Wait, option A is $2.00, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me re-calculate the 60/365 part. Maybe I can compute it as a fraction. 

60 days over 365 days is (60/365) = 12/73 ≈ 0.1644. 

So 400 * 0.06 = 24. Then 24 * (12/73) = (24*12)/73 = 288 /73. Let me compute 73 into 288. 73*3=219, 73*4=292 which is too much. So 3 times 73 is 219, subtract from 288: 69 left. So 3 and 69/73, which is approximately 3.945. So approximately $3.95. 

But the options don't have $3.95. Hmm. So perhaps the question expects an approximate answer. Let me look at the options again. 

The options are: A:2, B:9, C:4, D:1.5, E:10, F:8, G:3, H:5, I:7, J:6.

So the closest is G:3 or C:4. But why is there a discrepancy between the two methods (365 vs. 360 days). Or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the interest is calculated using simple interest for 60 days, but perhaps the rate is 6% per annum, so the formula is correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the simple interest formula but the time is in years as a decimal, so 60 days is 60/365 = approximately 0.1644 years. So 400 * 0.06 * 0.1644 = ~3.95, which is approximately $4. So perhaps the intended answer is C: $4.00. 

Alternatively, maybe I should round to the nearest dollar. $3.95 is about $4.00. So the correct answer would be C: $4.00.

Wait, but earlier when I used 360 days, I got exactly $4.00. Maybe the question assumes a 360-day year, which is common in some financial calculations, like in banking for simple interest. So if I take 60/360 = 1/6 of a year, then 400 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 400 * 0.01 = $4.00 exactly. So that would make option C correct.

I think that's probably what the question expects. So the answer is C: $4.00.

To calculate the interest Jerry will pay on his loan of $400 for 60 days at 6% per year, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$400 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T \) is the time in years.

First, convert 60 days into years. If we assume a 365-day year:

\[
T = \frac{60}{365} \approx 0.1644 \, \text{years}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
I = 400 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.1644 \approx 3.95 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

This gives approximately \$3.95 in interest. However, none of the options exactly match this amount. 

If we instead assume a 360-day year (common in some financial calculations):

\[
T = \frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667 \, \text{years}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
I = 400 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.1667 = 4.00 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

This gives exactly \$4.00, which matches option C. Given the options provided, the question likely assumes a 360-day year for simplicity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: \$4.00**
