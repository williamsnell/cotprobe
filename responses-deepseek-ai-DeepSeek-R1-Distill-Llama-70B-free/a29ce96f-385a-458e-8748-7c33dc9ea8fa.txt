Okay, so I've got this problem here about two components operating in parallel. The device fails only when both components fail, which makes sense because they're in parallel. The lifetimes X1 and X2 are independent and identically distributed with an exponential distribution, and the parameter θ is 2. The cost Z is given as 2Y1 + Y2, where Y1 is the minimum of X1 and X2, and Y2 is the maximum. I need to find E[Z], the expected value of Z.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I remember that for two independent exponential variables, their min and max have certain properties. I think the minimum of two exponentials is also exponential, and the maximum is something else, maybe a sum?

Wait, wait. The exponential distribution has the property that the minimum of two independent exponentials with rate λ is another exponential with rate 2λ. Since both X1 and X2 are exponential with θ=2, which I think is the mean, so the rate λ would be 1/θ, which is 1/2 in this case. So for Y1 = min(X1, X2), the rate would be λ1 + λ2 = 1/2 +1/2 =1. Therefore, Y1 is exponential with rate 1, so its expectation E[Y1] is 1/λ = 1/1 =1.

Now, what about Y2, the max of X1 and X2? The expectation of the maximum isn't as straightforward. I recall that for two exponentials with the same rate, the expectation of the maximum is 1/λ + 1/(2λ), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it using order statistics.

Right, for order statistics, when you have two independent variables, the expectation of the maximum can be found using the formula E[Y2] = (1/(λ)) * (1 + 1/2) )? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The expectation of the maximum of two exponentials with rate λ is (2)/(λ). Wait, let me check.

Wait, no. For the sum of two exponentials, but that's when they're in series, but in this case, the max is in parallel. Let me think about how to compute E[Y2].

Alternatively, I can model this using the expectation for order statistics. For two independent exponential variables with rate λ, the expectation of the maximum is E[Y2] = (1/λ) * (1 + 1/2) )? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: The maximum Y2 can be expressed as X1 if X1 >= X2, else X2. So maybe I can compute E[Y2] by integrating over the possible values.

But perhaps it's better to remember that for two exponentials with rate λ, the expectation of the maximum is (2)/(λ). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because E[Y1] is 1/λ (since Y1 is min, rate 2λ), so for two exponentials with rate λ, E[Y1] = 1/(2λ) and E[Y2] = (1 + 2λ)/(2λ^2)? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using the formula for order statistics. For two independent exponential variables with rate λ, the expectation of the k-th order statistic is E[Y_{(k)}] = (1/λ) * sum_{i=1 to k} 1/(n - i + 1), where n=2. So for k=2 (the maximum), E[Y2] = (1/λ) * [1/(2) + 1/(1)] ) = (1/λ) * (3/2) = 3/(2λ). Wait, that can't be right because if λ is 1, E[Y2] would be 3/2, but I thought for two exponentials, the expectation of max is (1/λ)(1 + 1/2) ) = 3/(2λ). Oh, that's correct. So in this case, since Y1 is min, which has rate 1, and Y2 is max, which has expectation 3/(2λ), but what's λ here?

Wait, in this problem, the original X1 and X2 have θ = 2, which is the mean. So for exponential distribution, the mean is 1/λ, so λ = 1/2. So each X has rate 1/2. When we take the minimum of two exponentials with rate λ, the min has rate 2λ. So Y1 has rate 1, so E[Y1] = 1/1 = 1.

Now, for Y2, the maximum. Using the order statistics formula for expectation: E[Y2] = (1/(λ)) * (1 + 1/2) ) = (1/(1/2)) * (3/2) ) = 2 * (3/2) ) = 3. So E[Y2] is 3.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the expectation of the maximum of two exponentials. I know that for two exponentials X1 and X2 with rate λ, the distribution of the maximum is S = max(X1, X2). The CDF of S is P(S <= s) = P(X1 <= s, X2 <= s) = [1 - e^(-λ s)]^2. So the PDF is derivative of CDF, which is 2 [1 - e^(-λ s)] * λ e^(-λ s). Then, the expectation E[S] is integral from 0 to infinity of s * 2 [1 - e^(-λ s)] * λ e^(-λ s) ds.

Let me compute that integral. Expanding, it's 2λ integral s (1 - e^{-λ s} - e^{-λ s} + e^{-2λ s}) ) ds. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it using integration by parts or look up the formula.

Alternatively, I remember that for the maximum of n iid exponentials with rate λ, E[S] = sum_{k=1}^n 1/(k λ) ). For n=2, that would be 1/(λ) + 1/(2 λ) ) = (3)/(2 λ). So yes, that matches the earlier calculation. So for our case, λ=1/2 because each X has rate 1/2. So E[Y2] = 3/(2*(1/2)) )= 3/(1) )=3.

So E[Z] = 2 E[Y1] + E[Y2] = 2*(1) + 3 =5.

Wait, but when I look at the options, option D is 5, option I is 7, and option E is 12. So the answer should be 5, which is option D.

Wait, wait a second, did I make a mistake in the rate? Because X1 and X2 are exponential with θ=2, which is the mean. So the rate λ is 1/2. So when taking the min, the rate becomes 1/2 +1/2 =1, so Y1 is exponential with rate 1, so E[Y1]=1. For Y2, the max, the expectation is 3/(2λ) = 3/(2*(1/2))=3/(1)=3. So 2*1 +3=5. So yes, the answer should be 5, option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the device's cost \( Z = 2Y_1 + Y_2 \), where \( Y_1 = \min(X_1, X_2) \) and \( Y_2 = \max(X_1, X_2) \). The lifetimes \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent and identically distributed with an exponential distribution with mean \( \theta = 2 \). The rate \( \lambda \) of the exponential distribution is \( 1/\theta = 1/2 \).

1. **Expectation of \( Y_1 = \min(X_1, X_2) \):**  
   The minimum of two independent exponentials with rate \( \lambda \) is also exponential with rate \( 2\lambda \). Here, \( \lambda = 1/2 \), so \( Y_1 \) has rate \( 1 \). The expectation of an exponential distribution is \( 1/\text{rate} \), so  
   \[
   E[Y_1] = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
   \]

2. **Expectation of \( Y_2 = \max(X_1, X_2) \):**  
   The maximum of two independent exponentials with rate \( \lambda \) can be computed using the formula for the expectation of the maximum of \( n \) independent exponentials:  
   \[
   E[Y_{(n)}] = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}.
   \]  
   For \( n = 2 \),  
   \[
   E[Y_2] = \frac{1}{\lambda} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \cdot \frac{3}{2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \lambda = 1/2 \),  
   \[
   E[Y_2] = \frac{1}{1/2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 3.
   \]

3. **Expectation of \( Z = 2Y_1 + Y_2 \):**  
   Using the results above,  
   \[
   E[Z] = 2E[Y_1] + E[Y_2] = 2(1) + 3 = 5.
   \]

Thus, the expected value of \( Z \) is \( 5 \), which corresponds to option **D**.
