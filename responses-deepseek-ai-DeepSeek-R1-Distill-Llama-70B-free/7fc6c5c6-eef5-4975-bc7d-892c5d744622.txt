Okay, so I've got this problem here where Paul is taking out a loan. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is asking how much interest he'll have to pay. Hmm, right, interest on a loan.

Alright, the loan amount is $677.21. The time period is 90 days, and the rate is 4%. Wait, 4% per what? Oh, right, probably annual rate, since that's the usual unless stated otherwise. So I think I need to calculate the interest for 90 days at 4% annually.

I remember that simple interest is calculated as principal × rate × time. Time here is in years, I think. Oh wait, because the rate is annual, so I need to convert 90 days into years. Let me think, 90 days is a quarter of a year, right? Because 365 days in a year. So 90 divided by 365 is approximately 0.2466 years.

Wait, but wait a second. Sometimes for such calculations, especially in finance, they might use 360 days as the year. Oh, right, I've heard about the 360-day year in some financial contexts. So perhaps I should check both possibilities.

Let me calculate both ways. First, with 365 days. 90/365 is approximately 0.2466. Then, 677.21 multiplied by 4% is 0.04. So 677.21 * 0.04 is... let me compute that. 677.21 * 0.04. Let's see, 677 * 0.04 is 27.08, and 0.21 * 0.04 is 0.0084, so total about 27.0884. Then multiply by time, 0.2466. Wait, wait no, wait. No, wait, the formula is principal × rate × time. So that would be 677.21 × 0.04 × (90/365).

Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (677.21 * 0.04) * (90/365). Let me compute that step by step. 677.21 * 0.04 is $27.0884. Then, 90/365 is about 0.2466. So 27.0884 multiplied by 0.2466. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 27 * 0.2466 is approximately 6.66, and 0.0884 * 0.2466 is about 0.0218. So total around 6.68, say approximately $6.68.

Alternatively, using 360 days in a year, 90/360 is 0.25. So 677.21 * 0.04 * 0.25. Let me compute this. 677.21 * 0.04 is 27.0884, multiplied by 0.25 is 6.7721. So that's about $6.77. Hmm, that's one of the options. Option I is $6.77.

Wait, but which method is correct? In finance, sometimes the 360-day year is used, especially in things like simple interest for loans. So perhaps the correct way is to use 360 days. Therefore, the interest would be approximately $6.77, which is option I.

Let me look at the options again. Option I is $6.77. That matches my second calculation. So I think the correct answer is I. But wait, wait a minute. Another thought: sometimes, the interest could be calculated using the exact number of days. Let me double-check the exact calculation.

Wait, the formula is I = P × r × t, where t is time in years. So t is 90 days. If using 365 days in a year, t = 90/365 ≈ 0.2466. If using 360, t = 0.25.

So with 360: 677.21 × 0.04 × 0.25 = 677.21 × 0.01 = 6.7721, which is $6.77.

Alternatively, 90/365 is approximately 0.2466. So 677.21 × 0.04 = 27.0884. Multiply by 0.2466: 27.0884 × 0.2466. Let me calculate this more accurately. 27 * 0.2466 = 6.66, as before. 0.0884 × 0.2466 ≈ 0.0218. So total is approximately 6.6818, which is about $6.68. But none of the options is exactly $6.68. The closest is option I, $6.77, but that's using 360 days. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Wait, maybe I should compute it without approximating so much. Let's compute 90/365 exactly. 90 divided by 365 is 0.2465753425. So 677.21 × 0.04 = 27.0884. Then, 27.0884 × 0.2465753425. Let me calculate this precisely.

27.0884 × 0.2465753425. Let me compute 27 × 0.2465753425 = 6.6575. Then 0.0884 × 0.2465753425 ≈ 0.02182. So total is approximately 6.6575 + 0.02182 = 6.6793, so about $6.68.

Looking back at the options, the available choices are A: $7.21, B: $9.03, C: $10, D: $4, E: $27.09, F: $8.15, G: $2.71, H: $5.42, I: $6.77, J: $12.88.

Wait, so $6.68 isn't an option. Hmm, so perhaps the question expects me to use the 360-day method, which gives exactly $6.77, which is option I. Or perhaps the question is considering the rate as quarterly? Wait, the rate is 4%, but perhaps it's 4% per annum, so quarterly would be 1%, but that's not the case here. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as 4% per annum, but for 90 days, so the interest is 4% * (90/365), which would be approximately 6.68, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the rate is 4% per month, but that seems high. Let me check that. If the rate is 4% per month, then for 3 months, it's 12% annually, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest with the time as 90 days, and the rate is 4% annual, so the exact calculation would be:

I = P * R * T, where R is 4% per annum, T is 90 days.

So, T in years is 90/365 = approx 0.246575342.

So, I = 677.21 * 0.04 * (90/365).

Let me compute that. 0.04 * (90/365) is 0.04 * 0.246575342 ≈ 0.009830138. Then, 677.21 * 0.009830138.

Let me compute that: 677.21 × 0.009830138.

First, 677 × 0.0098301 is approximately 6.656. Then 0.21 × 0.0098301 is about 0.00207. So total is approximately 6.658, which is about $6.66. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, but option I is $6.77. So why is that different? Oh, perhaps the question is using the 360-day count. Let me try that. So 90/360 is 0.25.

So I = 677.21 × 0.04 × 0.25.

Compute that: 677.21 × 0.01 = 6.7721. So that's exactly $6.77, which is option I.

So the correct answer would be I, $6.77.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when the interest rate is given as an annual rate, but the loan is for a certain number of days, the interest is calculated as (principal × rate × time)/100, where time is in days. So perhaps the formula is (677.21 × 4 × 90)/ (365 × 100).

Wait, let me compute that. 677.21 × 4 = 2708.84. Multiply by 90: 2708.84 ×90 = 243,795.6. Then divide by (365 ×100) = 36,500. So 243795.6 / 36500 ≈ 6.68.

Again, that's about $6.68, which isn't an option. Hmm. So perhaps the intended method is using 360 days. Because that gives exactly $6.77, which is one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is being calculated as 4% of the principal, and then for 90 days, perhaps 4% of 677.21 is 27.0884, and then 90 days is a quarter of a year, so 1/4 of 27.0884 is 6.7721, which is $6.77, option I.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is I.
</think>

To calculate the interest Paul will pay on a loan of $677.21 for 90 days at a rate of 4%, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

Where:
- \( P = 677.21 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Since the loan is for 90 days, we need to convert this into years. There are two common methods:
1. Using a 365-day year: \( t = \frac{90}{365} \approx 0.2466 \).
2. Using a 360-day year: \( t = \frac{90}{360} = 0.25 \).

### Method 1: Using a 365-day year
\[
I = 677.21 \times 0.04 \times 0.2466 \approx 6.68
\]

### Method 2: Using a 360-day year
\[
I = 677.21 \times 0.04 \times 0.25 = 6.7721
\]

The exact calculation depends on whether a 360-day or 365-day year is assumed. Since the result using the 360-day year ($6.77) matches one of the options, and this method is often used in financial calculations, it is likely the intended approach.

Thus, the interest Paul will pay is **$6.77**, which corresponds to **option I**.
