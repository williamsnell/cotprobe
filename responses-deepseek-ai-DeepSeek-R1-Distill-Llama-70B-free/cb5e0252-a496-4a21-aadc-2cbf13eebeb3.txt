Okay, so I've got this problem about camphor in alcohol and rotation of plane-polarized light. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with specific rotation and how concentrations affect the rotation. Let's see.

The problem says that a solution of camphor in alcohol in a 20 cm long tube causes a 33-degree rotation. The specific rotation of camphor is +54°, and I need to find the density of camphor in the solution. Wait, wait, the options give grams per cc, so I think density here refers to mass per unit volume, like concentration.

Specific rotation is defined as the amount of rotation caused by a 1 dm (10 cm) path length of a 1 g/ml concentration of the substance. The formula I remember is: 

Rotation (degrees) = specific rotation × concentration (g/ml) × path length (dm).

Wait, the units are important here. The path length given is 20 cm, which is 2 dm because 1 dm is 10 cm. So, 20 cm is 2 dm.

So, the formula can be rearranged to solve for concentration. Let me write that down.

Concentration = Rotation / (specific rotation × path length in dm)

Plugging in the numbers: Rotation is 33 degrees. Specific rotation is 54. Path length is 2 dm.

So concentration = 33 / (54 * 2) = 33 / 108 = 0.305... grams per ml. Wait, because concentration is in g/ml, right? So 0.305 g/ml is the same as 0.305 g per cc since 1 ml is 1 cc.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.306 grams per cc, which is super close to my calculation. Maybe I should check my math again.

Wait, 54 times 2 is 108. 33 divided by 108 is 0.305555... which is approximately 0.3056, so 0.306 when rounded to three decimal places. Yeah, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the units. The specific rotation is given per dm and per g/ml. So when I use 2 dm, that's correct, right? Yes, because 20 cm is 2 dm. So my calculation is right. So the concentration is 0.3055 g/ml, which is 0.3055 g per cc, so option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for optical rotation:

\[
\text{Rotation (degrees)} = \text{Specific Rotation} \times \text{Concentration (g/ml)} \times \text{Path Length (dm)}.
\]

Rearranging to solve for concentration:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Rotation}}{\text{Specific Rotation} \times \text{Path Length (dm)}}.
\]

Given:
- Rotation = \(33^\circ\),
- Specific Rotation of camphor = \(+54^\circ\),
- Path Length = \(20 \, \text{cm} = 2 \, \text{dm}\).

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{33}{54 \times 2} = \frac{33}{108} \approx 0.3056 \, \text{g/ml}.
\]

Since \(1 \, \text{ml} = 1 \, \text{cc}\), the concentration is approximately \(0.306 \, \text{g/cc}\). Among the options provided, the closest value is:

**C: 0.306 grams per cc.**
