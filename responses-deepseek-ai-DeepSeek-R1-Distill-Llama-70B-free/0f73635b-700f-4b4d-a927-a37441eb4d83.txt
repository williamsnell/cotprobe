Okay, so I have this problem about national income accounting. Hmm, I remember that there are different approaches to calculating GDP, like the expenditure approach and the income approach. The question here is about arranging some given figures into a consolidated income statement, calculating Personal Income (PI) and Disposable Personal Income (DPI). The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me see. The figures provided are in billions of dollars. I think the first step is to identify which components go into Personal Income and Disposable Income. 

Wait, Personal Income (PI) is the sum of all the income that households receive. It includes things like compensation of employees, proprietor's income, dividends, interest, and rents. But wait, I also need to consider some taxes and transfers.

Alternatively, I remember that Personal Income is calculated by starting with the National Income and adding transfer payments and subtracting some taxes. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

National Income (NI) is the sum of all income earned by resources, including wages, rents, interest, profits, etc. So NI would include Compensation of employees, proprietor's income, corporate profits, interest, etc. But then, to get PI, you adjust NI by adding transfer payments and subtracting taxes and some other things.

Wait, the formula I think is: PI = NI + Transfer Payments + Interest on Government Debt - Social Security Taxes - Corporate Income Taxes - Undistributed Corporate Profits. Or is it another way? I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should break it down step by step.

Looking at the given numbers:

Personal consumption expenditures (C)660
Transfer payments127
Rents40
Capital consumption allowance (D)95
Social security taxes46
Interest20
Proprietor's income68
Net exports2
Dividends6
Compensation of employees642
Indirect business taxes101
Undistributed corporate profits40
Personal taxes116
Corporate income taxes35
Corporate profits81
Government purchases233
Net private domestic investment (I_net)57
Personal saving60

Wait, but for Personal Income, I need to sum up the income received by individuals. So that would include Compensation of employees (which is wages and salaries), proprietor's income (like self-employed), rents, interest received, and dividends. Then, we add transfer payments but subtract personal taxes.

Wait, the formula for Personal Income (PI) is:

PI = Compensation of employees + Proprietor's income + Rents + Interest + Dividends + Transfer payments - Personal taxes.

So let's add these up.

Compensation of employees: 642
Proprietor's income:68
Rents:40
Interest:20
Dividends:6
Transfer payments:127
Personal taxes:116

So adding the first six: 642 + 68 = 710; 710 +40=750; +20=770; +6=776. Then add transfer payments: 776 +127=903. Now subtract personal taxes: 903 -116=787.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 787. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the components.

Wait, PI also might include other factors. Oh, perhaps I'm missing some elements. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in including the correct figures.

Wait, another approach: I think the formula is PI = National Income + Transfer payments - Corporate profits taxes - Social Security taxes - Undistributed corporate profits - Interest on the government debt. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, National Income (NI) is calculated as the sum of all incomes. Let's compute NI first.

NI includes Compensation of employees (642), proprietor's income (68), corporate profits (81), interest (20), rents (40), and other factors. Wait, let me think: NI = Compensation + proprietor's income + rental income + corporate profits + interest + other income. Wait, but some of these might be part of corporate profits. Alternatively, perhaps NI is:

Compensation of employees:642
Proprietor's income:68
Rental income:40
Interest:20
Corporate profits:81
Plus, are there other income components? Like dividends are part of corporate profits, maybe? Or are they separate?

Wait, I think the standard formula is NI = Wages + Rent + Interest + Proprietor's Income + Corporate Profits.

So that would be 642 (wages) +40 (rent) +20 (interest) +68 (proprietor) +81 (corporate profits) = let's calculate that.

642 +40 is 682, +20=702, +68=770, +81=851. So NI is 851?

But then, to get PI, you adjust NI by adding Transfer payments and subtracting some taxes.

Wait, the exact formula is PI = NI + Transfer payments - Social Security taxes - Corporate income taxes - Undistributed corporate profits + Interest on government debt. Or is that correct?

Wait, perhaps the formula is PI = NI + Transfer payments + Interest received by households - Social Security taxes - Corporate taxes - Undistributed profits.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the standard formula for PI, which is:

PI = Compensation of employees + Proprietor's income + Rental income + Interest income + Dividends + Transfer payments - Personal taxes.

Wait, that could make sense. So let's try that again.

Compensation of employees:642
Proprietor's income:68
Rental income:40
Interest income:20
Dividends:6
Transfer payments:127
Personal taxes:116

Adding these up: 642 +68 =710, +40=750, +20=770, +6=776, +127=903. Then subtract personal taxes (116): 903-116=787.

But the options don't have 787. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I missed some components. Let me list all possible income components for PI.

PI includes:

- Compensation of employees (COC): 642
- Proprietor's income (PI):68
- Rental income:40
- Interest received by households:20
- Dividends received:6
- Transfer payments:127

So summing these: 642 +68 =710, +40=750, +20=770, +6=776, +127=903.

Then subtract personal taxes (116), giving 903-116=787. Hmm, but the options don't include 787. Wait, what are the options? Let me check the options again.

Options are A:776, B:741, C:811, D:857, E:820, F:705, G:792, H:681, I:869, J:634.

787 isn't there. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate DPI instead of PI? Or perhaps I've included the wrong figures.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about Disposable Personal Income (DPI). DPI is PI minus personal taxes. Wait, no, personal taxes are already subtracted to get PI, so DPI would be PI minus personal taxes. Wait, no, PI is calculated by subtracting personal taxes. So DPI is PI minus other taxes like sales taxes? Or perhaps I'm mixing the terms.

Wait, let me clarify. Personal Income (PI) is the sum of all income received by households, including wages, rents, interest, dividends, and transfer payments, minus the taxes they pay. So PI = sum of income components - personal taxes.

Wait, but in the calculation above, I added transfer payments and subtracted personal taxes. So PI would be 903 -116=787. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate National Income and then adjust it correctly. Let's compute National Income first.

National Income (NI) = Compensation of employees + proprietor's income + rental income + interest + corporate profits. So 642 +68 +40 +20 +81 = 851.

Wait, but other components might be included. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Then, to get PI: PI = NI + Transfer payments - Social Security taxes - Corporate income taxes - Undistributed corporate profits.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because NI includes corporate profits, which are taxed, and undistributed profits are part of those. So to get PI, you have to add the transfer payments (which aren't part of NI) and subtract the taxes that corporations pay and the undistributed profits, as those are not part of household income.

So formula: PI = NI + Transfer payments - Social Security taxes - Corporate income taxes - Undistributed corporate profits.

Plugging in the numbers:

NI =851
Transfer payments=127
Social Security taxes=46
Corporate income taxes=35
Undistributed corporate profits=40

So PI = 851 +127 -46 -35 -40.

Calculating step by step: 851 +127=978. Then subtract 46: 978-46=932. Subtract 35: 932-35=897. Subtract 40: 897-40=857.

Hmm, 857 is option D. So that would be the PI.

Wait, but then the question also asks for DPI. DPI is PI minus taxes. Which taxes? Oh, I think DPI = PI - Personal taxes. Wait, but in this calculation, Personal taxes are 116. So if PI is 857, then DPI would be 857 -116=741.

Wait, but the options include 741 as option B. So if the question is to calculate both PI and DPI, but the options given are single numbers, perhaps the question is only asking for PI or DPI. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "Calculate, in addition, Personal Income (PI) and Disposable Personal Income (DPI)." So perhaps the correct answer is one of the options, and the question is either asking for PI or DPI. But the options are all single values. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is to compute both and the options are for one of them, but the way the question is phrased is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the PI calculation again.

PI = NI + Transfer payments - Social Security taxes - Corporate income taxes - Undistributed corporate profits.

NI is 851. Transfer payments 127. So 851+127=978.

Subtract Social Security taxes (46): 978-46=932.

Subtract Corporate income taxes (35): 932-35=897.

Subtract Undistributed profits (40): 897-40=857.

So PI is 857, option D.

Then, DPI would be PI - Personal taxes. Personal taxes are 116.

So 857 -116=741, which is option B.

But the question says to "calculate, in addition, PI and DPI." So perhaps the problem expects both to be calculated, but the options are single values. So perhaps the question is only asking for one of them, and the other is a step toward it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find DPI, which is 741, option B.

Wait, but the initial part of the question is about arranging into a consolidated income statement. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for DPI, and the options include 741 as B. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute DPI as PI minus personal taxes, and PI is 857, so DPI is 741, which is option B.

But the options don't have 857 and 741 as possible answers unless the question is only asking for DPI. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute PI as the sum of COE, proprietor's income, rents, interest, dividends, and transfer payments, minus personal taxes. Let's try that again.

COE:642

Proprietor's income:68

Rents:40

Interest:20

Dividends:6

Transfer payments:127

Sum: 642+68=710, +40=750, +20=770, +6=776, +127=903.

Minus personal taxes: 903-116=787.

But this approach gives PI=787, which isn't among the options. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that interest includes some other components. Or maybe the interest figure is not the one received by households but paid by businesses. Hmm.

Wait, the interest given is 20. But perhaps that's the interest paid by businesses, so it's part of NI. But for PI, it's part of the interest received by households. So that should be included.

Wait, maybe I should check both approaches.

In the first approach, using NI and adjusting gives PI=857.

In the second approach, summing individual components gives PI=787.

But the options include 857 (D) and 741 (B). So perhaps the correct approach is the first method, NI-based, giving PI=857, which is option D.

Then, DPI would be 741, option B.

But the question asks to calculate both. So perhaps the intended answer is one of them. But the options are given as single letters, so perhaps the question is only asking for one of them. Wait, the question says, in addition, calculate PI and DPI. So perhaps the question expects both, but the options are for one of them, or perhaps I'm supposed to select the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 741, which is option B, for DPI.

Wait, but the options are given as A-J, each being a single number. So perhaps the question is asking for DPI, which is 741, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to arrange the figures into an income statement, and then compute PI and DPI, but the options are for one of them. Maybe the problem expects the calculation of DPI, which would be 741, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the NI calculation. Let me recalculate NI.

NI = COE + proprietor's income + rental income + interest + corporate profits.

COE:642

Proprietor:68

Rent:40

Interest:20

Corporate profits:81

Sum: 642 +68=710, +40=750, +20=770, +81=851. So NI is 851.

Then, PI = NI + Transfer payments - Social Security taxes - Corporate taxes - Undistributed profits.

NI=851

Transfer payments=127 → 851+127=978

Minus Social Security=46 → 978-46=932

Minus Corporate taxes=35 →932-35=897

Minus Undistributed=40 →897-40=857 → PI=857 (option D)

DPI=PI - Personal taxes=857-116=741 (option B)

So the two calculated values are 857 and 741.

Looking back at the question, it asks to calculate PI and DPI. However, the options only provide single values, so perhaps the question is asking for one of them. But the options include both D and B as possible, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for DPI, which is 741, option B.

But the problem says to arrange the figures into a consolidated income statement and calculate PI and DPI. So perhaps the correct answer is one of these. But since the options include both, perhaps the question is only asking for one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing DPI, which is 741, option B.

Wait, let me think about another approach. The expenditure approach calculates GDP as C + I + G + (X-M). But the question is about the income approach, so perhaps it's better to stick with the NI method.

I think the correct approach is to calculate PI as 857 (option D) and DPI as 741 (option B).

But looking at the options, the only matching numbers are D (857) and B (741). Since the question asks to calculate both, but the options are single, perhaps the intended answer is one of them. But the question doesn't specify which one. Wait, perhaps I misread the question, and it's only asking for DPI. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "Calculate, in addition, Personal Income (PI) and Disposable Personal Income (DPI)." So both are required, but the options are single. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is one of them, but I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the correct figures, and the options are for one of them. For example, the question might be asking for DPI, which is 741, option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the NI calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is to compute DPI, which is 741, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for PI, which is 857, option D. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should compare with another method. Let me calculate DPI another way. DPI is equal to PI minus personal taxes. If PI is 857, then DPI is 741. But if PI were 787, then DPI would be 787-116=671, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct PI is 857, so the answer is D.

But the options include both D and B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is to compute both and select the option that includes one of them. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the intended answer is D for PI=857.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, 741, for DPI.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct approach is to calculate PI as 857 and DPI as 741. So the options D and B are the respective answers. But the question asks to calculate both, so perhaps the intended answer is option B, 741.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to calculate Personal Income (PI) and Disposable Personal Income (DPI) using the provided data. The correct approach involves using the income approach to calculate PI and then adjusting it to find DPI.

### Step 1: Calculate Personal Income (PI)
The formula for Personal Income (PI) is:

\[
PI = NI + \text{Transfer Payments} - \text{Social Security Taxes} - \text{Corporate Income Taxes} - \text{Undistributed Corporate Profits}
\]

1. **National Income (NI)** is calculated as:
   \[
   NI = \text{Compensation of Employees} + \text{Proprietor's Income} + \text{Rental Income} + \text{Interest} + \text{Corporate Profits}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   NI = 642 + 68 + 40 + 20 + 81 = 851
   \]

2. Substitute the values into the PI formula:
   \[
   PI = 851 + 127 - 46 - 35 - 40
   \]
   Calculate step-by-step:
   \[
   PI = 851 + 127 = 978
   \]
   \[
   PI = 978 - 46 = 932
   \]
   \[
   PI = 932 - 35 = 897
   \]
   \[
   PI = 897 - 40 = 857
   \]

Thus, **Personal Income (PI) = 857
