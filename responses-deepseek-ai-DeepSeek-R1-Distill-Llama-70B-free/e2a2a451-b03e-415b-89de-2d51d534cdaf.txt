Okay, so I've got this question about jumper cables and the color that designates the negative connector. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about car batteries and jumper cables.

I remember that car batteries have two terminals: positive and negative. The positive is usually marked with a plus sign or maybe a red color, while the negative is a minus sign and often a different color. Wait, but what colors are typically used?

I think in cars, the positive terminal is red. So that would mean the negative is the opposite. I've heard before that negative is usually black. But wait, sometimes I get confused with the colors in different contexts. Like, in electrical wiring, black is often hot, and white is neutral. But that's for house wiring, not car batteries.

Wait, no, in jumper cables, the colors are standardized to avoid confusion. So the red clamp is for the positive terminal, and the black clamp is for the negative. So when jump-starting a car, you connect the red to the positive of the dead battery and the other red to the positive of the good battery. Then the black goes to the negative of the good battery and the other black to a metal ground on the dead car.

But the question is specifically about the negative connector, so that would be black. Let me check the options. The options are from A to J. Option C is black. So the answer should be C.

Wait, no, wait. Another thought. Sometimes I've seen that the negative cable is black, and positive is red. So yes, that confirms it. So the negative connector is black.

The negative connector on a set of jumper cables is designated by the color black.
