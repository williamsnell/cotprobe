Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion."

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this history question about the Mughal Empire and zamindars. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is referring to a passage from W.H. Moreland's "India at the Death of Akbar." The passage explains that zamindars in Northern India during that period were in a position where they could sometimes claim sovereignty. It mentions that a zamindar who paid revenue to the Mughal Empire was dependent, but if they stopped paying, they could claim sovereignty. However, their position was a bit ambiguous because sometimes they paid, sometimes rebelled, and sometimes were left alone because the Mughals didn't enforce their authority.

The question is asking why the zamindars had the ability to establish a claim to sovereignty, and it's about the Mughal Empire's policy. The options are A through J, with various policies listed.

I need to think about the policies of the Mughal Empire. I remember that the Mughals had a system where local chiefs (zamindars) collected taxes and had some administrative powers. The Mughal Empire was quite extensive, and controlling every region directly might have been difficult, so they probably allowed some autonomy to local leaders.

The passage suggests that when zamindars stopped paying revenue, they could claim sovereignty. This implies that the Mughals didn't have a very tight grip on all their territories. So the Mughal policy must have been something that allowed these zamindars to have some independence.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Censorship. That doesn't seem related. Censorship is about controlling information, not about governance structure.

Option B: Military conscription. That's about recruiting soldiers. If the Mughals had this, it might centralize power more, making it harder for zamindars to be independent. So probably not this.

Option C: Universal taxation. The passage mentions paying revenue, which is a form of taxation. But universal taxation would imply a centralized system where everyone pays directly, which might reduce the zamindar's power. So maybe not this.

Option D: Diplomatic immunity. That's about legal immunity for diplomats, which doesn't fit the context here.

Option E: Non-interference. This sounds promising. If the Mughal policy was non-interference, they'd leave local leaders to manage their affairs, allowing zamindars to sometimes act independently and claim sovereignty.

Option F: Feudal system. The Mughals did have a feudal-like system where zamindars held land and collected taxes. In a feudal system, local lords have some autonomy, so this could also be a possible answer. The passage mentions that sometimes the Mughals found it inconvenient to coerce them, which might relate to a feudal structure where direct control isn't always exercised.

Option G: Religious toleration. That's about allowing different religions, which doesn't directly explain the zamindars' ability to claim sovereignty.

Option H: Free trade. This is about economic policies, not governance structure related to local leaders.

Option I: Martial law. That would imply strict military control, which would prevent zamindars from claiming sovereignty.

Option J: Suffrage. That's about voting rights, which isn't relevant here.

Now I'm trying to decide between E (non-interference) and F (feudal system). The passage says that the Mughal authorities sometimes found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion. That suggests that they didn't interfere much, letting the zamindars have practical independence. So maybe non-interference is the policy.

Alternatively, the feudal system refers to the structure where lords (zamindars) have certain rights and can sometimes assert independence because the central authority isn't strong enough to control them all the time. So the Mughal policy of using a feudal system allowed zamindars to have that autonomy.

Wait, the question is about the Mughal Empire's policy that gave zamindars the ability to claim sovereignty. The passage says that the zamindars paid revenue but sometimes could stop and claim independence. So the Mughals' policy was perhaps not to interfere in local affairs, letting the zamindars manage as long as they paid revenue. This would fit with a policy of non-interference.

Alternatively, the feudal system is more about the structure of landholding and administration, which allowed zamindars to have their own power base. So the Mughal policy was to allow this feudal structure, which in turn allowed zamindars to sometimes act independently.

I'm a bit torn between E and F. Let me think again. The passage says that the Mughal authorities found it inconvenient to coerce, implying that they didn't always enforce their authority, which aligns with non-interference. So maybe the policy was non-interference in local affairs, allowing zamindars to sometimes act sovereign.

But another angle is that the Mughal Empire operated a feudal system where zamindars were given rights to collect taxes and maintain order, which could lead them to assert independence when they chose. So the policy was the feudal system.

Wait, the question asks specifically about the policy that allowed zamindars to establish a claim to sovereignty. The passage says that the first step was to refuse to pay revenue. So the Mughal policy must have been such that the zamindar's payment of revenue was the key factor in their dependency. If they didn't pay, they could claim sovereignty, implying that as long as they paid, they were dependent, but if not, they were sovereign. So the Mughal policy was perhaps based on a system where payment of revenue was the main tie, and without it, the Mughals didn't always enforce their authority.

This sounds like a system where the central authority didn't have a strong administrative presence everywhere, so local leaders could sometimes avoid paying and thus be sovereign. That could relate to a feudal system, where local lords have more autonomy.

Alternatively, non-interference as a policy would mean the Mughals didn't get involved in local matters unless necessary, which would allow zamindars more freedom.

Hmm. I think the correct answer is E: non-interference. Because the Mughal policy was not to interfere unless necessary, which allowed the zamindars to sometimes be independent.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: in the Mughal Empire, the jagirdari system was prevalent, where jagirdars collected revenue on behalf of the emperor. Zamindars were hereditary landholders. If the Mughal policy allowed the zamindars to collect revenue and manage their lands with some autonomy, that would be part of a feudal system. So when they stopped paying, they could claim sovereignty because they already had that local power base.

So the policy was the feudal system, which allowed them to have that autonomy in the first place. So the answer would be F.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to parse the question again. It's about why the zamindars had the ability to establish a claim to sovereignty. According to the passage, it's because they could stop paying revenue, and the Mughals might not enforce it. So the reason is that the Mughal policy allowed them to have that autonomy, which points to a system where local leaders had significant powerâ€”like a feudal system.

Therefore, the correct answer is F: feudal system.

The question refers to the ability of zamindars in Northern India during the Mughal period to establish claims to sovereignty, as described in W.H. Moreland's "India at the Death of Akbar." The passage explains that zamindars could assert independence by refusing to pay revenue, and the Mughal authorities often found it inconvenient to enforce their authority. This suggests that the Mughal Empire's policy allowed zamindars a degree of autonomy.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Censorship** and **D: Diplomatic immunity** are unrelated to governance or sovereignty.
- **B: Military conscription** would centralize power, making it harder for zamindars to claim independence.
- **C: Universal taxation** implies a centralized system, which would reduce local autonomy.
- **E: Non-interference** fits the idea that the Mughals did not always enforce their authority, allowing zamindars practical independence.
- **F: Feudal system** describes a structure where local leaders like zamindars had significant autonomy, aligning with the Mughal policy of granting zamindars the right to collect taxes and manage local affairs.
- **G: Religious toleration**, **H: Free trade**, **I: Martial law**, and **J: Suffrage** are unrelated to the governance structure or zamindars' autonomy.

The correct answer hinges on understanding the Mughal policy that enabled zamindars to assert sovereignty. While "non-interference" (E) captures the Mughals' reluctance to enforce authority, the feudal system (F) better explains the structural basis of zamindars' autonomy, as they were integral to the Mughal administrative framework. The feudal system allowed zamindars to manage their lands and collect revenue, creating a power base that could be used to claim sovereignty when they withheld revenue.

Thus, the Mughal Empire's policy of operating a **feudal system** is the most accurate explanation for zamindars' ability to establish claims to sovereignty.
