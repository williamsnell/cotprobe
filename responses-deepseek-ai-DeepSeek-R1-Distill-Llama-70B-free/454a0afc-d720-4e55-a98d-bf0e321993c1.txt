Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Austin's theory of law. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option correctly lists the attributes of law according to Austin. I remember that Austin was a legal philosopher, part of the positivist school. Positivists focus on the social facts of law, like who makes it and how it's enforced, rather than its moral content.

Wait, Austin's definition... wasn't it something like law is a command from a sovereign, right? So I'm thinking the key elements are command, sovereign, and something else. Oh right, he also mentioned sanctions. Because he said that laws are commands backed by sanctions, meaning there's a punishment or consequence for not obeying.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one:

Option A: Command, sovereign, legal remedy. Hmm, legal remedy doesn't sound quite right. I think Austin was more about the threat of punishment rather than remedies, which are more about the legal solutions for when someone's rights are violated.

Option B: Command, sovereign, authority. Authority is a bit vague. Austin's more specific about sanctions, so probably not this one.

Option C: Command, sovereign, legal enforcement. Enforcement is a possibility, but I think Austin's term was sanctions, not just enforcement in general.

Option D: Command, sovereign, legal responsibility. Not sure about this. Responsibility is more about duty, not the consequence for breaking the law.

Option E: Command, sovereign, obedience by subject. Obedience is expected, but the attribute is more about why people obey. Austin would say it's because of the sanctions, so this doesn't fit the attributes.

Option F: Command, sovereign, enforceability. Enforceability is close, but again, the specific term was sanctions. Enforceability is a broader concept.

Option G: Command, sovereign, sanction. This rings a bell. Yes, Austin's triad was command, sovereign, and sanctions. So this must be the correct one.

Option H: Command, sovereign, compliance. Compliance is similar to obedience, but again, the key attribute is the sanction, which ensures compliance.

So the correct answer should be option G.

The correct answer is G: Command, sovereign and sanction.
