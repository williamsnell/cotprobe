Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactivity, curies, and half-life. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question says that one curie is defined as the amount of material equivalent to one gram of radium, which gives 3.7×10^10 disintegrations per second. Right, I remember that a curie is a unit of radioactivity. So, the key here is that any substance with the same activity, 3.7e10 decays per second, is one curie.

Now, the problem is about astatine (^210At), and its half-life is 8.3 hours. We need to find how many grams of astatine would equal one curie. So, we're looking for the mass of ^210At that has an activity of 1 Ci, which is 3.7e10 Bq (since 1 Bq is one decay per second).

I think the formula I need here is the one that relates activity (A) to the number of atoms (N), the decay constant (λ), and the half-life (T½). The activity is given by A = λ*N. And the decay constant λ is ln(2) divided by the half-life, right? So λ = 0.693 / T½.

First, I'll calculate the decay constant for astatine. The half-life is 8.3 hours. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Since the activity is given in decays per second, I should convert the half-life into seconds. 

So 8.3 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 8.3 * 3600 = 29,880 seconds. Let me double-check that: 8 * 3600 is 28,800, and 0.3 * 3600 is 1,080, so 28,800 + 1,080 = 29,880 seconds.

Now, λ = 0.693 / 29880 ≈ let me calculate that. 0.693 divided by 29880. Let me see, 0.693 / 3e4 is about 0.0231e-3. Wait, let me compute it accurately.

0.693 / 29880 = let's compute step by step. 0.693 ÷ 2.988e4.

Well, 2.988e4 is 29,880. 

Approximately: 0.693 / 29880 ≈ 2.317e-5 per second. Wait, let me compute 0.693 / 29880.

Let me compute 29880 divided by 0.693 first, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 0.693 / 29880 = (0.693 / 29.88) * 1e-3. Let's compute 0.693 / 29.88.

29.88 goes into 0.693 how many times? 0.0231 times, approximately. So 0.0231 * 1e-3 → 2.31e-5 per second. So λ ≈ 2.31e-5 s^-1.

Now, the activity A is 3.7e10 decays per second.

So, A = λ*N → N = A / λ.

Plugging in the numbers: N = (3.7e10) / (2.31e-5) → let's compute that.

3.7e10 / 2.31e-5 = (3.7 / 2.31) * 1e15.

3.7 divided by 2.31 is approximately 1.601. So N ≈ 1.601e15 atoms.

Now, I need to find the mass of this number of atoms. For that, I'll use Avogadro's number. The molar mass of astatine is needed. Wait, what's the atomic weight of astatine? I think it's around 210, but let me confirm. Oh wait, ^210At has a mass number of 210, so its molar mass is approximately 210 g/mol.

So, one mole of At is 210 grams and contains Avogadro's number of atoms, which is 6.022e23 per mole.

So, the number of moles (n) is N / Avogadro's number.

n = 1.601e15 atoms / 6.022e23 atoms/mol ≈ let's compute that.

1.601e15 / 6.022e23 → 1.601 / 6.022 is approximately 0.2658, then times 1e-8 → 2.658e-9 mol.

So the mass m is n * molar mass → m = 2.658e-9 mol * 210 g/mol.

2.658e-9 * 210 = 5.58e-7 grams. Wait, let me calculate it again. 2.658e-9 * 200 is 5.316e-7. Then 2.658e-9 * 10 is 2.658e-8 → adding them gives 5.316e-7 + 2.658e-8 = 5.582e-7 grams.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B is 3.29e-7, option D is 7.71e-7, option F is 6.32e-7. Hmm, option E is 4.15e-7, option H is 5.47e-7. Wait, my calculation came to about 5.58e-7 grams. So looking at the options, option H is 5.47e-7, which is close but not exactly matching. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me go through again.

Starting with N = A / λ.

A is 3.7e10 dps.

λ was 0.693 / (8.3 * 3600) s^-1.

Wait, 8.3 hours is 8.3 * 3600 = 29,880 seconds.

λ = 0.693 / 29,880 ≈ 0.02319 per hour? No, wait, that's per second. Because T½ is in seconds, so λ is per second.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 0.693 / 29880 more accurately.

0.693 / 29880 = let me compute 0.693 ÷ 29880.

Well, 29880 is approximately 3e4, so 0.693 / 3e4 is 0.0231e-3 → 2.31e-5 s^-1, as before.

So N = (3.7e10) / (2.31e-5) = approximately 1.6e15 atoms.

Molar mass of ^210At is 210 g/mol.

Number of moles = 1.6e15 / 6.022e23 = approx 2.658e-9 mol.

Mass is 2.658e-9 * 210 = 5.58e-7 grams.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match 5.58e-7. Let me see which option is closest. Option H is 5.47e-7, which is about 5.47e-7. The difference is about 0.11e-7. Maybe my approximations are off.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculations. Let me recompute N.

A is 3.7e10.

λ is 0.693 / 29880 → let me compute 0.693 / 29880 more precisely.

Compute 29880 ÷ 1e5 → 0.29880. So 0.693 / 29880 = 0.693 / (2.988e4) = 0.02319e-3 → 2.319e-5 s^-1.

So N = 3.7e10 / (2.319e-5) = (3.7 / 2.319) * 1e15.

3.7 / 2.319 → let's compute: 2.319 * 1.5 is 3.4785. 3.7 is 0.2215 more. So 0.2215 / 2.319 ≈ 0.0954. So total is approximately 1.5954 → 1.5954e15 atoms.

Number of moles: 1.5954e15 / 6.022e23 = approx 2.65e-9 mol.

Mass: 2.65e-9 * 210 = 5.565e-7 grams.

Hmm, so still around 5.56e-7 grams. Looking back at the options, H is 5.47e-7, which is 0.09e-7 less than my result. Could there be a miscalculation in the decay constant?

Wait, another approach: perhaps I miscalculated the decay constant. Let me recompute λ.

λ = ln(2)/T½.

T½ is 8.3 hours → 8.3 * 3600 = 29880 seconds.

So λ = 0.693147 / 29880 = let me compute this precisely.

0.693147 ÷ 29880 → let's write it as 6.93147e-1 ÷ 2.988e4.

So 6.93147e-1 / 2.988e4 = (6.93147 / 2.988) ) * 1e-5.

6.93147 ÷ 2.988 → let's compute this division. 2.988 * 2=5.976, which is less than 6.931. So 2.32 times 2.988 is approximately 6.93. Because 2.988 * 2.32 = 2.988*(2 +0.3 +0.02) = 5.976 + 0.8964 + 0.05976 ≈ 5.976 + 0.95616=6.932.

So 6.93 / 2.988 ≈ 2.32, so λ ≈ 2.32e-5 per second.

So N = 3.7e10 / 2.32e-5 → 3.7e10 / 2.32e-5 → 3.7 / 2.32 is about 1.594, so 1.594e15 atoms.

Molar calculation: 1.594e15 atoms / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = approx 2.646e-9 mol.

Mass: 2.646e-9 * 210 g/mol = 5.5558e-7 grams.

So 5.5558e-7 grams, approximately 5.56e-7 grams.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:5.47e-7, but it's a bit off. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in taking the molar mass. Wait, the isotope is ^210At, so the molar mass should be 210 g/mol, correct. So that's fine.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial activity. Oh, right, 1 Ci is 3.7e10 decays per second. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the Avogadro's number. I used 6.022e23, which is right. So, perhaps one of the steps has an error. Let me go through the math again.

Alternative approach: Let me compute the number of atoms required for 1 Ci.

The formula is:

A = (N * λ)

We can rearrange to find N = A / λ.

But λ is ln(2) / T½.

Another approach is to find the number of atoms needed to produce 3.7e10 decays per second. So,

N = (3.7e10 dps) * (T½) / (ln 2).

Wait, because N = A * T½ / ln(2). Because A = N ln(2)/T½ → N= A T½ / ln(2).

Wait, let me rederive this. Since A = Nλ, and λ=ln2/T½, so substituting:

A = N (ln2 / T½) → N = A * T½ / ln2.

Ah, that's an alternative way. Maybe that's easier.

So, N = (3.7e10 dps) * (8.3 hr) / ln2.

Wait, but the units! Because T½ is in hours, and A is per second. So I need to convert T½ to seconds.

So T½ =8.3 * 3600 = 29880 seconds.

So N = (3.7e10) * 29880 / 0.693147.

Compute that.

3.7e10 * 29880 = 3.7e10 * 2.988e4 = 3.7 *2.988e14 → let me compute 3.7 *2.988.

3 * 2.988=8.964, 0.7 *2.988=2.0916 → total 11.0556.

So 11.0556e14 → 1.10556e15.

Divide by 0.693147: 1.10556e15 / 0.693147 ≈ 1.594e15 atoms, which matches the earlier N.

So same result, N is about 1.594e15 atoms.

Now, moles: 1.594e15 / 6.022e23 = approx 2.646e-9 mol.

Mass: 2.646e-9 * 210 = 5.5558e-7 grams.

So 5.5558e-7 grams is the mass needed.

Looking at the options:

H is 5.47e-7.

Wait, but 5.5558 is closer to 5.56e-7, which isn't exactly an option. Hmm. Let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the decay constant. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a step in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I didn't consider that the question asks for the mass of astatine, which is 210 g/mol. Alternatively, maybe I should check the initial activity number. Wait, 1 Ci is 3.7e10 decays per second, correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute N as A*T½/(ln2).

A=3.7e10, T½=8.3*3600=29880 s.

N = (3.7e10 * 29880) / 0.693147.

Compute numerator: 3.7e10 * 29880 = 3.7 *29880 = let me compute step by step.

3.7 * 29880 = ?

Let me compute 3 * 29880 = 89,640.

0.7 *29880 =20,916.

Total: 89,640 +20,916=110,556.

So 3.7e10 * 29880 =110,556e10 → 1.10556e15.

Divide by 0.693147: 1.10556e15 / 0.693147 ≈1.594e15 atoms.

Same as before.

Molar mass At=210 g/mol.

Moles =1.594e15 / 6.022e23 = (1.594 / 6.022) *1e-8.

1.594 ÷6.022 → approximately 0.2647.

So 0.2647e-8 → 2.647e-9 mol.

Mass = 2.647e-9 * 210 → 2.647 *210 = 555.57 → 555.57e-9 → 5.5557e-7 grams.

So, 5.5557e-7 grams is the answer. But the options don't have this exact value. Let me look again.

The options are:

A:9.84e-7

B:3.29e-7

C:1.23e-6

D:7.71e-7

E:4.15e-7

F:6.32e-7

G:1.47e-6

H:5.47e-7

I:8.56e-7

J:8.01e-7

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact value without approximations.

Let me compute N = (3.7e10 * 29880) / 0.693147.

Compute 3.7e10 *29880 = 3.7 *29880 = 110556, so 1.10556e15.

Divide by 0.693147:

1.10556e15 / 0.693147 = 1.594e15.

Exactly the same as before. So, the number of atoms is 1.594e15.

Now, the molar mass is 210 g/mol.

Moles = 1.594e15 /6.022e23 = 1.594 /6.022 * 1e-8.

Compute 1.594 ÷6.022 → let's do it more accurately.

6.022 goes into 1.594 how many times?

6.022 *0.264 = approx 1.590, because 6 *0.264=1.584, and 0.022 *0.264=0.005808 → total 1.5898.

So 0.264 is approximately 1.594/6.022.

So 0.264 → 2.64e-9 mol.

Mass is 2.64e-9 *210 = 5.54e-7 grams.

Wait, that's about 5.54e-7, which is 5.54e-7 grams.

Looking at the options, H is 5.47e-7. The closest, but perhaps I should recheck the initial numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of atoms. Let me try another approach: using the formula for specific activity.

The specific activity (A_sp) is the activity per unit mass. It can be calculated using the formula:

A_sp = (A * N_A * λ) / (M)

Where:
- A is the activity (decays per second),
- N_A is Avogadro's number,
- λ is the decay constant,
- M is the molar mass.

Wait, no, more accurately, specific activity is A/m, and m is the mass. So:

A = (λ * N) → N = (A * m) / (λ * M) ? Hmm maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The formula for activity
