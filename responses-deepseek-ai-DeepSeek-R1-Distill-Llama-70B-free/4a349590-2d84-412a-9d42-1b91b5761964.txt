Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about conflicts in a distribution network. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct term for the conflict between sequential members like producers, distributors, and retailers, especially regarding issues like carrying a particular range or price increases.

Wait, let me think. I remember that in marketing channels, conflicts can arise at different levels. There's something about vertical and horizontal conflicts. Vertical conflict is between different levels of the channel, like a manufacturer and a wholesaler or retailer. Horizontal conflict would be between competitors at the same level, like two retailers competing with each other.

So the question is about sequential members, meaning they are in a line, one after another. So it's not about the same level but different levels. So vertical conflict makes sense here. Let me see the options.

Option D is Vertical conflict. That sounds right. What about the other options? Option F is Channel conflict, which is a broader term. Channel conflict could include both vertical and horizontal, but the question seems to specify the type between different levels.

Yes, I think the correct answer is D: Vertical conflict.

The question asks about conflict between sequential members in a distribution network, such as producers, distributors, and retailers, specifically regarding issues like product range or price changes. This type of conflict occurs between different levels of the distribution channel, which is referred to as vertical conflict. 

Analyzing the options:
- **D: Vertical conflict** fits because it describes conflicts between different levels (e.g., manufacturer vs. retailer).
- Other options like **F: Channel conflict** are broader and not specific to sequential levels.

Thus, the correct answer is **D: Vertical conflict**.

Answer: D
