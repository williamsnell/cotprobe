Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of moles of O2 in one liter of blood and then figuring out how many hemoglobin molecules are needed to transport that. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that one liter of fully oxygenated blood can carry 0.18 liters of O2 under certain conditions. The conditions are T=298 K and P=1.00 atm. Oh wait, right, these are standard temperature and pressure conditions, so I can use the ideal gas law here.

The first part is to find the number of moles of O2. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. I remember R is the gas constant, which has different values depending on the units. Since the pressure is in atm, I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. Let me confirm that... yeah, that's right.

So, plugging in the numbers: P is 1.00 atm, V is 0.18 liters, T is 298 K. I need to solve for n, the moles of O2.

Rearranging the equation: n = PV/(RT).

Calculating that:

n = (1.00 atm * 0.18 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K).

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.0821 * 298 ≈ 24.4658.

So n ≈ (0.18) / 24.4658 ≈ 0.00735 moles. Wait, wait, 0.18 divided by approximately 24.4658 is about 0.00735. So about 0.00735 moles per liter of blood.

Now, the second part is about hemoglobin. Each hemoglobin molecule has four oxygen binding sites. So each molecule can carry four O2 molecules.

I need to find how many hemoglobin molecules are required to carry all the O2 in 1.0 L of blood. So, the number of O2 molecules is n, which is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules/mol).

So first, the number of O2 molecules is 0.00735 mol * 6.022e23 ≈ let's compute that. 0.00735 * 6.022e23 ≈ 4.425e21 molecules.

Each hemoglobin binds four O2 molecules. So the number of hemoglobin molecules needed is the total O2 molecules divided by four.

So 4.425e21 /4 ≈ 1.106e21.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.11e21, which is very close. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternative approach: Let me recalculate n.

n = (1 atm * 0.18 L) / (0.0821 * 298) 

0.0821 * 300 is about 24.63, but since it's 298, it's a little less. 298 is 2 less than 300. So 0.0821 * 2 = 0.1642. So 24.63 - 0.1642 = 24.4658. So denominator is 24.4658.

n = 0.18 / 24.4658 ≈ 0.00735 mol. That's correct.

Number of O2 molecules: 0.00735 * 6.022e23 = let's compute 7.35e-3 * 6.022e23 = 7.35 *6.022e20.

7 *6 is 42, 0.35*6 is 2.1, so 44.1 approximately. Wait, wait, more accurately:

7.35 *6.022 = let's compute 7*6.022 = 42.154, plus 0.35 *6.022 = 2.1077. So 42.154 + 2.1077 ≈ 44.2617. So 44.2617e20 = 4.42617e21 molecules.

Divide by 4 (since each Hb carries 4 O2) → 4.42617e21 /4 ≈ 1.1065e21.

So approximately 1.1065e21, which rounds to 1.11e21. So yes, option A is correct.

To determine the number of moles of $\mathrm{O}_2$ carried per liter of blood, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Given:
- $P = 1.00 \, \mathrm{atm}$,
- $V = 0.18 \, \mathrm{L}$,
- $R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / (mol \cdot K)}$,
- $T = 298 \, \mathrm{K}$,

we calculate:

\[
n = \frac{(1.00)(0.18)}{(0.0821)(298)} \approx \frac{0.18}{24.4658} \approx 0.00735 \, \mathrm{mol}
\]

Thus, the number of moles of $\mathrm{O}_2$ in 1 liter of blood is approximately $0.00735 \, \mathrm{mol}$.

Next, to find the number of $\mathrm{O}_2$ molecules, we use Avogadro's number:

\[
\text{Number of molecules} = n \cdot N_A = (0.00735)(6.022 \times 10^{23}) \approx 4.426 \times 10^{21} \, \mathrm{molecules}
\]

Each hemoglobin molecule can bind 4 $\mathrm{O}_2$ molecules. Therefore, the number of hemoglobin molecules required is:

\[
\text{Number of hemoglobin molecules} = \frac{\text{Total number of } \mathrm{O}_2 \text{ molecules}}{4} = \frac{4.426 \times 10^{21}}{4} \approx 1.106 \times 10^{21}
\]

This value rounds to $1.11 \times 10^{21}$, which corresponds to option **A**.
