Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what "new economics" means. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but let me think through this.

The question is asking for the definition of "new economics." The options are A through J, each giving a different definition. I remember that "new economics" might relate to some synthesis of different economic theories. Wait, wasn't there a period when Keynesian and monetarist ideas were combined?

Let me go through each option one by one. Option A says it's policies focusing solely on supply-side measures. Supply-side economics does focus on production and incentives, but I'm not sure if that's what "new economics" refers to. I think supply-side is more of a specific policy approach, maybe associated with certain schools, but not the synthesis.

Option B says it's the synthesis of Keynesian and monetarist positions. That rings a bell. Keynesians focus on demand-side economics, government intervention, while monetarists, like Milton Friedman, emphasize the role of money supply and are more laissez-faire. So a synthesis would mean combining both perspectives, perhaps finding a middle ground. That sounds familiar, like maybe the new classical synthesis or something similar.

Option C suggests a return to classical theories. Classical economics is older, like Adam Smith's ideas, which are more about free markets and limited government intervention. But "new economics" sounds like a modern approach, not a return to old theories.

Option D is about monetary policy. That's too narrow because "new economics" probably encompasses more than just monetary aspects.

Option E is about psychological perspectives, which sounds like behavioral economics. That's a specific field, but I'm not sure if that's what the question is referring to as "new economics."

Option F talks about combining economics with engineering and biology. That sounds more like interdisciplinary fields such as ecological economics or something else, but not the synthesis of Keynesian and monetarist.

Option G says it rejects both Keynesian and monetarist positions. That would be a different school, maybe post-Keynesian or something else, but I don't think that's called "new economics."

Option H is about the latest theories. Well, "new" would imply recent, but the term "new economics" often refers to a specific synthesis rather than just being any new theory.

Option I is about environmental sustainability. That's more like green economics or ecological economics. Not exactly what I think "new economics" refers to here.

Option J is about digital currencies. That seems too specific and recent, more related to fintech or cryptocurrency, not the broader concept of new economics.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is B: The 'new economics' is the synthesis of Keynesian and monetarist positions. This makes sense because after the debates between Keynesians and monetarists, especially in the mid-20th century, there was an attempt to merge the two schools, recognizing the roles of both demand and money supply in the economy.

The term "new economics" refers to the synthesis of Keynesian and monetarist positions, combining the demand-focused approach of Keynesian economics with the monetarist emphasis on the money supply. This synthesis represents a middle ground between the two theories, recognizing the roles of both government intervention and monetary policy in economic management.

Answer: B
