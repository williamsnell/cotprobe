Okay, I'm trying to figure out this entropy change problem. So, the question has two parts, (a) and (b), both involving water in different phases and temperatures. Let me take it step by step.

First, part (a): H2O(s) at -20°C and 1 atm is changing to H2O(s) at 0°C and 1 atm. So, it's ice warming up from -20 to 0°C. Since it's the same phase, I think I can use the formula for entropy change when temperature changes. The formula I remember is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1), where Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives me the heat capacities. Oh right, for solid H2O, Cp is 9 cal/(deg·mol), and for liquid it's 18. So for part (a), since it's all solid, I use 9.

But I need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin, because entropy equations require absolute temperature. So, -20°C is 253.15 K, and 0°C is 273.15 K.

So plugging into the formula, ΔS = n * Cp * ln(T2/T1). Wait, but n is 1 mole here, right? The problem says per mole. So n=1.

So ΔS = 1 * 9 cal/(K·mol) * ln(273.15/253.15). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 273.15 divided by 253.15 is approximately 1.0787. The natural log of 1.0787 is about 0.076. So 9 * 0.076 is about 0.684 cal/(K·mol). Oh, wait, but usually entropy is in eu, and I think 1 cal/(K·mol) is 1 eu. So that would be 0.684 eu/mol, approximately 0.68.

So for part (a), the entropy change is about 0.68 eu/mol. Now, looking at the options, options A and C have 0.68 for (a), while B and D have 1.27. So I can narrow it down to A and C for (a).

Next, part (b): H2O(s) at -20°C to H2O(l) at 20°C. So this involves two steps. First, warming the ice from -20°C to 0°C (same as part a), then melting the ice at 0°C, and then heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C.

So I'll break it into three steps.

Step 1: Ice from -20°C to 0°C. Same as part (a). So ΔS1 = 0.684 eu/mol.

Step 2: Melting the ice at 0°C. The entropy change for phase change is ΔS = ΔH / T. Here, ΔH is the heat of fusion, given as 1440 cal/mol. The temperature is 0°C which is 273.15 K.

So ΔS2 = 1440 cal/mol / 273.15 K ≈ 5.27 cal/(K·mol) or eu/mol.

Step 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 20°C. The temperature change is 20 K. The Cp for liquid is 18 cal/(K·mol).

So ΔS3 = n Cp ln(T2/T1). T1 is 273.15 K, T2 is 293.15 K.

So ln(293.15/273.15) ≈ ln(1.073) ≈ 0.0707.

So ΔS3 = 1 * 18 * 0.0707 ≈ 1.273 eu/mol.

Now, summing up all three steps:

ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 + ΔS3 = 0.684 + 5.27 + 1.273 ≈ 7.227 eu/mol, which is approximately 7.22 eu/mol.

So putting it all together, part (a) is 0.68, part (b) is 7.22. Looking back at the options, option A is (a) 0.68 and (b)7.22. Option C is (a)0.68 and (b)5.27, which I don't think because our part (b) calculation gave higher. So the correct option should be A.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistake in the calculations? Let me double-check part (b). Oh wait, in part (b), the initial state is solid at -20, and the final is liquid at 20. So the path is solid warming, melting, then liquid warming. So yes, the three steps are correct.

Wait, but another thought: when calculating ΔS for each step, are the signs correct? For heating, entropy increases, so all steps contribute positively. The fusion is endothermic, so positive entropy. So all signs are positive, so adding is correct.

So, the correct answer should be option A.

To calculate the entropy change for the given processes, we proceed as follows:

### Part (a): H₂O(s, -20°C, 1 atm) → H₂O(s, 0°C, 1 atm)
This involves heating ice from -20°C to 0°C. Since the phase remains the same, we use the formula for entropy change during temperature change:

\[
\Delta S = n C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

- \( n = 1 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( C_p(\text{H}_2\text{O, s}) = 9 \, \text{cal/(K·mol)} \)
- \( T_1 = -20^\circ \text{C} = 253.15 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)

\[
\Delta S = 1 \cdot 9 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{273.15}{253.15}\right) = 9 \cdot \ln(1.0787) \approx 9 \cdot 0.076 = 0.684 \, \text{eu/mol}
\]

Thus, the entropy change for part (a) is approximately **0.68 eu/mol**.

---

### Part (b): H₂O(s, -20°C, 1 atm) → H₂O(l, 20°C, 1 atm)
This process involves three steps:
1. Heating ice from -20°C to 0°C (same as part (a)).
2. Melting ice at 0°C.
3. Heating liquid water from 0°C to 20°C.

#### Step 1: Heating ice from -20°C to 0°C
From part (a), this contributes:

\[
\Delta S_1 = 0.684 \, \text{eu/mol}
\]

#### Step 2: Melting ice at 0°C
The entropy change for melting is:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{fusion}}}{T}
\]

- \( \Delta H_{\text{fusion}} = 1440 \, \text{cal/mol} \)
- \( T = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)

\[
\Delta S_2 = \frac{1440}{273.15} \approx 5.27 \, \text{eu/mol}
\]

#### Step 3: Heating liquid water from 0°C to 20°C
The entropy change is calculated using:

\[
\Delta S = n C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

- \( n = 1 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( C_p(\text{H}_2\text{O, l}) = 18 \, \text{cal/(K·mol)} \)
- \( T_1 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 20^\circ \text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K} \)

\[
\Delta S_3 = 1 \cdot 18 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{293.15}{273.15}\right) = 18 \cdot \ln(1.073) \approx 18 \cdot 0.0707 = 1.273 \, \text{eu/mol}
\]

#### Total entropy change for part (b):
\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_1 + \Delta S_2 + \Delta S_3 = 0.684 + 5.27 + 1.273 \approx 7.227 \, \text{eu/mol}
\]

Thus, the entropy change for part (b) is approximately **7.22 eu/mol**.

---

### Final Answer
For part (a), the entropy change is **0.68 eu/mol**, and for part (b), it is **7.22 eu/mol**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A: 0.68 eu/mol for (a) and 7.22 eu for (b)**.
