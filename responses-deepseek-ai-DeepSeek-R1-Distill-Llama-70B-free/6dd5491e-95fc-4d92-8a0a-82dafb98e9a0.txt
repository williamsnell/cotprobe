Okay, so I've got this question about light passing through a prism and which color bends more than green. Hmm, I remember that when white light goes through a prism, it splits into different colors, right? That's called dispersion. The colors always come out in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Wait, sometimes people remember it with ROY G BIV, the acronym.

So the question is about which color bends more than green. I think the bending has to do with the wavelength. Oh right, the longer the wavelength, the less the light bends. Because red has the longest wavelength, it bends the least, and violet has the shortest, so it bends the most.

Green is in the middle of the visible spectrum. So the colors that bend more than green would be those with shorter wavelengths. Let's see, after green comes blue, then indigo, then violet. So the colors that bend more than green are blue, indigo, and violet.

Looking at the options, option C is blue. So the light that bends more than green is blue. Are there any other colors in the options? Let's check. The options are A to H, with C being blue. So the correct answer should be C: blue.

Wait, are there any other options that might fit? Let me check the options again. Option C is blue, which is correct. So I think the answer is C.

The correct answer is the color that bends more than green when white light passes through a prism. Since colors with shorter wavelengths bend more, and green is in the middle of the spectrum, the colors bending more than green are blue, indigo, and violet. Among the options provided, blue is listed as option C.

Answer: C
