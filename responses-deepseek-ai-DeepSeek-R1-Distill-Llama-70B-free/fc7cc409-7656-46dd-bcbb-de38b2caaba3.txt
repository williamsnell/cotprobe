Okay, so I've got this problem about Finkel Company accepting a draft and then discounting it. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that Finkel accepted a 90-day after sight draft for $850 on May 10. Then, on July 1, they discounted it at a 5% rate. There's also a bank collection fee of 1/4 percent. I need to find the proceeds, which probably means the amount of money Finkel gets after discounting the draft.

First, I need to understand the terms. An after sight draft means that the draft is payable a certain number of days after the seller presents it to the bank. So, Finkel probably received the draft on May 10, and the maturity date is 90 days later. But wait, when is the maturity date exactly? Let me calculate that.

May has 31 days, so from May 10 to May 31 is 21 days. Then adding 90 days would take us into August. Let me count: May 10 to June 10 is 30 days, which brings us to 11 days left in May (since 30 - 21 = 9? Wait, maybe I should think differently. Oh right, from May 10, adding 90 days: May has 31 days, so 31 -10 = 21 days left in May. So 90-21=69 days remaining. June has 30 days, so 69-30=39 into July. So the maturity date is July 39th? Wait, July only has 31 days, so 39-31=8. So August 8th? Hmm, maybe I need to double-check that, but I think for the purpose of discounting, the date might not matter as much as the number of days from the discount date to the maturity.

Wait, but the draft was discounted on July 1. So the time between July 1 and the maturity date is what determines the discount, I think. Because the bank is essentially buying the draft before it's due.

So first, I should find out how many days are between July 1 and the maturity date, which I thought was August 8. So from July 1 to August 1 is 31 days, and then from August 1 to August 8 is 7 days. So total 38 days? Wait, no, July 1 to August 1 is 31 days, but if the maturity is August 8, then it's 38 days (31 +8 -1? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. July has 31 days. So July 1 to July 31 is 30 days (since July 1 is day 1, July 2 is day 2, etc.). Then from July 31 to August 8 is 8 days. So total is 30 + 8 =38 days. So the draft has 38 days until maturity when it's discounted on July 1.

Wait, no. Wait, if the draft was accepted on May 10 with 90 days after sight, then the due date is August 8 (as above). But when it's discounted on July 1, the time remaining is from July 1 to August 8. How many days is that?

July 1 to July 31 is 31 days (since July 1 is day 1, July 31 is day 31). Then August 1 to August 8 is 8 days. So 31 +8 = 39 days. Wait, but wait, if the draft is due on August 8, then from July 1 (the discount date) to August 8 is 38 days? Because July 1 is day 0, then July 2 is day 1, July 31 is day 30, and August 1 is day 31, August 8 is day 38. Oh, right, because July has 31 days, so July 1 to July 31 is 30 days (since starting on July 1 as day 0, the next day is day 1). So adding 38 days to July 1 would be August 8. So the time from July 1 to the maturity is 38 days.

Wait, perhaps an alternative way: from May 10 to July 1 is how many days? May 10 to May 31 is 22 days (including May 10?), no. Wait, May 10 is the start date. So from May 10 to May 31: 31-10=21 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding 21 +30=51 days to reach June 30. Then July 1 is the next day, so from May 10 to July 1 is 51 +1=52 days. So the draft was accepted on May 10, 90 days after sight, so due date is May 10 +90 days. Let me compute that: May has 31 days. May 10 + 90 days is August 8, as before. So the discount happens on July 1, which is (July 1 to August 8) 38 days before maturity.

So the discount period is 38 days.

Now, the face value of the draft is $850. The discount rate is 5%, but I think that might be the annual rate. So the discount would be calculated based on the time remaining until maturity.

So to calculate the discount, I think we use the formula: discount = face value * (rate * time). But time is usually in years. So I need to convert 38 days into a fraction of a year.

Assuming a 360-day year for calculations (which is common in banking), 38 days is 38/360 years.

So the discount amount is 850 * 5% * (38/360).

Let me compute that. 5% is 0.05. So 850 * 0.05 = 42.5. Then multiply by (38/360). 

Wait wait, no, wait: 850 * 0.05 is 42.5. Then 42.5 * (38/360) = ?

Let me compute 38/360 first. 38 divided by 360 is approximately 0.105555... So 42.5 * 0.105555 = let's see, 42.5 * 0.1 is 4.25, 42.5 * 0.005555 is approximately 42.5 * 0.005555 = 0.23625. So total is approximately 4.48625. So about $4.49.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. 38/360 = 19/180 ≈ 0.1055555556.

So 850 * 0.05 = 42.5.

42.5 * (19/180) = ?

Let me compute 42.5 * 19 = 807.5. Then divide by 180.

807.5 / 180 = let's see. 180 *4=720, 807.5-720=87.5. 87.5/180=0.486111...

So 4 + 0.486111 = 4.486111... So approximately $4.486.

So the discount is about $4.486. So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount, minus any fees.

Wait, but there's also a collection fee of 1/4 percent. 1/4 percent is 0.25%. So that would be another fee charged by the bank. So I need to calculate that as well.

So the collection fee is 850 * 0.25% = 850 * 0.0025 = $2.125.

So the total deductions from the face value are the discount plus the collection fee.

Wait, no, wait. Are both of these deducted from the face value? Or is the collection fee separate?

I think the discount is the interest charged for the early payment, and the collection fee is an additional fee. So both would be subtracted from the face value.

So total deductions: discount ($4.486) + collection fee ($2.125) = $6.611.

So the proceeds would be $850 - $6.611 = $843.389. Rounding to cents, that's approximately $843.39.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $843.38. That's very close. Hmm, maybe I made a slight calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate the discount more precisely.

Discount = 850 * 5% * (38/360)

5% is 0.05. So 850 * 0.05 = 42.5.

42.5 * (38/360) = (42.5 *38)/360.

Compute 42.5 *38: 40*38=1520, 2.5*38=95. So total 1520+95=1615.

1615 / 360 = let's compute this.

360 *4 = 1440. 1615-1440=175.

175/360 = 0.486111... So 4.486111...

So discount is $4.486111.

Collection fee: 850 * 0.0025 = $2.125.

Total deductions: 4.486111 + 2.125 = 6.611111.

So proceeds: 850 -6.611111 = 843.388889, which is approximately $843.39.

The options are in dollars and cents, so $843.38 is option I, and $843.39 would round to $843.39. But perhaps in the calculation, the exact figure leads to $843.38 due to rounding during steps.

Wait, let me check the discount again.

Alternatively, maybe the discount is calculated using 360 days, but what if the calculation uses 365 days instead? Let me try that.

If using 365 days, 38/365 = approx 0.1041096.

So discount is 850 *0.05 *0.1041096.

850 *0.05 =42.5.

42.5 *0.1041096≈4.4232.

So discount ≈$4.4232.

Collection fee is still $2.125.

So total deductions: 4.4232 +2.125 =6.5482.

Proceeds: 850-6.5482=843.4518, which is about $843.45.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the original approach using 360 days is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the days are calculated differently. Let me recheck the days from July 1 to August 8.

July 1 is the starting point. So including July 1 or not? Wait, when you discount a draft, the discount period starts on the discount date.

So from July 1 to August 8: July has 31 days, so from July 1 to August 1 is 31 days, but since we're going from July 1 to August 8, that's 31 (July) +8 (August) =39 days. Wait, but if July 1 is day 0, then August 8 is day 38, because July 2 is day 1, up to August 8 being 38 days later.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of it as the number of days remaining after July 1 until August 8.

July 1 to July 31 is 30 days (since July 1 is counted as day 0, July 2 is day 1, and July 31 is day 30). Then, August 1 is day 31, August 8 is day 38.

So total of 38 days.

So with 38 days, using 360 days, that gives us 38/360.

So discount is 850 * 0.05 * (38/360) = 4.4861.

Proceeds would be 850 minus discount minus fee.

Wait, but perhaps the fee is calculated on the discounted amount or on the face value. The problem says the bank charges a (1/4)% collection fee. I think that's on the face value. So 0.25% of 850 is 2.125.

So total deductions: 4.4861 +2.125=6.6111.

So 850 -6.6111=843.3889, which is approximately $843.39. The closest option is I: $843.38, which is just a penny less. Maybe due to rounding in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the discount more precisely.

Let me compute 38/360 as a decimal exactly.

38 divided by 360: 360 goes into 380 once (360), remainder 20.

So 38/360 = 0.1055555...

So 850 * 0.05 =42.5.

42.5 * 0.1055555 = ?

Let me compute 42.5 * 0.1 =4.25. 42.5 * 0.0055555=?

0.0055555 is 1/180. So 42.5 * (1/180) =42.5 /180=0.236111...

So 4.25 +0.236111=4.486111.

So discount is exactly $4.486111.

Plus the collection fee of $2.125.

Total deductions: 4.486111 +2.125 =6.611111.

Proceeds: 850 -6.611111=843.388889, which is $843.388889.

Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $843.39. But the option I is $843.38, which is one cent less. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the collection fee again.

Wait, the collection fee is 1/4 percent, which is 0.25%, so 850 *0.0025=2.125. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the fee is applied after the discount? No, I think both are deducted from the face value. Because the bank takes both the discount and the fee when they give the proceeds.

So the total amount Finkel gets is 850 - discount - fee.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated on the net amount after the fee, but that doesn't make much sense. I think both are separate deductions.

Wait, let me think: when you discount a bill, the discount is based on the face value. Similarly, any fees are based on the face value. So both are subtracted from the face value.

So 850 - (discount + fee) = proceeds.

So that's correct.

So my calculation leads to approximately $843.39, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options, option I is $843.38, which is very close.

Ah, perhaps in the calculation of the discount, it's rounded to the nearest cent, which might reduce it by a penny.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the exact value is 843.38888..., which would round to $843.39, but perhaps in the problem, they rounded differently.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option I is $843.38, option D is $846.51, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the collection fee is applied after the discount? Let me think. Suppose the proceeds are calculated as (face value - discount) - fee. Or maybe the fee is a flat fee, so it's subtracted after the discount.

Wait, no, the collection fee is a percentage of the face value as well. So it's 0.25% of 850, which is 2.125, same as before.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the discount is calculated using 360 days, but with exact fraction, not rounded, but when calculating the fee, perhaps it's calculated on the discounted amount.

Wait, that might change things. Let me try that approach.

Wait, no, the collection fee is usually a fee for handling the collection, so it's based on the face value, not the discounted amount. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute everything more precisely, without rounding until the end.

Let me try that.

Compute discount:

850 * 0.05 =42.5.

38/360 = 0.10555555556.

42.5 * 0.10555555556 = 4.4861111111.

So discount is $4.4861111111.

Collection fee: 850 *0.0025=2.125.

Total deductions:4.4861111111 +2.125=6.6111111111.

Proceeds:850 -6.6111111111=843.388888889.

Rounded to cents, it's $843.39. But the options don't have that; the closest is I:843.38.

Wait, maybe the problem uses 360-day year but rounds the days differently. Or perhaps I made a mistake in counting the days.

Wait, perhaps the due date was miscalculated. Let me double-check the due date.

Draft accepted May 10, 90 days after sight.

So the due date is 90 days after May 10.

May has 31 days. From May 10, adding 90 days:

May 10 to May 31: 21 days (since 31-10+1=22 days, wait wait, no. From May 10 to May 31 inclusive is 22 days, but when adding days after, you don't include the starting day. So May 10 is day 0, May 11 is day 1, May 31 is day 21. So 21 days in May after May 10.

So 90 -21=69 days remaining.

June has 30 days, so 69-30=39 days into July.

So July 1 is day 1, July 39 is beyond the month because July has 31 days.

So 39-31=8, so August 8.

So yes, due date is August 8.

Discount date is July 1.

So days remaining: from July 1 to August 8.

July 1 to July 31 is 31 days. Then August 1 to August 8 is 8 days, totaling 39 days.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 38 days. Hmm, perhaps I messed up.

Wait, July 1 is the day the draft is discounted. So the time from July 1 to August 8 is 38 days because you count the days starting the next day.

Wait, no. When you have a time period, the number of days between July 1 and August 8 is calculated as:

From July 1 (day 1) to July 31 (day 31) is 31 days.

Then August 1 to August 8 is 8 days.

Wait, but if July 1 is day 0, then August 8 is day 38.

So the correct number of days is 38.

So perhaps the due date was correct, but the days remaining are 38.

So the calculation is correct
