Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum of the function f(x, y) = 2x - 5y, given the constraint that x² + y² = 144. Hmm, I remember that this looks like an optimization problem with a constraint, so maybe I should use Lagrange multipliers. 

Wait, what's Lagrange multipliers again? Oh right, it's a method to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints. So the idea is to introduce a multiplier (lambda) and set up equations based on the gradients. 

So the function to optimize is f(x,y) = 2x -5y. The constraint is g(x,y) = x² + y² - 144 = 0. 

The Lagrangian would be L = f(x,y) - lambda * g(x,y), which is 2x -5y - lambda(x² + y² -144). To find the extrema, I need to take the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and lambda, and set them equal to zero.

Let me compute the partial derivatives:

Partial derivative with respect to x:
dL/dx = 2 - lambda*(2x) = 0 → 2 = 2λx → λx = 1 → x = 1/(λ)

Partial derivative with respect to y:
dL/dy = -5 - lambda*(2y) = 0 → -5 = 2λy → y = (-5)/(2λ)

Partial derivative with respect to lambda:
dL/dλ = -(x² + y² -144) = 0 → x² + y² = 144 (which is our original constraint)

Now, from the first two equations, I can express x and y in terms of lambda. Let's substitute x and y into the constraint equation.

So x = 1/λ and y = (-5)/(2λ). Plugging into x² + y² =144:

(1/λ)^2 + [(-5)/(2λ)]^2 = 144
→ 1/(λ²) + 25/(4λ²) = 144
Combine the terms:

(4/(4λ²)) + (25/(4λ²)) )= 144
→ (29)/(4λ²) )= 144
So 4λ² * 29 = 144 *4?
Wait, wait. Let me compute this correctly.

Wait, 1/(λ²) is 1/(λ²), and 25/(4λ²) is another term. Adding them gives (4 +25)/(4λ²) )= 29/(4λ²) = 144.

So 29/(4λ²) =144 → λ² = 29/(4*144) → λ² = 29/(576) → λ = sqrt(29)/24 or negative sqrt(29)/24.

Wait, so lambda can be positive or negative. Let me compute both possibilities.

First, let's take lambda positive. So lambda = sqrt(29)/24.

Then x = 1/lambda = 24/sqrt(29). And y = (-5)/(2 lambda) = (-5 *24)/(2*sqrt(29)) )= (-60)/sqrt(29).

Alternatively, if lambda is negative, say lambda = -sqrt(29)/24.

Then x = 1/( -sqrt(29)/24 ) = -24/sqrt(29). And y = (-5)/(2*(-sqrt(29)/24)) ) = (-5)*(-24)/(2 sqrt(29)) )= (120)/(2 sqrt(29)) )=60/sqrt(29).

Wait, but wait. Let's compute these more carefully.

Wait, if lambda is positive, then x is positive, and y is negative. If lambda is negative, x is negative, and y is positive.

So for the two cases:

Case 1: lambda = sqrt(29)/24.

x = 24/sqrt(29)

y = (-5)*(24)/(2*sqrt(29)) )= (-60)/sqrt(29)

Case 2: lambda = -sqrt(29)/24.

x = 24/(-sqrt(29)) → x = -24/sqrt(29)

y = (-5)/(2*(-sqrt(29)/24)) → (-5)*(-24)/(2 sqrt(29)) )= (120)/(2 sqrt(29)) = 60/sqrt(29)

Now, I need to compute f(x,y) for both cases.

Case 1: f =2x -5y = 2*(24/sqrt(29)) -5*(-60/sqrt(29)) )

= (48/sqrt(29)) + 300/sqrt(29) ) = (348)/sqrt(29)

Case 2: f =2*(-24/sqrt(29)) -5*(60/sqrt(29)) )

= (-48/sqrt(29)) - 300/sqrt(29) )= (-348)/sqrt(29)

So the maximum is 348/sqrt(29), and the minimum is -348/sqrt(29).

Wait, but wait. Let's compute these numerical values.

sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385.

So 348 /5.385 ≈ 64.62. So in case 1, f is about 64.62, and case 2, it's about -64.62.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -64.62, and option G is 72, etc.

So the minimum is around -64.62, which is option B. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the options have specific numbers, and I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying.

Wait, earlier when I substituted x and y into the constraint:

x =1/λ, y= (-5)/(2λ)

So x² + y² = (1/λ²) + (25)/(4 λ²) )= (4 +25)/(4 λ²) )= 29/(4 λ²) =144.

So 29/(4 λ²) =144 → λ²=29/(4*144) → 29/(576) → λ= sqrt(29)/(24) or negative.

Wait, so 29 is 29, 4*144 is 576. Correct.

So when lambda is positive, x is positive, y is negative. When lambda is negative, x is negative, y is positive.

So when I compute f for case 1: 2x -5y.

x=24/sqrt(29), y= (-60)/sqrt(29).

So 2x is 48/sqrt(29), and -5y is -5*(-60)/sqrt(29) → 300/sqrt(29).

So 48 +300 is 348 → 348/sqrt(29) ≈ 64.62.

Case 2: x= -24/sqrt(29), y=60/sqrt(29).

Then 2x is -48/sqrt(29), and -5y is -5*(60)/sqrt(29) → -300/sqrt(29).

So 2x-5y is (-48 -300)/sqrt(29) → -348/sqrt(29) ≈ -64.62.

So the minimum is approximately -64.62. Looking at the options, option B is -64.62, so that's the answer.

Wait, but another approach: using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Because f(x,y) is a linear function, and the constraint is the equation of a circle. So the maximum and minimum of f occur where the vector (2, -5) is in the same or opposite direction as (x,y).

So the maximum value is the magnitude of (2,-5) times the radius, and the minimum is the negative of that.

Wait, the magnitude of (2,-5) is sqrt(2² + (-5)^2) )= sqrt(4+25)=sqrt(29). The radius of the circle is sqrt(144)=12.

So the maximum is 12*sqrt(29) ≈ 12*5.385≈64.62. The minimum is -64.62, which matches what I found earlier.

So the minimum is -64.62, which is option B.
</think>

To find the minimum of \( f(x, y) = 2x - 5y \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 144 \), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The constraint represents a circle of radius 12, and the function \( f(x, y) \) is linear. The extrema occur where the gradient of \( f \) is parallel to the gradient of the constraint.

### Step 1: Set up the Lagrangian
The Lagrangian is:
\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 2x - 5y - \lambda(x^2 + y^2 - 144).
\]

### Step 2: Compute partial derivatives
Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 2 - 2\lambda x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{1}{\lambda},
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = -5 - 2\lambda y = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{-5}{2\lambda},
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = -(x^2 + y^2 - 144) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 + y^2 = 144.
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( x \) and \( y \) into the constraint
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\lambda} \) and \( y = \frac{-5}{2\lambda} \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 144 \):
\[
\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{-5}{2\lambda}\right)^2 = 144,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda^2} + \frac{25}{4\lambda^2} = 144.
\]
Combining terms:
\[
\frac{29}{4\lambda^2} = 144 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda^2 = \frac{29}{576} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \pm \frac{\sqrt{29}}{24}.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \) and \( y \)
For \( \lambda = \frac{\sqrt{29}}{24} \):
\[
x = \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{24}{\sqrt{29}}, \quad y = \frac{-5}{2\lambda} = \frac{-60}{\sqrt{29}}.
\]
For \( \lambda = -\frac{\sqrt{29}}{24} \):
\[
x = \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{-24}{\sqrt{29}}, \quad y = \frac{-5}{2\lambda} = \frac{60}{\sqrt{29}}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( f(x, y) \) for both cases
For \( \lambda = \frac{\sqrt{29}}{24} \):
\[
f(x, y) = 2x - 5y = 2\left(\frac{24}{\sqrt{29}}\right) - 5\left(\frac{-60}{\sqrt{29}}\right) = \frac{48}{\sqrt{29}} + \frac{300}{\sqrt{29}} = \frac{348}{\sqrt{29}} \approx 64.62.
\]
For \( \lambda = -\frac{\sqrt{29}}{24} \):
\[
f(x, y) = 2x - 5y = 2\left(\frac{-24}{\sqrt{29}}\right) - 5\left(\frac{60}{\sqrt{29}}\right) = \frac{-48}{\sqrt{29}} - \frac{300}{\sqrt{29}} = \frac{-348}{\sqrt{29}} \approx -64.62.
\]

### Step 6: Verify using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
The function \( f(x, y) = 2x - 5y \) is linear, and the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 144 \) represents a circle of radius 12. The extrema of \( f(x, y) \) occur when the vector \( (2, -5) \) is aligned with the circle. The magnitude of \( (2, -5) \) is \( \sqrt{2^2 + (-5)^2} = \sqrt{29} \), and the maximum and minimum values of \( f(x, y) \) are \( \pm 12\sqrt{29} \). Numerically, \( 12\sqrt{29} \approx 64.62 \), so the minimum is \( -64.62 \).

### Final Answer
The minimum value of \( f(x, y) \) is approximately \( -64.62 \), which corresponds to **option B**.
