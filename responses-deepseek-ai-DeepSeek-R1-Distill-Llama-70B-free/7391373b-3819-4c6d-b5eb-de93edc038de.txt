Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about legal ethics, specifically dealing with attorney-client privilege. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question is about a lawyer being subpoenaed to a deposition and being asked to reveal confidential client information about a former client. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that attorney-client privilege is a key concept here. The privilege means that communications between a lawyer and their client are confidential and can't be disclosed without the client's consent, except in certain situations.

The scenario is a deposition. So, the opposing attorney is asking the lawyer to provide confidential information. The lawyer must decide whether to comply or not.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Provide info only if it favors the former client. That doesn't sound right. The privilege isn't about the content's favorability; it's about confidentiality regardless.

Option B: Provide if the client gave verbal permission. Wait, I think the client's consent should be in writing usually, but I'm not entirely sure if verbal is enough. But more importantly, does the client's permission even matter if they're a former client? I think the privilege continues even after the attorney-client relationship ends, so the former client would need to waive it.

Option C: Provide info if it's pertinent. No, pertinence doesn't override privilege. The lawyer can't decide on their own what's relevant; that's for the court to decide if privilege is invoked.

Option D: Provide if the opposing attorney insists. No, the lawyer's duty is to maintain confidentiality regardless of pressure from the opposing side.

Option E: Refuse unless the client is present. I don't think the client's presence is required for the lawyer to assert privilege. The lawyer can invoke it on their own.

Option F: Disclose if it's been a reasonable time since the relationship ended. Time doesn't negate the privilege. It's not about how long ago it was.

Option G: Provide because privilege is waived. Wait, when is privilege waived? If the client discloses it to someone else, or if it's a crime or fraud. But in this case, the lawyer is being asked, so unless the client has waived it, the lawyer shouldn't disclose.

Option H: Provide if it doesn't harm the client. The lawyer's duty is to protect confidentiality, not decide based on harm. Plus, it's not their call to make.

Option I: Assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. That sounds correct. The lawyer should invoke the privilege and refuse to disclose unless the client has waived it in writing.

Option J: Refuse without a court order. Well, the lawyer can assert the privilege, but sometimes a court might order disclosure if the privilege doesn't apply. So if the court orders it, the lawyer might have to comply. So J says refuse without a court order, but I think the correct approach is to assert the privilege, which would involve refusing unless the client waives it or a court compels it. So I think J is partially correct but not the best answer. Because the question is in a deposition where they're subpoenaed, the lawyer would assert the privilege, and if the opposing side insists, the matter would go to the court. So the immediate response is to assert the privilege, which is option I.

Wait, but in some cases, the court might order the lawyer to disclose if the privilege doesn't apply. But the question is about what the lawyer should do when asked. The correct response is to assert the privilege unless the client has waived it. So option I is the correct choice.

Another thought: if the client is a former client, the privilege still applies unless waived. So the lawyer must assert it unless the former client has given permission.

So looking back, the correct answer should be I: assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver.

The correct answer is based on the principle of attorney-client privilege, which protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client. This privilege persists even after the attorney-client relationship has ended. When faced with a subpoena requesting confidential information during a deposition, the lawyer's duty is to maintain confidentiality and assert the privilege. The lawyer should refuse to disclose the information unless the former client has explicitly waived the privilege, typically through a written waiver. 

Option I correctly reflects this principle by stating that the lawyer should assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. Other options either misunderstand the scope of the privilege, incorrectly condition disclosure on irrelevant factors, or fail to prioritize the lawyer's ethical obligation to protect confidentiality.

Answer: I
