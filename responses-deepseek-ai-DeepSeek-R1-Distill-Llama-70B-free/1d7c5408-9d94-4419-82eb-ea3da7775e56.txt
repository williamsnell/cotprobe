Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about aggregate demand and supply. Let me think this through step by step. 

The question is asking what happens to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output when the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, assuming a Classical aggregate supply curve. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that in economics, the aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) curves determine the equilibrium price level and the level of real output in an economy. 

I think the Classical aggregate supply curve is vertical, which means that it's price-level independent. So, the quantity of output is fixed at the economy's potential level, which is determined by factors like technology and resources. So, in the Classical view, the AS curve is vertical because, beyond the full employment level, output can't increase without causing inflation.

Now, if the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, that means it's an increase in AD. AD shifting right implies that at every price level, the quantity of real GDP demanded is higher. 

In a typical Keynesian scenario with a horizontal AS curve (like in the extreme case of a depression), a right shift in AD would increase both the price level and real output. But wait, in the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical. So, in that case, if AD increases, what happens?

If the AS is vertical (let's say at Y_full), then any shift in AD would only affect the price level, not the quantity of output. Because the economy is already producing at its maximum capacity. So, if AD increases, the demand for goods and services goes up, but since output can't increase beyond Y_full, the price level must rise. 

So, putting that together: AD shifts right â†’ equilibrium price level increases, but the quantity of output remains the same because AS is vertical (quantity is fixed). 

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches that. 

Option B says the price level increases and quantity remains unchanged. That fits. Option J says both increase, which would be the case if AS was not vertical. Option F says price remains same and quantity increases, which doesn't fit here. Option A says both remain same, which isn't right because AD did shift. 

So the correct answer should be B. But wait, let me double-check. In the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical at Y_full (potential output). So if AD shifts right, the equilibrium moves along the AS curve. But since the AS is vertical, the quantity doesn't change, only the price does. So yes, that's correct.

When the aggregate demand (AD) curve shifts to the right, it indicates an increase in the quantity of real GDP demanded at every price level. In the Classical model, the aggregate supply (AS) curve is vertical, meaning the quantity of output is fixed at the economy's potential level (Y_full), determined by factors like technology and resources. 

Since the AS curve is vertical, any shift in AD will not affect the equilibrium quantity of output, as it remains at Y_full. However, the increase in AD will lead to a higher equilibrium price level. Therefore, the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.

The correct answer is **B: The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.**
