Question:

Before a proposal to merge two towns was placed on a ballot, the state attorney general issued an advisory opinion stating that the measure did not, in her opinion, violate any statutory or constitutional provisions. Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both towns. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from one of the towns initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the proposal. The suit reached the state supreme court and was found to be constitutional under both state and federal law. The plaintiffs now file a motion seeking to have thiscase reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court. The Court may

Options:

A: not hear the case, because it was decided on independent state grounds.
B: not hear the case, because the U.S. Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over state matters
C: not hear the case, but may have it remanded to federal district court.
D: hear the case because it involves a constitutional issue
E: hear the federal issues involved, but decline to rule on the state issue.
F: hear the case, but only rule on the constitutionality of the merger
G: hear the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs have a right to a federal hearing
H: rely on the advisory opinion rendered by the state attorney general and not hear the case on its merits.
I: not hear the case, because the U.S. Supreme Court does not review state supreme court decisions unless federal law is violated.
J: not hear the case, because the state supreme court's decision is final

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a situation where two towns are merging. Before the proposal was on the ballot, the state attorney general gave an advisory opinion saying the measure didn't violate any laws or the constitution. Then the voters passed it overwhelmingly. After the election, but before the merger was official, two taxpayers sued to stop it, claiming it's unconstitutional. The state supreme court ruled it's constitutional under both state and federal law. Now, the plaintiffs want the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.

The question is asking what the U.S. Supreme Court may do. The options are A through J.

I remember that the U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to review state court decisions, particularly when there's a federal question involved. The key here is understanding what the Court can and cannot do in terms of reviewing state cases.

So, first, the state supreme court decided the case on both state and federal grounds. They found the proposal constitutional on both levels. The plaintiffs are now seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court.

I think the main issue is whether the U.S. Supreme Court can hear the case when the state court's decision was based on both state and federal law. I remember something about the "adequate and independent state grounds" doctrine. If a state court decision is based on independent state grounds that are adequate to dispose of the case, then the U.S. Supreme Court typically won't review it. But if there's a federal issue involved, the Court might take it.

Wait, but in this case, the state court ruled on both state and federal issues. They upheld the proposal on both grounds. So, the state court's decision rested on federal law as well. Therefore, the U.S. Supreme Court can review the federal question because the state decision wasn't based solely on state law.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the Court may not hear the case because it was decided on independent state grounds. But the state court also decided a federal issue, so A might not be correct.

Option B says the Court doesn't have jurisdiction over state matters. That's incorrect because the Court does have jurisdiction over federal questions, regardless of whether it's a state matter.

Option C suggests remanding to federal district court. That doesn't make sense because the case was already decided by the state's highest court. The U.S. Supreme Court can choose to review it directly, not remand to a lower federal court.

Option D says the Court will hear it because it's a constitutional issue. The case does involve a constitutional issue, so that's a possibility. But I'm not sure if that's the only reason they would hear it.

Option E says they'll hear the federal issues but not the state. That sounds plausible because the Court can choose to review only the federal questions without touching the state issues.

Option F says they'll hear it and rule only on the merger's constitutionality. But the case is about the constitutionality, so this might be too narrow.

Option G claims the plaintiffs have a right to a federal hearing. I don't think that's accurate. The Supreme Court has discretion over which cases it hears, so it's not a right unless it's a matter of federal law.

Option H talks about the advisory opinion. Advisory opinions aren't binding, so the Court wouldn't rely on that to refuse the case.

Option I says the Court doesn't review unless federal law is violated. But if there's a federal issue, they can review it regardless. Plus, the state court already upheld it, so this might not apply.

Option J says the state court's decision is final. But the U.S. Supreme Court can review state court decisions when there's a federal question, so J is incorrect.

So, putting it together, since the state court's decision was based on both state and federal grounds, the U.S. Supreme Court can review the federal issues. They don't have to hear the state issues, but they can address the federal aspects. So Option E seems correct.

Wait, but another thought: does the Court have to take the case if there's a federal issue? Or can they decline it even if there's a federal question? Because the Court has discretionary review via certiorari, they can choose which cases to take. But the question is about what the Court may do, not must do.

In this scenario, the Court has the option to hear the federal issues. So they could hear the case on the federal grounds but not necessarily the state ones. So Option E is possible.

Alternatively, Option D says they'll hear it because it's a constitutional issue. The case does involve constitutional issues, so that would also be a reason. But I'm trying to remember the nuances of Supreme Court jurisdiction.

I think the key is that when a state court decision rests on both state and federal grounds, and if the federal issues are adequate to dispose of the case, the U.S. Supreme Court can review it. But if the state ground is independent and adequate, then the Court won't. In this case, the state court upheld the merger on both state and federal grounds, so there's a federal issue that the Court can review. Therefore, the Court may hear the case on the federal issues.

So the correct answer would be E: hear the federal issues involved, but decline to rule on the state issue.

The U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to review state court decisions when federal questions are involved. In this case, the state supreme court upheld the merger on both state and federal constitutional grounds. Under the "adequate and independent state grounds" doctrine, the U.S. Supreme Court typically does not review cases where the state court's decision is based solely on independent state grounds. However, since the state court also addressed federal constitutional issues, the U.S. Supreme Court may choose to review the federal aspects of the case.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the state court's decision was not based solely on independent state grounds; it also addressed federal issues.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court does have jurisdiction over federal questions, even if they arise in state cases.
- **Option C** is incorrect because remanding to federal district court is unnecessary, as the case was already decided by the state's highest court.
- **Option D** is plausible but less precise, as the Court's decision to hear the case is specifically tied to the federal constitutional issues, not just the presence of a constitutional issue.
- **Option E** is correct because the U.S. Supreme Court can choose to review the federal issues while declining to address the state issues.
- **Option F** is too narrow, as the case involves broader constitutional issues beyond just the merger's constitutionality.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the plaintiffs do not have an automatic right to a federal hearing; the Court has discretionary review.
- **Option H** is incorrect because the advisory opinion is non-binding and does not influence the Court's decision to hear the case.
- **Option I** is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court can review state court decisions when federal law is at issue, regardless of whether it was "violated."
- **Option J** is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court can review state court decisions involving federal questions.

The most accurate answer is **Option E**, as the U.S. Supreme Court may choose to hear the federal issues involved while declining to rule on the state issues.
