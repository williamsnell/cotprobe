Okay, so I've got this problem about specific rotation and observed rotations of a cholesterol solution. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that specific rotation is a property of a compound that depends on the wavelength of light, temperature, and the concentration of the solution. Oh wait, and the formula for specific rotation is [α] = observed rotation (α) divided by the concentration (c) times the length of the tube (l). Right, the formula is [α] = α/(c*l). 

So the problem has three parts: (a), (b), and (c). Let me start with part (a).

Part (a): Calculate the specific rotation of cholesterol. The given data is 6.15 g of cholesterol in 100 ml of chloroform. And when a portion is placed in a 5 cm tube, the observed rotation is -1.2 degrees. 

Wait, but the concentration is given in grams per 100 ml. I think I need to convert that into grams per 100 ml, but wait, no—wait, the formula uses concentration in grams per ml, or is it per decimeter? Oh right, the standard formula uses g per 100 ml, because the tube length is in decimeters. So 100 ml is 0.1 liters, but wait, no, the units are grams/100ml. Because for specific rotation, c is in g/100ml and l is in dm (which is 10 cm). Wait, no, wait—wait, the units for specific rotation are typically degrees per (g/100ml) per decimeter. So the formula is [α] = α (degrees) / (c (g/100ml) * l (dm)).

Wait, the tube length is given in cm, so I need to convert that to dm. Since 1 dm is 10 cm, a 5 cm tube is 0.5 dm.

The concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, so that's 6.15 g/100ml, which is already correct for c.

So the observed rotation α is -1.2 degrees.

Putting it all into the formula: [α] = (-1.2) / (6.15 * 0.5). Let me compute that.

First, calculate the denominator: 6.15 * 0.5 = 3.075. Then, [α] = -1.2 / 3.075. Let me do the division.

1.2 divided by 3.075. So 3.075 times 0.39 is about 1.19925, which is close to 1.2. Because 3 *0.39 is 1.17, and 0.075 *0.39 is about 0.02925. So 1.17 +0.02925 = 1.19925. So 1.2/3.075 is approximately 0.39. So [α] is approximately -0.39 *100? Wait no, wait. Wait, no: no, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Because 1.2 divided by 3.075 is 1.2/3.075.

Wait, alternatively, 3.075 *0.39 is 1.19925, which is almost 1.2, so 1.2 /3.075 is about 0.39. So [α] is -0.39 degrees/(g/100ml * dm). Wait, but wait, the units are in degrees per (g/100ml) per decimeter. So [α] is -0.39 *100? No, wait, no. No, because the unit is [α] in degrees·dm⁻¹·g⁻¹/100ml? Wait, maybe I should think about the units again.

Wait, specific rotation [α] is defined as the observed rotation (in degrees) divided by (concentration in g/100ml) multiplied by (length in dm). So [α] has units of degrees·dm⁻¹·(g/100ml)⁻¹, which is equivalent to degrees per (g per 100ml per dm). So in this case, [α] is calculated as -1.2 divided by (6.15 * 0.5), which is 3.075. So -1.2 /3.075 is approximately -0.3902. 

Wait, but that's like approximately -0.39. But looking at the options, the specific rotations are all in the tens. For example, option A is -39.0, which is much larger than what I'm calculating.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, [α] = α/(c*l), where c is in g/100ml and l is in dm. So l is 5 cm, which is 0.5 dm. So yes, 6.15 g/100ml, 0.5 dm.

So [α] = (-1.2) / (6.15 * 0.5) = (-1.2)/(3.075) ≈ -0.3902.

Wait, but wait, that's about -0.39, but none of the options in part a are that. Oh wait, looking at the options, part a is the first value in each option, and they are all in the 30s and 40s. So maybe I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait another thought: perhaps the concentration is 6.15g per 100ml, but when using the formula, the concentration should be in grams per dm³? Because 100ml is 0.1 dm³. Wait, no, the formula uses c in g per 100ml, so no, I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute 1.2 /3.075 accurately.

3.075 times 0.39 is 1.19925. So 1.2 is 1.19925 + 0.00075, so 0.39 + (0.00075 /3.075) = 0.39 + 0.000244 ≈ 0.390244. So [α] is approximately -0.390244.

Wait, but that's about -0.39, but the options are around -36 to -42. So, obviously, I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere. Because 0.39 is 39 tenths, but perhaps I should have it in hundreds.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, wait, no, wait. The formula is [α] = α / (c * l), where c is in grams per 100 ml, and l is in decimeters. So, 5 cm is 0.5 dm. So, correct.

Wait, but 1.2 / (6.15 *0.5) = 1.2 /3.075 = approx 0.3902. So [α] is approximately -0.3902. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the given concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, but maybe I should convert that to grams per liter or something else.

Wait, 6.15 g/100ml is equal to 61.5 g/liter. But the formula uses c in g/100ml. So perhaps I'm correct.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the calculation. Because 6.15 g/100ml is 0.0615 g/ml. But I don't think that's right because the formula uses g/100ml.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose I have to compute [α] as (observed rotation) / (c * l). So, c is 6.15 g per 100ml, which is 6.15 g/0.1 L, which is 61.5 g/L. But the formula uses c in g per 100ml, so 6.15 is correct.

Wait, maybe I should multiply by 100 because the units are in terms of 100ml. Let me think. So, c is 6.15 g/100ml. So, when I use c*l, with l in dm, which is 0.5 dm. So 6.15 * 0.5 = 3.075 (unit: g*dm / 100ml). Hmm, perhaps I should consider the units more carefully, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1.2 divided by 3.075 again.

3.075 * 0.39 = 1.19925, which is close to 1.2. So 1.2 /3.075 ≈ 0.39. So [α] is -0.39, but the options are all in the range of -36 to -42. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the tube length. Wait, the tube is 5 cm, which is 0.5 dm. Yes, correct.

Wait, maybe I should multiply by 10 somewhere. Because I'm getting [α] as -0.39, but the options are in the -39 range. So perhaps I forgot to multiply by 10, maybe because of a unit confusion.

Wait, here's another approach. The specific rotation is often expressed as [α]° (degrees) at a certain wavelength and temperature. The formula is [α] = (α) / (c * l), where c is concentration in g/100ml and l is in dm. So, if the calculation gives [α] = -0.39, but the options are around -39, perhaps I missed a factor of 100.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the concentration was given as 6.15g per 100ml, but when using the formula, I should use it as 6.15 g per 100ml. So, no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses c in g per liter. Let me see. If I use c as 61.5 g/L (since 6.15g/100ml is 61.5g/L), but then the formula would be [α] = α / (c * l), with c in g/L and l in meters. Wait, that's probably not correct. Because, the standard units are g/100ml and dm.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate with c as 61.5 g/L.

But wait, 1 L is 10 dm³, so 1 g/L is 0.1 g per dm³. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the units wrong. Let me think.

Another approach: Let's look for an example. Suppose a solution has a concentration of c g/100ml, and a path length l cm. Then [α] = α / (c * l), but wait, no—because l needs to be in dm. So in this problem, l is 5 cm = 0.5 dm.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula again. Oh, right, the specific rotation [α] is calculated as [α] = α / (c * l), where α is the observed rotation in degrees, c is concentration in g/100ml, and l is the path length in dm. So, that's correct.

So, given that, I should have [α] = (-1.2) / (6.15 * 0.5) = -1.2 /3.075 = approx -0.3902. But that's around -0.39, not matching any option. So, perhaps the calculation is correct, but I'm looking at the options wrong.

Wait, looking at the options, each option has three values. So part (a) is the first value, (b) the second, (c) the third. So I'm looking for part (a) to be around -39. So perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Wait, wait! Oh! Because 0.39 multiplied by 100 gives 39. So maybe I should express the specific rotation as -39.0, which would be option A or I or J.

Wait, but why would the specific rotation be multiplied by 100? No, the specific rotation is in degrees, and the calculation gives [α] as -0.39 degrees. But that's not possible because specific rotations are usually in the range of tens. For example, sucrose has a specific rotation around +66. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied by 100 because the concentration is in g/100ml, so when I calculate [α], it's in degrees per (g/100ml) per dm, which would be (degrees * 100ml/g) per dm. So if I have [α] as 0.39 degrees per (g/100ml) per dm, that's equivalent to 39 degrees per (g/dm³) per dm. Hmm, maybe that's the confusion.

Wait, perhaps I should recast the formula in terms of g/dm³. Because 100ml is 0.1 dm³, so 6.15 g/100ml is 61.5 g/dm³. Then, if I use c in g/dm³ and l in meters, but that complicates things because the formula expects c in g/100ml and l in dm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator. Let me compute 6.15 multiplied by 0.5 again: 6.15 *0.5 = 3.075. Correct.

Wait, but 1.2 divided by 3.075 is approximately 0.3902. So [α] is approximately -0.3902. But that's nowhere near the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the concentration is in grams per liter, not per 100ml. Because 100ml is 0.1 liters. So 6.15g/0.1L is 61.5g/L. But then, using c as 61.5 g/L and l as 0.5 dm (5cm), then [α] = (-1.2) / (61.5 *0.5) = (-1.2)/(30.75) ≈ -0.039, which is even smaller. That doesn't help.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let's try another approach. Let's plug in the numbers for one of the options and see if it leads to the observed rotation of -1.2 degrees.

Take option A: specific rotation [α] is -39.0. So, using the formula, α = [α] * c * l.

c is 6.15 g/100ml, l is 0.5 dm. So α = (-39.0) *6.15 *0.5.

Compute that: 6.15 *0.5 is 3.075. 3.075 *39 is let's see: 3*39=117, 0.075*39=2.925. So 117 +2.925 =119.925. So 3.075 *39=119.925. So α= -119.925 degrees? That's way bigger than the observed -1.2.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is [α] = α / (c * l), so α = [α] * c * l. So with [α] as -39.0, c=6.15, l=0.5, then α should be [α]*c*l = (-39) *6.15 *0.5.

Compute 6.15 *0.5 =3.075. Then 3.075 *39=119.925, so α would be -119.925, which is way off from the given -1.2. So option A can't be correct for part (a). So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the formula. Maybe [α] is (α * 100) / (c * l) because the concentration is in g/100ml. Let me try that.

So [α] = (α *100) / (c * l) = (-1.2 *100)/(6.15 *0.5) = (-120)/(3.075) ≈ -39.0. Ah, that makes sense. So [α] is approximately -39.0. That would match option A's first value. But why did I think of multiplying by 100?

Wait, perhaps the formula is different when using certain units. Let me think again. The standard formula is [α] = α/(c*l), where c is in g/100ml and l is in dm. So, when I compute [α], it's in degrees per (g/100ml per dm). So, if I have α=-1.2, c=6.15, l=0.5, then [α]= (-1.2)/(6.15*0.5)= (-1.2)/(3.075)= approx -0.3902. But that would be [α] as approximately -0.39. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the concentration is in g/ml or g/100ml. Because if I take c as 0.0615 g/ml (since 6.15g/100ml = 0.0615g/ml), then c*l would be 0.0615 *5ml? No, wait, l is in cm, which is 5 cm, but in the formula, l is in dm, so 0.5 dm. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the concentration is 6.15g per 100ml, which is 0.0615 g/ml. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula without worrying about units. Let's see:

The observed rotation α is given by α = [α] * c * l, where c is in g/100ml and l is in dm.

So, in our case, α = -1.2 = [α] *6.15 *0.5.

So [α] = (-1.2) / (6.15 *0.5) = (-1.2)/3.075 = -0.3902.

But none of the options have that, so perhaps the correct approach is to multiply by 100 somewhere. But why? Maybe because of unit conversion from dm to cm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the path length is in cm, so I should convert it to dm. 5 cm is 0.5 dm, which I did. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses c in g/100ml and l in cm, so I should not have converted cm to dm. Let me try that.

So, if l is 5 cm, and c is 6.15 g/100ml
