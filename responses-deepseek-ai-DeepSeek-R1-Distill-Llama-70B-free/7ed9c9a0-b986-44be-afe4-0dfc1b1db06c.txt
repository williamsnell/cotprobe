Okay, so I have this problem about radiation dosage and safe distances. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question says that the maximum permissible dosage for workers is 6.25 milliroentgens per hour. Oh wait, milliroentgens is like a thousandth of a roentgen, right? So 6.25 mR/h is the same as 0.00625 R/h. Got it.

The problem gives me a cobalt-60 source. Cobalt-60 emits gamma rays, so that's the gamma radiation they're talking about. The dose rate is 27 R per hour at 1 meter distance. But wait, the source is in a lead container which reduces the gamma radiation to 1% of what it was before. So the effective dose rate after the lead is 1% of 27 R/h. Let me calculate that: 0.01 * 27 R/h = 0.27 R/h at 1 meter.

Wait, but that's after the lead container. So the initial dose rate without the lead is 27 R/h at 1m. But with the lead, it's 0.27 R/h at 1m. Now, the question is asking for the safe working distance when using this setup. Or maybe first, without the lead, and then with the lead, how much closer can they work.

But wait, no. Let me read again. The source is used in a lead container which reduces the gamma radiation to 1%. So the 27 R/h is the initial dose rate at 1m without the container. So with the container, the dose rate becomes 1% of that, which is 0.27 R/h at 1m. So now, we have to find the maximum distance where the dose rate is 6.25 mR/h, which is 0.00625 R/h.

Wait, no. Because the 6.25 mR/h is the maximum allowed. So first, I need to find the distance without the container where the dose is 0.00625 R/h. But wait, the question is asking for the safe working distance when the source is in the container. No, wait, maybe it's phrased differently. Let me read again.

The question is phrased as: What is the safe working distance from a 20-Ci source of cobalt-60 which has a dose rate of 27 R per hour at a distance of 1m? If the source is used in a lead container which reduces the gamma-radiation emitted to 1%, how much closer can the scientists work?

Wait, so I think the question is split into two parts. First, without the lead container, what's the safe distance? Because 27 R/h at 1m is way higher than the allowed 6.25 mR/h. Then, with the lead, which reduces the emitted gamma to 1%, so the dose rate at 1m becomes 0.27 R/h, and then find the safe distance again. Then, compare the two distances to see how much closer they can work.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about when the source is in the container, but that doesn't make sense because the first part of the question is about the 20-Ci source with a certain dose rate. Hmm, the way the question is phrased, it's asking for two things: the safe distance without the container, and then with the container in place, how much closer can they work. Or wait, perhaps it's more about the initial setup without the container, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to parse it.

The first part says: What is the safe working distance from a 20-Ci source of cobalt-60 which has a dose rate of 27 R per hour at 1m. So that's without the container. Then, the second part is, if the source is used in a lead container which reduces the gamma radiation emitted to 1%, how much closer can the scientists work?

Wait, so the initial scenario is without the lead container, and the dose rate is 27 R/h at 1m. Then, when using the lead container, the dose rate is 1% of 27 R/h, which is 0.27 R/h at 1m. Then, in each scenario, find the safe distance where the dose is 6.25 mR/h.

So, first, find the distance where the dose is 6.25 mR/h (0.00625 R/h) when the dose rate at 1m is 27 R/h. Then, find the distance where the same 6.25 mR/h is achieved when the source is in the container, leading to a higher possible dose rate (0.27 R/h at 1m). So the distances will be different, and the second distance will be smaller, meaning they can work closer.

The formula I remember for radiation exposure with distance is the inverse square law. The dose rate is proportional to the inverse square of the distance. So, Dose rate at distance d is Dose_rate = Dose_rate_at_1m / (d^2).

Wait, but wait, the initial dose rate is 27 R/h at 1m. So when you're at distance d, the dose rate is 27 / (d)^2. We need this to be equal to 6.25 mR/h, which is 0.00625 R/h.

So, 27 / d^2 = 0.00625 → solving for d^2: d^2 = 27 / 0.00625 → 27 / 0.00625.

Let me calculate that. 0.00625 is 1/160, so 27 * 160 = 4320. So d^2 = 4320 → d = sqrt(4320). Hmm, sqrt(4096) is 64, sqrt(4356)=66, so sqrt(4320) is about 65.7 meters.

Wait, but wait, that would be the distance without the container. Now, with the container, the dose rate at 1m is 0.27 R/h. So the new allowed distance would be when 0.27 / d'^2 = 0.00625 → d'^2 = 0.27 / 0.00625 → 0.27 / 0.00625 = 43.2 → d' = sqrt(43.2) ≈ 6.57 meters.

So the original distance without the container is about 65.7 meters, and with the container, it's 6.57 meters. So the scientists can work much closer, by 65.7 -6.57 = 59.13 meters closer. Wait, but the question is how much closer, so the ratio would be 65.7 / 6.57 ≈ 10 times.

Wait, but the options are giving pairs, like first option A is 80 m and 8 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check again.

Wait, the initial setup: the source is 20 Ci, but the problem gives the dose rate at 1m as 27 R/h. So the initial setup without the container: 27 R/h at 1m.

So, when without the container, the safe distance would be when 27 / d^2 = 0.00625 R/h.

So d^2 = 27 / 0.00625 → 27 * 160 = 4320 → d = sqrt(4320) ≈ 65.7 m.

Then, with the container, the dose rate at 1m is 1% of 27 R/h, which is 0.27 R/h. So the new safe distance d' is where 0.27 / (d')^2 = 0.00625 → d'^2 = 0.27 / 0.00625 → 0.27 / 0.00625 = 43.2 → d' ≈ sqrt(43.2) ≈ 6.57 m.

So the two distances are approximately 65.7 m and 6.57 m.

The options have G as 65.7 and 6.57 → G: 65.7 m and 6.57 m.

Wait, but let me look at the options:

Options:

G: 65.7 m and 6.57 m

Yes, that's option G.

So the answer should be G.
</think>

To determine the safe working distance from the cobalt-60 source, we use the inverse square law for radiation exposure. The dose rate is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. The formula is:

\[
\text{Dose rate at distance } d = \frac{\text{Dose rate at 1m}}{d^2}
\]

### Step 1: Without the lead container
The dose rate at 1m is given as 27 R/h. The maximum permissible dose rate for workers is 6.25 mR/h, which is equivalent to 0.00625 R/h. Setting up the equation:

\[
\frac{27}{d^2} = 0.00625
\]

Solving for \(d^2\):

\[
d^2 = \frac{27}{0.00625} = 4320
\]

\[
d = \sqrt{4320} \approx 65.7 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the safe working distance without the lead container is approximately **65.7 meters**.

### Step 2: With the lead container
The lead container reduces the gamma radiation to 1% of its original value. Therefore, the dose rate at 1m becomes:

\[
\text{Dose rate at 1m with lead} = 0.01 \times 27 = 0.27 \, \text{R/h}
\]

Using the same formula to find the safe working distance:

\[
\frac{0.27}{d'^2} = 0.00625
\]

Solving for \(d'^2\):

\[
d'^2 = \frac{0.27}{0.00625} = 43.2
\]

\[
d' = \sqrt{43.2} \approx 6.57 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the safe working distance with the lead container is approximately **6.57 meters**.

### How much closer can the scientists work?
The difference in distances is:

\[
65.7 \, \text{m} - 6.57 \, \text{m} \approx 59.13 \, \text{m}
\]

This means the scientists can work significantly closer when the lead container is used.

### Final Answer
The safe working distances are **65.7 meters** without the lead container and **6.57 meters** with the lead container. Comparing these, the scientists can work about **59.13 meters closer** when the lead container is used.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**G: 65.7 m and 6.57 m**
