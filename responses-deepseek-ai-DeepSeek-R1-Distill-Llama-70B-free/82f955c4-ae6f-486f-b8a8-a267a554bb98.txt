Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the coronal suture. Hmm, I remember that sutures are the connections between bones in the skull. The coronal suture is one of them, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

Wait, the coronal suture is the one that runs across the top of the skull, right? Like, if you imagine a crown, that's where it gets its name. So it's probably connecting the frontal bone to something else. Oh, right! The frontal bone is the one in the forehead. But which bones meet at the top of the skull?

I think the parietal bones are on the sides and towards the back. So the coronal suture is where the frontal bone meets the two parietal bones. So it connects the frontal and parietal bones together. Let me go through the options.

Looking at the options:

Option F says frontal and parietal bones. That sounds right. What about the others?

Option B is left and right parietal. No, that's the sagittal suture, isn't it? Because the sagittal runs along the midline between the two parietal bones.

Option F is the one I was thinking of.

Wait, let me double-check. The coronal suture is between the frontal and parietal. So when you look at the skull from the top, the suture that goes across is the coronal. Sagittal is the midline one, lambdoid is the back one, and coronal is the front one.

So the correct answer must be F.

The coronal suture is located at the top of the skull and connects the frontal bone to the two parietal bones. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

F: frontal and parietal bones.

Answer: F
