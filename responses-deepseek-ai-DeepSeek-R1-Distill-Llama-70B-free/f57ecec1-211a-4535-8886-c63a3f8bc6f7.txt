Okay, so I have this question about VAR models, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is asking how many parameters need to be estimated for a standard form, unrestricted, tri-variate VAR(4) model, ignoring the intercepts.

Hmm, I remember that VAR stands for Vector Autoregressive model. It's used when you have multiple time series variables and you want to model how each variable affects the others. So a tri-variate VAR means there are three variables involved.

The model is of order 4, which I think means that each equation includes lags up to 4 periods back. And since it's unrestricted, that probably means all possible lags are included without any constraints.

Wait, I think each equation in the VAR corresponds to one of the variables. So for each variable, you have an equation where it's explained by its own past values (lags) and the past values of the other variables.

Right, so for a tri-variate model (let's say variables A, B, C), each variable's current value is a function of its own past four lags and the past four lags of the other two variables.

So, for each equation, how many parameters? Let's break it down. For variable A's equation, the right-hand side includes A's lags 1 to 4, B's lags 1 to 4, and C's lags 1 to 4. That's 4 (from A) + 4 (from B) + 4 (from C) = 12 parameters per equation. But wait, wait, no intercepts, so that's just the coefficients on the lags, right?

But each equation is for one variable. So if it's tri-variate, there are three equations in total. Each equation has 12 parameters. So 3 equations * 12 parameters each = 36 parameters in total.

Wait, but I should make sure. Another way to think: For a VAR(p) model with n variables, each equation has n*p coefficients. So here, n=3, p=4. So each equation has 3*4=12 coefficients. There are n equations, so 3*12=36. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option I is 36. So the answer should be I.

To determine the number of parameters to be estimated in a standard form, unrestricted, tri-variate VAR(4) model (ignoring intercepts), we analyze the structure of the model:

1. **Tri-variate VAR(4):** This means there are three variables (e.g., \( A, B, C \)) and the model includes lags up to 4 periods for each variable.

2. **Equation structure:** Each variable is modeled as a function of its own four lags and the four lags of the other two variables. For example:
   - The equation for \( A_t \) includes \( A_{t-1}, A_{t-2}, A_{t-3}, A_{t-4}, B_{t-1}, B_{t-2}, B_{t-3}, B_{t-4}, C_{t-1}, C_{t-2}, C_{t-3}, C_{t-4} \).
   - Similarly, the equations for \( B_t \) and \( C_t \) follow the same structure.

3. **Parameters per equation:** Each equation has \( 4 \) lags for the variable itself and \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) lags for the other two variables, totaling \( 4 + 8 = 12 \) parameters per equation.

4. **Total parameters:** Since there are three equations (one for each variable), the total number of parameters is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

Thus, the total number of parameters to be estimated is **36**.

The correct answer is **I: 36**.
