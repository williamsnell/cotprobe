Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about vitamins. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which vitamin is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. Hmm, I remember that vitamins can be fat-soluble or water-soluble, and some act as antioxidants. Antioxidants help prevent oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals.

First, I should probably list out the options given. The options are A through J, with each being a different vitamin. Let me go through each one and think about what I know about them.

Option A: Vitamin D. I know that Vitamin D is fat-soluble. It's important for bone health and immune function. But I'm not sure if it's known as an antioxidant. I think it's more about calcium absorption and bone density.

Option B: Vitamin B12. This is a water-soluble vitamin, part of the B complex. It's important for nerve function and DNA synthesis. Not an antioxidant, I believe.

Option C: Vitamin K. Also fat-soluble. It's mainly known for blood clotting. I don't think it's primarily an antioxidant.

Option D: Vitamin B3. That's Niacin, another B vitamin. Water-soluble, helps with energy metabolism. Not an antioxidant.

Option E: Vitamin A. Fat-soluble. I recall that Vitamin A has some antioxidant properties. It's also involved in vision and immune function. Beta-carotene, which converts to Vitamin A, is an antioxidant.

Option F: Vitamin B6. Another B vitamin, water-soluble. It's involved in many enzymatic reactions but not known as an antioxidant.

Option G: Vitamin E. Oh, right! Vitamin E is famous for being a fat-soluble antioxidant. It's often called the 'protective' vitamin because it protects cell membranes from oxidative damage. It stops the oxidation of lipids in cell membranes.

Option H: Vitamin B1. Thiamine, water-soluble. Important for energy production, not an antioxidant.

Option I: Vitamin F. Wait, I'm not sure if Vitamin F is a standard classification. Maybe it's a trick option. I think F might actually be a fatty acid, like linoleic acid, but I'm not certain. Or perhaps it's not a vitamin at all.

Option J: Vitamin C. This is water-soluble and a well-known antioxidant. It's found in aqueous environments like blood and cytoplasm, but the question specifically mentions lipid-soluble, so it's probably not the answer here.

So, putting it all together. The question asks for a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. Vitamin E (option G) is the one I remember as the major lipid-soluble antioxidant. Vitamin A is also lipid-soluble and has some antioxidant properties, but I think E is the primary one for cell membranes. Vitamin C is water-soluble, so it doesn't fit the lipid part.

Yeah, I'm pretty confident now that the answer is G, Vitamin E.

The question asks for a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. Among the options:

- **Vitamin D (A)** is fat-soluble but primarily involved in bone health and calcium absorption, not known as an antioxidant.
- **Vitamin B12 (B)** is water-soluble and involved in nerve function and DNA synthesis, not an antioxidant.
- **Vitamin K (C)** is fat-soluble but mainly known for blood clotting, not antioxidant activity.
- **Vitamin B3 (D)** is water-soluble and involved in energy metabolism, not an antioxidant.
- **Vitamin A (E)** is fat-soluble and has some antioxidant properties, but it is not the primary lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes.
- **Vitamin B6 (F)** is water-soluble and involved in enzymatic reactions, not an antioxidant.
- **Vitamin E (G)** is fat-soluble and well-known as a major lipid-soluble antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage.
- **Vitamin B1 (H)** is water-soluble and involved in energy production, not an antioxidant.
- **Vitamin F (I)** is not a standard vitamin and may refer to fatty acids, not relevant here.
- **Vitamin C (J)** is water-soluble and an antioxidant but not lipid-soluble.

Vitamin E (G) is the correct answer as it is specifically recognized for its role as a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes.

Answer: G
