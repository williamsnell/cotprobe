Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a psychotherapist and a past relationship. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Dr. Ryan is a psychotherapist in a small town. She gets a call from a man she was sexually involved with several years ago. Their relationship lasted three months and ended amicably. Now, the man is married and having problems unrelated to their past. He wants to start therapy with her. The question is, what should Dr. Ryan do?

The options are A through J. I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I remember that ethical guidelines for psychotherapists usually address dual relationships and past relationships. The main concern is whether the past relationship could interfere with the therapeutic relationship, creating a conflict of interest or affecting the therapist's objectivity.

In this case, the relationship was sexual and ended several years ago amicably. The man is now married, but his current problems are unrelated to the past. So, the issue is whether it's appropriate for Dr. Ryan to take him on as a client.

Looking at the options:

Option A: See the man but disclose the past relationship to a supervisor or colleague. That sounds like transparency, but does it solve the potential conflict?

Option B: Deny without a reason. That might be an option if the therapist feels she can't be objective, but is it the best choice?

Option C: See him only if their relationship ended more than two years ago and she thinks it won't interfere with objectivity. Time since the relationship ended is a factor, but is two years a standard?

Option D: See him only if she can maintain professional boundaries. That sounds reasonable, but it's a bit vague.

Option E: Refer him to a colleague. That could be a safe choice to avoid any potential conflict.

Option F: Continue therapy but avoid discussing the past. That might not be helpful because the past could influence the therapy, and avoiding it might lead to issues.

Option G: See him if she determines the past won't interfere. That's similar to C and D but without the time frame.

Option H: Therapy over the phone or online. I'm not sure if that's necessary or helpful here.

Option I: Only if his wife knows and consents. That seems like an invasion of the man's privacy, especially if the issues are unrelated. Also, the wife's consent isn't required for therapy, I think.

Option J: See him but discuss potential conflicts first. That involves informed consent and transparency with the client.

Now, considering ethical standards, the key points are whether the past sexual relationship poses a risk to the therapeutic relationship. Many codes of ethics advise against engaging in therapy with former sexual partners because it can create a dual relationship, even if it's in the past. However, sometimes it's allowed if enough time has passed and the therapist can maintain objectivity.

Option C says only if it's been more than two years. I'm not sure if two years is a specific guideline or just a general idea. I think the exact time might vary, but the main point is the therapist's judgment about their objectivity.

Option G is about her determining it won't interfere. Option J is about discussing it with the client.

But wait, another angle: some ethical guidelines say that a therapist shouldn't engage in any form of therapy with someone they've had a sexual relationship with, regardless of when. But I think that's for current relationships; past ones might be considered on a case-by-case basis.

So, in this scenario, since the relationship ended amicably and was several years ago, Dr. Ryan might consider taking him on. However, she needs to be cautious about her objectivity and the potential for any unresolved feelings or bias.

Which option aligns with that? Option G says she can see him if she determines it won't interfere. Option A is about transparency with a colleague, which is good but doesn't directly address whether she should take him on.

Option E suggests referring him elsewhere. That might be the safest option to avoid any possible conflict or appearance of impropriety. However, if she feels capable of maintaining professional boundaries, maybe she can proceed, but it's a tricky situation.

Another thought: some codes might require that if a therapist has had a past sexual relationship with the client, they shouldn't provide therapy. So in that case, the correct action would be to refer him to another therapist.

Wait, but the man is seeking help now, and maybe Dr. Ryan is the only therapist in the small town. But that's not indicated here. The question doesn't say she's the only option.

So, considering the potential for a dual relationship and the ethical implications, the best course of action might be to refer him to another colleague to avoid any risk of bias or conflict.

Looking back at the options, option E is to refer him to a colleague. That seems like the safest choice ethically to prevent any possible issues.

Alternatively, option G says she can see him if she determines it won't interfere with her objectivity. But if she's unsure, it's better to refer.

Wait, but in some cases, if the past relationship is not recent and she can maintain boundaries, it might be acceptable. So perhaps option G is correct.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about what Dr. Ryan should do. The options are about whether she should see him under certain conditions or refer.

In the APA Ethics Code, Standard 3.06 says that a psychologist should refrain from taking on a person with whom they've had a sexual relationship if it could impair objectivity or cause harm. So, if Dr. Ryan thinks she can be objective, maybe she can proceed, but if not, she should refer.

So, the correct answer might be option G: see him only if she determines that the past relationship won't interfere with her objectivity.

Wait, but another point: even if she thinks her objectivity won't be affected, the fact that they had a sexual relationship in the past could still create a dual relationship issue. So, perhaps the safest choice is to refer him, so option E.

Hmm, I'm going back and forth. I think the key is whether the past relationship poses a risk. If she can handle it without issues, she might proceed, but if not, she should refer.

Looking at the options again, option E is to refer, which is a safe choice. Option G is about her determining it's okay. But since the relationship was sexual, even if it's in the past, it's generally advised against, so she should refer.

Wait, but the question says the relationship ended amicably and was several years ago. Maybe enough time has passed, and she can maintain objectivity.

I think option G is more about her professional judgment. So if she feels she can be objective, she can see him. Otherwise, she should refer.

But the question is what should she do. So, the correct approach would be to assess whether her objectivity is intact. If yes, she can proceed, but if not, refer.

So, the answer would be option G: see the man only if she determines that their past relationship will not interfere with her objectivity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about what's more ethically appropriate. I think the correct answer is E, to refer, because having a past sexual relationship can create a dual relationship that's best avoided, even if it's in the past. So, to prevent any potential conflict, she should refer him to another therapist.

Alternatively, some might argue that if the relationship was consensual, ended a long time ago, and she can maintain boundaries, it's acceptable. So, that would point to option G.

I'm a bit torn. But I think the safer and more ethical choice is to refer him, so option E.

Wait, but looking back, option G is phrased as "see the man only if she determines that their past relationship will not interfere with her objectivity." So, if she believes she can handle it, she can take him on. Otherwise, she shouldn't.

So, perhaps the correct answer is G because it allows her to make a professional judgment about her own objectivity.

But I'm still not entirely certain. Another approach is to recall that the NASW Code of Ethics (in the US) states that social workers should not engage in sexual activities with clients, but past relationships may be considered. However, it's generally cautioned against due to potential dual relationships.

In summary, I think the correct answer is E: refer the man to a colleague. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, option G might be correct if she can maintain objectivity.

Wait, but the question is about what Dr. Ryan should do. If she can maintain objectivity, she can see him, but if not, she shouldn't. So, the correct approach is to assess her own ability. So, option G is saying she can see him if she determines no interference with objectivity.

I think the correct answer is G.

Dr. Ryan is a psychotherapist who receives a call from a man with whom she had a sexual relationship several years ago. The relationship ended amicably, and the man is now married with unrelated problems. He seeks therapy with her. The ethical dilemma revolves around whether Dr. Ryan can maintain professional boundaries and objectivity, given their past relationship.

Key considerations include ethical guidelines about dual relationships and past sexual relationships. While some codes of ethics caution against engaging in therapy with former sexual partners due to potential conflicts of interest, others allow it if the therapist can maintain objectivity and professional boundaries. The question hinges on whether Dr. Ryan can assess her ability to remain objective without being influenced by their past relationship.

Option G states that Dr. Ryan can see the man if she determines that their past relationship will not interfere with her objectivity. This aligns with ethical standards that permit therapy in such cases, provided the therapist can maintain professionalism and avoid harm to the client. While referring the man to a colleague (Option E) is a safe choice, Option G allows Dr. Ryan to exercise professional judgment about her ability to handle the situation ethically.

Given the scenario, the most appropriate answer is:

G

Answer: G
