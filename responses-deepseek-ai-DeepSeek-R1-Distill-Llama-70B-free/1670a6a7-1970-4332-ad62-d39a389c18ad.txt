Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an astronaut's orbital speed. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on orbital mechanics, but I remember some formulas from my high school days.

The question says the astronaut is in a circular orbit at a distance of 1.6 × 10^5 meters above Earth's surface. Earth's radius is given as 6.37 × 10^6 meters, and its mass is 5.98 × 10^24 kg. We need to find the orbital speed.

Wait, right. The formula for orbital speed, I think, is derived from the balance between gravitational force and centripetal force. So the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force to keep the satellite in orbit.

The formula I remember is v = sqrt(G*M/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the radius of the orbit. Oh wait, but wait, what's r here? The distance from the center of the Earth, right. So if the satellite is orbiting 1.6e5 meters above Earth's surface, I need to add that to Earth's radius to get r.

So, Earth's radius is 6.37e6 m, and the altitude is 1.6e5 m. Let me add them: 6.37e6 + 0.16e6 = 6.53e6 meters. So r is 6.53 × 10^6 m.

Then, G is the gravitational constant. I think it's approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². Yeah, that sounds right.

So plugging into the formula: v = sqrt( (G*M) / r )

Let me compute G*M first. G is 6.674e-11, M is 5.98e24 kg. Multiplying those gives... let's see.

6.674e-11 * 5.98e24 = let's compute the exponents first. 1e-11 * 1e24 is 1e13. So 6.674 *5.98 is about... 6 *6 is 36, but 6.674 is about 6.67, and 5.98 is about 6. So 6.67 *6 is around 40.02. But more accurately, 6.674 *5.98. Let me compute that:

6.674 * 5.98 = (let me think) 6 *5=30, 6*.98=5.88, .674*5=3.37, .674*.98≈0.66. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 6.674 *6 = 40.044, but since it's 5.98 (which is 6 - 0.02), subtract 6.674 *0.02. So 40.044 - (0.13348) = 39.91052. So approximately 39.91, so 39.91e13. Wait, no: 6.674e-11 *5.98e24 = (6.674 *5.98) * 1e13. So 6.674 *5.98 is about 39.91, so 39.91e13 m^3/s².

Wait, no. Wait G*M has units of m³/s², right? Because G is m³/(kg·s²), multiplied by kg (M) gives m³/s².

So G*M is approximately 39.91e13 m³/s². Wait, but 39.91e13 is 3.991e14. Wait, no, 39.91e13 is 3.991e14? Let me check: 39.91e13 is the same as 3.991 *10^1 *1e13 = 3.991e14. Yeah.

So, G*M = 6.674e-11 *5.98e24 = ?

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication.

6.674e-11 *5.98e24 = (6.674 *5.98) * 1e(-11+24) = (approx 40) *1e13 = 40e13. But exact calculation earlier gave 39.91e13, so approximately 3.991e14.

Wait, 6.674 *5.98: 6 *5=30, 6 *0.98=5.88, 0.674*5=3.37, 0.674 *0.98≈0.66172.

Wait, no, that's breaking it down wrong. Alternatively, 6.674 *5.98 = ?

Let me compute 6.674 *5.98:

6.674 ×5 = 33.37.

6.674 ×0.98 = ?

Wait, 6.674 ×1 is 6.674, minus 6.674 ×0.02. 0.02*6.674=0.13348, so 6.674 - 0.13348=6.54052.

So 33.37 +6.54052=39.91052. So yeah, about 39.9105.

So G*M ≈ 39.91e13 m³/s².

Now, the denominator is r, which is 6.53e6 m. So (G*M)/r is 39.91e13 /6.53e6.

Let me compute that.

39.91e13 /6.53e6 = (39.91 /6.53) * 1e7.

Because 1e13 /1e6 is 1e7.

39.91 divided by 6.53. Let's calculate that. 6.53 ×6=39.18. So 6.53×6 =39.18. 39.91-39.18=0.73. So 6.53 ×0.11 is about 0.7183. So 6.53 ×6.11 is approximately 39.91. So 6.11 approximately.

So (39.91 /6.53) ≈6.11. So (G*M)/r ≈6.11e7 m²/s².

Wait wait, no, wait: (G*M) is m³/s², r is meters. So (G*M)/r is (m³/s²) / m = m²/s². So correct.

So now, v is the square root of that. So sqrt(6.11e7) m/s.

What's the square root of 6.11e7? Let me compute that.

6.11e7 is 61,100,000.

The square root of 61,100,000. Well, sqrt(6.11e7) = sqrt(6.11)*1e3.5. Wait, 1e7 is (1e3.5)^2. So sqrt(6.11e7) = sqrt(6.11)*1e3.5.

Wait, 1e3.5 is 1e3 * sqrt(10) ≈ 1000 *3.162 ≈3162.

So sqrt(6.11) is about 2.473.

So 2.473 * 3162 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 2 *3162=6324, 0.473 *3162.

0.4 *3162=1264.8, 0.07 *3162≈221.34, 0.003 *3162≈9.486. So 1264.8 +221.34=1486.14, +9.486=1495.626. So total is 6324 +1495.626≈7819.626 m/s.

Wait, that's about 7.82e3 m/s. Hmm, but let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach.

Let me compute 6.11e7 = 61,100,000.

sqrt(61,100,000) = ?

Well, 7000^2 =49,000,000.

7800^2=60,840,000.

So 7800²=60,840,000.

61,100,000 is 260,000 higher.

So 7800^2=60,840,000.

7800+x)^2=61,100,000.

(7800 +x)^2 =7800² + 2*7800*x +x². Since x is small, x² is negligible.

So 60,840,000 + 15,600 x ≈61,100,000.

So 15,600 x ≈260,000 → x≈260,000 /15,600 ≈16.666...

So x≈16.666. So 7800 +16.666=7816.666 m/s.

Approximately 7816.67 m/s, which is 7.81667e3 m/s.

Looking back at the options:

Options are:

A:8.01e3

B:6.01e3

C:9.01e3

D:7.91e3

E:7.51e3

F:5.91e3

G:8.91e3

H:8.41e3

I:7.01e3

J:6.91e3

So, my calculation is about 7.817e3. The closest option is D:7.91e3, but wait, my calculation is around 7.81, which is closer to 7.8. Looking at the options, option D is 7.91, which is 7.91. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me double-check the steps. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating G*M or r.

Wait, G is 6.674e-11, M is 5.98e24.

So 6.674e-11 *5.98e24 = let's compute this more accurately.

6.674 *5.98: let's do exact multiplication.

6.674 *5.98:

Multiply 6.674 by 5, which is 33.37.

Multiply 6.674 by 0.98: Let me compute 6.674 *0.98.

6.674 *0.98 = (6.674 *1) - (6.674 *0.02) =6.674 -0.13348=6.54052.

So 33.37 +6.54052 =39.91052.

So G*M=39.91052e13 = 3.991052e14 m³/s².

r is 6.53e6 m.

So (G*M)/r = 3.991052e14 / 6.53e6 = (3.991052 /6.53) *1e8.

Wait, 3.991e14 /6.53e6 = (3.991e14 ) / (6.53e6 ) = (3.991/6.53) *1e8.

3.991 /6.53 is approximately 0.6115.

So 0.6115 *1e8 =6.115e7 m²/s².

So v=sqrt(6.115e7) = sqrt(6.115e7) = sqrt(6.115)*1e3.5.

Wait, sqrt(6.115) is approx 2.473, as before.

1e3.5 is 1e3 * sqrt(10) = 1000 *3.1623=3162.3.

So 2.473 *3162.3= Let me compute that more accurately.

2.473 *3000=7419.

2.473 *162.3= ?

Compute 2*162.3=324.6.

0.473*162.3: 0.4*162.3=64.92, 0.07*162.3=11.361, 0.003*162.3≈0.4869.

So 64.92 +11.361=76.281 +0.4869≈76.7679.

So 0.473*162.3≈76.7679.

So 324.6 +76.7679≈401.3679.

So total is 7419 +401.3679=7820.3679 m/s.

Approximately 7820 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is D:7.91e3 (7910), but our value is 7820, which is 7.82e3. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match, but perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check r again. The astronaut is 1.6e5 m above Earth's surface, and Earth's radius is 6.37e6 m. So r=6.37e6 +1.6e5 =6.37e6 +0.16e6=6.53e6 m. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values. Let me compute G*M more precisely.

G=6.67430e-11 N·m²/kg², M=5.972e24 kg. So G*M =6.6743e-11 *5.972e24.

Let me compute 6.6743 *5.972.

6 *5 =30.

6 *0.972=5.832.

0.6743 *5=3.3715.

0.6743 *0.972= approx 0.655.

Adding all:

30 +5.832=35.832.

35.832 +3.3715=39.2035.

39.2035 +0.655≈39.8585.

So G*M=39.8585e13 m³/s².

So r=6.53e6 m.

(G*M)/r=39.8585e13 /6.53e6 = (39.8585 /6.53 )e7.

39.8585 /6.53: Let's compute this division.

6.53 ×6=39.18.

39.8585 -39.18=0.6785.

So 6 + (0.6785 /6.53) =6 + approx 0.1039.

So 6.1039.

So (G*M)/r ≈6.1039e7 m²/s².

So v=sqrt(6.1039e7) =sqrt(6.1039e7) m/s.

Compute sqrt(6.1039e7):

sqrt(61,039,000). Let me think, 7,800^2=60,840,000. 7,820^2= (7,800+20)^2=7,800² + 2*7,800*20 +20²=60,840,000 +312,000 +400=61,152,400.

Wait, 7,820^2=61,152,400. Which is larger than 61,039,000.

So 7,820^2=61,152,400.

So 61,039,000 is 61,152,400 minus 113,400.

So the square root is a little less than 7,820, perhaps 7,817?

Let me compute 7817^2:

(7800 +17)^2=7800^2 +2*7800*17 +17^2=60,840,000 + 264,600 +289=61,104,889.

Still higher than 61,039,000.

Wait, 61,039,000 is 61,039,000. 7800²=60,840,000.

61,039,000-60,840,000=199,000.

So 7800+x squared is 60,840,000 +2*7800*x +x²=61,039,000.

So 199,000 ≈ 2*7800*x → x≈199,000/(2*7800)=199000/15600≈12.75.

So x≈12.75.

So v≈7800 +12.75=7812.75 m/s.

Wait, but 7812.75^2 is 7800^2 + 2*7800*12.75 +12.75^2=60,840,000 + 199,  200 + 162.5625=60,840,000 +199,200=61,039,200 +162.56=61,039,362.56.

But our (G*M)/r is 6.1039e7 =61,039,000. So 61,039,000 is less than 7812.75^2=61,039,362.56. So the square root is a bit less than 7812.75.

So v≈7812 m/s.

Hmm, but looking back, the options are up to 8e3. So 7.8e3 is 7800, but the options don't have exactly that, but option D is 7.91e3, which is higher. Option E is 7.51e3, which is lower.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, maybe the formula I used is correct, but perhaps I should use another approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the formula v = sqrt( (G*M) / r ). But maybe another formula is more accurate, like using the period and circumference, but I think that comes down to the same thing.

Alternatively, I recall that the orbital speed can also be calculated using v = sqrt( (μ)/r ), where μ is the standard gravitational parameter, which is G*M for Earth. And μ for Earth is known as approximately 3.986e14 m³/s².

Wait, wait! Because when I calculated G*M earlier, I got around 3.99e14, which is close to the standard value of μ=3.986004e14. So perhaps using that exact value would make the calculation more precise.

So let me try that. So using μ=3.986004e14 m³/s².

So v = sqrt(μ / r )= sqrt(3.986004e14 /6.53e6 )= sqrt( (3.986004e14 )/(6.53e6) )

Compute that division: 3.986004e14 /6.53e6 = (3.986004 /6.53 )e8.

3.986004 /6.53 ≈0.610.

So 0.610e8 =6.1e7. So sqrt(6.1e7)= approx 7810 m/s, same as before.

So that's about 7.81e3 m/s.

Looking again at the options, the closest is
