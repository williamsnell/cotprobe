Question:

A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been "squatters" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?

Options:

A: Call her previous physician to obtain more history
B: Order a chest x-ray
C: Order a test for HIV antibody
D: Repeat the PPD skin test

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a 3-year-old girl who had a PPD skin test. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the PPD test is for tuberculosis, right? So the girl was tested as part of a routine screening for a homeless shelter. They came back 48 hours later, which is the usual time to check the results. The test showed 10 mm of induration. Wait, what's considered positive? I remember that for most people, 10 mm is positive, but it can vary based on risk factors. Like, if you're immunocompromised, maybe a smaller induration is considered positive. But she's a kid, and unless she has some immune issue, 10 mm is a positive result.

The parents are shocked because their tests were nonreactive. They were born in the country, so maybe lower risk for TB? But the daughter has been in squatter buildings, which might have higher exposure risks. She hasn't had much medical care, so maybe she wasn't vaccinated with BCG? Wait, BCG is used in some countries to prevent TB, but if she was born here, they might not have given it. So a positive PPD in a healthy kid without BCG would likely indicate TB infection.

So, the question is, what's the next step. The options are A to D. The options are:

A: Call her previous physician for more history. Hmm, maybe, but she hasn't had much medical care, so maybe not much info there.

B: Order a chest x-ray. That makes sense because if she has TB, whether active or latent, a chest x-ray can show signs like lymphadenopathy or infiltrates.

C: Order an HIV test. Wait, why? Well, if she's HIV positive, that's a risk factor for TB. But she's asymptomatic, so maybe that's not the first step. Unless her immune status is in question, but the parents are healthy and their tests are negative.

D: Repeat the PPD. Sometimes false positives happen, especially if the test was placed wrong or if she's had a BCG vaccination. But she's in a high-risk environment, so maybe it's real. But repeating could help confirm. However, if the test was done correctly, repeating it might not be necessary, especially if the result is 10mm which is a clear positive.

So considering her age and the result, the next step after a positive PPD is usually a chest x-ray to check for active disease. Active TB would require treatment, whereas latent TB would be treated differently. So option B seems appropriate.

Wait, but what about the possibility of a false positive? Could 10mm be a false positive? I think it's less likely in a child of this age, especially without any history of BCG. So probably, it's a true positive. The next step is to evaluate for active TB, which starts with a chest x-ray.

Therefore, the most appropriate step is to order a chest x-ray, which is option B.

The 3-year-old girl had a positive PPD skin test with 10 mm of induration, indicating potential tuberculosis (TB) infection. The next step is to assess for active TB, as the chest x-ray can reveal signs such as lymphadenopathy or pulmonary infiltrates. While repeating the PPD (option D) could confirm the result, a 10 mm induration is typically a clear positive, especially in a high-risk environment. Ordering an HIV test (option C) is less immediately relevant unless there are specific concerns about her immune status. Contacting her previous physician (option A) may not yield significant information given her limited medical history. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to order a chest x-ray (option B) to evaluate for active TB.
