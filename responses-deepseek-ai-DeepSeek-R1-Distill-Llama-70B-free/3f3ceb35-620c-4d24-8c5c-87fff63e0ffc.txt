Okay, so I've got this problem about a capacitor with a nonlinear characteristic, and I need to find the current through it. Hmm, okay, let me think. I remember that in circuit theory, the current through a capacitor is related to the change in charge over time. Oh right, the formula is i(t) = dq(t)/dt. Wait, but wait, the problem gives me a nonlinear q(t), so I can't use the standard linear capacitor formula where i = C dν/dt. Right, because this one's q depends on ν squared or something.

So the given q(t) is 0.5 ν squared. Oh wait, actually, the problem says q(t) = 0.5 ν²(t). So q is a function of ν squared. And the voltage across the capacitor is given as ν(t) = 1 + 0.5 sin t. So I need to find i(t) which is the derivative of q with respect to time.

Wait, no. Wait, i(t) is dq(t)/dt. So I have to take the derivative of q(t) with respect to time. But q is given in terms of ν(t), so I'll need to use the chain rule here. Let me write this down.

q(t) = 0.5 [ν(t)]². So dq/dt = 0.5 * 2 ν(t) * dν/dt. Because the derivative of ν squared is 2ν times dν/dt, right? So that simplifies to dq/dt = ν(t) * dν/dt.

Wait a second, that means i(t) = ν(t) * dν/dt. Because i is dq/dt. So yes, that's the expression I need to compute.

Now, what's ν(t)? It's given as 1 + 0.5 sin t. So first, I need to find dν/dt. Let's compute that. The derivative of 1 is zero, and the derivative of 0.5 sin t is 0.5 cos t. So dν/dt = 0.5 cos t.

So putting that back into i(t), which is ν(t) * dν/dt, we get i(t) = (1 + 0.5 sin t) * 0.5 cos t.

Let me expand this multiplication. Multiplying each term inside the parenthesis by 0.5 cos t.

First term: 1 * 0.5 cos t = 0.5 cos t.

Second term: 0.5 sin t * 0.5 cos t = 0.25 sin t cos t. Wait, but I remember that sin t cos t is equal to (sin 2t)/2. So 0.25 sin t cos t becomes 0.25 * (sin 2t)/2) = 0.125 sin 2t.

So putting it all together, i(t) = 0.5 cos t + 0.125 sin 2t.

Now let me look at the options provided. Option A is i(t) = 0.5 cos t + 0.25 sin 2t, which doesn't match because the second term is 0.25 instead of 0.125. Option B has cos 2t which I don't have. Option C has cos 2t as well. Option D has sin and cos 2t but coefficients don't match. Option E has 1.0 cos t which is higher than my 0.5. Option F has 0.5 cos t and 0.125 sin t, but I have sin 2t, not sin t. Option G: 0.5 cos t and 0.125 sin 2t. Yes, that's exactly what I have. So option G should be correct.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. Let me go through the steps again.

q(t) = 0.5 ν². Then dq/dt = 0.5 * 2 ν * dν/dt = ν dν/dt. That's correct. ν is 1 + 0.5 sin t. dν/dt is 0.5 cos t. So i(t) = (1 + 0.5 sin t)(0.5 cos t).

Expanding: 1 * 0.5 cos t is 0.5 cos t. 0.5 sin t * 0.5 cos t is 0.25 sin t cos t. And 0.25 sin t cos t is 0.125 sin 2t, because sin 2t = 2 sin t cos t. So yes, 0.25 sin t cos t is 0.125 sin 2t.

So i(t) = 0.5 cos t + 0.125 sin 2t. Which matches option G. So the correct answer should be G.

To find the current through the capacitor, we start with the relationship \( i(t) = \frac{dq(t)}{dt} \). The charge \( q(t) \) is given as \( q(t) = 0.5 \nu^2(t) \), and the voltage across the capacitor is \( \nu(t) = 1 + 0.5 \sin t \). Using the chain rule, we compute:

\[
\frac{dq(t)}{dt} = 0.5 \cdot 2 \nu(t) \cdot \frac{d\nu(t)}{dt} = \nu(t) \cdot \frac{d\nu(t)}{dt}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( \frac{d\nu(t)}{dt} \). Since \( \nu(t) = 1 + 0.5 \sin t \), its derivative is:

\[
\frac{d\nu(t)}{dt} = 0 + 0.5 \cos t = 0.5 \cos t.
\]

Substituting \( \nu(t) \) and \( \frac{d\nu(t)}{dt} \) into the expression for \( i(t) \), we get:

\[
i(t) = \nu(t) \cdot \frac{d\nu(t)}{dt} = (1 + 0.5 \sin t) \cdot 0.5 \cos t.
\]

Expanding this:

\[
i(t) = 1 \cdot 0.5 \cos t + 0.5 \sin t \cdot 0.5 \cos t = 0.5 \cos t + 0.25 \sin t \cos t.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \sin t \cos t = \frac{\sin 2t}{2} \), the second term becomes:

\[
0.25 \sin t \cos t = 0.25 \cdot \frac{\sin 2t}{2} = 0.125 \sin 2t.
\]

Thus, the current is:

\[
i(t) = 0.5 \cos t + 0.125 \sin 2t.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct match is:

**G: \( i(t) = 0.5 \cos t + 0.125 \sin 2t \).**
