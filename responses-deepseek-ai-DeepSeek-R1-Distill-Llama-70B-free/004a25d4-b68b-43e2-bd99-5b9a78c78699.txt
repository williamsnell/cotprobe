Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Under the name of Chartist well-meaning inconsiderate men and other misled men have in very many cases, all over the country from the extreme west to the extreme east and from Brighton in the south to nearly the extreme north of Scotland, denounced every man who is not a working man, applied to him, the grossest epithets and most atrocious intentions and conduct, have threatened them with vengeance and in some places, have proposed plans for the seizure and division of their property—numbers of misled men and others of bad character, under the self-denomination of Chartists have gone from place to place and in the most violent manner disturbed and dispersed meetings of various kinds. Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words—they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms—and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.

Okay, so I have this question about the Chartist movement, and I need to figure out the primary goal. The question gives an excerpt from a letter by Francis Place written in 1842. Hmm, I remember that the Chartist movement was a big part of British history, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me read the excerpt again. It talks about Chartists denouncing men who aren't working men, using harsh words, threatening vengeance, and planning to seize property. They've been disrupting meetings violently too. The committee in the letter objects to "Household Suffrage" because it would exclude a large majority of men and has become obnoxious to the political working class.

Wait, so Household Suffrage probably refers to giving voting rights only to heads of households, which would mean a lot of men, especially the working class, wouldn't qualify. The Chartists are against that, so they must want something more inclusive.

I think the Chartists were pushing for voting reform. I remember something about the People's Charter, which had several points. Let me recall: I think it included things like universal male suffrage, secret ballots, ending property requirements for voting, equal electoral districts, and paying members of parliament so that working-class people could afford to serve.

So the main goal would be to get voting rights for all men, not just property-owners. That would be universal male suffrage. Looking at the options, option C is Universal male suffrage. Option D is Universal suffrage, which would include women too, but I don't think Chartists were focusing on women's suffrage back then. Their main push was for men.

Other options like equal distribution of wealth (B) or universal health care (E) don't seem right because those weren't the primary goals of the Chartist movement. They were more focused on political reform rather than social or economic policies beyond voting rights.

So putting it all together, the primary goal was universal male suffrage, which is option C.

The Chartist movement primarily aimed to achieve universal male suffrage, as outlined in the People's Charter, which sought to expand voting rights beyond property-owners to all men. This goal is reflected in their opposition to Household Suffrage, which excluded many working-class men. Other options like universal suffrage or economic reforms were not their main focus.

Answer: C
