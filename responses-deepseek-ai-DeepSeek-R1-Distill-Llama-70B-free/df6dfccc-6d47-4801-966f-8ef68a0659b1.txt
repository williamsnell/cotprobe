Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields between two charged plates. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when you have charged plates, the electric field they produce depends on their charge and other factors. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says we have two infinite parallel metal plates with equal surface charge density and the same polarity. I'm trying to find the electric field in the gap between them. The options are from A to J, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I recall that for a single infinite charged plate, the electric field it produces is σ/(2ε₀), right? Because each plate creates a field on both sides, so the field from one plate is σ/(2ε₀) away from the plate. But what happens when there are two plates?

Since the plates are of the same polarity and parallel, their fields in the region between them should add up. Let me visualize this. Each plate creates its own field. The plate on the left has a positive charge, so its field points away from it. The plate on the right is also positive, so its field points away too.

In the region between them, the field from the left plate points to the right, and the field from the right plate also points to the right. So the two fields add up. Each contributes σ/(2ε₀), so together it's σ/(ε₀). So the total field in between is twice that of one plate.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Oh right, for an infinite sheet, the field is σ/(2ε₀) on each side. So when two such sheets are placed facing each other with same polarity, the fields in the gap between them add. So each contributes σ/(2ε₀), so total is σ/ε₀. So that's double the field of one plate, which is σ/(2ε₀)*2 = σ/ε₀. So the field is double, which would mean the field is twice as strong as each individual plate's contribution.

Looking back at the options, option G says "double the field produced by one plate." That would be correct, because each plate gives σ/(2ε₀), so together it's twice that. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Wait, each plate creates a field of σ/(2ε₀) in the region outside. So between the plates, each contributes σ/(2ε₀) in the same direction. So adding them gives σ/ε₀. So the field in the gap is twice the field from one plate (since each contributes half, so together 1x, which is double of 0.5x? Wait, maybe I should rephrase.

Alternatively, maybe each plate's field in the region between is σ/(2ε₀). So two plates' fields would add up, making the total field in the gap equal to σ/(ε₀), which is twice the field of one plate (since one plate gives σ/(2ε₀), so two give twice that). So yes, option G makes sense.

Wait, what's the alternative? If the plates were oppositely charged, the fields would point in the same direction in the gap between them. But in this case, same polarity, so both fields point away from each plate. So between them, they both point in the same direction, adding up.

So the correct answer should be G: double the field produced by one plate.

Looking at the options: option G is "double the field produced by one plate." So that's the right choice.

The problem involves two infinite parallel metal plates with equal surface charge density of the same polarity. The goal is to determine the electric field in the gap between the plates. 

For a single infinite charged plate, the electric field it produces is given by \( E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} \), where \( \sigma \) is the surface charge density and \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space. When two such plates are placed parallel to each other with the same polarity, their electric fields in the region between the plates add up.

Each plate contributes a field of \( \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} \) in the gap, and since the fields point in the same direction (away from each plate due to the same polarity), the total field in the gap is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} + \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}.
\]

This total field is twice the field produced by one plate, as the field from one plate alone is \( \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} \). Therefore, the electric field in the gap between the plates is double the field produced by a single plate.

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**G: double the field produced by one plate.**
