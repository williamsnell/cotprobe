Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about a population of garden peas that's in genetic equilibrium. The gene frequencies are given: F (full pods) is 0.6 and f (constricted pods) is 0.4. The population is allowed to reproduce only by self-fertilization for three generations. I need to find the distribution of the three genotypes (FF, Ff, ff) after the third generation.

Hmm, I remember that self-fertilization changes genotype frequencies over generations, especially when the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Wait, but initially, the population is in genetic equilibrium, so it must be following Hardy-Weinberg. Oh wait, no, wait—Hardy-Weinberg applies when certain conditions are met, like no selection, mutation, migration, etc. But here, the population is undergoing selfing, which changes the genotype frequencies each generation.

So the initial genotype frequencies under H-W would be p² + 2pq + q², where p is 0.6 and q is 0.4. Let me calculate that first.

p = 0.6 → p² = 0.36 (FF)
2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48 (Ff)
q² = 0.16 (ff)

So initially, the population has 36% FF, 48% Ff, and 16% ff.

But now, they're reproducing by self-fertilization for three generations. I remember that selfing increases the frequency of homozygotes each generation. Specifically, each generation of selfing reduces the heterozygotes by half and increases homozygotes proportionally.

Wait, let me think. When a plant self-fertilizes, the possible genotypes of the offspring depend on the parent's genotype. For a heterozygote (Ff), selfing will produce FF, Ff, and ff in certain ratios. Let me get that right.

For an Ff individual, selfing would produce:

FF (25%), Ff (50%), and ff (25%). Because each gamete has a 50% chance of F or f, so F x F is FF (25%), F x f is Ff (50%, but since there's two possibilities Ff and fF, maybe it's 50% combined), and f x f is ff (25%).

Wait, no, when Ff selfs, the possible offspring are:

Each parent gamete can be F or f. So the Punnett square for Ff x Ff gives:

FF (25%), Ff (50%), ff (25%). So yes, that's correct.

So in each generation, when selfing occurs, the Ff plants will produce 25% FF, 50% Ff, and 25% ff. But wait, the overall population will have some FF, some Ff, and some ff. So each generation, the proportion of each genotype changes based on their selfing.

Wait, but selfing doesn't affect FF and ff plants. Because FF selfed will only produce FF offspring, and ff selfed will only produce ff.

So the process is: each generation, the frequency of Ff will decrease by half each time, and the homozygotes will increase.

Wait, let me model this. Let's define the genotype frequencies in each generation.

Let's denote G0 as the initial generation, G1 after first selfing, G2 after second, and G3 after third.

In G0:
FF = 0.36
Ff = 0.48
ff = 0.16

After selfing, each Ff individual will produce 25% FF, 50% Ff, 25% ff. But FF and ff individuals will produce only themselves.

So the next generation (G1) can be calculated as:

FF in G1 = (FF in G0)*1 (since all FF self to FF) + (Ff in G0)*(0.25) (since each Ff contributes 25% FF)
Similarly, Ff in G1 = (FF in G0)*0 + (Ff in G0)*0.5 + (ff in G0)*0
And ff in G1 = (FF in G0)*0 + (Ff in G0)*0.25 + (ff in G0)*1

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each genotype in the current generation contributes to the next generation. So perhaps I should model it properly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to track how each genotype's frequency changes when the population undergoes selfing.

Each Ff individual will produce 25% FF, 50% Ff, 25% ff. So the proportion of Ff in the next generation will be (current Ff) * 0.5, because each Ff individual is contributing 50% Ff offspring. But wait, also, the FF and ff in the next generation will have contributions from Ff as well.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to model the allele frequencies and use the fact that with selfing, the heterozygotes decrease each generation.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the genotype frequencies after each selfing event.

After one generation of selfing, the changes are as follows:

- All FF individuals produce FF, so their contribution remains the same.
- All ff individuals produce ff, so their contribution remains the same.
- Each Ff individual produces 25% FF, 50% Ff, and 25% ff. So the Ff frequency in the next generation will be (0.48) * (0.5) = 0.24.

Wait, no, because the Ff individuals produce 50% Ff, 25% FF, and 25% ff. So the new frequencies would be:

FF_new = FF_old + (Ff_old * 0.25)
Ff_new = Ff_old * 0.5
ff_new = ff_old + (Ff_old * 0.25)

So let's compute that for each generation.

G0: FF=0.36, Ff=0.48, ff=0.16.

G1:

FF = 0.36 + (0.48 * 0.25) = 0.36 + 0.12 = 0.48
Ff = 0.48 * 0.5 = 0.24
ff = 0.16 + (0.48 * 0.25) = 0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28

So G1: FF=0.48, Ff=0.24, ff=0.28.

Wait, checking the sum: 0.48+0.24+0.28 = 1.0, correct.

Now G2:

FF = 0.48 + (0.24 * 0.25) = 0.48 + 0.06 = 0.54
Ff = 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.12
ff = 0.28 + (0.24 * 0.25) = 0.28 + 0.06 = 0.34

G2: FF=0.54, Ff=0.12, ff=0.34.

Sum: 0.54+0.12=0.66, +0.34=1.0. Correct.

Now G3:

FF = 0.54 + (0.12 * 0.25) = 0.54 + 0.03 = 0.57
Ff = 0.12 * 0.5 = 0.06
ff = 0.34 + (0.12 * 0.25) = 0.34 + 0.03 = 0.37

Wait, so G3 is FF=0.57, Ff=0.06, ff=0.37.

But wait, let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.57FF + 0.06Ff + 0.37ff. So that's exactly what I got for G3.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

In G0:

FF=0.36, Ff=0.48, ff=0.16.

G1:

FF = 0.36 + (0.48 * 0.25) = 0.36 + 0.12 = 0.48
Ff = 0.48 * 0.5 = 0.24
ff = 0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28.

Yes, that's correct.

G2:

FF = 0.48 + 0.24 * 0.25 = 0.48 + 0.06 = 0.54
Ff = 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.12
ff = 0.28 + 0.24 * 0.25 = 0.28 + 0.06 = 0.34.

G3:

FF = 0.54 + 0.12 * 0.25 = 0.54 + 0.03 = 0.57
Ff = 0.12 * 0.5 = 0.06
ff = 0.34 + 0.03 = 0.37.

Yes, that seems right. So the correct distribution after three generations is 0.57 FF, 0.06 Ff, 0.37 ff, which is option F.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't miss any alternative approach. Another way to model this is to recognize that with each selfing, the frequency of heterozygotes halves each generation because each Ff individual is producing 50% Ff offspring. Wait, no—each Ff individual in the current generation produces 50% Ff in their offspring, but the proportion of Ff in the population as a whole would be multiplied by 0.5 each generation.

Wait, that might have been a simpler way to look at it. Let's see.

In G0, Ff is 0.48.

G1: 0.48 * 0.5 = 0.24.

G2: 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.12.

G3: 0.12 * 0.5 = 0.06.

So Ff in G3 is 0.06. That matches what I got earlier.

And the homozygotes would increase as the heterozygotes decrease. Since each Ff in G0 contributes 0.25 to FF and 0.25 to ff in their offspring.

Wait, but wait—each Ff individual produces 25% FF, 50% Ff, 25% ff. So the proportion of FF and ff from Ff would be 0.25 each, but scaled by the initial Ff frequency.

Wait, but maybe the overall approach is that each heterozygote in generation n contributes (1/2)^n to the Ff frequency in the next generation.

Alternatively, the general formula after t generations of selfing for the heterozygotes is Ff_t = Ff_0 * (1/2)^t.

So initial Ff is 0.48.

After 1 generation: 0.48 * 1/2 = 0.24.

After 2: 0.24 * 1/2 = 0.12.

After 3: 0.06.

Which is correct.

Now, for FF and ff. Since allele frequencies don't change with selfing (only genotype frequencies), the allele frequencies remain p=0.6 and q=0.4 throughout.

So in any generation, FF = p², but wait, no—no, because the population is undergoing selfing and not random mating, so the Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies no longer apply. But wait, the allele frequencies do remain the same.

Wait, no. Selfing doesn't change allele frequencies, only genotype frequencies. So the allele frequencies p and q remain 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, in all generations.

So, the frequency of FF after selfing would be p² + (initial Ff * (probability that Ff turns into FF over the generations)).

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the expected frequencies each generation.

Wait, but I think the approach I took earlier, calculating each generation step by step, is correct. So, after three generations, the Ff frequency is 0.06, and the remaining 0.94 (since 1 - 0.06 = 0.94) would be split between FF and ff in the ratio of their allele frequencies squared.

Wait, no, because each heterozygote contributes to the homozygotes as well.

Alternatively, since allele frequencies are p=0.6 and q=0.4, the proportion of FF is p² + (Ff_initial) * (probability of becoming FF after t generations). Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that each generation, the Ff proportion is halved, and the FF and ff are increased by the loss of Ff.

So, in each generation:

FF_new = FF_old + Ff_old * 0.25
Ff_new = Ff_old * 0.5
ff_new = ff_old + Ff_old * 0.25

Which is exactly how I approached it earlier, and it gave me the correct result.

So according to that, in G3, the distribution is 0.57 FF, 0.06 Ff, 0.37 ff, which is option F.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: 0.57FF + 0.06Ff + 0.37ff.

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option F.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start with a population of garden peas in genetic equilibrium, where the allele frequencies are given as \( p = 0.6 \) (F) and \( q = 0.4 \) (f). The initial genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are:

\[
\text{FF} = p^2 = 0.36, \quad \text{Ff} = 2pq = 0.48, \quad \text{ff} = q^2 = 0.16.
\]

The population undergoes self-fertilization for three generations. Self-fertilization changes genotype frequencies by reducing the proportion of heterozygotes (\( \text{Ff} \)) and increasing the proportion of homozygotes (\( \text{FF} \) and \( \text{ff} \)). Specifically:

1. **Homozygotes (\( \text{FF} \) and \( \text{ff} \)) produce only themselves when self-fertilized.**
2. **Heterozygotes (\( \text{Ff} \)) produce offspring in the ratio \( 25\% \, \text{FF}, 50\% \, \text{Ff}, 25\% \, \text{ff} \).**

Using this, the genotype frequencies for each generation can be calculated as follows:

### Generation 1 (G1):
\[
\text{FF}_{\text{G1}} = \text{FF}_{\text{G0}} + (\text{Ff}_{\text{G0}} \times 0.25) = 0.36 + (0.48 \times 0.25) = 0.48,
\]
\[
\text{Ff}_{\text{G1}} = \text{Ff}_{\text{G0}} \times 0.5 = 0.48 \times 0.5 = 0.24,
\]
\[
\text{ff}_{\text{G1}} = \text{ff}_{\text{G0}} + (\text{Ff}_{\text{G0}} \times 0.25) = 0.16 + (0.48 \times 0.25) = 0.28.
\]

### Generation 2 (G2):
\[
\text{FF}_{\text{G2}} = \text{FF}_{\text{G1}} + (\text{Ff}_{\text{G1}} \times 0.25) = 0.48 + (0.24 \times 0.25) = 0.54,
\]
\[
\text{Ff}_{\text{G2}} = \text{Ff}_{\text{G1}} \times 0.5 = 0.24 \times 0.5 = 0.12,
\]
\[
\text{ff}_{\text{G2}} = \text{ff}_{\text{G1}} + (\text{Ff}_{\text{G1}} \times 0.25) = 0.28 + (0.24 \times 0.25) = 0.34.
\]

### Generation 3 (G3):
\[
\text{FF}_{\text{G3}} = \text{FF}_{\text{G2}} + (\text{Ff}_{\text{G2}} \times 0.25) = 0.54 + (0.12 \times 0.25) = 0.57,
\]
\[
\text{Ff}_{\text{G3}} = \text{Ff}_{\text{G2}} \times 0.5 = 0.12 \times 0.5 = 0.06,
\]
\[
\text{ff}_{\text{G3}} = \text{ff}_{\text{G2}} + (\text{Ff}_{\text{G2}} \times 0.25) = 0.34 + (0.12 \times 0.25) = 0.37.
\]

After three generations of self-fertilization, the genotype frequencies are:

\[
\text{FF} = 0.57, \quad \text{Ff} = 0.06, \quad \text{ff} = 0.37.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.57FF + 0.06Ff + 0.37ff.**
