Question:

In an orienteering class, you have the goal of moving as far (straight-line distance) from base camp as possible by making three straight-line moves. You may use the following displacements in any order: (a) $\vec{a}, 2.0 \mathrm{~km}$ due east (directly toward the east); (b) $\vec{b}, 2.0 \mathrm{~km} 30^{\circ}$ north of east (at an angle of $30^{\circ}$ toward the north from due east); (c) $\vec{c}, 1.0 \mathrm{~km}$ due west. Alternatively, you may substitute either $-\vec{b}$ for $\vec{b}$ or $-\vec{c}$ for $\vec{c}$. What is the greatest distance you can be from base camp at the end of the third displacement? (We are not concerned about the direction.)

Options:

A: 4.2 m
B: 4.6 km
C: 3.8 km
D: 2.9 km
E: 5.2 km
F: 3.5 m
G:  4.8 m
H: 5.0 km
I: 5.6 m
J: 3.2 km

Okay, so I've got this orienteering problem to solve. The goal is to move as far away from the base camp as possible using three straight-line moves. The available displacements are vectors a, b, and c, but I can also substitute either -b or -c if that helps. Hmm, I need to figure out the best way to combine these vectors to maximize the straight-line distance from the start.

Let me list out the vectors again to make sure I have them right. Vector a is 2.0 km due east. Vector b is 2.0 km at 30 degrees north of east. Vector c is 1.0 km due west. And I can choose to use -b (which would be 2.0 km at 30 degrees south of east, I think) and -c, which would be 1.0 km due east since west's opposite is east.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Vector c is 1 km due west. So -c would be 1 km due east, right. Oh, but wait, vector a is already 2 km east. So using -c instead of c would effectively give me an extra eastward move, but that might not be the best strategy if I'm trying to go as far east as possible, but maybe combining differently gives a better resultant.

So the plan is to choose three displacements from a, b, -b, c, -c, but each can be used only once because I have three moves. Oh wait, no—each displacement is used once, but I can choose the direction (like using -b instead of b, and same for c). So the three moves are either a, b, c, with possible sign changes on b and c.

Wait, but the problem says I can substitute either -b for b or -c for c. So for each of b and c, I can choose the direction. So the possible moves are a, ±b, ±c. But I must use three of them, each either in their original direction or reversed.

So the task is to select three vectors (a, b, c, with possible sign changes on b and c) such that their vector sum has the maximum magnitude.

I think the best approach is to calculate the resultant vector for different combinations and find which gives the largest magnitude.

Let me think about the components. Let's break each vector into east (x) and north (y) components.

Vector a: 2.0 km east, so x = 2.0, y=0.
Vector b: 2.0 km at 30 degrees north of east. So x = 2.0 * cos(30°), y = 2.0 * sin(30°). Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, sin(30)=0.5. So x ≈ 2*0.866=1.732 km, y=1.0 km.

Vector c: 1.0 km west, so x = -1.0, y=0.

Similarly, -b would have components x = -1.732, y = -1.0, because it's 30 degrees south of east. Or wait, no. Wait, wait. If vector b is 30 degrees north of east, then -b would be 30 degrees south of east. So yes, x component is positive but y is negative. So x = 1.732, y = -1.0 for -b.

And -c is 1.0 km east, so x = 1.0, y=0.

So I have to pick three vectors from a, ±b, ±c, with the condition that each vector is used once. Oh wait, no. Wait, the problem says you can substitute either -b for b OR -c for c. So I think that for each of b and c, I can choose their direction when using them. So each displacement can be either in the original direction or opposite. So the three moves could be a, b, c; or a, -b, c; etc.

So the possible options for the three moves are any combination where each of the three is either a, ±b, ±c, but each is used exactly once. So in total, I can have 2 possibilities for b and 2 for c, so 4 possibilities for each displacement. Wait, no, it's three displacements, each can have two options (original or opposite), but since they are three separate vectors, I can choose each's direction independently. So the total number of possible combinations is 2^2=4, because a is fixed (can't be reversed?), wait, no: the problem says "you may substitute either -b for b or -c for c." So a can't be substituted. So a is fixed as east. But for b, I can choose +b or -b, and similarly for c, +c or -c. So the three displacements are a, and then either b or -b, and either c or -c. So that's four possible combinations: (a, b, c), (a, b, -c), (a, -b, c), (a, -b, -c).

Wait, that's correct? Because each of the three moves is a, then either b or -b, then either c or -c. So four possible cases.

But wait, no, wait: the problem states that you have three moves, each can be any of a, b, c, with the option to substitute either -b for b or -c for c. So perhaps the three moves are a, b, c, but you can choose for each of b and c whether to take the vector or its negative. So there are 2^2 =4 possible combinations for the three moves.

So the four possibilities are:

1. a, b, c

2. a, b, -c

3. a, -b, c

4. a, -b, -c

So I need to compute the resultant displacement for each of these four cases and find which gives the maximum distance.

Let me compute each case.

Case 1: a + b + c.

Compute the components.

a: x=2, y=0.

b: x=1.732, y=1.

c: x=-1, y=0.

Sum x: 2 + 1.732 -1 = 2.732 km.

Sum y: 0 +1 +0 =1 km.

Magnitude: sqrt( (2.732)^2 + (1)^2 )

2.732 squared is approx 7.464, plus 1 is 8.464. Square root is approx 2.91 km.

Case 2: a + b + (-c) → a + b - c.

c is -1 in x, but if we take -c, that's +1 in x.

Wait, no. Wait, c is 1 km west (x=-1). So -c is 1 km east (x=+1).

So in this case, the components are:

a: x=2, y=0.

b: x=1.732, y=1.

-c: x=1, y=0.

Sum x: 2 +1.732 +1 =4.732 km.

Sum y: 0 +1 +0 =1 km.

Magnitude: sqrt( (4.732)^2 +1^2 )

4.732 squared is approx 22.39, plus 1 is 23.39. Square root is approx 4.837 km.

That's a much bigger distance. Hmm, that's about 4.84 km.

Case 3: a + (-b) + c → a -b +c.

So components:

a: x=2, y=0.

-b: x= -1.732, y= -1.

c: x= -1, y=0.

Sum x: 2 -1.732 -1 = (2-1.732) is 0.268, minus 1 gives -0.732 km. So x is negative.

Sum y: 0 -1 +0 = -1 km.

Magnitude: sqrt( (-0.732)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(0.536 +1) = sqrt(1.536)= approx 1.24 km. So that's not good.

Case 4: a + (-b) + (-c) → a -b -c.

So components:

a: x=2, y=0.

-b: x= -1.732, y= -1.

-c: x=1, y=0.

Sum x: 2 -1.732 +1 = 1.268 km.

Sum y: 0 -1 +0 = -1 km.

Magnitude: sqrt( (1.268)^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(1.608 +1)= sqrt(2.608)= approx 1.616 km.

So the four cases give:

Case 1: ~2.91 km.

Case 2: ~4.84 km.

Case 3: ~1.24 km.

Case 4: ~1.616 km.

So the maximum is case 2, which is about 4.84 km.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option H is 5.0 km, option B is 4.6, option E is 5.2, option I is 5.6. So 4.84 is close to 4.8 km. The options given are:

Options:

A: 4.2 m → 0.0042 km.

B:4.6 km.

C:3.8 km.

D:2.9 km.

E:5.2 km.

F:3.5 m →0.0035 km.

G:4.8 m →0.0048 km.

H:5.0 km.

I:5.6 m →0.0056 km.

J:3.2 km.

Wait, but in my calculation, case 2 gives about 4.837 km, which is approximately 4.8 km. So the closest option would be G:4.8 m? No, wait, no. Wait the options are in km except for G which is 4.8 m. Oh no, wait, looking again:

Wait the options are:

A:4.2 m

B:4.6 km

C:3.8 km

D:2.9 km

E:5.2 km

F:3.5 m

G:4.8 m

H:5.0 km

I:5.6 m

J:3.2 km

Wait, so in the problem, the possible options are in km except for some in meters. But our calculation is 4.837 km, so the options are B:4.6 km, G:4.8 m (which is 0.0048 km, way smaller), H:5.0 km, E:5.2 km.

Wait, but in the options, G is 4.8 meters, not kilometers, so that's 0.0048 km, which is way smaller than our result. So the closest match would be B:4.6 km, but wait our case 2 is 4.837 km, which is closer to 4.8 km. So why isn't there an option for 4.8 km?

Wait, looking again at the options, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 4.2 m

B:4.6 km

C:3.8 km

D:2.9 km

E:5.2 km

F:3.5 m

G:4.8 m

H:5.0 km

I:5.6 m

J:3.2 km

Hmm, so the only option near 4.8 km is B:4.6, but that's 0.237 km less than our calculated 4.837. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation for case 2. Let me recheck.

Case 2: a + b + (-c) → a + b - c.

Wait, no, wait: the vectors are a, b, -c.

So a is 2 east.

b is 1.732 east and 1 north.

-c is 1 east (since c is 1 west, so -c is 1 east).

So summing the x-components: 2 +1.732 +1 =4.732.

Y-components: 0 +1 +0=1.

So the resultant vector is (4.732, 1).

The magnitude is sqrt( (4.732)^2 + (1)^2 )

Calculate 4.732 squared: 4.732 * 4.732.

Let me compute that:

4 *4=16; 4*.732=2.928; .732*4=2.928; .732^2≈0.536.

Wait, 4.732^2 = (4 + 0.732)^2 = 4^2 + 2*4*0.732 + 0.732^2 = 16 + 5.856 + 0.536 = 22.392.

Adding 1^2 gives 23.392.

Square root of 23.392 is approximately 4.838 km.

So that's about 4.84 km, which is approximately 4.8 km. But the options don't have 4.8 km. Oh wait, option G is 4.8 m, which is 0.0048 km, way too small.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the possible combinations. Maybe there are more possible combinations than the four I considered. Because the problem says you can substitute either -b for b OR -c for c. So perhaps the three moves can include a, and then any combination of substituting for b and c, but I'm not limited to just substituting one of them. So in case 2, I used a, b, -c. But perhaps another combination could give a larger displacement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the best way is to arrange the vectors so that all are in the same general direction. For maximum distance, we want all the vectors pointing in roughly the same direction. So a is east, b is northeast, and c is west. So if I take a, b, and -c (which is east), all contributing to the east direction, that would make sense.

Wait, that's exactly case 2, which gives 4.84 km. So that's the maximum.

But looking at the options, the closest is B:4.6 km, but that's less than our result. Hmmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should consider other combinations beyond the four cases. Because perhaps another approach is to use a, -b, and -c, but that might not be better. Wait, no, I already considered that in case 4, which gave 1.616 km.

Alternatively, is there a way to arrange the vectors so that two of them reinforce each other in a direction beyond simple east? For example, using a and b to go northeast, but then using -c (east) to add more east. Or perhaps another combination.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a, b, and -c gives the maximum eastward, but what if I use a, -b, and -c? Let's see:

a: 2 east.

-b: 30 degrees south of east, so x=1.732, y=-1.

-c: 1 east.

Sum x: 2 +1.732 +1 =4.732.

Sum y: 0 -1 +0= -1.

Same as case 2, which gives 4.84 km. Oh wait, that's the same as case 2. So no difference.

Wait no, wait: in case 2, the vectors are a, b, -c. So that's a=2 east, b=1.732 east, 1 north; -c=1 east.

So sum is 4.732 east, 1 north.

In the alternative where I take a, -b, and -c, which would be a=2 east, -b=1.732 east (because -b has x positive?), wait no: wait wait, no.

Wait, wait. Vector b is 2 km at 30 degrees north of east. So its components are (1.732, 1). So -b would be ( -1.732, -1 ). Because to reverse the direction, both x and y components change sign.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if vector b is 30 degrees north of east, then -b would be 30 degrees south of west, meaning it points southwest? Or wait, no: the opposite of 30 degrees north of east is 30 degrees south of west? No, no, the opposite direction would be 180 degrees opposite, which would be 30 degrees south of west.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the components earlier. Let me re-calculate.

Vector b is 2 km at 30 degrees north of east. So east is positive x, north is positive y.

So components: bx = 2 cos(30) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)≈1.732 km.

by = 2 sin(30)=1 km.

So vector b is (1.732, 1).

Then, -b is (-1.732, -1).

Similarly, vector c is ( -1, 0 ). So -c is (1, 0).

So in case where I take a, -b, and -c:

a is (2,0).

-b is (-1.732, -1).

-c is (1,0).

Sum x: 2 + (-1.732) +1 = 2 -1.732 +1 = 1.268 km.

Sum y: 0 + (-1) +0 = -1 km.

Magnitude: sqrt( (1.268)^2 + (-1)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1.608 + 1) = sqrt(2.608) ≈1.616 km.

Which is what I had before.

So in case 2, when I took a, b, and -c, the sum is (4.732,1), magnitude ~4.837 km.

Is there any other combination where I can get a larger magnitude?

Wait, perhaps if I take a, -b, and c.

Wait, let's compute that.

a is (2,0).

-b is (-1.732, -1).

c is (-1, 0).

Sum x: 2 -1.732 -1 = (2-1.732)=0.268; 0.268-1= -0.732 km.

Sum y: 0 -1 +0= -1 km.

Magnitude: sqrt( (-0.732)^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(0.536 +1 )=sqrt(1.
