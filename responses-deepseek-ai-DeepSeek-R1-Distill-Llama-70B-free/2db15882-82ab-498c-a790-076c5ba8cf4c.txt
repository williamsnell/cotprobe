Question:

Do third States enjoy any fishing rights within the Exclusive Economic Zone of another State?

Options:

A: Third States may never have access to fisheries within another State's EEZ
B: Third States are free to fish within another EEZ, except from certain designated areas
C: When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States
D: The coastal State must share all of its fish resources with all other States
E: Third States have access to fisheries within its EEZ only during a specific season
F: The coastal State is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to States with which it has diplomatic relations
G: Third States have unlimited fishing rights within the EEZ of any State
H: Third States can only fish within another State's EEZ with a special permit
I: The coastal State is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to neighbouring States
J: Third States can only fish within another State's EEZ if they have a mutual agreement

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about fishing rights in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of another state. I'm a bit rusty on my maritime law, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking whether third states have any fishing rights within another state's EEZ. Let me remember what I learned about EEZs. From what I recall, the EEZ gives the coastal state sovereign rights over the living and non-living resources within that zone, which extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coast.

So, the coastal state has the primary right to exploit these resources. But does that mean other states can't fish there at all? I don't think so. I remember something about the coastal state allowing access under certain conditions.

Wait, I think it's related to the surplus. If the coastal state can't harvest the entire allowable catch, they have to give access to other states. But which states get priority? Oh right, developing countries, especially those that are land-locked or geographically disadvantaged, are given priority. 

Looking at the options now. Option C says that when the coastal state can't harvest the total allowable catch, they must give other states access, with priority to developing and land-locked states. That sounds familiar. 

Other options don't seem right. Option A says third states can never fish, which contradicts what I just thought. Option B suggests they can fish except in certain areas, which doesn't sound like the rule. Option D says the coastal state must share all fish resources, which isn't correct because the coastal state has primary rights. Option E is about specific seasons, which I don't think is the main rule. Option F talks about diplomatic relations, which I don't recall being a condition. Option G says unlimited rights, which is definitely wrong. Option H mentions a special permit, which might be part of the process, but the main point is the surplus and priority. Option I limits it to neighboring states, but I think it's broader, including developing states regardless of location. Option J says mutual agreement is needed, which is true, but the question is about the right, not just the agreement. So option J might be correct in a way, but option C seems more precise because it's about the surplus and priority.

Wait, but option J says third states can fish only if they have a mutual agreement. So in practice, even if there's a surplus, the coastal state would likely require an agreement. So both C and J seem relevant. But the question is about the rights. The right exists when the coastal state can't harvest all, and they must give access, especially to certain states.

So I think the correct answer is C. Because it directly addresses the surplus and the priority, which is a key principle from UNCLOS.

The correct answer is based on the principle that coastal states have sovereign rights over their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) but are obligated to allow third states access to the surplus of the total allowable catch when they cannot harvest it themselves. This access is granted with priority given to developing and land-locked states, as outlined in international maritime law.

Answer: C
