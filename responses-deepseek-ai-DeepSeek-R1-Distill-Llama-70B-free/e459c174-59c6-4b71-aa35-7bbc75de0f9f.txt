Okay, so I have this physics problem here about lenses and their power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question says that someone holds a lens 50 cm from a flash lamp, and the image is sharply focused at 16.6 cm from the lens. I need to find the power of the lens. The options are from A to J, with various diopter values.

Wait, diopters are the unit for the power of a lens, right? And power is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. So if I can find the focal length, I can find the power. 

But wait, I remember the lens formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. Oh wait, but wait—object distance and image distance. Oh right, in optics, the sign conventions can be tricky. Typically, for a converging lens (which I think this is, since it's forming a real image when the lamp is placed in front), the object distance u is positive when it's on the same side as the incoming light. And the image distance v is positive if the image is on the opposite side, which would mean it's a real image.

So in this case, the object is 50 cm from the lens. So u is 50 cm. The image is formed at 16.6 cm from the lens. So v is 16.6 cm. Wait, but wait—am I getting the object and image distances correct? Because sometimes u is the distance from the object to the lens, and v is the distance from the lens to the image.

So plugging into the formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So u is 50 cm, v is 16.6 cm. But wait, wait—wait, is the image distance positive or negative? Oh, in the standard convention, for a real image (which this is, because it's sharply focused), the image distance v is positive if it's on the opposite side of the lens from the object. Assuming the lamp is on one side, and the image forms on the other. So yes, v is positive.

So converting cm to meters, because the formula uses meters. So u is 0.5 m, v is 0.166 m.

Wait, wait. Wait, no—wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, in the thin lens formula, the object distance u is measured from the lens to the object. But wait, another thing: if the object is placed beyond the focal length of a converging lens, then you get a real image. So I think that's the case here.

So let's compute 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

So u = 0.5 m, v=0.166 m.

So 1/u is 1/0.5 = 2 m^-1.

1/v is 1/0.166 ≈ 6.024 m^-1.

Adding them: 2 + 6.024 ≈ 8.024 m^-1.

So 1/f ≈ 8.024, so f ≈ 1/8.024 ≈ 0.1246 meters, which is about 12.46 cm.

Wait, but the power P is 1/f, but in meters. So f is approximately 0.1246 m, so P is about 8.024 diopters. Oh, because 1 diopter is 1/m. So 1/0.1246 m is approximately 8 diopters.

Looking at the options, option I is 8 diopters. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait a second—did I mix up object and image distances? Let me think again. Is the object distance u = 50 cm, or is it the image distance v? Because sometimes, the object could be placed at a certain position, but the image forms elsewhere.

In the problem, the setup is: the lens is held 50 cm from the flash lamp. So the object distance (u) is 50 cm. The image is formed at 16.6 cm from the lens, so that's the image distance (v) of 16.6 cm.

So the calculation seems correct. 1/f = 1/0.5 + 1/0.166. Let me compute more accurately.

1/0.5 is exactly 2.

1/0.166... Let's calculate more precisely. 0.166666... is 1/6, so 1/(1/6) is 6. So 1/u + 1/v is 2 +6 =8.

So 1/f=8, so f=1/8 m, which is 0.125 m or 12.5 cm. So the power is 8 diopters.

Yes, that's option I.

Wait, but some sources say that when you use the lens formula, if the image is on the same side as the object (for a virtual image), then v is negative. But in this case, the image is sharply focused, which implies it's a real image, so v should be positive.

So the calculation is correct. The power is 8 diopters, option I.

To determine the power of the lens, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

where \( f \) is the focal length, \( u \) is the object distance, and \( v \) is the image distance. The problem states that the object distance \( u \) is 50 cm (or 0.5 m), and the image distance \( v \) is 16.6 cm (or 0.166 m). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.5} + \frac{1}{0.166}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \, \text{m}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{0.166} \approx 6.024 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

Adding these:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = 2 + 6.024 = 8.024 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

Thus, the focal length is:

\[
f = \frac{1}{8.024} \approx 0.1246 \, \text{m}
\]

The power of the lens is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters:

\[
P = \frac{1}{f} \approx 8.024 \, \text{diopters}
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **8 diopters**, which corresponds to option **I**.
