Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ammonia. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy change of formation is involved in these kinds of problems. Let me think through this step by step.

The reaction given is the combustion of NH3 to produce NO and H2O. The question provides the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH°f) for each substance. I need to calculate the overall ΔH° for this reaction.

First, I should write out the balanced chemical equation. Combustion usually involves reacting with oxygen. So, the reactants are NH3 and O2, and the products are NO and H2O. Let me jot that down.

The unbalanced reaction is: NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O.

Now, I need to balance this equation. Let's count each element.

Nitrogen: 1 in NH3, 1 in NO. So that's balanced for N.

Hydrogen: 3 in NH3, 2 in H2O. So I'll need to balance that. Maybe multiply NH3 by 4 and H2O by 2? Let me see.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's see:

NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O.

Let me count the elements:

- N: 1 on each side (NH3 and NO each have 1 N)
- H: 3 in NH3 and 2*1=2 in H2O (since H2O has 2 H)
- O: 2 in O2, 1 in NO, and 1 in H2O.

So to balance H, I can have 2 NH3 molecules. That gives 6 H, which would require 3 H2O (since each has 2 H, so 3*2=6).

Wait, maybe that's a way. Let me try:

2 NH3 + O2 → 2 NO + 3 H2O.

Wait, let's check:

N: 2 (from 2 NH3) → 2 (from 2 NO) → balanced.
H: 2*3=6 (from NH3) → 3 H2O has 6 H → balanced.
O: Let's see, O2 is O2, so 2 O on the left. On the right: 2 NO (2 O) and 3 H2O (3 O). So total O on right is 2 + 3*1 = 5 O. But on the left, O2 is 2 O. So 5 O on right needs to come from O2 on left. So we need 5/2 O2 molecules.

Putting it all together, the balanced equation should be:

2 NH3 + (5/2) O2 → 2 NO + 3 H2O(l).

Wait, but I can multiply all coefficients by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4 NH3 + 5 O2 → 4 NO + 6 H2O(l).

But wait, the question asks for the reaction producing NO and H2O. So whether I use the 2 or 4 coefficients depends on how the problem is set up. Hmm, but the way the question is phrased, the products are NO(g) and H2O(l), so I need the balanced equation in the correct stoichiometric ratios.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard approach for enthalpy change of reaction. The formula is ΔH°rxn = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants).

Right, so each substance's ΔH°f is multiplied by its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced equation.

So first, I need to get the balanced equation. Let me try again.

The unbalanced equation: NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O.

Let me assign variables:

a NH3 + b O2 → c NO + d H2O.

Balancing N: a = c.

Balancing H: 3a = 2d → since H2O has 2 H, d = (3a)/2.

Balancing O: 2b = c (from NO) + d (from H2O).

Substitute a = c, and d = (3a/2):

2b = a + (3a/2 ) → 2b = (5a/2) → b = (5a/4).

To make all coefficients integers, let a=4.

So a=4, c=4, d=6 (since d=3*4/2=6), b=5.

So the balanced equation is:

4 NH3 + 5 O2 → 4 NO + 6 H2O(l).

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the combustion of NH3 to give NO and H2O. So the products are NO and H2O, which matches.

Now, for the enthalpy change. Using the formula: ΔH° = [sum ΔH°f(products)] - [sum ΔH°f(reactants)].

The products are NO and H2O. The reactants are NH3 and O2.

Wait, but O2 is in its standard state, so ΔH°f for O2(g) is zero. So I can ignore it.

So ΔH°rxn = [4*(ΔH°f NO) + 6*(ΔH°f H2O)] - [4*(ΔH°f NH3) + 5*(ΔH°f O2)].

But O2's ΔH°f is zero, so the equation simplifies to:

ΔH°rxn = [4*(21.57) + 6*(-68.32)] - [4*(-11.02) + 5*(0)].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, products:

4 * 21.57 = 86.28 Kcal/mol.

6 * (-68.32) = -409.92 Kcal/mol.

Sum of products: 86.28 - 409.92 = -323.64 Kcal/mol.

Reactants:

4 * (-11.02) = -44.08 Kcal/mol.

5 * 0 = 0.

Sum of reactants: -44.08 Kcal/mol.

Now, ΔH°rxn = (-323.64) - (-44.08) = (-323.64 + 44.08) = -279.56 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is -279.56 Kcal/mol. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

Compute products:

4 * 21.57 = 21.57 *4.

21 *4 =84, 0.57 *4=2.28. So 86.28. Correct.

6 * (-68.32) = -409.92. Correct.

Total products: 86.28 -409.92 = -323.64.

Reactants: 4*(-11.02) = -44.08. Correct.

So ΔH°rxn is -323.64 - (-44.08) = -323.64 +44.08 = -279.56.

Yes, which matches option C.

To calculate the standard enthalpy change, ∆H°, for the combustion of ammonia (NH₃) to produce nitric oxide (NO) and water (H₂O), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \sum \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{products}) - \sum \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{reactants})
\]

### Step 1: Write and balance the chemical equation
The combustion reaction is:

\[
NH_3 + O_2 \rightarrow NO + H_2O
\]

Balancing the equation:

- Nitrogen: 1 in NH₃ and 1 in NO → balanced.
- Hydrogen: 3 in NH₃ and 2 in H₂O → multiply NH₃ by 4 and H₂O by 6.
- Oxygen: 2 in O₂, 1 in NO, and 1 in H₂O → multiply O₂ by 5.

The balanced equation is:

\[
4 NH_3 + 5 O_2 \rightarrow 4 NO + 6 H_2O
\]

### Step 2: Apply the enthalpy change formula
The given enthalpies of formation are:
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(NH_3) = -11.02 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\),
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(NO) = 21.57 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\),
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(H_2O) = -68.32 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\),
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(O_2) = 0 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\) (standard state).

Using the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \left[ 4 \cdot \Delta H^\circ_f(NO) + 6 \cdot \Delta H^\circ_f(H_2O) \right] - \left[ 4 \cdot \Delta H^\circ_f(NH_3) + 5 \cdot \Delta H^\circ_f(O_2) \right]
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \left[ 4 \cdot 21.57 + 6 \cdot (-68.32) \right] - \left[ 4 \cdot (-11.02) + 5 \cdot 0 \right]
\]

### Step 3: Calculate each term
- Products:
  \[
  4 \cdot 21.57 = 86.28 \, \text{Kcal/mol}, \quad 6 \cdot (-68.32) = -409.92 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total for products} = 86.28 - 409.92 = -323.64 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
  \]

- Reactants:
  \[
  4 \cdot (-11.02) = -44.08 \, \text{Kcal/mol}, \quad 5 \cdot 0 = 0
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total for reactants} = -44.08 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
  \]

### Step 4: Compute the final result
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = -323.64 - (-44.08) = -323.64 + 44.08 = -279.56 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The standard enthalpy change for the reaction is \(-279.56 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\), which corresponds to **option C**.
