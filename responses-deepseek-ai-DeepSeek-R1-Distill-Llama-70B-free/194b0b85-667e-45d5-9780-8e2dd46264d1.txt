Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the mean free path and the time between collisions of hydrogen atoms in intergalactic space. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions, and the time between collisions is how long it takes for that to happen. 

The question gives me the concentration of hydrogen atoms as 1 per 100 liters. Wait, that seems really low. Oh right, intergalactic space is a vacuum compared to what we're used to. The temperature is 7.8e50 K? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 7.8 times 10^50 Kelvin? That seems incredibly high. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo? Because room temperature is about 300 K. But maybe it's correct, perhaps referring to some extreme conditions. I'll proceed with that number.

The collision diameter is given as 2.0 angstroms. An angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2.0e-10 m. 

For the mean free path, I think the formula is lambda = 1/(sqrt(2) * n * sigma), where n is the number density, and sigma is the collision cross-section. 

Wait, let me think. The collision cross-section sigma is the effective area that each atom presents for collisions. Since the collision diameter is d, the radius is d/2, so the area is pi*(d/2)^2. So sigma = pi * (d/2)^2.

So first, I need to calculate n, the number density. The concentration is 1 atom per 100 liters. Wait, 1 per 100 liters is 0.01 atoms per liter. But I should convert that to per cubic meter. 

One liter is 0.001 cubic meters, so 1 liter = 1e-3 m^3. So 100 liters is 0.1 m^3. So n = 1 atom / 0.1 m^3 = 10 atoms/m^3? Wait no, wait: the concentration is 1 atom per 100 liters, so 100 liters is 0.1 m³. So n = 1 / 0.1 = 10 atoms/m³? Wait no, wait: 1 per 100 liters → 1 / (0.1 m³) = 10 m⁻³. Wait, no, 1/(0.1) is 10, yes. So n is 10 atoms per cubic meter.

Wait, but 1 per 100 liters is 0.01 per liter, right? Because 100 liters = 0.1 m³, so 1 in 0.1 m³. So n = 1 / 0.1 = 10 m^-3.

Now, sigma is pi*(d/2)^2. d is 2 Å, which is 2e-10 m. So radius is 1e-10 m. So sigma is pi * (1e-10)^2 = pi * 1e-20 m² ≈ 3.14e-20 m².

So lambda = 1/(sqrt(2) * n * sigma) = 1/(sqrt(2) * 10 * 3.14e-20 )

Let's compute the denominator first. sqrt(2) is about 1.414. So 1.414 * 10 * 3.14e-20 → 1.414 * 3.14 ≈ 4.442, so 4.442e-19. So lambda ≈ 1/(4.442e-19) ≈ 2.25e18 meters.

Wait, that's meters. But the question asks for light-years. Oh, right. I need to convert meters to light-years. 

How many meters are in a light-year? I remember that a light-year is about 9.461e15 meters. So, lambda in light-years is 2.25e18 / 9.461e15 ≈ let's see. 2.25e18 / 9.46e15 is approximately 2.38e2, so about 238 light-years? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 40-80 light-years. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me double-check the calculations. Let me recalculate the denominator.

n = 10 m⁻³. sigma ≈ 3.14e-20 m². So n * sigma = 10 * 3.14e-20 = 3.14e-19 m⁻¹.

Multiply by sqrt(2): 3.14e-19 * 1.414 ≈ 4.44e-19 m⁻¹.

So lambda = 1/(4.44e-19) ≈ 2.25e18 meters. 

Wait, 2.25e18 meters divided by 9.46e15 meters per light-year is 2.25e18 / 9.46e15 ≈ 237.8 light-years. But none of the options are near 238. The options are like 40-80. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the concentration. Let me re-express it. The concentration is 1 atom per 100 liters. So 1 per 0.1 cubic meters. So n = 1 / 0.1 = 10 atoms/m³. That seems right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, could the mean free path formula use (n sigma) in some other way? Let me think. Oh, wait, the mean free path is given by lambda = 1/(sqrt(2) n sigma), correct?

Wait, another approach: number of atoms per volume (n) is 10 m^-3. The cross-section per atom is sigma = pi (d/2)^2. So the total cross-section per volume is n * sigma. So collisions happen when another atom passes through this cross-section. So the mean free path is the inverse of that, multiplied by sqrt(2) because of the relative motion. So yes, lambda is 1/(sqrt(2) n sigma).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for the collision diameter. Wait, 2.0 Å is 2.0e-10 meters, correct. So the radius is 1e-10 m. So sigma is pi*(1e-10)^2 = 3.14e-20 m². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the temperature is supposed to be in a different unit? Wait, the temperature given is 7.8e50 K. That's way, way higher than anything I've heard. The universe's temperature is about 2.7 K. So 7.8e50 K seems impossible. Oh wait, perhaps it's 7.8e5 K? Or 7.8e3? Could the problem have a typo? Because 1e50 K is way beyond anything realistic. Maybe it's 7.8e5 K? But the problem says 7.8 × 10^50 K. Hmm, but maybe it's correct. Let me think.

Wait, but in the mean free path formula, temperature doesn't directly come into play. Hmm. Wait, no. Oh wait, the formula for mean free path actually uses the average speed, which depends on temperature. Oh wait, I think I forgot to consider the thermal speed of the atoms, which affects the collision rate. Oh no! Because the mean free path formula I was using (lambda = 1/(sqrt(2) n sigma)) is correct only if the relative speed is considered. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. 

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The mean free path formula is lambda = (1)/(sqrt(2) n sigma) ) * 1, but wait, is that correct? Or does that formula already account for the speed?

No, wait. The formula for mean free path is lambda = 1/(sqrt(2) n sigma). But wait, that's actually for the mean free path when the atoms are stationary except for the one moving. But in reality, both atoms are moving, so the relative speed affects the collision rate. Hmm, perhaps I should be using the mean speed of the atoms, which comes from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe the formula I used is correct for the mean free path in terms of number density and collision cross-section. Because the speed affects the collision frequency, but the mean free path is just about the distance between collisions, which would depend on the number density and the cross-section. So maybe the temperature is a red herring here, or perhaps it's only needed for part (b), the time between collisions.

Wait, because part (a) is just the mean free path in distance, which is what I calculated. But according to my calculation, it's 238 light-years, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check that.

Wait, 1 liter is 0.001 m³, so 100 liters is 0.1 m³. So n is 1 per 0.1 m³ → 10 atoms/m³. Correct.

Sigma is pi*(d/2)^2. d=2e-10 m → radius 1e-10 m. So sigma is pi*(1e-10)^2 = 3.14e-20 m². Correct.

So denominator: sqrt(2) * n * sigma = 1.414 * 10 * 3.14e-20 = 1.414 * 3.14e-19 → approx 4.44e-19 m^-1.

So lambda = 1 / (4.44e-19) = approx 2.25e18 meters. 

Wait, 1 light-year is about 9.46e15 meters, so 2.25e18 / 9.46e15 = approx 238 light-years. 

But the options are in the 40-80 range. So I'm way off. That suggests that I made a mistake in calculating n. Let me re-express the concentration.

Wait, 1 atom per 100 liters → 1 atom / 0.1 m³ → that's 10 atoms/m³, correct? Or wait, wait: 100 liters is 0.1 m³, so 1 / 0.1 m³ → 10 m⁻³.

Wait, but if the concentration is 1 per 100 liters, that's 0.01 per liter. So in 1 m³, which is 1000 liters, that's 0.01 * 1000 → 10 atoms/m³. Yes, correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Another version of the mean free path is lambda = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where P is pressure, but I don't have pressure here. Alternatively, since n is given, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, another formula for mean free path is lambda = 1/(n * sigma * sqrt(2)).

Wait, maybe I should use Avogadro's number. Oh wait, no, because n is given in atoms per volume. So perhaps I'm correct, but let me think if I missed a factor. Oh, wait, no, I think I did everything correctly.

Hmm, maybe the temperature is way higher, so the atoms are moving much faster, but wait, that wouldn't affect the mean free path, which is just a distance. Oh wait, no. The mean free path is determined by the spacing between atoms and the size of the atoms. Speed affects the time between collisions, not the distance.

So perhaps my calculation is correct, but the options don't include 238 ly. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again.

n = 10 m⁻³.

sigma = pi*(1e-10)^2 = 3.1416e-20 m².

lambda = 1/(sqrt(2)*n*sigma) = 1/(1.4142 * 10 * 3.1416e-20).

Compute denominator: 1.4142 * 10 =14.142; 14.142 * 3.1416e-20 = approx 4.44e-19.

So 1 / 4.44e-19 = approx 2.25e18 meters.

Convert to light-years: 2.25e18 m / 9.46e15 m/ly → approx 238 ly.

Hmm. But that's not one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the value of n.

Wait, perhaps 1 per 100 liters is 1 per 0.1 cubic meters → n = 1/0.1 = 10 m⁻³, correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem uses cm instead of meters somewhere? Let me see.

Wait, 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 100 liters is 10^5 cm³. So 1 per 100 liters is 1 per 1e5 cm³ → which is 1e-5 atoms/cm³. Wait, but converting to m³: 1 m³ is 1e6 liters. Wait, no, 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So 1 per 100 liters is 10 per m³, same as before.

I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the collision diameter is in a different unit. Wait, 2.0 Å is 2e-10 meters, correct.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path formula uses the sum of the radii? No, I think the formula is correct as sigma = pi*(d/2)^2, where d is the collision diameter.

Wait, could the problem be using a different value for Avogadro's number, but I don't think so because I didn't use it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should calculate the mean free path using the formula that involves the thermal speed.

Wait, the mean free path can also be calculated as lambda = v_mean * tau, where tau is the mean time between collisions. But that would involve the speed, which comes from the temperature. But for part a), I only need lambda, which is just based on geometry.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sigma. Let me compute it again.

d = 2e-10 m. radius = 1e-10 m.

Area = pi * (1e-10)^2 = 3.1416e-20 m². Correct.

So perhaps I should consider that the mean free path formula is lambda = 1/(n * sigma * sqrt(2)).

Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given concentration is 1 atom per 100 cubic meters, not liters? No, the question says 100 liters, which is 0.1 m³. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute denominator again.

sqrt(2) = 1.4142.

n =10, sigma=3.14e-20. So denominator is 1.4142 *10 *3.14e-20 = 1.4142 *3.14e-19 → 4.442e-19.

So lambda = 1/(4.442e-19) = approx 2.25e18 m.

Wait, 2.25e18 meters divided by 9.46e15 meters per light-year is 2.25e18 /9.46e15 ≈ 238 light-years.

But this is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the concentration is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 atom per 100 liters → 1 / (0.1 m³) = 10 m⁻³. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the collision diameter is 2.0 Å, but the formula uses radius, not diameter. Oh, no, because sigma is based on the radius. So sigma is pi*(d/2)^2, which I did. So that's correct.

Wait, could the formula use the sum of the radii? No, because that's already considered when using the diameter.

Wait, perhaps I should express the mean free path in terms of the number of atoms per liter. Wait, no, because I converted liters to m³ correctly.

Hmm, perhaps the temperature is supposed to be 7.8e5 K, not 7.8e50 K. Because 7.8e5 is 780,000 K, which is still very high but perhaps possible in some astrophysical contexts. But the problem says 7.8e50 K, which is way beyond anything realistic. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the intended value is 7.8e5 K. Let me proceed under that assumption, because otherwise, part (b) would require using that temperature, which is impossible.

Wait, but part (a) doesn't involve temperature, so perhaps I can proceed with the calculation as before.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the mean free path is about 238 light-years, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the formula for lambda uses the sum of the collision diameters, but no, because the formula already accounts for the cross-section correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the number density is 1 per 100 liters, which is 10 per cubic meter. So n=10 m⁻³.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the volume per atom. If there's 1 atom in 0.1 m³, then the average distance between atoms is the cube root of (0.1 /1) → cube root of 0.1 m³ is approx 0.464 m. But that's the average distance between atoms, not considering their size. But the mean free path is longer than that, considering the atoms' motion and size. Hmm, but that gives an average distance of about 0.46 m, which is much less than the mean free path I calculated. So that suggests that my earlier calculation is wrong.

Wait, wait, no. The mean free path is the average distance traveled between collisions, which depends on the number density and the cross-sectional area. So perhaps the 238 light-years is correct, but the options don't include it. So maybe the given options are wrong, or I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration is 1 per liter, but the question says 1 per 100 liters. So that would make n=1e4 m⁻³, which would change the calculation.

Wait, no, the question says 1 per 100 liters, which is 0.01 per liter, which is 10 per m³.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me consider that perhaps the mean free path is 238 light-years, but the options are all lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating n.

Wait, perhaps 1
