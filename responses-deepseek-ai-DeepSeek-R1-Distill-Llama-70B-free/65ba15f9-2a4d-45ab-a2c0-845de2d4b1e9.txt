Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: DNAase specifically targets bacterial DNA, not viral DNA.
B: The virus doesn't contain any genetic material.
C: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.
D: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor, protecting its DNA.
E: The virus contains both DNA and RNA.
F: The virus uses a DNAase-resistant polymerase for replication.
G: The virus has an outer shell that prevents DNAase from entering.
H: The virus contains a special type of DNA that is resistant to DNAase.
I: The virus contains DNA, but DNAase is only effective in bacterial cells.
J: The virus contains DNA, it is not affected by DNAase.

Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question is about DNAase and its effect on bacterial cells versus RNA viruses. So, when DNAase is added to a bacterial cell, the DNA gets hydrolyzed, which means the cell can't make proteins anymore and dies. But when DNAase is added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Hmm, why is that?

I remember that DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So in bacteria, which have DNA as their genetic material, adding DNAase would destroy their DNA. Without DNA, they can't transcribe RNA or make proteins, so they die. That makes sense.

But the RNA viruses are different. They continue to produce proteins even when DNAase is present. Wait, RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic material, right? So their genetic info is in RNA, not DNA. DNAase specifically breaks down DNA, so if the virus doesn't have DNA, the enzyme wouldn't affect them. Oh, right, because DNAase doesn't act on RNA.

So looking at the options:

Option C says the virus contains RNA, so it's not affected by DNAase. That seems correct. Because RNA viruses use RNA for their genetic material, DNAase can't do anything to them. So the virus can still make proteins because their RNA is intact.

Other options: Let's see. Option A says DNAase targets bacterial DNA specifically. I don't think that's true because DNAase should break any DNA, regardless of the source. Unless the bacterial DNA is somehow unique, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option B says the virus doesn't have any genetic material. No, that's wrong. Viruses do have genetic material, either DNA or RNA.

Option D says the virus has a DNAase inhibitor. But if the virus doesn't have DNA, that wouldn't matter. Unless it's a DNA virus. Wait, the question is about RNA viruses, so this option isn't relevant.

Option E says the virus has both DNA and RNA. No, viruses have either DNA or RNA, not both.

Option F says the virus uses a DNAase-resistant polymerase. But why would that matter if the virus's genetic material is RNA? The polymerase would replicate RNA, not DNA.

Option G suggests the virus has an outer shell preventing DNAase from entering. Wait, viruses are typically very small and their structure is different. Bacterial cells have cell walls and membranes, but if the virus is inside a host, maybe the host's cell would protect it? Or maybe the virus's structure doesn't allow DNAase in. But I'm not sure. But the main point is that RNA viruses don't rely on DNA anyway.

Option H says the virus has special DNA resistant to DNAase. But again, RNA viruses don't have DNA, so this doesn't apply.

Option I says the virus has DNA, but DNAase only works in bacteria. That can't be right because if a virus had DNA, DNAase should still break it unless the virus's DNA is somehow protected.

Option J says the virus has DNA and it's unaffected. But the question is about RNA viruses, so this doesn't apply.

So the correct answer should be option C. Because RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic material, DNAase doesn't affect them. So when DNAase is added, it doesn't break down their RNA, so the virus can continue to produce proteins using their RNA.

The question asks why DNAase affects bacterial cells but not RNA viruses. DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA, so in bacterial cells, which rely on DNA as their genetic material, the addition of DNAase hydrolyzes the DNA, halting protein synthesis and leading to cell death. However, RNA viruses use RNA as their genetic material, not DNA. Since DNAase specifically targets DNA, it has no effect on RNA viruses, allowing them to continue producing proteins.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because DNAase does not specifically target bacterial DNA; it breaks down any DNA.
- **B** is incorrect because viruses do have genetic material, either DNA or RNA.
- **C** is correct because RNA viruses contain RNA, which is unaffected by DNAase.
- **D** is irrelevant because RNA viruses do not have DNA to protect.
- **E** is incorrect because viruses have either DNA or RNA, not both.
- **F** is irrelevant because RNA viruses replicate RNA, not DNA.
- **G** is incorrect because the question focuses on the type of genetic material, not physical barriers.
- **H** is incorrect because RNA viruses do not have DNA.
- **I** is incorrect because DNAase would affect any DNA, regardless of the source.
- **J** is incorrect because the question specifies RNA viruses, which do not have DNA.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
