Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: P(A) is 0.8, P(B) is 0.5, and P(A union B) is 0.9. I need to find P(A intersection B). The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that there's a formula involving probabilities of unions and intersections. Oh right, the inclusion-exclusion principle! The formula is P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). 

So wait, that formula makes sense because if I just add P(A) and P(B), I'm double-counting the overlap, which is the intersection. So subtracting P(A ∩ B) corrects for that duplication.

Alright, let's plug in the numbers. We know P(A ∪ B) is 0.9, P(A) is 0.8, and P(B) is 0.5. So substituting into the formula:

0.9 = 0.8 + 0.5 - P(A ∩ B)

Let me do the math. 0.8 plus 0.5 is 1.3. So:

0.9 = 1.3 - P(A ∩ B)

To find P(A ∩ B), I can rearrange this. Subtract 0.9 from both sides:

Wait, no, maybe I should move P(A ∩ B) to one side. Let me think again.

From 0.9 = 1.3 - P(A ∩ B), I can subtract 1.3 from both sides:

0.9 - 1.3 = - P(A ∩ B)

That gives me -0.4 = - P(A ∩ B). Oh wait, multiplying both sides by -1, I get 0.4 = P(A ∩ B).

So P(A ∩ B) is 0.4. Looking at the options, that's option G.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation. 0.8 plus 0.5 is 1.3. 1.3 minus 0.9 is 0.4. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be G: 0.4.

To solve the problem, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle for probabilities, which states:

\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\]

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(A \cup B) = 0.9 \)

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[
0.9 = 0.8 + 0.5 - P(A \cap B)
\]

Simplify:

\[
0.9 = 1.3 - P(A \cap B)
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( P(A \cap B) \):

\[
P(A \cap B) = 1.3 - 0.9 = 0.4
\]

Thus, the probability of \( A \cap B \) is 0.4, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
