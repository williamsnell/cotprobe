Question:

A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Migraine with aura
B: Bacterial meningitis
C: Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis
D: Herpes simplex encephalitis
E: Influenza encephalopathy
F: Dextromethorphan intoxication
G: Viral meningitis
H: HIV encephalopathy
I: Lyme disease
J: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I need to figure out the correct diagnosis based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.

The patient is a 22-year-old college student who had a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had trouble thinking of words. She's been having a headache, cough, and fever for three days and was taking acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temp is 38.9°C, which is pretty high. 

On neurological exam, she's got diffuse hyperreflexia. Mentally, she's confused with short-term memory issues, difficulty naming objects, and making literal paraphasic errors. So her speech is affected, maybe aphasia. The MRI shows bitemporal hyperintensities—that's both temporal lobes lighting up, which is a key point. The lumbar puncture results are a bit tricky: high erythrocytes (340/mm3), leukocytes 121 with 88% monocytes, and protein of 78 mg/dL.

Let me think about what each of these findings mean. Bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI are often associated with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). I remember that HSE has a predilection for the temporal lobes. Also, the patient presented with a seizure, which is common in HSE.

Looking at the CSF analysis: a high erythrocyte count suggests some bleeding, but in the context of HSE, it's more about inflammation. The leukocytes are elevated but not extremely high. The presence of monocytes might indicate a viral etiology since bacterial infections often have more neutrophils. The protein is a bit elevated, which is consistent with infection or inflammation.

Other possibilities: bacterial meningitis usually presents with higher fever, more severe symptoms, and CSF showing high neutrophils. The patient here has monocytes dominant, so that's less likely bacterial. Viral meningitis typically has a lymphocytic predominance, but the numbers here are a bit high for that. Also, HSE tends to have some red blood cells in CSF because of the necrotizing nature of the infection.

Her symptoms after the seizure—aphasia and confusion—point towards temporal lobe involvement. The difficulty naming objects (anomia) and paraphasic errors suggest expressive aphasia, which is linked to frontal lobe issues, but the MRI shows temporal lobe changes, so maybe it's Wernicke's aphasia, which is temporal. Wait, but Wernicke's is receptive, and this is more expressive. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Or perhaps the hyperintensities are in the dominant temporal lobe, leading to language issues.

Another thought: could it be dextromethorphan intoxication? She was taking that. Dextromethorphan can cause altered mental status, but I don't think it would cause seizures or the MRI findings. So probably not F.

Migraine with aura could cause neurological symptoms, but the fever and CSF findings don't fit. So A is unlikely.

Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis (option C) is a possibility, but I think HSE is more common and has the temporal lobe findings. Also, the CSF in EBV might show similar features, but the MRI is a big clue here.

HIV encephalopathy (H) is another thought, but she's otherwise healthy, and the presentation is acute. HIV usually has a more chronic course unless it's an acute infection, but the MRI and symptoms point more to HSE.

Influenza encephalopathy (E) could cause similar symptoms but again, the MRI and CSF would be different. I don't recall bitemporal hyperintensities being a hallmark of that.

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is usually post-infectious or post-vaccination, with multifocal lesions, often after a viral infection. It can present with seizures, but the MRI in ADEM is typically more widespread, involving white matter and not just temporal lobes.

Lyme disease (I) can cause neurological issues, but it's more associated with meningitis and sometimes encephalopathy, but the MRI findings wouldn't typically be bitemporal.

So putting it all together: the MRI showing bitemporal hyperintensities is a strong indicator for HSE. The CSF has a moderate leukocyte count with monocytes, some RBCs, and elevated protein, which aligns with viral encephalitis, particularly HSE. Her symptoms after the seizure, like aphasia and confusion, also fit.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Herpes simplex encephalitis, which is option D.

The patient is a 22-year-old college student who presented with a seizure, followed by confusion, difficulty thinking of words, and short-term memory deficits. She had been experiencing headache, cough, and fever for three days, treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature was 38.9°C (102°F), and neurological examination revealed diffuse hyperreflexia. Mental status examination showed confusion, short-term memory deficits, difficulty naming objects, and literal paraphasic errors. MRI of the brain demonstrated bitemporal hyperintensities, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an erythrocyte count of 340/mm³, a leukocyte count of 121/mm³ (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL.

Key findings pointing to the diagnosis include the bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI, which are characteristic of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). The CSF analysis, showing a moderate leukocytosis with a predominance of monocytes, elevated protein, and the presence of erythrocytes, is consistent with a viral encephalitis, particularly HSE. The patient's symptoms, such as aphasia and confusion, also align with temporal lobe involvement, which is typical in HSE. Other considerations, such as bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, dextromethorphan intoxication, migraine with aura, Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis, influenza encephalopathy, HIV encephalopathy, Lyme disease, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), were ruled out based on the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and CSF results.

The most likely diagnosis is **Herpes simplex encephalitis**.
