Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a sand bag's mass and weight on Earth and then on another planet with half the gravity. Hmm, I remember that mass and weight are related but different concepts.

Wait, right. Mass is the amount of matter in an object, and it stays the same no matter where you are in the universe. So if the sand bag is 5kg on Earth, it should still be 5kg on any other planet because mass doesn't change. That part I think I got.

Weight, on the other hand, depends on gravity. Oh right, because weight is the force exerted by gravity on the mass. The formula is weight = mass × gravity. On Earth, the gravity is about 9.8 m/s², so the sand bag's weight is 50N. Oh wait, let me double-check that. If mass is 5kg and weight is 50N, then the gravity would be 50N / 5kg = 10 m/s². Oh, maybe they rounded it for simplicity.

So the planet has half the gravity of Earth. That means its gravity is 5 m/s². So the weight on that planet would be mass times this new gravity. The mass is still 5kg, so 5kg * 5 m/s² = 25N. So the weight should be 25N.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: Mass 5kg, weight 25N. That fits what I calculated.

Option I: Mass 5kg, weight 10N. Wait, why would that be? Oh wait, if half of Earth's gravity is 4.9 m/s², half of that would be about 4.9/2 = 2.45, so 5 * 2.45 is around 12.25N. But the given weight on Earth is 50N, so their Earth gravity is 10 m/s². So half of that is 5, so 5*5=25N. So Option B is correct.

Other options: Option H says weight remains 50N, which would be if the gravity didn't change. But the planet has less gravity, so that's not possible. Option I suggests 10N, but that would be if the gravity was 2 m/s², which isn't the case here. So I think the correct answer is B.

The sand bag has a mass of 5kg on Earth, and its weight is 50N. Mass remains constant regardless of location, so the sand bag will still have a mass of 5kg on the other planet. Weight, however, depends on gravity, and the planet has half the gravity of Earth. Since the Earth's gravity is approximately 10 m/s² (calculated from weight = mass × gravity: 50N ÷ 5kg = 10 m/s²), the planet's gravity is 5 m/s². 

Using the formula for weight (weight = mass × gravity), the sand bag's weight on the planet will be 5kg × 5 m/s² = 25N. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: Mass 5kg, weight 25N.
