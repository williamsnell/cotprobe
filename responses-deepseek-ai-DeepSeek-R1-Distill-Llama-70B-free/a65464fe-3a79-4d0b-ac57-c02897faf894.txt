Question:

A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

Options:

A: Bronchoscopy
B: Examination of sputum for eosinophils
C: Sputum cytology
D: Sweat chloride test
E: Chest CT scan
F: Echocardiogram
G: Spirometry repeat test
H: Tuberculin skin test
I: Complete blood count
J: Arterial blood gas analysis

Okay, so I've got this medical question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The patient is a 20-year-old man with frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past four years. He's got daily purulent sputum and decreased exercise tolerance for two years. Also, he and his wife are having trouble conceiving because of his low sperm count. On exam, there's scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi in both lungs. Chest X-ray shows hyperinflation, and spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio.

Hmm, let's break this down. The symptoms like frequent upper respiratory infections and purulent sputum make me think of a chronic respiratory condition. The decreased exercise tolerance could be due to lung disease affecting oxygenation or air flow. Low sperm count and infertility in a young man might hint at an underlying condition affecting his reproductive system, possibly something genetic or a systemic disease.

The physical exam findings—wheezing and rhonchi—are typical for obstructive lung diseases. The chest X-ray showing hyperinflation usually points towards conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. But wait, the spirometry result is a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio, which is characteristic of obstructive lung diseases because it indicates airway obstruction.

Now, the main possibilities I'm considering are asthma, COPD, or maybe something like cystic fibrosis (CF). But wait, CF is usually diagnosed in childhood, though some cases are diagnosed later. But he's 20, so maybe. Let me think about the clues.

CF is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. It leads to thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways, causing recurrent infections and lung damage. It also causes pancreatic insufficiency and, in males, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, leading to infertility. That fits with his low sperm count and inability to conceive.

So the patient's presentation aligns with CF. But how do we confirm that? The question is asking which test would confirm the diagnosis.

The options are A through J. Let's go through them.

A: Bronchoscopy. That can show airway abnormalities, maybe, but not specifically diagnose CF.

B: Examination of sputum for eosinophils. Eosinophils are more for allergic conditions like asthma. CF sputum would have more neutrophils, I think.

C: Sputum cytology. Not sure, but I don't think this is the main test for CF.

D: Sweat chloride test. Oh right, the sweat test is the standard diagnostic test for CF. High chloride levels in sweat are diagnostic.

E: Chest CT scan. Might show bronchiectasis or other structural changes, but not confirm CF specifically.

F: Echocardiogram. Could check for cor pulmonale if there's severe lung disease, but not the primary test.

G: Spirometry repeat. He already had abnormal spirometry, so repeating might not add much. It helps assess obstruction but not diagnose CF.

H: Tuberculin skin test. For tuberculosis, which isn't indicated here.

I: Complete blood count. Might show signs of infection or anemia, but not specific.

J: Arterial blood gas. Could show hypoxemia or hypercapnia, but again, not specific.

So the key here is that the sweat chloride test is the gold standard for diagnosing cystic fibrosis. The patient's symptoms (respiratory issues, infertility, malnutrition maybe) and spirometry results pointing to obstructive lung disease, along with the other signs, make CF the likely diagnosis. The confirming test would be the sweat chloride test.

The patient is a 20-year-old man with a history of frequent upper respiratory tract infections, daily purulent sputum, and decreased exercise tolerance. He also has infertility due to a low sperm count. Physical exam reveals scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi, and imaging shows hyperinflation of the lungs. Spirometry indicates a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio, suggestive of obstructive lung disease. 

The combination of chronic respiratory symptoms, infertility, and obstructive lung disease strongly suggests cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by thick, sticky mucus affecting the respiratory and reproductive systems. CF often leads to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens in males, causing infertility. The gold standard diagnostic test for CF is the sweat chloride test, which detects elevated chloride levels in sweat, confirming the diagnosis.

Among the options provided, the sweat chloride test (Option D) is the most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
