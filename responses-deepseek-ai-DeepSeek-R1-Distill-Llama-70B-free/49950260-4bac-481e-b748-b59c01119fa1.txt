Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the diameter of a steel column. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The column is fixed at both ends and has a repeated axial load of 15,000 lb. The length is 29 inches. The design stress is 8,500 psi, elastic limit is 47,000 psi, and modulus of elasticity is 30e6 psi.

Wait, I think I need to use the Euler formula for columns. Euler's formula is for slender columns under axial loads, right? It's used to find the critical load where the column will start to buckle. The formula is something like P = (π² E I) / (L²), where P is the critical load, E is modulus of elasticity, I is the moment of inertia, and L is the length.

But wait, in this problem, the column is subjected to a repeated axial load, so maybe I should consider the allowable stress. Oh right, the design stress is given as 8,500 psi, which is probably the maximum allowable stress we can use here.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Are we supposed to calculate the diameter based on the Euler critical load or based on the allowable stress? Let me think. Since the load is repeated, maybe we're dealing with fatigue, but perhaps the design stress is what's important here. Oh, right, because the design stress would take into account the factor of safety and the material's properties.

Wait, but Euler's formula is about the critical load, which relates to the maximum load before buckling. However, the problem gives a specific applied load, so maybe we need to ensure that the column doesn't buckle under that load. So perhaps we'll compare the applied load to the critical load.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Since it's a short column with fixed ends, maybe it's a matter of the stress being within the allowable limit. Oh wait, but for columns, both stress and buckling are considerations. But with fixed ends, the critical load formula would apply.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Determine if the column is a short or long column. Short columns fail by crushing, long columns by buckling. The slenderness ratio determines this.

2. The slenderness ratio (S) is given by L/r, where L is the effective length and r is the radius of gyration. For a circular column, r is d/(4√(3/π)) or something like that. Wait, more accurately for a solid circular rod, the radius of gyration r = d/(4) * sqrt( (π/ (A) ) * I ), but maybe I need to think about it differently.

Wait, maybe I can approach this using Euler's formula. Let me write down the variables:

P = applied load = 15,000 lb
L = length = 29 inches
E = 30e6 psi
Design stress σ_allow = 8,500 psi

First, I need to find the diameter such that the column doesn't buckle under this load, and the stress doesn't exceed the allowable.

But wait, Euler's formula gives the critical load that would cause buckling. So if the applied load is less than the critical load, the column is safe.

So, the critical load P_crit = (π² E I) / (L²)

We can rearrange this to solve for I: I = (P_crit * L²) / (π² E)

But I don't have P_crit. Alternatively, since we have the applied load P, we can set P <= P_crit. But I'm not sure. Or perhaps the problem is about finding the diameter such that the stress due to the load and the buckling are both within limits.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more about the stress due to the load. The stress σ is P/A, where A is the cross-sectional area. So if σ_allow is 8,500 psi, then A = P / σ_allow.

Let me compute that:

P = 15,000 lb. So A = 15,000 / 8,500 = approximately 1.7647 in².

Then, since A = π d² / 4, solving for d would give the diameter.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me calculate that.

A = π d² /4 = 1.7647

So d² = (1.7647 *4 ) / π ≈ (7.0588) / 3.1416 ≈ 2.25

So d ≈ sqrt(2.25) = 1.5 inches.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 1.5. Let me check the options again. Option I is 2.25, which is area-wise, but that's the area. Wait, no, option I is 2.25 in diameter. Hmm, but wait, my calculation gives 1.5 inches. Let me see the options — option J is 1.54 in, which is close. Or maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me compute A again.

A = P / σ_allow = 15000 / 8500 = 1.7647 in².

So d² = (4 A) / π = (4 * 1.7647) / 3.1416 ≈ 7.0588 / 3.1416 ≈ 2.25.

So d = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5 inches.

But looking at the options, none of them is 1.5. Let's see the options again.

Options:

A: 1.9375 in

B: 0.40625 in

C:3.14 in

D: 0.3125 in

E:71.38 in

F:0.785 in

G:2.875 in

H:1 (5/8) → 1.625 in

I:2.25 in

J:1.54 in

Hmm, so 1.5 isn't an option. The closest is option J at 1.54 or H at 1.625.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because perhaps the problem is not just about the stress but also about the critical load due to buckling. So perhaps the diameter must be such that both the stress is within allowable and the critical load is higher than the applied load.

So maybe I need to compute using Euler's formula as well.

Let me try that. Let me calculate the critical load and see if the applied load is less than that.

Wait, but to compute the critical load, I need to know the moment of inertia I for a circular rod. For a solid rod, I = π d^4 / 64. The radius of gyration r is sqrt(I/A) = sqrt( (π d^4 /64 ) / (π d²/4) ) ) = sqrt( d² / 16 ) ) = d/4.

So the slenderness ratio is L / r = L / (d/4) = 4L / d.

Wait, I think I need to compute the critical load using Euler's formula:

P_crit = (π² E I) / (L²)

But I can substitute I for a solid rod.

I = (π d^4)/64

So,

P_crit = (π² E * (π d^4 /64 )) / (L² )

Simplify:

P_crit = ( π³ E d^4 ) / (64 L² )

But wait, I'm not sure if I need to include the end conditions. For fixed ends, the effective length is L, so the formula is correct.

Now, I want the applied load P (15,000 lb) to be less than or equal to P_crit.

So,

15,000 <= ( π³ E d^4 ) / (64 L² )

We can solve for d.

Let me plug in the numbers:

E = 30e6 psi

L = 29 in.

So,

15,000 = ( π³ * 30e6 * d^4 ) / (64 * 29² )

Wait, but wait, no. The inequality is P <= P_crit, so rearrange for d.

Let me rearrange:

d^4 = (15,000 * 64 * 29² ) / ( π³ * 30e6 )

Compute numerator: 15,000 * 64 * (29)^2

15,000 = 1.5e4

29^2 = 841

So numerator = 1.5e4 * 64 * 841

Compute step by step:

1.5e4 * 64 = 1.5 * 64 * 1e4 = 96 * 1e4 = 9.6e5

9.6e5 * 841 = Let's compute 9.6e5 * 800 = 7.68e8, and 9.6e5 * 41= 3.936e7 → total 7.68e8 + 3.936e7 = 8.0736e8.

Denominator: π³ * 30e6 ≈ (31.006) * 3e7 → 31.006 * 3e7 ≈ 9.3018e8

So d^4 = (8.0736e8) / (9.3018e8) ) → approximately 0.8677

So d = (0.8677)^(1/4) → Let's compute. 0.8677^(1/4) is about sqrt(sqrt(0.8677)).

sqrt(0.8677) ≈ 0.9318

sqrt(0.9318) ≈ 0.9655

So d ≈ 0.9655 inches.

Wait, that's about 0.9655 inches, which is approximately 0.97 in. Looking at the options, option F is 0.785 in, option B is 0.406, D is 0.3125, and J is 1.54. None match 0.97, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider both the stress and the critical load.

Wait, earlier when I calculated using stress alone, I got d = 1.5 in, but that's not an option. The options have 1.54 (J), 1.9375 (A), 1.625 (H), etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check whether the column is a short or long column. The slenderness ratio can help determine this.

The slenderness ratio (S) for a circular column is L/r, where r is the radius of gyration. For a solid rod, r = d/4.

So, S = L/(d/4) = 4L/d.

If S is less than a certain value (like 50 for steel), the column is considered short, and the failure is due to crushing. If S is higher, it's a long column, and Euler's formula applies.

But for this, I'm not sure what the transition slenderness ratio is. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use Euler's formula regardless.

Wait, but in the first approach, using stress alone gave me d=1.5 in, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that the stress doesn't exceed the design stress, and that the column doesn't buckle.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to find the minimum diameter that satisfies both conditions.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only concerned with the stress. Let me see the problem statement again. It says, "Compute the diameter for a steel column fixed at both ends and subjected to a repeated axial load of 15,000 lb." The design stress is given, so perhaps the approach is to compute the area based on the allowable stress, then find the diameter from that.

So, A = P / σ_allow = 15000 /8500 = 1.7647 in².

Then, for a circular cross-section, A = π d² /4 → d² = (4 A)/π → d = sqrt(4A/π).

Plugging in A=1.7647:

4A ≈ 7.0588

7.0588 / π ≈ 2.25 → d = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5 in.

But none of the options match 1.5 in. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the formula.

Wait, wait. Maybe the formula I used for the radius of gyration is incorrect, leading me to the wrong slenderness ratio. Alternatively, maybe I should use Euler's formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a combination of stress and Euler's critical load. Let me think again.

The applied load is 15,000 lb. The stress induced by this load is σ = P/A = 15,000 / A. This must be less than or equal to the design stress of 8,500 psi. So A must be >= 15000 /8500 = 1.7647 in².

But also, the column must not buckle. So the Euler critical load must be greater than or equal to the applied load.

So, P_crit >= 15,000 lb.

So, substituting into Euler's formula:

(π² E I) / L² >= 15,000

I for a solid rod is π d^4 /64.

So,

(π² E (π d^4 /64 )) / L² >= 15,000

Let me plug in the numbers.

E = 30e6 psi

L =29 in.

So,

( π² * 30e6 * (π d^4 / 64) ) / (29^2) ) >= 15,000

Compute this:

Multiply numerator terms: π² * π = π³, 30e6 * d^4 /64.

So:

( π³ * 30e6 * d^4 ) / (64 * 29^2 ) ) >=15,000

Let me compute the denominator:

64 *29^2 = 64 *841 = 53736.64 (wait, 29^2 is 841, 841 *64 = let's compute: 800*64=51,200; 41*64=2,624 → total 53,824.)

So,

( π³ * 3e7 * d^4 ) / 5.3824e4 >=15,000

Wait, 30e6 is 3e7? No, 30e6 is 3e7? Wait, 30e6 is 3e7? Wait, 30 million is 3e7? No, wait, 1e7 is 10 million. 30 million is 3e7. Yes.

So, substituting:

( (31.006) * 3e7 * d^4 ) / 5.3824e4 >=15,000

Compute numerator: 31.006 *3e7 = 9.3018e8

So,

9.3018e8 * d^4 /5.3824e4 >=15,000

Compute 9.3018e8 /5.3824e4 ≈ 1.728e4.

So,

1.728e4 * d^4 >=15,000

→ d^4 >=15,000 /1.728e4 → 15,000 /17280 ≈ 0.8676

So d^4 ≈0.8676 → d = (0.8676)^(1/4) ≈ approx 0.9655 inches.

So about 0.9655 inches in diameter.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, but when I calculated based on stress, I got d=1.5 in. So perhaps the diameter must satisfy both conditions. So the maximum of the two diameters.

Wait, but if d=1.5 in, then what's the critical load?

Let me calculate P_crit when d=1.5 in.

I = π*(1.5)^4 /64

I = π*(5.0625)/64 ≈ (3.1416 *5.0625)/64 ≈ (15.902)/64 ≈ 0.2488 in^4.

Then,

P_crit = (π² E I ) / L².

So,

P_crit = ( (3.1416)^2 *30e6 *0.2488 ) / (29)^2

Compute numerator:

(9.8696) *3e7 *0.2488 → 9.8696 *3e7 ≈ 2.9609e8 → 2.9609e8 * 0.2488 ≈ 7.363e7.

Denominator: 841.

So P_crit ≈7.363e7 /841 ≈ 8.75e4 lb.

Which is 87,500 lb, which is way higher than the applied load of 15,000 lb. So using d=1.5 in from stress consideration gives a critical load much higher than the applied load, so it's safe.

But the options don't have 1.5, but option J is 1.54, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the stress approach again.

A = P / σ_allow = 15,000 /8,500 = 1.7647 in².

A = π d² /4 → d² = (4 *1.7647)/π → (7.0588)/3.1416 ≈2.25 → d=1.5 in.

So if that's correct, but 1.5 isn't an option. So maybe the correct approach is to use Euler's formula, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the allowable stress is lower than the Euler critical stress, so the diameter is determined by Euler's formula.

Wait, but in that case, the required d would be about 0.965 in, which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the diameter using both conditions and take the larger one. So if d=1.5 in satisfies the stress, but the Euler condition would allow a smaller d, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the stress condition. But since 1.5 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should use the formula for the critical stress, which is σ_crit = P_crit / A.

And σ_crit is also given by Euler's formula as (π² E) / (S²), where S is the slenderness ratio.

Wait, what's the formula for critical stress?

σ_crit = (π² E) / (S²)

Where S is slenderness ratio.

So, S = L/r.

For a solid rod, r = d/4.

So S = 4L/d.

So,

σ_crit = π² E (d/(4L))² → σ_crit = π² E d²/(16 L² )

We have σ_crit must be >= applied stress.

Applied stress is 8,500 psi.

So,

π² E d²/(16 L² ) >=
