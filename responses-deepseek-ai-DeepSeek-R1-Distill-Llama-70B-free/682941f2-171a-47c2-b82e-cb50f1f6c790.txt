Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two pairs of contrasting genes, A vs. a and B vs. b. They're looking at an F1 individual that was testcrossed, and the progeny phenotypes and numbers are given. The questions are about whether the genes are linked or independent, the amount of recombination if linked, and the genotypes of the original homozygous strains.

Hmm, I remember that linked genes are those located close together on the same chromosome, so they tend to be inherited together. Independent genes are on different chromosomes, so they assort independently during meiosis.

The testcross is between an F1 individual and a recessive parent. The expected phenotypic ratios can tell us about linkage. For independent genes, a dihybrid testcross should give a 1:1:1:1 ratio if the F1 is a dihybrid (like AaBb), but if the genes are linked, the ratio will be different, with more of the parental types and fewer of the recombinant types.

Looking at the data: the numbers are A B:621, A b:87, a B:92, a b:610. Let me add these up. 621 + 87 is 708, plus 92 is 800, plus 610 is 1410 total. Wait, no, 621 +87 is 708, plus 92 is 800? Wait 708 +92 is 800? Oh wait 708+92 is 800? No, 700+90 is 790, so 708+92 is 800. Oh wait, 708+92 is 800? Wait, 708 +92 is 800? Let me calculate: 708 + 92 is 800? 708 + 92: 700+90 is 790, 8+2 is 10, so 800? Oh yeah, that adds up. Then 800 +610 is 1410. So total progeny is 1410.

If the genes were independent, each testcross would produce 25% of each phenotype. So each expected number would be about 1410 * 0.25 = 352.5. But looking at the data, the numbers are 621, 87, 92, 610. So the A B and a b are much higher than 352, while A b and a B are lower.

Wait, that suggests that the parental types are more frequent than expected. So perhaps the genes are linked because the recombinant phenotypes (A b and a B) are fewer. Because in linked genes, you get more of the parental combinations.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the F1 is a dihybrid, say AaBb, and the testcross is with aabb (so aa bb?), then the expected phenotypic ratio if the genes are independent would be 1:1:1:1. But if the genes are linked, the ratio would have more of the AB and ab types because they are inherited together.

Wait, let me think again. In a testcross, the F1 is crossed with a homozygous recessive. So if F1 is AaBb and the other is aabb, then each gamete from AaBb would be AB, Ab, aB, ab, depending on recombination.

If the genes are independent, the gametes would be 25% each. So in the testcross, each phenotype would be 25% of the total. But in the data, AB is 621, which is about 43.9% (621/1410). Similarly, ab is 610, about 43.3%. And the recombinant types (Ab and aB) are 87 (6.17%) and 92 (6.52%) respectively. So combined, the recombinants are about 12.7%, which is much lower than the 25% expected for independent genes. So this suggests that the genes are linked because the parental types are more frequent than the recombinants.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have this backwards. If the genes are linked, the recombinant gametes (like Ab and aB) are less frequent because crossing over doesn't happen as often between them. So the majority of the gametes would be the same as the parental chromosomes. So the testcross progeny should have more of the AB and ab phenotypes and fewer of the others.

So let's sum up the recombinant phenotypes. The recombinant phenotypes are A b and a B. So their counts are 87 and 92, which add up to 179. Total progeny is 1410. So 179/1410 is approximately 0.1268 or 12.68% recombination. So this suggests that the genes are linked and that about 12.7% recombination occurred.

Wait, but wait, the recombination frequency calculation is based on the percentage of recombinant gametes. So recombinant gametes are those that have experienced crossing over between the two genes. So in the testcross, the number of recombinant phenotypes would be twice the recombination frequency, because each gamete from F1 would produce one of each. Hmm, no, actually, no. Because in a testcross, each gamete's type directly translates to the phenotype of the progeny.

Wait, the F1 is testcrossed with a recessive. So the F1's gametes determine the phenotype. So if F1 produces a certain percentage of AB, Ab, aB, ab gametes, the testcross progeny will have those same percentages. So the recombinant gametes are Ab and aB. So the sum of their frequencies is 87 +92 = 179. So 179/1410 is about 12.68% as I said earlier.

So that would mean that the recombination frequency is 12.68%, approximately 12.7%. So that's part (b) answered.

Now, for part (a), the genes are linked since the recombinant frequency is less than 50% (in fact, 12.7% is much less than 50%). Because if genes are independent, they would have about 25% each of the four phenotypes, but here the recombinant phenotypes are only about 12.7% combined.

So the first part of the question is that the genes are linked.

Now part (c): the question is about the genotypes of the original homozygous strains. So the original cross must have been between two homozygous parents. For example, perhaps one was AABB and the other aabb, or maybe something else.

Wait, the F1 is the result of crossing two homozygous strains. So let's think about possible homozygous parents. The F1 would be AaBb if the parents were AABB and aabb. Or perhaps they were AAbb and aaBB. Wait, what would that make the F1?

If the parents were AAbb and aaBB, the F1 would be AaBb. Similarly, if the parents were AABB and aabb, the F1 would be AaBb as well. So the F1 is AaBb, which is why the testcross would produce these phenotypic ratios.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, let's see what the options say. The options give possible genotypes for the original strains.

Looking at the options, for example, option I says the genes are linked, 12.7% recombination, and the original genotypes were ABab and ABab. Wait, that doesn't make sense because both parents being ABab would be impossible, as they are homozygous. Wait, no, the question says the original strains are homozygous. So each parent must be homozygous for both genes.

Wait, perhaps the original parents were something like AABB and aabb. Or maybe they were ABAB and abab? Wait, no, because homozygous would mean that each gene is homozygous. So for AABB, it's AA for gene A and BB for gene B. Similarly, aabb is aa and bb.

So when you cross AABB (homozygous) with aabb (homozygous), the F1 would be AaBb, which is what would produce the testcross we saw.

So the original parents were AABB and aabb, so their genotypes would be AABB and aabb.

Looking at the answer options, let's see which option matches these.

Option I: linked, 12.7% recombination, genotypes ABab and ABab. Wait, but ABab is AaBb, which is heterozygous, not homozygous. So that can't be the original parents because the original parents are homozygous. So option I is not correct.

Looking at other options:

Option H: linked, 12.7% recombination, genotypes ABab and aBAb. Wait, ABab would be AaBb, which is heterozygous, so again not homozygous. So that's not possible for the original parents.

Option E: linked, 15% recombination, genotypes ABab and ABab. Again, these are F1 genotypes, not homozygous parents.

Option F: linked, 9.8% recombination, genotypes ABab and aBAb. Again, same issue.

Option G: linked, 17.3% recombination, genotypes ABab and aBaB. Again, not homozygous.

Option I is linked, 12.7%, genotypes ABab and ABab. Again, same issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the original parents. Because if the F1 is AaBb, then the parents must have contributed A and a for each gene. So perhaps one parent was AA BB and the other aa bb. So their genotypes would be AABB and aabb.

Looking at the options, which one has the original genotypes as AABB and aabb? Let me check each option's part (c).

Option A: genotypes were ABab ABab → no, these are heterozygous.

Option B: genotypes were ABab aBAb → again, hetero.

Option C: genotypes were ABab aBaB → hetero.

Option D: genotypes were aBAb aBAb → that's homozygous as aBAb would have AA bb if it's homozygous? Wait, no, aBAb would be Aa Bb, which is heterozygous. So that can't be.

Option E: genotypes were ABab ABab → again, F1.

Option F: genotypes were ABab aBAb → both F1 types.

Option G: genotypes were ABab aBaB → same.

Option H: genotypes were ABab aBAb → same.

Option I: genotypes were ABab ABab → same.

Option J: genotypes were ABab ABab. Same issue.

Wait, none of the options have the original parents as homozygous AABB and aabb. That's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the original parents were not AABB and aabb, but instead, they were something else. Let me think again. Since the F1 is AaBb, which is heterozygous for both genes, the parents must have been homozygous for different alleles. So for gene A, one parent is AA and the other is aa. Similarly for gene B, one is BB and the other is bb.

So the possible combinations are:

Parent 1: AABB

Parent 2: aabb

Or

Parent 1: AA bb

Parent 2: aa BB

Wait, if the parents are AA bb and aa BB, then their F1 would be Aa Bb. But then, the arrangement of the genes on the chromosomes would affect linkage.

Wait, but the question is about the original strains being homozygous. So each parent is homozygous for both genes. So they must have both genes in homozygous state. So possibilities are AABB, AAbb, aaBB, aabb.

So if the parents are AABB and aabb, the F1 is AaBb.

If the parents are AAbb and aaBB, the F1 would be AaBb as well. Because each parent contributes A and a for gene A, and B and b for gene B.

Wait, but if the parents are AAbb and aaBB, then their gametes would be AB and ab for one parent, and aaBB would produce aB and aB? No, wait, AAbb would produce gametes AB and Ab. Hmm, no, let's correct that.

Wait, AAbb: for gene A, it's AA (homozygous), so gametes for gene A are A. For gene B, it's Bb (heterozygous), so gametes for B would be B and b in equal proportions. So the gametes from AAbb would be AB and Ab.

Similarly, aaBB: for gene A, aa (homozygous), so gamete a. For gene B, BB (homozygous), gamete B. So gametes are aB only.

Wait, then the cross between AAbb (producing AB and Ab) and aaBB (producing aB) would give F1 as:

AB (from AAbb) + aB (from aaBB) → AaBb.

Ab (from AAbb) + aB (from aaBB) → Aabb (Aa bb).

So the F1 would be a mix of AaBb and Aabb? Wait, no, because each parent produces gametes in certain proportions. Wait, no, in a cross between AAbb and aaBB, what's the F1?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think clearly.

Parent 1: AAbb → Genotype for gene A is AA (homozygous), gene B is Bb (heterozygous). So gametes for gene A: all A. For gene B: B and b, each 50%. So gametes are AB (50%) and Ab (50%).

Parent 2: aaBB → Genotype for gene A is aa (homozygous), so gametes for A: a. For gene B: BB (homozygous), so gametes for B: B.

So the gametes from parent 2 are aB (100%).

So the F1 would result from the combination of parent 1's gametes and parent 2's gametes.

So possible offspring genotypes:

From parent 1's AB + parent 2's aB → Aa BB (since A from AB and a from aB) → phenotype A B.

From parent 1's Ab + parent 2's aB → Aa Bb (A from Ab and a from aB; B from Ab and B from aB → Bb).

Wait, but that would mean that 50% of the F1 are AaBB and 50% are AaBb. So the F1 wouldn't be all AaBb. So perhaps the parents were AABB and aabb instead.

If parents are AABB and aabb:

AABB is AA for gene A and BB for gene B. So gametes are AB only.

aabb is aa for gene A and bb for gene B. So gametes are ab only.

So the F1 would be AaBb, which is the dihybrid.

So in this case, the original parents would be AABB and aabb.

Now, looking back at the options, which option has the original genotypes as AABB and aabb?

Looking at the options:

Option I: genotypes ABab and ABab → no, those are AaBb.

Option H: genotypes ABab and aBAb → again, those are AaBb and AaBb.

Option E: genotypes ABab and ABab → same.

Option G: genotypes ABab and aBaB → same.

So perhaps none of the options have AABB and aabb as the original parents. Wait, but the options might be written differently. Let me read the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Genotypes ABab ABab → no.

Option B: ABab aBAb → no.

Option C: ABab aBaB → no.

Option D: aBAb aBAb → no, as that's AaBb and AaBb.

Option E: ABab ABab → no.

Option F: ABab aBAb → no.

Option G: ABab aBaB → no.

Option H: ABab aBAb → no.

Option I: ABab ABab → no.

Option J: ABab ABab → no.

Hmm, none of the options list the original parents as AABB and aabb. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation in the options. Let me read the options again.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different notation. The question states that the original parents are homozygous. So their genotypes must be homozygous for both traits. So for example, one could be AABB and the other aabb.

Looking at option I: genotypes ABab ABab → no, that's AaBb, which is heterozygous.

Wait, maybe the options have the original parents as ABAB and abab, but that can't be because then they wouldn't be homozygous. Because ABAB would be A A for gene A and B B for gene B, making it AABB, which is homozygous. Similarly, abab would be aa bb, which is homozygous.

Wait, perhaps in the options, the parents are written as ABAB and abab. But looking at the options, the genotypes are written as ABab, which might be a way of writing AABB or something else.

Wait, the notation in the options is a bit unclear. For example, option I says the genotypes were ABab and ABab. That would be AaBb, which is F1, not the original parents.

So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the original parents were ABAB and abab. Wait, ABAB would be A for both genes on one homolog and a for both on the other. No, that's not possible because each gene has its own alleles. Alternatively, perhaps ABAB is a notation for AABB, and abab is aabb. So maybe the options are using a different notation.

Wait, maybe the options are using "ABab" to denote AABB, but that doesn't make sense because ABab would imply AaBb. Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo in the genotypes.

Alternatively, perhaps the original parents were not AABB and aabb, but instead, one was AAbb and the other was aaBB.

Wait, if the parents were AAbb (AA bb) and
