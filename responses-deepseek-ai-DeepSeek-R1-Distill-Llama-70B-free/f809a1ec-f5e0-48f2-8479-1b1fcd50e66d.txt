Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this murder question. Let me go through it step by step. 

The situation is that the defendant was walking on a public street and got into a heated argument with a stranger. The stranger was singing and shouting obscenities near him. Then, the defendant pulled a large serrated hunting knife and stabbed the victim in the chest, killing him. He's charged with murder. His defense is that he only intended to scare the victim to shut him up and didn't intend to kill.

Hmm, I remember that murder typically requires malice aforethought, which can be either intent to kill or intent to cause serious bodily harm, or acting with extreme recklessness. So, even if he didn't specifically want to kill, if using a deadly weapon in a way that's likely to cause death, that could count as murder.

The defendant used a large serrated hunting knife and stabbed the victim in the chest. That sounds pretty deadly. I think using a deadly weapon in that manner shows an intent to kill or at least cause serious harm. Because even if he says he just wanted to scare, the action itself is so dangerous that it implies the necessary intent.

Looking at the options, option A says yes because the use of a deadly weapon shows intent to kill. Option H says yes because intending to scare with a deadly weapon is enough. Wait, isn't intent to scare not enough, but the act of using a deadly weapon in a deadly way can imply the intent.

I think the key here is that even if he didn't have premeditation, the act of using a deadly weapon can demonstrate the requisite intent. So, the defendant's action with the knife would indicate that he intended to kill or cause serious harm, fulfilling the malice requirement for murder.

So, the correct answer would be A. Because using a deadly weapon in this way shows the intent necessary for murder, regardless of whether he claims he just wanted to scare the victim.

The defendant's use of a large serrated hunting knife to stab the victim in the chest constitutes the use of a deadly weapon, which demonstrates the requisite intent to kill or cause serious bodily harm necessary for murder. Despite the defendant's claim that he only intended to scare the victim, the nature of the act implies malice aforethought. 

Answer: A
