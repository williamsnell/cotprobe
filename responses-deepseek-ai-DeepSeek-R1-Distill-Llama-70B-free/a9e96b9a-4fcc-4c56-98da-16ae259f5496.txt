Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Suppose Q is a measure of output, K is a measure of capital stock in use, and L is a measure of the size of the employed labor force. Q =AK^\betaL^\gamma is a much used form of production function. When \beta + \gamma = 1, it is known as a Cobb-Douglas production function. This function has many convenient properties: Marginal products of both labor and capital are positive if \beta and \gamma are. If \beta + \gamma = 1, the function has constant returns to scale. That is, if both inputs are increased in like proportion, output will increase in that same proportion. A doubling of both inputs, for example, will result in doubled output. Discuss how the concept of linear regression might be applied to estimate \beta and \gamma .

Options:

A: Polynomial regression
B: Linear progression
C: Quantile regression
D: Ridge regression
E: Logistic regression
F: Exponential regression
G: Lasso regression
H: Multiple regression
I: Single regression
J: Non-linear regression

Okay, so I have this question about production functions and how to estimate the parameters using linear regression. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me a production function Q = A K^β L^γ. I remember that when β + γ equals 1, it's a Cobb-Douglas function with constant returns to scale. But the main point here is about estimating β and γ using linear regression.

Wait, how do you even apply linear regression to this? Because the equation isn't linear in terms of β and γ. It's multiplicative with exponents. So maybe I need to transform it into a linear form.

Right, I think taking the natural logarithm of both sides would help. If I do that, ln(Q) = ln(A) + β ln(K) + γ ln(L). Oh, that makes sense because the logarithm turns exponents into multipliers. So now the equation is linear in terms of ln(K) and ln(L).

In this transformed equation, the dependent variable is ln(Q), and the independent variables are ln(K) and ln(L). The coefficients β and γ are what we're trying to estimate. So this setup looks like a multiple regression model where we have more than one independent variable.

Looking at the options provided, the choices include various types of regression methods. The correct approach here is multiple regression because we're using two predictors (ln(K) and ln(L)) to predict ln(Q). So the answer should be multiple regression.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question is about linear regression application, so the key is that after the log transformation, the model becomes linear. So yes, multiple regression is the tool here because we have two variables (K and L) affecting Q, even after logs.

I don't think it's single regression because that would only involve one independent variable. Polynomial or nonlinear regression doesn't fit because the transformed model is linear. The other options like logistic or quantile regression don't apply here since we're dealing with a standard least squares scenario.

So the correct answer should be H: Multiple regression.

To estimate the parameters β and γ in the Cobb-Douglas production function \( Q = A K^\beta L^\gamma \), we can apply linear regression by transforming the equation. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:

\[
\ln(Q) = \ln(A) + \beta \ln(K) + \gamma \ln(L).
\]

This transformation linearizes the equation, making it suitable for linear regression analysis. In this form, the dependent variable is \( \ln(Q) \), and the independent variables are \( \ln(K) \) and \( \ln(L) \). The coefficients \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) can then be estimated using **multiple regression**, as there are two independent variables.

Among the given options, multiple regression is the correct choice because it involves more than one independent variable. Other options, such as single regression, polynomial regression, or nonlinear regression, do not fit this scenario. Logistic or quantile regression are also inappropriate here, as this is a standard least squares regression problem.

The correct answer is **H: Multiple regression**.
