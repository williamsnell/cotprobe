Okay, I need to figure out which condition is characteristic of an oligopoly. Hmm, I remember that oligopoly is a market structure where there are a few firms producing a product. So, the key here is to understand how these firms behave towards each other.

I think in oligopoly, the actions of one firm can significantly affect the others. So, the firms are interdependent. That makes sense because with few players, each decision impacts the market and competitors. So, they probably watch each other closely.

Looking at the options, let's analyze each one. 

Option A says rival firms act independently. Wait, no, in oligopoly, they don't act independently because their decisions affect each other. So A might not be correct.

Option B says they never interact or influence each other's prices. That doesn't sound right either. In an oligopoly, they do influence each other's prices because there's mutual dependence.

Option C: A rival matches price decreases but not increases. Oh, wait, I think I remember something about price leadership. Like, if one firm lowers the price, others follow to maintain market share. But if a firm raises the price, others might not follow because they don't want to lose customers. So C says they match decreases but not increases. That sounds familiar, maybe that's a characteristic.

Option D: Always undercuts regardless of changes. That might be more like perfect competition, where firms try to undercut each other constantly. But in oligopoly, there's more strategic behavior, perhaps through collusion or following a leader.

Option E: Matches increases but not decreases. That's the opposite of C. So if a firm raises prices, others follow, but if they lower, others don't. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Usually, lowering prices is quickly matched because firms don't want to lose sales. So maybe E isn't correct.

Option F: Matches both increases and decreases. That would mean they always follow each other's pricing. But I don't think that's always the case. Like, maybe only certain changes are followed.

Option G: Fails to match both. That can't be right because in oligopoly, they do watch each other.

Option H: Always collude. Not necessarily always. While collusion can occur in oligopolies, it's not a defining characteristic. Plus, collusion is often illegal, so firms might not always do it.

Option I: Matches decreases but exceeds increases. So, if a rival increases, they go even higher. That doesn't sound like standard behavior. Usually, if a leader raises prices, others might follow but not surpass.

Option J: Same production costs. I don't think that's a necessary condition. Firms can have different costs and still be in an oligopoly.

Wait, so going back, the key point is how firms react to price changes. In an oligopoly, when a leading firm lowers prices, others tend to follow to avoid losing market share. But when a firm raises prices, others might not follow if they think demand is inelastic or if they can capture more market share by keeping prices lower.

So, looking at the options again, option C says a rival matches price decreases but not increases. That aligns with what I was thinking. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I also remember something called the kinked demand curve. In oligopolies, firms face a kinked demand curve because if they raise prices, others won't follow, but if they lower prices, others will. So that supports option C.

Yes, that's right. So the condition where a rival matches price decreases but doesn't match increases is characteristic of oligopoly. So the correct choice is C.

In an oligopoly, firms are interdependent, meaning the actions of one firm significantly influence others. This interdependence leads to specific behaviors, particularly in how firms respond to price changes. A key characteristic is that when a leading firm lowers its prices, other firms typically follow to maintain market share. However, when a firm raises its prices, others may not follow, as they might gain market share by keeping their prices lower. This behavior aligns with the concept of the kinked demand curve, where firms match price decreases but not increases.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, G, H, I, J**: These do not align with the defining characteristics of oligopoly.
- **E, F**: These describe behaviors opposite to or inconsistent with the typical price responses in oligopoly.
- **C**: Correctly describes the behavior where firms match price decreases but not increases, which is characteristic of oligopoly.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
