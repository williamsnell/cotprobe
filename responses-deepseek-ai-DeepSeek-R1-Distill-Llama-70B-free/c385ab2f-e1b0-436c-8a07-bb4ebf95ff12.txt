Question:

A landlord is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land on which is situated a large office building. The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions"(1) The tenant covenants to keep the building on the leased premises insured against fire in the amount of $100,000. "After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to a doctor, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the doctor assigned his leasehold interest to a dentist. The dentist went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. Soon afterwards, a fire spread from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building thereon. While the tenant was in possession of the leased property, he carried a fire insurance policy on the premises in the amount of $100,000. However, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after his assignment to the doctor. The doctor did carry insurance on the leased building, but only in the amount of $50,000. When the dentist took possession of the building, he did not obtain any fire insurance. The landlord learned that the building was not insured at the time of the fire as per the original agreement. In an action by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the fire loss, the landlord will most probably

Options:

A: recover, because the fire spread from an adjoining building, making the owner of that building responsible for the damage.
B: not recover, because the covenant to provide fire insurance did not run with the land.
C: recover, because in accordance with the Rule in Spencer's Case, the covenant to maintain fire insurance would "touch and concern" the land.
D: not recover, because the dentist, as assignee, would be liable for the fire loss.
E: not recover, because the doctor had partially fulfilled the obligation by providing insurance coverage of $50,000.
F: not recover, because the tenant had fulfilled his obligation by maintaining insurance during his possession of the property.
G: recover, because the dentist took possession of the property without obtaining any fire insurance.
H: recover, because the tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance did not terminate after his assignment to the doctor.
I: recover, because the dentist failed to pay rent, which technically broke the lease agreement.
J: not recover, because the tenant no longer had control over the property after his assignment to the doctor.

Okay, so I have this landlord-tenant law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The setup is that a landlord owns a tract of land with a large office building. He leased it to a tenant for seven years, from August 1, 2001, to July 31, 2008. The lease says the tenant must keep the building insured against fire for $100,000. 

Then, after three years (so around 2004), the tenant assigns the rest of the lease to a doctor, who takes possession. Later, in 2005, the doctor assigns his interest to a dentist. The dentist moves in but doesn't pay rent for two months. Then, a fire from a neighboring building destroys the leased property. 

Now, the insurance details: while the original tenant was in possession, he had a $100k policy, but he let it lapse after assigning to the doctor. The doctor had $50k insurance. The dentist didn't get any insurance. The landlord sues the tenant for the fire loss.

The question is, will the landlord recover from the tenant?

So, the issue here is about the enforceability of the covenant to insure after assignments. I remember that lease covenants can be enforceable against assignees, but it depends on whether they "run with the land." For a covenant to run with the land, it must "touch and concern" the land, and other requirements like horizontal privity for the burden and benefit.

In this case, the original lease had the tenant covenant to insure. The tenant assigned the lease to the doctor, then the doctor to the dentist. The question is whether the tenant is still liable for the dentist's failure to insure.

I think the key is whether the covenant to insure runs with the land. If it does, then each subsequent assignee (doctor and dentist) would be bound by it. If not, then the tenant might not be liable.

Wait, but the tenant was the original covenantor. So, if the covenant runs, the assignees are responsible, but sometimes the original tenant might still be liable if the covenant is a personal one. Or perhaps the tenant remains liable because when you assign a lease, you're not necessarily released from the original obligations unless the landlord agrees.

Wait, in landlord-tenant law, when a tenant assigns the lease, the assignee takes on the obligations, but the original tenant usually remains liable unless there's a novation (which requires landlord's consent). So, in this case, the tenant assigned to the doctor, and then the doctor assigned to the dentist. The landlord might have a claim against all of them, but the question is whether the tenant's obligation ended when he assigned.

But the lease covenant requires the tenant to keep the building insured. If the tenant assigned the lease, does that obligation transfer? Or does the tenant's obligation end when he assigns?

I think the covenant in the lease is a promise by the tenant. If the tenant assigns, the assignee (doctor) becomes responsible. But the original tenant is still liable on the original lease unless released. So the landlord could choose to sue any of them, but the question is whether the tenant is liable for the loss after he assigned.

In the scenario, the tenant let the insurance lapse after assigning to the doctor. But the doctor had $50k, which is less than required. The dentist didn't have any. So, the building was underinsured when the fire happened.

The landlord is suing the tenant. The tenant's defense would be that he's no longer in possession or responsible after assignment. But the lease might still hold him liable.

I remember the Rule in Spencer's Case, which relates to the assignment of leases. Spencer's Case says that if a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee is responsible for the covenants, but the original tenant remains liable unless the landlord releases them. So the landlord can sue either the assignor or assignee.

In this question, the covenant to insure is a covenant that "touches and concerns the land." Insurance is generally considered to touch and concern because it protects the landlord's interest in the property. So the covenant would run with the land, making the assignees (doctor and dentist) responsible.

But if the covenant runs, then the burden is on the assignee. But the problem is that the dentist didn't insure at all. So the landlord could go after the dentist, but the question is about suing the original tenant.

Wait, but the original tenant's obligation was to keep the building insured during the lease. Once he assigns, does that obligation continue? Or does it shift to the assignee?

I think the original tenant's obligation under the lease continues unless the landlord agrees to release him. So even after assignment, the tenant remains liable for the entire term. So if the dentist failed to insure, the landlord can still hold the tenant responsible because the tenant is still on the hook for the lease covenants.

So in this case, the landlord would probably recover from the tenant because the tenant's obligation didn't end with the assignment. The tenant is still liable for the lease terms.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Recover because covenant runs under Spencer's Case. Spencer's Case is about the assignee being liable, but the original tenant remains liable. So the landlord can recover from the tenant.

Option H: Recover because tenant's obligation didn't terminate after assignment. This seems correct.

Option J: Not recover because tenant no longer controlled the property. But I think the tenant is still liable regardless of control.

So between C and H. Option C refers to the covenant running, which makes the assignees liable, but the question is about suing the original tenant. So perhaps the better answer is H, which states the tenant's obligation didn't terminate upon assignment.

Wait, but the landlord is suing the tenant. The tenant's defense is that after assignment, he's not responsible. But under Spencer's Case, the tenant remains liable unless released. So the landlord can recover from the tenant.

So the correct answer is H.

The landlord is suing the tenant for the fire loss, and the key issue is whether the tenant remains liable for the covenant to insure after assigning the lease. The lease required the tenant to maintain fire insurance in the amount of $100,000. The tenant assigned the lease first to a doctor and then to a dentist. The dentist failed to obtain insurance, and the building was destroyed by a fire.

Under landlord-tenant law, when a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee becomes responsible for the covenants, but the original tenant typically remains liable unless the landlord agrees to release them. This is supported by the Rule in Spencer's Case, which holds that the original tenant remains liable for the lease covenants unless released by the landlord. The covenant to maintain fire insurance is considered to "touch and concern" the land, meaning it runs with the property and binds subsequent assignees. However, the tenant's obligation under the lease does not automatically terminate upon assignment.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The cause of the fire is irrelevant to the tenant's liability under the lease covenant.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The covenant to insure does run with the land as it touches and concerns the property.
- **Option C**: Partially correct but misleading. While the covenant runs with the land, the question focuses on the tenant's liability, not the assignees'.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The dentist's liability does not absolve the tenant, as the tenant remains liable under the lease unless released.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The doctor's partial insurance does not fulfill the tenant's obligation to maintain $100,000 in coverage.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The tenant's obligation to insure did not end when he assigned the lease.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The dentist's failure to insure does not directly address the tenant's ongoing liability.
- **Option H**: Correct. The tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance did not terminate upon assignment, making the tenant liable for the loss.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The dentist's failure to pay rent is irrelevant to the tenant's liability for the fire loss.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The tenant's lack of control over the property after assignment does not release them from liability under the lease.

The correct answer is **H**, as the tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance did not terminate after assigning the lease. 

Answer: H
