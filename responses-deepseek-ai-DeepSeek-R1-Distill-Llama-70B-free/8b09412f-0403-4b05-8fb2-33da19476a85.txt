Question:

A man owned land along the south side of a highway. To the south of the man's land was a lot owned by a woman who lived on it in a house. Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?

Options:

A: The man, because the easement was extinguished.
B: The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.
C: The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.
D: The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here about easements, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there's a man who owns land along the south side of a highway. South of his land is a lot owned by a woman who lives there. Five years ago, the man gave the woman a right-of-way easement over his land. The easement was clearly marked with a path and was recorded promptly. Then, three years ago, the woman sold her house to the man. But the man never actually moved in or took possession. Then, two years ago, the man sold the house to a purchaser with a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved in, a neighbor told him about the easement, and he started using the path. But when the man saw him using it, he put up a barricade. Now the purchaser is suing, claiming he has an easement.

The question is about who will likely prevailâ€”either the man (options A or B) or the purchaser (options C or D).

Hmm, I remember that easements can be appurtenant or in gross. An easement appurtenant benefits the owner of adjacent land (the dominant estate) and burdens another (the servient estate). For an easement to be appurtenant, the two properties must be adjacent or near enough that the easement makes sense. Also, when the easement is created, it's usually written and recorded.

Wait, but in this case, the man (let's call him M) gave the easement to the woman (W), who owned the land south of M. So M's land is the servient estate, and W's land is the dominant estate. The easement was for a right-of-way, which makes sense because it's a path from her house to the highway via M's land. So that seems like an easement appurtenant.

Now, when W sold her house to M three years ago, what happens to the easement? I think when the dominant estate (W's land) is sold, the easement goes with it, because it's appurtenant. So the new owner of W's land would be M. But M already owned the servient estate (his original land). Wait, that's an interesting point.

Wait, no. When W sells her land to M, M becomes the owner of both the dominant and servient estates? Because M already owned the servient estate (his land) and now he owns W's land (the dominant estate). So when the same person owns both estates, the easement is extinguished because there's unity of ownership. That's a key point. Because if the same person owns both, the easement doesn't need to exist anymore.

But wait, the man didn't take possession. Does that matter? I don't think so, because ownership is what determines the extinguishment, not possession. So if W sold her land to M, then M owns both, and the easement is extinguished. So when M later sold the house to the purchaser, he (M) no longer had an easement over his own land because the easement had already been extinguished when he acquired W's land.

Wait, but the easement was recorded. So when the purchaser bought the house from M, would he get the benefit of the easement? Or was the easement already gone?

Because when the easement was created, it was appurtenant to W's land. So when W sold her land to M, and M then owned both the dominant and servient estates, the easement would terminate. Because the purpose of the easement was to benefit W's land, and once M owns both, the easement isn't needed anymore. So the easement is extinguished.

So when M sold the house (which was on the former W's land) to the purchaser, the easement was no longer in existence. Therefore, the purchaser doesn't have the easement because it was already extinguished before he bought the property.

Wait, but the question says that the easement was of public record. So when the purchaser bought the house, would the recorded easement still affect the property? Or does the extinguishment mean that the easement is no longer enforceable, even if it's still on record?

I think once the easement is extinguished, it's gone, regardless of the record. So when M bought W's land, the easement ended. So when M sold the house to the purchaser, the purchaser didn't get the easement because it no longer existed.

So the purchaser is trying to claim the easement, but it was already extinguished. Therefore, the man would win because the easement was extinguished when he acquired W's land.

Looking at the options, option A says the man prevails because the easement was extinguished. Option B is about the purchaser not having actual notice, but in property law, recording usually implies constructive notice, so lack of actual notice might not matter.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The easement was recorded when it was created. So when the purchaser bought the house from M, he should have been on notice because it's in the public records. But if the easement had been extinguished before M sold it, then the purchaser can't claim it.

Wait, when M bought W's land, the easement was extinguished. So when M sold the house to the purchaser, the easement was already gone. So the purchaser didn't get it because it no longer existed.

Therefore, the man (M) is correct in blocking the easement because it no longer exists. So the answer should be A.

But wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again about when the easement was extinguished. The easement was created by M for the benefit of W's land. When W's land is sold to M, M owns both the servient and dominant estates. So the easement is extinguished by the merger of the two estates. That happens automatically upon the transfer, regardless of possession. So the easement was extinguished three years ago when M bought W's land.

Therefore, when M sold the house to the purchaser two years ago, the easement was already gone, so the purchaser didn't acquire it. So when the purchaser started using the path, M was within his rights to block it.

So the answer is A: The man, because the easement was extinguished.

But wait another thing. Is the easement appurtenant? Because in some cases, the easement can continue even if the dominant and servient estates are owned by the same person, but I think that's not the case. Once the same person owns both, the easement is extinguished unless it's explicitly reserved. But in this case, it wasn't reserved; M just took ownership.

So, yes, the easement was extinguished. Therefore, the man (option A) would win.

Alternatively, some might think that because the easement was recorded, the purchaser could still claim it, but no, because it was extinguished before M sold the property. So the recording doesn't matter anymore because the easement had already ended.

The question revolves around the enforceability of an easement after changes in property ownership. Here's the analysis:

1. **Creation of the Easement**: Five years ago, the man (M) granted a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman (W), who owned the adjacent lot to the south. The easement was appurtenant, benefiting W's land (the dominant estate) and burdening M's land (the servient estate). The easement was recorded, providing constructive notice to future purchasers.

2. **Extinguishment of the Easement**: Three years ago, W sold her lot (the dominant estate) to M. When M acquired ownership of both the dominant and servient estates, the easement was automatically extinguished due to the "merger" of the two estates. This extinguishment occurred regardless of whether M took possession of the house.

3. **Sale to the Purchaser**: Two years ago, M sold the house to the purchaser via a warranty deed. At this point, the easement had already been extinguished when M acquired W's land. Therefore, the purchaser did not acquire the easement, even though it was recorded. The recording of the easement does not revive it once it has been extinguished.

4. **Purchaser's Claim**: The purchaser began using the path after being informed about the easement by a neighbor. However, since the easement was already extinguished before M sold the property, the purchaser has no legal right to use the path. M was within his rights to block access.

**Evaluation of Options**:
- **Option A**: Correct. The easement was extinguished when M acquired both the dominant and servient estates, so the purchaser cannot claim it.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The purchaser's lack of actual notice is irrelevant because the easement was already extinguished before the sale.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A warranty deed does not revive an easement that has been extinguished.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the easement was recorded, it was extinguished before the purchaser acquired the property, so the recording does not affect the outcome.

**Conclusion**: The easement was extinguished when M acquired both estates, and the purchaser cannot claim it. The man prevails.
