Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electron configurations and the number of states they belong to. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking about the carbon configuration 1s² 2s² 2p². I remember that electron configurations tell us how electrons are arranged in an atom. For carbon, the atomic number is 6, so 1s² is 2 electrons, 2s² is another 2, and 2p² is the remaining 2. That adds up to 6, which makes sense.

Now, the question is about the number of states. Wait, states in this context probably refer to the different possible ways the electrons can be arranged, considering their quantum numbers. Oh, right, each electron has a set of quantum numbers: n, l, ml, and ms. But wait, I think when we're talking about the possible states, especially in terms of electron configurations, we're considering the different possible arrangements of electrons in orbitals, which includes the spin states.

So for each electron in the 2p orbital, since p has l=1, ml can be -1, 0, +1. So three orbitals: px, py, pz. Each can hold 2 electrons with opposite spins. So, the 2p² means two electrons in the p orbitals.

I think the question is about the number of possible microstates, which is the number of ways the electrons can be arranged in those orbitals considering their spins. Oh wait, but wait, the term "states" might be a bit ambiguous. Are they asking about the number of possible distinct states (microstates) for these electrons, or something else? Because in quantum mechanics, each electron's state is described by its quantum numbers, so each unique combination would be a different state.

But wait, for two electrons in the same orbital (same n, l, ml), they must have opposite spins due to the Pauli exclusion principle. So if both are in the same p orbital, their spins are paired. But if they're in different p orbitals, their spins can be the same or different, right?

Wait, no. Wait, I think I should approach this using the concept of electron configuration and possible microstates. So for the 2p² case, how many possible ways can two electrons be arranged in the p orbitals, considering their spins.

Each p orbital can hold up to two electrons, with opposite spins. So let's see: how many possible arrangements are there for two electrons in the three p orbitals?

I remember that for electrons in orbitals, the number of possible microstates can be calculated by considering the ways to distribute the electrons among the orbitals and their spins.

So for the 2p², the possible scenarios are:

1. Both electrons in the same orbital. Since each orbital can hold two, each with opposite spins. So in this case, there's only one way for each orbital. Since there are three orbitals, that's three possibilities.

2. Electrons in different orbitals. For this, each electron can be in any of the three orbitals, but we have to account for their spins.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. For two electrons, the possible arrangements are either both in the same orbital (with opposite spins) or in different orbitals.

So, when both are in the same orbital, there's only one possible spin state (opposite spins), and there are three choices of which orbital they're in. So 3 possibilities.

When they are in different orbitals, each can be in any of the three orbitals. But since the electrons are indistinct, the number of ways is combinations. So for two different orbitals, we need to choose two out of the three p orbitals. The number of ways to choose two orbitals is C(3,2) which is 3. For each such pair of orbitals, each electron can have a spin of +1/2 or -1/2. So each electron's spin can be either up or down, but they can be the same or different.

Wait, but wait, when electrons are in different orbitals, their spins can be parallel or antiparallel. So the number of possible spin states for two electrons in different orbitals is the number of ways their spins can be arranged.

Each electron has two possible spin states. So for two electrons, without considering the Pauli exclusion (which doesn't apply here because they're in different orbitals), the total spin states would be 2 * 2 =4. But wait, wait. For two electrons in different orbitals, the exchange of electrons doesn't create a new state, but I think for the purpose of counting microstates, we consider each possible spin combination.

Wait, but the way I've learned this is that when the spatial parts (orbitals) are different, the spin can be either singlet or triplet states. But perhaps for the total number of possible microstates, regardless of symmetry, it's just the product.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of possible microstates.

Each electron in a different orbital can have either spin up or down. So for each pair of orbitals, the first electron can be in orbital A with spin up or down, and the second in orbital B with spin up or down. But since the electrons are indistinct, the number of unique states is the number of possible combinations.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of possible ways to arrange the two electrons in the p orbitals, considering their spins.

Each electron has 3 choices for ml (the p orbitals: -1, 0, +1) and 2 choices for ms (spin up or down). So without any restrictions, the total number would be (3 * 2) * (3 * 2) = 36. But that's without considering the Pauli exclusion principle and indistinguishability.

Wait, but Pauli exclusion says that no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. So for each orbital (same n, l, ml), the electrons must have opposite spins. So in the same orbital, only one possible spin configuration is allowed: one up, one down.

But when electrons are in different orbitals, their spins can be the same or different.

So let's break it down:

Case 1: Both electrons in the same orbital.

For each of the three orbitals, you can have two electrons with opposite spins. So that's 3 possible states.

Case 2: Electrons in different orbitals.

Now, how many ways are there to arrange two electrons in different orbitals, considering their spins.

First, choose two different orbitals. There are C(3,2)=3 ways to choose the pair of orbitals (say, px and py, px and pz, or py and pz).

For each pair, each electron can have spin up or down. So for each orbital pair, the number of spin possibilities is 2 * 2 =4. But wait, wait. Because the electrons are in different orbitals, their spins can be the same or different. So for each pair of orbitals, the number of possible spin states is 4.

But wait, wait, no. Because the Pauli exclusion principle doesn't apply when the spatial parts are different, so each electron can have any spin. So for two electrons in different orbitals, each can have spin up or down, leading to four possible spin configurations.

But wait, electrons are fermions, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Oh, but when considering the spatial and spin parts, the overall wavefunction is the product. So if the spatial part is symmetric (same orbital, but that's not the case here), or antisymmetric, then the spin part adjusts accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting into more advanced territory than needed. Maybe a simpler approach is to count all possible microstates.

Each electron in a p orbital can have ml = -1, 0, +1, and ms = +1/2 or -1/2.

So for two electrons, the total possible microstates without considering Pauli would be (3 * 2)^2 = 36. But considering Pauli, which says that no two electrons can have all four quantum numbers the same. So for each orbital (n, l, ml), you can have at most two electrons with ms = +1/2 and -1/2.

So the valid microstates are those where either the ml is different, or if ml is same, then ms must be different.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate all possible ways, subtracting the cases where both are in the same orbital with the same spin.

Wait, no. Let me think step by step:

For each of the two electrons in 2p²:

Each can be in any of the three p orbitals (ml = -1, 0, +1), and each can have spin up or down.

So the first electron has 3 * 2 =6 possibilities. The second electron would have:

- If it's in a different orbital than the first, it can have any of 3 orbitals (including the same as the first, but wait, no, if same orbital, then spin must be opposite).

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a permutation with restrictions.

Alternatively, the number of possible microstates is the number of ways to place two electrons in the available orbitals, considering their spins.

Each orbital can hold 0, 1, or 2 electrons. But since the electrons are in 2p², exactly two are in the p orbitals.

So, the possible arrangements are:

1. Both electrons in the same orbital: 3 orbitals to choose from, each with paired spins (so each such case is one arrangement).

2. Electrons in two different orbitals: For each pair of orbitals, the electrons can have either the same spin or opposite spins.

Wait, but in two different orbitals, the spins can be anything. So for each pair of orbitals, how many spin combinations are possible?

Each electron has two spin options, so four possibilities. But considering that the electrons are indistinct, perhaps the number is the same, as each possibility is unique.

Wait, but for two different orbitals, the spin states can be:

- Both up: (up, up)
- Both down: (down, down)
- One up and one down: but since the electrons are in different orbitals, the order might matter.

Wait, no, because the electrons are indistinct. So for each pair of orbitals, the possible spin configurations are:

- Both up: 1 way (since both have same spin)
- Both down: 1 way
- Opposite spins: but since the electrons are in different orbitals, each can have opposite spins. But how many ways is that?

Wait, for two electrons in different orbitals, each can be spin up or down, leading to 2 * 2 =4 possibilities. But since the electrons are indistinct, perhaps some of these are duplicates.

Wait, no. Because if you have electron A in orbital 1 with spin up and electron B in orbital 2 with spin down, that's a different state than A in 1 down and B in 2 up. Because the orbitals are different, the positions are distinguishable. So maybe all four are unique.

So for each pair of orbitals, there are 4 possible spin states.

So the number of such cases would be the number of orbital pairs (3 choose 2 =3) multiplied by 4 spin states each, giving 3 *4=12.

Adding the cases where both electrons are in the same orbital (3 cases), the total number of microstates is 3 +12=15.

Wait, but wait a minute, I'm getting 15 here. Looking back at the options, option D is 15. So is that the correct answer?

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought carbon's ground state is 1s² 2s² 2p², and the possible states might relate to its valence. Alternatively, perhaps the term "states" here refers to the number of possible energy levels or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of how Hund's rule applies. Hund's rule says that electrons will fill degenerate orbitals singly before pairing. So for 2p², the maximum number of unpaired electrons is 2, with each in separate orbitals. But that's about the ground state configuration, not the number of possible states.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of states that belong to this configuration. So perhaps it's the number of possible distinct electron arrangements, considering all possible quantum states.

Wait, another approach: the number of possible microstates (distinct arrangements) is given by the combination formula. The formula for the number of microstates for a given electron configuration is:

Number of microstates = (number of ways to arrange electrons in orbitals) × (number of spin states).

Wait, but perhaps using the formula for multi-electron atoms, the number of possible states is calculated using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something, but I think that's more advanced than needed here.

Alternatively, for each electron, the quantum numbers are n, l, ml, and ms. So for 2p², n=2, l=1, ml can be -1, 0, +1.

Each electron has ml values -1, 0, +1 and ms can be ±1/2.

So for two electrons, the number of possible microstates without considering Pauli is (3×2)^2 =36. But we have to subtract the cases where both electrons have the same n, l, ml, and ms. Wait, but Pauli exclusion says that no two electrons can have the same n, l, ml, and ms.

So for each orbital (same n, l, ml), the ms must be different. So for each orbital, you can have at most two electrons with opposite spins.

So the allowed microstates are those where either the ml is different, or if ml is same, then ms is different.

So let's calculate the allowed microstates.

Total possible without restriction: 6 options for each electron (3 ml ×2 ms) → 6×6=36.

Now, subtract the cases where both electrons are in the same ml and same ms. For each ml value (-1,0,+1), there are two possibilities where both electrons have the same ms: both up or both down. Wait, no: same ml and same ms would only happen if both have same ml and same ms. So for each ml, you can have two electrons with same ms, but that's impossible. So for each ml, the number of forbidden cases is when both electrons have the same ms.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For each ml, how many ways can both electrons have the same ms?

Each ml has two possible ms: up and down. So for same ml and same ms, the number of possibilities is:

For each ml, the number of ways both electrons have same ms is 2 (both up or both down), but wait, wait.

Wait, no. Each electron has two choices for ms. So when both have the same ml and same ms, how many such cases are there?

Actually, for each ml, the number of cases where both electrons have the same ms is 2: both up or both down. But wait, no, because for each electron, their ms is independent. So for each ml, you can have both up, both down, but wait, that's not possible because each electron can have any ms.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of allowed microstates.

The allowed microstates are those where for each orbital (same n, l, ml), the electrons have opposite spins. So for each orbital, you can have 0, 1, or 2 electrons.

But in our case, we have exactly two electrons in the p orbitals. So the possibilities are:

1. Both in the same orbital: must have opposite spins. Each such case corresponds to one microstate per orbital. So 3 orbitals → 3 microstates.

2. Each in separate orbitals: For each pair of orbitals, you can have any combination of spins.

So for each pair of orbitals (there are 3 choose 2 =3 pairs), the electrons can have any spin states.

Each electron in a separate orbital can have spin up or down. So for each pair of orbitals, the number of spin combinations is 2 ×2=4. So 3 pairs ×4=12.

So total microstates: 3 (same orbital) +12 (different orbitals) =15.

So the number of states is 15. Looking at the options, option D is 15. So the answer should be D.

To determine the number of states corresponding to the electron configuration \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^2\), we analyze the possible arrangements of the two electrons in the \(2p\) orbitals, considering their quantum numbers: \(n\), \(l\), \(m_l\), and \(m_s\). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Electron Configuration**: The \(2p^2\) configuration means there are two electrons in the \(2p\) orbitals. Each \(p\) orbital can hold up to two electrons with opposite spins due to the Pauli exclusion principle.

2. **Possible Arrangements**:
   - **Case 1: Both electrons in the same orbital**  
     If both electrons occupy the same \(p\) orbital, they must have opposite spins (\(+\frac{1}{2}\) and \(-\frac{1}{2}\)). There are three \(p\) orbitals (\(m_l = -1, 0, +1\)), so there are 3 such states.
   - **Case 2: Electrons in different orbitals**  
     If the electrons occupy different \(p\) orbitals, there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) ways to choose the pair of orbitals. For each pair, the spins of the electrons can be either parallel or antiparallel, giving \(2 \times 2 = 4\) possible spin configurations. Thus, there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) states for this case.

3. **Total Number of States**: Adding the states from both cases:  
   \[
   \text{Total states} = 3 \, (\text{same orbital}) + 12 \, (\text{different orbitals}) = 15.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The total number of states corresponding to the \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^2\) configuration is **15**. 

The correct answer is **D**.
