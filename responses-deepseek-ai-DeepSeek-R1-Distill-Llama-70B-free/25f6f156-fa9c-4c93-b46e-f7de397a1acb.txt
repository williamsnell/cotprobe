Question:

The flashlight battery is a zinc and manganese dioxide (MnO_2) dry cell. The anode consists of a zinc can and the cathode of a carbon rod surrounded by a moist mixture of MnO_2, carbon, ammonium chloride (NH_4Cl_2), and zinc chloride (ZnCl_2). The cathode reaction is written ZMnO_2(s) + Zn^2+ + 2e^- \rightarrow ZnMn_2O_4(s) . If the cathode in a typical zinc and manganese dioxide dry cell contains 4.35g of MnO_2, how long can it deliver a steady current of 2.0 milliamperes (mA) before all its chemicals are exhausted?

Okay, so I've got this problem about a flashlight battery, which is a zinc and manganese dioxide dry cell. The question is about how long the battery can deliver a steady current before its chemicals are exhausted. Hmm, I remember that this is a problem involving electrochemistry and probably the concept of Faraday's laws of electrolysis.

Alright, the anode is zinc, and the cathode is a carbon rod surrounded by MnO2 and some other stuff. The cathode reaction is given as ZnMnO2(s) + Zn²+ + 2e⁻ → ZnMn2O4(s). Wait, wait, the reaction is written with MnO₂ as the starting point. So the key here is to figure out how much charge can be delivered by the MnO₂ in the cathode.

The problem states that the cathode contains 4.35 grams of MnO₂. The current is 2.0 mA, which is 0.002 A. I think the first step is to calculate the total charge that can be supplied by the MnO₂, then find out how long the current can run before that charge is exhausted.

So, the plan is:

1. Determine the moles of MnO₂ available.
2. Find out how many moles of electrons are involved in the cathode reaction per mole of MnO₂.
3. Use Faraday's law to calculate total charge (Q = n * F * moles of e⁻).
4. Time is the total charge divided by current.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, moles of MnO₂. The molar mass of MnO₂ is Mn (54.94 g/mol) + 2*O (16.00 g/mol each) = 54.94 + 32.00 = 86.94 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 4.35 g / 86.94 g/mol ≈ 0.05 mol. Let me compute that more accurately: 4.35 / 86.94. Let's see, 4.35 ÷ 86.94 ≈ 0.05 moles (exact number will come later, but approx 0.05).

Next, the cathode reaction: The equation shows that for each MnO₂, one Zn²+ and 2 electrons are involved. So per mole of MnO₂, 2 moles of electrons are transferred. So moles of e⁻ per mole of MnO₂ is 2. So total moles of electrons = 0.05 mol MnO₂ * 2 mol e⁻/mol MnO₂ = 0.10 mol e⁻.

Faraday's constant is about 96485 C/mol e⁻. So total charge Q = n * F = 0.10 * 96485 ≈ 9648.5 Coulombs.

Now, the current is given as 2.0 mA, which is 0.002 A. Since 1 A is 1 C/s, the time (t) is Q / I = 9648.5 C / 0.002 A = 9648.5 / 0.002 = 4,824,250 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that again. 9648.5 divided by 0.002. Oh right, because 0.002 is 2e-3, so 9648.5 / 0.002 = 9648.5 * 500 = 4,824,250 seconds.

Now, convert seconds into days. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day.

So 4,824,250 s ÷ (60 * 60 * 24) = let's compute that step by step.

60*60=3600, 3600*24=86400 seconds in a day.

4,824,250 ÷ 86,400 ≈ let's see.

86,400 * 56 = 4,838,400. Hmm, that's actually a bit higher than 4.8 million. Wait, 56 days would be 4,838,400 s, but our time is 4,824,250 s, which is a bit less. So maybe around 56 days minus a day or so. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 86,400 * 56 = 56 * 86,400.

Let me compute 50 * 86,400 = 4,320,000. 6 * 86,400 = 518,400. So 4,320,000 + 518,400 = 4,838,400 s for 56 days.

Our time is 4,824,250 s, which is 4,838,400 - 4,824,250 = 14,150 s less than 56 days.

14,150 s ÷ 86,400 ≈ 0.164 days. So 56 days - 0.164 days ≈ 55.836 days. So about 55.8 days.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 5.4e6 s (about 65 days)
B:4.8e6 (60)
C:3e6 (35)
D:7.2e6 (80)
E:3.6e6 (45)
F:1.2e6 (15)
G:6e6 (70)
H:2.4e6 (30)
I:9.6e6 (110)
J:1.8e6 (20)

Wait, our calculation gives 4,824,250 seconds, which is 4.824e6 seconds. Looking at the options, option B is 4.8e6, which is 60 days. Wait, but 4.8e6 s is 4,800,000 s.

4,800,000 s ÷ 86,400 = approx 55.555... days.

Hmm, 55.555 days is about 55.56 days. So option B is 4.8e6 s, which is exactly 4,800,000 s. Let me check the initial calculations to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles of MnO₂. Let's redo that accurately.

Molar mass of MnO₂:

Mn: 54.94 g/mol
O: 16.00 * 2 =32.00
Total: 54.94 + 32.00 =86.94 g/mol.

Mass given is 4.35 g.

Moles = 4.35 / 86.94 = let's compute that.

4.35 ÷ 86.94 → let's do the division.

86.94 into 4.35 is 0.05 moles because 86.94 * 0.05 = 4.347, which is just a little less than 4.35. So it's approximately 0.05 moles, but maybe a bit more precise.

Let me calculate it more accurately.

4.35 / 86.94 = ?

Let me approximate:

86.94 * 0.05 = 4.347, as above.

4.35 is 4.35 -4.347 = 0.003 more than 0.05 moles.

0.003 /86.94 = approx 0.0000345 moles.

So total moles is 0.0500345 ≈ 0.05003 mol.

Then, moles of electrons: 2 * 0.05003 = 0.10006 mol e⁻.

Total charge Q = 0.10006 mol * 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.10006 * 96485 = let's compute that.

0.1 *96485 =9648.5 C.

But since it's 0.10006, it's about 9648.5 + (0.00006 *96485) = 9648.5 + ~5.79 = approx 9654.29 C.

So Q≈9654 C.

Then, time t= Q/(I) = 9654 C / 0.002 A = 9654 / 0.002 = 4,827,000 seconds.

Wait, 9654 / 0.002 → 9654 * 500 = 4,827,000 seconds.

Now, convert 4,827,000 s into days.

4,827,000 ÷ 86,400 ≈ let's compute.

86,400 * 56 = 4,838,400 as before.

So 4,827,000 is 4,838,400 - 11,400 = so 56 days minus 11,400 seconds.

11,400 s is 3.1667 hours (11,400 /3600 = 3.1667 h), so about 3 hours 10 minutes.

So 56 days minus 3h10m is roughly 55.87 days.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.8e6 s (which is 4,800,000 s), which is 4,800,000 /86,400 = 55.555... days, which is about 55.56 days.

But wait, our calculated time is 4,827,000 s, which is 4.827e6 s. The options don't have that exact value. The closest is option B:4.8e6 sec (60 days), but wait, 4.8e6 is 4,800,000 s, which is 55.555 days. Hmm, but the option says 60 days. Wait, that can't be right. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where I calculated the days. Let me double-check that.

Time in seconds: 4,827,000 s.

Number of days: 4,827,000 ÷ (60*60*24) = 4,827,000 ÷ 86400.

Let me compute 4,827,000 ÷ 86400.

Let me compute 4,827,000 ÷ 86400.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 100: 48270 ÷ 864.

Hmm, let's see how many times 864 fits into 48270.

Compute 864 * 56 = 48,384.

Because 864 * 50 =43,200, 864 *6=5,184 → 43,200+5,184=48,384.

Subtracting: 48,270 -48,384= -114. Hmm, no, wait, 48,384 is larger than 48,270. So 55 times.

Wait, 864 *55=?

864 *50=43,200; 864 *5=4,320 → total 47,520.

47,520 is less than 48,270. The difference is 48,270 -47,520=750.

Now, how many more times does 864 fit into 750? 0.869 times perhaps (750/864 ≈ 0.868). So total is 55.868 days.

Wait, wait, 55.868 days? So that's approx 55.87 days.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option B, which is 4.8e6 s (60 days). Wait, no, 4.8e6 s is 4,800,000 s. Let me compute how many days that is.

4,800,000 s ÷ 86,400 s/day = 80000/864 = let me compute 80000 ÷ 864.

Well, 864 * 92 = 79,488 (since 800 * 864=691,200; 92 is 800+92=892 → no, perhaps better to compute 80000 ÷864.

80000 ÷ 864 = approx 92.5926 days? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait 80000 ÷ 864 is 80000 ÷ 864 ≈ 92.592 days? Wait, wait no, 80000 is 8e4, and 864e3 is 8.64e5? Wait, no, 4,800,000 ÷ 86400 → 4,800,000 ÷ 86,400 → same as 48,000 ÷ 864 → 48,000 ÷ 864.

Let me compute that: 48,000 ÷ 864.

Compute 864 * 55 = 47,520 (as before). 48,000 -47,520=480.

480 ÷ 864 = 0.555555… So 55.555… days. So 55.56 days.

So 4.8e6 seconds is 55.56 days, which is about 55 and a half days, which is approximately 56 days. But the option B says 4.8e6 sec (about 60 days). Wait, that's a discrepancy here. Because 4.8e6 s is 55.56 days, but the option says (about 60 days). So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, let me re-examine the cathode reaction. The reaction is ZnMnO₂(s) + Zn²+ + 2e⁻ → ZnMn₂O₄(s). So for each mole of MnO₂ consumed, 2 electrons are gained. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the formula of MnO₂. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the molar mass correctly.

Let me recheck the calculations step by step.

Molar mass of MnO₂: Mn is 54.94, O is 16.00 ×2 =32. So 54.94+32=86.94 g/mol.

Mass of MnO₂:4.35 g.

Moles = 4.35 /86.94 = let me compute exact value.

4.35 ÷86.94 → let's see, 4.35 /86.94 = ?

Let me approximate.

86.94 × 0.05 =4.347 → 4.347 is just under 4.35.

So 0.05 moles would be 4.347g; 4.35g is 0.003g more. So 0.003g /86.94 g/mol = 0.0000345 mol.

So total moles is 0.0500345 ≈0.05003 mol.

Each mole of MnO₂ produces 2 moles of electrons, so 0.05003 *2 =0.10006 mol e⁻.

Charge Q = n * F = 0.10006 *96485 ≈9654 C.

Time t = Q / I = 9654 C / 0.002 A =4,827,000 seconds.

Convert to days: 4,827,000 ÷ 86400 = ?

Let me compute 4,827,000 ÷ 86400.

86400 × 56 =4,838,400 → which is larger than 4,827,000.

So 56 days would be 4,838,400 s.

4,827,000 is 11,400 s less than that.

11,400 s ÷ 86400 s/day = 0.132 days → about 3.17 hours.

So 56 days - 3.17 hours → 55.87 days.

Which is approximately 55.9 days.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option B:4.8e6 sec (about 60 days). But wait, 4.8e6 is 4,800,000 s, which is 55.555 days, which is about 55.56 days.

But the option B says (about 60 days). Wait, that doesn't align. Did I miscalculate somewhere else?

Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the anode reaction as well. Wait, the problem says the cathode contains 4.35g of MnO₂. The anode is zinc, but the problem only gives the cathode's mass. So only the MnO₂ is the limiting factor. So our initial approach is correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the current is given as 2.0 mA, but perhaps I forgot to convert it correctly. 2.0 mA is 0.002 A. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see:

Option B: 4.8e6 sec (about 60 days)

Wait, 4.8e6 sec =4,800,000 sec.

4,800,000 ÷ 86,400 = 55.555... days, which is about 55.56 days, not 60. So the option B's description says about 60 days, which doesn't match. So perhaps the correct option is not B, but another.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial charge calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction's stoichoimetry is different. Let me look again.

The cathode reaction is ZnMnO₂(s) + Zn²+ + 2e⁻ → ZnMn₂O₄(s). So for each mole of MnO₂, 2 electrons are gained.

So per mole of MnO₂, 2 moles of e⁻ → so 2 F per mole.

So for 0.05003 mol MnO₂, moles of e⁻ is 0.10006 mol. Thus, charge is 0.10006 *96485 = approx 9654 C.

Time is 9654 C / 0.002 A =4,827,000 s → as before.

So 4,827,000 s is about 4.827e6 s, which isn't exactly any of the options, but the closest is option B:4.8e6 s (55.5 days), but the option says about 60 days, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation is correct, but the option B's description is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula of the product is different. The product is ZnMn₂O₄. So for each MnO₂, how much is consumed? Let me see. The reaction shows 1 mole of MnO₂ reacting, so the calculation remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the molar mass of MnO₂ incorrectly.

Wait, let me recheck the molar mass of MnO₂.

Manganese (Mn) has an atomic weight of about 54.94 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol. So MnO₂ is 54.94 + 2*(16.00) =54.94+32=86.94 g/mol. That's correct.

So I think the calculations are correct, leading to about 4.827e6 seconds, which is approximately 55.8 days.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match 55 days. Option B
