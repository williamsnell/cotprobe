Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Alright, two point charges are fixed on the x-axis. One is 30 nC at the origin, and the other is -40 nC at x=72 cm. Then there's a particle with a charge of 42 μC released from rest at x=28 cm. The initial acceleration is given as 100 km/s², and I need to find the mass of the particle. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I think I should start by understanding the setup. So, the two fixed charges are q1=30 nC at x=0 and q2=-40 nC at x=72 cm. The particle is at x=28 cm, so I should figure out the electric field it experiences due to these two charges and then find the force, which will lead to acceleration.

Wait, but the particle's own charge is 42 μC. Since it's a charge in an electric field, it will experience a force due to the other two charges. So the net electric field at the particle's location is the sum of the fields from q1 and q2.

Electric field due to a point charge is given by E = kq / r², right? And the direction depends on the sign of the charge. Positive charges create fields that radiate outward, negative ones inward.

Let me break it down. The particle is at 28 cm. So, the distance from q1 (which is at 0 cm) is 28 cm. The distance from q2 (at 72 cm) is 72-28=44 cm.

Wait, but wait, the distance is always positive, so from q2 to the particle is 72 -28=44 cm, which is 0.44 meters.

So first, I'll calculate E1 (due to q1) and E2 (due to q2) at the point x=28 cm.

q1 is 30 nC, which is 30e-9 C. q2 is -40 nC, which is -40e-9 C.

Calculating E1: E1 = k*q1 / r1². r1 is 0.28 m. Similarly, E2 = k*q2 / r2², where r2 is 0.44 m.

Wait, but I also need to consider the direction. Since q1 is positive, the electric field it creates at 28 cm points away from q1, which is to the right (since the particle is to the right of q1). For q2, it's negative, so the electric field points towards q2. Since the particle is at 28 cm, which is to the left of q2 (at 72 cm), the field from q2 at the particle's location points towards q2, which is to the right.

So both E1 and E2 are pointing to the right. That means the net electric field is the sum of E1 and E2.

Wait wait, let me double-check. q2 is negative, so the field from q2 at the particle's position points towards q2. Since the particle is at 28 cm and q2 is at 72 cm, the direction from the particle to q2 is to the right. So yes, E2 points to the right.

So the particle is positively charged (42 μC is positive), so the force it experiences is F = q * E_net. Since E_net is to the right, the force is to the right.

But wait, the particle's acceleration is given as 100 km/s². Oh wait, the magnitude is given, but the direction depends on the force. Let's compute that.

So, E1: k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

E1 = (8.988e9) * (30e-9) / (0.28)^2.

Let me compute this. Let's calculate numerator first: 8.988e9 *30e-9 = 8.988 *30 = 269.64. Because 1e9 *1e-9 =1. So 8.988e9 *30e-9 = 8.988*30 = ~269.64 N·m²/C.

Then denominator: (0.28 m)^2 = 0.0784 m².

So E1 = 269.64 / 0.0784 ≈ let's see, 269.64 /0.0784 ≈ 3,440 N/C? Let me compute that exactly. 0.0784 times 3440 is 0.0784 *3440 = 0.0784 *3000=235.2, 0.0784 *440= 34.5, total approx 269.7. So yeah, 3440 N/C.

E2 is due to q2: -40 nC, so E2 = k*q2 / r2².

So E2 = (8.988e9) * (-40e-9) / (0.44)^2.

Wait, wait, but since q2 is negative, E2's direction would be toward q2. So since the particle is at 28 cm, E2 points to the right, as I thought earlier. But when calculating the magnitude, the sign will matter.

Wait no, when calculating the electric field, the sign indicates direction. So E2 would be negative if pointing to the left, positive to the right.

Wait, but wait, let me think. The formula E = kq / r² gives the field's magnitude and direction based on the sign of q. So for a positive charge, the field points away. For a negative charge, it points toward.

So q2 is negative, so the field at the particle's location points toward q2, which is to the right. So E2 is positive (since right is considered the positive direction here).

So E2 = 8.988e9 * (-40e-9) / (0.44)^2. Wait, no, wait: because E is a vector, but I'm taking the magnitude into account with direction.

Wait, no, let me clarify: when I compute E2, the formula gives the value with sign based on the charge. So for q2 = -40e-9 C, E2 would be negative if pointing to the left, positive if to the right. But wait, since E is a vector, the direction is determined by the sign.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute E as a vector, considering the direction.

Alternatively, I can compute the magnitudes and add them, considering their directions.

So, let's compute the magnitude of E1 and E2, then add them since both are in the same direction.

E1's magnitude: k*q1 / r1².

E1_mag = 8.988e9 * 30e-9 / (0.28)^2.

As before, that's approximately 3440 N/C.

E2_mag: 8.988e9 * 40e-9 / (0.44)^2.

Wait, since q2 is -40 nC, but when calculating magnitude, I'll take the absolute value. So 40e-9 C.

So E2_mag = (8.988e9) * (40e-9) / (0.44)^2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *40e-9 = 8.988 *40 = 359.52.

Denominator: (0.44)^2 = 0.1936.

So E2_mag = 359.52 / 0.1936 ≈ let's see, 359.52 / 0.1936.

0.1936 * 1857 = approximately 359.5 because 0.1936 * 1857 ≈ 0.1936*(1800+57) = 0.1936*1800=348.48, 0.1936*57≈11.03, total 359.51. So E2_mag is approximately 1857 N/C.

So E_net is E1_mag + E2_mag, since both point to the right. So 3440 + 1857 = 5297 N/C.

Wait, 3440 + 1857 = 5297? Let me add them: 3000 + 1000=4000, 440+857=1297, total 5297. Yes.

So E_net = 5297 N/C to the right.

The force on the particle is F = q * E. The particle's charge is 42 μC, which is 42e-6 C.

So F = 42e-6 C * 5297 N/C.

Compute that: 42e-6 *5297 = 42 *5297 *1e-6.

42 *5297. Let's compute that. 5297 *40=211,880, 5297*2=10,594. So total 222,474.

So F = 222,474e-6 N = 0.222474 N.

Wait, but wait, the direction is to the right, so the force is positive.

Now, F = m * a. So m = F / a.

Given that the initial acceleration's magnitude is 100 km/s². Wait, 100 km/s² is 1e5 m/s², because 1 km=1e3 m, so 1e5 m/s².

So m = F / a = 0.222474 N / (1e5 m/s²) = 0.222474e-5 kg.

Wait, 0.222474 / 1e5 = 2.22474e-6 kg.

Looking at the options:

A: 2.2e-6 kg

B: 2.5e-6

C:3.4e-6

D:4.2e-6

E:1.0e-6

F:1.5e-6

G:5.6e-6

H:3.0e-6

I:1.8e-6

J:2.8e-6

So 2.22474e-6 is approximately 2.2e-6 kg, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate E1 and E2.

E1: 30nC =30e-9 C. r1=0.28 m.

E1 = (8.988e9) *30e-9 / (0.28)^2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *30e-9 = 8.988 *30 = 269.64.

Denominator: 0.28^2=0.0784.

So 269.64 / 0.0784 = approximately 3440 N/C.

E2: q2 is -40e-9 C. r2=0.44 m.

E2's magnitude is (8.988e9 *40e-9) / (0.44)^2.

8.988e9 *40e-9 = 8.988 *40 = 359.52.

Denominator: 0.44^2=0.1936.

359.52 /0.1936 ≈ 1857 N/C.

So E_net = 3440 + 1857 = 5297 N/C.

F = q * E = 42e-6 * 5297 = 0.22247 N.

a =1e5 m/s².

m=F/a= 0.22247 / 1e5 = 2.2247e-6 kg ≈ 2.2e-6 kg. So option A.

But wait, wait a second. Is the acceleration in the same direction as the force? Since the particle is positively charged, the force is in the direction of E, which is to the right. So the acceleration is to the right, and the magnitude is as given.

So yes, my calculation seems correct. So the mass should be approximately 2.2e-6 kg, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we calculate the net electric field at the particle's location due to the two fixed charges and use it to determine the force acting on the particle. The particle's mass is then found using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \).

### Step 1: Electric field due to each charge
The electric field due to a point charge is given by:

\[
E = \frac{kq}{r^2}
\]

where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \), \( q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the point of interest.

1. **For \( q_1 = 30 \, \mathrm{nC} \) at \( x = 0 \):**
   - Distance to the particle at \( x = 28 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.28 \, \mathrm{m} \).
   - Magnitude of the electric field:
     \[
     E_1 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(30 \times 10^{-9})}{(0.28)^2} = \frac{269.64}{0.0784} \approx 3440 \, \mathrm{N/C}
     \]
   - Direction: Since \( q_1 \) is positive, the field points away from \( q_1 \), i.e., to the right.

2. **For \( q_2 = -40 \, \mathrm{nC} \) at \( x = 72 \, \mathrm{cm} \):**
   - Distance to the particle at \( x = 28 \, \mathrm{cm} = 72 - 28 = 44 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.44 \, \mathrm{m} \).
   - Magnitude of the electric field:
     \[
     E_2 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(40 \times 10^{-9})}{(0.44)^2} = \frac{359.52}{0.1936} \approx 1857 \, \mathrm{N/C}
     \]
   - Direction: Since \( q_2 \) is negative, the field points toward \( q_2 \), i.e., to the right.

### Step 2: Net electric field
Both \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) point to the right, so the net electric field is:

\[
E_{\text{net}} = E_1 + E_2 = 3440 + 1857 = 5297 \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

### Step 3: Force on the particle
The force on the particle is given by:

\[
F = q_{\text{particle}} \cdot E_{\text{net}}
\]

where \( q_{\text{particle}} = 42 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 42 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \). Substituting:

\[
F = (42 \times 10^{-6})(5297) = 0.22247 \, \mathrm{N}
\]

### Step 4: Mass of the particle
Using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), the mass is:

\[
m = \frac{F}{a}
\]

where \( a = 100 \, \mathrm{km/s^2} = 100,000 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \). Substituting:

\[
m = \frac{0.22247}{100,000} = 2.2247 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

### Final Answer
The mass of the particle is approximately \( 2.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{kg} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
