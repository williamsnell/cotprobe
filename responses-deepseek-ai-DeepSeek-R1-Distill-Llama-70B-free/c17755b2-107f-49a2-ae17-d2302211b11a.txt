Okay, so I need to figure out the structure of the United Nations Security Council. Hmm, I remember that the UN has a Security Council which is one of its main organs. I think the Security Council is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. But wait, how exactly is it structured?

I recall that there are permanent and non-permanent members. The number of permanent members comes to mindâ€”like five, right? Those are the big countries with veto power. The five permanent members are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. So each of these has a veto power, meaning they can block any decision they don't agree with.

Now, what about the non-permanent members? I think there are more of them. I remember that the total number of Security Council members is 15. So if there are 5 permanent, that leaves 10 non-permanent. These non-permanent members are elected by the General Assembly for a term, maybe two years. And they don't have veto power. So each year, some of them rotate out and new ones come in.

Let me look at the options given. The question is about the structure, so the correct answer should have 5 permanent members with veto power and 10 non-permanent without.

Looking at the options:
Option A: 5 permanent without veto, 10 rotating with. No, that's wrong because permanent members do have vetoes.
Option B: 15 rotating, none with veto. No, because the 5 are permanent.
Option C: 10 permanent with veto, 5 rotating without. No, the numbers are reversed.
Option D: 15 members all with veto. No, only the 5 have it.
Option E: 20 members, 10 perm with, 10 rotating without. No, total is 15.
Option F: 10 perm without, 5 rotating with. No, that's wrong.
Option G: 5 perm with, 10 rotating without. Yes, that's what I thought.
Option H: 15 perm with. No, only 5 are perm.
Option I: 7 perm with, 8 rotating. No, doesn't add up to 15 correctly.
Option J: 5 perm and 10 rotating, all with veto. No, only perm have it.

So the correct answer must be option G.

The United Nations Security Council is structured with 5 permanent members who have veto power and 10 non-permanent (rotating) members who do not. The permanent members are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The 10 non-permanent members are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. 

The correct answer is G: 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power.

Answer: G
