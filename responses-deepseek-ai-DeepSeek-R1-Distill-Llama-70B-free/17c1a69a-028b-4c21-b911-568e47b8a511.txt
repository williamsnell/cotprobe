Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about which heavenly bodies haven't had a spacecraft land on them. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I'll list out all the options provided: Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus, Mars, Saturn, Neptune, Venus, Pluto, the Moon, and the Sun. The question is asking which of these have never had a spacecraft landing.

I remember that Mars has had several landers, like the Viking missions and more recent ones such as Perseverance. So D, Mars, is out because a spacecraft has definitely landed there.

The Moon is another obvious one. The Apollo missions successfully landed humans on the Moon, so I is not the answer.

Venus is tricky. I think the Soviet Union's Venera program included landers. Venera 7, I believe, was the first to land on another planet, so G (Venus) has had landers. So G is out.

What about Mercury? I'm pretty sure NASA's MESSENGER orbiter was around Mercury, but did any land? No, I don't think any spacecraft has landed on Mercury yet. So A (Mercury) is a possible candidate.

Now, the gas giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. I know that Jupiter and Saturn have been visited by probes, but I don't think any have landed on them. Wait, Jupiter's moon Io? No, that's a moon. The Galileo probe went into Jupiter's atmosphere, but that's not a landing. So B, E, C, F are all gas giants, and I don't think any have had landers.

Pluto had the New Horizons flyby, but that didn't land. So H, Pluto, has no landers. Wait, but the question includes Pluto as an option, so H is another possible correct answer.

The Sun, J, is impossible because spacecraft can't land on the Sun; it's a star with no solid surface. So J is definitely a correct answer because no spacecraft has landed there.

Wait, but the question is which have NEVER had a spacecraft landed on them. So I need to pick all that apply, but the options are given as single choices. Wait, no, the question is phrased as multiple-choice, so only one correct answer.

Wait, no, the options are A-J, and the question asks which have never had a spacecraft landed on it. So possible answers could be multiple, but in the options, each is a single choice.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, each being a single heavenly body. So the question is which of these (each) has never had a spacecraft land on them. So I need to find which ones have no landers.

So let me go through each:

A: Mercury - No landers that I know of. MESSENGER was an orbiter.

B: Jupiter - No landers. Galileo's probe entered the atmosphere but didn't land on the planet.

C: Uranus - No landers. Only flybys, like Voyager 2.

D: Mars - Has landers, so no.

E: Saturn - No landers on Saturn itself, but the Huygens probe landed on Titan, Saturn's moon.

F: Neptune - No landers. Voyager 2 flyby only.

G: Venus - Landers have been sent, so no.

H: Pluto - No landers, only New Horizons flyby.

I: Moon - Landers, so no.

J: Sun - Can't land, so no.

So the question is which of these have never had a spacecraft land on them. So the correct answers would be B, C, E, F, H, J, and A.

But wait, the options are presented as single choices, so perhaps the question is asking which one of these has not had a spacecraft land on it. So I need to look for which ones have had landers and which haven't.

Wait, perhaps I should check each one:

Mercury: No landers. Only MESSENGER orbited and crashed at the end.

Jupiter: No landers. The Galileo probe entered the atmosphere but burned up.

Uranus: No landers.

Saturn: No landers on Saturn, but on the moons.

Neptune: No landers.

Pluto: No landers.

Sun: No landers.

So the question is which of the options have never had a spacecraft land on them. So the correct options are A, B, C, E, F, H, J.

But the options are given as single choices, so in the question, the user is to select one option from A to J. So perhaps the question is which of the following have never had a spacecraft land on them, and the correct answer is multiple, but in the multiple-choice setup, I think each option is a single body, so perhaps the question is which one hasn't had a spacecraft land on it. So perhaps the options include several correct answers, but the question is phrased as which of the following, so perhaps multiple are correct, but the user is to select the correct ones from the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question says "Which of the following heavenly bodies have never had a spacecraft landed on it?" So it's possible that more than one option is correct, but in the setup, each option is a single choice. So perhaps the correct answer is multiple, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe the intended answer is one of them, perhaps the most obvious ones.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me look up some facts to confirm.

- Mercury: No landers, only orbiters like MESSENGER and BepiColombo which is current.

- Jupiter: No landers, as the planet is a gas giant, and probes can't land on it.

- Uranus: No landers, only Voyager 2 flyby.

- Saturn: No landers on Saturn, but on its moons.

- Neptune: Same as Uranus.

- Pluto: No landers, just a flyby.

- Sun: Impossible.

So all the options except D, G, I have no landers. So the question is which of the options have never had a spacecraft land on them. So the correct answers would be options A, B, C, E, F, H, J.

But looking at the options in the question, the user is to select from A to J, each being one heavenly body. So the question is phrased as a single correct answer, but perhaps it's a multiple-select. But the way the question is written, it's a single choice, so perhaps the intended answer is the most obvious ones, like the Sun, which obviously can't have landers.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is the Sun. So if the question is which of the following have never had a spacecraft land on them, then J is definitely correct because you can't land on the Sun.

But wait, the question is asking which have never had a spacecraft landed on it. So which of the options have never had any landings.

So the correct answers would include the Sun (J), Jupiter (B), Uranus (C), Saturn (E), Neptune (F), Mercury (A), and Pluto (H).

But in the multiple-choice options, each option is a single body. So perhaps the question expects to pick all that apply, but in this scenario, the user is to choose the correct letter.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's a single-select, so perhaps the intended answer is the Sun, which is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to select all correct answers, but the way the user is to answer is by selecting one letter, which suggests that perhaps the intended answer is one of these.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that the correct answer is the Sun, as it's impossible, but other options like Jupiter, Uranus, etc., also haven't had landers.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is J, the Sun, but I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, C, E, F, H, J, but since the options are individual, maybe the question expects to pick the Sun as the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to pick all the options that fit, but the user is to select one option from A-J, which suggests that perhaps the intended answer is the Sun.

Wait, but perhaps the question is designed to test knowledge about which have landers, and the ones without include the Sun and the gas giants, etc.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is multiple, but since the options are single letters, perhaps the intended answer is B, C, E, F, H, J. But the user is to choose one letter.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is B, Jupiter, because it's a gas giant and no landers possible.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: Neptune, because all others except some have had landers.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The question is which of the following have never had a spacecraft landed on it. So the correct options are those that have no landers.

So the correct answers are A (Mercury), B (Jupiter), C (Uranus), E (Saturn), F (Neptune), H (Pluto), and J (Sun).

But the problem is that the options are given as single choices, so perhaps the intended answer is the Sun, J.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is B, Jupiter, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about which ones have definitely had landers. Mars (D), Venus (G), Moon (I) have had landers. The others (A, B, C, E, F, H, J) have not. So the correct answers are A, B, C, E, F, H, J.

But since the question is phrased as a single choice, perhaps the correct answer is the Sun (J), as it's impossible, making it a definite correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, Jupiter, as it's a gas giant and no landers.

Wait, but I think the more accurate answer would include multiple options, but given the setup, perhaps the intended answer is the Sun, J.

The question asks which of the listed heavenly bodies have never had a spacecraft landed on them. To determine this, each option is analyzed:

- **A: Mercury** - No spacecraft has landed on Mercury. Only orbiters like MESSENGER have been sent.
- **B: Jupiter** - No landers have been sent to Jupiter. The Galileo probe entered its atmosphere but did not land.
- **C: Uranus** - No landers have been sent. Only a Voyager 2 flyby occurred.
- **D: Mars** - Multiple landers, such as Perseverance, have been sent. Mars is not correct.
- **E: Saturn** - No landers on Saturn itself, but the Huygens probe landed on its moon, Titan.
- **F: Neptune** - No landers have been sent. Only a Voyager 2 flyby occurred.
- **G: Venus** - Landers, such as the Soviet Venera program, have been sent. Venus is not correct.
- **H: Pluto** - No landers have been sent. Only the New Horizons flyby occurred.
- **I: The Moon** - Multiple landers, including the Apollo missions, have been sent. The Moon is not correct.
- **J: The Sun** - No spacecraft can land on the Sun, as it is a star with no solid surface.

The heavenly bodies that have never had a spacecraft landed on them are **A (Mercury)**, **B (Jupiter)**, **C (Uranus)**, **E (Saturn)**, **F (Neptune)**, **H (Pluto)**, and **J (The Sun)**. However, since the question asks for a single choice, the most definitive answer is **J: The Sun**, as landing on it is impossible.

Answer: J
