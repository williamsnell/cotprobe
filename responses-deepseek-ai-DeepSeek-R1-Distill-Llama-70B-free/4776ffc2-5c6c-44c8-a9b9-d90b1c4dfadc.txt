Question:

Every day Melanie spends her lunch money consuming apples, at $1 each, and oranges, at $2 each. At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?

Options:

A: She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.
B: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.
C: She should spend all her money on apples since they are cheaper.
D: She should save her lunch money instead of spending it on apples and oranges.
E: She should continue consuming apples and oranges at the same rate, regardless of marginal utility.
F: She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.
G: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.
H: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the total utility is maximized, regardless of the price.
I: She should spend all her money on oranges as they have higher marginal utility.
J: She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar of oranges is twice that of apples.

Okay, so I have this economics question here about Melanie and her lunch money. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So Melanie buys apples and oranges every day for lunch. Apples are $1 each, oranges are $2 each. Right now, the marginal utility she gets from apples is 12, and from oranges it's 18. She's already spent all her lunch money, so the question is how should she adjust her consumption to maximize her utility.

Hmm, I remember that in consumer choice, the utility-maximizing condition is when the marginal utility per dollar is equal for all goods. Oh wait, right, the rule is that the ratio of marginal utilities should equal the ratio of prices. So the formula is MU_A / P_A = MU_O / P_O.

Let me plug in the numbers. Melanie's MU for apples is 12, and the price is $1, so MU per dollar for apples is 12/1 = 12. For oranges, MU is 18, price is $2, so 18/2 = 9. So right now, apples give her 12 per dollar and oranges 9 per dollar.

Wait, so if apples give a higher marginal utility per dollar than oranges, that means she should buy more apples and less oranges to maximize utility. Because she's getting more "bang for her buck" with apples right now.

So the current situation isn't optimal. She should reallocate her spending towards more apples and fewer oranges until the marginal utilities per dollar equalize. That way, the last dollar spent on each gives the same utility.

Looking at the options:

Option A says she's already at the optimal. But since 12 ≠ 9, that's not right.

Option B: Increase apple consumption, decrease oranges until marginal utility per dollar is equal. That sounds exactly like what I thought. So B is a possible correct answer.

Option C: Spend all on apples because cheaper. Well, cheaper isn't the only factor. The utility per dollar matters. But she's already getting more per dollar with apples, so she could increase apple consumption, but maybe not all. Because maybe at some point the MUs change.

Option F: Decrease apple and increase orange until MU per dollar equal. That's the opposite of what's needed since apples have higher per dollar utility. So F isn't right.

Option I: Spend all on oranges because higher MU. But that ignores the price. Oranges have higher MU but are more expensive. So per dollar, apples are better right now.

Option J: She should adjust until oranges' MU per dollar is twice apples. Wait, that would mean 2*(MU_A/P_A) = MU_O/P_O. But the correct condition is MU_A/P_A = MU_O/P_O. So J is suggesting a ratio where oranges are double, which isn't correct.

So the correct answer seems to be B. She should increase apples and decrease oranges until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.

To maximize utility, Melanie should allocate her spending so that the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both apples and oranges. Currently, apples provide a marginal utility per dollar of 12 (MU_A / P_A = 12 / 1), while oranges provide 9 (MU_O / P_O = 18 / 2). Since apples offer a higher marginal utility per dollar, Melanie should increase her consumption of apples and decrease her consumption of oranges until the marginal utility per dollar for both goods is equal. This adjustment ensures that her utility is maximized given her budget.

- **Option A** is incorrect because Melanie is not currently at the optimal combination (12 ≠ 9).  
- **Option B** is correct as it aligns with the utility-maximizing condition of equalizing marginal utility per dollar.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because it ignores the utility per dollar comparison.  
- **Option F** is incorrect because it suggests the opposite adjustment.  
- **Option I** is incorrect because it disregards the price difference.  
- **Option J** is incorrect because it proposes an incorrect ratio for utility maximization.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

B
