Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant in October. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on accounting, but let's try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the first thing I remember is that net profit is basically total sales minus all the expenses. But wait, in this case, it's a restaurant, so they deal with food costs too. So maybe I need to compute the cost of goods sold first, and then subtract all the other expenses.

The given data includes:
- Food on hand as of October 1: $609.31
- Purchases during the month: $1,827.63
- Sales during the month: $4,501.16
- Rent: $175.00
- Salaries: $580.15
- Supplies: $89.47
- Miscellaneous expenses: $50.83
- Food on hand as of October 31: $215.76

Wait, right. So cost of goods sold (COGS) for a restaurant would be the beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. That makes sense because you start with some food, buy more, and end with some left. So the food used is COGS.

So let's compute COGS:
COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory
Plugging in the numbers:
COGS = 609.31 + 1827.63 - 215.76

Let me calculate that. 609.31 + 1827.63 is 2436.94. Then subtract 215.76: 2436.94 - 215.76 equals... let's see, 2436.94 minus 200 is 2236.94, then minus 15.76 is 2221.18. So COGS is $2,221.18.

Wait, but wait a second, that's the cost of goods sold. So that's the expense related to the food. But the restaurant also has other expenses: rent, salaries, supplies, and miscellaneous.

So total expenses would be COGS plus all those other expenses. Let me add them up.

COGS: $2,221.18
Rent: $175.00
Salaries: $580.15
Supplies: $89.47
Miscellaneous: $50.83

Adding them all together. Let's do it step by step:

Start with COGS: 2221.18

Add rent: 2221.18 + 175 = 2396.18

Add salaries: 2396.18 + 580.15 = 2976.33

Add supplies: 2976.33 + 89.47 = 3065.80

Add miscellaneous: 3065.80 + 50.83 = 3116.63

Wait, so total expenses are $3,116.63.

Now, sales are $4,501.16. So net profit is sales minus total expenses.

So 4501.16 - 3116.63 = ?

Let me compute that. 4501.16 minus 3000 is 1501.16. Then minus 116.63: 1501.16 - 116.63 = 1384.53.

Wait, that gives me $1,384.53 as the net profit. But let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the expenses. Let me add them again.

COGS: 2221.18

Plus rent (175) → 2396.18

Plus salaries (580.15) → 2396.18 + 580.15 = 2976.33

Plus supplies (89.47) → 2976.33 + 89.47 = 3065.80

Plus misc (50.83) → 3065.80 +50.83= 3116.63. That's correct.

Sales are 4501.16. So 4501.16 - 3116.63 = ?

Let me do it more accurately:

4501.16
-3116.63
________
Compute each part:

4501.16 minus 3000 is 1501.16.

Now subtract 116.63 from 1501.16.

1501.16 - 100 = 1401.16

1401.16 - 16.63 = 1384.53.

Yes, that's correct. So the net profit is $1,384.53.

Looking at the options, option I is $1,384.53, which matches. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: $2,768.49

B: $2,221.18

C: $1,750.00

D: $2,995.67

E: $3,116.63

F: $4,501.16

G: $3,000.42

H: $1,982.34

I: $1,384.53

J: $2,500.00

So yes, option I is the correct answer.

To calculate the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant in October, we start by determining the cost of goods sold (COGS). COGS is calculated as:

\[
\text{COGS} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{COGS} = \$609.31 + \$1,827.63 - \$215.76 = \$2,221.18
\]

Next, we calculate the total expenses by adding COGS to the other expenses:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{COGS} + \text{Rent} + \text{Salaries} + \text{Supplies} + \text{Miscellaneous Expenses}
\]

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \$2,221.18 + \$175.00 + \$580.15 + \$89.47 + \$50.83 = \$3,116.63
\]

The net profit is then calculated as total sales minus total expenses:

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Sales} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$4,501.16 - \$3,116.63 = \$1,384.53
\]

Thus, the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant in October is **$1,384.53**, which corresponds to option I.
