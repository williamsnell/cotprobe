Question:

Clare manages a piano store. Her utility function is given by Utility = w - 100, where w is the total of all monetary payments to her and 100 represents the monetary equivalent of the disutility of exerting effort to run the store. Her next best alternative to managing the store gives her zero utility. The store's revenue depends on random factors, with an equal chance of being $1,000 or $400. If shareholders offered to share half of the store's revenue with her, what would her expected utility be?

Options:

A: 300
B: 225
C: 100
D: 450
E: 350
F: 250
G: 150
H: 200
I: 500
J: 400

Okay, so I have this economics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to utility functions and expected utilities, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Clare manages a piano store, and her utility function is given by Utility = w - 100. Here, w is the total of all monetary payments she receives, and the 100 represents the disutility (or the negative utility) from the effort she puts into running the store. Her next best alternative gives her zero utility, which I think means if she doesn't manage the store, she gets zero utility.

The store's revenue is random. It can be either $1,000 or $400, each with an equal chance. So that's a 50% probability each. Now, the shareholders are offering to share half of the store's revenue with her. So she'll get half of whatever the revenue is. I need to calculate her expected utility under this new arrangement.

First, let's break down what her current situation is and what the change means. Without the shareholders' offer, I assume Clare keeps all the revenue. But wait, the question is about her utility, which depends on her monetary payments (w). So when they offer to share half the revenue, that changes her w.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If she's the manager, maybe she's getting some payment from the revenue. The current setup isn't entirely clear, but the problem states that under the shareholders' offer, she will get half the revenue. So previously, perhaps she was getting a different share, maybe all of it? Or was she on a fixed wage? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but it says her utility is based on w, which is all monetary payments to her. So before the offer, her w would be the entire revenue? Or was she getting some fixed amount?

Wait, the problem says, "the shareholders offered to share half of the store's revenue with her." So I think that means she's getting half, whereas before she might have been getting a different amount. But the problem doesn't specify her previous arrangement, so maybe I should assume that prior to the offer, she was getting a certain amount, but perhaps for this problem, we can model her new w as half the revenue.

Wait, no, the utility function is based on w, which is all monetary payments to her. So under the shareholders' offer, her w would be half the revenue. So in the two possible scenarios, she would receive half of $1000 or half of $400.

So let's calculate those two amounts.

If revenue is $1000, she gets $500 (half). If it's $400, she gets $200. Each has a 50% chance.

Now, her utility is w minus 100. So for each scenario, we calculate the utility.

First scenario: w = $500.
Utility = 500 - 100 = 400.

Second scenario: w = $200.
Utility = 200 - 100 = 100.

Wait, but what about her next best alternative? It gives her zero utility. So if the expected utility from managing the store is less than zero, she would prefer her next best alternative. But in this case, since both scenarios give positive utilities (400 and 100), the expected utility will be positive, so she would accept the offer.

Now, to compute the expected utility. Since each outcome is equally likely, we take the average.

So expected utility = (0.5 * 400) + (0.5 * 100) = 200 + 50 = 250.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is 250. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The revenue is either 1000 or 400, each with 0.5 probability. She gets half, so 500 and 200. Then utility is each minus 100.

So 500-100=400, 200-100=100. Then expected utility is (400 + 100)/2 = 500/2=250. So yes, 250.

So the correct answer is F: 250.

Clare's utility function is given by \( \text{Utility} = w - 100 \), where \( w \) represents the total monetary payments she receives, and the 100 accounts for the disutility of running the store. The store's revenue is random, with an equal chance of being $1,000 or $400. Shareholders offer to share half of the revenue with her, meaning her payment \( w \) would be half of the revenue in each scenario.

1. If the revenue is $1,000, Clare receives \( w = \frac{1,000}{2} = 500 \). Her utility is \( 500 - 100 = 400 \).
2. If the revenue is $400, Clare receives \( w = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \). Her utility is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \).

Since each revenue outcome has an equal probability of 0.5, the expected utility is calculated as:
\[
\text{Expected Utility} = (0.5 \times 400) + (0.5 \times 100) = 200 + 50 = 250.
\]

Thus, Clare's expected utility under the shareholders' offer is 250.

F: 250
