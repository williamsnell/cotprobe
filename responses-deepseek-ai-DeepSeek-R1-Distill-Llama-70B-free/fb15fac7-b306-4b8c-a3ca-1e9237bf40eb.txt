Okay, so I have this question about the Yang-shao culture and when it gave way to the Lung-Shan culture. I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Yang-shao and Lung-Shan are both Neolithic cultures in China. Yang-shao is known for its painted pottery, right? And Lung-Shan is associated with black pottery. I think Lung-Shan came after Yang-shao.

Now, I need to figure out when Yang-shao ended and Lung-Shan began. I recall that Yang-shao dates back to around 5000 BCE to 3000 BCE. So that's approximately 7,000 to 5,000 years before present (BP). Wait, but wait, BP is counted from 1950, so 5000 BCE would be about 7,000 BP. So Yang-shao was from around 7,000 BP to maybe 5,000 BP. 

Then, Lung-Shan culture comes after that. I think Lung-Shan is around 2500 BCE to 2000 BCE. Let me convert that to BP. 2500 BCE would be roughly 4,500 BP, and 2000 BCE is about 4,000 BP. So Lung-Shan would be from around 4,500 BP to 4,000 BP.

So the transition from Yang-shao to Lung-Shan would have happened somewhere around 5,000 BP or maybe a bit later. Looking at the options, let's see:

The options given are A to J. The options around that time are:

H: 5,000 BP

J: 4,000 BP

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the dates might be a bit off. I think Yang-shao ended around 3000 BCE, which is 5,000 BP. So the Lung-Shan would have started after that, maybe around 2500 BCE, which is 4,500 BP. So the transition is around 5,000 BP? Or perhaps a little later.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the Yang-shao is split into early and late phases. The late Yang-shao might have ended around 4,000 BP. So the transition to Lung-Shan would be after that. So maybe the correct answer is around 4,000 BP? But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is around 5,000 BP, which is option H. But I'm a bit unclear. I think I need to remember that Yang-shao culture flourished from around 7,000 to 5,000 BP. So the Lung-Shan would have started after 5,000 BP. So the transition is after 5,000 BP. So the question is asking when Yang-shao gave way to Lung-Shan, so that would be around 5,000 BP, but I'm not certain.

Wait another angle: I've heard that the Lung-Shan culture is sometimes referred to as the 'Black Pottery Culture' and is dated to around 2500–2000 BCE. That would be 4,500 to 4,000 BP. So Yang-shao must have ended before that. So the transition happened after Yang-shao, which was say up to 5,000 BP. So the transition is around 5,000 BP.

Looking back at the options, option H is 5,000 BP. But wait, the question says the Yang-shao gave way to Lung-Shan sometime after a certain date. So the Lung-Shan starts after Yang-shao ends. If Yang-shao ends around 5,000 BP, then the transition is after that. So the correct answer would be H:5,000 BP.

But wait, another possibility: Yang-shao might have ended later. For example, some sources say Yang-shao is from c. 5000–3000 BCE, which is 7,000–5,000 BP. So the Lung-Shan starts around 3000 BCE, which is 5,000 BP. So the transition is after 5,000 BP. So the Yang-shao ended around 5,000 BP, so the transition is after that. So the answer would be H:5,000 BP.

Alternatively, maybe the transition is a bit later, but I think 5,000 BP is the correct option here.

The Yang-shao culture, known for its painted pottery, flourished from approximately 7,000 BP to 5,000 BP. The Lung-Shan culture, associated with black pottery, emerged after the decline of Yang-shao. Based on the timeline, Yang-shao ended around 5,000 BP, and Lung-Shan began shortly after. Therefore, the transition from Yang-shao to Lung-Shan occurred sometime after 5,000 BP.

The correct answer is **H: 5,000 B.P.**.
