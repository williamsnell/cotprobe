Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to special relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: A meter stick with a speed of 0.8c moves past an observer. In the observer’s reference frame, how long does it take the stick to pass the observer?

And the options are from A to J, each with different nanosecond values. Hmm, right, so I need to find the time it takes for the entire stick to pass by the observer according to the observer's frame.

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, when objects move at significant fractions of the speed of light, length contraction occurs. But wait, from whose perspective? Oh right, the observer sees the moving objects as length-contracted. So the stick isn't a meter long in their frame.

So the stick is moving at 0.8c relative to the observer. The proper length (the length at rest) of the stick is 1 meter, I assume, because it's a meter stick. So the observer will see it as shorter than a meter.

The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length. Let me calculate that.

v is 0.8c, so v squared over c squared is 0.64. So 1 - 0.64 is 0.36. The square root of 0.36 is 0.6. So L = 1m * 0.6 = 0.6 meters. So the length of the stick in the observer's frame is 0.6 meters.

Now, the time it takes to pass the observer. Well, the stick is moving at 0.8c, right? So the time should be the contracted length divided by the speed.

Wait, but wait. The observer is stationary, and the stick is moving. So from the observer's point of view, the stick is moving past them. So the time it takes is the length of the stick (as seen by the observer) divided by the speed of the stick.

So the length is 0.6 meters, speed is 0.8c. Let me plug in the numbers.

Time t = 0.6 m / (0.8 * c). I know that c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So let me compute that.

0.6 / 0.8 = 0.75. So t = 0.75 / (3e8) seconds.

Wait, wait, no: 0.6 / (0.8 * 3e8) = (0.6 / 0.8) * (1 / 3e8) = 0.75 * (1 / 3e8) = 0.25e-8 seconds. Because 0.75/3 is 0.25.

Wait, 0.75 divided by 3 is 0.25, yes. So 0.25e-8 seconds is 2.5e-9 seconds, which is 2.5 nanoseconds.

Looking at the options, H is 2.5 ns, so that must be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I forget anything? Like, proper time, or maybe the stick's own time? No, because the question asks for the time in the observer's frame. So the stick's length is contracted, and the speed is as per the observer, so the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the time taken is the time it takes for both ends of the stick to pass the observer. The front end passes first, then the back end. The distance between the two events (front passing and back passing) is the contracted length, so the time is that distance divided by the relative speed.

Yes, that makes sense. So the calculation seems correct. So the answer is H.

To determine how long it takes the meter stick to pass the observer in the observer's reference frame, we use the concept of length contraction from special relativity. The proper length of the stick is \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \), and it moves at a speed \( v = 0.8c \). The contracted length \( L \) in the observer's frame is given by:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 0.8c \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.64, \quad 1 - 0.64 = 0.36, \quad \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6
\]

Thus, the contracted length is:

\[
L = 1 \, \text{m} \times 0.6 = 0.6 \, \text{m}
\]

The time it takes for the stick to pass the observer is the contracted length divided by the speed of the stick:

\[
t = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{0.6}{0.8c}
\]

Since \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we compute:

\[
t = \frac{0.6}{0.8 \times 3 \times 10^8} = \frac{0.6}{2.4 \times 10^8} = 2.5 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s} = 2.5 \, \text{ns}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **H: 2.5 ns**.
