Okay, so I've got this mass transfer problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves an air stream flowing over a smooth solid naphthalene plate. The velocity is 116 ft/sec, and the pressure is 1 atm. The temperature is given as 115°F. They want me to find four things: the average coefficient of mass transfer, the average mass transfer rate per unit width, the local coefficient at 1.5 ft, and the local concentration gradient there.

Hmm, I remember that mass transfer coefficients can be found using analogies to heat transfer, like the Reynolds analogy. Since the problem mentions a turbulent boundary layer from the leading edge, I think that suggests that the flow is entirely turbulent, so I don't have to worry about a laminar region.

Wait, for a flat plate, the average mass transfer coefficient for a turbulent flow can be calculated using a correlation. I think the correlation is something like the Chilton-Colburn analogy, which relates the Sherwood number (Sh) to the Reynolds number (Re) and the Schmidt number (Sc). The formula is Sh = (kx)/D = 0.023 Re^0.83 Sc^(1/3), but wait, I might be mixing this up. Or was it Sh = 0.023 Re^0.83 Sc^(0.44) for some cases? No, no, I think when the Schmidt number is much greater than 1, the exponent is 1/3. But the problem says the influence of non-unity Schmidt number is negligible, so maybe Sc is considered 1 here? Or perhaps that the effect is small, so we can treat it with Sc^(1/3) but knowing that Sc for air-naphthalene might not be 1.

Wait, maybe I should first compute the necessary properties. Let me think about the properties of air and naphthalene at 115°F. Oh wait, naphthalene's vapor pressure is important here. But wait, for the mass transfer coefficient, I think I need the diffusion coefficient (D) of naphthalene in air. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up or calculate the Schmidt number for air at these conditions.

Let me convert the temperature first. 115°F to Celsius is (115-32)*(5/9) = 63.89°C. So about 64°C. The air is at 1 atm.

I need to find the kinematic viscosity of air at 115°F. I think the viscosity of air increases with temperature. Let me recall the values. At 20°C, the viscosity is about 1.20e-5 kg/(m·s). At higher temps, it's higher. Maybe around 2.3e-5 kg/(m·s) at 64°C? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it using Sutherland's formula, but that might be more detailed than I can handle right now.

Alternatively, I can look for the kinematic viscosity of air at 115°F. Wait, 115°F is 46.1°C. Let me think again: 1 atm, 46°C. Viscosity of air at 0°C is about 1.71e-5 kg/(m·s), and it increases with temperature. Let me check some reference points. Maybe at 20°C, it's 1.80e-5, and at about 50°C, it's around 2.0e-5. So at 46°C, perhaps around 1.95e-5 kg/(m·s). But wait, I'm getting confused between dynamic viscosity (mu) and kinematic viscosity (nu). Oh right, kinematic viscosity nu = mu / rho.

Wait, but if I can find the kinematic viscosity, that would help. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the Schmidt number for naphthalene in air at this temperature.

Wait, another approach. The Schmidt number Sc is mu/(rho D), where D is the diffusion coefficient. But if the Schmidt number's influence is negligible, perhaps the problem is assuming Sc = 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the given options already account for it, so I can proceed without it. But I'm not certain. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that the influence of non-unity Schmidt number is negligible. So perhaps that term can be treated as 1, so Sc^(1/3) = 1. So the Sherwood number would be Sh = 0.023 Re^0.83.

But wait, the standard correlation for turbulent flow over a flat plate is Sh = (k_x)/D = 0.023 Re_L^0.83 Sc^(1/3), where L is the length. But if Sc's effect is negligible, then it's just Sh = 0.023 Re^0.83.

Wait, but Sc is the Schmidt number, which is mu/(rho D). So if Sc isn't 1, then it would affect the calculation. But the problem says its influence is negligible, perhaps meaning that Sc^(1/3) ≈ 1, so Sc is close to 1. So maybe I can ignore it, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the Schmidt number is considered to be 1. So let's proceed under that assumption.

So first, I need to compute the Reynolds number for the plate length of 1.5 ft. The Reynolds number Re = (u_infinity * L) / nu, where u_infinity is the free stream velocity, L is the length, and nu is the kinematic viscosity.

But I don't have nu. So I need to find nu for air at 115°F (46.1°C). Let me try to get that value. I think that at 20°C, nu_air is about 1.5e-4 ft²/s. At higher temperatures, nu increases. Maybe I can find a table or use an approximation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for kinematic viscosity of air as a function of temperature. Let me see. The kinematic viscosity of air can be approximated with the equation:

nu = 0.00000134 * (T^(1.5)) / (T + 111) 

where T is in Kelvin. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I remember that the viscosity of air increases with temperature, and so does the kinematic viscosity since density decreases with temperature.

Wait, let me try this approach. Let me convert 115°F to Kelvin. 115°F = (115 + 459.67) = 574.67 R, which is 574.67 * (5/9) ≈ 319.26 K.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Sutherland formula for dynamic viscosity:

mu = 1.46e-6 * (T^1.5)/(T + 111)

where T is in Kelvin.

So T = 115°F = 46.1°C = 319.26 K.

So, mu = 1.46e-6 * (319.26^1.5)/(319.26 + 111)

Let me compute 319.26^1.5 first. 319.26^1 = 319.26, sqrt(319.26) ≈ 17.86. So 319.26^1.5 ≈ 319.26 *17.86 ≈ 5703.3.

Now denominator is 319.26 + 111 = 430.26.

So mu ≈ 1.46e-6 * 5703.3 / 430.26.

Compute numerator: 1.46e-6 * 5703.3 ≈ 8.32e-3.

Divide by 430.26: 8.32e-3 / 430.26 ≈ 1.93e-5 kg/(m·s).

Wait no, because that's in SI units. Wait, but the units need to be consistent. Let me make sure about the units. 1.46e-6 is in (Pa·s)^(1/2)/(K^(1/2)), but perhaps it's easier to compute the dynamic viscosity in kg/(m·s).

So, mu ≈ 1.93e-5 kg/(m·s).

Now, to find the kinematic viscosity, nu = mu / rho.

The density of air at 1 atm and 319.26 K. Using the ideal gas law, rho = P/(R*T), where P is 1 atm = 101325 Pa, R is 287 J/kg·K (specific gas constant for air).

So, rho = 101325 / (287 * 319.26) ≈ 101325 / (91570) ≈ 1.106 kg/m³.

So, nu = mu / rho = (1.93e-5 kg/(m·s)) / (1.106 kg/m³) ≈ 1.74e-5 m²/s.

Wait, but the units in the problem are ft, so I should convert this to ft²/s. Since 1 m ≈ 3.28084 ft, so 1 m² = (3.28084)^2 ft² ≈ 10.7639 ft². So 1.74e-5 m²/s = 1.74e-5 * 10.7639 ft²/s ≈ 1.873e-4 ft²/s.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. 1.74e-5 m²/s is equal to 0.0000174 m²/s. Multiply by 10.7639 ft²/m² gives approximately 0.0001873 ft²/s, which is 1.873e-4 ft²/s. So yes, that's correct.

So, nu_air = 1.873e-4 ft²/s.

Now, the Reynolds number Re = (u * L) / nu.

u is 116 ft/s, L is 1.5 ft.

So Re = (116 * 1.5) / (1.873e-4) = 174 / 0.0001873 ≈ 174 / 0.0001873.

Let me compute that: 174 divided by 0.0001873.

Let me compute 174 / 0.0001873.

First, 174 / 0.0001873 = (174 / 1.873) * 1e4.

174 / 1.873 ≈ 92.8.

So, 92.8e4 = 928,000.

So Re ≈ 928,000.

Wait, that's a pretty high Reynolds number, but for 1.5 ft at 116 ft/s, it makes sense. Now, since the flow is turbulent, the Sherwood number correlation applies.

So, Sh = 0.023 * Re^0.83 * Sc^(1/3).

But the problem says the influence of non-unity Sc is negligible, so Sc^(1/3) ≈ 1. So Sh = 0.023 * (Re)^0.83.

So, let's compute Sh.

Re is 928,000, so Re^0.83. Let me compute that.

Wait, 10^6 would have Re^0.83 = (1e6)^0.83 = 1e4.83 ≈ 6.9e4. But Re is 0.928e6, so 0.928^0.83 is approximately 0.928^0.8 ≈ 0.92. So Re^0.83 ≈ 0.928^0.83 * 1e6^0.83 ≈ 0.93 * 6.9e4 ≈ 6.4e4.

So 0.023 * 6.4e4 ≈ 1,472.

So Sh = 1,472.

But Sh is also (k_x * L)/D, so k_x = (Sh * D) / L.

Wait, but I don't know D, the diffusion coefficient of naphthalene in air. Hmm, that's a problem. I need to find D for naphthalene in air at 115°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Schmidt number approach. Since Sc = mu/(rho D), so D = mu/(rho Sc). But if Sc is considered 1, then D = mu/(rho). Wait, but that's only if Sc=1, which the problem says its influence is negligible. Hmm, perhaps that's a stretch, but let's proceed.

Wait, mu is 1.93e-5 kg/(m·s), and rho is 1.106 kg/m³.

So D = mu/(rho * Sc). If Sc is considered 1, then D = 1.93e-5 / 1.106 ≈ 1.74e-5 m²/s.

Wait, but that's the same as the kinematic viscosity, which would make Sc=1. So perhaps under the assumption that Sc=1, D = nu.

So, going back, Sh = (k_x L) / D, and if D=nu, then Sh = (k_x L)/nu.

But wait, earlier I found Sh as 1,472, so k_x = (Sh * nu) / L.

Wait, let's compute that.

nu = 1.873e-4 ft²/s.

k_x = (1472 * 1.873e-4) / 1.5.

Compute numerator: 1472 * 1.873e-4 ≈ 0.275.

Divide by 1.5: 0.275 / 1.5 ≈ 0.183 ft/s.

Wait, but wait, the units of k_x should be in ft/s, since Sh is dimensionless, and L is in ft, D in ft²/s, so (ft²/s * ft) = ft³/s, and dividing by L (ft) gives ft²/s, but wait, no, Sh is (k_x L)/D, which would be (ft/s * ft) / (ft²/s) )= (ft²/s * ft) / ft²/s = ft/s * ft * s/ft² => ft/s * s/ft => unitless. So correct.

So k_x comes out to 0.183 ft/s. But wait, looking at the options, the values are in the hundreds of ft/hr. So I need to convert this to ft/hr.

1 ft/s is 3600 ft/hr. So 0.183 ft/s * 3600 ≈ 659.28 ft/hr.

Wait, but that's the local coefficient at 1.5 ft. Wait, but the problem part (a) is asking for the average coefficient over the first 1.5 ft. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, because I used the Sherwood number correlation which gives the local k_x at position L, but the average k would be different. For a flat plate with turbulent flow, the average mass transfer coefficient is higher than the local at the end. Because the transfer coefficient increases with distance.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The average mass transfer coefficient for a plate of length L in turbulent flow is given by integrating the local k from 0 to L.

The local k_x is proportional to x^(-0.17), since from Sh = 0.023 Re^0.83, and Re = (u x)/nu, so Re^0.83 = (u^0.83 x^0.83)/(nu^0.83). So Sh = 0.023 (u^0.83 x^0.83)/(nu^0.83) Sc^(1/3). Then, since Sh = (k_x x)/D, then k_x = (Sh D)/x = (0.023 (u^0.83 x^0.83)/(nu^0.83) Sc^(1/3) D ) / x = 0.023 u^0.83 x^(-0.17) (D Sc^(1/3))/(nu^0.83).

But under the assumption that Sc is 1, and D=nu, this simplifies to k_x = 0.023 u^0.83 x^(-0.17) (nu)/(nu^0.83) ) = 0.023 u^0.83 x^(-0.17) nu^0.17.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the average coefficient is given by (1/L) ∫0^L k_x dx. Since k_x ∝ x^(-0.17), the integral would be ∝ x^(0.83), so the average would be (k_x at L) * (0.83/(1 + 0.83)). Wait, maybe it's (1/(1 - 0.17)) * k_L, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the average is the same as the local at some position. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the average Sherwood number for turbulent flow. I think the average Sherwood number for a flat plate in turbulent flow (assuming Re_L > 5e5) is given by Sh_avg = 0.023 Re_L^0.83 Sc^(1/3) * (1 + (0.5 Re_L^0.7)/Re_L)) ?

Wait, no, perhaps the average is the same as the local at L, multiplied by a factor. Alternatively, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to use the correlation for average mass transfer coefficient.

Wait, I recall that for the average Nusselt number in turbulent flow, it's Nu_avg = 0.023 Re_L^0.83 Pr^(1/3) * (1 + (some term)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should refer back to the fact that the average Sherwood number is the same as the local Sherwood number at L multiplied by a certain factor. Let me think about the integral.

If the local k_x varies as x^(-0.17), then the average k_avg would be higher than k_L, because the initial values are higher. Wait, no, if k_x decreases with x, then the average would be less than the maximum, which is at x=0, but that's not possible. Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the average mass transfer coefficient is given by the same formula as the local, but with Re based on L. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps for average, we use the same formula but with Re_L. Let me think: if Sh_avg = (k_avg L)/D = 0.023 Re_L^0.83 Sc^(1/3), which would be the same as the local Sh at L. But that can't be, because then k_avg would equal k_L, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the average Sherwood number is actually Sh_avg = 0.023 Re_L^0.83 Sc^(1/3) * (Re_L / (Re_L - something))), but I can't remember.

Alternatively, perhaps the average coefficient is the same as the local at L multiplied by (1 + 0.17), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I
