Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there's a charge distribution that's spherically symmetric but not uniform radially. Hmm, spherical symmetry usually means that the charge density depends only on the radial distance r from the center, right? And non-uniform radial distribution implies that the density changes with r, not just a constant.

The electric field produced by this charge is given as E = K r^4, directed radially outward. So E depends on r to the fourth power. I remember that the electric field inside a uniformly charged sphere is different, but here it's not uniform, so I can't directly apply that formula.

I think I should use Gauss's Law here. Gauss's Law is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, where Φ is the electric flux through a Gaussian surface. For a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r, the electric field is uniform over the surface, so Φ = E * 4πr².

So, Φ = E * 4πr² = K r^4 * 4π r² = 4π K r^6. Wait, no, wait. Because E is K r^4, so substituting that in, Φ would be 4π r² * K r^4 = 4π K r^6. Hmm, wait, no, wait again. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the electric field E is given as K r^4, which is the magnitude. So Φ is E multiplied by the area of the sphere. The area is 4πr², so Φ = (K r^4) * 4π r² = 4π K r^6. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the units might not match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. E is in newtons per coulomb (N/C), which is volts per meter (V/m). The flux Φ is in V·m (since electric field is V/m multiplied by m²). So when you multiply E (V/m) by area (m²), you get V·m, which is correct.

But Gauss's Law says that Φ equals Q_enc over ε₀. So Q_enc is the total charge inside radius r, which is the integral of the charge density ρ(r) multiplied by the volume element. Since it's spherically symmetric, ρ depends only on r, so the charge enclosed is the integral from 0 to r of ρ(r') * 4π r'² dr'.

So, Φ = (1/ε₀) ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r') 4π r'² dr'.

Putting it all together, Φ = 4π K r^6 (from earlier) equals (1/ε₀) times the integral of ρ(r') 4π r'² dr'.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Φ I calculated earlier is 4π K r^6. But that's for the Gaussian surface at radius r. So:

4π K r^6 = (1/ε₀) * ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r') 4π r'² dr'

Hmm, I can simplify this equation. Let me divide both sides by 4π:

K r^6 = (1/ε₀) ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r') r'² dr'

So, to find ρ(r), I need to take the derivative of both sides with respect to r because the integral is from 0 to r. Taking the derivative d/dr would give me the integrand evaluated at r.

So, take d/dr of both sides:

d/dr [ K r^6 ] = d/dr [ (1/ε₀) ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r') r'² dr' ]

On the left side, the derivative is 6 K r^5.

On the right side, the derivative of the integral from 0 to r of something is just that something evaluated at r, so:

6 K r^5 = (1/ε₀) * ρ(r) * r²

Wait, because when you take d/dr of ∫0^r f(r') dr', you get f(r). So here, f(r) is ρ(r) * r². So yes, the right side becomes (1/ε₀) * ρ(r) * r².

So rearranging:

ρ(r) = (6 K r^5 * ε₀) / r²

Simplify that: 6 K ε₀ r^(5-2) = 6 K ε₀ r^3.

Wait, so ρ(r) is proportional to r^3. Now looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 6 K ε₀ r^3.

Option I: 3 K ε₀ r^3.

Option F: 4 K ε₀ r^3.

Wait, so my calculation gives 6 K ε₀ r^3, which would be option G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, so Gauss's Law: Φ = E * 4π r² = K r^4 * 4π r² = 4π K r^6.

Yes.

Then, Q_enc = ∫0^r ρ(r') 4π r'^2 dr' = 4π ∫0^r ρ(r') r'^2 dr'

So 4π K r^6 = Q_enc / ε₀ → 4π K r^6 = (1/ε₀) * 4π ∫0^r ρ(r') r'^2 dr'

Divide both sides by 4π: K r^6 = (1/ε₀) ∫0^r ρ(r') r'^2 dr'

Derivative of left side: 6 K r^5.

Derivative of right side: (1/ε₀) ρ(r) r^2.

So 6 K r^5 = (1/ε₀) ρ(r) r^2

Multiply both sides by ε₀: 6 K ε₀ r^5 = ρ(r) r^2 → ρ(r) = 6 K ε₀ r^3.

Yes, so option G is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we use Gauss's Law, which states:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

where \(\Phi\) is the electric flux through a Gaussian surface, \(Q_{\text{enc}}\) is the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, and \(\varepsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space. For a spherical Gaussian surface of radius \(r\), the electric flux is:

\[
\Phi = E \cdot 4\pi r^2
\]

The electric field is given as \(E = K r^4\), so:

\[
\Phi = (K r^4) \cdot 4\pi r^2 = 4\pi K r^6
\]

From Gauss's Law, the charge enclosed is:

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_0^r \rho(r') \cdot 4\pi r'^2 \, dr'
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\Phi\):

\[
4\pi K r^6 = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \int_0^r \rho(r') \cdot 4\pi r'^2 \, dr'
\]

Dividing through by \(4\pi\):

\[
K r^6 = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \int_0^r \rho(r') \cdot r'^2 \, dr'
\]

To find \(\rho(r)\), take the derivative of both sides with respect to \(r\):

\[
\frac{d}{dr} \left( K r^6 \right) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \cdot \rho(r) \cdot r^2
\]

The left-hand side is:

\[
\frac{d}{dr} \left( K r^6 \right) = 6K r^5
\]

Thus:

\[
6K r^5 = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \cdot \rho(r) \cdot r^2
\]

Rearranging for \(\rho(r)\):

\[
\rho(r) = \frac{6K \varepsilon_0 r^5}{r^2} = 6K \varepsilon_0 r^3
\]

Therefore, the volume charge density is \(\rho(r) = 6K \varepsilon_0 r^3\). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: \(6 K \varepsilon_0 r^3\)**.
