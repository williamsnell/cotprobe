Question:

Options:

A: He claims he does not understand such a property.
B: He claims that his theory is still in the process of development.
C: None of the above.
D: He claims to have proven that such a property does not exist.
E: He claims that the objection is irrelevant to his theory.
F: He claims that such a property is subjective, not objective.
G: He claims that the objection is based on a misunderstanding.
H: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.
I: He does not respond to the objection.
J: He claims that his theory does account for this kind of goodness.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how Stevenson responds to this objection about his theory not accounting for objective, a priori goodness. Hmm, I remember Stevenson was a moral philosopher, probably associated with emotivism or something like that. His theory likely focuses on how moral statements are expressions of emotion or attitudes rather than objective facts.

The question is about an objection that his theory doesn't handle a specific kind of goodnessâ€”objective and known a priori. So, the objector is saying that Stevenson's theory can't explain this type of goodness because it's more about subjective feelings or personal preferences.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says he claims he doesn't understand the property. I don't think Stevenson would say that; he probably addresses it but maybe dismisses it. Option B is about his theory still developing, but I don't recall him using that as a response. Option C is "None of the above," which I might have to consider if the other options don't fit.

Option D suggests he proves the property doesn't exist. That's possible if he's arguing against objective moral properties. Option E says the objection is irrelevant, which could be if he thinks his theory isn't about that kind of goodness. Option F claims the property is subjective, which aligns with emotivism since he'd say goodness is a matter of attitude, not objective fact.

Option G says the objection is based on a misunderstanding. Maybe he thinks the critic is wrong about what his theory covers. Option H claims he has accounted for it, which would mean he has an explanation, but I'm not sure. Option I says he doesn't respond, which might not be the case since he addresses criticisms. Option J says his theory does account for it, which would be similar to H.

Wait, in Stevenson's work, like in "Ethics and Language," he talks about 'goodness' as an emotive term that expresses approval. He might argue that objective goodness isn't necessary because morality is about attitudes. So when faced with the objection that his theory can't explain objective a priori goodness, he might respond by saying that such goodness isn't objective but rather subjective, or that it's based on a misunderstanding of his theory.

Alternatively, he might argue that the objection is irrelevant because his theory is about how people use moral language, not about some objective properties. Or he could claim that his theory doesn't need to account for that because it's not part of his concern.

But I think the key is that emotivists like Stevenson don't believe in objective moral properties. So when someone says his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, he probably responds by saying that such objective properties don't exist or that the goodness in question is actually subjective.

Looking back at the options, option F says he claims the property is subjective, which fits. Alternatively, option D says he claims it doesn't exist. I'm a bit torn between F and D.

But wait, does Stevenson argue that objective goodness doesn't exist, or does he say that it's not the kind of thing his theory is about? If the objection is that his theory doesn't account for it, Stevenson's response might be that such objective goodness isn't real, so his theory correctly doesn't include it. Or he might say that the objection misunderstands his theory, perhaps thinking he's trying to explain something he's not.

Alternatively, he might argue that all goodness is subjective, so the objection is based on a false premise. So option F would be correct in that case.

Alternatively, if he thinks the objection is irrelevant because his theory isn't about objective properties, that would be option E. But I'm not sure if that's his stance.

Wait, another angle: Stevenson's theory is about moral language being used to express attitudes and influence others. If someone objects that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, he might respond that his theory isn't concerned with that because goodness is a matter of subjective preference or attitude. So that would align with option F.

So I think the correct answer is F: He claims that such a property is subjective, not objective.

Stevenson's response to the objection that his theory does not account for objective, a priori goodness aligns with his emotivist perspective. He argues that moral terms like "goodness" are used to express subjective attitudes or emotions rather than to describe objective properties. Therefore, when faced with the objection, Stevenson would likely claim that such goodness is subjective, not objective.

The answer is F.
