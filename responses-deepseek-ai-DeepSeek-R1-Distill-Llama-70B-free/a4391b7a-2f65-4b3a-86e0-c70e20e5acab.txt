Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question about research and development costs. Hmm, I remember that accounting for R&D can be a bit tricky because it's all about whether you expense the costs now or capitalize them for the future. 

The question is asking specifically about R&D costs that have no alternative future use. I think that means these costs won't be useful for any other projects or provide any future benefits beyond the current period. So, how should they be accounted for?

I recall that under GAAP (which I think stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), R&D costs are generally expensed as they are incurred. The reasoning is that R&D is considered to be a cost of doing business in the current period, and it's hard to predict future benefits. But wait, are there exceptions to this rule?

Oh right, there are certain situations where R&D costs can be capitalized. I think it's when the costs are associated with a specific project that has an alternative future use. For example, if a company is developing a new product that they plan to sell, and the project is expected to generate future cash flows, then those costs might be capitalized. But in this question, the R&D costs have no alternative future use, meaning they won't have any future benefits beyond the current period.

So if there's no future benefit, the costs can't be capitalized because there's nothing to amortize in the future. That would mean they should be expensed immediately. Let me look at the options again.

Option E says "Charging all costs to expense when incurred." That sounds right because if there's no future benefit, you can't defer the expense. 

Wait, what about the other options? Option D says capitalize all costs, which would be wrong here because there's no future use. Option A splits the costs, but why would you do that if they have no future benefit? Option B talks about a research and development reserve accountâ€”I'm not sure about that term. Maybe that's related to some other method, but I don't think that's the standard approach here.

Option C mentions accumulating costs in stockholders' equity. I think that's more related to deferred costs, but again, without future benefits, that doesn't make sense. Option F says capitalize until future benefits are known, then shift to expensing. But in this case, future benefits are already known to not exist, so that wouldn't apply.

The other options involve capitalizing some and expensing others based on success or management choice, but that doesn't fit because all these costs have no future use. So yes, the correct approach must be to expense all the costs when they're incurred.

So the answer should be E.

The correct approach to accounting for research and development (R&D) costs with no alternative future use is to expense all costs when they are incurred. Under GAAP, R&D costs are generally expensed as incurred because they are considered part of the current period's operations and it is often difficult to predict future benefits. When there is no alternative future use, capitalization is not appropriate since there are no future benefits to amortize. Among the options provided, only Option E aligns with this principle.

Answer: E
