Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

If you rub your eyes long and hard enough, you would eventuallysee some type of visual pattern. Explain this phenomenon.

Options:

A: The rubbing action generates light inside the eye
B: Pressure on the eye temporarily alters the shape of the cornea, leading to distorted visual signals.
C: The mechanical stimulation from rubbing triggers a reflex that causes the pupils to dilate and create patterned visuals.
D: Friction from rubbing generates heat, which causes the illusion of light patterns.
E: It happens due to the production of a natural hallucinogen when pressure is applied
F: The pressure causes the release of stored light energy in the eye
G: The pressure exerted on the eye stimulates the receptor nerve cells at the back of the retina, which normally respond to light, and their response to this pressure, when communicated to the visual area of the brain, produce the experience of light.
H: Rubbing the eyes causes a temporary change in blood flow to the visual cortex, resulting in visual phenomena.
I: The rubbing motion activates latent photoreceptor cells which produce the visual patterns.
J: The optic nerve is temporarily disoriented by the rubbing, resulting in random visual patterns.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why, when I rub my eyes really hard, I see some kind of visual patterns. I remember when I was a kid, I used to rub my eyes and see all these weird colors and squiggly lines. It was kind of cool but also a bit strange. I think it has something to do with how the eye works, but I'm not exactly sure.

So, I know that the eye has parts like the cornea, retina, and optic nerve. The cornea is the clear part at the front, and the retina is at the back with photoreceptor cells like rods and cones. These cells are supposed to detect light and send signals to the brain, which then interprets them as images.

When I rub my eyes, I'm applying pressure. I wonder what that pressure does. Maybe it affects the shape of the eye? Like, if I press on the eyeball, could that change the cornea's shape? I think the cornea's shape is important for focusing light, so if it changes, maybe it distorts vision. But wait, when my eyes are closed while rubbing, I'm not actually looking at anything. So maybe it's not about the cornea's focusing but something else.

Another thought: the retina has these photoreceptor cells. Normally, they respond to light. But if I press on the eye, could that physically stimulate them without light? Like, mechanical pressure causing them to fire? Because if they do, then the brain would think there's light hitting those cells, even though there isn't. So I might see flashes or patterns because the brain is interpreting those signals.

Let me think about the options given. Option A says the rubbing generates light inside the eye. That doesn't make much sense because I don't think friction or pressure creates light inside the eye. Maybe like how you can see sparks if you hit your eye, but that's different.

Option B suggests pressure alters the cornea's shape, causing distorted signals. But again, if my eyes are closed, the light isn't getting in, so maybe it's not about the cornea focusing light incorrectly. It might be more about the retina.

Option G says the pressure stimulates the receptor cells, which respond to light. So when these cells are pressed, they send signals to the brain as if light is present. That would make the brain create the illusion of light patterns. That sounds plausible.

Option C talks about pupils dilating due to reflex. I'm not sure about that. Dilating pupils might let in more light, but if my eyes are closed, it's dark anyway. So maybe that's not the main reason.

Option H mentions blood flow changes in the visual cortex. I think that's more related to other phenomena, like when you stand up too quickly and see spots. That's about blood flow to the eyes, but the visual cortex is in the brain. I'm not sure if rubbing affects that directly.

Option G seems to directly address the mechanical stimulation of the retina's cells. So when you press, the cells fire, sending signals that the brain interprets as light. That would explain the patterns.

The phenomenon of seeing visual patterns when rubbing the eyes is due to the mechanical stimulation of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. These cells, which normally respond to light, can be activated by the pressure from rubbing. This stimulation sends signals to the brain, which interprets them as light, resulting in the perception of patterns or flashes of light. This explanation aligns with the description provided in option G.
