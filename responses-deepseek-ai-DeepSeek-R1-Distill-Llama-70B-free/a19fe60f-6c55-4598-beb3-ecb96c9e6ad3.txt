Okay, so I have this question about social sanctions and thumb-sucking in kindergarten. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

The question says that children who suck their thumbs when they enter kindergarten are often teased or ridiculed. I need to determine what type of social sanction this is.

First, I remember that social sanctions are ways society enforces its norms. Sanctions can be positive or negative, and formal or informal. Positive means rewarding desired behavior, negative means punishing undesired behavior. Formal sanctions are official, like laws or rules enforced by authorities, while informal are more casual, like social disapproval or teasing.

So in this case, the kids are being teased. Teasing is not an official rule or punishment from someone in authority, like a teacher or principal. It's more from their peers. So that would be informal.

Now, the behavior is thumb-sucking, which is considered improper at that age. The kids are being ridiculed, which is a negative reaction. So it's a negative sanction.

Putting it together, the teasing is an informal negative sanction. So looking at the options:

Option F is Informal negative sanction. That must be the correct answer.

I don't think it's formal because it's not from an institution. And it's definitely negative because it's a punishment, not a reward. So F makes sense.

The question involves identifying the type of social sanction applied when children are teased for thumb-sucking in kindergarten. Social sanctions can be positive or negative and formal or informal. Teasing is an informal reaction from peers, not an official authority, and it negatively reinforces the behavior. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: Informal negative sanction.

Answer: F
