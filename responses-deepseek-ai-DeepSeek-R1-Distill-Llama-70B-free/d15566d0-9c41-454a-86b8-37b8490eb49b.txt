Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I have this quadratic equation to solve: x squared minus 7x minus 10 equals zero. Hmm, quadratic equations. I remember from class that there are a couple of ways to solve them. One is factoring, another is using the quadratic formula. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably try factoring because if it factors nicely, that's usually quicker. The equation is x² -7x -10 = 0. So I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add up to -7. Wait, no, because the middle term is -7x. So the coefficient is -7.

Let me think: factors of -10 could be (1 and -10), (-1 and 10), (2 and -5), (-2 and 5). Now I need the pair that adds up to -7. Let's see:

1 + (-10) = -9. Not -7. Hmm. 

What about 2 and -5? 2 + (-5) = -3. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I got the signs wrong. Because when you have a positive and a negative number, their sum depends on which is bigger. So let's think again:

Looking for two numbers where their product is -10 and sum is -7. Let me list them:

Suppose I take 5 and -2. 5 * (-2) = -10. And 5 + (-2) = 3. Oh wait, that's positive 3. But I need -7. So maybe if I reverse them: -5 and 2. Then -5 + 2 = -3. Closer, but not -7.

Wait, maybe 10 and -1. 10 * (-1) = -10, and 10 + (-1) = 9. Not it. Or -10 and 1: sum is -9. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check all possibilities again.

We have possible pairs (a, b) such that a * b = -10 and a + b = -7.

Let me try 2 and -5 again. 2 + (-5) = -3. No, not enough. What about 5 and -2? Sum is 3. No. 

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake. Is there a pair that adds to -7? Let's think differently. Let's suppose the factors are (x + a)(x + b) = 0. Then, expanding gives x² + (a + b)x + ab. Comparing to x² -7x -10, so ab = -10 and a + b = -7.

Wait, that means a and b are two numbers whose sum is -7 and product is -10. So perhaps a is -10 and b is 3. Because -10 + 3 = -7, and (-10)*3 = -30, which is wrong.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the quadratic formula if factoring is tricky. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a). For the equation ax² + bx + c = 0.

In this equation, a is 1, b is -7, c is -10. Plugging into the formula:

x = [7 ± sqrt( (-7)^2 -4*1*(-10) ) ] / (2*1)

Calculate discriminant: (-7)^2 is 49. 4*1*(-10) is -40. So sqrt(49 - (-40)) ?

Wait, no: the discriminant is b² -4ac. So 49 - (4 *1*(-10)) → 49 - (-40) = 49 +40 =89.

So sqrt(89) is an irrational number, approximately 9.433.

So x = [7 ± sqrt(89)] / 2.

Wait, but the options given are all integer solutions. Did I make a mistake in factoring? Because if the equation can't be factored with integers, then the solutions are irrational. But looking at the options, I don't see any that match [7±sqrt(89)]/2.

Wait, maybe I should check my factoring again. Let me try to factor x² -7x -10.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add to -7.

Wait, perhaps it's -5 and +2. Let's see: (-5) + 2 = -3. Not -7. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the discriminant for factoring. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier factoring attempts.

Wait another thought: Did I confuse the signs? Let me think again.

The equation is x² -7x -10.

So when factoring, we write it as (x + m)(x + n) = x² + (m +n)x + mn. So here, mn should be -10, and m +n should be -7.

So looking for m and n where m +n = -7 and mn = -10.

Possible pairs:

m = 5, n = -12 → sum -7? 5 + (-12) = -7. Oh wait, 5 * (-12) = -60, which is not -10. So no.

Wait, perhaps m=2, n=-5. 2 + (-5)= -3. Not -7.

Wait, maybe m=10, n=-17. Sum is -7? 10 + (-17)= -7. But 10*(-17)= -170, not -10.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it. So perhaps this quadratic doesn't factor nicely, which would mean that the solutions are irrational. But the options provided are all integer pairs.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic formula.

Let me re-calculate using the quadratic formula.

a = 1, b= -7, c= -10.

x = [7 ± sqrt( (-7)^2 -4*1*(-10) ) ] / 2

So compute discriminant: 49 - (4)(-10) = 49 +40 =89.

So sqrt(89) is about 9.433.

So the solutions are (7 +9.433)/2 ≈ 16.433/2 ≈8.216,

and (7-9.433)/2≈ (-2.433)/2≈-1.216.

Looking at the options, none of the pairs match these values.

Wait, the options are all integers. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the equation is x² -7x -10=0. Let me double-check.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should try the options given and see which pair satisfies the equation.

The options are:

A: 3,4 → Let's plug x=3: 9 -21 -10 = -22 ≠0. x=4:16-28-10= -22≠0. So A is wrong.

B:1,3. x=1: 1-7-10= -16 ≠0. x=3 same as A, so wrong.

C:4,6. x=4:16-28-10=-22≠0. x=6:36-42-10=-16≠0. So wrong.

D:6,1. Same as B, so no.

E:-5,-2. x=-5:25 +35 -10=50≠0. x=-2:4 +14 -10=8≠0.

F:-2,5. x=-2:4 +14 -10=8≠0. x=5:25-35-10=-20≠0.

G:7,9. x=7:49-49-10=-10≠0. x=9:81-63-10=8≠0.

H:5,2. x=5:25-35-10=-20≠0. x=2:4-14-10=-20≠0.

I:0,7. x=0:0 -0 -10=-10≠0. x=7:49-49-10=-10≠0.

Hmm, none of the options work. That's confusing. Did I make a mistake in the quadratic formula?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me re-read: x² -7x -10=0. Yeah.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me try completing the square.

The equation is x² -7x =10.

To complete the square, take half of 7, which is 3.5, square it to get 12.25.

So add 12.25 to both sides: x² -7x +12.25 =10 +12.25 → 22.25.

So left side is (x-3.5)^2 =22.25.

Take square roots: x-3.5 = ±√22.25 → ±4.5.

So x=3.5 ±4.5.

So solutions: 3.5+4.5=8 and 3.5-4.5= -1.

So x=8 and x=-1. So the roots are 8 and -1.

But looking at the options, none of them have 8 and -1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I copied the equation wrong. Let me check again: x² -7x -10=0. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect? Or maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me try factoring again. x² -7x -10. Let me think of factors of -10 that add up to -7.

Wait, maybe -5 and +2: -5 +2= -3. No. 5 and -2: sum is 3. No. 10 and -1: sum 9. No. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps 2 and -5? 2 + (-5)= -3. No. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the process. Let me try another approach. Let me use the quadratic formula again. Maybe I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, discriminant is b² -4ac = (-7)^2 -4(1)(-10) =49 +40=89. So sqrt(89) is correct.

So x=(7±sqrt(89))/2. Approximately, that's (7+9.433)/2≈8.216, and (7-9.433)/2≈-1.216.

So the solutions are approximately 8.216 and -1.216.

Looking at the options, none of them match these numbers. So perhaps the question has a typo, or the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the question.

Wait another thought: maybe the original equation was x² +7x -10=0? Let me check what that would give.

If equation is x² +7x -10=0, then discriminant is 49 +40=89, same as before. So same roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x² -7x +10=0. Let me try that.

x² -7x +10=0. Factoring: looking for two numbers that multiply to +10 and add to -7. Hmm, that would be -5 and -2. Because (-5)*(-2)=10, and -5 + (-2)=-7. So factors are (x-5)(x-2)=0. Solutions x=5 and x=2. So the roots are 5 and 2. Looking at the options, option H is 5,2. So that would fit.

Wait, but the original question was x² -7x -10=0. So perhaps I misread the equation? If it's x² -7x +10=0, then H would be correct.

But the given question is x² -7x -10=0, which doesn't factor with integers and has roots around 8 and -1. Since none of the options match that, perhaps the intended equation was x² -7x +10=0, and the correct answer is H:5,2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in trying to factor. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the equation as x² -7x -10=0.

Looking for factors of -10 that add to -7.

Wait, let's see: -10 can be written as (-2)*5. So -2 and 5. Their sum is (-2)+5=3. But we need sum of -7.

Wait, maybe (-5) and 2. Sum is (-5)+2=-3. No. Hmm.

Wait, maybe 10 and -1? Sum is 9. No.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since none of the options fit the equation as given, perhaps the intended equation was different. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the signs.

Wait, perhaps the equation is x² +7x -10=0. Let me check that.

x² +7x -10=0. Trying to factor: looking for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add to +7. So 10 and -1. 10 + (-1)=9. No. Or 5 and -2: 5-2=3. No. 2 and -5: 2-5=-3. No. So it doesn't factor easily either.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation was supposed to be x² -5x -6=0, which factors into (x-6)(x+1)=0, giving x=6 and x=-1. But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But looking back at the options, option F is (-2,5). Let me plug x=5 into x² -7x -10: 25-35-10=-20≠0. So no. x=-2:4+14-10=8≠0.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But in the context of a multiple-choice question, that's unlikely. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the quadratic formula. Maybe I confused the signs.

The formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a).

In this equation, a=1, b=-7, c=-10.

So x = [7 ± sqrt(49 -4*1*(-10))]/2.

Compute under the square root: 49 +40=89. So sqrt(89) is correct.

So x=(7±sqrt(89))/2. So approximately, 8.216 and -1.216.

Since none of the options have these, perhaps the question intended a different equation. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps the equation was x² -8x +10=0. Then discriminant would be 64-40=24. sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6). So solutions (8±2√6)/2=4±√6. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x² -7x +12=0, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the intended equation was x² -7x +10=0, which factors into (x-5)(x-2), giving roots 5 and 2, which is option H. So maybe that's the intended solution.

Given that, I think the intended correct answer is H:5,2. But wait, the equation given in the question is x² -7x -10=0, not +10. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but if forced to choose, the closest would be none. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended equation was x² -7x +10=0.

So I think the intended answer is H:5,2.
</think>

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 10 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -10\). Plugging these values into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-10)}}{2(1)}
\]

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-10) = 49 + 40 = 89
\]

Thus, the solutions are:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

Approximating \(\sqrt{89} \approx 9.433\), the solutions are:

\[
x \approx \frac{7 + 9.433}{2} \approx 8.216 \quad \text{and} \quad x \approx \frac{7 - 9.433}{2} \approx -1.216
\]

These solutions are irrational and do not match any of the provided integer options. However, if the equation was intended to be \(x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\), it would factor as \((x - 5)(x - 2) = 0\), giving integer solutions \(x = 5\) and \(x = 2\). This matches option **H: 5, 2**.

Given the provided options, it is likely that the intended equation was \(x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\), making the correct answer:

**H: 5, 2**
