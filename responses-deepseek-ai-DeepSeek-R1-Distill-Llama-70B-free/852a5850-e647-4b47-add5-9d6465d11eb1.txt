Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about when arrests can be made without a warrant. Hmm, I remember that usually, an arrest warrant is required, but there are exceptions. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which option is NOT a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant. So, the incorrect option is the answer.

Option A: A misdemeanor has occurred, and the officer believes the person did it. Wait, I think when a misdemeanor happens in the officer's presence, they can arrest without a warrant. So if the misdemeanor is committed in their presence, it's allowed. But what if it's not in their presence? Because I remember that for misdemeanors, the general rule is that the officer must witness it. So if the misdemeanor didn't happen in front of them, can they still arrest without a warrant? I'm a bit confused here. Because if it's a misdemeanor not in their presence, maybe they can't arrest without a warrant. So option A might be the incorrect one because it doesn't specify that the misdemeanor was in the presence.

Option B: Officer has probable cause that a felony occurred and the person did it. Oh, right, for felonies, even if the officer didn't see it, if they have probable cause, they can arrest without a warrant. So this is a valid circumstance, meaning option B is correct and not the answer to the question.

Option C: Arrest for a felony committed in the officer's presence. Yep, that's definitely allowed. Because if a felony happens right in front of them, they can make the arrest. So C is a correct circumstance, so not the answer.

Option D: Arrest for a misdemeanor that's a breach of peace and in the officer's presence. That makes sense. Breach of peace is a specific type of misdemeanor, and if it's happening right there, the officer can arrest without a warrant. So D is correct, not the answer.

Wait, going back to option A. It says a misdemeanor occurred and the officer believes the person did it. But it doesn't specify whether the misdemeanor was in the officer's presence. So if the misdemeanor wasn't in their presence, can they still make the arrest without a warrant? I think the rule is that for misdemeanors, the arrest without a warrant is only allowed if the officer witnesses it. Otherwise, they need a warrant. So option A doesn't mention the presence, which would make it an incorrect circumstance for a warrantless arrest. So the answer should be A.

The question asks which circumstance does **not** allow an arrest without a warrant. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: This states that a misdemeanor occurred and the officer believes the person committed it. However, it does **not** specify that the misdemeanor was committed in the officer's presence. Generally, warrantless arrests for misdemeanors are only allowed if the offense occurs in the officer's presence. Since this detail is missing, this circumstance does **not** justify a warrantless arrest. **This is the correct answer.**

- **Option B**: This describes a situation where an officer has probable cause to believe a felony occurred and that the person committed it. Warrantless arrests for felonies are allowed even if the officer did not witness the crime, as long as probable cause exists. **This is a valid circumstance.**

- **Option C**: This involves a felony committed in the officer's presence. Warrantless arrests are permitted in such cases. **This is a valid circumstance.**

- **Option D**: This describes a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and occurs in the officer's presence. Warrantless arrests are allowed for misdemeanors committed in the officer's presence, especially if they involve a breach of peace. **This is a valid circumstance.**

The only option that does **not** describe a valid circumstance for a warrantless arrest is **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
