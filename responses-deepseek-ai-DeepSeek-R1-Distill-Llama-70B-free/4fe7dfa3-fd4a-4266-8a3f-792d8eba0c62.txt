Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Protocol 14 related to the European Court of Human Rights. I'm a bit rusty on my ECHR protocols, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying and whether it's true or false. The question is asking which statement is false, so I need to find the incorrect one.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge to a one-judge formation. Hmm, I remember that before Protocol 14, cases were often dealt with by committees of three judges. Protocol 14 was introduced to streamline the process. So I think this is correct because it did change the formation to single judges for certain cases, especially admissibility. So A is probably true.

Option B: Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. Now, the admissibility criteria are things like whether the case is within the Court's jurisdiction, whether domestic remedies have been exhausted, and whether the application is manifestly ill-founded. Did Protocol 14 add a new one? I'm not sure. I think Protocol 14 mainly dealt with procedural changes rather than adding new criteria. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I'll have to come back to this.

Option C: Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. Wait, the Commission was part of the old system. The European Commission of Human Rights used to filter cases before they went to the Court. After Protocol 11 in 1998, the Commission was abolished, and the Court became a full-time body. Protocol 14 came later, so it didn't abolish the Commission; it was already gone. So option C is false because it was Protocol 11 that did that, not 14.

Wait, but I should double-check. No, Protocol 11 came into force in 1998 and merged the Commission and the Court into a single system. So yeah, Protocol 14 didn't abolish the Commission because it was already abolished by then. So option C is definitely false.

Option D: Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. I recall that judges used to serve terms of six years, but under Protocol 14, their terms were extended to nine years. So D is true.

Wait, but let me think again. Did Protocol 14 do that? I think yes, because one of the aims was to reduce the workload and improve efficiency, so longer terms might help with continuity. So D is correct.

So the options are:

A: True

B: Not sure, but think it's true or false?

Wait, earlier I thought B was about adding a new admissibility criterion, but I'm not certain. Let me think. Protocol 14 introduced the possibility for the Court to declare an application inadmissible if the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage, unless respect for human rights requires an examination of the case. So this is a new admissibility criterion. So B would be correct, meaning it's a true statement.

Wait, the question is which statement is false. So looking back:

Option C is false because Protocol 14 didn't abolish the Commission; Protocol 11 did that.

So the false statement is option C.

The question asks which statement about Protocol 14 is false. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: True. Protocol 14 streamlined the process by allowing single judges to hear admissibility cases, changing from the previous three-judge formation.
- **Option B**: True. Protocol 14 introduced a new admissibility criterion, where cases can be declared inadmissible if the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage, unless human rights require an examination.
- **Option C**: False. The European Commission of Human Rights was abolished by Protocol 11 in 1998, not by Protocol 14.
- **Option D**: True. Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for judges from six to nine years.

The false statement is **Option C**. 

Answer: C
