Question:

An action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes release of:

Options:

A: adrenaline which speeds up muscle metabolism.
B: noradrenaline which increases muscle metabolic activity.
C: sodium ions which binds to sodium receptors on the muscle membrane.
D: acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction.
E: acetylcholine which is broken down by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft.
F: calcium ions which initiate an action potential along the muscle fibre.
G: dopamine which initiates muscle contraction.
H: serotonin which reduces muscle excitability.
I: potassium ions which hyperpolarize the muscle membrane.
J: glutamate which acts as a neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction.

Okay, so I've got this question about action potentials and the motor endplate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question is asking, what is released when an action potential arrives at the motor endplate. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different substance and action.

First, I remember that the motor endplate is part of the neuromuscular junction, which is the synapse between a neuron and a muscle fiber. So when the action potential travels down the motor neuron, it reaches the end, and something happens there.

Wait, action potentials are electrical signals. They cause the release of neurotransmitters, right? So the key here is identifying which neurotransmitter is involved at the neuromuscular junction.

I think acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter in the neuromuscular junction. So when the action potential arrives, vesicles in the neuron release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Then, it binds to receptors on the muscle cell.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D says acetylcholine which traverses the junction. That sounds right because it's released into the cleft. Option E says it's broken down by acetylcholinesterase in the cleft. Oh wait, that's after it's done its job. The enzyme breaks it down to terminate the signal.

So the question is about what's released, not what happens after. So D is about release, E is about breakdown.

Other options: A and B are adrenaline and noradrenaline. I think those are more related to the sympathetic nervous system, like in fight-or-flight responses, not the motor neurons.

C is sodium ions binding to receptors. Sodium is involved in action potentials, but I don't think that's the neurotransmitter here. Plus, sodium ions moving cause depolarization, but they're not the ones being released as transmitters.

F is calcium ions. Oh wait, calcium is important in neurotransmitter release. The action potential causes calcium ions to flow into the neuron's terminal, which triggers the release of the neurotransmitter. But the calcium isn't the neurotransmitter itself. So F is probably not the right answer.

G is dopamine, which I associate with the brain and reward systems, not muscles. H is serotonin, another neurotransmitter in the brain, maybe involved in mood. I is potassium ions; those are involved in repolarization of the cell membrane after an action potential, not as neurotransmitters here.

J is glutamate. I think glutamate is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, like in the brain, not at the neuromuscular junction.

So putting it all together. The correct answer should be option D: acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction. Because when the action potential arrives, the acetylcholine is released into the junction.

The motor endplate is part of the neuromuscular junction, where an action potential arriving at the neuron's terminal triggers the release of a neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter at this junction. When released, it traverses the synaptic cleft to bind to receptors on the muscle membrane, initiating muscle contraction. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, G, H, J**: These involve neurotransmitters like adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, which are not involved at the neuromuscular junction.  
- **C**: Sodium ions are involved in action potentials but are not released as neurotransmitters.  
- **F**: Calcium ions trigger neurotransmitter release but are not the neurotransmitter themselves.  
- **I**: Potassium ions are involved in repolarization, not neurotransmission.  
- **D**: Acetylcholine is released into the synaptic cleft, making it correct.  
- **E**: Acetylcholine is broken down by acetylcholinesterase after signaling, which is not the focus of the question.  

Thus, the correct answer is **D: acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction**.

Answer: D
