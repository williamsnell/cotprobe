Okay, so I have this problem here about Alexander's telephone bill. Let's see, I'm supposed to find the monthly charge from the previous year. Hmm, the current average is $17.05 last year, and that was 10% more than the previous year. Oh right, so the $17.05 is after a 10% increase. I need to find the original amount before that increase.

Wait, percentages can be tricky. I remember that if something increases by a certain percentage, you can find the original by dividing by (1 plus that percentage). So like, if it's 10% more, that's 110% of the original. So the formula would be previous year's charge = current charge / 1.10.

Let me write that down. So previous = 17.05 / 1.10. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 17.05 divided by 1.10. Wait, maybe I can do this without a calculator. Let's think. 1.10 times what gives 17.05.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of fractions. 10% is like 1/10. So 17.05 is 11/10 of the original. So the original would be 17.05 * (10/11) to get back to the previous year.

Let me compute 17.05 * 10 first. That's 170.5. Then divide by 11. Okay, 11 into 170.5. Let's see, 11 times 15 is 165. So 170.5 - 165 is 5.5. So that's 15 with a remainder of 5.5. Then 5.5 /11 is 0.5. So adding that, 15.5. Oh wait, so 15.5 dollars. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: A is 14.95, B is 15.95, C is 16, D is 14.50, E is 15.05, F is 19.10, G is 16.50, H is 18.55, I is 15.50, J is 17. So option I is 15.50. That matches what I calculated. So the answer should be I.

To determine the monthly telephone charge for the previous year, we start with the information that last year's average bill of $17.05 was 10% higher than the previous year. This means $17.05 represents 110% of the previous year's charge. To find the original amount, we divide $17.05 by 1.10:

\[
\text{Previous Year's Charge} = \frac{17.05}{1.10} = 15.50
\]

From the given options, the value $15.50 corresponds to option I.
