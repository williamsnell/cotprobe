Okay, so I've got this question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see. The question is about a passage from Roland Doregelès' book, and it's asking what we can infer about Clemenceau from the passage.

Alright, let's read the passage again carefully. The narrator is talking about a time when mobilization for war was announced. The narrator runs to the Rue Drout, reads the message about the first day of mobilization on Sunday, August 2, 1914. Then he goes back to his newspaper's office and bursts into Clemenceau's office. Clemenceau asks, "What is Paris saying?" The narrator replies, "It's singing, sir!" Clemenceau then says, "It will be all right then."

So, I need to figure out what this exchange implies about Clemenceau's thoughts or feelings.

Looking at the options:

A: Had already started making strategies for the upcoming war. Well, the passage doesn't mention anything about Clemenceau planning strategies. So probably not A.

B: Was in disagreement with the public's reaction. The narrator says Paris is singing, which suggests joy or support. If Clemenceau was disagreeing, he might have a negative reaction, but he says it will be all right. So maybe not B.

C: Was unaware until the narrator told him. The passage doesn't indicate that Clemenceau didn't know. The narrator just came from seeing the announcement, but Clemenceau could have known already. So C might not be correct.

D: Had grave doubts about France's ability to win. The response was positive, so this seems unlikely. If he had doubts, he might not say it'll be all right.

E: Was fearful of the war. Again, his response seems hopeful, not fearful. So E doesn't fit.

F: Was relieved Paris was reacting with joy. That makes sense because if the public is supportive, it might ease his concerns. So F is a possibility.

G: Would one day serve as PM. Well, I know from history that Clemenceau was a Prime Minister of France, but the passage doesn't mention that. The question is about inferring from the passage, so G might not be the right choice here.

H: Believed war would bring economic prosperity. The passage doesn't talk about economic aspects, so probably not H.

I: Indifferent to Paris's reaction. But he asks the question, showing he's interested, so I is unlikely.

J: Disgusted by the joy. Since he says it'll be all right, he seems approving, not disgusted. So J is out.

Putting it all together: Clemenceau's response suggests he's relieved that the public is supportive. So the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. Clemenceau was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war. His positive response, "It will be all right then," indicates relief and approval of the public's supportive reaction.

F
