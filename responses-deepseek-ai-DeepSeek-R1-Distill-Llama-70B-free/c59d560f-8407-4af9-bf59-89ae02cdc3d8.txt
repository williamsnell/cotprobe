Okay, so I've got this question about calculating abnormal return. Hmm, I remember that abnormal return is the difference between the actual return of a portfolio and the expected return based on the CAPM model. Right, CAPM stands for Capital Asset Pricing Model, which is used to determine the expected return on an investment.

The question gives me some numbers: Rf is 4%, Rm is 12%, Beta of the portfolio is 1.8. Also, the beginning value of the portfolio is $50,000, and the ending value is $60,000. Wait, so the portfolio increased by $10,000 over the period. 

First, I think I need to calculate the actual return of the portfolio. Actual return is like the total return, including any dividends, but in this case, I guess it's just the capital gain since there's no mention of dividends. So the formula for actual return (R_p) is (Ending Value - Beginning Value + Dividends) / Beginning Value. But since no dividends are mentioned, I can ignore that part.

So R_p = ($60,000 - $50,000) / $50,000 = $10,000 / $50,000. That's 0.2, which is 20%. Wait, 0.2 is 20% because 0.2 * 100 = 20%.

Next, I need to find the expected return according to CAPM. The CAPM formula is E(R_p) = Rf + Beta*(Rm - Rf). Plugging in the numbers: Rf is 4%, or 0.04. Rm is 12%, which is 0.12. Beta is 1.8.

So E(R_p) = 0.04 + 1.8*(0.12 - 0.04). Let's calculate that. 0.12 - 0.04 is 0.08. Multiply by Beta: 1.8 * 0.08. Let's see, 1 times 0.08 is 0.08, and 0.8 times 0.08 is 0.064, so total is 0.08 + 0.064 = 0.144. Then add Rf: 0.04 + 0.144 equals 0.184. So the expected return is 18.4%.

Now, the abnormal return is the actual return minus the expected return. So that's 20% minus 18.4%, which is 1.6%. Converting that to decimal, it's 0.016.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.016. So the answer should be C.

To calculate the abnormal return, we first determine the actual return of the portfolio and then subtract the expected return based on the CAPM model.

1. **Actual Return (R_p):**  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   R_p = \frac{\text{Ending Value} - \text{Beginning Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}}
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   R_p = \frac{60,000 - 50,000}{50,000} = \frac{10,000}{50,000} = 0.20 \, \text{or} \, 20\%.
   \]

2. **Expected Return (E(R_p)) using CAPM:**  
   The CAPM formula is:  
   \[
   E(R_p) = R_f + \beta \cdot (R_m - R_f)
   \]  
   Substituting the given values (\(R_f = 0.04\), \(R_m = 0.12\), \(\beta = 1.8\)):  
   \[
   E(R_p) = 0.04 + 1.8 \cdot (0.12 - 0.04) = 0.04 + 1.8 \cdot 0.08 = 0.04 + 0.144 = 0.184 \, \text{or} \, 18.4\%.
   \]

3. **Abnormal Return:**  
   Abnormal return is the difference between the actual return and the expected return:  
   \[
   \text{Abnormal Return} = R_p - E(R_p) = 0.20 - 0.184 = 0.016 \, \text{or} \, 1.6\%.
   \]

From the options provided, the abnormal return corresponds to **0.016**, which is option **C**.
