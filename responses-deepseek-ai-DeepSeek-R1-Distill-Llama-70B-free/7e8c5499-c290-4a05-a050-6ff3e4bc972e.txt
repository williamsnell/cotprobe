Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The question says that g(x) is equal to f(–x) for all real numbers x. Oh right, so g is a function that's defined in terms of f, but with the input being the negative of x. That probably means it's a reflection or something across the y-axis, but I'm not totally sure yet.

It also says that the point (3, 2) is on the graph of g. So when x is 3, g(3) equals 2. My goal is to find out which point must be on the graph of f based on this information.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about what g(x) = f(–x) implies. For any x, plugging into g gives me the same value as plugging –x into f. So if I know g(3) = 2, that means f(–3) = 2, right? Because g(3) is f(–3).

Wait, so f(–3) is 2. But I need to find a point on f's graph. The graph of f would have points where the x is the input and y is the output. So if f(a) = b, then the point (a, b) is on the graph.

So f(–3) = 2 means the point (–3, 2) is on f's graph. But looking at the options, let me see what's available.

The options are labeled A to J. Let me list them out:

A: (-2, 3)
B: (2, -3)
C: (3, 2)
D: (-3, -2)
E: (-2, 2)
F: (2, -2)
G: (2, 3)
H: (-3, 2)
I: (3, -2)
J: (-2, -3)

Wait, option H is (-3, 2). That's exactly what I was thinking. So that's the point on f's graph.

But wait, let me think deeper to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes these problems can have tricks. So if g(x) is f(-x), then to get f(x), we can write f(x) as g(-x). Because if I let y = -x, then f(y) = g(-y). So f(x) = g(-x). 

Given that, if (3, 2) is on g, which means g(3)=2. Then f(-3) = 2, so the point (-3, 2) is on f. Which is option H.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about transformations. If g is f reflected over the y-axis, then the graph of g is the mirror image of f across the y-axis. So a point (a, b) on g would correspond to (-a, b) on f. Because reflecting over y-axis changes the x-coordinate's sign.

So if (3,2) is on g, then on f it would be (-3, 2). Yep, that's option H again.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we start with the relationship \( g(x) = f(-x) \) for all real numbers \( x \). This means that for any point \( (x, y) \) on the graph of \( g \), the point \( (-x, y) \) will be on the graph of \( f \).

Given that \( (3, 2) \) is a point on the graph of \( g \), we know that \( g(3) = 2 \). Using the relationship \( g(x) = f(-x) \), this implies \( f(-3) = 2 \). Therefore, the point \( (-3, 2) \) must be on the graph of \( f \).

Looking at the options provided:

- **A:** \((-2, 3)\)
- **B:** \((2, -3)\)
- **C:** \((3, 2)\)
- **D:** \((-3, -2)\)
- **E:** \((-2, 2)\)
- **F:** \((2, -2)\)
- **G:** \((2, 3)\)
- **H:** \((-3, 2)\)
- **I:** \((3, -2)\)
- **J:** \((-2, -3)\)

The correct answer is **H: \((-3, 2)\)**, as it matches the point on the graph of \( f \) derived from the given information.

Answer: H
