Okay, I need to tackle this multiple-choice question. Let me read it carefully and think through each statement step by step.

The question presents two statements about machine learning concepts, specifically related to Gaussian mixture models and Bayes optimal classifiers. I'm a bit rusty on some of these topics, so I'll try to break them down.

Statement 1: Besides EM, gradient descent can be used to perform inference or learning on Gaussian mixture models.

Hmm, I remember that Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are often trained using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. EM is an iterative method that finds maximum likelihood estimates when there are latent variables, which is the case here since the mixture component assignments are latent.

But can gradient descent be used instead? Gradient descent is a general optimization technique. It's commonly used for training neural networks by optimizing the weights, but I think it can also be applied to other models. For GMMs, the parameters are the means, covariances, and mixing coefficients. The EM algorithm is more straightforward for GMMs because it directly maximizes the log-likelihood. However, could we compute the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to these parameters and use gradient descent?

I recall that for GMMs, the log-likelihood isn't easily maximized using gradient descent because each step would require calculating derivatives for each data point, which might be computationally intensive. But technically, it's possible. So gradient descent could be an alternative, though not the usual or most efficient method. Therefore, Statement 1 might be true.

Wait, but gradient descent is more commonly used in cases where the objective function is differentiable and easy to compute gradients for. In GMMs, the EM approach is more natural, but gradient-based methods like gradient ascent (since we're maximizing) could be applicable. So, yes, Statement 1 seems true.

Statement 2: Assuming a fixed number of attributes, a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier can be learned in time linear in the number of records in the dataset.

Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifiers—like Gaussian Naive Bayes—make certain assumptions. The Bayes optimal classifier requires knowing the true distributions of the data. For a Gaussian classifier, we typically model each class as a multivariate normal distribution. The time complexity for learning such a classifier involves estimating the parameters (mean and covariance) for each class.

If the number of attributes (features) is fixed, then the time to compute the means and covariances would depend on the number of records (data points) and the number of features. For each class, calculating the mean is O(n*d), where n is the number of records and d is the number of attributes. Calculating the covariance matrix is also O(n*d^2) in the general case (when covariances between features are considered). However, if it's a Naive Bayes classifier, the covariance is assumed to be diagonal, simplifying it to O(n*d).

But the statement says the time is linear in the number of records. So if d is fixed, then O(n*d) becomes O(n) since d is a constant. Similarly, O(n*d^2) would be O(n) if d is fixed. So the learning time would scale linearly with n.

Wait, but in reality, even for Naive Bayes, the time is O(n*d) for each class. If there are C classes, then overall it's O(C*n*d). But if C is fixed (as it often is in classification problems), then O(C*n*d) is still linear in n as d is fixed. So yes, the time is linear in the number of records, making Statement 2 true.

Wait, but the statement says 'Bayes optimal classifier.' If the classifier is truly Bayes optimal, it would require the data to be generated by a Gaussian distribution with the specific parameters. In practice, when we use Gaussian Naive Bayes, we're making assumptions that might not hold, but in the statement, we're assuming the data fits the model. So under correct model assumptions, the learning can be done in linear time. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but what about the complexity of inverting matrices or other computations? Like, in the case of a full covariance matrix, calculating the inverse for the multivariate normal's probability density function. But when training, we're just estimating the parameters, not inverting them yet. So the learning step (calculating means and covariances) is O(n*d^2) for full covariance, but if d is fixed, it's O(n). So yes, linear in n.

So both statements seem true. So the correct option would be C: True, True.

Wait, but I should double-check Statement 1. The question is about whether gradient descent can be used besides EM. EM is typically used because it's an expectation step followed by maximization. But gradient descent involves taking small steps in the direction of the gradient. For GMMs, the log-likelihood is not concave, so gradient descent might not find the global maximum and could get stuck in local optima. However, the statement says "can be used," not that it's the best or most efficient method. So technically, yes, it's possible to use gradient descent, though it's not the usual approach. So Statement 1 is correct.

Therefore, both statements are true, so the answer is C.

Statement 1: Besides EM, gradient descent can be used to perform inference or learning on Gaussian mixture models.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are typically trained using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which is well-suited for maximizing the log-likelihood in the presence of latent variables. However, gradient descent can also be applied to optimize the parameters of a GMM by directly maximizing the log-likelihood. While EM is the more common and efficient method, gradient descent is technically viable, even if it may face challenges like local optima due to the non-concave nature of the log-likelihood. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: Assuming a fixed number of attributes, a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier can be learned in time linear in the number of records in the dataset.

For a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier, the time complexity of learning depends on estimating the parameters (means and covariances) for each class. If the number of attributes (features) is fixed, the time complexity for calculating these parameters scales linearly with the number of records in the dataset. For example, computing means is O(n*d) and covariances is O(n*d^2), where n is the number of records and d is the number of attributes. Since d is fixed, both operations are linear in n. Thus, Statement 2 is true.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is:

C: True, True
