Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Rita is moving a pile of 120 rocks by hand to build a rock wall. The variable h represents the number of rocks she can carry in one load. The question is asking which expression represents the total number of loads needed to move the entire pile.

Hmm, right. So Rita has 120 rocks, and each time she carries h rocks. I need to find how many loads she'll need to carry all of them.

Let me think about this. If she can carry h rocks each time, the total number of loads should be the total number of rocks divided by how many she carries each load. That makes sense because division tells us how many equal parts (loads) are in the total.

So, mathematically, that would be total rocks divided by rocks per load. So 120 divided by h.

Looking at the options:
A: 120 - h → That's subtraction; doesn't seem right because if she carries more per load, the number of loads should decrease, which this might not represent correctly.

B: 120 + h → Addition, which doesn't make sense here because adding would mean more loads as h increases, which isn't correct.

C: 120%h → Modulus operator. That gives the remainder when 120 is divided by h. But we want the number of loads, not the remainder. So this isn't it.

D: h/120 → That's h divided by 120. Wait, that's the inverse of what we need. Because if she carries h rocks each time, the number of loads is 120/h, not the other way around.

E: 120h → That's 120 multiplied by h. That would give a much larger number, which doesn't make sense because as h increases, the number of loads should decrease, not increase.

F: h*120 → Same as E, multiplication. So that's not right.

G: 120/h → Oh, this is 120 divided by h, which matches what I was thinking earlier. So this is the correct expression for the number of loads.

H: h^120 → That's h raised to the 120th power. Way too big and not relevant here.

I: h-120 → Subtraction again. If h is less than 120, this might give a negative number, which doesn't make sense for loads.

J: h+120 → Addition again. As h increases, this increases, which isn't how it should work.

So the correct answer should be option G: 120/h.

The total number of loads Rita needs is calculated by dividing the total number of rocks (120) by the number of rocks she can carry in one load (h). This is represented by the expression 120/h.

Answer: G
