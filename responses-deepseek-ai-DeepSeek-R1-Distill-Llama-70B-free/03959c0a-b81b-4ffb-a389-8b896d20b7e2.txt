Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the least number of circular tables needed for 190 wedding guests, with each table seating exactly 8 people. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that when you need to find out how many groups you need for a certain number of items, you usually use division. So in this case, I should divide the total number of guests by the number each table can hold. That makes sense because each table is a group.

So, let's do the math. 190 divided by 8. Wait, what's 8 times 20? That's 160. 8 times 25 is 200, right? Oh wait, 200 is more than 190, so 25 tables would be too many. But wait, the question is about the least number needed to seat all guests, so maybe I need to round up.

Wait, let me calculate 190 divided by 8 exactly. 8 goes into 19 twice (8*2=16), subtract 16 from 19 gives 3. Bring down the 0, making 30. 8 goes into 30 three times (8*3=24), subtract 24 from 30 gives 6. So, 190/8 is 23.75. Oh, right, because 23 times 8 is 184, and 24 times 8 is 192. So 23 tables would give 23*8=184 seats, which is less than 190. That means 23 tables wouldn't be enough because we'd have 190-184=6 people left without a seat. So we need another table. 

Wait, but the question is about circular tables. Does that change anything? Hmm, I don't think the shape affects the number of people per table, just the seating arrangement. So each table can still hold exactly 8, regardless of being circular.

So, if 23 tables give 184 seats and we have 190 guests, 23 isn't enough. We need to round up to the next whole number, which is 24. But wait, let me check the options. The options are A through J, and looking at them, I see option G is 24. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, 24 tables would provide 24*8=192 seats. 192 is more than 190, so that works. So the minimal number is 24 tables. Let me double-check the options to see if 24 is one of them. Looking back, yes, option G is 24. So that's the answer.

Wait a second, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in my division? Let me do it another way. 8 times 20 is 160, as I said earlier. 190 minus 160 is 30. 30 divided by 8 is 3.75. So that's 3 more tables beyond the initial 20, making 23. But that's not enough because 3.75 isn't a whole number, so you need to round up to 4. So 20+4=24. Yeah, that checks out. So 24 tables are needed.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be option G:24.

To determine the least number of circular tables needed to seat 190 guests, with each table seating exactly 8 people, we divide the total number of guests by the number of seats per table:

\[
\frac{190}{8} = 23.75
\]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we round up to the next whole number, which is 24. Therefore, 24 tables are required to seat all 190 guests.

The correct answer is **G: 24**.
