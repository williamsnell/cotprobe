Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways there are to choose 3 cards from a standard 52-card deck, with the condition that all three must be from different suits. Hmm, let's see. 

First, I remember that a standard deck has 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. So, each suit contributes 13 cards.

Since the problem says all three cards must be from different suits, that means I can't have two or three cards from the same suit. So each card has to come from a unique suit. But wait, there are four suits and I'm choosing three cards. So that means I have to pick 3 out of the 4 suits first, right? Because each of those three suits will contribute one card each.

So the first step is to choose which three suits out of the four I'm going to use. How many ways can I choose 3 suits from 4? Oh right, that's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So 4 choose 3 is 4!/(3!1!) = (4×3×2×1)/(6×1×1) )= 4. So there are 4 possible combinations of suits.

Once I've selected the three suits, I then need to choose one card from each of those suits. Each suit has 13 cards, so for each chosen suit, there are 13 choices. Since I have three suits, each with 13 options, the number of ways would be 13 × 13 × 13. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 13 choices for each of the three suits. So it's 13^3?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For each of the three suits selected, I can pick any one card from each. Since the choices are independent, the total number for the three suits is 13 * 13 * 13, which is 2197. Oh wait, no, because that would be 13^3. Let me calculate that: 13 ×13 is 169, multiplied by 13 again is 2197. Right.

So for each combination of three suits, there's 2197 ways to choose one card from each. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because 13 choices for each suit, so 13^3 is indeed 2197. But wait, no, wait a second. Because 3 suits, each with 13 options, so 13 × 13 × 13 is correct, which is 2197.

But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If I have to choose 3 cards, each from a different suit, but not necessarily one from each of three specific suits. So the total number would be the number of ways to choose the suits multiplied by the number of ways to choose the cards within those suits.

So the total ways would be:

Number of ways to choose the suits (4 choose 3) multiplied by the product of the number of choices in each selected suit.

So that's 4 * (13 * 13 *13) = 4 * 2197.

Wait, wait, 4 * 2197 would be 8788. Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 8788. Wait, but that would mean the answer is B. 

Wait, but wait another minute. Because when I'm choosing 3 cards, each from a different suit, but the way I'm calculating it is 4 choose 3 suits, and then 13 choices for each. So that's 4 * 13^3 = 4 * 2197 = 8788. So that's 8788 ways.

But let me think about another approach to make sure. Another way: for the first card, I can pick any card (52 options). The second card must be from a different suit than the first. Since the first card's suit can't be used again, so the second card has 39 options (because 52 - 13 = 39). The third card must be from a different suit than both the first and the second, so that would leave 26 options (since two suits are excluded, 13 each, so 52-26=26).

But wait, since the order doesn't matter, this approach would count each combination multiple times. So I'd have to adjust for that. Let me see: the number of ordered ways would be 52 * 39 * 26, but since the order doesn't matter, I have to divide by the number of permutations of the three cards, which is 3! =6. So that would give (52 *39 *26)/6.

Let me compute that step by step.

52 * 39 = let's see, 50*39=1950, 2*39=78, so 1950 +78=2028.

2028 *26: Hmm, 2000*26=52,000, 28*26=728, so 52,728.

Now divide that by 6: 52728 /6. Let's compute that. 6 × 8788 = 52,728. So yes, 52,728 /6 is 8788. So that's the same answer as before.

So that confirms that the total number of ways is 8788. So the correct option is B.

To determine the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where all three cards must be from different suits, we can break the problem into two steps:

1. **Choosing the suits**: There are 4 suits in a deck, and we need to choose 3 of them. The number of ways to choose 3 suits from 4 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{3} \), which equals 4.

2. **Choosing one card from each selected suit**: For each of the 3 chosen suits, there are 13 cards to choose from. Since the choices are independent, the total number of ways to pick one card from each suit is \( 13 \times 13 \times 13 = 13^3 = 2197 \).

The total number of ways to choose 3 cards from different suits is then the product of the two results:
\[
\text{Total ways} = \binom{4}{3} \times 13^3 = 4 \times 2197 = 8788.
\]

This matches option **B**.
