Question:

A bank was robbed by a person wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant was arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the proffered evidence should be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime as charged.
C: inadmissible, because it constitutes double jeopardy.
D: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the case.
E: admissible, to show the identity of the defendant.
F: admissible, to show the defendant's propensity for committing similar crimes.
G: admissible, to show the defendant's modus operandi.
H: admissible, to show the defendant's motive.
I: inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
J: inadmissible, because it constitutes improper character evidence.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a bank robbery where the robber wore specific clothing: a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Three weeks later, the defendant is arrested and charged. At trial, the prosecution wants to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing the exact same outfit. The defense objects, and we need to decide if that evidence is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that evidence of prior crimes is generally not admissible to prove that the defendant is a bad person or has a propensity for crime. That's because of the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(b), which says that such evidence can't be used to show propensity. So the prosecution can't just say, "Hey, he did this before, so he must have done it again." But wait, there are exceptions to this rule. 

The exceptions include things like motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. So if the prior crime is being offered for one of these purposes, it might be admissible. 

In this question, the prior robbery is being offered because the clothing is identical. That seems like it's going to the identity of the perpetrator. So maybe it's about modus operandi (MO) or identity. 

I think modus operandi refers to a pattern of behavior that's so distinctive that it tends to prove the defendant is the one who committed the crime. Like, if a robber always wears the same unique outfit, and then another robbery happens with the same outfit, that's relevant to identity. 

So under Rule 404(b), evidence of prior crimes can be admissible for identity if it's not just about propensity. The key here is whether the prior act is so similar that it's relevant to show it's the same person. 

Looking at the options, option E says it's admissible to show identity, and option G says it's for modus operandi. So which one is correct? 

I think modus operandi is a specific type of evidence used for identity. So if the prior crimes show a unique MO, then it's admissible under Rule 404(b). So option G might be correct. 

Alternatively, option E is about identity, which is also an exception. But I think the more precise term here is modus operandi. 

Wait, but another point: Rule 403 says that even if evidence is admissible under another rule, it can be excluded if the probative value is outweighed by prejudice or other factors. So sometimes, even if prior crimes are admissible for MO, the court might exclude them if they're too prejudicial. 

But the question here is about the admissibility upon objection, so the initial question is whether it's admissible, not whether it's excluded under 403. 

So the options are whether it's inadmissible or admissible for certain reasons. 

Option F says it's admissible to show propensity, which is exactly what's prohibited under 404(b). So F is out. 

Option E and G are the contenders. 

I think the correct reasoning is that the prior robbery's similar clothing is part of the MO, so it's admissible under 404(b) for identity. So option G says it's admissible to show modus operandi. 

Wait, but another thought: if the prior crime is being offered to show that the defendant has a tendency to wear such outfits, thus linking him to the current crime, that's more about identity through MO. So yes, G seems right. 

Alternatively, some might think it's about identity directly, making E correct. But I think E is more about direct evidence, like fingerprints or DNA. Here, it's the unique clothing, which is part of the MO. 

So I'm leaning towards option G being correct. But wait, let me check the options again. 

Option E: admissible to show identity. 

Option G: admissible to show modus operandi. 

In some jurisdictions, modus operandi is considered a specific application under the identity exception. So the evidence is being used to show that the same person committed both crimes because of the unique method. 

Therefore, the correct answer would be E or G. 

Alternatively, another angle: the prior crimes can't be used to show the defendant is likely to commit the crime again (propensity), but can be used for other purposes. So if the prior crime is so similar, it's relevant to show that the defendant is the same person. 

So perhaps the evidence is admissible for identity, making option E correct. 

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the prior robbery is being offered as evidence. So the prior robbery's clothing is being used to show that the defendant, who is linked to that prior robbery, is the one who did this robbery. So it's about identity. 

Alternatively, if the prior robbery is part of a series, it's about MO. 

I think I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of a real example. If a bank robber always ties the hostages' hands with a red ribbon, and in the current case, that's what happened, then the prior instances would be admissible to show MO, linking the defendant to the crime. 

So in our case, the clothing is the MO. So the prior robbery's clothing is evidence of MO, which helps in proving identity. So option G would be correct. 

But another thought: the question is whether the prior robbery is admissible. So the defendant is on trial for this robbery, and the prosecution wants to bring in the prior robbery. The issue is whether that's allowed. 

Rule 404(b) says that prior crimes can be used for purposes such as proving identity. So if the prior crime is relevant to show that the same person committed both, then it's admissible. 

So in that case, option E would be correct because it's about identity. 

Alternatively, the reasoning could be that the unique clothing is part of the MO, making option G correct. 

Wait, I think I need to recall what each option says. 

Option E: admissible to show identity of the defendant. 

Option G: admissible to show modus operandi. 

So the evidence is being offered for MO, which is a permissible purpose under 404(b). So the correct answer would be G. 

But some might argue that it's about identity, so E is correct. 

I'm a bit torn between E and G. Let me think again. 

Modus operandi is a method of operation, and it's used to show that the same person committed the crimes because the methods are so similar. So when the prior crimes are offered to show that the same MO was used, it's for identity. 

So in this case, the clothing is part of the MO, so it's being used to show identity. So perhaps both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, E says "identity", G says "modus operandi". 

Wait, the question is about whether the evidence should be admitted. So the reasoning is that the prior robbery's clothing is so unique that it's part of the MO, thus allowing it to be admitted to show that the same person (defendant) did both robberies. 

So option G is correct. 

Alternatively, some might see it as directly showing identity, but I think the more precise legal term here is modus operandi. 

So the answer should be G. 

But wait, another point: the prior robbery is a conviction or just an arrest? The question says the defendant was arrested and charged, but it doesn't say he was convicted. So the prior robbery might not even be a conviction. 

Wait, but for 404(b), the prior crimes can be convictions, arrests, or even specific instances of conduct. So even if it's an arrest, it's still admissible if it's for a proper purpose. 

So that doesn't affect the analysis. 

Another thought: the question is about the last robbery, and the prior one. The prior one is three weeks before. So the time proximity might affect the relevance, but I don't think it's a bar here. 

So, in conclusion, the evidence is admissible to show modus operandi, so option G is correct. 

Wait, but looking back, option E is about identity. So if the clothing is unique, it could be that it's not just about MO but directly about identity. 

I'm now more confused. Maybe I should look up the relevant law again. 

Rule 404(b) says:

(b) Specific Instances of Conduct. Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness's character for truthfulness, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (subject to Rule 613's protection). Specific instances of conduct of a party may also be admissible for any purpose for which they are relevant, except to prove a person's character or propensity to commit a crime.

So prior crimes can be used for purposes such as identity. 

In this case, the prior robbery's clothing is relevant to show that the same person (with the same MO) committed both robberies, thus proving identity. 

So the evidence is being offered to show identity, making option E correct. 

Alternatively, it's being offered to show modus operandi, which is a subset of identity. 

So which option is correct? 

I think the answer is E or G. But looking at the options, E is about identity, G about MO. 

In the context of the question, the prosecution is offering the evidence to show that the defendant, who committed a prior robbery with the same clothing, is the same person who committed this robbery. So it's about identity. 

Therefore, option E is correct. 

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Some sources say that modus operandi is a recognized exception, and that's what's being used here. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's about identity, but I'm not 100% sure. 

Alternatively, the answer might be J, which says it's inadmissible as improper character evidence. But J is about character evidence, which is prohibited under 404(a). But since the evidence is being offered for a proper purpose (identity), it's not barred by 404(a). So J is incorrect. 

Another option is I, which says it's inadmissible because the probative value is outweighed by prejudice. But the question is about whether it's admissible upon objection, so unless the evidence is per se inadmissible, the court might weigh it under 403. However, the question is phrased as what the proffered evidence should be upon objection, so it's more about whether it's admissible as a matter of law, not whether it's excluded under 403. 

So the options are between E and G. 

I think the best answer is E: admissible to show identity. Because the prior robbery's clothing is so unique that it tends to show that the same person committed both crimes, thus proving identity. 

But wait, another angle: the prior robbery is being offered to show that the defendant has a modus operandi of wearing this outfit, thereby linking him to the current crime. So that's modus operandi, making G correct. 

I'm still a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is G. 

Wait, let me think of a real example. If a robber always uses a specific MO, like wearing a certain disguise, then prior instances of that MO can be used to show that the same person did it again. So that's modus operandi, so G is correct. 

So I'm going to go with option G: admissible to show modus operandi.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence that the defendant previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. The prosecution seeks to introduce this evidence to link the defendant to the current crime. The key issue is whether this evidence is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(b), which prohibits the use of prior crimes to show propensity but allows such evidence for other purposes, such as identity or modus operandi (MO).

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A (Inadmissible as hearsay evidence):** This is incorrect because the evidence is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to show the defendant's involvement in the current crime through identity or MO.

2. **Option B (Admissible as circumstantial evidence):** While the evidence is circumstantial, this option is too broad and does not address the specific legal issue under Rule 404(b).

3. **Option C (Inadmissible due to double jeopardy):** This is irrelevant, as double jeopardy pertains to being tried twice for the same offense, not the admissibility of prior crimes for other purposes.

4. **Option D (Inadmissible as irrelevant):** The evidence is relevant because it links the defendant to the crime through unique clothing, making it probative of identity or MO.

5. **Option E (Admissible to show identity):** This is a strong contender. The unique clothing could be used to argue that the same person committed both robberies, thus proving identity. However, the more precise legal term for this type of evidence is "modus operandi."

6. **Option F (Admissible to show propensity):** This is incorrect because Rule 404(b) explicitly prohibits using prior crimes to show propensity for committing similar crimes.

7. **Option G (Admissible to show modus operandi):** This is the most precise answer. The unique clothing constitutes a distinctive MO, which is admissible under Rule 404(b) to link the defendant to the crime.

8. **Option H (Admissible to show motive):** There is no indication that the clothing relates to motive, making this option irrelevant.

9. **Option I (Inadmissible due to unfair prejudice):** While Rule 403 allows courts to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by prejudice, the question focuses on admissibility under Rule 404(b), not Rule 403.

10. **Option J (Inadmissible as improper character evidence):** This is incorrect because the evidence is not being offered to prove the defendant's character or propensity but rather for the permissible purpose of showing MO or identity.

### Conclusion:
The evidence of the prior robbery is admissible to show modus operandi, as the unique clothing worn by the robber in both instances is a distinctive pattern of behavior that links the defendant to the crime. While it could also be interpreted as evidence of identity, the more precise legal term is modus operandi. Therefore, the best answer is:

**G: Admissible, to show the defendant's modus operandi.**
