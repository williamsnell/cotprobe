Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

Max and Jonathon were picking strawberries. Max picked 187 strawberries, and Jonathon picked 223. Together, they ate 26 of them. The question is asking which expression shows a way to find the total number of strawberries they have left.

Hmm, so I need to find the total after they picked and then subtract the ones they ate. Let me break it down.

First, Max picked 187, Jonathon picked 223. So together, they picked 187 + 223 strawberries. Then, they ate 26 together. So the total left should be the sum of what they picked minus what they ate. So the expression should be (187 + 223) - 26. Let me compute that.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly show 187 + 223 -26. So perhaps the options are using some other way of calculating. Maybe they're breaking down the numbers, like rounding or something.

Let me check each option. Let's see what each one does.

Option A: 187 + 223 -25 +4. Wait, that's 187+223 =410, then -25 is 385, +4 makes 389. But the correct calculation would be 410-26=384. So 389 is 5 more than correct. So no.

Option B: 187+223-30+3. 410-30=380, +3=383. Which is 1 less than 384. Not correct.

Option C: 180 + 230 -30 +3. 180+230=410. Then same as B, 410-30=380 +3=383. Again, same as B, incorrect.

Option D: 185 +225 –25 +1. 185+225=410. 410-25=385 +1=386. That's 2 more than 384. Not correct.

Option E: 190 +220 –30 +4. 190+220=410. 410-30=380 +4=384. Oh, wait, that's exactly the correct number. Because 190+220 is 410, minus 30 is 380, plus 4 is 384.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the correct total is 187 +223 =410. Then minus 26 is 384. So option E's calculation is 190+220=410, then -30 is 380, +4=384. So that's correct.

But wait, let me check other options to be sure.

Option F: 200 +200 –30 –4. 400 -30=370 -4=366. No, that's way lower.

Option G: 190 +220 –25 +2. 410 –25=385 +2=387. That's 3 more than correct.

Option H: 187 +223 –26 +2. That's 410 –26=384 +2=386. Oh, wait, that's 386, which is 2 more than correct. So H is incorrect.

Option I: 200+200 –25 –1. 400-25=375 –1=374. No.

Option J: 190 +220 –25 +1. 410 –25=385 +1=386. Also incorrect.

So looking back, option E gives 384, which is correct. Because 190+220 is 410, subtract 30 gives 380, then add 4 gives 384.

Wait, but why would you subtract 30 and add 4? Oh, maybe they're adjusting for some rounding. Like, 187 is approximated to 190 (which is +3), and 223 is approximated to 220 (which is -3). So 190 +220 =410, same as the exact. Then, when subtracting 26, perhaps they're breaking it down as subtracting 30 and then adding 4 back, because 30-4=26. So 410 -30 is 380, plus 4 is 384. That makes sense because 380 +4=384.

So yes, option E correctly calculates the total after adjusting for the eaten strawberries.

Wait, but let me check if any other option does the same. Option J: 190+220-25+1. 190+220=410. 410-25=385 +1=386. That's not right. So no.

So the correct answer should be option E.

To determine the total number of strawberries Max and Jonathon have left, we first calculate the total strawberries they picked together and then subtract the number they ate. Max picked 187 strawberries, and Jonathon picked 223, so together they picked:

\[
187 + 223 = 410
\]

They ate 26 strawberries together, so the total number of strawberries left is:

\[
410 - 26 = 384
\]

Now, we analyze the options to find an expression that equals 384. 

- **Option A**: \(187 + 223 - 25 + 4 = 389\) (incorrect, as it results in 389).  
- **Option B**: \(187 + 223 - 30 + 3 = 383\) (incorrect, as it results in 383).  
- **Option C**: \(180 + 230 - 30 + 3 = 383\) (incorrect, as it results in 383).  
- **Option D**: \(185 + 225 - 25 + 1 = 386\) (incorrect, as it results in 386).  
- **Option E**: \(190 + 220 - 30 + 4 = 384\) (correct, as it results in 384).  
- **Option F**: \(200 + 200 - 30 - 4 = 366\) (incorrect, as it results in 366).  
- **Option G**: \(190 + 220 - 25 + 2 = 387\) (incorrect, as it results in 387).  
- **Option H**: \(187 + 223 - 26 + 2 = 386\) (incorrect, as it results in 386).  
- **Option I**: \(200 + 200 - 25 - 1 = 374\) (incorrect, as it results in 374).  
- **Option J**: \(190 + 220 - 25 + 1 = 386\) (incorrect, as it results in 386).  

Option E is correct because \(190 + 220 = 410\), and \(410 - 30 + 4 = 384\), which matches the correct total. The adjustments in Option E (subtracting 30 and adding 4) effectively account for the 26 strawberries eaten.
