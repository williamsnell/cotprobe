Question:

A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. "Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. "At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute

Options:

A: constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.
B: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C: constitutional, as it falls under the state's right to regulate its own law enforcement bodies.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the resident alien's right to seek employment.
E: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: unconstitutional, because it is an unfair restriction on the resident alien's opportunity for employment.
G: constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.
H: unconstitutional, because it violates the resident alien's rights under the Fifth Amendment.
I: constitutional, because the statute does not specifically discriminate against any particular nationality or ethnicity.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a permanent resident alien who applied to become a state trooper. The state refused him because of a statute that requires state police members to be U.S. citizens. The state's reasoning is that police officers are important officials involved in executing public policy, so only citizens should be allowed to apply.

Hmm, so the issue here is whether the state can legally require citizenship for such a position. I remember that in the U.S., there are certain public positions that require citizenship, especially those that involve policy-making or significant governmental functions. But I'm not entirely sure about the legal standards applied here.

The resident alien is challenging the constitutionality of this statute. The possible arguments would probably involve the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or maybe due process. I think the court would examine whether the citizenship requirement is rationally related to the job's responsibilities.

Wait, I recall a case called Bernal v. Fainter, where the Supreme Court upheld a state law requiring notaries public to be U.S. citizens. The Court found that citizenship was a reasonable requirement because notaries perform a public function that involves state governance. But in another case, the Court struck down a law that required citizenship for a position as a probation officer, I think. Or was that a different case?

Wait, no, that might be the case where the position was more administrative. Let me think. Oh, right, in the past, some cases have allowed citizenship requirements for certain public positions where the role involves a high level of public trust or policy-making. So, the key is whether the job is such that the state has a legitimate interest in requiring citizenship.

State troopers are law enforcement officers who have broad police powers. They enforce laws and are part of the state's executive branch, carrying out public policy. So the state's argument is that such positions should be held by citizens because they are part of executing broad public policy.

But on the other hand, the Equal Protection Clause might be implicated if the law unnecessarily discriminates against aliens. The court would apply a level of scrutiny. Since it's a state law and not a federal one, the state has to show that the requirement is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

Wait, but in Bernal, the Court applied intermediate scrutiny because it involved gender discrimination. But in this case, it's about alienage, which is a suspect classification, so maybe strict scrutiny applies? No, wait, I think that for alienage, the court applies something like intermediate scrutiny, not strict. Or is it that alienage is a quasi-suspect classification, requiring the state to show that the law is substantially related to an important governmental interest.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: when a law discriminates based on alienage, the court applies strict scrutiny if it's a federal law, but for state laws, the standard is a bit different. The Supreme Court has held that state laws that discriminate against aliens are subject to strict scrutiny only if they impinge on civil liberties, or if Congress has preempted the area. Otherwise, the state must show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

But wait, in the case of police officers, the state's interest in ensuring that those in positions of authority are citizens might be seen as a legitimate interest. So the court would have to balance that against the discrimination against the alien.

In the case presented, the state's statute is a broad requirement that all state police must be U.S. citizens. The rationale is that they are involved in executing broad public policy. So the state's argument is that citizens have a greater commitment to the community's interests.

I think the Supreme Court has upheld similar laws in the past. For example, in the case of Cabell v. Chavez-Salido (1972), the Court upheld a California law requiring citizenship for deputy probation officers. The Court found that the state's interest in having citizens in positions that involve formulating policy and carrying out broad public functions was sufficient, and the requirement was rationally related to that interest.

So applying that reasoning here, the state's requirement that state troopers be citizens would likely be upheld as constitutional because it's rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in having citizens perform such important public functions.

Looking at the options, option A says it's constitutional because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function. That aligns with what I was thinking, based on cases like Cabell.

Option B argues it's unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, but I think the Court would find the requirement constitutional under the rational basis test.

Option C says it's constitutional under the state's right to regulate law enforcement, which is true, but the correct reasoning is more about the rational relationship.

Option D and F talk about employment rights and unfair restrictions, but the legal standard is more about the state's interest, not just unfairness.

Options E and H mention due process and Fifth Amendment, which might not be the main issue here; it's more about Equal Protection.

Option G mentions plenary power, but that's more for states in areas like health and safety, which is a bit broader than the specific police function.

Option I says it's constitutional because it doesn't target a specific nationality, which is true but not the main point. The discrimination is against all non-citizens, which is a class-based discrimination, but the issue is whether it's justified.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is likely option A, as it directly addresses the rational relationship between citizenship and the police function.

The question revolves around whether a state statute requiring state troopers to be U.S. citizens is constitutional. The state argues that police officers, as important officials executing broad public policy, should be citizens. The resident alien challenges this requirement, alleging discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The analysis hinges on the level of scrutiny applied to the statute. Alienage is a quasi-suspect classification, but state laws discriminating based on alienage are typically subject to rational basis review unless they impinge on civil liberties or Congress has preempted the area. The state's interest in requiring citizenship for police officers is rooted in the idea that such positions involve significant public trust and the execution of public policy.

Precedent, such as *Cabell v. Chavez-Salido*, supports the constitutionality of citizenship requirements for certain public positions, like deputy probation officers, where the state's interest in having citizens in roles involving policy execution is deemed legitimate and rationally related to the requirement. Applying this reasoning, the state's requirement for citizenship for state troopers is likely constitutional because it is rationally related to the state's interest in ensuring that those in positions of authority are citizens.

Among the options, Option A correctly captures this reasoning, as it focuses on the rational relationship between citizenship and the special demands of the police function.
