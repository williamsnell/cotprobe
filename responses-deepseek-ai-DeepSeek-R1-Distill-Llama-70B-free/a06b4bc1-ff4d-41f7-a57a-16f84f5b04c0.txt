Okay, so I have this question about the magnetic moment of 205Tl. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, magnetic moments are related to the nuclear spin, right? I remember that the magnetic dipole moment μ is given by the formula μ = γ * I, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and I is the nuclear spin. Oh wait, but wait, I think the actual formula might have some constants involved. Let me double-check that. Oh right, the magnetic moment is μ = γ * ħ * I, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, maybe the gyromagnetic ratio already includes ħ? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is usually given in units of T^-1 s^-1, right? And the magnetic moment μ is in units of J T^-1. So I think the correct formula is μ = γ * (I * ħ), but wait, ħ is Planck's constant divided by 2π. Or maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is μ = γ * (I), but I'm not sure. 

Wait, let's think in terms of units. The given γ is 1.569e8 T^-1 s^-1, and I is 1/2. So if I multiply γ by I, what do I get? Let's compute that: 1.569e8 * 0.5 = 7.845e7 T^-1 s^-1. But wait, the options are in J T^-1. So I'm missing a conversion factor here. Oh, right, because the magnetic moment has units of J T^-1, which is equivalent to A m² (ampere meter squared). 

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to use the formula μ = γ * ħ * I, where ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s. Let me plug the numbers in. So γ is 1.569e8 T^-1 s^-1, I is 1/2. So:

μ = γ * ħ * I = (1.569e8 T^-1 s^-1) * (1.0545718e-34 J s) * (1/2)

Calculating this: 1.569e8 * 1.0545718e-34 = approximately 1.652e-26 J T^-1 s^-1 * s? Wait, no, because s cancels out. Wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, let me compute the numbers step by step. 1.569e8 is 1.569 * 1e8. 1.0545718e-34 is approximately 1.05457e-34. So multiplying these two gives:

1.569 * 1.05457 = approx 1.652, and the exponents are 1e8 * 1e-34 = 1e-26. So 1.652e-26, but we also have to multiply by I, which is 1/2. So 1.652e-26 * 0.5 = approx 0.826e-26 J T^-1.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.827e-26 J T^-1. That seems very close. So the answer should be J.

Alternatively, wait, maybe I made a mistake with the formula. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is given by μ = g * μ_N * I, where g is the g-factor and μ_N is the nuclear magneton. But wait, another approach: the gyromagnetic ratio γ is equal to (μ / I), so μ = γ * I. But wait, when I use that, I get μ = (1.569e8 T^-1 s^-1) * (1/2). But that gives 7.845e7 T^-1 s^-1. How does that convert to J T^-1?

Wait, I think I'm confusing two different formulas here. The gyromagnetic ratio is defined as γ = μ/(I ħ), so μ = γ I ħ. So yeah, that's the formula I should use. So when I plug in the numbers, I get:

μ = 1.569e8 T^-1 s^-1 * (1/2) * 1.0545718e-34 J s.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1.569e8 * 1.0545718e-34 = let's compute 1.569 * 1.0545718 first. 1.5 * 1.05 is about 1.575, and 0.069 * 1.05 is approx 0.07245, so total is approximately 1.64745. Then the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-34 = 1e-26. So 1.64745e-26, then multiplied by 1/2: 0.8237e-26 J T^-1. Which is approximately 0.824e-26, which is very close to option J, which is 0.827e-26. The slight difference is probably due to rounding during the calculation. So I think J is the correct answer.

To determine the magnetic moment of \(^{205}\text{Tl}\), we use the formula for the magnetic moment:

\[
\mu = \gamma \cdot I \cdot \hbar
\]

where:
- \(\gamma = 1.569 \times 10^8 \, \text{T}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) (gyromagnetic ratio),
- \(I = \frac{1}{2}\) (nuclear spin),
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s}\) (reduced Planck's constant).

Substituting the values:

\[
\mu = (1.569 \times 10^8) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})
\]

First, calculate the product of \(\gamma\) and \(\hbar\):

\[
1.569 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} = 1.652 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \, \text{T}^{-1}
\]

Then multiply by \(I = \frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\mu = 1.652 \times 10^{-26} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.826 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \, \text{T}^{-1}
\]

This result is very close to the value provided in option \(J\), which is \(0.827 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \, \text{T}^{-1}\). The slight difference is likely due to rounding during the calculation.

Thus, the magnetic moment of \(^{205}\text{Tl}\) is best represented by option \(J\).
