Okay, so I've got this question about the Inca and human sacrifice. Hmm, I remember that the Inca civilization had certain rituals and practices, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what preceded human sacrifice among the Inca. The options are A through J, each with different rituals or practices. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall what I know about Inca human sacrifice. From what I remember, the Inca empire was known for its elaborate religious rituals. Human sacrifice was part of these, often involving captives taken during wars. But what exactly happened before the sacrifice?

I think that before being sacrificed, the captives might have been treated in a certain way. Maybe they were given certain substances or involved in rituals. I remember something about coca leaves being used in Inca rituals. Coca leaves were important in their culture, used for both practical and ceremonial purposes. So perhaps the captives were given coca to chew or something like that.

Also, I recall that before being sacrificed, the captives might have been fed a special diet. Maybe better food than usual to fatten them up or as part of the ritual. Oh, and maize beer might come into play here. Maize was a staple crop, and fermented maize beer, called chicha, was a common drink in rituals. So maybe the captives were given maize beer as part of the pre-sacrifice rituals.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: elite-sponsored feasts with war captives beheaded. Feasts with elites make sense because the upper class would sponsor such events. But I'm not sure if beheading was the method before sacrifice.

Option B: public humiliation, forced labor, and hallucinogens. Public humiliation could be part of it, but I'm not certain about forced labor before sacrifice. Also, hallucinogens might be involved, but I thought it was more about coca leaves and chicha.

Option C: ritualistic battles, coca leaves, bloodletting. Ritual battles sound plausible, but I'm not sure about bloodletting before sacrifice. Maybe, but I don't recall specifics.

Option D: communal feasts and torture. Torture before sacrifice? I'm not certain. Maybe, but I think it was more about rituals than torture.

Option E: improved diet, forced labor, coca. Improved diet makes sense as part of the preparation. Forced labor might not be directly before the sacrifice. But the use of coca fits.

Option F: ritual fasting, solitary confinement, psychedelics. Fasting seems possible, but I'm not sure about solitary confinement. Psychedelics might be more associated with other substances, not sure.

Option G: physical punishment, fasting, dances. Physical punishment could be part of it, but again, not certain.

Option H: elite feasts where captives fight to death. That sounds more like gladiatorial combat, which I think was more of an Aztec thing, not Inca.

Option I: ritual starvation, torture, blood. Starvation doesn't fit with the idea of being given a better diet. Torture again, not sure.

Option J: improved diet, coca, maize beer. This seems to fit. Improved diet, use of coca leaves, and maize beer. I think before being sacrificed, captives were given these things as part of the ritual to honor the gods and perhaps to make them more acceptable for sacrifice.

So putting it together, the correct answer would involve an improved diet, the use of coca leaves, and consumption of maize beer. Looking at the options, that's option J.

The question asks about the rituals preceding human sacrifice among the Inca. Based on the analysis, the Inca often treated captives with an improved diet, and they incorporated coca leaves and maize beer into their rituals. Among the options provided, option J aligns with these practices, as it includes an improved diet, the use of coca leaves, and the consumption of maize beer.

Answer: J
