Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about deception in experiments. Hmm, I remember that ethical guidelines in research are super important. Deception in experiments is a tricky topic because it involves not telling participants the whole truth, which can be problematic. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking what's essential for deception to be permissible. I think the key here is understanding the ethical standards, probably from something like the APA or other research ethics guidelines.

Option A: Participants have given informed consent to be deceived. Wait, but informed consent usually requires that participants know what's happening. If they're being deceived, they can't really give informed consent about the deception itself. So I don't think A is correct. Because how can you consent to being deceived without knowing what's going on?

Option B: Deception doesn't involve withholding information about the purpose. No, that doesn't make sense. Deception often involves withholding some info or providing false info about the purpose. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: The investigator explains the deception within 3 years after. That seems too long. I remember that debriefing should happen as soon as possible, usually right after the experiment. So C doesn't sound right.

Option D: The merits of the investigation warrant the deception. I think this is a key point. Ethics committees evaluate whether the potential benefits of the research outweigh the use of deception. So if the study is valuable and couldn't be done without deception, it might be allowed. So D could be a contender.

Option E: Deception involves false info about the purpose. Well, that's what deception often isâ€”providing false information. But is that an essential condition for it being permissible? Or is it more about the conditions under which it's allowed. I think providing false info is part of deception, but the question is about what makes it permissible. So E describes what deception is, not the condition for it being allowed.

Option F: Deception is revealed at the end, but only if they ask. No, I think debriefing should be done regardless. Participants should always be told about the deception after, not just if they ask. So F isn't correct.

Putting it together, the essential condition is that the benefits of the research (merits) must justify the deception. Because without a good reason, you can't deceive participants. So the correct answer should be D.

For deception in an experiment to be permissible, it is essential that the merits or value of the scientific investigation warrant the type of deception used. This ensures that the potential benefits of the research outweigh the ethical concerns associated with deceiving participants. 

Answer: D
