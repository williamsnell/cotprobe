Okay, so I've got this problem about air flowing through a nozzle encountering a shock. The question gives me some values and asks how much the velocity has changed across the shock. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the given data: the Mach number upstream is Mx = 1.8, and the static temperature downstream is Ty = 800°R. Gamma is 1.4, which is the usual value for air. I need to find the change in velocity across the shock, which I think means I need to find the velocity upstream and downstream and subtract them.

Wait, but wait. Velocity change is the difference between downstream and upstream velocity, right? Or is it the other way around. Oh, right, it's the absolute difference, but I think in this context, it's probably asking for the magnitude of the change.

So I remember that when a shock wave occurs, it's a discontinuity where the flow properties change abruptly. For this, I should use the Rankine-Hugoniot relations, or maybe the normal shock relations. Right, because the shock is normal here, assuming it's a one-dimensional flow.

So the key parameters to find are the Mach number downstream (My), the static temperatures, and then the velocities. Because velocity is related to Mach number and the speed of sound.

Wait, let's outline the steps. First, I think I need to find the downstream Mach number, My. Then, knowing the temperatures, find the speed of sound upstream and downstream, and then calculate the velocities.

Wait, but wait, the static temperature downstream is given as Ty = 800 R. Hmm, but the static temperature upstream isn't given. Hmm, maybe I can find it using the shock relations.

I think the process goes like this: For a normal shock, the upstream and downstream properties are related via the Mach number. The formula for the temperature ratio across the shock is (Ty)/(Tx) = [ ( (γ+1)Mx² ) / ( ( ( γ-1 ) Mx² + 2 ) ) ] * [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx² + 2 ) ) / ( (γ+1) ) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, so I need to remember. I think the static temperature ratio after a shock is [ ( ( (γ+1) Mx² ) / ( ( (γ-1) Mx² + 2 ) ) ) ] multiplied by something else. Wait, no, perhaps it's Ty/Tx = [ ( ( (γ+1) Mx² ) / ( ( (γ-1) Mx² + 2 ) ) ) ] * [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx² + 2 ) ) / ( (γ+1)² Mx² ) ) ] ?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with the relation for stagnation temperature. Another approach: The stagnation temperature doesn't change across a shock, right? Because the shock is adiabatic but not isentropic. So maybe I can find the stagnation temperatures and relate them.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The stagnation temperature upstream equals the stagnation temperature downstream because a shock is an adiabatic process (no heat transfer), but it's not isentropic because entropy increases. So, the total temperature (stagnation) remains the same across the shock.

So, the total temperature upstream, Tx_total, equals the total temperature downstream, Ty_total.

The total temperature is given by T_total = T_static * [1 + ( (γ-1)/2 ) M^2 ].

So, Tx_total = Tx * [1 + ( (γ-1)/2 ) Mx^2 ]

Ty_total = Ty * [1 + ( (γ-1)/2 ) My^2 ]

Since Tx_total = Ty_total, I can set them equal:

Tx * [1 + ((γ-1)/2) Mx^2 ] = Ty * [1 + ((γ-1)/2) My^2 ]

But wait, I don't know Tx, the static temperature upstream. Hmm. Maybe I can find Tx first using the shock relations. Alternatively, perhaps I can find My first.

Wait, for a normal shock, the downstream Mach number My can be found from the upstream Mach number using the relation:

My = sqrt( ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) / ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) * ( (γ+1) ) / ( (γ-1) ) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. I think the formula is My^2 = [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) * ( (γ-1) ) ) / ( (γ+1)^2 Mx^2 ) ) ].

Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the relation for My is sqrt( [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) / ( ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) ) ) ] * ( (γ-1) ) / (γ+1) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that gives My in terms of Mx. I think the correct formula for My is sqrt( [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) / ( ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) ) ) ] * ( (γ-1) ) / (γ+1) ) )

Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think differently. The continuity equation across the shock gives rho_x u_x = rho_y u_y. But for a normal shock, the relation between Mach numbers can be found using the Rayleigh equation or maybe the momentum equation.

Wait, another approach: The pressure ratio across the shock is given by (p_y/p_x) = 1 + (2 γ (Mx^2 -1))/(γ+1).

But I'm not sure if that helps me directly with the temperature. Maybe I should focus on the temperature ratio.

Wait, I remember that across a normal shock, the static temperature ratio can be found using:

(Ty)/(Tx) = [ ( ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) / ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) ] * [ ( ( (γ-1) My^2 + 2 ) ) / (γ+1) ) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the temperature ratio is (Ty)/(Tx) = [ ( ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) / ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) ] * [ ( ( (γ-1) My^2 + 2 ) ) / (γ+1) ) ]

Wait, but this seems complicated because I have both Tx and My as unknowns. Maybe I can find My first.

Wait, another formula: for a normal shock, the downstream Mach number My is given by My = sqrt( [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) / ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) ) ] * ( (γ-1) ) / (γ+1) ) )

Wait, perhaps. Let me plug in the numbers. Gamma is 1.4, Mx is 1.8.

So γ = 1.4, γ-1 = 0.4, γ+1 = 2.4.

Compute numerator inside the square root: ( (γ-1) Mx² + 2 ) = (0.4 * (1.8)^2 ) + 2.

1.8 squared is 3.24. 0.4 * 3.24 = 1.296. Add 2 gives 3.296.

Denominator: (γ+1) Mx² = 2.4 * 3.24 = 7.776.

So the first term inside the sqrt is (3.296 / 7.776) = approximately 0.4235.

Multiply by (γ-1)/(γ+1) )= 0.4/2.4 = 1/6 ≈ 0.16667.

So overall, My² = 0.4235 * 0.16667 ≈ 0.070583.

Wait, that can't be right. My squared is 0.07, so My would be about 0.265. That seems low, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. I think the correct formula for My after a normal shock is:

My = sqrt( [ ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) / ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) ) ] * ( (γ-1) ) / (γ+1) ) )

Wait, but perhaps I made an error in how I applied it. Let me try calculating it again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is My = sqrt( ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) * (γ-1) ) / ( (γ+1)^2 Mx^2 ) ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is My = sqrt( ( ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) / ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) * ( (γ-1) ) / (γ+1) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

My^2 = [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) ) * ( (γ-1) ) ) ] / [ ( (γ+1) Mx^2 ) ( (γ+1) ) ) ]

Which would be [ ( ( (γ-1) Mx^2 + 2 ) (γ-1) ) ] / [ (γ+1)^2 Mx^2 ) ]

So let me compute that.

Compute numerator: (γ-1) Mx² + 2 = 0.4*(3.24) + 2 = 1.296 + 2 = 3.296.

Multiply by (γ-1) again: 3.296 * 0.4 = 1.3184.

Denominator: (γ+1)^2 * Mx² = (2.4)^2 * 3.24 = 5.76 * 3.24 = let's calculate that. 5 *3.24=16.2, 0.76 *3.24≈2.4664. Total ≈18.6664.

So My^2 = 1.3184 / 18.6664 ≈ 0.0706.

So My ≈ sqrt(0.0706) ≈ 0.2656.

Hmm, so My is approximately 0.266, which is subsonic as expected after a shock when Mx >1.

But wait, how does that help me find the velocities? Maybe I should find the static temperatures.

Wait, I know Ty is 800 R. So I can find Tx because the stagnation temperatures are equal.

The stagnation temperature is T_total = T_static [ 1 + ( (gamma-1)/2 ) M^2 ]

So upstream, T_total_x = Tx [ 1 + (0.4/2) * (1.8)^2 ]

Which is Tx [1 + 0.2 * 3.24 ] = Tx [1 + 0.648] = Tx * 1.648.

Similarly, downstream, T_total_y = Ty [1 + (0.4/2) My^2 ].

But since T_total_x = T_total_y,

Tx * 1.648 = Ty [1 + 0.2 * (My)^2 ]

We have Ty = 800 R.

So Tx = [800 * (1 + 0.2*(My)^2 ) ] / 1.648.

Wait, My is 0.2656, so My squared is about 0.0706.

So 0.2 * 0.0706 ≈ 0.01412.

So 1 + 0.01412 ≈ 1.01412.

So Tx ≈ (800 * 1.01412 ) / 1.648.

Calculate numerator: 800 * 1.01412 ≈ 811.3.

Divide by 1.648: 811.3 / 1.648 ≈ let me compute that.

1.648 * 490 ≈ 1.648*400=659.2, 1.648*90=148.32 → 659.2+148.32=807.52. Hmm, 490 gives 807.52, which is a bit less than 811.3. So the difference is about 3.78. So 490 + (3.78/1.648) ≈ 490 + ~2.3 → 492.3.

So Tx ≈ 492.3 R.

Wait, but that's the static temperature upstream. Now, the next step is to find the velocities.

Velocity is M * a, where a is the speed of sound, which is sqrt(gamma*R*T). But since we're dealing with feet and seconds, I think R is 1716 ft²/(lb·slug·R) for air? Wait, I might be mixing units. Wait, in imperial units, the specific gas constant R for air is approximately 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R). But I'm not entirely confident, so perhaps I should double-check.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the velocities using the formula u = M * sqrt(gamma*R*T). Since R is 1716 ft²/(lb·slug·R), but when using consistent units, perhaps we can compute this.

Wait, but to get the velocity in ft/sec, I need to compute M * sqrt(gamma*R*T), but I have to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, perhaps I can just compute the speed of sound in both regions and then multiply by the respective Mach numbers to get the velocities.

So, the speed of sound upstream, a_x = sqrt(gamma * R * Tx ). Similarly, downstream a_y = sqrt(gamma * R * Ty).

But wait, gamma is 1.4, R is 1716 ft²/(lb·slug·°R), and temperatures are in °R.

So, a_x = sqrt(1.4 * 1716 * Tx )

Similarly, a_y = sqrt(1.4 * 1716 * Ty )

So let me compute a_x and a_y.

First, compute a_x: Tx is about 492.3 R.

So 1.4 *1716 = 2402.4.

2402.4 * 492.3 → Let me compute that. 2402.4 * 500 = 1,201,200, but since it's 492.3, which is 7.7 less than 500. So 2402.4 *7.7 ≈ 2400*7.7=18,480, so subtract 18,480 → 1,201,200 - 18,480 = 1,182,720. So sqrt(1,182,720) is the speed of sound upstream.

Wait, wait, no. Because a_x = sqrt( gamma R Tx ), so 1.4 * 1716 * Tx.

Wait, but 1.4 * 1716 = 2402.4, yes. Then 2402.4 * Tx (492.3) = 2402.4 * 492.3.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2402.4 * 492.3. Let me see:

2402.4 * 400 = 960,960.

2402.4 *90 = 216,216.

2402.4 *2.3 = let's compute 2402.4*2=4804.8, 2402.4*0.3=720.72 → total 5525.52.

So total is 960,960 + 216,216 = 1,177,176 + 5,525.52 = 1,182,701.52.

So a_x = sqrt(1,182,701.52) → let's compute sqrt(1,182,701.52).

Well, 1,088^2 = 1,183,  1,088^2 is 1,183,  so sqrt(1,182,701.52) is approximately 1,088 ft/s. Wait, because 1,088 *1,088 = 1,183, 444. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, 1088^2 = (1000+88)^2 = 1,000,000 + 2*1000*88 + 88^2 = 1,000,000 + 176,000 + 7,744 = 1,183,744. Hmm, which is a bit higher than 1,182,701. So the square root would be a bit less than 1088.

Let me compute 1088^2 = 1,183,744. The a_x squared is 1,182,701.52, which is 1,183,744 - 1,042.48. So the square root is 1088 - (1,042.48)/(2*1088) approximately. 1,042.48/(2176) ≈ 0.479. So a_x ≈ 1088 - 0.48 ≈ 1087.52 ft/s.

Similarly, compute a_y: a_y = sqrt(1.4 * 1716 * Ty ). Ty is 800 R.

1.4 *1716 = 2402.4, same as before.

2402.4 * 800 = 1,921,920.

So a_y = sqrt(1,921,920). Let's compute that. 1,386^2 = 1,920,996, because 1,386*1,386 is 1,920,996. So the square is 1,921,920, which is 1,921,920 - 1,920,996 = 924 higher. So sqrt(1,921,920) = 1,386 + (924)/(2*1386) → 924/2772 ≈ 0.333. So a_y≈1386.333 ft/s.

Wait, but 1,386^2 is 1,920,996, and 1,386.5^2 would be (1,386 + 0.5)^2 = 1,386^2 + 2*1,386*0.5 + 0.25 → 1,920,996 + 1,386 + 0.25 = 1,922,382.25. Which is higher than 1,921,920, so the square root is between 1386 and 1386.5.

Wait, 1,921,920 - 1,
