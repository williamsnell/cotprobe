Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a 15-year-old male who presents with a painless swelling in his left testicle. The swelling has varied in size over several months, and there's no history of trauma. The key points from the physical exam are that the lesion transilluminates well, and there are no palpable inguinal nodes. Also, the testicular scan findings are normal.

Hmm, I remember that when a testicular mass transilluminates, it's usually a cystic structure because solid masses don't let light through. So transillumination is a sign of a cyst, maybe something like a hydrocele. But wait, the patient is a teenager, so I should think about possible conditions in that age group.

Hydroceles are common and can cause the testicle to swell. They often vary in size depending on the time of day or activity. Since there's no trauma, that makes a hydrocele more likely than, say, a traumatic hematoma. Also, the absence of inguinal nodes suggests there's no significant infection or malignancy, because those would often cause lymphadenopathy.

The testicular scan being normal probably rules out things like testicular torsion or epididymitis, which would show different findings. So the scan supports that it's a benign condition, maybe a hydrocele or an epididymal cyst.

Now, considering management options. Let's look at the choices:

A: Ultrasonic therapy — I don't think that's a standard treatment for hydroceles.
B: Cryotherapy — That's more for certain skin lesions or warts, not testicular cysts.
C: Needle biopsy — If it were a solid mass with suspicion of cancer, biopsy would make sense, but this is cystic and the scan is normal.
D: Radiation therapy — That's for cancer treatment, which doesn't fit here.
E: Laser therapy — Not a typical treatment for hydroceles.
F: Chemotherapy — Again, for cancer, which seems unlikely.
G: Needle aspiration — Could be an option, but it might not be definitive because the fluid can recur.
H: Injection with a sclerosing agent — I've heard of sclerotherapy being used for hydroceles, where a substance is injected to cause inflammation and prevent fluid accumulation.
I: Surgical repair — That's a common treatment for hydroceles, especially if it's large or symptomatic.
J: Oral medication — Not usually used for hydroceles.

So the options are between G, H, and I. Needle aspiration might give temporary relief but doesn't fix the problem permanently. Sclerotherapy is less invasive but may have varying success rates. Surgical repair is more definitive, especially if the hydrocele is large and causing discomfort or cosmetic issues.

Given the patient's age and that the swelling varies, a hydrocele is likely. The management would probably involve surgical repair if it's causing problems. Since the question says the swelling has varied over months but no mention of pain, maybe they're looking for the most appropriate next step. But since the lesion transilluminates and the scan is normal, it's probably a hydrocele that's benign.

Alternatively, sometimes epididymal cysts are managed with aspiration or sclerotherapy, but if it's a hydrocele, surgical repair (hydrocelectomy) is a standard approach.

So looking back at the options, the most appropriate management for a hydrocele would be either H (sclerosing agent) or I (surgical repair). I'm trying to remember which is more commonly recommended. I think surgical repair is often the definitive treatment, especially in younger patients where the hydrocele is more likely to persist.

Wait, but in some cases, especially if the patient is asymptomatic, they might just monitor. However, since the swelling has varied and the patient is seeking care, intervention is needed.

So, putting it all together, the most appropriate management would be surgical repair. So the answer would be I: surgical repair. Or perhaps aspiration, but I think surgery is more definitive.

The patient is a 15-year-old male presenting with a painless, variable-sized swelling in the left testicle. The swelling transilluminates well, indicating a cystic structure, likely a hydrocele. The absence of inguinal lymphadenopathy and normal testicular scan findings further support a benign condition, ruling out malignancy or infection. 

Considering management options, needle aspiration (G) might provide temporary relief but does not offer a definitive solution. Sclerotherapy (H) is less invasive but has variable success rates. Surgical repair (I), or hydrocelectomy, is the most definitive treatment, especially for persistent or symptomatic hydroceles. Given the patient's age and the likelihood of a hydrocele, surgical repair is the most appropriate management.
