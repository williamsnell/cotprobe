Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium concentrations. Hmm, let me read through it again. The reaction is I2(g) ⇌ 2I(g), and the equilibrium constant K is 3.76 × 10^-5 at 1000 K. They inject 1 mole of I2 into a 2.00-liter box at that temperature. I need to find the equilibrium concentrations of I2 and I.

Alright, I remember that for these kinds of problems, setting up an ICE table is a good approach. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. Let me try that.

The initial concentrations: since the volume is 2 liters, the initial concentration of I2 is 1 mole / 2 L = 0.5 M. And the initial concentration of I is 0 because we're starting with just I2.

So the ICE table looks like this:

I2: 0.5 M initially. Then, as the reaction proceeds, some of the I2 will decompose into I. Let's let the change be x. So, for every mole of I2 that decomposes, it produces 2 moles of I. So the change would be:

I2: -x
I: +2x

At equilibrium, the concentrations would be:

I2: 0.5 - x
I: 2x

Now, the equilibrium expression for K is K = [I]^2 / [I2]. Plugging in the equilibrium concentrations:

K = (2x)^2 / (0.5 - x) = 4x² / (0.5 - x)

We know K is 3.76e-5, so:

4x² / (0.5 - x) = 3.76e-5

Now, I need to solve for x. Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation. Let's multiply both sides by (0.5 - x) to get rid of the denominator.

4x² = 3.76e-5 * (0.5 - x)

Expanding the right side:

4x² = (3.76e-5 * 0.5) - (3.76e-5)x
4x² = 1.88e-5 - 3.76e-5 x

Let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:

4x² + 3.76e-5 x - 1.88e-5 = 0

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the signs. When I move everything to the left, it becomes:

4x² + 3.76e-5 x - 1.88e-5 = 0

Hmm, but wait. Let's think about the values. Since K is small (3.76e-5 is a small number), that suggests that the reaction doesn't proceed much. So x should be much smaller than 0.5. Which means that 0.5 - x is approximately 0.5. So maybe we can make an approximation to simplify the calculation.

If x is much smaller than 0.5, then 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5. Then the equation becomes:

4x² / 0.5 ≈ 3.76e-5
Which simplifies to 8x² ≈ 3.76e-5
So x² ≈ 3.76e-5 /8 = 4.7e-6
x ≈ sqrt(4.7e-6) ≈ 2.167e-3

Wait, but if x is 0.002167, then 0.5 - x is about 0.4978, which is very close to 0.5. So our initial approximation holds.

But wait, maybe the approximation is good enough, but let's check with the exact equation.

The exact equation is 4x² + 3.76e-5 x -1.88e-5=0.

Plugging in x≈0.002167:

4*(0.002167)^2 = 4*(4.7e-6) = 1.88e-5
3.76e-5 * 0.002167 ≈ 3.76e-5 * 2.167e-3 = approximately 8.15e-8
So the left side is 1.88e-5 + 8.15e-8 -1.88e-5 ≈ 8.15e-8, which is not zero. Hmm, that suggests that the approximation isn't perfect, but perhaps it's close enough.

Alternatively, maybe I should not make the approximation and solve the quadratic equation properly.

So the quadratic equation is 4x² + 3.76e-5 x -1.88e-5 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 32a c)]/(2a). Wait, no, the formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Wait, no: the standard form is ax² + bx +c =0, so here a=4, b=3.76e-5, c= -1.88e-5.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac = (3.76e-5)^2 -4*4*(-1.88e-5)
Calculate each part:

(3.76e-5)^2 = (approx) 1.41e-9
4*4 =16; 16*(-1.88e-5) = -3.008e-4, but since it's -4ac and c is negative, that becomes positive: 4*4*1.88e-5 = 16 *1.88e-5 = 3.008e-4.

So D = 1.41e-9 + 3.008e-4 ≈ 3.008e-4 + 0.00000000141 ≈ 3.008141e-4.

Square root of D is sqrt(3.008141e-4) ≈ 0.01734 approximately. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.01734 squared is (0.01734)^2 = 0.0003007 approx. Which is a bit higher than 3.008e-4 (which is 0.0003008). So perhaps sqrt(D) is approximately 0.017338.

So x = [ -3.76e-5 ± 0.017338 ] / (2*4) 

We can ignore the negative root because concentration can't be negative, so:

x = [ -3.76e-5 + 0.017338 ] / 8 

Compute numerator: 0.017338 - 0.0000376 = 0.0173004

So x ≈ 0.0173004 /8 ≈ 0.00216255 M.

So x≈0.002163 M.

Wait, that's approximately 2.163e-3 M.

So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[I2] = 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5 - 0.002163 = 0.497837 M.

[I] = 2x ≈ 2 * 0.002163 = 0.004326 M.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says I = 2.17e5 M, which is 217000 M, but wait, that's way too high. Oh wait, no, that's 2.17e5 M. Wait, that's 2.17 ×10^5 M, which is 217,000 M. That's impossible because we started with 0.5 M I2 and it's only partially dissociating. So that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, my calculation gives [I] as 0.004326 M, which is 4.326e-3 M. But looking at the options, they have I in the range of 1e5 to 6.5e5 M, which is much higher. Did I miscalculate somewhere?

Wait, hold on, let me recheck the setup. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the units or the value of K.

Wait the problem states K is 3.76 × 10^-5. Oh wait, no, the exponent is written as 10\Elzbar5, which probably means 10^-5. So K is 3.76e-5.

Wait, but if K is 3.76e-5, that's a small value, so the reaction doesn't proceed much, so [I] should be small, not in the 1e5 range.

Wait, the options must be in M, but their values are way too high. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, let's think again about the ICE table.

Wait, initial concentration of I2 is 1 mole / 2 L = 0.5 M. Correct.

Change: I2 decreases by x, I increases by 2x. Correct.

K = [I]^2/[I2] = (2x)^2/(0.5 -x) = 4x²/(0.5 -x) = 3.76e-5.

But when I solved, I got x ≈ 0.002163, so [I] = 0.004326 M, which is 4.326e-3 M.

Looking at the options, none of them have [I] in the 1e-3 range. So perhaps I messed up the setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the equilibrium expression.

Wait, the reaction is I2 ⇌ 2I. So the correct K expression is [I]^2/[I2].

Yes, that's what I used. So that part's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me re-calculate the equation.

So 4x²/(0.5 -x) = 3.76e-5.

Assuming that x is small, 0.5 -x ≈ 0.5.

So 4x² / 0.5 = 3.76e-5 → 8x² =3.76e-5 → x²= (3.76e-5)/8 = 4.7e-6 → x= sqrt(4.7e-6)≈ 0.002167.

Wait, that gives [I] = 2x ≈ 0.004334 M, which is 4.334e-3 M.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest I can see is option C: I =1.88e5 M, which is way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the value of K. The given K is 3.76 ×10^-5. Wait, that's correct as K is small, favoring reactants.

Wait, but maybe the problem uses Kp instead of Kc? No, the problem states K is given, and the reaction is in terms of concentrations, so it's Kc.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach. Let me re-express the equation.

Let me let the initial concentration of I2 be 0.5 M, as before.

At equilibrium:

[I2] = 0.5 - x
[I] = 2x

K = (2x)^2 / (0.5 -x) = 4x²/(0.5 -x) =3.76e-5

Assuming x is small, 0.5 -x ≈0.5, so 4x²/0.5 = 8x² = 3.76e-5 → x²= 4.7e-6 → x= 0.002167.

So [I] = 0.004334 M, [I2] = 0.4978 M.

Wait, but none of the options match this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: I =1.88e5 M and I2=0.501 M → No, way too high.

Option E: I=2.17e5 and I2=0.5.

Hmm, perhaps I have a mistake in the exponents. Wait, maybe I confused 10^-5 with 10^-3 somewhere.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, if K is 3.76e-5, then 4x²/(0.5) = 3.76e-5 → x²= (3.76e-5 * 0.5 )/(4) → x²= (1.88e-5)/4=4.7e-6 → x= ~0.002167.

So [I] is 2x=0.004334 M, which is 4.334e-3 M.

Looking at the options again, I don't see any that have [I] around 4.3e-3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem said 3.76 ×10^5, not 10^-5? Let me check the question again.

The question says K=3.76 ×10^5? No, wait, no. The original question says "3.76 × 10\Elzbar5at 1000°K". Hmm, the notation is a bit odd. Wait, the LaTeX code is 10\Elzbar5, which probably represents 10^-5, because Elzbar is a notation for a horizontal line below, like in the exponent. So K is 3.76e-5.

So I think my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I'm misreading them. Let me check again.

Option B: I = 2.17e5 M and I2 = 0.498 M.

Wait, 2.17e5 M is 217,000 M, which is way higher than what I calculated (0.0043 M). That can't be right unless I messed up the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I inverted K. Because maybe I should have used K = [I2]/[I]^2 instead. Let me think.

No, the reaction is I2 ⇌ 2I, so K should be [I]^2/[I2].

Wait, let me double-check that.

Yes, products over reactants, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

So K = [I]^2/[I2]. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that x is small is incorrect. Maybe x is a significant fraction of 0.5, so the approximation 0.5 -x ≈0.5 isn't valid. Let's test that.

Let me solve the exact equation without approximation:

4x² + 3.76e-5 x -1.88e-5 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, a=4, b=3.76e-5, c= -1.88e-5.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (3.76e-5)^2 -4*4*(-1.88e-5) 

Calculate each term:

(3.76e-5)^2 = (3.76)^2 *1e-10 = 14.1376e-10 = 1.41376e-9.

-4ac = -4 *4*(-1.88e-5) = 16*1.88e-5 = 3.008e-4.

So D = 1.41376e-9 + 3.008e-4 = approx 3.008141376e-4.

Square root of D: sqrt(3.008141376e-4) = approximately 0.017338.

So x = [ -b ± sqrt(D) ]/(2a) → since x must be positive, take the positive root.

x = [ -3.76e-5 +0.017338 ] / 8 → (0.017338 - 0.0000376) = 0.0173004 → divided by 8 → 0.00216255 M.

So x ≈ 0.002163 M, same as before. So the approximation holds, and x is small.

Thus, [I] is about 0.004326 M, [I2] is about 0.4978 M.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: I=2.17e5, I2=0.498 M. No, [I] is way off.

Option E: I=2.17e5, I2=0.5. Nope.

Option C: I=1.88e5, I2=0.501. No.

Wait, perhaps the K value was given as 3.76 ×10^5 instead of 1e-5? That would make K very large, so the reaction goes almost to completion, which would make [I] very high. Let me check the question again.

The question says K=3.76 ×10⁵? Or 10^-5?

Wait, the original question has K written as 3.76 × 10\Elzbar5. The LaTeX code is 10\Elzbar5, which is a way to write 10^-5, as Elzbar is a horizontal bar under the 5, indicating the exponent is negative.

So K is 3.76e-5, but that leads to [I]= ~0.0043 M, which isn't in any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I inverted the reaction. Because if the reaction were 2I ⇌ I2, then K would be 1/(3.76e-5) = ~26628. But that's not the case here.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The reaction is I2 ⇌ 2I. So K is [I]^2/[I2] =3.76e-5.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial moles are 1 mole of I2 in 2 liters, but perhaps the volume is not 2 liters after equilibrium? No, volume is constant, so concentrations are as I calculated.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 4x²/(0.5 -x)=3.76e-5.

Assuming x is small, 0.5 -x ≈0.5 → 4x² =3.76e-5 *0.5 → 4x²=1.88e-5 → x²=4.7e-6 → x=0.002167.

So [I]=2x=0.004334 M, which is 4.334e-3 M.

Looking at the options, none of them have [I] in this range. So
