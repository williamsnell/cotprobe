Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ethnic identity, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is, "Ethnic identity refers to..." and there are ten options labeled A through J.

First, I should recall what ethnic identity means. From what I remember, ethnic identity is about how individuals identify with a particular ethnic group. It involves the cultural practices, traditions, and the sense of belonging to that group.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a rejection of Caucasian standards. That doesn't sound right because ethnic identity isn't about rejecting another group's standards; it's more about identifying with your own.

Option B is about rejecting all cultural traditions. No, that's more like being against culture in general, not ethnic identity.

Option C mentions the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions. This sounds closer because it's about how much a person identifies with their group's culture.

Option D talks about non-Western practices. That seems too narrow because ethnic identity can include any group, not just non-Western ones.

Option E is about only Western traditions. Again, that's too specific and doesn't cover all ethnic groups.

Option F is about rejecting one's own traditions. That might be more about assimilation, not identity.

Option G is about adopting multiple identities. While possible, I'm not sure if that's the definition of ethnic identity itself.

Option H refers to practicing the majority culture. That sounds like acculturation or assimilation, not ethnic identity.

Option I is about the collective practices of minority communities. That's more of a group-level definition, but the question is about individual identity.

Option J is about adopting the dominant group's practices, which again seems more like assimilation.

So, going back, the correct answer should be about an individual endorsing and practicing their own group's traditions. That points to option C.

The correct answer is C. Ethnic identity refers to the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group.

Answer: C
