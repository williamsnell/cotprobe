Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that the position of an object is given by the equation x = 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25, where x is in meters and t is in seconds. I need to find the acceleration at t = 1.50 seconds. The options are from A to J, and each option is a different acceleration value.

Hmm, right. I remember that in kinematics, acceleration is the second derivative of the position with respect to time. So first, I need to find the first derivative, which gives velocity, and then the second derivative, which gives acceleration.

Let me write down the position equation again: x(t) = 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25. To find velocity, I take the first derivative of x with respect to t. The derivative of t³ is 3t², so 2.0 * 3t² would be 6t². The derivative of 4.0t is 4.0. The derivative of a constant like 6.25 is zero. So the velocity function v(t) is 6t² + 4 m/s.

Now, I need the acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. So taking the derivative of 6t² gives 12t, and the derivative of 4 is zero. So acceleration a(t) is 12t m/s².

Wait, but wait a second. So at any time t, the acceleration is 12t? That makes sense because the acceleration is increasing linearly with time. So at t = 1.50 seconds, I plug that value into the acceleration equation.

Let me calculate that: a(1.50) = 12 * 1.50. 12 times 1 is 12, and 12 times 0.5 is 6, so 12 + 6 is 18. So the acceleration is 18 m/s² at that time.

Now, looking at the options, option J is 18 m/s². So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Maybe I miscalculated the derivatives. Let me go through each step again.

Position: x = 2t³ +4t +6.25.

First derivative (velocity): dx/dt = 6t² +4. That's correct.

Second derivative (acceleration): d²x/dt² = 12t. Right, because the derivative of 6t² is 12t. So yeah, at t=1.5, it's 12 * 1.5 = 18 m/s².

So yeah, the correct answer is J. I think I got it right.

To determine the acceleration of the object at \( t = 1.50 \, \text{s} \), we start with the position equation:

\[
x(t) = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25
\]

Acceleration is the second derivative of the position with respect to time. First, we find the velocity by taking the first derivative of \( x(t) \):

\[
v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 6t^2 + 4 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Next, we find the acceleration by taking the derivative of \( v(t) \):

\[
a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = 12t \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

At \( t = 1.50 \, \text{s} \), the acceleration is:

\[
a(1.50) = 12 \cdot 1.50 = 18 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: 18 m/s²**

Answer: J
