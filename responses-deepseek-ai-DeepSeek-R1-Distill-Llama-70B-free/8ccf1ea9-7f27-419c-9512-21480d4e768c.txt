Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about auditor independence and objectivity. Hmm, I remember that auditors need to maintain their independence and objectivity to ensure their work is unbiased. If there's a situation that impairs these, it's a problem.

Let's look at the options one by one. The question is asking which situation does NOT impair objectivity, integrity, or independence.

Option A: An auditor's son gets an internship at the client. I think this could create a conflict. The auditor might feel obliged to the client, affecting their judgment. So this might impair independence.

Option B: Auditor invests significantly in the client. That's a clear no-no. If the auditor has a financial stake, their decisions could be biased. Definitely impairs independence.

Option C: Client takes the team out to dinner. Well, taking clients out for meals can be a gray area. I remember that minor hospitality, like meals, is usually acceptable as long as it's not extravagant. So maybe this doesn't impair objectivity.

Option D: Client offers a luxury retreat. That sounds like a big deal. Trips, especially luxury ones, could definitely influence the auditors. This impairs independence.

Option E: Box seats for the baseball season. That's a significant gift. Receiving such tickets could create a obligation, so this would impair objectivity.

Option F: Significant discount on products. If the discount is big, it could influence the auditor's decisions. They might be more lenient in their audit to keep getting the discount. So this impairs independence.

Option G: Front row concert tickets. Those are expensive. Receiving such tickets could be seen as a bribe, affecting the auditor's independence.

Option H: Gifting a luxury car to the CFO. That's a clear conflict. Giving such a gift creates a direct financial relationship, impairing independence.

Option I: Trip to Las Vegas for the weekend. That's a lavish entertainment, which would likely impair the auditor's independence.

Option J: Two-day ski trip after working weekends. This seems like a reward for hard work. But accepting such trips could create a close relationship, which might impair objectivity.

Now, the question is which one does NOT impair. From the options, C seems the most likely. A dinner at a nice restaurant is a common business practice and usually acceptable if it's not excessive. The others involve more substantial benefits or direct financial ties. So the correct answer should be C.
</think>

The correct answer is **C**.

**Explanation:**

- **Option A:** The auditor's son receiving an internship could create a conflict of interest, potentially impairing independence.
- **Option B:** A significant financial investment in the client creates a direct financial tie, impairing independence.
- **Option C:** A dinner at a restaurant, especially if not extravagant, is generally considered acceptable and does not impair objectivity or independence.
- **Option D:** A luxury retreat is excessive and would likely impair independence.
- **Option E:** Box seats are a significant gift that could create obligations, impairing objectivity.
- **Option F:** A significant discount on products could influence the auditor's decisions, impairing independence.
- **Option G:** Front row concert tickets are expensive and could act as a bribe, affecting independence.
- **Option H:** Gifting a luxury car creates a direct financial relationship, impairing independence.
- **Option I:** A trip to Las Vegas is lavish and would impair independence.
- **Option J:** A ski trip could create a close relationship, potentially impairing objectivity.

Thus, **Option C** is the correct choice as it does not impair objectivity, integrity, or independence.
