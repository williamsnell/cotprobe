Okay, so I've got this problem about a transformer, and I'm a bit nervous because transformers can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says it's a 10-kVA, 2400-240-V, single-phase transformer. So the primary voltage is 2400 V, and the secondary is 240 V. They give the resistances and leakage reactances for the primary and secondary. I need to find the primary voltage required to produce 240 V at the secondary terminals at full load for two cases: when the load power factor is 0.8 lagging and 0.8 leading.

Wait, full load means the current is at its maximum, right? The kVA is 10, so I think the full load current can be calculated using the formula: I = VA / V. So for the secondary, the full load current would be 10,000 VA / 240 V = about 41.6667 A. But wait, since it's a transformer, the current on the primary side would be different because of the turns ratio.

The first thing I need to do is find the turns ratio. The turns ratio a is V1/V2. So a = 2400 / 240 = 10. So the primary has 10 times the turns of the secondary.

Now, the resistances and reactances are given for the primary (r1, x1) and secondary (r2, x2). But I think I need to refer all of these to one side, probably the secondary, because the load is on the secondary. Alternatively, I can refer them to the primary. Hmm, which is easier? Let me think.

Wait, the standard approach is to refer all parameters to the secondary side. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, when calculating the voltage regulation, it's often easier to refer everything to the secondary. Or maybe to the primary. I'm a bit confused. Let me recall the formulas.

The voltage regulation in a transformer is the difference between the no-load voltage and the full-load voltage. The regulation is calculated considering the voltage drops due to the resistance and reactance. So the equation for the secondary terminal voltage V2 is: 

V2 = E2 - I2 (r2' + jx2') 

Wait, no. Actually, the induced EMF in the secondary is E2, and the terminal voltage V2 is E2 minus the voltage drop across the leakage impedance. So, E2 = V2 + I2 (r2 + jx2), or something like that.

But wait, let's get back to the problem. The question says that the secondary terminal voltage is 240 V. So the EMF induced in the secondary would be higher than that because of the voltage drops.

Wait, no. Wait, the EMF induced in the secondary (E2) is when the transformer is under no load. But when there's a load, current flows, causing voltage drops in the leakage impedance. So, the terminal voltage V2 is E2 minus the voltage drop I2*(r2 + jx2), right?

Wait, no, E2 is the EMF induced in the secondary when the primary is connected to its source, and it's equal to the terminal voltage plus the voltage drop due to the load current. So, E2 = V2 + I2 (r2 + jx2).

Wait, but in terms of phasors, it's E2 = V2 + I2 (R2 + j X2). So, the voltage needed on the primary side would have to account for these drops.

But wait, the question is about finding the primary voltage required so that the secondary voltage is 240 V under full load. So perhaps I should model the transformer with the load and calculate the required primary voltage.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the equivalent circuit of the transformer. The equivalent circuit includes the primary resistance r1, secondary resistance r2, primary leakage reactance x1, secondary leakage reactance x2, and the magnetizing impedance, which is usually neglected for regulation calculations.

Wait, right. For voltage regulation, we can ignore the magnetizing current since it's small. So the equivalent circuit would be a series impedance of (r1 + r2') and (x1 + x2'), referred to either side. Wait, but r2' is the secondary resistance referred to the primary. So, if I'm going to refer all to the primary, then r2' = a^2 * r2, similarly for x2'.

Alternatively, maybe I should refer everything to the secondary side. Hmm.

Let me clarify. The transformer's equivalent circuit can be represented as a series combination of resistance and reactance between the primary and secondary. So, the primary has r1 and x1, and the secondary has r2 and x2. But to model them correctly, I should refer either the primary or secondary quantities to the other side.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, the transformer's rated kVA is 10 kVA. The primary voltage is 2400 V, secondary 240 V. So the turns ratio a is V1/V2 = 2400/240 = 10.

So, a = 10.

Therefore, the primary current I1 is related to the secondary current I2 by I1 = I2 / a. Because V1/I1 = V2/I2, so I1 = (V2 I2) / V1 = I2 /a. So when the secondary is at full load, I2 is (10,000 VA) / 240 V = approx 41.6667 A.

Wait, no. Wait, VA = V * I, so I = VA / V. So I2 = 10,000 / 240 ≈ 41.6667 A.

So, I2 is 41.6667 A at full load.

Now, the problem has two parts: (a) when the load power factor is 0.8 lagging, and (b) 0.8 leading.

Power factor (pf) is the cosine of the angle between voltage and current. Lagging means the current is lagging the voltage, so it's inductive. Leading means the current is leading, so it's capacitive.

So, for each case, the load has a certain impedance, and the current I2 will have a phase angle relative to the voltage.

But since the transformer is supplying this current, the primary side must supply the necessary voltage to overcome the voltage drops in the transformer's internal impedances.

So, the approach would be:

1. For each case, calculate the secondary current I2 (which we have as 41.6667 A) and its phase angle.

2. Compute the voltage drop in the transformer's leakage impedance on the secondary side.

3. The induced EMF E2 is the terminal voltage V2 plus the voltage drop.

4. Then, since E2 is related to the primary induced EMF E1 via the turns ratio, E1 = a * E2. And the primary voltage V1 must be equal to E1, because on the primary side, with the magnetizing current neglected, the primary induced EMF is approximately equal to the supply voltage. Wait, no, because there's also the primary voltage drop due to the primary resistance and reactance.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The primary side has resistance r1 and reactance x1. The current I1 flows through these, causing a voltage drop. So, the primary induced EMF E1 is equal to the supply voltage V1 minus the voltage drop I1*(r1 + jx1), right?

Wait, no. Because E1 is the EMF induced in the primary. The supply voltage V1 is connected to the primary, so under load, the supply voltage equals E1 plus the voltage drop I1*(r1 + jx1).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the transformer as a two-winding device with its own impedances.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to refer all the secondary quantities to the primary side.

So, referring the secondary resistance and reactance to the primary:

r2_ref = a² * r2 = (10)^2 * 0.03 Ω = 100 * 0.03 = 3 Ω.

Similarly, x2_ref = a² * x2 = 100 * 0.15 Ω = 15 Ω.

So now, the total resistance referred to the primary is r1 + r2_ref = 3 + 3 = 6 Ω.

The total reactance referred to the primary is x1 + x2_ref = 15 + 15 = 30 Ω.

So the total impedance referred to the primary is 6 + j30 Ω.

Now, the load current on the secondary is I2 = 41.6667 A at a power factor of 0.8.

But when we refer I2 to the primary, it becomes I1 = I2 / a = 41.6667 / 10 = 4.16667 A.

So the primary current I1 is 4.16667 A.

Now, considering the power factor, the current I2 can be leading or lagging.

So, when the power factor is 0.8 lagging, the current I2 lags the voltage V2 by an angle θ, where cosθ = 0.8, so θ ≈ 36.87 degrees.

Similarly, when leading, the current leads by the same angle.

Wait, but when referring to the primary, the current's phase angle relative to V1 would change. Wait, no, because the voltage and current in the primary are related to the secondary via the turns ratio and the phase shift. Wait, perhaps the angle remains the same because the transformer is ideal except for the impedances.

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think again.

The load on the secondary has a certain impedance, which can be calculated from the power factor and current.

The impedance Z2 is given by Z2 = V2 / I2 * (pf + j√(1 - pf²)).

Wait, since the voltage is V2, and the current is I2 with a certain pf.

So, for part (a), when pf is 0.8 lagging, the impedance Z2 is (240 V) / (41.6667 A) * (0.8 - j√(1 - 0.64)).

Wait, but wait, the current lags, so the impedance is inductive, so it'll have a positive reactance. So Z2 = (V2/I2) * (cosθ + j sinθ), where θ is the angle between voltage and current. Since it's lagging, θ is positive in the impedance.

Wait, actually, the impedance is Z = V / I = (V) / (I) where I is the phasor current. Since the current is lagging, the impedance is inductive, so the angle is positive in the impedance.

So, for part (a), pf = 0.8 lagging, so θ = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees. So, Z2 = (240) / (41.6667) * (0.8 + j0.6) ≈ (5.76 Ω) * (0.8 + j0.6) ≈ 4.608 + j3.456 Ω.

Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the impedance magnitude first. The magnitude of the impedance Z is V2/I2 = 240 / 41.6667 ≈ 5.76 Ω.

Then, the real part is 5.76 * 0.8 = 4.608 Ω, and the imaginary part is 5.76 * 0.6 = 3.456 Ω inductive.

So, Z2 = 4.608 + j3.456 Ω.

But wait, when the power factor is leading, the impedance would be capacitive, so the imaginary part would be negative. So for part (b), Z2 = 4.608 - j3.456 Ω.

Now, referring this impedance to the primary side. The impedance referred to the primary is Z2' = a² * Z2.

So, Z2' = (10)^2 * (4.608 + j3.456) = 100 * (4.608 + j3.456) = 460.8 + j345.6 Ω.

So, the total impedance in the primary circuit is the sum of the primary impedance and the referred secondary impedance: Z_total = (r1 + r2') + j(x1 + x2').

Wait, but earlier I computed r2' as 3Ω, x2' as 15Ω, so Z_total_primary = (3 + 3) + j(15 + 15) = 6 + j30 Ω.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. 

Since I've referred the secondary impedance to the primary, then the total load impedance on the primary side is Z_load' = (r2' + jx2') + (r1 + jx1) = (3 + 3) + j(15 + 15) = 6 + j30 Ω, as before.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the approach is to model the transformer with the primary and secondary impedances as a series combination, then add the load impedance referred to the primary.

So the equivalent circuit on the primary side would be the primary resistance r1, the primary reactance x1, and the referred load impedance Z_load'. So the total impedance is r1 + r2' + j(x1 + x2').

So in this case, the total impedance Z_eq = (3 + 3) + j(15 + 15) = 6 + j30 Ω.

Now, the primary current I1 is 4.16667 A. But wait, that's not correct, because the actual current would be determined by the source voltage V1 and the total impedance.

Wait, no. The primary current would be I1 = V1_source / (Z_eq), but since I1 is 4.16667 A, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the voltage drop in the transformer's impedance and then find the required primary voltage.

So, the primary voltage V1 must be equal to the induced EMF E1 plus the voltage drop due to the primary current I1 flowing through the primary impedance.

But wait, E1 is related to the secondary EMF E2 by the turns ratio. And E2 is the secondary terminal voltage V2 plus the voltage drop in the secondary's impedance, which is I2*(r2 + jx2).

Wait, let me try to structure this properly.

The transformer's secondary terminal voltage is V2 = 240 V. The load current is I2, which is 41.6667 A. The secondary voltage drop is I2*(r2 + jx2) = 41.6667*(0.03 + j0.15) ≈ 1.25 + j6.25 V.

So, the secondary induced EMF E2 is V2 + I2*(r2 + jx2) = 240 + 1.25 + j6.25 = 241.25 + j6.25 V.

Then, the primary induced EMF E1 is a * E2 = 10*(241.25 + j6.25) = 2412.5 + j62.5 V.

But the primary voltage V1 is not just E1; it also has to account for the voltage drop in the primary impedance due to the primary current I1.

The primary current I1 is I2 / a = 41.6667 / 10 ≈ 4.16667 A.

Wait, but according to the earlier approach, that would be so only if the impedance is neglected. But since the transformer has internal impedance, the actual I1 would be different. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the primary current I1 is the current that flows when the primary voltage is V1. So, the equivalent circuit on the primary side would have the source voltage V1, and the series impedance of (r1 + r2') + j(x1 + x2'), which is 6 + j30 Ω as calculated earlier. 

Wait, no, because the load is on the secondary, so when referring the load to the primary, it's in parallel with the magnetizing impedance, but for voltage regulation, the magnetizing current is small and can be neglected. So the equivalent circuit is a series combination of the primary impedance and the referred load impedance.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the voltage drop in the primary due to I1 and subtract that from E1 to get V1.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

E1 = V1 + I1 (r1 + jx1)

And E2 = V2 + I2 (r2 + jx2)

But E1 = a E2

So:

V1 + I1 (r1 + jx1) = a (V2 + I2 (r2 + jx2))

Since I2 = a I1 (because I1 = I2 / a), because V1 = a V2, so I1 = (V2 I2)/V1 = I2/(a).

So substituting I2 = a I1 into the equation:

V1 + I1 (r1 + jx1) = a V2 + a I1 (r2 + jx2)

Now, solving for V1:

V1 = a V2 + I1 [a (r2 + jx2) + (-r1 -jx1) ]

Wait, let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, the equation is:

V1 + I1 (r1 + jx1) = a V2 + a I1 (r2 + jx2)

So, V1 = a V2 + a I1 (r2 + jx2) - I1 (r1 + jx1)

= a V2 + I1 [ a (r2 + jx2) - (r1 + jx1) ]

Now, substituting the known values:

a =10, r1=3, x1=15, r2=0.03, x2=0.15.

So:

a (r2 + jx2) = 10*(0.03 + j0.15) = 0.3 + j1.5

Then, subtract (r1 + jx1) = 3 + j15.

So, 0.3 + j1.5 - 3 -j15 = (-2.7) + j(-13.5)

So, the term inside the brackets is (-2.7 - j13.5)

So:

V1 = a V2 + I1 [ (-2.7 - j13.5) ]

Now, I1 is the primary current, which is I2 / a.

I2 is the secondary current, which is determined by the load. Since the load has a certain power factor, we can find the angle of I2 relative to V2.

So, for part (a), the load has a power factor of 0.8 lagging. The load
