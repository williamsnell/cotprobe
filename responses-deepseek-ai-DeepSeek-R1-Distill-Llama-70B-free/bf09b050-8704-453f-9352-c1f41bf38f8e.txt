Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a mixture of KOH and Ca(OH)₂ being neutralized by an acid. The total equivalents needed to neutralize 4.221 grams of the mixture are exactly 0.100 equivalents. I need to find the initial composition by weight, choosing from options A to J.

Hmm, I remember that equivalents are based on the molar mass and the valency or the reaction each substance undergoes. For neutralization reactions, each hydroxide reacts with acid to produce a salt and water. So, I think for each hydroxide ion, one equivalent of acid is needed.

Wait, KOH dissociates into K+ and OH⁻. So each mole of KOH provides one mole of OH⁻. Similarly, Ca(OH)₂ dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 OH⁻, so each mole of Ca(OH)₂ provides two moles of OH⁻. So, the equivalents for each would be based on that.

Let me think about the equivalents. For KOH, the equivalent weight is the same as its molar mass because each mole gives one OH⁻. For Ca(OH)₂, each mole gives two OH⁻ ions, so the equivalent weight is (molar mass of Ca(OH)₂) / 2.

So, the first step is to calculate the molar masses.

The molar mass of KOH: K is about 39.1 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So 39.1 + 16 + 1 = 56.1 g/mol.

Molar mass of Ca(OH)₂: Ca is 40.08, O is 16*2=32, H is 2*(1)=2. So total is 40.08 + 32 + 2 = 74.08 g/mol.

Wait, but for Ca(OH)₂, each mole gives 2 equivalents, so the equivalent weight is 74.08 / 2 = 37.04 g/equivalent.

KOH's equivalent weight is 56.1 g/equivalent, since each mole is one equivalent.

So, the total equivalents from the mixture is 0.100 equivalents. Let's denote the mass of KOH as x grams, and the mass of Ca(OH)₂ as y grams. The total mass x + y = 4.221 g.

Each gram of KOH contributes (1/56.1) equivalents, and each gram of Ca(OH)₂ contributes (1/37.04) equivalents.

So, the equation for equivalents is (x/56.1) + (y/37.04) = 0.100.

And we have x + y = 4.221.

So substituting y = 4.221 - x into the first equation:

x/(56.1) + (4.221 - x)/(37.04) = 0.100.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the denominators:

56.1 is approximately 56.1, and 37.04 is approximately 37.04.

Let me write the equation:

x / 56.1 + (4.221 - x) / 37.04 = 0.1.

Multiply both sides by 56.1 * 37.04 to eliminate denominators.

Wait, that might get messy, but perhaps I can compute it numerically.

Alternatively, let's compute each term.

Let me rearrange the equation:

x (1/56.1 - 1/37.04) + 4.221 / 37.04 = 0.1.

Compute (1/56.1 - 1/37.04) first.

1/56.1 ≈ 0.017814.

1/37.04 ≈ 0.02699.

So 0.017814 - 0.02699 ≈ -0.009176.

So the equation becomes x*(-0.009176) + (4.221 / 37.04) = 0.1.

Compute 4.221 / 37.04:

37.04 goes into 4.221 how many times? Let's compute 4.221 /37.04 ≈ 0.1139 (since 37 * 0.1138 is approx 4.21).

So, equation is:

-0.009176 x + 0.1139 = 0.1.

Subtract 0.1139 from both sides:

-0.009176 x = 0.1 - 0.1139 → -0.0139.

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.009176 x = 0.0139.

x = 0.0139 / 0.009176 ≈ 1.514 grams.

So x ≈ 1.514 grams of KOH, and y = 4.221 - 1.514 = 2.707 grams of Ca(OH)₂.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: 1.52 g-KOH and 2,701 g Ca(OH)₂. Wait, that's 2701 grams? That can't be right because the total is 4.221 g. Oh, no, perhaps a typo, maybe 2.701?

Looking back at the options:

Option C: 1.52 g-KOH and 2,701 g Ca(OH)_2. Wait, 2,701 is 2701 grams, which is way too much. So that can't be correct. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps 2.701 grams?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

Let me compute 4.221 /37.04 accurately.

37.04 × 0.1138 → 37 × 0.1138 is approx 4.20, and 0.04 ×0.1138 is 0.00455, so total 4.20455. So 0.1138 × 37.04 = 4.20455, which is close to 4.221. So perhaps 4.221/37.04 ≈ 0.1139.

So, my previous calculation seems correct. So x is approximately 1.514 g, which is about 1.51 g, and y is about 2.707 g.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.4 g KOH and 2.7 g Ca(OH)₂. That's close to my y. But my x is about 1.51, which is closer to option C's 1.52 g.

Wait, option C says 1.52 g KOH and 2,701 g Ca(OH)₂. That's probably a typo, perhaps 2.701 g. If that's the case, then 1.52 + 2.701 = 4.221 g, which matches.

But looking back at the options, option C says "2,701 g Ca(OH)_2", which is 2701 grams. That can't be right because the total would be 1.52 + 2701 = 2702.52 grams, way more than 4.221. So perhaps that's a typo, perhaps it's 2.701 grams.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's try to compute more accurately.

Let me go back to the equation:

x/(56.1) + (4.221 - x)/(37.04) = 0.1.

Let me compute each term with more precision.

Compute (4.221 - x)/37.04.

Let me write the equation as:

x/(56.1) + (4.221 - x)/(37.04) = 0.1.

Let me compute this step by step.

Let me find a common denominator. Alternatively, let's multiply all terms by 56.1 * 37.04 to eliminate denominators.

So, 56.1 * 37.04 is the product. Let me compute that.

56 * 37 is 2072, 0.1 *37.04 is 3.704, 56.1*0.04 is 2.244. Hmm, perhaps better to compute 56.1 × 37.04.

Compute 56 × 37.04 = 2072.24.

0.1 × 37.04 = 3.704.

So, 56.1 ×37.04 = (56 ×37.04) + (0.1 ×37.04) = 2072.24 +3.704= 2075.944.

So, multiplying both sides by 2075.944:

x*(37.04) + (4.221 -x)*(56.1) = 0.1 * 2075.944.

Compute each term.

Left side: 37.04 x +56.1*(4.221 -x) = 37.04 x +56.1*4.221 -56.1 x.

Compute 56.1 *4.221.

56 *4.221 = 236.376, 0.1*4.221=0.4221. So total 236.376 +0.4221= 236.7981.

So, left side becomes 37.04x +236.7981 -56.1 x.

Combine like terms: (37.04 -56.1) x +236.7981.

37.04 -56.1 is -19.06.

So, left side is (-19.06 x) +236.7981.

Right side: 0.1 *2075.944 =207.5944.

So, putting it all together:

(-19.06 x) +236.7981 =207.5944.

Subtract 207.5944 from both sides:

-19.06 x +236.7981 -207.5944 =0.

236.7981 -207.5944 =29.2037.

So, -19.06 x +29.2037=0.

Move -19.06 x to the other side:

29.2037 =19.06 x.

So, x=29.2037 /19.06.

Compute that.

19.06 ×1.53 → 19 ×1.53=29.07, 0.06×1.53=0.0918. So 29.07+0.0918=29.1618. That's a bit higher than 29.2037.

Wait, 19.06 ×1.53 = ?

Let me compute 19.06 ×1.53:

19.06 *1 =19.06

19.06 *0.5=9.53

19.06 *0.03=0.5718.

So sum:19.06 +9.53=28.59 +0.5718=29.1618.

But we have 29.2037.

So 29.2037 -29.1618 =0.0419.

So additional x beyond 1.53 is 0.0419 /19.06 ≈ 0.0022.

So x ≈1.5322 grams.

So approximately 1.532 g of KOH, which is about 1.53 grams.

Wait, but let me do a precise division.

29.2037 divided by 19.06.

Let me compute 29.2037 ÷19.06.

19.06 ×1.5 =28.59.

29.2037-28.59=0.6137.

Bring down decimal: 0.6137 → 6.137 after multiplying by 10.

19.06 ×0.032= approx 0.60992.

So 0.032 *19.06= approx 0.60992.

So total x=1.5 +0.032=1.532.

So x=1.532 grams of KOH.

Then y=4.221 -1.532=2.689 grams.

So approximately 1.53 g KOH and 2.69 g Ca(OH)₂.

Wait, looking at the options, let me check which one is closest.

Option C: 1.52 g KOH and 2,701 g Ca(OH)₂. Wait, that can't be right as 2,701 is too big. So perhaps a typo, perhaps 2.701 g.

But in that case, 1.52 +2.701=4.221, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option F is 1.4 and 2.7, which is close. But our calculation is about 1.53 and 2.69.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the options match.

Looking at option C: 1.52 g KOH and 2.701 g Ca(OH)₂. Wait, 2.701 is 2.701 grams, so total is 1.52 +2.701=4.221. So that matches.

So, the correct option would be C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 1.7 g-KOH and 2.521 g Ca(OH)_2 --> 1.7+2.521=4.221. So that adds up correctly. Let me compute the equivalents for option A.

KOH:1.7 g /56.1 g/mol = approx 0.0303 moles, which is 0.0303 equivalents.

Ca(OH)₂:2.521 g /74.08 g/mol = approx 0.03402 moles. Since each mole gives 2 equivalents, 0.03402 *2=0.06804 equivalents.

Total equivalents:0.0303 +0.06804=0.09834, which is less than 0.100. So option A gives about 0.0983 equivalents, which is less than 0.100. So not correct.

Option C: 1.52 g KOH gives 1.52 /56.1 ≈0.02709 equivalents.

Ca(OH)₂:2.701 g /74.08 = approx 0.03647 moles → 0.07294 equivalents.

Total:0.02709 +0.07294=0.10003, which is very close to 0.100. So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1.52 g and 2,701 g? That would be 1.52+2701=2702.52 g, which is way over. So perhaps the option is mistyped, and it's 2.701 grams.

Assuming that, option C is correct.

So the answer is option C.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the mixture of KOH and Ca(OH)₂ being neutralized by an acid. The total equivalents of hydroxide ions in the mixture are given as 0.100 equivalents, and the total mass of the mixture is 4.221 g. The goal is to determine the masses of KOH and Ca(OH)₂ in the mixture.

### Key Steps:
1. **Equivalent Weight Calculation**:
   - For KOH: Each mole provides 1 equivalent of OH⁻. Its molar mass is 56.1 g/mol, so its equivalent weight is also 56.1 g/equivalent.
   - For Ca(OH)₂: Each mole provides 2 equivalents of OH⁻. Its molar mass is 74.08 g/mol, so its equivalent weight is \( \frac{74.08}{2} = 37.04 \, \text{g/equivalent} \).

2. **Setup Equations**:
   - Let \( x \) be the mass of KOH in grams, and \( y \) be the mass of Ca(OH)₂ in grams.
   - The total mass equation is:  
     \[
     x + y = 4.221
     \]
   - The total equivalents equation is:  
     \[
     \frac{x}{56.1} + \frac{y}{37.04} = 0.100
     \]

3. **Substitution and Solving**:
   - Substitute \( y = 4.221 - x \) into the equivalents equation:  
     \[
     \frac{x}{56.1} + \frac{4.221 - x}{37.04} = 0.100
     \]
   - Multiply through by \( 56.1 \times 37.04 \) to clear the denominators:  
     \[
     37.04x + 56.1(4.221 - x) = 0.100 \times 2075.944
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):  
     \[
     x \approx 1.532 \, \text{g}
     \]
   - Substitute \( x \) back to find \( y \):  
     \[
     y = 4.221 - 1.532 = 2.689 \, \text{g}
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated values are approximately \( 1.53 \, \text{g} \) of KOH and \( 2.69 \, \text{g} \) of Ca(OH)₂.
   - Option C lists \( 1.52 \, \text{g} \) of KOH and \( 2.701 \, \text{g} \) of Ca(OH)₂, which is very close to the calculated values. The total mass \( 1.52 + 2.701 = 4.221 \, \text{g} \) matches perfectly.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C: 1.52 g-KOH and 2.701 g Ca(OH)₂**. 

Answer: C
