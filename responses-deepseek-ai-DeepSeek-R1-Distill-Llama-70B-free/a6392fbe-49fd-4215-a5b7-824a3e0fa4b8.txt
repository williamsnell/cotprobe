Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about child development. The question is about the adaptive response of a six-month-old child who shows distress when an attachment figure leaves. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Okay, let's start by recalling what I know about attachment and child development. I remember that infants go through different stages of attachment. Around six months old, they start showing signs of separation anxiety. Wait, but is that the same as what's being asked here?

Let me think about each option. Option A is reactive attachment disorder. I think that's when a child doesn't form attachments at all, maybe because of neglect. But this child does show distress, so maybe it's not that.

Option B is separation anxiety. That rings a bell. I remember that separation anxiety is a normal phase where children get upset when their primary caregivers leave. It usually starts around 6-9 months. So a six-month-old showing distress when the attachment figure leaves sounds exactly like separation anxiety.

Option C is stranger anxiety. That's similar but different. Stranger anxiety is when the child is afraid of strangers, not when the caregiver leaves. So that's probably not the right answer here.

Option D, avoidant attachment, is one of the insecure attachment styles. Children with avoidant attachment might not show much distress when the caregiver leaves, so this doesn't fit.

Option E, secure attachment, is when the child is distressed when the caregiver leaves but easily comforted upon return. But the question is about the adaptive response, which is the behavior itself, not the type of attachment.

Option F, ambivalent attachment, is another insecure type where the child is distressed when the caregiver leaves and is hard to comfort. Again, this is more about the attachment style, not the specific response of showing distress upon separation.

Options G, H, I, J: G is attachment anxiety, which I think is more about fear of abandonment in relationships, not specific to this scenario. H is object permanence, which is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when out of sight. That's a different concept. I is dependent attachment, which I'm not too sure about, but I think it's another term for insecure or maybe a different style. J is disorganized attachment, which is a type where the child has no clear strategy for dealing with separation, often seen in cases of abuse or neglect.

So putting it all together, the correct term for the distress when the attachment figure leaves is separation anxiety, which is option B. It's a normal part of development, an adaptive response because it helps the child stay close to the caregiver, promoting safety.

The question asks about the adaptive response of a six-month-old child who shows distress when an attachment figure leaves. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

- **A: Reactive attachment disorder** refers to a lack of attachment due to neglect, which doesn't fit as the child shows distress.
- **B: Separation anxiety** is a normal phase where children become upset when their caregiver leaves, typically starting around 6-9 months. This matches the scenario.
- **C: Stranger anxiety** involves fear of strangers, not distress from the caregiver leaving.
- **D: Avoidant attachment** describes a child who doesn't show distress when the caregiver leaves, which contradicts the scenario.
- **E: Secure attachment** involves distress upon separation but easy comfort upon return. However, the question focuses on the distress itself, not the attachment style.
- **F: Ambivalent attachment** also involves distress but includes difficulty in comforting, which is more about attachment style than the specific response.
- **G: Attachment anxiety** refers to fear of abandonment, not the specific response to separation.
- **H: Object permanence** is about understanding objects continue to exist out of sight, unrelated to this scenario.
- **I: Dependent attachment** is unclear but likely refers to an insecure style, not the specific response.
- **J: Disorganized attachment** involves no clear strategy for dealing with separation, often due to trauma, which doesn't fit the normal response described.

The correct answer is **B: separation anxiety**, as it is the normal and adaptive response to a caregiver's departure at this age.

Answer: B
