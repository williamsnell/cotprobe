Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

Options:

A: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.
B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.
C: grant the motion, because the city attorney is using the same witness.
D: grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.
E: deny the motion, because the city's anti-smoking ordinance is separate from the state statute.
F: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
G: deny the motion, because the city has its own jurisdiction.
H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.
I: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Okay, so I've got this law question about double jeopardy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the situation is that a state enacted a statute making smoking in restaurants, bars, etc., a misdemeanor. The defendant was tried in state court for violating this. During the prosecution's case, a witness testified about a prior conviction that had been excluded in a pretrial hearing. The judge granted a mistrial and excused the jury. Then, the state prosecutor appealed and won, but decided not to re-prosecute. Now, the city attorney wants to prosecute the same incident under an identical city ordinance. The defendant is moving to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.

So the question is whether the court should grant or deny the motion. The options are from A to I.

I remember that double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But I also recall the dual sovereignty doctrine, which says that state and federal governments (and maybe cities) can each prosecute for the same act because they're separate sovereigns.

Wait, but cities are municipalities, not separate sovereigns in the same way states are. So maybe the city and the state are considered the same sovereign for double jeopardy purposes. Or is the city a separate entity?

In the case where both the state and a city are prosecuting, if the city is considered part of the state government, then prosecuting in both would be the same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies. But if the city has its own separate authority, maybe not.

Wait, the dual sovereignty doctrine applies when two separate sovereigns prosecute. So, for example, a state and the federal government can each prosecute someone for the same act because they're different sovereigns. But cities are typically considered subdivisions of the state, not separate sovereigns. So if the state prosecutes, and then the city prosecutes, it's the same sovereign, so double jeopardy would apply.

But wait, in this case, the first prosecution was by the state, and the second is by the city. Are they the same sovereign? If so, then the city's prosecution is barred by double jeopardy because it's the same sovereign prosecuting again.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think about the case law. I remember that in Heath v. Alabama, the Supreme Court held that when a state prosecutes someone and then another state does, each is a separate sovereign and can prosecute. But cities aren't states. So, for a city and a state, they're part of the same sovereign. So double jeopardy would prevent the city from prosecuting if the state already did.

Wait, but in this case, the state didn't actually get a conviction. The first trial ended in a mistrial. So when does jeopardy attach? Jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn in a jury trial, or when the first witness is sworn in a bench trial. So in the first trial, jeopardy had attached because the prosecution presented a witness. Then, the judge granted a mistrial. Now, whether the defendant can be retried depends on whether the mistrial was with prejudice or not.

But here, the state decided not to re-prosecute after winning the appeal. So the first trial ended in mistrial, and the state isn't going further. Now the city is trying to prosecute.

So, the question is whether the city's prosecution is barred by double jeopardy because it's the same sovereign as the state.

If the city is a separate sovereign from the state, then it can prosecute. But if it's part of the same sovereign, then it can't.

Wait, I think the general rule is that municipalities are not separate sovereigns from the state. So the state and the city would be considered the same sovereign for double jeopardy purposes. Therefore, prosecuting the same offense by the city after the state's prosecution would be barred.

But wait, the city's ordinance is identical to the state statute. So the offenses are the same. So if the state had prosecuted and acquitted, the city couldn't prosecute. But here, the state's case ended in a mistrial. So the state could potentially retry, but they chose not to.

So, can the city then pick up and prosecute? If the city is part of the same sovereign, then once the state's case is dismissed, the city can't prosecute because it's the same sovereign.

Alternatively, if the city is a separate sovereign, then it can. But I think cities aren't separate sovereigns. So the answer would be that the city can't prosecute, so the court should grant the motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.

Wait, but let me think again. There's also the concept of whether the same prosecuting authority is involved. The state prosecutor and the city attorney are different offices, but if they are part of the same sovereign, then it's the same.

In the case of double jeopardy, the key is whether the two entities are the same sovereign. So, for example, a state cannot prosecute someone after the federal government has, because they are separate sovereigns. But if the same sovereign prosecutes twice, it's not allowed unless an exception applies.

In this case, the city is a municipality within the state. So the state and the city are the same sovereign. Therefore, prosecuting the defendant again by the city would constitute double jeopardy.

Wait, but the initial prosecution was by the state, and the city is a different prosecuting entity. So if the state and the city are the same sovereign, then the city cannot prosecute again because the state already did, even though the state's case ended in a mistrial and they decided not to retry.

So, the defendant's motion to dismiss should be granted because it's the same sovereign prosecuting again, violating double jeopardy.

Looking at the options:

Option B: grant because same incident.

Option D: same law and evidence.

Option F: grant because jeopardy attached.

Option I: deny because separate sovereigns.

Wait, option I says to deny because city and state are separate sovereigns. If that's correct, then the city can prosecute. But I thought cities are not separate sovereigns. So, if the correct answer is that the city and state are the same sovereign, then option I is wrong, and the motion should be granted.

Wait, but let me think about the case law again. In the case of Powers v. State, or maybe other cases, I think that municipalities are considered part of the same sovereign as the state, so they can't prosecute separately. So, if the state prosecutes and then the city prosecutes, it's the same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies.

So, in this case, the city's prosecution is by the same sovereign as the state's. Therefore, double jeopardy applies, and the motion should be granted.

Looking at the options, option I says to deny because city and state are separate sovereigns. So if that's incorrect, then the correct answer would be to grant the motion, which would be options B, D, F, or H.

Option F says grant because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. That makes sense because once jeopardy attaches, the state can't prosecute again, and since the city is part of the state, the city can't either.

Wait, but in the first trial, the state's case ended in a mistrial. So, can the state retry the defendant? It depends on why the mistrial was granted. Here, the mistrial was because the prosecution presented inadmissible evidence. So the defendant might be able to argue that the mistrial was without his consent, and thus he can't be retried. But in this case, the state decided not to retry, so the case was dismissed. So, if the state had decided to retry, would that be allowed?

But that's not the issue here. The issue is whether the city can prosecute after the state's case was dismissed. So, if the state and city are the same sovereign, then yes, the city's prosecution would be barred.

So looking at the options, option I says to deny because they are separate sovereigns. If that's wrong, then the correct answer would be to grant the motion, which would mean the court should grant it because it's the same sovereign, so option I is not correct.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that explicitly says that the city and state are the same sovereign. Let me check:

Option E says to deny because the city's ordinance is separate. That's about the law, not the sovereign.

Option F says to grant because jeopardy attached. That's correct because once jeopardy attached in the first trial, the same sovereign can't prosecute again. So if the city is part of the same sovereign, then the motion should be granted.

So the correct answer would be option F: grant the motion because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.

But another thought: the first prosecution ended in a mistrial, but the state decided not to retry. So, in terms of double jeopardy, when a mistrial is granted without the defendant's consent, and the prosecutor wants to retry, the defendant can argue that it's double jeopardy. But in this case, the state isn't retrying, so the case was dismissed. Now, the city is trying to take over the prosecution. So, the issue is whether the city is a separate sovereign.

If the city is a separate sovereign, then they can prosecute. If not, they can't.

So, back to whether the city is a separate sovereign. I think the general rule is that a municipality is not a separate sovereign from the state. So, the state and the city are the same sovereign, so the city's prosecution would be barred by double jeopardy.

Therefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss, so the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but let's think about when the same sovereign is prosecuting. If the same sovereign is prosecuting, then double jeopardy applies. So, the city, being part of the state, cannot prosecute again.

Alternatively, if the city and the state are separate sovereigns, then they can each prosecute. But I think they are not separate.

So, looking at the options, option I says to deny because they're separate sovereigns. If that's wrong, then the correct answer would be to grant the motion, which would point to option F.

Alternatively, option B says to grant because it's the same incident. But I think the same incident is not the determining factor; it's the same sovereign.

So, the key here is the same sovereign. So, if the city is the same sovereign as the state, then double jeopardy applies, and the motion should be granted. So, looking at the options, option F says grant because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. That makes sense.

Alternatively, option I says to deny because they're separate sovereigns. If that's not the case, then option I is incorrect, and the answer would be to grant the motion.

So, I think the correct answer is F: grant the motion because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.

The question revolves around whether the city's prosecution of the defendant for violating an anti-smoking ordinance would violate the defendant's rights against double jeopardy, given that the state had previously prosecuted the defendant for the same incident under an identical statute. Double jeopardy prevents a defendant from being tried twice for the same offense by the same sovereign after jeopardy has attached.

Key points to consider:

1. **Jeopardy Attachment**: Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury is sworn in and in a bench trial when the first witness is sworn. In this case, jeopardy attached during the state's prosecution because the prosecution presented a witness.

2. **Mistrial and Double Jeopardy**: The state's trial ended in a mistrial due to the prosecution's error (introducing excluded evidence). Generally, a mistrial does not bar retrial unless the mistrial was caused by prosecutorial misconduct intended to provoke a mistrial. Here, the state decided not to retry the defendant after winning its appeal.

3. **Same Sovereign Analysis**: The critical issue is whether the city and the state are considered the same sovereign for double jeopardy purposes. Municipalities, such as the city in this case, are typically considered subdivisions of the state rather than separate sovereigns. Therefore, prosecutions by the state and a city are generally considered to be by the same sovereign.

4. **Application of Double Jeopardy**: Since the city and the state are part of the same sovereign, the city's prosecution of the defendant for the same incident would violate double jeopardy. The fact that the city's ordinance is identical to the state statute further supports this conclusion, as the offenses are the same.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. A mistrial does not automatically allow a second prosecution by the same sovereign.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While the same incident is being prosecuted, the determining factor is whether the same sovereign is involved.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The use of the same witness is irrelevant to the double jeopardy analysis.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The identity of the law and evidence is not the decisive factor; it is the identity of the sovereign.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The ordinances being separate does not make the city and state separate sovereigns.
   - **Option F**: Correct. Jeopardy attached in the first prosecution, and the city, as part of the same sovereign, cannot prosecute again.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The city is not a separate jurisdiction in this context.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The state's decision not to retry does not affect the double jeopardy analysis.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The city and state are not separate sovereigns for double jeopardy purposes.

The correct answer is **F**, as jeopardy attached in the first prosecution, and the city, being part of the same sovereign as the state, cannot prosecute the defendant again for the same offense.

Answer: F
