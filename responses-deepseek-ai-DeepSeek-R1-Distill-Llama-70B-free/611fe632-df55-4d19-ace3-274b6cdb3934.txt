Question:

A defendant was at a bar when she saw her exboyfriend who had recently dumped her. The defendant walked away and spotted a good friend of hers. She approached her friend and told him she would give him $50 to beat up her ex-boyfriend. The friend agreed but said he would wait until the ex-boyfriend left the bar. While the defendant was eavesdropping on her ex-boyfriend in the hopes he would say something nice about her, she overheard him having a conversation on his cellphone. During the course of that conversation, the defendant realized that her ex-boyfriend was now a federal agent. Afraid she might be prosecuted for a federal offense, the defendant told her friend not to bother with the planned attack. If the defendant is subsequently charged with the statutory offense of conspiring to commit an assault on a federal officer, the defendant will probably be

Options:

A: acquitted, because she did not physically commit the assault.
B: convicted, because she attempted to incite violence, regardless of her ex-boyfriend's occupation.
C: convicted, because her actions demonstrated a clear intent to cause harm.
D: acquitted, because she did not know her ex-boyfriend was a federal agent at the time of conspiracy.
E: convicted, because her knowledge that her exboyfriend was a federal agent is not a material element of the crime.
F: convicted, because she initially conspired to commit an assault.
G: acquitted, because her friend did not carry out the assault.
H: convicted, because withdrawal is never recognized as an affirmative defense to conspiracy.
I: acquitted, because she was unaware that her ex-boyfriend was now a federal agent.

Okay, so I've got this question about criminal law, specifically conspiracy. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a defendant who wants to get her ex-boyfriend beaten up. She approaches a friend and offers him $50 to do it. The friend agrees but waits until the ex-boyfriend leaves the bar. Then, while eavesdropping, she finds out her ex is now a federal agent. Scared of federal charges, she tells her friend to call off the attack. Now, she's charged with conspiring to commit an assault on a federal officer.

The question is whether she'll be acquitted or convicted. The options are from A to I, each giving different reasons.

First, I need to recall the elements of conspiracy. Conspiracy generally requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to achieve that goal. It doesn’t require the crime to actually be carried out—just the agreement and intent.

In this case, the defendant and her friend agreed to commit an assault. So, they had the agreement. Now, the target was her ex-boyfriend, who's a federal agent, but at the time of the agreement, she didn't know that. She only found out later and then called it off.

Wait, but does it matter whether she knew he was a federal agent at the time of the conspiracy? Because the charge is conspiring to commit assault on a federal officer. So, the identity of the victim as a federal agent might be a specific element of the crime.

I think for conspiracy, the specific intent is important. If the law requires that the conspirators knew or had intent regarding a specific fact (like the victim's status as a federal agent), then maybe her lack of knowledge at the time would matter.

But wait, in some cases, like when the victim's status makes the crime more severe, the knowledge might be a required element. So, if the statute requires that the conspirators knew the person was a federal officer, then without that knowledge, she might not be guilty.

Looking at the options, option D says she's acquitted because she didn't know he was a federal agent at the time. Option I says the same, but I think D is more precise because it's about the time of conspiracy. 

Alternatively, option E says she's convicted because her knowledge isn't a material element. That would be the case if the law doesn't require her to know the victim's status as a federal agent. For example, if the conspiracy is to commit assault, and the fact that the victim is a federal officer is just a sentencing enhancement, then her knowledge wouldn't matter. But I think in this case, conspiring to assault a federal officer is a specific crime that requires the intent to target a federal officer.

So, if she didn't know her ex was a federal agent when she made the agreement, she couldn't have the specific intent to assault a federal officer. Therefore, she wouldn't meet the elements of the conspiracy charge as it pertains to a federal officer.

Another point is that she withdrew from the conspiracy before the crime was committed. But conspiracy is about the agreement itself, not the execution. So withdrawal might not matter unless it's before any overt act, but in this case, the agreement was already made. So withdrawal doesn't help with the conspiracy charge, but that's not relevant if the initial agreement lacked the required intent.

So, considering all this, the key is whether she knew her ex was a federal agent when she conspired. Since she didn't, she can't be convicted under that specific statute. So the answer should be D.

The defendant agreed to pay her friend to assault her ex-boyfriend, but she did not know her ex-boyfriend was a federal agent at the time of the agreement. Conspiracy requires an intent to commit the specific crime charged. If the crime of conspiring to assault a federal officer requires knowledge of the victim's federal status, the defendant lacked this knowledge at the time of the agreement. Therefore, she cannot be convicted under this statute. 

Answer: D
