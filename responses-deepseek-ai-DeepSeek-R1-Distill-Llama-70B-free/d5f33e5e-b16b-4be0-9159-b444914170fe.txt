Okay, so I need to figure out this question about grand jury proceedings. Let me start by recalling what I know about grand juries. I remember that grand juries are part of the process in the criminal justice system, specifically involved in deciding whether to indict someone, which means bringing formal charges against them.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true about grand jury proceedings. The options are from A to I. Let me go through each one and think about whether each is true or false.

Option A: The proceedings are conducted in secret. I think this is true. From what I've heard, grand jury proceedings are usually not public. They're closed to the public to protect the identities of witnesses and to prevent interference with the investigation.

Option B: The proceedings are conducted by a judge. Hmm, wait. I think that's not right. I remember that in a grand jury, the prosecutor presents the case. The judge isn't typically present during the proceedings. Instead, the prosecutor leads the questioning and presents evidence. So this might be the incorrect statement, but I need to check all options to be sure.

Option C: The defendant has a right to present evidence. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the defendant can present evidence, but maybe it's not an absolute right. Or perhaps in some jurisdictions, the defendant can do this, but it's not a guaranteed right. Alternatively, maybe the grand jury is more about the prosecution presenting their case, and the defendant's rights are limited here. I might need to think more on this.

Option D: There is a right to Miranda warnings. Miranda warnings are given when someone is in custody and being questioned. In a grand jury, if a person is subpoenaed to testify, Miranda doesn't necessarily apply unless they're in custody. But wait, the defendant isn't necessarily testifying. Or, if they do testify, they can plead the fifth. So I'm not sure if Miranda applies here. Maybe D is not a correct statement, meaning the statement is false, so the question would be which is not true. Wait, the question is asking what is NOT true, so if D says there's a right to Miranda warnings, is that true or false? I think Miranda doesn't apply in grand jury proceedings unless the witness is in custody, so generally, there is no right to Miranda warnings in grand jury proceedings, making D's statement false. So D would be a correct answer if the question is asking which is not true.

Option E: The proceedings are open to the public. No, I think they're closed, so E is false. So the statement in E is not true.

Option F: There is no right to have evidence excluded. Hmm. In a grand jury, the rules of evidence are more relaxed. Hearsay is admissible, for example. So if evidence is presented, the defendant can't really object and have it excluded. So F's statement is true, meaning it's not the correct answer to the question.

Option G: The jury's decision must be unanimous. I think grand juries don't require unanimity. They usually need a majority, but the exact number can vary. So G's statement is false, making it a possible correct answer.

Option H: There is no right to counsel. I believe in grand jury proceedings, the defendant doesn't have the right to an attorney present during the proceedings. So H's statement is true, meaning it's not the correct answer.

Option I: The jury is made up of 12 people. Wait, I think a grand jury typically has more people than a petit jury (which is 12). Maybe like 16 or 23, depending on the jurisdiction. So I is false because the grand jury is larger than 12. So I would be a correct answer to the question.

Now, let's recap. The question is which option is NOT true about grand jury proceedings.

Looking at each option:

A: True. Proceedings are secret.

B: False. Not conducted by a judge; conducted by prosecutor.

C: Not sure. Maybe true in some cases, but I think the defendant can present evidence through their attorney, but perhaps it's limited. Or maybe they don't have a right, so C would be false, making it a correct answer.

D: False. No Miranda right in grand jury unless in custody.

E: False. Proceedings are not open.

F: True. No right to exclude evidence.

G: False. Decision doesn't need to be unanimous.

H: True. No right to counsel during proceedings.

I: False. Jury is more than 12.

So the question is, which is NOT true. So the incorrect statements are B, C, D, E, G, I.

Wait, but I need to select which option is not true.

Wait, let me think again.

The question is: Which is NOT true about grand jury proceedings.

So each option is a statement, and the correct answer is the statement that is false about grand jury proceedings.

So, for example, if an option says something that is not the case, that would be the correct answer.

So:

Option B: Proceedings are conducted by a judge. Is that true? No, grand juries are led by prosecutors, not judges. So B is false, meaning it's the correct answer because the question is asking what's NOT true.

Option E: Open to the public. No, so E is false; it's the correct answer.

Option G: Decision must be unanimous. I think grand jury indictments require a majority, not unanimous. So G is false.

Option I: Jury made of 12. Petit juries are 12, grand juries are larger, like 16-23. So I is false.

So the possible correct answers (the statements that are not true) are B, E, G, I.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with options A-J, and only one correct answer.

Looking back at the options, the question is which is NOT true.

So let's go through each.

Option B: Conducted by a judge. No, so it's a false statement, so it's a correct answer to the question.

Option E: Open to public. No, so E is false.

Option G: Must be unanimous. No, so G is false.

Option I: Made up of 12. No, so I is false.

So all of B, E, G, I are false statements about grand juries.

Wait, but the correct answer can't be all of them. So perhaps I need to re-examine which of these is correct.

Wait, what's the actual composition of a grand jury? I think federal grand juries have 23 people, and state can vary, but typically more than 12. So I is false.

Now, let me think about each option:

The question is, which is not true.

So the correct answer is the one that's not true.

So looking at the options:

A is true.

B is false.

C: The defendant has a right to present evidence. Wait, in grand jury, the defendant can present evidence, but it's limited. Or perhaps, no, the defendant doesn't have a right. I'm a bit confused. Wait, in a grand jury proceeding, the prosecution presents evidence, and the defendant doesn't have the same rights as in a trial. So perhaps C is false, making it a correct answer. Or maybe the defendant can present evidence through their attorney, but it's not a right. So I'm not entirely sure about C.

Option D: Right to Miranda warnings. I think Miranda applies when in custody and being interrogated. In grand jury, if subpoenaed, you have to testify, but you can plead the fifth. So Miranda warnings wouldn't apply unless you're in custody. So in general, no Miranda right, so D's statement is false, making D a correct answer.

Option E is false as well.

Hmm, but I need to find which of these is not true.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which is not true, so the correct answer is the one that's false.

Wait, the question is: "What is not true about grand jury proceedings?" So the correct answer is the statement that is false about grand juries.

So, each option that is false is a possible correct answer.

But the options are mutually exclusive, so only one is correct.

Let me think again.

Looking for the statement that is false about grand juries.

Option B: Proceedings conducted by a judge. No, conducted by prosecutor, so B is false.

Option E: Open to public. No, so E is false.

Option G: Decision must be unanimous. No, so G is false.

Option I: Jury made of 12. No, so I is false.

So which of these is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is giving only one correct answer, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding some options.

Wait, let me consider each option in detail.

Option B: The proceedings are conducted by a judge. I think that's incorrect. Grand juries are run by the prosecutor, not a judge. So B is false, so it's a correct answer.

Option E: The proceedings are open to the public. That's false because grand juries are secret. So E is a correct answer.

Option G: The jury's decision must be unanimous. I think grand juries require a majority vote, not unanimous. So G is false, correct answer.

Option I: The jury is made up of 12 people. No, grand juries are larger, like 23 in federal cases. So I is false.

So now, which of these is the correct answer? The question is which is not true, and the options B, E, G, I are all not true.

But wait, the question asks which is NOT true, so all these options are possible, but the actual answer must be one of them.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are from A to I, and the answer is one letter.

Wait, perhaps I should look for more specific knowledge.

Let me think about each of the options again.

Option B: Conducted by a judge. No, because the grand jury is led by the prosecutor, so B is false.

Option C: The defendant has a right to present evidence. I think in some cases, the defendant can present evidence, but it's not a right. Or perhaps, the defendant's attorney can question witnesses, but it's not a guaranteed right. Maybe C is false, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Right to Miranda warnings. No, Miranda doesn't apply unless in custody. So D is false.

Option E: Open to public. No, so E is false.

Option F: No right to have evidence excluded. That's true because hearsay is allowed, so F is true.

Option G: Must be unanimous. No, so G is false.

Option H: No right to counsel. That's true because in grand jury proceedings, the defendant doesn't have the right to an attorney during the proceeding, so H is true.

Option I: Jury made of 12. No, I is false.

So, the possible correct answers (the options that are false) are B, C, D, E, G, I.

But the question is multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is E, because the proceedings are not open to the public.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because the grand jury isn't conducted by a judge.

Wait, but the question is about what is not true. So if an option is false, then it's a correct answer.

So let me see the options again.

The question is which is NOT true.

So:

A: True (secret).

B: False (judge doesn't conduct).

C: Not sure, but perhaps true.

D: False (Miranda not applicable).

E: False (proceedings not open).

F: True (no exclusion of evidence).

G: False (unanimous not required).

H: True (no counsel right).

I: False (jury larger than 12).

So, the answer is one of B, D, E, G, I.

But the options given are A through I, and the answer must be one letter.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which of these is definitely not true.

Option E: Proceedings are open to the public. I know that's not true, so E is definitely a correct answer.

Option B: Conducted by a judge. No, so B is a correct answer.

Option I: 12 people. No, so I is correct.

So which one is the correct answer to the question.

Wait, the question is asking which is not true, so all of these are not true, but the options include multiple false statements. So perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because that's a common misconception.

Wait, another approach: What is true about grand jury proceedings.

Proceedings are secret (A is true). So E is false.

Proceedings are conducted by a judge? No, so B is false.

Defendant has a right to present evidence? I think they can, but it's limited. Maybe C is true.

Miranda warnings? No, so D is false.

No right to exclude evidence? F is true.

Jury decision must be unanimous? G is false.

No right to counsel? H is true.

Jury made of 12? I is false.

So the statements that are NOT true are B, D, E, G, I.

But the question gives only one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is E, because it's the most obviously false. Or perhaps B.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, because the grand jury is not conducted by a judge.

But I'm a bit stuck. I think the best approach is to try to think which of these is the most incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: The proceedings are open to the public. No, that's false.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the answer could be B.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most commonly known fact. Grand juries are secret, so E is false.

Proceedings are conducted by a judge: No, so B is false.

The defendant has a right to present evidence: I think that's not necessarily true. Maybe the defendant can present evidence, but it's not a right, so C is false.

Hmm.

But the question asks which is NOT true, so all these are possible, but the options are single-answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: The proceedings are conducted by a judge.

Because grand juries are run by the prosecutor, not a judge. So B is false, making it the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, in the options given, E is "The proceedings are open to the public." Since grand juries are secret, E is false, so E is correct.

But the question is multiple-choice, and only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the grand jury is composed of more than 12, so I is false.

So the correct answers could be B, E, G, I.

But the question is asking for one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: The question asks which is NOT true.

Looking at each option:

A: True.

B: False.

C: Maybe true, as defendant can present evidence through counsel, but unsure.

D: False.

E: False.

F: True.

G: False.

H: True.

I: False.

So the correct answer could be any of B, D, E, G, I.

But since the options only allow one correct answer, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is B, as it's a common misconception.

Wait, another thought: The grand jury is led by a prosecutor, not a judge. So B is false, making it the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: The proceedings are conducted by a judge.

Because in a trial, the judge conducts the proceedings, but in a grand jury, the prosecutor does. So B is false.

So the answer is B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, another way: The question asks what is NOT true.

So, which of these is a false statement about grand juries.

E says the proceedings are open to the public, which is false. So E is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is E.

But I'm torn between B and E. Both are false.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, because it's more directly about the nature of the proceeding.

In any case, I think the correct answer is E: The proceedings are open to the public. Because that's definitely false.
</think>

To determine which statement is NOT true about grand jury proceedings, let's analyze each option:

- **A**: The proceedings are conducted in secret.  
  This is true. Grand jury proceedings are typically closed to the public to protect witness identities and prevent interference.

- **B**: The proceedings are conducted by a judge.  
  This is false. Grand jury proceedings are led by a prosecutor, not a judge. The prosecutor presents evidence and questions witnesses.

- **C**: The defendant has a right to present evidence.  
  This is debatable. While the defendant may have limited opportunities to present evidence, it is not an absolute right. However, this is not the most clearly false statement.

- **D**: There is a right to Miranda warnings.  
  This is false. Miranda warnings apply when someone is in custody and being interrogated. In grand jury proceedings, Miranda warnings are not required unless the witness is in custody.

- **E**: The proceedings are open to the public.  
  This is false. Grand jury proceedings are generally closed to the public, making this a strong candidate for the correct answer.

- **F**: There is no right to have evidence excluded.  
  This is true. The rules of evidence are more relaxed in grand jury proceedings, and evidence can be admitted even if it would be inadmissible at trial.

- **G**: The jury's decision must be unanimous.  
  This is false. Grand jury decisions typically require only a majority vote, not unanimity.

- **H**: There is no right to counsel.  
  This is true. Defendants generally do not have the right to an attorney during grand jury proceedings.

- **I**: The jury is made up of 12 people.  
  This is false. Grand juries are larger than petit juries, often consisting of 16–23 people, depending on the jurisdiction.

From this analysis, the statements that are NOT true are **B**, **D**, **E**, **G**, and **I**. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, **E** stands out as the most clearly false statement because grand jury proceedings are inherently closed to the public.

**Answer: E**
