Okay, so I've got this problem here about arithmetic and geometric progressions. Hmm, I remember that an arithmetic progression has a common difference between terms, while a geometric progression has a common ratio. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says there's a sequence of three real numbers forming an arithmetic progression, and the first term is 9. So the first term is 9, the second term is 9 plus some common difference d, and the third term would be 9 plus 2d. So the arithmetic sequence is 9, 9+d, 9+2d.

Then, the problem states that if we add 2 to the second term and add 20 to the third term, the resulting three numbers form a geometric progression. So the new sequence becomes:

First term: 9 (unchanged)
Second term: (9 + d) + 2 = 11 + d
Third term: (9 + 2d) + 20 = 29 + 2d

So now, the three terms 9, 11+d, 29+2d should form a geometric progression. In a geometric progression, the square of the second term is equal to the product of the first and third terms. So the condition is:

(11 + d)^2 = 9 * (29 + 2d)

I need to solve this equation for d. Let's expand the left side:

(11 + d)^2 = 121 + 22d + d^2

The right side is 9*(29 + 2d) = 261 + 18d

So putting it all together:

121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d

Let's move everything to the left side:

d^2 + 22d + 121 - 261 - 18d = 0

Simplify the terms:

d^2 + (22d - 18d) + (121 - 261) = 0
d^2 +4d -140 =0

So the quadratic equation is d² +4d -140 =0.

I can solve this using the quadratic formula: d = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=4, c=-140.

Discriminant D = 4² -4(1)(-140) = 16 +560 = 576

Square root of 576 is 24.

So d = [-4 ±24]/2.

Calculating the two possibilities:

d = (-4 +24)/2 = 20/2 =10

d = (-4 -24)/2 =-28/2 =-14

So d can be 10 or -14.

Now, let's find the third term of the geometric progression for each case, since the question asks for the smallest possible value of this term.

First, when d=10:

The third term of the geometric progression is 29 + 2d = 29 +20=49.

When d=-14:

Third term is 29 +2*(-14) =29-28=1.

So the possible third terms are 49 and 1. The smallest possible value is 1.

Looking at the options, option I is 1. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we start by defining the arithmetic progression (AP) with the first term \(9\). Let the common difference be \(d\). Thus, the terms of the AP are:

\[
9, \, 9+d, \, 9+2d
\]

When 2 is added to the second term and 20 is added to the third term, the sequence becomes:

\[
9, \, 11+d, \, 29+2d
\]

This new sequence is a geometric progression (GP). In a GP, the square of the second term equals the product of the first and third terms. Therefore, we have:

\[
(11+d)^2 = 9 \cdot (29+2d)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d
\]

\[
d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(d = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a=1\), \(b=4\), and \(c=-140\):

\[
d = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 24}{2}
\]

This gives two solutions:

\[
d = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad d = -14
\]

For \(d = 10\), the third term of the GP is:

\[
29 + 2(10) = 49
\]

For \(d = -14\), the third term of the GP is:

\[
29 + 2(-14) = 1
\]

The smallest possible value for the third term of the GP is \(1\).

The correct answer is:

**I: 1**
