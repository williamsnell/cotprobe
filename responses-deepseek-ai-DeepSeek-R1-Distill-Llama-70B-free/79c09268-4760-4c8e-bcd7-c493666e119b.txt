Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with possession of heroin. At the defendant's preliminary hearing, the prosecution presented evidence that the defendant was arrested while riding in a car. The heroin was found in a briefcase containing no identification, but several papers found inside contained references to the defendant. The defendant's attorney argued that the briefcase did not belong to the defendant, and the defendant had no idea how the heroin got inside the briefcase. The court ruled that there was insufficient probable cause to support a prosecution of the defendant on the heroin possession charge. The defendant was released from custody and charges were dropped. Several weeks later, a grand jury was convened to determine if the defendant should be re-indicted for heroin possession based on the same alleged incident reviewed at the preliminary hearing. The defendant was called to testif' as a witness at the grand jury hearing. He appeared and was sworn in as a witness. The defendant proceeded to challenge the proceeding on the basis that any grand jury indictment for heroin possession would constitute a violation of the double jeopardy clause. The defendant's double jeopardy challenge should be

Options:

A: denied, because there is no basis for a double jeopardy challenge.
B: granted, because the heroin possession charge was formally dismissed at the preliminary hearing.
C: denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction.
D: granted, because the defendant has the right to avoid self-incrimination.
E: denied, because the grand jury proceeding is not considered a trial.
F: granted, because by voluntarily appearing at the grand jury hearing, the defendant has standing to challenge the indictment.
G: granted, because the defendant has already been tried for the same charge.
H: denied, because double jeopardy only applies if the initial charge resulted in a conviction or acquittal.
I: granted, because the defendant was previously held in custody for the same charge.

Okay, so I have this question about double jeopardy and criminal procedure. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant who was arrested and charged with possession of heroin. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecution presented evidence that the defendant was in a car when arrested, and the heroin was found in a briefcase. The briefcase didn't have the defendant's ID, but some papers inside had references to him. The defense argued that the briefcase wasn't his. The court ruled there was no probable cause, so the charges were dropped, and the defendant was released.

Now, weeks later, a grand jury is convened to consider re-indicting him on the same charge. The defendant is called as a witness and challenges the proceedings under the double jeopardy clause. The question is whether this challenge should be granted or denied.

First, I need to remember what the double jeopardy clause protects against. It's in the Fifth Amendment and prevents someone from being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But when does jeopardy attach?

In a typical trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn in or, in a bench trial, when the first witness is sworn. But this question is about a grand jury proceeding. Wait, grand juries don't determine guilt; they decide whether there's enough evidence to indict. So does jeopardy attach at the grand jury stage?

I think the key here is that the grand jury is part of the charging process, not the trial itself. So if the initial charge was dismissed, can the same charge be brought again without violating double jeopardy?

In the initial case, the charges were dropped at the preliminary hearing. So the defendant wasn't acquitted; the prosecution just didn't have enough evidence at that stage. Now, the grand jury is considering whether to indict based on the same incident.

I remember that double jeopardy doesn't apply to preliminary hearings or grand jury proceedings because those aren't trials. So the defendant can't claim double jeopardy now because the grand jury is just deciding whether to indict again. The dismissal at the preliminary hearing doesn't count as an acquittal.

Wait, but what about if the initial case was dismissed after some proceedings? If a court had determined there was no probable cause, does that prevent a grand jury from re-indicting? Hmm, but the preliminary hearing is separate from the grand jury. In some states, the preliminary hearing might serve a similar function to a grand jury in determining probable cause, but federal courts use grand juries.

So, in this case, the first time, the court (maybe a magistrate) dismissed the charge for lack of probable cause. Then, the grand jury is convened again. Since the grand jury is part of the charging process, and the initial dismissal wasn't an acquittal, the defendant can be reindicted.

Therefore, the defendant's double jeopardy challenge should be denied because the grand jury proceeding isn't a trial, and jeopardy hasn't attached yet. The options probably relate to this reasoning.

Looking at the answer options:

A: Denied, no basis for challenge. Maybe because no trial yet.

B: Granted, because charge was dismissed at prelim. But dismissal isn't an acquittal.

C: Denied, because double jeopardy requires acquittal or conviction. That sounds right because without a trial, there's no attachment.

D: Granted, self-incrimination. No, the challenge is about double jeopardy, not the 5th amendment right.

E: Denied, grand jury isn't a trial. Yes, that's correct.

F: Granted, because defendant appeared. No, appearing doesn't give standing for double jeopardy.

G: Granted, already tried. No, he wasn't tried; charges were dismissed.

H: Denied, because initial charge didn't result in acquittal or conviction. So this is similar to C.

I: Granted, because custody. No, custody isn't the trigger for double jeopardy.

So the possible correct options are C, E, H. Let me think again.

Jeopardy attaches at trial, not at the preliminary hearing or grand jury. So the defendant's initial appearance was at a prelim hearing, which doesn't count. So even if the charge was dismissed, no double jeopardy because the trial never started.

So the correct answer would be that the double jeopardy challenge should be denied because double jeopardy doesn't apply until after the trial has started.

Looking back, option C says: denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there's been an acquittal or conviction. That seems correct.

Option E says: denied, because grand jury isn't a trial. Also correct.

Wait, but the defendant is challenging the grand jury proceeding as violating double jeopardy. The question is whether the grand jury can indict him again after the initial dismissal. So the challenge is about whether the grand jury can proceed, not whether he can be tried again after a trial.

But since the grand jury is part of the charging process, not the trial, double jeopardy doesn't prevent it. So the challenge should be denied.

So option E is about the grand jury not being a trial, which is why there's no double jeopardy.

Wait, but the defendant's challenge is that any grand jury indictment would be double jeopardy. So the defendant is arguing that because he was previously charged and released, he can't be indicted again.

But since the initial charge was dismissed at the preliminary hearing, which is before trial, there's no double jeopardy. So the grand jury can indict him again.

So the answer would be either C or E.

But let's think about when double jeopardy applies. It's when the same sovereign (state or federal) brings the same charge after an acquittal or conviction. If the case was dismissed before trial, double jeopardy doesn't bar a retrial. But in this case, the defendant is being reindicted before any trial occurred.

Wait, but the initial process was a preliminary hearing, which isn't a trial. So the dismissal there doesn't trigger double jeopardy. So the grand jury can indict again.

So the correct reasoning is that double jeopardy hasn't attached because there hasn't been a trial. Therefore, the challenge should be denied.

So looking at the options, option C and E both seem correct. Option C says rights don't attach unless there's acquittal or conviction. Option E says grand jury isn't a trial.

Wait, but the defendant is appearing before the grand jury as a witness. Does that affect anything? Not for double jeopardy. Because the grand jury is an investigatory body, not a trial.

So the correct answer is either C or E.

Wait, in the US, the double jeopardy clause doesn't apply to preliminary hearings or grand juries. So the defendant's challenge is based on the idea that the prior proceeding bars the new indictment, but since the prior proceeding was a preliminary hearing (not a trial), double jeopardy doesn't apply.

So the challenge should be denied because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction, which hasn't happened here. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, option E says the grand jury proceeding isn't a trial, so no jeopardy. But the challenge is about the grand jury proceeding leading to an indictment, which would then go to trial. So the real issue is whether the prior dismissal at preliminary hearing counts, but it doesn't because it's not a trial.

So the defendant's challenge should be denied because double jeopardy hasn't attached yet. So the options boil down to C and E.

But I think the correct answer is E because the grand jury isn't a trial, so the challenge is denied. Alternatively, C because no acquittal or conviction.

Wait, let's look up. In the US, double jeopardy attaches when the trial commences. So any dismissal before trial doesn't bar retrial. So the defendant can be tried again after a dismissal at a preliminary hearing.

Therefore, the grand jury can indict him again, and the challenge should be denied because the grand jury is part of the charging process, not a trial.

So the correct answer is E: denied, because the grand jury proceeding is not considered a trial.

Wait, but the defendant is a witness at the grand jury. Does that matter? No, because being a witness doesn't mean jeopardy is attached.

So I think option C and E are both plausible, but the better answer is C: denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction.

Wait, no. Because the defendant hasn't been acquitted or convicted, so the dismissal doesn't bar retrial. So the challenge should be denied.

So the correct answer is option C.

The double jeopardy clause protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. Jeopardy typically attaches at trial, when the jury is sworn in or, in a bench trial, when the first witness is sworn. In this case, the defendant's charges were dismissed at a preliminary hearing, which is not a trial. Preliminary hearings and grand jury proceedings are part of the charging process, not the trial itself, and therefore, double jeopardy does not apply.

The defendant's challenge is based on the argument that a grand jury indictment for the same charge would violate double jeopardy. However, since the initial dismissal occurred at a preliminary hearing and not after a trial, double jeopardy rights have not yet attached. The grand jury proceeding is an investigatory step to determine whether to indict, and it does not constitute a trial. As a result, the defendant's double jeopardy challenge should be denied because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction.

The correct answer is:

C: denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction.

Answer: C
