Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a nonconducting spherical shell with charge spread nonuniformly through its volume. Hmm, I need to find the net charge in the shell. Alright, let's break this down.

The shell has an inner radius of 4.0 cm and an outer radius of 6.0 cm. Oh wait, I should probably convert those to meters because the units given are in meters. So 4 cm is 0.04 m and 6 cm is 0.06 m. Got it.

The charge density rho is given as b divided by r, where b is 3.0 microcoulombs per square meter. Wait, wait. Oh wait, no, the units for rho is coulombs per cubic meter, right? Because charge density is charge per volume. And the given rho is b/r, with b being 3.0 μC/m². Hmm, that's a little confusing because rho has units of C/m³, so let me check:

If rho = b / r, then the units would be (μC/m²) / m, which is μC/(m³). But wait, 1 μC is 1e-6 C, so μC/(m³) is 1e-6 C/m³. So that makes sense because rho is in C/m³. So that's okay.

Now, to find the net charge, I need to integrate the charge density over the entire volume of the shell. Since it's a spherical shell, I should use spherical coordinates and probably a volume element in spherical form. The volume element dV in spherical coordinates is r² sinθ dθ dφ dr. But because of symmetry, the charge distribution only depends on r, not θ or φ. So the integration over angles should just give me a factor of 4π or something like that.

Wait, let's think: the shell is between r = 0.04 m and r = 0.06 m. So for each spherical shell at radius r, the volume is the surface area 4πr² times the thickness dr. So the differential volume element for a thin shell at radius r would be dV = 4π r² dr.

Yes, that's right. So the total charge Q is the integral from r = a to r = b of rho(r) * dV. Substituting rho(r) = b / r, and dV = 4π r² dr.

Putting it all together, Q = integral from 0.04 to 0.06 of (b/r) * 4π r² dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let's plug in the values. First, take the constants out of the integral. So Q = 4π b ∫ (r² / r) dr from 0.04 to 0.06. Simplifying r²/r gives r. So the integral becomes ∫ r dr from 0.04 to 0.06.

The integral of r dr is (1/2) r² evaluated from 0.04 to 0.06. So let's compute that:

At 0.06: (1/2)*(0.06)^2 = (1/2)*0.0036 = 0.0018
At 0.04: (1/2)*(0.04)^2 = (1/2)*0.0016 = 0.0008

Subtracting the two: 0.0018 - 0.0008 = 0.001.

So the integral is 0.001. Now multiply by 4π b. Let's plug in the numbers:

b is 3.0 μC/m², which is 3e-6 C/m². So,

Q = 4π * 3e-6 C/m² * 0.001 m.

Wait, let me compute step by step. 4π times 3e-6 is 12e-6 π. Multiply by 0.001: 12e-6 * 0.001 = 12e-9. So 12e-9 π C.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 4π * 3e-6 = 12e-6 π. Then, 12e-6 π * 0.001 = 12e-9 π.

Wait, no. Wait, 3e-6 * 4π is 12e-6 π. Then multiply by 0.001 (the integral result), so 12e-6 π * 1e-3 = 12e-9 π.

So 12e-9 is 1.2e-8. Multiply by π (approx 3.1416), so 1.2e-8 * 3.1416 ≈ 3.77e-8 C.

Hmm, looking at the answer options, let's see:

Options are:

A: 1.5e-8

B:6e-8

C:4.6e-8

D:4e-8

E:2.9e-8

F:3.8e-8

G:2.5e-8

H:7.2e-8

I:3e-8

J:5.2e-8.

Wait, my calculation gives approximately 3.77e-8, which is close to 3.8e-8, which is option F.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes factors can be tricky.

Let me recompute:

Q = integral from 0.04 to 0.06 of (b/r) * 4π r² dr.

Simplify inside: (b/r) * 4π r² = 4π b r.

So the integral is 4π b ∫ r dr from 0.04 to 0.06.

Integral of r dr is [ (1/2) r² ] from 0.04 to 0.06.

Compute that:

(0.06)^2 = 0.0036 → (1/2) * 0.0036 = 0.0018.

(0.04)^2 = 0.0016 → (1/2)*0.0016=0.0008.

Subtract: 0.0018 - 0.0008 = 0.001.

So the integral is 0.001. Multiply by 4π b:

b is 3e-6 C/m². So 4π * 3e-6 * 0.001.

Wait, 4 * 3 is 12. π is about 3.1416. So 12 * 3.1416 ≈ 37.699.

So 37.699e-6 * 0.001 → 37.699e-9 → which is 3.7699e-8 C.

So approximately 3.77e-8 C, which is about 3.8e-8, which is option F.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any factors.

Wait, the volume charge density is given as rho = b/r, where b is 3.0 μC/m². Wait, so what's the unit of rho? It would be (μC/m²) divided by m, so μC/m³. Which is correct because rho is in C/m³. So that's okay.

Yes, so the calculation seems correct. So the charge is approximately 3.8e-8 C, so option F.

To determine the net charge in the nonconducting spherical shell, we start by noting the given parameters:

- Inner radius: \( a = 4.0 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.04 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- Outer radius: \( b = 6.0 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.06 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- Charge density: \( \rho(r) = \frac{b}{r} \), where \( b = 3.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C/m^2} = 3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \)

The net charge \( Q \) is obtained by integrating the charge density \( \rho(r) \) over the volume of the shell. For a spherical shell, the volume element in spherical coordinates is \( dV = 4\pi r^2 dr \). Thus, the total charge is:

\[
Q = \int_{a}^{b} \rho(r) \, dV = \int_{0.04}^{0.06} \frac{b}{r} \cdot 4\pi r^2 \, dr
\]

Simplifying \( \rho(r) \cdot dV \):

\[
Q = 4\pi b \int_{0.04}^{0.06} r \, dr
\]

The integral of \( r \, dr \) is:

\[
\int r \, dr = \frac{1}{2} r^2
\]

Evaluating this from \( r = 0.04 \, \mathrm{m} \) to \( r = 0.06 \, \mathrm{m} \):

\[
\int_{0.04}^{0.06} r \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \left( (0.06)^2 - (0.04)^2 \right)
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left( 0.0036 - 0.0016 \right) = \frac{1}{2} (0.002) = 0.001
\]

Now substitute back into the expression for \( Q \):

\[
Q = 4\pi b \cdot 0.001
\]

Substitute \( b = 3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \):

\[
Q = 4\pi (3.0 \times 10^{-6}) (0.001) = 12\pi \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[
Q \approx 12 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 10^{-9} = 37.699 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} = 3.77 \times 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

This is approximately \( 3.8 \times 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{C} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
