Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the change in head loss in a pipe when the temperature of the water changes. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see, the question gives me a pipe that's 12 km long, so that's 12,000 meters. The flow rate is 0.2 m³/s. The diameter is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters. The relative roughness is 0.004. The water's temperature changes from 65°C to 30°C, and I need to find the change in head loss.

Wait, head loss in pipes is usually calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, right? The formula is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2gD), where f is the Darcy friction factor. But wait, another version of this uses the flow velocity and other parameters. Oh right, sometimes it's expressed with the Reynolds number, especially when considering the viscosity which changes with temperature.

So I remember that the friction factor f depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Since the relative roughness is given as 0.004, which is a fairly smooth pipe, but the Reynolds number is probably high because the flow rate is significant. So likely, it's in the turbulent region, and the friction factor can be found using the Colebrook-White equation or maybe the Moody diagram. But wait, the relative roughness (ε/D) is 0.004, which is the same as saying the pipe's roughness ε is 0.004 times the diameter. So for a 0.3 m diameter, ε is 0.0012 meters.

But let me think. Since the temperature changes, the viscosity of the water changes. Viscosity decreases as temperature increases, right? So when the water is cooler (30°C), it's more viscous than when it's warmer (65°C). So the Reynolds number will be lower at 30°C because Reynolds number Re = (V D) / ν, and ν increases as temperature decreases. So a lower Re means the flow might be in a different regime. But wait, at high Re, the friction factor is mainly dependent on the relative roughness. So maybe for both temperatures, we can assume the same f? Or does the change in viscosity affect f?

I think I need to calculate the friction factor at both temperatures because the viscosity (and thus Re) changes, which affects f. So the plan is: calculate the head loss at 65°C, then at 30°C, and find the difference.

First, find the flow velocity. The flow rate Q is 0.2 m³/s. The cross-sectional area A is π*(D/2)^2. So A = π*(0.3/2)^2 = π*(0.15)^2 ≈ 0.0706858 m². Then velocity V = Q/A = 0.2 / 0.0706858 ≈ 2.828 m/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.3/2 is 0.15, squared is 0.0225. Multiply by π gives about 0.0706858 m². 0.2 divided by 0.0706858 is approximately 2.828 m/s. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, find the Reynolds number at both temperatures. For that, I need the kinematic viscosity ν at 65°C and 30°C.

I remember that ν for water at different temperatures can be found from tables or approximated with formulas. From my notes, the kinematic viscosity of water at 65°C is about 0.000475 m²/s, and at 30°C it's around 0.000801 m²/s. Wait, wait, no, I think I mixed them. Let me think again. Higher temperature means lower viscosity, so lower ν. So at higher temp (65°C), ν is lower than at lower temp (30°C). Let me get the exact numbers.

Looking it up in my mind: At 20°C, ν is about 1.004e-6 m²/s. At 30°C, ν is about 0.801e-6 m²/s. At 60°C, it's about 0.474e-6. Wait, maybe I should double-check these values.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, kinematic viscosity ν is in m²/s, and for water, at 20°C it's about 1.004e-6 m²/s. At higher temps, it decreases. So at 30°C, ν is about 0.801e-6? No, that would be higher than at 20, which can't be right. Wait wait, no, my mistake. Wait, no, the correct trend: as temperature increases, ν decreases. So at 20°C, ν is about 1.0e-6 m²/s, at 30°C, it's about 0.801e-6, and at 60°C, around 0.474e-6. Hmm, perhaps I need to find more precise values.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up exact values for ν at 65°C and 30°C. Let me think. Oh, right, I can refer to standard tables. So, for water:

At 30°C, ν ≈ 0.801 × 10^-6 m²/s.

At 65°C, ν ≈ 0.474 × 10^-6 m²/s.

Wait, no, wait—wait, wait, let me get this right. Wait, when temperature increases, viscosity decreases, so ν decreases. So at higher temperature, ν is lower.

So for 30°C: ν = 0.801e-6 m²/s.

At 65°C: ν = 0.474e-6 m²/s.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. At 20°C, it's around 1.0e-6. So at 30, slightly less. Yes, that's correct.

So now, compute Re for each temperature.

Re = (V * D) / ν.

At 65°C:

V is 2.828 m/s.

D is 0.3 m.

ν is 0.474e-6 m²/s.

So Re_65 = (2.828 * 0.3) / (0.474e-6) = (0.8484) / 0.474e-6 ≈ 0.8484 / 0.000000474 ≈ let's compute this.

0.8484 / 0.000000474 = approximately 1,790,000.

Wait, 0.8484 / 0.474e-6 = (0.8484 / 0.474) * 1e6 ≈ (1.790) * 1e6 ≈ 1.79e6.

So Re_65 ≈ 1.79 million.

At 30°C:

ν is 0.801e-6.

Re_30 = (2.828 * 0.3) / (0.801e-6) = 0.8484 / 0.801e-6 ≈ 0.8484 / 0.000000801 ≈ 1,059,000.

Wait, 0.8484 / 0.801 = approx 1.059. So 1.059e6.

So Re_30 ≈ 1.059e6.

Now, I need to find the friction factor f for each Re.

The Colebrook-White equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (ε/(3.7 D) + (1/2.825) Re √f ) )

Wait, no, the Colebrook equation is:

1/√f = 2 log ( (ε/D)/(3.7) ) + (1/ Re √f )

Wait, maybe I should look for an iterative approach or perhaps use the Moody diagram.

Alternatively, using the approximation for turbulent flow in the completely rough zone, where f depends only on ε/D. But that's when Re is high enough that the flow is fully rough.

Wait, the relative roughness is ε/D = 0.004. So in the Moody diagram, for ε/D=0.004, it's in the transitionally rough region for Re of about 1e5 to 1e6. So perhaps the friction factor can be found using the Colebrook-White equation.

The Colebrook equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (ε/D)/(3.7) + (1/(2.825 Re √f)) )

This is implicit in f, so we need to solve it iteratively for each Re.

Alternatively, we can use the approximation formula for f when the flow is turbulent.

Another approach is to use the formula:

f = (1/4) [ log( (ε/D)/(3.7) + (1.95 / Re ) ) ]^2 * 2

But I might be confusing some formulas here. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the explicit approximation for f given by the Swamee-Jain equation:

f = (1/4) [ log( (ε/D)/3.7 + (5.74/Re^(0.9)) ) ]²

Wait, that's the Swamee-Jain formula, which is an explicit approximation for the Colebrook equation.

So let's use that. It's good for Re > 5000, which both our cases are.

So for each Re, compute f using Swamee-Jain.

Let me compute f for Re_65 first.

At 65°C: Re ≈ 1.79e6.

Compute the term inside the log:

(ε/D)/3.7 + 5.74/(Re^0.9)

ε/D is 0.004.

So (0.004)/3.7 ≈ 0.001081.

Re^0.9 = (1.79e6)^0.9 ≈ Let me compute that.

Take natural log: ln(1.79e6) ≈ ln(1.79) + ln(1e6) ≈ 0.58 + 13.8155 ≈ 14.3955. Multiply by 0.9: 14.3955 * 0.9 ≈ 12.9559. Exponentiate: e^12.9559 ≈ e^12 is about 162754, e^13 is about 442413, so 12.9559 is between. Let's compute e^12.9559:

But perhaps it's easier to approximate Re^0.9.

Wait, 1.79e6 is 1,790,000.

Re^0.9 = (1.79e6)^(0.9) = e^{0.9 * ln(1.79e6)}.

Compute ln(1.79e6) = ln(1.79) + ln(1e6) = 0.58 + 13.8155 ≈ 14.3955.

0.9 * 14.3955 = 12.9559.

e^12.9559 ≈ 1.79e6^0.9 ≈ Let's see, but perhaps I can compute it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1.79e6^0.9 as follows:

Express 1.79e6 as 1.79 * 10^6.

So (1.79e6)^0.9 = (1.79)^0.9 * (10^6)^0.9 = approx 1.79^0.9 is about 1.62 (since 1.79^1 = 1.79, 1.62 is a rough estimate), and (1e6)^0.9 is 1e5.4 ≈ 2.511886e5.

So 1.62 * 2.511886e5 ≈ 4.07e5.

So 5.74 / Re^0.9 ≈ 5.74 / 4.07e5 ≈ 1.409e-5.

Now, the term inside the log is 0.001081 + 1.409e-5 ≈ 0.00110081.

Take the log (base 10) of this: log10(0.00110081) ≈ -2.958.

So,

f = (1/4) [ (-2.958) ]^2 = (1/4) * (8.764) ≈ 2.191.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is f = (1/4) [ log( term ) ]².

Wait, log is base 10, right? Because Swamee-Jain uses log base 10.

So log10(0.00110081) is log10(1.10081e-3) = approximately log10(1.1) + log10(1e-3) = 0.0414 -3 = -2.9586.

So [ log( term ) ]^2 is ( -2.9586 )^2 ≈ 8.76.

Multiply by 1/4 gives f ≈ 2.19.

Wait, that can't be right. Friction factors are usually much lower than 2. Oh wait, no, friction factors for turbulent flow in pipes are usually in the range of 0.01 to 0.1, perhaps up to 0.5 for very rough pipes. So getting 2.19 can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the Swamee-Jain equation. Oh no! I think I messed up the formula.

The Swamee-Jain equation is:

f = (1/4) * [ log( (ε/D)/(3.7) + (5.74/Re) ) ]^2

Wait, no, is it 5.74/(Re^0.9) or 5.74/Re?

Wait, looking it up in my mind: the Swamee-Jain equation is f = (1/4) [ log( (ε/D)/(3.7) + (5.74/Re^(0.9)) ) ]^2. So yes, I had that right.

Wait, but wait, calculating Re^0.9 for 1.79e6 gives us around 4e5, as before. Then 5.74 / Re^0.9 is about 1.4e-5.

So the first term is 0.004/(3.7)=0.001081, adding 0.00001409 gives 0.001094. So log10(0.001094) is about log10(1.094e-3) = log10(1.094) + (-3) ≈ 0.0387 -3 = -2.9613.

So [log( term )]^2 is ( -2.9613 )^2 ≈ 8.77.

Multiply by 1/4: 8.77 /4 ≈ 2.192, so f ≈ 0.02192? No, wait, no, 8.77 * (1/4) is 2.192. But that would make f=2.192, which is way too high. That's impossible because for typical pipes, f is less than 1, often around 0.02.

Wait, I'm definitely making a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the term inside the log is (ε/D)/(3.7) plus (5.74/Re^0.9), but maybe I messed up the units or exponents.

Wait, let me recompute the terms for Re_65.

Re_65 = 1.79e6.

Compute 5.74 / (Re_65^0.9): As before, Re^0.9 is about 4.07e5, so 5.74 / 4.07e5 ≈ 1.409e-5.

(ε/D)/3.7 = 0.004 / 3.7 ≈ 0.001081.

So the sum is 0.001081 + 0.00001409 ≈ 0.001095.

log10(0.001095) = log10(1.095e-3) = log10(1.095) + (-3) → log10(1.095) is about 0.04, so log is -2.96.

Square of that is about 8.76.

Multiply by 1/4 gives f≈2.19. But that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Re^0.9?

Wait, perhaps I should compute Re^0.9 more accurately.

Re_65 = 1,790,000.

Take the natural logarithm: ln(1.79e6) = ln(1.79) + ln(1e6) ≈ 0.5800 + 13.8155 = 14.3955.

Multiply by 0.9: 14.3955 * 0.9 = 12.95595.

Exponentiate: e^12.95595. Let me calculate e^12 is 162754.8, e^13 is 442413.4. 12.95595 is 0.95595 above 12, so between 12 and 13.

Compute e^12.95595 = e^(12 + 0.95595) = e^12 * e^0.95595.

e^0.95595 ≈ 2.607 (since e^0.6931=2, e^1=2.718, and 0.95595 is near 1, but let me be precise. Alternatively, use a calculator approximation.

Wait, e^0.95595 = ?

Let me think: ln(2.607) is about 0.955. So yes, e^0.95595 ≈ 2.607.

So e^12.95595 ≈ 162754.8 * 2.607 ≈ Let's compute 162754.8 * 2.6 is 162754.8 * 2 = 325509.6, 162754.8 * 0.6 = 97652.88, so total 423162.48. Then, 0.007 * 162754.8 ≈ 11392.8, so total around 423162 + 11,392.8 ≈ 434,555. So Re^0.9 ≈ 434,555.

So 5.74 / Re^0.9 ≈ 5.74 / 434,555 ≈ 1.322e-5.

So the sum is 0.001081 + 0.00001322 = 0.00109422.

log10(0.00109422) = log10(1.09422e-3) → log10(1.09422) is approx 0.0387, so log is 0.0387 -3 = -2.9613.

So [log( term )]^2 = ( -2.9613 )^2 ≈
