Question:

A debtor owed a creditor $750 on an old debt. On July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor "is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. " Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?

Options:

A: It was not supported by new consideration.
B: It was violative of the statute of frauds.
C: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.
D: There was no mutuality of obligation.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about contracts and the statute of limitations. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the situation is that a debtor owed a creditor $750. On July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. Then on August 1, the debtor heard the creditor badmouthing him at a party, calling him a deadbeat. Feeling guilty, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay the $750 by September 1. But then, on September 1, the debtor refused to pay. Now the creditor is suing, and we need to find the strongest ground that the oral promise is unenforceable.

The options are A through D. Let me recall the relevant legal principles here.

First, I remember that when a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, it means the creditor can't sue to collect it. But if the debtor makes a new promise to pay, that can sometimes revive the debt, making it enforceable again. However, that new promise needs to be valid.

I think about consideration. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration. Consideration is something of value bargained for in exchange for a promise. In this case, the original debt was already barred, so if the debtor promises to pay without anything new, that might be a problem.

Wait, but when a debt is past the statute of limitations, and the debtor makes a new promise, that new promise is enforceable if there's consideration. But if there's no new consideration, then the promise might not be valid. So the creditor is trying to enforce this new oral promise. The debtor is arguing it's unenforceable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It was not supported by new consideration. 

So, without new consideration, the promise might be unenforceable. Because the original consideration (the original debt) is already done. So for a new promise, there needs to be new consideration. If the debtor just says, "I'll pay you the debt," but the creditor isn't giving anything new or the debtor isn't getting anything new, then there's no consideration. So the promise might not be binding.

Option B: It was violative of the statute of frauds. 

The statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing. For example, debts can sometimes fall under this, like if it's a promise to pay the debt of another, or if the debt is above a certain amount. But I think the statute of frauds applies to promises to answer for the debt of another, not necessarily one's own debt. So if the debtor is promising to pay their own debt, maybe it doesn't fall under the statute of frauds. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations. 

Wait, but the promise could revive the debt. If the debtor makes a new promise, even if it's oral, that can take the case out of the statute of limitations. So the fact that the debt was barred might not be a defense anymore because the new promise can restart the clock. So I don't think C is the strongest ground here because the promise could have revived it.

Option D: There was no mutuality of obligation. 

Mutuality of obligation means both parties are bound to do something. In this case, the debtor is promising to pay, but what is the creditor doing? If the creditor isn't making any new promise, then perhaps there's no mutuality. But I'm not sure how strong this is as a defense. I think mutuality is important, but perhaps the lack of consideration is a more direct issue here.

So putting it together. The oral promise was made after the debt was barred. For the promise to be enforceable, it needs consideration. If there's no new consideration, the promise is not binding. So option A would be the strongest ground.

Wait, but sometimes a promise to pay a debt after the statute of limitations can be enforceable without consideration. Oh, wait, in some jurisdictions, a promise to pay a debt that's been discharged under the statute of limitations needs new consideration. So without that, it's not enforceable.

So the creditor might argue that the debtor's promise was supported by the creditor's forbearance, but if the debt was already barred, then perhaps the creditor can't forbear further. Alternatively, maybe the creditor's statement at the party about the debtor being a deadbeat might count as something, but I don't think that serves as consideration.

So the main issue is that without new consideration, the promise is not enforceable. Therefore, the strongest ground is A.

The question revolves around whether the debtor's oral promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations is enforceable. On July 1, the $750 debt was barred by the statute of limitations, meaning the creditor could no longer sue to collect it. However, on August 1, the debtor orally agreed to pay the debt by September 1 after feeling guilty upon hearing the creditor criticize him. When the debtor refused to pay, the creditor sued, and the issue is determining the strongest ground for the debtor to argue the oral promise is unenforceable.

Key legal principles apply here. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration, which is something of value bargained for in exchange for a promise. When a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, a new promise to pay can revive the debt, but only if supported by new consideration. If no new consideration exists, the promise is not binding.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "It was not supported by new consideration." This is the strongest ground because, for the debtor's oral promise to be enforceable, there must be new consideration. The original debt was already barred, so the creditor's forbearance or criticism does not constitute new consideration. Without it, the promise is unenforceable.

- **Option B**: "It was violative of the statute of frauds." The statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, but a promise to pay one's own debt typically does not fall under this requirement. Thus, this is not the strongest ground.

- **Option C**: "The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations." While the debt was initially barred, a new promise can revive it. Therefore, this is not the strongest defense.

- **Option D**: "There was no mutuality of obligation." While mutuality of obligation is important, the lack of new consideration is a more direct and stronger issue in this case.

The strongest ground is that the oral promise was not supported by new consideration, making **Option A** the correct answer.

A
