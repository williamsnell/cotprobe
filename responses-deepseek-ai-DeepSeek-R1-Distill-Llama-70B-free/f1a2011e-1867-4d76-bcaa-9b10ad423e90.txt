Alright, so I've got this question about e-commerce IT systems and planning. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. The question is asking which aspect of planning is emphasized more in an e-commerce environment that requires continuous availability compared to a traditional organization. 

Okay, let's break down the options. The key here is understanding what's crucial for e-commerce where the system can't go down. Traditional organizations might have more tolerance for downtime, but e-commerce sites need 24/7 availability because they're serving customers worldwide around the clock.

Option A: Physical security measures. That's important, but I'm not sure if it's the top priority for availability. More about preventing breaches than ensuring uptime.

Option B: Public relations strategies for IT failures. Managing PR is important when things go wrong, but the question is about planning aspects that prevent or mitigate these failures, not just handling the aftermath.

Option C: Redundant systems for instant availability. Redundancy means having backups so if one system fails, another can take over immediately. That sounds crucial for continuous availability. E-commerce sites often use load balancers and redundant servers to ensure they don't go down.

Option D: Regular audits. Audits are good for security and compliance, but maybe not directly ensuring the system stays up and running without interruptions.

Option E: Employee training. Training is important, but if the system is down, even trained employees can't do much. So maybe not the main focus here.

Option F: Off-site data backups. Backups are essential for disaster recovery, but they don't ensure immediate availability. If the system goes down, you can restore from backups, but that might take time, which isn't great for continuous operations.

Option G: Frequent IT changes. Updating systems often could introduce instability, so maybe not the best for continuous availability unless carefully managed.

Option H: Regular system updates. Updates are important to prevent disruptions from bugs or vulnerabilities, but the question is about availability planning. Updates can sometimes cause downtime if not handled properly.

Option I: Business interruption insurance. This is about financial protection if something goes wrong, not directly about keeping the system available.

Option J: Written source documents for re-entry. This is more about data recovery if data is lost, not preventing system downtime in the first place.

So, putting it all together, the most critical aspect for continuous availability would be having redundant systems. That way, if one part fails, another can immediately take its place without any noticeable downtime. This ensures transactions keep flowing smoothly, which is vital for e-commerce. So the answer should be option C.
