Okay, so I have this problem about finding the heat capacity of uranium. Hmm, I remember a bit about specific heat and molar heat capacity from my chemistry class. Let me try to piece this together.

The question says that the atomic heat (which I think is the molar heat capacity) of uranium is 26 J/mol·°C. And the molar mass is 238 g/mol. Oh wait, right, the molar heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree Celsius.

So the question is asking for the specific heat capacity, which is the heat capacity per gram. I remember the formula: specific heat (c) equals molar heat capacity (C) divided by molar mass (M). So c = C/M.

Plugging in the numbers: C is 26 J/mol·°C, and M is 238 g/mol. So 26 divided by 238. Let me do that calculation. 

Wait, 26 divided by 238. Let me compute that. 26 ÷ 238. Hmm, let's see. 238 goes into 26 zero times. So a decimal point. Maybe 238 times 0.1 is 23.8. So 0.1 would give 23.8, but I have 26. So subtract 23.8 from 26, that leaves 2.2. Bring down a zero: 22. 238 goes into 22 about 0.09 times because 238 * 0.09 is 21.42. So adding 0.1 and 0.09 gives 0.19. But wait, let me compute this more accurately.

26 ÷ 238. Let me think in terms of fractions. 26/238 can be simplified. Both are divisible by 2: 13/119. Hmm, 13 divided by 119. Maybe approximate this. 119 goes into 13 zero, so 0. something. 119 * 0.1 is 11.9. So 0.1 gives 11.9, subtract from 13 leaves 1.1. Bring down a zero: 11. 119 goes into 11 about 0.09 times (11.4 is 0.09*119=10.71; wait, 119 *0.09 is 10.71). So 11.0 -10.71 is 0.29. Next digit: 0.29 is about 0.0024 because 119*0.0024 is approximately 0.2856. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just approximate it.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as 26 ÷ 238. Let's see, 238 is approximately 240. 26 divided by 240 is roughly 0.1083. So about 0.108 J/g°C. Looking at the options, option A is 0.11, which is close. Option C is 0.13, which is a bit higher. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, 26 divided by 238. Let me calculate it step by step. 238 is about 240. 26/238 = (26 ÷ 238) = 0.109 approx. So 0.109 J/g°C. So the closest option would be A: 0.11 J/g°C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh, wait, the molar heat capacity is given as 26 J/(mol·K), because it's the same as °C. So yes, the calculation is correct. So the specific heat capacity is approximately 0.109, so 0.11 when rounded to two decimal places. So the answer should be option A.

To determine the specific heat capacity of uranium, we use the formula:

\[
c = \frac{C}{M}
\]

where \( C \) is the molar heat capacity (26 J/mol·°C) and \( M \) is the molar mass (238 g/mol). Substituting the values:

\[
c = \frac{26}{238}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
c \approx 0.109 \, \text{J/g°C}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the specific heat capacity is approximately \( 0.11 \, \text{J/g°C} \). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A: 0.11 J/g°C**
