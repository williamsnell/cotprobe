Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many ways there are to arrange 9 people in a line such that no one is standing in their correct position. Hmm, I think this is a derangement problem. Right, derangements are permutations where none of the objects appear in their original position.

Wait, I remember something about derangements using factorials and inclusion-exclusion principles. Let me think. The formula for derangements is n! multiplied by (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n /n!). So for 9 people, it would be 9! times that series.

First, I should calculate 9!. 9 factorial is 362880. Right, I remember 5! is 120, 6! is 720, 7! 5040, 8! 40320, 9! 362880. So that's correct.

Now, the series part: 1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... up to 1/9! with alternating signs. Let me compute each term step by step.

1 is just 1.

Then subtract 1/1! which is 1/1=1. So 1 -1 =0.

Add 1/2! which is 0.5. So 0 +0.5=0.5.

Subtract 1/6 (since 3! is 6), 0.5 - 0.166666... ≈ 0.333333.

Add 1/24 (4! is 24), so approximately 0.3333 + 0.0416667 = 0.375.

Subtract 1/120 (5!), which is about 0.008333. So 0.375 - 0.008333 ≈ 0.366667.

Add 1/720 (6!): 0.366667 + 0.0013889 ≈ 0.368055.

Subtract 1/5040 (7!): 0.368055 - 0.0001984 ≈ 0.3678566.

Add 1/40320 (8!): 0.3678566 + 0.0000248 ≈ 0.3678814.

Subtract 1/362880 (9!): 0.3678814 - 0.000002755 = approximately 0.3678786.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me check the series again. The formula is sum from k=0 to n of (-1)^k /k!. For n=9, the sum would be:

sum = (-1)^0/0! + (-1)^1/1! + (-1)^2/2! + ... + (-1)^9/9!

So that's 1 -1 + 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24 -1/120 +1/720 -1/5040 +1/40320 -1/362880.

Wait, so for n=9, the sum goes up to 9 terms? Or up to 9th term? Let me count the terms. Starting k=0 to k=9, that's 10 terms.

Wait, but when I calculated earlier, I went up to 1/9! with a negative sign because (-1)^9 is negative.

Wait, the initial approach I took had 9 terms, but actually, for n=9, the sum has 10 terms because it starts at 0. Let me recount:

k=0: 1/0! =1
k=1: -1/1!
k=2: +1/2!
...
k=9: (-1)^9 /9! = -1/362880

So the sum is 1 -1 + 0.5 - 0.1666667 + 0.0416667 - 0.0083333 + 0.0013889 - 0.0001984 + 0.0000248 - 0.000002755.

Let me compute this accurately step by step:

Term 0: 1 → total 1
Term 1: -1 → 0
Term 2: +0.5 → 0.5
Term3: -0.1666667 → 0.3333333
Term4: +0.0416667 → 0.375
Term5: -0.0083333 → 0.3666667
Term6: +0.0013889 → 0.3680556
Term7: -0.0001984 → 0.3678572
Term8: +0.0000248 → 0.367882
Term9: -0.000002755 → 0.367879245

So the sum is approximately 0.367879245.

Now, the derangement number D(9) = 9! * sum ≈ 362880 * 0.367879245.

Let me compute that. 362880 multiplied by 0.367879245.

Alternatively, I remember that as n gets large, the derangement approaches n! / e, where e is approximately 2.71828. So 362880 / e ≈ 362880 / 2.71828 ≈ let's compute that.

e ≈ 2.71828 → 362880 / 2.71828 ≈ ?

Let me compute:

362880 ÷ 2.71828 ≈ let me compute step by step.

2.71828 * 133000 = ?

Well, 2.71828 * 133000 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate 362880 / 2.71828.

Dividing 362880 by 2.71828:

Well, 362880 ÷ 2.71828 ≈ let's see.

But wait, 2.71828 is approximately e, and for n=9, the derangement is D(9) = 9! [1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - ... + (-1)^9 /9! ].

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value using the formula.

Wait, the exact calculation would be:

D(9) = 362880 × [1 -1 + 1/2! -1/3! + 1/4! -1/5! +1/6! -1/7! +1/8! -1/9! ]

Compute each term:

1 -1 = 0

+1/2! = 0.5 → 0.5

-1/6 ≈ 0.5 - 0.1666667 = 0.3333333

+1/24 ≈ 0.3333333 + 0.0416667 = 0.375

-1/120 ≈ 0.375 - 0.0083333 = 0.3666667

+1/720 ≈ 0.3666667 + 0.0013889 ≈ 0.3680556

-1/5040 ≈ 0.3680556 - 0.0001984 ≈ 0.3678572

+1/40320 ≈ 0.3678572 + 0.0000248 ≈ 0.367882

-1/362880 ≈ 0.367882 - 0.000002755 ≈ 0.367879245

So 0.367879245 × 362880 = ?

Let me compute 362880 × 0.367879245.

I can compute 362880 × 0.367879245.

Alternatively, perhaps use the approximation that D(n) is the nearest integer to n!/e. So D(9) would be the nearest integer to 362880 / e.

Compute 362880 ÷ 2.71828.

Let me calculate 362880 ÷ 2.71828.

I can compute this as:

2.71828 × 133496 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute 362880 ÷ 2.71828:

Well, 2.71828 × 133496 ≈ ?

Wait, maybe a better way is to perform the division step by step.

Compute 362880 ÷ 2.71828.

362880 ÷ 2.71828 ≈ let's see:

Let me compute 2.71828 × 133496.

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, approximate 362880 / 2.71828.

Well, 2.71828 × 133496 ≈ ?

Wait, 2.71828 × 133496 = ?

Let me compute 133496 × 2.71828.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 362880 ÷ 2.71828.

But maybe I can compute 362880 ÷ 2.71828 ≈ 133496.

Wait, because 362880 ÷ e ≈ 362880 / 2.71828 ≈ 133496 (approximately).

Wait, but I think the exact derangement number for n=9 is 133496.

Looking at the options, option G is 133496. So the answer should be G.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute 362880 × (sum) which is 362880 × 0.367879245.

Compute 362880 × 0.367879245.

0.367879245 is approximately equal to 1/e, which is about 0.367879441...

So 362880 × 0.367879441 ≈ 362880 × 0.367879441 ≈ ?

Well, 362880 × 0.367879441 is exactly D(9), which is the derangement number for 9 elements.

I recall that D(9) is 133496. So the correct answer is G:133496.

Looking back at the options, option G is 133496, which matches.

To determine the number of ways to arrange 9 people in a line such that no one is standing in their correct position, we are dealing with a derangement problem. The formula for derangements is:

\[
D(n) = n! \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \dots + \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \right)
\]

For \( n = 9 \), we first calculate \( 9! \), which is:

\[
9! = 362880
\]

Next, we compute the series:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{9} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} = 1 - 1 + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} - \frac{1}{5!} + \frac{1}{6!} - \frac{1}{7!} + \frac{1}{8!} - \frac{1}{9!}
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
1 - 1 = 0
\]
\[
0 + \frac{1}{2!} = 0.5
\]
\[
0.5 - \frac{1}{3!} = 0.5 - 0.1666667 = 0.3333333
\]
\[
0.3333333 + \frac{1}{4!} = 0.3333333 + 0.0416667 = 0.375
\]
\[
0.375 - \frac{1}{5!} = 0.375 - 0.0083333 = 0.3666667
\]
\[
0.3666667 + \frac{1}{6!} = 0.3666667 + 0.0013889 = 0.3680556
\]
\[
0.3680556 - \frac{1}{7!} = 0.3680556 - 0.0001984 = 0.3678572
\]
\[
0.3678572 + \frac{1}{8!} = 0.3678572 + 0.0000248 = 0.367882
\]
\[
0.367882 - \frac{1}{9!} = 0.367882 - 0.000002755 = 0.367879245
\]

Thus, the series sums to approximately \( 0.367879245 \). Multiplying this by \( 9! \):

\[
D(9) = 362880 \cdot 0.367879245 \approx 133496
\]

This matches the known derangement number for \( n = 9 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: 133496**
