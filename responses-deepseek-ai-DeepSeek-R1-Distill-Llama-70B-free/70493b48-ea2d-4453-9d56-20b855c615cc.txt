Question:

A riot broke out in a city, and many shops had been looted and some had been burned during the riots. Goods of all kinds were in piles or strewn about the sidewalk. During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should

Options:

A: affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.
B: affirm the conviction because the defendant was provided with an attorney, but reverse the reimbursement order.
C: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was not properly informed of his rights.
D: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not informed of the consequences of waiving his right to a jury trial, but affirm the reimbursement order.
E: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order.
F: affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.
G: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.
H: reverse the reimbursement order because it exceeds the maximum fine for grand larceny, but affirm the conviction.
I: affirm the reimbursement order, but not the conviction.
J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal problem. Let's go through it step by step. 

The situation is about a defendant who was involved in a riot where shops were looted and burned. He picked up a portable TV from the sidewalk and tried to walk off. A police officer arrested him. He's charged with grand larceny, which is a felony with up to seven months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

At his arraignment, the judge told him about his right to an appointed attorney. But the defendant said he wanted to represent himself and waive a jury trial. The judge questioned him and wasn't persuaded by his reasons, so he appointed an attorney anyway. The attorney later told the court the defendant wanted a non-jury trial, but the prosecution requested a jury, so the court impaneled one. The defendant was convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months and ordered to reimburse $450 for the attorney costs under a statute.

He appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The question is what the appellate court should do.

First, I need to break down the issues here. There are two main points: the right to self-representation and the reimbursement order.

Starting with the right to self-representation. The Supreme Court case Faretta v. California (1975) established that a defendant has the right to represent themselves, even if it's not in their best interest. But the right isn't absolute. The court must determine if the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Here, the judge questioned the defendant, who said he had no legal experience and didn't trust lawyers. The judge didn't find his reasons persuasive and denied the request. That seems problematic because under Faretta, the court shouldn't deny the right simply because the defendant lacks legal experience. The defendant's reason for not trusting lawyers might be enough if he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right. So the judge's denial might have been a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation.

Next, the issue of the jury trial. The defendant initially wanted to waive the jury trial, but through his attorney, he again asked for a non-jury trial. However, the prosecution wanted a jury, so the court impaneled one. The right to a jury trial is also a constitutional right, but it's a bit different. The defendant can waive it, but both the prosecution and the court might have a say. Wait, no, in many jurisdictions, a defendant can waive a jury trial with the court's approval, but the prosecution's consent might not be required. Or does the prosecution have a right to a jury trial? I think in federal cases, the prosecution doesn't have a right to demand a jury trial once the defendant waives it. But in some states, maybe? Or perhaps it's up to the court's discretion. But I'm not sure about that. This might vary, but generally, the defendant's waiver of the jury trial is what matters, provided it's knowing and voluntary.

Wait, in this case, the defendant initially wanted to waive the jury trial. The attorney later also asked for a non-jury trial, but the prosecution requested a jury. The court impaneled a jury anyway. So perhaps the defendant's waiver was ignored. If the defendant properly waived the jury trial, then the court shouldn't have forced a jury. But if the defendant didn't properly waive it, or if the court had discretion, that's another matter. Alternatively, maybe the court can overrule the defendant's waiver under certain circumstances. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this part. 

Now, moving to the reimbursement order. The defendant was ordered to pay $450 to cover the cost of his appointed attorney. This is under a statute. The issue is whether such an order is permissible. Generally, a defendant who is indigent and thus eligible for a public defender can be required to reimburse the state if they are later able to pay. But the key here is whether the statute allows for this reimbursement even when the defendant didn't actually use the attorney because he wanted to represent himself. In this case, the defendant was appointed an attorney against his will. So he didn't use the attorney's services, right? Because he was trying to represent himself. Wait, but the attorney was appointed, and presumably, the attorney did some work, even if the defendant didn't cooperate. Or maybe the attorney was just there in case. 

So the question is whether the state can make him pay for the attorney he didn't want and perhaps didn't use. There's a case called Fuller v. Oregon (1974) where the Supreme Court held that a state can require reimbursement for appointed counsel as long as it's not done in a way that violates equal protection or due process. But in Fuller, the defendant had the attorney's assistance. Here, the defendant was trying to represent himself, so maybe the attorney's role was minimal. But the court might still order reimbursement because the attorney was appointed and available, even if the defendant chose not to use their services. Alternatively, if the defendant was denied the right to self-representation, perhaps the reimbursement order is invalid because the appointment of counsel was improper. 

Wait, but in this case, the judge appointed the attorney despite the defendant's waiver. If the defendant's right to self-representation was wrongly denied, then perhaps the appointment of the attorney was improper. But the attorney was there, so maybe the state can still charge for the services because the attorney was providing some assistance, even if the defendant didn't want it. Or maybe the reimbursement is permissible regardless because the statute allows it when counsel is appointed, regardless of whether the defendant used the attorney's services.

Now, putting it all together:

1. Right to Self-Representation: The defendant was denied his Faretta right because the judge didn't accept his waiver. So the conviction should be reversed, right? Because the denial of self-representation is a structural error. So the conviction would be reversed.

2. Reimbursement Order: If the appointment of the attorney was improper because the defendant's waiver was wrongfully denied, can the state still make him pay for the attorney? I'm not sure. Alternatively, even if the appointment was improper, the state might still be able to seek reimbursement because the statute allows it when an attorney is appointed, regardless of the defendant's wishes. But if the appointment was a violation of the defendant's rights, perhaps the reimbursement order should also be reversed. Or maybe the reimbursement is a separate issueâ€”since the attorney was appointed, even if wrongly, the defendant can still be required to pay if able.

Wait, but the defendant was found indigent, so at the time, he couldn't pay. The reimbursement is to cover the cost if he's later able. So maybe the order is permissible regardless of the other issues.

Alternatively, if the appointment was improper, perhaps the state can't charge him for it. But I'm not sure. I think the right to self-representation doesn't necessarily affect the reimbursement order. The two issues are separate. So the conviction might be reversed due to the Faretta violation, and the reimbursement could be upheld if the statute allows it.

Looking back at the options:

Option E says reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order.

Option G says reverse both because he was denied the right to represent himself. But I'm not sure about the reimbursement. Alternatively, maybe the reimbursement is permissible regardless.

So if the Faretta right was violated, the conviction must be reversed. As for the reimbursement, if the statute allows it regardless of whether the defendant used the attorney, then it might stand. So perhaps the appellate court should reverse the conviction but affirm the reimbursement order.

Looking at the options, option E says reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to represent himself, and affirm the reimbursement order.

Another option is option H, which talks about the reimbursement exceeding the maximum fine, but $450 is less than $1000, so that's not an issue.

So the correct answer would involve reversing the conviction but upholding the reimbursement order if it's valid. Therefore, the answer should be E.

The case involves two main issues: the defendant's right to self-representation and the validity of the reimbursement order for the appointed attorney's costs. 

First, under **Faretta v. California (1975)**, a defendant has the right to represent themselves if the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Here, the defendant expressed a desire to represent himself, citing distrust of lawyers, but the judge denied this request, appointing an attorney instead. This denial likely violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, as the judge should not have overridden the defendant's waiver simply because of his lack of legal experience. Therefore, the conviction should be reversed due to this constitutional violation.

Second, regarding the reimbursement order, the defendant was ordered to pay $450 for the appointed attorney's costs under a relevant statute. While the defendant was indigent at the time of arraignment, the statute likely allows for reimbursement if the defendant later becomes able to pay. The fact that the defendant did not actively use the attorney's services does not necessarily invalidate the reimbursement order, as the attorney was appointed and available to assist. Thus, the reimbursement order is likely valid and should be affirmed.

Given these considerations, the appellate court should **reverse the conviction** due to the denial of the defendant's right to self-representation but **affirm the reimbursement order**.

**ANSWER: E**
