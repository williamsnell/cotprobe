Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capacitors connected in series, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is: there are five capacitors, each of 5 microfarads, connected in series. We need to find the equivalent capacitance of the system.

Hmm, I remember that capacitors in series and parallel have different formulas. In a series connection, the reciprocals add up, right? Oh wait, yeah, the formula is 1/C_equivalent = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... + 1/Cn. And for parallel, it's just the sum of the capacitances.

So since they're in series, each capacitor contributes to the total in a reciprocal way. Each is 5 µF. So for five of them, let's compute this.

The formula for series is 1/C_eq = (1/C1) + (1/C2) + (1/C3) + (1/C4) + (1/C5). Since all Cs are the same, each is 5 µF. So that's 5 times (1/5) µF^-1.

Wait, 1/5 is 0.2. Five times 0.2 is 1.0. So 1/C_eq = 1. So C_eq is 1/1, which is 1. So the equivalent capacitance is 1 µF.

Looking at the options, option H is 1 µF. So the answer should be H.

To determine the equivalent capacitance of five 5 µF capacitors connected in series, we use the formula for series capacitance:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{C_n}
\]

Since all capacitors are identical (\(C_1 = C_2 = \dots = C_5 = 5 \, \mu\text{F}\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = 1
\]

Thus, \(C_{\text{eq}} = 1 \, \mu\text{F}\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 1 µF**

Answer: H
