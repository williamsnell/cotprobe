Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the balance of payments and autonomous vs accommodating transactions. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the balance of payments (BoP) is a statement that records all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world over a specific period. It's divided into different accounts, like the current account and the capital account.

Now, the question is about autonomous and accommodating transactions. I think these terms refer to how certain transactions affect the BoP. Autonomous transactions are those that happen independently, right? Like exports and imports, investments, etc., which are based on market forces and not influenced by the balance of payments itself. These are the primary activities that drive the economy's interactions with other countries.

On the other hand, accommodating transactions are responses to the imbalances caused by autonomous transactions. So, if a country has a deficit or surplus in its autonomous transactions, the central bank or government might engage in accommodating transactions to balance it out. For example, if a country has more imports than exports (a trade deficit), the central bank might sell foreign exchange to stabilize the currency, which would be an accommodating transaction.

Looking at the options:

Option A says accommodating are planned, autonomous unexpected. I don't think that's right. Autonomous transactions are planned by economic agents, while accommodating are responses, so maybe it's the other way around. Not sure.

Option C says autonomous are independent of BoP, and accommodating occur to account for differences. That makes sense because autonomous are the main drivers, and accommodating adjust for the imbalances they create.

Option E suggests autonomous depend on BoP, which doesn't sound right. Autonomous should be independent.

Option F says autonomous are government-controlled, accommodating are market. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Autonomous include private sector activities, while accommodating might involve government actions, like central banks.

So looking back, option C seems correct. Autonomous transactions are independent, and accommodating happen to balance the inpayments and outpayments from those autonomous transactions.

The balance of payments (BoP) records all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world. Autonomous transactions are independent economic activities, such as exports, imports, and investments, driven by market forces and not influenced by the BoP itself. Accommodating transactions, on the other hand, are responses to imbalances caused by autonomous transactions. These often involve government or central bank actions to stabilize the economy, such as selling foreign exchange to address a deficit.

Among the options provided, option C correctly states that autonomous transactions are independent of the BoP, while accommodating transactions occur to account for differences between inpayments and outpayments resulting from autonomous transactions.

Answer: C
