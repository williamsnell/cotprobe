Alright, so I've got this question about homeowners insurance, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again.

Mr. Smith has two insurance policies: one with Company A for $10,000 and another with Company B for $3,000. There's a fire that causes $2,900 in damage. The question is asking how much he would collect from each company.

Hmm, okay. I remember that insurance policies usually have a deductible, but the question doesn't mention any deductibles. So I guess I can ignore that part. Also, it's possible that the policies are either primary or secondary, but the question doesn't specify anything about that either. So maybe both companies will cover part of the loss.

Wait, but how does having two insurance policies work when you have a claim? I think in some cases, like with health insurance, the primary plan pays first, and the secondary plan covers the remainder. But I'm not entirely sure about homeowners insurance. Maybe it's similar.

So Mr. Smith's total coverage is $10,000 + $3,000 = $13,000. But the damage is only $2,900. So he's only making a claim for that amount. Now, the question is, how do the two companies split this claim?

I think the key here is whether the policies are both covering the same risk. If they are, then the insurance companies would pay according to their proportion of the total coverage. This is called contribution by equal shares or something like that. So each company's payment would be proportional to their policy limits relative to the total coverage.

Let me try to calculate that. The total coverage is $13,000. Company A's share would be 10,000/13,000 of the loss, and Company B's would be 3,000/13,000.

So the loss is $2,900. So Company A would pay (10,000/13,000)*2900, and Company B would pay (3,000/13,000)*2900.

Let me compute those numbers. 10,000 divided by 13,000 is approximately 0.76923. Multiply that by 2900: 0.76923 * 2900 ≈ 2230.67. So Company A pays about $2,230.67.

Company B's part is 3,000/13,000, which is about 0.23077. Multiply by 2900: 0.23077 * 2900 ≈ 669.23. So Company B pays about $669.23.

Looking at the options, option J says Company A: $2,230.7, Company B: $669.23. That matches my calculation. So I think the correct answer is J.

But wait, I should make sure there's no other way this could be interpreted. Another possibility is that the first policy (Company A) covers up to its limit, and then the second policy covers the rest. But that would only happen if the loss exceeds the first policy's limit. Since the loss is $2,900, which is less than Company A's $10,000, Company A would cover the entire loss, and Company B wouldn't pay anything. But that would mean Company A pays $2,900 and B $0, which is option B.

Wait, now I'm confused because I remember that when multiple insurance policies cover the same loss, they usually contribute proportionally. But I'm not 100% sure if that's always the case. Or maybe in some situations, one policy is primary and the other is secondary.

If Company A is considered the primary insurer, they would pay up to their policy limit first. Since the loss is $2,900, which is within their $10k limit, they would cover the entire amount, and Company B wouldn't have to pay anything. So that would make option B correct.

But how do I know whether the policies are both primary or if one is secondary? The question doesn't specify anything about that. It just says he has two policies. So perhaps the default assumption is that both contribute proportionally, as in option J, unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but I think in the case of homeowners insurance, if you have two policies covering the same property, each policy would typically cover their proportionate share. So the total coverage is $13,000, and each pays a percentage based on their policy limits.

So in that case, using the proportionate approach, the answer would be J.

Alternatively, maybe the policies have different coverage. Like, one might cover the house and the other cover additional structures or personal property. But the question doesn't specify that, so I think the assumption is that both policies are covering the same risk, the house.

So I'm a bit torn between options B and J. But I think the correct approach is that when there are multiple insurance policies on the same property, they are both primary and share the loss proportionally. Therefore, the answer would be J.

The question involves Mr. Smith, who has two homeowners insurance policies: one with Company A for $10,000 and another with Company B for $3,000. A fire causes $2,900 in damage, and the task is to determine how much each company would pay. 

To resolve this, it is important to consider how multiple insurance policies covering the same risk typically operate. In the absence of specific details about primary or secondary coverage, the default assumption is that both policies contribute proportionally to the loss. This means each company's payment is calculated based on their policy limit relative to the total coverage ($13,000).

1. **Proportional Contribution Calculation**:
   - Company A's share: $\frac{10,000}{13,000} \times 2,900 \approx 2,230.77$
   - Company B's share: $\frac{3,000}{13,000} \times 2,900 \approx 669.23$

2. **Alternative Interpretation**:
   If Company A were considered the primary insurer, it would cover the entire loss ($2,900) since the damage is within its policy limit, and Company B would pay nothing. However, the question does not specify that one policy is primary, so this interpretation is less likely.

Given the lack of specific details about primary or secondary coverage, the most reasonable assumption is proportional contribution. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: Company A: $2,230.7, Company B: $669.23**
