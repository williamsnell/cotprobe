Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that at 1308°K, 1 mole of ruthenium changes from the beta (β) solid state to the alpha (α) solid state. The enthalpy change (ΔH) for this transition is given as -34 cal/mol. I need to calculate the entropy change, and the surrounding cooling bath is at STP. The options are from A to D, each with different values in J/(°K).

Hmm, wait. So first, I remember that when a substance undergoes a phase transition or a state change, the entropy change can be calculated using the formula ΔS = q_rev / T, where q_rev is the heat transferred in a reversible process, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

But wait, in this case, the process is the transition from β to α solid. Since both are solids, it's a solid-solid phase transition. I think this is similar to a phase change like melting or freezing, but between two solid phases. So the approach might be similar.

The given ΔH is -34 cal/mol. Oh wait, ΔH is negative, which means the process is exothermic. So when ruthenium goes from β to α, it releases heat. That makes sense because the system is losing energy, so the surroundings are gaining it.

But wait, since the problem mentions the surrounding cooling bath is at STP, I might need to consider the heat transfer between the system and the surroundings. Oh, but wait, STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C and 1 atm. But the process here is at 1308 K, which is way higher than STP's 273 K.

Wait a second, maybe I'm getting confused. The process is happening at 1308 K, which is much higher than the temperature of the surroundings. So when the system undergoes this transition at 1308 K, it's releasing heat into the surroundings, which are at a lower temperature. But how does that affect the entropy calculation?

Wait, no. The formula for entropy change when a process happens at a constant temperature is ΔS = q_rev / T. But in this case, the transition occurs at a specific temperature, 1308 K. So the T in the formula should be that temperature, not the surroundings' temperature.

Wait, but the system is changing at 1308 K, so the reversible heat transfer would be at that temperature. So the entropy change of the system is ΔS_system = ΔH_transition / T.

But wait, the question asks for the entropy change of what? It just says "calculate the entropy changes if the surrounding cooling bath is at STP." Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is considering the entropy change of the surroundings, not the system.

Wait, the system is the ruthenium undergoing the phase change. The cooling bath is the surroundings. So the heat released by the system (q_system) is negative, and the heat absorbed by the surroundings (q_surroundings) is positive.

So the system's entropy change would be ΔS_system = ΔH / T, but since the transition is exothermic (ΔH is negative), the system is losing heat, so its entropy decreases. But the surroundings are gaining that heat, so their entropy increases.

Wait, but the question isn't entirely clear on whether it's asking for the system's entropy change, the surroundings', or the total. Let me read the question again: "Calculate the entropy changes if the surrounding cooling bath is at STP." Oh, perhaps they're referring to the entropy change of the surroundings.

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the process is occurring at 1308 K, and the surroundings are at STP (273 K). So the heat transfer would involve the system at high temperature and surroundings at low temperature. But calculating the entropy change for the surroundings would require knowing how much heat they receive and at what temperature.

Wait, but in reality, when a system undergoes a process at a certain temperature, the heat is exchanged with the surroundings. For the entropy change of the surroundings, it's q_surroundings / T_surroundings. But wait, in a real process, the heat transfer occurs, but the temperature might not be constant for the surroundings if they're not a heat reservoir. But if the cooling bath is large, we can approximate the surroundings as being at a constant temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the transition occurs at 1308 K. So the system is at 1308 K, and the surroundings are at 273 K. So when the system releases heat, the surroundings absorb it, but the process isn't reversible because the temperatures are different. So perhaps we should model it as a heat transfer from the system to the surroundings, and calculate the entropy changes for both, then maybe the total.

Wait, but the question is asking for the entropy change, and the options are all positive values around 0.25 to 0.41 J/K. Let's think. The system's entropy change would be ΔS_system = ΔH / T. Since ΔH is -34 cal/mol, which is -34 * 4.184 J/mol, because 1 cal = 4.184 J approximately.

Wait, wait. Let me do the unit conversions properly. ΔH is given in cal/mol, so 1 cal is 4.184 J. So ΔH = -34 cal/mol * 4.184 J/cal = approximately -141.9 J/mol.

Wait wait, no: 34 cal is 34 * 4.184 = approx 142 J, but since it's -34 cal, it's -142 J.

So ΔS_system = ΔH_system / T. Since the system is releasing heat, the entropy change is negative.

ΔS_system = (-142 J/mol) / (1308 K) ≈ -0.1086 J/(mol·K).

But the question is about the entropy change when the surrounding is at STP. Oh wait, maybe the problem is considering the entropy change of the surroundings. So the surroundings would receive heat q = +34 cal/mol, because the system released that amount.

Wait, the system's q is negative (released), so surroundings' q is positive (absorbed). So q_surroundings = +34 cal/mol = +142 J/mol.

Then, the entropy change of the surroundings would be ΔS_surroundings = q_surroundings / T_surroundings. Since T_surroundings is at STP, which is 273 K.

So ΔS_surroundings = (142 J/mol) / (273 K) ≈ 0.520 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but that's not any of the options. The options are 0.25, 0.29, 0.34, 0.41. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entropy change of the universe, which is the system plus surroundings. So total ΔS_universe = ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings.

So ΔS_system is (-142 J/mol) / 1308 K ≈ -0.1086 J/(mol·K), and ΔS_surroundings is (142 J/mol) / 273 K ≈ 0.520 J/(mol·K). So total is (-0.1086 + 0.520) ≈ 0.4114 J/(mol·K), which is approximately 0.41 J/K.

Looking back at the options, option C is 0.41 J/K. So that would be the total entropy change of the universe. But the question says "calculate the entropy changes if the surrounding cooling bath is at STP." So perhaps the question is asking for the entropy change of the surroundings, or maybe the total.

Wait, but the options don't include 0.52. The closest is C:0.41. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: maybe the problem is considering the process as occurring at the surroundings' temperature. Or perhaps the transition is actually happening at the temperature of the surroundings, which is STP, but that doesn't make sense because the transition is given to occur at 1308 K.

Wait, perhaps I should rethink. The ΔH is the enthalpy change of the process at 1308 K. So when the system undergoes the transition, it releases q = 34 cal (since ΔH is negative, it's exothermic). So the system loses heat, which is absorbed by the surroundings. So the surroundings receive q = +34 cal = 142 J.

But the surroundings are at STP, so T = 273 K. So their entropy change is 142 J / 273 K ≈ 0.520 J/K.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the question is incorrectly framed, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the entropy change of the system only. So using ΔS = ΔH / T, where T is the temperature at which the process occurs.

So ΔH is -34 cal/mol, which is -142 J/mol. T is 1308 K.

So ΔS = (-142 J/mol) / 1308 K ≈ -0.1086 J/(mol·K). But the options are all positive. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the entropy change of the surroundings, but the process is considered reversible.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem treats the process as if the heat is transferred reversibly, so T is the temperature of the surroundings. But that would be incorrect because the process occurs at 1308 K, which is higher than the surroundings.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entropy change of the system when it's placed in contact with a reservoir at 273 K. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the entropy change of the system, considering that the heat is released to the surroundings, but using T as the temperature of the surroundings. That would be wrong because the process's temperature is 1308 K, but perhaps the problem is simplifying it.

Wait, let me try that. If I take ΔS = q_rev / T. But q_rev for the system is -34 cal, which is -142 J. If I mistakenly use the surroundings' temperature, 273 K.

Then ΔS = (-142 J) / 273 K ≈ -0.520 J/K. But none of the options match that.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "the surrounding cooling bath is at STP." So the process is occurring at 1308 K, and the surroundings are at 273 K. So the heat flows from the system (at 1308 K) to the surroundings (273 K).

So the system's entropy change is ΔS_system = ΔH_system / T_system. Since the process is at T_system =1308 K.

So ΔS_system = (-34 cal/mol) / 1308 K. Wait, but converting to J, that's -34 *4.184 J/mol /1308 K.

Wait, 34 cal is 34 *4.184 ≈ 142.3 J. So ΔS_system = (-142.3 J/mol) / 1308 K ≈ -0.1088 J/(mol·K).

But that's negative, and none of the options are negative.

Now, the surroundings receive heat q = +34 cal = +142.3 J. So their entropy change is ΔS_surroundings = q / T_surroundings = 142.3 J / 273 K ≈ 0.5208 J/(mol·K).

The total entropy change is ΔS_total = ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings ≈ (-0.1088) + 0.5208 ≈ 0.412 J/(mol·K), which is approximately 0.41 J/K, which is option C.

So that would make sense. The problem is asking for the entropy change, perhaps of the universe, under the condition that the surroundings are at STP. So the correct answer would be option C: 0.41 J/K.

To calculate the entropy change for the given transition, we analyze the process where 1 mole of ruthenium changes from the β to the α solid state at 1308 K, releasing heat to the surroundings at STP (273 K). The enthalpy change for the transition is given as ΔH = -34 cal/mol, which is exothermic. Converting ΔH to joules:  

\[
\Delta H = -34 \, \text{cal/mol} \times 4.184 \, \text{J/cal} = -142.3 \, \text{J/mol}.
\]

### Step 1: Entropy change of the system
The entropy change of the system is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = \frac{\Delta H}{T_{\text{system}}}.
\]

Here, \( T_{\text{system}} = 1308 \, \text{K} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = \frac{-142.3 \, \text{J/mol}}{1308 \, \text{K}} \approx -0.1088 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}.
\]

This negative value indicates that the system's entropy decreases as it releases heat.

### Step 2: Entropy change of the surroundings
The surroundings absorb the heat released by the system. The entropy change of the surroundings is given by:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = \frac{q_{\text{surroundings}}}{T_{\text{surroundings}}}.
\]

Here, \( q_{\text{surroundings}} = +142.3 \, \text{J/mol} \) (equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the heat released by the system), and \( T_{\text{surroundings}} = 273 \, \text{K} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = \frac{142.3 \, \text{J/mol}}{273 \, \text{K}} \approx 0.5208 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}.
\]

### Step 3: Total entropy change
The total entropy change of the universe is the sum of the entropy changes of the system and the surroundings:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surroundings}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = -0.1088 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} + 0.5208 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \approx 0.412 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}.
\]

### Final Answer
The total entropy change is approximately \( 0.41 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
