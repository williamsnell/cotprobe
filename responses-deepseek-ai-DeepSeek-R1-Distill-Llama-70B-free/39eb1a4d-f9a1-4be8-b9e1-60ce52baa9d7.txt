Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: In a skewed smooth distribution with a tail extended to the left, the statistic with the highest value is the... and then it gives options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that skewness refers to the asymmetry of the distribution. So when a distribution is skewed, it's not symmetric. If the tail is extended to the left, that means it's skewed to the left or negatively skewed. I think in such cases, the left side has the longer tail, so the higher values are on the right, but the tail is towards the left.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think again. If the tail is extended to the left, that usually means the distribution is negatively skewed. In a negative skew, the tail is on the left side, so the majority of the data points are concentrated on the right. So the mean is usually less than the median in this case, right?

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is actually less than the median. Because the long tail pulls the mean down. Wait, noâ€”does the tail being to the left mean the mean is lower or higher?

Wait, maybe I should think about the typical example. Like income distribution is usually positively skewed because a few people earn a lot, pulling the mean higher. So if the tail is on the right (positive skew), mean > median > mode. If the tail is on the left (negative skew), then the opposite happens. So mean < median.

Wait, so in a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. The mode is usually the highest point, so in that case, the order might be mode > median > mean. But I'm not entirely sure.

The question is asking which statistic has the highest value. The options include mean, median, mode, and others like variance, standard deviation, etc.

So in a left-skewed distribution, the mode is typically the highest point, but wait, no. Wait, mode is the most frequent value, but in terms of measures of central tendency, the mean, median, and mode can vary.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the positions. In a left-skewed (negative skew) distribution, the tail is to the left. So the mean is pulled to the left (lower) because the tail is on the left, right? So compared to the median, the mean is lower.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. In a positively skewed distribution (right tail), the mean is higher than the median. Because the tail is on the right, pulling the mean up. So in a left-skewed (negative) distribution, the mean is lower than the median. So the order would be mode < median < mean? No, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I should think of the direction again. When the tail is on the right (positive skew), the mean is greater than the median, which is greater than the mode. So the order is mode < median < mean. So for left-skew (tail on left), it's the opposite: mode > median > mean.

Wait, that makes sense because the tail on the left has lower values. So the mean, being sensitive to extreme values, would be lower than the median. The mode is the most frequent, so if the data is bunched on the right, the mode would be towards the right, but wait no, in a left-skewed distribution, the peak is on the right. Let me think with an example.

Imagine a distribution where most people's income is around $40k, but a few have very low incomes. So the peak is at $40k, the median is around there, but the mean is lower because those few low incomes pull it down. So the mode is the peak, which is higher than the median, which in turn is higher than the mean.

Ah, so in a left-skewed distribution, mode > median > mean.

So in the question, which asks for the statistic with the highest value, it would be the mode. But wait the options include the mode as option I. But wait, the options also include the median as option A.

Wait, but wait, the question is about which statistic has the highest value, not necessarily the measure of central tendency.

Wait, let's look at the options again. The options are:

A: median

B: interquartile range

C: geometric mean

D: quartile deviation

E: variance

F: range

G: standard deviation

H: mean

I: mode

J: harmonic mean

So in a left-skewed distribution, the mode is higher than the median and the mean. So the highest value among these would be the mode, option I.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the statistic with the highest value." So if we're comparing measures like mean, median, mode, which one is highest. But in a left-skew, the mode is the highest among them.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering other statistics beyond the central tendency. Let's think about the other options. Variance (E) and standard deviation (G) measure spread, not central tendency, so they won't be higher than the mean or median.

Similarly, the range (F) is the difference between max and min, which is a measure of spread. It's possible the range could be large, but in terms of the value of the statistic, it's not directly comparable to mean or median.

Wait, but the question is which statistic has the highest value. So for example, in a dataset, the mean could be 5, median 6, mode 7. So the mode is the highest.

So in a left-skewed distribution, the mode is higher than the median and the mean. So the answer would be I: mode.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not confusing things. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the data is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10. So mode is 10, median is (say) 7 or 5.5 or something (wait, wait, let me make a better example). 

Wait, maybe a better example would be a distribution where most data points are on the higher end, with a tail on the lower end. For instance, the ages of people in a town where most are adults, but there are some children. So the data might be something like: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ..., 50, 55, 60. The mode might be around 25, the median in the 30s, and the mean perhaps lower than the median because of the lower tail.

Wait, no, that example might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, no, if the tail is to the left (lower values), then the mean is pulled toward the lower end. So in my example, the mean would be lower than the median. So if the median is, say, 40, the mean might be 35, and the mode could be 50. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the typical order in a left-skewed distribution. From what I remember, in a left-skewed distribution (negative skew), the order is mode > median > mean. So the mode is the highest, followed by the median, then the mean.

So in that case, the statistic with the highest value would be the mode, which is option I.

Wait, but the question is about a smooth distribution with a tail extended to the left. So yes, left-skewed, so mode is higher than median, which is higher than mean.

So the answer should be I: mode.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky here. Let me think about it again. If the distribution is skewed left, the tail is on the left. So in a histogram, the peak would be towards the right, and the tail would extend towards the left. So the mode is at the peak, which is on the higher end of the data. The median is in the middle, and the mean is to the left of the median because of the tail.

So mode > median > mean. Therefore, the mode is the highest.

So among the options given, the highest value is the mode, option I.
</think>

In a skewed distribution with a tail extended to the left (negative skew), the mean is pulled toward the tail, making it lower than the median. The median, in turn, is lower than the mode, which is the most frequent value and typically located near the peak of the distribution. Therefore, in such a distribution, the order of the statistics from highest to lowest is:

\[
\text{mode} > \text{median} > \text{mean}.
\]

Among the given options, the statistic with the highest value in this scenario is the **mode**.
