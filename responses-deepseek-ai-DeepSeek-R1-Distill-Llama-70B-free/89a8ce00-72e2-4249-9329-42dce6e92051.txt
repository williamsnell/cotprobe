Okay, so I've got this question about the 2p_z electron wave function and how it changes when the angle away from the Z-axis increases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that in atomic orbitals, the p orbitals have specific shapes. The 2p_z orbital is one of them. Oh right, the p orbitals are dumbbell-shaped, right? And the 2p_z is oriented along the Z-axis. So its lobes are along the positive and negative Z directions.

The wave function for a p orbital depends on the angle θ from the Z-axis, I think. Oh wait, the angular part of the wave function for a p orbital is probably proportional to cosθ, or maybe something involving sine or cosine. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the general form of the p orbitals are given by the spherical harmonics. For a 2p_z orbital, the angular part is proportional to cosθ, right? Because the 2p_z is aligned with Z, so when θ is 0 (along Z), cosθ is 1, and when θ is 90 degrees, cosθ is 0. So the wave function should have its maximum at θ=0 and decrease as θ increases.

So if you increase the angle away from Z, θ increases. So the wave function's magnitude would decrease because cosθ decreases. But what about the electron density? Oh, wait, the electron density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So if the wave function decreases, the density would decrease as well.

Looking at the options:

Option C says both wave function and electron density decrease. That sounds right. But wait, let me read all the options again.

Option H says the electron density concentrates on the equatorial plane. Wait, the equatorial plane is where θ is 90 degrees. If the wave function is proportional to cosθ, then at θ=90, cosθ is zero. So the density would be zero there. That doesn't make sense for concentration. So H is probably wrong.

Option I says the density increases. No, because as θ increases, the wave function decreases, so density decreases. So I is wrong.

Option F says the density spreads uniformly. No, because the p orbital is not spherically symmetric. So F is out.

Option E says no change. That's not true because the wave function depends on θ.

Option B says phase inverts. Well, if the wave function is proportional to cosθ, the phase would invert when moving past the nodal plane, but the question is just increasing the angle, not crossing any nodes. So phase inversion might not happen unless you go beyond θ=90, but even then, just inverting phase wouldn't necessarily be the case unless you pass a node.

Wait, the 2p_z has a node at θ=90 degrees. So moving from θ=0 towards θ=90, the wave function decreases and the phase would stay the same until you cross the node. Hmm, maybe that's not relevant here because the question is about increasing the angle, not crossing over.

So going back, the correct effect is that as the angle increases, both the wave function and the electron density decrease. So option C should be correct.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option C: wave function and electron density decrease. That's what I was thinking. So the correct answer should be C.

The 2p_z orbital is oriented along the Z-axis, with its lobes extending in the positive and negative Z directions. The angular part of the wave function for the 2p_z orbital is proportional to \( \cos\theta \), where \( \theta \) is the angle from the Z-axis. As \( \theta \) increases (moving away from the Z-axis), \( \cos\theta \) decreases, which means the wave function's magnitude decreases. Since the electron density is the square of the wave function's magnitude, it also decreases as \( \theta \) increases.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The wave function does not increase as \( \theta \) increases; it decreases.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Phase inversion does not occur simply by increasing \( \theta \); it would only happen if crossing a nodal plane, which is not relevant here.
- **Option C**: Correct. Both the wave function and electron density decrease as \( \theta \) increases.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The wave function does not become constant; it depends on \( \theta \).
- **Option E**: Incorrect. There is a change in both the wave function and electron density as \( \theta \) increases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The electron density does not spread uniformly; the 2p_z orbital is not spherically symmetric.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The electron density does not become more spherically symmetric; the 2p_z orbital retains its dumbbell shape.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The electron density does not concentrate on the equatorial plane; it is zero at \( \theta = 90^\circ \).
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The electron density decreases, not increases, as \( \theta \) increases.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The wave function decreases everywhere as \( \theta \) increases, not just along the Z-axis.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
