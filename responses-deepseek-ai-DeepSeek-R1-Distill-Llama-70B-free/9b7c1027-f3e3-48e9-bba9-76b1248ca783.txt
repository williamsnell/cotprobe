Okay, so I've got this question here about the 'Arkansas toothpick' and what it's better known as. I'm a bit rusty on my trivia, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the name 'Arkansas toothpick' sounds like a nickname for something, probably a tool or a weapon. I remember that sometimes places have nicknames for certain items, like how a Swiss Army knife is from Switzerland, but that's not relevant here. 

The term 'toothpick' makes me think of something small and pointy, but 'Arkansas toothpick' seems more substantial. Maybe it's not a literal toothpick. I've heard of a 'Bowie knife,' which is a type of large knife. I think Jim Bowie was a famous figure in Texas, but maybe there's a connection to Arkansas as well. 

Wait, the Bowie knife is named after Jim Bowie, who was involved in the Alamo. But I've also heard that the Bowie knife was sometimes called an Arkansas toothpick. That might be because it was popularized in Arkansas or used by people from there. 

Looking at the options, option D is Bowie knife. So that's probably the correct answer. Let me quickly check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. 

Option A is Catfish, which doesn't seem related. Option B is Scottie Pippen, a basketball player, that's way off. Option C is spare rib, which is food-related, so no. E is Diamond blade, which is a type of saw blade, not a knife. F is Razorback, which is the mascot for the University of Arkansas, but that's an animal, not a tool. G is Huckleberry pie, a dessert. H is pinkie finger, a body part. I is Ozark trail, which is a region, maybe a hiking trail. J is Cherokee rose, a flower. 

So none of the other options make sense except D. I think I'm confident that the Arkansas toothpick is another name for the Bowie knife.
