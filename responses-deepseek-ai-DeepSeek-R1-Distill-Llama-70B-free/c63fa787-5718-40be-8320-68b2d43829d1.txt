Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Adam Smith and the division of labor. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how Adam Smith developed the concept of the division of labor. The options are A through J, but looking at the list, I see the options go up to I. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A says the division of labor suggests workers should rotate tasks to increase job satisfaction. Hmm, I don't remember Smith talking about job rotation for satisfaction. That sounds more like something from modern management or maybe someone else.

Option B states it's a production plan separating work into tasks to take advantage of specialization. That rings a bell. I think Smith was big on specialization. Like, in his example of the pin factory, each worker does a specific part, leading to higher productivity.

Option C claims it was first proposed by Karl Marx in Das Kapital. Wait, no, I'm pretty sure Smith wrote about this before Marx. Smith's Wealth of Nations was way earlier, like 1776, while Marx came later. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D says it's about dividing economic classes. That doesn't fit. Division of labor is more about work tasks, not social classes. Marx might have discussed class divisions, but not Smith in this context.

Option E talks about organizing government duties. That's more like the separation of powers, which I think is from Montesquieu or the US Constitution, not Smith.

Option F is about distributing workforce across industries. That sounds like something related to economic planning, maybe from Keynesian economics or development strategies, but not Smith's division of labor.

Option G refers to geographical separation across countries. That's more like international trade or comparative advantage, which I think is also from Smith but a different concept. Division of labor is within a factory or industry, not across nations.

Option H is about physically dividing a company's labor force. Not sure, but I think Smith's idea is more about task specialization, not physical separation.

Option I says it's about machines replacing humans. That sounds like automation or the Industrial Revolution, which came after Smith's time. He focused on human labor, not machines.

So putting it all together, Smith's division of labor is about breaking production into specialized tasks to increase efficiency. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B. Adam Smith's concept of the division of labor involves breaking down production into specialized tasks to enhance efficiency and productivity, as he illustrated with the example of a pin factory.

Answer: B
