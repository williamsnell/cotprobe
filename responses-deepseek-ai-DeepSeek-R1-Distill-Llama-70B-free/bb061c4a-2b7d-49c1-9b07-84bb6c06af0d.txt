Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about logical fallacies, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking about a specific type of fallacy where someone argues that what's true of the whole object is also true of each part of it. Hmm, I remember that there are several common fallacies, so I need to think through each option carefully.

Let me start by recalling some of the key fallacies. I remember that the straw man fallacy is when someone misrepresents someone else's argument to make it easier to attack. That doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about the relationship between a whole and its parts. 

Then there's the appeal to ignorance, which is when someone uses the absence of evidence as evidence. That also doesn't fit the scenario described. The bandwagon fallacy is about following the crowd just because everyone's doing it, which doesn't relate to parts and wholes.

Wait, I think the fallacy here is called the "fallacy of division." From what I remember, the fallacy of division occurs when someone assumes that what is true of a whole must also be true of its individual parts. Like, if a car is fast, thinking that each component, like the seats or the steering wheel, must be fast too. That makes sense because it's wrongly attributing the property of the whole to each part without justification.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. The false cause fallacy is when someone incorrectly identifies the cause of something. Slippery slope is about predicting a chain of negative events without evidence. Hasty generalization is making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. Ad hominem attacks the person instead of the argument. None of these seem to fit the question.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be the fallacy of division, which is option D.

The question asks about a fallacy where it's assumed that what is true of the whole is also true of each part. This is the fallacy of division. 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The scenario describes attributing a whole's property to its parts without justification.
2. Reviewed other fallacies like straw man, appeal to ignorance, bandwagon, etc., none fit.
3. Confirmed that the fallacy of division matches the description.
