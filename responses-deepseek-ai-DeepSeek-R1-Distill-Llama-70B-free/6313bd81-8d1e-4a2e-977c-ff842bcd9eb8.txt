Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, there are two urns. The first one has eight red balls and seven blue balls. The second urn has an unknown number of red balls and nine blue balls. I'm supposed to find how many red balls are in the second urn given that the probability of drawing two balls of the same color is 151/300.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. I think I'll need to calculate the probabilities of each possible outcome and set up an equation based on the given probability.

First, the setup. The first urn has R1 = 8 red and B1 =7 blue. So the total number of balls in the first urn is 8 +7 =15.

The second urn has R2 red and B2=9 blue. So total in the second urn is R2 +9. R2 is what we're trying to find.

We draw one ball from each urn. We want the probability that both are red or both are blue. So P(same color) = P(both red) + P(both blue).

Let me write that as an equation. 

P(same) = [P(red from urn1) * P(red from urn2)] + [P(blue from urn1) * P(blue from urn2)]

So, substituting the values:

P(red from urn1) = 8/15.

P(red from urn2) = R2/(R2 +9).

Similarly, P(blue from urn1) is 7/15.

P(blue from urn2) is 9/(R2 +9).

So putting it all together:

P(same) = (8/15)*(R2/(R2+9)) + (7/15)*(9/(R2+9)).

And we know that this equals 151/300.

So the equation is:

(8/15)(R2/(R2+9)) + (7/15)(9/(R2+9)) = 151/300.

Let me simplify this equation.

First, let's compute each part. Let me combine the terms. Since both have denominator 15*(R2+9), I can factor that out.

So, [8*R2 + 7*9 ] / [15*(R2 +9)] = 151/300.

Wait, 7*9 is 63, so numerator is 8R2 +63.

So the equation becomes:

(8R2 +63) / [15(R2 +9)] = 151/300.

Now, cross-multiplying to solve for R2.

Multiply both sides by 15(R2 +9) and by 300 to eliminate denominators.

Wait, maybe better to cross-multiply directly.

So:

(8R2 +63) * 300 = 151 * 15 * (R2 +9).

Let me compute both sides.

Left side: 300*(8R2 +63) = 2400 R2 + 18,900.

Right side: 151 *15 = 2265. So 2265*(R2 +9) =2265 R2 + 20,385.

So now, equation is:

2400 R2 + 18900 = 2265 R2 + 20385.

Let me bring all terms to one side. Subtract 2265 R2 from both sides:

2400R2 -2265 R2 +18900 = 20385.

Which is 135 R2 + 18900 = 20385.

Subtract 18900 from both sides:

135 R2 = 20385 -18900. Let me compute that.

20385 - 18900: 20385-18000=2385, 2385-900=1485. So 1485.

So 135 R2 =1485.

Divide both sides by 135:

R2 =1485 /135.

Let me compute that. 135 * 11 is 1485 (because 100*135=13500, no wait, 135*10=1350, 135*11=1350 +135=1485). So yes, R2=11.

Wait, that's 11. So checking the options, option G is 11. So the answer should be G.

The problem involves two urns. The first urn contains 8 red and 7 blue balls, while the second urn contains an unknown number of red balls (denoted as \( R_2 \)) and 9 blue balls. The probability of drawing two balls of the same color is given as \( \frac{151}{300} \). We need to determine \( R_2 \), the number of red balls in the second urn.

### Key Steps:
1. **Define Probabilities**:
   - Probability of drawing a red ball from the first urn: \( \frac{8}{15} \).
   - Probability of drawing a blue ball from the first urn: \( \frac{7}{15} \).
   - Probability of drawing a red ball from the second urn: \( \frac{R_2}{R_2 + 9} \).
   - Probability of drawing a blue ball from the second urn: \( \frac{9}{R_2 + 9} \).

2. **Probability of Drawing Two Balls of the Same Color**:
   The total probability of drawing two balls of the same color is the sum of the probabilities of both outcomes (both red or both blue):
   \[
   P(\text{same color}) = \left( \frac{8}{15} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_2 + 9} \right) + \left( \frac{7}{15} \cdot \frac{9}{R_2 + 9} \right).
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   Using the given probability \( \frac{151}{300} \), we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{8R_2 + 63}{15(R_2 + 9)} = \frac{151}{300}.
   \]

4. **Solve for \( R_2 \)**:
   Cross-multiply to eliminate denominators:
   \[
   (8R_2 + 63) \cdot 300 = 151 \cdot 15 \cdot (R_2 + 9).
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   2400R_2 + 18900 = 2265R_2 + 20385.
   \]
   Rearrange terms:
   \[
   135R_2 = 1485.
   \]
   Solve for \( R_2 \):
   \[
   R_2 = \frac{1485}{135} = 11.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The number of red balls in the second urn is \( 11 \).
