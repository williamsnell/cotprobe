Question:

A man was the owner of the newly constructed hotel in a city. On March 15, the man received a telephone call from a salesperson who was a distributor of hotel equipment. The salesperson offered to sell the man 1,000 fire extinguishers for his hotel. The salesperson told the man that the cost of the fire extinguishers would be $35,000 (or $35 apiece), payable 90 days after delivery. The salesperson promised to have the fire extinguishers installed no later than April 15. On March 16, the man telephoned the salesperson and accepted the offer. The following day, the man mailed the following memo to the salesperson:"Please be advised that I shall take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation. " The salesperson received the man's correspondence on March 20. On April 1, the salesperson sent a telegram to the man, stating: "It's apparent we don't have an enforceable contract in effect. I will not be delivering the fire extinguishers on April 15 or any other time. "The man brings suit against the salesperson for breach of contract. The salesperson asserts the defense of the statute of frauds under the UCC. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the salesperson's defenses?

Options:

A: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man failed to pay for the fire extinguishers within the specified 90 days.
B: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer.
C: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was not sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed.
D: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson has breached the contract by failing to deliver the fire extinguishers on the agreed date.
E: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the man's memo is considered a written contract under the UCC.
F: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo did not include a signature, which is required for a contract to be valid under the UCC.
G: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because under the UCC the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants.
H: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the man accepted the offer before the salesperson decided to terminate it.
I: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.

Okay, so here's this question about contract law, specifically under the UCC and the statute of frauds. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

So the scenario is a man who owns a new hotel. He gets a call from a salesperson on March 15 offering to sell 1,000 fire extinguishers for $35,000. The terms are payment 90 days after delivery, and installation by April 15. The man accepts the offer on March 16. Then, the next day, he sends a memo saying he'll take a 15% discount for cash payment seven days after installation. The salesperson gets this memo on March 20 and then sends a telegram on April 1 saying the contract isn't enforceable and won't deliver.

The question is about the salesperson's defense under the statute of frauds. The options are A through J, but I'm focusing on the possible ones.

First, I remember that the statute of frauds under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) requires that contracts for the sale of goods over $500 must be in writing to be enforceable. But there are exceptions. One key exception is when both parties are merchants. If they are, then a written confirmation (like a memo) between merchants can satisfy the statute of frauds if it's sufficient.

In this case, the man owns a hotel and is buying equipment, so he's likely a merchant. The salesperson is a distributor, so also a merchant. So under UCC § 2-201(2), their agreement might fall under the exception where a written memo between merchants is enough.

The man sent a memo on March 17, which the salesperson received on March 20. The memo says he'll take a 15% discount for cash payment seven days after installation. Wait, does this memo qualify as a written confirmation?

Under the UCC, when one merchant sends a written confirmation and the other doesn't object within 10 days, it can be sufficient. The memo here adds a new term about the discount. But wait, the original offer was oral, so the memo is the man's written confirmation of the agreement. The problem is whether this memo is sufficient to take the contract out of the statute of frauds.

Wait, but the salesperson's offer was oral. The man accepted orally on March 16. Then the next day, he sent a memo trying to add a discount term. So the question is whether this memo is a written confirmation that satisfies the statute of frauds.

But here's the catch: the memo might be considered an additional term. Under UCC § 2-207, when a merchant confirms an oral agreement in writing, any additional terms are treated as proposals. Unless the other party objects, these terms become part of the contract if they are not material. However, if the additional terms are material, they don't become part of the contract unless specifically accepted.

In this case, the man is adding a 15% discount for payment within seven days. That's a significant term affecting the price. So it's a material term. So under UCC § 2-207(2), this additional term would not automatically become part of the contract unless the salesperson specifically agreed to it.

But wait, the man's memo was sent on March 17, and the salesperson received it on March 20. The salesperson didn't respond until April 1, which is more than 10 days later. So under UCC § 2-207(1), when a merchant sends a written confirmation and the other doesn't object within 10 days, the additional terms are deemed accepted by both, except for terms that would materially alter the contract.

Wait, no, the rule is that between merchants, additional terms become part of the contract unless they are objected to within 10 days. But if the additional terms are material, then the original offer's terms are the ones that stand unless the offeror (here, the salesperson) specifically agrees.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again. Under UCC § 2-207, when a written confirmation is sent between merchants, any additional terms are considered a proposal, and they become part of the contract unless the recipient gives notice of objection within 10 days. However, if the additional terms would materially alter the contract, and the offer is limited to its own terms, then the additional terms may not be included unless accepted.

But in this case, the original offer by the salesperson was oral. The man accepted orally on March 16. Then the man sent a memo on March 17, which was received March 20, adding a new term about a discount. So the salesperson didn't object, and more than 10 days passed before the salesperson sent the telegram on April 1, which is 12 days after March 20.

So under UCC § 2-207, the additional term (the discount) would become part of the contract because the salesperson didn't object within 10 days. But wait, is the discount a material term? If so, maybe it's treated differently. However, I think any term that is part of the contract can be considered, and if the recipient doesn't object, it's included.

Wait, but the salesperson's offer didn't include that discount. So the man's memo is a written confirmation that includes an additional term. Since both are merchants, if the salesperson didn't object within 10 days, the term becomes part of the contract. But since the salesperson sent a telegram on April 1, which is more than 10 days after March 20, that's beyond the 10-day window. So the additional term is included, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.

Alternatively, the salesperson might argue that the memo wasn't sufficient because it was just a memo and not a signed writing. But under UCC § 2-201, the writing doesn't need to be signed if it's a written confirmation between merchants. So the memo, even unsigned, could satisfy the statute of frauds.

Wait, the memo was mailed on March 17 and received on March 20. The salesperson didn't respond until April 1. So the memo serves as a written confirmation, and the additional term is accepted because no objection was made within 10 days. Therefore, the contract is enforceable, and the statute of frauds doesn't apply as a defense.

So looking at the options, the salesperson's defense under the statute of frauds would not be valid. So which options say that? Let's look:

Option E: The defense is not valid because the memo is a written contract under UCC. That's possible.

Option G: The defense is not valid because under UCC, the statute of frauds isn't applicable between merchants. Wait, that's not correct because the statute of frauds does apply, but there's an exception when a written confirmation exists between merchants.

Option H: The defense is invalid because the man accepted before the salesperson terminated. That's about termination, not the statute of frauds.

Option I: The defense is invalid because the salesperson didn't respond in time. That touches on the written confirmation and the 10-day rule.

Wait, the correct reasoning is that the memo counts as a written confirmation under the merchant exception, making the contract enforceable. So the statute of frauds defense fails.

So which option aligns with this? Option E says the memo is a written contract under UCC, which makes sense because it's a written confirmation between merchants, satisfying the statute of frauds.

But wait, the memo was from the man, not the salesperson. So it's a written confirmation sent by the offeree (the man) to the offeror (the salesperson). Under UCC § 2-201(2), it's sufficient if one party is a merchant and the other isn't, but if both are merchants, then the written confirmation can satisfy the statute of frauds without a signature.

So the memo acts as the written confirmation, and since the salesperson didn't object within 10 days, the additional term is included, but more importantly, the memo serves as the written agreement needed for the statute of frauds.

So the salesperson's defense is invalid because the memo satisfies the statute of frauds. So looking at the options, option E states that the memo is considered a written contract under UCC, which would make the defense invalid.

Alternatively, option G says the statute of frauds isn't applicable between merchants, which isn't correct because the statute still requires a writing, but the exception applies when a written confirmation exists.

Wait, no— the statute of frauds still applies, but under the exception, the written confirmation suffices, so the contract is enforceable despite the statute of frauds. So the salesperson's defense based on the statute of frauds is invalid because the memo provides the necessary writing.

So the correct answer would be E or G. Wait, option G says the statute of frauds isn't applicable between merchants. That's not accurate because the statute of frauds still applies, but there's an exception when a written confirmation exists. So G is incorrect.

So the correct reasoning is that the memo serves as the required writing under the exception, making the contract enforceable. Therefore, the salesperson's defense fails.

Looking back at the options, option E states that the memo is considered a written contract, which is correct. So E would be the right choice.

Wait, but the memo was sent after the oral agreement. So it's a written confirmation, not the original agreement. Under UCC, as long as it's a written confirmation between merchants, it satisfies the statute of frauds, even if it's after the oral agreement.

So yes, the memo counts, making the contract enforceable. So the salesperson's defense is invalid, so the correct options would be E or G, but E is more accurate because G misstates the law about the statute of frauds not applying between merchants.

Another point: the memo adds a term about a discount. But under UCC § 2-207, any additional terms become part of the contract unless objected to within 10 days. Since the salesperson didn't object, the term is included. But that might not affect the statute of frauds issue because the memo itself serves as the writing.

So the main point is that the memo satisfies the writing requirement under the statute of frauds because it's a written confirmation between merchants, making the salesperson's defense invalid. So option E is correct.
</think>

The question revolves around the enforceability of a contract under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and the statute of frauds. The key issue is whether the man's memo, sent after oral acceptance, satisfies the writing requirement under the statute of frauds.

Under UCC § 2-201, contracts for the sale of goods over $500 must be in writing to be enforceable, but there is an exception for written confirmations between merchants under UCC § 2-201(2). In this case, both the man (hotel owner) and the salesperson (distributor) are merchants. The man sent a memo on March 17, received by the salesperson on March 20, which can be considered a written confirmation of the oral agreement. Although the memo adds a term about a 15% discount, this does not negate its sufficiency as a written confirmation under the statute of frauds.

The salesperson did not object to the memo within 10 days, as required by UCC § 2-207(1). Therefore, the memo satisfies the statute of frauds, making the contract enforceable. The salesperson's defense based on the statute of frauds is invalid because the memo serves as the required writing under the exception for merchants.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The man's payment was not due within 90 days, so this is irrelevant to the statute of frauds.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The memo was not inconsistent with the oral offer; it was a written confirmation with an additional term.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The memo was sufficient to indicate a contract was formed under the merchant exception.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The issue is about the statute of frauds, not the salesperson's breach of contract.
- **Option E**: Correct. The memo is considered a written contract under the UCC, satisfying the statute of frauds.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. A signature is not required for a written confirmation between merchants under UCC § 2-201(2).
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The statute of frauds still applies, but the memo satisfies the exception for written confirmations between merchants.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The timing of acceptance does not affect the statute of frauds.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the salesperson's failure to respond is relevant to the additional term, the memo itself satisfies the statute of frauds.

The most accurate statement is that the salesperson's defense is invalid because the man's memo is considered a written contract under the UCC.
