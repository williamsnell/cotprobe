Okay, so I've got this logic problem about unifiable expressions. Hmm, I remember that unification is about making two expressions identical by substituting variables. The problem gives me three expressions, I, II, III, and I need to figure out which pairs can be unified.

Let me read the expressions again. Expression I is f(w, w), so both arguments are the same variable. Expression II is f(x, 1), where the second argument is a constant 1. Expression III is f(y, g(z)), so the first argument is y and the second is a function g applied to z.

Wait, so the variables are w, x, y, z. So each expression can have their variables substituted. The question is which pairs can be made identical through substitution.

Let me think about each pair.

First, pair I and II: f(w,w) and f(x,1). To unify them, I need substitutions that make both expressions the same. Let's see:

For f(w,w) to match f(x,1), the first argument of I would have to be the same as the first of II, and the second same as the second of II. So, I's first argument is w, II's is x. So substitute w = x, and then the second argument of I is w (so same as x), and II's second is 1. So we need x = 1. So in substitution, set x=1 and w=1.

So substituting, I becomes f(1,1), and II becomes f(1,1). So yes, they can be unified. So pair I and II is unifiable.

Now, pair I and III: f(w,w) and f(y, g(z)). How can these match? Let me see.

I has both arguments as w. III has first argument y and second g(z). To make them the same, the first arguments must be equal, so y must be equal to w. The second arguments must be equal, so g(z) must equal w.

So substitution: y = w, and g(z) = w. So, let me pick substitutions. Let's say y = w and z can be any value such that g(z) = w. Wait, but variables are only w, x, y, z. So in substitution, we can set variables to constants or other terms.

Wait, substitution allows us to replace variables with terms, including function terms. So for instance, in III, g(z) could be set to w. So if I set z to a value such that g(z) is w. Or, perhaps, substitute z with something else.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as finding a substitution that makes both expressions identical. Let me try.

Let me let w = y. Then, the second argument of I is w, which is y. The second argument of III is g(z). So to make y = g(z), we can substitute z with a term that makes g(z)=y. For example, set z to some variable, say z = a, as long as g(a) = y. Wait, but variables are only w, x, y, z. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can set z = something else. Wait, perhaps I can set z to be a variable and adjust the substitution accordingly. Let me think.

Wait, substitutions can involve variables being set to other variables or to constants. So, for I and III to be unified, we need f(w, w) ≡ f(y, g(z)). So the substitution must make w = y and w = g(z). So, substitution would be y = w and g(z) = w. So, for example, if I set y to be w, and z to be any value such that g(z) is w, but since g is a function, perhaps z can be set to another variable or a constant. But wait, in the problem, are the functions and constants given? I think g is a function symbol, so g(z) is a term.

Wait, but for the expressions to be lexically identical after substitution, the structure must match. So f(w,w) after substitution must look like f(y', g(z')), and vice versa.

Wait, maybe I can make w and y the same, and then make g(z) the same as w. So, for example, set y = w, and g(z) = w. But z can be any variable, say, z = something, but g(z) must then be w. But unless g is a function that can return w when given some z. Or perhaps, if z is set to a function that when passed into g gives w. But since variables are placeholders, maybe we can set z = some term that makes g(z) = w.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set z = something else, but without knowing what g is, it's hard. Wait, but in unification, we don't need to know the function definitions. We just need to find a substitution that makes the terms equal. So we can treat g(z) as a term that can be equal to w.

So for the substitution, let's say we have:

y = w

g(z) = w

But since z is a variable, we can set z to any value such that g(z) becomes w. So, for example, let z = a, and then in the substitution, set a to be a term that makes g(a) = w. Wait, but variables can be substituted to any terms, including constants or other variables. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to set z = some variable, say u, and then set g(u) = w. But that might complicate things because u isn't one of the variables in the original expressions. Oh wait, the problem says only w, x, y, and z are variables. So substitutions can only involve these variables, or constants.

Wait, but in logic, substitutions can replace variables with terms, which include function symbols applied to variables. So perhaps, for expression III, the substitution could involve g(z) being set to a term. Alternatively, in the substitution, I could set z to a value that makes g(z) equal to w.

Wait, perhaps I can set z = w, but then g(z) would be g(w). So that would make the second argument of III be g(w). So for I and III to unify, we'd need w (from I) to be equal to g(w) (from III). So that would require g(w) = w. But how can I ensure that? Well, perhaps in the substitution, I can set w to be a term that satisfies g(w) = w. But that might not be possible without knowing more about g.

Wait, but in unification, I think it's allowed to have such substitutions. So, as long as there exists a substitution that makes the terms equal, regardless of function definitions. So, perhaps, yes, I can find such a substitution.

Let me try to write the substitution. Let me set y = w, as that's required from the first arguments. Then, for the second argument of III, g(z) must equal w. So I can set z to any value such that g(z) = w. Let's say z = a, but then g(a) = w. Wait, but 'a' isn't one of the variables in the expressions. Hmm, perhaps I can set z to another variable that would make g(z) = w.

Alternatively, perhaps I can allow z to be equal to w. So if z = w, then g(z) = g(w), and we can have g(w) = w. So the substitution would be y = w, z = w, and g(w) = w. But wait, substitution applies to variables, not function symbols. So I can't directly set g(w) to w; instead, I can only change variables. So perhaps I can set z to a value that makes g(z) = w.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. For I and III to be unified, their structures must match after substitution.

Expression I becomes f(w, w), and expression III becomes f(y, g(z)).

To make these the same, I need y to be the same as w, and g(z) to be the same as w.

So substitution would be y = w, and g(z) = w.

But g(z) is a function symbol applied to z. So, for g(z) to be equal to w, perhaps we can set z to be something that makes g(z) evaluate to w. But since we don't have any information about the function g, we can treat it as a variable. So, perhaps, set z to a new variable, but no, the variables allowed are only w, x, y, z.

Wait, but in substitution, variables can be replaced with other terms, including other variables. So for example, if I set z = w, then g(z) = g(w). But then, for that to equal w, we need g(w) = w. So perhaps in the substitution, I can set g(w) = w. But wait, in unification, substitution applies to variables, not to function symbols. So I think I can't directly set g(w) to w. Instead, perhaps I can only make g(z) equal to w by substituting z.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for an example substitution that would make I and III identical.

Let me try to find a substitution σ such that σ(I) = σ(III).

So σ must satisfy:

σ(f(w,w)) = σ(f(y, g(z)))

Which requires:

σ(w) = σ(y)  (since the first arguments must be equal)
σ(w) = σ(g(z))  (since the second arguments must be equal)

So, from the first equation, σ(y) = σ(w). Let's denote σ(w) as a term T.

Then, from the second equation, T must be equal to σ(g(z)). But σ(g(z)) is g(σ(z)), because function symbols are applied to the substituted arguments.

So, T = g(σ(z)).

So, we have:

σ(w) = T
σ(y) = T
T = g(σ(z))

So, we can choose T to be any term, but it's constructed from the variables and function symbols.

Let me pick T to be a variable, say T = x. Wait, but x is another variable. Alternatively, T could be a function, but perhaps the simplest way is to set T to be a variable that can be expressed as g applied to something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set σ(z) to be a term that when passed into g gives T, which is σ(w).

So, let's say σ(z) = a, then g(a) must equal T. But a is not in our variables, so perhaps that's not allowed.

Wait, perhaps the substitution can make σ(z) equal to something else. Let's say σ(z) = w. Then, g(σ(z)) = g(w). So, T must be g(w). But T is σ(w), so σ(w) = g(w).

So, in substitution terms:

σ(w) = g(w)
σ(y) = g(w)
σ(z) = w

Wait, but that would make σ(w) = g(w), which is a function applied to w. But is this acceptable in a substitution? Substitutions can assign variables to terms, which include function applications. So, yes, σ(w) can be g(w), and σ(y) would then be g(w) as well.

So, with this substitution, expression I becomes f(g(w), g(w)), and expression III becomes f(g(w), g(w)).

Wait, because substituting into III:

f(y, g(z)) → f(g(w), g(w)), since y = g(w) and z = w.

So yes, they become identical.

So this substitution works. Therefore, I and III are unifiable.

Now, let's look at pair II and III: f(x, 1) and f(y, g(z)).

To unify these, the first arguments must be equal, and the second must be equal.

So, x must equal y, and 1 must equal g(z).

So substitution would involve x = y and g(z) = 1.

But g(z) is a function applied to z, so to make g(z) equal to 1, perhaps we can set z to a value that makes g(z) = 1. For example, let's say z is a constant a such that g(a) = 1.

But wait, in the substitution, can we set z to a constant? The problem says variables are w, x, y, z, and the expressions are built with these variables. So, I think substitution can set variables to constants or other terms.

So, substitution σ would be:

σ(y) = σ(x) = x (so y = x)
σ(z) = a (some constant a)
and g(a) = 1.

But wait, g(a) =1 is a constraint on the function g, which isn't given. But in unification, we don't consider the function definitions, only the structure. So as long as there exists a substitution that makes the terms equal, it's possible.

So, for example, we can set σ(z) = some term that makes g(z) = 1. Let's say σ(z) = b, and then g(b) =1. So, yes, we can do that.

Thus, substitution would be y = x and z = b, and g(b) =1. Then, expression II becomes f(x, 1), and expression III becomes f(x, g(b)) = f(x,1).

So yes, II and III can be unified.

Wait, but wait: in the substitution, when you apply σ to f(y, g(z)), y becomes x, and z becomes b. So g(z) becomes g(b), which we've set to 1. So yes, it matches.

So that substitution works, so II and III can be unified.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, are 1 considered a constant? Because in the substitution, we're treating 1 as a constant, so yes.

So, in this case, II and III can be unified.

So, summarizing the pairs:

I and II: can be unified (as in substitution makes them both f(1,1)).

I and III: can be unified (as shown with substitution σ(w) = g(w), etc.)

II and III: can be unified (as shown with substitution y =x, z set to a term that makes g(z) =1.)

Wait, but wait, no! Wait, in the first pair, I and II: I is f(w,w), II is f(x,1). So when you unify them, you set w = x = 1, making both expressions f(1,1). So that's correct.

So all three pairs can be unified.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: (I, III) and (II, III) only

B: (II, III) only

C: (I, II) and (I, III) only

D: (I, II) only

E: Only single expressions are unifiable, not pairs.

F: None of the pairs are unifiable

G: (I, II), (I, III), and (II, III)

H: All three expressions are unifiable

I: (I, II) and (II, III) only

J: (I, III) only

Wait, so according to my analysis, all three pairs can be unified. So option G says (I, II), (I, III), and (II, III) are unifiable. So the correct answer would be G.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, I thought that I and II can be unified, I and III can be unified, and II and III can be unified. So all three pairs are unifiable. So G is the correct choice.

But wait, let me think again about II and III.

II is f(x,1). III is f(y, g(z)).

To unify, x must equal y, and 1 must equal g(z). So in substitution, we can set y =x, and find z such that g(z) =1.

But in substitution, do we have to assign z to a specific value? Or can we just set g(z) =1 by assigning z to some term.

Wait, in substitution, when you have a term like g(z), you can't directly set it to 1 unless you can express 1 as g(z) for some z. So you can set z to a value that makes g(z) =1. For example, set z to a new constant a, and have g(a)=1. But the variables allowed are only w, x, y, z. So can I set z to a new constant? Or can I set it to another variable?

Wait, substitution allows replacing variables with any terms, including constants, even if they're not in the original expressions. So in this case, substitution can set z to a constant a, not necessarily one of w, x, y, z. Because the variables in the expressions can be substituted with any term, including new constants.

So, for example, substitution σ could be:

σ(y) = x

σ(z) = a (where a is a new constant)

And then, we must have g(a) =1.

So, with this substitution, II becomes f(x,1), and III becomes f(x, g(a)) → f(x,1), since g(a)=1.

Therefore, II and III can indeed be unified.

So, all three pairs are unifiable, so option G is correct.
</think>

To determine which pairs of expressions are unifiable, we analyze the given expressions:

1. **Expression I**: \( f(w, w) \)  
2. **Expression II**: \( f(x, 1) \)  
3. **Expression III**: \( f(y, g(z)) \)  

Unification requires finding substitutions for the variables such that the expressions become lexically identical. Variables that can be substituted include \( w, x, y, z \), and substitutions can replace variables with constants or other terms.

### Analysis of Each Pair:

#### **Pair (I, II): \( f(w, w) \) and \( f(x, 1) \)**
- To unify, the first arguments must match (\( w = x \)) and the second arguments must match (\( w = 1 \)).
- Substitution: \( w = x = 1 \).
- After substitution: \( f(1, 1) \) for both expressions.
- **Conclusion**: This pair is unifiable.
