Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the electric field at the surface of a plutonium-239 nucleus. Hmm, I need to find the electric field magnitude. Let me think about what I remember from my physics classes.

Alright, the nucleus has 94 protons, each with a charge. The nucleus is modeled as a sphere with radius 6.64 femtometers, and the charge is uniformly spread throughout. I remember that the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere can be treated as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the formula for the electric field E would be similar to that of a point charge.

Wait, but wait. The formula for the electric field outside a charged sphere is E = (k * Q) / r², right? Yes, that's Coulomb's law applied to continuous charge distributions. So I can use that here since the point where I'm measuring is at the surface of the sphere, which is outside in this context because for a sphere, the electric field at the surface is the same as if all the charge were a point at the center.

So first, I need to find the total charge Q of the nucleus. Each proton has a charge of e, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. Since there are 94 protons, Q = 94 * e.

Let me calculate that: 94 * 1.602e-19 C. Let's see, 90 * 1.602e-19 is 1.4418e-17, and 4 * 1.602e-19 is 6.408e-19. Adding them gives 1.4418e-17 + 0.6408e-18? Wait, wait, no, 6.408e-19 is 0.6408e-18. So adding to 1.4418e-17 gives 1.4418e-17 + 0.6408e-18 = (1.4418 + 0.06408) e-17? Wait, 0.6408e-18 is 6.408e-19, which is 0.06408e-17. So 1.4418e-17 + 0.06408e-17 = 1.50588e-17 C. Hmm, I can double-check that. Alternatively, 94 * 1.602 is 150.588, so 150.588e-19 C, which is 1.50588e-17 C.

Okay, so Q is approximately 1.506e-17 C.

Next, the radius r is given as 6.64 femtometers. Oh wait, femtometers are 10^-15 meters. So r = 6.64e-15 meters.

Now, Coulomb's constant k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So plugging into the formula E = (k * Q) / r².

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate r squared: (6.64e-15 m)^2. Let's compute 6.64 squared. 6 squared is 36, 0.64 squared is about 0.4096, but wait, wait, no, (a + b)^2 is a² + 2ab + b². But maybe it's easier to calculate 6.64 * 6.64.

6 * 6 = 36, 6 * 0.64 = 3.84, 0.64 *6=3.84, 0.64^2=0.4096.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just do 6.64 * 6.64. Let me compute it: 6.64 times 6 is 39.84, 6.64 times 0.6 is 3.984, 6.64 times 0.04 is 0.2656. So adding: 39.84 + 3.984 = 43.824; 43.824 + 0.2656 = 44.0896. So (6.64)^2=44.0896. Therefore, r squared is 44.0896e-30 m² (since (e-15)^2 is e-30).

Wait, let me clarify: 6.64e-15 m squared is (6.64)^2 * (1e-15)^2 = 44.0896 * 1e-30 = 4.40896e-29 m². Wait, no, 44.0896e-30 is the same as 4.40896e-29, right? Because 44.0896e-30 = 4.40896e-29.

Wait, 44.0896e-30 is 4.40896 times 10^(-29), yes. Because 44.0896 is 4.40896 times 10^1, so 10^1 * 1e-30 is 1e-29. So r squared is 4.40896e-29 m².

Now, the denominator is r squared, so 4.40896e-29 m².

Now, the numerator is k * Q. Let me compute that. k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C², Q is 1.50588e-17 C.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 1.50588e-17.

So 8.988 * 1.50588 is approximately... Let me compute that. 8 * 1.5 is 12, 0.988 * 1.5 is about 1.482. So 12 + 1.482 = 13.482? Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 8.988 * 1.50588.

Let me do it step by step:

1.50588 * 8 = 12.04704

1.50588 * 0.988 = ?

Let me compute 1.50588 * 0.988.

1.50588 * 0.9 = 1.355292

1.50588 * 0.08 = 0.1204704

1.50588 * 0.008 = 0.01204704

Adding them: 1.355292 + 0.1204704 = 1.4757624 + 0.01204704 = 1.48780944.

So total 8.988 * 1.50588 = 12.04704 (from 8*1.50588) + 1.48780944 (from 0.988*1.50588) = 13.53485 approximately.

So 8.988e9 * 1.50588e-17 = (8.988 * 1.50588) e(9-17) = 13.53485e-8.

Wait, 9-17 is -8, so 13.53485e-8 = 1.353485e-7.

So the numerator is approximately 1.353485e-7 N·m²/C (since k is in N·m²/C² and Q is C, so the product is N·m²/C).

Now, the electric field E is (1.353485e-7) / (4.40896e-29) = ?

Let me compute that. 1.353485e-7 divided by 4.40896e-29.

First, 1.353485 / 4.40896 is approximately 0.307. Let me compute that more accurately.

4.40896 × 0.3 = 1.322688. 0.307 × 4.40896 = 4.40896 * 0.3 = 1.322688, plus 0.007 * 4.40896 = 0.030863. So 1.322688 + 0.030863 = 1.353551. Which is almost our numerator of 1.353485. So 0.307 gives a product of about 1.35355, which is very close to the numerator 1.353485. So approximately, 0.307.

So 0.307e( -7 - (-29) ) = 0.307e22. Since 1e-7 / 1e-29 = 1e22.

So E ≈ 0.307e22 N/C = 3.07e21 N/C.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.07e21 N/C, which seems to match.

Wait, but wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated 8.988e9 * 1.50588e-17. Let me compute 8.988 * 1.50588.

Alternative way: 8 * 1.50588 = 12.04704.

0.988 * 1.50588: Let's compute 1.50588 * 1 = 1.50588, 1.50588 * (-0.012) = approximately -0.01807.

So 1.50588 - 0.01807 = 1.48781.

So 8.988 * 1.50588 = 12.04704 + 1.48781 = 13.53485, same as before.

So that part is correct.

Then, 13.53485e-8 divided by 4.40896e-29: 13.53485 / 4.40896 ≈ 3.07, and 1e-8 / 1e-29 is 1e21, so 3.07e21 N/C. So the calculation seems correct.

So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the electric field at the surface of a plutonium-239 nucleus, we model the nucleus as a uniformly charged sphere with radius \( r = 6.64 \, \mathrm{fm} = 6.64 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{m} \) and a total charge \( Q \) due to 94 protons. Each proton has a charge \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \), so the total charge is:

\[
Q = 94 \cdot e = 94 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} = 1.50588 \times 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

The electric field at the surface of a uniformly charged sphere is given by:

\[
E = \frac{k \cdot Q}{r^2},
\]

where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) is Coulomb's constant. First, calculate \( r^2 \):

\[
r^2 = (6.64 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{m})^2 = 6.64^2 \cdot (10^{-15})^2 = 44.0896 \cdot 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{m^2} = 4.40896 \times 10^{-29} \, \mathrm{m^2}.
\]

Next, calculate the numerator \( k \cdot Q \):

\[
k \cdot Q = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.50588 \times 10^{-17}) = 13.53485 \times 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C}.
\]

Now, divide \( k \cdot Q \) by \( r^2 \):

\[
E = \frac{13.53485 \times 10^{-8}}{4.40896 \times 10^{-29}} = \frac{13.53485}{4.40896} \cdot 10^{21} \, \mathrm{N / C}.
\]

The ratio \( \frac{13.53485}{4.40896} \approx 3.07 \), so:

\[
E \approx 3.07 \times 10^{21} \, \mathrm{N / C}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**F: \( 3.07 \times 10^{21} \, \mathrm{N / C} \).**
