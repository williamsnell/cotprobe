Okay, so I have this question about Hobbes and the definition of injustice. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but let me think through this.

Hobbes was a 17th-century philosopher, right? He's known for his ideas on the social contract and the state of nature. From what I remember, Hobbes believed that without a strong central authority, life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." So he emphasized the importance of a sovereign to maintain order.

Now, the question is about what Hobbes considers injustice. The options are A to J, each giving a different definition. I need to figure out which one aligns with Hobbes' views.

Injustice, according to Hobbes, I think, relates to breaking the laws set by the sovereign. Because in his view, the sovereign is the authority that establishes the rules to maintain order and prevent the chaos of the state of nature. So if someone disobeys the sovereign, that's injustice.

Looking at the options:

A: Failure to abide by a contract. Wait, isn't that more about breach of contract, which is a legal issue, but not necessarily tied to the sovereign.

B: Disregard for societal norms. That's more about social norms rather than laws set by a ruler.

C: Acting against the welfare of others. That's a bit vague. It could relate to moral philosophy but not specifically Hobbes' definition.

D: Disobedience to parental authority. That seems more like a family matter, not the state.

E: Disobedience to God's law. Hobbes does talk about God, but I think his focus is more on the earthly sovereign as God's representative.

F: Acting against self-interest. That doesn't fit; Hobbes might say people act in self-interest, but that's not injustice.

G: Failure to follow the rule of law. This is close because it's about laws, but Hobbes ties the law to the sovereign.

H: Failure to respect inherent rights. I'm not sure if Hobbes focused on inherent rights as much as on the sovereign's authority.

I: Failure to uphold moral duties. That's more of a general ethical statement, not specific to Hobbes.

J: Disobedience to a sovereign. This seems to fit because Hobbes' entire system is based on the sovereign's authority. Injustice would be going against the sovereign's laws.

Wait, but option G says failure to follow the rule of law, which is similar. But isn't the rule of law established by the sovereign? So G and J are related. But I think for Hobbes, the key is obedience to the sovereign's laws, so the direct act of disobeying the sovereign would be the injustice.

So the answer should be J: disobedience to a sovereign.

J: disobedience to a sovereign.
