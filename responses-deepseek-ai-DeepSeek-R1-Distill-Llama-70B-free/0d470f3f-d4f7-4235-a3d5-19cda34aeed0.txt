Question:

Why did Mendel succeed in discovering the principlesof transmissions of hereditary traits, whereas others who had conducted such investigations had failed?

Options:

A: Mendel had a larger sample size than his contemporaries, which made his results statistically significant
B: Mendel's experiments were conducted over a longer period of time than those of other researchers, which gave him more data
C: Mendel studied the transmission of multiple traits at once
D: Mendel's success was purely due to luck
E: Mendel collaborated with other leading scientists of his time to develop his theories
F: Mendel's success was due to his background in mathematics, allowing him to see patterns that others missed
G: Mendel used advanced technology for his studies
H: Mendel was the first to use the scientific method in the study of heredity
I: Mendel had access to a secret garden with unique plant varieties that no one else had
J: Mendel's success was a combination of good experimental technique and luck. He studied one trait at a time, began with pure line plants, and luckily chose traits coded for by genes on different chromosomes.

Okay, so I've got this question about why Mendel succeeded where others failed. Hmm, I remember Mendel was the one who did experiments with pea plants and came up with the laws of inheritance. But why did he succeed when others didn't? Let me think about the options.

Option A says he had a larger sample size. I think he did have a good number of plants, but was that the main reason? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the key factor.

Option B mentions experiments over a longer time. I believe he did take several years, like seven or so, but again, not sure if that's the main reason.

Option C says he studied multiple traits at once. Wait, no, I think he studied one trait at a time. Like, he worked on height, then flower color, separately. So maybe C is incorrect because he focused on single traits.

Option D suggests luck. Well, luck might have played a role, but there must be more to it. Scientists usually have more than just luck.

Option E says he collaborated. I don't think he did; he was kind of isolated, right? So probably E is wrong.

Option F points to his math background. Oh, right, he was a math teacher or something. He used statistical methods, which helped him see the patterns as ratios. That makes sense because others might not have had that analytical approach.

Option G is about advanced technology. I don't think so; he used pea plants, which are easy to grow and don't require high tech. Probably not G.

Option H says he was first to use the scientific method in heredity. Well, others before him might have used some methods, but maybe not as rigorously. But I'm not certain if that's the main reason.

Option I talks about a secret garden. That doesn't ring a bell. I think he just used common pea plants, so I don't think I is correct.

Option J says it was a combination of good technique, luck, studying one trait, pure lines, and choosing traits on different chromosomes. Wait, I remember he used purebred plants to ensure they were true-breeding. So starting with pure lines is a solid foundation. Also, choosing traits that are on different chromosomes means the genes assort independently, which aligns with his laws. So J seems plausible.

So the question is whether it's F or J. Mendel's math background (F) helped him analyze data statistically. But also, his methodology—like using pure lines, single traits, and the right choice of traits—was crucial. Oh, and the luck part might come into play because the traits he chose happened to be on separate chromosomes, which made the results clearer.

So looking back, the correct answer is probably J because it combines multiple factors: his methodology and a bit of luck in choosing the right traits. Whereas option F is only about the math background, which is a part of it but not the whole story.

Mendel's success in discovering the principles of hereditary transmission can be attributed to a combination of factors. He employed good experimental techniques, such as starting with purebred plants to ensure true-breeding lines and studying one trait at a time to simplify his analysis. Additionally, he was fortunate in choosing traits coded by genes on different chromosomes, which allowed him to observe independent assortment. While his background in mathematics helped him analyze data statistically, it was the combination of rigorous methodology and luck that ultimately led to his success.

J: Mendel's success was a combination of good experimental technique and luck. He studied one trait at a time, began with pure line plants, and luckily chose traits coded for by genes on different chromosomes.

Answer: J
