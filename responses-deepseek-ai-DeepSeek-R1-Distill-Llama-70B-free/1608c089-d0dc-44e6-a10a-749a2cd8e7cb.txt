Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about principles related to corporate something and determining who a stakeholder or shareholder is. The question references Evan and Freeman from 1993, which I think is about stakeholder theory. 

The question is structured as: Principle of ________ and the Principle of _______ can be used to determine who constitutes a ______. The options are A to J.

I remember that Freeman and Evan discussed about the principles to identify stakeholders. From what I recall, they mentioned two principles: the principle of corporate rights and the principle of corporate effect. 

So the first two blanks are corporate rights and corporate effect. Then, the third blank is about who it's determining. Since the context is stakeholders, it should be stakeholder.

Looking at the options, let's check which one fits. Option A says corporate liability and corporate effect, determining a stakeholder. No, I think it's rights and effect. Option B: corporate rights, corporate effect, stakeholder. That sounds right.

Wait, let me make sure. Freeman's work was about identifying stakeholders based on who affects or is affected by the corporation. Evan and Freeman introduced the principles of corporate rights and corporate effects to define stakeholders. So yes, the third term would be stakeholder.

Looking again, option B is the first two correct and the third is stakeholder. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. Another thought: could the third term be shareholder instead? No, because stakeholders include more than just shareholdersâ€”like employees, customers, etc. So the question is about stakeholders, not shareholders. So option B has stakeholder. So yes, B is correct.

The correct answer is based on Evan and Freeman's principles of corporate rights and corporate effect, which are used to identify stakeholders.

Answer: B
