Question:

Suppose that 100 separate firms were tested to determine how many of them "beat the market" using a Jensen-type regression, and it is found that 3 fund managers significantly do so. Does this suggest prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency?

Options:

A: The results would be different if a different type of regression was used
B: This suggests evidence for stock market efficiency, not inefficiency
C: Yes
D: In order to answer this question, you would need to test every fund manager trading in that market
E: There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.
F: No
G: The results are inconclusive without knowing the performance of the market as a whole
H: It's impossible to draw conclusions based on the performance of only 100 firms
I: This indicates that the majority of fund managers do not significantly beat the market
J: This suggests that only a small percentage of fund managers can beat the market

Alright, so I've got this question here about stock market efficiency and fund managers. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Okay, the question says that 100 firms were tested using a Jensen-type regression, and 3 of them significantly beat the market. The big question is whether this suggests evidence of market inefficiency. Hmm. I remember that the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that financial markets are informationally efficient, meaning that the prices reflect all available information, so it's impossible to consistently achieve returns in excess of what's expected for the risk involved.

Wait, but Jensen's model is about measuring the performance of a portfolio. The Jensen alpha, right? So if a fund has a significantly positive alpha, it means the manager beat the market after adjusting for risk. So if 3 out of 100 did that, does that mean the market isn't efficient?

But wait, I also remember that in a perfectly efficient market, no one should be able to beat the market consistently. So if some do, that might suggest inefficiency. But I also recall something about statistical significance and the likelihood of some funds beating the market just by chance.

Oh, right! With a large number of funds, even if the market is efficient, you'd expect some to appear to beat it just due to random chance. Like, if you have 100 funds, and each has a 5% chance of being significantly positive, you'd expect about 5 to show up as significant. But here only 3 did. Hmm, so maybe that's actually less than what you'd expect by chance. Wait, no, wait. The question says 3 were significant, but I think the expected number under the null hypothesis (of no excess returns) would depend on the significance level used.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the significance level. If it's 5%, then 5% of 100 is 5. So 3 is less than that. So does that mean there's no evidence against the null hypothesis? Or does the fact that any are significant at all imply something?

Alternatively, maybe the question is more about the interpretation. So if you have 100 funds and 3 beat the market, under efficient markets, you wouldn't expect any to do so consistently. So even a few could suggest that maybe the market isn't perfectly efficient. But then again, statistics can sometimes show false positives.

Wait, I think I remember something about the false discovery rate. If you test many hypotheses, some will be significant just by chance. So in 100 tests at a 5% significance level, you'd expect about 5 false positives. So having 3 significant results might not be enough to reject the efficient market hypothesis because it's within the realm of random chance, especially if 3 is less than 5. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Let me think about the options. The question is asking whether this is prima facie evidence for inefficiency. Prima facie means at first glance, so without considering other factors. So if 3 out of 100 significantly beat the market, does that immediately suggest the market is inefficient?

Option C says yes. Option B says it suggests efficiency. Option E says there's not enough info. Option J says a small percentage can beat the market. Option I says most don't, which is true, but that's not directly answering about market efficiency.

So, the EMH would predict that no fund should consistently beat the market. So if even a few do, that might indicate inefficiency. But wait, in reality, studies have shown that very few funds consistently outperform, which some take as evidence that the market is efficient because the majority don't beat it, and those that do might be due to luck.

Alternatively, the presence of any funds beating the market could be seen as a sign of inefficiency. But I think the standard argument is that with so many funds, you'd expect some to beat the market just by chance, so it's not necessarily evidence of inefficiency unless the number is significantly higher than expected by chance.

Wait, but the question is phrased as whether it suggests prima facie evidence for inefficiency. So, at first glance, seeing any funds beat the market after adjusting for risk might seem like evidence against EMH. But the efficient market hypothesis would say that this shouldn't happen, so the existence of such funds is a challenge to EMH.

But then again, maybe the answer is that this isn't sufficient evidence because you could have a few outliers due to chance. So the correct answer might be that it's not conclusive evidence, but the question is whether it's prima facie.

Wait, another angle: in a truly efficient market, no fund should have a statistically significant alpha after considering transaction costs and other factors. So if 3 do, that suggests that either the market isn't efficient, or those 3 are just false positives.

But the question is asking if this is prima facie evidence. So without considering other explanations, the fact that some beat the market would point towards inefficiency.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options again. Option C says yes, which would mean that it is evidence. Option B says it's evidence for efficiency, which doesn't make sense because if some beat the market, that goes against efficiency.

Wait, no, option B says it's evidence for efficiency. That doesn't seem right. Because if the market is efficient, you shouldn't have funds beating it. So option B is probably wrong.

Option E says insufficient info. Maybe because we don't know if the 3 were significant after adjusting for multiple testing, like using a Bonferroni correction. So with 100 tests, the significance level per test would be much lower, so maybe those 3 weren't really significant. But the question says they were found to be significant, so perhaps that's already been accounted for.

Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that each test was done at, say, 5% significance, so 3 out of 100 is 3%, which is less than 5. So it's actually fewer than expected by chance. Wait, that's an interesting point. If the expected number of false positives is 5, and only 3 were found, that's actually lower. So maybe that suggests that the market is efficient because even fewer than expected by chance beat the market.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Another approach: the standard reasoning is that if the market is efficient, you wouldn't expect any fund to beat it. So if any do, especially more than you'd expect by chance, it's evidence of inefficiency.

But if 3 is about what you'd expect by chance (if the significance level is 5%, 5% of 100 is 5), then 3 is within that range, so maybe it's not evidence. But the question is whether it's prima facie evidence.

Wait, the question says "significantly" beat the market, which I think implies that their alphas were statistically significant. So, if 3 out of 100 were significant, that's 3%. If the tests were done at 5% significance, then you'd expect 5% of 100, which is 5. So 3 is less than that. So it's actually fewer than expected by chance. So that would support the efficient market hypothesis, because even fewer funds than expected by random chance managed to beat the market.

Wait, but then that would mean that the result doesn't suggest inefficiency. So the answer would be that it's not evidence of inefficiency, but rather consistent with efficiency.

So looking at the options, option B says it suggests evidence for efficiency. Option F says no, which I think would mean that the result isn't evidence for inefficiency. So I'm a bit confused between options B and F.

Wait, option F is "No," which would mean that the answer to the question is no, this doesn't suggest evidence for inefficiency. So the correct answer would be F.

But wait, the initial reasoning is that if 3 funds beat the market, and 5 would be expected by chance, then 3 is less than 5, which is consistent with the efficient market. So the presence of 3 significant funds doesn't provide evidence against EMH. So the answer would be that this does not suggest inefficiency, so the answer is F: No.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the options. Let me read the options again.

Option F is "No." So the question is whether this suggests prima facie evidence for inefficiency. If the answer is no, then the correct option is F.

Alternatively, some might argue that any significant alphas at all indicate some level of inefficiency, but I think the standard academic view is that you need to control for multiple testing. So if you have 100 funds and 3 are significant at 5%, but 5 would be expected, then 3 is actually below that. So it's not evidence of inefficiency.

So the correct answer would be F: No.

The question asks whether the finding that 3 out of 100 fund managers significantly "beat the market" using a Jensen-type regression suggests prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) posits that no fund should consistently achieve excess returns adjusted for risk, as market prices reflect all available information. The Jensen alpha measures a fund's risk-adjusted performance, and a significantly positive alpha indicates beating the market.

However, in a large sample of 100 funds, even under the assumption of market efficiency, some funds may appear to beat the market due to random chance. If each test uses a 5% significance level, approximately 5% of 100 funds (or 5 funds) would be expected to show significant results purely by chance. In this case, only 3 funds were significant, which is fewer than the 5 expected under the null hypothesis of market efficiency. This suggests that the results are consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis and do not provide prima facie evidence of inefficiency.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C (Yes)**: Incorrect. While the presence of funds beating the market might seem to challenge EMH, the number of significant funds (3) is within the range expected by chance, so it does not suggest inefficiency.
- **Option B (This suggests evidence for stock market efficiency, not inefficiency)**: Incorrect. While the results are consistent with efficiency, the question specifically asks about prima facie evidence for inefficiency, and this option does not directly address that.
- **Option E (There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency)**: Incorrect. The question provides enough information to assess whether the results suggest inefficiency.
- **Option F (No)**: Correct. The results do not suggest prima facie evidence for inefficiency, as the number of significant funds is within the range expected by chance under the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

Thus, the correct answer is **F: No**, as the findings do not provide evidence for stock market inefficiency.

Answer: F
