Question:

Consider the following three loci in humans, each of which is considered to be a complex locus with multiple alleles: ABO locus (6 alleles),Rhlocus (8 alleles) and MN locus (4 alleles). Assuming that each locus is independent of the other two, how many different genotypic combinations can there exist in a given population?

Options:

A: 2,400 different genotypic combinations
B: 10,000 different genotypic combinations
C: 1,728 different genotypic combinations
D: 3,600 different genotypic combinations
E: 5,000 different genotypic combinations
F: 192 different genotypic combinations
G: 9,216 different genotypic combinations
H: 6,000 different genotypic combinations
I: 7,560 different genotypic combinations
J: 8,640 different genotypic combinations

Okay, I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. So the question is about calculating the number of different genotypic combinations possible in a population, considering three loci: ABO, Rh, and MN. Each of these is a complex locus with multiple alleles, and they're all independent of each other. 

Hmm, right, so each locus has a certain number of alleles. The ABO locus has 6 alleles, Rh has 8, and MN has 4. Since each locus is independent, I think that means the alleles at one locus don't affect the others, so we can calculate the combinations for each separately and then multiply them together in the end.

Wait, but wait, the question is about genotypic combinations. Oh right, genotype refers to the specific set of alleles an individual has at a locus. For a single locus with multiple alleles, how do you calculate the number of possible genotypes?

I remember that for a single locus, the number of possible genotypes is determined by the number of alleles. For a diploid organism, each individual has two alleles per locus. If a locus has 'n' alleles, the number of possible genotypes is the number of ways you can choose 2 alleles, considering that order doesn't matter but you can have two of the same (since you can be homozygous).

Oh right, the formula for the number of genotypes at a single locus is n(n+1)/2, but wait, wait. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. No, I think that's the number of possible combinations when considering all possible pairs, including homozygotes and heterozygotes.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have n alleles, the number of possible diploid genotypes is the number of all possible pairs, where each pair is unordered and can include the same allele twice. So that would be the combination with repetition formula. The formula for combinations with repetition is (n + k -1 choose k), where k is the number of items to choose. Here, k is 2 because diploid has two alleles. So it's (n + 2 -1 choose 2) = (n+1 choose 2) = n(n+1)/2.

Wait but wait, that's for any number of alleles. So for each locus, the number of possible genotypes is n alleles taken 2 at a time with replacement. So yes, that's (n^2 +n)/2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the number of possible genotypes for a locus with n alleles is the number of possible pairs, considering that each genotype is a pair of two alleles (can be same or different). So for each locus, the number of genotypes is n(n+1)/2.

Wait, another way: the number of possible heterozygous genotypes is (n choose 2) because each heterozygote is a unique combination of two different alleles. And the number of homozygous is n, one for each allele. So the total is (n choose 2) + n = [n(n-1)/2] + n = (n^2 -n + 2n)/2 = (n^2 +n)/2 = n(n+1)/2. That's correct.

So for each locus:

ABO has 6 alleles. So number of genotypes is 6*7/2 = 21.

Rh has 8 alleles. So Rh genotypes: 8*9/2 = 36.

MN has 4 alleles. So MN genotypes: 4*5/2 = 10.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait! Hold on. Wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because when I'm considering all possible genotypic combinations across the three loci, each locus's genotype is independent. So the total number of genotypic combinations is the product of each locus's possible genotypes.

So the total would be (number of ABO genotypes) × (number of Rh genotypes) × (number of MN genotypes). 

So, ABO is 6 alleles, so 6*7/2=21.

Rh is 8 alleles, so 8*9/2=36.

MN is 4 alleles, 4*5/2=10.

So total is 21 ×36 ×10.

Wait, let me compute that. 21 ×36 is 756, and 756 ×10 is 7560. So total of 7,560 different genotypic combinations.

Looking at the options, option I is 7,560. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.

ABO alleles: 6. Genotypes: 6 × (6+1)/2 = 21. Correct.

Rh: 8 ×9/2 = 36. Correct.

MN:4 ×5/2=10. Correct.

21 ×36 = 756. 756 ×10 is indeed 7560, which is option I.

So the correct answer is I: 7,560 different genotypic combinations.

To determine the number of different genotypic combinations in a population for the three loci (ABO, Rh, and MN), we calculate the number of possible genotypes at each locus and then multiply them together, as the loci are independent.

1. **ABO locus**:  
   The ABO locus has 6 alleles. The number of possible genotypes is calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition:  
   \[
   \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{6 \times 7}{2} = 21
   \]

2. **Rh locus**:  
   The Rh locus has 8 alleles. The number of possible genotypes is:  
   \[
   \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{8 \times 9}{2} = 36
   \]

3. **MN locus**:  
   The MN locus has 4 alleles. The number of possible genotypes is:  
   \[
   \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 10
   \]

4. **Total genotypic combinations**:  
   Since the loci are independent, the total number of genotypic combinations is the product of the genotypes at each locus:  
   \[
   21 \times 36 \times 10 = 7560
   \]

Thus, the total number of different genotypic combinations in the population is **7,560**, which corresponds to option **I**.
