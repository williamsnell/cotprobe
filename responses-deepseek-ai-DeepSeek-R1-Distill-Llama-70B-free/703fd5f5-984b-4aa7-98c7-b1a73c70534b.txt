Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about calculating the ground-state energy of positronium. Positronium is an "atom" made up of a positron and an electron. Hmm, I remember that a positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron. So it has the same mass as an electron but the opposite charge, right? So the positron has charge +e, and the electron is -e.

Wait, the positronium system is like a hydrogen atom but with a positron instead of a proton, I guess. Because in hydrogen, the nucleus is a proton, and the electron orbits around it. So in positronium, it's a positron and an electron orbiting around their mutual center of mass, maybe.

The question is asking for the ground-state energy in electronvolts. Ground state usually means the lowest energy level, which is the most stable state. So I need to calculate the energy of the positronium in that state.

I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms can be calculated using the formula E_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2)/(n^2), where Z is the atomic number and n is the principal quantum number. But wait, hydrogen's formula is E_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2)/(n^2). For hydrogen, Z is 1, so the ground state (n=1) is -13.6 eV.

But positronium isn't hydrogen. It's a system where both particles have the same mass, I think. Because the positron and electron have the same mass, unlike in hydrogen where the proton is much heavier. Oh right, in the hydrogen atom, the proton is so much heavier than the electron that the center of mass is almost at the proton's position. But in positronium, both particles have equal mass, so they orbit around their mutual center of mass, which is exactly midway between them.

So this must affect the reduced mass of the system. I remember that the reduced mass μ is given by (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). In the case of positronium, m1 = m2 = electron mass (m_e). So μ = (m_e * m_e)/(m_e + m_e) ) = m_e^2/(2 m_e) ) = m_e / 2.

Wait, in the hydrogen atom, the reduced mass is approximately m_e because the proton's mass is so large. But in positronium, the reduced mass is m_e/2. That must change the energy levels.

So the energy levels formula would be similar to hydrogen but scaled by the reduced mass. Let me think about the formula. The general formula for the ground state energy (n=1) is E = - (μ * e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) * (1/(n^2)). Or wait, another approach is to use the Rydberg constant, which incorporates the reduced mass.

The Rydberg constant R is given by R = (μ e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 h^3 c), but maybe I should think in terms of the energy levels. Alternatively, the energy levels can be written as E_n = - (μ / m_e) * (13.6 eV) / n².

Wait, because in the hydrogen atom, the energy is -13.6 eV for n=1, which is when μ ≈ m_e. So if the reduced mass is μ, then the energy would scale by μ/m_e.

In positronium, μ = m_e/2. So the ground state energy would be E_1 = -13.6 eV * (μ/m_e) = -13.6 eV * ( (m_e/2) / m_e ) ) = -13.6 eV * (1/2) = -6.8 eV.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when both particles have the same mass, the reduced mass is half the electron mass, so the energy is half as much in magnitude as the hydrogen ground state. So the ground state energy of positronium is -6.8 eV.

Looking at the options, option B is -6.8 eV. So the answer should be B.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Some sources say that positronium's ground state is -6.8 eV. Because when you have two particles orbiting, the energy levels are lower (more negative) than if one particle is much heavier. Oh wait, no, in this calculation, it's less negative. Because 6.8 is less than 13.6, so it's a higher energy (less negative) than hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is E_n = -13.6 eV * (μ/m_e) / n^2. So for positronium, μ is m_e/2. So E_1 = -13.6 * (1/2) = -6.8 eV.

Yes, that's correct. So the ground state is -6.8 eV, which is option B.

The positronium system consists of a positron and an electron, both having the same mass but opposite charges. This system is analogous to a hydrogen atom, but with a key difference: in hydrogen, the proton is much heavier than the electron, whereas in positronium, both particles have equal mass. This symmetry affects the reduced mass of the system, which is given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

For positronium, since \(m_1 = m_2 = m_e\) (the electron mass), the reduced mass becomes:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_e \cdot m_e}{m_e + m_e} = \frac{m_e}{2}
\]

The energy levels of a hydrogen-like system are given by:

\[
E_n = -\frac{\mu e^4}{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n^2}
\]

For the ground state (\(n = 1\)), the energy can also be expressed as:

\[
E_1 = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \cdot \frac{\mu}{m_e}
\]

Substituting \(\mu = \frac{m_e}{2}\):

\[
E_1 = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -6.8 \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the ground-state energy of positronium is \(-6.8 \, \text{eV}\). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: -6.8 eV**

Answer: B
