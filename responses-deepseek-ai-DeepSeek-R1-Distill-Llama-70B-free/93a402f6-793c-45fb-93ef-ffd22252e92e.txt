Question:

Knowing that a homeowner was away on vacation, two men decided to burglarize her home. Since they didn't have a car, the men asked the defendant to drive them to the home. The two men did not tell the defendant what they intended to do there. The defendant drove them to the house. While the defendant waited in the car, the two men entered the home by using a master key to unlock the front door. They then stole several items of expensive jewelry from the bedroom. Concealing the jewelry in their pockets, they left the house and got back into the defendant's car. Unaware of the theft, the defendant drove the two men back to their apartments. The next day, the two men pawned the jewelry for $5,000. Two weeks later, the two men gave the defendant $500 and told him for the first time about the burglary. The defendant kept the money and did not report the theft to the police. If the defendant is subsequently prosecuted, he should be found

Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, the situation is about a defendant who drove two men to a house, waited in the car while they went in, and later received some money from them after they pawned the stolen jewelry. The question is about whether the defendant is guilty of aiding and abetting burglary or receiving stolen property, or both, or neither.

First, I need to understand the elements of each crime involved here. The two main crimes here are aiding and abetting a burglary and receiving stolen property.

Aiding and abetting a burglary would require that the defendant intentionally assisted or facilitated the commission of the burglary. To be guilty, the defendant must have known that the others intended to commit a burglary. So, the key here is whether the defendant knew what the two men were planning when they asked for the ride.

In the scenario, the two men didn't tell the defendant what they intended to do at the house. The defendant drove them there, waited, and then drove them back. At the time of driving, the defendant was unaware of the theft. So, did the defendant have the necessary knowledge or intent to aid and abet the burglary?

I think that for aiding and abetting, the defendant must have knowledge of the unlawful purpose. If he didn't know they were going to commit a burglary, then he can't be guilty of aiding and abetting. So, if the men didn't tell him their plan, and he had no reason to know, then maybe he's not guilty of aiding and abetting.

Next, the issue of receiving stolen property. The defendant received $500 two weeks after the burglary. At that point, he was told about the burglary. So, when he received the money, he knew it was from stolen property. The elements for receiving stolen property are that the defendant knowingly received property that was stolen, with the intent to deprive the owner permanently.

Here, the defendant kept the money and didn't report it. So, he clearly knew the money was from the burglary when he received it. Therefore, he would be guilty of receiving stolen property.

So, putting it together: if the defendant didn't know about the burglary at the time he drove them, he's not guilty of aiding and abetting. But since he later accepted money knowing it was stolen, he is guilty of receiving stolen property.

Looking at the options, option C says guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of aiding and abetting. Option A says guilty of aiding and abetting but not receiving. So which is correct?

Wait, I might have mixed up. Let me think again. Aiding and abetting requires that the defendant assisted with the commission of the crime and had the intent to do so. If the defendant drove them without knowing their intent, he didn't have the necessary intent. So, he's not guilty of aiding and abetting.

But receiving stolen property: he received the money knowing it was stolen. So he is guilty of that.

So the correct option would be C: guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of aiding and abetting.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is "guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of aiding and abetting a burglary." Option E is guilty of both.

So, the answer should be C.

Wait, but another angle: could the defendant's act of driving them to the house be considered aiding and abetting even if he didn't know their exact plan? For example, if a reasonable person would have suspected that something illegal was going on, would that impose some liability?

But I think the general rule is that the defendant must have knowledge of the specific unlawful purpose. So, if he didn't know they were going to commit a burglary, he can't be guilty of aiding and abetting.

So, the correct answer is C.

The defendant's liability hinges on the elements of aiding and abetting burglary and receiving stolen property. Aiding and abetting requires intentional assistance with knowledge of the unlawful purpose. Here, the defendant drove the men to the house without being informed of their intent to commit burglary. Since he lacked knowledge of their plan, he cannot be guilty of aiding and abetting. However, when he later received $500 knowing it was from the burglary, he fulfilled the elements of receiving stolen property. Thus, he is guilty of receiving stolen property but not aiding and abetting.

Answer: C
