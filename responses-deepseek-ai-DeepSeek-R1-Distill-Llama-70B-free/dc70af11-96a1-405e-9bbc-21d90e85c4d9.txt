Question:

A plaintiff sued a department store for injuries she sustained when she slipped and fell in the store. At trial, the plaintiff proposes to testify that, when the store manager rushed to the scene, he said to the plaintiff, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects. How should the court rule on the admissibility of the store manager's testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is inadmissible, because it is considered a hearsay exception for statements of personal or family history.
B: The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.
C: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party.
E: The testimony is admissible in its entirety, because it is considered a party admission.
F: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.
G: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as a res gestae statement.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it violates the rule against hearsay, with no applicable exceptions.
I: The testimony about the water is inadmissible, but the statement about paying for the ambulance and hospital bill is admissible as an admission of guilt.
J: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking it down.

The scenario is a plaintiff suing a department store after slipping and falling. At trial, the plaintiff wants to testify about what the store manager said when he rushed to the scene. The manager said, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry —the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects, and I need to determine if this testimony is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

The manager's statement has two parts: apologizing about the water and offering to pay medical bills. I think each part might be treated differently.

First, the apology part: "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there." I think admissions by a party-opponent are an exception to hearsay. Under Federal Rule 801(d)(2), statements offered against an opposing party that are the party's own statements are not considered hearsay. So the part about the water could be admissible as a party admission because it's the manager (an agent of the store) acknowledging that there was water on the floor, which might show negligence.

Now, the second part: "don't worry — the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." This sounds like an offer to pay medical expenses. I recall that under Federal Rule 409, evidence of offering to pay medical expenses is inadmissible to prove liability. So that part might not be admissible because it's being offered to show that the store accepted liability, which is prohibited.

Wait, but I also remember that party admissions can include statements that are implicitly admitting fault. So the offer to pay could be seen as an admission. But wait, isn't there a specific rule about offers to pay medical expenses?

Yes, Rule 409 says that evidence of furnishing, offering, or promising to pay medical expenses is inadmissible to prove liability for the injury. So even if it's a party admission, the offer to pay is excluded under this rule. Unless... unless the statement is being offered for another purpose, like proving the fact that the injury occurred, but in this case, it's about liability.

So putting it together: the first part about the water is admissible as a party admission (so it's not hearsay), but the second part about paying the bills is inadmissible under Rule 409. Therefore, the court should allow the first part but exclude the second part.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the testimony about the water is admissible, but the rest is inadmissible as an offer to pay. That seems to match my analysis.

Wait, but another thought: the entire statement is being offered by the plaintiff. Is the manager's statement considered a statement of the opposing party? Yes, because the manager is the store's employee, so his statement is attributable to the store. Therefore, the first part is a party admission, so it's admissible. The second part is an offer to pay, which is inadmissible under 409.

So the correct ruling should be that part of the testimony is admissible, and part is not. Looking back at the options:

Option B: The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses. That fits.

Another option might be E, which says it's all admissible as a party admission. But no, because the offer to pay is excluded by Rule 409, even if it's a party admission. So E isn't correct.

So the answer should be B.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a store manager's statement made to the plaintiff after a slip-and-fall incident. The manager's statement has two parts: (1) "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there," and (2) "don't worry — the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The analysis focuses on whether these statements qualify as hearsay and whether any exceptions or rules apply.

1. **First Part of the Statement ("I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there")**:  
   This part is admissible as a party admission under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). Since the manager is an agent of the store, his statement acknowledging the presence of water on the floor is considered a statement of an opposing party and is not barred by the hearsay rule.

2. **Second Part of the Statement ("don't worry — the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill")**:  
   This part is inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 409, which prohibits the use of offers to pay medical expenses to prove liability. While this statement could be seen as a party admission, Rule 409 specifically excludes such offers from being used to establish liability.

Given this analysis, the court should rule that the first part of the statement is admissible, while the second part is inadmissible. Among the provided options, **Option B** correctly reflects this conclusion.

**Answer: B**
