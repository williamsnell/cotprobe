Okay, I need to figure out which of the given options is false regarding regression. So let's go through each option one by one.

First, I remember that regression analysis is a statistical method used for establishing relationships between variables. It's commonly used for prediction, like predicting house prices based on size or number of rooms. So option B says it's used for prediction, which sounds correct.

Option C mentions relating inputs to outputs. That makes sense because regression models typically have predictors (inputs) and an outcome variable (output). So C is true.

Option A says it may be used for interpretation. I think regression helps in understanding how variables are related, so yes, it's used for interpretation. A is true.

Now, option D claims it discovers causal relationships. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that correlation doesn't imply causation. Regression can show that variables are related, but it doesn't necessarily prove that one causes the other. So D might be the false statement because regression alone doesn't establish causation without additional assumptions or experimental design.

So the false sentence should be D.

The sentence that is FALSE regarding regression is:

**D: It discovers causal relationships**

Regression can identify correlations and relationships between variables, but it does not inherently establish causation. Causality requires additional evidence beyond statistical association. 

Answer: D
