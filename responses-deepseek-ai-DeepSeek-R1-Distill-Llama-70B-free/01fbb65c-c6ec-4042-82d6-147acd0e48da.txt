The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

Options:

A: Both severing the dorsal and ventral roots cause increased sensation and reflex action.
B: Severing the dorsal root causes loss of motor function, severing the ventral root causes enhanced sensation.
C: Both severing the dorsal and ventral roots lead to complete paralysis of the affected part.
D: Severing the dorsal root causes enhanced movement, severing the ventral root has no effect.
E: Severing the dorsal root causes loss of sensation and reflex action, severing the ventral root causes inability to move the affected part.
F: Severing the dorsal root has no effect, severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation.
G: Severing the dorsal root causes paralysis, severing the ventral root causes heightened sensitivity.
H: Severing the dorsal root causes involuntary twitching, severing the ventral root causes loss of reflex action.
I: Severing the dorsal root causes increased reflex action, severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation.
J: Severing the dorsal root has no effect, severing the ventral root causes paralysis.

Okay, so I have this question about the nervous system, specifically dealing with the roots of nerves. Hmm, I remember that nerves have two main roots: the dorsal and the ventral. Let me think about what each does.

The dorsal root, I think, is responsible for sensory information. Like, when you touch something, the sensory neurons carry that signal to the spinal cord through the dorsal root. So if that's cut, the rat wouldn't feel sensations from the leg. But wait, how does that affect reflexes?

Reflexes are automatic responses, right? They often don't require the brainâ€”they can happen at the spinal cord level. For a reflex to happen, there's a sensory neuron (afferent), which detects the stimulus, then interneurons in the spinal cord, and then a motor neuron (efferent) that causes the response. So for a reflex, you need both the sensory input and the motor output.

If the dorsal root is severed, the sensory input can't reach the spinal cord. That means the rat can't feel the stimulus. But without the sensory input, the reflex can't be triggered either. So reflexes that depend on those sensory neurons would be lost.

Now, the ventral root is related to motor functions. The motor neurons carry signals from the central nervous system to the muscles and glands. If the ventral root is cut, those signals can't get through. So the muscles wouldn't receive the commands to move. That would cause paralysis of the affected part because the motor functions are blocked. But wait, the sensory part would still be okay, right? Because the dorsal root is intact. So the rat would still feel sensations but wouldn't be able to move that leg.

So putting it all together, if the dorsal root is severed, the rat loses sensation in the leg and can't perform reflexes because the sensory input is gone. If the ventral root is cut, the rat can't move the leg (paralysis), but sensation remains.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this. Let me go through them.

Option E: Severing the dorsal root causes loss of sensation and reflex action. Severing the ventral root causes inability to move. That sounds right. So E would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The question asks how each severing affects the rat. So when the dorsal (sensory) is cut, no sensation and no reflexes. When the ventral (motor) is cut, can't move. Yes, that's E.

The dorsal root of a nerve is responsible for transmitting sensory information to the spinal cord, while the ventral root carries motor signals from the spinal cord to the muscles. Severing the dorsal root disrupts sensory input, leading to a loss of sensation in the affected area and impairing reflexes that rely on sensory feedback. On the other hand, severing the ventral root interrupts motor output, resulting in paralysis of the affected part but leaving sensation intact.

Among the given options, **Option E** accurately describes these effects: severing the dorsal root causes loss of sensation and reflex action, while severing the ventral root causes inability to move the affected part.

Answer: E
