Okay, so I've got this Morse code question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking how many distinct symbols can be represented using Morse code sequences that are 1, 2, 3, or 4 units long. Each unit is either a dot or a dash. So, I guess each position in the sequence is a binary choice: either dot or dash.

Hmm, right, Morse code uses sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and other symbols. Each symbol has a unique sequence, and the length can vary. So, the question is about calculating the total number of possible distinct symbols for sequences up to four elements long.

Let me break it down. For each possible length (1, 2, 3, 4), I need to calculate the number of possible sequences and then sum them all.

Starting with length 1. Since each element can be either a dot or a dash, that's two possibilities. So, 2^1 = 2 symbols possible here.

Then length 2. Each of the two positions has two choices. So, 2 * 2 = 4. Alternatively, 2^2 is 4. So, 4 symbols for length 2.

Similarly, length 3 would be 2^3 = 8. And length 4 would be 2^4 = 16.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. So for each additional element in the sequence, the number of possibilities doubles because each new position adds a factor of 2.

So total symbols is the sum of each of these. So, for lengths 1 through 4:

Length 1: 2
Length 2: 4
Length 3: 8
Length 4: 16

Adding them up: 2 + 4 = 6; 6 +8=14; 14+16=30.

Wait, so that's 30. Let me check the options. Option E is 30. So, the answer should be E.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Oh, right, sometimes in coding problems, people might forget whether to include all lengths or just up to a certain one. But here, the question clearly says sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes. So yes, adding all those possibilities.

Another way to think about it: the total number is the sum of 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4. Which is 2 +4+8+16= 30. Yep, that's right.

So, looking at the options: A is 40, B is 20, C 15, D 10, E 30, F 4680, G 100, H 3, I 50, J 60. So E is 30.

To determine how many distinct symbols can be represented in Morse code using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes, we calculate the number of possible sequences for each length and sum them:

- For sequences of length 1: \(2^1 = 2\) possible sequences.
- For sequences of length 2: \(2^2 = 4\) possible sequences.
- For sequences of length 3: \(2^3 = 8\) possible sequences.
- For sequences of length 4: \(2^4 = 16\) possible sequences.

Adding these together:  
\[
2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of distinct symbols is 30. Among the given options, the correct answer is **E: 30**.
