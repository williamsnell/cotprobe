Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this ethics question about a psychotherapist, Dr. Ryan, and a past relationship. Let me read through the problem again.

So, Dr. Ryan is a psychotherapist in a small town. She gets a call from a man she was sexually involved with several years ago. The relationship only lasted three months and ended amicably. Now, this man is married and is having problems unrelated to their past. He wants to start therapy with her. The question is what she should do.

The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is the correct course of action according to ethical guidelines.

First, I remember that in psychotherapy, there are strict rules about dual relationships and maintaining professional boundaries. Dual relationships occur when a therapist has another relationship with a client outside of the therapeutic one, like a social or business relationship, which can create conflicts of interest and impair the therapist's objectivity.

In this case, Dr. Ryan had a past sexual relationship with the man. Even though it ended a few years ago and amicably, the fact that they were sexually involved is significant. I think this is a clear dual relationship situation. The concern here is whether this past relationship could affect Dr. Ryan's ability to remain objective and maintain professional boundaries.

I recall that many professional ethics codes, like the APA (American Psychological Association) or the NASW (National Association of Social Workers) codes, have specific guidelines about this. For example, the APA ethics code says that psychologists should avoid engaging in therapy with former sexual partners because it can lead to exploitation or impaired judgment.

Looking at the options:

Option A: She sees the man but discloses the past relationship to a supervisor. I'm not sure if this is enough. Just disclosing doesn't necessarily solve the ethical problem. It's about whether the therapy can be effective without bias.

Option B: Deny without a reason. This might be too abrupt. Therapists should usually provide some explanation, but maybe in this case, it's better not to engage at all.

Option C: See him only if it's been over two years and she's sure it won't affect objectivity. I don't think there's a specific time frame like two years in the ethics codes. It's more about the nature of the relationship and current impact.

Option D: See him if she can maintain boundaries. But given their past, even if she thinks she can, the ethical guidelines might prohibit it regardless.

Option E: Refer to a colleague. This seems plausible because she can't treat him herself, so referring avoids the dual relationship problem.

Option F: Continue therapy but avoid discussing the past. That doesn't seem right because avoiding the topic might lead to issues in therapy, and the past relationship is a significant factor.

Option G: See him if she determines no interference. But I think the problem is that the past relationship itself is a conflict, regardless of her feelings about it.

Option H: Therapy over phone or online. Physical distance doesn't solve the ethical issue of a past sexual relationship.

Option I: Only if his wife knows. That's not directly relevant. The issue is Dr. Ryan's professional ethics, not the wife's knowledge.

Option J: See him but discuss potential conflicts. Discussing it might be part of the process, but the underlying issue is whether she should take him on as a client at all.

Wait, so the key here is whether the past sexual relationship prohibits her from treating him. From what I remember, the APA and other codes state that a therapist should not engage in a therapeutic relationship with someone with whom they've had a sexual relationship. It's considered a dual relationship that can impair objectivity and create an exploitative situation.

So, in this case, Dr. Ryan should not agree to treat him. Instead, she should refer him to another therapist. Looking at the options, E says refer to a colleague, which would be the appropriate action.

But wait, let me double-check. Some codes might allow such a relationship under certain conditions, but generally, it's discouraged. The fact that the relationship ended amicably and was short might not matter because the ethical issue is the prior sexual involvement.

Therefore, the correct answer should be E: refer the man to a colleague.

Dr. Ryan is faced with a situation where a man she had a past sexual relationship with is seeking therapy. Ethical guidelines in psychotherapy, such as those from the APA, prohibit therapists from engaging in a therapeutic relationship with former sexual partners due to the risk of impaired objectivity and potential exploitation. Despite the relationship ending amicably and unrelated to his current issues, the ethical conflict remains. The appropriate course of action is for Dr. Ryan to refer the man to a colleague to avoid the dual relationship and maintain professional boundaries. 

The correct answer is **E: refer the man to a colleague.**
