Okay, let's tackle this question about money and financial markets. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the options A to D is true. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: As the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases. Hmm, I remember that when the demand for bonds goes up, more people are buying them. Bonds are debt instruments, so when demand increases, the price of bonds should go up. But wait, interest rates are inversely related to bond prices. So if bond prices rise, interest rates actually fall. So option A might be incorrect because if demand for bonds increases, interest rates would decrease, not increase.

Option B: For a given money supply, if nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money decreases. Velocity of money is calculated as V = GDP/M. If the money supply (M) is constant and GDP increases, then V would increase, right? Because you're dividing a larger GDP by the same M. So if GDP goes up and M stays the same, V goes up, not down. So option B is saying the opposite, so it's probably wrong.

Option C: When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls. Asset demand for money refers to the demand for money as an asset, which people hold instead of other assets like stocks or bonds. If demand for stocks and bonds increases, people are more likely to hold those instead of money. So the desire to hold money as an asset would decrease. That makes sense. So option C sounds correct.

Option D: A macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds. During a recession, economic activity slows down. Firms might not want to invest as much because demand for their products is down. So the demand for loanable funds, which is often used for investment, would decrease, not increase. So option D is probably incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option C: Asset demand for money depends on the opportunity cost, which is the interest rate. When demand for stocks and bonds increases, their prices rise, which usually means that interest rates on bonds fall (since bond prices and interest rates are inversely related). Lower interest rates would make holding money less costly (since the alternative is earning less interest), so people might hold more money. Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, no. Asset demand for money is the demand for money as an alternative to other assets. If bonds and stocks are more attractive (higher expected returns), people hold less money. But if the demand for stocks and bonds increases, their prices go up. For bonds, higher price means lower interest rates. So if interest rates fall, the opportunity cost of holding money (which doesn't pay as much) is lower. So people might hold more money because the alternative (bonds) gives less interest. Hmm, now I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The asset demand for money is inversely related to the interest rate. When interest rates rise, people hold less money (because they prefer to hold interest-bearing assets). If demand for stocks and bonds increases, interest rates might fall because more people are buying bonds, driving up their prices and lowering their yields. So if interest rates fall, the asset demand for money increases because the opportunity cost is lower. So in that case, option C would be incorrect because it says the asset demand for money falls when demand for stocks and bonds increases. But if interest rates fall, asset demand for money should rise, not fall. So maybe I was wrong before.

Wait, but let me get this straight. When demand for stocks and bonds increases, it's because people expect higher returns from them. So they might move money out of money (like cash) into these assets, which would decrease the asset demand for money. Alternatively, if interest rates on bonds fall, that makes holding money more attractive, increasing asset demand. So which effect dominates?

I think when demand for bonds increases, bond prices rise and interest rates fall. Lower interest rates make holding money more attractive, so asset demand for money increases. But if people are buying more stocks and bonds, they're selling money to do so, which would reduce the asset demand for money. But wait, money is a financial asset, so when you buy a bond, you're using money to purchase it. So the asset demand for money would decrease because you're holding more bonds and less money.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the equation. The asset demand for money is L2 = k * Y * (1/i), where i is the interest rate. So if i decreases, L2 increases. So when demand for bonds increases, i decreases, so L2 increases. So the asset demand for money increases, not decreases. So option C says it falls, which would be wrong. So maybe my initial thought was incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about when demand for stocks and bonds increases. So if people are buying more stocks and bonds, they're likely moving money from their money holdings to buy these assets. Therefore, the demand for money as an asset would decrease because they prefer holding the other assets. But according to the equation, if interest rates fall, the asset demand for money increases. So there's a conflict here.

I think I need to clarify. The asset demand for money is separate from the transactions demand. The asset demand is about choosing between money and other assets. So when bonds are more attractive (higher expected returns), people hold less money. But if bond yields fall, they become less attractive, so people hold more money.

So if demand for stocks and bonds increases, perhaps their expected returns rise, making them more attractive. So people hold less money as an asset. Or, if demand for bonds increases, their prices rise, and interest rates fall, making money more attractive, so people hold more money.

This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at each option again.

Option C: When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls.

If demand for stocks and bonds increases, it could be due to higher expected returns on those assets. So people prefer to hold more of those assets and less money. So yes, the asset demand for money would fall. Because they're choosing to hold other assets instead.

Wait, but when demand for bonds increases, their price goes up, and the interest rate (on bonds) goes down. Lower interest rates would make money more attractive, increasing the asset demand for money.

So which effect is stronger? I'm getting conflicting possibilities here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because when people buy more stocks and bonds, they need to sell money to do so, thus money demand falls.

Wait, but money isn't sold; money is used to buy the bonds. So when you buy a bond, you're using money, which reduces your money holdings. So the quantity of money you choose to hold (the demand) would decrease because you're allocating more to other assets.

So in that case, option C would be correct.

Now, let me go through the other options again.

Option A: As bond demand increases, interest rates increase. No, bond prices increase, so interest rates fall. So A is wrong.

Option B: If money supply is constant and nominal GDP increases, velocity = GDP/M increases. So B says velocity decreases, which is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option D: During a recession, demand for loanable funds increases. I thought during a recession, firms don't invest much, so demand for loanable funds (which is for investment) decreases. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which statement is true about money and financial markets, let's analyze each option:

**Option A:** "As the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases."  
This is incorrect. When demand for bonds increases, bond prices rise, and since bond prices and interest rates are inversely related, interest rates actually fall. Therefore, this statement is false.

**Option B:** "For a given money supply, if nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money decreases."  
This is also incorrect. Velocity of money is calculated as \( V = \frac{\text{GDP}}{M} \). If the money supply (\( M \)) is constant and nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money (\( V \)) increases, not decreases. Thus, this statement is false.

**Option C:** "When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls."  
This is correct. When demand for stocks and bonds increases, people allocate more of their wealth to these assets and less to money. This reduces the asset demand for money, as money is no longer being held as a preferred asset. Therefore, this statement is true.

**Option D:** "A macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds."  
This is incorrect. During a recession, economic activity slows, and firms are less likely to invest due to reduced demand for their products. As a result, the demand for loanable funds (often used for investment) decreases, not increases. Thus, this statement is false.

After evaluating all options, the correct answer is:

**C**
