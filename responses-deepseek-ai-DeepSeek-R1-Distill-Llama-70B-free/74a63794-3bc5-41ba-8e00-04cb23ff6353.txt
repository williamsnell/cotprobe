Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East–West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective—a new world order—can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.
—President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990
President Bush's "new world order" most directly resembles which of the following?

Options:

A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points
B: The Truman Doctrine
C: The Monroe Doctrine

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options President Bush's "new world order" most directly resembles. Let me start by understanding the context of the speech. 

In this speech from 1990, Bush is talking about a new partnership of nations and a new world order emerging after the Cold War. He mentions that the crisis in the Persian Gulf offers an opportunity for cooperation, moving towards a more secure and just world. So, he's envisioning a period where countries work together, perhaps through the United Nations, to prevent aggression and promote peace.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. Wilson's plan after WWI focused on self-determination, creating the League of Nations, and ending secret treaties. It was about idealism and international cooperation, which sounds similar to Bush's vision of a new order based on cooperation.

B: The Truman Doctrine was about containing communism, providing military and economic aid to countries to prevent them from falling to the Soviets. It's more about the Cold War strategy than a new cooperative world order.

C: The Monroe Doctrine was the U.S. policy in the 19th century to oppose European colonization in the Americas. It's about protecting the Western Hemisphere, not a global cooperative order.

D: Theodore Roosevelt's "Big Stick" diplomacy was about using the threat of military force to achieve foreign policy goals, more about power than cooperation.

E: The Marshall Plan helped rebuild Europe after WWII, economically. It was about preventing the spread of communism and aiding allies, but it's an economic strategy, not a global governance vision.

F: The Roosevelt Corollary was an extension of the Monroe Doctrine, allowing the U.S. to intervene in Latin America. Again, regional and about intervention, not a new world order.

G: The Domino Theory was about the spread of communism, leading to more countries falling, which influenced U.S. involvement in Vietnam. It's a containment strategy, not about global cooperation.

H: Containment policy toward the Soviet Union, as in the Truman Doctrine and overall Cold War strategy, focused on limiting Soviet expansion. Not about a new cooperative world order.

I: Nixon's "Peace with Honor" was about ending the Vietnam War with a negotiated settlement. It's more about ending a specific conflict, not a broader new world order.

So, comparing all these, the Fourteen Points (Option A) were about creating a new international system after a major war, promoting cooperation and preventing future conflicts through collective security, much like what Bush is talking about. Both involve a vision of a more cooperative and peaceful world order, with international institutions playing a key role.

Wait, but wait. The Fourteen Points led to the League of Nations, which failed, but the idea was similar to what Bush is proposing. The new world order after the Cold War would rely more on the United Nations and collective action, as seen in the Gulf War coalition. So yes, the vision is similar to Wilson's idealistic approach.

So I think the correct answer is A.

The speech by President George H.W. Bush envisioning a "new world order" reflects a vision of global cooperation and collective security, particularly in the post-Cold War era. This idea aligns most closely with Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which proposed a framework for international cooperation and the establishment of the League of Nations after World War I. Both concepts emphasize the importance of multilateralism, peace, and justice, aiming to create a more harmonious and secure world order.
