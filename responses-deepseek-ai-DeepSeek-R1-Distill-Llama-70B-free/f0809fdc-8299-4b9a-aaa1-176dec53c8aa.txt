Question:

The frequency of the gene for sickle-cell anemia in American Blacks is less than that found in the people living in their ancestral home in Africa. What factors might account for this difference?

Options:

A: The factors include improved healthcare in America that helps manage sickle-cell anemia, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and similar rates of interracial marriages in Africa and America.
B: The factors include the introduction of a sickle-cell cure in America, the survival of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and the presence of malaria in Africa.
C: The factors include the presence of malaria in both America and Africa, the survival of individuals with the sickle-cell trait, and high levels of interracial marriages in both regions.
D: The factors include selective migration patterns of African people with lower sickle-cell gene frequency to America, the survival advantage of sickle-cell trait carriers in malaria-endemic areas, and the genetic mixing due to interracial marriages in America.
E: The factors include the presence of malaria in Africa, the survival of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and lack of interracial marriages in America.
F: The factors include the absence of malaria in America, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in America diluting the sickle-cell genes.
G: The factors include the presence of malaria in America, the survival of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and lack of interracial marriages in Africa.
H: The factors include the absence of malaria in both regions, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype in Africa, and the promotion of interracial marriages in America.
I: The factors include the absence of malaria in Africa, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in Africa diluting the sickle-cell genes.
J: The factors include a higher rate of genetic mutations in America, the survival of individuals with the sickle-cell trait, and the absence of interracial marriages in Africa.

Okay, so I have this genetics question about sickle-cell anemia frequencies in different populations. Hmm, I remember that sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene. It's more common in certain populations, especially those from areas where malaria is prevalent.

The question is asking why the frequency of the sickle-cell gene is lower in American Blacks compared to their ancestral home in Africa. I think I remember something about natural selection and malaria being a factor. Let's see.

So, in Africa, where malaria is present, the sickle-cell trait (which is being a carrier, like heterozygous) offers some protection against malaria. That means people with the trait have a survival advantage. So in areas with malaria, the frequency of the sickle-cell allele is higher because it's selected for.

But in America, malaria isn't as prevalent. So the advantage of the sickle-cell trait isn't there. Without that selective pressure, the allele might not be as common. Also, in the US, there's probably more interracial marriages, which could dilute the frequency of the allele because people from other populations without the sickle-cell gene are mixing in.

Wait, but what about the homozygous individuals? People who are homozygous recessive (ss) have sickle-cell anemia, which is a severe condition. In Africa, if they have sickle-cell anemia, they might die young, especially without proper medical care. But in America, maybe healthcare is better, so they might survive longer. But that doesn't directly explain the lower gene frequency.

No, wait, the frequency of the gene (allele) in the population is lower in the US. So in Africa, the allele is maintained because carriers have an advantage. Without malaria, in the US, carriers don't have that advantage. Also, maybe the allele is lost due to other factors, like people without the allele having more children.

Another point is migration. If the people who migrated to America had lower frequencies of the sickle-cell allele, that could contribute. But I'm not sure about the migration patterns regarding this specific gene.

So putting it together, the factors are probably the absence of malaria in America (so no selective advantage for carriers), the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell (because they don't survive to reproduce, reducing allele frequency), and interracial marriages which would introduce other alleles, thus diluting the frequency of the sickle-cell allele.

Looking at the options, let me go through them.

Option F says: absence of malaria, death of homozygous, interracial marriages in America. That sounds right. Because without malaria, the carriers don't have an advantage. Those with SS might die, reducing the allele. Interracial marriages would mean more mixing, so the frequency of the allele decreases because people are marrying outside their group, which probably has a lower frequency.

Option D mentions migration patterns with lower frequency. I'm not sure if migration is a key factor here, but maybe. Also, it mentions genetic mixing in America. So possible, but I think F is more direct.

Option F: The factors include the absence of malaria in America, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in America diluting the sickle-cell genes.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be F.

The frequency of the sickle-cell gene is lower in American Blacks compared to their ancestral populations in Africa due to several factors. In Africa, the sickle-cell trait (heterozygous state) confers a survival advantage in malaria-endemic regions, maintaining a higher frequency of the allele. In contrast, in America, the absence of malaria removes this selective advantage. Additionally, individuals with homozygous sickle-cell anemia (ss) often face severe health challenges, reducing their ability to pass on the allele. Furthermore, interracial marriages in America introduce genes from populations with lower sickle-cell allele frequencies, diluting its prevalence. These factors collectively explain the lower frequency of the sickle-cell gene in American Blacks.

The correct answer is:

F: The factors include the absence of malaria in America, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in America diluting the sickle-cell genes.
