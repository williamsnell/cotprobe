Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

A stone is thrown horizontally from a bridge with an initial speed of 10 m/s. They're asking how long it takes for the stone to hit the water, which is 80 meters below the bridge. Oh right, and air resistance is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things.

Hmm, I remember that when objects are thrown horizontally, their horizontal and vertical motions are independent. So the horizontal speed doesn't affect the vertical motion. That makes sense because, in physics, the motions along each axis (x and y) are separate. So even though the stone is moving forward at 10 m/s, its vertical motion starts from rest, I think.

Wait, no, the stone is thrown from a height, so its initial vertical velocity is zero. Right, because when you throw something horizontally, you're only giving it a horizontal velocity. So the vertical motion is just free fall under gravity.

So the problem is really about finding the time it takes for the stone to fall 80 meters downward. The horizontal motion (10 m/s) doesn't affect the time at all. So I can ignore the 10 m/s part when calculating the time.

I remember the equation for displacement under constant acceleration. The equation is:

y = (1/2) * g * t²

Where y is the displacement, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time. Oh wait, I should make sure about the sign. Since it's falling downward, y would be positive if we take downward as positive. Alternatively, if we take upward as positive, y would be negative, but since we're dealing with magnitude here, I think it's easier to just consider the positive value.

So y is 80 meters, g is 9.8 m/s², approximately. Let's plug that in:

80 m = 0.5 * 9.8 m/s² * t²

Wait, let me write that as:

t² = (2 * y) / g

So substituting the numbers:

t² = (2 * 80) / 9.8

Let me compute that. 2*80 is 160. 160 divided by 9.8 is... let's see. 9.8 times 16 is 156.8, because 10 times 16 is 160, so 0.2*16 is 3.2 less, making it 156.8. So 160 /9.8 would be a bit more than 16. Let me compute it exactly.

Wait, 9.8 * 16 = 156.8. So 160-156.8 is 3.2. So 3.2 /9.8 is 0.326 approx. So t² ≈ 16.326, so t is the square root of that. What's the square root of 16.326?

Well, sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(16.326) is a bit more. Let's compute it:

4^2 =16, 4.1^2=16.81. Wait, 4.1^2 is 16.81 which is higher than 16.326. So it must be between 4 and 4.1.

Wait, but wait, 4.0^2=16.0, 4.05^2 is (4 + 0.05)^2 = 16 + 2*4*0.05 + 0.05^2 = 16 + 0.4 + 0.0025=16.4025.

Hmm, 16.326 is between 16.0 and 16.4025, so t is between 4 and 4.05 seconds.

Let me compute 4.0^2 is 16. So 16.326 is 0.326 more than 16. Let's find x where (4 + x)^2 = 16.326.

Expanding, 4^2 + 2*4*x +x² = 16.326. So 16 +8x +x²=16.326. The x² term is negligible for small x, so 8x≈0.326 → x≈0.04075. So t is approximately 4.04075 seconds. So about 4.04 seconds.

Looking at the options, E is 4s, H is 8s, etc. So the closest option is E, 4 seconds. But wait, my calculation gave around 4.04, which is just over 4. So I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let's see the options given:

A:6, B:2, C:7, D:5, E:4, F:1, G:10, H:8, I:9, J:3.

So E is 4 seconds. Hmm, but let me double-check because sometimes approximations can be tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculation. Let's compute t² = (2*80)/9.8 = 160/9.8.

Wait, 160 divided by 9.8. Let me compute 160 /9.8.

Well, 9.8 × 16 = 156.8, as before. So 160 is 3.2 more than 156.8. 3.2 /9.8 is 0.32653... So t²=16.3265. So t is sqrt(16.3265).

Now, to find sqrt(16.3265) accurately. Let's try using the Newton-Raphson method or just linear approximation.

Let me take x=4.04 as before. So 4.04² = ?

4.04 *4.04: 4*4=16, 4*.04*2=0.32, and 0.04²=0.0016. So 16 + 0.32 +0.0016=16.3216. Which is just a bit less than 16.3265.

The difference is 16.3265 -16.3216=0.0049. So each additional 0.001 in x adds approximately 2*4.04*0.001 =0.00808 to x squared. So to get 0.0049, we need 0.0049 /0.00808 ≈ 0.606 of 0.001. So x ≈4.04 + 0.000606≈4.0406.

So t≈4.0406 seconds, which is approximately 4.04 seconds. So about 4.04 seconds.

Hmm, but the options only have E as 4s, which is 4.0. But wait, perhaps the problem assumes g is 10 m/s² for simplicity. Let me check that possibility.

If g is taken as 10 instead of 9.8, then t² would be (2*80)/10 =160/10=16 → t=4 seconds exactly. That would make E the correct answer.

So maybe the question uses g=10 m/s² for simplicity. That would make sense, as often in problems like this, they approximate g as 10 m/s².

So in that case, the time is 4 seconds, which is option E.

To determine how long it takes for the stone to strike the water, we analyze the vertical motion independently of the horizontal motion. The stone is thrown horizontally with an initial vertical velocity of 0 m/s, and its vertical motion is governed by free fall under gravity. The equation for vertical displacement is:

\[
y = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

Here, \( y = 80 \, \text{m} \) (the height of the bridge), \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( t \) is the time to hit the water. Rearranging the equation to solve for \( t \):

\[
t^2 = \frac{2y}{g}
\]

Substituting \( y = 80 \, \text{m} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):

\[
t^2 = \frac{2 \cdot 80}{9.8} = \frac{160}{9.8} \approx 16.3265
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
t \approx \sqrt{16.3265} \approx 4.04 \, \text{seconds}
\]

If we approximate \( g \) as \( 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for simplicity, the calculation becomes:

\[
t^2 = \frac{2 \cdot 80}{10} = 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \sqrt{16} = 4 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the stone to hit the water is approximately **4 seconds**. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**E: 4 s**
