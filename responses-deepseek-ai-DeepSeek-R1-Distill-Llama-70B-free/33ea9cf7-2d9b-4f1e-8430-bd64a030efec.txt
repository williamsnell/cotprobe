Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about calculating the heat added when one mole of carbon dioxide is heated at constant volume from 540°F to 3540°F. The options are in Btu, which I think stands for British Thermal Units.

First, I remember that when dealing with heat transfer at constant volume, the heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) is used. So the formula I need is Q = n * Cv * (T2 - T1). But wait, I have to make sure the temperatures are in the correct units. I think the ideal gas law uses Kelvin, so I'll need to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin or Celsius first because Cv values are usually given in Celsius or Kelvin.

Let me recall how to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula is (°F - 32) * 5/9 = °C. So I'll convert both temperatures.

Starting with T1 = 540°F. So 540 - 32 = 508. Multiply by 5/9: 508 * 5 = 2540, divided by 9 is approximately 282.22°C. Then for T2 = 3540°F: 3540 -32 = 3508, multiplied by 5/9 gives 3508 *5 =17540, divided by 9 is about 1949.89°C. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 3508 *5 is 17540. 17540 divided by 9: 9*1949 is 17541, so it's approximately 1949.44°C. So T2 is about 1949.44°C and T1 is about 282.22°C.

But wait, I'm probably better off converting to Kelvin directly, since Cv might require absolute temperature. Kelvin is Celsius + 273.15. So T1 in K is 282.22 + 273.15 = 555.37 K. T2 is 1949.44 + 273.15 = 2222.59 K. The difference T2-T1 is 2222.59 - 555.37 = 1667.22 K.

Now, I need the Cv for CO2. From what I remember, the molar heat capacity at constant volume for diatomic gases is (5/2)R, but wait, CO2 is a polyatomic gas. Oh right, CO2 is linear triatomic. So for polyatomic gases, the molar Cv is higher. Let me think. For diatomic gases, Cv is (5/2)R, which is about 20.785 J/mol·K. For polyatomic gases, I think Cv is (3)R? Wait, or is it (3n - 2) * (1/2) R? Wait, no. Maybe I should look up the degrees of freedom. Carbon dioxide has 3 translational, 3 rotational (but maybe 2 because it's linear?), and the rest vibrational which might not contribute much at lower temps. But since the problem doesn't specify temperature ranges, I'll go with the standard value.

Wait, I think the molar specific heat at constant volume for CO2 is about 20.76 J/mol·K. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For a linear molecule like CO2, the rotational modes are 2 (since rotation around the axis of the molecule doesn't contribute), so the rotational degrees are 2. So the total degrees of freedom are translational (3) + rotational (2) = 5. So each degree contributes (1/2) R. So Cv = (5/2) R. So that's 5/2 * 8.314 J/mol·K. Let me calculate that: 8.314 * 2.5 = 20.785 J/mol·K.

Wait, but wait another minute. I might be confusing Cv and Cp. Because I know that for diatomic gases, Cp is (7/2) R and Cv is (5/2) R. But for polyatomic gases, like CO2, I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe for CO2, Cv is 20.76 J/mol·K. Let me think about R value. R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So (5/2) R is 20.785 J/mol·K. So that's the value I'll use.

Now, putting it all together. The formula is Q = n * Cv * (T2 - T1). So n is 1 mole. Cv is 20.785 J/mol·K. The temperature difference is approximately 1667.22 K.

So Q = 1 * 20.785 * 1667.22. Let me calculate that. 20.785 * 1667.22. Let's approximate.

20 * 1667.22 is 33,344.4. 0.785 * 1667.22 is about 0.7 * 1667 = 1166.9, and 0.085 * 1667 = approx 141. So total is approx 1166.9 + 141 = 1307.9. So 33,344.4 + 1307.9 = 34,652.3 J. About 34,652 joules.

Wait, but the answer options are in Btu. So I need to convert joules to Btu. 1 Btu is approximately 1055.06 joules. So 34,652 J divided by 1055.06 J/Btu.

Let me calculate that. 34,652 / 1055.06 ≈ let's see. 1055 * 32 = 33,760. 34,652 - 33,760 = 892. So 32 + (892 / 1055.06). 892/1055 ≈ 0.845. So total is approximately 32.845 Btu. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all in the tens of thousands. Wait, wait! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 34,652 J is about 32.8 Btu? But the options are way larger.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, wait a second. Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation. Because 1 Btu is 1055 J, so 34,652 J is 34,652 / 1055 ≈ 32.8 Btu. But the options are like 20,000 to 60,000 Btu. So that's way off. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's retrace. Maybe I got the units wrong. Oh wait, no. Wait, let me double-check the Cv value. Oh! Wait a minute. I think I might have confused J with kJ. Wait, no. Because 20.785 J/mol·K * 1667 K is about 34,652 J. But that's 34.6 kJ. To convert to Btu, 1 Btu is 1055 J, so 34,652 J is 34,652 / 1055 ≈ 32.8 Btu. But that's way smaller than the options given. So something's wrong here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong Cv. Maybe CO2 has a higher Cv. Let me think again. Perhaps for CO2, the molar Cv is around 37 J/mol·K. Because I remember that for some polyatomic gases, the Cv can be higher. Let me check. Oh wait, maybe I should use the specific heat at constant pressure instead? No, because the question is at constant volume, so it's Cv.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the degrees of freedom. Let me think again. CO2 is a linear molecule, so it has 3 translational, 2 rotational (since rotation around the molecular axis doesn't contribute much), and the vibrational modes are considered in higher temperatures. At room temperature, the vibrational modes are not active. So the total degrees of freedom for CO2 are 5 (3 translational + 2 rotational), so Cv = (5/2) R = 20.785 J/mol·K. So that's correct.

Wait, but then the heat is about 34,652 J, which is 32.8 Btu. But the options are in the tens of thousands. So perhaps I have a unit conversion error. Oh wait a minute! Maybe the temperature difference is in Fahrenheit, but I converted to Kelvin. Oh wait, no. Because in the formula, the temperature difference in Kelvin is the same as in Celsius. Because a change of 1 K is the same as a change of 1°C. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the specific heat value. Maybe it's measured in cal/(mol·K) instead of J. Let me think. 1 cal is 4.184 J. So if the Cv is 20.785 cal/(mol·K), that would be much higher in J. Wait, no, that's the opposite. Wait, no: 1 cal is 4.184 J. So if I mistakenly used cal instead of J, that would make a big difference.

Wait, perhaps I should use specific heat in cal? Let me try that. Let me see. So, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, which is about 1.987 cal/mol·K. So Cv in cal would be (5/2) * 1.987 ≈ 4.9675 cal/mol·K.

Then, Q = 1 mole * 4.9675 cal/(mol·K) * 1667.22 K. So that's 4.9675 * 1667.22 ≈ let's compute.

4 * 1667 = 6668, 0.9675 * 1667 ≈ 1613. So total is about 6668 + 1613 = 8281 cal. Now, convert that to Btu. 1 cal is 0.003970 Btu. So 8281 cal * 0.003970 Btu/cal ≈ let's see.

8281 * 0.00397 ≈ 32.88 Btu. So again, same as before, about 32.8 Btu. Still way too low compared to the options.

Hmm. What's wrong here? Let me check the problem statement again. Oh wait! The problem gives the temperatures in Fahrenheit, but when I converted to Celsius, I think I did it correctly. Let me recheck the conversion.

T1 = 540°F to Celsius: (540 -32) *5/9 = 508 *5/9.

508 *5 = 2540. 2540 /9 = approx 282.222°C. Correct.

T2 = 3540°F: (3540-32)*5/9 = 3508*5/9 = 17540/9 ≈ 1949.444°C.

So ΔT in Kelvin is 1949.444 +273.15 - (282.222 +273.15) = 1949.444 -282.222 = 1667.222 K. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the specific heat of CO2 is higher. Maybe I'm using the wrong value. Let me look it up mentally. Oh wait, perhaps the Cv for CO2 is about 37.7 J/mol·K. Because I think that for CO2, the Cv is around there. Let me confirm: I think the molar heat capacity at constant volume for CO2 is approximately 37.7 J/mol·K. So maybe I was wrong earlier.

If that's the case, then Cv = 37.7 J/mol·K.

So Q = 1 * 37.7 * 1667.22 ≈ 37.7 * 1667 ≈ let's compute.

37 * 1667 = 61,679. 0.7 * 1667 ≈ 1,166.9. Total ≈ 62,845.9 J. That's about 62,846 J. Now converting to Btu: 62,846 J / 1055 J/Btu ≈ 59.56 Btu. Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the Cv is in BTU units? No, that doesn't make sense because Cv is in J/mol·K or cal/mol·K.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the specific heat capacity in another way. Maybe I'm using the wrong R value.

Wait, perhaps R is 10.7316 J/mol·K? No, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Alternatively, maybe I should be using a different value for R. Oh wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K when using SI units.

Another thought: maybe the problem expects me to use Fahrenheit temperature difference directly in the formula. But that can't be right because the formula requires the difference to be in Kelvin or Celsius, as K and °C have the same scale for differences. Fahrenheit differences don't directly translate because each degree F is smaller and the scale starts at a different point.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the Cv in imperial units, like Btu per mole per °F or something. Let me think. Because all the options are in Btu, maybe the Cv is given in Btu/(mol·°F) or something.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think. So perhaps the Cv for CO2 is given in Btu/(mol·°F). But I'm not sure about that. Let me see.

I need to find Cv in Btu/(mol·°F). Let me think. Since 1 Btu ≈ 778.169 ft·lbf, but that's probably not useful here.

Alternatively, since 1 J = 0.000947 Btu, perhaps I can convert the Cv from J/(mol·K) to Btu/(mol·K), and then since the temperature difference is in K, but the problem gives Fahrenheit, maybe I have to adjust.

Wait, but I think I'm complicating things. Let me try another approach. Maybe using average specific heat in Btu units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the specific heat of CO2 as 0.047 Btu/(mol·°F). I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 0.45 Btu/(lb·°F). Wait, but that's per pound, not per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should use the molar mass of CO2 to convert from lb to mole. Let me think.

Molar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol, which is 0.08818 lb/mol (since 1 lb is 453.592 g). So if the specific heat is, say, 0.45 Btu/(lb·°F), then per mole it would be 0.45 Btu/(lb·°F) * 0.08818 lb/mol = 0.0396 Btu/(mol·°F).

But I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the specific heat of CO2 in Btu/(mol·°F). Let me think about possible references.

Wait, I remember that for gases, sometimes specific heat is given in Btu/lbm·°F. For CO2, maybe it's around 0.35 Btu/(lb·°F). Let me see. If that's the case, then for one mole, I'd multiply by the molar mass.

CO2 molar mass is 44 g/mol = 0.097 pounds per mole (since 1 lb is 453.592 g, so 453.592 / 1000 = 0.453592 kg/g, so 44 g is 0.044 kg, which is 0.097 lb). So 0.35 Btu/(lb·°F) * 0.097 lb/mol = 0.03395 Btu/(mol·°F).

So if Cv is 0.03395 Btu/(mol·°F), then Q = n*Cv*(T2 - T1). T2 and T1 are in Fahrenheit. T2 = 3540 F, T1=540 F. So delta T is 3540-540=3000 F.

So Q = 1 mole * 0.03395 Btu/(mol·F) * 3000 F = 0.03395 * 3000 = 101.85 Btu. That's way lower than the options. So that can't be right either.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. Maybe I should check if the problem uses the specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) by mistake, but the question says constant volume, so it's definitely Cv.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the problem uses the specific heat in cal/(g·K) and then converts to Btu. Let me try that.

The specific heat of CO2 is about 0.2 cal/(g·K). Molar mass is 44 g/mol. So molar specific heat would be 0.2 *44 = 8.8 cal/(mol·K). Converting to J: 8.8 cal *4.184 J/cal ≈ 36.83 J/mol·K. So using Cv=36.83 J/mol·K.

Then Q = 1 *36.83 *1667.22 ≈ 36.83 *1667 ≈ 61,400 J. Convert to Btu: 61400 /1055 ≈ 58.25 Btu. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the specific heat is higher. I'm seeing some sources that say the Cv for CO2 is approximately 37.7 J/mol·K. Let me try that.

37.7 *1667 ≈ 37.7*1600=60,320 plus 37.7*67≈2529. Total≈62,849 J. To Btu: 62849 /1055≈59.58 Btu. Still too low.

Wait, I'm really stuck. The options are way higher, like 20,000 to 60,000 Btu. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Oh wait! Maybe I forgot to account for kilojoules. Let me check.

Wait, 1 kJ is 947.817 Btu. So if Q is, say, 34,652 J, that's 34.652 kJ. Multiply by 947.817 Btu/kJ: 34.652 * 947.817 ≈ let's see, 30 * 947.8 = 28,434, 4.652*947.8≈4,410. So total ≈ 32,844 Btu. That's about 32,844 Btu, which would correspond to option A:28,500, B:34,650, which is close to 32,844. But none of the options exactly match.

Wait, let me compute 34,652 J to Btu accurately. 34,652 J * (1 Btu/1055.06 J) ≈ 34,652 / 1055.06 ≈ 32.84 Btu
