Question:

The gauge pressure in an automobile tire when measured during the winter at 32°F was 30 pounds per square inch (psi). The same tire was used during the summer, and its temperature rose to 122°F. If we assume that the volume of the tire did not change, and no air leaked out between winter and summer, what is the new pressure as measured on the gauge?

Options:

A: 34.0 psig
B: 50.0 psig
C: 35.5 psig
D: 38.2 psig
E: 40.1 psig
F: 52.9 psig
G: 48.3 psig
H: 44.7 psig
I: 46.5 psig
J: 30 psig

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about tire pressure changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember that pressure and temperature are related somehow, probably through the ideal gas law. Oh wait, right, it's Gay-Lussac's Law maybe? Because that's when volume is constant.

The problem says the tire's gauge pressure was 30 psi in winter at 32°F. Then in summer, the temperature went up to 122°F. The volume didn't change and no air leaked, so the amount of air is the same. I need to find the new pressure.

Wait, temperatures are in Fahrenheit. I think I need to convert them to Celsius or Kelvin because gas laws use absolute temperature. Oh right, Kelvin is better because it's absolute.

So, 32°F to Celsius: I remember the formula is (°F - 32) * 5/9. Let me calculate that. 32-32 is 0, so it's 0°C, which is 273 K. Oh wait, no, 32°F is 0°C, so 32°F is 273.15 K. Wait, no, 0°C is 273.15 K, so 32°F is indeed 0°C. So winter temp is 273 K.

Summer temp is 122°F. Let's convert that. (122 -32) = 90. Multiply by 5/9. 90 *5 = 450, divided by 9 is 50°C. So 50°C is 273 +50 = 323 K.

Wait, wait, 50°C is 323.15 K, right? So winter is 273 K, summer is 323 K.

Gay-Lussac's Law states that P1 / T1 = P2 / T2, when volume is constant. But wait, here we have gauge pressure, not absolute. Oh wait, gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric. So I think in this problem, since it's gauge pressure given, but when using the law, we should use absolute pressure.

Wait, right, because gas laws deal with absolute pressure, not gauge. So I'll need to convert the gauge pressure to absolute pressure first.

Atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, right? So the absolute pressure in winter is 30 psi +14.7 psi = 44.7 psia.

Then, using P1/T1 = P2/T2.

P1 is 44.7 psia, T1 is 273 K.

T2 is 323 K.

So P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1) = 44.7 * (323 /273).

Let me compute that. 323 divided by 273. Let me see, 273 * 1.18 is approximately 323? Because 0.18 *273 is about 49. So 273+49=322, close enough. So 323/273 ≈ 1.183.

So 44.7 * 1.183 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 44.7 *1 =44.7, 44.7 *0.183. 0.1*44.7 is 4.47, 0.08*44.7=3.576, 0.003*44.7=0.134. So 4.47 +3.576=8.046 +0.134=8.18. So total is 44.7 +8.18=52.88 psia.

Wait wait, no, wait. Because P2 is absolute pressure. But the question asks for gauge pressure, which is P2 - atmospheric pressure.

So P2 absolute is approx 52.88 psia. So gauge is 52.88 -14.7 = 38.18 psig.

Looking at the options, option D is 38.2 psig. That's close to my calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers more precisely. Maybe I approximated too much.

Compute 323/273 exactly.

323 ÷ 273. Let me compute:

273 × 1.18 = 273 × 1 + 273 × 0.18 = 273 + 49.14 = 322.14. Which is very close to 323.

So 323/273 ≈ 1.183.

So then, 44.7 * 1.183.

Let me compute it more accurately. 44.7 * 1.183:

Break it down:

44.7 *1 =44.7

44.7 *0.1 =4.47

44.7 *0.08 =3.576

44.7 *0.003 =0.1341

Add all: 44.7 +4.47=49.17; 49.17 +3.576=52.746; +0.1341=52.8801 psia.

So 52.8801 psia.

Subtract 14.7 to get gauge: 52.8801 -14.7=38.1801 psig.

So approximately 38.18 psig. The option D is 38.2 psig. So that should be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we use Gay-Lussac's Law, which states that pressure and temperature are directly proportional when volume is constant:  

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

Here, \(P_1\) and \(T_1\) are the initial pressure and temperature, and \(P_2\) and \(T_2\) are the final pressure and temperature. However, since the problem provides gauge pressure, we must first convert it to absolute pressure by adding atmospheric pressure (\(14.7 \, \text{psi}\)).

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Winter temperature: \(32^\circ \text{F} = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273 \, \text{K}\)
- Summer temperature: \(122^\circ \text{F} = 50^\circ \text{C} = 323 \, \text{K}\)

### Step 2: Convert gauge pressure to absolute pressure
The initial gauge pressure is \(30 \, \text{psig}\). Adding atmospheric pressure:  
\[
P_1 = 30 + 14.7 = 44.7 \, \text{psia}
\]

### Step 3: Apply Gay-Lussac's Law
Using the formula:  
\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substitute the values:  
\[
P_2 = 44.7 \cdot \frac{323}{273}
\]

First, calculate the ratio:  
\[
\frac{323}{273} \approx 1.183
\]

Then, calculate \(P_2\):  
\[
P_2 = 44.7 \cdot 1.183 \approx 52.88 \, \text{psia}
\]

### Step 4: Convert back to gauge pressure
Subtract atmospheric pressure to find the final gauge pressure:  
\[
P_2 = 52.88 - 14.7 = 38.18 \, \text{psig}
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to \(38.18 \, \text{psig}\) is **38.2 psig**, which corresponds to **option D**.
