Okay, so I have this question about radio signal transmission in seawater. The problem gives me some parameters: gamma (γ) is 5 mhos/meter, epsilon_r (ε_r) is 80. I need to find the distance a radio signal can be transmitted at two different frequencies, 25 kcps and 25 mcps. The range is defined as the distance where 90% of the wave amplitude is attenuated.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with wave propagation in media, especially conductive ones like seawater, the concept of skin depth comes into play. Skin depth determines how far into the medium an electromagnetic wave penetrates before its amplitude is significantly reduced.

The skin depth formula is something like δ = sqrt( (2 * η) / (ω * μ) )), but wait, I think another version of it might be using the conductivity. Oh right, another formula I remember is δ = (1/ (ω * sqrt(με))) * sqrt( (1/(σ)) ), but maybe I'm mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, I've heard it expressed as the reciprocal of the square root of (π * μ * σ * f), because skin depth δ is often approximated as δ = (1 / sqrt(π * μ * σ * f)).

Wait, let me think. The general formula for skin depth when the medium is a good conductor is δ = sqrt(2/(ωμσ)), but sometimes factors might change. Alternatively, considering the wave number in a medium, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify.

The wave number k in a medium can be complex, and when the medium is conductive, the wave is attenuated. The attenuation constant α is given by α = (σ)/(2 * ε_r * ε_0 * ω), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another approach: the intrinsic impedance of the medium might come into play here. Oh wait, the skin depth is often given by δ = 1/α, where α is the attenuation constant.

Wait, to get this right, maybe I should start from Maxwell's equations. In a conducting medium, the wave equation includes both the displacement current and the conduction current. For good conductors (like seawater), the conduction current dominates over displacement current, so we can model it using the concept of skin depth.

The skin depth formula is δ = sqrt( (2 * η) / (ω * μ) ), but η is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. Alternatively, since η = sqrt( (jωμ)/(σ + jωε) ), but in the limit where σ >> ωε, which is true for conductors, η simplifies to (1 + j)/sqrt(ω μ σ) ) * (1/σ) sqrt(ω μ σ) / sqrt(2) ). Wait, I might be complicating things here.

Alternatively, I think the formula for skin depth is δ = (1 / (ω * sqrt(μ ε))) ) * sqrt( (1)/(σ) ) ), but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relation involving the frequency.

Wait, another approach: the attenuation per unit distance (in dB) is given by the attenuation constant α, where the power is reduced by 8.686 dB per skin depth. But the question talks about 90% amplitude attenuation, which relates to the power being reduced by (0.9)^2 = 0.81, so a reduction of about 0.19 in power. So the change in power is (P_final / P_initial) = 0.81. Converting that to decibels: 10 * log(0.81) ≈ 10 * (-0.091) ≈ -0.91 dB. Wait, but that's the change in power when the amplitude is reduced by 10% (since 0.9^2 is 0.81). So, the distance required for this attenuation is when the attenuation in dB is about 0.91 dB.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the skin depth approach again. The amplitude of the wave decreases exponentially as e^(-α z), where α is the attenuation constant. For 90% attenuation, the amplitude is 0.1 times the original, so e^(-α z) = 0.1.

Taking natural logs: -α z = ln(0.1) => z = -ln(0.1)/α. Ln(0.1) is approximately -2.3026, so z = 2.3026 / α.

So I need to find α, the attenuation constant. Now, for a conductive medium (like seawater), the propagation constant γ is given by γ = α + jβ. But in a good conductor, α >> β, so γ ≈ α.

Wait, I think the propagation constant γ is sqrt( jωμ (σ + jωε) ) ). Let me compute that. For frequencies where σ >> ω ε, which is likely the case for seawater, we can approximate γ ≈ sqrt( jωμ σ ). But jωμ σ is a complex number. Hmm, when you take the square root of j, you get (1 + j)/sqrt(2), so γ would be (1 + j) * sqrt( (ω μ σ) ) / sqrt(2) ). Therefore, the real part α is sqrt( (ω μ σ) ) / sqrt(2) ), and the imaginary part β is the same.

Wait, is that correct? Let me see. The general expression for γ is sqrt( jωμ (σ + jωε) ) ). If σ >> ω ε, then the term inside the square root is approximately jωμ σ. So,

γ ≈ sqrt( j ω μ σ ) = sqrt( (e^(j π/2)) ω μ σ ) ) = e^(j π/4) sqrt( ω μ σ )

So γ has real and imaginary parts equal to sqrt(ω μ σ / 2). So α = sqrt( (ω μ σ) / 2 ), and β = sqrt( (ω μ σ) / 2 ) as well.

Wait, maybe I should just stick to the skin depth formula. The skin depth δ is the distance where the amplitude falls to 1/e of its initial value. So δ = 1/α. So if I can find δ, then the distance for 90% attenuation (amplitude reduced to 0.1) would be z = δ * ln(10) ≈ 2.3026 δ. Because 1/e is about 0.3679, and 0.1 is e^(-2.3026). So the distance for 0.1 amplitude is 2.3026 times the skin depth.

Wait, let me clarify. Since amplitude falls as e^(-α z), when z = 1/α, amplitude is e^(-1) ≈ 0.3679. So to get to 0.1, we need α z = 2.3026, so z = 2.3026 / α. But since δ = 1/α, z = 2.3026 * δ.

So first, I need to find the skin depth δ for each frequency. Then multiply by 2.3026 to get the distance for 90% attenuation.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the range is the distance at which 90% of the wave amplitude is attenuated. So that's the point where the amplitude is 10% of the original, so 0.1 times. So yes, that would be when e^(-α z) = 0.1, so z = (ln(0.1))/(-α) ) ≈ 2.3026/(α).

But since δ = 1/α, z = 2.3026 * δ.

So I need to compute δ for each frequency, then multiply by 2.3026 to get the range.

Now, the skin depth δ is given by δ = sqrt( (2 * η) / (ω * μ) ), but η is the intrinsic impedance of the medium.

Wait, the intrinsic impedance η of a medium is given by η = sqrt( (μ) / (σ + jωε) ) ). But when σ >> ω ε, which is true for conductors like seawater, this simplifies to η ≈ sqrt( μ / σ ). Since the jωε term is negligible.

Wait, but wait, the formula for skin depth can also be written as δ = (1 / (ω * sqrt(μ ε))) ) * sqrt( (1) / (σ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, another formula for skin depth is δ = (1 / (ω * sqrt(μ ε))) ) * sqrt( (1) / (σ) ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think again. The skin depth formula when the medium is a good conductor is given by δ = (1 / (ω * sqrt(μ ε))) ) * sqrt( (1) / (σ) ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, another formula I remember is δ = sqrt( (2 η) / (ω μ) ), but η for a conductor is approximately η0 * sqrt( (ω ε_r ε_0) / (σ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the skin depth formula in terms of conductivity and frequency. Oh wait, yes! The skin depth in a conductor is given by δ = sqrt( (1) / (π f μ σ) ), where f is the frequency in Hz.

Yes, that's the formula I'm looking for. So δ = 1 / sqrt( π f μ σ ).

Wait, let me confirm the formula. Yes, skin depth δ is given by δ = sqrt( 1/( π f μ σ ) ), where μ is the permeability, σ is the conductivity (in S/m), and f is the frequency in Hz. So that's the correct formula.

Now, let's plug in the values. But wait, what's the permeability μ for seawater? I think for non-magnetic materials, μ is approximately the permeability of free space, μ0 = 4π × 10^-7 H/m.

So, given that, let's write down the formula:

δ = 1 / sqrt( π f μ σ )

So for each frequency, 25 kcps and 25 mcps, which are 25 kHz and 25 MHz.

Wait, 25 kcps is 25,000 Hz, and 25 mcps is 25,000,000 Hz.

So, let's compute δ for each.

First, 25 kHz:

f1 = 25,000 Hz.

σ is given as 5 mhos/meter, so σ = 5 S/m.

μ is μ0 = 4π ×1e-7 H/m.

So,

δ1 = 1 / sqrt( π * 25e3 * (4πe-7) * 5 )

Compute the denominator:

Compute π * 25e3 = 25e3 * 3.1416 ≈ 78540.

Then multiply by 4πe-7: 78540 * 4e-7 * π ≈ 78540 * 4e-7 *3.1416.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, compute the terms inside the square root.

π * f * μ * σ = π * 25e3 * (4πe-7) *5.

Let me compute each part numerically.

π ≈ 3.1416.

So:

3.1416 * 25e3 = 3.1416 * 25000 = 78,540.

Multiply by 4πe-7: 78,540 * (4 * 3.1416e-7) = 78,540 * (1.25664e-6) ≈ 78,540 * 1.25664e-6.

Let me compute that. 78,540 * 1.25664e-6.

Well, 78,540 * 1e-6 = 0.07854.

So 0.07854 *1.25664 ≈ 0.0987.

Then multiply by σ=5: 0.0987 *5 = 0.4935.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 0.4935.

So sqrt(0.4935) ≈ 0.7026.

So δ1 = 1 / 0.7026 ≈ 1.423 meters.

Wait, no. Wait, let's double-check:

Wait, the formula is 1 / sqrt( π f μ σ ), but I think I might have missed a step.

Wait, let me write it again. The term inside the sqrt is π * f * μ * σ.

So:

π * f1 = 3.1416 * 25e3 = 78,540.

μ =4πe-7= 1.2566e-6 H/m.

So, π * f1 * μ = 78,540 * 1.2566e-6.

Compute that: 78,540 * 1.2566e-6.

Let me compute 78,540 *1e-6 = 0.07854. Multiply by 1.2566: 0.07854 *1.2566 ≈ 0.0987.

Then multiply by σ=5: 0.0987 *5 = 0.4935.

So, sqrt(0.4935) ≈ 0.7026.

So δ1 = 1 / 0.7026 ≈ 1.423 meters.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit large. Seawater is a good conductor, so maybe the skin depth is small. Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Another source says skin depth δ is given by δ = sqrt( (1) / (π f μ σ) ). So yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right, but let's compute again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exponents for better accuracy.

Compute π * f1 = 3.1416 * 25e3 = 78,540.

Multiply by μ=4πe-7: 78,540 * 4 * π * 1e-7.

Wait, 4π is approximately 12.566, so 78,540 * 12.566e-7.

Compute 78,540 * 12.566e-7:

78,540 * 12.566 = let's compute 78,540 *12 = 942,480, 78,540 *0.566 ≈ 44,443. So total ≈ 942,480 +44,443= 986,923. Then multiply by 1e-7: 986,923e-7= 0.0986923.

Multiply by σ=5: 0.0986923 *5 ≈ 0.49346.

So sqrt(0.49346) ≈ 0.7026.

So δ1 = 1/0.7026 ≈ 1.423 meters.

Wait, but that's for 25 kHz. Then, for 25 MHz, the skin depth would be much smaller.

Wait, let me compute for 25 MHz.

f2=25e6 Hz.

So, π * f2 =3.1416 *25e6= 78,540,000.

Multiply by μ=4πe-7: 78,540,000 *4πe-7= 78,540,000 * (1.2566e-6) ≈ 78,540,000 *1.2566e-6.

Compute 78,540,000 *1e-6=78.54. Multiply by 1.2566: 78.54 *1.2566 ≈ 98.69.

Multiply by σ=5: 98.69 *5=493.45.

So sqrt(493.45)= about 22.22.

So δ2=1/22.22≈ 0.045 meters, which is 4.5 centimeters.

Wait, but wait, that's for 25 MHz, so 25 mcps. So for 25 kHz, δ1≈1.423 m, and for 25 MHz, δ2≈0.045 m.

Wait, but wait, the numbers seem off. Seawater has high conductivity, so higher frequencies should have smaller skin depths. Which matches our results, as 25 MHz has a much smaller skin depth than 25 kHz.

Now, the range is the distance where the amplitude is 10% of initial, which is z = 2.3026 * δ.

So for 25 kHz, z1=2.3026 * 1.423 ≈ 3.277 meters.

For 25 MHz, z2=2.3026 *0.045 ≈ 0.1036 meters, which is about 10.36 centimeters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 4.5 m for 25kcps and 15 cm for 25mcps.

B:5m for 25mcps and 20 cm for 25kcps.

C:1m for 25kcps and 30cm for 25mcps.

D:3.22 m for both.

E:2.3m for 25kcps and 10 cm for 25mcps.

F:3.22 m for 25mcps and 10 cm for 25kcps.

G:2.5m for 25mcps and 5cm for 25kcps.

H:3.22m for 25kcps and 10 cm for 25mcps.

I:3.22 cm for 25kcps and 10m for 25mcps.

J:10cm for both.

Wait, my calculations gave for 25 kHz, z≈3.277 m, and for 25 MHz, z≈0.1036 m (10.36 cm). So looking at the options, option H says 3.22 m for 25kcps and 10 cm for 25mcps. My numbers are close but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let's recompute the skin depth for 25 kHz.

First, for 25 kHz:

f1=25,000 Hz.

Compute π * f1 * μ * σ.

π=3.14159265.

μ=4πe-7 =4 *3.14159265e-7=1.25663706e-6 H/m.

σ=5 S/m.

So,

pi * f1 =3.14159265 * 25,000 =78539.8235.

Multiply by μ: 78539.8235 *1.25663706e-6.

Let me compute 78539.8235 *1.25663706e-6.

First, 78539.8235 *1.25663706 = let
