Question:

When using the Premack Principle to modify a behavior, the reinforcer is:

Options:

A: a verbal praise or encouragement.
B: a behavior that occurs frequently.
C: a specific reward given after the desired behavior.
D: a stimulus that is artificially created.

G: a behavior that occurs rarely.
H: a negative reinforcement.
I: a punishment that follows the undesired behavior.
J: applied intermittently.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the Premack Principle. I remember that Premack is one of those behavioral principles in psychology, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

So the question is asking about the Premack Principle and what the reinforcer is when using it to modify behavior. The options are A through J, each describing different types of reinforcers or related concepts.

First, I need to recall what the Premack Principle actually states. From what I remember, the Premack Principle involves using a high-probability behavior (something the person does frequently) as a reinforcer for a low-probability behavior (something they don't do as often). So the idea is that if you can get someone to perform a less frequent behavior, you reward them with the opportunity to do a more frequent one.

Wait, so the reinforcer here is the high-frequency behavior itself. For example, a child who loves playing video games (high-frequency) might be allowed to play after they finish their homework (low-frequency). So the playing is the reinforcer.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this idea. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Verbal praise. That's more of a social reinforcer, like a compliment. I don't think that's related to Premack. Premack is more about using a behavior as a reward.

Option B: A behavior that occurs frequently. This sounds right because the Premack Principle uses a high-frequency behavior as the reinforcer. So if the desired behavior is the low-frequency one, the reinforcer would be the frequent one.

Option C: Specific reward given after. That's more like a traditional reinforcer, such as a treat or a token. Premack uses the behavior itself, not a separate reward.

Option D: Artificially created stimulus. Doesn't fit. Premack uses naturally occurring behaviors.

Option E: Generalized conditioned reinforcer. That's more like money, which can be used to get other things. Not the same as Premack.

Option F: Naturally elicits desired behavior. Hmm, maybe. Wait, the Premack reinforcer is a behavior the person wants to do anyway, so it's a natural consequence. But I'm not sure if this option captures that correctly.

Option G: Rarely occurring behavior. No, that's the opposite. The Premack uses high-frequency as the reinforcer.

Option H: Negative reinforcement. That's when you remove an aversive stimulus, which is different.

Option I: Punishment. No, Premack is about reinforcement, not punishment.

Option J: Applied intermittently. That's about schedules of reinforcement, not the type of reinforcer itself.

So, going back, option B says "a behavior that occurs frequently," which aligns with Premack's idea. The high-frequency behavior is used as the reinforcer for the low-frequency one.

Wait, but option F says "a stimulus that naturally elicits the desired behavior." That might be confusing. In Premack, the reinforcer is a behavior, not a stimulus. So I think B is more accurate.

Another angle: The Premack Principle is also known as the "relief procedure." Wait, no, that's another concept. Or maybe "Premack" is about using a high-probability behavior to reinforce a low-probability one. So the reinforcer is the high-frequency behavior, which is option B.

The Premack Principle uses a high-probability behavior (one that occurs frequently) as a reinforcer for a low-probability behavior (one that occurs rarely). The reinforcer in this context is the high-frequency behavior itself, which naturally motivates the individual to perform the desired behavior. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J**: These options describe other concepts related to reinforcement but do not align with the Premack Principle's specific use of a high-frequency behavior as the reinforcer.
- **B**: Correctly identifies the reinforcer as "a behavior that occurs frequently," which directly matches the Premack Principle.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
