Okay, so I'm trying to solve this calculus problem about the changing water level in a bay. Let me try to break it down step by step.

From the question, the water level varies sinusoidally. That makes me think of a sine or cosine function. The problem gives me two specific points: high tide at 8 A.M. with 15 feet, and low tide at 2 P.M. with 3 feet. I need to find how fast the water level was dropping at noon.

Hmm, so the time between high tide and low tide is 6 hours. That probably means the period of the sine function is 12 hours since high tide to low tide is half a period. Wait, no, because from high to low is half a period, right? Because a full period would go high to low and back to high. So if high to low is 6 hours, then the full period is 12 hours. So the period T is 12.

The general form of a sinusoidal function is something like y(t) = A sin(B t + C) + D or y(t) = A cos(B t + C) + D. I need to decide which one to use. Since at t=8 A.M., it's high tide, which is a maximum. For a cosine function, the maximum occurs at t=0. So maybe using a cosine function shifted in time would be easier.

Wait, let's think about the setup. Let me set t=0 at a specific time to make calculations easier. Maybe I'll set t=0 at 8 A.M., so that high tide is at t=0. Then the function would have its maximum at t=0, which fits a cosine function without any phase shift. So y(t) = A cos(B t) + D.

Now, the amplitude is the maximum deviation from the average. The high tide is 15, low is 3. The average water level would be the midpoint between 15 and 3. Let me calculate that. (15 + 3)/2 = 18/2 = 9 feet. So D, the vertical shift, is 9.

The amplitude A is the difference from the average to the max. 15-9=6. So A=6.

Now, the period is 12 hours because from high to low is 6 hours, which is half the period. So period T=12 hours. The formula for the coefficient B is 2π/T. So B = 2π/12 = π/6.

Putting it all together, the function is y(t) = 6 cos(π t /6) + 9.

Wait, but when t=0, it's 8 A.M., right? Then at t=6 hours, it's 2 P.M., which is low tide. Let me check if y(6) is 3.

y(6) = 6 cos(π*6/6) +9 = 6 cos(π) +9 = 6*(-1) +9= -6+9=3. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the problem asks for the rate at which the water level is dropping at noon. Noon is 4 hours after 8 A.M., so t=4.

The rate is the derivative of y with respect to time, dy/dt. So let's find y'(t).

y(t) = 6 cos(π t /6) +9.

dy/dt = -6 * (π/6) sin(π t /6) + 0.

Simplify that: dy/dt = -π sin(π t /6).

At t=4, dy/dt = -π sin( (π*4)/6 ) = -π sin( (2π/3) )

What's sin(2π/3)? That's 60 degrees in radians. Sin(60) is sqrt(3)/2, but wait, 2π/3 is 120 degrees, which is in the second quadrant. Sin is positive there, so sin(2π/3)=sqrt(3)/2.

So dy/dt at t=4 is -π*(sqrt(3)/2) = -π sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but the question is asking how fast the water level is dropping. The negative sign indicates that the level is decreasing. So the rate is the magnitude, right? Or does the question just want the derivative, including the negative?

The problem says, "how fast...was the water level dropping." So dropping would be a negative rate, but when they ask for speed, sometimes they just want the absolute value. But in calculus terms, the derivative would be negative. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, I see option B is π√3, F is π√3/2, and others.

Wait, my calculation gives -π√3/2. Since it's dropping, the rate is negative, but the question asks for how fast it's dropping, so perhaps the answer is the magnitude. So the rate would be π√3/2 ft per hour.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculation. Because it's possible I made an error in the setup.

Wait another thing: Did I model the function correctly with cosine? Because sometimes the phase might matter. Let me think: At t=0, which is 8 A.M., it's high tide, so y(0)=15. So using y(t) = A cos(Bt) + D is correct because cos(0)=1, so y(0)=A + D = 6 +9=15. That's correct.

So the derivative is correct as dy/dt = -(π/6)*6 sin(π t/6) = -π sin(π t/6). At t=4, that's -π sin(4π/6) = -π sin(2π/3)= -π*(sqrt(3)/2). So the rate is negative, which means the level is dropping at (π√3)/2 ft per hour.

Looking at the options, F is π√3/2. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but some might think of modeling with a sine function. Let me quickly check that approach.

If I were to use a sine function, perhaps shifted. Let's say y(t) = A sin(Bt + C) + D. At t=0, y=15. So 15 = A sin(C) + D.

At t=6, y=3. So 3 = A sin(6B + C) + D.

But this could complicate things. Alternatively, to have the maximum at t=0, we can use a negative cosine function. Wait, because cosine starts at max, sine starts at zero. So using a sine function would require a phase shift. For example, y(t) = A sin(Bt + φ) + D. To have maximum at t=0, sin(φ) should be 1, so φ=π/2. Then y(t) = A sin(Bt + π/2) + D.

But that's equivalent to A cos(Bt) + D, which is the same as I had before. So either way, same result.

So yeah, I think F is the correct option.

To solve the problem, we model the water level as a sinusoidal function. Since the water level reaches its maximum (high tide) at \( t = 0 \) (8 A.M.), we use a cosine function of the form:

\[
y(t) = A \cos(Bt) + D
\]

### Step 1: Determine the amplitude and vertical shift
- The high tide is 15 feet, and the low tide is 3 feet. The average water level is the midpoint of these values:
  \[
  D = \frac{15 + 3}{2} = 9 \, \text{feet}.
  \]
- The amplitude \( A \) is the deviation from the average to the maximum:
  \[
  A = 15 - 9 = 6 \, \text{feet}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the period and coefficient \( B \)
- The time between high tide and low tide is 6 hours, which is half the period. Thus, the full period is:
  \[
  T = 12 \, \text{hours}.
  \]
- The coefficient \( B \) is related to the period by:
  \[
  B = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{6}.
  \]

### Step 3: Write the function
Substituting the values, the function becomes:
\[
y(t) = 6 \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{6}\right) + 9.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the derivative
The rate of change of the water level is given by the derivative of \( y(t) \):
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -6 \cdot \frac{\pi}{6} \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{6}\right) = -\pi \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{6}\right).
\]

### Step 5: Evaluate the derivative at noon
Noon corresponds to \( t = 4 \) hours (4 hours after 8 A.M.). Substituting \( t = 4 \) into the derivative:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\pi \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cdot 4}{6}\right) = -\pi \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right).
\]
- The value of \( \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\pi \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Interpret the result
The negative sign indicates that the water level is decreasing. The rate at which the water level is dropping is the magnitude of the derivative:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{2} \, \text{feet per hour}.
\]

### Final Answer
From the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: \( \frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{2} \)**
