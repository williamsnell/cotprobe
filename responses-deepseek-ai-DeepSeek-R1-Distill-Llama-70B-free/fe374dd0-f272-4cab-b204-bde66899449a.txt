Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the variance of a sample of observations: 2, 5, 7, 9, 12. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that variance measures how spread out the numbers are in a dataset. The formula for variance depends on whether we're dealing with a population or a sample. Oh wait, right, in this case, since it's a sample, not the entire population, I should use the sample variance formula. That means dividing by (n-1) instead of n, where n is the number of observations.

So the steps I think are: find the mean of the numbers, then subtract the mean from each number, square those differences, average those squared differences (with that n-1 thing), and that's the variance.

Let me jot down the numbers again: 2, 5, 7, 9, 12. There are 5 numbers here, so n=5.

First, calculate the mean. Mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by n. Let's add them up: 2 + 5 is 7, plus 7 is 14, plus 9 is 23, plus 12 makes 35. So total sum is 35. Mean is 35 divided by 5, which is 7.

Now, each number minus the mean: 

2 - 7 = -5
5 -7 = -2
7-7 = 0
9-7 = 2
12-7=5

Now, square each of those differences:

(-5)^2 =25
(-2)^2=4
0^2=0
2^2=4
5^2=25

Adding those squared differences: 25 +4 is 29, plus 0 is 29, plus4 is 33, plus25 is 58. So total squared differences sum to 58.

Now, since it's a sample, the variance is sum divided by (n-1). n is 5, so 5-1=4. 58 divided by 4 is 14.5. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 14.5. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum of squares. Let's see:

(2-7)^2 = 25
(5-7)^2=4
(7-7)^2=0
(9-7)^2=4
(12-7)^2=25

Adding them: 25+4=29, plus 0 is 29, plus4 is 33, plus25 is 58. That's correct. 58 divided by 4 is indeed 14.5.

But the options given don't include 14.5. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:10.2

B:10.6

C:12.4

D:9.8

E:7.4

F:12.8

G:13.2

H:8.5

I:14.6

J:11.6

Hmm, 14.5 isn't there, but option I is 14.6. That's very close. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum of squares. Let me check each term again.

Wait, 2: (2-7)² is 25, correct.

5: (5-7)²=4, correct.

7: 0, correct.

9: (9-7)²=4, correct.

12: (12-7)=5, squared is 25. Correct.

So 25+4+0+4+25=58. Yes.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the mean? Let me check that. Sum is 2+5=7, +7=14, +9=23, +12=35. 35/5=7. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the population variance, not the sample variance. Because if I use n instead of n-1, that's 58/5=11.6. Oh, wait, that's option J. But the question says it's a sample, so we should use n-1. Hmm, maybe the question is using population variance.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me go through again.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with samples, if it's a sample from a larger population, we use n-1. But in some cases, especially in certain fields, people might still use n. The question says "sample of observations", so I think it should be sample variance, n-1.

But the options don't have 14.5. The closest is I:14.6. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated the sum. Let me compute the sum again.

2,5,7,9,12.

Sum: 2+5=7; 7+7=14; 14+9=23; 23+12=35. Yes, sum is 35. Mean 7.

Squares: (2-7)=25, (5-7)=4, (7-7)=0, (9-7)=4, (12-7)=25. Sum of squares is 58. 58 divided by 4 is 14.5. So variance is 14.5.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is asking for population variance. If I compute that, it's 58/5=11.6, which is option J. But the question says "sample", so I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I did the sum wrong. Let me check each square:

25 +4 is 29, plus 0 is 29, plus4 is 33, plus25 is 58. Yes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial data. Let me check the numbers again. The data is 2,5,7,9,12. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate the mean differently. Let me write each step again.

Numbers: 2,5,7,9,12.

Sum: 2 +5=7; 7+7=14; 14+9=23; 23+12=35. So 35/5=7. Correct.

Wait, maybe the question uses a different method. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula—like maybe it's the square of the mean minus the mean of squares, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another approach: maybe using another formula for variance. The formula can also be written as the average of the squares minus the square of the average.

So, let's compute the squares of each number: 2²=4, 5²=25,7²=49,9²=81,12²=144.

Sum of squares: 4+25=29, +49=78, +81=159, +144=303.

Mean of the squares is 303/5 = 60.6.

Square of the mean is 7²=49.

So variance would be 60.6 -49 =11.6. Which is option J.

Wait, but that's the population variance, because I used n in the denominator. But when using the formula for sample variance, it's sum of squares divided by (n-1) minus (mean squared). Wait, no, that approach is different. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for sample variance using that method would be:

sum of (x_i^2) = 303.

Then, sample variance is [sum(x_i^2) - (sum x_i)^2 /n ] / (n-1).

Wait, let's compute that.

Sum x_i is 35. (35)^2=1225.

Sum(x_i^2)=303.

So, [303 - (1225/5)] / (5-1) = [303 -245]/4 =58/4=14.5.

Which is sample variance. So that's 14.5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the options are using population variance, not sample.

But the question states "variance of the sample", which I think implies it's a sample, so using n-1. But none of the options give 14.5. The closest is I:14.6. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places. Let's see, 58 divided by 4 is 14.5 exactly, so 14.5 isn't an option. But option I is 14.6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares. Let me recalculate the sum of squares:

2²=4

5²=25 → 4+25=29

7²=49 → 29+49=78

9²=81 →78+81=159

12²=144 →159+144=303. Yes, that's correct.

So using the formula [sum x_i² - (sum x_i)^2 /n ] / (n-1) = (303 - 35²/5 ) /4.

35 squared is 1225. 1225/5=245.

303-245=58. 58/4=14.5.

Hmm, so sample variance is 14.5. But the options don't have that, but option I is 14.6, which is very close. Did I do something wrong, or perhaps the question intended population variance?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that sometimes people use n instead of n-1 when they say "sample variance" mistakenly. Let me compute that.

Population variance would be 58/5=11.6, which is option J. So perhaps the question is using that, but the question says it's a sample.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial sum of the numbers. Let me add them again: 2+5=7, 7+7=14, 14+9=23, 23+12=35. Yes, correct.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for standard deviation instead of variance? No, the question says variance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any calculation error elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the numbers were entered wrong. Let me check: the observations are 2,5,7,9,12. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: some sources define sample variance as the unbiased estimator, which uses n-1, but perhaps the question is using a different approach, like n. Or maybe I should check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers were added wrong. Let me sum again: 2+5=7, 7+7=14, 14+9=23, 23+12=35. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question actually provides an option that's 14.5, but looking at the options, I don't see that. So perhaps the intended answer is option I:14.6, but I'm not sure where the 0.1 difference comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in summing the squared differences. Let me recompute the squared differences:

(2-7)= -5 → 25

(5-7)= -2 →4

(7-7)=0 →0

(9-7)=2 →4

(12-7)=5 →25

Sum is 25+4+0+4+25=58. Correct.

So 58/4=14.5. So if the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, which is the population variance.

But the question is about a sample, so perhaps the correct answer isn't there. Alternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not likely.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are from A to J, with I being 14.6. Hmm, 14.5 is not present, but 14.6 is. Could there be a calculation mistake that leads to 14.6?

Wait, maybe the mean is not 7. Let me recalculate the mean.

Sum is 35, divided by 5 is 7. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different approach. For example, some people calculate sample variance as sum of squares divided by n, not n-1. But that's not correct. But let's see what that would give: 58/5=11.6, which is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the formula where you subtract the mean from each term, square, sum, and then divide by n, but that would be population variance, giving 11.6.

But the question says sample, so that's confusing. So perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, but the correct approach for sample variance would give 14.5, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any miscalculations again. Let me compute the squared differences again:

2: (2-7)=-5 →25

5: (5-7)=-2 →4

7: (7-7)=0 →0

9: (9-7)=2 →4

12: (12-7)=5 →25

25+4=29, 29+0=29, 29+4=33, 33+25=58. Yes, correct.

So 58/4=14.5. Sample variance is 14.5, but that's not an option. The closest is 14.6, option I.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula is applied correctly. Oh wait, perhaps the sample variance uses n instead of n-1. But that's not correct—it should be n-1. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the formula for variance where you sum (x_i - mean)^2 and divide by n, not n-1, even for samples, but that's technically incorrect.

In that case, variance would be 58/5=11.6, which is option J. So perhaps the intended answer is J, but I thought the sample variance uses n-1.

Wait, but the options include J as 11.6, which is what I get if I use n=5.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is arising because sometimes in some contexts, people refer to sample variance as using n-1, but perhaps the question is treating it as n. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for population variance, but the wording says "sample".

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try a different approach.

Calculate each (x_i - mean)^2:

2: (2-7)^2=25

5: (5-7)^2=4

7: 0

9:4

12:25

Sum is 25+4+0+4+25=58.

Sample variance: 58/(5-1)=58/4=14.5.

So that's correct. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the question has a typo, or perhaps I misread the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers were 2,5,7,8,12, but the question says 2,5,7,9,12. Let me check.

No, the numbers are correct as given.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula for sample variance is correctly applied. Another thought: sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, so it uses n-1. So 14.5 is correct, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is J, 11.6, but that's population variance.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the sample standard deviation, but the question says variance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the initial sum of the observations.

2+5=7, 7+7=14, 14+9=23, 23+12=35. Correct sum.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Since 14.5 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is I:14.6, but I don't see how to get that number. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mean is calculated differently, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should try calculating it using another method. Like, perhaps using the formula where you compute the squares first and then proceed.

Sum of squares:303.

Mean squared:7^2=49.

So sample variance would be (303 - (35)^2/5 ) / (5-1) = (303 - 1225/5)/4 = (303 -245)/4=58/4=14.5.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different formula where the denominator is n, leading to 11.6, option J. So perhaps the intended answer is J, but the question says sample, which should use n-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo. But given the options, the closest is I:14.6, but I don't see how to get that number.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I added the sum correctly. Let me recompute the sum of squares again:

2^2=4

5^2=25 → 4+25=29

7^2=49 →29+49=78

9^2=81 →78+81=159

12^2=144 →159+144=303.

Yes, correct.

So, I think the correct sample variance is 14.5, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, treating it as population variance. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the variance is 14.6 due to rounding somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps in the initial steps, I should compute more precisely. Let me see:

Mean is 7, correct.

Each squared difference:

(2-7)^2=25

(5-7)^2=4

(7-7)^2=0

(9-7)^2=4

(12-7)^2=25

Sum is 58.

58 divided by 4 equals 14.5.

So no, no rounding issues there.

Hmm, I'm really confused now. Since 14.5 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for population variance, in which case it's 11.6, option J.

Wait, but the question says "sample", so I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for any alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is applied differently. For example, some sources might calculate variance as the sum of squared deviations divided by n, regardless of sample or population. So 58/5=11.6, which is option J.

But I thought that's population variance. So perhaps the question is using
