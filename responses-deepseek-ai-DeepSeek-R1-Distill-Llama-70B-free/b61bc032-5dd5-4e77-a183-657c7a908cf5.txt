Okay, so I've got this problem here about Harry and his commission. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, Harry is paid a 4% commission on all his sales. Hmm, commission usually means a percentage of the sales he makes, right? So if he sells something, he gets a certain percentage of that sale as his earnings.

The question says he sold $2,100 worth of goods last week, and we need to find out what his commission was. So the commission would be 4% of $2,100. 

Wait, how do I calculate that? I think I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 4% as a decimal is 0.04. Then multiply that by the total sales, which is $2,100.

Let me write that down: 0.04 * 2100. Let me do the math. 0.04 times 2000 is 80, because 0.04 * 2000 = 80. And 0.04 times 100 is 4, so adding those together gives 84. So the commission should be $84. 

Looking at the options, option E is $84. So I think that's the correct answer. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. 4% of 2100. Alternatively, I could calculate 10% of 2100, which is 210, and since 4% is about 40% of 10%, maybe that's a different way to think about it. Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe 1% is 21, so 4% would be 21 *4, which is 84. Yeah, that checks out. So definitely $84, which is option E.

Harry's commission is calculated as 4% of $2,100. Converting 4% to a decimal gives 0.04. Multiplying 0.04 by $2,100 equals $84. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: $84

Answer: E
