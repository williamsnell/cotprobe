Okay, so I have this probability problem here about the lifespans of light bulbs from two companies, A and B. The problem says that the lifespans are normally distributed. Company A's bulbs have a mean of 800 hours with a variance of 14400, and company B's have a mean of 850 hours with a variance of 2500. I'm supposed to find the probability that a bulb from company A lasts at least 15 hours longer than one from company B.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with two normal distributions, the difference of their random variables is also normally distributed. So if I subtract Y (company B) from X (company A), the result should be a new normal distribution.

First, let's find the mean and variance of X - Y. The mean of X is 800, and Y is 850. So the mean of X - Y would be 800 - 850, which is -50 hours. Wait, but the question is about X exceeding Y by at least 15 hours, so X - Y >= 15. Hmm, but the mean of X-Y is negative. That might affect the probability.

Next, the variance. Variance of X is 14400, and variance of Y is 2500. Since variances add when you subtract independent variables, the variance of X - Y is 14400 + 2500 = 16900. So the standard deviation would be the square root of 16900, which is 130. Because sqrt(16900) is 130, right?

So now, the distribution of X - Y is N(-50, 16900). But we want P(X - Y >= 15). That's the same as P(Z >= (15 - (-50))/130), where Z is the standard normal variable.

Wait, let me get that formula right. To standardize a normal variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. So (X - Y - mean) / std dev. So for X-Y >=15, it's equivalent to (X-Y - (-50)) >=15 +50? Wait no, that's not right.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The probability we're looking for is P(X - Y >=15). Since X-Y has mean -50 and standard deviation 130, we can write this as P( (X-Y +50)/130 >= (15 +50)/130 ). Because to standardize, you subtract the mean (-50) and divide by std dev (130).

So 15 +50 is 65. So the Z score is 65/130 = 0.5. So P(Z >=0.5). Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, P(Z >=0.5) is the same as 1 - P(Z <=0.5). 

Looking up 0.5 in the standard normal table, I think the value is about 0.6915 for P(Z <=0.5), so 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085. So the probability should be approximately 0.3085.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. I subtracted the means correctly, right? X is 800, Y is 850, so X-Y is -50. Variances add because we're subtracting, so 14400+2500=16900, which is correct. The standard deviation is sqrt(16900)=130, that's right.

The event X-Y >=15 translates to (X-Y) being at least 15. So when converting to Z, it's (15 - (-50))/130? Wait no, the correct formula is (value - mean) / std dev. So for X-Y >=15, the Z score is (15 - (-50)) / 130. Oh wait, no, because the mean of X-Y is -50. So the value is 15, so (15 - (-50)) = 65. Divided by 130 gives 0.5. So Z =0.5.

So P(Z >=0.5) is indeed 1 - Φ(0.5), where Φ is the CDF. And Φ(0.5) is about 0.6915. So 1 - 0.6915 is 0.3085. 

Looking at the options, option D is 0.3085. So that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the lifespans of the bulbs from companies A and B are normally distributed. The length of life of the bulb from company A, \(X\), follows \(N(800, 14400)\), and the length of life of the bulb from company B, \(Y\), follows \(N(850, 2500)\). We are tasked with finding the probability that \(X\) exceeds \(Y\) by at least 15 hours, i.e., \(P(X - Y \geq 15)\).

### Step 1: Distribution of \(X - Y\)
The difference \(X - Y\) is also normally distributed. The mean and variance of \(X - Y\) are calculated as follows:
- Mean: \(E[X - Y] = E[X] - E[Y] = 800 - 850 = -50\).
- Variance: \(\text{Var}(X - Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) = 14400 + 2500 = 16900\).
- Standard deviation: \(\sqrt{16900} = 130\).

Thus, \(X - Y \sim N(-50, 16900)\).

### Step 2: Standardize the Probability
We need to find \(P(X - Y \geq 15)\). To standardize, we use the formula:
\[
P(X - Y \geq 15) = P\left(\frac{X - Y - (-50)}{130} \geq \frac{15 - (-50)}{130}\right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
P\left(Z \geq \frac{15 + 50}{130}\right) = P(Z \geq 0.5),
\]
where \(Z\) is the standard normal variable.

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
From the standard normal distribution table, \(P(Z \leq 0.5) \approx 0.6915\). Therefore:
\[
P(Z \geq 0.5) = 1 - P(Z \leq 0.5) = 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the length of life of the bulb from company A exceeds the length of life of the bulb from company B by at least 15 hours is approximately **0.3085**.
