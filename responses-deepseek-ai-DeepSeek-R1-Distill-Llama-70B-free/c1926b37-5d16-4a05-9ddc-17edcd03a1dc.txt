Okay, so I've got this problem about electric fields and work done when moving a charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the electric field E is given by ya_x + xa_y + 2a_z. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, it's ya_x plus xa_y plus 2a_z. So E is a vector field with components varying in x and y. Interesting.

We need to find the work done in moving a charge of 2 C from point B (1,0,1) to point A (0.8, 0.6, 1) along the shorter arc of the circle defined by x² + y² =1, z=1. So the movement is along a circular path in the z=1 plane.

Wait, first, the path is a circle in the plane z=1, since x² + y² =1. So that's a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin, at height z=1. Points B and A lie on this circle. Point B is at (1,0,1), which is one point on the circle. Point A is (0.8, 0.6,1). Let me check if that's on the circle: 0.8² + 0.6² = 0.64 + 0.36 = 1.0, yes, so it's on the circle.

The path is the shorter arc from B to A. So the angle between these two points as viewed from the center should be less than 180 degrees. Let me think about the angle. Point B is at (1,0), so that's 0 radians. Point A is at (0.8, 0.6). Let me compute the angle theta for point A.

Using tan(theta) = y/x = 0.6/0.8 = 3/4. So theta is arctan(3/4), which is approximately 36.87 degrees. So the angle between them is about 36.87 degrees, which is the shorter arc.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "along the shorter arc of the circle". So the distance along the path is the arc length, which is r * theta, with theta in radians. Since the radius r is 1, the arc length is theta.

So theta is 36.87 degrees, which in radians is about 0.6435 radians.

But wait, the work done by the electric field when moving a charge is given by the line integral of E dot dl from the starting point to the end point. Mathematically, W = integral (E · dl) from B to A.

But electric fields can be conservative, so if E is conservative, the work done would be path-independent and equal to the potential difference times the charge. However, whether E is conservative depends on whether the curl of E is zero.

Wait, let me compute the curl of E. E has components (y, x, 2). So the curl is the determinant of the following matrix:

i (dEz/dy - dEy/dz) - j (dEz/dx - dEx/dz) + k (dEy/dx - dEx/dy)

Computing each component:

dEz/dy = 0 (since Ez=2 is constant), dEy/dz = 0 (Ey=x doesn't depend on z), so the i component is 0 -0=0.

-j (dEz/dx - dEx/dz) → dEz/dx =0, dEx/dz=0, so the j component is 0.

k (dEy/dx - dEx/dy) → dEy/dx = 1 (since Ey=x), dEx/dy =1 (Ex=y). So 1 -1 =0.

Wait, so the curl is zero. That means E is a conservative field. Therefore, the work done in moving a charge in a conservative field is path-independent and depends only on the potential difference between the endpoints.

So then, the work done is W = q (V(A) - V(B)), where V is the electric potential.

But wait, wait a second. Alternatively, because the field is conservative, the work done around any closed loop is zero. So moving along a circular path from B to A and back would require zero work, but we're just going along part of the loop.

But since we're moving along an arc of a circle, perhaps it's easier to compute the work using the line integral, but since it's a conservative field, another approach would be to parameterize the path.

Alternatively, since the work is path-independent, we can choose any path from B to A, perhaps a straight line, but that might complicate things because the field varies with position.

Wait, but another approach: Since E is conservative, the work done is equal to the negative of the change in potential energy. But perhaps it's easier to compute the line integral.

But wait, wait, maybe using Stokes' theorem could help, but since the curl is zero, the integral over any closed loop is zero. But that's probably not directly helpful here.

Wait, no, let's think again. The work done is the integral of E · dl along the path. Since E is conservative, this integral is path-independent, so we can compute it as the difference in potential at A and B. So W = q (V(A) - V(B)).

But how do we find the potential V? Because E is the negative gradient of V. So we can compute V by integrating E · dr, but ensuring that the integration gives a scalar potential.

Wait, let me try to find the potential V such that E = -∇V.

So,

E_x = y = -dV/dx → dV/dx = -y
E_y = x = -dV/dy → dV/dy = -x
E_z = 2 = -dV/dz → dV/dz = -2

Integrate each component.

First, integrate dV/dx = -y → V = -y x + f(y,z) (since integration over x would treat y and z as constants, needing a function of y and z).

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step.

From E_x = y = -dV/dx → dV = -y dx.

Integrate with respect to x: V = -y x + C(y,z), where C is a function of y and z.

Now take the partial derivative of V with respect to y:

dV/dy = -x + dC/dy.

But E_y is x, and E_y = -dV/dy → dV/dy = -x.

So,

- x = (-x) + dC/dy → dC/dy = 0 → C is a function of z only. Let's call it C(z).

Now, consider E_z =2= -dV/dz.

V = -y x + C(z)

dV/dz = dC/dz = -E_z = -2 → C(z) = -2 z + constant.

So putting it all together,

V(x,y,z) = -x y - 2 z + constant.

Since the constant doesn't affect the potential difference, we can set it to zero for simplicity.

So V(x,y,z) = -x y - 2 z.

Now, compute the potential at points A and B.

Point B is (1,0,1):

V_B = - (1)(0) - 2*(1) = 0 - 2 = -2 V.

Point A is (0.8, 0.6, 1):

V_A = - (0.8)(0.6) - 2*(1) = -0.48 - 2 = -2.48 V.

So the potential difference V_A - V_B = (-2.48) - (-2) = -0.48 V.

Wait, but wait, the work done is W = q (V_A - V_B), but wait no, it's actually W = q (V_B - V_A) because work done by the field is q (V_initial - V_final). Hmm, I might get confused here.

Wait, electric potential energy U is q V. The work done by the electric field is equal to the negative change in potential energy: W = -ΔU = - (U_final - U_initial) = q (V_initial - V_final).

Alternatively, since W = integral (E · dl), which equals q (V_initial - V_final).

So V_initial is V_B, V_final is V_A.

So W = q (V_B - V_A) = 2 C * ( (-2) - (-2.48) ) = 2 * (0.48) = 0.96 J.

Wait, that's 0.96 J. Looking at the options, option A is 0.96 J.

But wait, did I compute V correctly? Let me double-check.

V(x,y,z) = -x y - 2 z.

At B (1,0,1):

V_B = -1*0 -2*1 = 0 -2 = -2 V.

At A (0.8, 0.6,1):

V_A = -0.8*0.6 -2*1 = -0.48 -2 = -2.48 V.

So V_B is -2, V_A is -2.48. So V_B - V_A is (-2) - (-2.48) )= 0.48 V.

Multiply by charge 2 C: 0.48 *2 = 0.96 J. So the answer should be 0.96 J, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the work done by the field is W = q (V_i - V_f), or is it W = q (V_f - V_i)? Let me think: when the field does work on the charge, the work is equal to the charge times the potential difference, but with a negative sign because the potential energy change is U = q V.

In moving from point B to A, the work done by the field is W = q (V_B - V_A) = 2*( (-2) - (-2.48) ) = 2*(0.48 ) = 0.96 J.

Alternatively, the work done by an external agent would be positive if moving against the field, but the question says "work expended" which is usually the work done by an external agent. Wait wait, no, the question says "the work expended in carrying 2 C", which is the work done by the agent, so it would be the opposite of the work done by the field.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify.

The work done by the electric field is W_field = integral ( E · dl ) = q (V_initial - V_final).

If the question is asking for the work done by an external agent moving the charge, then it's W_agent = - W_field = q (V_final - V_initial).

Wait, but the problem states: "the work expended in carrying 2 C from B to A". So 'carrying' implies that an external force is doing the work, so it's the work done against the field, which would be the opposite of the work done by the field.

Hmm, so if the work done by the field is 0.96 J, then the work done by the agent is -0.96 J. But in terms of magnitude, it's 0.96 J. But wait, in the problem statement, they might be referring to the work done by the field. Let me check the question again.

The question says: "Determine the work expended in carrying 2 C from B to A..." So "carrying" would imply that it's the work done by the external agent, which is moving the charge, so W_agent = q (V_final - V_initial).

Wait, no. The work done by the electric field is W_field = q (V_initial - V_final).

The work done by the external agent is W_agent = - W_field = q (V_final - V_initial).

So in this case, V_initial is V_B = -2 V, V_final is V_A = -2.48 V.

So W_agent = 2 * ( (-2.48) - (-2) ) = 2 * (-0.48) )= -0.96 J. But work is a scalar, and the negative sign would indicate direction, but in terms of expended work, it's the magnitude.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again. The work done by the electric field is W_field = integral E · dl = q (V_i - V_f). If the charge moves from B to A, then V_i is V_B, V_f is V_A.

So W_field = 2 * ( (-2) - (-2.48) ) = 2 * (0.48) = 0.96 J. So the field does 0.96 J of work. But the problem is asking for the work expended by carrying the charge, which would be the work done by an external force, which is opposite to the field's work. So if the field does positive work, the external work would be negative, but in terms of magnitude, if you're moving the charge against the field, you'd have positive work done.

Wait, but in this case, the charge is moving from B to A. Let me compute the potential difference again. V_B is -2, V_A is -2.48. So V_A is lower than V_B. So the potential decreases as we move from B to A. So the electric field is doing positive work, because the charge moves to a lower potential. Therefore, the work done by the field is positive 0.96 J. But the work done by the external agent would be negative of that, because you're taking the charge in the opposite direction of the field. But wait, no, because the field is doing work on the charge as it moves. If the charge is moving along the field, the field does positive work.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem simply states the work expended in carrying the charge. If the electric field does work W, then the work done by the agent is -W. But when you carry a charge, the work done by you is equal to the work done against the field, which would be positive if the field is opposing the motion.

In this case, since moving from B to A causes the potential to decrease, the field is aiding the motion, so the field does positive work. Therefore, the work done by the external agent would be negative, but in terms of magnitude, it's 0.96 J. However, typically, when someone refers to the work expended, they're talking about the work done by the agent, which would require overcoming the field. But in this scenario, since the field is aiding, the agent doesn't need to do work; the field does the work. So perhaps the answer is 0.96 J, but as work done by the field, which is the case here.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the work expended in carrying 2 C from B to A". So "carrying" could mean that you're moving it regardless of the field's direction, and you're expending energy. So if the field is helping (i.e., direction of E is same as displacement), the work done by the field is positive, and the work done by you is negative, implying you gain energy. But that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the work done by the field is positive, so the work you do is negative. But in terms of the problem, perhaps the work done by the field is considered, or perhaps the problem is simply asking for the magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the line integral directly without worrying about the potential. Let me try that approach.

The path is along the circle x² + y² =1, z=1. So parameterize the path using cylindrical coordinates.

Since z is constant at 1, and x and y lie on the circle. Let me parameterize the path from B (1,0,1) to A (0.8, 0.6,1). The angle for B is 0, and for A is θ where cosθ = 0.8, sinθ = 0.6. So θ is arcsin(0.6), which is approximately 0.6435 radians.

So the parameterization can be:

r(t) = [cos t, sin t, 1], where t goes from 0 to θ (0.6435 radians).

So dr = [-sin t dt, cos t dt, 0].

The electric field E is:

E = y a_x + x a_y + 2 a_z = (sin t) a_x + (cos t) a_y + 2 a_z.

So E · dl = E · dr = (sin t)(-sin t dt) + (cos t)(cos t dt) + 2*0 = (-sin²t + cos²t ) dt.

So the integral becomes:

W = integral (E · dl) from t=0 to t=θ.

Which is ∫ [cos²t - sin²t] dt from 0 to θ.

Wait, cos²t - sin²t is equal to cos(2t), so the integral becomes ∫ cos(2t) dt from 0 to θ.

The integral of cos(2t) dt is (1/2) sin(2t) evaluated from 0 to θ.

So evaluating:

(1/2)[ sin(2θ) - sin(0) ] = (1/2) sin(2θ).

Now, θ is the angle from B to A, which is the angle of point A: since x=0.8 = cosθ, y=0.6 = sinθ, so θ = arctan(0.6/0.8) = arctan(3/4) ≈ 0.6435 radians.

Compute 2θ ≈ 1.287 radians.

Compute sin(2θ) = sin(1.287). Let me calculate this:

1.287 radians is about 73.74 degrees. Sin(73.74°) ≈ 0.96.

So (1/2) * 0.96 = 0.48.

Wait, but wait, the integral gave 0.48, which is the work done per unit charge, since the integral of E · dl is the voltage difference (in joules per coulomb). So for a charge of 2 C, the work done would be 0.48 * 2 = 0.96 J.

So again, we get 0.96 J, which is option A.

So both methods, using potential and using line integral, give the same result. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 0.96 J.
