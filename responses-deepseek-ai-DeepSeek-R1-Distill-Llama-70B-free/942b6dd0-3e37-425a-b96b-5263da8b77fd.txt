Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychology, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a 38-year-old person who's afraid to travel on public transportation. The treatment program uses graduated exposure to traveling by bus, increasing real-life activities across trials. I need to identify which therapy this is.

Hmm, I remember that exposure therapies are commonly used for phobias and anxiety disorders. Let me think about the different techniques. 

Option A is cognitive restructuring. I think that's more about changing thought patterns, like identifying and challenging negative thoughts. So that's probably not it because the question is about actual exposure to the feared situation.

Option B is systematic desensitization. I recall that this involves gradually exposing the person to the feared object or situation in a controlled way. It's often paired with relaxation techniques. For example, creating a hierarchy of fears and starting from the least scary, working up. This seems to fit because the question mentions graduated exposure.

Option C is implosion. Implosion therapy, if I remember correctly, involves prolonged exposure to the feared stimulus without any relaxation techniques. It's more intense. So maybe that's not it unless the question describes a more extreme approach.

Option D is flooding. Flooding is similar to implosion in that it's prolonged exposure, but I think it's when the person is exposed to the most fear-inducing situation right away. So that doesn't involve a gradual approach. The question says "graduated exposure" so this might not be the right choice.

Option E is reinforced practice. I'm not too sure about this one. Reinforced practice might involve using positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors. But I don't see how that directly ties into exposure therapy.

Option F is extinction. Extinction is a behavioral term where a response is reduced by removing the reinforcement. Like in Pavlov's dogs, stopping the food when the bell rings. But how does that apply here? Maybe if the person faces the feared situation without any negative outcome, but I'm not sure if that's called extinction in this context.

Option G is counterconditioning. Counterconditioning involves replacing an unwanted behavior with a new one, often using classical conditioning techniques. It's often part of systematic desensitization, where relaxation is the counterconditioned response. So maybe this is related, but I think systematic desensitization is a broader term that includes counterconditioning.

Option H is aversive conditioning. This is where an unpleasant stimulus is paired with a behavior to reduce it. That doesn't fit here because the treatment is about reducing fear, not inducing discomfort.

Option I is modeling. Modeling involves learning by observing others. While it can be part of some therapies, the question doesn't mention observing someone else, so probably not the answer.

Putting it all together, the question describes a treatment where the person is gradually exposed to the feared situation, starting from less anxiety-provoking to more. This sounds exactly like systematic desensitization. So the answer should be B.

The question describes a treatment program that uses graduated exposure to the feared situation, increasing real-life activities across trials. This approach aligns with systematic desensitization, a therapy that involves gradually exposing the individual to the feared stimulus in a controlled manner, often paired with relaxation techniques. Other options like flooding or implosion involve more intense exposure without a gradual approach, while cognitive restructuring and counterconditioning are either unrelated or components of broader therapies. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: systematic desensitization

Answer: B
