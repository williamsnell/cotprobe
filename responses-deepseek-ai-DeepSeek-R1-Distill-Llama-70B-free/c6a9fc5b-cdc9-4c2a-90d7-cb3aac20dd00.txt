Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because unit conversions can be tricky. Let's see what it's about. The question says a man shipped his car to Israel, and in the US, his car averaged 10 miles per gallon. He wants to compare this to Israeli cars, so he needs to convert miles per gallon to kilometers per liter. Hmm, right, because in most of the world they use kilometers and liters instead of miles and gallons.

Alright, so the task is to convert 10 miles per gallon to kilometers per liter. I remember that miles and gallons are US customary units, while kilometers and liters are metric. I'll need to use conversion factors to switch from one to the other.

First, I think about the relationships between the units. I know that 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 kilometers. And 1 US gallon is about 3.78541 liters. Wait, but wait, when converting miles per gallon to km per liter, I have to be careful with how the units cancel out.

So, miles per gallon is miles/gallon. To get km/liter, I need to convert both miles to km and gallons to liters. Let me think about this step by step.

Let's write it out. Starting with 10 miles/gallon.

I want to convert miles to km. Since 1 mile = 1.60934 km, I can multiply by that factor. So 10 miles/gallon * (1.60934 km/mile) = 16.0934 km per gallon. But wait, that's km per gallon, not km per liter yet.

Now, I have to convert gallons to liters. Since 1 gallon is 3.78541 liters, I can take the km per gallon and divide by the number of liters in a gallon to get km per liter. So, 16.0934 km/gallon divided by 3.78541 liters/gallon.

Let me do the math. 16.0934 divided by 3.78541. Hmm, let me calculate that. Let me approximate this division. 3.78541 times 4 is about 15.14164, which is close to 16.0934. So 4 times 3.78541 is 15.14... So 16.0934 / 3.78541 is approximately 4.25? Wait, no, that can't be right because 3.78541 * 4 is 15.14, so 16.09 is a bit more.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 16.0934 / 3.78541.

Let me approximate:

3.78541 * 4.25 = ?

3.78541 * 4 = 15.14164
3.78541 * 0.25 = 0.9463525
Adding them: 15.14164 + 0.9463525 = 16.088, which is almost exactly 16.0934. So 4.25 is very close.

So 16.0934 km/gallon divided by 3.78541 liters/gallon equals approximately 4.25 km per liter. Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right because I remember that 10 miles per gallon is actually quite poor fuel efficiency, and converting to km per liter should make it a lower number, not a higher one.

Wait, wait. No, wait a minute. When you convert miles per gallon to km per liter, you're actually seeing how many km you can drive per liter of fuel. So a higher number would mean better efficiency, but since 10 miles per gallon is low, the km per liter should be low too. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, no, converting 10 miles per gallon to km per liter. Let me think about the actual numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

So, 10 miles/gallon: first, convert miles to km.

10 miles * 1.60934 km/mile = 16.0934 km.

That's per gallon. So 16.0934 km per gallon.

Now, convert gallons to liters. Since 1 gallon is 3.78541 liters, the number of liters in a gallon is about 3.78541 liters.

So, to get kilometers per liter, you take the km per gallon and divide by liters per gallon.

So, 16.0934 km/gallon / 3.78541 liters/gallon = km per liter.

So, 16.0934 divided by 3.78541 is approximately 4.25 km per liter.

Wait, but that seems high. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing the units. Let me think: 10 miles/gallon is about 10 * 1.6 km is 16 km per gallon. Then, per liter, since a gallon is about 3.8 liters, 16 / 3.8 is about 4.21 km per liter.

Wait, but 4.21 km per liter is the same as saying 4.21 km/l. But that's higher than I expected. Wait, maybe I'm thinking of the inverse. Oh wait, no, wait, higher km per liter is better fuel efficiency. So 4.21 would mean better than average, but 10 miles per gallon is actually quite poor. So this can't be right.

Wait, wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me double-check the conversion factors.

Wait, miles per gallon to km per liter.

The formula is (miles/gallon) * (1.60934 km/mile) / (3.78541 liters/gallon) = km per liter.

So that's (10 * 1.60934) / 3.78541.

Calculating numerator: 10 * 1.60934 = 16.0934.

Divide by 3.78541: 16.0934 / 3.78541 ≈ 4.25 km per liter.

Wait, but that can't be right because 10 miles per gallon is not that efficient. Let me compare to known values. For example, a car that does 40 miles per gallon would be 40 * 1.60934 / 3.78541 ≈ 64.3736 / 3.78541 ≈ 17 km per liter. That seems high, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but if 10 miles/gallon is 4.25 km/l, that seems low. Wait, no, wait: 10 miles per gallon is 10 miles on one gallon. Since a gallon is about 3.8 liters, so 10 miles is about 16 km on 3.8 liters, which would be roughly 4.2 km per liter. Oh wait, that's correct. So 10 miles/gallon is about 4.25 km/l.

Wait, but looking at the options: the options are A:7.2, B:6.5, C:3.7, D:2.8, E:3.0, F:8.1, G:4.16, H:2.2, I:9.4, J:5.3.

Ah, option G is 4.16, which is close to 4.25. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the conversion factors.

Let me use more exact values.

1 mile = exactly 1.609344 kilometers.

1 US gallon = exactly 3.785411784 liters.

So, 10 miles/gallon = 10 * 1.609344 km / 3.785411784 liters.

So, 10 * 1.609344 = 16.09344 km.

Divide by 3.785411784 liters: 16.09344 / 3.785411784 ≈ let's compute this.

Let me do the division step by step.

3.785411784 * 4 = 15.14164714.

16.09344 - 15.14164714 = 0.95179286.

Now, 0.95179286 / 3.785411784 ≈ approx 0.2514.

So total is approximately 4.2514 km/l.

So approximately 4.25 km/l.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.16 km/l. Hmm, that's a bit lower than 4.25. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact formula.

The exact formula is (10 * 1.609344) / 3.785411784.

Let me compute 10 * 1.609344 = 16.09344.

Now, 16.09344 divided by 3.785411784.

Compute 3.785411784 × 4.25 = ?

3.785411784 × 4 = 15.14164714.

3.785411784 × 0.25 = 0.946352946.

Adding them: 15.14164714 + 0.946352946 = 16.088000086.

Which is very close to 16.09344.

So 4.25 gives 3.785411784 ×4.25 ≈16.088, which is just a bit less than 16.09344.

So the exact value is 4.25 + (16.09344 -16.088)/3.785411784.

The difference is 16.09344 -16.088 = 0.00544.

So 0.00544 / 3.785411784 ≈ 0.001437.

So total is approximately 4.25 + 0.001437 = 4.251437.

So about 4.2514 km/l.

Looking at the options, the closest option is G:4.16, but that's still a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should invert something. Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. Let me think again: the formula is (miles/gallon) × (1.609344 km/mile) ÷ (3.785411784 liters/gallon) = km per liter.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the inverse, but no, the question says to convert miles per gallon to km per liter, which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the options are in a different order. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:7.2

B:6.5

C:3.7

D:2.8

E:3.0

F:8.1

G:4.16

H:2.2

I:9.4

J:5.3

So G is 4.16, which is close to 4.25. Hmmm, but perhaps the exact calculation gives a different value. Let me compute it precisely.

Let me compute 10 * 1.609344 = 16.09344.

Divide by 3.785411784.

So 16.09344 ÷ 3.785411784.

Using a calculator approach:

3.785411784 ×4 =15.14164714 → subtract from 16.09344 → remainder 0.95179286.

Now, 0.95179286 ÷ 3.785411784 ≈ 0.2514.

So 4.2514 km/l.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match that. The closest is G:4.16 and J:5.3. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula. Because sometimes, when converting, it's easy to mix up the units. Let me make sure I didn't flip the conversion factors.

Wait, another approach: 1 mile per gallon is equal to 1.60934 km per 3.78541 liters.

So, 1 mile/gallon = 1.60934 km / 3.78541 liters ≈ 0.4244 km per liter.

So, 10 miles/gallon = 10 × 0.4244 ≈ 4.244 km per liter.

So same result as before, about 4.244 km/l.

So again, closest option is G:4.16. But wait, that's not very close. Hmm, maybe the options have rounded differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should use approximate conversion factors, like 1.6 km per mile and 4 liters per gallon, which are easier for mental math.

Let me try that. Using 1.6 km/mile and 4 liters/gallon.

So 10 miles/gallon = 10 * 1.6 km = 16 km per gallon.

Per gallon is 4 liters, so 16 km per 4 liters = 4 km per liter.

So that's 4.0 km/l.

Looking at the options, E is 3.0, G is4.16, so 4.0 isn't an option. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps the exact conversion is 4.16.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the exact calculation gives 4.16 when using more precise factors.

Wait, perhaps using 1.60934 and 3.78541.

So, 10 *1.60934 =16.0934.

16.0934 /3.78541 ≈ 4.251.

Wait, but perhaps the options used a different rounding. Let me see: 4.251 is approximately 4.25, which isn't one of the options. The closest is G:4.16.

Wait, but perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, like using liters per 100 km instead, but no, the question specifically asks for km per liter.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the user made a mistake in the conversion, using 1 gallon as 3.8 liters, but maybe it's 3.79 liters. Let me try that.

16.0934 divided by 3.79.

3.79 ×4 = 15.16 → 16.0934 -15.16=0.9334 left.

0.9334 /3.79 ≈ 0.2464.

So 4.2464, which is about 4.25.

Still, no option matches that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option G is 4.16, which is close but not exact. Perhaps the question expects rounding to one decimal place, so 4.25 would round to 4.3, but that's not present. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done differently.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Let me think differently: perhaps the formula should be (miles/gallon) * (km/mile) * (gallon/liter). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because when you have miles per gallon, to get km per liter, you multiply by km per mile and divide by liters per gallon.

So (10 mi/gal) * (1.60934 km/mi) / (3.78541 L/gal) = 10 * 1.60934 /3.78541 = ?

Which is the same as before, about 4.25.

Wait, maybe the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach: let me compute 10 miles/gallon in km per liter.

10 mi/gal = (10 * 1.60934) / (3.78541) = 16.0934 /3.78541 ≈ 4.25 km/l.

But the options don't have 4.25. So perhaps the closest is option G:4.16.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conversion. Let me verify using an online calculator or formula.

Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can recall that 1 mile per gallon is approximately 0.425 km per liter. So 10 miles/gallon would be 4.25 km/l.

So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the correct answer should be approximately 4.25, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the user mixed up the formula. Let me think: maybe the user used 1.6 km per mile and 4.5 liters per gallon, which would change the calculation.

Wait, 10 miles/gallon *1.6 km/mile =16 km/gallon.

If a gallon is 4.5 liters, then 16 km /4.5 L ≈3.555 km/l, which would be around 3.56, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the user used 1 gallon as 3.8 liters, so 10 *1.6=16, 16/3.8=4.21, which is close to 4.21, which is option G:4.16? No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Compute 16.09344 divided by 3.785411784.

Let me do this division step by step.

3.785411784 ×4 = 15.14164714.

Subtract from 16.09344: 16.09344 -15.14164714=0.95179286.

Now, 0.95179286 divided by 3.785411784.

Let me compute this.

3.785411784 ×0.25=0.946352946.

So 0.25 gives 0.94635, which is slightly less than 0.95179.

The difference is 0.95179 -0.94635=0.00544.

So, 0.25 + (0.00544 /3.785411784).

Compute 0.00544 /3.785411784 ≈0.001437.

So total is 4.25 +0.001437≈4.2514 km/l.

So 4.25 km/l.

Looking again at the options, none of them match exactly. So perhaps the intended answer is G:4.16, but that's about 0.09 km/l lower than the calculated value. That's a significant difference.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the use of approximate conversion factors, like 1.6 km/mile and 3.8 L/gallon.

So, 10 *1.6 =16 km/gallon.

16 km /3.8 L = 4.2105 km/l.

Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4.21 km/l.

But the options don't have that either. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 4.16, which is 0.05 less than 4.21. Maybe the question used a slightly different conversion factor, like 1.609 instead of 1.60934.

Let me try that.

10 *1.609 =16.09 km.

Divide by 3.78541: 16.09 /3.78541≈4.248 km
