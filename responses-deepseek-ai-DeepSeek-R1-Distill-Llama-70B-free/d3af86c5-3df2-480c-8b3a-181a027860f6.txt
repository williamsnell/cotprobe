Okay, so I've got this question about a TV manufacturing firm that lowered the price of their deluxe portable TV. The question is whether this decision was a good one for their revenues and profits. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Alright, let's start by understanding the situation. The original price was $350, and they dropped it to $320. So the price decreased by $30 per unit. The sales went up from 1,000 units per month to 1,080. That's an 8% increase in sales because (1,080-1,000)/1,000 = 0.08 or 8%. 

Wait, but the question is about both revenues and profits. I remember that revenue is just the total income from sales, which is price multiplied by quantity sold. Profit, on the other hand, depends on revenue minus costs. Oh, right, they mentioned that unit production costs didn't change, so I can ignore cost changes. So I need to calculate both revenue before and after, and profit before and after.

Let me compute the revenues first. Before the price change, revenue was 350 * 1000 = $350,000 per month. After the price change, it's 320 * 1080. Let me calculate that. 320 * 1000 is 320,000, and 320 * 80 is 25,600. So total is 320,000 + 25,600 = 345,600. So revenue went from 350,000 to 345,600. That's a decrease of $4,400. Oh wait, so revenue actually went down a bit.

Wait, but the question says the firm aimed to increase both revenues and profits. Hmm. So if the revenue decreased, then maybe the decision wasn't good for revenues. But wait, maybe the profit increased despite lower revenue? Because profit depends on costs as well.

So let's think about profit. Profit is (price - cost) * quantity. But we don't know the cost. Wait, the problem says unit production costs didn't change, but it doesn't give us the exact cost. Hmm, that complicates things because without knowing the cost, I can't compute the exact profit. But perhaps I can reason based on the change in price and quantity.

Wait, maybe I can approach this by looking at the percentage changes. Let me think about elasticity of demand. If the percentage increase in quantity sold is greater than the percentage decrease in price, then revenue increases. But in this case, the price decreased by 30/350 ≈ 8.57%, and quantity increased by 8%. Wait, so 8.57% decrease in price and 8% increase in quantity. So the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price. Wait, no—wait, the formula for elasticity is percentage change in quantity over percentage change in price. So if elasticity is greater than 1, revenue increases when price decreases.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Price elasticity of demand (PED) is (% change in quantity demanded)/(% change in price). If PED is greater than 1, demand is elastic, and a decrease in price leads to an increase in revenue. If PED is less than 1, demand is inelastic, and a decrease in price leads to a decrease in revenue.

So in this case, the price decreased by about 8.57% (30/350), and quantity increased by 8% (80/1000). So the PED is (8%) / (8.57%) ≈ 0.934. So less than 1, which means demand is inelastic. Therefore, when price decreases, revenue decreases. Which matches what I calculated earlier: revenue went down from 350k to 345.6k.

So the firm's revenue actually decreased. But what about profit? Profit depends on both revenue and costs. Since costs per unit didn't change, but the number of units sold increased, the total cost would be 1080 units * cost per unit, whereas before it was 1000 * cost. So the change in profit would be the change in revenue minus change in costs.

Wait, but without knowing the cost, how can we compare? Let's think differently. Let's denote the original profit as (350 - C) * 1000, and the new profit as (320 - C) * 1080. We can compare these two.

So original profit: (350 - C) * 1000
New profit: (320 - C) * 1080

We can compute the difference: (320 - C)*1080 - (350 - C)*1000.

Let's expand this:

= 320*1080 - C*1080 - 350*1000 + C*1000
= (320*1080 - 350*1000) + C*(1000 - 1080)
= (345600 - 350000) + C*(-80)
= (-4400) -80C

So the change in profit is -4400 -80C.

Wait, so for the profit to increase, the change should be positive. So:

-4400 -80C > 0
Which would mean:

-80C > 4400
Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to flip inequality):
80C < -4400
C < -55

Wait, that doesn't make sense because costs can't be negative. So this suggests that the change in profit is negative, meaning profit decreased. Because the change is -4400 -80C. Since C is positive, -80C is negative, so overall it's negative. So profit goes down.

Wait that can't be right because let me check the math again. Let me recompute the difference.

Change in profit = New Profit - Old Profit
= (320 - C) * 1080 - (350 - C) * 1000
= 320*1080 - C*1080 - 350*1000 + C*1000
= (320*1080 - 350*1000) + C*(1000 - 1080)
= (345600 - 350000) + C*(-80)
= (-4400) + (-80C)
= -4400 -80C

So yes, that's correct. Since C is positive, the change is negative. So profit decreased.

Wait, but the question says the firm aimed to increase both revenues and profits. But in reality, both decreased. So the decision was a poor one.

Wait, but what if the cost is lower than a certain value? Let me think. Suppose the cost is so low that (320 - C) is positive and the increased sales make up for it.

Wait no, because the change in profit is negative regardless of the value of C. Because the change is -4400 -80C, which is definitely negative because both terms are negative. So no matter what the cost is, the profit change is negative.

So the decision to lower the price led to a decrease in both revenue and profit. Therefore, the decision was a poor one.

Looking at the options, option A is "The decision was a poor one." So I think that's the correct answer.
</think>

To determine if the decision to lower the price was a good one, we analyze the impact on revenues and profits. The firm reduced the price of the TV from $350 to $320, leading to an increase in sales from 1,000 units to 1,080 units per month. 

### Revenue Analysis:
- **Original Revenue**: \( 350 \times 1000 = 350,000 \) dollars per month.
- **New Revenue**: \( 320 \times 1080 = 345,600 \) dollars per month.
- **Change in Revenue**: \( 345,600 - 350,000 = -4,400 \) dollars, indicating a decrease in revenue.

### Profit Analysis:
Profit is calculated as \( (\text{Price} - \text{Cost}) \times \text{Quantity} \). Let \( C \) represent the unit production cost, which remains constant. The change in profit is given by:

\[
\text{Change in Profit} = (320 - C) \times 1080 - (350 - C) \times 1000
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
= 320 \times 1080 - C \times 1080 - 350 \times 1000 + C \times 1000
= 345,600 - 350,000 - 80C
= -4,400 - 80C
\]

Since \( C \) is positive, the term \( -80C \) is negative, making the overall change in profit negative. Thus, profit decreases regardless of the specific value of \( C \).

### Elasticity of Demand:
The price elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated as:

\[
\text{PED} = \frac{\% \text{Change in Quantity}}{\% \text{Change in Price}} = \frac{8\%}{8.57\%} \approx 0.934
\]

Since PED is less than 1, demand is inelastic. A price decrease leads to a revenue decrease, consistent with the calculations above.

### Conclusion:
The decision to lower the price resulted in both reduced revenues and profits. Therefore, the decision was a poor one.
