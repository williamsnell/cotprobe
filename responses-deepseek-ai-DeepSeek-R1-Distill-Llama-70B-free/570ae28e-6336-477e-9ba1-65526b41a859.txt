Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer in a vertical cylinder. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the cylinder is vertical, outside diameter is 1.0 ft, and it's 2.0 ft long. Steam is condensing on the outer surface, and the surface is maintained at 85°F. The cooling water is inside. I need to find the overall heat transfer coefficient, the total heat transfer rate, and the rate of condensation.

Wait, the saturation temperature is given as 105°F. Oh right, so the steam is condensing on the outside, which means the cylinder is colder than the steam. The temperature difference between the steam and the surface is 105 - 85 = 20°F. That makes sense.

For part a, the overall heat transfer coefficient (U). I remember that for condensation, especially film condensation, the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using certain correlations. Since it's a vertical cylinder, I think the correlation for vertical surfaces applies here. The standard formula for laminar film condensation on a vertical plate is:

h = ( (k^3 * ρ^2 * g * (T_sat - T_s)) / (μ^2 * (T_sat - T_s) * D)) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, the formula is actually:

h = ( (k^3 * ρ^2 * g * (T_sat - T_s)) / (μ^2 * (T_sat - T_s) * L)) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me correct that. The correct formula for the average heat transfer coefficient during film condensation on a vertical plate is:

h = ( (k^3 ρ^2 g (T_sat - T_s)) / (μ^2 L) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but L is the length of the surface, right? Oh wait, no, actually, L is the characteristic length, which for a vertical plate is the height. But in this case, the cylinder is vertical, so maybe the formula is adjusted.

Wait, wait, no. For a vertical cylinder, the formula might be slightly different because the geometry is cylindrical. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to treat it as a vertical plate because the diameter is given, but perhaps the length is the height. Hmm.

Wait, the cylinder's length is 2.0 ft. So for a vertical cylinder, the height would be the length, 2.0 ft. So maybe I can model it as a vertical plate with length L = 2.0 ft, and the diameter is 1.0 ft, which would be the circumference perhaps, but maybe that's not directly relevant.

Let me think about the properties. I need to find the properties of steam at the saturation temperature, which is 105°F. So I should look up the saturated steam properties at 105°F.

Wait, but wait. At 105°F, the saturation pressure is about... Let me think. At 100°C (which is 212°F), the pressure is 1 atm. So 105°F is much lower. Hmm, maybe around 0.4 psia or something? Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps I can approximate. Alternatively, maybe I can use water properties at 105°F.

Wait, but during condensation, the fluid is the condensate, so the properties are those of saturated liquid at 105°F. So I need the thermal conductivity (k), density (ρ), dynamic viscosity (μ), and the specific heat (cp) perhaps? Or maybe just k, ρ, μ, since the formula I'm using doesn't require cp.

So, looking up the properties of water at 105°F (40.56°C). Let me see:

At around 100°F (38°C), the properties are approximately:
- k (thermal conductivity) ≈ 0.38 W/m·K
Wait, but I need to convert units because the problem is in feet, Fahrenheit, etc. Maybe it's better to work in English units.

Wait, maybe I should look for properties in English units. Let me see:

At 100°F, water properties:
- Thermal conductivity, k ≈ 0.38 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F)
Wait, but that's in BTU-inch units. I might need to convert that to BTU-ft units. So 0.38 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F) equals 0.38 * (1/12) BTU·ft/(hr·ft²·°F) ) = 0.0317 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Wait, that seems low. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Maybe it's better to look up exact values, but since I'm just estimating, let me proceed.

Density, ρ, at 100°F is about 60 lbm/ft³.

Viscosity, μ, at 100°F is about 0.0007 lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, because dynamic viscosity for water at around 100°F is roughly 0.0007 lbm/(ft·hr).

Wait, wait, the dynamic viscosity for water at 100°F is about 0.0007 lb·s/ft². Or wait, the unit is lbm/(ft·hr). Let me confirm: 1 poise = 0.000672 lbm/(ft·hr). So if at 100°F, water's viscosity is around 0.7 centipoise, so 0.7 cP = 0.007 poise = 0.00000464 lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 0.0007 lbm/(ft·hr). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact values. Let me try to recall. At 100°F, the viscosity of water is about 1.9 x 10^-5 Pa·s. Since 1 Pa·s = 0.0000001 lbm/(ft·s), so 1.9e-5 Pa·s is 1.9e-5 * 0.0000001 = 1.9e-9 lbm/(ft·s). Wait, that's way too small. Perhaps I should think in terms of lbm/(ft·hr). There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so 1.9e-5 Pa·s = 1.9e-5 kg/(m·s). To convert kg to lbm: 1 kg ≈ 2.2046 lbm. So 1.9e-5 kg/(m·s) = 1.9e-5 * 2.2046 lbm/(m·s). Then, 1 m is 3.28084 ft, so 1.9e-5 * 2.2046 / 3.28084 lbm/(ft·s). Calculating that: 1.9e-5 * 2.2046 ≈ 4.188e-5; divided by 3.28084 is about 1.277e-5 lbm/(ft·s). Multiply by 3600 to get per hour: 1.277e-5 * 3600 ≈ 0.046 lbm/(ft·hr). So μ ≈ 0.046 lbm/(ft·hr). Hmm, that's higher than my previous estimate of 0.0007 lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to get the viscosity in the correct units. Let me look up the value: At 100°F, the dynamic viscosity of water is approximately 0.000696 lbm/(ft·hr). Oh, okay, so μ = 0.000696 lbm/(ft·hr). That makes more sense.

So, putting it all together:

h = [ (k^3 * ρ^2 * g * (T_sat - T_s)) / (μ^2 * L) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, but I'm not sure if the formula is correct for a vertical cylinder versus a vertical plate. Hmm. Alternatively, for a vertical cylinder, the formula might involve the diameter, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the length L is the height of the cylinder, which is 2.0 ft in this case. So I'll proceed with that.

So, plugging in the numbers:

k = 0.38 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F) → Wait, but I need to convert this to BTU·ft/(hr·ft²·°F), so 0.38 /12 = 0.0317 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure. Thermal conductivity k is in BTU/(hr·ft·°F). So if the value is 0.38 in BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F), then to convert inch to foot, divide by 12. So 0.38 /12 = 0.0317 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

So k ≈ 0.0317 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

ρ = 60 lbm/ft³.

g is 32.2 ft/s².

T_sat - T_s = 105°F - 85°F = 20°F.

L = 2.0 ft.

μ = 0.000696 lbm/(ft·hr).

Plugging into the formula:

h = [ ( (0.0317)^3 ) * (60)^2 * 32.2 * 20 ) / ( (0.000696)^2 * 2.0 ) ) ]^(1/4)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator:

(0.0317)^3 = approx (0.0317)^2 = 0.001005, then * 0.0317 → ~0.0000318.

Wait, more accurately: 0.0317^3 = (0.0317)*(0.0317) = 0.00100589, then 0.00100589 * 0.0317 ≈ 0.00003187.

Next, 60^2 = 3600.

So numerator part: 0.00003187 * 3600 = 0.114732.

Multiply by g=32.2: 0.114732 * 32.2 ≈ 3.696.

Multiply by ΔT=20: 3.696 *20 = 73.92.

Now the denominator: (0.000696)^2 = (approx) 0.000000484. Multiply by L=2.0 → 0.000000484 *2 = 0.000000968.

So now the entire fraction is 73.92 / 0.000000968 ≈ 73.92 / 0.000000968.

Let me compute that: 73.92 / 0.000000968 = let's see, 73.92 / 9.68e-7 ≈ 76360.

Wait, more accurately: 73.92 ÷ 0.000000968 = 73.92 / 9.68e-7. Let me compute 73.92 / 9.68e-7.

Well, 73.92 / 0.000000968 = 76360 (approx), because 0.000000968 *76360 ≈ 0.007392, wait, no. Wait, 0.000000968 *76360 = 0.007392, but 0.007392 is much less than 73.92. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. 0.000000968 is 9.68e-7. So 73.92 / 9.68e-7 = (73.92 /9.68 ) * 1e7 ≈ (7.64) * 1e7 = 7.64e7.

Wait, that can't be right because 7.64e7 is 76,400,000. Wait, that seems high. Let me check the numerator and denominator again.

Wait, the numerator was 73.92, denominator 0.000000968, so 73.92 / 0.000000968 = 73,920,000 / 0.968 ≈ 76,400,000.

So the value inside the brackets is approximately 7.64e7.

Then, take the fourth root of 7.64e7.

Fourth root of 7.64e7: Let's compute this.

We can write 7.64e7 as 76,400,000.

Let me compute the fourth root.

Let me compute ln(76,400,000) ≈ ln(7.64e7) = ln(7.64) + 7 ln(10).

ln(7.64) ≈ 2.032, ln(10)=2.302585, so 7 *2.302585≈16.118. So total ≈ 2.032 +16.118=18.15.

So ln(x) = 18.15 → x= e^(18.15/4) = e^4.5375 ≈ 94.3.

Wait, the fourth root of 7.64e7 is approximately 94.3.

Wait, but 94.3^4 = (approx) (90^4) = 65610000, which is 6.56e7, which is lower than 7.64e7. Hmm, so maybe it's a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it exactly.

Compute 94^4: 94^2=8836, 8836^2= (approx) 78,000,000. So 94^4≈78e6, which is close to 76.4e6. So 94^4≈78e6, which is slightly higher than 76.4e6. So perhaps the fourth root is about 93.5.

So h≈93.5 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that's only around 93.5. But looking at the options, the overall heat transfer coefficients are in the hundreds. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the initial formula. Oh wait, the formula I used is for film condensation on a vertical plate. But the problem is about a vertical cylinder. Maybe I should adjust the formula for a cylinder.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Another thought: Maybe I should use the correlation for horizontal cylinders, but wait, it's a vertical cylinder, so that's different.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use the correlation for vertical tubes. The standard correlation for film condensation on a vertical tube is the same as for a vertical plate because the curvature doesn't significantly affect the flow. So perhaps my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but then why am I getting a low value? Let me check the units again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting units. Let me recheck.

k in BTU/(hr·ft·°F): I had 0.0317.

ρ in lbm/ft³: 60.

g in ft/s²: 32.2.

ΔT in °F: 20.

μ in lbm/(ft·hr): 0.000696.

L in ft: 2.0.

So plugging into the formula:

h = [ (k^3 * ρ^2 * g * ΔT) / (μ^2 * L) ) ]^(1/4).

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute numerator: k^3 * ρ^2 * g * ΔT.

k^3 = (0.0317)^3 = 0.0317 * 0.0317 = 0.00100589; 0.00100589 *0.0317 ≈ 0.00003187.

ρ^2 = 60^2 = 3600.

g = 32.2.

ΔT =20.

Multiply all together: 0.00003187 * 3600 = 0.114732; 0.114732 *32.2 ≈3.696; 3.696 *20=73.92.

Denominator: μ^2 * L = (0.000696)^2 *2.0.

(0.000696)^2 = 0.000000484.

Multiply by 2 → 0.000000968.

So the fraction is 73.92 / 0.000000968 = 76360000.

Wait, that's 7.636e7.

Now, take the fourth root of 7.636e7.

As before, I thought it's around 94.3, but let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 94^4: 94^2= 8836; 8836^2 = 78, 095, 296. So 94^4=78,095,296.

Which is 7.8095e7.

But my value is 7.636e7, which is a bit less than 7.8095e7. So the fourth root would be a bit less than 94.

Let me try 93.5^4.

93.5^2 = (93 +0.5)^2 = 93^2 + 2*93*0.5 +0.25 = 8649 +93 +0.25= 8742.25.

Then, 8742.25^2 = ?

Let me compute 8742 *8742 approximately.

But perhaps I can note that 93.5^4 = (93.5^2)^2 = (8742.25)^2.

But exact calculation is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps accept that h is approximately 94 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but the options for U are all over 800, so I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait a minute, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Because I'm calculating h for the condensation side, but the overall heat transfer coefficient U would consider both the condensation and the convection inside the cylinder (cooling water). Oh wait! I think I made a mistake here. The problem asks for the overall heat transfer coefficient U, which includes both the steam condensation and the cooling water inside.

So I only calculated the condensation side's h, but U is the overall coefficient considering both sides.

Ah, right. So the overall U is given by 1/U = 1/h_cond + 1/h_water, where h_water is the convective heat transfer coefficient inside the cylinder (for the cooling water).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the cooling water is inside the cylinder. So the heat is conducted from the steam (condensing on the outside) through the cylinder wall to the cooling water inside.

So the overall U would
