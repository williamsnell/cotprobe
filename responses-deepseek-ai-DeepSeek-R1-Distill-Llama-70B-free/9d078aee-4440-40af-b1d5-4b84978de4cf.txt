Okay, so I have this problem where I need to express the function f(x,y,z) as a product of maxterms. The given function is f(x,y,z) = (z + x)(y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y). Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. I think I remember that maxterms are related to the variables in either direct or complemented form, and that the product of maxterms corresponds to the sum of minterms, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me think again. A maxterm is a sum (logical OR) of all variables in a function, each variable being either in its normal or complemented form. For example, in a three-variable system, a maxterm would look like (x + y + z) or (x' + y + z'), etc. Each maxterm corresponds to the complement of a minterm.

So, to express a function as a product of maxterms, I need to find all the maxterms that are included in the function. Each maxterm represents a row in the truth table where the function is 1.

Wait, but wait. The function given is a product of sums, so it's in the sum-of-products form, also known as the canonical sum form. But the question is about expressing it as a product of maxterms, which is the canonical product form. So I need to convert the sum-of-products into the product-of-maxterms form.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first construct the truth table for the given function and then identify the maxterms where the function is 1.

Let me try that approach.

So, the function is f(x,y,z) = (z + x)(y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because each of those terms is a sum, and when you multiply them, you're looking for when all those sums are true. So the function f is 1 only when all those sums are 1.

Alternatively, maybe I should expand the function step by step to get it in sum-of-products form and then see which minterms are present. But that might get complicated because there are multiple terms being multiplied.

Let me think: the function is f(x,y,z) = (z+x)(y+z)(x+y+z)(x+y).

Wait, but that's a product of four sums, each involving different combinations of x, y, z. This seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the truth table by evaluating f for all possible combinations of x, y, z (each being 0 or 1) and then see where f is 1. Then, for each of those cases, determine the corresponding maxterm.

So, let's list all 8 possible combinations of x, y, z.

x | y | z | (z+x) | (y+z) | (x+y+z) | (x+y) | f(x,y,z)
---|---|---|-------|-------|---------|-------|---------
0 | 0 | 0 | 0+0=0 | 0+0=0 | 0+0+0=0 | 0+0=0 | 0*0*0*0=0
0 | 0 | 1 | 1+0=1 | 0+1=1 | 0+0+1=1 | 0+0=0 | 1*1*1*0=0
0 | 1 | 0 | 0+0=0 | 1+0=1 | 0+1+0=1 | 0+1=1 | 0*1*1*1=0
0 | 1 | 1 | 1+0=1 | 1+1=1 | 0+1+1=1 | 0+1=1 | 1*1*1*1=1
1 | 0 | 0 | 0+1=1 | 0+0=0 | 1+0+0=1 | 1+0=1 | 1*0*1*1=0
1 | 0 | 1 | 1+1=1 | 0+1=1 | 1+0+1=1 | 1+0=1 | 1*1*1*1=1
1 | 1 | 0 | 0+1=1 | 1+0=1 | 1+1+0=1 | 1+1=1 | 1*1*1*1=1
1 | 1 | 1 | 1+1=1 | 1+1=1 | 1+1+1=1 | 1+1=1 | 1*1*1*1=1

Wait, let me compute each step carefully.

Row 1: x=0, y=0, z=0
(z +x) = 0+0 = 0
(y +z) = 0+0 = 0
(x+y+z) = 0+0+0=0
(x+y) = 0+0=0
f = 0*0*0*0=0

Row 2: x=0,y=0,z=1
(z+x)=1+0=1
(y+z)=0+1=1
(x+y+z)=0+0+1=1
(x+y)=0+0=0
f=1*1*1*0=0

Row3: x=0,y=1,z=0
(z+x)=0+0=0
(y+z)=1+0=1
(x+y+z)=0+1+0=1
(x+y)=0+1=1
f=0*1*1*1=0

Row4: x=0,y=1,z=1
(z+x)=1+0=1
(y+z)=1+1=1 (but wait, (y+z)=1 OR 1, which is 1)
(x+y+z)=0+1+1=1
(x+y)=0+1=1
f=1*1*1*1=1

Row5: x=1,y=0,z=0
(z+x)=0+1=1
(y+z)=0+0=0
(x+y+z)=1+0+0=1
(x+y)=1+0=1
f=1*0*1*1=0

Row6: x=1,y=0,z=1
(z+x)=1+1=1
(y+z)=0+1=1
(x+y+z)=1+0+1=1
(x+y)=1+0=1
f=1*1*1*1=1

Row7: x=1,y=1,z=0
(z+x)=0+1=1
(y+z)=1+0=1
(x+y+z)=1+1+0=1
(x+y)=1+1=1
f=1*1*1*1=1

Row8: x=1,y=1,z=1
All terms are 1, so f=1.

So, looking at the f column, function f is 1 in rows 4,6,7,8. So the minterms where f is 1 are:

Row4: x=0,y=1,z=1 → minterm is x'y z (but wait, minterms are products of variables in direct or complemented form. So minterm for this row is x' y z.

Row6: x=1,y=0,z=1 → minterm x y' z.

Row7: x=1,y=1,z=0 → minterm x y z'.

Row8: x=1,y=1,z=1 → minterm x y z.

Wait, but actually, minterms are the product terms where each variable is either present or complemented. For a function f(x,y,z), the minterm for row (x,y,z) = (a,b,c) is (x')^a (y')^b (z')^c. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the minterm for a specific (x,y,z) combination is x^{a} y^{b} z^{c}, where a, b, c are 0 or 1. So for example, if (x,y,z) is (0,1,1), then the minterm would be x' y z, because x is 0 (so x'), y is 1 (so y), z is 1 (so z).

So the function f is 1 for the following minterms:

Row4: x=0,y=1,z=1 → minterm x' y z

Row6: x=1,y=0,z=1 → minterm x y' z

Row7: x=1,y=1,z=0 → minterm x y z'

Row8: x=1,y=1,z=1 → minterm x y z

Wait, but wait, in standard minterm notation, each minterm is a product term where each variable is either present (uncomplemented) or complemented. The minterm for a given row is 1 only when the variables match exactly. So, for each row where f is 1, the function can be expressed as the sum (logical OR) of these minterms.

But the question is about expressing f as a product of maxterms. So each maxterm is a sum (OR) of variables. The product of maxterms gives the function f.

But how do I convert minterms into maxterms? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the product of maxterms corresponds to the function's complement expressed as a sum of minterms. Because maxterms are the OR of variables, and the product would correspond to the AND of these ORs. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that each maxterm is the complement of a minterm.

Wait, here's a better approach. The function can be expressed as a product of maxterms, each of which is the OR of all variables in either direct or complemented form. Each maxterm corresponds to a row where the function is 0. Because the product of maxterms will be 0 only when any of the maxterms is 0. So, the function f can be written as the product of all maxterms except those corresponding to the rows where f is 1.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think: The product of maxterms would be 1 only when all the maxterms are 1. Each maxterm is 1 except for one specific combination where it's 0. So the product of maxterms is 1 only when none of the maxterms are 0, which happens only when the input doesn't match any of the maxterm's 0 case. So the product of maxterms gives a function that is 1 only when the input is not in any of the cases where each maxterm is 0.

Wait, that's a bit confusing, but I think the correct approach is to find all the maxterms where f is 0, then take their product. Because when f is 0, at least one of the maxterms (corresponding to that input) is 0, making the whole product 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the function f can be expressed as the product of maxterms, each of which is 1 except for one combination where it's 0. So to have f(x,y,z) = product of maxterms, each maxterm would be 0 for a specific input where f is 0. So, for each input where f is 0, we need a maxterm that is 0 for that input. Thus, the product will be 0 for those inputs where any of the maxterms is 0, i.e., where f is 0. And the product will be 1 only where all maxterms are 1, i.e., where f is 1.

Wait, but in our truth table, the function f is 1 in four cases: rows 4,6,7,8. So the product of maxterms should correspond to those four cases where all maxterms are 1.

So, the maxterms we include in the product should be such that their corresponding 0 cases (the inputs where the maxterm is 0) cover all the cases where f is 0. Because when any of those maxterms is 0, the product becomes 0, which is correct because f is 0 in those cases.

So, to find the maxterms, we need to list all the rows where f is 0 and create a maxterm for each such row.

Looking back at the truth table, the function f is 0 in the following rows:

Row1: 0,0,0 → f=0

Row2:0,0,1 → f=0

Row3:0,1,0 → f=0

Row5:1,0,0 → f=0

So there are four cases where f is 0. For each of these, we need a maxterm that is 0 for that input.

Each maxterm is the OR of variables in either direct or complemented form. So for each of these four cases, we construct a maxterm that is 0 only for that input.

For example, take row1: x=0,y=0,z=0.

The maxterm that is 0 only when x=0,y=0,z=0 is (x' + y' + z').

Wait, no. Wait, a maxterm is a sum (OR) of the variables or their complements. The maxterm for a given row (a,b,c) would be (x)^a' (y)^b' (z)^c', but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Let me think differently.

Each maxterm is 0 for exactly one (x,y,z) combination, which is when all the literals in the maxterm are 0. So, for a given (x,y,z) = (a,b,c), the maxterm would be (x^a' + y^b' + z^c'). So if the input is (a,b,c), each variable in the maxterm is the complement of a, so each term is 0, making the sum 0. For any other input, at least one term in the maxterm is 1, so the sum is 1.

So, for each row where f is 0, we create a maxterm as follows.

Row1: x=0,y=0,z=0 → maxterm is (x' + y' + z') → because each variable is complemented, so when x=0, y=0, z=0, each term is 1 (since x' is 1 when x=0, etc.), wait no. Wait, wait, no, no. Wait, if x=0, then x' is 1; in the maxterm (x' + y' + z'), for x=0,y=0,z=0, each term is 1, so the sum is 1, which is incorrect because I want the maxterm to be 0 for this input.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify.

The maxterm should be 0 only for the specific (x,y,z) = (a,b,c). So the maxterm would be (x^(a') + y^(b') + z^(c')), where a', b', c' are the complements. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the maxterm being the OR of the variables in the form where they are complemented if the variable is 0 in that row.

Wait, perhaps the maxterm for a given (x,y,z) = (a,b,c) is (x^(NOT a) + y^(NOT b) + z^(NOT c)). Wait, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, the maxterm is constructed such that it's 0 only when x = a, y = b, z = c. So, for each variable in the maxterm, if the variable is 0 in that row, we include its complement; if it's 1, we include the variable itself.

So, for Row1: (0,0,0), the maxterm would be (x' + y' + z'). Because when x=0, y=0, z=0, each term is 1, so the sum is 1. Wait, that can't be, because I want the maxterm to be 0 in that case. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, no. Wait, the maxterm is a sum (OR) that is 0 only when all variables are 0 in their respective forms. So, to make the maxterm 0 for a specific (x,y,z) (a,b,c), each term in the sum must be 0. That requires each term in the sum to be the complement of the variable's value. So, for x=a, to have x's term be 0, if a is 0, the term would be x (since x=0 → x=0), but wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me take a simple example. Let's say I have a maxterm M = x + y' + z. When is this maxterm 0? It's 0 only when x=0, y=1, z=0. Because in that case, x is 0, y' is 0 (since y=1), and z is 0. So the sum is 0+0+0=0. So the maxterm M is 0 only when (x,y,z) = (0,1,0).

So, the maxterm that is 0 for (0,1,0) is x + y' + z.

Similarly, for (0,0,0), the maxterm would be x' + y' + z', because when x=0, x' is 1; but wait, that would make the sum 1+1+1=1. That's not right. Wait, that can't be, because I want the sum to be 0 only when x=0, y=0, z=0.

Wait, perhaps the correct maxterm for (0,0,0) is x' + y' + z'? No, because when x=0, x' is 1, so the sum can't be 0.

Wait a minute, I think I'm getting this all wrong. Let me find a better approach.

The maxterm is a sum (OR) of variables or their complements. For each maxterm, there is exactly one combination of variables that makes the sum 0. That happens when all the terms in the sum are 0. Each term is either a variable or its complement. So, for a maxterm to be 0 at (a,b,c), each term in the maxterm must evaluate to 0 at that point.

So, for
