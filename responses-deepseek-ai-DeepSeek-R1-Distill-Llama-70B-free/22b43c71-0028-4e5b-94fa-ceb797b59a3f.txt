Okay, so I have this problem where AlforsMotors is buying some cars. The list price is $6,238.42, and there's a chain discount of 11%, 4%, and 21%. I need to figure out what AlforsMotors will pay for each car after applying these discounts.

Hmm, chain discounts are a bit tricky. I remember that when you have multiple discounts, you don't just add them up. Instead, each discount is applied one after the other. So the first discount is applied to the original price, then the second discount is applied to the new price after the first discount, and so on.

Let me think about the steps. The list price is $6,238.42. The first discount is 11%. So I'll calculate 11% of 6,238.42 and subtract it from the list price. Then, take the result and apply the 4% discount. Finally, apply the 21% discount to that new amount.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think there's a formula for chain discounts where you multiply the complements of each discount rate. Oh right! The formula is: Final Price = Original Price × (1 - d1) × (1 - d2) × ... where d1, d2, etc., are the discount rates expressed as decimals.

So, the discounts here are 11%, 4%, and 21%. Let me convert those percentages to decimals: 0.11, 0.04, and 0.21.

So the calculation would be:

Final Price = 6,238.42 × (1 - 0.11) × (1 - 0.04) × (1 - 0.21)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 1 - 0.11 = 0.89.

Second, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

Third, 1 - 0.21 = 0.79.

So now, multiply these three factors together with the original price.

Let me compute 0.89 × 0.96 first. 0.89 * 0.96: Hmm, 0.8 * 0.9 is 0.72, and there's more to it. Let me calculate it properly. 0.89 × 0.96:

89 * 96 = ?

Let me compute 89*96. 89 * 90 is 8010, and 89*6 is 534. So 8010 + 534 = 8544. Then, since we're dealing with decimals, two decimal places each, so four in total. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.89 is two decimals, 0.96 is two decimals, so their product is four decimal places? Or do I just multiply as whole numbers and then adjust decimals.

Alternatively, 0.89 × 0.96. Let me think in another way. 0.9 * 0.96 is 0.864, but since it's 0.89, which is 0.01 less than 0.90, so subtract 0.01 * 0.96 = 0.0096. So 0.864 - 0.0096 = 0.8544.

So 0.89 × 0.96 = 0.8544.

Now, multiply that by 0.79.

So 0.8544 × 0.79.

Let me compute that. 0.8544 * 0.7 is 0.59788. 0.8544 * 0.09 is 0.076896. Adding them together: 0.59788 + 0.076896 = 0.674776.

So the combined discount factor is 0.674776.

Now, multiply this by the original price: 6,238.42 × 0.674776.

Hmm, that might be a bit complex. Let me compute it step by step.

First, let's approximate. 6,238.42 × 0.6 is 3,743.05. 0.07 is 438. 0.004776 is about 30. So adding those, 3,743 + 438 = 4,181, plus 30 is 4,211, but this is a rough estimate.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate it accurately.

6,238.42 × 0.674776.

Let me compute 6,238.42 × 0.6 = 3,743.052.

6,238.42 × 0.07 = 436.689.

6,238.42 × 0.004776: Let's compute this.

0.004776 is approximately 0.004 + 0.000776.

So 6,238.42 × 0.004 = 24.95368.

6,238.42 × 0.000776: Let's see, 6,238.42 × 0.0007 = 4.367094.

6,238.42 × 0.000076 = approx 0.4746.

So 4.367094 + 0.4746 ≈ 4.8417.

So 24.95368 + 4.8417 ≈ 29.79538.

So adding all parts: 3,743.052 + 436.689 = 4,179.741, plus 29.79538 = 4,209.536.

So approximately $4,209.54.

But let me check using a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 6,238.42 × 0.674776.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the exact multiplication:

Calculate 6,238.42 × 0.674776.

Multiply 6,238.42 by 674776, then adjust the decimal point. But that's probably too tedious. Alternatively, perhaps use another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the discounts step by step.

First discount: 11% off.

So 11% of 6,238.42 is 0.11 × 6,238.42 = ?

0.1 × 6,238.42 is 623.842, and 0.01 × 6,238.42 is 62.3842. So 623.842 + 62.3842 = 686.2262.

So subtract that from 6,238.42: 6,238.42 - 686.2262 = 5,552.1938.

So after the first discount, the price is approximately $5,552.19.

Now apply the second discount of 4%.

4% of 5,552.19 is 0.04 × 5,552.19 = ?

5,552.19 × 0.04 = 222.0876.

Subtract that: 5,552.19 - 222.0876 = 5,330.1024.

So after the second discount, the price is $5,330.10.

Now apply the third discount of 21%.

21% of 5,330.10 is 0.21 × 5,330.10 = ?

Calculating that: 5,330.10 × 0.2 = 1,066.02, and 5,330.10 × 0.01 = 53.301. So total is 1,066.02 + 53.301 = 1,119.321.

Subtract that from 5,330.10: 5,330.10 - 1,119.321 = 4,210.779.

So the final price is approximately $4,210.78.

Looking at the options, option D is $4,210.78. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the price AlforsMotors will pay for each car after applying the chain discount of 11%, 4%, and 21%, we use the formula for chain discounts:

\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - d_1) \times (1 - d_2) \times (1 - d_3)
\]

Where:
- \( d_1 = 0.11 \) (11% discount),
- \( d_2 = 0.04 \) (4% discount),
- \( d_3 = 0.21 \) (21% discount),
- Original Price = \$6,238.42.

### Step 1: Apply the first discount (11%)
\[
\text{Price after 11% discount} = 6,238.42 \times (1 - 0.11) = 6,238.42 \times 0.89 = 5,552.19
\]

### Step 2: Apply the second discount (4%)
\[
\text{Price after 4% discount} = 5,552.19 \times (1 - 0.04) = 5,552.19 \times 0.96 = 5,330.10
\]

### Step 3: Apply the third discount (21%)
\[
\text{Price after 21% discount} = 5,330.10 \times (1 - 0.21) = 5,330.10 \times 0.79 = 4,210.78
\]

### Final Calculation:
After applying all three discounts sequentially, the final price AlforsMotors will pay for each car is **\$4,210.78**.

### Correct Option:
D: \$4,210.78
