Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The equation given is 14 multiplied by 3 equals 42, so 14 × 3 = 42. The question is asking which statement correctly interprets this expression. The options are from A to I.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a multiplication problem like this, you can interpret it in terms of groups. So, 14 times 3 means you have 14 groups of 3 items each, and that gives you 42 in total. Alternatively, it could mean that 3 groups of 14 items make 42. Both ways, the product is 42.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly describes this relationship. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says, "14 is the quotient of 42 and 3." Wait, quotient means the result of division. So if I divide 42 by 3, that gives me 14. Oh, right, because 42 ÷ 3 equals 14. So A is saying that 14 is the result when you divide 42 by 3. That's correct, but does it interpret the original equation correctly? The original equation is a multiplication, not a division, so I'm not sure if A is the best answer here.

Option B: "42 is 14 more than 3." That doesn't make sense because 14 plus 3 is 17, not 42. So B is wrong.

Option C: "3 is the product of 14 and 42." Well, product means the result of multiplication. 14 multiplied by 42 is way more than 3, like 588. So C is incorrect.

Option D: "14 is 3 times as many as 42." Wait, that can't be right. If something is 3 times as many as another, the first should be bigger. But 14 is smaller than 42, so D doesn't make sense.

Option E: "14 is 3 more than 42." No, because 42 plus 3 is 45. So that's not right either.

Option F: "42 is 3 times as many as 14." Let's see, 3 times 14 is 42. So yes, 42 is three times 14. That makes sense. So F looks correct.

Option G: "42 is 14 times as many as 3." So 14 multiplied by 3 is 42, which is exactly what the equation says. So G is also correct. Wait, but the question is about interpreting the expression. So both F and G seem correct, but that can't be the case because only one option is right.

Wait, let me think again. The equation is 14 × 3 = 42. So 14 is multiplied by 3 to get 42. So 42 is the product. So in terms of 'times as many as', 42 is 14 multiplied by 3, which is the same as saying 42 is 14 times 3. So G says, "42 is 14 times as many as 3." Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because 14 times 3 is 42, so "42 is 14 times 3." But 'times as many as' would mean that 42 is 14 times more than 3. But that's correct because 3 ×14=42. So G is correct.

Wait, but F says, "42 is 3 times as many as 14." Because 3 ×14 is 42. So that's also correct. So both F and G are correct? But that can't be right because the options are supposed to have only one correct answer.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's rephrase. The equation is 14 ×3=42. So 42 is equal to fourteen threes or three fourteens. So '42 is three times as many as 14' because 3×14=42. Similarly, '42 is fourteen times as many as 3' because 14×3=42. So both F and G are correct interpretations of the equation.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me check. Option F: "42 is 3 times as many as 14." Yes, because 3×14=42. Option G: "42 is 14 times as many as 3." Also correct because 14×3=42. So both F and G seem correct. But that's impossible because the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wording. Let me think about 'times as many as.' If I say, "X is Y times as many as Z," it means X = Y × Z. So for F, 42 is 3 times as many as 14, so 3 ×14=42. That's correct. For G, 42 is 14 times as many as 3, which is 14×3=42. Also correct.

But the original equation is 14 ×3=42, which can be interpreted in two ways: either as 3 groups of 14 (so 42 is 3 times 14) or 14 groups of 3 (so 42 is 14 times 3). So both F and G are correct. But that can't be because it's a multiple-choice question. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the options, the question is about which statement correctly interprets the expression 14 ×3=42. So the expression is written as 14 multiplied by 3. So in words, that's "14 times 3," which is 42. So when we interpret that, 42 is equal to 14 multiplied by 3, which would mean 42 is 14 times 3. So that would correspond to option G: "42 is 14 times as many as 3."

Alternatively, the same equation could be phrased as 3 multiplied by 14 equals 42, which would make 42 three times as many as 14, which is option F.

Hmm, so both options F and G are correct interpretations of the equation, but the way the equation is written (14 ×3=42) might suggest that 14 is the multiplier and 3 is the multiplicand. So in that case, 42 is 14 times 3. So that would make G correct. But I'm getting stuck because both F and G seem correct, but perhaps only one is intended.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look back at the options. Option F says, "42 is 3 times as many as 14." That would mean 42 = 3 ×14, which is correct. Option G says, "42 is 14 times as many as 3," which is 42=14×3, also correct. So both F and G are correct, but that's impossible. So perhaps the intended answer is F, because in the equation 14 ×3=42, 42 is three times fourteen. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider that when you write the multiplication, the way you interpret it depends on the phrasing. So 14 ×3 can be read as "14 times 3," which implies that 14 is the number of groups, and 3 is the number in each group, making the total 42. So 42 is 14 times 3. So that would align with option G.

Alternatively, "3 times 14" would be the same as 14 times 3, because multiplication is commutative. So 3 ×14=42 is the same as 14 ×3=42. So both interpretations are correct.

Wait, but the question is about the equation as written: 14 ×3=42. So the way it's written, 14 is the first factor, 3 is the second. So when you read it, it's 14 multiplied by 3. So the product is 42. So in terms of 'times as many as,' it's 42 is 14 times 3. So option G is correct.

But then why is option F also correct? Because 3 times 14 is the same equation. So perhaps the question expects both F and G to be correct, but since it's a multiple-choice, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the other options to see if any others are correct.

Option I: "14 is the product of 3 and 42." No, because 3×42 is 126, not 14. So I is wrong.

Option H: "3 is 14 times as many as 42." That would mean 3=14×42, which is 588, so no.

Option E: "14 is 3 more than 42." No, 42+3=45.

Option D: "14 is 3 times as many as 42." No, because 3×42=126, which is way bigger than 14.

Option C: "3 is the product of 14 and 42." No, product is 588.

Option B: "42 is 14 more than 3." No, 3+14=17.

So only options A, F, and G are left.

Option A: "14 is the quotient of 42 and 3." That is, 42 ÷3=14. So that's correct, but it's about division, not multiplication. So A is correct in terms of division, but the question is about interpreting the multiplication equation 14 ×3=42.

So the correct interpretations are F and G, but only one can be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the wording of the options. Option F: "42 is 3 times as many as 14." So 3×14=42. Option G: "42 is 14 times as many as 3." So 14×3=42.

The original equation is 14 ×3=42, which is 14 multiplied by 3. So the correct interpretation in terms of 'times as many as' would be 42 is 14 times 3, which is option G.

But wait, 14 ×3 is the same as 3 ×14, so both F and G are correct, but perhaps the question expects G as the answer because it's written as 14 ×3.

But I'm a bit confused because both seem correct. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct, and I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F because 42 is three times as many as 14. Because 14 ×3=42. So in that case, 42 is three times 14, so F is correct.

Alternatively, 42 is fourteen times three, so G is correct. So both F and G are correct, but the way the equation is written, it's 14 ×3=42, so 14 is the factor, so 42 is fourteen times three. So G is correct.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive, so only one can be correct. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the question again. It says, "Which statement correctly interprets the expression?" So the expression is 14 ×3=42. So the correct interpretation is that 42 is equal to 14 multiplied by 3. So in words, "42 is 14 times 3." So that would be option G.

But another way to interpret it is that 42 is 3 times 14, which is option F. So both are correct. But since the equation is written as 14 ×3, perhaps the intended answer is G.

But wait, in the options, F says "3 times as many as 14," which is 3×14=42, which is correct. G says "14 times as many as 3," which is 14×3=42, also correct.

So I'm torn between F and G. But maybe the question expects both to be correct, but since only one can be chosen, perhaps the answer is F. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think about the wording of the options again. Option F: "42 is 3 times as many as 14." So 3×14=42, correct. Option G: "42 is 14 times as many as 3." 14×3=42, correct.

So both are correct. But the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is intended as correct. Maybe the answer is F, because 14 ×3=42 implies that 42 is three times fourteen. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because when you have A × B = C, C is A times B, but when you say C is A times as many as B, that would be correct. So 42 is 14 times as many as 3, which is option G.

Wait, no. If you have 14×3=42, then 42 is 14 times 3, so 42 is 14 times as many as 3. So G is correct.

But I'm getting stuck because both F and G seem correct. Maybe I should just pick the one that directly corresponds to the equation as written. So since the equation is 14×3=42, the correct interpretation is G: 42 is 14 times as many as 3.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The equation given is \(14 \times 3 = 42\). To interpret this correctly, we analyze the relationship between the numbers. Multiplication can be understood as "groups of": \(14 \times 3\) means 14 groups of 3, which equals 42. Similarly, it can also mean 3 groups of 14, which also equals 42. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

- **Option A**: "14 is the quotient of 42 and 3." This is correct because \(42 \div 3 = 14\), but it involves division, not multiplication, so it does not directly interpret the given equation.

- **Option B**: "42 is 14 more than 3." This is incorrect because \(14 + 3 = 17\), not 42.

- **Option C**: "3 is the product of 14 and 42." This is incorrect because \(14 \times 42 = 588\), not 3.

- **Option D**: "14 is 3 times as many as 42." This is incorrect because \(3 \times 42 = 126\), not 14.

- **Option E**: "14 is 3 more than 42." This is incorrect because \(42 + 3 = 45\), not 14.

- **Option F**: "42 is 3 times as many as 14." This is correct because \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

- **Option G**: "42 is 14 times as many as 3." This is also correct because \(14 \times 3 = 42\).

- **Option H**: "3 is 14 times as many as 42." This is incorrect because \(14 \times 42 = 588\), not 3.

- **Option I**: "14 is the product of 3 and 42." This is incorrect because \(3 \times 42 = 126\), not 14.

Both **F** and **G** are correct interpretations of the equation \(14 \times 3 = 42\). However, since the equation is written as \(14 \times 3 = 42\), the interpretation "42 is 14 times as many as 3" (Option G) aligns more directly with the way the equation is structured. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G**
