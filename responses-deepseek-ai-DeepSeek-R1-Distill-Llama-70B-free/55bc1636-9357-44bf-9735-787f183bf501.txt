Question:

Edward's Electronics had a March 1 inventory of $42,000, with a planned inventory of $36,000 for March 31. The store plans sales for the month of $22,000, with an additional $2,000 in planned markdowns. The store already has a $6,000 commitment to purchase inventory during the month. What is the store's open-to-buy?

Options:

A: $30,000
B: $6,000
C: $14,000
D: $48,000
E: $8,000
F: $60,000
G: $18,000
H: $12,000
I: $20,000
J: $10,000

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this open-to-buy problem for Edward's Electronics. I remember that open-to-buy is related to inventory management, and it's the amount the store can spend to purchase new inventory. Let me think about how to calculate this.

First, I think the formula involves the planned inventory, sales, markdowns, and the beginning inventory and purchases. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

So, the beginning inventory is $42,000 on March 1. The planned inventory for March 31 is $36,000. So, the store wants their inventory to decrease by $6,000 because 42k minus 36k is 6k. But wait, that's not considering sales and markdowns.

The planned sales for the month are $22,000, and there's an additional $2,000 in planned markdowns. So, total reductions in inventory would be sales plus markdowns, which is 22k + 2k = $24,000. 

Now, the beginning inventory plus any new purchases minus what's sold and marked down should equal the planned ending inventory. The formula might look like:

Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Sales - Markdowns = Planned Ending Inventory

But I'm not sure if that's right. Wait, no, because purchases increase inventory, and sales and markdowns decrease it. So, the equation should be:

Beginning Inventory + Purchases - (Sales + Markdowns) = Planned Ending Inventory

Yes, that makes sense. So we can plug in the numbers we have.

We have:

42,000 (beginning) + Purchases - (22,000 + 2,000) = 36,000 (planned ending)

So, 42,000 + Purchases - 24,000 = 36,000.

Let me compute the left side:

42,000 -24,000 = 18,000. So 18,000 + Purchases = 36,000.

Subtract 18,000 from both sides: Purchases = 36,000 -18,000 = 18,000.

Wait, so the total purchases needed are $18,000? But wait, the store already has a commitment to purchase $6,000 during the month. So, the open-to-buy would be the total purchases minus the committed amount.

So, total needed purchases are $18,000, and they've already committed to buy $6,000. So, open-to-buy = 18k -6k = $12,000.

But wait, let me double-check the formula. I think another approach is to calculate the total needed and then subtract the commitments.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard is:

Open-to-Buy = Planned Ending Inventory + Sales + Markdowns - Beginning Inventory - Committed Purchases

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Open-to-buy is the amount they can still purchase beyond what's already committed.

Wait, perhaps another way: The total amount they can spend on purchasing is equal to the planned ending inventory plus the sales and markdowns, minus the beginning inventory.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Ending Inventory + Sales + Markdowns - Beginning Inventory) - Committed Purchases.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers this way.

Planned Ending: 36k.

Sales and markdowns: 22k + 2k =24k.

So, total needed = 36k +24k =60k.

Subtract beginning inventory: 60k -42k=18k.

So, total purchasing needed is 18k.

They have already committed to 6k, so the open-to-buy is 18k -6k=12k.

So the answer should be $12,000. Looking at the options, option H is $12,000. So the answer is H.

To determine Edward's Electronics' open-to-buy, we start by calculating the total inventory needed to achieve the planned ending inventory after accounting for sales and markdowns. The formula used is:

\[
\text{Total Purchases Needed} = \text{Planned Ending Inventory} + \text{Sales} + \text{Markdowns} - \text{Beginning Inventory}
\]

Plugging in the given values:

\[
\text{Total Purchases Needed} = \$36,000 + \$22,000 + \$2,000 - \$42,000 = \$18,000
\]

The store has already committed to purchasing \$6,000 of inventory during the month. Therefore, the open-to-buy is the remaining amount the store can spend on additional purchases:

\[
\text{Open-to-Buy} = \text{Total Purchases Needed} - \text{Committed Purchases} = \$18,000 - \$6,000 = \$12,000
\]

Thus, the store's open-to-buy is \$12,000.

H: $12,000
