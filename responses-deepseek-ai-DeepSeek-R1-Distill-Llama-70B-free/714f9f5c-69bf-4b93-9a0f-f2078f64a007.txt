Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where a number x is given as 2^15 multiplied by 3^6. The question is asking for which number's cube equals x. The options are A through J, with various numbers listed.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you take the cube of a number, you're raising it to the third power. So, if I'm looking for a number y such that yÂ³ = x, then y should be the cube root of x. That makes sense.

So, x is 2^15 times 3^6. To find y, I can take the cube root of x. The cube root of a product is the product of the cube roots, so I can break it down into the cube roots of 2^15 and 3^6 separately.

Let me start with the 2^15 part. The cube root of 2^15. Well, 15 divided by 3 is 5, right? Because when you take the cube root, you're dividing the exponent by 3. So cube root of 2^15 is 2^(15/3) = 2^5. 2^5 is 32. Okay, that's one part.

Now for the 3^6 part. The cube root of 3^6. So 6 divided by 3 is 2. So that's 3^2, which is 9. Got it.

So now, y is the product of these two results. So 32 multiplied by 9. Let me calculate that. 32 times 9... 30*9 is 270, and 2*9 is 18, so 270+18=288. So y is 288.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake. So x is 2^15 *3^6. When taking the cube root, each exponent is divided by 3. So 15/3 is 5, 6/3 is 2. So yeah, 2^5 is 32 and 3^2 is 9. Multiply them together, 32 *9=288.

Looking at the options, option J is 288. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, let me look at the options again to make sure. The options are A:125, B:343, C:64, D:216, E:512, F:1728, G:1000, H:27, I:121, J:288. Yep, J is 288.

To solve the problem, we need to find a number \( y \) such that \( y^3 = x \), where \( x = 2^{15} \cdot 3^6 \). Taking the cube root of \( x \), we can break it down as follows:

1. The cube root of \( 2^{15} \) is \( 2^{15/3} = 2^5 = 32 \).
2. The cube root of \( 3^6 \) is \( 3^{6/3} = 3^2 = 9 \).

Multiplying these results gives \( y = 32 \cdot 9 = 288 \).

Thus, the number whose cube equals \( x \) is 288, which corresponds to option J.
