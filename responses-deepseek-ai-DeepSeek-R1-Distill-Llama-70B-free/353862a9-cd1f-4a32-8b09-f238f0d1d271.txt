Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Oral Torah. Hmm, I remember that in Judaism, there's a distinction between the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. The Written Torah is the one everyone knows, like the first five books of the Bible, right? That's also called the Chumash or Pentateuch. 

But the question is about the Oral Torah when it's written down. So, what's that called? I think the Oral Torah was originally passed down orally, as the name suggests, but over time it was written down. I remember learning about some texts that are part of this.

Wait, the Mishnah is a codification of the Oral Law. But is that the written form of the Oral Torah? Or is there another term? Oh, right, the Talmud includes the Mishnah and the Gemara, which are commentaries on it. So the Talmud is a bigger work, part of the Oral Torah in written form.

But the question is specifically asking for the name of the Oral Torah when it's written. The Oral Torah itself, when written, is called the Talmud? Or is it something else? Let me think. I think the Oral Torah refers to the teachings that were oral, but when they were written, they became the Talmud. So the written form of the Oral Torah is the Talmud. 

Wait, but the options include 'Talmud' as option C, and 'Mishnah' as A. Oh, right, the Mishnah is part of the Talmud. The Talmud includes the Mishnah and the Gemara, which are the discussions and explanations by later sages.

So in this context, the Oral Torah in written form is the Talmud. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the term 'Torah Shebichtav' which refers to the Written Torah. So the Oral Torah, when written, would be the Talmud. 

Let me double-check. The Written Torah is the Tanakh, specifically the first five books (Torah Shebichtav). The Oral Torah is the Talmud when written. So yes, the answer is C: Talmud.

The Oral Torah, when written down, is known as the Talmud. The Talmud includes the Mishnah and the Gemara, which are commentaries and discussions by various sages. While the Mishnah is a part of the Talmud, the broader written form of the Oral Torah is the Talmud itself. 

Answer: C
