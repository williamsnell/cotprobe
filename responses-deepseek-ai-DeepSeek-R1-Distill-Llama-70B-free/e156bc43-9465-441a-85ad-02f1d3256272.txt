Okay, so I need to figure out the gross and net markdown for this shirt, and then the net markdown percentage based on the current price. Let me start by understanding what each term means.

The original price was $6.75. Then during the sale, it went down to $4.50. After the sale ended, the price changed to $5.50. So let's break this down step by step.

First, the gross markdown. I think gross markdown refers to the total reduction from the original price to the sale price. So that would be the difference between $6.75 and $4.50. Let me calculate that: 6.75 minus 4.50. That gives me $2.25. So the gross markdown is $2.25.

Next, the net markdown. I'm a bit confused here. Net markdown is the amount that the price was reduced but not restored. So after the sale, the price went up to $5.50. So the net markdown is the original price minus the current price after the sale. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or is it the difference between the original and the current price? Let me think. Oh wait, no. Because the price after the sale is higher than the sale price, so the store didn't restore the entire markdown. They only increased it by a certain amount. So the net markdown is the amount that's still reduced compared to the original.

So the original price is $6.75, and after the sale, it's $5.50. So the net markdown is 6.75 minus 5.50, which is $1.25.

Wait, no, wait a second. Or is net markdown the amount the price was reduced from the original, but then increased back? Let me clarify. The markdown during the sale was $2.25 (from 6.75 to 4.50) but then the price was increased by $1.00 (from 4.50 to 5.50). So the net markdown from the original would be the initial markdown minus the amount it was increased. So 2.25 minus 1.00 equals $1.25. That makes sense because the current price is higher than the sale price by a dollar, so the net reduction is $1.25 from the original.

Okay, so gross markdown is $2.25, net markdown is $1.25.

Now, the net markdown percentage. This is calculated as (net markdown divided by the current price) times 100. So that's 1.25 divided by 5.50. Let me compute that.

1.25 ÷ 5.50 equals approximately 0.22727, which is about 22.727%. Looking at the options, that's 22.7% when rounded. So the percentage is 22.7%.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says Gross $2.25, Net $1.25, 27.2%. Hmm, 27.2 doesn't match our 22.7.

Option D: Gross $2.25, Net $1.25, 22.7%—that's exactly what we have.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Original price: 6.75. First markdown to 4.50: so 2.25 markdown. Then after sale, price is 5.50. So the increase from 4.50 to 5.50 is 1.00. So net markdown is original (6.75) minus current (5.50) = 1.25. 

So yes, net markdown is 1.25, and percentage is (1.25 /5.50)*100 = (approx) 22.7%.

Looking at the options, option D matches these numbers: Gross $2.25, Net $1.25, percentage 22.7%.

To determine the gross and net markdown, as well as the net markdown percentage, we analyze the price changes of the shirt:

1. **Gross Markdown**: This is the total reduction from the original price to the sale price.  
   Original price = $6.75  
   Sale price = $4.50  
   Gross Markdown = $6.75 - $4.50 = **$2.25**  

2. **Net Markdown**: This is the amount by which the price remains reduced after the sale.  
   Original price = $6.75  
   Current price after sale = $5.50  
   Net Markdown = $6.75 - $5.50 = **$1.25**  

3. **Net Markdown Percentage**: This is calculated as the net markdown divided by the current price, expressed as a percentage.  
   Net Markdown = $1.25  
   Current price = $5.50  
   Net Markdown Percentage = ($1.25 / $5.50) × 100 ≈ **22.7%**  

From the given options, the correct answer is:  
**Gross Markdown: $2.25, Net Markdown: $1.25, Net Markdown Percentage: 22.7%**
