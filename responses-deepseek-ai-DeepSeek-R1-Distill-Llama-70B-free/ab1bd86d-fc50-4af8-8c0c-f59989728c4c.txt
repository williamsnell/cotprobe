Okay, so I've got this question about hyperventilation and its effects on blood chemistry. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says a healthy person is sitting at rest and starts breathing too fast consciously. I remember that hyperventilation means breathing more rapidly or deeply than normal. When you breathe too fast, you're expelling more carbon dioxide than usual. 

Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of metabolism, right? And the body transports CO2 in the blood back to the lungs to be exhaled. So if I'm breathing too fast, I'm probably exhaling a lot of CO2. Now, CO2 levels in the blood would drop because I'm expelling more than I'm producing for a while.

Wait, CO2 is related to the blood's acidity. I recall that CO2 reacts with water in the blood to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-). So the more CO2 there is, the more H+ ions are produced, making the blood more acidic. But if CO2 levels drop because of hyperventilation, then the amount of H+ should decrease because there's less CO2 to form carbonic acid.

So, the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the blood would decrease. And since H+ concentration is directly related to CO2 levels, the H+ would also decrease, making the blood more alkaline. Wait, but doesn't the body have buffering systems to compensate for this?

Oh right, the bicarbonate buffering system. When CO2 levels drop, the body tries to compensate. The kidneys can excrete more H+ ions, but that takes some time. However, since this is acute hyperventilation, the immediate effect before the kidneys can adjust would be a decrease in both CO2 and H+.

But wait, the options don't all reflect that. Let me look back at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Decrease in both pCO2 and H+.

Option D: Decrease pCO2 and increase H+ (that doesn't make sense, because lower CO2 should mean lower H+).

Option F: Decrease pCO2 and no change in H+. Hmm, why would H+ not change? Oh, maybe because of buffering, but wait, if CO2 is lower, H+ should be lower immediately.

Wait, the body's buffer system (like bicarbonate) can neutralize some H+ ions. So when CO2 decreases, the reaction would shift. Let me think about the bicarbonate buffer equation:

CO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3-

If CO2 decreases, the equilibrium shifts to the left, using up H+ and producing more CO2 and H2O, but since we're expelling CO2, the H+ would decrease. So the H+ concentration in the blood would go down (more alkaline), leading to respiratory alkalosis.

So the pCO2 is lower, and H+ is lower. That's option B: decrease in both.

Wait, but another thought: in the short term, before the kidneys can adjust, the pH goes up because H+ is lower. But the kidneys will try to compensate by excreting more bicarbonate, which would bring the pH back towards normal. But the question is about the change caused by hyperventilation, not the body's compensatory response. So the immediate effect is lower CO2 and lower H+.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says both decrease, which matches this.

Wait, but another angle: the concentration of H+ is measured in arterial blood. When you hyperventilate, you're reducing CO2, which reduces H+ (since CO2 contributes to H+). So the H+ concentration should decrease, making the blood less acidic (more alkaline). So yes, both pCO2 and [H+] decrease.

So the correct answer should be option B: decrease in both.

Wait, but wait another thing: when someone hyperventilates, they might not be in a pathological condition, but just voluntarily breathing fast. The body's immediate response is a drop in pCO2 and pH rises (becomes more alkaline, so H+ decreases).

So, option B is the correct choice.
</think>

When a healthy person hyperventilates, they exhale more carbon dioxide (CO2) than usual. CO2 is a byproduct of metabolism and contributes to the acidity of blood by reacting with water to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-). A decrease in CO2 levels in the blood leads to a reduction in H+ concentration, making the blood more alkaline. This condition is known as respiratory alkalosis.

The immediate effects of hyperventilation include a decrease in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the blood and a corresponding decrease in H+ concentration. While the body has buffering systems (e.g., bicarbonate) to mitigate changes in pH, the question focuses on the immediate changes caused by hyperventilation, not the compensatory mechanisms that occur over time.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that both pCO2 and H+ decrease, aligning with the immediate effects of hyperventilation.
- Other options either incorrectly describe the relationship between pCO2 and H+ or fail to account for the immediate changes.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions.**

Answer: B
