Okay, so I have this problem about a discrete memoryless channel, and I need to find its capacity. Hmm, I remember from my information theory class that channel capacity is the maximum mutual information between the input and output, right? So the formula is C = max I(X;Y), where the maximum is over all possible input distributions.

The problem states that Y = XZ, where X and Z are independent binary variables. Both X and Z can be 0 or 1. Also, P(Z=1) is 0.5. Oh right, because Z is a binary random variable with probability 0.5 of being 1, it's like a coin flip.

Wait, so Y is the product of X and Z. Let me think about the possible values Y can take. Since X and Z are binary, their product Y will also be binary. Let me enumerate all possibilities:

- If X=0, then Y=0 regardless of Z. Because 0 times anything is 0.
- If X=1, then Y=Z. So when X is 1, Y can be 0 or 1, each with probability 0.5.

So the output Y depends on X and Z. But since X and Z are independent, the channel is determined by the transition probabilities.

Let me model this as a channel. The input is X, which can be 0 or 1. The output is Y, which is 0 when X=0, and Y=Z (so 0 or 1) when X=1.

So the channel has the following transition probabilities:

For each input x, the output y is determined as follows:

- If x=0:
  - y=0 with probability 1, because Z doesn't matter here.
- If x=1:
  - y=0 with probability 0.5 (when Z=0)
  - y=1 with probability 0.5 (when Z=1)

So the channel transition matrix looks like this:

      Y=0    Y=1
X=0   1.0    0.0
X=1   0.5    0.5

Now, to find the capacity of this channel, I need to compute the maximum of the mutual information I(X;Y) over all possible input distributions P(X).

Let me denote P(X=0) = p and P(X=1) = 1-p. I'll need to express I(X;Y) in terms of p and then maximize it.

First, I should compute the probabilities P(Y=0) and P(Y=1). Let's do that.

P(Y=0) = P(X=0) * P(Y=0|X=0) + P(X=1) * P(Y=0|X=1)
= p * 1 + (1-p) * 0.5
= p + 0.5(1-p) = 0.5 + 0.5p

Similarly, P(Y=1) = 1 - P(Y=0) = 0.5 - 0.5p + (1-p)*0.5 ? Wait, maybe I should compute it directly.

Wait, no, Y=1 can only happen when X=1 and Z=1. So P(Y=1) = P(X=1) * P(Z=1) = (1-p) * 0.5 = 0.5(1-p)

So P(Y=1) = 0.5(1-p), and P(Y=0) is 1 - 0.5(1-p) = 0.5 + 0.5p, which matches my earlier calculation.

Now, the mutual information I(X;Y) is H(Y) - H(Y|X). Because I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X).

Let me compute H(Y) first. H(Y) is the entropy of Y, which is - [P(Y=0) log P(Y=0) + P(Y=1) log P(Y=1) ].

H(Y) = - [ (0.5 + 0.5p) log(0.5 + 0.5p) + (0.5 - 0.5p) log(0.5 - 0.5p) ) ]

Then, H(Y|X) is the conditional entropy of Y given X. Since for X=0, Y is always 0, the entropy for X=0 is 0. For X=1, Y is 0 or 1 with equal probability, so the entropy is 1.

So H(Y|X) = P(X=0)*H(Y|X=0) + P(X=1)*H(Y|X=1)
= p * 0 + (1-p) * 1
= 1 - p

Putting it all together, I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = [ - ( (0.5+0.5p) log(0.5+0.5p) + (0.5-0.5p) log(0.5-0.5p) ) ] - (1-p)

Wait, no, H(Y|X) is (1-p)*1, so I(X;Y) = H(Y) - (1-p)

Hmm, so substituting:

I = H(Y) - (1-p)

But H(Y) is the entropy of Y as a function of p.

Wait, let me think again. No, H(Y|X) is (1-p)*1 + p*0 = 1-p. So yes, I(X;Y) = H(Y) - (1-p).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, H(Y|X) is 1-p, so I(X;Y) is H(Y) - H(Y|X) = H(Y) - (1 - p).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the expressions step by step.

H(Y) = - [ (0.5 + 0.5p) log2(0.5 + 0.5p) + (0.5 - 0.5p) log2(0.5 - 0.5p) ]

H(Y|X) = 0 * p + 1 * (1-p) = (1-p)

So I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = [H(Y)] - (1-p).

Wait, but wait, that would be H(Y) - (1-p). Hmm, but that doesn't look right because when p=0 (X is always 1), what happens?

Wait, if p=0, then P(Y=0) = 0.5(1-p) = 0.5 *1 = 0.5. So Y is equally likely to be 0 or 1. So H(Y) is 1. Then I(X;Y) would be 1 - 0 = 1? But H(Y|X) is 1*(1-0) = 1. So I(X;Y) = 1 - 1 = 0. That can't be right because when X is always 1, Y is a Bernoulli(0.5) variable, so the mutual information should be I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X). H(Y) is 1, H(Y|X) is 1 (because given X=1, Y is still 0.5), so I(X;Y)=0. So that case makes sense.

Wait, but when p=0, the input is always X=1, so the output Y is 0 and 1 with equal probability, but X and Y are independent? Because X is fixed at 1, so Y is a function of Z, which is independent of X. So indeed, I(X;Y) would be zero in that case.

Wait, but let's think of when p = 0.5. Then P(Y=0) is 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.75. P(Y=1) is 0.5 - 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. So H(Y) = - [0.75 log2(0.75) + 0.25 log2(0.25) ] ≈ 0.75 * 0.415 + 0.25 * 2 = 0.311 + 0.5 = 0.811 bits. Then H(Y|X)=1 - 0.5 = 0.5, so I(X;Y)=0.811 - 0.5=0.311 bits. But I'm not sure if this is the maximum.

Wait, I think I need to find the value of p that maximizes I(X;Y). So I should express I as a function of p, then take the derivative and find the maximum.

So let me define:

I(p) = H(Y) - (1-p)

With H(Y) = - [ (0.5 + 0.5p) log2(0.5 + 0.5p) + (0.5 - 0.5p) log2(0.5 - 0.5p) ]

So I(p) = H(Y) - (1-p)

Wait, no, wait. No, H(Y|X) is (1 - p), so I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = H(Y) - (1-p).

So I(p) = [ - (a log a + b log b ) ] - (1-p), where a = 0.5 + 0.5p and b = 0.5 - 0.5p.

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

I(p) = H(Y) - (1-p)

H(Y) is the entropy of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter a, where a = 0.5 + 0.5p. So H(Y) = H(a) where H(a) is the binary entropy function.

So H(Y) = H(0.5 + 0.5p) = - ( (0.5 + 0.5p) log2(0.5 + 0.5p) + (0.5 - 0.5p) log2(0.5 - 0.5p) )

So I(p) = H(0.5 + 0.5p) - (1 - p)

Wait, but to maximize I(p), I need to take the derivative of I(p) with respect to p, set it to zero, and solve for p.

Let me compute the derivative dI/dp.

First, dH(Y)/dp: The derivative of H(a) with respect to a is log2( (1 - a)/a ). So using the chain rule, dH(Y)/dp = [ log2( (1 - a)/a ) ) ] * da/dp.

Here, a = 0.5 + 0.5p, so da/dp = 0.5.

Thus, dH(Y)/dp = 0.5 * log2( (1 - a)/a ) 

= 0.5 * log2( ( (0.5 - 0.5p) ) / (0.5 + 0.5p) ) )

= 0.5 * log2( (0.5(1 - p)) / (0.5(1 + p)) ) )

= 0.5 * log2( (1 - p)/(1 + p) )

Then, the derivative of I(p) is dH(Y)/dp - d(1-p)/dp.

The derivative of (1-p) with respect to p is -1. So,

dI/dp = [0.5 log2( (1-p)/(1+p) ) ] - (-1)

= 0.5 log2( (1-p)/(1+p) ) + 1

Set this equal to zero to find the maximum.

So,

0.5 log2( (1-p)/(1+p) ) + 1 = 0

=> 0.5 log2( (1-p)/(1+p) ) = -1

Multiply both sides by 2:

log2( (1-p)/(1+p) ) = -2

So,

(1-p)/(1+p) = 2^(-2) = 1/4

So,

(1-p) = (1/4)(1 + p)

Multiply both sides by 4:

4(1 - p) = 1 + p

Expand:

4 -4p = 1 + p

Bring terms together:

4 -1 = 4p + p

3 =5p

p=3/5=0.6

So the optimal p is 0.6. So P(X=0)=0.6, P(X=1)=0.4.

Now, substitute p=0.6 into I(p) to find the maximum mutual information.

Compute I(0.6):

I = H(Y) - (1 - 0.6) = H(Y) - 0.4

What's H(Y)?

a = 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8

So H(Y) = H(0.8) = - [0.8 log2(0.8) + 0.2 log2(0.2) ]

Compute each term:

0.8 log2(0.8) ≈ 0.8*(-0.321928) ≈ -0.257542

0.2 log2(0.2) ≈ 0.2*(-2.321928) ≈ -0.464386

So H(Y) = - ( -0.257542 -0.464386 ) = 0.721928 bits.

So I = 0.721928 - 0.4 = 0.321928 bits.

Wait, but wait, that's around 0.322 bits. Looking at the options, option H is 0.322. But wait, I thought when p=0.5, I got around 0.311, which was lower than this. So this would be the maximum.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, when p=0.6, a=0.8, so H(Y)=H(0.8)=0.721928 bits. Then I=0.721928 - 0.4=0.321928≈0.322 bits.

That's the value, so the capacity is approximately 0.322 bits, which is option H.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the channel, when X=1, Y is equally likely to be 0 or 1. So for X=1, the channel is noisy, while for X=0, it's noiseless. So the optimal strategy would be to sometimes send X=0 to get a deterministic output, and sometimes X=1 to allow for some information through.

Wait, but when p=0.6, so X=0 60% of the time, and X=1 40% of the time. So in those 40% cases, half the time Y=0 and half Y=1. So Y is 0 60% +20% =80% of the time, and 1 20% of the time.

Hmm, but the mutual information is around 0.322. I think that's correct.

Looking at the options:

Option H is 0.322.

So the answer should be H.

To determine the capacity of the discrete memoryless channel \( Y = XZ \), where \( X \) and \( Z \) are independent binary random variables with \( P(Z=1) = 0.5 \), we proceed as follows:

### Channel Description
The channel is defined by the transition probabilities:
- If \( X = 0 \), then \( Y = 0 \) with probability 1.
- If \( X = 1 \), then \( Y = 0 \) or \( Y = 1 \) with equal probability (0.5 each).

The transition matrix is:
\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & Y=0 & Y=1 \\
\hline
X=0 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\
X=1 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
\end{array}
\]

### Input Distribution
Let \( P(X=0) = p \) and \( P(X=1) = 1-p \). The output probabilities are:
\[
P(Y=0) = p \cdot 1 + (1-p) \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5p,
\]
\[
P(Y=1) = 1 - P(Y=0) = 0.5 - 0.5p.
\]

### Mutual Information
The mutual information \( I(X;Y) \) is given by:
\[
I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X),
\]
where \( H(Y) \) is the entropy of \( Y \), and \( H(Y|X) \) is the conditional entropy of \( Y \) given \( X \).

1. **Entropy of \( Y \):**
\[
H(Y) = -\left[ P(Y=0) \log P(Y=0) + P(Y=1) \log P(Y=1) \right].
\]
Substituting \( P(Y=0) = 0.5 + 0.5p \) and \( P(Y=1) = 0.5 - 0.5p \):
\[
H(Y) = -\left[ (0.5 + 0.5p) \log (0.5 + 0.5p) + (0.5 - 0.5p) \log (0.5 - 0.5p) \right].
\]

2. **Conditional Entropy \( H(Y|X) \):**
- If \( X = 0 \), \( Y = 0 \) deterministically, so \( H(Y|X=0) = 0 \).
- If \( X = 1 \), \( Y \) is equally likely to be 0 or 1, so \( H(Y|X=1) = 1 \).

Thus:
\[
H(Y|X) = P(X=0) \cdot H(Y|X=0) + P(X=1) \cdot H(Y|X=1) = p \cdot 0 + (1-p) \cdot 1 = 1 - p.
\]

3. **Mutual Information:**
\[
I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = H(Y) - (1 - p).
\]

### Maximizing Mutual Information
To maximize \( I(X;Y) \), we express \( I(X;Y) \) as a function of \( p \)
