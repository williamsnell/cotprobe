Okay, I'm trying to solve this differential hoist problem. Hmm, I remember that a differential hoist uses two wheels, one larger and one smaller. The load is lifted by the difference in the number of slots between these two wheels. 

So, the load given is 450 pounds. The larger wheel has 9 slots, and the smaller has 8. Wait, but how does that work? Oh right, when you pull the rope, the number of ropes around each wheel determines the mechanical advantage. The formula I think is that the effort needed is (load * number of slots on the smaller wheel) divided by (number of slots on the larger wheel minus the smaller one) times the efficiency.

Wait, let me think again. The mechanical advantage (MA) for a differential hoist is usually the ratio of the larger wheel's slots to the smaller one's. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the formula I remember is MA = (L + l) / (L - l), where L is the larger wheel's circumference and l the smaller. But wait, in terms of slots, since each slot holds a certain length of rope, maybe the number of slots relates to the circumference. So perhaps the MA is (number of slots on larger wheel + number on smaller) divided by their difference? Or maybe it's just the difference in slots because each slot represents a certain length, and the difference would give how much the load is lifted per effort.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get this straight. For a differential pulley, the mechanical advantage is calculated based on the difference in the number of ropes that support the load. So if the larger pulley has more slots, each pull of the rope lifts the load by the difference in the number of ropes. Wait, perhaps the formula is (L - l) / L, where L is the larger. No, that's for a simple pulley's efficiency. Hmm.

Wait, I think the mechanical advantage (MA) for a differential hoist is given by MA = (D + d)/(D - d), where D is the diameter of the larger pulley and d the smaller. But since the problem gives the number of slots, which relates to the circumference, maybe the ratio is based on the number of slots. Because each slot represents a certain length of rope, so the number of slots relates to the diameter or circumference.

Wait, let's think differently. The number of slots on each pulley determines how much rope wraps around them. The larger pulley has more slots, meaning each slot is smaller in length. Or wait, no, more slots would mean each slot is a segment of the circumference. So the circumference of the larger pulley would be (number of slots) times the length per slot. Wait, but the actual length per slot (like the distance between two adjacent slots) would be the same for both pulleys if the rope is the same. So the larger pulley has a larger circumference because it has more slots. So the ratio of the number of slots would be the same as the ratio of the circumferences.

So, the mechanical advantage (MA) is (number of slots on larger wheel) / (number of slots on larger wheel - number of slots on smaller wheel). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the MA for a differential pulley is (D + d)/(D - d), where D and d are the diameters (or circumferences) of the two pulleys. Since circumference is directly proportional to diameter, the ratio would be the same.

So, the MA would be (C_large + C_small) / (C_large - C_small). But since C = πD, and if the number of slots is proportional to C, then MA = (slots_large + slots_small) / (slots_large - slots_small). So in this case, slots_large is 9 and slots_small is 8. So MA = (9 + 8)/(9-8) = 17/1 = 17. That seems high, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no. I think I might have this wrong. Because in a differential pulley, the mechanical advantage is (number of ropes supporting the load). So the larger pulley has more ropes, which means more support. Let me think again. The formula I remember is that the effort (E) needed is E = (W * (L + l)) / (L - l) * efficiency. Or maybe E = (W * (L + l)) / ( (L - l) * efficiency ). Wait, no, efficiency is the output over input. So the actual mechanical advantage is the ideal MA multiplied by the efficiency.

Wait, ideal MA is (L + l)/(L - l), but with efficiency, the actual MA is MA_actual = MA_ideal * efficiency. Then, the effort E would be E = W / MA_actual.

Wait, let me clarify. The formula for the effort in a differential pulley system is E = (W * (L + l)) / ( (L - l) * efficiency ). Or is it E = (W * (L - l) ) / ( (L + l) * efficiency )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's approach it step by step.

First, the mechanical advantage without considering efficiency is (L + l)/(L - l). But since efficiency is less than 100%, the actual MA is less than the ideal. So the formula would be MA_actual = (L + l)/(L - l) * efficiency.

Then, effort E is equal to the load W divided by MA_actual. So E = W / ( (L + l)/(L - l) * efficiency )

But wait, let me think about the formula correctly. The mechanical advantage is (L + l)/(L - l) in an ideal scenario (without friction or losses). But when you have efficiency (η), the actual MA becomes MA_actual = η * MA_ideal.

So, MA_actual = η * ( (L + l)/(L - l) )

Then, the effort E is W / MA_actual = W / ( η * ( (L + l)/(L - l) ) )

Which simplifies to E = W * (L - l) / ( η*(L + l) )

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So the effort is (W * (L - l) ) / ( η * (L + l) )

In this problem, L is the number of slots on the larger wheel, and l on the smaller. So L=9, l=8.

So substituting:

E = (450 lb * (9 - 8)) / ( (33.333...% ) * (9 + 8) )

Wait, 33 1/3% is 1/3 in decimal.

So 33.333% = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So let's compute this.

First, numerator: 450 * (9-8) = 450 *1 = 450.

Denominator: (1/3) * (9+8) = (1/3)*17 ≈ 5.6667.

So E = 450 / (5.6667) ≈ 450 / (17/3) ) = 450 * (3/17) = (450 *3)/17.

Calculating 450 *3 = 1350. Then 1350 /17 ≈ 79.4118 pounds.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 79.41. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:60, B:85, C:65, D:75, E:95, F:100, G:110, H:80, I:90, J:70.

Hmm, the closest is H:80. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate. Let's compute 1350 divided by 17.

17*79 = 1343 (because 17*70=1190, 17*9=153; 1190+153=1343).

1350-1343=7, so 79 and 7/17 ≈79.4118 lb.

But the options don't have 79. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I got the MA calculation wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (W * (L - l) ) / (η * (L + l) )

Wait, that's what I used. But wait, let me check another approach.

Alternatively, the effort required is E = (W * (1 + (l/L)) ) / (η * (1 - (l/L)) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the mechanical advantage is (L - l)/L, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of ropes on the larger pulley is L, and on the smaller is l. The difference is (L - l), which is the number of ropes that actually lift the load. So maybe the mechanical advantage is (L - l) / L? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find the correct formula for a differential pulley.

Upon reviewing, the mechanical advantage (MA) of a differential pulley is given by MA = (D + d)/(D - d), where D is the diameter of the larger pulley and d the smaller. So if the number of slots is proportional to the diameter (since each slot represents a certain length around the circumference), then MA = (L + l)/(L - l), where L is the larger number of slots and l the smaller.

But considering efficiency, the actual MA is MA_actual = MA_ideal * η.

So the effort E would be E = W / MA_actual = W / ( ( (L + l)/(L - l) ) * η )

Which rearranges to E = W * (L - l) / ( η*(L + l) )

So plugging in the numbers:

W = 450 lb

L =9, l=8

η = 33.333% = 1/3.

So,

E = 450 * (9 -8) / ( (1/3) * (9 +8) )

= 450 * 1 / ( (17/3) )

= 450 * 3 /17

= 1350 /17 ≈79.41 lb.

But the options don't have 79.41. The closest is H:80, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the formula is different because the way the slots are arranged. Let me think again: maybe the mechanical advantage is (L - l) / L. Because for each revolution, the larger pulley moves (L - l) lengths compared to the smaller.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the effort is calculated as E = (W * (L - l) ) / ( η * (L + l) )

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the efficiency is given as 33 1/3% which is approximately 0.3333. Let me double-check the calculation.

Compute 1350 /17.

Let me do it step by step.

17 * 70 = 1190.

1350 -1190 = 160.

17 *9=153. So 70+9=79, and 160-153=7.

So 79 with a remainder of 7, which is 7/17 ≈ 0.4118. So 79.4118 lb.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses L and l as the diameters, but in the problem it's the number of slots. Are the number of slots proportional to the diameter? Because if the pulleys are made with slots of the same width and spacing, then more slots would mean a larger diameter, hence larger circumference.

So in that case, the ratio of the diameters would be the same as the ratio of the number of slots. So D = k * L, and d= k * l, where k is some constant.

Thus, (D +d)/(D -d) = (k(L + l)) / (k (L - l)) ) = (L + l)/(L - l).

So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the efficiency is 33.333%, which is 1/3, but perhaps it's applied differently. Let me think about it.

Efficiency (η) is the ratio of the output work to the input work. So η = output / input.

The mechanical advantage without efficiency is (L + l)/(L - l) = 17/1 =17.

But with efficiency, the actual MA is η * MA_ideal.

So actual MA = (1/3) *17 = 17/3 ≈5.6667.

Then, effort E = W / actual MA = 450 / (17/3) = 450 *3/17 = 79.41 lb.

But again, that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (W * (L + l)) / ( (L - l) * η )

Wait, that would be E = (450 *17) / (1 * 1/3 ) = (7650) / (1/3) )= 7650 *3 = 22,950 lb. That can't be right.

No, that's way too high. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe E = (W * (L - l)) / ( (L + l) * η )

Which would be 450*(1)/(17 * 1/3) )= 450 *3 /17 ≈79.41 lb, same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E = (W * (L - l)) / (η * (L + l) )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula. Let me look for another approach.

Another way: the effort required without considering efficiency is E_ideal = (W * (L - l)) / (L + l).

Then, considering efficiency, the actual effort E = E_ideal / η.

So,

E_ideal = (450 * (9-8)) / (9+8) )= 450 *1 /17 ≈26.47 lb.

Then, E = 26.47 / (1/3) )= 26.47 *3≈79.41 lb.

Same result again. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely; perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the mechanical advantage is (number of ropes supporting the load) which is L - l, but that doesn't make sense because the larger pulley would have more ropes. Wait, no, the number of ropes on the larger pulley is more, so the difference is the number of ropes that actually contribute to lifting.

Wait, another approach: for a differential pulley, the MA is the number of ropes that share the load. If the larger pulley has more ropes, then the MA is (number of ropes on larger pulley) / (number of ropes on smaller). No, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, perhaps the MA is (L + l)/(L - l), where L is the number of ropes on the larger pulley, and l on the smaller.

Wait, perhaps this is correct. So MA_ideal = (9 +8)/(9-8) )=17/1=17.

Efficiency is 33.333%, so MA_actual = 17 * (1/3) ≈5.6667.

Then, E = W / MA_actual = 450 /5.6667 ≈79.41 lb.

Still the same result, but no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is applied inversely. Let me think, the efficiency is the ratio of useful work to the total work done. So η = output / input.

So the actual effort required would be higher than the ideal, as efficiency is less than 1. So perhaps the formula should be E = (W * (L + l) ) / ( (L - l) * η )

Wait, let me try that.

E = (450 *17 ) / (1 * (1/3) )= (7650) / (1/3) )= 7650 *3=22,950 lb. That can't be right; that's way too high.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think about the definition of mechanical advantage again. The MA is the ratio of the load to the effort. So MA = W / E.

In ideal conditions, MA_ideal = (L + l)/(L - l).

But with efficiency η, the actual MA is η * MA_ideal.

So,

η = MA_actual / MA_ideal.

Thus,

MA_actual = η * MA_ideal.

Then,

MA_actual = (W / E) = η * ( (L + l)/(L - l) )

So,

W/E = η*( (L + l)/(L - l) )

Solving for E,

E = W / ( η*( (L + l)/(L - l) ) )

= W * (L - l) / ( η*(L + l) )

Which brings us back to the same formula.

So,

E = (450 *1 ) / ( (1/3)*17 )

= 450 / (17/3 )

= 450 *3/17 = 1350/17 ≈79.41 lb.

Hmm, but again, no option matches. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 17*5=85, so 17*5=85. So 17*79=1343. 1350-1343=7. So 79 and 7/17 lb.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to approximate 79.41 as 80 lb, which is option H.

Looking back at the options:

H:80 pounds.

So maybe the intended answer is H:80.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for effort is E = (W * L ) / ( (L - l) * η )

Wait, let me try that.

E = 450 *9 / ( (1) * (1/3) )= 4050 / (1/3) )= 4050 *3=12,150 lb. No, that's way off.

No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (W * (L - l) ) / ( (L + l) * η )

Which is what I used before, giving 79.41 lb.

So perhaps the intended answer is H:80.

But let me check the options again. The options are:

A:60, B:85, C:65, D:75, E:95, F:100, G:110, H:80, I:90, J:70.

So H is 80
