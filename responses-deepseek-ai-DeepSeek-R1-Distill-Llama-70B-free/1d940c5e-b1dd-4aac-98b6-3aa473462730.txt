Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about norms and inner products. The question is asking for which value of p the norm ||x||_p can be expressed as an inner product. Hmm, I need to think about what each part means.

First, I remember that the p-norm is defined as ||x||_p = (sum |x_i|^p)^(1/p). And an inner product, like the dot product, is when you multiply corresponding components and sum them. But wait, when can a norm be expressed using an inner product?

Oh right! I think that for a norm to come from an inner product, it has to satisfy certain properties. Specifically, I remember something about the norm being derived from an inner product if and only if it's a Hilbert space, and for that, the norm needs to be induced by an inner product. 

Wait, what's the condition for that? There's a theorem about this. I think it's related to the parallelogram law. The norm comes from an inner product if and only if the parallelogram identity holds. The parallelogram law states that 2||x||² + 2||y||² = ||x+y||² + ||x−y||².

But how does this relate to the p-norms? I remember that for p=2, the norm is the standard Euclidean norm, which definitely comes from the inner product (the dot product). So p=2 is a candidate.

What about other p values? Let's think. For p=1, the norm is the sum of absolute values. Does that come from an inner product? I'm not so sure. The inner product would have to be something like sum x_i y_i, but the norm induced by that is the L2 norm, not L1. So maybe p=1 doesn't work.

What about p=∞? The max norm. That doesn't seem to come from an inner product either. Because the inner product would have to relate to the maximum element, which doesn't fit the usual structure.

So, putting this together, the only p-norm that can be expressed as an inner product is p=2. Because for p=2, the inner product is the standard dot product, and the norm is the square root of the dot product of the vector with itself.

Looking back at the options, option D says p=2. So the correct answer should be D.

The question asks for which value of \( p \) the norm \( \|x\|_p \) can be expressed as an inner product. The \( p \)-norm is defined as \( \|x\|_p = \left( \sum |x_i|^p \right)^{1/p} \), and for a norm to be induced by an inner product, it must satisfy the parallelogram law. This law states that \( 2\|x\|^2 + 2\|y\|^2 = \|x+y\|^2 + \|x-y\|^2 \).

For \( p = 2 \), the norm corresponds to the Euclidean norm, which is induced by the standard inner product (dot product). This satisfies the parallelogram law. For other values of \( p \), such as \( p = 1 \) or \( p = \infty \), the norms do not satisfy the parallelogram law and thus cannot be expressed as inner products. Therefore, the only value of \( p \) for which \( \|x\|_p \) can be expressed as an inner product is \( p = 2 \).

The correct answer is **D**.
