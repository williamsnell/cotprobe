Question:

In which ways does realism differ from social constructivism in the theorisation of identity within international relations?

Options:

A: Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.
B: Realism regards identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behaviour.
C: Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.
D: Social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system, whilst realists regard state interaction as being the natural progression of identity formulation.

Okay, so I need to figure out how realism differs from social constructivism in the theorization of identity within international relations. Hmm, I remember from my IR class that realism and social constructivism are two different schools of thought. Let me try to break this down.

Realism, as I recall, focuses a lot on power, state sovereignty, and an anarchic international system. Realists like Morgenthau or Waltz would argue that states act primarily based on their interests and the need for survival. They see the international system as a place where states interact in a sort of power struggle, and behavior is often driven by self-interest and security needs. Now, when it comes to identity, I'm not too sure. I think realists might not prioritize identity as much as other factors. Maybe they see identity as less important or perhaps as something more fixed, not really shaped by social interactions.

On the other hand, social constructivism emphasizes that many aspects of international relations are socially constructed, meaning they're created and sustained through social interactions and shared ideas. So identity, in this view, is something that emerges from these interactions. Constructivists would argue that identities are not fixed but are constructed over time through processes like norms, culture, and shared knowledge. So, for example, a state's identity (like being a democracy or part of the West) influences its behavior because it shapes how it sees itself and others.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: It says social constructivism uses causality and prioritizes identity as socially constructed. Realism sees behavior as action-response. I'm not sure if realists focus on action-response patterns. I thought they were more about power and anarchy, but maybe that's part of it. Constructivists definitely focus on identity as social, so A might be correct.

Option B: Claims realists regard identity as crucial and base their theory on it. I don't think that's right. Realism is more about power and state interests, not so much about identity. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Says realism is based on causality, constructivism on intersubjective meanings. Causality in realism makes sense because they explain behavior through cause-effect (like anarchy causes competition). Constructivists focus on meanings and interpretations, so this sounds accurate. So C is a possible correct answer.

Option D: States that constructivists see the state as independent shaped by the system, while realists see interaction as identity formulation. Wait, realists might see states as units acting based on system needs, but I'm not sure about the identity part here. Constructivists probably see identity as something that's built through interaction, but this option seems mixed up. I'm not confident about D.

So, now I need to decide between A, C, and maybe others. Let's think again. Realism doesn't focus much on identity, whereas constructivism does. So does option A correctly capture that? A says social constructivism uses causality, which I'm not sure about. Wait, constructivists might not focus on causality as much as they do on understanding and meaning.

Option C says realism is based on causality, constructivism on intersubjective meanings. That aligns with what I remember. Realists use causal theories (like the balance of power causing state behavior), while constructivists look at shared meanings and how identities are constructed through them. So C seems correct.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option A says social constructivism employs causality, which might not be accurate. I think constructivists are more about understanding rather than explaining with causality. So A is probably wrong. So the correct answer is C.

The question asks how realism differs from social constructivism in the theorization of identity within international relations. Realism focuses on power, state sovereignty, and an anarchic international system, with behavior driven by self-interest and survival. It does not prioritize identity, seeing it as less relevant compared to power dynamics. In contrast, social constructivism emphasizes that identity is socially constructed through interactions, norms, and shared knowledge, shaping state behavior.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While social constructivism does prioritize identity as socially constructed, it does not emphasize causality as much as understanding and meaning. Realism is more about power and anarchy than "action-response" patterns.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Realism does not regard identity as a crucial consideration; it focuses on power and state interests.
- **Option C**: Correct. Realism is based on causality, explaining behavior through cause-effect (e.g., anarchy leading to competition). Social constructivism focuses on intersubjective meanings and how identities are constructed through interactions.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While constructivists see identity as built through interaction, the description of state behavior in the international system is mixed up and does not accurately reflect the theories.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it accurately captures the difference between realism's focus on causality and social constructivism's emphasis on intersubjective meanings in theorizing identity.
