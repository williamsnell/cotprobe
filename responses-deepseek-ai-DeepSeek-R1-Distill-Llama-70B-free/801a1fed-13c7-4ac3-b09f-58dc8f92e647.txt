Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of people in India who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013. The options are from A to J, each with different percentages. I'm a bit unsure about the exact figure, but I'll try to think through it.

I remember that corruption is a significant issue in India, and there have been various surveys over the years. Maybe I've heard about some reports from organizations like Transparency International or maybe Gallup. Wait, I think the Global Corruption Barometer might have some relevant data. 

I recall that around 2013, there was a lot of talk about corruption in India, especially with the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party which focused on anti-corruption. That might have been around 2012-2013. So the public perception must have been high regarding corruption in political parties.

Looking at the options, the higher percentages are in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I'm trying to remember if it was over 70%. I think Transparency International's survey around that time showed a high percentage. Maybe 76%? That rings a bell. Or could it have been 70%? 

Wait, another thought: sometimes these surveys have numbers like 66% or 70%. But I'm more inclined towards a higher number because the issue was so prominent. Let me think, Transparency International's 2013 Global Corruption Barometer reported that 76% of Indians thought political parties were corrupt. Yeah, that sounds right. 

So looking at the options, option I is 76%. That should be the correct answer.

As of 2013, the share of people in India who think political parties are corrupt is 76%. This is based on data from Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer around that time.
