Okay, so I've got this problem about a bi-convex lens. Hmm, I remember that a bi-convex lens is a converging lens because both surfaces are curved outward. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, converging lenses are convex. So a bi-convex is definitely a converging lens.

The problem says the lens has a radius of curvature of magnitude 20 cm. Wait, I think each radius is 20 cm. So R1 and R2 are both 20 cm. But for a bi-convex lens made of glass with both surfaces convex, the formula for the focal length is... Oh right, the lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). Wait no, wait. Wait, no—because R is positive for convex towards the incoming light. Oh wait, the sign conventions can be tricky.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n-1)[(1/R1) - (1/R2)], where R1 is the radius of the first surface the light hits, and R2 is the second surface. But for a bi-convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive because the surfaces are convex. So R1 and R2 are both 20 cm. So substituting in, 1/f = (n-1)(1/20 - 1/20). Wait, no, because R1 is positive, R2 is negative? Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The standard formula uses signs based on the direction the surface is facing. For a lens, R1 is the radius of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of the second. If the lens is bi-convex, both R1 and R2 are positive because each surface is convex outward. Oh wait, no. Wait, the formula I'm thinking of is 1/f = (n-1)[ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ] when both R are positive. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the correct lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]. Oh wait, no, I think I mixed it up. Oh wait, wait. I think the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but for a double convex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative because the second surface is concave when viewed from the inside? No, that's not right. Wait, no, for a bi-convex lens, the second radius is also positive because it's convex. So let me think again.

Actually, the lensmaker's formula for a lens in air is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ), but wait no. Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me look it up mentally. Oh right, the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ) ] when the lens is symmetric. Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong. Another approach: for a double convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive. So R1 is the radius of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of the second surface. Wait, but in the formula, it's 1/R1 minus 1/R2. So if both are positive, for a convex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative? Or is R2 positive?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of a plano-convex lens. For a plano-convex lens, one side is flat (so R2 is infinite, 1/R2 is zero). The other side is convex with radius R. So the formula becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R). So in that case, R1 is positive, R2 is infinite (so 1/R2 is 0), and 1/f is positive, which is correct.

Wait, so for a bi-convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive, but when using the lensmaker's equation, the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ) ]? No, that can't be right because for the plano-convex, that would give 1/f = (n-1)(1/R + 0), which is correct. But for a bi-convex, if both R1 and R2 are positive, then 1/R1 plus 1/R2 would make the focal length smaller. Wait no, no—because R2 is the radius of the second surface, but in the formula, the sign of R2 depends on whether the surface is convex or concave as the light exits the lens.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ), but R1 is positive if the surface is convex on the first side, and R2 is negative if it's convex on the second side. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe when the second surface is convex towards the inside, its radius is considered negative. So for a bi-convex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative.

Wait, no, I think I've got it wrong. Let me think again. The correct formula for the focal length is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where R1 is the radius of the first surface (the one the light hits first), and R2 is the radius of the second surface. For a bi-convex lens, the second surface is also convex, so the radius is positive. Wait, no, because R2 is measured from the second surface, which is convex outward, so the radius is positive. So R1 and R2 are both positive.

Wait, but that would make the equation 1/f = (n-1)( (1/20) - (1/20) ) = 0, which can't be right. That would mean f is infinite, which isn't correct. So I must have the signs wrong. 

Oh wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1)[1/R1 + 1/R2]. Let me see: for a bi-convex lens, R1 and R2 are both positive. So 1/f = (n-1)(1/20 + 1/20) = (n-1)(2/20) ) = (n-1)(1/10). So 1/f = (n-1)/10. So f = 10/(n-1). For glass, n is about 1.5, so f = 10/(0.5) = 20 cm. So the focal length is 20 cm.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the object is placed at 30 cm from the lens, which is beyond the focal length (since f is 20 cm), the image should be real and inverted.

Wait, wait, the object distance is 30 cm. Since the focal length is 20 cm, the object is in the region beyond 2F, so the image should be real, inverted, and diminished. 

So now, let's calculate the image distance using the thin lens formula: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. So 1/di = 1/f - 1/do.

Given do = 30 cm, f = 20 cm.

So 1/di = (1/20) - (1/30) = (3/60 - 2/60) )= 1/60. So di = 60 cm. 

The magnification m is - di/do. So m = -(60)/30 = -2. So the image is inverted (because of the negative) and twice as tall as the object. Wait, wait, the object height is 2 cm. So the image height would be m * h = (-2) * 2 cm = -4 cm. The negative sign indicates inverted, and the magnitude is 4 cm.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that if the object is beyond 2F, the image is between F and 2F on the other side. Wait, no, wait: if do is greater than 2f, the image is between f and 2f, real and inverted, and smaller than the object. But according to the calculation, di is 60 cm, which is beyond 2f (since 2f is 40 cm). Wait, no, no—because f is 20 cm, so 2f is 40 cm. The image distance di is 60 cm, which is beyond 2f? So that can't be right. 

Wait, no, 60 cm is beyond 2f, which would suggest that the image is real, inverted, and larger. But that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the lensmaker's equation. Let me double-check. Oh wait, earlier I thought the focal length was 20 cm, but let's recalculate that.

Wait, the radii for a bi-convex lens are both 20 cm. So R1 is 20 cm, R2 is also 20 cm. But in the lensmaker's equation, the formula is 1/f = (n-1)[(1/R1) - (1/R2)]. Wait, no, that would give (1/20 - 1/20) = 0, which is incorrect. So perhaps I had the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe I had the formula wrong. Another approach: the formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2) ), but that's only if R1 and R2 are both measured the same way. Wait, no. Maybe the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but for a bi-convex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative. Because the second surface is convex to the incoming light, so its radius is considered negative. So R1 = +20 cm, R2 = -20 cm.

Wait, that makes sense. So substituting into the lensmaker's equation: 1/f = (n-1)(1/20 - (-1/20)) ) = (n-1)(2/20) = (n-1)(1/10). So 1/f = (1.5 -1)/10 = 0.5/10 = 0.05. So f = 1/0.05 = 20 cm. So f is 20 cm, same as before.

So with do =30 cm, which is greater than f (20 cm), then image is real. Now, using 1/f =1/do +1/di: 1/di = 1/f -1/do = (1/20) - (1/30) = (3-2)/60 = 1/60. So di = 60 cm.

m = -di/do = -60/30 = -2. So the image height is m * h = -2 * 2 cm = -4 cm. Negative indicates inverted, so the image is 4 cm tall. 

Wait, but the options don't have 4 cm. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: Real, upright, 1 cm

B: Virtual, upright, 2 cm

C: Real, inverted, 0.5 cm

D: Real, upright, 2 cm

E: Real, inverted, 1 cm

F: Virtual, upright, 1 cm

G: Virtual, upright, 0.25 cm

H: Virtual, inverted, 0.25 cm

I: Virtual, inverted, 1 cm

J: Real, inverted, 2 cm

Hmm, none of the options have 4 cm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the object's height is 2 cm, and magnification is -2, so image height is -4 cm. But that's not among the choices. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the focal length calculation. Let me try again. For a bi-convex lens, R1 and R2 are both 20 cm. So using the correct lensmaker's equation.

Wait, another approach: for a symmetric bi-convex lens, the radii R1 and R2 are equal. So in the formula, 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2 ). Wait, but R1 and R2 are both positive? Or does R2 have a negative sign because it's the second surface?

Ah, I think I see where I went wrong. The correct formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ), but with the signs based on the surface orientation. For a convex lens, R1 is positive, and R2 is negative because the second surface is convex when viewed from the inside of the lens. Wait, no—actually, in the lensmaker's formula, the sign of R2 is negative if the surface is concave towards the incoming light, and positive if convex. Wait, no, that's the opposite. Let me get this clear.

In the lensmaker's equation, each radius is considered positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light and negative if concave. So for a bi-convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive because both surfaces are convex when light is approaching from the left. Wait, no, for a double convex lens, the first surface is convex (R1 positive), the second surface is also convex, but when light exits the lens, the curvature is opposite. So the radius R2 is positive as well. 

Wait, wait, actually, no. Let me think of the lens as having two surfaces. The first surface is convex, so R1 is positive. The second surface is also convex, but when the light exits the lens, it's convex in the same direction as the first surface. So R2 is positive as well. So when you plug into the formula, it's 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ) ].

Wait, no, no. I think I've got this wrong. The correct formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ), where R1 is the radius of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of the second. So if the lens is biconvex, both R1 and R2 are positive. So substituting R1=20, R2=20:

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/20) - (1/20) ) ] = 0. So f is infinite. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a lens is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ), where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature, with R1 positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light, and R2 positive if the second surface is convex towards the outgoing light. Wait, but in a biconvex lens, both surfaces are convex towards the incoming side. So for the first surface, R1 is positive, and for the second, R2 is positive as well. So the equation becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2). So 1/f = (1.5-1) (1/20 + 1/20 ) = 0.5*(2/20) )= 0.5*(0.1) )= 0.05. So f = 20 cm. So that's correct.

So now, the object is placed at 30 cm from the lens, which is beyond f=20 cm. So using the thin lens formula, 1/do +1/di =1/f. do is 30 cm, f is 20 cm.

1/di = 1/f -1/do = (1/20) - (1/30) = (3/60 - 2/60) )= 1/60. So di =60 cm. 

So the image is real because di is positive, and it's on the opposite side of the lens.

The magnification m is -di/do = -60/30 = -2. So the image is inverted (negative) and twice as tall as the object. The object is 2 cm tall, so image is 4 cm tall. 

Wait, but the options don't have 4 cm. So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again. Did I miscalculate the magnification? Maybe the object is placed at 30 cm, which is beyond 2f (which is 40 cm), no—because 2f is 40 cm, and 30 is less than that. Oh wait, 30 cm is between f (20 cm) and 2f (40 cm). So when the object is between f and 2f, the image is real, inverted, and larger than the object. Wait, but in that case, di would be between 2f and infinity. Wait no, no—when the object is between f and 2f, di is between 2f and infinity. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, let's get back. Thin lens formula: when do > 2f, image is between f and 2f, real, inverted, smaller.

When f < do < 2f, image is beyond 2f, real, inverted, larger.

When do < f, image is virtual, upright, larger.

So in this case, do is 30 cm, which is greater than f=20 cm but less than 2f=40 cm. So the image should be real, inverted, and larger than the object. So image height should be larger than 2 cm. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the focal length.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the lensmaker's equation. Let me check again. If R1 is 20 cm and R2 is 20 cm, but perhaps R2 is negative because it's convex on the opposite side. So using 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ), but R2 is negative.

Wait, no. For a biconvex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive because both surfaces are convex when approached by the incoming light. So 1/f = (n-1)(1/20 + 1/20) = (n-1)(2/20) )= (n-1)(1/10).

So with n=1.5, 1/f = 0.5*(1/
