Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Wherever I go—the street, the shop, the house, or the steamboat—I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they are yet unable to conceive of the Negro as possessing any rights at all. Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'
"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate."
—Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865

Okay, so I've got this question here about Federalist #15 and what Hamilton proposed to address the problems mentioned. Let me try to break this down. 

First, I remember that the Federalist Papers were written by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay to support the ratification of the US Constitution. Each paper addresses different topics. So, Federalist #15 must be about specific issues Hamilton was concerned with.

I think Federalist #15 is titled something like "The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Provide for the General Welfare." That sounds about right. In this paper, Hamilton talks about the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. The main issues were that the Confederation couldn't effectively govern because it lacked the power to tax, regulate commerce, or enforce laws. So the government was weak, and the country was suffering because of it.

The question is asking what Hamilton proposed to fix these problems. Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with Hamilton's solutions. 

Option A talks about banning the slave trade. But I don't think that's related to the main points of Federalist #15. Hamilton's focus was more on governmental structure and economic stability, not directly on slavery. 

Option B is about federal taxation. That makes sense because under the Articles, the federal government couldn't tax. Hamilton wanted a stronger central government that could levy taxes to support the nation, so this could be a possibility.

Option C is industrialization and urbanization. While Hamilton did support a strong industrial base and wrote the Report on Manufactures, that's more about economic policy than addressing the Confederation's weaknesses directly in Federalist #15.

Option D is a national education system. I don't recall education being a focus in Federalist #15. That's more of a modern issue perhaps.

Option E is about alliances with Native Americans. Again, not directly related to the structural issues Hamilton was addressing.

Option F is establishing a national bank. Hamilton was a big proponent of a national bank, but that's more about economic policy and might come up in other Federalist papers or his later work, not so much in #15.

Option G is a bill of rights. Actually, the Bill of Rights was added later as amendments, but I don't think that's what Hamilton was pushing in Federalist #15. He was more about a strong central government, so maybe not.

Option H is about military spending and cutting social programs. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think that's part of the solution proposed in #15.

Option I is adopting a new constitution for a more national government. Oh, that fits! Because Federalist #15 was arguing for why the Articles of Confederation weren't working and the need for a stronger central government, which would be the Constitution. So Hamilton was pushing for a new constitutional framework.

Option J is about foreign policy. While foreign policy was a concern, the specific problem in #15 was about the structure of government, not foreign intervention.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option I: adopting a new constitution to create a more national government.
