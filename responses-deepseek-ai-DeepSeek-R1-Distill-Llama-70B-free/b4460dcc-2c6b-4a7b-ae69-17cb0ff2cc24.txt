Okay, so I need to figure out how many push-ups Michelle did in January. The question says there are 31 days in January, and she did 45 push-ups each day. She used the expression 31 multiplied by 45 to find the total number. My task is to calculate that and pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the multiplication. 31 times 45. I remember that multiplying two-digit numbers can be done by breaking them down into tens and ones. So, 31 can be thought of as 30 + 1, and 45 as 40 +5, but maybe it's easier to do it step by step.

Another way is to multiply 30 by 45 and then add 1 times 45. Because 31 is 30 +1. So 30*45 plus 1*45. Let me calculate that.

First, 30*45. Well, 30 times 40 is 1200, and 30 times 5 is 150. So 1200 + 150 is 1350. Then, 1*45 is 45. So adding those together, 1350 +45 is 1395. So the total should be 1395 push-ups.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I make addition errors. 30*45 is definitely 1350. Then adding 45 more makes it 1395. Okay, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,395 push-ups. So that's the one I should choose. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. 31*45: 30*45 is 1350, plus 45 gives 1395. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: 1,395 push-ups.
