Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate their truthfulness. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1 says: As of 2020, some models attain greater than 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10.

Hmm, I remember that CIFAR-10 is a benchmark dataset for image classification. It has 10 classes. I think models like ResNet have been pretty successful on it. I recall that in the original ResNet paper, they achieved around 95% accuracy or so. But wait, that was a few years back. Since then, models have improved. I've heard about things like EfficientNets or other architectures pushing the boundaries. Oh right, there's also stuff like data augmentation, which can really boost performance. So by 2020, I think it's plausible that some models, maybe with deeper architectures or better training techniques, can get above 98% on CIFAR-10. So I'm leaning towards Statement 1 being true.

Statement 2: The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer.

Wait, the original ResNet paper was from 2015, right? Around that time, I think the most common optimizer was SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with momentum. Adam optimizer, which is a type of adaptive learning rate method, was introduced a bit later, maybe around 2014 or 2015. But when ResNet came out, did they use Adam? I'm trying to remember. I think in the original ResNet paper, they used SGD with momentum, not Adam. So yes, the original ResNets were not optimized with Adam. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but some sources might say that some variants or later implementations used Adam, but the original paper didn't. So Statement 2 is correct.

So both statements are true. Looking at the options:

Option G says both are true. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. On the CIFAR-10 accuracy, I'm pretty sure that as of 2020, models like Shake-Shake (which might have achieved 98%?) or maybe even higher. Also, EfficientNet models, which were introduced around that time, probably have higher accuracy. So yes, Statement 1 is true.

And again, the original ResNet used SGD, not Adam. So Statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true, which is option G.
</think>

The correct answer is based on evaluating both statements:

1. **Statement 1** is true because, as of 2020, models like EfficientNets and others achieved greater than 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10.
2. **Statement 2** is true because the original ResNet paper used SGD with momentum, not the Adam optimizer.

Both statements are true, so the correct option is:

G: True, True

G
