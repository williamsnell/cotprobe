Okay, so I have this physics problem about a damped harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that after four cycles, the amplitude drops to 1/e of its initial value. I need to find the ratio of the frequency of the damped oscillator to its natural frequency. The options are given from A to I.

Wait, I remember that a damped harmonic oscillator has an amplitude that decreases exponentially over time. The formula for the amplitude as a function of time is something like A(t) = A0 * e^(-β t), where β is the damping coefficient. And the frequency of the damped oscillator is different from the natural frequency. Oh right, the natural frequency is ω0, and the damped frequency ω is sqrt(ω0² - β²). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Or is it sqrt(ω0² - β²) only under certain conditions?

Wait, let me think again. The equation of motion for a damped harmonic oscillator is m d²x/dt² + b dx/dt + kx = 0. If we rewrite this, substituting ω0² = k/m and 2β = b/m, then the equation becomes d²x/dt² + 2β dx/dt + ω0² x = 0. The solution depends on whether the system is underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped. Since we're talking about oscillations, it's underdamped, so ω_damped = sqrt(ω0² - β²).

Wait, but in terms of the damping coefficient, there's another expression. Oh right, the amplitude decreases as e^(-β t), and the period of the oscillations is T = 2π/ω_damped. So each cycle, the amplitude drops by a factor of e^(-β T), because time increases by T each cycle.

So the amplitude after n cycles would be A(t) = A0 * e^(-β n T). Wait, because each cycle adds another multiplication by e^(-β T), since T is the period. So after four cycles, the amplitude is (1/e) of the initial. So A(t)/A0 = 1/e = e^(-4 β T). So that implies that 4 β T = 1.

Wait, let me write that down.

1/e = e^(-4 β T) → ln(1/e) = -4 β T → -1 = -4 β T → 4 β T = 1 → β T = 1/4.

But T is the period of the damped oscillator, which is T = 2π/ω_damped. So substituting:

β * (2π/ω_damped) ) = 1/4 → 2π β / ω_damped = 1/4 → ω_damped = 8 π β.

Hmm, wait. But I'm trying to find the ratio of ω_damped to ω0. So I need to express ω_damped in terms of ω0.

Wait, I also know that ω_damped = sqrt(ω0² - β²). So let's write that:

ω_damped = sqrt(ω0² - β²) → ω_damped² = ω0² - β² → β² = ω0² - ω_damped².

But from earlier, ω_damped = 8 π β → let's square both sides: ω_damped² = (8 π β)^2 → ω_damped² = 64 π² β².

Substituting into the equation for β²:

β² = ω0² - ω_damped² → β² = ω0² - (64 π² β²) → β² + 64 π² β² = ω0² → β² (1 + 64 π²) = ω0².

So β² = ω0² / (1 + 64 π²) → β = ω0 / sqrt(1 + 64 π²).

Wait, but I need to find the ratio ω_damped / ω0. Let's compute that.

ω_damped = 8 π β = 8 π * [ω0 / sqrt(1 + 64 π²)].

So ω_damped / ω0 = 8 π / sqrt(1 + 64 π²) → 8 π / sqrt(64 π² + 1).

Wait, that looks like option I. Let me check the options:

Option I is (8 π) / sqrt(64 π² +1).

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the ratio is 8 π / sqrt(64 π² +1), which is option I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the damped harmonic oscillator. The amplitude decreases exponentially over time, following the formula:

\[
A(t) = A_0 e^{-\beta t},
\]

where \( \beta \) is the damping coefficient. After four cycles, the amplitude drops to \( 1/e \) of its initial value. Using the exponential decay formula:

\[
\frac{A(t)}{A_0} = \frac{1}{e} = e^{-4 \beta T},
\]

where \( T \) is the period of the damped oscillator. Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{e}\right) = -4 \beta T \implies -1 = -4 \beta T \implies 4 \beta T = 1 \implies \beta T = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The period of the damped oscillator is related to its frequency \( \omega_{\text{damped}} \) by:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_{\text{damped}}}.
\]

Substituting this into \( \beta T = \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
\beta \cdot \frac{2\pi}{\omega_{\text{damped}}} = \frac{1}{4} \implies \omega_{\text{damped}} = 8\pi\beta.
\]

Next, we relate \( \omega_{\text{damped}} \) to the natural frequency \( \omega_0 \). For a damped harmonic oscillator:

\[
\omega_{\text{damped}} = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\omega_{\text{damped}}^2 = \omega_0^2 - \beta^2 \implies \beta^2 = \omega_0^2 - \omega_{\text{damped}}^2.
\]

From \( \omega_{\text{damped}} = 8\pi\beta \), we square to get:

\[
\omega_{\text{damped}}^2 = (8\pi\beta)^2 = 64\pi^2\beta^2.
\]

Substituting into \( \beta^2 = \omega_0^2 - \omega_{\text{damped}}^2 \):

\[
\beta^2 = \omega_0^2 - 64\pi^2\beta^2 \implies \beta^2(1 + 64\pi^2) = \omega_0^2 \implies \beta^2 = \frac{\omega_0^2}{1 + 64\pi^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\beta = \frac{\omega_0}{\sqrt{1 + 64\pi^2}}.
\]

Finally, substituting \( \beta = \frac{\omega_0}{\sqrt{1 + 64\pi^2}} \) into \( \omega_{\text{damped}} = 8\pi\beta \):

\[
\omega_{\text{damped}} = 8\pi \cdot \frac{\omega_0}{\sqrt{1 + 64\pi^2}} \implies \frac{\omega_{\text{damped}}}{\omega_0} = \frac{8\pi}{\sqrt{1 + 64\pi^2}}.
\]

This matches option **I**, which is:

\[
\frac{8\pi}{\sqrt{64\pi^2 + 1}}.
\]
