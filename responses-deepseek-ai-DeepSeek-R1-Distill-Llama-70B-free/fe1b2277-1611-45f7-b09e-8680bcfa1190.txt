Okay, so I've got this question about the House of Representatives, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me think through each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is true about the House of Representatives. The options are A through D.

Option A says all revenue bills must originate in the Senate before moving to the House. Wait, I remember something about revenue bills starting in the House. Like, the Constitution says that all bills for raising revenue must begin in the House. So if A is saying they start in the Senate, that's probably wrong. So A is incorrect.

Option B states that representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while the Senate's is proportional to population. Hmm, no, that's the opposite of how it works. The House is proportional based on population, so states with more people have more representatives. The Senate is equal, with two per state regardless of population. So B is incorrect because it's reversed.

Option C claims the Speaker of the House has less power than the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wait, the Speaker is one of the most powerful people in Congress. They're the leader of the majority party in the House and have a lot of influence over legislation and procedures. The president pro tempore is usually the longest-serving member of the majority party in the Senate, but their role is more ceremonial compared to the Speaker. So the Speaker definitely wields more power than the pro tempore. So C is incorrect.

Option D says the House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not. I think that's correct. The Committee on Ways and Means is a major committee in the House that deals with taxes, trade, and revenue. The Senate doesn't have a committee with that exact name; instead, they have the Committee on Finance, which handles similar issues but isn't called Ways and Means. So D is correct.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. I'm pretty sure the House's Ways and Means is a key committee for taxation, and the Senate's equivalent is Finance. So yes, D is the correct answer.

The correct answer is D.

The House of Representatives has a Committee on Ways and Means, which handles matters related to taxation and revenue, while the Senate does not have a committee by that name; instead, it has the Committee on Finance. 

Answer: D
