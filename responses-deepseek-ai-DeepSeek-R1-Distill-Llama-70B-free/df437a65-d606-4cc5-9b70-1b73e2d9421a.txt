Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about garden peas. I'm a bit rusty on my Mendelian genetics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about predicting the genotypic and phenotypic results of four different crosses (a to d). Each option gives different outcomes, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let's start by understanding each part of the question.

(a) is a tall (homozygous dominant) plant crossed with a dwarf plant. Wait, tall is dominant, right? So the tall plant must be homozygous, which would mean it's DD. The dwarf, being recessive, should be dd. So when you cross DD (tall) with dd (dwarf), all the offspring would get D from the tall parent and d from the dwarf. So all the progeny would be Dd. Phenotype-wise, since D is dominant, they'd all be tall. So for (a), all Dd and all tall.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E says (a) All Dd, All tall. That matches. So E seems correct for part (a). Let me check others quickly: option A says all dd, which can't be right because one parent is DD. Option J says all DD, which would only happen if both parents were DD, which they aren't.

So (a) is done. Now (b) is the progeny of (a) when self-pollinated. So the progeny from (a) are all Dd. When you self-pollinate Dd, you get the classic F1 cross. So Dd x Dd. The Punnett square would give DD (25%), Dd (50%), and dd (25%). So genotypically, it's 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd. Phenotypically, DD and Dd are tall (since dominant D is present), so 75% tall and 25% dwarf.

Looking at the options for (b): Option E says (b) (1/4) DD, (1/2) Dd; (1/4) dd, (3/4) tall; (1/4) dwarf. Wait, wait, wait. No, that's not adding up. Oh wait, let me read it again. Option E (b) is (1/4) DD, (1/2) Dd, (1/4) dd. Phenotype is 3/4 tall, 1/4 dwarf. That's correct because 25% DD (tall), 50% Dd (tall), and 25% dd (dwarf). So 75% tall, 25% dwarf. So yes, (b) in E is correct.

Option E's (b) seems right. So let's move on.

(c) is the progeny of (a) crossed with a homozygous tall plant. Wait, progeny of (a) are Dd. So Dd x DD? Because the homozygous tall is DD. Let me think: Dd x DD. Each parent produces gametes. Dd can produce D and d gametes. DD can only produce D gametes.

So the possible offspring are D (from Dd) + D (from DD) → DD, and d (from Dd) + D → Dd. So 50% DD and 50% Dd. Phenotypically, both are tall because they have at least one D. So 100% tall.

Looking at the options for (c): Option E says (c) (1/2) DD, (1/2) Dd, all tall. Yes, that's correct. So (c) in E is right.

Now (d): progeny of (a) crossed with a dwarf plant. So progeny of (a) are Dd, and dwarf is dd. So Dd x dd. Let's see the gametes. Dd produces D and d, dd produces only d.

So possible offspring: D (from Dd) + d (from dd) → Dd, and d (from Dd) + d → dd. So 50% Dd and 50% dd. Phenotypically, Dd is tall (dominant), dd is dwarf. So 50% tall, 50% dwarf.

Looking at the options for (d): Option E says (d) (1/2) Dd; (1/2) dd, (1/2) tall; (1/2) dwarf. Yes, that's right. So (d) in E is correct.

So putting it all together:

(a) All Dd, all tall.

(b) 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd → 75% tall, 25% dwarf.

(c) 50% DD, 50% Dd → all tall.

(d) 50% Dd, 50% dd → 50% tall, 50% dwarf.

Looking at the options, E fits all four parts. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option G looks similar, but let's see. Option G's (d) says (1/2 Dd; 1/2 dd), all dwarf? No, that can't be right. So E must be the correct answer.

To predict the genotypic and phenotypic results of the given crosses in garden peas, we analyze each part systematically:

### (a) Tall (homozygous dominant, **DD**) × Dwarf (**dd**):
- The tall plant (**DD**) can only produce gametes with **D**.
- The dwarf plant (**dd**) can only produce gametes with **d**.
- All offspring will be **Dd** (heterozygous).
- Phenotype: All tall (since **D** is dominant).
- **Result**: All **Dd**, all tall.

### (b) Progeny of (a) when self-pollinated (**Dd × Dd**):
- **Dd** produces gametes **D** and **d**.
- Punnett square gives: 25% **DD**, 50% **Dd**, 25% **dd**.
- Phenotype: 75% tall (**DD** and **Dd**) and 25% dwarf (**dd**).
- **Result**: (1/4) **DD**, (1/2) **Dd**, (1/4) **dd**; (3/4) tall, (1/4) dwarf.

### (c) Progeny of (a) (**Dd**) × Homozygous tall (**DD**):
- **Dd** produces gametes **D** and **d**.
- **DD** produces only gametes **D**.
- Offspring: 50% **DD**, 50% **Dd**.
- Phenotype: All tall (both **DD** and **Dd** have at least one **D**).
- **Result**: (1/2) **DD**, (1/2) **Dd**; all tall.

### (d) Progeny of (a) (**Dd**) × Dwarf (**dd**):
- **Dd** produces gametes **D** and **d**.
- **dd** produces only gametes **d**.
- Offspring: 50% **Dd**, 50% **dd**.
- Phenotype: 50% tall (**Dd**) and 50% dwarf (**dd**).
- **Result**: (1/2) **Dd**, (1/2) **dd**; (1/2) tall, (1/2) dwarf.

### Matching with the Options:
- **(a)**: All **Dd**, all tall.
- **(b)**: (1/4) **DD**, (1/2) **Dd**, (1/4) **dd**; (3/4) tall, (1/4) dwarf.
- **(c)**: (1/2) **DD**, (1/2) **Dd**; all tall.
- **(d)**: (1/2) **Dd**, (1/2) **dd**; (1/2) tall, (1/2) dwarf.

These results match **Option E**.
