Okay, so I've got this problem here about a circle inscribed in a square. The equation given is 2x² = -2y² + 12x -4y + 20. Hmm, I'm a bit confused because that doesn't look like the standard circle equation I'm used to. Usually, circles are written as (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r², right? So I think my first step is to rearrange this equation into that standard form.

Let me start by moving all the terms to one side to see if I can combine like terms. So the equation is 2x² + 2y² -12x +4y -20 = 0. Wait, because I added 2y² to both sides, right? Let me check that again. Original equation: 2x² = -2y² +12x -4y +20. So if I bring everything to the left, it becomes 2x² + 2y² -12x +4y -20 =0.

Hmm, but I remember that in the standard circle equation, the coefficients of x² and y² are both 1. So maybe I should divide the entire equation by 2 to make it simpler. Let's do that:

x² + y² -6x +2y -10 = 0. Okay, that's better. Now, I can complete the squares for both x and y terms.

Starting with the x terms: x² -6x. To complete the square, I take half of -6, which is -3, square it to get 9. So I'll add and subtract 9.

For the y terms: y² +2y. Half of 2 is 1, square is 1. So I'll add and subtract 1.

Putting it all together:

(x² -6x +9) -9 + (y² +2y +1) -1 -10 = 0.

Simplify this:

(x-3)² + (y+1)² -9 -1 -10 = 0.

That adds up to -20. So,

(x-3)² + (y+1)² = 20.

Wait, so that's a circle with center at (3, -1) and radius sqrt(20). Because the standard form is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r². So r squared is 20, so r is sqrt(20). Which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5), but maybe I don't need to simplify it right now.

Now, the circle is inscribed in a square. So the square touches the circle at exactly four points. When a circle is inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Because the circle just fits perfectly inside, touching the square exactly in the middle of each side.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the circle is inscribed in the square, that means the square is circumscribed around the circle. So the diameter of the circle would equal the side length of the square. Because the square's side must accommodate the circle's diameter. So the diameter is 2r, which is 2*sqrt(20). But wait, sqrt(20) is the radius, so the diameter is 2*sqrt(20), which is the side length of the square.

Wait no, wait. The radius is sqrt(20), so the diameter is 2*sqrt(20). So the square's side length is 2*sqrt(20), which is the diameter. So the area of the square would be (side length)^2, which is (2*sqrt(20)) squared.

Let me calculate that. (2*sqrt(20))^2 = 4 * 20 = 80. So the area is 80. Looking at the options, option G is 80. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the steps.

1. Start with 2x² = -2y² +12x -4y +20.

2. Bring all terms to left: 2x² +2y² -12x +4y -20=0.

3. Divide by 2: x² + y² -6x +2y -10=0.

4. Complete the squares:

x² -6x → (x-3)^2 -9.

y² +2y → (y+1)^2 -1.

So equation becomes (x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 -9 -1 -10 =0 → (x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 =20.

Yes, radius sqrt(20), correct.

Inscribed in square: the diameter is the side length. So diameter is 2*sqrt(20)=2*sqrt(4*5)=2*2*sqrt(5)=4*sqrt(5). So side length is 4√5.

Area is (4√5)^2= 16 *5=80. Yep, so option G is correct.

To determine the area of the square in which the given circle is inscribed, we start with the equation of the circle:

\[
2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20
\]

Rearranging all terms to one side:

\[
2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0
\]

Dividing through by 2 to simplify:

\[
x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 10 = 0
\]

Next, we complete the square for both \(x\) and \(y\):

- For \(x^2 - 6x\), add and subtract \(9\):  
  \[
  (x^2 - 6x + 9) - 9 = (x - 3)^2 - 9
  \]

- For \(y^2 + 2y\), add and subtract \(1\):  
  \[
  (y^2 + 2y + 1) - 1 = (y + 1)^2 - 1
  \]

Substituting these into the equation:

\[
(x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 - 10 = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 20 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20
\]

This is the standard form of a circle with center \((3, -1)\) and radius \(r = \sqrt{20}\). Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle equals the side length of the square. The diameter is:

\[
2r = 2\sqrt{20}
\]

The area of the square is the square of its side length:

\[
(2\sqrt{20})^2 = 4 \cdot 20 = 80
\]

Thus, the area of the square is **80**.
