Question:

Options:

A: ERG theory
B: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
C: Goal-setting Theory
D: Job Characteristics Model
E: Reinforcement Theory
F: two-factor theory
G: Self-Determination Theory
H: expectancy theory
I: Attribution Theory
J: equity theory

Okay, so I've got this question about motivation theories and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The president of a company is worried because her employees have low motivation and satisfaction. So she starts a wage and bonus incentive program. After six months, she notices that motivation and satisfaction haven't improved. The question is asking which theory would best predict this outcome.

Hmm, I remember that different motivation theories suggest different factors that drive employee motivation. Let's go through some of them.

First, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. That theory talks about different levels of needs, from basic to self-actualization. But if the company is offering more money, maybe it's addressing the lower-level needs like safety and security. But if higher-level needs aren't being met, maybe that's why motivation didn't increase. But wait, I'm not sure if Maslow's theory specifically predicts that financial incentives won't work once certain needs are met.

Then there's Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory. Oh right! He said that there are hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors like salary prevent dissatisfaction but don't actually motivate. So if the president only added more financial incentives (a hygiene factor), it might not increase motivation or satisfaction beyond preventing dissatisfaction. So Herzberg's theory would predict that money alone doesn't lead to higher satisfaction or motivation.

ERG Theory by Alderfer is similar to Maslow's but groups needs into existence, relatedness, and growth. Again, if the financial incentives are only addressing existence needs, and the employees' higher needs (like growth) aren't met, motivation wouldn't improve. But I'm not certain if this is the primary theory that addresses this scenario.

Self-Determination Theory talks about intrinsic motivation being driven by autonomy, competence, and relatedness. If the employees aren't getting these, money (extrinsic) might not help. So SDT could also be a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit here.

Expectancy Theory is about the expectation that effort leads to performance, which leads to rewards. If employees don't believe their efforts will lead to the desired outcomes, money won't motivate. But the question doesn't mention anything about employees' expectations about their efforts, so maybe not.

Reinforcement Theory is based on behavior being influenced by rewards or punishments. If the incentives are given, but employees don't see the connection or the reinforcement isn't consistent, it might not work. But again, the question doesn't give specifics about the application of the incentives.

Job Characteristics Model suggests that certain job characteristics (like variety, autonomy) lead to higher motivation. If the president only added financial incentives without changing the job itself, this model would explain the lack of improvement.

So looking back, the two-factor theory says that money is a hygiene factor, not a motivator. So using it to increase motivation beyond preventing dissatisfaction won't work. Therefore, the president's approach wouldn't lead to higher satisfaction or motivation, aligning with Herzberg's theory.

Wait, so the options are F for two-factor theory. The answer should be F.

The president's decision to introduce a wage and bonus program to boost motivation and satisfaction, which ultimately failed, aligns with Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory. This theory distinguishes between hygiene factors (e.g., salary) that prevent dissatisfaction and motivators (e.g., recognition, growth opportunities) that actually enhance motivation. Since financial incentives are hygiene factors, they do not inherently increase satisfaction or motivation. Thus, the outcome is best explained by Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.

Answer: F
