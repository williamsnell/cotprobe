Okay, so I have this question about pleasure and its development from infancy to adolescence, and also about what accounts for humor and situations that make adults smile or laugh. Hmm, I need to choose the right answer from the options A to J.

First, I'll try to break down the question. Let's see, the question is asking three main things: define pleasure, trace its development, and explain humor and smiling/laughter in adults.

Starting with the definition of pleasure. I remember that pleasure is generally considered a positive emotional state. It's often linked to the satisfaction of needs or desires. So, when a person achieves a goal or satisfies a motive, that brings pleasure. That makes sense because when you get something you want, you feel good.

Now, tracing the development from infancy to adolescence. Infants experience pleasure through basic needs like feeding and comfort. As they grow, their understanding and sources of pleasure expand. For example, toddlers might find pleasure in play, exploration, and social interactions. Adolescents then develop more complex sources of pleasure, including intellectual pursuits, social relationships, and personal achievements. So pleasure evolves from physical needs to more psychological and social aspects as a person matures.

Next, what accounts for humor? Humor is often about finding something funny, which can be jokes, situations, or even relief from tension. In adults, humor is a common reason for smiling and laughter. It's usually linked to things like wordplay, sarcasm, witty remarks, or absurd situations. When adults find something amusing, it triggers laughter and smiling as a way to express that pleasure.

So now looking at the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says pleasure is only in childhood and stops in adolescence. That can't be right because adults definitely experience pleasure. Plus, it says adults smile and laugh without humor, just socially. That doesn't make sense because humor is a big part of adult interactions.

Option B suggests laughter is a sign of discomfort. I don't think that's the main reason. Sometimes people laugh when they're nervous, but it's not the primary cause. So this might not be the best answer.

Option C claims pleasure is unchanging from infancy to adulthood. But we know that as people grow, their sources of pleasure change, so this is incorrect.

Option D says smiling indicates fear. That's not right. While people might smile in nervous situations, it's not the same as fear being the main reason for smiling.

Option E defines pleasure as a type of pain. That doesn't make sense because pleasure is a positive feeling, opposite of pain.

Option F says pleasure is a constant physical sensation and humor doesn't relate to smiling. That's not correct because humor does make people smile and laugh, and pleasure isn't just physical.

Option G says pleasure is anxiety relief and adults smile when confused. I think relief can be part of pleasure, but it's not the only cause, and people don't mainly smile because they're confused.

Option H states pleasure is a reaction to satisfying a motive or achieving a goal. Smiling and laughter mainly come from humor like jokes. That aligns with what I thought earlier. Pleasure comes from satisfaction, and humor is a big source in adults.

Option I says pleasure evolves to be purely intellectual and adults laugh from a sense of superiority. While some humor might involve that, not all of it. And pleasure isn't purely intellectual; it can still be physical or emotional.

Option J claims pleasure is just reward anticipation without satisfaction, and adults comply socially. That doesn't fit because pleasure involves actual satisfaction, not just anticipation.

So the best option seems to be H. It correctly defines pleasure, explains its development, and ties humor to smiling and laughter in adults.

The correct answer is:

**H: Pleasure can be defined as a reaction to the satisfaction of a motive or the achievement of a goal. Smiling and laughter in adults mainly occur as a result of humor, usually in the form of jokes, riddles, funny stories, etc.**

This option accurately captures the definition of pleasure, its developmental progression, and the role of humor in adult expressions of smiling and laughter.

Answer: H
