Question:

After having several drinks in a bar, a man and his friend drove by a large home with its lights out. With the man sitting in the passenger seat, the friend pulled the car over. They were feeling drunk and aggressive from the drinks. After discussing it, they decided it was a safe bet to enter the home and see what they could take. They broke in and took several bags of jewelry. While driving away, they were stopped and arrested for burglary. The passenger used the defense that he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to enter the home for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Do the facts described here indicate that the defense will likely prevail at a trial on the merits?

Options:

A: Yes, because the alcohol impaired his judgment, making it impossible for him to make a rational decision.
B: No, because intoxication is never a defense to the commission of a felony.
C: Yes, because the feeling of being drunk and aggressive were not his natural mental state and therefore mens rea was defeated.
D: No, because they had the intent to commit the crime before they even entered the home.
E: Yes, because he was in fact too intoxicated to form the intent needed to prove burglary.
F: Yes, because he was the passenger and not the driver, thus was not directly involved in the act.
G: No, because the act of discussing and deciding to commit the act shows intent, regardless of intoxication.
H: No, because being intoxicated does not diminish the fact that a felony was committed.
I: No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.
J: Yes, because he was under the influence of alcohol and therefore cannot be held responsible for his actions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me start by breaking it down. The scenario is about a man and his friend who went into a home after drinking, took jewelry, and then got arrested for burglary. The passenger is arguing that he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent needed for burglary.

Hmm, I remember that burglary typically requires specific intent. But wait, I think the elements might vary by jurisdiction. Generally, burglary is entering a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. So the intent is crucial here.

Now, the man is using an intoxication defense. I think voluntary intoxication is different from involuntary. Since they were drinking in a bar, it's voluntary. From what I've studied, voluntary intoxication can sometimes be a defense, but it's limited. I believe in some places, it can negate specific intent but not general intent.

So, if burglary requires specific intent, then maybe intoxication could be a defense. But wait, I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might say that even if you're drunk, you can still form the intent. Or maybe the court looks at whether the person was so intoxicated that they couldn't form that intent at all.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A says yes because impaired judgment made rational decision impossible. But I think the law doesn't require rational judgment, just the intent. So being drunk might not excuse it.

Option B says no because intoxication isn't a defense to felony. But that's not right because sometimes it can negate specific intent, so B is incorrect.

Option C says yes because their natural state was altered, so mens rea is defeated. But I think voluntary intoxication doesn't automatically defeat mens rea; it's more about whether the intent was formed.

Option D says no because they intended to commit the crime before entering. Well, the question says they discussed it and decided it was a safe bet. So maybe they had the intent beforehand, but if he was too drunk to form that intent even then, does that matter? Not sure.

Option E says yes because he was too intoxicated. But the question says they were feeling drunk and aggressive, but does that mean he couldn't form intent? The facts don't specify how intoxicated he was, just that they felt drunk. So maybe the court would find that he could still form the intent.

Option F says yes because he was the passenger. But that's about who did what, not about intent. So F doesn't address the intoxication defense, so it's probably wrong.

Option G says no because discussing and deciding shows intent, regardless of intoxication. That sounds right because if they had a discussion and made a decision, it indicates they had the intent. Intoxication might not negate that if the decision was made while sober enough.

Option H says no because intoxication doesn't diminish felony commission. But that's too broad, because as I thought earlier, specific intent might be negated.

Option I says no because the facts don't show he was too intoxicated. The facts say they were feeling drunk and aggressive, but they still had a discussion and made a decision. So maybe the court would find he was capable of forming intent.

Option J says yes because he can't be responsible due to alcohol. But that's not how the law works; voluntary intoxication doesn't completely excuse responsibility, it can only negate specific intent in some cases.

Wait, so the key here is whether the intoxication prevented him from forming the specific intent for burglary. If they were so drunk they couldn't form that intent, then maybe. But the question says they discussed it and decided to enter. That suggests they had the intent. So even if drunk, the fact that they made a decision indicates they had the necessary intent.

So I think the defense won't prevail because their actions show they intended to commit the crime, so intoxication doesn't negate that. So the answer would be either G or I.

Between G and I, G says that the discussion shows intent regardless of intoxication. I think that's a strong point because forming the plan indicates intent. So the answer is probably G, but I'm a bit torn because maybe the intoxication could have prevented the intent.

Wait, but the question is about whether the defense will likely prevail. If the facts show that they planned it, then the intoxication defense might fail because they were capable of planning, showing they had the intent.

So I think the correct answer is G: No, because the act of discussing and deciding shows intent, regardless of intoxication.

The question revolves around whether the passenger's intoxication defense will prevail in a burglary case. Burglary typically requires specific intent to enter a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. The passenger argues that his voluntary intoxication prevented him from forming this specific intent. However, the facts indicate that he and his friend discussed and decided to enter the home, which suggests that they had the requisite intent. 

Voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent, but the key issue here is whether the intoxication was so severe that it prevented the formation of intent. The facts do not indicate that the passenger was so intoxicated that he could not form the intent; rather, they show that he participated in a discussion and decision-making process, which implies that he was capable of forming the necessary intent. Therefore, the defense is unlikely to succeed because the discussion and decision demonstrate intent, regardless of intoxication.

The correct answer is:

G: No, because the act of discussing and deciding to commit the act shows intent, regardless of intoxication.

Answer: G
