Okay, so I've got this question about ice hockey penalties, and I need to figure out which of the options is not a penalty. Let me start by going through each option one by one.

The question is asking which of the following is NOT a penalty. The options are A to J. I'm going to list them out again to make sure I don't miss any:

A: cross-passing
B: charging
C: carving
D: butt-ending
E: stick-checking
F: goal-tending
G: sliding
H: hooking
I: skating
J: puck-handling

Alright, I'm not super familiar with all the hockey terms, but I'll try to think through each one.

First, I know that in hockey, penalties are called when a player breaks the rules, resulting in a stoppage of play and possibly a power play for the opposing team. Common penalties include things like tripping, high-sticking, hooking, and others.

Let's go through each option:

A: Cross-passing. Hmm, I'm not sure what cross-passing is. It doesn't ring a bell as a penalty. Maybe it's a type of pass, like a cross-ice pass? I don't think that's a penalty. Maybe it's a trick question.

B: Charging. I remember that charging is a penalty. It's when a player jumps into a hit or charges at an opponent, often leading with the shoulder or hip. So this is a penalty.

C: Carving. Wait, carving? I'm trying to think. Carving in hockey... Oh wait, maybe it's a term I'm not familiar with. Or perhaps it's a typo. Could it be 'cross-checking'? Because cross-checking is definitely a penalty. But the option says 'carving', which I don't think is a penalty. Alternatively, maybe it's a trick option. I'm not sure yet, so I'll come back to this.

D: Butt-ending. Yes, I'm certain this is a penalty. It's when a player uses the end of their stick (the butt end) to hit another player, usually in the head or body. That's a high-sticking penalty or specifically called butt-ending, and it's definitely against the rules.

E: Stick-checking. I'm not exactly sure about this term. I know there's 'stick-checking' which involves using the stick to check an opponent, but I think that's a legal play as long as it's done correctly. Wait, but if it's done improperly, like slashing or spearing, then it's a penalty. So maybe stick-checking itself isn't a penalty, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's called something else. Hmm.

F: Goal-tending. Goal-tending interference is a penalty, where a player interferes with the goalkeeper's ability to move freely in the crease. So if someone is blocking the goalie without the puck, that's a penalty. So 'goal-tending' might refer to that, making it a penalty.

G: Sliding. I don't think sliding is a penalty. Players often slide on the ice, especially when they're trying to block shots or get into position. Unless it's a slide into another player in a dangerous way, like sliding into the boards or using it to trip someone, but I don't think 'sliding' by itself is a penalty. It's more about how it's done.

H: Hooking. Yes, hooking is a penalty. It's when a player uses the blade of their stick to hook around an opponent's legs or body to slow them down. That's a common call.

I: Skating. Skating is obviously a fundamental part of hockey. As long as it's done within the rules, like not skating into someone from behind or in a dangerous way, it's not a penalty. So skating by itself isn't a penalty.

J: Puck-handling. Puck-handling is a skill in hockey, like stickhandling. It's not a penalty. Players are supposed to handle the puck, so this wouldn't be a penalty.

Now, going back to the options. The question is which is NOT a penalty.

Let's recap:

A: Cross-passing. Not sure, but I don't think it's a penalty. It might be a type of pass, which is a legal play.

B: Charging – Penalty.

C: Carving – Not sure, but I don't recall it as a penalty. Maybe it's a term I'm not familiar with, or perhaps it's a typo for cross-checking, which is a penalty. But as written, 'carving' doesn't sound like a penalty.

D: Butt-ending – Penalty.

E: Stick-checking – I'm a bit confused. Stick-checking can be part of the game, like using the stick to check, but if it's done wrongly, like high-sticking, then it's a penalty. But as a term, 'stick-checking' itself might not be a penalty, but rather a technique. Wait, no, I think that 'stick checking' is a legal play when done correctly, so maybe it's not a penalty. Or perhaps it's a penalty if done in a certain way, but the term alone might not be a penalty.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The options are:

A: cross-passing – I think this is a pass across the ice, not a penalty.

B: charging – Penalty.

C: carving – Not a term I'm familiar with as a penalty.

D: butt-ending – Penalty.

E: stick-checking – Maybe not a penalty, but I'm not certain.

F: goal-tending – If it's about interfering with the goalie, yes, it's a penalty.

G: sliding – Not a penalty on its own.

H: hooking – Penalty.

I: skating – Not a penalty.

J: puck-handling – Not a penalty.

So the question is, which is NOT a penalty. So the possible non-penalties are A, C, E, G, I, J.

But the answer is the one that is not a penalty, so I need to find the one that's definitely not called as a penalty.

Cross-passing: I don't think that's a penalty. It's a type of pass, so no.

Carving: Maybe it's a typo for cross-checking, but as written, it's carving, which I don't think is a penalty.

Stick-checking: If it's a legal play, then it's not a penalty. So perhaps E is not a penalty.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a penalty. So the correct answer would be the one that's not a recognized penalty.

I think the key here is to recognize which of these terms are actual penalties in hockey.

Charging (B) is a penalty.

Butt-ending (D) is a penalty.

Hooking (H) is a penalty.

Goal-tending (F) – if it's about interference, then yes.

So the non-penalties would be A, C, E, G, I, J.

Now, looking at each:

A: Cross-passing – Not a penalty.

C: Carving – I don't think this is a penalty term.

E: Stick-checking – Maybe not a penalty, but I'm not 100% sure.

G: Sliding – Not a penalty.

I: Skating – Not a penalty.

J: Puck-handling – Not a penalty.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a penalty. So the correct answer is the one that is not in the list of penalties.

Looking back, cross-passing (A) is likely not a penalty.

Carving (C) doesn't sound like a penalty.

Stick-checking (E): I'm not sure. Maybe it's a penalty, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, 'stick-checking' might refer to using the stick to check, which is part of the game, so not a penalty.

Wait, perhaps stick-checking is a penalty. I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, I think that 'stick-checking' isn't a standard penalty term. More common penalties are hooking, holding, tripping, high-sticking, etc.

Wait, maybe 'stick-checking' refers to checking with the stick, which can be legal if done correctly, but if done improperly, like slashing, then it's a penalty. So perhaps 'stick-checking' as a term isn't a penalty on its own.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should focus on the options I'm more certain about.

I think the answer is A: cross-passing, because I don't recall that being a penalty.

Wait, but another angle: the question might be testing knowledge of specific penalties. Let me think about each option again.

Cross-passing: Probably not a penalty. It's a type of pass.

Carving: Not a penalty term I'm aware of.

Stick-checking: Not sure, but I think it's not a penalty.

But perhaps the correct answer is I: skating, because skating is a fundamental movement and not a penalty.

Wait, no, the question is which is NOT a penalty, so all except one are penalties. Wait, no, the question is which is NOT a penalty, so only one option is not a penalty.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A: cross-passing – Not a penalty.

B: charging – Penalty.

C: carving – Not a penalty? Or maybe it's a typo for cross-checking, which is a penalty.

Wait, cross-checking is a penalty, so if option C was cross-checking, it would be a penalty. But it says 'carving', which I'm not familiar with as a penalty.

So, if I have to choose between A, C, E, G, I, J as non-penalties, but the question is which is NOT a penalty, so only one of these is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking. Because I think that stick-checking is actually a penalty. Wait, no, stick-checking as in using the stick to check, which could be legal. Alternatively, maybe 'stick-checking' isn't a formal penalty term, but 'checking' is allowed as long as it's done correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: cross-passing, because that's not a penalty.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of other options.

Another approach: look for the options that are definitely penalties, and the one that's not.

I know that charging, butt-ending, hooking, and goal-tending interference are penalties.

So B, D, H, F are penalties.

So the non-penalties are among A, C, E, G, I, J.

Now, from these, which is not a penalty.

I think cross-passing (A) is not a penalty. Carving (C) isn't a penalty term I know. Stick-checking (E) might not be a penalty. Sliding (G) isn't a penalty. Skating (I) isn't a penalty. Puck-handling (J) isn't a penalty.

Wait, but the question is which is not a penalty. So the correct answer is the one that is not a recognized penalty.

I think the answer is A: cross-passing.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about each term again.

Cross-passing: A pass from one side of the ice to the other. Not a penalty.

Carving: Maybe it's a term related to skating, like carving a turn, but not a penalty.

Stick-checking: Using the stick to check, which can be legal, but if done improperly, like high-sticking, it's a penalty. But as a term, 'stick-checking' itself isn't a penalty.

Wait, perhaps 'stick-checking' refers to a legal action, so it's not a penalty.

Alternatively, 'stick-checking' might not be a recognized term, making it the non-penalty.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking, because I don't think that's a penalty. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I'm more confident that cross-passing (A) is not a penalty.

Wait, another thought: the term 'cross-passing' might not even be correct. Maybe it's a 'cross-ice pass', which is a type of pass and not a penalty.

So, putting it all together, the options that are definitely penalties are B, D, F, H.

The options that are not penalties are A, C, E, G, I, J.

But the question is which one is NOT a penalty. So the correct answer is one of these.

Looking back, the answer options are A to J, and I need to pick one.

I think the correct answer is A: cross-passing, because it's a type of pass and not a penalty.

Another option could be C: carving, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to eliminate.

I know that 'butt-ending' (D) is a penalty. 'Charging' (B) is a penalty. 'Hooking' (H) is a penalty. 'Goal-tending' (F) is a penalty if it's interference.

So the non-penalties are A, C, E, G, I, J.

Now, which of these is not a penalty.

I think 'carving' (C) is not a penalty. It's possible that the term is made up or not a recognized penalty.

Alternatively, 'cross-passing' (A) is not a penalty.

But I'm more confident that cross-passing isn't a penalty, so I'll go with A.

Wait, but another angle: maybe 'stick-checking' (E) is not a penalty. Because stick checking is a legal play when done correctly. So perhaps E is not a penalty.

Wait, but I'm not sure. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: skating, because skating is a basic movement, not a penalty.

Wait, no, the question is which is NOT a penalty. So all except one are penalties.

Wait, no, the question is which is NOT a penalty, so only one of the options is not a penalty.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

The options are:

A: cross-passing – Not a penalty.

B: charging – Penalty.

C: carving – Not a penalty.

D: butt-ending – Penalty.

E: stick-checking – Not sure, but possibly not a penalty.

F: goal-tending – Penalty.

G: sliding – Not a penalty.

H: hooking – Penalty.

I: skating – Not a penalty.

J: puck-handling – Not a penalty.

So the possible non-penalties are A, C, E, G, I, J.

But the question is, which is not a penalty. So the answer must be one of these.

I think the most likely one is A: cross-passing, because I don't recall that being a penalty.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each term.

Cross-passing: Not a penalty.

Carving: Not a penalty.

Stick-checking: Not a penalty.

Sliding: Not a penalty.

Skating: Not a penalty.

Puck-handling: Not a penalty.

Wait, but all these are not penalties. But the question is, which is not a penalty, so only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking, because I think that's a legal action.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: cross-passing.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is A: cross-passing.

In ice hockey, penalties are called when a player breaks the rules, resulting in a stoppage of play. The question asks which of the given options is NOT a penalty. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **A: Cross-passing**  
  Cross-passing refers to a type of pass in hockey, typically across the ice. It is not a penalty and is a legal play.

- **B: Charging**  
  Charging is a penalty. It occurs when a player jumps into a hit or charges at an opponent, often leading with the shoulder or hip.

- **C: Carving**  
  Carving is not a recognized penalty in hockey. It may refer to a skating technique or a term unrelated to penalties.

- **D: Butt-ending**  
  Butt-ending is a penalty. It involves using the butt end of the stick to hit an opponent, often in the head or body.

- **E: Stick-checking**  
  Stick-checking can be a legal play when done correctly. However, if done improperly (e.g., slashing or spearing), it can become a penalty. As a standalone term, it is not inherently a penalty.

- **F: Goal-tending**  
  Goal-tending interference is a penalty. It occurs when a player interferes with the goalkeeper's ability to move freely in the crease.

- **G: Sliding**  
  Sliding is not a penalty. Players often slide on the ice, and it is only penalized if done dangerously (e.g., sliding into another player or the boards).

- **H: Hooking**  
  Hooking is a penalty. It involves using the blade of the stick to hook around an opponent's legs or body to slow them down.

- **I: Skating**  
  Skating is a fundamental part of hockey and is not a penalty as long as it is done within the rules.

- **J: Puck-handling**  
  Puck-handling is a skill in hockey and is not a penalty. It is a legal and essential part of the game.

From this analysis, the options that are not penalties are **A: Cross-passing**, **C: Carving**, **E: Stick-checking**, **G: Sliding**, **I: Skating**, and **J: Puck-handling**. However, the question asks for the single best answer. Among these, **A: Cross-passing** is the most clearly not a penalty, as it is a common and legal play in hockey.

**Answer: A**
