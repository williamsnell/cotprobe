Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the mean weight of a sample of rats. The weights given are 2 lbs, 3 lbs, 6 lbs, 8 lbs, and 9 lbs. Hmm, mean weight, right. I remember that the mean is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values.

First, I need to sum up all the weights. Let's see, 2 plus 3 is 5. Then 5 plus 6 is 11. Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step to avoid mistakes. So, 2 + 3 = 5. Then 5 + 6 = 11. Next, 11 + 8 is 19, and then 19 + 9 is 28. So the total sum is 28 lbs.

Now, how many rats are there? Let me count the numbers: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9. That's five numbers, so five rats. So the mean is the total sum divided by the number of rats. That would be 28 divided by 5.

Let me calculate that. 28 divided by 5 equals... 5 times 5 is 25, which leaves a remainder of 3. So 5.6? Because 5.6 times 5 is 28. Let me check: 5 times 5 is 25, 0.6 times 5 is 3, so 25+3=28. Yes, that checks out.

So the mean weight is 5.6 lbs. Now, looking at the options provided: option F is 5.6 lbs. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait a second, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me verify the sum again. 2+3 is 5, plus 6 is 11, plus 8 is 19, plus 9 is 28. Correct. Number of rats is 5. 28 divided by 5 is indeed 5.6. Yep, I'm confident now.

The mean weight is calculated by summing the weights and dividing by the number of rats. The weights are 2 lbs, 3 lbs, 6 lbs, 8 lbs, and 9 lbs. 

Summing these gives \(2 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 28\) lbs. There are 5 rats, so the mean is \(28 \div 5 = 5.6\) lbs. 

The correct answer is option F: 5.6 lbs.

F
