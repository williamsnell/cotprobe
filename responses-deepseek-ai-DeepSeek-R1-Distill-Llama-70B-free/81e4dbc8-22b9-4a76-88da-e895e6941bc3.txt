Okay, so I've got this problem about ionic conductivities, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the equivalent conductance of an electrolytic solution is 0.0412 m²/(Ω·mol), and the transport number t_+ is 0.825. I need to find the contributions of the individual ions' conductivities, lambda_+ and lambda_-.

Hmm, I remember that the equivalent conductance (Λm) is the sum of the individual ionic conductances. So Λm = λ_+ + λ_-. That makes sense because each ion contributes to the total conductance.

Wait, but also, the transport number t_+ is the fraction of the total current carried by the positive ions. Oh right, the transport number t_+ is equal to (λ_+) / (λ_+ + λ_-). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? No, wait. The transport number is the ratio of the positive ion's conductivity to the total. So t_+ = λ_+ / (λ_+ + λ_-).

So given that, I can set up equations. Let's denote λ_+ as the positive ion's conductance and λ_- as the negative's. Then:

Equation 1: λ_+ + λ_- = Λm = 0.0412 m²/(Ω·mol)
Equation 2: λ_+ / (λ_+ + λ_-) = t_+ = 0.825

Wait, but equation 1 is just the same as equation 2's denominator. So substituting equation 1 into equation 2 gives:

λ_+ / 0.0412 = 0.825

So solving for λ_+, I get λ_+ = 0.825 * 0.0412. Let me calculate that. 0.825 multiplied by 0.0412. Hmm, 0.8 times 0.0412 is 0.03296, and 0.025 times 0.0412 is 0.00103. Adding them together gives roughly 0.03296 + 0.00103 = 0.034. Wait, wait, let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 0.825 * 0.0412. Let's compute that:

0.8 * 0.0412 = 0.03296
0.02 * 0.0412 = 0.000824
0.005 * 0.0412 = 0.000206
Adding 0.03296 + 0.000824 = 0.033784, plus 0.000206 gives 0.03399. Oh wait, that's 0.03399 m²/(Ω·mol).

So λ_+ is approximately 0.03399, and since the total is 0.0412, λ_- would be 0.0412 - 0.03399 = 0.00721 m²/(Ω·mol).

Now, looking at the options:

Option I says λ_+ = 0.03399 and λ_- = 0.00721. That matches my calculations.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option A: λ_+ is 0.00721, which is the same as my λ_-. So that's the opposite. Not correct.

Option B: λ_+ is 0.825, but that's way larger than the total conductance, which is 0.0412. Impossible.

Option C: λ_+ is 0.034, λ_- is 0.0072. That's close to what I have, but wait, I calculated λ_+ as 0.03399, which is approximately 0.034. So option C would have λ_+ as 0.034 and λ_- as 0.0072. But looking back, the total is 0.0412, so 0.034 + 0.0072 = 0.0412, yes. But wait, I thought I had 0.03399, which is 0.034 when rounded to three decimal places. So option C is 0.034 and 0.0072, which would match, but let me check the options again.

Wait, option I has λ_+ as 0.03399 and λ_- as 0.00721. So it's more precise, perhaps. But let me see the options.

Wait, option C: λ_+ = 0.0340 and λ_- = 0.0072. That's four significant figures for λ_+, but my calculation was 0.03399, which is approximately 0.0340 when rounded to four decimal places. So maybe option C is correct. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the given data has Λm as 0.0412, which is four significant figures, and t_+ is 0.825, which is three. So in the calculations, λ_+ would be based on three sig figs. Let me compute 0.825 * 0.0412.

0.825 * 0.0412: Let's compute it precisely. 825 * 412 = let's see.

Wait, 825 * 400 = 330000, 825 *12=9900. So 330000 +9900=339900. Then, since both numbers have 3 and 3 decimal places respectively, total of 6 decimal places. So 0.825 is three decimal places, 0.0412 is four. Wait, no: 0.825 has 3 decimal places? Wait, no, 0.825 is three significant figures, but in terms of decimal places, it's three. 0.0412 is four significant figures, three decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I should just multiply 0.825 by 0.0412.

0.825 × 0.0412:

Compute 825 × 412 = let's see:

825 × 400 = 330,000

825 × 12 = 9,900

Total 339,900.

Now, 825 has three digits, 412 has three digits, so total 6 digits. So 825 × 412 = 339900.

But since 0.825 has 3 decimal places and 0.0412 has 4, the product will have 3+4=7 decimal places? Wait, no, the rule is that when multiplying, the number of decimal places is the sum. So 0.825 (3 decimals) × 0.0412 (4 decimals) = 7 decimals.

Wait, but 825 × 412 is 339900. So 0.825 × 0.0412 = 339900 × 1e-7 (since 0.825 is 825e-3 and 0.0412 is 412e-4; when multiplied, it's 825×412 × 1e-7).

So 339900 × 1e-7 = 0.03399 exactly.

So λ_+ is 0.03399 m²/(Ω·mol), and λ_- is 0.0412 - 0.03399 = 0.00721.

Looking back at the options:

Option I: λ_+ = 0.03399, λ_- = 0.00721. Yes, that's exactly what I calculated.

Option C: λ_+ = 0.0340, which is rounded. But the exact value is 0.03399, so option I is more precise.

Wait, let me check the other options again.

Option I is λ_+ = 0.03399, λ_- = 0.00721. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer must be option I.

To solve the problem, we start with the given data:

- Equivalent conductance of the electrolytic solution:  
  \[
  \Lambda_m = 0.0412 \, \text{m}^2/(\Omega \cdot \text{mol})
  \]
- Transport number of the positive ion:  
  \[
  t_+ = 0.825
  \]

The total equivalent conductance is the sum of the individual ionic conductances:  
\[
\Lambda_m = \lambda_+ + \lambda_-
\]
The transport number \( t_+ \) is defined as the fraction of the total conductance contributed by the positive ion:  
\[
t_+ = \frac{\lambda_+}{\lambda_+ + \lambda_-}
\]
Substituting \(\lambda_+ + \lambda_- = \Lambda_m\) into the equation for \( t_+ \), we get:  
\[
t_+ = \frac{\lambda_+}{\Lambda_m}
\]
Rearranging for \( \lambda_+ \):  
\[
\lambda_+ = t_+ \cdot \Lambda_m
\]
Substituting the given values:  
\[
\lambda_+ = 0.825 \cdot 0.0412 = 0.03399 \, \text{m}^2/(\Omega \cdot \text{mol})
\]

Next, we calculate \( \lambda_- \) using the total conductance:  
\[
\lambda_- = \Lambda_m - \lambda_+ = 0.0412 - 0.03399 = 0.00721 \, \text{m}^2/(\Omega \cdot \text{mol})
\]

Thus, the individual ionic conductances are:  
\[
\lambda_+ = 0.03399 \, \text{m}^2/(\Omega \cdot \text{mol}), \quad \lambda_- = 0.00721 \, \text{m}^2/(\Omega \cdot \text{mol})
\]

Now, we compare these values with the options provided:

- **Option A:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.00721\), \(\lambda_- = 0.0412\) — Incorrect, as the values are swapped.
- **Option B:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.825\), \(\lambda_- = 0.0412\) — Incorrect, as \(\lambda_+\) exceeds the total conductance.
- **Option C:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.0340\), \(\lambda_- = 0.0072\) — Close, but \(\lambda_+\) is rounded and less precise.
- **Option D:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.0206\), \(\lambda_- = 0.0206\) — Incorrect, as both values are equal and do not match the calculations.
- **Option E:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.0105\), \(\lambda_- = 0.0307\) — Incorrect, as neither value matches the calculations.
- **Option F:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.00825\), \(\lambda_- = 0.03295\) — Incorrect, as neither value matches the calculations.
- **Option G:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.0411\), \(\lambda_- = 0.0001\) — Incorrect, as \(\lambda_+\) exceeds the total conductance.
- **Option H:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.0412\), \(\lambda_- = 0.03399\) — Incorrect, as \(\lambda_+\) equals the total conductance.
- **Option I:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.03399\), \(\lambda_- = 0.00721\) — Correct, as these values exactly match the calculations.
- **Option J:** \(\lambda_+ = 0.0410\), \(\lambda_- = 0.0002\) — Incorrect, as \(\lambda_+\) exceeds the total conductance.

The correct answer is **Option I**, as it provides the exact values for \(\lambda_+\) and \(\lambda_-\) based on the calculations.
