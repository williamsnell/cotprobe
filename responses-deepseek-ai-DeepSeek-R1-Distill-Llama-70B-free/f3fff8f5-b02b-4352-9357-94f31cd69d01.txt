Okay, so I've got this question about the GDP Deflator and whether certain statements about it are true or not. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on economics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question has three statements, I, II, and III. I need to figure out which are correct.

First, let me recall what the GDP Deflator is. I remember that the GDP Deflator is a measure of the price level of all goods and services produced within a country. It's used to convert nominal GDP into real GDP. Oh right, and it's calculated by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. So, the formula is GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100.

Now, the first statement says the GDP Deflator is used to calculate inflation rates. Hmm. I think inflation is the rate of increase in prices. The GDP Deflator does relate to price changes because it measures the overall price level of domestically produced goods and services. So if the GDP Deflator increases over time, that suggests inflation. Therefore, it's used as an indicator of inflation. So statement I should be true.

The second statement says the GDP Deflator is an alternative to the CPI. I know the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is another measure of inflation. The CPI measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households. While both measure inflation, they focus on different things. The GDP Deflator looks at all goods and services produced within the country, including those not just for consumers, whereas the CPI is more consumer-focused. So yes, they are alternatives but measure slightly different aspects. So statement II is true.

The third statement claims the GDP Deflator is more accurate than the CPI. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this one. Accuracy can be subjective depending on what you're measuring. The GDP Deflator uses a broader range of goods and services, including capital goods, exports, and imports, whereas the CPI only includes goods and services bought by consumers. So in terms of measuring the overall price level of the economy, the GDP Deflator might be more comprehensive. But whether it's more accurate... I think this depends. The CPI is considered a good measure for cost of living adjustments because it reflects what consumers actually buy. On the other hand, the GDP Deflator might be better for assessing the overall economic situation. So I'm not sure if one is definitively more accurate than the other. It might depend on the context in which you're using it. So maybe statement III isn't necessarily true.

Wait, but the question is about whether each statement is true. So I need to evaluate each.

So, statement I: Yes, GDP Deflator is used to calculate inflation rates. So true.

Statement II: Yes, it's an alternative to CPI, as both are inflation measures but from different perspectives. So true.

Statement III: Not sure. I think the CPI and GDP Deflator both have their own uses. The question is whether the GDP Deflator is more accurate than the CPI. Some sources say that the GDP Deflator is considered a more comprehensive measure because it includes all goods and services, whereas the CPI only includes a specific basket. But I'm not certain if "more accurate" is the right term here. It might be more accurate for measuring overall economic inflation but not necessarily for consumer inflation. So perhaps the statement is true in the context that it's a broader measure, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the GDP Deflator and CPI are constructed. The GDP Deflator uses the current weights of the GDP components each year, whereas the CPI has a fixed basket based on a survey of consumer purchases. So the GDP Deflator's weights change every year, which might make it more responsive to changes in the economy. In that sense, it could be considered more accurate for measuring general inflation. So statement III might be true.

Alternatively, the CPI is often criticized for potential biases, like substitution bias, because it doesn't account for consumers switching to cheaper alternatives. The GDP Deflator, being based on actual production data, might not have this problem as much. So perhaps the GDP Deflator is more accurate in that sense.

If that's the case, then statement III would be true as well. So all three statements I, II, III would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the CPI is more timely than the GDP Deflator, which is released later because it depends on the full GDP calculations. But timeliness doesn't relate to accuracy.

So, considering all that, the statements:

I. True.

II. True.

III. True.

So all three are correct. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about III. Let me think again. The question is whether the GDP Deflator is more accurate than the CPI. Some might argue that it's not necessarily more accurate, just different. Because the CPI measures consumer inflation, which is what most people experience. The GDP Deflator measures the overall price change of all domestic goods and services, which could include things like business investment, government purchases, etc. So if the question is about general inflation, the GDP Deflator might be more accurate, but for individual consumers, the CPI is better. So the statement III's truth depends on context.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the context. It just says "is more accurate than the CPI". So in general, without context, I think that the GDP Deflator is considered a more comprehensive measure, thus possibly more accurate for overall inflation, but perhaps the CPI is more accurate for consumer prices. So statement III may not be universally true.

Hmm, this is tricky. Because the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to recall what I learned in class. I think the GDP Deflator is considered a broader measure and often used by economists for analyzing the economy's inflation, whereas the CPI is more for policy, like cost-of-living adjustments. So in terms of measuring the general price level, the GDP Deflator is more accurate. So statement III would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me see. In the context of the question, the options are E: I, II, III are true. H: II and III are true. D: Only II and III are true.

Wait, I initially thought all three are correct, which would make E the answer. But I'm a bit unsure about statement III.

Alternatively, maybe statement III is false. Because while the GDP Deflator is broader, the CPI is more accurate for specific purposes. So "more accurate" is subjective.

Wait, another approach: the question is whether the GDP Deflator is more accurate than the CPI. I think that the GDP Deflator doesn't have the same issues as the CPI, like the substitution bias or the fact that CPI doesn't account for new goods. So in that sense, the GDP Deflator could be considered more accurate because it reflects the actual price changes of all goods and services produced, not just a fixed basket.

Alternatively, the CPI is based on a specific basket from a certain year, so it might not capture changes in purchasing patterns over time, whereas the GDP Deflator's basket implicitly changes each year based on production. So in that case, the GDP Deflator could be more accurate as a measure of inflation.

So if statement III is correct, then all three statements would be correct, making E the answer.

Wait, let me think of the options:

E: I, II, and III are true.

H: II and III are true.

Wait, but I thought statement I is true. So if all three are correct, the answer would be E.

But I'm not entirely sure about statement III. Let me recall some sources. For example, the GDP Deflator is often considered a better measure of the overall price level because it includes all goods and services, not just those in the CPI's basket. Therefore, it's more accurate for measuring the overall inflation rate. So statement III would be correct.

So that would mean all three statements are correct, which is option E.

The GDP Deflator is a measure of the overall price level of all goods and services produced within a country, used to convert nominal GDP into real GDP. It is calculated as:

\[
\text{GDP Deflator} = \left(\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\right) \times 100
\]

### Analysis of the Statements:

1. **Statement I: The GDP Deflator is used to calculate inflation rates.**  
   This is true. The GDP Deflator measures changes in the overall price level of domestically produced goods and services, which is a key indicator of inflation.

2. **Statement II: The GDP Deflator is an alternative to the CPI.**  
   This is also true. While the CPI measures inflation based on a fixed basket of consumer goods and services, the GDP Deflator provides a broader measure of inflation by including all goods and services produced within the economy. Thus, they serve as alternative measures of inflation but focus on different aspects.

3. **Statement III: The GDP Deflator is more accurate than the CPI.**  
   This is more nuanced. The GDP Deflator is considered more comprehensive because it includes all goods and services produced in the economy, whereas the CPI focuses only on consumer goods and services. Additionally, the GDP Deflator uses current weights each year, making it more responsive to changes in the economy. However, the CPI is often more relevant for measuring consumer-specific inflation. Despite this, the GDP Deflator is generally regarded as more accurate for assessing overall inflation due to its broader scope and reduced biases like substitution bias. Therefore, this statement can be considered true.

### Conclusion:  
All three statements (I, II, and III) are true. The correct answer is:

**E: I, II, and III are true.**
