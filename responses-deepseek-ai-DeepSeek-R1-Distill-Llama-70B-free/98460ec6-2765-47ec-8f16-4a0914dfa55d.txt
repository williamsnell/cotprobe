Question:

After a wife found out about her husband's infidelity, she decided to have him killed. The defendant approached a hit man to solicit his assistance in carrying out the planned murder. Although the wife believed that he was a hit man, he was, in fact, an undercover agent. The wife told the undercovr agent she would pay him $20,000 if he accepted the job and an additional $20,000 after the killing was completed. Upon hearing the wife's proposal, the undercover agent told the wife he would kill her husband. However, the undercover agent secretly intended not to go through with the plan, and he merely feigned agreement because he wished to trap the wife. The wife told the undercover agent that she would deliver the first payment the next day. However, before making the initial payment, the wife learned that the hit man was really an undercover agent. Fearful that she might be prosecuted for planning her husband's murder, the wife contacted the police and renounced her participation in the criminal endeavor. The defendant will most likely be found

Options:

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding solicitation and conspiracy. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

The scenario is about a wife who wants her husband killed because of infidelity. She approaches someone she thinks is a hitman but is actually an undercover agent. She offers him $20k upfront and another $20k after the job. The agent agrees but only pretends to go along to trap her. The next day, before paying, she finds out he's undercover and then contacts the police, renouncing her involvement.

The question is asking what the defendant (the wife) will most likely be found guilty of. The options are about various combinations of solicitation, conspiracy, attempted murder, etc.

First, I need to recall the legal definitions here. 

Solicitation is when someone asks another to commit a crime, with the intent that the crime be committed. It doesn't matter if the crime actually happens; the act of soliciting is enough. So, if the wife asked the hitman to kill her husband, that's solicitation.

Conspiracy is when two or more people agree to commit a crime, with the intent to do so, and there's an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. But wait, in this case, the person she was talking to was an undercover agent. So, if the agent was just pretending to agree, was there a real agreement? Because for conspiracy, both parties need to have the intent. If the agent never intended to go through with it, can there be a conspiracy?

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, if one person agrees and the other doesn't, there's no conspiracy. So if the wife intended to hire him, but the agent didn't intend to actually commit the crime, then maybe there's no conspiracy. But I'm not sure. Some sources say that if the person being solicited isn't actually agreeing to commit the crime (like an undercover officer), then there's no conspiracy because the officer didn't have the intent.

So, does the wife's action alone count as conspiracy? I don't think so because conspiracy requires at least two people. If the other person didn't have the intent, then there's no conspiracy. So the wife can't conspire alone.

Then, what about solicitation? She did solicit the undercover agent. But does it matter that he's an undercover agent? I think solicitation doesn't require the person to actually be able to commit the crime. For example, if you ask someone to kill your spouse, and they agree but are actually a cop, you're still guilty of solicitation because you took the step to ask.

So, in this case, she solicited the agent, so she's guilty of solicitation. But since the agent didn't intend to go through with it, there's no conspiracy.

Wait, but some might argue that she tried to enter into a conspiracy, but since the other party didn't agree, it's impossible. So, no conspiracy, but she still committed solicitation.

Now, the other part of the question is that she later renounced her participation. She contacted the police before making the payment. Does that affect her liability?

Renunciation in criminal law can sometimes be a defense if it's done before any crime is committed. For conspiracy, effective renunciation before any overt act might negate liability. But for solicitation, since the act is complete once the solicitation is made, renunciation might not undo that.

So, she's guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy.

Looking at the options, option H says not guilty of conspiracy but guilty of solicitation. Option F is guilty only of solicitation. Option H seems to address both.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option F: guilty of solicitation.
Option H: not guilty of conspiracy, but guilty of solicitation.

Wait, the question is about what she will be found. So, she's guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy.

So option H is the correct choice.

But wait, another thought: Does the fact that she contacted the police and renounced after the solicitation affect the solicitation charge? I think solicitation is complete upon the request. So even if she later backs out, the initial act is done. So she can't undo the solicitation by renouncing later.

So, she's guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy.

Looking at the options, H says not guilty of conspiracy but guilty of solicitation. So H is the answer.

The wife in this scenario approached an undercover agent, believing him to be a hitman, and offered him money to kill her husband. This constitutes solicitation, as she intentionally asked someone to commit a crime. However, conspiracy requires an agreement between two parties with the intent to commit the crime. Since the undercover agent did not intend to carry out the crime, there was no valid agreement, and thus no conspiracy.

The wife later renounced her involvement and contacted the police before making any payment. While renunciation can sometimes be a defense in certain circumstances, it does not negate the completed act of solicitation. Therefore, the wife is guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

H: not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but guilty of solicitation.

Answer: H
