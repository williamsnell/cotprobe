Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. The question is about how many centimeters the cervix must dilate before a baby can be born. Hmm, I remember that dilation is a big part of the labor process, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number.

Wait, I think in childbirth, the cervix starts closed and gradually opens, or dilates, as labor progresses. I've heard the term "fully dilated" before. Let me think... I believe it's 10 centimeters. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Because I remember hearing that when the cervix is at 10 cm, it's considered fully dilated and the woman can start pushing the baby out. 

So looking at the options: the choices are A through J. Let me check each one. 

Option A is 8, which is close but not the full dilation. Option B is 35, which seems way too high. The cervix doesn't dilate that much, right? Option C is 25, that's also way beyond what I remember. Option D is 15, maybe that's for something else? Option E is 20, no, that's too high. Option F is 30, definitely not. Option G is 5, which I think is the starting point or early labor. Option H is 10, which matches what I was thinking. Option I is 18, which again is higher than necessary. Option J is 12, which is a bit more than what's needed, but the cervix doesn't usually go beyond 10.

Wait, could there be any exceptions? Like, sometimes maybe it's a little more, but I think 10 is the standard number they teach. So I'm pretty confident the answer is H: 10 centimeters.

The correct answer is H: 10 centimeters. During labor, the cervix must dilate to 10 centimeters before a baby can be born, as this is considered fully dilated and allows the baby to pass through.

Answer: H
