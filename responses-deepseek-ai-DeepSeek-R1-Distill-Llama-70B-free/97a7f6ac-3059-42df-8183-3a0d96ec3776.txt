Question:

A grade 3/6, diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Acute myocardial infarction
B: Congestive heart failure
C: Angina pectoris
D: Aortic dissection

Okay, so I've got this medical question to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what's going on. 

The patient is a 47-year-old man who comes to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has no history of similar symptoms. His medical history includes hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide, and he's a smoker of one pack a day for 30 years. His vital signs are pulse 110/min, respirations 24/min, BP 110/50 mmHg. 

They mention a grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border that radiates to the right. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. 

I need to pick the most likely diagnosis from the options given. Let's break down the key points.

First, the symptoms: sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. These are classic signs of a cardiovascular emergency. The possibilities include myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or something like a hypertensive crisis.

Looking at his risk factors: he's a smoker with a 30-pack-year history, which is significant. Smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, which can lead to aneurysms or dissections. Hypertension is another big risk factor, especially for aortic dissection.

His vital signs: tachycardia (110), tachypnea (24), and BP is 110/50. Wait, that's a diastolic of 50, so the pulse pressure is 60. A wide pulse pressure is often seen in aortic regurgitation, but here it's low diastolic, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, hypotension could indicate shock, but here the systolic is 110, which isn't that low, but maybe he's on the verge.

The physical exam findings are crucial. A grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border that radiates to the right. Diastolic murmurs are associated with conditions like aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis. But wait, a blowing murmur is more typical of aortic regurg. However, in the context of acute presentation, this could be due to a new issue.

Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. That's interesting. Decreased femoral pulses can be a sign of aortic dissection, especially if the dissection is affecting the descending aorta and maybe the iliac arteries, or perhaps it's involving the aortic valve or root causing reduced flow. Another possibility is that it's related to the heart's output, but the murmur points more towards a valvular issue.

The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which is expected in someone with long-standing hypertension. That makes sense.

Putting it together: Sudden chest pain, especially tearing in nature (though not explicitly stated here), hypertension history, diastolic murmur, decreased femoral pulses. 

Wait, the options are given. Let's look at them. The options are A through J, including things like acute MI, heart failure, angina, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, esophageal rupture, hypertensive crisis, thoracic aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, and aortic stenosis.

So, the key here is the diastolic murmur. A diastolic murmur that's blowing suggests aortic regurgitation. So, what would cause acute aortic regurgitation? Aortic dissection is a common cause. In aortic dissection, the aorta can dissect, and if the dissection involves the aortic root, it can cause the aortic valve to become incompetent, leading to acute aortic regurgitation. 

Acute aortic regurgitation presents with symptoms like acute heart failure, chest pain, and the diastolic murmur. The decreased femoral pulses could be due to the dissection obstructing blood flow, perhaps if the dissection is in the descending aorta and the renal arteries or lower extremities are affected. Alternatively, if the aortic root is involved, it might lead to impaired blood flow to the coronary arteries, but that's more concerning for cardiac issues.

Another possibility is that the aortic dissection is causing a pericardial effusion or tamponade, but the question doesn't mention jugular venous distension or muffled heart sounds, so that's less likely.

Looking at the options, option D is aortic dissection. Let's think about other options. Pulmonary embolism could cause acute shortness of breath and chest pain, but it usually doesn't cause a diastolic murmur. The murmur would more likely be a sign of cardiac valvular disease. Also, in PE, you might expect a right ventricular strain pattern on ECG, but the LVH is mentioned here.

Acute MI (option A) can cause chest pain, but the diastolic murmur isn't typical unless there's papillary muscle rupture leading to mitral regurgitation, but that's a systolic murmur, not diastolic. So that doesn't fit.

Congestive heart failure (B) could present with shortness of breath, but again, the diastolic murmur and the acute presentation are more suggestive of aortic dissection.

Hypertensive crisis (G) might be relevant, but again, it's more about very high blood pressure. His BP is 110/50, which isn't that high, so that's probably not it.

Aortic stenosis (J) is a systolic murmur, so that's not matching the diastolic murmur here.

Mitral valve prolapse (E) usually has a click and a late systolic murmur, so that doesn't fit.

Esophageal rupture (F) would probably present with more GI symptoms, like vomiting or severe pain that might be worsened by swallowing, but the murmur and decreased pulses don't align.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm (H) could be a consideration, but a stable aneurysm wouldn't typically cause such acute symptoms unless it's dissecting. So, option D (aortic dissection) seems to cover that scenario.

So, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection, which is causing acute aortic regurgitation (the diastolic murmur), chest pain, and decreased femoral pulses due to impaired blood flow from the dissection.

The patient is a 47-year-old man presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and is a heavy smoker (30-pack-year history). His vital signs include tachycardia (110/min), tachypnea (24/min), and blood pressure of 110/50 mmHg, with a wide pulse pressure. A grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border, radiating to the right, and femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

The key findings point to a cardiovascular emergency. The diastolic blowing murmur suggests aortic regurgitation, which can occur acutely in the setting of aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a likely diagnosis given the patient's history of hypertension and smoking, both of which are significant risk factors. The decreased femoral pulses further support this diagnosis, as a dissection in the descending aorta can impair blood flow to the lower extremities. Other conditions like acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or hypertensive crisis are less consistent with the diastolic murmur and decreased femoral pulses.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection, which explains the acute aortic regurgitation, chest pain, and decreased femoral pulses.
