The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is an experimental control? Why is it important tohave experimentalcontrol?

Options:

A: An experimental control is a way of taking into account the possible effect of an extraneous independent variable that is not considered in the hypothesis being tested.
B: An experimental control is the process of repeating experiments to ensure accuracy
C: An experimental control is an individual or group not exposed to the experimental treatment
D: An experimental control is a sample from a larger population used to make generalizations
E: An experimental control is the variable that the researcher changes to observe its effects
F: An experimental control is a tool for manipulating variables
G: An experimental control is a group or condition that remains constant throughout the experiment
H: An experimental control is a statistical analysis technique
I: An experimental control is a data collection method
J: An experimental control is the application of randomization in assigning participants to different conditions

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about experimental control, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through step by step.

The question is asking what an experimental control is and why it's important. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that in experiments, controlling variables is crucial. The main idea is to make sure that any changes we observe are due to the variable we're testing (the independent variable) and not other factors.

An experimental control, from what I've read before, is usually a group in an experiment that doesn't receive the treatment being tested. So, if we're testing a new drug, the control group might get a placebo. This way, we can compare the two groups to see if the drug actually has an effect.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's an individual or group not exposed to the experimental treatment. That sounds right because the control group isn't getting the variable being tested.

Option A talks about accounting for extraneous variables. I think that's more about controlling variables in general, not specifically the experimental control.

Option B is about repeating experiments for accuracy. That's more about replication, not the control itself.

Option E is the variable changed by the researcher, which is the independent variable, not the control.

Option G says it's a group that remains constant. That might be part of it, but I think the key is that they aren't exposed to the treatment.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be C. The control is the group without the treatment, and it's important because it allows comparison to see the effect of the independent variable.

The experimental control is the group or individual not exposed to the experimental treatment, allowing comparison to assess the effect of the independent variable.

Answer: C
