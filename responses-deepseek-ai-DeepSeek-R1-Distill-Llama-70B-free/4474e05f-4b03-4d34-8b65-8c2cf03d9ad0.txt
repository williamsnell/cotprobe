The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A minor child was eating a fish sandwich in a fast food restaurant when a large metal object, later identified as a fish hook, got caught in her throat. The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?

Options:

A: No, because the restaurant should have provided a warning about potential hazards in their food.
B: Yes, because the child should have been supervised while eating.
C: Yes, because the restaurant cannot control what is in the fish they receive from suppliers.
D: Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.
E: No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.
F: No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.
G: Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.
H: No, because the restaurant should have had a procedure in place to prevent such incidents.
I: Yes, because the restaurant did everything reasonable to ensure the safety of their food.
J: No, because the restaurant should have checked each fish individually for hooks.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a child getting a fish hook in her throat from a fast food sandwich. Hmm, let me break this down.

The child was eating a fish sandwich, and a fish hook got stuck, causing her to cough blood. They took her to the hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant is being sued, but they're defending themselves by saying they did everything reasonable to remove foreign objects and that there was no negligence.

The question is whether the lawsuit will be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant. I need to pick the correct answer from A to J.

First, I should think about the legal concepts involved here. It sounds like a product liability case. There are different theories in product liability: negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty.

In this case, the restaurant is arguing that they weren't negligent because they took all reasonable steps. So if the plaintiff is suing based on negligence, the restaurant's defense would be that they weren't at fault. But if the claim is under strict liability, then the restaurant could be liable even without negligence if the product was defective or unreasonably dangerous.

Wait, but strict liability usually applies to manufacturers, not necessarily to restaurants. Or does it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think sometimes under strict product liability, any seller in the chain can be held liable, but I'm not entirely sure if that applies here.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the restaurant should have warned about potential hazards. But if they did everything reasonable to check, maybe they don't need to warn because they expect the food to be safe.

Option B says the child should have been supervised. But I don't think that's the restaurant's responsibility; it's more on the parents. So maybe B isn't the right reason.

Option C says the restaurant can't control suppliers. That might relate to negligence, but if the restaurant took reasonable steps, maybe that's a defense. But in strict liability, the source might not matter.

Option D says the customer assumes the risk of metal hooks. I don't think customers assume such risks for hidden dangers. They expect the food to be safe, so this might not apply.

Option E says strict liability applies even without negligence. That's possible. If the product is defective, the seller could be strictly liable. But I'm not sure if a fish hook in a sandwich is considered a defect.

Option F is about not posting a warning. Similar to A, but again, if they took reasonable steps, maybe no warning is needed.

Option G says customers expect foreign objects. That doesn't sound right. I don't expect to find metal hooks in my food; that's not a typical risk.

Option H says the restaurant should have had procedures. But the restaurant says they did everything reasonable, so this might not apply.

Option I says the restaurant isn't liable because they did everything reasonable. That would be a negligence defense, but if the case is based on strict liability, this might not matter.

Option J says they should have checked each fish. That's probably not feasible, so maybe this is too strict.

Wait, so the restaurant is defending against negligence by showing they weren't negligent. If the plaintiff is suing under negligence, then yes, the defense would work, and the lawsuit would be dismissed. But if the plaintiff is suing under strict liability, the restaurant's due diligence might not matter.

So looking at the options again, E says no because of strict liability. But does strict liability apply here? I think strict liability applies when the product has a defect that makes it unreasonably dangerous. A fish hook in the sandwich would make it defective. So even if the restaurant wasn't negligent, they could still be liable under strict product liability.

So if that's the case, then the answer would be E, because strict liability applies regardless of negligence.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Some jurisdictions might treat restaurants differently, especially if they're just the sellers and not the manufacturers. But I think under strict liability, any seller can be held liable, not just the manufacturer.

So the correct answer would be E: No, because even without negligence, there's strict liability for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.

The question revolves around a product liability case where a child found a fish hook in her sandwich, causing injury. The restaurant defends itself by stating it took all reasonable steps to ensure safety and was not negligent. The key issue is whether the lawsuit should be dismissed in favor of the restaurant.

Under negligence law, if the restaurant proved it acted reasonably, it could avoid liability. However, strict liability applies to sellers of unreasonably dangerous or defective products, regardless of negligence. A fish hook in a sandwich qualifies as a defect, making the product unreasonably dangerous. Therefore, the restaurant could be held strictly liable even without negligence.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, F, J**: Relate to warnings or inspections, but the restaurant's reasonable efforts likely suffice.
- **B, G**: Incorrectly shift responsibility to the consumer or assume acceptance of such risks.
- **C, H, I**: Focus on negligence, which the restaurant's defense addresses, but strict liability remains.
- **D**: Incorrectly suggests assumption of risk for hidden dangers.
- **E**: Correctly identifies strict liability applies, making the restaurant liable despite lack of negligence.

Thus, the lawsuit would not be dismissed because strict liability applies.
