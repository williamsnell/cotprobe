The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man kidnapped a victim in State A and transported the victim across the state border into State B. These actions violated the kidnapping laws of both states, which are identical. A jury convicted the man in a State A court, but the trial judge gave what prosecutors in State B deemed an unduly lenient sentence. The state prosecutor in State B then commenced a kidnapping case against the man for violating State B's kidnapping statute. The man's lawyer has filed a motion in State B to dismiss the charge based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the man's single act of kidnapping. Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?

Options:

A: No, because the man committed two separate acts of kidnapping, one in each state.
B: Yes, because the man was already tried and convicted for the same crime in State A.
C: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies to both state and federal laws.
D: No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws. right to enforce its laws.
E: No, because the double jeopardy protection only applies to federal law.
F: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies even when laws of different states are identical.
G: No, because the man's sentence in State A was deemed unduly lenient in State B.
H: Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction.
I: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.
J: No, because the double jeopardy protection only prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about double jeopardy, and I'm supposed to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The scenario is that a man kidnaps a victim in State A and then takes them to State B. Both states have identical kidnapping laws. He was tried and convicted in State A, but the sentence was lenient, so State B is now prosecuting him too. His lawyer is arguing double jeopardy, saying he can't be tried twice for the same act.

Hmm, double jeopardy. I remember that the Fifth Amendment protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But wait, that's federal. What about states? Oh right, the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. So each state's separate prosecution could be an issue.

Wait, but I think there's something about dual sovereignty. Oh yes, the dual sovereignty doctrine! It says that separate sovereigns—like two different states—can each prosecute someone for the same conduct without violating double jeopardy. So if State A prosecutes and then State B prosecutes for the same act, it's allowed because each state is a separate sovereign.

So in this case, the man is being prosecuted by two different states. Each has its own laws, even though they're identical. So State B can prosecute him even after State A did because they're different sovereigns. That would mean that the double jeopardy protection doesn't apply across state lines in this scenario.

Looking at the options:

Option D says No because each state has the right to enforce its laws. That sounds like it's invoking dual sovereignty.

Option B says Yes because he was tried in State A. But that's probably wrong because of dual sovereignty.

Option C says Yes because it applies to state and federal, but that's not the issue here because it's two states.

Option D: No, because each state can enforce their laws. So the court shouldn't dismiss. So the motion to dismiss should be denied.

Wait, but the question is whether the court in State B should grant the motion. If the answer is that each state can prosecute, then the court in B would deny the motion, so the correct answer is No, meaning the court doesn't grant the motion. So the answer is D: No, because each state has the right to enforce its laws.

Let me double-check. The dual sovereignty doctrine allows separate prosecutions by different sovereigns. So even though the acts are the same, each state's laws are their own. So yes, State B can prosecute him again. So the answer is D.
</think>

The double jeopardy clause protects against being tried twice for the same offense, but the dual sovereignty doctrine allows separate prosecutions by different sovereigns, such as two states. Here, State A and State B are different sovereigns, each with the right to enforce their own laws. Therefore, State B can prosecute the man despite his conviction in State A.

The correct answer is D.

D
