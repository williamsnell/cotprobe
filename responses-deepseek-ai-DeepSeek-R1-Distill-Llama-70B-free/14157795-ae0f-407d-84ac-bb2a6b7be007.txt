Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group homomorphisms, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements. Statement 2 says there's a homomorphism from some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. The options are combinations of whether each statement is true, false, or not enough information.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I remember some basics. Let me think about each statement separately.

Starting with Statement 1: The image of a group under a homomorphism is the set of all outputs produced by the homomorphism. The image is a subgroup of the codomain group. Wait, but the size here is the question. The original group has 6 elements. The image's size must divide the order of the original group because of Lagrange's theorem, right? So possible sizes could be 1, 2, 3, or 6.

But Statement 1 says the image could have 12 elements. Wait, 12 is larger than 6. But that doesn't make sense because the image is a subset of the codomain, which might be larger, but the image's size is determined by the kernel. The First Isomorphism Theorem says that the image is isomorphic to the quotient group G/ker(phi), where phi is the homomorphism. So the size of the image would be |G| / |ker(phi)|. Since |G|=6, the image's size must divide 6. So possible sizes are 1,2,3,6.

So 12 can't be the size of the image because 6 divided by any subgroup size can't give 12. That's impossible. So Statement 1 must be false.

Now, Statement 2: There exists a homomorphism from some group of 6 elements into a group of 12 elements. Well, a homomorphism can map into a larger group. For example, the trivial homomorphism maps every element of G to the identity in the larger group. Or perhaps a non-trivial one. But does such a homomorphism exist?

Wait, wait. Let's think. A homomorphism from G to H exists if the order of G divides the order of H? No, that's not necessarily true. The order of the image must divide both |G| and |H|. So as long as H has a subgroup whose order divides G's order, which is 6, then yes. 

For example, consider G as the cyclic group of order 6 (like Z6), and H as the cyclic group of order 12 (Z12). Then, can we define a homomorphism from Z6 to Z12? Well, a homomorphism from Z6 to Z12 can be inclusion, like sending each element a in Z6 to 2a in Z12, but wait, that doesn't quite work because the orders wouldn't match. Alternatively, maybe a different mapping. Alternatively, perhaps embedding a smaller group into a larger one isn't straightforward, but the trivial homomorphism always exists where every element maps to the identity. So at least the trivial homomorphism exists, which would satisfy the condition. So Statement 2 is true because such a homomorphism exists. 

Wait, but the question says "some group of 6 elements". So any group of order 6, like symmetric group S3 (which is non-abelian), or cyclic group Z6. So for example, take G as S3 (order 6), and H as A4 (order 12). Does a homomorphism exist from S3 to A4? Hmm, I'm not sure, but the trivial homomorphism exists regardless, so yes, there exists at least the trivial homomorphism. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait another thought. For the homomorphism, the kernel must be a normal subgroup of G. If G is non-abelian, like S3, then kernel must be a normal subgroup. So for example, the trivial homomorphism has kernel equal to G, which is normal. So yes, the trivial homomorphism exists. So Statement 2 is true.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is false because the image can't have more elements than the original group. Statement 2 is true because such a homomorphism exists.

Looking back at the options, the options are about each statement's truth. So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Looking at the options, option J is False, True. Option J is the choice where Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Statement 1's image size can't be 12 because it's larger than 6. So Statement 1 is definitely false. Statement 2 is true because you can have a homomorphism; for example, the trivial one. So the correct option is J.

Statement 1 claims that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements. However, the image of a group under a homomorphism must be a subgroup of the codomain, and its size must divide the order of the original group due to Lagrange's theorem. Since the original group has 6 elements, the possible sizes of the image are limited to the divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, or 6. Therefore, an image size of 12 is impossible, making Statement 1 false.

Statement 2 asserts that there is a homomorphism from some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. A homomorphism can indeed exist, as the trivial homomorphism (which maps every element of the group to the identity element of the codomain) always exists. For example, a group of order 6, such as \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \) or \( S_3 \), can be mapped trivially into a group of order 12, such as \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \) or \( A_4 \). Thus, Statement 2 is true.

Given that Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, the correct option is **J: False, True**.
