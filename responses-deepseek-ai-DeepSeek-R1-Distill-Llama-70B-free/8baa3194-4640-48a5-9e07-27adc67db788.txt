Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 2,816 multiplied by 7. Hmm, I need to find the product. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that multiplying by 7 can be a bit tricky, but breaking it down might help.

First, I'll try to break down 2,816 into smaller parts that are easier to multiply by 7. Let's see, 2,816 can be split into 2,000 + 800 + 16. That way, I can multiply each part separately and then add them up.

Starting with the 2,000 part: 2,000 multiplied by 7. Well, 2 times 7 is 14, and since there are three zeros, that's 14,000. Got that down.

Next, the 800: 800 times 7. 8 times 7 is 56, and adding two zeros gives me 5,600. So far, I have 14,000 + 5,600, which adds up to 19,600. 

Wait, no, hold on. I think I missed the last part. Oh right, the 16. So 16 times 7. Let me calculate that. 16 times 7 is... 112, because 10*7 is 70 and 6*7 is 42, so 70+42 is 112.

Now, adding all the parts together: 14,000 + 5,600 is 19,600, then add 112. So 19,600 + 112 equals 19,712. 

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I could do it the standard way, multiplying each digit and carrying over as needed. Let's try that to confirm.

2,816 multiplied by 7. Starting from the rightmost digit:
6 *7 =42. Write down 2 and carry over 4.
Next digit: 1*7=7, plus the carried 4 is 11. Write 1, carry 1.
Then, 8*7=56, plus the carried 1 is 57. Write 7, carry 5.
Finally, 2*7=14, plus the carried 5 is 19. Write that down.

So putting it all together, the digits are 19,7 (from 57), 1, and 2. Wait, that's 19,712. Yep, same result as before. So the correct answer should be 19,712.

Looking at the options, option F is 19,712. So the answer must be F.

The correct answer is F: 19,712.
