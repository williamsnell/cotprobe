Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Johansen "trace" test and cointegrating vectors. Hmm, I remember that the Johansen test is used in econometrics to determine the presence of cointegration among multiple time series variables. Cointegration implies that a linear combination of these variables is stationary, even if the individual variables are non-stationary.

The question is about a system with 4 variables, and the null hypothesis is that there are 2 cointegrating vectors. I need to figure out which eigenvalues are used in the trace test.

Wait, the Johansen test comes in two forms: the trace test and the maximum eigenvalue test. The trace test evaluates the null hypothesis of having r cointegrating vectors against the alternative of more than r. So, if the null is r=2, the test will check if there are exactly 2 or possibly more.

I think the trace test computes the sum of the eigenvalues beyond the r-th one. Or wait, maybe it's the sum of the smallest ones? Let me think. Oh right, the trace test statistic is calculated as the sum of the (n - r) largest eigenvalues, where n is the number of variables. Wait, no, maybe it's the smallest? No, wait, no. Let me get this straight.

In the Johansen test, the variables are put into a vector autoregressive (VAR) model, and the cointegrating rank is determined by the rank of a certain matrix. The test computes the eigenvalues of that matrix. The trace test uses the sum of the (n - r) smallest eigenvalues. Or wait, maybe it's the largest?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: For the trace test, the test statistic is the sum of the (n - r) smallest squared eigenvalues. Or wait, no, that's not right. No, wait, the test statistic is the sum of the (n - r) largest eigenvalues? Or maybe the sum of the (n - r) smallest?

Alternatively, I remember that the trace test is based on the sum of the squared eigenvalues beyond the r-th one. Maybe that's not exactly right.

Wait, another approach. The number of cointegrating vectors is equal to the number of eigenvalues significantly different from zero. So, in the trace test, if the null hypothesis is r=2, the test checks whether the remaining (n - r) variables are stationary. So, for n=4 variables, if r=2, then n - r = 2. So the test would consider the sum of the next two eigenvalues beyond the first two.

Wait, but eigenvalues are arranged in descending order, right? So the largest eigenvalue is first, then the next, etc. So for the trace test, when testing for r=2, you sum the (n - r) smallest eigenvalues, but wait, no, because the test is about whether the remaining (n - r) are zero.

Wait, no, the test statistic is the sum of the (n - r) largest eigenvalues after the first r. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The Johansen trace test statistic is given by:

- Trace statistic = -T * sum_{i = r+1}^{n} ln(1 - λ_i)

Where λ_i are the eigenvalues arranged in descending order. So for the null hypothesis of r=2, the sum would include the eigenvalues from λ_3 to λ_4 (since there are 4 variables).

Wait, but wait, the number of cointegrating vectors is r. So if the null is r=2, the test is looking to see if there are more than 2. So the test uses the eigenvalues beyond the first two. So λ3 and λ4 in this case.

So the sum is of the (n - r) eigenvalues, starting from the (r+1)th. So for n=4 and r=2, we take λ3 and λ4.

But the question is about which eigenvalues are used in the test. So the trace test uses the sum of the (n - r) largest eigenvalues? Or the sum of the smallest?

Wait, I'm getting confused because λ1 > λ2 > λ3 > λ4. So, the largest eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, etc.

Wait, in the trace test, the test statistic sums the (n - r) smallest eigenvalues? Or the largest beyond r?

Wait, no, because for r=0, the trace test would sum all the eigenvalues. For r=1, sum from λ2 to λ4, etc.

Ah, okay, so when the null hypothesis is r=2, the trace test uses the sum of the eigenvalues from λ3 to λ4. So that's the two smallest eigenvalues.

Wait, no, in the formula, it's the sum of (1 - λ_i), but in terms of which eigenvalues are included. So when r=2, you include λ3 and λ4 because those are the ones beyond r=2.

But the question is, which eigenvalues are used in the test? So for a system of 4 variables and testing for r=2, the test uses λ3 and λ4. So the smallest two eigenvalues.

Looking back at the options, option D says "The smallest 2", which would be λ3 and λ4. Option F says "The third and fourth largest", which would be same as the smallest two because the largest is λ1, second is λ2, third λ3, fourth λ4.

Wait, in terms of size, the third and fourth largest are the same as the two smallest. So for 4 variables, the third largest is λ3, the fourth largest is λ4.

So the trace test would use λ3 and λ4, which are the third and fourth largest eigenvalues.

Looking at the options, option F is "The third and fourth largest", which corresponds to λ3 and λ4. So that's the correct answer.

But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about the sum of the (n - r) eigenvalues beyond r. So in this case, n=4, r=2, so n - r =2. So sum λ3 and λ4.

So the answer would be F: The third and fourth largest.

The Johansen "trace" test is used to determine the number of cointegrating vectors in a system of time series variables. When testing a null hypothesis of \( r = 2 \) cointegrating vectors in a system of 4 variables, the trace test evaluates whether there are exactly 2 cointegrating vectors or more. The test statistic is calculated as:

\[
\text{Trace statistic} = -T \sum_{i = r+1}^{n} \ln(1 - \lambda_i)
\]

where \( \lambda_i \) are the eigenvalues of the relevant matrix, arranged in descending order (\( \lambda_1 > \lambda_2 > \lambda_3 > \lambda_4 \)).

For \( n = 4 \) and \( r = 2 \), the trace test considers the eigenvalues \( \lambda_3 \) and \( \lambda_4 \), which are the third and fourth largest eigenvalues. These correspond to the smallest two eigenvalues in the system. The test uses these eigenvalues to assess whether the remaining variables are stationary, thereby supporting the null hypothesis of 2 cointegrating vectors.

Among the given options, the correct choice is **F: The third and fourth largest**, as these correspond to the eigenvalues used in the trace test for this scenario.

Answer: F
