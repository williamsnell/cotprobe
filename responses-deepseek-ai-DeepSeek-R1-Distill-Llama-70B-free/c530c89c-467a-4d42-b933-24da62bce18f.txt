Okay, so I have this question about social security and the age when you can receive full benefits. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that social security has something to do with retirement age. I think the age used to be 65, but I've heard that it's changed over time. Maybe it's higher now? I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, I think there's a concept called "full retirement age," which isn't the same as when you can start receiving benefits. So, you can start getting some benefits earlier, but to get the full amount, you have to wait until a certain age.

I think the full retirement age has been increasing. I remember something about it being tied to the year you were born. Like, for people born in certain years, the age is higher. For example, I think for people born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67. But I also recall that it's gradually increasing, so maybe it's going up even more in the future? Or maybe not. I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Has been decreasing. That doesn't sound right. I think the age has gone up, not down.

Option B: Is 70. I don't think that's the full retirement age. I believe 70 is the age where you stop getting delayed retirement credits, meaning your benefits don't increase beyond that.

Option C: Is 65. That's the traditional retirement age, but I think full benefits are higher now. Plus, 65 is when Medicare starts, but not full social security.

Option D: Has been increasing. This makes sense because I remember hearing that the retirement age is going up as people live longer.

Option E: Will never change. I don't think so; policies often adjust over time.

Option F: Is 62. That's when you can start receiving reduced benefits, not full.

Option G: Is decided by the individual. No, it's set by law, not by each person.

Option H: Is the same as retirement age. Wait, I thought retirement age is when you can retire, but full benefits might be different. Or maybe in this context, they're the same. I'm not sure.

Option I: Is 67. That rings a bell. I think for some birth years, it's 67, and that's the current maximum.

Option J: Is 72. I don't think so. That seems too high.

So putting it together, the full retirement age used to be 65, but it's been increasing. For those born after 1959, I think it's 67. So the correct answer would be that the age has been increasing, which is option D. Alternatively, if the question is about the current age, it might be 67, which is option I.

Wait, the question is about the age at which one can receive full benefits. So depending on when someone was born, the age varies. But the trend is that it's been increasing. So the answer about whether it's been increasing is D, or the current age is I.

Looking back at the options, the question is phrased as "the age at which one can receive full benefits." So if someone is asking now, the age could be up to 67. But the fact that the age has been increasing is a trend, so D is about the trend. Wait, the options are about the answer to the question, which is a fact. So perhaps the correct answer is I (67) because for many people now, that's the full retirement age. But the question is asking about the age itself, not the trend. Alternatively, if it's about whether the age has been increasing, then D is correct.

Wait, the question is: "The age at which one can receive full benefits from social security." The options include D: Has been increasing. So the statement is about the ageâ€”whether it's increasing.

So the correct answer is D: Has been increasing. Because the full retirement age has been going up over time. For example, it was 65, then 66, now 67 for people born in 1960 or later. So the age has been increasing.

The age at which one can receive full benefits from Social Security has been increasing over time. Historically, the full retirement age was 65, but it has gradually risen to accommodate longer life expectancies. Currently, for individuals born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67. This trend reflects adjustments to ensure the sustainability of the Social Security system. 

Answer: D
