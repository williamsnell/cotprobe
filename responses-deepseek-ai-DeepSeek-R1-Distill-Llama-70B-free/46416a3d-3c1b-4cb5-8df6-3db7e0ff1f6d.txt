Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, during a storm, a crate of crepe is sliding across a slick, oily parking lot. It's moving through a displacement d, which is -3.0 meters in the i direction. There's a steady wind pushing against the crate with a force F. The force is given as (2.0 N)i + (-6.0 N)j. The question is about finding the kinetic energy at the end of this displacement. The crate starts with 10 J of kinetic energy.

Hmm, I remember that kinetic energy is related to the work done on an object. Oh right! The work done by the forces acting on the object changes its kinetic energy. So the change in kinetic energy (ΔKE) is equal to the work done (W) by the net force, but wait, no, wait—work done by all forces, or just the net? Wait, the work-energy theorem states that the work done by the net force is equal to the change in kinetic energy. Or wait, no, the work done by all forces (like the net) equals the change in KE. So maybe I should compute the work done by the wind force here, because that's the only force mentioned. Wait, but the crate is moving on a slick, oily lot. That probably means friction is negligible. So maybe the only force doing work is the wind's force.

Wait, but wait, the displacement is given as d. So the work done by the wind is F · d, where F is the wind's force. So I need to calculate the dot product of F and d.

Let me write down the vectors:

F = (2.0 N)i + (-6.0 N)j
d = (-3.0 m)i + 0 m j (since displacement is only in i direction)

So the dot product F · d is (2.0)(-3.0) + (-6.0)(0) = -6 + 0 = -6 J.

Wait, but the work done by the wind is -6 J. Since the work done is the change in kinetic energy, then the change in KE is -6 J.

Wait, but wait. The initial kinetic energy is 10 J. So the final KE would be initial plus the work done. So 10 J + (-6 J) = 4 J. So the answer would be 4 J, which is option J.

But wait, let me think again. The force from the wind is opposing the motion, right? Because the displacement is in the negative i direction, so if the force is in the positive i, that's opposite. Wait, no. Wait, the displacement is d = -3i m. So the displacement is in the negative i direction. The force F has a component in the positive i direction (2 N) and negative j (but j is perpendicular, so no work in the j direction).

So the work done by the wind is F · d = (2)(-3) + (-6)(0) = -6 J. So work done is negative, which means energy is taken out of the crate. So initial KE is 10 J. Then, the work done is -6 J, so the KE at the end is 10 -6 =4 J. So the answer should be J:4.0 J.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not making any miscalculations. Let me double-check the dot product. F is (2, -6), d is (-3, 0). So 2*(-3) = -6, and (-6)*0=0. So sum is -6. Correct.

So the work done by the wind is -6 J. Then, ΔKE = W = -6 J. So final KE is 10 -6=4 J. So the correct answer is J.

To determine the crate's kinetic energy at the end of the displacement, we use the work-energy theorem, which states that the work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy:

\[
\Delta KE = W
\]

Here, the work \( W \) is calculated as the dot product of the force \(\vec{F}\) and the displacement \(\vec{d}\):

\[
W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d}
\]

The force \(\vec{F}\) is given as \((2.0 \, \mathrm{N}) \hat{i} + (-6.0 \, \mathrm{N}) \hat{j}\), and the displacement \(\vec{d}\) is \((-3.0 \, \mathrm{m}) \hat{i}\). Since the displacement has no \(j\)-component, the \(j\)-component of the force does no work. The dot product is:

\[
W = (2.0)(-3.0) + (-6.0)(0) = -6.0 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

The work done by the wind is \(-6.0 \, \mathrm{J}\), which means the crate's kinetic energy decreases by \(6.0 \, \mathrm{J}\). The initial kinetic energy is \(10.0 \, \mathrm{J}\), so the final kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\text{final}} = KE_{\text{initial}} + \Delta KE = 10.0 \, \mathrm{J} + (-6.0 \, \mathrm{J}) = 4.0 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Thus, the crate's kinetic energy at the end of the displacement is \(4.0 \, \mathrm{J}\).
