Okay, so I'm trying to solve this VanderWaals equation problem. Let me see what I remember. The question is about calculating the VanderWaals constant b for a gas given its critical pressure (Pc) and critical temperature (Tc). Also, there's a part about the compressibility factor being more than one at certain conditions, but I think the main focus here is finding the value of b.

I remember that the VanderWaals equation relates pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T) for real gases. The equation is [P + a(n/V)^2](V/n - b) = RT, where a and b are constants specific to each gas.

The critical constants, Pc and Tc, are related to a and b. I think the formulas are something like a = 3Pc b² and b = RTc/(8Pc). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. Oh right, from the critical point, when the first and second derivatives of P with respect to V are zero, we can derive expressions for a and b in terms of Pc and Tc.

So, the formula for b should be RTc/(8Pc). But wait, what are the units here? Since R is in L·atm/(mol·K), and the given Pc is in atm and Tc in Celsius, I need to convert Tc to Kelvin. 

The given Tc is 200°C, so adding 273.15 gives 473.15 K. Okay, so Tc is 473.15 K. Pc is 30 atm.

Let me plug in the numbers. R is the gas constant, which is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So b = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (473.15 K) / (8 * 30 atm).

Calculating the numerator: 0.0821 * 473.15 ≈ let's see, 0.08 * 473 is about 37.84, and 0.0021*473 is about 1, so total around 38.84.

Denominator: 8 * 30 = 240. So 38.84 / 240 ≈ 0.1618 L/mol. Hmm, looking at the options, option J is 0.162 liter/mol. That's really close. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. VanderWaals constants: I know that for the critical point, the formulas are a = 3Pc (b)^2 and b = (RTc)/(8Pc). Yes, that's correct. So the calculation should be right.

Wait, another thing: the question also mentions the compressibility factor PV/RT being more than one under certain conditions. I'm not sure how that ties into finding b. Maybe it's a distractor. Because the question is only asking for the value of b, based on Pc and Tc. So I think I can ignore that part for the calculation.

So the steps are: convert Tc to Kelvin, apply the formula b = RTc/(8Pc), compute, and choose the closest option.

To calculate the VanderWaals constant \( b \) for the gas, we use the relationship between the critical constants \( P_c \) and \( T_c \). The formula for \( b \) is:

\[
b = \frac{RT_c}{8P_c}
\]

### Step 1: Convert \( T_c \) to Kelvin
The critical temperature is given as \( T_c = 200^\circ \text{C} \). Converting to Kelvin:

\[
T_c = 200 + 273.15 = 473.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Plug values into the formula
The gas constant \( R \) is \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), \( T_c = 473.15 \, \text{K} \), and \( P_c = 30 \, \text{atm} \). Substituting these values:

\[
b = \frac{(0.0821)(473.15)}{8(30)}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.0821 \times 473.15 \approx 38.84
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
8 \times 30 = 240
\]

Now, divide:

\[
b = \frac{38.84}{240} \approx 0.1618 \, \text{L/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \( b \) is approximately \( 0.162 \, \text{L/mol} \), which corresponds to **option J**.

### Final Answer:
J
