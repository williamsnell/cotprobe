Okay, so I've got this problem here that I need to solve: changing 34 L 18 cL to liters. Hmm, wait, let me think about what each part means. 

Alright, I remember that 'L' stands for liters, and 'cL' is centiliters. Oh right, centiliters are a smaller unit. So I need to convert the centiliters to liters and then add them to the liters part.

Wait, how much is a centiliter in liters? I think 1 liter is 100 centiliters. So 1 cL is 0.01 liters. Oh wait no, wait. Let me make sure. Because 1 liter is 10 deciliters, and 1 deciliter is 10 centiliters. So 1 liter is 100 centiliters. Right, so 1 cL = 0.01 L.

So the problem is 34 L plus 18 cL. To add them together, I need to convert 18 cL to liters. So 18 times 0.01. Let's calculate that: 18 * 0.01 is 0.18 liters.

Now add that to the 34 liters. 34 + 0.18 is 34.18 liters.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 34.18 L. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes I get mixed up with decimal places. 18 cL is 0.18 L, yes. So adding that to 34 gives 34.18. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer is I.

The problem requires converting 34 liters and 18 centiliters to liters. Since 1 centiliter equals 0.01 liters, 18 cL is 0.18 liters. Adding this to 34 liters gives 34.18 liters. The correct answer is:

I: 34.18 L

Answer: I
