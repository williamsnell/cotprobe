Okay, so I have this economics question here about fiscal policy and its effects on real GDP and unemployment during a recessionary gap. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a recessionary gap occurs when the overall level of economic activity is below the full employment level. So, the economy isn't producing as much as it could, and unemployment is probably higher than usual. The goal of fiscal policy in this situation would be to stimulate the economy, right?

Fiscal policy involves the government using its spending and taxation to influence the economy. There are two main tools: government spending and taxes. When the economy is in a recession, the government can increase spending or cut taxes to boost aggregate demand.

Wait, how does that work again? If the government increases its own spending, that directly adds to aggregate demand. More spending means more jobs in the sectors where the government is investing, which then creates a multiplier effect—those workers have more income to spend elsewhere, further stimulating the economy. So, increasing government spending should lead to an increase in real GDP and a decrease in unemployment because more people are employed.

Alternatively, cutting taxes also boosts aggregate demand. If people have lower taxes, they have more disposable income. They can spend more on goods and services, which increases business sales, leading to more production and hiring. So, lower taxes would also increase real GDP and decrease unemployment.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: Increase spending. So real GDP increases, right? And unemployment would decrease because more jobs are created. But the option says unemployment increases. That doesn't make sense. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Increase taxes. That would reduce disposable income. People spend less, so aggregate demand decreases. That's not good in a recession. GDP would go down, and unemployment would rise. So B is the opposite of what we need.

Option C: No change. That won't help the recessionary gap. So we can ignore C.

Option D: Decrease taxes. This should increase GDP and decrease unemployment. So looking at the table, D says real GDP increases and unemployment decreases. That fits with what I was thinking earlier.

Option E: Decrease taxes, but says unemployment increases. No, that's incorrect. Cutting taxes should reduce unemployment.

Option F: Decrease spending. That would lower aggregate demand, making the recession worse. So GDP decreases and unemployment increases, which is bad.

Option G: Increase taxes. That's bad as discussed earlier, leading to lower GDP and higher unemployment. So G isn't correct.

Option H: Increase taxes. They say GDP increases and unemployment decreases. That's impossible. Higher taxes would do the opposite.

Option I: Decrease spending. That would lower GDP and lower unemployment? No, decreasing spending would lower GDP (bad) and probably increase unemployment, so I is wrong.

Wait, so the correct fiscal policies are either increasing government spending or decreasing taxes. Both should increase GDP and decrease unemployment.

Looking back at the options, I need to see which options match that.

Option D is decrease taxes, which increases GDP and decreases unemployment. That's correct.

Option A is increase spending, but the option says unemployment increases, which is wrong. So D is the correct answer.

Alternatively, is there an option where spending increases and correctly affects unemployment? Let me check.

Option A: Increase spending leads to GDP increase and unemployment increase? No, that's not right. So the only correct option is D.

To address a recessionary gap, fiscal policy should aim to stimulate aggregate demand. This can be achieved through either increasing government spending or decreasing taxes. Both actions lead to higher real GDP and lower unemployment.

- **Option A**: Increasing spending would raise real GDP, but the option incorrectly states that unemployment increases. This makes A incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Increasing taxes reduces disposable income and aggregate demand, worsening the recession. This is not appropriate.  
- **Option C**: No change in taxes does nothing to address the recessionary gap.  
- **Option D**: Decreasing taxes increases disposable income, boosting consumer spending and aggregate demand. This correctly leads to higher real GDP and lower unemployment.  
- **Option E**: Decreasing taxes is correct, but the option incorrectly states that unemployment increases.  
- **Option F**: Decreasing spending reduces aggregate demand, worsening the recession.  
- **Option G**: Increasing taxes is harmful during a recession, as it reduces aggregate demand.  
- **Option H**: Increasing taxes cannot lead to higher GDP and lower unemployment.  
- **Option I**: Decreasing spending reduces GDP and likely increases unemployment, making it incorrect.  

The correct choice is **Option D**, as decreasing taxes appropriately stimulates the economy, increasing real GDP and decreasing unemployment.

Answer: D
