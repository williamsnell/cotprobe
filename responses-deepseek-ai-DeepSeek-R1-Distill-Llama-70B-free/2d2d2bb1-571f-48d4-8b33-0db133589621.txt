Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about iron(III) oxide reacting with carbon monoxide in a blast furnace. I'm a bit rusty on stoichiometry, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me the reaction: Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. Wait, but I think it's supposed to be a balanced equation. Let me check the coefficients. Fe₂O₃ on the left has 2 Fe and 3 O. On the right, 2 Fe, so that's balanced for Fe. For O, Fe₂O₃ has 3 O, and each CO has one O, so 3 CO gives 3 O, and 3 CO₂ gives 6 O. Wait, that doesn't add up. Oh wait, maybe I should recount. Let me write the equation properly.

The balanced reaction is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. So Fe₂O₃ has 2 Fe and 3 O. On the product side, 2 Fe atoms, and 3 CO₂ has 3×2=6 O. Wait, that's 6 O on the right. On the left, Fe₂O₃ has 3 O, and 3 CO has 3 O, so total 6 O. Oh, right, so the O is balanced. So that part makes sense.

The problem is asking about the volume of CO at STP needed to completely react with 31.94 kg of Fe₂O₃. Hmm. I remember that at STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So I'll need to find out how many moles of CO are needed per mole of Fe₂O₃, then multiply by 22.4 to get the volume.

First, find the molar mass (MW) of Fe₂O₃. The problem gives it as 159.7 g/mol. So the mass given is 31.94 kg. Wait, that's in kg, so I need to convert that to grams. 31.94 kg is 31.94 × 1000 = 31940 grams.

Next, I'll find the number of moles of Fe₂O₃. Moles = mass / molar mass. So that's 31940 g / 159.7 g/mol. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 159.7 times 200 is 31,940. Oh wait, 159.7 × 200 is 31,940. So 31940 / 159.7 is 200 moles. Oh wait, that's a big number. So 200 moles of Fe₂O₃.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, the mole ratio of Fe₂O₃ to CO is 1:3. So for each mole of Fe₂O₃, 3 moles of CO are needed. So 200 moles Fe₂O₃ × 3 moles CO per mole Fe₂O₃ = 600 moles CO.

Now, each mole of CO at STP is 22.4 liters. So 600 moles × 22.4 L/mol = 13,440 liters. Wait, that seems really large. Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, 31.94 kg is 31,940 grams. Divided by 159.7 g/mol is indeed 200 moles. Then 3 times that is 600 moles CO. Multiply by 22.4 gives 600 × 22.4 = 13,440 L. But looking at the options, the highest I see is J:22,400 L. Hmm, but 13,440 isn't among the options. Let me check if I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait the options are A to J as given. Let me look again. The options are:

A: 20.000 l

B: 17.600 l

C: 11.200 l

D: 13.440 l

E: 10.000 l

F: 25.200 l

G: 8.960 l

H: 15.000 l

I: 18.720 l

J:22.400 l

Ah, option D is 13.440 L. So that's the number I got. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recheck.

Fe₂O₃ molar mass is 159.7 g/mol.

31.94 kg = 31940 g.

31940 / 159.7 = 200 moles.

Each mole of Fe₂O₃ needs 3 moles CO, so 600 moles CO.

600 × 22.4 L/mol = 13,440 L. So D is 13.440 L. Yes, that's correct.

To determine the volume of CO at STP required to completely react with 31.94 kg of Fe₂O₃, we start with the balanced reaction:

\[
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2
\]

### Step 1: Convert the mass of Fe₂O₃ to moles
The molar mass (MW) of Fe₂O₃ is given as 159.7 g/mol. The mass of Fe₂O₃ is 31.94 kg, which is converted to grams:

\[
31.94 \, \text{kg} = 31.94 \times 1000 = 31940 \, \text{g}
\]

The number of moles of Fe₂O₃ is:

\[
\text{Moles of Fe}_2\text{O}_3 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{31940 \, \text{g}}{159.7 \, \text{g/mol}} = 200 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Use the mole ratio to find moles of CO
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe₂O₃ reacts with 3 moles of CO. Therefore, the moles of CO required are:

\[
\text{Moles of CO} = 200 \, \text{mol Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \times 3 \, \text{mol CO per mol Fe}_2\text{O}_3 = 600 \, \text{mol CO}
\]

### Step 3: Convert moles of CO to volume at STP
At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. Thus, the volume of CO required is:

\[
\text{Volume of CO} = 600 \, \text{mol CO} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 13440 \, \text{L}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated volume of CO is 13,440 L, which corresponds to option **D: 13.440 L**.
