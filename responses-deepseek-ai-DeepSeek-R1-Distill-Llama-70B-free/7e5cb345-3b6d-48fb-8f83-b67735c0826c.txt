Okay, so I've got this tax question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. Smith has an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $120,000, but that's without considering $40,000 of losses from rental real estate activities. Smith actively participates in these activities. The question is asking how much of those rental losses can Smith deduct when determining taxable income. The options are from A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that there are rules about rental real estate losses and whether they can be deducted against other income. Let me think. So, rental activities are generally considered passive activities, right? But wait, if someone actively participates, maybe the rules are a bit different. 

I think there's something called the passive activity loss rules. Normally, passive losses can only be deducted against passive income. But if you actively participate, there's a special allowance. Oh right! For real estate, if you actively participate, you might be able to deduct up to $25,000 of losses against non-passive income, like your AGI.

Wait, but what's the limit on that $25,000 deduction? I remember it's subject to a phase-out based on income. The phase-out starts when your AGI exceeds a certain threshold. I think the threshold is $100,000. For every dollar above $100,000, you lose 50 cents of the $25,000 allowance. So, the formula would be $25,000 minus (AGI - $100,000) times 0.5.

Smith's AGI here is $120,000. So let's calculate that. AGI minus 100,000 is 20,000. Multiply that by 0.5, which is 10,000. So $25,000 minus $10,000 equals $15,000. So the maximum Smith can deduct is $15,000.

But wait, is there any exception here? Because Smith is actively participating, but the $40,000 loss is more than the $15,000 allowed, so the excess would be carried forward to future years, right? So the deduction for this year would be $15,000.

Looking at the options, option A is $15,000. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but another thought: does active participation affect the treatment differently? Oh, right, active participation allows for that $25,000 allowance, but without it, the loss would be entirely passive and not deductible. Since Smith qualifies, the $15k deduction applies.

So yes, the answer is A.

The question involves determining how much of a $40,000 rental real estate loss Smith can deduct, given an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $120,000 and active participation in the rental activities. Under the passive activity loss rules, individuals who actively participate in rental real estate activities may deduct up to $25,000 of losses against non-passive income. However, this $25,000 allowance is subject to a phase-out when AGI exceeds $100,000. The phase-out reduces the allowance by $0.50 for every dollar of AGI above $100,000.

For Smith, the AGI is $120,000, which exceeds the $100,000 threshold by $20,000. Applying the phase-out, the reduction is $20,000 Ã— 0.50 = $10,000. Thus, the allowable deduction is $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000. The remaining $25,000 of the loss ($40,000 total loss - $15,000 deductible loss) would be carried forward to future tax years.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is **A: $15,000**.

Answer: A
