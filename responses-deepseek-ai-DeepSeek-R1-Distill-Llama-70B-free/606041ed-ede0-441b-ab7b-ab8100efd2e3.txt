Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the atomic weight of natural boron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says that natural boron is made up of 20% ^10B and 80% ^11B. Oh right, I remember that the atomic weight on the chemical scale is calculated by the weighted average of the isotopes based on their abundance.

Wait, the chemical scale uses carbon-12 as the standard, right? So each carbon-12 atom is exactly 12 on that scale. But for boron, the isotopes are ^10B and ^11B. Oh wait, no, the actual masses of the isotopes are important here. I think each isotope's mass is close to its mass number, but maybe I don't need to worry about that for this calculation.

So the formula is (percentage of isotope 1 × mass of isotope 1) + (percentage of isotope 2 × mass of isotope 2), all divided by 100 to get the average.

Wait, but on the chemical scale, the atomic weight would be based on the exact masses. Let me think. Let's see, the atomic masses of the isotopes are about 10.013 and 11.009, approximately. But wait, wait. If we're using the scale where ^12C is 12, then the masses of the boron isotopes would be slightly different. Oh no, maybe that's complicating things. Maybe I should just use their mass numbers as their masses since the question says it's approximate.

Wait, the question says "on the scale of 16 units for ^16O". Oh wait, no, the standard chemical scale is carbon-12. Maybe that's a red herring. Oh no, wait, the initial part says "on the scale of 16 units for ^16O". That's the physical scale, right? So I think that's different from the chemical atomic weight scale.

Wait, no, in the chemical scale, the reference is ^12C = 12. But the physical scale, like the one where ^16O is 16, is a different scale. So does that affect the way we calculate the atomic weight here?

Wait, but wait, the question is about the atomic weight on the chemical scale. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, the question says "on the scale of 16 units for ^16O (chemical scale)". Hmm, that's confusing. Let me think: the chemical scale is the one where the atomic weight is based on ^12C = 12. The physical scale uses ^16O = 16. Oh, but wait, wait. Wait, no, the chemical scale is actually where the reference is ^12C as 12, and the physical scale (like the older one) used ^16O as 16, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the user's question says "on the scale of 16 units for ^16O (chemical scale)", which seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps they meant that the scale is based on ^16O being 16. But that's confusing because the standard chemical scale uses ^12C as 12. Alternatively, maybe the question just wants the calculation done using the physical scale, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the question again. It says, "What is the approximate atomic weight of natural boron on the scale of 16 units for ^16O (chemical scale)?" Hmm. Oh, perhaps they're saying that in this context, the scale is set such that ^16O is 16 (like the physical scale), but they're referring to it as the chemical scale, which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the term is being used differently here.

Wait, perhaps the term "chemical scale" here refers to the standard atomic weight based on naturally occurring isotopes, calculated using their relative abundances and exact masses. So perhaps the calculation is the same regardless of the scale because we're using the actual masses of the isotopes.

Wait, but the initial part about the scale might not matter because the calculation is just about weighted averages. Let me proceed with that approach.

So the two isotopes are ^10B and ^11B. Their approximate atomic masses (on the ^12C scale) are about 10.013 and 11.009, respectively. But wait, maybe for an approximate calculation, we can just use their mass numbers, 10 and 11.

So 20% of 10 plus 80% of 11. Let me compute that.

20% is 0.2, and 80% is 0.8. So 0.2 *10 = 2, and 0.8 *11 = 8.8. Adding them together, 2 + 8.8 = 10.8. So the weighted average would be 10.8.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 10.8. So is that the answer? But wait, the options also include 10.5, 10.2, etc. Maybe I'm oversimplifying by using the mass numbers instead of the actual masses.

Wait, let's get more precise. The exact atomic masses (on the ^12C scale) are approximately:

- ^10B: 10.013 u
- ^11B: 11.009 u

So using these exact masses:

(0.20 * 10.013) + (0.80 * 11.009) 

Calculating each part:

0.20 * 10.013 = 2.0026

0.80 * 11.009 = 8.8072

Adding them: 2.0026 + 8.8072 = 10.8098, which is approximately 10.81.

Looking back at the options, J is 10.8. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, the question mentions the scale of 16 units for ^16O. How does that affect the calculation? Because if the scale is set such that ^16O is 16, that's different from the standard chemical scale where ^12C is 12. So perhaps the masses would be scaled accordingly.

Hmm, maybe I should think about that. So in the ^16O scale, the atomic mass unit is defined such that ^16O is exactly 16.00. In the standard chemical scale (^12C = 12), ^16O has an atomic mass of about 16.00 as well, but how does that affect the individual isotopes?

Wait, actually, the atomic mass unit (amu) is defined relative to ^12C, so in that scale, 1 amu is 1/12 the mass of a ^12C atom. On the ^16O scale, 1 amu would be 1/16 the mass of ^16O. So the conversion between the two scales would involve scaling factors.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe the question is just trying to say that the scale is such that ^16O is 16, but in that case, the masses of boron isotopes would be scaled accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just a matter of calculating the weighted average, and the scale part is a red herring. Because the calculation would be the same regardless of the scale, as the relative masses would scale proportionally.

Wait, but if the scale is based on ^16O being 16, then each atomic mass unit is smaller. Because, normally, ^12C is 12 amu, so each amu is 12/12 = 1. But if ^16O is 16, then each amu is 16/16 = 1, same as before. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the scales. Let me think again.

Wait, in the chemical atomic mass scale, ^12C is set to 12.000. So the mass of ^12C is exactly 12.000 amu, and other atoms' masses are relative to that. On the physical scale, ^16O is set to 16.000, so other atoms' masses are relative to that.

So, for example, in the chemical scale, ^16O has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00 (since it's mostly ^16O, but let's say exactly 16 for simplicity). So the amu in the chemical scale is the same as the physical scale because both set their respective standard isotopes to their mass number.

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think: The physical scale (based on ^16O) and the chemical scale (based on ^12C) are different because their reference points are different. So the amu in each scale is different. But wait, in reality, the modern atomic mass unit is defined based on ^12C (1 amu = 1/12 the mass of ^12C), so that's the standard.

But perhaps the question is referring to the relative atomic mass on the ^16O scale. So perhaps the calculation needs to adjust for that.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let's try to approach it step by step.

First, calculate the weighted average on the standard chemical scale (i.e., based on ^12C). As I did before, using the exact masses:

(0.2 *10.013) + (0.8 *11.009) = 10.8098, approximately 10.81.

Now, if we were to convert this to the scale where ^16O is 16, what would happen?

Wait, perhaps the atomic masses on the ^16O scale are calculated by multiplying by a factor. Because, on the ^12C scale, ^16O is 16.00, so on the ^16O scale, ^16O would be exactly 16. So the scaling factor is 16.00 (on ^12C) to 16.00 (on ^16O). So the scaling factor is 1. So perhaps the atomic masses don't change? That can't be right.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The atomic mass unit on the ^12C scale is 1/12 the mass of ^12C. On the ^16O scale, the amu is 1/16 the mass of ^16O. So the ratio between the two amu's is (1/12)/(1/16) = 16/12 = 4/3.

So, to convert from the ^12C scale to the ^16O scale, you would multiply by 4/3? Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, no, the amu in the ^12C scale is smaller than the amu in the ^16O scale because ^12C is lighter than ^16O.

Wait, I'm getting myself tied in knots here. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have an atom with a mass of 12 amu on the ^12C scale. On the ^16O scale, that same atom would have a mass of 12 * (16/12) = 16 amu? No, that doesn't make sense because that would imply that ^12C would have a mass of 16 on the O scale, but ^16O would be 16 on both scales. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the scaling factor is such that 1 amu on the ^12C scale equals (1/12) the mass of ^12C. On the ^16O scale, 1 amu equals (1/16) the mass of ^16O. So, the mass of ^12C on the ^16O scale would be 12 * (1/12)/(1/16) )? Wait, that's getting too confusing. Maybe I should look up the scaling factors, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed with just the standard calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply a matter of computing the weighted average without worrying about the scale, as the scale is just a way to define the unit, and the relative weights would adjust accordingly. So the calculation would be the same, giving approximately 10.8, which is option J.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the atomic weight on the chemical scale which is based on ^12C, so the calculation I did earlier applies, and the scale part is just extra information. So the answer would be around 10.8, which is option J.

But let me double-check the options again. J is 10.8. That's what I got when using the exact masses. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the approximate atomic weight of natural boron on the chemical scale, we calculate the weighted average of its isotopes based on their natural abundances. Natural boron consists of 20% ^10B and 80% ^11B. The atomic masses of these isotopes are approximately 10.013 u and 11.009 u, respectively.

The formula for the weighted average is:

\[
\text{Atomic Weight} = (0.20 \times 10.013) + (0.80 \times 11.009)
\]

Breaking this down:

1. \( 0.20 \times 10.013 = 2.0026 \)
2. \( 0.80 \times 11.009 = 8.8072 \)

Adding these together:

\[
2.0026 + 8.8072 = 10.8098 \approx 10.81
\]

This value rounds to 10.8. Among the given options, the closest match is **J: 10.8**.

The mention of the "scale of 16 units for ^16O" in the question does not affect the calculation, as the chemical scale is based on ^12C, and the relative isotopic masses remain consistent regardless of the reference point. Thus, the weighted average calculation remains valid.

**Answer: J**
