Okay, so I have this question about Dash Co.'s utility bills and I need to figure out what liability they should report on their June 30 balance sheet. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the information given. There are three periods and their corresponding payments:

1. April 16 – May 15: $5,000, paid on June 1.
2. May 16 – June 15: $6,000, paid on July 1.
3. June 16 – July 15: $8,000, paid on August 1.

Wait, but the question is about the balance sheet date of June 30. So I need to determine which of these amounts are liabilities as of that date. Liabilities are amounts that the company owes but hasn't paid yet.

Let me think about each period:

- The first bill covers April 16 to May 15, and it's paid on June 1. Since June 1 is after the balance sheet date of June 30? Wait no, June 1 is before June 30. So this bill was paid in June, before the balance sheet date. That means as of June 30, this $5,000 has already been paid, so it's not a liability anymore.

- The second bill is for May 16 to June 15, paid on July 1. Oh, so this payment is made after June 30. That means on June 30, Dash still owes this $6,000. So this should be included as a liability.

- The third bill is from June 16 to July 15, paid on August 1. So this period starts on June 16 and ends July 15. As of June 30, the period up to June 30 would be part of this billing cycle. But wait, does the billing start on June 16? So from June 16 to June 30 is half a month (assuming 30 days in June, but June has 30 days anyway). So does Dash owe anything for June 16-30? Hmm, but the bill is for the entire period up to July 15, and it's paid on August 1. So as of June 30, the billing period isn't over yet. Wait, no, the period is June 16 to July 15. So as of June 30, part of that period has passed, but the bill isn't due until August 1. So, would Dash have a liability for the portion used up to June 30?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Typically, utility bills are billed after the period they cover. So when you get a bill for May 16-June 15, you pay it in July. But in this case, the payment dates are given as June 1, July 1, August 1.

Wait, let me re-express the data:

- The first bill (April 16-May15) is paid on June 1. So by June 30, that's paid.

- The second bill (May16-June15) is paid on July 1. So as of June 30, this hasn't been paid yet. So the $6,000 is a liability.

- The third bill (June16-July15) is paid on August 1. So by June 30, the billing period hasn't ended yet. The bill for June16-July15 is for the next period, but as of June 30, only up to June 30 has been consumed. So would that mean that Dash has incurred an expense for half of that period? Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the amounts are the total for each period. So the $8,000 is for the entire June16-July15 period. Since that period isn't over as of June 30, Dash hasn't received the bill yet, right? So they wouldn't have a liability for that yet. Because the bill would be for the entire period, and if it's not billed yet, they haven't accrued it.

Wait, but in reality, companies accrue expenses when they consume the utilities, regardless of when the bill arrives. So for the period June16-30, Dash has used utilities, so they should accrue the expense for that period. But the problem is that the question gives the amounts as fixed total for each period. So perhaps each billing is a fixed amount per period, regardless of actual usage.

Wait, the question says "the following information pertains to Dash Co.'s utility bills." So each billing covers a specific period, and the amounts are $5,000, $6,000, etc. So for the period June16-July15, the bill is $8,000, paid August 1. So as of June 30, the period up to June 30 is within the June16-July15 billing. So they've consumed half of that period. So should they accrue half of $8,000? But wait, the way the question is structured, each bill is for a specific period. So the $8,000 is the total for June16-July15. So by June 30, they've consumed part of that period. So they should recognize the expense and the liability for the portion used.

But I'm not sure if the question expects that level of detail, or if it's treating each bill as a fixed amount that's either fully owed or not. Because the options given don't have $4,000 as an option, which would be half of $8,000. So perhaps the question is considering only the bills that have been received but not paid.

Wait, let me think again. The second bill, which covers up to June 15, is paid on July 1. So as of June 30, that $6,000 is still a liability because the payment hasn't been made yet.

The third bill is for June16-July15, which hasn't been paid yet because it's paid on August 1. As of June 30, Dash has used utilities up to June 30, which is part of the June16-July15 period. So they should have an accrued liability for the portion used.

But without knowing the exact terms of how the billing works, perhaps the question is simplifying it, and only considering the bills that have been received but not paid. So the second bill ($6,000) is unpaid as of June 30, and the third bill hasn't been received yet, so it's not recognized as a liability.

Wait, but the third bill's period starts on June16, so as of June30, part of that period has been used, but the bill isn't received yet. So the company should accrue the expense and liability for the portion used, which is, say, half of $8,000. But the options don't include $4,000. So perhaps the question assumes that only the bills that have been received (i.e., invoiced) are considered as liabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the third bill is for the period starting June16, and as of June30, the invoice hasn't been received yet. So it's not recorded as a liability.

Wait, but the question provides the amounts of the bills for each period, so the $8,000 is for June16-July15. So as of June30, the company has consumed half of that period, so they should accrue $4,000 as an expense and a liability. But the options don't have $4,000, so maybe the question is considering that the liability isn't recorded until the bill is received.

Alternatively, perhaps the $8,000 bill isn't paid until August 1, so as of June30, it's not due yet, but the company has already used part of the period. So they should have a liability for the portion used.

But without an option that includes $6,000 plus a portion of $8,000, perhaps the intended answer is $6,000 only.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is $6,000. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $8,000
B: $5,000
C: $9,000
D: $13,000
E: $14,000
F: $15,000
G: $10,000
H: $12,000
I: $7,000
J: $6,000

So option J is $6,000, which corresponds to the second bill, which hasn't been paid yet. The first bill is paid on June1, so it's not a liability. The third bill's payment is after June30, but the question is whether the liability is recognized when the bill is received or when the service is consumed.

In accrual accounting, the expense is recognized when incurred, regardless of payment. So the utility expense for June16-30 should be accrued, creating a liability. But the amount of that liability depends on the rate. If the total bill for June16-July15 is $8,000, then for half the period (June16-30 is 15 days, assuming June has 30 days), the accrued liability would be $4,000 (since 15 days is half of 30? Wait, no, June16 to July15 is 30 days? Let me check: June has 30 days, so June16 to June30 is 15 days, July1-15 is 15 days, total 30. So as of June30, half the period has passed, so $4,000 would be the accrued liability.

So total liability as of June30 would be the $6,000 from the second bill (unpaid) plus $4,000 from the third bill's accrued portion, totaling $10,000. But looking at the options, G is $10,000. So is that the case?

Wait, but the second bill's period ends on June15, so as of June30, that bill is for May16-June15, paid on July1. So the $6,000 is unpaid as of June30, so it's a liability. Additionally, for the period June16-30, which is part of the next billing, the company has used utilities worth half of the $8,000 bill, so $4,000. So total liability is $6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000, which is option G.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the company hasn't received the third bill yet, so they don't know the exact amount. So they can't accrue based on the billed amount because they haven't received it. So maybe they only accrue what they've consumed based on their usage, but the problem doesn't give us the rate. So perhaps the question expects us to consider only the unpaid bills that have been received.

So the second bill is $6,000, which is unpaid as of June30. The third bill hasn't been received yet, so it's not recognized as a liability. So the total liability is $6,000, which is option J.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again about accrual vs. cash basis. The question is about the balance sheet, which uses accrual accounting.

In accrual accounting, the company should recognize the expense when incurred, not when the bill is paid. So for the period June16-30, they've incurred half of the $8,000 bill, so they should accrue $4,000. The $6,000 bill is unpaid, so it's a liability. So total liability is $6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000. So option G.

But wait, the third bill's total is $8,000, but we're only accrueing half, which is $4,000. So the liability is $6k + $4k = $10k.

Looking back at the options, option G is $10,000. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but another point: the first bill was paid on June1, so it's already paid. So no liability there.

Wait, but if the third bill is for June16-July15, and the company has used utilities up to June30, which is half the period, they should recognize half the bill as an expense and a liability. So that's $4,000.

So total liability is $6,000 (second bill) + $4,000 (accrued from third bill) = $10,000. So the answer should be G: $10,000.

Wait, but maybe the third bill isn't considered because it's not yet billed. So the company hasn't received the invoice for June16-July15 as of June30. So they can't recognize a liability for it unless they have the invoice. But in reality, companies accrue expenses when they are incurred, regardless of the invoice. So even without the invoice, they should accrue based on usage.

So yes, I think the correct answer is $10,000, option G.

To determine the amount Dash Co. should report as a liability in its June 30 balance sheet, we analyze the utility bills and their payment statuses:

1. **April 16 – May 15**: The bill for this period is $5,000, paid on June 1. Since the payment was made before June 30, this amount is no longer a liability as of the balance sheet date.

2. **May 16 – June 15**: The bill for this period is $6,000, paid on July 1. As of June 30, this payment has not been made, so the full $6,000 remains a liability.

3. **June 16 – July 15**: The bill for this period is $8,000, paid on August 1. As of June 30, only half of this period (June 16 – June 30) has passed. Using accrual accounting, Dash Co. should recognize a liability for the portion of the bill corresponding to the elapsed time. Since the total bill is $8,000 for 30 days, the liability for the first 15 days (June 16 – June 30) is $4,000.

Adding these amounts together, the total liability as of June 30 is:
- $6,000 (unpaid bill for May 16 – June 15)
- $4,000 (accrued liability for June 16 – June 30)

Thus, the total liability is **$10,000**.

From the given options:
- **G: $10,000** is the correct answer.

Answer: G
