Okay, so I've got this question about Rayleigh scattering, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what Rayleigh scattering is. From what I remember, it's the scattering of light by small particles or molecules, much smaller than the wavelength of the light. It's why the sky is blue, right? Because blue light scatters more than red.

The question says that light of wavelength 635 nm causes a certain amount of Rayleigh scattering. We need to find out which wavelength will give exactly 10 times as much scattering. The options are from A to J, each with different wavelengths.

I think the key here is the relationship between the scattering intensity and the wavelength. I remember that Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. So the formula should be something like I ∝ 1/λ⁴, where I is the intensity of the scattering and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, but wait. Since we're comparing two different wavelengths, I can set up a ratio. Let me denote the original wavelength as λ1 = 635 nm and the new wavelength as λ2, which is what we're trying to find. The original intensity is I1, and the new intensity is I2, which is 10 times I1 (I2 = 10 I1).

So according to the formula, I1/I2 = (λ2/λ1)^4. Oh wait, no, because I is proportional to 1/λ^4. So I1/I2 = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4). Because I1 = k*(1/λ1^4), I2 = k*(1/λ2^4), so I1/I2 = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4).

But in our case, I2 is 10 times I1, so I2 = 10 I1. So plugging in, I1/(10 I1) = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4) → 1/10 = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4).

We can rearrange this to find λ2 in terms of λ1. Let's see:

(λ2/λ1)^4 = 1/10 → λ2/λ1 = (1/10)^(1/4).

Hmm, what's the fourth root of 1/10? Let me think. The fourth root of 10 is about 1.778, so the fourth root of 1/10 would be approximately 0.5623. So λ2 ≈ 0.5623 * λ1.

Wait, no, because (λ2/λ1)^4 = 1/10 → (λ2/λ1) = (1/10)^(1/4) = (10)^(-1/4) ≈ 0.5623. So λ2 = λ1 * 0.5623.

But wait, wait a minute. Wait, because if the scattering is inversely proportional to λ^4, then a smaller wavelength would mean more scattering. So if I'm looking for a wavelength that gives 10 times more scattering than 635 nm, that means the new I is 10 times the original I. So 10 times more scattering than 635 nm.

Wait, let me clarify. If I1 is the scattering at 635 nm, and I2 is 10 I1, then I2 is greater, which implies that the new wavelength must be shorter than 635 nm because shorter wavelengths scatter more. So λ2 should be less than 635 nm.

Now, let's compute λ2.

λ2 = λ1 * (1/10)^(1/4) ≈ 635 nm * 0.5623 ≈ 357 nm. Because 635 times 0.56 is about 635 * 0.5 = 317.5, 635 * 0.06 is about 38.1, so total around 355.6 nm.

Looking at the options, option E is 357 nm. So that's the answer.

Let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute 635 divided by the fourth root of 10.

Fourth root of 10: 10^(1/4) is the same as sqrt(sqrt(10)). So sqrt(10) is about 3.1623, then sqrt(3.1623) is approximately 1.778. So 1/1.778 is approximately 0.5623. So 635 * 0.5623 ≈ 357 nm.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be E:357 nm.

Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, meaning the scattering intensity \( I \) follows the relationship:

\[
I \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4}
\]

Given that light of wavelength \( \lambda_1 = 635 \, \text{nm} \) produces a certain amount of scattering, we need to find the wavelength \( \lambda_2 \) that results in exactly 10 times as much scattering (\( I_2 = 10 I_1 \)).

Using the proportionality, we set up the ratio:

\[
\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \frac{\lambda_2^4}{\lambda_1^4}
\]

Substituting \( I_2 = 10 I_1 \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{10} = \frac{\lambda_2^4}{\lambda_1^4}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \lambda_2 \):

\[
\lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^{1/4}
\]

The fourth root of \( \frac{1}{10} \) is approximately \( 0.5623 \), so:

\[
\lambda_2 = 635 \cdot 0.5623 \approx 357 \, \text{nm}
\]

Thus, the wavelength that gives exactly 10 times as much scattering as 635 nm is approximately 357 nm. Among the given options, the closest match is **357 nm**.
