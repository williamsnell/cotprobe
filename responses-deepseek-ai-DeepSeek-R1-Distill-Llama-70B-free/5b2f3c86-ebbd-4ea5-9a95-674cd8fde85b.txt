Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.
"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Progressive Party Platform from 1912 and a muckraking author named Jacob A. Riis. The question is asking which quote from the excerpt best exemplifies Riis's book "How the Other Half Lives." 

First, I need to make sure I understand what the question is asking. Muckraking authors were known for exposing social ills and injustices, especially in the early 20th century. Jacob Riis, in particular, wrote about the harsh living conditions of the urban poor in New York City in his book. His work was instrumental in bringing about reforms related to housing and social conditions.

Now, looking at the Progressive Party Platform excerpt, the key points are about justice, the role of the people in government, equal opportunity, industrial justice, and the idea that the country's resources and institutions should serve the public welfare. 

The options given are direct quotes or paraphrases from the excerpt. I need to figure out which of these aligns with what Riis was highlighting in his work. 

Riis's book exposed the poor living conditions and the struggles of the working class, which relates to social inequality and the need for justice. So the quote that talks about industrial justice and equal opportunity seems relevant. Let me see the options.

Option C says "establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice." That sounds like it's about fairness in work and society, which fits with Riis's focus on the plight of the working poor. 

Another option is E: "Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered..." That's more about using the country's resources for the general good, which is also a progressive idea but perhaps broader than Riis's specific focus on social conditions.

Option G is "set the public welfare in the first place." While that's a key progressive stance, again, it's a bit broader. Riis was specifically about showing the need for industrial and social reforms.

So, putting it together, the best fit seems to be option C, as it directly relates to industrial justice and equal opportunity, which are themes that Riis's work addressed by exposing the harsh realities faced by the working class.
