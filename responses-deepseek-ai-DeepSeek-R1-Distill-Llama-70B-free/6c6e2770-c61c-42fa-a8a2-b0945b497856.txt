Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about push factors. Hmm, I remember that push and pull factors are terms used in migration studies. Push factors are reasons that make people want to leave their current place, while pull factors are the attractions that draw them to a new place. Right.

The question is asking which of the options is a push factor. Let me look at each option.

Option A: Good schools for children. Wait, good schools sound like a positive thing. If a place has good schools, that might make people want to move there, so that's more of a pull factor. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: An attractive retirement community elsewhere. Oh, wait, that's talking about a place elsewhere being attractive. So that's a pull factor because it's attracting people to move there. So B isn't a push factor.

Option C: A bustling city life. That sounds like something that would attract people, maybe for job opportunities or entertainment. So C is a pull factor.

Option D: Dissatisfaction with current jobs. Oh, that makes sense. If someone is unhappy with their job where they are, that's a reason to leave. So that's a push factor pushing them to move away.

Option E: Availability of public transport. That's something that makes a place more appealing, so a pull factor.

Option F: Friendly neighbors. That's a positive aspect, making people want to stay or move there, so pull factor.

Option G: A pleasant climate. Again, that's attractive, so pull factor.

Option H: Availability of recreational activities. That's also a pull factor because people are drawn to places with things to do.

So the only option that's a push factor is D, dissatisfaction with current jobs. That makes people want to leave their current location.

The push factor is dissatisfaction with current jobs, which makes people want to leave their current location.

Answer: D
