Question:

A psychologist believes that positive rewards for proper behavior are more effective than punishment for bad behavior in promoting good behavior in children. A scale of "proper behavior" is developed. μ1= the "proper behavior" rating for children receiving positive rewards, and μ2= the "proper behavior" rating for children receiving punishment. If H0: μ1− μ2= 0, which of the following is the proper statement of HA?

Options:

A: HA: μ1− μ2≤ 0
B: Any of the above is an acceptable alternative to the given null.
C: HA: μ2− μ1> 0
D: HA: μ1= μ2
E: HA: μ2− μ1< 0
F: HA: μ1− μ2≠ 0
G: HA: μ1− μ2< 0
H: HA: μ1− μ2= 1
I: HA: μ1− μ2> 0
J: HA: μ1− μ2≥ 0

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about hypothesis testing, specifically the null and alternative hypotheses. Alright, I remember that in hypothesis testing, we have the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (HA). They are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning one of them has to be true.

The question says that a psychologist believes positive rewards are more effective than punishment for promoting good behavior in children. So, they probably think that kids will behave better when rewarded than when punished. 

A scale is developed to measure "proper behavior." The variables are μ1, which is the rating for kids getting positive rewards, and μ2 for those getting punishment. The null hypothesis H0 is stated as μ1 - μ2 = 0. So, under H0, the difference between the two means is zero, meaning they're the same.

Now, the question is asking what the alternative hypothesis (HA) should be. The psychologist's belief is that positive rewards are better, so HA should reflect that μ1 is greater than μ2. Wait, no, let me think again. If positive rewards are more effective, then μ1 should be higher than μ2. So the difference μ1 - μ2 would be positive, right? So HA should state that μ1 - μ2 is greater than zero.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: HA: μ1 - μ2 ≤ 0. That would mean that the rewards are not better than punishment. So this doesn't align with the psychologist's belief.

Option B: Any of the above is acceptable. Hmm, that's vague. I don't think so because the alternative should directly contrast the null and reflect the research hypothesis.

Option C: HA: μ2 - μ1 > 0. That's the same as μ1 - μ2 < 0, implying punishment is better, which is the opposite of what we want.

Option D: HA: μ1 = μ2. That's the same as the null hypothesis. So that's not right because HA should be the opposite.

Option E: HA: μ2 - μ1 < 0. Again, this is same as μ1 - μ2 > 0, which would be correct because it suggests positive rewards are better. Wait, no. Wait, μ2 - μ1 < 0 means μ2 < μ1, which is what we want. So maybe E is correct? Or am I mixing up?

Wait, let me clarify. The alternative hypothesis is what the researcher expects. So if the researcher thinks rewards work better, then μ1 should be greater than μ2. So μ1 - μ2 > 0. So which option says that?

Looking again, Option I says HA: μ1 - μ2 > 0. That seems correct. But what about the other options?

Option F: HA: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0. That's a two-tailed test. But the question is about what's the proper statement. The researcher has a specific direction in mind, so the alternative should be one-tailed.

Option G: HA: μ1 - μ2 < 0. That would mean μ1 is less than μ2, which suggests punishment is better, so opposite of the belief.

Option H: HA: μ1 - μ2 = 1. That's a specific value, which doesn't make sense as an alternative hypothesis because it's not a range.

Option J: HA: μ1 - μ2 ≥ 0. That includes equal and greater, so it's a one-tailed test but includes the equality. But the alternative is usually stated without including the equal part, so I think it's better to have just > 0.

Wait, so the alternative hypothesis can be written in two ways: either as a one-tailed (directional) or two-tailed (non-directional). But since the researcher has a specific belief, it's directional.

So the correct HA should be μ1 - μ2 > 0. Looking at the options, that's option I.

Wait, but option E is μ2 - μ1 < 0. Which is the same as μ1 > μ2, so that's the same as option I. So E and I are equivalent, but looking at the options, which one is correct?

The options are:

C: μ2−μ1> 0 → which is same as μ1 < μ2 → not what we want.

E: μ2−μ1 < 0 → same as μ1 > μ2 → correct.

I: μ1−μ2>0 → same as E.

So both E and I are correct statements? But the options are separate. Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, the question says that HA is the alternative. The options are different. So, looking again:

Option I is HA: μ1−μ2>0. That's correct.

Option E is HA: μ2−μ1 < 0. Which is the same as μ1 > μ2, so that's also correct.

So both E and I are correct. But looking at the options, E and I are separate.

Wait, but the question is which is the proper statement of HA. So both E and I are correct, but the correct answer would depend on the options given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The null hypothesis is μ1 - μ2 = 0. The alternative, if the researcher believes that rewards are better (μ1 > μ2), then HA is μ1 - μ2 > 0, which is option I.

Alternatively, if you frame it as μ2 - μ1 < 0, which is the same thing, that's option E.

So both options I and E are correct expressions of the same alternative. But how does that work in the options given? Let me check:

Looking back, the options are:

A: HA: μ1− μ2 ≤ 0 → No.

B: Any of the above → I don't think so.

C: HA: μ2− μ1> 0 → No.

D: HA: μ1= μ2 → No.

E: HA: μ2− μ1< 0 → Yes, same as μ1>μ2.

F: HA: μ1− μ2≠ 0 → Two-tailed, not specific.

G: HA: μ1− μ2< 0 → No.

H: HA: μ1− μ2= 1 → No.

I: HA: μ1− μ2> 0 → Yes.

J: HA: μ1− μ2≥ 0 → Includes =, which is part of H0.

Wait, so both E and I are correct, but the options list them as separate. But the question is which is the proper statement. So perhaps the correct answer is either E or I. But in typical hypothesis setup, the alternative is written in terms of the researcher's expectation. Since the researcher expects μ1 > μ2, the alternative is μ1 - μ2 > 0, which is option I.

But then again, option E is mathematically equivalent. So which one is correct according to the options given?

Wait, perhaps looking at the options, the correct answer is option I. Because the way the question is phrased, the alternative is about μ1 and μ2, so expressing it in terms of μ1 - μ2 makes sense.

Alternatively, the correct answer could be E, but I'm a bit confused because both seem correct. Wait, but in terms of standard hypothesis testing, the alternative is usually written as a statement about the parameter being greater than or less than the null hypothesis value.

So, considering that H0 is μ1 - μ2 = 0, HA would be μ1 - μ2 > 0, which is option I. So I think the correct answer is option I.

The question involves hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis (H0) is μ1 - μ2 = 0, and the alternative hypothesis (HA) must reflect the psychologist's belief that positive rewards (μ1) are more effective than punishment (μ2) in promoting good behavior. This implies that μ1 > μ2, or equivalently, μ1 - μ2 > 0.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: HA: μ1 - μ2 ≤ 0. This suggests that rewards are not better than punishment, which contradicts the psychologist's belief. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: "Any of the above is an acceptable alternative to the given null." This is vague and incorrect because the alternative hypothesis must directly contrast the null hypothesis and align with the researcher's expectation.
- **Option C**: HA: μ2 - μ1 > 0. This implies punishment is better than rewards, which is the opposite of the psychologist's belief. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: HA: μ1 = μ2. This is the same as the null hypothesis and does not serve as a valid alternative hypothesis. Incorrect.
- **Option E**: HA: μ2 - μ1 < 0. This is mathematically equivalent to μ1 > μ2, which aligns with the psychologist's belief. Correct.
- **Option F**: HA: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0. This is a two-tailed test and does not reflect the specific directional belief of the psychologist. Incorrect.
- **Option G**: HA: μ1 - μ2 < 0. This implies μ1 < μ2, which suggests punishment is better than rewards. Incorrect.
- **Option H**: HA: μ1 - μ2 = 1. This specifies a particular value and is not a valid alternative hypothesis. Incorrect.
- **Option I**: HA: μ1 - μ2 > 0. This directly reflects the psychologist's belief that rewards are better than punishment. Correct.
- **Option J**: HA: μ1 - μ2 ≥ 0. This includes equality, which is part of the null hypothesis, and is not the standard way to express the alternative hypothesis. Incorrect.

Both **Option E** and **Option I** are mathematically equivalent and correct, as they both express the idea that μ1 > μ2. However, in standard hypothesis testing, the alternative hypothesis is typically written in terms of the parameter being tested (μ1 - μ2), making **Option I** the most appropriate choice.
