Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the decomposition of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) into sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and oxygen gas (O2). Specifically, I need to find out how much NaNO3 is required to produce 1.50 grams of O2.

Hmm, first, I remember that chemical reactions follow stoichiometric ratios, so I should start by writing the balanced chemical equation for this decomposition. I think the unbalanced equation is something like NaNO3 → NaNO2 + O2. Let me check that. 

Wait, sodium nitrate is NaNO3, and when it decomposes, it forms sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and oxygen. So the equation is indeed NaNO3 → NaNO2 + O2. Now I need to balance this equation.

Looking at the elements, on the left I have Na, N, and O. On the right, same elements. Let's count each atom:

Na: 1 on each side (so that's balanced for Na).
N: 1 on each side as well. Wait, no. Because NaNO3 has one N, NaNO2 also has one. So N is balanced? Hmm, maybe.

Oxygen: Let me count. NaNO3 has 3 O. NaNO2 has 2 O. And O2 is O2, which is 2 O atoms. So:

Left side: 3 O (from NaNO3).
Right side: 2 O (from NaNO2) + 2 O (from O2) → total 4 O. Oh wait, that doesn't balance. So I need to adjust the coefficients.

Hmm, maybe I should balance the oxygen. Let me think. Let's put a coefficient in front of NaNO3. Let's say it's 2 NaNO3 → ... Let me see.

If I have 2 NaNO3, that's 2 Na, 2 N, and 6 O on the left.

On the right side, suppose I have 2 NaNO2 and some O2. Let's see:

2 NaNO2 gives 2 Na, 2 N, and 4 O. So 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2.

Wait, the O from NaNO3 is 6 O. The O from NaNO2 is 4 O. So the difference is 2 O, which would be O2. So O2 is one molecule? Let me check:

2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2.

Yes, that balances. Let me count each element:

Na: 2 on each side.
N: 2 on each side.
O: left has 6 (2×3), right has 4 (2×2) + 2 (1×2) → 6. So it's balanced! Okay, so the balanced equation is 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2.

Now, the next step is to find the molar relationships. The problem gives me the mass of O2 produced, which is 1.50 grams. I need to find out how many moles of O2 that is, then use the mole ratio from the equation to find moles of NaNO3, and finally convert that to grams.

So, first, the molar mass of O2. O has an atomic mass of 16 g/mol, so O2 is 32 g/mol. 

Moles of O2 = mass / molar mass = 1.50 g / 32 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1.5 divided by 32 is 0.046875 moles of O2.

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaNO3 produce 1 mole of O2. So the mole ratio is 2:1 (NaNO3 to O2).

That means moles of NaNO3 = 2 × moles of O2 = 2 × 0.046875 = 0.09375 moles.

Now I need the molar mass of NaNO3 to convert moles to grams. Let me calculate that.

Na is approximately 23 g/mol, N is 14, and O is 16×3=48. So 23 +14 +48 = 85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, Na is 22.99, N is 14.01, O is 16.00. So more precisely: 22.99 +14.01 = 37, plus 48 (3×16) → 85.00 g/mol.

So, mass of NaNO3 needed is moles × molar mass = 0.09375 mol ×85 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 0.09375 ×85. Hmm, 0.09 ×85 is 7.65, and 0.00375 ×85 is 0.31875. Adding them gives 7.65 +0.31875=7.96875 grams. Approximately 7.97 grams.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

Molar mass of O2: 32.00 g/mol. 1.50g /32.00 g/mol = 0.046875 mol O2.

From the reaction, 2 moles NaNO3 → 1 mole O2 → so moles of NaNO3 is 2 ×0.046875=0.09375 mol.

Molar mass of NaNO3: 22.99 (Na) +14.01 (N) + 3*16.00 (O) → 22.99+14.01=37, +48=85.00 g/mol.

Mass = 0.09375 mol *85 g/mol = 7.96875 grams, which is about 7.97 grams. Looking at the options, option J is 7.97 g.

Wait, but the options list J as 7.97, which matches. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait a second. I just realized I might have made a mistake. Let me check the balanced equation again. I had 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2. So for every 2 moles of NaNO3, I get 1 mole of O2. So the ratio is correct.

Another way to approach the problem is using stoichiometric ratios. So moles of O2 is 1.5g /32 g/mol=0.046875 mol. The mole ratio NaNO3 to O2 is 2:1, so moles of NaNO3 is 0.046875 *2=0.09375. Multiply by 85 g/mol, and it's 7.96875, so 7.97g. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option J.

To determine how much NaNO₃ must decompose to produce 1.50 g of O₂, we start with the balanced chemical equation:

\[
2 \, \text{NaNO}_3 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{NaNO}_2 + \text{O}_2
\]

From the equation, 2 moles of NaNO₃ produce 1 mole of O₂. This establishes a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 between NaNO₃ and O₂.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of O₂
The molar mass of O₂ is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of O}_2 = 2 \times 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 32.00 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The number of moles of O₂ is:

\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{\text{Mass of O}_2}{\text{Molar mass of O}_2} = \frac{1.50 \, \text{g}}{32.00 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.046875 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of NaNO₃
Using the stoichiometric ratio (2:1), the moles of NaNO₃ required are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaNO}_3 = 2 \times \text{Moles of O}_2 = 2 \times 0.046875 \, \text{mol} = 0.09375 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate mass of NaNO₃
The molar mass of NaNO₃ is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of NaNO}_3 = 22.99 \, (\text{Na}) + 14.01 \, (\text{N}) + 3 \times 16.00 \, (\text{O}) = 85.00 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of NaNO₃ is:

\[
\text{Mass of NaNO}_3 = \text{Moles of NaNO}_3 \times \text{Molar mass of NaNO}_3 = 0.09375 \, \text{mol} \times 85.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 7.96875 \, \text{g}
\]

### Final Answer
The mass of NaNO₃ required is approximately **7.97 g**, which corresponds to option **J**.
