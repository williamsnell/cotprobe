Question:

One of the two principal methods for the determination of viscosities of gases is thePoiseuille'sflow experiment. In this experiment, a sample of air at 298°K was allowed to flow through a tube with radius 1mm and length 1m. Pressures at both ends of the tube were 765 mm Hg and 760 mm Hg respectively. A volume of 90.2 cm^3 measured at the lower pressure of 760 mm Hg passed through the tube after 100 sec. Calculate the viscosity of air at this temperature.

Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the viscosity of air using Poiseuille's flow experiment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me some parameters. The air is at 298 K. There's a tube with radius 1 mm and length 1 m. The pressures at the ends are 765 mm Hg and 760 mm Hg. So the pressure difference is 765 - 760 = 5 mm Hg. Oh, wait, but I need to convert that into Pascals because the standard unit for pressure in SI is Pascals. Right, 1 mm Hg is about 133.322 Pascals. So 5 mm Hg would be 5 * 133.322 = 666.61 Pa. But wait, the formula might require the pressure gradient, which is the pressure difference over the length. Since the tube is 1 m long, the gradient would be 666.61 Pa/m.

Next, they mention that a volume of 90.2 cm³ was measured at the lower pressure (760 mm Hg) after 100 seconds. Oh, wait, because gases are compressible, the volume measured at different pressures needs to be adjusted. I think I should convert this volume to the same pressure as the other end, or perhaps use the average pressure? Or maybe apply the ideal gas law correction.

Wait, the volume is measured at 760 mm Hg, the lower pressure. So when the gas flows through the tube, it's under a pressure difference. But the volume flow rate would be adjusted based on the pressure. Alternatively, I think the formula requires the volume flow rate at the pressure where it's being measured. Hmm. Let me think more clearly.

The formula for Poiseuille's law for viscosity is (eta) = (π * r^4 * ΔP * L) / (8 * V * t). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, more accurately, the volumetric flow rate Q is given by Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L). Rearranging for η, it should be η = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 Q L). Wait, but I might have the formula mixed up. Let me get that right.

Wait, Poiseuille's law says that the flow rate (volume per unit time) is proportional to the pressure gradient and the fourth power of the radius, and inversely proportional to the viscosity and length. So the formula is Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L). So solving for η, it's η = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 Q L).

Wait a moment, but what are the units here? Let's make sure I'm using SI units. The radius is given in mm, so I need to convert that to meters. The radius r is 1 mm = 0.001 m. The length L is 1 m.

The pressure difference ΔP is 5 mm Hg, which I converted to 666.61 Pa earlier. But wait, since the pressures are 765 and 760 mm Hg, the actual pressure gradient is (765 - 760) mm Hg over the tube length. Since the tube is 1 m long, the pressure gradient is 5 mm Hg per meter. So ΔP is 5 mm Hg, but I think I should calculate it correctly.

Wait, no, the pressure difference is 5 mm Hg across the entire length of the tube, which is 1 m. So the pressure gradient (ΔP per unit length) is 5 mm Hg/m. But wait, no, the formula might just use the total ΔP, not the gradient. Let me double-check. Oh, right, in Poiseuille's law, ΔP is the pressure difference across the tube, so for a 1 m tube, the ΔP is 5 mm Hg, which is 666.61 Pa.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes it's the pressure gradient (ΔP/L). Let me think again. Poiseuille's formula uses the pressure difference (ΔP) across the length L. So if the entire tube is length L, then the pressure gradient is ΔP/L. But in the formula, it's (ΔP) multiplied by r^4, etc. So I think I was correct earlier that η = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 Q L). Wait, no, maybe the formula is η = (π r^4 (ΔP) ) / (8 Q L). Hmm, let me confirm the formula.

Alternatively, I've heard the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is the same thing. The flow rate Q is (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L). So solving for η gives η = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 Q L).

Wait, but wait, in some sources, the formula is Q = (π r^4 (P1 - P2) ) / (8 η L), where P1 and P2 are the pressures at the two ends. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the flow rate Q is the volume per second. The measured volume is 90.2 cm³ in 100 seconds. So Q is 90.2 cm³ / 100 s. But wait, because it's measured at 760 mm Hg, while the pressure at the other end is higher. So I think I need to correct the volume for the pressure difference.

Wait, gases are compressible, so the volume at different pressures would change. So the actual flow rate in terms of volume at the higher pressure would be different. Hmm, maybe I should use the ideal gas law to find the volume at STP or something. Alternatively, perhaps the volume should be adjusted based on the pressure.

Wait, the volume measured is at 760 mm Hg, and the other end is at 765 mm Hg. So the average pressure might be (765 + 760)/2 = 762.5 mm Hg. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe the flow rate should be calculated as the volume at the lower pressure, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the volume is measured at the lower pressure, so the flow rate is that volume per time. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says a volume of 90.2 cm³ measured at the lower pressure. So the flow rate is 90.2 cm³ per 100 seconds. But since the pressure is lower, the number of moles is the same as if it were at higher pressure, but the volume changes. Wait, but in Poiseuille's law, the volumetric flow rate is in m³/s, but the issue here is that the measured volume is at a different pressure than the average pressure in the tube. So perhaps I need to adjust the volume to the same pressure as the ends.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as the flow rate being proportional to the average pressure. Or maybe since the pressure difference is small (only 5 mm Hg), the effect is negligible and we can ignore it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the volume should be corrected using Boyle's law.

Boyle's law states that P1 V1 = P2 V2, at constant temperature. So if the gas flows from higher pressure (765 mm Hg) to lower (760 mm Hg), then the volume measured at 760 mm Hg would be V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1. But wait, in this case, the volume is measured at the lower pressure end. Hmm, perhaps I should adjust the measured volume to the pressure at the other end.

Wait, wait, maybe the flow rate Q in the formula is the volume per second at the pressure P. So if the volume is measured at 760 mm Hg, perhaps I should find the equivalent volume at the higher pressure (765 mm Hg) or perhaps find the average. Alternatively, perhaps the formula assumes that Q is the volume flow rate at the average pressure. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can ignore the pressure difference since it's small (only 5 mm Hg), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the average pressure and correct the volume to that pressure.

Wait, let's think more carefully. The flow rate in the tube is driven by the pressure difference. The volumetric flow rate is the volume passing through per unit time. But when the gas leaves the tube at the lower pressure end, it's expanding to that pressure. So the volume measured (90.2 cm³) is the volume at 760 mm Hg. But in the tube, the average pressure might be higher. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Q uses the volume under the same conditions as the pressure. So if the pressure at the lower end is 760 mm Hg, and the volume is measured there, then maybe no correction is needed. So Q would be 90.2 cm³ / 100 s = 0.902 cm³/s. Wait, but the units need to be in m³/s. So 0.902 cm³ is 0.902e-6 m³. So 0.902e-6 m³ / 100 s = 9.02e-9 m³/s.

Wait, no, 100 seconds is the time. So 90.2 cm³ in 100 seconds is 0.902 cm³/s. So 0.902 cm³/s is equal to 0.902e-6 m³/s, since 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³.

But now, going back to the formula η = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 Q L). Let's plug in the numbers.

r is 1 mm, which is 0.001 m. So r^4 is (0.001)^4 = 1e-12 m^4.

ΔP is 5 mm Hg, which is 5 * 133.322 = 666.61 Pa.

Q is 0.902e-6 m³/s.

L is 1 m.

So putting it all together:

η = (π * (1e-12) * 666.61) / (8 * 0.902e-6 * 1) 

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: π * 1e-12 * 666.61 = π * 666.61e-12.

Denominator: 8 * 0.902e-6 = 7.216e-6.

So numerator: approx 3.1416 * 666.61e-12 = 2093.6e-12 ≈ 2.0936e-9.

Denominator: 7.216e-6.

So η = 2.0936e-9 / 7.216e-6 = (2.0936 / 7.216) * 1e-3.

Calculate 2.0936 ÷ 7.216:

Approx 2.0936 /7.216 ≈ 0.290.

So 0.290 * 1e-3 = 2.90e-4 kg m^-1 s^-1?

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are around 1e-5. Oh wait, that's 2.9e-4, but the options are in the 1e-5 range. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let's re-calculate. Maybe I messed up the exponent.

Wait, numerator: π * 1e-12 * 666.61 = 3.1416 * 666.61e-12 = ?

3.1416 * 666.61 = approx 2093. Then 2093e-12 is 2.093e-9.

Denominator: 8 * 0.902e-6 = 7.216e-6.

So 2.093e-9 / 7.216e-6 = (2.093 / 7.216) * 1e-3.

Wait, 2.093 /7.216 is approx 0.29, so 0.29e-3 is 2.9e-4 kg m^-1 s^-1. So that's 2.9e-4, which is higher than the options given. Hmm, but the options are much lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the pressure calculation. Let's re-examine the pressure difference.

The pressure at the two ends are 765 mm Hg and 760 mm Hg. So ΔP is 765 -760 = 5 mm Hg. But wait, in Poiseuille's formula, is it the pressure drop along the tube? Yes, because it's the driving force for the flow.

But wait, maybe I should express the pressure in Pascals correctly.

1 mm Hg is 133.322368 pascals. So 5 mm Hg is 5 * 133.322368 = 666.61184 Pa.

So that part is correct.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. Is the formula correct?

Another way: The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L). So solving for η gives η = (π r^4 ΔP)/(8 Q L).

But maybe I mixed up ΔP and the pressure gradient. Oh wait, wait, no, ΔP is the pressure difference across the length L. So the pressure gradient is ΔP/L, but the formula uses ΔP, not the gradient. So the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating Q. Let me check.

The volume is 90.2 cm³ at 760 mm Hg, but it's flowing through the tube into that pressure. So perhaps the flow rate should be adjusted for the pressure.

Wait, perhaps the volume as measured at the lower pressure is not the same as the actual volume in the tube at higher pressure. Hmm, so maybe I should use the ideal gas law to find the volume at the same pressure as the other end.

Wait, but the other end is at 765 mm Hg, and the volume is measured at 760 mm Hg. So to find the equivalent volume at 765 mm Hg, I can use Boyle's law: V1 * P1 = V2 * P2.

Here, V1 is the volume at 760 mm Hg, and we want V2 at 765 mm Hg. So V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2) = 90.2 cm³ * (760 / 765).

So 760/765 ≈ 0.993. So V2 ≈ 90.2 * 0.993 ≈ 89.6 cm³.

So the flow rate under the higher pressure would be 89.6 cm³ per 100 s, which is 0.896 cm³/s. Converting to m³/s: 0.896e-6 m³/s.

Wait, but is this necessary? Because the flow rate in the tube is driven by the pressure difference, and the actual volume passing through would be the same in moles, but the volume changes based on pressure. So perhaps I should use the average pressure to find the correct volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula expects the volume to be corrected to the same pressure as used in the calculation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: the flow rate in the formula is the volumetric flow rate at the pressure P. Since in the experiment, the volume is measured at 760 mm Hg, but the pressure difference is 5 mm Hg, perhaps the correct way is to compute the flow rate at the average pressure.

The average pressure would be (765 + 760)/2 = 762.5 mm Hg.

So using Boyle's law, V_avg = V_measured * (P_measured / P_avg). So P_measured is 760 mm Hg, P_avg is 762.5 mm Hg.

So V_avg = 90.2 cm³ * (760 / 762.5) ≈ 90.2 * (0.997) ≈ 90.0 cm³.

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the flow rate should be measured at the average pressure, so I can compute the correct Q.

Wait, but the formula for Q is based on the pressure difference, so perhaps the volume should be adjusted to the same conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's not necessary because the pressure difference is small, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the volume measured is at 760 mm Hg, so the actual flow rate in terms of volume per second is 90.2 cm³/100s, but since the gas is expanding, perhaps the effective flow rate is higher. Wait, no, because the volume is measured after expansion.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles, then find the equivalent volume at standard conditions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without correcting the volume, and see what happens, then see if the answer is among the options.

Wait, earlier when I calculated without correcting the volume, I got η ≈ 2.9e-4 kg m^-1 s^-1, which is 2.9e-4. But the options are all in the 1e-5 range, so that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

η = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 Q L)

r = 0.001 m → r^4 = (0.001)^4 = 1e-12 m^4.

ΔP = 5 mm Hg = 666.61 Pa.

Q = volume per second: 90.2 cm³ = 90.2e-6 m³ → 90.2e-6 m³ / 100 s = 0.902e-6 m³/s.

So:

Numerator: π * 1e-12 * 666.61 ≈ 3.1416 * 666.61e-12 ≈ 2.093e-9.

Denominator: 8 * 0.902e-6 * 1 → 7.216e-6.

So η = 2.093e-9 / 7.216e-6 → 2.093e-9 / 7.216e-6 = (2.093 / 7.216) * 1e-3.

Calculating 2.093 / 7.216 ≈ 0.290 → 0.290e-3 = 2.9e-4 kg m^-1 s^-1.

Hmm, but that's 2.9e-4, which is 0.00029. But the options are all around 1e-5, which is ten times smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent somewhere.

Wait, wait, let
