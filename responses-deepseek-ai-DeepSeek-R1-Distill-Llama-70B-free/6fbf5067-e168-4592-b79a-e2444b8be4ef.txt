Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question about John's inability to remember the pictures on coins and bills. Let's see what the question says. John has been handling money for 17 years but can't identify any of the pictures on the penny, nickel, dime, etc. His teacher is offering him money for each correct identification, but he can't do it. So the question is asking why he can't remember these images despite handling money so long.

The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option and think about what they mean.

Option A: Sensory memory decay. Sensory memory is the very brief storage of information in the senses, like what you see for a split second after looking away. But John's problem isn't about immediate decay; he's handled money for years, so this doesn't fit.

Option B: Retroactive interference. This is when new information interferes with old memories, making you forget the old ones. But does that apply here? John's been using money for so long without any issue, I'm not sure new info is causing this.

Option C: Failure to encode. Encoding is the process of transferring information from short-term to long-term memory. If he didn't encode the information in the first place, he wouldn't remember. But he's been handling money for 17 years, so maybe he did encode it at some point. Hmm, maybe not, though. Maybe he never really paid attention to the details.

Option D: Failure to reconstruct. Reconstruction is more about how we piece together memories, especially when they're incomplete. But if John can't recall any images, it's more about not having the memory stored rather than not reconstructing it.

Option E: False memory formation. That's when you remember things that didn't happen or misremember. But the question is about not remembering, not about false memories. So probably not E.

Option F: Lack of attention. Attention is crucial for encoding. If John never paid attention to the faces on the coins and bills when he was handling money, then he wouldn't have encoded the information in the first place. That sounds plausible. Because even if you handle something, without attention, it doesn't get into long-term memory.

Option G: Failure to retrieve. That's when the information is stored, but you can't access it. But if John has been handling money without paying attention, maybe the info wasn't stored, so it's not a retrieval issue.

Option H: Confabulation. That's when you fill in gaps in memory with made-up information. But John isn't making up answers; he just can't identify them. So not H.

Option I: Deep processing. Deep processing involves elaborating on information, making it more memorable. If he didn't process the images deeply, he might not remember. But this relates more to encoding, similar to failure to encode or lack of attention.

Option J: Proactive interference. This is when old information interferes with new learning. For example, forgetting a new phone number because the old one is still remembered. But in John's case, he's not trying to learn new things; he's just not remembering old ones. So proactive interference doesn't seem to fit here.

So, putting it together, John's inability is likely because he never paid attention to the details of the coins and bills, so the information wasn't properly encoded into his long-term memory. This would mean the answer is either C (failure to encode) or F (lack of attention). Wait, but failure to encode is a broader concept. Encoding can happen through various means, and lack of attention is a specific reason for failure to encode. So the root cause here is that he didn't pay attention, so the information wasn't encoded in the first place.

Alternatively, maybe he did encode some information, but over time, he forgot it. But the question says he's been handling money for 17 years, so it's more about the initial encoding rather than forgetting over time.

Wait, but another angle: maybe he's suffering from inattention, which prevented encoding. So the problem is lack of attention during encoding. So the correct answer would be F: lack of attention.

But wait, another thought. Failure to encode (C) is a more general term. Lack of attention (F) is a specific reason for that failure. So which is the better option? The question is about the most likely reason. Since John has been handling money for so long, but if he never paid attention to the faces (maybe he was focused on the denominations or using them without looking), then the lack of attention would prevent encoding.

So I think the correct answer is either C or F. But the options separate these as different choices. So which is more accurate?

I remember that "failure to encode" is when the information doesn't get into long-term memory. Lack of attention is a cause of that. So the question is phrased as "results from," so the underlying reason is lack of attention leading to failure to encode.

Wait, but the options are separate. So the question is about what his inability "most likely results from." So the options are the reasons. So the options are the causes, not the effects.

So if he didn't pay attention (F), that would cause failure to encode (C). But the question is asking for the reason of his inability. So is the reason lack of attention or failure to encode?

Hmm. The question is about why he can't remember, so the reason is that he never encoded the information. So the direct cause is failure to encode, which would be option C. But lack of attention (F) is a reason for that failure to encode.

Wait, maybe the question is pointing to failure to encode as the reason. Because he handled money but didn't encode the information. So perhaps the answer is F: lack of attention, because without attention, he didn't encode.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

If someone doesn't pay attention when they encounter something, they won't encode it into memory. So John's inability is because he didn't pay attention when he was handling the money over the years. Therefore, the reason is lack of attention (F), leading to failure to encode. But since the options are separate, which is the correct answer?

Wait, the options are about the cause. So the options are about what process is failing. So the problem is that he didn't encode the information because he didn't pay attention. But which option is correct?

Looking back, the options are:

C: Failure to encode

F: Lack of attention

So the question is about the reason for his inability. The inability is due to not having the information stored, which is failure to encode. But why did he fail to encode? Because he didn't pay attention.

Wait, but the options are the possible reasons. So which is more correct? The question is phrased as "results from," so the underlying cause.

In psychology, the levels of processing theory suggests that deeper processing (like semantic processing) leads to better recall. If John was handling money but not paying attention to the faces (maybe just the value), he wouldn't encode the visual details. So this lack of attention during encoding would mean that the information wasn't stored in the first place.

So the reason is failure to encode because he wasn't paying attention. So the cause is failure to encode (C), but the underlying reason is lack of attention (F). Hmm, but the options are separate. So the question is, which is the correct answer.

Wait, another approach: Sensory input must be attended to be encoded. So if he didn't pay attention, he didn't encode. So the immediate cause is failure to encode, but the reason is lack of attention.

So the question is, which is the more direct cause? The answer options are the reasons for the inability. So the inability is because he can't retrieve the information. Wait, no, the question states he can't identify any, implying he doesn't remember them. So it's a storage issue, not retrieval.

So storage issues come from encoding failures. So the reason is failure to encode, which is C. But why did he fail to encode? Because he didn't pay attention (F). So which is the correct answer? The question is about the result, so the answer is the process that failed, which is failure to encode.

Wait, but maybe the intended answer is F: lack of attention. Because without attention, you can't encode. So perhaps the answer is F.

I'm a bit torn. Let me think about similar questions I've seen. I recall that when information isn't encoded into long-term memory, it's often because of lack of attention during the initial exposure. So the problem is that he didn't pay attention when handling the money, so the information wasn't encoded.

Therefore, the correct answer would be F: lack of attention.

Wait, but wait. The question is about why he can't remember, so the reason is that the information wasn't stored. So that's failure to encode. So the correct answer is C.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. But I think the key here is that encoding requires attention. So without attention, you don't encode. So the inability is due to failure to encode, which was caused by lack of attention.

So the options are about what process is failing. The question is about the reason, so the answer is C or F.

Another angle: Let's think about the structure of memory. Information first goes into sensory memory, then short-term, then long-term if encoded. If John didn't pay attention, the information wouldn't move from sensory to short-term, so it's not stored. So the problem is failure to encode, which is C.

But wait, another thought: If he didn't pay attention, the information never made it past sensory memory. So it's a failure to even get into short-term memory, which is part of encoding.

So perhaps the correct answer is F: lack of attention, because without attention, the encoding doesn't happen.

Alternatively, the question could be testing the concept of whether information was ever stored. If it wasn't stored, it's a failure to encode, regardless of why.

I think in this case, the correct answer is C: failure to encode.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In the scenario, John has handled money for 17 years but can't identify the pictures. So he must have used the money, but perhaps didn't pay attention to the faces. So the information (the images) was never encoded into his memory because he wasn't attending to them. Therefore, the reason is lack of attention, which prevented encoding. But the problem is that he can't retrieve the information because it's not stored.

So the underlying reason is lack of attention, but the process that failed is encoding.

Wait, the options are:

C: failure to encode

F: lack of attention

So the question is about why he can't remember. The most direct reason is that he didn't encode the information because he wasn't paying attention.

So which option is more accurate? I think the answer is C: failure to encode. Because the question is about the result, which is inability to retrieve, implying the information wasn't stored, which is due to failure to encode.

Alternatively, the correct answer might be F, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the better approach is to recall that the initial step in memory is attention. Without attention, the information isn't encoded. So John's inability is because he never encoded the information, which is due to lack of attention. So the underlying reason is F, but the process is C.

But the options are separate, and the question is about the result. So perhaps the correct answer is C: failure to encode.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about exam questions. For example, a student who doesn't study for a test will fail because they didn't encode the information. The reason is failure to encode. But if a student tries to study but keeps getting distracted (lack of attention), that's a failure to encode because they weren't focusing.

So in John's case, he's had the opportunity but didn't encode because he wasn't paying attention. So the problem is lack of attention leading to failure to encode.

But the question is about the reason for his inability. So which is the correct answer? The answer options are processes, so the correct answer is C: failure to encode.

Alternatively, the correct answer is F: lack of attention.

Wait, another approach: The question is about why he can't remember. If the information was never stored (failure to encode), then he can't retrieve it. So the reason is failure to encode, which is C. But the cause of that failure is lack of attention.

So the question is asking for the reason for his inability, which is the process. So the answer is C: failure to encode.

But I'm not entirely certain. I've seen similar questions where lack of attention is the reason for forgetting, so maybe F is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: failure to retrieve. But that doesn't make sense because if he's been handling money for 17 years and still can't remember, it's more likely that the info wasn't stored rather than an inability to retrieve.

So, to sum up, the options narrow down to either C or F. It's a bit tricky, but I think the correct answer is C: failure to encode.

Wait, no. Wait, another thought. John's problem is that he can't identify the pictures, even though he's handled money for years. So he must have encoded some information about the money, like its value, but not the pictures. So he didn't encode the visual details. So the reason is that he didn't pay attention to the faces, leading to failure to encode them. So the answer is F: lack of attention.

But I think I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about why he can't remember, which points to the information not being stored, which is failure to encode.

So after all this thinking, I'm going to go with C: failure to encode.

The question asks why John, despite handling money for 17 years, cannot identify the pictures on coins and bills. The key lies in understanding the psychological processes involved in memory. 

John's inability to remember the images suggests that the information was never properly stored in his long-term memory. This points to a failure in encoding, as encoding is the process by which information is transferred from short-term to long-term memory. Without proper encoding, the information cannot be retrieved later.

The options were analyzed as follows:

- **A: Sensory memory decay** and **B: Retroactive interference** were ruled out because they do not align with the scenario. Sensory memory decay refers to the brief retention of sensory information, and retroactive interference involves new information disrupting old memories, which is not relevant here.
- **C: Failure to encode** is a strong candidate because it directly addresses the inability to store information in long-term memory. If John did not encode the visual details of the coins and bills, he would not be able to remember them.
- **D: Failure to reconstruct** and **E: False memory formation** were dismissed because they pertain to how memories are retrieved or distorted, not to the inability to store information in the first place.
- **F: Lack of attention** is closely related because attention is necessary for encoding. If John did not pay attention to the faces on the coins and bills, he would not have encoded the information. However, lack of attention is a specific cause of failure to encode, and the question asks for the broader reason.
- **G: Failure to retrieve** was ruled out because the issue seems to be with storage, not access to stored information.
- **H: Confabulation**, **I: Deep processing**, and **J: Proactive interference** were deemed irrelevant to the scenario.

The most direct explanation for John's inability to remember the images is that the information was never encoded into his long-term memory. While lack of attention (F) is a contributing factor, the broader psychological process at play is failure to encode (C). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Failure to encode**
