Okay, so I have this question about the coefficient of elasticity. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that elasticity has something to do with how responsive one variable is to another. Like, price elasticity of demand or something like that. But wait, what exactly is the coefficient of elasticity?

The question gives me several options, labeled A to J. I need to pick the right one. Let me think about what elasticity means. I think elasticity measures the responsiveness of a dependent variable to a change in an independent variable. Oh right, like if the price of a good increases by a certain percentage, by what percentage does the quantity demanded change?

So the coefficient is probably a ratio comparing the percentage changes. Wait, I remember that the formula for price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. But elasticity can be calculated for other things too, like income elasticity or cross elasticity.

But wait, the question is about the general coefficient of elasticity. So the formula should be general. Let me think about which options fit that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Sum of percentage changes in both variables. No, that doesn't sound right. Elasticity is a ratio, not a sum.

Option B: Percentage change in independent divided by dependent. Hmm, wait. If elasticity of demand is (ΔQ/Q)/(ΔP/P), then it's (ΔQ/ΔP)*(P/Q). So the percentage change in Q over percentage change in P. So that would be dependent variable's percentage change divided by independent's. Wait, no. Wait, no, in elasticity, dependent is quantity, independent is price. So elasticity is (ΔQ/Q)/(ΔP/P), which is (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). So that's percentage change in dependent (Q) divided by percentage change in independent (P). So that would be option F, perhaps.

Wait, let me read all the options again.

Option F: Percentage change in dependent divided by independent. That's correct for elasticity.

Option B is independent's percentage change divided by dependent's. That would be the inverse of elasticity. So if elasticity is 2, B would be 0.5. So B is the reciprocal, which isn't the elasticity coefficient itself.

So the correct answer must be F. Let me double-check the other options.

Option E is the ratio of change in dependent to independent, but that's absolute changes, not percentages. So that's different. Because elasticity uses percentages to make it unitless.

Option D is absolute changes, same issue.

Options C, G, H, I involve mixes of percentage and absolute changes, which doesn't fit because elasticity uses both percentage changes.

So the correct option is F. So the answer should be F.

The coefficient of elasticity measures the responsiveness of a dependent variable to a change in an independent variable, expressed as the ratio of their percentage changes. Specifically, it is calculated as the percentage change in the dependent variable divided by the percentage change in the independent variable. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as elasticity is a ratio, not a sum of percentage changes.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it represents the inverse of elasticity (independent variable's percentage change divided by dependent variable's percentage change).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it mixes percentage and absolute changes, which does not align with elasticity's definition.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it involves absolute changes rather than percentage changes.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as it uses absolute changes instead of percentage changes.  
- **Option F**: Correct, as it matches the definition of elasticity: the percentage change in the dependent variable divided by the percentage change in the independent variable.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it involves absolute changes rather than percentage changes.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as it mixes percentage and absolute changes.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it mixes absolute and percentage changes.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as elasticity is not the sum of changes in both variables.  

Thus, the correct answer is **F**.
