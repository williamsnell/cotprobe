Okay, so I have this problem here: Simplify the quotient [2x^0 divided by (2x)^0]. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

Wait, I remember that any number raised to the power of zero is 1. So if I have something like a^0, it's equal to 1, right? So maybe I can apply that here.

Let me break it down. The numerator is 2x^0. Since x^0 is 1, that just becomes 2 * 1, which is 2. 

Then the denominator is (2x)^0. Using the same rule, anything to the zero power is 1, so (2x)^0 is 1. 

So now the expression simplifies to 2 divided by 1. And 2 divided by 1 is just 2. 

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key here is applying the zero exponent rule correctly. Both the numerator and denominator have exponents of zero, so they each become 1. 

Wait another thing, the numerator is 2 times x^0, which is 2*1=2. The denominator is (2x)^0, which is 1. So 2/1 is 2. 

I think that's correct. So the answer should be 2. Let me look at the options. Option G is 2. So the correct answer is G.

The problem requires simplifying the quotient \(\frac{2x^0}{(2x)^0}\). 

1. Apply the zero exponent rule: Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.  
   - Numerator: \(2x^0 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\).  
   - Denominator: \((2x)^0 = 1\).  

2. Simplify the expression:  
   \[
   \frac{2x^0}{(2x)^0} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.
   \]

Thus, the simplified quotient is 2. From the given options, the correct answer is **G: 2**.

Answer: G
