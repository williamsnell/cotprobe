Question:

The ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene, while its recessive allele fails to confer this ability. If 16 percent of the students in a school cannot roll their tongues, what percentage of students are heterozygous?

A: 36 percent
B: 32 percent
C: 24 percent
D: 40 percent
E: 20 percent
F: 48 percent
G: 68 percent
H: 16 percent
I: 64 percent
J: 52 percent

Okay, so I have this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that the ability to roll the tongue is controlled by a dominant gene. So, I remember that dominant genes will express their trait even if the other allele is recessive. The recessive allele doesn't give you the ability. So, if the gene is TT or Tt, you can roll your tongue, and tt cannot.

The problem states that 16 percent of the students can't roll their tongues. Since not being able to roll is the recessive trait, that means these students have two recessive alleles, so their genotype is tt. 

I think the key here is to find out the percentage of heterozygous students. Heterozygous would mean they have one dominant and one recessive allele, so Tt.

Wait, in a population, the Hardy-Weinberg equations are used to find the genotype frequencies. The formula is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the recessive. Since the recessive phenotype (tt) is 16%, that would be q² = 0.16. So q would be the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So q is 0.4.

Then p, the dominant allele frequency, is 1 - q, which is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of heterozygous students. The heterozygous frequency is 2pq. So plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24. Multiply by two gives 0.48, which is 48%.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, 16% are tt (q²), so q is 0.4. p is 0.6. So heterozygotes are 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48, which is 48%.

Looking at the options, option F is 48 percent. So the answer should be F.

To determine the percentage of heterozygous students, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The ability to roll the tongue is dominant (T), and the inability to roll the tongue is recessive (t). 

1. **Recessive Phenotype Frequency (tt):** 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues, so \( q^2 = 0.16 \). Solving for \( q \), we get \( q = \sqrt{0.16} = 0.4 \).

2. **Dominant Allele Frequency (T):** Since \( p + q = 1 \), \( p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 \).

3. **Heterozygous Frequency (Tt):** The frequency of heterozygotes is \( 2pq \). Substituting the values, \( 2pq = 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48 \), or 48%.

Thus, the percentage of heterozygous students is **48%**, corresponding to option F.
