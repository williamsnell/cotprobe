Okay, so I need to solve this differential equation problem using Euler's Method. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The problem is an initial value problem with a second-order differential equation. The equation given is y'' + x y' + y = 0, with y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3. I'm supposed to approximate y(0.2) using Euler's Method.

Wait, Euler's Method is typically for first-order differential equations. Oh right, but I can convert a second-order equation into a system of two first-order equations. That makes sense. So I'll need to do that first.

Let me set y' as another function, say v. So let v = y'. Then, the original equation y'' = -x y' - y becomes v' = -x v - y. Now I have a system of two equations:

y' = v,
v' = -x v - y.

This system is now in terms of first-order derivatives, which I can handle with Euler's Method. Euler's Method updates the functions using their derivatives at each step. The formula is something like y_{n+1} = y_n + h * f(x_n, y_n), where h is the step size.

But wait, I need to decide on the step size. The problem doesn't specify, but since the options are given to two decimal places and the target is x=0.2, maybe they used a single step (h=0.2) or two steps (h=0.1). Let me think. If I use a single step, h=0.2, that's a larger step and might be less accurate, but perhaps it's sufficient for this problem. Alternatively, using two steps might give a better approximation. I should check if the options are close to either approach.

Alternatively, maybe the step size is 0.2, but perhaps the problem expects using a certain number of steps. Hmm. Let me see. Let's outline the steps.

Given that x starts at 0, and we need to reach x=0.2. Let's assume h is 0.2, meaning one step. Alternatively, maybe using h=0.1 (two steps). Let me try both approaches and see which one gives an answer among the options.

First, let's try with a single step (h=0.2).

At x=0, y=2, v=3 (since y'=3 at x=0).

Using Euler's method, the next values are:

y1 = y0 + h * v0
v1 = v0 + h * ( -x0 * v0 - y0 )

Plugging in the numbers:

y1 = 2 + 0.2 * 3 = 2 + 0.6 = 2.6

v1 = 3 + 0.2 * ( -0 * 3 - 2 ) = 3 + 0.2*(-2) = 3 - 0.4 = 2.6

So at x=0.2, y is approximately 2.6, but looking at the options, 2.6 isn't one. The closest is option F: 2.58 or option A: 2.67. Hmm, so maybe using a single step isn't the right approach, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the step size is 0.1, so two steps. Let's try that.

First step (h=0.1):

At x0=0, y0=2, v0=3.

Compute y1 and v1:

y1 = y0 + h*v0 = 2 + 0.1*3 = 2.3

v1 = v0 + h*(-x0 v0 - y0) = 3 + 0.1*( -0*3 -2 ) = 3 + 0.1*(-2) = 3 - 0.2 = 2.8

Now, x1 = 0.1.

Second step:

y2 = y1 + h*v1 = 2.3 + 0.1*2.8 = 2.3 + 0.28 = 2.58

v2 = v1 + h*(-x1 v1 - y1) = 2.8 + 0.1*( -0.1 * 2.8 - 2.3 )

Calculate inside the bracket first: -0.1 *2.8 = -0.28; minus 2.3 is -0.28 -2.3 = -2.58.

So v2 = 2.8 + 0.1*(-2.58) = 2.8 - 0.258 = 2.542.

Wait, but we don't need v2 for y(0.2), which is y2. So y2 is 2.58, which is option F.

Looking at the options, F is 2.58. So that's one of the choices.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

First step:

x=0, y=2, v=3.

y1 = 2 + 0.1*3 = 2.3. Correct.

v1 = 3 + 0.1*(-0 -2) = 3 - 0.2 = 2.8. Correct.

Second step:

x=0.1, y=2.3, v=2.8.

y2 = 2.3 + 0.1*2.8 = 2.3 + 0.28 = 2.58. Correct.

v2 calculation: 

- x=0.1, so -0.1*2.8 = -0.28.

Then subtract y1 which is 2.3: -0.28 -2.3 = -2.58.

Multiply by h=0.1: -0.258.

2.8 + (-0.258) = 2.542. That's correct, but since we're at x=0.2 now, we're done for y.

So the approximation is 2.58, which is option F.

Wait, but I should make sure whether Euler's method was applied correctly. Because sometimes when converting a second-order ODE to a system, you have to be careful with the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using a step size of 0.2 with two variables, but I think using two steps with h=0.1 is more accurate, and as per the options, F is present.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using h=0.2 with two variables.

Wait, in that case, it's a single step. So let me re-calculate.

Using h=0.2, at x=0, y=2, v=3.

Compute y1 = y0 + h*v0 = 2 + 0.2 *3= 2.6.

v1 = v0 + h * ( -x0*v0 - y0 ) = 3 + 0.2*(0*3 -2) = 3 + 0.2*(-2) = 3-0.4=2.6.

So y(0.2)=2.6. But 2.6 isn't an option, but option F is 2.58, option A is 2.67.

Hmm, so perhaps using two steps (h=0.1) is better, giving 2.58, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects higher accuracy, but given that the options are finite, 2.58 is an option.

So I think the correct answer is F: 2.58.

To approximate \( y(0.2) \) for the given initial-value problem \( y'' + x y' + y = 0 \) with \( y(0) = 2 \) and \( y'(0) = 3 \), we use Euler's Method. Since Euler's Method is designed for first-order differential equations, we first convert the second-order equation into a system of two first-order equations:

\[
y' = v, \quad v' = -x v - y.
\]

### Step 1: Choose the step size
The problem does not specify the step size, but since \( x = 0.2 \) is the target, we consider two cases:
1. A single step with \( h = 0.2 \).
2. Two steps with \( h = 0.1 \).

#### Case 1: Single step (\( h = 0.2 \))
Starting at \( x_0 = 0 \), \( y_0 = 2 \), and \( v_0 = 3 \):
\[
y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot v_0 = 2 + 0.2 \cdot 3 = 2.6,
\]
\[
v_1 = v_0 + h \cdot (-x_0 \cdot v_0 - y_0) = 3 + 0.2 \cdot (-0 \cdot 3 - 2) = 3 - 0.4 = 2.6.
\]
Thus, \( y(0.2) \approx 2.6 \). However, 2.6 is not one of the options, so this approach may not be accurate enough.

#### Case 2: Two steps (\( h = 0.1 \))
First step (\( x_0 = 0 \), \( y_0 = 2 \), \( v_0 = 3 \)):
\[
y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot v_0 = 2 + 0.1 \cdot 3 = 2.3,
\]
\[
v_1 = v_0 + h \cdot (-x_0 \cdot v_0 - y_0) = 3 + 0.1 \cdot (-0 \cdot 3 - 2) = 3 - 0.2 = 2.8.
\]

Second step (\( x_1 = 0.1 \), \( y_1 = 2.3 \), \( v_1 = 2.8 \)):
\[
y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot v_1 = 2.3 + 0.1 \cdot 2.8 = 2.3 + 0.28 = 2.58,
\]
\[
v_2 = v_1 + h \cdot (-x_1 \cdot v_1 - y_1) = 2.8 + 0.1 \cdot (-0.1 \cdot 2.8 - 2.3) = 2.8 - 0.258 = 2.542.
\]

Thus, \( y(0.2) \approx 2.58 \), which matches option F.

### Conclusion
Using two steps with \( h = 0.1 \) provides an approximation of \( y(0.2) \approx 2.58 \), which is consistent with the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 2.58**
