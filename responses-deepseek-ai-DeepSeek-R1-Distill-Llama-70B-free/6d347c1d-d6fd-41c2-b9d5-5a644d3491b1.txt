Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a bungee cord. Hmm, let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the setup is that there's a bungee cord 30.0 meters long. When it's stretched by a distance x, it exerts a restoring force of kx, which I remember is Hooke's Law. So the force is proportional to the stretch, with the spring constant k.

The father-in-law has a mass of 95 kg. He's standing on a platform 45 meters above the ground. One end of the cord is tied to his ankle, and the other to the platform. The promise is that when he steps off, he'll fall a maximum distance of 41 meters before the cord stops him.

So the first thing I need to figure out is the spring constant k of the correct bungee cord. Then, when they tested the cords by pulling with a force of 380 N, I need to find out how much that specific cord stretches.

Wait, but the question is a bit tricky. Because when selecting the cord, they test it by applying a 380 N force. So that's a different scenario from the bungee jump scenario. So I need to calculate k in the context of the jump, then apply it to the test situation.

Let me break this down. In the bungee jump scenario, the key is energy conservation. The potential energy lost by the father-in-law when he falls is converted into elastic potential energy in the bungee cord.

Wait, but first, how far does he fall before the cord stops him? Oh, the maximum distance is 41.0 m. But the platform is 45 m above the ground, so the maximum he would fall is 41 m, and the ground is 45 m below. So he doesn't hit the ground, which is good.

Wait, no, wait. The question says he steps off the platform, which is 45m high. He falls, and the cord stops him after 41m. So the total fall distance is 41m. So the cord must stretch 41m minus the length of the cord itself, right? No, wait. Because the cord's unstretched length is 30m. So as he falls, the first 30 meters the cord is just going slack. Then beyond that, the cord starts stretching. So the total fall is 30m (unstretched) plus the stretch x. So when he falls 41m, the stretch x is 11m.

Wait, let me think again. The total fall distance is 41m. The cord is 30m long, so beyond 30m, it starts stretching. So the stretch x is 41 - 30 = 11 meters. So at maximum stretch, x is 11m.

So the elastic potential energy at that point is (1/2)kx². And the gravitational potential energy lost is mgh, where h is 41m, because he falls 41m.

Wait, but wait: the gravitational potential energy is m g (height loss). So the height loss is 41m, so the energy is m g (41). That energy is converted into elastic potential energy in the cord, which is (1/2)k x², where x is 11m.

So setting them equal: m g h = (1/2) k x².

So m is 95 kg, g is 9.8 m/s², h is 41 m. x is 11 m.

So plugging in the numbers:

95 * 9.8 * 41 = 0.5 * k * (11)^2.

Let me compute the left side first.

95 * 9.8 = let's see: 95 * 10 is 950, so 95*9.8 is 931. So 931 * 41.

Hmm, 931 * 40 is 37,240, and 931 more is 38,171. So left side is 38,171 Joules.

Right side: 0.5 *k*121 → (0.5 * 121)*k = 60.5 k.

So 38,171 = 60.5 k → k = 38,171 / 60.5.

Let me compute that. 60.5 times 600 is 36,300. 60.5 * 630 = let's see, 60.5*600=36,300, 60.5*30=1,815 → total 38,115. Hmm, close to 38,171.

So 630 gives 38,115. The difference is 38,171-38,115 = 56.

So 56 /60.5 ≈ 0.926. So k ≈ 630.926. Let's say approximately 631 N/m.

Wait, but let's compute it exactly.

38,171 divided by 60.5.

60.5 × 631 = ?

60 × 631 = 37,860

0.5 ×631= 315.5 → total 38,175.5.

Wait, but 38,175.5 is a bit higher than 38,171. So 631 gives 38,175.5, which is 4.5 more than needed.

So perhaps k is approximately 630.926, let's say 630.93 N/m.

Wait, but maybe I should carry exact calculation for better precision.

Wait, 38,171 ÷ 60.5.

Let me compute 38,171 ÷ 60.5.

Let me write it as 38171 ÷ 60.5 = ?

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate decimal: 76242 ÷ 121.

Wait, 121 × 630 = 76,230.

76242 -76,230 = 12.

So 630 and 12/121 → 630 + 0.0991 → ≈630.099 N/m.

Wait, that's conflicting with previous calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation.

Wait, mgh is 95 *9.8 *41.

Wait, 95 *9.8 = 931. Yes. 931 *41.

Let me compute 41 * 900 = 36,900. 41 *31 = 1,271. So 36,900 +1,271 = 38,171. Correct.

So 38,171 = (1/2) k (11)^2.

So 11^2 is 121. So (1/2)*121=60.5.

So k = 38,171 /60.5.

Let me compute 38,171 divided by 60.5.

60.5 × 630 = 60*630 + 0.5*630 → 37,800 + 315 = 38,115.

38,171 -38,115 = 56.

So 56 /60.5 = 56 ÷60.5. Let me compute that.

60.5 = 121/2.

So 56 ÷ (121/2) ) = (56 *2)/121 = 112 /121 ≈ 0.9252.

So k = 630 + 0.9252 ≈ 630.925 N/m.

So approximately 630.925 N/m.

Now, the next part is that when they test the cord by pulling with a force of 380 N, what's the stretch (x)?

In this test, the cord is being pulled with force F = 380 N. According to Hooke's Law, F = kx.

So x = F /k.

F is 380 N, and k is approximately 630.925 N/m.

So x = 380 /630.925.

Let me compute that.

380 ÷630.925 ≈ Let's approximate.

630.925 is about 631.

380 /631 ≈ 0.602 m, which is 60.2 cm.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.602 m. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the energy equation: mgh = ½ kx².

Yes, because when the jumper falls h meters, the PE lost is mgh, which equals the elastic PE in the cord when stretched x meters.

Wait, but wait: the total fall is 41m, but the cord's length is 30m. So the stretch beyond the cord's length is 11m, which is x. So x=11m.

So that's correct.

Then, solving for k: yes, 38,171 = 0.5 *k *121 → k=38,171/(60.5) ≈630.925.

Testing with F=380 N: x=380/630.925≈0.602 m.

So the correct option is B:0.602 m.

To solve the problem, we first determine the spring constant \( k \) of the bungee cord using the energy conservation principle. The gravitational potential energy lost by the father-in-law as he falls is converted into elastic potential energy in the cord. The total fall distance is 41.0 m, but the cord itself is 30.0 m long, so the stretch \( x \) at maximum extension is:

\[
x = 41.0 - 30.0 = 11.0 \, \text{m}.
\]

The gravitational potential energy lost is:

\[
PE_{\text{gravity}} = m g h,
\]

where \( m = 95.0 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( h = 41.0 \, \text{m} \). Substituting:

\[
PE_{\text{gravity}} = 95.0 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 41.0 = 38,171 \, \text{J}.
\]

The elastic potential energy stored in the cord is:

\[
PE_{\text{elastic}} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
\]

Equating the two energies:

\[
38,171 = \frac{1}{2} k (11.0)^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
38,171 = 0.5 \cdot k \cdot 121,
\]

\[
k = \frac{38,171}{60.5} \approx 630.93 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

Next, we calculate the stretch \( x \) of the cord when a force \( F = 380.0 \, \text{N} \) is applied during testing. Using Hooke's Law:

\[
F = k x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{F}{k}.
\]

Substituting \( F = 380.0 \, \text{N} \) and \( k = 630.93 \, \text{N/m} \):

\[
x = \frac{380.0}{630.93} \approx 0.602 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the bungee cord stretches approximately \( 0.602 \, \text{m} \) when a force of \( 380.0 \, \text{N} \) is applied. The correct answer is:

**B: 0.602**
