Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve about the Lyman series. Hmm, I remember that the Lyman series is part of the hydrogen spectrum, right? It's one of those series of spectral lines that result from electron transitions in a hydrogen atom. Oh wait, the Lyman series specifically involves transitions to the n=1 energy level. So electrons falling to the first energy level from higher ones, which gives off photons in the ultraviolet range.

The question is asking about the series limit of the Lyman series. Oh right, the series limit is the shortest wavelength (or the highest energy) photon in the series because it corresponds to the transition where the electron starts at infinity, meaning it's ionized. So when the electron is at infinity, it's at the ionization energy, which is the highest point for the series.

Wait, the series limit is the case when the electron is moving from n=infinity to n=1. So I need to calculate the wavelength (or energy) of that photon.

I think the formula for the wavelengths in the Lyman series is given by the Balmer formula, but adjusted for the Lyman series. Oh wait, the general formula for the hydrogen spectrum is 1/λ = R * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant. And for the Lyman series, n₁ is 1 since that's the lower energy level.

So for the series limit, n₂ would approach infinity. Let me plug that into the equation. So 1/λ = R * (1/1² - 1/∞²). Oh wait, 1/∞ is zero. So 1/λ = R * (1 - 0) = R.

Wait, so 1/λ equals R. Therefore, λ equals 1/R. Oh right, the Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m⁻¹. Let me make sure I remember the value correctly. Yeah, I think R is about 1.097373 x 10^7 per meter. Wait wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Oh wait, sometimes it's written in terms of reciprocal meters, so R = 1.097e7 m⁻¹ (1.097 x 10^7 per meter) or sometimes as 0.911e-7 meters when inverted for wavelength.

Wait no, let's get this straight. The Rydberg constant is about 1.097e7 m⁻¹. So 1.097373e7 m⁻¹, to be precise. So if 1/λ = R, then λ = 1/R.

So let me compute that. R is 1.097373e7 m⁻¹, so 1/R is approximately 9.1177e-8 meters. Wait, converting that to nanometers because the options are in nm. So 1e-9 meters is 1 nm, so 9.1177e-8 m is 91.177 nm. Oh wait, so approximately 91.17 nm.

Looking at the options, option A is 91.17 nm. So that's the wavelength. But wait, the question also asks about the energy. Oh wait, but the question says to calculate both the wavelength and the energy. But the options are given as different wavelengths. Wait, but the question provides multiple-choice options, and I have to choose the correct one. Oh, wait, the question says, 'calculate the wavelength and the energy of a photon associated with the series limit of the Lyman series.' But the options are all wavelengths, so perhaps the correct answer is the wavelength, but wait, maybe I should also compute the energy.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is about the series limit, which is the shortest wavelength (highest energy) in the series. So I found the wavelength is approximately 91.17 nm, which matches option A.

Alternatively, if I wanted to compute the energy, I could use E = hc/λ. But the options don't have energies, they have wavelengths, so probably the correct answer is A: 91.17 nm.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, I thought the Lyman series limit was at about 91 nm. Let me check my notes. Oh yes, the Lyman series' limit is indeed around 91.2 nm, which is in the ultraviolet range. So yes, option A is correct.

The Lyman series corresponds to transitions in a hydrogen atom where the electron falls to the n=1 energy level. The series limit represents the shortest wavelength (or highest energy) photon in the series, which occurs when the electron transitions from n=∞ (ionization) to n=1. The wavelength associated with the series limit can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
\]

For the Lyman series, \( n_1 = 1 \), and \( n_2 \to \infty \). Substituting these values, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - 0 \right) = R
\]

Thus, \( \lambda = \frac{1}{R} \). The Rydberg constant \( R \) is approximately \( 1.097373 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \). Calculating \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{1.097373 \times 10^7} \approx 9.1177 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} = 91.17 \, \text{nm}
\]

This matches option A. The series limit corresponds to the shortest wavelength in the Lyman series, which is approximately 91.17 nm. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 91.17 nm**
