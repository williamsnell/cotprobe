Okay, so I have this problem about estimating the dissociation energy (De) for NaCl using a simple model where NaCl is treated as a pair of spherical ions in contact. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the dissociation energy is related to the energy changes when the ionic bond forms. So, the process involves a few main steps: ionization of sodium, electron affinity of chlorine, and the electrostatic attraction between the ions.

Wait, the given data is:
- Equilibrium distance (Re) = 2.36 Å, which I should convert to meters because the units in the formula will probably be in SI.
- Ionization energy of Na is 5.14 eV.
- Electron affinity of Cl is 3.61 eV.
- One debye is 3.33564e-30 C·m, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. Maybe that's for calculating something else, like dipole moments, which might not be relevant for this particular problem.

I think the main formula here is the Born-Lande equation or something similar to calculate the lattice energy, which can be related to the dissociation energy. The Born-Haber cycle might come into play here.

Wait, Born-Lande equation is for lattice energy, which is the energy released when ions come together to form a crystal lattice. But the question is about NaCl as a pair of ions in contact, so maybe it's a simpler version.

The general approach is: the dissociation energy De is the energy required to break the ionic bond into ions in gas phase. So, to form the ionic bond, energy is released, so the bond dissociation energy would be the energy that must be overcome.

But let me think in terms of energy changes. The formation of NaCl from Na and Cl atoms would involve several steps:

1. Ionization of Na: Na(g) → Na⁺(g) + e⁻, which requires energy (the ionization energy, 5.14 eV).
2. Electron affinity of Cl: Cl(g) + e⁻ → Cl⁻(g), which releases energy (3.61 eV).
3. Coulombic attraction between Na⁺ and Cl⁻ leading to bond formation.

Wait, but when calculating the lattice energy, you also consider the Born exponent and other factors, but maybe here it's simplified. Since it's a pair of ions, maybe we're using the Coulomb potential energy between two point charges.

The Coulomb potential energy (U) between two ions is given by U = (k * e²) / r_e * (1/(4πε0)), but another way to write this is U = (e² / (4πε0 r_e)) * (1/(1 - 1/n)), but I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps it's just U = (k * |q1 * q2|) / r_e.

Wait, let me clarify. For two ions with charges +1 and -1, the Coulomb energy is U = (k_e * e²) / r_e, where k_e is Coulomb's constant.

But I also remember that the energy in eV can be calculated with a specific formula. Oh right, the conversion is such that (e²)/(4πε0 r_e) in eV when r_e is in Ångströms can be calculated as 14.4 eV·Å / r_e (in Å).

Wait, let me compute that. Because 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So the Coulomb energy U is (e²)/(4πε0 r_e) in joules, then converted to eV.

The formula I remember is that at r_e in Å, the Coulomb energy is (14.4 eV·Å) / r_e. So for r_e = 2.36 Å, U would be 14.4 / 2.36 ≈ let's calculate that.

14.4 divided by 2.36. Let me compute that: 2.36 * 6 = 14.16, so 6 would give 14.16, so 6.1 would be 2.36 *6.1= 14.4, exactly. So U = 6.1 eV? Wait, but wait, that's per ion pair?

Wait, but in this problem, are we considering the Madelung constant? Because in a crystal lattice, each ion is surrounded by multiple ions of opposite charge, so the Madelung constant (M) is used. For NaCl structure, M is approximately 1.7476. But in this question, the model is a pair of ions in contact, so maybe M is 1, because it's just two ions. So perhaps the Coulomb energy is just (e²)/(4πε0 r_e) * (1) * (1 - 1/n), but wait, what's n here?

Wait, I think I might be mixing up concepts. The Born-Lande equation is U = (k N_A M e²)/(r_0) * (1 - 1/n), where n is the Born exponent. But in this problem, since it's a simple pair, perhaps M is 1, and n is taken as some value, but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Wait, the question says to use a simple model of NaCl as a pair of spherical ions in contact. So perhaps it's just considering the Coulomb attraction between Na+ and Cl- ions separated by Re.

So, the Coulomb potential energy would be U = (e²)/(4πε0 Re) * (1/(1 - (1/n)) ). Wait, no, I think that's when considering the repulsion term as well in the Born model. But perhaps for this simple model, we're only considering the Coulomb attraction.

Wait, but the Coulomb energy for two opposite charges would be negative. So U = - (e²) / (4πε0 Re). But the formula I mentioned earlier gives U in eV when r is in Å. So using that approximation, U = -14.4 eV·Å / Re.

So Re is 2.36 Å, so U is about -14.4 / 2.36 ≈ -6.1 eV. So the Coulomb energy is about -6.1 eV.

But wait, the total energy change when forming the ionic bond would be the sum of the ionization energy, the electron affinity, and the Coulomb energy.

Wait no, because ionization is energy cost (positive), electron affinity is energy release (negative), and Coulomb is energy release (negative), so the total energy would be:

ΔE = Ionization energy (Na) - Electron affinity (Cl) + Coulomb energy.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the signs. Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from Na, so it's a positive value. Electron affinity is the energy released when Cl gains an electron, so it's a negative value (exothermic). Coulomb energy is the energy released when the ions come together, which is a negative value.

Wait, but when calculating the bond energy, you have to consider all the steps involved. So the process is:

1. Na(g) → Na⁺(g) + e⁻ : requires energy, +5.14 eV.
2. Cl(g) + e⁻ → Cl⁻(g) : releases energy, -3.61 eV.
3. Na⁺(g) + Cl⁻(g) → NaCl(g) : releases energy, which is the Coulomb energy U, which is negative.

But wait, the Coulomb energy is the potential energy of the ions when they're at Re. So the total energy change is the sum of these steps.

So the total energy change would be:

ΔE = (Ionization energy) + (Electron affinity) + (Coulomb energy)

Wait, no, because ionization is energy input, electron affinity is energy released (so negative), and Coulomb energy is the energy released as the ions come together (so negative).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the overall process:

Na(g) + Cl(g) → NaCl(g)

The energy change for this process is:

ΔE = Ionization energy (Na) - Electron affinity (Cl) + Coulomb energy (U)

Wait, because ionization is energy you put in (positive), electron affinity is energy you get out (so negative), and then the Coulomb attraction is energy you get out (so negative). So the formula would be:

ΔE = (5.14 eV) - (3.61 eV) + U

But wait, U is negative, as it's the energy released when the ions come together. So substituting U as a negative value, ΔE would be 5.14 -3.61 + (-6.1) = 5.14 -3.61 is 1.53, plus (-6.1) gives -4.57 eV.

Wait, but dissociation energy (De) is the energy required to break the bond into neutral atoms, so it's the opposite. So if the formation of NaCl releases energy, the bond strength would be the amount of energy holding them together. So De would be the absolute value of the energy released in forming the bond.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The process is Na + Cl → NaCl. The energy change for this is the sum of ionization energy (positive), electron affinity (negative), and the Coulomb energy (negative). So the total energy is 5.14 -3.61 + (-6.1) = (5.14 -3.61)=1.53; 1.53 -6.1= -4.57 eV. So the formation of NaCl releases 4.57 eV. Therefore, the bond dissociation energy De is 4.57 eV, which would be the energy required to break the bond back into Na and Cl.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm including all the correct terms. Alternatively, the dissociation energy De is the depth of the potential well, which would be the Coulomb energy plus any other energies involved.

Wait another approach: the Coulomb energy is the main term, but when you form the ionic bond, you have to consider the energy cost of ionization and the energy gained from electron affinity and Coulomb attraction.

So the total energy change when forming the ionic bond is:

ΔE = (Ionization energy of Na) - (Electron affinity of Cl) + (Coulomb energy between Na+ and Cl-)

So plugging in numbers: 5.14 eV (cost) - 3.61 eV (gain) + (-6.1 eV) (gain).

So it's 5.14 -3.61 = 1.53; then 1.53 -6.1 = -4.57 eV.

So the bond formation releases 4.57 eV. Therefore, the dissociation energy would be +4.57 eV, meaning you need to put in 4.57 eV to break the bond.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.56 eV, which is very close to this value. So probably, the correct answer is D.

But wait, is there any other consideration, like the Born exponent? Because sometimes the lattice energy includes a term for the repulsion at small distances, but in this case, since it's a simple model of two ions in contact, maybe that's neglected. So perhaps my initial approach is correct.

So I think the correct answer is D: 4.56 eV.

To estimate the dissociation energy \( D_e \) for NaCl using the simple model of NaCl as a pair of spherical ions in contact, we consider the energy changes involved in the formation of the ionic bond:

1. **Ionization of Na**: \( \text{Na(g)} \to \text{Na}^+(g) + e^- \), which requires energy equal to the ionization energy of Na: \( 5.14 \, \text{eV} \).
2. **Electron affinity of Cl**: \( \text{Cl(g)} + e^- \to \text{Cl}^-(g) \), which releases energy equal to the electron affinity of Cl: \( -3.61 \, \text{eV} \).
3. **Coulomb attraction**: The energy released when the Na\(^+\) and Cl\(^-\) ions come together to form the bond. This is given by the Coulomb potential energy:

\[
U = -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r_e}
\]

Using the conversion factor \( \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 14.4 \, \text{eV·Å} \), the Coulomb energy becomes:

\[
U = -\frac{14.4}{r_e} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( r_e = 2.36 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
U = -\frac{14.4}{2.36} \approx -6.1 \, \text{eV}
\]

The total energy change for the formation of the ionic bond is:

\[
\Delta E = \text{Ionization energy} - \text{Electron affinity} + \text{Coulomb energy}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = 5.14 \, \text{eV} - 3.61 \, \text{eV} - 6.1 \, \text{eV} = -4.57 \, \text{eV}
\]

The dissociation energy \( D_e \) is the energy required to break the bond, which is the absolute value of the energy released during bond formation:

\[
D_e = 4.57 \, \text{eV}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is \( 4.56 \, \text{eV} \), which corresponds to option D.
