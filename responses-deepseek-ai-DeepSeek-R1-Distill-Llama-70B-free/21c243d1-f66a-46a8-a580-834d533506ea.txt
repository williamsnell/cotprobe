Okay, so I have this question about converting the boiling point of liquid helium from Kelvin to Fahrenheit. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the boiling point is 4 degrees Kelvin. Wait, Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, right? So I need to convert that to Fahrenheit. 

I think the first step is to convert Kelvin to Celsius because I remember there's a direct relationship between Kelvin and Celsius. Oh right, the formula is Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15. So if it's 4K, subtracting 273.15 would give me the Celsius equivalent. Let me do that calculation: 4 minus 273.15 equals... that's -269.15 degrees Celsius. 

Wait, that's really cold. Now I need to convert that Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit. The formula for that, if I recall correctly, is Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32. So plugging in -269.15 for Celsius, let's compute this step by step. 

First, multiply -269.15 by 9/5. Let's see, 269.15 times 9 is... 269 *9 is like 2421, and 0.15*9 is 1.35, so total is 2422.35. Then divide by 5, so 2422.35 divided by 5 is 484.47. But since it was negative, it's -484.47. 

Then add 32 to that. So -484.47 plus 32 is... that would be -452.47 degrees Fahrenheit. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one would be option D: -452°F. Oh wait, let me double-check the options. 

Looking back, option A is -202, which is way higher. Option D is -452°F. Hmm, yes, that makes sense because liquid helium boils at a very low temperature. So I think the correct answer is D.

To convert the boiling point of liquid helium (4°K) to the Fahrenheit scale, follow these steps:

1. **Convert Kelvin to Celsius**:  
   The relationship between Kelvin and Celsius is given by:  
   \[
   °C = °K - 273.15
   \]  
   Substituting \( °K = 4 \):  
   \[
   °C = 4 - 273.15 = -269.15°C
   \]

2. **Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit**:  
   The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:  
   \[
   °F = (°C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
   \]  
   Substituting \( °C = -269.15 \):  
   \[
   °F = (-269.15 \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
   \]  
   First, calculate \( -269.15 \times \frac{9}{5} \):  
   \[
   -269.15 \times 1.8 = -484.47
   \]  
   Then add 32:  
   \[
   -484.47 + 32 = -452.47°F
   \]

3. **Match the closest option**:  
   The calculated value of \( -452.47°F \) corresponds to option **D: -452°F**.
