Okay, so I'm looking at this question about cooperative federalism, and I need to figure out which option best characterizes it. I remember that federalism in general refers to the relationship between the national government and the states, but the specific term "cooperative federalism" is a bit fuzzy in my mind. I think I need to break it down.

Cooperative federalism, from what I recall, is one of the models or types of federalism. There's dual federalism, where the federal and state governments have separate, distinct areas of authority and don't interfere with each other much. Then there's cooperative federalism, which I think involves more collaboration between the two levels. Maybe they work together on similar issues or share responsibilities.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the federal and state governments work against each other. That doesn't sound like cooperation. It sounds more like conflict, maybe dual federalism where they have separate roles but perhaps in opposition.

Option B: State and federal governments working on the same issue. That seems more in line with cooperation. They're collaborating on the same problems, like maybe sharing funding or responsibilities for a particular policy area.

Option C: States have complete authority within their borders. That's more like state sovereignty, maybe dual federalism again where states handle their own affairs without much federal involvement.

Option D: Federal government imposing policies on states without consent. That sounds like a more coercive approach, maybe what's called "commander-in-chief" federalism where the feds have more control, but it's not cooperative.

Option E: States making decisions without federal involvement. Again, that's more independent, like dual federalism, not cooperative.

Option F: Governments working with businesses. Hmm, that's a different angle. I'm not sure if that's part of cooperative federalism. Maybe it's more about public-private partnerships, but not directly about federal-state cooperation.

Option G: Federal government has complete control. That's a unitary system, not federalism at all, so probably not the answer.

Option H: Working independently on different issues. That's dual federalism again, each level handling their own separate areas without much overlap or cooperation.

Option I: Executive and legislative branches working together. That's about the branches of government, not federal-state relations, so not relevant here.

Option J: Federal government granting power to states. That sounds like devolution, where the federal government transfers authority to the states. I'm not sure if that's cooperative or just a shift in power.

So, putting it all together, cooperative federalism is about collaboration. So the best fit is option B: State and federal governments working on the same issue. They collaborate and share responsibilities, maybe through programs like Medicaid where both levels contribute.

Cooperative federalism involves collaboration between the federal and state governments, where they work together on the same issues, often sharing responsibilities and resources. This is distinct from dual federalism, where the two levels operate independently, or from more coercive models where the federal government imposes policies on states. The correct answer reflects this collaborative approach.

Answer: B
