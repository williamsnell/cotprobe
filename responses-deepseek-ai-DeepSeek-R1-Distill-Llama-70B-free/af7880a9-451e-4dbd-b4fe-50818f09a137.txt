Okay, so I've got this question here about the functions of money. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that money has several functions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions. Let's see. The question is asking which function of money best defines $1.25 as the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop.

Wait, so the options are A through J. Let me try to recall what each function means. The main functions of money are usually: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. There are a couple more sometimes, but those are the primary ones.

So the first thing I think of is unit of account. Unit of account is when money is used to measure the value of goods and services. Like, when something is priced at $1.25, that's expressing its value in terms of money. So the price tag is using dollars as a unit to account for the value of the pop bottle. That makes sense.

Medium of exchange is more about using money to actually make the transaction. So if I buy the pop, I use dollars (or a dollar bill and some coins) to pay for it. But the question is about the price being $1.25, which is more about expressing value rather than facilitating the exchange itself.

Store of value would be if I kept the money to use later, but that's not really what's happening here. The price isn't about storing value; it's about stating the value in terms of money.

Looking at the options, option C is unit of account. So I think that's the correct answer. The price is expressing the value in dollars, so it's acting as a unit of account.

Wait, but let me make sure there's not another option that fits better. Let's go through the other choices. Option B is medium of exchange. That's more about using the money to buy things, not stating their prices. So that's not it.

Option A is store of value, which is about saving money, not pricing. Option D is measure of liquidity, which I think refers to how easily an asset can be converted to cash, but that's not relevant here. Option E, measure of credit, doesn't seem right. Maybe that's about how much credit someone can get, but the price isn't about credit.

Option F, indicator of wealth, might refer to how much money someone has, but again, the price is about the value of the pop, not someone's wealth. Option G is standard for deferred payment, which I think relates to borrowing and future payments, not the price tag. Option H, mode of transfer, sounds like how money moves from one person to another, but the price isn't about the transfer method. Option I is transfer of ownership, which is more about the transaction happening, not the price. Option J, benchmark of exchange rate, that's about comparing different currencies, which isn't the case here.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's option C: Unit of account. The price uses dollars to express the value, making it the unit of account.

The function of money that best defines $1.25 as the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop is the **unit of account**. This function refers to the use of money to measure the value of goods and services. In this case, the price of $1.25 expresses the value of the pop bottle in terms of dollars, making it the unit of account.

Answer: C
