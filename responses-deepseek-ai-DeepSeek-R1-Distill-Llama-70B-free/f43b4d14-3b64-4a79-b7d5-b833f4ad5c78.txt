Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility and vapor pressure. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says that benzoic acid is nonvolatile and dissolves in ethanol to form an ideal solution. We need to calculate the solubility of the acid and the vapor pressure of the solution at 80°C. Hmm, okay. The data provided includes the molar heat of fusion and vaporization for both benzoic acid and ethanol, along with their molecular weights and melting and boiling points.

Wait, but wait. The question mentions that there's no association or dissociation of benzoic acid. So I don't have to worry about any ions or dimers forming in the solution. It's a straightforward solution of the acid in ethanol.

I'm a bit confused about what data I need to use here. The problem gives me the molar heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) and vaporization (ΔH_vap) for both substances. Oh, right, because we're dealing with a solution, maybe I should use the heat of fusion to determine the solubility. I remember that the solubility of a solid in a liquid can be calculated using the van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in solubility to temperature, but I think another approach is using the melting point and heat of fusion.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solubility can be determined using the formula that relates the mole fraction of the solute to the heat of fusion and the temperature. I think the formula is something like:

ln X = - (ΔH_fus / R) * (1/T_solution - 1/T_melt)

Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Or maybe it's the Cryoscopic equation? No, the cryoscopic equation is about freezing point depression, which is related but maybe not exactly what I need here.

Wait, another approach: the solution is ideal, so Raoult's law applies. Since benzoic acid is nonvolatile, its vapor pressure is negligible, so the vapor pressure of the solution will be determined by the ethanol only. So the total vapor pressure P_total is X_ethanol * P_pure_ethanol.

But wait, the question is giving me data at 80°C, which is the boiling point of ethanol. Oh, but ethanol's normal boiling point is 80°C. So wait, at 80°C, ethanol is boiling. Hmm, but the solution's vapor pressure would be lower than that of pure ethanol because of the presence of the solute, which is nonvolatile.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's break it down into parts. First, calculate the solubility of benzoic acid in ethanol at 80°C. Then, use that solubility to find the vapor pressure of the solution.

So for the solubility part: Benzoic acid is a solid, and ethanol is the solvent. The solubility of a solid can be calculated using the formula involving the heat of fusion. The formula I'm trying to remember is:

ln X = -(ΔH_fus / R) * (1/T - 1/T_m)

Where X is the mole fraction of the solute in solution, ΔH_fus is the heat of fusion, R is the gas constant, T is the solution temperature in Kelvin, and T_m is the melting point of the solute in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The solubility of a solid in a liquid can be approximated using the formula:

X_solute = exp( -ΔH_fus / R * (1/T - 1/T_m) )

But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether this is the right approach. Alternatively, I think the van't Hoff equation is used for solubility:

ln X = ( -ΔH_fus / R ) (1/T - 1/T_m )

Yes, that seems right. So I can use this equation to find the mole fraction of benzoic acid in ethanol at 80°C.

Let me get the numbers. The ΔH_fus for benzoic acid is 4,000 cal/mol. The molecular weight is 122, but I don't think that's needed here. The melting point (T_m) is 122°C, which I'll convert to Kelvin by adding 273.15. So T_m = 395.15 K. The solution temperature is 80°C, which is 353.15 K.

Wait, but wait a second—Benzoic acid's melting point is 122°C, and the solution is at 80°C, which is below the melting point. So if the solution is at a temperature lower than the melting point, the solid would precipitate. Hmm, but the question states that the acid dissolves in ethanol. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, maybe the solution is at 80°C, which is ethanol's boiling point, but benzoic acid's melting point is higher, so it's solid at that temperature.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if the solution is at 80°C, which is above the melting point of benzoic acid (122°C), wait no—122°C is higher than 80°C. Wait, no, 122°C is higher than 80°C. So 80°C is below the melting point of benzoic acid, which is 122°C. So at 80°C, benzoic acid is a solid. So in solution, it's a solid dissolved into ethanol. So how is that possible? Unless the ethanol acts as a solvent to dissolve some of the solid acid.

Wait, but then the solution would be a saturated solution at 80°C, meaning that the benzoic acid is at its maximum solubility. So using the van't Hoff equation makes sense here.

So let's proceed. Plugging the numbers into the equation:

ln X = -(4000 cal/mol / R) * (1/353.15 K - 1/395.15 K )

Wait, but R is the gas constant. I need to make sure the units match. The ΔH_fus is in cal/mol, and R is 1.986 cal/mol·K.

So:

ΔH_fus = 4000 cal/mol

R = 1.986 cal/mol·K

T = 353.15 K

T_m = 395.15 K

Compute 1/T - 1/T_m:

1/353.15 ≈ 0.0028315

1/395.15 ≈ 0.0025312

So their difference is 0.0028315 - 0.0025312 = 0.0003003

So:

ln X = -(4000 / 1.986) * 0.0003003

Calculate 4000 / 1.986 ≈ 2015.23

Multiply that by 0.0003003: 2015.23 * 0.0003003 ≈ 0.606

So ln X ≈ -0.606

Then X = e^(-0.606) ≈ e^(-0.606) ≈ 0.545

Wait, let me compute that. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488, since e^-0.5 is about 0.6065 and e^-0.6 is around 0.5488. So X ≈ 0.5488 mole fraction of benzoic acid.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because if the solution is at a temperature below the solute's melting point, the solubility should be lower. But in this case, 80°C is below 122°C, so the solubility should be low. Wait, but according to this calculation, the mole fraction is about 0.55. That seems high. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The van't Hoff equation in this context is used when the solution is at a temperature where the solid is just starting to dissolve. Wait, but if the solution is at 80°C, which is below the melting point of benzoic acid, the acid remains a solid, so the solution would be a saturated solution where the solid and liquid are in equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should be using is:

ln X = (ΔH_fus / R) * (1/T_m - 1/T) )

Wait, because when T is higher than T_m, the solubility increases, but when T is lower than T_m, the solution can't exist unless the solute is a solid. Hmm, maybe I messed up the sign in the equation.

Wait, let me check the van't Hoff equation for solubility. The equation I'm thinking of is:

d(ln X) / d(1/T) = -ΔH_fus / R

But integrating it would give ln X = -(ΔH_fus/R)(1/T - 1/T_m) + ln X_0

Wait, but perhaps X_0 is the solubility at the melting point. At T_m, the solubility is 1 because the solution is at the melting point, so X=1? That doesn't make sense because at the melting point, the solution is saturated, but X would be 1 only if the pure substance is molten.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me look for the correct formula. Oh wait, I think the correct equation when considering the solubility of a solid in a solvent is:

ln X = -(ΔH_fus / R) (1/T - 1/T_m)

But wait, if T is lower than T_m, then 1/T is higher than 1/T_m, so (1/T - 1/T_m) is positive. So ln X is negative, which would imply X is less than 1, which makes sense for a solid solubility.

Wait, but in our case, T is 353 K, T_m is 395 K. So 1/T is 1/353 ≈ 0.00283, and 1/T_m is 0.00253. So 1/T - 1/T_m is positive, 0.0003. Thus, ln X is negative, which would give X as a fraction.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I got X around 0.55, which is a significant mole fraction. But considering that ethanol is a good solvent for benzoic acid, maybe that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the heat of fusion as a negative value in the equation. Wait, because the process of fusing (melting) is endothermic, so ΔH_fus is positive.

Wait, let me double-check. Suppose I have a solid dissolving in a liquid solvent. At a temperature T, the solubility is X. The equation is:

ln X = -(ΔH_fus / R) (1/T - 1/T_m)

So substituting the numbers:

ln X = -(4000 / 1.986) * (1/353.15 - 1/395.15)

Compute 1/353.15 ≈ 0.002831

1/395.15 ≈ 0.002531

Difference: 0.002831 - 0.002531 = 0.0003

So:

ln X ≈ -(4000/1.986) * 0.0003 ≈ -(2015.23) * 0.0003 ≈ -0.6047

So X ≈ e^(-0.6047) ≈ 0.547, as before.

So the mole fraction of benzoic acid is approximately 0.547. That's about 0.55.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.55 mole fraction, and option J is 0.65. So 0.55 is one of the choices.

Wait, but the problem asks for the solubility of the acid and the vapor pressure of the solution. So I've calculated the mole fraction of the acid, which is the solubility in terms of mole fraction. Now, the next part is to find the vapor pressure of the solution.

Since the solution is ideal and benzoic acid is nonvolatile, the vapor pressure of the solution is just the mole fraction of ethanol times the vapor pressure of pure ethanol at 80°C. Wait, but ethanol's normal boiling point is 80°C, so at 80°C, pure ethanol's vapor pressure is 1 atm. So P_ethanol_pure = 1 atm.

The mole fraction of ethanol is 1 - X_acid. Since X_acid is approximately 0.547, so X_ethanol ≈ 1 - 0.547 = 0.453.

So the vapor pressure of the solution would be X_ethanol * P_pure_ethanol = 0.453 * 1 atm ≈ 0.453 atm.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: 0.55 mole fraction, 0.45 atm.

That matches our calculation. So the answer should be option E.

Wait, but let me confirm. Let's recalculate X_acid more accurately.

Compute ln X:

ln X = -(4000 / 1.986) * (1/353.15 - 1/395.15)

Compute 1/353.15 = approximately 0.0028315

1/395.15 ≈ 0.0025312

Difference: 0.0003003

4000 / 1.986 ≈ 2015.23

2015.23 * 0.0003003 ≈ 0.6057

So ln X ≈ -0.6057

e^-0.6057 ≈ ?

We know that e^-0.6 is about 0.5488.

e^-0.6057 is a bit less, say approximately 0.546.

So X_acid ≈ 0.546, which is approximately 0.55. So that's the mole fraction of the acid.

Then, X_ethanol = 1 - 0.546 = 0.454.

Vapor pressure of solution is 0.454 * 1 atm ≈ 0.454 atm. The options have 0.45 atm, which is close enough considering rounding.

So the correct option is E: 0.55 mole fraction, 0.45 atm.

To solve the problem, we calculate the solubility of benzoic acid in ethanol at 80°C using the van't Hoff equation for solubility:

\[
\ln X = -\frac{\Delta H_{\text{fus}}}{R} \left( \frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_m} \right)
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given data
- **ΔH_fus (benzoic acid)** = 4000 cal/mol  
- **R (gas constant)** = 1.986 cal/mol·K  
- **T (solution temperature)** = 80°C = 353.15 K  
- **T_m (melting point of benzoic acid)** = 122°C = 395.15 K  

### Step 2: Calculate the term \((\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_m})\)
\[
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{353.15} \approx 0.0028315, \quad \frac{1}{T_m} = \frac{1}{395.15} \approx 0.0025312
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_m} = 0.0028315 - 0.0025312 = 0.0003003
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(\ln X\)
\[
\ln X = -\frac{4000}{1.986} \cdot 0.0003003
\]
\[
\frac{4000}{1.986} \approx 2015.23, \quad 2015.23 \cdot 0.0003003 \approx 0.6057
\]
\[
\ln X \approx -0.6057
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \(X\) (mole fraction of benzoic acid)
\[
X = e^{-0.6057} \approx 0.546
\]

Thus, the mole fraction of benzoic acid is approximately **0.55**.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the vapor pressure of the solution
Since benzoic acid is nonvolatile, the vapor pressure of the solution is determined by ethanol alone. At 80°C, the vapor pressure of pure ethanol is 1 atm. The mole fraction of ethanol in the solution is:

\[
X_{\text{ethanol}} = 1 - X_{\text{benzoic acid}} = 1 - 0.546 = 0.454
\]

The vapor pressure of the solution is:

\[
P_{\text{solution}} = X_{\text{ethanol}} \cdot P_{\text{pure ethanol}} = 0.454 \cdot 1 = 0.454 \, \text{atm}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the vapor pressure is approximately **0.45 atm**.

---

### Final Answer
The solubility of benzoic acid is approximately **0.55 mole fraction**, and the vapor pressure of the solution is approximately **0.45 atm**. This matches **Option E**.

**E: 0.55 mole fraction, 0.45 atm**

Answer: E
