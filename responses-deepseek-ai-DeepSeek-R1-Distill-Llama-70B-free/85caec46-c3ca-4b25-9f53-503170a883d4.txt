 Select the best translation into predicate logic. Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy. (i: Italy; m: Marco; s: Spain; Mxyz: x moves to y from z)

Options:

A: ~Mis
B: Msi~
C: M~ism
D: ~Mmis
E: M~mis
F: ~Mmsi
G: M~si
H: M~msi
I: Mims~

Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is asking me to translate the sentence "Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy" into predicate logic using the given symbols. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, let me break down the sentence. The main components are "Marco," "doesn't move," "from Spain," and "to Italy." The predicate given is Mxyz, which stands for "x moves to y from z." So, the structure of the predicate is M(x, y, z), where x is the person moving, y is the destination, and z is the origin.

Now, the sentence is saying that Marco does NOT move from Spain to Italy. So in logical terms, that would be the negation of "Marco moves from Spain to Italy." 

Let me identify the variables. The problem gives i for Italy, m for Marco, and s for Spain. So, Marco is m, Italy is i, and Spain is s.

Putting that into the predicate Mxyz, moving from Spain (z=s) to Italy (y=i) would be M(m, i, s). But since Marco doesn't do this, we need to negate this statement. In predicate logic, negation is done by placing a tilde (~) before the predicate.

So the negation would be ~M(m, i, s). Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this structure. Let me look at the options again.

Option A is ~Mis. That would translate to ~M(i, s). Hmm, that doesn't include Marco, so that's probably not right.

Option B: Msi~. That doesn't look right because the tilde is at the end, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Option C: M~ism. That's not correct because the tilde is in the middle of the arguments, which isn't how predicates work.

Option D: ~Mmis. So that's ~M(m, m, i, s)? Wait, no, the predicate M only takes three arguments. Wait, mmis would be four variables, which doesn't fit. So maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check: M is a 3-place predicate, so each option should have three variables after M. Wait, looking again, each option seems to have three letters after M, possibly with a tilde.

Wait, let me clarify the notation. The predicate is Mxyz, meaning x moves to y from z. So in the formula, it's M(x,y,z). So when we negate it, it's ~M(x,y,z).

So the original statement is "Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy," which is ~M(m, i, s). So I need to find the option that represents this.

Looking at the options:

A: ~Mis → ~M(i, s) → missing Marco, so incorrect.

B: Msi~ → Not sure, but the tilde is at the end, which isn't standard notation.

C: M~ism → The tilde is in the middle of the arguments, which doesn't make sense.

D: ~Mmis → So that's ~M(m, m, i, s)? Wait, no, because M only has three variables. Wait, perhaps the option is ~M(m, i, s), but the way it's written is ~Mmis. Wait, the letters are m, i, s. So ~Mmis would be ~M(m,i,s), which matches our desired translation.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are written as strings of letters after M, possibly with a tilde. So option D is ~Mmis, which would mean ~M(m, i, s). That seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. The original statement is Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy, so the movement is from z (Spain, s) to y (Italy, i). So the predicate is M(m, i, s), and the negation is ~M(m, i, s). So the correct option should represent ~M(m, i, s). Now, looking at the options, option D is ~Mmis, which is ~M(m, i, s). So that's the correct one.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option E is M~mis. That would mean M(m, ~m, i, s), which doesn't make sense because ~m isn't a valid argument. So E is incorrect.

Option F is ~Mmsi. That would be ~M(m, s, i). Wait, that's changing the order. Because in M(x, y, z), y is the destination, and z is the origin. So if it's ~M(m, s, i), that would mean Marco doesn't move from Italy to Spain, which is the opposite of what we want. So F is incorrect.

Option G is M~si. That would be M(~s, i), but again, only two arguments and a tilde in the wrong place.

Option H is M~msi. That seems like M(~m, s, i), which would mean someone else (~m) moves from s to i, which isn't the case.

Option I is Mims~. That would have the tilde at the end, which doesn't fit.

So the correct option is D: ~Mmis, which correctly represents ~M(m, i, s), meaning Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy.

The sentence "Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy" needs to be translated into predicate logic using the given symbols. The predicate Mxyz represents "x moves to y from z," where x is the person, y is the destination, and z is the origin. The negation of "Marco moves from Spain to Italy" is required.

- **Predicate Structure**: M(m, i, s) translates to "Marco moves from Spain to Italy."
- **Negation**: The negation of this statement is ~M(m, i, s), meaning "Marco does not move from Spain to Italy."

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (~Mis)**: Represents ~M(i, s), which is incorrect because it omits Marco (m).
- **Option B (Msi~)**: Incorrect due to improper placement of the tilde.
- **Option C (M~ism)**: Incorrect because the tilde is misplaced within the arguments.
- **Option D (~Mmis)**: Correctly represents ~M(m, i, s), meaning "Marco does not move from Spain to Italy."
- **Option E (M~mis)**: Incorrect because it introduces an invalid argument (~m).
- **Option F (~Mmsi)**: Incorrect because it changes the order of arguments, implying "Marco does not move from Italy to Spain."
- **Option G (M~si)**: Incorrect due to improper placement of the tilde and missing Marco.
- **Option H (M~msi)**: Incorrect because it introduces an invalid argument (~m).
- **Option I (Mims~)**: Incorrect due to improper placement of the tilde.

The correct translation is **Option D (~Mmis)**, which accurately represents ~M(m, i, s).
