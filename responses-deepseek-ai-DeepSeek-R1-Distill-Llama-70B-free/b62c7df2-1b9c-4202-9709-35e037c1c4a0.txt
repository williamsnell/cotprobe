Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how many pairs of (a, b) can make the number 30a0b03 divisible by 13. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the number given is 30a0b03. That's an 8-digit number where a is the hundreds place, and b is the tens place of the third segment. So, the number looks like 3 0 a 0 b 0 3. Wait, no, actually, let me reconstruct it properly. The number is 30a0b03, so the digits are: 3 (crore place), 0 (ten lakh), a (lakh), 0 (ten thousand), b (thousand), 0 (hundred), 0 (ten), 3 (unit). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of place values differently. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write the number as 3 0 a 0 b 0 3, but that doesn't seem right because the positions are 8 digits. Let me clarify: the number is 30a0b03, which is 8 digits. So positions are:

Digit 1: 3
Digit 2: 0
Digit 3: a
Digit 4: 0
Digit 5: b
Digit 6: 0
Digit 7: 3
Wait, no, perhaps I should index them correctly. Wait, the number is 30a0b03, so the digits are:

Position 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 (assuming right to left as positions 1 to 8, but sometimes it's written left to right). Maybe it's better to write the number as 3 0 a 0 b 0 3, but that's 7 digits. Wait, no, 30a0b03 has 8 digits. Let me list each digit with their place value.

Let me think in terms of place values, from left to right. Let's say the number is N = 3 0 a 0 b 0 3. Wait, no, 30a0b03 is 8 digits. So the digits are:

Digit 1 (crore place): 3
Digit 2 (ten lakh): 0
Digit 3 (lakh): a
Digit 4 (ten thousand): 0
Digit 5 (thousand): b
Digit 6 (hundred): 0
Digit 7 (ten): 3? Wait no, the last digit is units. So perhaps I've got the digits wrong.

Wait, maybe I should write the number as 3 0 a 0 b 0 3, but that would only be 7 digits. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, 30a0b03 is 8 digits. So the digits are:

1: 3 (crore)
2: 0 (ten lakh)
3: a (lakh)
4: 0 (ten thousand)
5: b (thousand)
6: 0 (hundred)
7: 0 (ten)
8: 3 (unit)

Wait, no, that can't be right because then the number would be 30a0b003, which is 9 digits. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me count: 3-0-a-0-b-0-3. That's 7 digits. So maybe the number is 30a0b03, which is 8 digits, so the structure is:

Digit 1: 3 (crore)
Digit 2: 0 (ten lakh)
Digit 3: a (lakh)
Digit 4: 0 (ten thousand)
Digit 5: b (thousand)
Digit 6: 0 (hundred)
Digit 7: 0 (ten)
Digit 8: 3 (unit)

Wait, that makes sense. So the number is 30a0b03, which is 8 digits, so the digits are as I listed above.

Now, the question is to find the number of (a, b) pairs where a and b are digits (0-9) such that the entire number is divisible by 13.

I remember that a number is divisible by 13 if the sum of its digits multiplied by certain weights is a multiple of 13. Alternatively, maybe there's a rule where you take the last digit, multiply by 4, subtract from the rest, and see if the result is divisible by 13. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using modular arithmetic would be more straightforward.

Yes, modular arithmetic is probably the way to go. Let me express the number as a sum of each digit multiplied by 10^k, where k is the position from the right (units place is k=0).

So the number N can be written as:

N = 3 * 10^7 + 0 * 10^6 + a * 10^5 + 0 * 10^4 + b * 10^3 + 0 * 10^2 + 0 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0

Simplify that:

N = 3*10^7 + a*10^5 + b*10^3 + 3

We need N mod 13 to be 0.

So, let's compute each term modulo 13.

First, compute 10^k mod 13 for the necessary exponents.

Compute 10^0 mod13 = 1
10^1 mod13 = 10
10^2 mod13 = (10^1 *10) mod13 = (10*10)=100 mod13. 13*7=91, so 100-91=9. So 10^2 mod13=9.
10^3 mod13 = (10^2 *10) mod13 = 9*10=90 mod13. 13*6=78, 90-78=12. So 10^3 mod13=12.
10^4 mod13 = (10^3 *10) mod13=12*10=120 mod13. 13*9=117, 120-117=3. So 10^4 mod13=3.
10^5 mod13 = (10^4 *10) mod13=3*10=30 mod13. 30-26=4. So 10^5 mod13=4.
10^6 mod13 = (10^5 *10) mod13=4*10=40 mod13. 13*3=39, so 1. 10^6 mod13=1.
10^7 mod13 = (10^6 *10) mod13=1*10=10 mod13=10.

So now, substituting back into N mod13:

N mod13 = [3 * (10^7 mod13)] + [a * (10^5 mod13)] + [b*(10^3 mod13)] + 3*(10^0 mod13) mod13.

Which becomes:

= [3 *10] + [a *4] + [b *12] + [3*1] mod13.

Compute each term:

3*10 =30 → 30 mod13 is 30-26=4.
a*4 remains as 4a.
b*12 remains as 12b.
3*1=3.

So adding all together:

4 + 4a +12b +3 = (4+3) +4a +12b =7 +4a +12b.

So N mod13 is (7 +4a +12b) mod13. For N to be divisible by 13, this must be 0 mod13.

So the equation is:

4a +12b +7 ≡ 0 mod13.

We can simplify this equation.

First, note that 12 mod13 is -1. So 12b ≡ (-1)b mod13.

Similarly, 4a remains as is.

So the equation becomes:

4a - b +7 ≡ 0 mod13.

We can rearrange this as:

4a - b ≡ -7 mod13.

But -7 mod13 is the same as 6 mod13 (because 13-7=6). So:

4a - b ≡6 mod13.

Alternatively, we can write this as:

4a - b =6 +13k, where k is an integer.

But since a and b are digits between 0 and 9, we can find all possible (a, b) pairs that satisfy 4a - b ≡6 mod13, with 0 ≤a, b ≤9.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the equation as 4a ≡ b +6 mod13.

So for each a (0-9), we can compute 4a mod13, then find possible b values such that b ≡ (4a -6) mod13.

But b must be between 0 and9, so let's compute for each a from 0 to9:

Compute 4a mod13, subtract6, then mod13, and see what b would be.

Alternatively, since 4a can be from 0 to 36 (since a is 0-9, 4*9=36), but mod13:

4a mod13 for a 0-9:

a | 4a | mod13
0 | 0  | 0
1 |4   |4
2 |8   |8
3 |12  |12
4 |16  |16-13=3
5 |20  |20-13=7
6 |24  |24-13*1=11
7 |28  |28-13*2=2
8 |32  |32-13*2=6
9 |36  |36-13*2=10

So 4a mod13 for a=0 to9 gives: [0,4,8,12,3,7,11,2,6,10].

Now, for each a, 4a ≡ (b +6) mod13.

Which can be rewritten as b ≡ (4a -6) mod13.

But since b must be between 0 and9, let's compute (4a -6) mod13, and see if the result is between 0-9. If it is, then b can take that value. If not, then we subtract 13 to see if it falls into 0-9.

Let me make a table:

For each a from 0 to9:

Compute (4a mod13 -6) mod13, then adjust to 0-12, then see if the result is between 0-9. If yes, then b can be that value. If not, then perhaps no solution for that a.

Wait, alternatively, since (4a -6) mod13 must equal b, and b is 0-9, so for each a, compute (4a -6) mod13, and check if the result is in 0-9. If yes, then that's a possible b for that a. If not, then no.

Let me calculate this step by step for each a.

a=0:

4a=0 → 0-6= -6 mod13. -6 mod13=7 (since 13-6=7). So b=7. So (0,7) is a valid pair.

a=1:

4a=4 → 4-6= -2 mod13=11. So b=11, which is more than9. So no solution for a=1.

a=2:

4a=8 →8-6=2 mod13. So b=2. So pair (2,2).

a=3:

4a=12 →12-6=6 mod13. So b=6. So (3,6).

a=4:

4a=3 (since 16 mod13=3) →3-6=-3 mod13=10. So b=10, which is more than9. No solution.

a=5:

4a=7 →7-6=1 →b=1. So (5,1).

a=6:

4a=11 →11-6=5 →b=5. So (6,5).

a=7:

4a=2 →2-6= -4 mod13=9. So b=9. So (7,9).

a=8:

4a=6 →6-6=0 →b=0. So (8,0).

a=9:

4a=10 →10-6=4 →b=4. So (9,4).

Now, let's count how many valid (a, b) pairs we have.

a=0 →b=7 → valid.
a=1 →b=11 → invalid.
a=2 →b=2 → valid.
a=3 →b=6 → valid.
a=4 →b=10 → invalid.
a=5 →b=1 → valid.
a=6 →b=5 → valid.
a=7 →b=9 → valid.
a=8 →b=0 → valid.
a=9 →b=4 → valid.

So the valid pairs are:

(0,7), (2,2), (3,6), (5,1), (6,5), (7,9), (8,0), (9,4).

That's 8 pairs total.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation for a=7?

Wait, for a=7, 4a=28 mod13 is 28-2*13=2. So 2-6= -4 mod13=9. So yes, b=9, which is valid.

And for a=8, 4a=32 mod13=6. 6-6=0 →b=0, which is valid.

So that's 8 pairs. So the correct answer is 8, which is option B.

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, for a=0, b=7 → valid.

a=1: 4-6= -2 →11 →invalid.

a=2: 8-6=2 → valid.

a=3:12-6=6 → valid.

a=4:3-6=-3 →10 →invalid.

a=5:7-6=1 → valid.

a=6:11-6=5 → valid.

a=7:2-6=-4 →9 →valid.

a=8:6-6=0 → valid.

a=9:10-6=4 → valid.

Yes, that's 8 pairs. So the answer should be 8, which is option B.
</think>

To determine how many pairs of (a, b) can make the number \(30a0b03\) divisible by 13, we analyze the number using modular arithmetic. The number can be expressed as:

\[
N = 3 \cdot 10^7 + 0 \cdot 10^6 + a \cdot 10^5 + 0 \cdot 10^4 + b \cdot 10^3 + 0 \cdot 10^2 + 0 \cdot 10^1 + 3 \cdot 10^0
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = 3 \cdot 10^7 + a \cdot 10^5 + b \cdot 10^3 + 3
\]

We compute each term modulo 13. Using \(10^k \mod 13\):

\[
\begin{align*}
10^0 &\equiv 1 \mod 13, \\
10^1 &\equiv 10 \mod 13, \\
10^2 &\equiv 9 \mod 13, \\
10^3 &\equiv 12 \mod 13, \\
10^4 &\equiv 3 \mod 13, \\
10^5 &\equiv 4 \mod 13, \\
10^6 &\equiv 1 \mod 13, \\
10^7 &\equiv 10 \mod 13.
\end{align*}
\]

Substituting back:

\[
N \mod 13 = [3 \cdot 10] + [a \cdot 4] + [b \cdot 12] + [3 \cdot 1] \mod 13
\]

Simplify:

\[
N \mod 13 = 30 + 4a + 12b + 3 \mod 13
\]

\[
N \mod 13 = 33 + 4a + 12b \mod 13
\]

Since \(33 \mod 13 = 7\), we have:

\[
N \mod 13 = 7 + 4a + 12b \mod 13
\]

For \(N\) to be divisible by 13, \(N \mod 13 = 0\). Thus:

\[
7 + 4a + 12b \equiv 0 \mod 13
\]

Simplify further by noting \(12 \equiv -1 \mod 13\):

\[
7 + 4a - b \equiv 0 \mod 13
\]

Rearranging:

\[
4a - b \equiv -7 \mod 13
\]

Since \(-7 \equiv 6 \mod 13\), we have:

\[
4a - b \equiv 6 \mod 13
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
b \equiv 4a - 6 \mod 13
\]

For \(a, b \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, 9\}\), we compute \(b\) for each \(a\):

1. \(a = 0\): \(b \equiv 4(0) - 6 = -6 \equiv 7 \mod 13\). Valid pair: \((0, 7)\).
2. \(a = 1\): \(b \equiv 4(1) - 6 = -2 \equiv 11 \mod 13\). Invalid, as \(b > 9\).
3. \(a = 2\): \(b \equiv 4(2) - 6 = 2 \mod 13\). Valid pair: \((2, 2)\).
4. \(a = 3\): \(b \equiv 4(3) - 6 = 6 \mod 13\). Valid pair: \((3, 6)\).
5. \(a = 4\): \(b \equiv 4(4) - 6 = 10 \mod 13\). Invalid, as \(b > 9\).
6. \(a = 5\): \(b \equiv 4(5) - 6 = 14 - 6 = 8 \equiv 1 \mod 13\). Valid pair: \((5, 1)\).
7. \(a
