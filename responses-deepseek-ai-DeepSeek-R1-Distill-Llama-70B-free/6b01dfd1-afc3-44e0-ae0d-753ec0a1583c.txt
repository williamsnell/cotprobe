Question:

An accounting professor has been called as a defense expert witness in a white-collar criminal case. He testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated that the defendant had not committed any type of fraud. On cross-examination of the professor, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he was familiar with a particular treatise. The professor responded affirmatively. The attorney then asked him if the treatise was accepted as authoritative and if he was aware of the conclusions regarding the ability of accountants to detect fraud. The professor responded in the affirmative. The prosecutor now attempts to read the following section of the treatise into evidence: "It is virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence, or lack thereof, of fraud in the majority of white-collar crime cases, given the sophistication of defendants and the variety of accounting methods available. "On objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge will

Options:

A: sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.
B: sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C: overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise.
D: sustain the objection, because the prosecutor's question is leading.
E: sustain the objection, because the treatise is not relevant to the professor's testimony.
F: overrule the objection, because the treatise is considered a reliable source in the field of accounting.
G: overrule the objection, because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority.
H: overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.
I: sustain the objection, because the treatise's statements are opinion-based.
J: overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with expert witnesses and treatises. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is a criminal case where an accounting professor is testifying as a defense expert. He says the accounting records show the defendant didn't commit fraud. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks him about a particular treatise. The professor says he's familiar with it and that it's authoritative. Then the prosecutor wants to read a section from the treatise into evidence. The defense objects, and the judge has to decide.

I remember that when expert witnesses testify, their opinions can be based on various things, including treatises. But I think there are rules about how treatises can be used during cross-examination. Oh right, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 803(18), which deals with learned treatises. 

So Rule 803(18) says that statements in a treatise can be used if they're called to attention of the expert witness on cross-examination and they're established as reliable. The key here is that the treatise is a reliable authority, and the expert recognizes it as such.

In this case, the professor confirmed that the treatise is authoritative. So the prosecutor is trying to use the treatise to contradict the professor's testimony. That makes sense because the treatise says it's virtually impossible to state with certainty the existence or lack of fraud, which directly opposes the professor's conclusion.

Wait, but the objection is from the defendant's attorney. So the defense is objecting, probably arguing hearsay. But the treatise falls under the hearsay exception for learned treatises, right? Because it's a reliable source, and the expert has acknowledged its authority.

Looking at the options, option G says the judge will overrule the objection because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority. That fits because the treatise is admissible under the exception once the expert has recognized it.

Another option is J, which says only the contradictory parts can be read. But I think once the treatise is established as authoritative, the relevant section can be used. So the prosecutor can read that section into evidence to impeach the professor's testimony.

Wait, but what about the other options? Option B says it's hearsay without exception. But since it's a learned treatise used on cross, it's an exception. So B is incorrect.

Option A says it's sustained because the professor didn't rely on it. But the rule doesn't require the expert to have relied on it in their testimony, just that the treatise is authoritative and the section is relevant.

So the correct answer should be G. The objection is overruled because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority, making the statement admissible under the learned treatise exception.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a treatise during cross-examination of an expert witness in a criminal case. The professor, testifying for the defense, stated that accounting records conclusively showed no fraud. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked about a treatise the professor acknowledged as authoritative. The prosecutor sought to read a section of the treatise contradicting the professor's testimony, prompting a defense objection.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(18), learned treatises are admissible as an exception to hearsay if they are recognized as authoritative by the expert witness. Here, the professor confirmed the treatise's authority, satisfying the rule's requirements. The treatise's relevant section could therefore be used to impeach the professor's testimony.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G**: Correct. The treatise is admissible because the professor confirmed its authority, fitting the learned treatise exception.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The rule allows the relevant section to be read, not just parts of it.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The treatise qualifies under the hearsay exception for learned treatises.
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expert need not have relied on the treatise for it to be admissible.

Thus, the judge will overrule the objection, permitting the prosecutor to read the treatise section into evidence.

Answer: G
