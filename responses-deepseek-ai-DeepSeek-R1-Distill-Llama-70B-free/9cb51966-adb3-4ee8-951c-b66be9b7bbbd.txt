Okay, so I have this problem about designing a suitable key for a motor shaft. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question gives me a shaft diameter of 4 inches, and a maximum twisting moment of 45,000 lb-in. The design stresses are 24,000 psi for bearing and 9,000 psi in shear. I need to pick the right key dimensions from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that keys are used to transmit torque between the shaft and a hub. The key is usually a flat rectangular piece that fits into a keyseat in both the shaft and the hub. The torque is transmitted through both shear in the key and bearing pressure against the sides of the keyseat.

So the key has three dimensions: thickness (height), width, and length. The thickness is the height of the key, width is the side-to-side dimension, and length is along the shaft.

I think the standard approach is to consider two failure modes: shear failure of the key and bearing failure (crushing) of the key against the shaft. The key should be designed so that neither of these failures occurs under the maximum torque.

The torque applied is 45,000 lb-in. Torque (T) is related to shear stress (τ) and bearing stress (σ) in the key. Let me recall the relevant formulas.

For shear stress in the key: τ = T / (W * L), where W is the width and L is the length. Wait, no, I think the shear area is the width times the length, but since there are two shear planes (the key is cut on both sides), the area is 2 * W * L. So the shear stress would be τ = T / (2 * W * L). And we have to make sure this is less than or equal to the allowable shear stress of 9,000 psi.

For bearing stress, the bearing area is the thickness (t) times the length (L), so σ = T / (t * L). And this must be less than or equal to 24,000 psi.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The torque creates a shearing force on the key and also a bearing (compressive) force on the sides. So both these stresses need to be considered, and the key dimensions must satisfy both conditions.

So the steps would be:

1. For each option, calculate the shear stress and bearing stress.
2. Check if both stresses are below their respective allowable values.
3. The option that satisfies both is the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the minimum required dimensions and then see which option meets or exceeds those.

Let me try to compute the minimum required dimensions.

First, for shear stress:

Shear stress τ = T / (2 * W * L) ≤ 9,000 psi.

So, 45,000 / (2 * W * L) ≤ 9,000.

Simplify: 45,000 / (2 W L) ≤ 9,000.

Multiply both sides by (2 W L): 45,000 ≤ 18,000 W L.

So, W L ≥ 45,000 / 18,000 = 2.5 in².

So the product of width and length must be at least 2.5 square inches.

Next, for bearing stress:

Bearing stress σ = T / (t * L) ≤ 24,000 psi.

So, 45,000 / (t * L) ≤ 24,000.

Multiply both sides by t L: 45,000 ≤ 24,000 t L.

So, t L ≥ 45,000 / 24,000 = 1.875 in².

So the product of thickness and length must be at least 1.875 in².

Now, I need to look at each option and compute W*L and t*L to see if they meet these minimums.

But wait, the options give t, W, L for each choice. Maybe it's easier to compute for each option.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: t=7/8, W=1.5, L=3.

Compute W*L = 1.5 * 3 = 4.5 in² ≥ 2.5: yes.

t*L = (7/8)*3 = 21/8 = 2.625 in² ≥1.875: yes.

So shear condition: 45000/(2*1.5*3) =45000/(9) =5000 psi ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/( (7/8)*3 )=45000/(21/8)=45000*(8/21)= approx 45000 *0.38095= ~17143 psi ≤24000: yes.

So A is acceptable.

Option B: t=1, W=2, L=1.5.

W*L=2*1.5=3 ≥2.5: yes.

t*L=1 *1.5=1.5 <1.875: no. So bearing condition fails. So B is invalid.

Option C: t=3/4, W=1, L=2.5.

t=0.75, W=1, L=2.5.

W*L=1 *2.5=2.5 ≥2.5: yes.

t*L=0.75 *2.5=1.875 ≥1.875: exactly meets.

Shear stress:45000/(2*1*2.5)=45000/(5)=9000 psi. That's exactly the allowable. So that's acceptable.

Bearing stress:45000/(0.75 *2.5)=45000/(1.875)=24000 psi. Exactly the allowable. So option C is okay.

Option D: t=7/8, W=1.25, L=2.5.

t=0.875, W=1.25, L=2.5.

W*L=1.25 *2.5=3.125 ≥2.5: yes.

t*L=0.875*2.5=2.1875 ≥1.875: yes.

Shear stress:45000/(2*1.25*2.5)=45000/(6.25)=7200 ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/(0.875*2.5)=45000/(2.1875)=approx 20577 ≤24000: yes.

So D is acceptable.

Option E: t=1, W=1.5, L=2.

t=1, W=1.5, L=2.

W*L=1.5*2=3 ≥2.5: yes.

t*L=1*2=2 ≥1.875: yes.

Shear:45000/(2*1.5*2)=45000/(6)=7500 ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/(1*2)=22500 ≤24000: yes.

So E is acceptable.

Option F: t=0.5, W=0.75, L=3.

W*L=0.75*3=2.25 <2.5: no. So shear condition fails. Option F invalid.

Option G: t=5/8=0.625, W=1.25, L=2.

t*L=0.625 *2=1.25 <1.875: no. Bearing fails. So G invalid.

Option H: t=0.5, W=1.25, L=1.5.

t*L=0.5*1.5=0.75 <1.875: no. Bearing fails. H invalid.

Option I: t=0.5, W=1, L=2.5.

t*L=0.5*2.5=1.25 <1.875: no. Bearing fails. I invalid.

Option J: t=0.75, W=1.5, L=3.5.

t*L=0.75*3.5=2.625 ≥1.875: yes.

W*L=1.5 *3.5=5.25 ≥2.5: yes.

Shear stress:45000/(2*1.5*3.5)=45000/(10.5)=4285.7 ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/(0.75 *3.5)=45000/(2.625)=approx 17143 ≤24000: yes.

So J is acceptable.

Wait, but the question states that the key must be suitable. So among the options, which ones meet both conditions.

So options A, C, D, E, J are acceptable? But let me double-check.

Wait, the initial calculations I did for each option's shear and bearing stress.

Option C:

Shear stress is exactly 9000, and bearing stress exactly 24000. So that's acceptable.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's "design stress in bearing" and "in shear". So I think it's allowable to reach those stresses exactly, as that's the design limit.

So all the options that meet the conditions are A, C, D, E, J.

Wait, but looking back, let me check E again.

E: t=1 in, W=1.5 in, L=2 in.

t*L=2 in².

Which is more than 1.875, so that's okay.

Shear stress: 45000/(2 *1.5 *2)=45000/(6)=7500 psi ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/(1*2)=22500 ≤24000: yes.

So E is acceptable.

So which of these options is correct? The question asks to design a suitable key, so any of these would technically work, but perhaps the correct answer is the one that is the most efficient or the one calculated.

Wait, maybe I missed something. The key's dimensions should fit standard sizes, but perhaps the problem expects us to pick the one that uses the minimum material while meeting the constraints.

But the options are given, so perhaps the correct answer is not the minimum, but the right one as per the options.

Wait, but looking back, the correct approach is to calculate the minimum required dimensions and then select the option that meets or exceeds both conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the minimum required for each parameter.

But another approach is to compute the required length for each condition and see which one is the limiting factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the minimum length based on shear and bearing.

Wait, perhaps I should express the length in terms of both constraints.

From shear: W*L ≥2.5.

From bearing: t*L ≥1.875.

So for each option, I can check if both are satisfied.

But perhaps to find the minimal key, I can find the required L from both conditions and take the maximum.

Wait, for a given t and W, the required L is the maximum of (2.5/W) and (1.875/t).

Looking for an option where L is at least that.

But perhaps it's easier to just check each option.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

The question is to select the suitable key from the options, so I can compute for each option whether both the shear and bearing stresses are within limits.

So let's go again:

Option A:

Shear stress:45000/(2*1.5*3)=45000/(9)=5000 psi ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/( (7/8)*3 )=45000/(2.625)=17142.857 psi ≤24000: yes.

So A is acceptable.

Option C:

Shear:45000/(2*1*2.5)=45000/5=9000 psi == allowable.

Bearing:45000/(0.75 *2.5)=45000/(1.875)=24000 psi == allowable.

So C is acceptable.

Option D:

Shear:45000/(2*1.25*2.5)=45000/(6.25)=7200 psi ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/(0.875 *2.5)=45000/(2.1875)=20577 psi ≤24000: yes.

D is acceptable.

Option E:

Shear:7500 psi ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:22500 ≤24000: yes.

E is acceptable.

Option J:

Shear:45000/(2*1.5*3.5)=45000/(10.5)=4285.7 psi ≤9000: yes.

Bearing:45000/(0.75 *3.5)=45000/2.625=17142.857 psi ≤24000: yes.

J is acceptable.

So multiple options are acceptable. But the question is to choose one, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the key's standard proportions. Typically, the key's width is about 1/4 to 1/3 of the shaft diameter. The shaft is 4 in, so diameter is 4, so width around 1 to 1.333 inches.

Looking at the options, let's check the widths:

A: 1.5 in. That's a bit over 1/3 (1.333). Hmm, maybe possible.

C: 1 in. That's 1/4 of 4, which is acceptable.

D:1.25 in: around 1/3, acceptable.

E:1.5 in: same as A.

J:1.5 in: same.

Wait, but maybe the key thickness is usually around 1/8 to 1/4 of the diameter. So 4 in diameter: 0.5 to 1 in thickness.

Option C: 3/4 in. That's 0.75, which is within 0.5 to 1.

Option A:7/8=0.875, which is over 0.75. Hmm, but maybe acceptable.

Wait, perhaps the key thickness is usually less than or equal to half the shaft diameter's keyseat depth. Not sure, but perhaps the standards vary.

Wait, another consideration: the key should fit into the shaft's keyseat without causing stress concentrations. Also, the key's dimensions should be such that the keyseat doesn't weaken the shaft excessively.

But perhaps the problem only requires checking the stress conditions.

Wait, all options A, C, D, E, J satisfy the stress conditions. So why are they all not correct? Because the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer, I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated for some options.

Let me recheck option C:

Option C: t=3/4=0.75, W=1, L=2.5.

Shear stress: T/(2WL)=45000/(2*1*2.5)=45000/5=9000 psi. That's exactly the allowable. So acceptable.

Bearing: T/(t*L)=45000/(0.75*2.5)=45000/1.875=24000 psi. Exactly allowable.

So C is acceptable.

Option E: t=1, W=1.5, L=2.

Shear:45000/(2*1.5*2)=45000/6=7500 psi.

Bearing:45000/(1 *2)=22500 psi.

Both within limits. So E is acceptable.

But wait, perhaps the key's length is another consideration. The key length should be at least equal to the diameter, or some proportion. Wait, I don't recall that rule exactly, but perhaps it's more about the key not being too short to cause concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the key length should be at least half the shaft diameter, but 4 in shaft, so 2 in. Option C's length is 2.5, which is okay.

Hmm, but the options have varying lengths, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps there's a standard ratio between the key's dimensions. For example, the width is often about twice the thickness. Let me see.

Option C: W=1, t=0.75. So W=1.333*t. Close to 1.333, which is 4/3. Maybe acceptable.

Option E: t=1, W=1.5. So W=1.5 t. Ratio of 1.5, which is 3/2. Also acceptable.

But I'm not sure if that's a strict rule. Maybe it's just a guideline.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where both W*L and t*L are just enough, without being too large. Since multiple options meet the conditions, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, let's see the torque: 45,000 lb-in.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for key design. The key must be able to transmit the torque without exceeding the allowable stresses.

So the maximum torque that can be transmitted without exceeding shear is T_shear = τ_allowable * 2 * W * L.

Similarly, T_bearing = σ_allowable * t * L.

The actual torque is 45,000 lb-in, so both T_shear and T_bearing must be at least 45,000.

So for each option:

Compute T_shear = 9000 * 2 * W * L.

Compute T_bearing =24000 * t * L.

Both must be ≥45000.

Let me compute that for each option.

Option A:

W=1.5, L=3.

T_shear=9000*2*1.5*3=9000*9=81000 lb-in ≥45000: yes.

T_bearing=24000 * 0.875 *3=24000 *2.625=63000≥45000: yes.

So A is okay.

Option C:

W=1, L=2.5.

T_shear=9000 *2*1*2.5=9000*5=45000≥45000: yes.

T_bearing=24000 *0.75 *2.5=24000 *1.875=45000≥45000: yes.

So C meets exactly.

Option D:

W=1.25, L=2.5.

T_shear=9000 *2*1.25*2.5=9000*(6.25)=56250≥45000: yes.

T_bearing=24000*0.875*2.5=24000*(2.1875)=52500≥45000: yes.

Option E:

W=1.5, L=2.

T_shear=9000 *2*1.5*2=9000*6=54000≥45000: yes.

T_bearing=24000 *1*2=48000≥45000: yes.

Option J:

W=1.5, L=3.5.

T_shear=9000*2*1.5*3.5=9000*10.5=94500≥45000: yes.

T_bearing=24000*0.75*3.5=24000*2.625=63000≥45000: yes.

So all options A, C,
