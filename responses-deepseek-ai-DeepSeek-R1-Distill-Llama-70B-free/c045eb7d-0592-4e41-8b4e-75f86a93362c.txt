Okay, I need to figure out which combination of fiscal and monetary policies would help reduce the threat of inflation. Hmm, let's start by recalling what each policy does.

Fiscal policy involves the government's spending and taxation. If the government decreases spending, that's like taking money out of the economy, which can reduce inflation because there's less money chasing goods and services. Alternatively, increasing taxes would also reduce disposable income, which might lower demand and thus inflation.

Monetary policy is handled by the central bank. They can use tools like selling government securities, increasing the reserve ratio, or raising the discount rate. Selling securities (which is part of open market operations) would reduce the money supply because the central bank is taking money out of circulation. Increasing the reserve ratio means banks have to hold more reserves, so they lend less, reducing the money supply. Raising the discount rate makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn can increase interest rates and reduce borrowing by consumers and businesses.

So the goal is to combine a fiscal policy that reduces demand with a monetary policy that reduces the money supply. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Decrease taxes (which would put more money in people's pockets, increasing demand) and sell securities (which reduces money supply). Wait, decreasing taxes might increase inflation because people have more to spend. So maybe this isn't the best combination.

Option B: Decrease taxes again, but increase the reserve ratio. Same issue as A, the fiscal policy is expansionary, which might not help with reducing inflation.

Option C: Increase spending and buy securities. Increasing spending is definitely expansionary, which would increase demand and possibly inflation. Buying securities by the central bank increases the money supply, which might not help either.

Option D: Increase taxes and increase the discount ratio. Increasing taxes would reduce demand, which helps with inflation. Raising the discount rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing spending and investment. That seems like a good combo to reduce inflation.

Option E: Decrease spending and decrease the reserve ratio. Decreasing spending is good, but decreasing the reserve ratio means banks can lend more, increasing money supply, which could be inflationary. So this might not be the best choice.

Option F: Decrease spending and buy securities. Decreasing spending is good for reducing inflation. Buying securities increases money supply, which is counterproductive. So maybe not this one.

Option G: Decrease taxes and decrease discount ratio. Both actions seem to be expansionary. Lower taxes increase demand, and lower discount rates make borrowing cheaper. Not helpful for reducing inflation.

Option H: Increase spending and increase discount ratio. Increasing spending is bad for inflation, but higher discount rates are good. Mixed effects, but the fiscal part is making it worse.

Option I: Increase spending and sell securities. Both seem to go in opposite directions. More spending (inflationary) but selling securities (reduces money supply). Not sure if this is effective.

Option J: Increase taxes and decrease reserve ratio. Increasing taxes is good, but decreasing reserve ratio allows banks to lend more, increasing money supply, which might not help with inflation.

Wait, so the best options are D and possibly others. Let me think again.

Looking back, the correct approach is to have both fiscal and monetary policies that are contractionary. So for fiscal, either decrease spending or increase taxes. For monetary, sell securities, increase reserve ratio, or increase discount rate.

Option D has both fiscal (increase taxes) and monetary (increase discount ratio) contractionary. That should reduce demand and money supply, thus combating inflation.

Wait, another look at option F: decrease spending (fiscal contraction) and buy securities (monetary expansion). Oh wait, buying securities is when the central bank buys them, which injects money into the economy—so that's expansionary. So F's monetary policy is expansionary, which would not help. So F is bad.

Option D: Increase taxes (fiscal contraction) and increase discount ratio (monetary contraction). Both actions reduce demand and money supply, so this should be effective against inflation.

Alternatively, any other options?

Looking at option A: Decrease taxes (expansionary) and sell securities (contractionary). So mixed. Probably not as effective.

Option J: Increase taxes (good) and decrease reserve ratio (bad, expansionary). So J's monetary policy is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option D. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J. The question is to pick the combination that would lessen inflation.

Wait, another approach: the correct combination would be contractionary fiscal and contractionary monetary.

Which options have both contractionary policies?

Looking:

Option D: Increase taxes (contractionary fiscal) and increase discount ratio (contractionary monetary). So that's good.

Option E: Decrease spending (contractionary) and decrease reserve ratio (expansionary). So E's monetary is wrong.

Option J: Increase taxes (contractionary) and decrease reserve ratio (expansionary). So J is half right.

So the correct answer is D.

To reduce the threat of inflation, both fiscal and monetary policies should be contractionary. Contractionary fiscal policy involves actions like decreasing government spending or increasing taxes, which reduce demand. Contractionary monetary policy involves actions like selling government securities, increasing the reserve ratio, or raising the discount rate, which reduce the money supply and make borrowing more expensive.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Decreasing taxes (expansionary fiscal policy) and selling securities (contractionary monetary policy) is a mixed approach, as the fiscal policy would increase demand and potentially worsen inflation.
- **Option B**: Decreasing taxes (expansionary fiscal policy) and increasing the reserve ratio (contractionary monetary policy) is also mixed, as the fiscal policy would still increase demand.
- **Option C**: Increasing spending (expansionary fiscal policy) and buying securities (expansionary monetary policy) would both increase demand and money supply, worsening inflation.
- **Option D**: Increasing taxes (contractionary fiscal policy) and increasing the discount ratio (contractionary monetary policy) is a consistent combination that reduces demand and money supply, making it effective against inflation.
- **Option E**: Decreasing spending (contractionary fiscal policy) and decreasing the reserve ratio (expansionary monetary policy) is mixed, as the monetary policy would increase the money supply.
- **Option F**: Decreasing spending (contractionary fiscal policy) and buying securities (expansionary monetary policy) is also mixed, as the monetary policy would increase the money supply.
- **Option G**: Decreasing taxes (expansionary fiscal policy) and decreasing the discount ratio (expansionary monetary policy) would both increase demand and money supply, worsening inflation.
- **Option H**: Increasing spending (expansionary fiscal policy) and increasing the discount ratio (contractionary monetary policy) is mixed, as the fiscal policy would increase demand.
- **Option I**: Increasing spending (expansionary fiscal policy) and selling securities (contractionary monetary policy) is mixed, as the fiscal policy would increase demand.
- **Option J**: Increasing taxes (contractionary fiscal policy) and decreasing the reserve ratio (expansionary monetary policy) is mixed, as the monetary policy would increase the money supply.

The best combination is **Option D**, as it uses both contractionary fiscal policy (increasing taxes) and contractionary monetary policy (increasing the discount ratio) to reduce demand and money supply, effectively lessening the threat of inflation.
