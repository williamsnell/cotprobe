Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is asking which of the options will not terminate a contract by operation of law. So, termination by operation of law means that the contract ends automatically because of a specific legal reason, without any action from the parties involved.

The options are A through H, and each relates to different scenarios. I remember that contracts can be terminated in several ways, like impossibility, frustration, breach, or mutual agreement. But here, we're specifically looking at termination by operation of law.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Change in law that makes contract impossible. I think this is about impossibility. If a contract becomes impossible to perform because of a change in the law, the contract would be terminated. Like if a contract is to sell something that becomes illegal, so performance is impossible. So this would terminate the contract.

Option B: Bankruptcy of one party. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. I remember that bankruptcy affects contractual obligations. I think when a company goes bankrupt, they might be excused from performing the contract. But does it automatically terminate the contract by operation of law? Or is it more about the other party being able to terminate because of the breach or inability to perform? Maybe it's more about the bankruptcy leading to impossibility or frustration, but I'm not certain. I'll need to think about this more.

Option C: Expiration of the contract term. That makes sense. If the contract has a specific term, once it's over, the contract naturally ends. So this definitely terminates it by operation of law.

Option D: Partial performance. Wait, partial performance usually doesn't terminate the contract. If one party partially performs, the other party can still demand full performance or claim breach. But the contract isn't automatically terminated. So this might be the answer because it doesn't terminate the contract; instead, it might lead to a breach claim or allow the other party to terminate if it's a material breach. But the question is about termination by operation of law, not by a party's action. So partial performance doesn't automatically end the contract.

Option E: Supervening illegality. This is similar to option A. If after the contract is made, the law changes making it illegal, then the contract can't be enforced anymore. So it would be terminated by operation of law.

Option F: Death or insanity of a party. I think this depends on the type of contract. If the contract is personal, like requiring a specific skill of a person, then death or insanity might terminate it. But for other contracts, maybe not. But I believe in general, if a party dies, the contract is terminated, especially if their personal performance is essential. So this would be a termination by operation of law.

Option G: Fulfillment of contract. If the contract is fulfilled, then of course it's terminated because all obligations are met. So this ends the contract.

Option H: Destruction of the subject matter. Like, if the thing being sold is destroyed, the contract can't be performed. So under the doctrine of impossibility, the contract is terminated automatically.

Now, looking back at the options. The question is which one does NOT terminate the contract by operation of law.

So the answer would be the one that doesn't cause automatic termination. Let's recap:

- A: Terminate
- B: Maybe, but unsure
- C: Terminate
- D: Doesn't terminate
- E: Terminate
- F: Terminate
- G: Terminate
- H: Terminate

So D stands out because partial performance doesn't automatically end the contract. Instead, the parties might still have obligations, or the other party could choose to terminate if it's a material breach. But by operation of law, the contract isn't terminated just because of partial performance.

Wait, but could partial performance sometimes lead to termination? Like if the performance is such that the contract's purpose is frustrated. But I think partial performance doesn't automatically terminate the contract. It's more about whether the other party accepts it or sues for breach.

So the correct answer is D: Partial performance.

To determine which option will not terminate a contract by operation of law, we analyze each scenario:

- **Option A**: A change in law making the contract impossible terminates the contract by operation of law under the doctrine of impossibility.  
- **Option B**: Bankruptcy of one party may lead to termination, as it can render performance impossible or frustrate the contract.  
- **Option C**: Expiration of the contract term naturally terminates the contract by operation of law.  
- **Option D**: Partial performance does not automatically terminate the contract. It may lead to a breach claim, but the contract remains in force unless terminated by a party's action.  
- **Option E**: Supervening illegality terminates the contract by operation of law, as the contract becomes unenforceable due to a change in law.  
- **Option F**: Death or insanity of a party may terminate the contract, especially if personal performance is essential.  
- **Option G**: Fulfillment of the contract terminates it by operation of law, as all obligations are satisfied.  
- **Option H**: Destruction of the subject matter terminates the contract by operation of law under the doctrine of impossibility.  

The only option that does not terminate the contract by operation of law is **Option D: Partial performance**.
