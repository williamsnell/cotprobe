Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating pH and pOH for two different solutions: 0.0001 N HCl and 0.0001 N KOH. I remember that pH and pOH are related to the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions in a solution. 

Wait, first, I should probably clarify what N means here. Oh right, N stands for Normality, which is a measure of concentration. For strong acids and bases, like HCl and KOH, they completely ionize in water, so the normality should directly relate to the molarity in terms of ion concentration.

So for part (a), 0.0001 N HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl- ions. So the concentration of H+ ions should be equal to the normality of the HCl solution. That means [H+] = 0.0001 N. Oh wait, normality (N) is equivalent to molarity (M) for HCl because each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions. So [H+] is 0.0001 M.

Now, pH is calculated using the formula pH = -log[H+]. Let me calculate that. So [H+] is 1e-4 M. The log of 1e-4 is -4, so pH is 4. That makes sense for a strong acid; the pH should be directly related to the concentration.

Then for part (b), 0.0001 N KOH. KOH is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into K+ and OH- ions. So the concentration of OH- ions is 0.0001 M. Then pOH is calculated as pOH = -log[OH-]. So [OH-] is 1e-4, log of that is -4, so pOH is 4.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: in water at 25Â°C, pH + pOH = 14. So if the pH is 4, then pOH should be 10, right? Because 4 + 10 =14. But wait, in this case, both solutions are the same concentration, but one is an acid and the other a base.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For (a), HCl is an acid. So the pH is 4. Then for (b), KOH is a base. So the pOH would be 4? But wait, that would imply that the solution is neutral, which can't be right because KOH is a strong base and should have a high pH (basic solution).

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, pH and pOH are related by pH = 14 - pOH. So if I have a solution with pOH 4, then pH is 10, which would make sense for a basic solution.

But wait, the calculation I did for (b) gave me pOH 4. That can't be right because that would mean pH is 10, which makes the solution basic, which is correct. But wait, how does that fit with the concentration of the solution?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating pOH. Let me recalculate. If [OH-] is 0.0001 M, then pOH is -log(0.0001) which is 4. Then pH would be 14-4=10. So the pH is 10, pOH is 4. But that's for the KOH solution. 

Wait, the question for part (b) is asking for the pOH of 0.0001 N KOH. So pOH is 4, which would be correct. So for part (a), pH is 4, and for part (b), pOH is 4.

Wait, but that would mean that both have the same pOH and pH? No, no, because (a) is pH and (b) is pOH. So (a) is 4, and (b) is 4. Wait, but that would imply that for KOH, the pOH is 4, which seems low. Because KOH is a strong base, so a 0.0001 N solution should have a pOH of 4, which would make the pH 10. 

Wait, but let's double-check the calculations. For HCl, 0.0001 N: [H+] = 0.0001 M. pH = -log(0.0001) = 4. For KOH, 0.0001 N: [OH-] = 0.0001 M. pOH = -log(0.0001) =4. So in this case, the pH of HCl is 4, and the pOH of KOH is 4. 

But wait, in pure water, the product of [H+][OH-] is 1e-14. So if [H+] is 0.0001, then [OH-] is 1e-14 /1e-4 = 1e-10. So pOH would be 10. But wait, that's for the HCl solution. But that's not what the question is asking. The question is about the KOH solution.

So for the KOH solution: [OH-] is 0.0001 M, so [H+] is 1e-14 / 0.0001 = 1e-10. So pH is 10, which makes sense. So the pOH is 4, correct. So the pH of the KOH solution is 10, and the pOH is 4.

But the question only asks for (a) the pH of HCl and (b) the pOH of KOH. So (a) is pH 4, (b) is pOH 4. But looking at the options, the option that matches this would be D: pH is 4, pOH is 4. Or wait, looking at the options, option D says pH is 4, pOH is 4. But wait, that's for the same solution, which is not the case. The question is for two different solutions.

Wait, no. The options probably present two values: for part (a) and (b). So for part (a), pH is 4. For part (b), pOH is 4. So the correct option is (a) pH=4, (b) pOH=4. Looking at the options, option D is (a) pH=4, (b)pOH=4. So that should be the correct answer.

Hmm, but wait, another thought. The problem says "assuming complete ionization," which is correct for both HCl and KOH, as they're strong electrolytes. So the initial approach holds.

Let me check the options again. Option B: pH is 4, pOH is 10. That would be if for (a) pH is 4, and for (b) pOH is 10. But no, because for (b), the pOH is 4. So option D would be the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we calculate the pH and pOH for two solutions: 0.0001 N HCl and 0.0001 N KOH, assuming complete ionization.

### Part (a): pH of 0.0001 N HCl
HCl is a strong acid that dissociates completely in water, so the concentration of hydrogen ions \([H^+]\) is equal to the normality of the solution:
\[
[H^+] = 0.0001 \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+].
\]
Substituting \([H^+] = 0.0001 \, \text{M}\):
\[
\text{pH} = -\log(0.0001) = -\log(1 \times 10^{-4}) = 4.
\]

### Part (b): pOH of 0.0001 N KOH
KOH is a strong base that dissociates completely in water, so the concentration of hydroxide ions \([OH^-]\) is equal to the normality of the solution:
\[
[OH^-] = 0.0001 \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-].
\]
Substituting \([OH^-] = 0.0001 \, \text{M}\):
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(0.0001) = -\log(1 \times 10^{-4}) = 4.
\]

### Final Answer
For part (a), the pH of 0.0001 N HCl is 4. For part (b), the pOH of 0.0001 N KOH is also 4. Therefore, the correct option is:

**D: pH is 4, pOH is 4.**
