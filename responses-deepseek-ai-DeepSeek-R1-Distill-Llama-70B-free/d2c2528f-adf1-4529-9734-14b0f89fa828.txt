Okay, so I have this matrix A, which is a 3x3 matrix. The question is asking for its eigenvalues. Hmm, eigenvalues, right. I remember that eigenvalues are scalars λ such that Av = λv for some non-zero vector v. To find them, I need to solve the characteristic equation, which is det(A - λI) = 0.

Let me write down matrix A first. It's:

[3, 1, 1]
[2, 4, 2]
[1, 1, 3]

So I need to construct the matrix (A - λI). That would be subtracting λ from the diagonal elements of A. So the matrix becomes:

[3-λ, 1,     1    ]
[2,    4-λ, 2    ]
[1,    1,    3-λ ]

Now, I have to find the determinant of this matrix and set it to zero. Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tricky, but I can expand along the first row.

The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix:

|a b c|
|d e f| = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)
|g h i|

So applying that to our (A - λI) matrix:

det = (3-λ) * [(4-λ)(3-λ) - (2)(1)] - 1 * [2*(3-λ) - 2*1] + 1 * [2*1 - (4-λ)*1]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: (3-λ) * [(4-λ)(3-λ) - 2*1]
Compute (4-λ)(3-λ): 12 -4λ -3λ + λ² = λ² -7λ +12
Then subtract 2: λ² -7λ +12 -2 = λ² -7λ +10
So first term is (3-λ)(λ² -7λ +10)

Second term: -1 * [2*(3-λ) - 2*1]
Compute inside: 6 -2λ -2 = 4 -2λ
Multiply by -1: - (4 -2λ) = -4 +2λ

Third term: 1 * [2*1 - (4-λ)*1]
Compute inside: 2 -4 +λ = (λ -2)
Multiply by 1: λ -2

So putting it all together, the determinant is:

(3-λ)(λ² -7λ +10) + (-4 + 2λ) + (λ -2)

Let me expand (3-λ)(λ² -7λ +10). Multiply each term:

3*(λ²) = 3λ²
3*(-7λ) = -21λ
3*10 = 30
-λ*(λ²) = -λ³
-λ*(-7λ) = 7λ²
-λ*(10) = -10λ

So combining:

3λ² -21λ +30 -λ³ +7λ² -10λ

Combine like terms:
-λ³ + (3λ² +7λ²) + (-21λ -10λ) +30
= -λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30

Now add the other terms: (-4 +2λ) + (λ -2) = (-4 -2) + (2λ + λ) = -6 +3λ

So the determinant becomes:

(-λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30) + (-6 +3λ)
= -λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30 -6 +3λ
= -λ³ +10λ² -(31λ-3λ) + (30-6)
= -λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24 = 0

It's easier to work with positive leading coefficients, so multiply both sides by -1:

λ³ -10λ² +28λ -24 = 0

Now I need to solve this cubic equation. Let me try possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 24 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24.

Let me test λ=2:

2³ -10*(2)^2 +28*2 -24 = 8 -40 +56 -24 = (8-40)= -32; (-32+56)=24; 24-24=0 → Yes, λ=2 is a root.

So (λ-2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide λ³ -10λ² +28λ -24 by (λ-2).

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  -10  28  -24
        2  -16   24
      1  -8   12    0

So the cubic factors into (λ-2)(λ² -8λ +12) =0

Now factor λ² -8λ +12: looking for two numbers a and b where a+b=8 and a*b=12. 6 and 2: yes.

So λ² -8λ +12 = (λ-6)(λ-2)

Wait, wait, no. (λ-6)(λ-2) = λ² -8λ +12. Yes, correct.

So the characteristic equation factors as (λ-2)(λ-6)(λ-2) =0 → (λ-2)^2 (λ-6) =0.

Wait, wait the quadratic is (λ-6)(λ-2), so the roots are λ=2 (twice) and λ=6. So eigenvalues are 2,2,6.

Wait, but looking at the options given:

Looking back, options are:

A: [3, 1]

B: [2,6]

C: [1,4,5]

D: [1,2]

E: [0,2,4]

F: [4,2,3]

G: [3,4,5]

H: [3,4]

I: [6,2,3]

J: [5,3,1]

Hmm, the eigenvalues I found are 2,2,6. So the set is {2,6}, but with 2 being a double root. But looking at the options, none of them have three eigenvalues except option C, E, F, I, J.

Wait, wait: the matrix is 3x3, so there must be three eigenvalues. So the options that have three elements are C, E, F, I, J.

In the given possible answers, the options are provided as lists. So the eigenvalues are 2, 2, 6. So the possible matches would be any option that includes 2,2,6. But looking at the options:

Option B is [2,6], which is only two values, missing the third. Similarly, option I: [6,2,3]. That would have 6,2,3. That's different. Option E: [0,2,4], no. Option C: [1,4,5], no. Option F: [4,2,3], no. Option I: [6,2,3], no. Option J: [5,3,1], no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I did the synthetic division, I might have made a mistake. Let me redo that.

The cubic equation after factoring out (λ-2) gives the quadratic as λ² -8λ +12.

Wait, that's correct. So the roots are 6 and 2 again? Because (λ² -8λ +12)=0 → λ = [8 ± sqrt(64-48)]/2 = [8 ± sqrt(16)]/2 = [8 ±4]/2 → 6 and 2.

So the eigenvalues are 2, 2, and 6. So the eigenvalues are 2 (with multiplicity 2) and 6.

But looking at the options, none of them have exactly these values. The options that have 2 and 6 are option B and option I.

Option B is [2,6], but that's only two eigenvalues. Since the matrix is 3x3, it must have three eigenvalues. So perhaps the intended answer is [2,2,6], but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Let me recalculate the determinant step by step.

Matrix A - λI is:

[3-λ   1      1   ]
[2     4-λ    2   ]
[1     1      3-λ ]

Compute determinant:

(3-λ) * [(4-λ)(3-λ) - (2)(1)] - 1*[2*(3-λ) -2*1] + 1*[2*1 - (4-λ)*1]

Compute each minor:

First minor (for (3-λ)): (4-λ)(3-λ) - 2*1 = (12 -4λ -3λ +λ²) -2 → λ² -7λ +10.

So first term: (3-λ)(λ² -7λ +10) → same as before.

Second minor (for 1): 2*(3-λ) -2*1 = 6-2λ -2=4-2λ. Multiply by -1: -4 +2λ.

Third minor (for 1): 2*1 - (4-λ)*1 = 2 -4 +λ = λ-2. Multiply by 1: λ-2.

So the determinant is (3-λ)(λ²-7λ+10) + (-4+2λ) + (λ-2).

Expanding (3-λ)(λ²-7λ+10):

=3λ² -21λ +30 -λ³ +7λ² -10λ
= -λ³ + (3λ² +7λ²) + (-21λ -10λ) +30 
= -λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30

Adding (-4+2λ) and (λ-2):

= (-λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30) + (-4 +2λ) + (λ -2)
= -λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30 -6 +3λ
= -λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24.

Multiply by -1: λ³ -10λ² +28λ -24=0.

So that's correct. Then, testing λ=2:

2³ -10*(4) +28*2 -24 →8-40+56-24= (8-40)= -32; (-32+56)=24; 24-24=0 → yes.

Divide by (λ-2) using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | -10 | 28 | -24

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 2 →2. Add to -10 →-8.

Multiply -8 by 2 →-16. Add to 28 →12.

Multiply 12 by 2→24. Add to -24 →0. So the quadratic is λ²-8λ+12.

Which factors into (λ-6)(λ-2). So roots at 6, 2, and 2.

So the eigenvalues are 2,2,6.

Looking back at the options, the options that have three values are C, E, F, I, J.

But none of these options have 2,2,6. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the trace or another approach could help.

Wait, the trace of the matrix A is 3+4+3=10. The sum of eigenvalues should equal the trace. So 2+2+6=10 → which matches.

Looking at the options:

Option C: [1,4,5] → sum 10. Hmm.

Option E: [0,2,4] → sum 6, which doesn't match.

Option F: [4,2,3] → sum 9, no.

Option I: [6,2,3] sum 11, no.

Option J: [5,3,1] sum 9, no.

Option B: [2,6] sum 8, but matrix has 3 eigenvalues, so it's missing one. So none of the options seems to have the correct eigenvalues. But the options given don't include [2,2,6]. Wait, perhaps the options are provided as sets without considering multiplicity. Looking back at the options, perhaps option B is a subset, but it's not correct because it's missing one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should try another approach, like checking if the matrix is symmetric. Since A is symmetric, it's diagonalizable and has real eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant again to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I can compute the determinant using another method, like row operations. Let me try that.

The matrix for determinant is:

|3-λ  1     1    |
|2    4-λ   2    |
|1    1     3-λ |

I can perform row operations to simplify it. Let's subtract the third row from the first row.

Row1 = Row1 - Row3:

(3-λ -1) → 2-λ; 1-1=0; 1 - (3-λ) → 1-3 +λ= λ-2.

So new matrix:

[2-λ   0     λ-2 ]
[2     4-λ   2    ]
[1     1     3-λ ]

Now, the determinant remains the same. Now, expand along the first row, which has a zero which might make it easier.

det = (2-λ) * det( [(4-λ), 2], [1, 3-λ] ) - 0 + (λ-2) * det( [2, 4-λ], [1,1] )

Compute each minor:

First minor: (4-λ)(3-λ) - 2*1 = (12 -7λ + λ²) - 2 → λ² -7λ +10.

Second term: (λ-2) * [2*1 - (4-λ)*1 ] = (λ-2) * [2 -4 +λ ] = (λ-2)(λ-2) = (λ-2)^2.

So determinant is (2-λ)(λ²-7λ+10) + (λ-2)^2.

Factor out (λ-2):

= (λ-2)[ (2-λ)(λ²-7λ +10)/(λ-2) ) + (λ-2) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to expand:

(2-λ)(λ²-7λ+10) = 2λ² -14λ +20 - λ^3 +7λ² -10λ → -λ³ +9λ² -24λ +20.

Plus (λ-2)^2 = λ² -4λ +4.

So total determinant is (-λ³ +9λ² -24λ +20) + (λ² -4λ +4) → -λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24, which matches what I did before.

So earlier calculation was correct. So the eigenvalues are 2,2,6.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, looking at option I: [6,2,3]. Sum is 11, but the trace is 10, so that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial matrix.

Wait, the given matrix is [[3,1,1],[2,4,2],[1,1,3]]. Let me double-check the provided matrix.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try another approach to find the eigenvalues. Maybe compute the trace and determinant.

Wait, the trace is 3 +4 +3 =10. The sum of eigenvalues should be 10.

The determinant of A is the product of eigenvalues. Let's compute determinant of A (with λ=0).

Compute det(A) when λ=0: same as determinant of A.

Matrix A:

3 1 1

2 4 2

1 1 3

Compute determinant:

3*(4*3 - 2*1) -1*(2*3 -2*1) +1*(2*1 -4*1)

Compute each term:

3*(12-2)=3*10=30

-1*(6-2)= -4

+1*(2-4)= -2

So 30 -4 -2 =24. So determinant is 24, which is the product of eigenvalues. So 2*2*6=24. Correct.

So the eigenvalues are 2,2,6.

But none of the options provided match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking again at the options, option B is [2,6], which only lists two eigenvalues, but the matrix is 3x3, so there must be three. Alternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the characteristic equation.

Wait, when I calculated the determinant, I got to -λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24 =0, which becomes λ³ -10λ² +28λ -24=0. Factoring, found (λ-2)^2 (λ-6)=0.

So the eigenvalues are 2,2,6.

Looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is [2,6], but that's missing the third eigenvalue. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to have a different matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix given in the question was different. Let me double-check the matrix.

The matrix A is [[3,1,1],[2,4,2],[1,1,3]]. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the eigenvalues numerically using another method, maybe by finding vectors or using other properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the matrix is diagonalizable. Since it's symmetric, it is.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the trace of A squared and see.

Compute A squared:

A^2 = A * A.

Compute each element:

First row:

3*3 +1*2 +1*1 =9+2+1=12
