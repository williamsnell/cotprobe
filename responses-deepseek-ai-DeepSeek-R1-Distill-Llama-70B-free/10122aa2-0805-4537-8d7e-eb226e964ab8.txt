Okay, I have this question about social power and its types. Let me try to think through it step by step. So, the question is asking what social power is and to discuss three types of it. There are multiple-choice options from A to J.

First, I need to recall what social power means. From what I remember, social power refers to the ability to influence others' behavior, attitudes, or actions. It's about how individuals or groups can affect others in a social context.

Now, the types of social power. I think there's a theory by someone... Oh right, John R. P. French and Bertram Raven. They identified several bases of social power. The main ones I remember are legitimate, expert, referent, coercive, and reward power. Wait, but the question is asking for three types, so maybe some options group these differently.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each to see which aligns with what I know.

Option A: Talks about resource control, distributive, and associative power. I'm not too sure about these terms. Resource control makes sense, but distributive and associative aren't ringing a bell as the primary types.

Option B: Mentions educational, charismatic, and punitive. Punitive might relate to coercive power, but educational and charismatic don't seem like the standard categories. Charismatic is more of a leadership trait, perhaps related to referent power.

Option C: Discusses cultural norms with traditional, informational, and expressive power. Not the usual types I've heard of. Traditional might relate to legitimate power, but the others don't fit.

Option D: Says social power is the ability to change attitudes or behavior, which fits my initial understanding. The three types listed are legitimate, referent, and reward or coercive. Hmm, that's three categories but actually combines reward and coercive into one. So that's legitimate, referent, and reward/coercive. That's three types as per the option, but wait, in French and Raven's model, reward and coercive are separate. But maybe the option is grouping them together as a single type, making three.

Option E: It's about changing social status. I don't think that's the definition. Social power is more about influence than status change.

Option F: Talks about legal decisions and judicial, legislative, executive. That seems more about government branches, not social power types in general.

Option G: Coercive, economic, political. Coercive is one of the types, but economic and political seem broader, not specific to social power bases.

Option H: Persuasive, identity, expert. Expert aligns with expert power, which is one of the types. Persuasive might relate to reward or coercive, or maybe it's a different categorization. Identity could be similar to referent power, which is about personal characteristics.

Option I: Altering public opinion via media, celebrity, grassroots. These are more about influence through different channels, but not the psychological bases of power.

Option J: Controlling economic status. Not the definition I'm familiar with.

So, going back, the correct answer should align with the French and Raven model. Option D lists legitimate, referent, and reward or coercive. Wait, that's three types but combines reward and coercive. Alternatively, maybe another option is better.

Wait, let me think again. French and Raven's five bases are: legitimate, expert, referent, coercive, and reward. So, if an option lists three of these, that would make sense. Option D includes legitimate, referent, and then combines reward and coercive as the third. So that's three types, but technically, reward and coercive are separate. But the question is to name three types, so perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, option H lists expert, which is correct, persuasive (maybe reward?), and identity (referent). So that's three types as well. But I'm not sure if persuasive is the same as reward or coercive.

Wait, the question says "three types". French and Raven have five, but perhaps the question simplifies it into three categories. Option D says reward or coercive as one type, so that gives legitimate, referent, and the third as reward/coercive. So that's three types, as per the question.

So I think option D is the correct answer because it correctly defines social power and lists three types based on the established theory.

The question asks about the definition of social power and its three types. Social power refers to the ability to influence others' behavior, attitudes, or actions. Based on John R. P. French and Bertram Raven's theory, the five bases of social power are legitimate, expert, referent, coercive, and reward power. However, the question simplifies this into three types.

Option D aligns with this by defining social power as "the ability to change the attitudes or behavior of an individual" and listing three types: legitimate, referent, and reward or coercive power. While reward and coercive power are separate in French and Raven's model, the option groups them as one type, making it three types in total. This matches the question's requirement.

Other options either misdefine social power or list types that do not align with the established theory. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: Social power is the ability to change the attitudes or behavior of an individual. Three types of social power are legitimate social power, referent social power, and reward or coercive social power.

Answer: D
