Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember if I've heard any statistics about bullying rates around that time. I think bullying is a significant issue, so the percentage might be on the higher side. But I'm not sure exactly what it was.

Wait, I recall that in the mid-2010s, there was a lot of focus on bullying prevention. Maybe the numbers were around 20-30%? Or was it higher? I'm a bit confused because I've heard different stats from various sources.

Oh, wait, I think the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does surveys on this. They have something called the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) which collects data on various health-related behaviors, including bullying.

From what I remember, in 2015, the YRBSS reported that about 20% of high school students experienced bullying on school property. But wait, the question is about children aged 13-15, which would include some middle school and early high school students. Middle schoolers might have higher rates because bullying can peak around that age.

Alternatively, maybe it's higher than 20%. I'm thinking maybe around 26%? Because sometimes the numbers can vary based on the survey's specific questions. If the question is about being bullied at least once in the past couple of months, that's more frequent than just in the past year.

So looking at the options, 26% is option B, and 36% is G, 16% is H, which seems low. 46% is J, which is almost half. That seems a bit high, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I might have read that around 2015, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school was about 21%. But that's for high school students (grades 9-12). For 13-15, which includes younger teens, the rate might be a bit higher.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the data. Another thought: sometimes the numbers include both being bullied at school and electronically. If the question is about any bullying, including cyberbullying, the percentage could be higher.

Wait, the question specifies "at least once in the past couple of months." So it's a shorter timeframe than the past year. That might lower the percentage because it's more recent, but I'm not sure.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The options are B:26%, G:36%, H:16%, J:46%. I'm trying to recall any specific data points. Maybe the 2015 YRBSS reported that 20.2% of students in grades 9-12 were bullied on school property. But the age here is 13-15, which would be grades 7,8,9 roughly.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is referring to a different survey. Maybe the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or another organization's report. I think I've seen a figure around 25-30% for middle school students.

If that's the case, then 26% (option B) would make sense. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if it's a higher percentage, maybe 36% (G) would be the choice.

Wait, another thought: sometimes bullying statistics can be higher when including cyberbullying. But the question doesn't specify the location, just that they were bullied. So maybe it's any form of bullying, including cyber, which might increase the percentage.

But I'm not certain. I think the best guess I have is that 26% is the correct answer, which would be option B.

The correct answer is based on the recollection of bullying statistics around 2015, particularly focusing on children aged 13-15 in the United States. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) reported that approximately 20% of high school students experienced bullying on school property in 2015. However, considering the age group (13-15) and the possibility of including cyberbullying, the percentage might be slightly higher. Among the options provided, 26% (option B) aligns closely with these considerations, making it the most plausible choice.

Answer: B
