Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the radiation area required for a container. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says there's a gas containing 0.05 mass fraction of CO flowing into a container at 250 lb/hr. So, I think I need to find out how much CO is being fed into the container per hour. Oh right, the mass fraction is 0.05, so that would be 5% of the total mass is CO. So, the CO flow rate is 250 lb/hr * 0.05, which is 12.5 lb/hr. Got that part.

Next, the CO is being oxidized to CO2. The heat of combustion is given as 4350 Btu per pound of CO. So, I guess the heat released per hour would be the mass of CO burned multiplied by the heat of combustion. So that's 12.5 lb/hr * 4350 Btu/lb. Let me calculate that: 12.5 * 4350 = let's see, 12 * 4350 is 52200, and 0.5 *4350 is 2175, so total is 54375 Btu/hr. So the heat liberation rate is 54,375 Btu per hour.

But wait, the container radiates 65% of this heat. So the heat radiated per hour is 0.65 * 54,375. Let me compute that: 0.6 *54,375 is 32,625 and 0.05 *54,375 is about 2,718.75. Adding them gives 35,343.75 Btu/hr. So the radiation is 35,343.75 Btu/hr.

Now, the container is at 1500°F, and the surroundings are at 150°F. I remember that radiation heat transfer follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and the formula is Q = σ * A * (T1^4 - T2^4), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, but units are important here.

Wait, the temperatures are in Fahrenheit, but the formula requires absolute temperatures, right? So I need to convert them to Rankine. How to convert: F to R is F + 459.67. So container temp T1 is 1500 + 459.67 = 1959.67 R. Surroundings T2 is 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 R.

Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ, I think in English units it's 0.1714 ×10^-8 Btu/hr·ft²·R⁻⁴. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, the value is 0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R⁴). So I'll use that.

So putting it all into the formula:

Q = σ * A * (T1^4 - T2^4)

We need to solve for A. So:

A = Q / (σ * (T1^4 - T2^4))

Plugging in the numbers:

Q is 35,343.75 Btu/hr.

Compute T1^4 and T2^4. Let me do that step by step.

First, T1 = 1959.67 R. T1^4 = (1959.67)^4. Oh, that's a big number. Maybe I can compute it in parts.

Wait, maybe I can compute T1^4 - T2^4.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute (T1^2)^2 - (T2^2)^2, but that might not help. Alternatively, factor it as (T1^2 + T2^2)(T1 + T2)(T1 - T2). Hmm, but that might complicate it more. Alternatively, just calculate each term separately.

Wait, I'm probably going to need a calculator for this, but since I don't have one, maybe I can estimate. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that T1 is much larger than T2, so T2^4 is negligible compared to T1^4. Let me check.

T1 is about 1960 R, T2 is about 610 R. So (610/1960)^4 is approximately (0.311)^4 ≈ 0.311 * 0.311 is ~0.096, times 0.311^2 again: 0.096 * 0.096 is ~0.0092. So T2^4 is about 0.0092 times T1^4. So T1^4 - T2^4 ≈ 0.9908 T1^4. So it's about 99% of T1^4, so I can approximate it as 0.99 T1^4, but maybe for the sake of an exam problem, we can ignore T2^4. But maybe the difference isn't negligible. Let me see: Let's compute T1^4 and T2^4.

Wait, 1959.67^4 is (approx 2000 R)^4. 2000^4 is 16,000,000,000 (since 2^4=16, and (10^3)^4=10^12). So 1959.67 is about 1960, which is 2000 * 0.98. So (0.98)^4 is approx 0.922. So 2000^4 is 16e12, so 1960^4 is 16e12 * 0.922 ≈ 14.75e12.

Similarly, 610^4: 600 is 6e2, so (6e2)^4 = 6^4 * (10^2)^4 = 1296 * 10^8 = 1.296e11. 610 is 1.0167 times 600, so (1.0167)^4 is approximately 1.067. So 610^4 ≈ 1.296e11 * 1.067 ≈ 1.383e11.

So T1^4 is approx 1.475e13 (since 14.75e12 is 1.475e13?), wait no, 14.75e12 is 1.475e13? Wait, 1e12 is 10^12. So 14.75e12 is 1.475e13. And T2^4 is about 1.383e11.

So T1^4 - T2^4 is approx 1.475e13 - 1.383e11 = let's see, 1.475e13 is 14750000000000, 1.383e11 is 13830000000. So subtracting gives 14750000000000 - 13830000000 ≈ 1475e9 - 13.83e9 = 1461.17e9. Wait, no, wait a minute, that can't be right. Because 1.475e13 is 14,750,000,000,000 and 1.383e11 is 138,300,000,000. So the difference is 14,750,000,000,000 - 138,300,000,000 = 14,611,700,000,000, which is 1.4617e13.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1^4 is 14.75e12, which is 1.475e13, and T2^4 is 1.383e11, so the difference is 1.475e13 - 0.01383e13 = 1.46117e13.

So approximately 1.461e13 R^4.

So now, putting into the equation:

A = Q / (σ * (T1^4 - T2^4))

We have Q = 35,343.75 Btu/hr.

σ is 0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·R⁴).

So plugging in:

A = 35,343.75 / (0.1714e-8 * 1.461e13)

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.1714e-8 *1.461e13.

0.1714e-8 is 1.714 x 10^-9.

Wait, wait, 0.1714e-8 is 0.1714 * 1e-8 = 1.714e-9.

So 1.714e-9 * 1.461e13 = 1.714 * 1.461 * 1e4 (since 1e-9 *1e13 =1e4 )

Compute 1.714 *1.461: Let's approximate.

1.7 * 1.46 = about 2.482. Let me calculate it exactly:

1.714 * 1.461:

1.714 *1 = 1.714

1.714 * 0.4 = 0.6856

1.714 * 0.06= 0.10284

1.714*0.001=0.001714

Adding them: 1.714 + 0.6856 = 2.3996; +0.10284 = 2.50244; +0.001714= ~2.504154.

So 2.504154 * 1e4 = 25041.54.

So denominator is approximately 25041.54.

So A = 35,343.75 / 25041.54 ≈ let's compute that.

35,343.75 ÷ 25,041.54.

25,041.54 × 1.4 = 35,057.6 (since 25k * 1.4 is 35k).

35,343.75 -35,057.6 = 286.15.

So 25,041.54 × 0.4 = 10,016.616, which is way more than 286.15. So maybe 1.4 + (286.15 /25,041.54).

286.15 /25,041.54 ≈ 0.01143.

So A≈ 1.4 + 0.01143 ≈ 1.41143 ft². Hmm, so approximately 1.41 ft². Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option H is 1.41 ft². So that's probably the right answer.

But wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me double-check.

Wait, the mass fraction is 0.05, so 250 lb/hr times 0.05 is 12.5 lb/hr of CO. Correct.

Heat of combustion is 4350 Btu/lb, so 12.5 *4350 is indeed 54,375 Btu/hr. 65% is 35,343.75. Correct.

Temperatures converted to Rankine: 1500 +459.67=1959.67 R, and 150+459.67=609.67 R. Correct.

Stefan-Boltzmann constant is 0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·R⁴). Yes.

Calculating T1^4 and T2^4: I approximated but I think the approach is correct. The difference is about 1.46e13, which seems right.

Denominator was 0.1714e-8 *1.46e13 = approximately 25041.54, correct.

Then A=35,343.75 /25,041.54≈1.41 ft². So the answer should be H: 1.41 ft².

To determine the radiation area required, we start by calculating the heat liberated due to the combustion of CO. The gas contains a 0.05 mass fraction of CO, and the flow rate is 250 lb/hr. Thus, the CO flow rate is:

\[
\text{CO flow rate} = 250 \, \text{lb/hr} \times 0.05 = 12.5 \, \text{lb/hr}.
\]

The heat of combustion of CO is 4350 Btu/lb, so the total heat liberated per hour is:

\[
Q_{\text{combustion}} = 12.5 \, \text{lb/hr} \times 4350 \, \text{Btu/lb} = 54,375 \, \text{Btu/hr}.
\]

The container radiates 65% of this heat, so the heat radiated per hour is:

\[
Q_{\text{radiated}} = 0.65 \times 54,375 = 35,343.75 \, \text{Btu/hr}.
\]

The radiation heat transfer follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
Q = \sigma A \left(T_1^4 - T_2^4\right),
\]

where \( \sigma = 0.1714 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{Btu/(hr·ft}^2\text{·R}^4\text{)} \), \( T_1 \) is the absolute temperature of the container, and \( T_2 \) is the absolute temperature of the surroundings. Converting temperatures to Rankine:

\[
T_1 = 1500 + 459.67 = 1959.67 \, \text{R}, \quad T_2 = 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 \, \text{R}.
\]

The term \( T_1^4 - T_2^4 \) is calculated as follows:

\[
T_1^4 \approx (1959.67)^4 \approx 1.475 \times 10^{13}, \quad T_2^4 \approx (609.67)^4 \approx 1.383 \times 10^{11}.
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1^4 - T_2^4 \approx 1.475 \times 10^{13} - 1.383 \times 10^{11} \approx 1.461 \times 10^{13}.
\]

Substituting into the formula for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{Q_{\text{radiated}}}{\sigma \left(T_1^4 - T_2^4\right)} = \frac{35,343.75}{0.1714 \times 10^{-8} \times 1.461 \times 10^{13}}.
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.1714 \times 10^{-8} \times 1.461 \times 10^{13} = 1.714 \times 1.461 \times 10^4 \approx 25,041.54.
\]

Now, calculate \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{35,343.75}{25,041.54} \approx 1.41 \, \text{ft}^2.
\]

Thus, the required radiation area is approximately **1.41 ft²**, which corresponds to **Option H**.

**Answer: H**
