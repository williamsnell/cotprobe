Okay, so I've got this problem here about Edith Calder's earnings. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, so the problem says she gets a weekly salary of $80. That's straightforward. But then there's this commission part. Oh right, she earns a 5% commission on her sales over $1,000. So I need to calculate that commission and add it to her base salary.

Wait, her sales last week were $1,354.20. Oh, so first I should find out how much of that is over $1,000. Let me subtract 1000 from 1354.20. Let me do the math: 1354.20 minus 1000 is 354.20. So she made $354.20 over the $1,000 threshold.

Now, the commission is 5% of that amount. So I need to calculate 5% of 354.20. Hmm, 5% is the same as 0.05, right? So 354.20 multiplied by 0.05. Let me do that. 354.2 times 0.05... Well, 350 * 0.05 is 17.5, and 4.2 * 0.05 is 0.21. So adding those together, 17.5 + 0.21 equals 17.71. So her commission is $17.71.

Wait, wait, I think I got that right. So her total earnings are her base salary plus the commission. Her base is $80, so adding 17.71 gives me 80 + 17.71 = 97.71. Let me double-check that addition. 80 plus 17 is 97, then plus 0.71 makes 97.71. Yep, that seems correct.

Now looking at the options, option I is $97.71. So that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. She only gets commission on the amount over $1,000, and I subtracted correctly. Yes, that's right. So her earnings are $97.71.

Edith Calder's weekly earnings consist of a base salary of $80 plus a 5% commission on sales over $1,000. Her sales last week were $1,354.20. 

First, calculate the amount of sales over $1,000:  
$1,354.20 - $1,000.00 = $354.20.  

Next, compute the 5% commission on $354.20:  
$354.20 Ã— 0.05 = $17.71.  

Add the commission to her base salary:  
$80.00 + $17.71 = $97.71.  

Thus, her total earnings for the week are $97.71.  

The correct answer is **I: $97.71**.
