Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A mass weighing 8 lb stretches a spring 1.5 inches. The mass is also attached to a damper with coefficient γ. We need to determine the value of γ for which the system is critically damped, and include the units.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that in mechanical systems, damping has different states: underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped. Critical damping is when the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. So the question is about finding the right γ for that.

I think the key here is to use the concept of critical damping. From what I recall, the formula for critical damping involves the mass and the spring constant. Oh wait, critical damping coefficient (γ_c) is given by γ_c = 2*sqrt(k*m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass.

Right, so I need to find k first because it's not given directly. The mass is 8 lb, and it stretches the spring by 1.5 inches. Wait, units here are in inches, but I think in the English system, we usually work in feet, so I might need to convert that.

Wait, Hooke's Law says F = -kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement. So here, the force is the weight of the mass, which is 8 lb. The displacement x is 1.5 inches, which I should convert to feet because the standard unit in the English system is feet for length.

Oh wait, 1.5 inches is 1.5/12 feet. Let me calculate that. 1.5 divided by 12 is 0.125 feet. So x is 0.125 ft.

So, F = kx → 8 lb = k * 0.125 ft → solving for k gives k = 8 / 0.125 lb/ft. Let's compute that. 8 divided by 0.125 is 64. So k is 64 lb/ft.

Wait, that makes sense. Because 0.125 is 1/8, so 8 divided by 1/8 is 64. Yep, got that right.

Now, with k known, the next step is to find the critical damping coefficient γ_c. The formula is γ_c = 2*sqrt(k*m). But wait, what are the units for mass here? Oh wait, because the weight is given as 8 lb, which is a force. So I need to convert that into mass in slugs because in the English system, mass is measured in slugs.

Right, because weight W = m * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. So m = W / g. Here, W is 8 lb, and g is typically 32 ft/s².

So m = 8 lb / 32 ft/s² = 0.25 slugs.

Wait, let me make sure. Because W = m g → m = W/g. So yes, 8 divided by 32 is 0.25. So mass m is 0.25 slugs.

Now, plugging into the critical damping formula: γ_c = 2 * sqrt(k*m). So k is 64 lb/ft, m is 0.25 slugs.

Let me compute sqrt(k*m) first. So 64 * 0.25 = 16. sqrt(16) is 4. So 2 * 4 is 8.

Wait, so γ_c is 8 lb·s/ft? Because the units for damping coefficient γ are force per velocity, which is lb·s/ft.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 8 lb·s/ft. But wait, I thought I remember that the critical damping is when the damping equals twice the square root of (k*m), which is what I did here. So that would give 8 lb·s/ft.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, another way: the damping coefficient for critical damping is γ_c = 2*sqrt(k m). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up something. Let me think again.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is γ_c = 2*sqrt(k m). Wait, no, no, wait. In some derivations, the equation of motion is m y'' + γ y' + k y = 0. So the characteristic equation is m r² + γ r + k = 0. For critical damping, the discriminant must be zero. So the discriminant is γ² - 4 m k = 0 → γ² =4 m k → γ=2 sqrt(m k).

Wait, but wait. I might have mixed up m and k. Let me see.

Wait, the standard form is for the equation m y'' + b y' + k y = 0, where b is the damping coefficient. The condition for critical damping is b^2 = 4 m k. So yes, b = 2 sqrt(m k).

Wait, but wait a second. I thought that in some sources, it's written as the damping coefficient being 2*sqrt(k/m), but I don't think so. No, it's 2*sqrt(m k) when the equation is in terms of m, b, k.

Wait, let's clarify the formula. The standard form for a damped oscillator is y'' + (b/m) y' + (k/m) y = 0. The discriminant for critical damping is when (b/m)^2 = 4*(k/m). So (b^2)/(m^2) = 4k/m → b² =4 m k → b=2√(m k).

Yes, that's correct. So the formula is γ = 2*sqrt(m k).

So in this problem, m is 0.25 slugs, k is 64 lb/ft.

So m * k = 0.25 * 64 = 16. So sqrt(16) is 4. Then 2 *4 =8. So γ=8 lb·s/ft.

But looking at the options, option J is 8 lb·s/ft. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

So let me recompute: m = 8 lb / 32 ft/s² = 0.25 slugs. Correct.

k = 8 lb / 0.125 ft = 64 lb/ft. Correct.

Then, m*k = 0.25 *64=16. sqrt(16)=4. 2*4=8. So γ=8. So the answer should be J.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option I is 12. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check each step again.

First, the spring constant k. The force is 8 lb, displacement is 1.5 inches, which is 0.125 ft. So k = F/x = 8 lb / 0.125 ft = 64 lb/ft. Correct.

Mass m: weight is 8 lb. So m = W/g = 8 /32 = 0.25 slugs. Correct.

So γ = 2*sqrt(mk) = 2*sqrt(0.25 *64) = 2*sqrt(16) = 2*4=8.

Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be J:8 lb·s/ft.

Wait, but wait another thing. I've seen some references where the formula for critical damping uses γ_c = 2 m ω_n, where ω_n is the natural frequency. And ω_n is sqrt(k/m). So γ_c=2 m sqrt(k/m) = 2 sqrt(m k). Which is the same as before. So the calculation is correct.

So then the correct answer is J. But wait, looking at the options again:

Options:

A: 10 lb·s/ft

B: 2

C:4

D:14

E:6

F:20

G:16

H:18

I:12

J:8

So J is 8, which is what I got. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in some textbooks, the damping coefficient is given by γ_c=2√(k m), but sometimes I've heard it as γ_c=2√(m k). Wait, no, that's the same thing. Because √(m k) is same as √(k m). So that can't be the issue.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion for the spring constant. Let me check that again.

The displacement is 1.5 inches. 1 inch is 1/12 ft, so 1.5 inches is (1.5)(1/12) ft = 0.125 ft. Correct.

So F=8 lb, x=0.125 ft → k= F/x=8/0.125=64 lb/ft. Correct.

So I think I didn't make a mistake there.

So I'm confident the answer is J:8 lb·s/ft.

To determine the value of the damping coefficient $\gamma$ for which the system is critically damped, we use the formula for critical damping:

\[
\gamma_c = 2 \sqrt{k \cdot m}
\]

where $k$ is the spring constant and $m$ is the mass. The problem provides the following information:

1. The weight of the mass is $8 \, \mathrm{lb}$.
2. The spring is stretched by $1.5 \, \mathrm{in}$, which is converted to $0.125 \, \mathrm{ft}$.

### Step 1: Calculate the spring constant $k$
Using Hooke's Law, $F = kx$, where $F$ is the force and $x$ is the displacement:
\[
k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{8 \, \mathrm{lb}}{0.125 \, \mathrm{ft}} = 64 \, \mathrm{lb/ft}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass $m$
The weight of the mass is given as $8 \, \mathrm{lb}$. Using the relationship $W = m \cdot g$, where $g = 32 \, \mathrm{ft/s^2}$:
\[
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{8 \, \mathrm{lb}}{32 \, \mathrm{ft/s^2}} = 0.25 \, \mathrm{slugs}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the critical damping coefficient $\gamma_c$
Substitute $k = 64 \, \mathrm{lb/ft}$ and $m = 0.25 \, \mathrm{slugs}$ into the formula for $\gamma_c$:
\[
\gamma_c = 2 \sqrt{k \cdot m} = 2 \sqrt{64 \cdot 0.25} = 2 \sqrt{16} = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \, \mathrm{lb \cdot s/ft}.
\]

### Final Answer
The value of $\gamma$ for critical damping is $8 \, \mathrm{lb \cdot s/ft}$, which corresponds to option **J**.
