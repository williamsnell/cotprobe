When the fee simple owner died, the life estate owner conveyed his interest to his children.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about life estates and fee simple ownership.

Alright, the scenario is that a man owned real estate in fee simple. He transferred a life estate to his friend for the friend's lifetime. Later, when the fee simple owner died, the life estate owner (the friend) conveyed his interest to his children. Now, the deceased fee simple owner's son is suing the children, claiming that the life estate is broken and he owns the property absolutely. The question is whether the children have an enforceable interest.

First, I need to remember what a life estate entails. A life estate is an interest in land for the life of a person. It can be for the life of the holder or the life of another person. The key point is that it's temporary and doesn't transfer into ownership beyond that life. When the life tenant dies, the property reverts back to the grantor or their heirs.

Wait, but in this case, the grantor (the original fee simple owner) has died. So when he died, what happens to the life estate? Oh, no, wait. The grantor created a life estate in the friend. So the friend has the right to use the property until his death. But the grantor himself died before the friend. So the grantor's death doesn't affect the friend's life estate, right? Because the life estate is measured by the friend's life, not the grantor's.

So after the grantor dies, the friend still holds the life estate. Now, the friend conveys his interest to his children. Can a life estate holder convey their interest? Hmm. I think that a life tenant can transfer their interest, but only for the duration of their life. So the children would get a life estate, but only as long as the father (the original life tenant) is alive. Wait, no, because the father is the life tenant. So if the father conveys to the children, the children's interest would last only during the father's life. Because the father's life estate ends when he dies, and then the property goes back to the grantor's estate or heirs.

Wait, but the grantor has already died. So what happens after the friend (life tenant) dies? The property reverts to the grantor's estate, which would pass to the grantor's heirs, like his son. So the son is suing, saying that the life estate is broken, so he owns it absolutely now.

But the issue is whether the children of the life estate owner have an enforceable interest. So when the friend conveyed his life estate to his children, what did they get? They got a life estate, but only for the duration of the friend's life. But if the friend is still alive, then the children's interest is valid until he dies. Alternatively, if the friend has died, then their interest would have ended.

Wait, but in the question, the fee simple owner died first, then the life estate owner conveyed to his children. So the friend is still alive at that point. So the children get the life estate, but only during their father's life. So when the father dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to the grantor's estate, which is now the son.

So the son is suing the children, claiming the life estate is broken. But the life estate isn't broken; it's just that the friend conveyed it. The son's claim is that the life estate ended when the fee simple owner died, but that's not correct. The life estate continues until the life tenant's death, regardless of when the grantor dies.

Wait, so the son is arguing that the life estate is now terminated because the fee simple owner died. But that's not right because the life estate's duration is tied to the life tenant, not the grantor. So the son's argument is wrong. Therefore, the children's interest is enforceable as long as their father (the life estate holder) is alive.

Looking at the options:

Option G says "Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons." That sounds correct because a life tenant can transfer their interest, though it's only for the duration of their life.

Option H says the life estate was broken when the life tenant conveyed to his children. But that's not correct because transferring the interest doesn't break the estate; it just passes the interest.

Option E says the life estate terminated upon the fee owner's death, which is wrong because the life estate continues beyond the grantor's death.

Option I says the children inherited upon their father's death. But the father is still alive when he conveyed the interest, so the children don't inherit yet; they receive a present interest.

So the correct answer should be G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.

The question revolves around the enforceability of interests conveyed by a life estate holder. A life estate grants the right to use and occupy property for the life of the holder, and upon the holder's death, the property reverts to the grantor's estate or heirs. In this case, the original fee simple owner created a life estate in favor of his friend. When the fee simple owner died, the life estate remained intact, as its duration is tied to the life tenant's lifetime, not the grantor's. The life tenant then conveyed his interest to his children, and the question is whether this conveyance created an enforceable interest for the children.

Key points to consider:

1. **Life Estate Characteristics**: A life estate is not affected by the death of the grantor; it continues until the life tenant's death. The grantor's death does not terminate the life estate.

2. **Conveyance of Life Estate**: A life tenant can convey their interest to others, but the conveyance is limited to the duration of the life tenant's life. The children of the life tenant would hold the life estate during their father's lifetime, and upon his death, the property would revert to the grantor's estate or heirs.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The life estate is not broken by the death of the fee simple owner; it continues until the life tenant's death.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. A life tenant is allowed to convey their interest, though it is limited to their lifetime.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The life tenant does not become the fee simple owner; they hold only a life estate.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The children do not own the property in fee simple; they hold a life estate during their father's lifetime.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The life estate does not terminate upon the fee simple owner's death; it continues until the life tenant's death.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The children hold a life estate, not a leasehold interest.
   - **Option G**: Correct. The life tenant could convey his life estate to third persons, though the interest conveyed is limited to the duration of his life.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Conveying the life estate does not "break" the estate; it merely transfers the interest to others for the life tenant's lifetime.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The children do not inherit the life estate upon their father's death; the life estate ends when the life tenant dies, and the property reverts to the grantor's estate.

The correct answer is **G**: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.
