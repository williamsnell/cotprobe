Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form. The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.
Of Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stoneâ€”it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk."
The Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the origins of epic poetry like the Epic of Gilgamesh. Let me start by recalling what I know about epic poetry and its historical context.

Epic poems are long narratives that often tell heroic stories, sometimes based on real or mythical figures. The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest known examples, dating back to around 2100 B.C.E. It's from Mesopotamia, which is modern-day Iraq, and it's about Gilgamesh, a king of Uruk.

The question is asking about the origins of such epic poetry. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different social class or development as the origin. I need to think about what societal factors could have led to the creation and recording of epic poems.

I remember that in ancient Mesopotamia, cities were centers of civilization with their own governments, often ruled by kings who were considered to have divine connections. Temples and ziggurats were important, and the priestly class held significant power because they were intermediaries between the gods and the people.

Epic poetry often served to glorify kings and their deeds, which would help legitimize their rule. For example, Gilgamesh is part god and part man, which elevates his status. The epic also talks about the walls and temples he built, which would have been important for the city's prosperity and the priests' influence.

So, thinking about the options:

Option B says the rise of a priestly class who communicated with gods. That makes sense because priests would have the influence and resources to create and preserve such stories. They could use these epics to maintain their power and explain the divine order.

Option G mentions a literate class of scribes. Scribes were definitely important because they were the ones who wrote down the epics. Without a literate class, the epic wouldn't have been recorded in written form. But does that explain the origin of epic poetry itself, or just its recording?

Option I talks about a warrior elite. Gilgamesh was a warrior king, so his story being told would fit here. But I'm not sure if the rise of a warrior class is the primary origin factor.

Option J is about a scholarly class translating oral stories. That might be part of the process, but again, it's more about the transition from oral to written rather than the origin.

So, putting it together: Epic poetry likely originated in societies where certain classes had the power and need to create these stories. The priestly class (option B) would have the motive to create epics that glorify the king, who was often seen as divine. This would reinforce their own authority and the king's legitimacy. Alternatively, the scribes (option G) were the ones who could write them down, but the origin is more about why the stories were created in the first place.

Wait, but the question is about the origins of epic poetry, not just their recording. So the creation of these stories probably comes from a society where there's a need to tell grand, legitimizing tales. The priestly class would need to promote the king's divine right, so they might be the ones generating these stories. Or perhaps it's the scribes who, as a literate class, could compose and write them.

Another angle: The Epic of Gilgamesh was inscribed on clay tablets, which required scribes. So without a class of scribes, the epic wouldn't have been written down. But the oral tradition probably existed before that. So the rise of a literate class (scribes) allowed these epics to be recorded, which is part of their origin in the written form.

Wait, but the question is about the origins of epic poetry in general, not just written epics. So maybe the oral tradition came first, fueled by the needs of the society. So perhaps the priestly class or the kings themselves were the source, using these stories to maintain their power.

Looking back at the options, option G says the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems. This would mean that once scribes existed, they could write down the epics, which might have existed orally before. So the origins of the written epic would be tied to scribes.

Alternatively, option B suggests the priestly class's rise led to the creation of epics as they communicated with gods. That would mean the content of the epics was driven by religious needs.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think both factors played a role, but the question is asking which best describes the origins. Since the Epic of Gilgamesh was written in a city (Uruk) and involved the temple and the king, the priestly class would have had a significant role. They would compose and sponsor such epics to legitimize the king's divine authority.

Wait, but another thought: The development of cities and urban centers allowed for specialized classes, including both priests and scribes. The existence of scribes made it possible to record these stories, which were likely composed by priests or other religious figures.

So, without scribes, the epic wouldn't have been written down. But the content and the reason for the epic's existence would come from the priestly class or the king's need for legitimacy.

But the question is about the origins of epic poetry, which could have started orally before being written. So the rise of a literate class (G) allowed for the recording, but the initial creation would have been driven by religious or political needs.

But among the options, which one is the best fit? The question asks which best describes the origins. So if it's about the creation and recording, then G is about the recording part. But if it's about why the stories were created, then B or I.

Wait, the options are about the origins of epic poetry such as Gilgamesh. So the rise of a literate class (G) would explain how it was written down, but maybe the actual origin in terms of content comes from a priestly class or kings.

Alternatively, looking at the passage, it's written in a way that praises the king and the city, including the temple. So it's likely that the priestly class was involved in creating and preserving such epics.

But the options don't have "priestly class who created epics to legitimize kings." Option B is about the rise of a priestly class who communicate with gods. So perhaps that's the driving force.

Alternatively, option G says that scribes could record the poems, which is about the mechanism, not the reason.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the origins of epic poetry, which would have started as oral traditions before being written. The written form came with the rise of scribes. So G might be the answer because without scribes, the epics couldn't be recorded, allowing them to become part of literature.

But another angle: The epic was used to legitimize the king's rule, which was tied to the priestly class. So the priestly class's power led to the creation of such epics.

I'm a bit torn between B and G. Let me think about the process. Epic poetry as a written form requires scribes. So the rise of a literate class (G) would make written epics possible. Oral epics might have existed before, but the question is about the written form.

But the question doesn't specify written vs. oral. It just asks about the origins of epic poetry such as Gilgamesh. Since Gilgamesh is a written epic, its origins in written form would require scribes.

Alternatively, the rise of cities (which is where both scribes and priests were) is a broader factor, but the options don't include that.

So perhaps the answer is G: the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option J is about a scholarly class translating oral into written. That's similar to G but more specific about oral to written.

But I think the key is that without scribes, the written epic wouldn't exist. So G would be the best fit.

The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known examples of epic poetry, originated in ancient Mesopotamia around 2100 B.C.E. It tells the story of Gilgamesh, a king of Uruk, who was part god and part man, and it glorifies his deeds, reinforcing his divine legitimacy and the authority of the priestly class. The question asks about the origins of such epic poetry, and the options provided suggest various societal developments as potential explanations.

Epic poetry often served to legitimize kings and their rule, with the priestly class playing a significant role in creating and preserving these stories to maintain their power and explain the divine order. However, the written form of the Epic of Gilgamesh required the existence of a literate class of scribes who could record and inscribe the poem on clay tablets. Without scribes, the epic would not have been preserved in its written form, even if it existed orally beforehand.

Option B suggests the rise of a priestly class who communicated with the gods, which aligns with the religious and political motivations behind the creation of such epics. Option G, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of a literate class of scribes in recording the poems, which is crucial for the written form of the epic. While the priestly class likely drove the content and purpose of the epic, the question specifically refers to the origins of epic poetry "such as the Epic of Gilgamesh," which is known in its written form. Therefore, the rise of a literate class of scribes (Option G) best explains the origins of written epic poetry, as they were essential for its recording and preservation.

Answer: G
