Okay, so I have this problem here about a school principal needing to choose three different teachers for a graduation ceremony. Each teacher will have a specific role: one as the opener, one as the name-reader, and one as the closer. There are 85 teachers on staff. The question is asking how many possible speaking lineups the principal can have.

Hmm, let me think about this. So, first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. A lineup implies that the order matters because each position is distinct. So the opener is a different role from the name-reader and the closer. That means this is a permutation problem because the order of selection matters.

Right, so for permutations, the formula is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. But wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly. Oh wait, yes, when the order matters and you're selecting without replacement, it's a permutation.

In this case, n is 85 teachers, and k is 3 positions. So the calculation should be 85 * 84 * 83. Let me compute that step by step.

So 85 multiplied by 84. Let me do that first. 85*80 is 6800, and 85*4 is 340. Adding those together, 6800 + 340 = 7140. Okay, now multiply that by 83.

Hmm, 7140 * 80 is 571,200. And 7140 * 3 is 21,420. Adding those together: 571,200 + 21,420 = 592,620.

So the number of possible lineups is 592,620. Now I look at the options given:

Option C is 592,620, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check my math just to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in multiplication.

Compute 85 * 84 first. 80*84=6720, 5*84=420. 6720+420=7140. That's correct.

Now 7140 *83: Let me break it down into (7000 + 140) *83.

7000*83 = 581,000 (since 7000*80=560,000; 7000*3=21,000 → 560k +21k=581k).

140 *83: 100*83=8,300; 40*83=3,320. 8,300 +3,320 = 11,620.

Adding 581,000 and 11,620 gives 592,620. Yep, that's the same as before. So definitely option C.
</think>

The problem involves selecting three teachers from a staff of 85 for distinct roles at a graduation ceremony, where the order of selection matters. This is a permutation problem, calculated as:

\[
P(n, k) = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2)
\]

Substituting \( n = 85 \) and \( k = 3 \):

\[
85 \times 84 \times 83 = 592,620
\]

Thus, the number of possible speaking lineups is **592,620**, which corresponds to option **C**.
