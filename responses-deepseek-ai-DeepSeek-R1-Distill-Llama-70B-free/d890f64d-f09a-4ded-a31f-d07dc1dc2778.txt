Question:

A professor was the record owner in fee simple absolute of a 30-acre tract of land located in a small town. The professor made a conveyance thereof in these words, "I hereby convey my 30-acre tract to both my friend and my co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Two years after making the conveyance to the friend and the co-worker, the friend executed a mortgage on the 30-acre tract of land to a bank to secure a loan. One year after executing the mortgage, the friend died intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. At the time of the friend's death, the indebtedness had not been paid to the bank. The jurisdiction in which the 30-acre tract of land is located recognizes a title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to the 30-acre tract of land is vested

Options:

A: in the bank until the mortgage is paid, then in the co-worker and the uncle.
B: half in the co-worker and half in the bank, with both subject to the mortgage.
C: entirely in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.
D: entirely in the uncle, free and clear of the mortgage.
E: half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, with both subject to the mortgage.
F: in the co-worker and the uncle, with the co-worker's portion free of the mortgage and the uncle's portion subject to it.
G: half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.
H: in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.
I: half in the co-worker, subject to the mortgage, and half in the uncle, free of the mortgage.

Okay, so I've got this property law question in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

First, the setup: A professor owns a 30-acre tract in fee simple absolute. He conveys it to his friend and co-worker as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. So that makes both of them joint tenants. I remember that joint tenancy means they each have an equal share, but the key thing is the right of survivorshipâ€”when one dies, the other gets their share automatically.

Two years after the conveyance, the friend mortgages the 30-acre tract to a bank to secure a loan. Then, one year later, the friend dies intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. The loan hasn't been paid off yet. The jurisdiction is a title theory state for mortgages. Hmm, I need to remember what that means. In title theory states, the mortgagee (the bank) holds the legal title until the loan is paid off. In lien theory states, the borrower keeps title, and the mortgage is just a lien against the property.

So, the question is, who has title now? The options are A through I, each distributing title differently among the co-worker, the uncle, and the bank.

Let me think about the timeline. The professor conveyed the property to friend and co-worker as joint tenants. So initially, both have equal shares, each with a right of survivorship. That means when one dies, the other gets their share.

Friend then mortgages the property. But wait, in joint tenancy, each owns an undivided half. So when the friend mortgages his interest, what happens? In a title theory state, the bank gets the legal title to the friend's share. But does that affect the co-worker's share? Because in joint tenancy, each has a separate but equal interest. So the friend's interest is mortgaged, but does the co-worker's share get affected?

Wait, but when the friend dies, under joint tenancy, the co-worker gets the friend's share by survivorship. But if the friend had mortgaged his interest, does the mortgage bind the co-worker's interest? Or does the mortgage only affect the friend's half?

I think in a title theory state, when the friend mortgages his interest, the bank gets title to his half. But upon the friend's death, the co-worker's right of survivorship would take the friend's interest, but the mortgage was already on it. So does the co-worker take the interest subject to the mortgage, or does the mortgage get extinguished?

Wait, when the friend dies, the co-worker becomes the sole owner, but the friend's half was mortgaged. So under joint tenancy, the co-worker gets the entire title, but the mortgage would still encumber the property. But wait, in title theory states, the bank holds the legal title as security. So when the friend dies, does the co-worker's interest merge, making the co-worker the sole owner, but with the mortgage still on the property?

Alternatively, maybe the mortgage only affects the friend's half. So upon the friend's death, the co-worker's half is free, but the friend's half (now going to the co-worker) is subject to the mortgage. But that doesn't quite make sense because in joint tenancy, the shares are undivided. So perhaps the entire property is subject to the mortgage.

Wait, but the friend only owned half. So when he mortgages his half, the bank has a claim on that half. But because it's joint tenancy, when he dies, his half goes to the co-worker. So the co-worker now owns the entire property, but the bank's mortgage is on the friend's half. So maybe the co-worker now owns the whole property, but the bank can enforce the mortgage against the half that was the friend's. But in title theory, the bank holds the legal title to the mortgaged half. So when the friend dies, the co-worker would take the entire title, but the bank still has a mortgage on the friend's half. So the co-worker would own the entire property, but the bank has a lien (or holds title) to half of it.

Wait, but in title theory, the mortgage conveys legal title to the mortgagee. So when the friend mortgages his interest, the bank gets title to his half. Then, when the friend dies, the co-worker's right of survivorship would take the friend's interest, but the friend's interest was already mortgaged, so the co-worker would take it subject to the mortgage.

Alternatively, maybe the co-worker takes the entire property, but the friend's half was already mortgaged, so the bank can foreclose on that half, but the co-worker owns both halves now. Wait, but if it's joint tenancy, the co-worker would have the entire title, but the mortgage would still be on the friend's half. So perhaps the co-worker now holds the entire title, but the bank has a mortgage on half of it.

Wait, but in a title theory state, the bank holds legal title to the mortgaged half. So after the friend's death, the co-worker owns the entire property, but the bank still holds title to the friend's half. Or does the right of survivorship mean the co-worker gets the entire title, and the mortgage is extinguished? I'm a bit confused here.

Another angle: in a title theory state, when the friend mortgages his interest, he conveys legal title to the bank. So the bank owns the friend's half, and the co-worker owns the other half as a joint tenant. But wait, joint tenancy requires all four unities (time, title, interest, possession). If the friend conveyed his interest to the bank, does that sever the joint tenancy? Because now the bank and the co-worker would be tenants in common, not joint tenants.

Ah, wait, that's a key point. When a joint tenant mortgages their interest, does that sever the joint tenancy? Because the mortgage conveys an interest to the bank, which might disrupt the unities. So if the friend's mortgage to the bank severs the joint tenancy, then the co-worker and the friend would become tenants in common, each owning a 50% interest. But if that's the case, then when the friend dies, his 50% would go to his uncle, not the co-worker. So now the co-worker has their original 50%, and the uncle has 50%, but the friend's 50% is subject to the mortgage.

Wait, but whether a mortgage severs a joint tenancy can depend on the jurisdiction. I think in some places, a mortgage is considered a conveyance that severs the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common. So if that's the case, after the friend mortgages his half, the joint tenancy is severed. So they become tenants in common, each owning 50% as tenants in common.

Then, when the friend dies, his 50% goes to his uncle. The co-worker still owns 50%. But the friend's 50% was mortgaged, so the bank holds the mortgage on that half. So now, the co-worker owns 50% free and clear, and the uncle owns 50% subject to the mortgage. So the title would be split: 50% to the co-worker, 50% to the uncle, with the uncle's 50% subject to the mortgage.

Looking at the answer options, let me check. Option E says half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, both subject to the mortgage. No, because the co-worker's half was never mortgaged. Option G says half co-worker free, half uncle subject. That aligns with what I'm thinking. Option F says co-worker and uncle, but co-worker's portion free and uncle's subject. Wait, option G is exactly that: half co-worker free, half uncle subject.

Wait, but the initial conveyance was to both as joint tenants. If the mortgage severs the joint tenancy, then yes, they become tenants in common. So when the friend dies, his half goes to the uncle, and the co-worker keeps their half. But the friend's half was mortgaged, so the uncle's share is subject to the mortgage.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might hold that a mortgage does not sever the joint tenancy because it's a lien, not an outright transfer. Wait, but in title theory states, the mortgage conveys legal title to the bank. So that would mean the friend no longer holds that half as joint tenant; the bank does. Therefore, the joint tenancy is severed because the friend and the co-worker are no longer holding the same title. Now, the co-worker is a tenant in common with the bank, owning the other half.

Wait, but the friend conveyed his interest to the bank as a mortgage. So after that, the ownership is: the co-worker owns 50% as a joint tenant, and the bank owns 50% as a tenant in common? Or is it that the bank owns 50% and the co-worker owns the other 50% as tenants in common?

Wait, perhaps not. Because initially, both were joint tenants. When the friend mortgages his interest, in a title theory state, he transfers legal title to the bank. So now, the bank owns 50% and the co-worker owns 50% as tenants in common, because the joint tenancy is severed.

So when the friend dies, his interest was already mortgaged, so the bank holds title to his 50%. Therefore, the co-worker owns 50% outright, and the bank owns 50% as mortgagee. But the friend is dead, so the bank's 50% would remain. Wait, but the friend's death doesn't affect the bank's interest because the bank already has title. So the co-worker and the bank each own 50% as tenants in common.

But in this scenario, the friend dies, and the question is about where the title is vested. The friend's 50% was mortgaged to the bank, so upon his death, the co-worker's 50% remains, and the bank's 50% is still with the bank. But wait, the friend's death doesn't change the bank's ownership. So the title would be 50% to the co-worker and 50% to the bank.

But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Bank until mortgage paid, then co-worker and uncle. No, because the friend's share goes to the uncle, but if the mortgage was on the friend's half, perhaps the bank's interest is only on that half.

Option B: Half co-worker and half bank, both subject to mortgage. Well, the co-worker's half wasn't mortgaged, so that's not right.

Option C: Entirely in uncle, subject to mortgage. No, because the co-worker's half is separate.

Option D: Uncle, free and clear. No, because the mortgage is on the friend's half.

Option E: Both co-worker and uncle, each half, both subject. No, because co-worker's half wasn't mortgaged.

Option F: Co-worker and uncle, co-worker's half free, uncle's subject. That could be possible if the joint tenancy wasn't severed, but if it was, the friend's half would go to the uncle, subject to the mortgage.

Option G: Co-worker half free, uncle half subject. That seems right if the mortgage severed the joint tenancy, making them tenants in common, so friend's half goes to uncle, with mortgage.

Option H: Co-worker owns it all, subject to mortgage. No, because the friend's half was mortgaged, and if severed, the co-worker only owns half.

Option I: Co-worker's half subject, uncle's free. That's the opposite of G.

So if the mortgage severs the joint tenancy, then upon the friend's death, the co-worker owns 50% free, and the uncle owns 50% subject to the mortgage. So the title is half co-worker (free) and half uncle (subject). That's option G.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, a mortgage by a joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy because it's considered a temporary interest. So the right of survivorship remains, and the co-worker would take the entire property, but subject to the mortgage on the friend's half. So the co-worker would own the whole property, but the bank's mortgage is still on it. So the title would be entirely with the co-worker, but the property is subject to the mortgage. Wait, but in title theory, the bank holds the legal title to the friend's half. So when the friend dies, the co-worker's right of survivorship would take the friend's half, but the bank already had title to it. So the co-worker would take the interest subject to the bank's title.

Alternatively, maybe the co-worker becomes the sole owner, but the mortgage remains on the property, meaning the bank can foreclose on the entire property if the loan isn't paid. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let's think about it again. If the mortgage is on the friend's half, and the friend dies, the co-worker takes the friend's half via survivorship. But the bank had already taken the title to the friend's half. So does the co-worker's taking of the friend's half through survivorship extinguish the bank's title? Or does the bank still hold title to that half?

I think in title theory, the bank's taking of the title is a conveyance. So when the friend mortgages his half, he conveys it to the bank. So the co-worker and the bank are now tenants in common, each owning 50%. When the friend dies, he doesn't have any interest to pass on because he already conveyed it to the bank. So the co-worker still owns 50%, the bank owns 50%. So the title is 50% co-worker and 50% bank.

Looking at the options, that would correspond to option B: half co-worker and half bank, both subject to mortgage. But wait, the co-worker's half wasn't mortgaged, so it's not subject. The bank's half is the mortgagee, so perhaps the co-worker's half is free.

Wait, no. The bank only holds the friend's half as mortgagee. So the co-worker's half is free, and the friend's half is with the bank. So the title is 50% co-worker (free) and 50% bank (as mortgagee, so when the loan is paid, it goes back). But the options don't have this scenario. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: Bank until paid, then co-worker and uncle. No, because the friend's share was mortgaged, and upon death, it would go to the uncle if the joint tenancy was severed.

Option G: Co-worker 50% free, uncle 50% subject. That's if the joint tenancy was severed, making the friend and co-worker tenants in common, so friend's half goes to uncle, with mortgage.

But earlier I thought that the mortgage to the bank would sever the joint tenancy. So the friend's half goes to the uncle, subject to the mortgage, and the co-worker's half is free.

So that would make option G correct. But wait, in title theory, the mortgage conveys title, so the friend's half is now owned by the bank, not the uncle. Because the friend's interest was mortgaged, so upon his death, he has no interest to leave to the uncle. So the co-worker owns 50%, and the bank owns 50%.

But none of the options directly state that. Let me review the options again.

Option B: half co-worker and half bank, both subject to mortgage. No, because the co-worker's half is free.

Option H: co-worker owns all, but subject to mortgage. No, because the friend's half was mortgaged, so the bank holds that half.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.

1. The professor conveys to friend and co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So they each own 50% as joint tenants.

2. Friend mortgages his 50% to the bank. In a title theory state, the bank gets legal title to friend's 50%.

3. So now, the ownership is: co-worker 50% (joint tenant with friend) and bank 50% (as mortgagee of friend's share). Wait, but does the mortgage sever the joint tenancy? Because the friend no longer holds his 50% as joint tenant; it's now with the bank. So the co-worker is now a tenant in common with the bank, each owning 50%.

4. Friend dies. He had already conveyed his 50% to the bank, so he has no interest to pass to his uncle. Thus, the co-worker owns 50%, and the bank owns 50%.

But the question is about where the title is vested. So the co-worker has 50%, and the bank has 50%.

Looking at the options, none of them seem to match this exactly. The closest would be option B, but that says both halves are subject to the mortgage, which isn't correct because the co-worker's half wasn't mortgaged.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about the severance. Maybe the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy because the mortgage is just a lien, even in title theory states. Wait, in title theory, the mortgage conveys present title to the mortgagee, but perhaps in the context of joint tenancy, the mortgage is seen as encumbering the interest without severing the joint tenancy.

So, if the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, then upon the friend's death, the co-worker takes the entire title by survivorship. But the friend's half was mortgaged, so the bank has a claim on that half. But since the co-worker now owns the entire property, the bank's mortgage would encumber the entire property, because the co-worker's ownership includes the friend's half, which was mortgaged.

But in title theory, the bank holds legal title to the friend's half. So when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the entire title, but the bank still holds the legal title to the friend's half. So the co-worker would have the entire title, but the bank's interest remains on the friend's half. So perhaps the title is entirely with the co-worker, but subject to the mortgage on the friend's half, which is now part of the co-worker's ownership.

Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense. The bank holds the title to the friend's half. So when the friend dies, the co-worker can't take that half because the bank already has it. So the co-worker only takes the co-worker's own half, and the bank keeps the friend's half. Thus, the title is split: 50% co-worker, 50% bank.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the effect of the mortgage in a title theory state on joint tenancy.

Another approach: in a title theory state, the mortgage conveys legal title to the bank, but the mortgagor (friend) retains the equity of redemption. So when
