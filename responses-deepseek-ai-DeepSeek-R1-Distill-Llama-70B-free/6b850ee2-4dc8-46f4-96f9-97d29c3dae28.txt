Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the pOH and the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] of a solution when given the pH at 0 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I remember that pH and pOH are related, but wait, does the temperature affect this relationship?

Wait, I recall that at 25 degrees Celsius, pH + pOH equals 14. But wait, this is at 0°C. Oh right, because water has a different ion product at different temperatures. At lower temperatures, the ion product of water (Kw) decreases. So what's Kw at 0°C?

I think Kw is 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C. At lower temperatures, it's less. Oh right, at 0°C, Kw is about 1.1 x 10^-15 or something like that. Wait, I should probably get the exact value. Let me think. No, wait, maybe I can derive it. Wait, Kw = [H+][OH-]. So if the solution is at a certain pH, I can find [H+], then use Kw at 0°C to find [OH-], and then pOH.

So the given pH is 3.89. So [H+] is 10^-pH, right? So [H+] = 10^-3.89. Let me calculate that. Let me see, 10^-3 is 0.001, 10^-4 is 0.0001. 3.89 is between 3 and 4. Let me think, 10^-3.89 is approximately 1.29 x 10^-4. Because 10^-0.89 is about 0.129, so 0.129 * 10^-3 = 1.29e-4 M.

Now, at 0°C, Kw is 1.1 x 10^-15. So [OH-] = Kw / [H+]. Plugging in the numbers: 1.1e-15 / 1.29e-4. Let me compute that. 1.1 / 1.29 is approximately 0.852. Then 10^-15 / 10^-4 is 10^-11. So 0.852e-11, which is about 8.52 x 10^-12 M. So [OH-] is roughly 8.5e-12.

Wait, but let me double-check the Kw value. I think I might have made a mistake there. I remember that at 0°C, pure water has a pH of about 7.5, so pOH is also 7.5, making Kw = 10^-7.5 squared? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Kw is [H+][OH-] = (1e-7.5)^2. Because pH = pOH = 7.5 at 0°C for pure water. So 1e-7.5 is about 3.16e-8, so squared is about 1e-15. Wait, but 7.5 * 2 is 15, so 1e-15. So Kw at 0°C is 1.0e-15? Hmm, but I thought earlier it was 1.1e-15. Maybe I should confirm. Alternatively, maybe it's 1.14e-15 at 0°C. Or perhaps I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the value I have.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. At 25°C, Kw is 1e-14. At 0°C, it's lower, perhaps around 1.1e-15. So I'll go with 1.1e-15.

So using that, [OH-] = 1.1e-15 / [H+] which is 1.29e-4. So that's 1.1e-15 / 1.29e-4. Let me calculate that.

1.1 divided by 1.29 is approximately 0.852. Then, 1e-15 / 1e-4 is 1e-11. So 0.852e-11 is 8.52e-12. So [OH-] is about 8.5e-12 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is pOH=11.05, [OH-]=8.9e-12. Option F is pOH=12.05, [OH-]=8.9e-13. So my calculation for [OH-] is about 8.5e-12, which is close to option E.

Wait, but wait, what about pOH? pOH is -log[OH-]. So if [OH-] is 8.5e-12, then pOH would be -log(8.5e-12). Let me compute that. Log(8.5) is about 0.929, so log(8.5e-12) is 0.929 -12 = -11.071. So pOH is 11.071, approximately 11.07. So pOH is about 11.07.

So looking at the options, option E says pOH=11.05, [OH-]=8.9e-12. That's very close to my calculation. So option E seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I use the correct Kw? Because at 0°C, Kw is 1.1e-15, right? Or perhaps 1.0e-15? Let me recalculate with Kw=1.0e-15.

So [OH-] = 1e-15 / 1.29e-4 = (1 / 1.29) * 1e-11. 1/1.29 is about 0.775, so 0.775e-11 = 7.75e-12. Hmm, that's about 7.75e-12. Then pOH would be -log(7.75e-12). Log(7.75) is about 0.89, so pOH is 11.11.

Wait, but none of the options have pOH=11.11. Let me look again. Option D has pOH=11.89, [OH-]=1.3e-12. Option E is pOH=11.05.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for [H+]. pH is 3.89. So [H+] = 10^(-3.89) = 10^(-4 + 0.11) = 1e-4 * 10^(-0.11). What's 10^-0.11? Let me calculate that. 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 10^-0.1 is about 0.794. Hmm, 0.11 is a bit more. Let me approximate. Maybe 0.77? Let's see, 10^(-0.11) ≈ 0.775? So 1e-4 * 0.775 = 7.75e-5. Wait, wait, wait, pH is 3.89, which is 3 + 0.89. So 10^-3.89 = 10^-3 * 10^-0.89.

10^-0.89: Let me calculate that more accurately. Let's see, log(8)=0.903, so 10^(-0.903)=8e-1. So 10^-0.89 is a bit higher than 8e-1, say approximately 0.129. Wait no, 10^0.89 is about 7.76, so 10^-0.89 is 1/7.76 ≈ 0.1288. So 1e-3 * 0.1288 = 1.288e-4. So [H+] is 1.288e-4 M.

Then, [OH-] = Kw / [H+]. At 0°C, Kw is 1.1e-15.

So [OH-] = (1.1e-15) / (1.288e-4) = (1.1 / 1.288) * 1e-11.

1.1 / 1.288 is approximately 0.854. So [OH-] ≈ 0.854e-11 = 8.54e-12 M.

Then pOH is -log(8.54e-12). Let's compute that.

log(8.54) is approx 0.933. So log(8.54e-12) is 0.933 -12 = -11.067. So pOH is 11.067, approximately 11.07.

Looking at the options, option E is pOH=11.05, [OH-]=8.9e-12. That's very close to my calculation. But wait, my [OH-] is 8.5e-12, option E has 8.9e-12. Hmm. Let me check the calculation again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, Kw at 0°C: I think I might have the wrong Kw. Let me think again. I might have confused it with another temperature. Let me look up Kw at 0°C in my memory. Oh yeah, I think I was wrong earlier. At 0°C, Kw is approximately 1.14 × 10^-15. So let's recalculate with that.

So [OH-] = (1.14e-15) / (1.288e-4) = (1.14 / 1.288) * 1e-11.

1.14 / 1.288 is approx 0.885. So [OH-] = 0.885e-11 = 8.85e-12. So [OH-] is approximately 8.85e-12 M. Then pOH is -log(8.85e-12) = log(8.85) is about 0.947, so pOH = 11.053, which is about 11.05. So that matches option E exactly: pOH=11.05, [OH-]=8.9e-12. So option E must be correct.

Wait, but why is option E's [OH-] 8.9e-12 while my calculation is 8.85e-12? Oh, maybe because of rounding. 8.85 is approximately 8.9, so that's probably why.

So the correct option should be E: pOH=11.05, [OH-]=8.9e-12.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the pOH and [OH-] of a solution with a given pH of 3.89 at 0°C. 

1. **Relationship Between pH and pOH**:  
   At 25°C, the relationship pH + pOH = 14 holds. However, at 0°C, the ion product of water, \( K_w \), decreases. For this calculation, \( K_w \) at 0°C is taken as \( 1.14 \times 10^{-15} \).

2. **Calculate [H+]**:  
   The hydrogen ion concentration \([H^+]\) is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}
   \]  
   Substituting the given pH:  
   \[
   [H^+] = 10^{-3.89} \approx 1.288 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
   \]

3. **Calculate [OH-]**:  
   Using the relationship \( K_w = [H^+][OH^-] \), we solve for \([OH^-]\):  
   \[
   [OH^-] = \frac{K_w}{[H^+]} = \frac{1.14 \times 10^{-15}}{1.288 \times 10^{-4}}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   [OH^-] \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Calculate pOH**:  
   The pOH is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-]
   \]  
   Substituting \([OH^-] \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12}\):  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log(8.85 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 11.05
   \]

5. **Match with Options**:  
   Comparing the calculated values with the given options:  
   - **Option E**: \( \text{pOH} = 11.05 \), \([OH^-] = 8.9 \times 10^{-12}\)  
   This matches closely with the calculated values, considering rounding differences.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option E**: \( \text{pOH} = 11.05 \), \([OH^-] = 8.9 \times 10^{-12}\).

**Answer: E**
