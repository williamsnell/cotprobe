Okay, so I've got this physics problem about gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives me the masses of Earth and the Moon. Earth's mass is 5.97x10^24 kg, and the Moon's is 7.35x10^22 kg. The average distance between them is 3.84x10^5 km. Wait, I remember that the gravitational force formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/r². Oh right, G is the gravitational constant. I think G is 6.674x10^-11 N(m/kg)² or something like that.

Wait, the distance is given in kilometers, but I need it in meters because the units for G are in meters. So I should convert 3.84x10^5 km to meters. Oh yeah, 1 km is 1000 meters, so multiplying by 1000. Let me calculate that: 3.84e5 km * 1e3 m/km = 3.84e8 meters. Right, so r is 3.84x10^8 meters.

Now, plugging all the numbers into the formula. F = G * (M_earth * M_moon) / r².

Let me write down the numbers:

G = 6.674e-11 N(m²/kg²)
M_earth = 5.97e24 kg
M_moon = 7.35e22 kg
r = 3.84e8 m

So F = (6.674e-11) * (5.97e24 * 7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

First, the product of the masses: 5.97e24 * 7.35e22. Let me multiply the coefficients first: 5.97 * 7.35. Hmm, 5 * 7 is 35, 0.97*7 is about 6.79, so 5.97*7 is about 41.79. Then 5.97 *0.35 is about 2.09. So roughly, 41.79 + 2.09 is around 43.88. Wait, or maybe I should just calculate it accurately. Let me do 5.97 *7.35.

5.97 * 7 = 41.79, 5.97 * 0.35 = approx 2.09. So 41.79 + 2.09 = 43.88. So the product is 43.88e(24+22) = 43.88e46. Wait, 5.97e24 is 10^24, 7.35e22 is 10^22, so when multiplied, the exponents add: 24+22=46. So 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) *1e46 = let's compute 5.97 *7.35.

Wait, perhaps more accurately. 5.97 *7 =41.79, 5.97 *0.35=2.0845. So total is 43.8745. So 43.8745e46 kg².

Now, multiplying by G. G is 6.674e-11, so (6.674e-11) * (43.8745e46) = let's compute the coefficients and exponents.

6.674 *43.8745 is approximately... Let me compute 6.674 *40=266.96, 6.674 *3.8745 is about 6.674*3=20.022, 6.674*0.8745≈5.83, so total around 20.022+5.83=25.85. So 266.96 +25.85≈292.81. So the coefficient is about 292.81. The exponent is 1e(-11 +46) =1e35. So numerator becomes 292.81e35.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. Because 43.8745e46 is 4.38745e47, right? Because 43.8745 is 4.38745 x10^1, so 43.8745e46 =4.38745e47. So when multiplied by 6.674e-11, we get (6.674 *4.38745) x 10^(-11+47) = let's compute that.

6.674 *4.38745. Let me compute 6 *4=24, 6*0.38745≈2.3247, 0.674 *4≈2.696, 0.674 *0.38745≈0.261. Adding all: 24 +2.3247=26.3247 +2.696=28.0207 +0.261≈28.2817. So approximately 28.2817. So 28.2817 x10^(36). Because exponents: -11 +47 is 36. So numerator is 2.82817e37.

Wait, no. Because 6.674e-11 *43.8745e46 =6.674 *43.8745 = let's calculate that accurately. 6 *43.8745 is 263.247, 0.674 *43.8745. Let's compute 0.6 *43.8745 =26.3247, 0.074 *43.8745≈3.246. So 26.3247 +3.246 =29.5707. So total is 263.247 +29.5707=292.8177. So 292.8177e( -11 + 24+22) )= 292.8177e35.

Wait, because the exponents are: 5.97e24 is 1e24, 7.35e22 is 1e22. So 1e24 *1e22 =1e46. Then G is 1e-11. So when multiplied, 1e-11 *1e46 =1e35. So yes, the product is 292.8177e35 N m²/kg²? Wait, no, the units: G is N(m/kg)^2, but I think I'm mixing up. But anyway, proceeding with the numbers.

Now the denominator: r² = (3.84e8 m)^2. So 3.84 squared is about 14.7456, and (1e8)^2 is 1e16. So 14.7456e16 m², which is 1.47456e17 m².

So putting it all together, F = numerator / denominator = (292.8177e35) / (1.47456e17) ) = (292.8177 / 1.47456) * 1e(35-17) = let's compute 292.8177 /1.47456.

Hmm, 292 divided by 1.47456 is approximately 198, because 1.47456 * 200 is about 294.912, which is a bit more than 292. So maybe around 198. Let me compute 1.47456 *198 = ?

1.47456 *200=294.912. Subtract 1.47456 *2=2.94912 → 294.912-2.94912=291.96288. Oh, that's close to 292. So 198 gives us about 291.96, which is 292. So 198. So then, 292.8177 / 1.47456 ≈198. So the coefficient is approximately 198, and the exponent is 1e(35-17)=1e18.

So F ≈198e18 N. Wait, that's 1.98e20 N. Because 198e18 is 1.98 x10^2 *1e18 =1.98e20.

Wait, but I thought the options were all around 2, like 1.92 to 2.15. So 1.98e20 N would mean X is 1.98, which is option G: 1.99, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division. Let me recalculate 292.8177 /1.47456.

Alternatively, let me compute 292.8177 ÷ 1.47456.

Let me try a more precise approach. Let's compute 1.47456 * 198 = ?

1.47456 *200 = 294.912.

Subtract 1.47456 *2 =2.94912 → 294.912 -2.94912 = 291.96288.

So 198 → 291.96288. Our numerator is 292.8177, which is 292.8177-291.96288=0.85482 higher.

So how much more than 198 do we need? Let's find how much 0.85482 is in terms of 1.47456.

0.85482 /1.47456 ≈0.58.

So approximately, 198.58.

So 198.58 → so 292.8177 /1.47456 ≈198.58.

So F =198.58e18 N =1.9858e20 N.

Which is approximately 1.986e20 N. So X is 1.986, which is approximately 1.99. Looking at the options, option G is 1.99.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes these approximations can be a bit off. Maybe I should do more precise steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each part more accurately.

Let me recompute the numerator:

G * M_e * M_m =6.674e-11 *5.97e24 *7.35e22.

First, multiply 5.97e24 and 7.35e22:

5.97 *7.35 = let me compute this accurately.

5 *7=35, 5 *0.35=1.75, 0.97 *7=6.79, 0.97 *0.35=0.3395.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 5.97 *7.35.

Let me write it as:

5.97
*7.35
= ?

Multiply 5.97 by 7.35.

5.97 *7 =41.79

5.97 *0.3=1.791

5.97 *0.05=0.2985

Adding them: 41.79 +1.791=43.581 +0.2985=43.8795.

So 5.97 *7.35=43.8795.

So 5.97e24 *7.35e22 =43.8795e46 kg².

Multiply by G=6.674e-11:

43.8795e46 *6.674e-11 = (43.8795 *6.674) *1e(46-11) = 292.686e35.

Wait, 43.8795 *6.674. Let me compute that.

43 *6=258, 43*0.674≈29.  So 43*6.674=286.6 (exact? Wait, 43*6=258, 43*0.674= (40*0.674)+(3*0.674)=26.96+2.022=28.982. So 258+28.982=286.982. Then 0.8795 *6.674: 0.8*6.674=5.3392, 0.0795*6.674≈0.5306. So total ≈5.3392+0.5306=5.8698. So total 286.982 +5.8698=292.8518.

So 292.8518e35.

Now, denominator: r²=(3.84e8)^2.

Compute 3.84 squared: 3.84 *3.84.

3 *3=9, 3*.84=2.52, .84*3=2.52, .84*.84=0.7056. So:

(3 +0.84)^2 =9 + 2*(3*0.84) +0.84².

=9 + 5.04 + 0.7056=14.7456.

So 3.84e8 squared is 14.7456e16, which is 1.47456e17 m².

So F = 292.8518e35 / 1.47456e17.

Let me write that as (292.8518 /1.47456) *1e(35-17)= (292.8518 /1.47456) *1e18.

Compute 292.8518 ÷1.47456.

Let me do this division more accurately. Let's see:

1.47456 × 198 = ?

We can compute 1.47456 × 200 =294.912.

Subtract 1.47456 ×2=2.94912. So 294.912-2.94912=291.96288.

So 198 gives 291.96288, which is less than 292.8518 by 292.8518 -291.96288=0.88892.

So how much more than 198 do we need? Let me find how many times 1.47456 fits into 0.88892.

0.88892 ÷1.47456 ≈0.88892 /1.47456 ≈0.6025.

So approximately 198.6025.

So F ≈198.6025e18 N =1.986e20 N.

So X is 1.986, which is approximately 1.99. So looking at the options, option G is 1.99.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if I missed any exponents. Because 198.6e18 is 1.986e20, right?

Yes, because 198.6e18 =1.986 x10^2 *1e18=1.986e20.

So X is approximately 1.986, which is very close to 1.99.

Looking back at the options:

A:1.92

B:2.00

C:2.10

D:1.85

E:1.80

F:2.15

G:1.99

H:1.75

I:2.08

J:2.05

So the closest is option G:1.99.

To calculate the gravitational force \( F \) exerted by Earth on the Moon, we use the formula:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{M_{\text{Earth}} \cdot M_{\text{Moon}}}{r^2}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)
- \( M_{\text{Earth}} = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( M_{\text{Moon}} = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( r = 3.84 \times 10^5 \, \text{km} = 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 1: Compute the product of the masses
\[
M_{\text{Earth}} \cdot M_{\text{Moon}} = (5.97 \times 10^{24}) \cdot (7.35 \times 10^{22}) = 43.8795 \times 10^{46} \, \text{kg}^2
\]

### Step 2: Multiply by \( G \)
\[
G \cdot (M_{\text{Earth}} \cdot M_{\text{Moon}}) = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (43.8795 \times 10^{46}) = 292.8518 \times 10^{35} \, \text{N·m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = (3.84 \times 10^8)^2 = 14.7456 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 = 1.47456 \times 10^{17} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 4: Divide the results
\[
F = \frac{292.8518 \times 10^{35}}{1.47456 \times 10^{17}} = (292.8518 / 1.47456) \times 10^{18} \, \text{N}
\]

Performing the division:
\[
292.8518 / 1.47456 \approx 198.6
\]

Thus:
\[
F \approx 198.6 \times 10^{18} \, \text{N} = 1.986 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 5: Determine \( X \)
The force is given as \( X \times 10^{20} \, \text{N} \). Comparing:
\[
X = 1.986
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \( X = 1.986 \) is **G: 1.99**.
