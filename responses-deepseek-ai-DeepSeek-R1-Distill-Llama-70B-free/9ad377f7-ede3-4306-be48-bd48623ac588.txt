Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about the chemical potentials of water and ethanol in a mixture. 

So, the setup is a mixture of water and ethanol with a mole fraction of water being 0.60. Then, there's a small change in the composition, and this causes the chemical potential of water to increase by 0.25 J/mol. The question is, how much does the chemical potential of ethanol change? The options are from A to J.

Hmm. I remember that in thermodynamics, especially when dealing with mixtures, the Gibbs-Duhem equation comes into play. The Gibbs-Duhem equation relates the changes in the chemical potentials of the components in a mixture. 

Wait, what's the Gibbs-Duhem equation again? I think it's something like the sum of the mole fractions times the differential of each component's chemical potential equals zero. Or maybe it's the sum of the moles times the differentials? Let me think. Oh right, the Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of chemical potentials for a binary solution. Since it's a binary mixture (water and ethanol), the equation simplifies.

So for a binary mixture, the equation would be something like:
x_water * dμ_water + x_ethanol * dμ_ethanol = 0
Because the sum of the mole fractions is 1, right? So if I know the change in chemical potential for one component, I can find the change for the other.

Wait, but wait. The equation should involve the mole fractions and the changes in chemical potentials. Let me get the exact form. I think it's:
n_water dμ_water + n_ethanol dμ_ethanol = 0
But considering that in a mixture, the total number of moles is n_total = n_water + n_ethanol. However, since we're dealing with mole fractions, x_water = n_water / n_total and x_ethanol = n_ethanol / n_total. So if I multiply both sides by 1/n_total, I get:
x_water dμ_water + x_ethanol dμ_ethanol = 0
Yes, that makes sense. So the equation should be x1 dμ1 + x2 dμ2 =0.

In this problem, the mole fraction of water (x1) is 0.6, so the mole fraction of ethanol (x2) must be 0.4 because 0.6 + 0.4 =1.

Given that dμ_water is 0.25 J/mol. We're looking for dμ_ethanol.

So plugging into the equation:
(0.6)(0.25) + (0.4)(dμ_ethanol) = 0
Wait, no. Wait, the equation is x_water * dμ_water + x_ethanol * dμ_ethanol =0. So:

0.6 * (0.25) + 0.4 * (dμ_ethanol) = 0

Let me calculate 0.6 * 0.25. 0.6 times 0.25 is 0.15. So:

0.15 + 0.4 * (dμ_ethanol) = 0

So solving for dμ_ethanol:
0.4 * dμ_ethanol = -0.15
dμ_ethanol = (-0.15)/0.4
Which is -0.375 J/mol. Wait, -0.375 is -3/8, which is -0.375. But looking at the options, I don't see an option with -0.375. Let me check the options again.

The options are:
A: 0.15
B: -0.15
C: 0.60
D: 0.25
E: -0.25
F: 0.38
G: -0.20
H: -0.75
I: -0.38
J: -0.60

Oh wait, option I is -0.38, which is approximately -0.375 if we consider significant figures. So maybe that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate:
0.6 * 0.25 = 0.15
So 0.15 + 0.4 * dμ_ethanol =0
0.4 * dμ_ethanol = -0.15
So dμ_ethanol = -0.15 / 0.4 = -0.375 J/mol.

Yes, that's correct. So the change is -0.375, which is -3/8, or -0.375. The closest option is I: -0.38, but wait, 0.375 is 3/8, which is exactly 0.375. So perhaps the options have rounded. Alternatively, did I use the right equation?

Wait, another thought: maybe the Gibbs-Duhem equation is written in terms of the total number of moles. Let me think. Another version of the Gibbs-Duhem equation is:

sum (n_i dμ_i) =0

In a binary solution, n_water dμ_water + n_ethanol dμ_ethanol =0.

But since mole fractions are x_i = n_i / n_total, we can write:

n_total [x_water dμ_water + x_ethanol dμ_ethanol] = 0.

Which brings us back to x_water dμ_water + x_ethanol dμ_ethanol =0. So the same equation holds.

So my calculation should be correct, leading to dμ_ethanol = -0.375 J/mol. But in the options, the closest is I: -0.38. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the equation.

Wait, another approach: for an ideal solution, the chemical potential is μ_i = μ_i^* + RT ln x_i. So if the mole fraction changes by dx_i, the change in chemical potential would be dμ_i = RT (dx_i / x_i).

But in a binary solution, if the mole fraction of water increases by dx, the mole fraction of ethanol decreases by dx (since x_water + x_ethanol =1).

Wait, but in this problem, the change in composition is small, so we can use differentials. Let me think.

Suppose the mole fraction of water changes by d x_water = dx. Then the mole fraction of ethanol changes by d x_ethanol = -dx.

The change in chemical potential for water is dμ_water = RT (d x_water / x_water).

Similarly, for ethanol, dμ_ethanol = RT (d x_ethanol / x_ethanol) ) = RT (-dx / x_ethanol).

So the ratio of dμ_water to dμ_ethanol would be (x_ethanol / x_water) * (-1). Because:

dμ_water = RT (dx / x_water)
dμ_ethanol = RT (-dx / x_ethanol)

So dμ_ethanol = - (x_water / x_ethanol) * dμ_water.

Wait, let me write that:

dμ_ethanol = -(x_water / x_ethanol) * dμ_water.

Because from the above expressions:

dμ_water = RT (dx / x_water) => dx = (dμ_water x_water) / RT.

dμ_ethanol = RT (-dx / x_ethanol) = - RT ( (dμ_water x_water)/(RT x_ethanol) ) = - dμ_water (x_water / x_ethanol).

So yes, dμ_ethanol = - (x_water / x_ethanol) * dμ_water.

Given that, x_water is 0.6, x_ethanol is 0.4.

Plugging in, dμ_ethanol = -(0.6 / 0.4) * 0.25 J/mol.

0.6 / 0.4 is 1.5. So 1.5 * 0.25 = 0.375. So dμ_ethanol = -0.375 J/mol, which matches the earlier calculation.

So the change in ethanol's chemical potential is -0.375 J/mol, which is approximately -0.38 J/mol. So the correct option is I: -0.38 J/mol^-1.

Looking back at the options, option I is -0.38, which matches.

To solve the problem, we use the Gibbs-Duhem equation, which for a binary mixture simplifies to:

\[
x_{\text{water}} \, d\mu_{\text{water}} + x_{\text{ethanol}} \, d\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = 0
\]

Here, \(x_{\text{water}} = 0.60\) and \(x_{\text{ethanol}} = 0.40\). The change in the chemical potential of water is given as \(d\mu_{\text{water}} = 0.25 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}\). Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
(0.60)(0.25) + (0.40)(d\mu_{\text{ethanol}}) = 0
\]

First, calculate \(0.60 \times 0.25 = 0.15\). The equation becomes:

\[
0.15 + 0.40 \, d\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = 0
\]

Solving for \(d\mu_{\text{ethanol}}\):

\[
0.40 \, d\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = -0.15
\]

\[
d\mu_{\text{ethanol}} = \frac{-0.15}{0.40} = -0.375 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}
\]

The closest option to \(-0.375 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}\) is \(-0.38 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}\), which corresponds to option I.

Thus, the chemical potential of ethanol changes by \(-0.38 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}\).
