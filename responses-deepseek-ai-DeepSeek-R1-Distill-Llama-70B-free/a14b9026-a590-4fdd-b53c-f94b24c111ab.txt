Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the energy of a photon, specifically green light with a given frequency. Hmm, I remember that the energy of a photon is calculated using a formula involving Planck's constant. Let me think... Oh right, the formula is E = h * f. 

Wait, what's h? Oh yeah, Planck's constant, which I think is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 joule-seconds. And f is the frequency, which is given here as 6 x 10^14 vibrations per second, or Hz. So I need to multiply these two numbers together.

Let me write that down. E = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6e14 Hz. Oh wait, because when you multiply by Hz (which is 1/s), the seconds unit cancels out, leaving just joules, which is what we want for energy.

So doing the math: 6.626 times 6 is... let's see, 6 times 6 is 36, but 6.626 is a little more than 6. So 6.626 *6 = 39.756. Then, the exponents: 10^-34 multiplied by 10^14 is 10^(-34+14) = 10^-20. 

So putting it together, the energy E should be approximately 39.756e-20 joules. Wait, but 39.756e-20 can be written as 3.9756e-19 joules. Looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A is 7.5e-20, which is smaller. Option B is 4.8e-19, which is about half of what I got. Option C is 8e-19, which is higher. Option D is 2e-18, way higher. Option E is 3.98e-19, which is very close to my 3.9756e-19. Option F is 2.5e-19, lower. Option G is the same as the frequency, so that's not it. H is 1.2e-19, lower. I is 5.5e-34, which seems too small and the exponent is way off. J is 6.63e-34, which looks like Planck's constant, but that's not the energy.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Oh wait, 6.626 multiplied by 6 is indeed 39.756. But 39.756e-20 is the same as 3.9756e-19. So that rounds to about 3.98e-19, which is option E.

Alternatively, sometimes people approximate Planck's constant as 6.63e-34 for simpler calculations. Let me try that. 6.63e-34 *6e14 = 6.63*6 = 39.78, same as before. So again, 3.978e-19, which is still closest to option E.

Looking at the options again, option E is 3.98e-19, which matches perfectly. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the energy of a photon of green light with a frequency of \( f = 6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \), we use the formula for the energy of a photon:

\[
E = h \cdot f
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, approximately \( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Substituting the values:

\[
E = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6 \times 10^{14})
\]

First, multiply the coefficients:

\[
6.626 \cdot 6 = 39.756
\]

Next, add the exponents of 10:

\[
10^{-34} \cdot 10^{14} = 10^{-20}
\]

Thus, the energy is:

\[
E = 39.756 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} = 3.9756 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

This value rounds to \( 3.98 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which matches option E. The other options are either too high, too low, or represent different quantities altogether.

Answer: E
