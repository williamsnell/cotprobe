D: The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.
E: The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.
F: Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.
G: The initial letter from the man was not a formal offer to sell.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about whether a contract was formed between a man and a woman regarding the sale of a motorcycle, and what defense the man could use if the woman sues him for breach.

Alright, let's break down the scenario. The man sent a letter to the woman offering to sell his motorcycle for $1,000. Then she faxed back saying the price was a bit high and offered $800. He responded by fax saying he wouldn't accept $800. The next day, she called and said she'd pay the full $1,000, but he refused to sell. Now, she's suing, so she's claiming there was a contract.

I remember that contract formation requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. The man's letter was an offer. When the woman faxed back with $800, that's a counteroffer, right? A counteroffer has the effect of rejecting the original offer and making a new offer. So when she offered $800, she was rejecting the $1,000 offer and proposing a new deal. 

Then the man responded, saying he wouldn't accept $800. I think that's a rejection of her counteroffer. So the original offer is off the table because she rejected it with her counter, and then he rejected her counter. So, no contract yet.

The next day, she called and agreed to the original $1,000. But by then, can she still accept the original offer? Because the original offer was revoked when she made the counteroffer. Wait, or was it? Let me think. When she made the counteroffer, she rejected the original, so the original offer is no longer open. Unless the offer allows for it, like if it's an option contract, but there's no indication of that here.

So when she tried to accept the next day, the original offer was already revoked by her counteroffer. Therefore, her attempt to accept was too late because the offer had been revoked. So there's no contract, meaning the man didn't breach any contract.

Looking at the options, I need to find which defense aligns with this reasoning. Let's go through them.

Option A: The man had the right to change his mind about the sale at any time. Well, the man did change his mind, but the issue is whether a contract was formed. This option is about the man's right, but it's more about whether there was an existing contract to breach. This might not be the best defense because it's more about the man's action after the fact, not whether a contract existed.

Option B: The woman didn't respond timely. I'm not sure about the timely manner part. The woman responded quickly, same day or next? The key is that her acceptance was after the offer was revoked, not necessarily about timing. So this might not be the best fit.

Option C: The man's refusal wasn't in writing. I don't think the method of communication matters here unless it's required by the statute of frauds. But the motorcycle might not fall under that since it's a good under the UCC, and the SOF usually requires contracts for goods over $500 to be in writing. Wait, the man's offer was in writing, but the woman's acceptance was oral. But the question is about the revocation, not the form. So maybe this isn't the right defense.

Option D: The woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance. That sounds right. Because when she made the counteroffer, she rejected the original offer, so she can't accept it later. This would mean that when she tried to accept the next day, the offer was no longer there.

Option E: The man's rejection of the counteroffer terminated her power. Wait, no. The man rejecting her counteroffer would mean her counteroffer was rejected, but that wouldn't necessarily bring back the original offer. The original offer was already terminated when she made the counter. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: The acceptance was oral, different mode. The original offer was by letter (written), and she accepted orally. But I think the mode of acceptance is usually okay unless specified otherwise. So the offer didn't say it had to be in writing, so oral acceptance should be fine. So F isn't the issue here.

Option G: The initial letter wasn't a formal offer. The letter was an offer, so this doesn't make sense. Unless the letter was an invitation to treat, but in the US, an offer is usually clear. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Contract unenforceable under SOF because oral acceptance. The statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing. For goods over $500, yes. But the woman's acceptance was oral, which might not satisfy SOF. But wait, the man's offer was in writing, and he's the one who would need to have the acceptance in writing if required. But I'm a bit confused here. If the contract is for a motorcycle (a good), then under UCC ยง 2-201, contracts for goods over $500 need to be in writing. But the woman's acceptance was oral, so if the contract wasn't in writing, it can't be enforced. However, the man is the one being sued for breach. Wait, but if there's no contract because of SOF, then there's no breach. So H is a possible defense. Hmm, but earlier I thought D was better. Let me think again.

Wait, in the scenario, the woman tried to accept after the offer was revoked. So even if her acceptance was oral, the main issue is that the offer was no longer open. So H would be a defense regardless of revocation, but maybe the answer is based on revocation. Alternatively, H might not apply because the man's offer was in writing. Wait, the SOF requires that the contract be in writing, so if the acceptance was oral, the contract can't be enforced. But the man's offer was in writing, so maybe that's enough? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Option I: Her initial refusal voided the contract. No, because there was no contract at that point. So I is incorrect.

So now I'm torn between D and H. Let me clarify the rules. When an offeree makes a counteroffer, it's a rejection of the original offer and a new offer. So the original offer is terminated. So when she made the $800 offer, the $1,000 offer was off the table. Then the man rejected her $800, so her counteroffer was rejected. So when she tried to accept the $1,000 again, there was no offer left to accept. So the defense would be that her counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance. That's option D.

Alternatively, if the statute of frauds applies because the motorcycle is a good over $500, and the acceptance was oral, then the contract isn't enforceable. But the initial offer was in writing, but the acceptance was oral. So under UCC 2-201(1), a contract for goods over $500 isn't enforceable unless there's a writing. However, the writing must be sufficient, and the man's offer was in writing, but the woman's acceptance was oral. So the contract would not satisfy the SOF because the acceptance wasn't in writing. So option H would say the contract is unenforceable because her acceptance was oral. But wait, the man is the one who made the offer. So the SOF requires that the contract be in writing, which includes the acceptance. So without a written acceptance, there's no contract. 

But in this case, the woman's acceptance was oral, so even if she tried to accept, it's not in writing, making the contract unenforceable. So H could be a valid defense. But wait, the first issue is whether a contract was formed. If her acceptance was oral and the contract is within the SOF, then no contract was formed, so no breach. That's a possible defense.

But wait, the man's offer was in writing. Let me think again about the SOF. The statute of frauds requires that the contract be in writing. If the parties' agreement consists of writings, like the man's offer and the woman's written acceptance, but here the woman accepted orally. So if the contract needs to be in writing, and the only writing is the offer, but the acceptance is oral, then the contract isn't in writing. So H would be a good defense because the acceptance wasn't in writing, making the contract unenforceable.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the options again. The key is whether a contract was formed. If the woman's counteroffer terminated the original offer, then when she tried to accept, there was no offer to accept, so no contract. That's option D. Alternatively, if the acceptance was oral, then under SOF, no contract, so H is the defense.

Which one is the better defense? The facts say that the woman's fax was a counteroffer, which terminated the original offer. Then she accepted the next day, but the offer was already revoked. So D is about the termination of the offer due to her counteroffer.

Alternatively, H is about the SOF. But the motorcycle is a good, so the SOF applies. The contract price is $1,000, so it's over $500. Therefore, the contract must be in writing. The man's offer was in writing, but the woman's acceptance was oral, so the contract isn't in writing. Therefore, the contract is unenforceable under the SOF, which would be a defense.

So which is the better answer? The man's best defense would be either D or H.

Wait, but the man's offer was in writing, so the woman's oral acceptance wouldn't satisfy the SOF. Therefore, H would be a valid defense. But if the woman's acceptance was after the offer was revoked, then the contract wasn't formed regardless of the SOF.

Hmm. So which is the primary reason here? The sequence of events is:

1. Offer by man in writing.

2. Woman rejects with a counteroffer (fax).

3. Man rejects the counteroffer.

4. Woman tries to accept the original offer orally.

So the original offer was revoked by the woman's counteroffer, so when she tried to accept, there was no offer left. So D is the correct defense.

Yes, because the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance. So D is the best defense.

The question revolves around whether a contract was formed between the man and the woman regarding the sale of a motorcycle and what defense the man could use if the woman sues him for breach. The key issue is whether the woman's attempted acceptance of the original offer was valid after she made a counteroffer.

1. **Initial Offer**: The man sent a written offer to sell the motorcycle for $1,000. This constitutes a valid offer.

2. **Counteroffer**: The woman responded with a fax stating, "The price is a little high, I'll give you $800." This was a counteroffer, which rejected the original offer and proposed new terms. Under contract law, a counteroffer terminates the original offer, meaning the original offer is no longer available for acceptance.

3. **Rejection of Counteroffer**: The man responded by fax, stating, "I will not accept $800," which rejected the woman's counteroffer. At this point, there was no existing offer for the woman to accept.

4. **Attempted Acceptance**: The next day, the woman called and said, "I changed my mind, I will pay $1,000 for the motorcycle." However, by this time, the original offer had already been revoked by her counteroffer. Therefore, her attempted acceptance was too late, as there was no offer left to accept.

**Analysis of Options**:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The issue is not whether the man could change his mind but whether a contract was formed. The man's refusal to sell was based on the absence of a valid contract.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The timing of the woman's response is not the issue; the problem is that her acceptance came after the offer was revoked.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The method of communication (written or oral) is not the central issue here.
- **Option D**: Correct. The woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance of the original offer. Once she made the counteroffer, the original offer was no longer available for her to accept.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The man's rejection of the woman's counteroffer did not terminate her power of acceptance; her power of acceptance was already terminated when she made the counteroffer.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The mode of acceptance (oral or written) is not the issue here, as the original offer did not specify that acceptance had to be in writing.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The initial letter was a valid offer, so this option is not applicable.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While the statute of frauds requires contracts for goods over $500 to be in writing, the key issue here is that the woman's counteroffer revoked the original offer, making her subsequent acceptance invalid regardless of the statute of frauds.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The woman's initial refusal to pay the full price did not void a contract, as no contract had been formed at that point.

**Conclusion**: The woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance of the original offer. When she tried to accept the original offer the next day, there was no offer left to accept. Therefore, the man's best defense is that the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance.
