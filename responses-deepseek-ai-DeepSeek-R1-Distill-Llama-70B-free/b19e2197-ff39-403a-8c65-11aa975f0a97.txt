Question:

 Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
M ∨ N
~M · O / N

Options:

A: Valid
B: Invalid. Counterexample when M and O are true and N is false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when M is true and O and N are false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when O is true and M and N are false

Okay, so I need to figure out whether this argument is valid or invalid. The argument is given as:

M ∨ N
~M · O / N

Wait, that slash might mean something else. Oh right, in logic, the slash sometimes represents "therefore" or "entailment". So the argument is saying that M∨N and ~M·O together lead to N. So the premises are M∨N and ~M·O, and the conclusion is N.

Hmm, to check the validity, I should construct a truth table that includes all possible truth values for M, N, and O, and then see if there's any row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. If such a row exists, the argument is invalid, and that row would be a counterexample.

So the variables are M, N, O. Each can be true (T) or false (F). There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

Let me list them all:

1. M=T, N=T, O=T
2. M=T, N=T, O=F
3. M=T, N=F, O=T
4. M=T, N=F, O=F
5. M=F, N=T, O=T
6. M=F, N=T, O=F
7. M=F, N=F, O=T
8. M=F, N=F, O=F

Now, for each row, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

The premises are:
Premise1: M∨N
Premise2: ~M ∧ O

The conclusion is N.

So for each row, compute Premise1, Premise2, and then check if both premises are true, and see if N is true in those cases.

Let's go through each row.

Row 1: M=T, N=T, O=T
Premise1: T∨T = T
Premise2: ~T = F, F ∧ T = F
So both premises are T and F. Wait, no, the premises are both supposed to be true for the argument to hold. So both need to be true. So in this row, Premise2 is F, so this row doesn't satisfy both premises being true.

Row 2: M=T, N=T, O=F
Premise1: T∨T = T
Premise2: ~T = F, F ∧ F = F
Again, Premise2 is F. So premises not both true.

Row3: M=T, N=F, O=T
Premise1: T∨F = T
Premise2: ~T=F, F ∧ T=F
Again, Premise2 is F. So no.

Row4: M=T, N=F, O=F
Premise1: T
Premise2: F
No.

Row5: M=F, N=T, O=T
Premise1: F∨T = T
Premise2: ~F=T, T ∧ T = T
So both premises are true. Now, conclusion is N=T. So in this case, premises are true and conclusion is true. So this row is fine.

Row6: M=F, N=T, O=F
Premise1: T
Premise2: ~F=T, T ∧ F = F
So premise2 is F. Not both true.

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T
Premise1: F∨F = F
Premise2: ~F=T, T ∧ T = T
So Premise1 is F, Premise2 is T. So premises are not both true. So not applicable.

Row8: M=F, N=F, O=F
Premise1: F
Premise2: T ∧ F = F
So premises not both true.

Wait, so the only row where both premises are true is row5. In that case, conclusion N is true. So in all cases where premises are true, conclusion is true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but looking back, I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's look at row7 again: M=F, N=F, O=T.

Premise1: M∨N is F∨F = F.

Premise2: ~M (which is T) ∧ O (T) = T.

So both premises: F and T. So they're not both true. Because for an argument, the premises must both be true. So row7 doesn't satisfy that.

Wait, but what about row5? M=F, N=T, O=T.

Premise1: T.

Premise2: T.

Conclusion: T.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. What if M is F, O is T, and N is F?

Wait, no, in row7, N is F. So that's a case where:

M is F, O is T, N is F.

Then, premise1 is F∨F = F.

Premise2 is T ∧ T = T.

So both premises would require both to be true. So in row7, premise1 is F, so the premises are not both true. So that row doesn't count.

Wait, but the conclusion is N, which is F in row7. But since the premises aren't both true, it's not a counterexample.

So in all cases where both premises are true (only row5), conclusion is true. So the argument is valid.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed a row. Let me check all rows again.

Row1: M=T, N=T, O=T: premise1=T, premise2=F.

Row2: M=T, N=T, O=F: premise1=T, premise2=F.

Row3: M=T, N=F, O=T: premise1=T, premise2=F.

Row4: M=T, N=F, O=F: premise1=T, premise2=F.

Row5: M=F, N=T, O=T: premise1=T, premise2=T. So both premises true, conclusion T.

Row6: M=F, N=T, O=F: premise1=T, premise2=F.

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T: premise1=F, premise2=T.

Row8: M=F, N=F, O=F: premise1=F, premise2=F.

So the only row where both premises are true is row5. So in that case, conclusion is true. So the argument is valid.

Wait, but wait, what about if M is F, O is T, and N is F? That would be row7. But in that case, premise1 is F∨F = F. So since premise1 is F, the premises aren't both true. So no counterexample.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think about the argument again. The argument is:

M∨N

~M ∧ O

∴ N

So, in terms of logical implication, it's (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O) → N.

We need to check if whenever the premises are true, N is true.

Looking at the truth table, the only case where (M∨N) is true and (~M ∧ O) is true is when M=F, N=T, O=T (row5). In that case, N is T.

In all other cases, either one of the premises is false. So no case where premises are true and N is false. So the argument is valid.

So the answer should be option A: Valid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says invalid with M and O true, N false. Let's check that case: M=T, O=T, N=F.

In row3: M=T, N=F, O=T.

Premise1: M∨N = T∨F = T.

Premise2: ~M=F. So ~M ∧ O = F ∧ T = F.

So premises are T and F. So not both true. So that's not a case where premises are true and conclusion is false. So that can't be a counterexample.

Similarly, option C: M=T, O=F, N=F.

In row4: M=T, N=F, O=F.

Premise1: T.

Premise2: F.

So premises not both true.

Option D: O=T, M=F, N=F.

Which is row7: M=F, N=F, O=T.

Premise1: F.

Premise2: T.

So premises not both true. So no counterexample.

So the only possible counterexample would be a case where both premises are true but N is false, but such a case doesn't exist. Therefore, the argument is valid.

To determine the validity of the argument:

**Argument:**
- Premises: \( M \lor N \) and \( \neg M \land O \)
- Conclusion: \( N \)

**Truth Table Analysis:**

We construct a truth table for all possible truth values of \( M \), \( N \), and \( O \) (8 combinations). The argument is valid if, in every row where both premises are true, the conclusion \( N \) is also true. If there is any row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

### Truth Table:

| Row | \( M \) | \( N \) | \( O \) | \( M \lor N \) | \( \neg M \land O \) | Both Premises True? | \( N \) |
|-----|---------|---------|---------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| 1   | T       | T       | T       | T              | F                     | F                     | T       |
| 2   | T       | T       | F       | T              | F                     | F                     | T       |
| 3   | T       | F       | T       | T              | F                     | F                     | F       |
| 4   | T       | F       | F       | T              | F                     | F                     | F       |
| 5   | F       | T       | T       | T              | T                     | T                     | T       |
| 6   | F       | T       | F       | T              | F                     | F                     | T       |
| 7   | F       | F       | T       | F              | T                     | F                     | F       |
| 8   | F       | F       | F       | F              | F                     | F                     | F       |

### Key Observations:
1. The only row where both premises (\( M \lor N \) and \( \neg M \land O \)) are true is **Row 5** (\( M = F \), \( N = T \), \( O = T \)).
2. In **Row 5**, the conclusion \( N \) is also true.
3. There is no row where both premises are true and the conclusion \( N \) is false.

### Counterexample Check:
- **Option B**: \( M = T \), \( N = F \), \( O = T \) (Row 3). Here, \( M \lor N = T \), but \( \neg M \land O = F \), so both premises are not true.
- **Option C**: \( M = T \), \( N = F \), \( O = F \) (Row 4). Here, \( M \lor N = T \), but \( \neg M \land O = F \), so both premises are not true.
- **Option D**: \( M = F \), \( N = F \), \( O = T \) (Row 7). Here, \( M \lor N = F \), so both premises are not true.

No counterexample exists where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **valid** because in all cases where both premises are true, the conclusion \( N \) is also true.
