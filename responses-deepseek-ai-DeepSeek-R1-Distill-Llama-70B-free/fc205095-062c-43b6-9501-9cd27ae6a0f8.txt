Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the order of payment when a company goes bankrupt. The question is about who gets paid first among bondholders, common stockholders, and preferred stockholders. Hmm, I remember this from my finance class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means. Bondholders are essentially creditors who lend money to the company. They get interest payments and their money back at maturity. So in terms of risk, they're probably higher up because they're creditors, not owners.

Then there's preferred stock and common stock. Both are types of equity, but preferred has some advantages. Preferred stockholders get paid dividends before common stockholders. Also, in the event of liquidation, preferred stockholders have a higher claim than common stockholders.

Wait, so in bankruptcy, the order of payment is based on seniority. So first come the secured creditors, then unsecured creditors, and then equity holders. But the question is specifically about bonds, preferred, and common stock.

Bonds are debt instruments, so bondholders are creditors. Preferred stock is a type of equity but has a higher claim than common stock. So in terms of priority, bondholders (as creditors) should be paid before stockholders. Among the stockholders, preferred are paid before common.

Putting it all together, the order should be bondholders first, then preferred stockholders, and finally common stockholders. So looking at the options:

Option I says "Bondholders, preferred stockholders, common stockholders." That matches what I was thinking. Let me double-check the other options to be sure.

Option A: Preferred, then common, then bonds. No, that's wrong because bonds are higher priority.

Option B: Bonds, common, preferred. No, preferred should come before common.

Option C: Preferred, then bonds, then common. Doesn't make sense because bonds should come first.

Option D: Common first. Definitely not.

Option E: Bonds and common equally, then preferred. No, because bondholders have higher priority.

Option F: Preferred first, then bonds and common equally. No.

Option G: Bonds equal with preferred. No, bonds are higher.

Option H: Common first. No.

Option I: Correct order. Bondholders first, then preferred, then common.

Option J: Common and preferred equally. No.

So the correct answer should be I.

The order of payment in bankruptcy is determined by the seniority of claims. Bondholders, being creditors, have the highest priority and are paid first. Preferred stockholders, having a higher claim than common stockholders, are paid next. Common stockholders, as owners with the lowest priority, are paid last. 

Among the options, only option I correctly reflects this order: Bondholders, preferred stockholders, common stockholders.

Answer: I
