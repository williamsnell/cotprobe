Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the wave numbers of the first five members of the spectrum emitted by ionized helium using the Bohr formula. Hmm, I remember that the Bohr model is related to the hydrogen atom, but wait, ionized helium would be He+, which is a one-electron ion, right? So I think the Bohr formula applies here because He+ is hydrogen-like.

Wait, the Bohr formula for hydrogen gives the wavelengths of the spectral lines. Oh wait, but the question is about wave numbers, not wavelengths. Oh right, wave number is 1 divided by wavelength. And the formula for the wave number in the Bohr model comes from the Rydberg formula, I think.

The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R_H * (1/(n₁²) - 1/(n₂²)), where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. But wait, since we're dealing with He+, the Rydberg constant changes. Oh right, for a hydrogen-like ion with nuclear charge Z, the Rydberg constant becomes R = R_H * Z². Because the energy levels scale with Z squared. Oh wait, R_H is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1, but I might need to remember the exact value.

Wait, wait, the Rydberg constant R for hydrogen is about 1.097373e7 m^-1. Wait, no, wait, I think I might be mixing it up. Oh yeah, the Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097373 × 10^7 per meter. So for He+, Z is 2, so R_He = R_H * (2)^2 = 4 * R_H.

So the Rydberg formula for He+ would be 1/λ = R_He * (1/(n₁²) - 1/(n₂²)), where n₂ > n₁. The spectral lines are emitted when the electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one. So for the first five members, I think we're looking at transitions ending at n=2, n=1, or maybe starting from higher n's.

Wait, the first five members—wait, the Lyman series is when electrons drop to n=1, and that's in the ultraviolet. The Balmer series is n=2, which is visible. But wait, ionized helium's spectrum is actually the same as hydrogen's but scaled because of higher Z. Oh wait, but wait, the first five members of the spectrum would probably be the first five lines in the spectrum, perhaps the first five transitions. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the first five lines of the Balmer series or something else.

Wait, but the problem says "the first five members of the spectrum emitted by ionized helium." The spectrum of He+ would consist of transitions where the electron moves between energy levels. So the first few lines would correspond to transitions ending at lower n. Maybe the first five lines are the first five transitions in the Lyman series, which ends at n=1.

Wait, the Lyman series for hydrogen has transitions from n=2,3,4,… down to n=1. Each of these would give a line in the spectrum. So the first five members would be n=2→1, n=3→1, n=4→1, n=5→1, n=6→1. So for each, compute the wave number.

So for each transition, compute 1/λ = R * (1/1² - 1/n²), with R being 4R_H because He+ has Z=2.

So R_H is about 1.097373e7 m^-1. So R_He = 4 * R_H ≈ 4.389492e7 m^-1.

Now, let's compute each term.

First, for n=2: 1/1² - 1/2² = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. So wave number is R * 3/4. Let me compute that: 4.389492e7 * 0.75 = 3.29212e7 m^-1. Wait, that's a very high wave number, but maybe that's correct.

Wait a minute, does that make sense? Because higher wave numbers correspond to shorter wavelengths. But wait, the first line in the Lyman series for hydrogen is about 121 nm, which is a wave number of about 8.225e6 m^-1. Wait, so if He+ has Z=2, then the wave numbers would be 4 times higher. So, 8.225e6 *4 is about 3.29e7 m^-1. So that matches the first calculation.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are in the thousands. Oh wait, perhaps the options are given in units of cm^-1, not m^-1. Because 1 m^-1 is 0.01 cm^-1. Wait, no, 1 m^-1 is 100 cm^-1 because 1 m is 100 cm. So to get cm^-1, multiply by 100.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1 m is 100 cm. So 1 m^-1 equals 100 cm^-1. So if the wave number in m^-1 is 4.338e7 m^-1, then in cm^-1, it's 4.338e5 cm^-1. But looking at the options, all are about 1e4 cm^-1, so I'm confused. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the wave number in units of cm^-1. Because the Rydberg constant is often expressed as 1.097e7 m^-1, which is 1.097e5 cm^-1. Oh wait, no: 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m^-1 = (1/100 cm)^-1 = 100 cm^-1. So 1.097e7 m^-1 is 1.097e7 * 100 cm^-1 = 1.097e9 cm^-1? That doesn't make sense because that's way larger than the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me get the Rydberg constant correct. The Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097e7 inverse meters (m^-1), which is 1.097e5 inverse centimeters (cm^-1), since 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m^-1 = 0.01 cm^-1. Wait, no, 1 m = 100 cm → 1 cm = 0.01 m → 1 cm^-1 = 100 m^-1. So, 1 m^-1 is 0.01 cm^-1. So R_H is 1.097e7 m^-1 = 1.097e5 cm^-1. Oh wait, yeah, that makes sense. Because 1.097e7 m^-1 multiplied by 100 cm/m gives 1.097e9 cm^-1, which can't be right. Or wait, perhaps I should think of it as 1 m^-1 = 0.01 cm^-1. So 1.097e7 m^-1 equals 1.097e7 * 0.01 cm^-1 = 1.097e5 cm^-1. Yeah, that's correct. So R_H is about 1.097e5 cm^-1. Then R_He is 4 * R_H ≈ 4.389e5 cm^-1.

Wait, but that would make the wave numbers of He+ in the order of 4e5 cm^-1. But the options are in the 1e4 range. So I'm getting conflicting numbers here. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of nanometers and then convert to wave numbers. Let's try that. For the first transition, n=2 to n=1 in He+.

The Rydberg formula in terms of wavelength is 1/λ = R * (1 - 1/n²). For He+, R is 4*R_H.

So for n=2, 1/λ = 4 R_H (1 - 1/4) = 4 R_H (3/4) = 3 R_H.

R_H is 1.097e7 m^-1, so 3 R_H is 3.291e7 m^-1.

Wait, 3.291e7 m^-1 is the wave number, which is 3.291e7 / 100 = 3.291e5 cm^-1. But the options are all around 1e4 cm^-1. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Oh wait, wait, perhaps the Bohr formula uses the Rydberg constant R as 1.097e4 m^-1? No, no, that can't be right. Let me double-check. No, the Rydberg constant is about 1.097373e7 m^-1. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "wave numbers of the first five members of the spectrum". Maybe the first five transitions are not all in the same series. Maybe it's considering the five lines with the longest wavelengths. But in that case, for He+, the longest wavelength would be the transition with the smallest energy difference, which would be the transition between the highest n and n-1. For example, n=3→2 would be longer than n=2→1.

Wait, but in hydrogen, the first line (longest wavelength) of the Balmer series is n=3→2 at about 656 nm. For He+, that would be at 656/4 = 164 nm, which is in the UV. But maybe the first five lines in the spectrum would include transitions from higher n's.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first five transitions in the spectrum, regardless of the series, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first five lines are the first five transitions in the Lyman series. So n=2→1, 3→1, 4→1, 5→1, 6→1. Let's compute those.

For each transition:

1. n=2 →n=1: 1/λ = R_He (1 - 1/4) = (4 R_H)(3/4) = 3 R_H
Wave number σ = 3 R_H

2. n=3 →n=1: σ = R_He (1 - 1/9) =4 R_H (8/9) = (32/9) R_H ≈3.555 R_H

Wait, wait, no, let's compute each step correctly.

Wait, R_He = 4 R_H.

So for each transition from n to 1, the wave number is R_He (1 - 1/n²) = 4 R_H (1 - 1/n²).

Wait, but perhaps I should plug in R_H as 1.097e5 cm^-1, so R_He is 4.389e5 cm^-1.

Wait, but wait, if the wave numbers in the options are in the 1e4 cm^-1 range, then perhaps I'm making a mistake in units. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the Rydberg constant as approximately 1.097e4 m^-1, which is 1.097e6 cm^-1. No, that doesn't make sense because 1e4 m^-1 is 1e6 cm^-1, which is way too high.

Wait, perhaps the Rydberg constant R_H is taken as 1.097e4 m^-1, which is 1.097e6 cm^-1. Then R_He would be 4 * 1.097e4 m^-1 = 4.388e4 m^-1, which is 4.388e6 cm^-1. But again, the options are in the 1e4 cm^-1 range, so this doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me compute the wave numbers for each transition using the correct Rydberg constant in cm^-1.

R_H is 109,678 cm^-1 (since 1.097373e7 m^-1 is 1.097373e5 * 100 cm^-1/m → wait, no, wait, 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m^-1 = 0.01 cm^-1. So 1.097373e7 m^-1 = 1.097373e5 cm^-1. So R_H = 109,737 cm^-1 approximately.

So R_He = 4 * 109,737 ≈ 438,948 cm^-1.

Now, for each transition from n=2,3,4,5,6 down to 1:

1. n=2→1: σ = R_He (1 - 1/4) = 438,948 * (3/4) = 438,948 * 0.75 = let's compute that. 438,948 * 0.75:

438,948 * 0.75 = 438,948 * 3/4 = (438,948 /4) *3 = 109,737 *3 = 329,211 cm^-1.

2. n=3→1: σ = 438,948 * (1 - 1/9) = 438,948 * (8/9) ≈438,948 * 0.888888... ≈438,948 * 8/9.

Compute 438,948 /9 = 48,771. So 48,771 *8 = 390,168 cm^-1.

3. n=4→1: σ=438,948*(1-1/16)=438,948*(15/16)=438,948*0.9375.

Compute 438,948 * 0.9375. Let's compute 438,948 * (15/16):

438,948 /16 = 27,434.25. Multiply by 15: 27,434.25 *15=411,513.75 cm^-1.

4. n=5→1: σ=438,948*(1 -1/25)=438,948*(24/25)=438,948*0.96=?

438,948 *0.96 = (438,948 * 1) - (438,948 *0.04) = 438,948 - 17,557.92= 421,390.08 cm^-1.

5. n=6→1: σ=438,948*(1-1/36)=438,948*(35/36)= approx 438,948*(0.972222).

Compute 438,948 * 35/36.

35/36 is approximately 0.972222.

438,948 * 0.972222 = Let me compute 438,948 * 35 = let's see: 438,948 *30=13,168,440; 438,948 *5=2,194,740 → total 15,363,180. Now divide by 36: 15,363,180 /36 = 426,508.333 cm^-1.

Wait, so the first five wave numbers are approximately:

329,211 cm^-1,

390,168 cm^-1,

411,514 cm^-1,

421,390 cm^-1,

426,508 cm^-1.

But looking at the options provided, all are in the range of 9,800 to 22,300. So that's about an order of magnitude smaller than what I'm getting. That suggests that I'm making a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R_H in terms of 1e4 m^-1 instead of 1e7. Because 1e4 m^-1 is 1e6 cm^-1, which is way too high. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the Rydberg constant as approximately 1.097e4 m^-1, which would make R_He 4.389e4 m^-1.

Wait, 1.097e4 m^-1 is 10,970 m^-1, which is 109.7 cm^-1. That can't be right because the Rydberg constant is much larger than that.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me check online what the Rydberg constant is. Oh wait, in the problem I can't access external resources, but I know that R_H is approximately 1.097373e7 per meter, which is 1.097373e5 per cm. So R_He is 4 times that, about 4.389e5 per cm.

But the options given are in the 1e4 per cm range, which suggests that perhaps the correct approach is to use R_H as approximately 1.097e4 m^-1, which is 1.097e6 cm^-1. But that would make R_He about 4.389e6 cm^-1, which is still way higher than the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the reciprocal, or I'm miscalculating something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the wave number is given by σ = R * (1/(m^2) - 1/(n^2)), but for emission, it's when n > m. So for each transition, m is the lower level.

Wait, for example, the first five lines in the Balmer series (n=3→2, 4→2, 5→2, etc.), but for He+ the Balmer series would be in the UV. Alternatively, perhaps the first five lines are the first five transitions possible, which could be a mix of different series.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first five lines in the Lyman series, which are the transitions from n=2,3,4,5,6 to n=1.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculations, each of these gives wave numbers in the ~3e5 cm^-1 range, which is way higher than any of the options. So I'm definitely doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute using energy levels and find the differences, then convert to wave numbers.

The energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by E_n = -13.6 eV * Z² / n². For He+, Z=2, so E_n = -13.6 *4 /n² = -54.4 /n² eV.

The energy difference between levels n and m (n > m) is ΔE = E_m - E_n = 54.4 (1/m² - 1/n²) eV.

To find the photon's energy, E_photon = 54.4 (1/m² - 1/n²) eV.

The wavelength λ is given by λ = hc / E_photon. Planck
