Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about general partnerships. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is something a partner in a general partnership is usually not entitled to. The options are A, B, and C.

First, I need to remember the basic characteristics of a general partnership. From what I recall, in a general partnership, all partners are owners and have certain rights and responsibilities.

Option A says "To review accounting records." I think partners do have the right to access the firm's records. They need to know the financial state of the business to make informed decisions, especially since they're personally liable. So, I don't think this is the correct answer because it's something they should be entitled to.

Option B is "To participate in management." General partners typically have equal say in the management of the business unless there's an agreement stating otherwise. So each partner can participate in management. Therefore, this is also something they are entitled to, so this isn't the correct answer either.

Option C states "To be liable only for personal negligence." Hmm. In a general partnership, partners have unlimited personal liability. That means each partner is liable not only for their own actions but also for the actions of other partners and the business debts. So, if one partner makes a mistake or incurs debt, all partners can be held liable. So, being liable only for personal negligence isn't the case here. They can be liable for more than that, which is why this option stands out.

So putting it all together, the question is asking which right a partner does NOT have. Since partners are entitled to review records and participate in management, the one they're not entitled to is being liable only for personal negligence. So the answer should be option C.

The question asks which option a partner in a general partnership is usually not entitled to. 

- **Option A**: Partners are entitled to review accounting records as they need access to financial information for decision-making.
- **Option B**: Partners are generally entitled to participate in management, as they are co-owners of the business.
- **Option C**: Partners in a general partnership have unlimited liability, meaning they can be held liable for the actions of other partners and business debts, not just their own negligence.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as partners are not limited to liability only for personal negligence.

Answer: C
