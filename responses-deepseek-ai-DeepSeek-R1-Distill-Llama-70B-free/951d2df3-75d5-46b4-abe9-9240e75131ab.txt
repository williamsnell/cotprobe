Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about propositional logic (PL) and symbolizing a given sentence into the best possible formula from the options provided.

The sentence to symbolize is: "A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive."

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I need to identify the propositions involved and then figure out how they connect logically.

First, let me assign each part to a proposition. Let's say:

- Let L represent "A person has lived with you for all of the present year."
- Let B represent "The person was born in the present year."
- Let D represent "The person died in the present year."
- Let H represent "Your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive."

So, the sentence is saying that if a person was born or died this year, and your home was their home the entire time they were alive, then they're considered to have lived with you for the whole year. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me read it again carefully.

The sentence says: "A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year IF (the person was born or died in the present year) AND (your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive)."

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The structure is: "if [condition], then [something]." So, the way it's phrased is: "If the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time the person was alive, then the person is considered to have lived with you for the entire present year."

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me parse the sentence again. The structure is: "A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive."

So, the way it's phrased is: "A person is considered to have lived with you (L) if (B or D) and H." So, the condition is (B ∨ D) and H together.

In logical terms, the structure is: If (B ∨ D) and H, then L. So, the implication would be [(B ∨ D) ∧ H] → L.

But looking at the options, I need to see which formula matches this structure. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: H → [(B ∨ D) • L]
This seems like H implies (B or D and L). That's not what we want because our antecedent is (B or D and H), leading to L.

Option B: (L ∨ B) • (D → H)
This is (L or B) and (D implies H). Not matching our structure.

Option C: [L → (B ∨ D)] • H
This is two parts: (L implies B or D) and H. Doesn't fit.

Option D: (B ∨ D) → (H • L)
Here, B or D implies H and L. So, (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). That's not exactly our structure because our antecedent is (B∨D) and H leading to L, so it's [(B∨D) ∧ H] → L.

Option E: L → (B ∨ D • H)
This would mean L implies (B or D and H). But the original is the other way around: (B or D and H) implies L. So E is the converse of what we want.

Option F: [(B ∨ D) • H] → L
This looks exactly like our structure. Because [(B∨D) ∧ H] → L. So F is [(B∨D) • H] ⊃ L.

Wait, let me double-check the other options just in case.

Option G: L → [(B ∨ D) • H]
Same as E but structured differently. Still, L implies the conjunction, which is the converse.

Option H: L → [(H • B) ∨ D]
This is L implying (H and B) or D. Not matching.

Option I: [(B ∨ D) ∨ H] → L
Here, it's (B or D or H) implying L, which is different because we need both (B or D) and H together.

Option J: (B ∨ D • H) → L
Wait, this is (B or (D and H)) → L. Because in PL, without parentheses, it's right-associative, so D • H is first, then B or that. So J would be (B ∨ (D ∧ H)) → L, which isn't the same as our [(B∨D) ∧ H] → L.

Wait, no, actually, in most logical notations, ∧ has higher precedence than ∨, so without parentheses, B ∨ D • H would be B ∨ (D ∧ H). So J is (B ∨ (D ∧ H)) → L, which isn't the same as (B∨D) ∧ H → L.

So, going back to option F, which is [(B∨D) • H] → L. This exactly matches our structure: if (B or D) and H, then L.

So the correct answer should be F.

The sentence to symbolize is: "A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive."

Assigning propositions:
- **L**: "A person has lived with you for all of the present year."
- **B**: "The person was born in the present year."
- **D**: "The person died in the present year."
- **H**: "Your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive."

The sentence structure is: "If [(B ∨ D) ∧ H], then L," which translates logically to **[(B ∨ D) ∧ H] → L**.

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: H → [(B ∨ D) • L] — Incorrect. This implies H leads to (B or D and L), which is not the structure.
- **B**: (L ∨ B) • (D → H) — Incorrect. This combines unrelated propositions.
- **C**: [L → (B ∨ D)] • H — Incorrect. This combines two separate statements.
- **D**: (B ∨ D) → (H • L) — Incorrect. This implies (B or D) leads to (H and L), which is not the structure.
- **E**: L → (B ∨ D • H) — Incorrect. This is the converse of the desired implication.
- **F**: [(B ∨ D) • H] → L — Correct. This matches [(B ∨ D) ∧ H] → L exactly.
- **G**: L → [(B ∨ D) • H] — Incorrect. This is the converse of the desired implication.
- **H**: L → [(H • B) ∨ D] — Incorrect. This combines propositions in an unrelated way.
- **I**: [(B ∨ D) ∨ H] → L — Incorrect. This implies (B or D or H) leads to L, which is not the structure.
- **J**: (B ∨ D • H) → L — Incorrect. This implies (B or (D and H)) leads to L, which is not the structure.

The correct answer is **F**, as it directly matches the logical structure of the sentence.

Answer: F
