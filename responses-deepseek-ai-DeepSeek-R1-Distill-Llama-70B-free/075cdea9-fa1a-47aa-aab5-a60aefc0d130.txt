Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ReLU and sigmoid functions. I'm a bit rusty on my neural network basics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, I'll choose the correct option from A to J based on that.

Statement 1: The ReLU's gradient is zero for x < 0, and the sigmoid gradient σ(x)(1−σ(x)) ≤ 1/4 for all x.

Hmm, ReLU is the rectified linear unit. Its function is f(x) = max(0, x). So the gradient (derivative) of ReLU would be 1 when x > 0, 0 when x < 0, and undefined at x = 0. So for x < 0, gradient is zero. That part is correct.

Now the sigmoid part. The sigmoid function is σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x)). Its derivative is σ'(x) = σ(x)(1 - σ(x)). I remember that the maximum value of this derivative occurs at x=0 because that's where the sigmoid is steepest. At x=0, σ(0) = 0.5, so σ'(0) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, which is 1/4. And since the function is symmetric and the derivative decreases as you move away from zero in both directions, the maximum value of σ'(x) is indeed 1/4. So for all x, σ'(x) ≤ 1/4. So that part is also true.

So Statement 1 is correct on both counts.

Statement 2: The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.

Wait, gradients refer to the derivatives here. The sigmoid function is smooth and differentiable everywhere. Its derivative exists for all real numbers, so yes, it's continuous.

ReLU, on the other hand, has a problem at x=0. The left-hand derivative as x approaches 0 from the negative side is 0, and the right-hand derivative as x approaches from the positive side is 1. At x=0, the function isn't differentiable because the left and right derivatives aren't the same. So the gradient (derivative) of ReLU is discontinuous at x=0.

So Statement 2 says both parts correctly: sigmoid gradient is continuous, ReLU's isn't. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Statement 2 says: "The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient." Correct. Yes, because ReLU's gradient is discontinuous (jumps from 0 to 1 at x=0), whereas sigmoid's is smooth everywhere.

So both statements are true.

Now looking at the options:

Option B is "True, True". So that would be correct.

Wait, let me just check the options again. The options are about whether each statement is true or false.

Looking at each option:

Option B: Both statements are true. So that's what I concluded.

Wait, but let me review the options again.

Options:

A: Statement 1 is true for x <0, statement 2 is false for x ≠0.

Wait, no. Because statement 1 is about ReLU's gradient for x<0 (which is true), and the sigmoid part (which is also true). So statement 1 as a whole is true. So option A is incorrect because statement 2's evaluation is wrong.

Option B: Both statements are true. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me read the options correctly.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says both are true. So that's what I think.

Other options:

Option F: Statement 1 is only false for x>0, which isn't the case.

Option H: False for statement 1. No, because statement 1 is correct.

So the correct answer should be option B, where both statements are true.
</think>

Statement 1 is evaluated as follows:  
- The ReLU function, defined as \( f(x) = \max(0, x) \), has a gradient of 0 for \( x < 0 \), which is correct.  
- The sigmoid function, \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \), has a derivative \( \sigma'(x) = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x)) \). The maximum value of this derivative occurs at \( x = 0 \), where \( \sigma'(0) = 0.25 \). Since the derivative decreases symmetrically as \( x \) moves away from 0, \( \sigma'(x) \leq \frac{1}{4} \) for all \( x \). This is also correct.  
Thus, Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2 is evaluated as follows:  
- The sigmoid function is smooth and differentiable everywhere, meaning its gradient is continuous.  
- The ReLU function, however, is not differentiable at \( x = 0 \) because the left-hand derivative (0) and the right-hand derivative (1) are not equal. Therefore, ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.  
Thus, Statement 2 is also true.

Given that both statements are true, the correct answer is:

**B: True, True**
