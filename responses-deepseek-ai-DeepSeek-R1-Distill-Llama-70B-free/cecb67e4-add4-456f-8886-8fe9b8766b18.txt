Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about age discrimination in the context of employment law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about when evidence of age discrimination exists regarding the firing of an employee. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that age discrimination laws are in place to protect employees from being fired or treated unfairly because of their age. The key here is that the firing must be based on age rather than other factors like job performance.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's only when the employee is over retirement age. I'm not sure if that's correct because age discrimination can apply to anyone over 40, I think, regardless of retirement status. So maybe A is too narrow.

Option B states that it's whenever an older employee is fired, regardless of the reason. That seems too broad because not every firing of an older person is discrimination. Employers can have legitimate reasons, like poor performance.

Option C claims it's whenever age is considered in any employment decision. That might be correct because using age as a factor in decisions could be discriminatory. But wait, sometimes age might be relevant for certain jobs, but I'm not sure if that's a common exception. Generally, using age as a factor is problematic.

Option D says it's whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing. This sounds right because the law would consider discrimination if the firing was based on age rather than legitimate factors like performance or company needs.

Option E mentions only when company policy has an adverse impact. I think adverse impact is more about unintentional discrimination affecting a group, but the question is about individual evidence. So E might not be the best fit.

Option F is about a formal complaint. I don't think evidence exists only when someone files a complaint. Discrimination can exist regardless of whether a complaint is filed.

Option G talks about multiple cases in the same company. Again, individual cases can be discrimination even if there's only one instance.

Option H refers to substantial economic loss. While economic loss might be a factor in damages, the existence of discrimination doesn't depend on how much loss occurred.

Option I says whenever a younger employee replaces an older one. That might be a sign, but it's not conclusive. Sometimes it's legitimate, like if the younger person is more qualified.

Option J is about the majority in an age group being affected. That sounds more like a pattern of discrimination, but individual cases can also be evidence.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be when the firing is based on age rather than performance. That points to option D.

The correct answer is D: whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing.

Answer: D
