Okay, so I've got this question about backgammon and how many players it's for. I'm not super familiar with the game, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that backgammon is a board game, right? I've seen pictures of it with the triangular points and the checkers. I think it's a two-player game because I've heard people mention playing against each other. But wait, could it be more? Maybe sometimes people play in teams, but I'm not sure if that's standard.

I'll try to recall. Monopoly is for multiple players, like up to eight, but backgammon seems more like chess or checkers, which are two-player games. So maybe it's two. The options given include two as option C. The other options are numbers like one, which would be solo, but I don't think backgammon is a solo game. It's competitive, so two makes sense.

I think the answer is C.
