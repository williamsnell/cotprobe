Okay, so I've got this question about Tina and her difficulty recognizing the space shuttle in a picture. Hmm. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that Tina had never seen a space shuttle before, but her parents showed her a picture of it ready to launch. Then, when she saw another picture of it flying, she had trouble recognizing it. I need to figure out which psychological concept explains this problem.

The options are A through J, each a different term. I'm a bit rusty on some of these, so I'll try to think through each one.

First, let's break down the scenario. Tina saw the shuttle in one context (on the launchpad) and then later saw it in another context (flying). She had difficulty recognizing it the second time. So the issue is about how she perceives the same object in different situations.

Wait, it's about her perception changing based on the context or the way the shuttle is presented. I remember something about perceptual set. Perceptual set refers to the idea that our expectations and past experiences influence how we perceive things. So if Tina saw the shuttle on the ground first, maybe she expected it to look a certain way, and when it was flying, her brain wasn't prepared for that image, making it harder to recognize.

Alternatively, there's something called shape constancy, which is the ability to recognize that an object's shape remains the same even when viewed from different angles. But shape constancy is more about maintaining the perception of shape despite changes in perspective. If the shuttle's shape changed because it's in a different pose (like flying), maybe that's a factor. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Another option is sensory adaptation, which is when our sensory systems stop responding to a stimulus because it's constant. But that doesn't seem to fit because Tina's seeing two different images, not the same one over time.

Then there's dishabituation, which is when a new stimulus renews a response that had decreased due to habituation. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Perceptual adaptation is about adjusting to changes, like after wearing prism glasses that distort vision. Again, maybe not the right fit.

Summation is a term I think is more about how multiple stimuli add up, like in neural responses. Probably not related.

Sensory interaction could involve how different senses affect each other, but the question is about the same sense (vision) in different contexts.

Binocular cues and depth perception are about how we perceive 3D, so I don't think that's it.

Autokinetic effect is when a stationary dot appears to move, which is unrelated.

So, going back, the key here is that Tina's initial perception (shuttle on launchpad) influenced how she perceived the next image (flying). That sounds like a perceptual set because her mind was set to expect the shuttle in a certain way based on the first picture.

Wait, but could it also be about shape constancy? If the shuttle's orientation changed, maybe she didn't recognize it because its shape appeared different. But shape constancy is about maintaining the perception despite changes, so if she couldn't recognize it, perhaps she lacked shape constancy. Hmm, now I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, shape constancy is when you do recognize the shape as the same despite changes. So if she didn't recognize it, that might imply a failure in shape constancy. But I'm not sure if that's the concept here.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the context. The first picture was on the ground, the second in flight. Her expectation from the first image set a perceptual set, making it harder to recognize the second image as the same object.

So, putting it all together, the best fit seems to be perceptual set. So the answer should be E: perceptual set.

The question involves Tina's difficulty recognizing a space shuttle in a different context after seeing it initially. The key concept here is how her initial perception influenced her later recognition. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Perceptual set** refers to how expectations and past experiences shape perception. Tina's initial image of the shuttle on the launchpad likely set her expectation, making it harder to recognize it in a different context (flying). This fits the scenario well.
- **Shape constancy** involves recognizing an object's shape despite perspective changes. While relevant, it doesn't fully explain the difficulty caused by contextual differences.
- Other options like sensory adaptation, dishabituation, summation, sensory interaction, binocular cues, depth perception, and autokinetic effect are less relevant to the scenario.

The best explanation is **perceptual set**, as Tina's initial exposure influenced her later perception.
