Okay, so I've got this question about Freud's concepts, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about Freud's notion where both dreams and slips of the tongue are seen as meaningful and goal-directed. The options are A through J, each with a different term.

First, I remember that Freud had a lot of theories about the unconscious mind and how it influences behavior. One of the key ideas I've heard about is the concept of "psychic determinism." From what I understand, psychic determinism suggests that all psychological phenomena, including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, have underlying causes in the unconscious mind. So nothing happens by chance; everything is determined by unconscious factors.

The question mentions both dreams and slips of the tongue. Oh right, Freud talked about slips of the tongue, which he called "parapraxes." He believed these were not just random mistakes but expressions of unconscious thoughts or desires. Similarly, he viewed dreams as "the royal road to the unconscious," meaning they reveal repressed thoughts and wishes.

So both phenomena, dreams and slips, are seen as having meaning and being directed towards some goal, which aligns with psychic determinism. That makes sense because each event is determined by unconscious processes rather than being random.

Looking at the options, option C is "psychic determinism." The other options don't ring a bell as much. For instance, reciprocal determinism is a term I associate more with Albert Bandura, related to the interaction between behavior, environment, and personal factors. Cognitive terms like cognitive dynamogenesis don't seem right because Freud's ideas were more about the unconscious rather than cognitive processes. Options like ptyalism and dream determinism don't seem familiar, and I don't think they're correct terms here.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: psychic determinism.

The correct answer is C: psychic determinism. Freud's theory of psychic determinism posits that all psychological events, including dreams and slips of the tongue, are meaningful and directed by unconscious factors. These phenomena are not random but instead reflect underlying unconscious thoughts or desires.

Answer: C
