Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker. Each allele has a frequency of 0.2. Hmm, I remember that allele frequencies are about how common each allele is in the population.

Wait, the question is asking about an individual carrying two specific alleles. Oh, wait, but in diploid organisms like humans, each individual has two alleles for a geneâ€”one from each parent. So if each allele has a frequency of 0.2, are we talking about the same allele or two different ones?

Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says two specific alleles. So maybe it's the same allele on both chromosomes. Like, if someone is homozygous for that allele. Because if both alleles are the same, then the frequency would be the square of the allele's frequency.

So, if each allele is 0.2, then the probability of having two copies would be 0.2 multiplied by 0.2, which is 0.04. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, if they're asking about having both alleles (maybe they're different?), but the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says "carrying two specific alleles". Oh wait, maybe it's about two different alleles for the same marker. Like, if one is A and the other is B, each with a frequency of 0.2. Or maybe it's about two copies of the same allele.

Wait, the wording is: "each of which has a frequency of 0.2". So each specific allele has a frequency of 0.2. So if we're looking for an individual to have both alleles, but I think that would be a heterozygote. Wait, no, wait. If the individual is diploid, then for a single gene, they have two alleles. So if the question is about having both of a specific pair, perhaps each allele is 0.2, but that's for each allele in the population.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's break it down. Suppose the marker has several alleles, but we're focusing on two specific ones. Each of these two has a frequency of 0.2. So in a population, the frequency of allele A is 0.2 and allele B is 0.2. What's the chance that an individual has both A and B?

Oh, wait, no. Wait, the individual has two alleles for that gene. So the possible scenarios are AA, AB, BB, or other combinations if there are more alleles. But in this question, perhaps it's assuming only two alleles. Or maybe the marker has more alleles, but we're focusing on two specific ones.

Wait, the question is about carrying two specific alleles. So maybe each allele is one specific type, but perhaps the individual has two copies of each? No, that doesn't make sense. In a diploid organism, you have two alleles per gene, not four.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again: "The likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, will be:"

So, for a particular DNA marker, each of the two specific alleles (maybe two different ones) has a frequency of 0.2. So the individual would have one copy of each, making them heterozygous for that marker. But wait, how does that work? Because if allele A has a frequency of 0.2 and allele B has 0.2, then the frequency of the AB genotype would be 2 * (0.2 * 0.2) = 0.08? Or is it just 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04?

Wait, in Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. So if both p and q are 0.2, then the heterozygote frequency is 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08. So that's 8%.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.08. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking about the probability that both alleles are present in the individual. If the individual is diploid, the chance that both alleles are the same (homozygous) is p^2 + q^2, but that would be the probability of being homozygous for either allele. But the question says carrying two specific alleles, which I think implies having both. So if the two specific alleles are A and B, then the individual must have one A and one B. So that would be the heterozygote case, which is 2pq, which is 2*(0.2)*(0.2) = 0.08.

Alternatively, if the question is about having two copies of the same allele, say A, then it's p squared, which is 0.04. That would be option H.

Wait, the question says "two specific alleles", which could mean two different ones. Because if it's the same allele, you'd say "two copies of the same allele". So I think the correct approach is 2pq, which is 0.08, option I.

But wait, another thought. Each allele has a frequency of 0.2. So the probability that one allele is A is 0.2, and the other is B is 0.2. But since the individual has two alleles, the chance of having both A and B would be 2*(0.2)*(0.2) = 0.08. So that's the heterozygote case.

So the answer would be I: 0.08.

The question asks for the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, where each allele has a frequency of 0.2. In a diploid organism, an individual has two alleles for a given gene, and the question specifies "two specific alleles," which implies the individual is heterozygous (one copy of each allele).

Using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq) is calculated as:

\[
2pq = 2 \times (0.2) \times (0.2) = 0.08
\]

Thus, the likelihood of an individual carrying one copy of each specific allele is 0.08. This corresponds to option I.
