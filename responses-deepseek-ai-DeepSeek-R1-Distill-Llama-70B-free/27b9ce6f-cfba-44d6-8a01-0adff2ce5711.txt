Question:

Distinguish betweenpenetranceand expressivity.

Options:

A: Penetrance refers to how widespread a trait is within a population, while expressivity measures the intensity of the trait.
B: Penetrance is the physical appearance resulting from a genotype, while expressivity is the genetic makeup of an organism.
C: Penetrance is the measure of the strength of a gene's effect, while expressivity is the measure of the stability of a gene's expression across generations.
D: Penetrance is the percentage of individuals who carry a gene and express it phenotypically, while expressivity is the degree of effect or the extent to which a gene expresses itself in different individuals.
E: Expressivity is the proportion of individuals in a population who show a particular trait, whereas penetrance is the range of manifestations of a gene in different tissues.
F: Penetrance and expressivity are the same.
G: Penetrance is the consistency of a gene's expression across different environments, while expressivity is the ability of a gene to be suppressed by other genes.
H: Penetrance is the likelihood that a trait will appear in the offspring, whereas expressivity is the range of phenotypes resulting from a given genotype.
I: Penetrance is the degree of effect or the extent to which a gene expresses itself in different individuals, while expressivity is the percentage of individuals who carry a gene and express it phenotypically.
J: Expressivity is the probability of a gene being inherited, and penetrance is the variability of a trait's expression among individuals.

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about penetrance and expressivity. Hmm, I remember they have to do with how genes express themselves, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions. Let me think.

I think penetrance is about whether a trait shows up at all. Like, if you have the gene, do you display the trait? So penetrance would be the percentage of people with the gene that actually show the phenotype. But wait, some sources say it's the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant of a gene that also express an associated trait. So high penetrance means most people with the gene show the trait.

Expressivity, on the other hand, must be about how the trait is expressed. Like, if the trait does show up, how severe or obvious is it. So it's the degree or extent to which the gene manifests. For example, a gene might always cause a certain trait (high penetrance), but in some people, the trait is more pronounced than in others. So expressivity varies the intensity.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly describes this. Let's go through them.

Option A: Penetrance is how widespread in the population, expressivity the intensity. No, I think penetrance is not about population prevalence but individual expression. So A is wrong.

Option B: Physical appearance vs genetic makeup. That doesn't sound right. Both terms are about gene expression, not the genotype itself. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Penetrance as strength, expressivity as stability across generations. I don't think so. Stability over generations sounds more like heritability or something else. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Penetrance is the percentage expressing, expressivity is the degree. Yes, this matches what I was thinking. Penetrance is whether they show it, expressivity is how much.

Option E: Expressivity as proportion in population, no. Wait, that would be like prevalence, which I don't think is what expressivity is. Penetrance is the proportion, but E has them swapped. So E is wrong.

Option F: They're the same. No, I remember they are different concepts. F is incorrect.

Option G: Consistency across environments and gene suppression. Doesn't ring a bell. I think these are about environment and epistasis, not penetrance and expressivity. G is wrong.

Option H: Penetrance is likelihood in offspring, expressivity is range of phenotypes. Wait, penetrance is about presence, not likelihood of inheritance. H might be mixing terms. I think penetrance is about whether the trait appears when the gene is present, not about passing it on. So H is incorrect.

Option I: It says the opposite of D. Penetrance is the extent, expressivity is percentage. No, I thought penetrance was the percentage. So I is wrong.

Option J: Probability of inheritance and variability. No, both terms are about expression, not inheritance probability. J is wrong.

So the correct answer is D. Penetrance is about the percentage showing the trait, and expressivity is how much the trait is expressed in those who have it.

The correct answer is D. Penetrance refers to the percentage of individuals carrying a gene who express the associated trait phenotypically, while expressivity describes the degree or extent to which the gene expresses itself in those individuals, such as the severity or intensity of the trait.

Answer: D
