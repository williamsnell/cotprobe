Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve using Euler's method. Hmm, let me try to remember how Euler's method works. From what I recall, Euler's method is a numerical way to approximate the solution to a differential equation with a given initial condition. It's kind of like taking small steps along the tangent line of the slope at each point to estimate where the function goes next.

The problem here is the differential equation ∂p/∂x = 0.5 * x * (1 - x), and the initial condition is p(0) = 2. We need to approximate p(2) using a step size of 1.

Wait, so the equation is dp/dx = 0.5x(1 - x). Right, because partial derivative and regular derivative are the same here since it's a function of one variable.

Euler's method formula, if I remember correctly, is something like y_{n+1} = y_n + h * f(x_n, y_n), where h is the step size, and f is the derivative function. In this case, since the derivative is given as dp/dx = 0.5x(1-x), that's our f(x, p) = 0.5x(1-x). Oh wait, wait, in this case, the derivative doesn't depend on p, only on x. That might make things simpler.

So we're starting at x=0, p=2. The step size is 1, so we'll take steps at x=0, x=1, x=2. Since we're going to x=2, that's two steps of size 1.

Let me outline the steps. First, initial point (x0, p0) is (0, 2). Then, compute p1 at x1=1, and then p2 at x2=2.

First step: from x=0 to x=1.

The slope at x=0 is f(0) = 0.5 * 0 * (1-0) = 0. So the change in p, dp, is h * slope = 1 * 0 = 0. So p1 = p0 + 0 = 2. So at x=1, p is 2.

Second step: from x=1 to x=2.

What's the slope at x=1? f(1) = 0.5 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 0.5 * 1 * 0 = 0. So again, the change is h * 0 = 0. So p2 = p1 + 0 = 2. So at x=2, p is 2.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, the function f(x) here is 0.5 x (1 - x). Let me compute f(0): 0.5 * 0 * (1-0) = 0. Correct.

f(1) = 0.5 * 1 * (1-1) = 0.5 *1 *0 = 0. Correct.

So both steps have a slope of zero, so p doesn't change. So at x=2, p remains at 2.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Because the exact solution might be different. Let me try solving the differential equation exactly to see what p(2) really is. Then I can compare.

The equation is dp/dx = 0.5x(1 - x). That's a separable equation. So integrating both sides:

p = ∫ 0.5x(1 - x) dx + C

Let me compute the integral. Let's expand 0.5x(1 - x) = 0.5x - 0.5x².

Integrate term by term:

∫0.5x dx = 0.5 * (x²/2) )= x²/4

∫0.5x² dx = 0.5 * (x³/3) )= x³/(6)

So, putting it together:

p = (x²)/4 - (x³)/6 + C

Now apply the initial condition p(0)=2. When x=0,

p = 0 - 0 + C = C = 2. So the exact solution is p(x) = x²/4 - x³/6 + 2.

Now, let's compute p(2):

p(2) = (4)/4 - (8)/6 + 2 = (1) - (4/3) + 2

Calculating that: 1 = 3/3, 4/3 is as is. So 3/3 - 4/3 = (-1/3). Then plus 2, which is 6/3. So (-1/3) + (6/3) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.

Wait, but Euler's method gave me p(2)=2. That's way off from the exact solution. So why is that?

Ah, I see. Because Euler's method is only an approximation, and the step size here is quite large (step size 1, over an interval of 2, so two steps). The function's slope changes, but because the derivative at x=0 and x=1 is zero, Euler's method doesn't capture the curve in between. Hence, the approximation isn't very accurate here.

But in the problem, we are to use Euler's method regardless. So according to the method, p(2)=2.

Looking back at the options, option G is 2.0. So the answer should be G.

To approximate \( p(2) \) using Euler's method, we start with the differential equation:

\[
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = 0.5x(1 - x),
\]

and the initial condition \( p(0) = 2 \). The step size is \( h = 1 \), so we will take two steps: from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \), and then from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 2 \).

### Step 1: From \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \)
At \( x = 0 \), the slope is:

\[
f(0) = 0.5 \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - 0) = 0.
\]

Using Euler's formula:

\[
p(1) = p(0) + h \cdot f(0) = 2 + 1 \cdot 0 = 2.
\]

### Step 2: From \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 2 \)
At \( x = 1 \), the slope is:

\[
f(1) = 0.5 \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0.
\]

Using Euler's formula:

\[
p(2) = p(1) + h \cdot f(1) = 2 + 1 \cdot 0 = 2.
\]

Thus, the Euler's method approximation gives \( p(2) = 2 \).

### Exact Solution (for comparison)
The exact solution of the differential equation is found by integrating:

\[
p(x) = \int 0.5x(1 - x) \, dx + C = \frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{x^3}{6} + C.
\]

Using \( p(0) = 2 \), we find \( C = 2 \). Therefore:

\[
p(x) = \frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{x^3}{6} + 2.
\]

At \( x = 2 \):

\[
p(2) = \frac{2^2}{4} - \frac{2^3}{6} + 2 = \frac{4}{4} - \frac{8}{6} + 2 = 1 - \frac{4}{3} + 2 = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667.
\]

The exact solution is \( p(2) \approx 1.6667 \), but Euler's method with a step size of 1 gives \( p(2) = 2 \). This discrepancy arises because Euler's method is an approximation and can be less accurate with larger step sizes.

From the given options, the closest match to the Euler's method result is:
