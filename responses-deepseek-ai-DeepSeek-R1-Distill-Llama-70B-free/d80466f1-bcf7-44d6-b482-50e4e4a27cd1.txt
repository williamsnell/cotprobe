Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about SCNT and the assumptions people make when they object to it. So, the question is: What assumption does Pence think people who object to SCNT make when they say that SCNT is not best for the child?

First, I need to understand what SCNT is. SCNT stands for Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer. I remember that's the cloning technique used to create Dolly the sheep. In human terms, it's a type of cloning where the nucleus from an adult cell is transferred into an egg cell, which then develops into an embryo. This is often discussed in the context of reproductive cloning or therapeutic cloning.

Now, the question is about the objection to SCNT based on the argument that it's not in the best interest of the child. So, people are saying that using SCNT for reproductive purposes isn't the best for the child. The question is about the assumption behind this objection.

Pence, I think, refers to a philosopher or ethicist who has written about cloning and its ethical implications. From what I recall, in discussions about cloning, various ethical concerns are raised, such as the welfare of the child, the psychological impact, or the potential for exploitation.

So, when someone argues that SCNT isn't best for the child, what do they assume about the parents' motives? The options are from A to J, with F being "none of the above."

Looking at the options:

A: The parents are prioritizing their own needs over the child's.
B: We can't tell what the motives of the parents are.
C: The parents have ulterior motives.
D: The parents have good motives.
E: The parents are incapable of making decisions for the child.
F: none of the above
G: The parents are indifferent to the child's wellbeing.
H: The parents are making an uninformed decision.
I: The parents are exploiting the child for personal gain.
J: The parents have bad motives.

I think the assumption here is that the parents are making a decision that isn't in the child's best interest, implying that the parents' motives aren't good. So, perhaps the objectors assume that the parents have bad or ulterior motives.

Wait, but option A says parents prioritize their own needs over the child's. That's a common argument against certain reproductive technologies—like when parents choose cloning because they want a child with specific traits, which might be for their own benefit rather than the child's.

Option I says the parents are exploiting the child for personal gain. That's similar to A but more specific about exploitation.

Option J says parents have bad motives, which is more general. So, if someone says SCNT isn't best for the child, they might assume the parents are acting selfishly, putting their own interests first, which would be option A.

Alternatively, Pence might argue that the objection assumes the parents have bad motives in general, which would be J.

Wait, I think I remember reading that Pence discusses the "best interests of the child" argument in the context of cloning. He argues that critics assume that parents who choose cloning must have bad motives, perhaps being selfish or exploitative. So the assumption is that the parents are acting with bad motives, not that they might have good reasons but are mistaken.

So, the correct assumption would be that the parents have bad motives, which is option J.

But let me double-check. If someone argues that SCNT isn't best for the child, what's the underlying assumption about the parents? It could be that they think the parents are making a decision that's not in the child's best interest, perhaps because the parents are prioritizing their own desires.

So, maybe option A is correct, because it's about prioritizing their own needs over the child's.

Alternatively, if the assumption is that the parents have bad motives in general, then J would be correct.

I think the key is that the objection assumes that the parents are not acting in the child's best interest, which implies they're acting in their own interest. So that would be option A.

Wait, but in the context of cloning, the argument against it often includes the idea that parents are trying to create a child for specific reasons, like replacing a deceased child or having a child with certain traits. So, the assumption is that the parents' motives are not altruistic, perhaps they're selfish.

So, the assumption is that the parents have bad motives, which is J.

Alternatively, if the argument is that the parents are making a decision that's not in the child's best interest, the assumption might be that the parents are prioritizing their own needs (A) or that they have bad motives (J).

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I think I need to recall Pence's specific argument. From what I remember, Pence argues that the "best interests" argument against cloning relies on the assumption that parents who would choose cloning are acting with bad motives, such as selfishness. So, he's pointing out that this objection makes an assumption about the parents' intentions.

Therefore, the correct answer would be J: The parents have bad motives.

Wait, but another angle: The objection could be based on the belief that the parents are making a decision without considering the child's welfare, perhaps because they're uninformed or not thinking clearly. That would be option H, but I don't think that's the main assumption.

Alternatively, the objection could imply that parents are incapable of making good decisions (E), but that doesn't directly tie to the best interest argument.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the argument. If someone says that SCNT isn't best for the child, the underlying assumption is about why the parents are choosing SCNT. If the technology is not best for the child, the parents must have reasons that are not in the child's best interest. So the assumption is that the parents have bad motives.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be J.

The question asks about the assumption Pence attributes to those who object to SCNT on the grounds that it is not in the best interest of the child. SCNT, or Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, is a cloning technique that raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding the welfare of the child and the motives of the parents.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Suggests parents prioritize their own needs over the child's. This is a plausible assumption, as critics often argue that parents using SCNT might do so for selfish reasons, such as wanting a child with specific traits.
- **I**: Implies parents exploit the child for personal gain, which is similar to A but more specific about exploitation.
- **J**: States that parents have bad motives, which is a broader assumption that encompasses selfishness or other negative intentions.

Pence’s argument focuses on the assumption that critics of SCNT believe parents who choose this technology are acting with bad motives, such as selfishness or exploitation. This aligns most closely with option **J**, as it reflects the general belief that parents are not acting altruistically.

Thus, the correct answer is:

J

Answer: J
