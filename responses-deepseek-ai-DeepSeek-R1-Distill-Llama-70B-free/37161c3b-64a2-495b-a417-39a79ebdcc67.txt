Okay, I need to compute the rate of heat transfer by natural convection from a horizontal square plate. The plate is 7 inches square, at 300°F, and the ambient air is at 80°F. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that the formula for heat transfer by convection is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

The plate is square and horizontal. The problem is about natural convection, so I should use the appropriate empirical equations provided. Let me look at the configurations given.

Looking at the options for horizontal plates, I see two possibilities for heated plates facing upward. One equation is h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3) and another is h = 0.27*(ΔT/L)^(1/4). Wait, which one applies here? Oh, right, the choice depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, which is determined by the Grashof number or the value of X, which I think is the product Gr * Pr.

Wait, the problem gives the ranges for X. For heated plates facing upward, the first equation (h = 0.22ΔT^(1/3)) is for the turbulent region, where X is between 2e7 and 3e10. The second equation (h=0.27(ΔT/L)^(1/4)) is for the laminar region with X between 1e5 and 2e7.

So I need to determine whether the flow here is in the laminar or turbulent region. To do that, I'll calculate the Grashof number, Gr, which is (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν^2. But wait, since the problem gives X as Gr * Pr, I can compute X once I have those values.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me get the properties of air at the film temperature. The film temperature is the average of the plate and ambient temperatures. So (300°F + 80°F)/2 = 190°F. I need to convert that to Rankine for consistency with other units. Since 190°F is 650 R (because 190 + 460 = 650).

At 650 R, I need the properties of air: kinematic viscosity ν, Prandtl number Pr, and the thermal expansion coefficient β. Alternatively, sometimes β is calculated as 1/T_avg, where T_avg is in absolute temperature.

Wait, I might have to use standard air properties. From memory, at around 600 R, ν is approximately 0.16 ft²/hr (or maybe ft²/s? Wait, units are tricky). Wait, no, wait. Let me think in consistent units. Because the plate size is in inches, maybe I should convert everything to inches and hours.

Wait, but standard unit conversions can get confusing. Let me plan the steps:

1. Compute ΔT = 300°F - 80°F = 220°F. Since we're dealing with temperature differences, the conversion to Rankine isn't necessary for ΔT as it cancels out, but for the film temperature, it's needed.

Wait, the film temperature is the average of the surface and ambient temperatures. So (300 + 80)/2 = 190°F. Convert that to Rankine: 190 + 460 = 650 R.

At 650 R, typical air properties are:
- Prandtl number, Pr ≈ 0.7
- Kinematic viscosity, ν ≈ 0.16 ft²/s? No, wait, that's way too big. Because 1 ft²/s is a huge kinematic viscosity, but air's ν is much smaller.

Wait, actually, I think I'm mixing up units. Let me correct. At 70°F (which is close to 650 R), air's kinematic viscosity ν is around 0.000017 ft²/s. Alternatively, 1.7e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, alternatively, I can use the following approach. Since I'm probably using the formula with X = Gr * Pr, which is (g * L^3 * ΔT/(ν²)) * Pr.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given equations without calculating X. Wait, but how?

Wait, the problem provides the equations, so perhaps I can directly plug in the numbers. Let's see.

The plate is 7 inches square. So the length L would be 7 inches. Wait, but in the equation, L is probably in feet because the units matter for h. Alternatively, perhaps the equations are in consistent units where L is in inches or feet.

Wait, the equations for h are given as:

For heated plates facing upward, two options:

h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3) [turbulent]

h = 0.27*(ΔT/L)^(1/4) [laminar]

Wait, but units are crucial here. Let me think about the units for h. Heat transfer coefficient h is usually in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

So, for the first equation, h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3). The ΔT is in °F, so that's okay. The units would be 0.22 [unit] * (°F)^(1/3). Wait, what's the unit here? If the result is h in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), then 0.22 must have units to match.

Alternatively, perhaps the equations are in specific unit setups. Maybe I can proceed by assuming that the equations are given with certain unit assumptions, such that when ΔT is in °F and L is in inches, the units for h come out correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the Grashof number and see whether it falls into the laminar or turbulent range, then choose the appropriate equation.

Let me proceed.

Compute the Grashof number, Gr. The formula is Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

But wait, since the problem gives X = Gr * Pr, and the ranges for X, perhaps I should calculate X to determine if it's in the laminar or turbulent region.

But to compute X, I need Gr and Pr. Gr is as above.

Wait, but given that I'm a bit stuck on the exact values of the properties, perhaps I can find a way to estimate whether X is in the laminar or turbulent range.

Alternatively, perhaps the plate's small size (7 inches) suggests that the Grashof number isn't very large, so it's in the laminar range. Because larger plates usually lead to higher Grashof numbers and turbulent flow.

Wait, L is 7 inches which is 0.5833 feet. Let me compute the film temperature, which is 190°F = 650 R.

At 650 R, the properties of air are approximately:

- Pr = 0.7
- ν = 0.0000177 ft²/s (I think this is correct)
- β = 1/T_avg, where T_avg is in R. So β = 1/650 R⁻¹.

Wait, yes, because β = 1/T for ideal gases, where T is absolute temperature. So β = 1/(650 R) = approximately 0.001538 R⁻¹.

g is the acceleration due to gravity. 32.174 ft/s².

Now, plug into Gr:

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L³) / ν²

Let me compute each term.

g = 32.174 ft/s²

β = 1/650 per R. Since ΔT is in F, but in Gr, the temperature should be in absolute terms. Wait, but ΔT is 220°F, which is 220 R (since 80°F is 460 +80=540 R; 300°F is 760 R. ΔT is 760-540=220 R).

Wait, no, ΔT in Gr should be in absolute units, so 220 R.

So ΔT = 220 R.

L is 7 inches = 0.5833 feet.

So L^3 = (0.5833)^3 ≈ 0.5833 * 0.5833 = 0.3403, then * 0.5833 ≈ 0.1986 ft³.

Now compute numerator: g * β * ΔT * L^3.

g = 32.174 ft/s²

β = 1/650 R⁻¹.

ΔT =220 R.

So numerator:

32.174 * (1/650) * 220 * 0.1986

Compute step by step:

32.174 * (220) = 7078.28

Multiply by (1/650): 7078.28 / 650 ≈ 10.894

Multiply by 0.1986: 10.894 * 0.1986 ≈ 2.164.

Denominator: ν² = (0.0000177)^2 = approx 3.13e-10 ft^4/s².

So Gr = 2.164 / 3.13e-10 ≈ 6.91e9.

Wait, that's a Grashof number of about 6.91e9.

Now, X = Gr * Pr.

Pr is 0.7.

X = 6.91e9 * 0.7 ≈ 4.837e9.

Now, looking at the table, the turbulent region is for X between 2e7 and 3e10. Our X is ~4.8e9, which is within the turbulent range. So we should use the turbulent equation for heated plates facing upward.

The turbulent equation is h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3).

Wait, but let me double-check the equations again. The problem lists for heated plates facing upward:

h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3) → turbulent region (X 2e7 to 3e10)

h = 0.27*(ΔT/L)^(1/4) → laminar region (X 1e5 to 2e7)

Since our X is about 4.8e9, which is in the turbulent range, we use h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3).

But wait, let me think about the units. ΔT is in °F, which is the same as R in magnitude, so raising to the 1/3 power is okay.

So h = 0.22 * (220)^(1/3).

Calculate 220^(1/3). Let's see, 6^3=216, so cube root of 220 is approximately 6.03.

So h ≈ 0.22 * 6.03 ≈ 1.3266.

Wait, but units? If the equation is set up correctly, h should be in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). But I'm not entirely sure about the unit assumptions here. Alternatively, perhaps I should have included the length L in some way, but in the turbulent equation, it doesn't seem to be present. So maybe the equation is dimensionally consistent when ΔT is in °F and h comes out in the right units.

But wait, another thought: Did I make any mistake in the Gr calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, I calculated Gr as 6.91e9, and then X as 4.8e9. That’s correct, so turbulent flow.

So h = 0.22*(220)^(1/3) ≈ 0.22 * 6.03 ≈ 1.3266 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that seems low. Let me think again. Because for natural convection, h is usually a small number, like 1-10 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), so this seems plausible.

Next, compute the area A. The plate is 7 inches square. So each side is 7 inches. Area is 7^2 = 49 in². Convert to square feet: 1 ft² = 144 in², so 49/144 ≈ 0.3403 ft².

So Q = h * A * ΔT.

h is 1.3266, A is 0.3403, ΔT is 220.

Compute Q: 1.3266 * 0.3403 * 220.

First, 1.3266 * 0.3403 ≈ 0.4513.

Then, 0.4513 * 220 ≈ 99.286 Btu/hr.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options are all around 5-14 Btu/hr. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for L. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, L is 7 inches, which is 0.5833 ft, correct. So that's okay.

Wait, but let me recheck the Grashof number calculation.

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

Wait, I think I messed up the units for ν. Let me double-check the value of ν.

At 650 R, the kinematic viscosity ν for air is approximately 0.0000177 ft²/s. Wait, but in the Grashof number, the units must be consistent. Let me think: g is ft/s², β is 1/R, ΔT is R, L^3 is ft³, ν² is ft^4/s².

So putting it together: (ft/s²) * (1/R) * R * ft^3 ) / (ft^4/s²) 

Wait, let's compute the units:

Numerator: ft/s² * (1/R) * R * ft³ → ft/s² * ft³ = ft^4/s².

Denominator: ft^4/s².

So overall, Gr is (ft^4/s²) / (ft^4/s²) ) → unitless, which is correct.

So my calculation seems correct. So Gr ≈ 6.91e9, leading to X=4.8e9, turbulent, so h≈1.3266.

But then Q is 1.3266 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 99 Btu/hr. But the options are way lower, like around 10.

Hmm, what's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in the h equation. Let me re-examine the equations.

Wait, the problem lists the equations as:

Heated horizontal plates facing upward:
h = 0.22ΔT^(1/3) for turbulent (X 2e7–3e10)
h = 0.27(ΔT/L)^(1/4) for laminar (X 1e5–2e7)

Wait, perhaps the units are different. Maybe the equation expects ΔT in °F but gives h in different units, perhaps Btu/(hr·in²·°F). Because if I'm calculating h as 1.3266 in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), but the area is in ft², and ΔT in °F, then Q is correct. But getting 99 Btu/hr is much higher than any option.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps I should have used the other equation. Wait, why did I assume the plate is facing upward? The problem says it's a horizontal plate. Wait, the orientation (facing upward or downward) affects the equation.

Wait, the plate is horizontal, but the configuration is 'heated horizontal plates facing upward'. So that's correct. So the turbulent equation is applicable.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the Grashof number calculation. Let me recalculate Gr more carefully.

Given that g = 32.174 ft/s².

β = 1 / T_avg = 1 / 650 R ≈ 0.00153846 R⁻¹.

ΔT = 220 R.

L = 7 inches = 0.583333 ft.

ν = 0.0000177 ft²/s.

Compute Gr:

Gr = (32.174) * (0.00153846) * (220) * (0.583333)^3 / (0.0000177)^2.

Compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator:

32.174 * 0.00153846 = approximately 0.04956.

0.04956 * 220 = 10.905.

0.583333^3 = approx (0.5833)^3 = 0.5833 * 0.5833 = 0.3403, then * 0.5833 ≈ 0.1986.

So 10.905 * 0.1986 ≈ 2.167.

Denominator: (0.0000177)^2 = 3.1329e-10.

So Gr = 2.167 / 3.1329e-10 ≈ 6.92e9.

X = Gr * Pr = 6.92e9 * 0.7 ≈ 4.844e9.

So in the turbulent range, which uses h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3).

But then Q comes to about 99 Btu/hr, which is way higher than the options. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the plate's area. Wait, the plate is 7 inches square, so area is 49 square inches. Convert to square feet: 49/144 ≈ 0.3403 ft². Correct.

Wait, let me check the equation again. The problem says for heated plates facing upward, the turbulent equation is h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3). But perhaps the units are different. Maybe ΔT is in Kelvin, but we've used Rankine, which is the same as Kelvin in size, so that's okay. Alternatively, perhaps the equation uses ΔT in °C, but no, the problem is in Fahrenheit.

Wait, maybe the 0.22 is in different units. Let me think about the units for h. If h is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), then the equation must be:

h = 0.22 * (ΔT [°F])^(1/3) → which would give h in (°F)^(1/3), but that's not correct for h's units. So perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is using ΔT in Kelvin, but that wouldn't resolve the unit conflict. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to consider that I might have miscalculated the heat transfer, perhaps using the wrong equation. Let me think again about the configuration.

Wait, the plate is horizontal, heated, facing upward. So the correct equation is h = 0.22*(ΔT)^(1/3) for turbulent flow.

But my result for Q is 99 Btu/hr, which is way higher than any option.
