Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the circumference of a dime. The dime has a radius of about 0.85 cm, and I need to find which of the given options is closest to the actual circumference. Hmm, right, I remember that the formula for the circumference of a circle is either 2πr or πd, where r is the radius and d is the diameter. 

Wait, so the radius is given as 0.85 cm. So the diameter would be twice that, right? So 0.85 cm multiplied by 2 is 1.70 cm. Okay, so the diameter is 1.70 cm. Then, using the circumference formula with the diameter, it would be π times the diameter. 

Let me write that down. Circumference C = π * d. So substituting the numbers in, that's π * 1.70 cm. I know that π is approximately 3.1416, so let me calculate that. 1.70 multiplied by 3.1416. Let me do the math step by step.

First, 1.7 times 3 is 5.1. Then 1.7 times 0.1416—let's see, 1.7 * 0.1 is 0.17, 1.7 * 0.04 is 0.068, 1.7 * 0.0016 is about 0.00272. Adding those together: 0.17 + 0.068 is 0.238, plus 0.00272 gives approximately 0.24072. So adding that to the 5.1 gives 5.1 + 0.24072 = 5.34072 cm. So the circumference is approximately 5.34 cm.

Looking at the options, option I is 5.34 cm. So that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check if I did everything right. Oh wait, the radius was 0.85 cm, so diameter is 1.70, yes. Using π as 3.1416, that gives 5.34. Yep, that's option I.

The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula \( C = 2\pi r \) or \( C = \pi d \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( d \) is the diameter. Given the radius of the dime is 0.85 cm, the diameter is \( 2 \times 0.85 = 1.70 \, \text{cm} \). Using \( C = \pi d \), the circumference is \( \pi \times 1.70 \approx 3.1416 \times 1.70 = 5.34 \, \text{cm} \). Among the options provided, the closest match is **5.34 cm**.
