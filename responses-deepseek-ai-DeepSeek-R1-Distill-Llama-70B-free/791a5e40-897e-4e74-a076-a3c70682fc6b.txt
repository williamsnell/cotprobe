Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with molecular formulas and empirical formulas yet. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the molecular formula of nicotine based on the percentages of each element and the molecular weight. 

Alright, the given data: molecular weight is 162.1, and the composition is 74.0% carbon, 8.7% hydrogen, and 17.3% nitrogen. Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Carbon is 74.0%, hydrogen 8.7%, and nitrogen 17.3%. 

So, the first thing I remember is that to find the molecular formula, I probably need to find the empirical formula first, and then see how it scales up to the molecular weight. The empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of atoms.

Let me think about the steps. First, convert the percentages to grams. Since the molecular weight is given as 162.1 g/mol, I can assume we have 162.1 grams of the substance. So, the mass of each element would be the percentage multiplied by that.

So, carbon: 74.0% of 162.1 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.740 * 162.1 = let's see. 0.7 * 162 is 113.4, and 0.04 * 162 is 6.48, so total around 119.88 g. Wait, maybe more accurately with a calculator, but since I'm simulating my thought process, I'll proceed.

Wait no, because in a 162.1g sample, each element's mass is:

Carbon: (74.0/100) * 162.1 = let's compute that. 74 * 162.1 = 74 * 160 is 11840, plus 74 * 2.1 = 155.4, so total 11840 + 155.4 = 11995.4, so 74.0 is 119.954 g. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 74% of 162.1 is 0.74 *162.1. Let me compute that correctly. 0.7 * 162.1 is 113.47, and 0.04 *162.1 is 6.484. So 113.47 +6.484=119.954 grams of C.

Hydrogen: 8.7% of 162.1 is 0.087 *162.1. Let's compute that: 0.08 *162.1 is 12.968, and 0.007 *162.1 is 1.1347. So total is 12.968 +1.1347=14.1027 grams of H.

Nitrogen: 17.3% of 162.1. So 0.173 *162.1. Let's compute this. 0.1 *162.1 is 16.21, 0.07*162.1 is 11.347, 0.003*162.1 is 0.4863. Adding them: 16.21 +11.347=27.557 +0.4863=28.0433 grams of N.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake. Because the percentages should add up to around 100%, but let me check: 74 +8.7+17.3 is 100%, so that's correct. So, all the masses add up correctly.

Now, the next step is to convert these masses into moles. Because moles are what gives us the ratio of atoms. So, using the atomic weights. The question says to use three significant figures for atomic weights, so I need to recall them.

Atomic weights (approximate, three sig figs):
Carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol,
Hydrogen (H) is 1.008 g/mol,
Nitrogen (N) is 14.01 g/mol.

So, moles of C: mass of C divided by atomic weight. So 119.954 g /12.01 g/mol. Let me compute this. 12.01 times 10 is 120.1, so 119.954 is approximately 9.98 moles. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

119.954 /12.01 = let's see. 12.01 * 9 = 108.09, 12.01 *10=120.1. So 9.98 is about 119.954/12.01. Let me compute it: 12.01 *9.98 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to just compute 119.954 ÷12.01. Let me do that: 12.01 goes into 119.954 how many times?

12.01 * 9 =108.09, subtract that from 119.954: 119.954 - 108.09=11.864.

Bring down a zero (adding decimal): 11.864 ÷12.01. 12.01 *0.9 is about 10.809, which is less than 11.864. So 0.9, subtract 10.809, remainder is 1.055.

Bring down a zero: 10.55 ÷12.01. 12.01 *0.8 is 9.608, so 0.8. Subtract: 10.55-9.608=0.942.

Bring down zero: 9.42 ÷12.01 → 0.7*12.01=8.407, so 0.7. Subtract: 9.42-8.407=1.013.

Bring down zero: 10.13 ÷12.01 is 0.8 (because 12.01 *0.8=9.608). So, 0.8. Subtract: 10.13-9.608=0.522.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, I could use an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let me compute 119.954 /12.01.

Wait, 12.01 * 10 =120.1. So 119.954 is slightly less than 10. So approximately 9.98 moles of C.

Similarly, moles of H: 14.1027 g /1.008 g/mol. Let's compute that. 1.008 *14=14.112. So 14.1027 is just a bit less than 14. So, moles of H is approximately 14.00 (but wait, wait, 14.1027 ÷1.008 → 14.00? Let me check: 1.008 *14 =14.112. So 14.1027 is 14.112 -0.0093. So, that would be 14 - (0.0093 /1.008). 0.0093 /1.008 is about 0.00923. So, 14 -0.00923=13.99077. So approximately 13.99 moles of H.

Moles of N: 28.0433 g ÷14.01 g/mol. Let's compute this. 14.01 *2=28.02. So 28.0433 is a bit more than 2. So, 28.0433 ÷14.01 → approximately 2.002 moles of N.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 14.01 *2=28.02. So 28.0433 is 28.0433-28.02=0.0233 over. So, that's 2 + (0.0233 /14.01). 0.0233/14.01 ≈ 0.00166. So ≈2.00166, which is about 2.002 moles.

So, now we have the moles of each element:

C: ≈9.98 moles,
H: ≈13.99 moles,
N: ≈2.002 moles.

Now, to find the empirical formula, we take the ratio of these moles, dividing each by the smallest number of moles. Here, the smallest is N, which is about 2.002, so approximately 2.

So, for C: 9.98 /2 ≈4.99 → close to 5.
H: 13.99 /2 ≈6.995 → close to 7.
N: 2.002 /2=1.001 → 1.

So the empirical formula would be C5H7N. Wait, but wait, perhaps I need to check if these numbers are close enough to whole numbers. Because 4.99 is almost 5, 6.995 is almost 7, and 1.001 is 1.

So the empirical formula is C5H7N. Hmm. But wait, let me think again. Could there be a mistake here? Because when I calculated the moles, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, because the molecular weight is 162.1 g/mol, and the sum of the moles times their atomic weights should equal 162.1. Let me check that.

Moles of C: 119.954 g /12.01 = approx 9.98. Moles of H: 14.1027 /1.008 ≈13.99. Moles of N:28.0433 /14.01 ≈2.002.

So total moles =9.98 +13.99 +2.002=25.972 moles? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each is in moles, but they are per mole of compound. So the molecular formula is about C5H7N per empirical formula unit, but perhaps that's not matching the molecular weight. Hmm.

Wait, no, the sum of the moles in the empirical formula times their atomic weights gives the empirical formula weight. The molecular weight is a multiple of that.

So, the empirical formula is C5H7N. Let me compute its formula weight: (5*12.01) + (7*1.008) + (14.01 *1).

5 *12.01=60.05, 7 *1.008=7.056, 14.01 *1=14.01. Sum is 60.05 +7.056=67.106 +14.01=81.116 g/mol.

Now, the molecular weight is 162.1 g/mol. So, 162.1 /81.116 ≈2. So the molecular formula is twice the empirical formula. So, 2*(C5H7N) = C10H14N2.

Wait a minute, but looking back at the options, let me see. Option J is C10H14N2. Option D is C10H12N4. Option A is C11H12N2. Hmm. So according to this calculation, the molecular formula is C10H14N2, which is option J.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes small decimal points can lead to a different ratio.

Wait, when I calculated the moles, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers. Let me recalculate the moles more accurately.

Moles of C:119.954 /12.01.

Let me compute 119.954 ÷12.01.

12.01 *9=108.09 → 119.954 -108.09=11.864.

Bring down a decimal, add a zero: 118.640.

12.01 *9 =108.09 → 108.09 from 118.640 leaves 10.55. So 9.9 so far.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to do 119.954 ÷12.01.

12.01 × 9.98 = ?

12.01 ×10=120.1 → 120.1 -12.01 ×0.02=120.1 -0.2402=119.8598. Which is very close to 119.954, so 9.98 would give 119.8598, but we have 119.954, which is 0.0942 higher. So 0.0942 /12.01 ≈0.00784. So 9.98 +0.00784≈9.9878, so approximately 9.988 moles of C.

Moles of H:14.1027 ÷1.008.

1.008 ×14=14.112 → but we have 14.1027, which is 14.1027-14.112= -0.0093. So it's 14 - (0.0093/1.008)=14-0.00923=13.99077 moles.

Moles of N:28.0433 ÷14.01. Let me compute 14.01 ×2=28.02. 28.0433-28.02=0.0233. So 2 + (0.0233/14.01)=2.00166 moles.

So, the moles are approximately:

C:9.988 → ~9.99
H:13.9908 → ~13.99
N:2.00166 → ~2.00

So, when finding the ratio, divide each by the smallest, which is 2.00.

C:9.99/2=4.995 →≈5
H:13.99/2=6.995 →≈7
N:2.00/2=1.

So the empirical formula is C5H7N.

As before, the empirical formula weight is 5*12.01 +7*1.008 +14.01*1 =60.05 +7.056 +14.01=81.116 g/mol.

Molecular weight is162.1 g/mol. So 162.1 /81.116 ≈2. So the molecular formula is (C5H7N)2 → C10H14N2.

Looking at the options, J is C10H14N2. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Suppose I have 162.1 g/mol, and each element's mass is 74% C, 8.7% H, and 17.3% N.

Another approach: Instead of assuming 162.1g, perhaps take 1 mole of the compound (molecular weight 162.1 g/mol), so each percentage is the mass in grams.

So, moles of C: (0.74 *162.1)/12.01 → let me compute that.

0.74 *162.1=119.954 g of C.

119.954 /12.01 → same as before, about 9.988 moles.

Moles of H: (0.087 *162.1)/1.008 → 14.1027 /1.008 ≈13.99.

Moles of N: (0.173 *162.1)/14.01 →28.0433 /14.01≈2.0017.

Same as before, so the ratio is same.

Wait, perhaps I can check if the molecular formula I found matches the molecular weight. C10H14N2.

Compute its molecular weight:

C:10 *12.01=120.1
H:14 *1.008=14.112
N:2 *14.01=28.02

Sum:120.1 +14.112=134.212 +28.02=162.232 g/mol.

Which is very close to the given molecular weight of 162.1. So that's a good match.

So the correct formula is C10H14N2, which is option J.

To determine the molecular formula of nicotine, we start with the given data: molecular weight = 162.1 g/mol, and the composition is 74.0% carbon (C), 8.7% hydrogen (H), and 17.3% nitrogen (N). The atomic weights used are: C = 12.01 g/mol, H = 1.008 g/mol, and N = 14.01 g/mol.

### Step 1: Calculate the mass of each element in 162.1 g of nicotine
- **Carbon**:  
  \[
  \text{Mass of C} = 0.740 \times 162.1 = 119.954 \, \text{g}
  \]
- **Hydrogen**:  
  \[
  \text{Mass of H} = 0.087 \times 162.1 = 14.1027 \, \text{g}
  \]
- **Nitrogen**:  
  \[
  \text{Mass of N} = 0.173 \times 162.1 = 28.0433 \, \text{g}
  \]

### Step 2: Convert the masses to moles
- **Moles of C**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of C} = \frac{119.954}{12.01} \approx 9.988 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- **Moles of H**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H} = \frac{14.1027}{1.008} \approx 13.9908 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- **Moles of N**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of N} = \frac{28.0433}{14.01} \approx 2.0017 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the simplest whole-number ratio (empirical formula)
The smallest number of moles is approximately 2.00 (from nitrogen). Divide each element's moles by this value:
- **C**:  
  \[
  \frac{9.988}{2.00} \approx 4.994 \approx 5
  \]
- **H**:  
  \[
  \frac{13.9908}{2.00} \approx 6.995 \approx 7
  \]
- **N**:  
  \[
  \frac{2.0017}{2.00} \approx 1.00085 \approx 1
  \]

Thus, the empirical formula is **C₅H₇N**.

### Step 4: Determine the molecular formula
The molecular weight of the empirical formula is:
\[
\text{Formula weight of C₅H₇N} = (5 \times 12.01) + (7 \times 1.008) + (1 \times 14.01) = 81.116 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
The molecular weight of nicotine is 162.1 g/mol. Divide this by the empirical formula weight:
\[
\frac{162.1}{81.116} \approx 2
