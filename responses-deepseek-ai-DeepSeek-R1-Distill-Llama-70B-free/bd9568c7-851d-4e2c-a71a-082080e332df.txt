Question:

Chromosomal sex in mammals has been shown to be strongly Y chromosome determined. How was this shown to be true?

Options:

A: The absence of a Y chromosome determines maleness in mammals
B: The presence of a Y chromosome usually determines maleness in mammals
C: The ratio of two X chromosomes to one Y chromosome determines maleness
D: The presence of an X chromosome determines maleness in mammals
E: The presence of an X chromosome in the absence of a Y chromosome determines maleness
F: The presence of a Y chromosome determines femaleness in mammals
G: The presence of a Y chromosome has no impact on the determination of maleness
H: The presence of multiple X chromosomes without a Y chromosome determines maleness
I: The presence of two or more Y chromosomes is required for maleness
J: The presence of an X chromosome determines femaleness in mammals

Okay, so I've got this question about chromosomal sex determination in mammals. Hmm, I remember that in humans and other mammals, sex is determined by the sex chromosomes. The common knowledge is that females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y (XY). But how exactly was this determined?

The question asks how it was shown that the Y chromosome determines maleness. I think it has something to do with the presence of a specific gene on the Y chromosome. Oh wait, I remember something about the SRY gene. SRY stands for sex-determining region Y, right? So this gene is crucial for triggering the development of testes in the embryo, which in turn leads to male characteristics.

But wait, how did scientists figure this out? I think there were experiments or observations where the presence or absence of the Y chromosome was linked to the sex of the individual. One case that comes to mind is when someone has an XXY configuration, like in Klinefelter syndrome. These individuals are usually male, which suggests that having an extra X doesn't make them female. Alternatively, if someone is missing the Y, like in Turner syndrome (XO), they are female, which supports the idea that the Y is important for being male.

I also remember a study where they took a mouse embryo and removed the Y chromosome, and it developed as female. Conversely, adding the Y (or the SRY gene) caused it to develop as male, even if the other chromosomes were XX. So this shows that the Y's presence is key.

Looking at the options now. Option B says "The presence of a Y chromosome usually determines maleness in mammals." That sounds correct because it's the Y that typically triggers male development. Option A says absence of Y determines maleness, which doesn't make sense because absence would mean female. Option D and E are about X determining maleness, which isn't right because X is associated with femaleness. Option F is the opposite, saying Y determines femaleness, which is wrong.

Option C talks about the ratio of X to Y, like the X:Y ratio determining maleness. I thought that was an older theory, but I think more recent understanding points to the presence of the Y, not the ratio. So C might not be correct.

So the correct answer should be B. The presence of a Y chromosome usually determines maleness in mammals.

The determination of chromosomal sex in mammals is primarily governed by the presence of specific sex chromosomes. In this case, the Y chromosome plays a critical role in determining maleness. The key evidence comes from the presence of the SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene on the Y chromosome, which triggers the development of testes and subsequent male characteristics in embryos. Studies have shown that the presence of the Y chromosome, or specifically the SRY gene, is essential for male development. For example, experiments where the Y chromosome was removed or added demonstrated that its presence determines maleness, even in cases where the other chromosomes are XX. Additionally, conditions like Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and Turner syndrome (XO) further support the idea that the Y chromosome is crucial for male development.

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: The presence of a Y chromosome usually determines maleness in mammals.**

This aligns with the understanding that the Y chromosome, through the SRY gene, is the primary determinant of maleness in mammals.
