Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the interest for three different loans. Hmm, okay, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but I think I can figure this out. 

The question mentions three people: Ms. Atlas, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Breakman. Each has a loan with different principal amounts, interest rates, and time periods. I need to calculate the interest each has to pay.

First, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time in years. But wait, I should make sure if it's simple interest or compound. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's simple interest.

Let's break it down for each person.

Starting with Ms. Atlas. Her loan is $1,800 at 6% for 60 days. Oh wait, the time is in days, but the formula uses years. So I'll need to convert 60 days into years. Since a year has 365 days, 60/365 is approximately 0.1644 years. 

So calculating her interest:
I = 1800 * 0.06 * (60/365)
Let me compute that. 1800 * 0.06 is 108. Then multiply by 60/365. 60 divided by 365 is roughly 0.1644. So 108 * 0.1644. Let me calculate that. 100 * 0.1644 is 16.44, and 8 * 0.1644 is about 1.315. Adding them gives approximately 17.755. So around $17.76. Looking at the options, let's see which one is close. Option I says $18 for Ms. Atlas. That's pretty close. Option J has $15, which is a bit off. So I'm leaning towards option I or maybe another. Wait, let me check other calculations to see if I made a mistake.

Next, Mr. Johnson. His loan is $2,400 at 5% for 3 years. That's straightforward. Using the same formula:

I = 2400 * 0.05 * 3
Calculating that: 2400 * 0.05 is 120. Multiply by 3 gives 360. So $360 interest. Now looking at the options. Let's see. Option I says Mr. Johnson's interest is $360. So that matches. Option J has $600, which is double, so probably wrong.

Now, Mr. Breakman. His loan is $7,000 at 6 and a half percent (which is 6.5%) for 4 years. So again, using the simple interest formula:

I = 7000 * 0.065 * 4
Let me compute that. 7000 * 0.065 = 455. Multiply by 4 gives 1,820. So $1,820 interest.

Wait, but let me double-check. 7,000 times 0.065 is 455 per year. Over four years, that's 455 *4 = 1,820. Yep, that seems right.

Now, looking back at the options. Ms. Atlas: $18 (approx), Johnson: $360, Breakman: $1,820. So which option has these numbers?

Looking through the options:

Option I: Ms. Atlas $18, Johnson $360, Breakman $1,820. That's exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer must be option I.

Wait, but let me check another option just in case. Option A: Ms. Atlas has $360, which is way too high. Option B: Ms. Atlas $21, which is a bit higher than my calculation. Option I is the only one that matches all three.

To calculate the interest for each loan, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

where \( I \) is the interest, \( P \) is the principal amount, \( R \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal), and \( T \) is the time in years. If the time is given in days, it is converted to years by dividing by 365.

### Calculations:

1. **Ms. Atlas**  
   - Principal (\( P \)) = $1,800  
   - Rate (\( R \)) = 6% = 0.06  
   - Time (\( T \)) = 60 days = \( \frac{60}{365} \approx 0.1644 \) years  
   - Interest (\( I \)) = \( 1800 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.1644 \approx 17.76 \), which rounds to **$18**.

2. **Mr. Johnson**  
   - Principal (\( P \)) = $2,400  
   - Rate (\( R \)) = 5% = 0.05  
   - Time (\( T \)) = 3 years  
   - Interest (\( I \)) = \( 2400 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 3 = 360 \), which is **$360**.

3. **Mr. Breakman**  
   - Principal (\( P \)) = $7,000  
   - Rate (\( R \)) = 6.5% = 0.065  
   - Time (\( T \)) = 4 years  
   - Interest (\( I \)) = \( 7000 \cdot 0.065 \cdot 4 = 1820 \), which is **$1,820**.

### Matching with Options:
- Ms. Atlas: $18  
- Mr. Johnson: $360  
- Mr. Breakman: $1,820  

The only option that matches all three values is **Option I**.
