Question:

A company with offices in five different countries is interested in estimating the proportion of its employees in favor of banning smoking on the office premises. It is known that the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures. Which of the following is an appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation, and why?

Options:

A: Convenience sample, because it's the easiest method to execute
B: Cluster sample, because it's cheaper and easier to conduct than a stratified sample
C: Multi-stage sample, because it allows the company to randomly select offices, then employees within those offices
D: Non-probability sample, because it doesn't require the company to know the overall population size.
E: Simple random sample, because this is the simplest sampling method
F: Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata—namely, five offices in five different countries
G: Cluster sample, because the population is divided into five clusters—namely, five offices in five different countries
H: Systematic sample, because the company can select every nth employee from each country
I: Quota sample, because the company wants to ensure that the sample accurately represents the population in terms of the proportion of employees from each country
J: Simple random sample, because this is the only method that gives unbiased results

Okay, so I've got this question about sampling techniques, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a company with offices in five different countries. They want to estimate the proportion of employees who favor banning smoking in the office. It's noted that views on smoking vary by country due to different social structures. So, the key point here is that the population isn't homogeneous—there's variation between countries.

The question is asking which sampling method is appropriate in this situation. Let's look at the options and think about what each method entails.

Option A: Convenience sample. That's when you pick people who are easy to reach. But that's not very reliable because it can introduce a lot of bias. Since the company has offices in different countries, a convenience sample might not capture the diversity across countries properly. Probably not the best choice here.

Option B: Cluster sample. Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting some clusters to sample. It's cheaper and easier, but it might not be the best fit here because the clusters (countries) have different social structures that affect the views on smoking. If the company only samples a few countries, the results might not represent all five, leading to potential bias.

Option C: Multi-stage sample. This method involves selecting clusters in stages. For example, first select some offices (clusters), then within those offices, select employees. This could work, but the question mentions that the company wants to consider the different countries, so maybe they want to ensure each country is represented properly.

Option D: Non-probability sample. This is more about not having a random selection, like convenience or quota sampling. But the question doesn't specify issues with knowing the population size. So I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

Option E: Simple random sample. This is where every individual has an equal chance of being selected. It's straightforward but might not account for the differences between countries. If the company just randomly selects employees without considering country clusters, there's a risk that some countries might be underrepresented or overrepresented, especially if their employee numbers vary a lot.

Option F: Stratified sample. Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) that are homogeneous within themselves but heterogeneous between each other. Here, the five countries could serve as strata. This way, the company can ensure that each country is adequately represented in the sample, which makes sense because the views vary by country. This would give a more accurate estimate of the proportion in each country and overall.

Option G: Cluster sample again, similar to option B. But again, since the countries are different, cluster sampling might not capture the diversity across all five countries unless all are included, which might not be practical.

Option H: Systematic sample. This is where you select every nth person from a list. It's systematic but doesn't necessarily account for the country differences. Like simple random, it might not ensure proportional representation from each country.

Option I: Quota sample. This is similar to stratified but uses non-random selection within the strata. It's a type of non-probability sampling where you ensure certain groups are represented, but it can introduce bias because the selection within each quota isn't random.

Option J: Simple random sample again, claiming it's the only unbiased method. While simple random is unbiased, it might not be the most efficient here because it doesn't account for the country-level variations. Stratified sampling can also be unbiased and might be more efficient in this case.

Putting it all together, the company's population is divided into five distinct groups (countries) where each group has different characteristics related to the issue at hand. To get accurate results, they should use a method that ensures each country is represented. Stratified sampling (Option F) allows them to do that by treating each country as a stratum. Alternatively, multi-stage sampling (Option C) could also work, but stratified is more directly applicable here because they can sample from each stratum (country) specifically, ensuring representation.

Wait, but Option C says multi-stage. Multi-stage involves selecting clusters first, then within clusters. So, for example, they might first select a few offices (countries) and then within those, select employees. But if they only select some offices, they might miss others. Since the company has exactly five offices in five countries, maybe using a stratified approach is better because it includes all strata (countries). So, stratified sampling would mean they take a random sample from each country, ensuring each is represented. That makes sense because it accounts for the fact that each country's social structures influence the views, and each is a separate stratum.

So the correct answer is F: Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata, each country's office. This way, each country is represented, and the sample reflects the varying views.

The company has offices in five different countries and wants to estimate the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking on office premises. Since the views on smoking vary significantly across countries due to differing social structures, the sampling method must ensure that each country is adequately represented to capture these variations accurately.

- **Option A (Convenience sample)**: This method is easy but introduces bias and does not guarantee representation across countries. Not suitable.  
- **Option B (Cluster sample)**: Divides the population into clusters (e.g., countries) and randomly selects some. However, it may not represent all five countries, leading to potential bias. Not the best choice.  
- **Option C (Multi-stage sample)**: Involves selecting clusters in stages (e.g., offices, then employees). While it could work, stratified sampling is more appropriate here because it ensures representation from all five countries.  
- **Option D (Non-probability sample)**: Does not involve random selection and is less reliable for accurate estimates. Not suitable.  
- **Option E (Simple random sample)**: Provides an unbiased sample but does not account for country-level differences, risking underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain countries. Not ideal.  
- **Option F (Stratified sample)**: Divides the population into strata (e.g., five countries) and ensures each stratum is represented. This method is most appropriate because it accounts for the diversity in views across countries and provides accurate estimates.  
- **Option G (Cluster sample)**: Similar to Option B, it may not capture all five countries unless all are included, which may not be practical.  
- **Option H (Systematic sample)**: Involves selecting every nth employee but does not ensure proportional representation across countries. Not suitable.  
- **Option I (Quota sample)**: Ensures representation of groups but involves non-random selection within strata, introducing potential bias. Less reliable than stratified sampling.  
- **Option J (Simple random sample)**: While unbiased, it does not account for country-level variations, making it less efficient than stratified sampling.  

The most appropriate method is **stratified sampling (Option F)**, as it divides the population into five strata (countries) and ensures each is represented, capturing the diversity in views and providing accurate estimates.
