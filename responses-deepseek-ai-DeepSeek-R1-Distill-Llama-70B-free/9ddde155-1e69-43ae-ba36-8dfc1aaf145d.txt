Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the spine, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me go through each option one by one and see what I remember about the spine.

First, the question is asking which of the following is true of the spine. The options are A through J.

Starting with option A: "Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine." I remember that Schober's test is related to measuring spinal flexibility, particularly in the lumbar region. It's used to assess the range of motion, especially in cases of suspected spinal issues like spondylitis. So this might be correct, but I'll keep it in mind and check the others.

Option B: "The lumbar spine is the upper part of the spine." Wait, no, that's not right. The spine is divided into cervical (neck area), thoracic (upper back), lumbar (lower back), sacrum, and coccyx. So the lumbar is the lower back, not the upper part. So B is incorrect.

Option C: "The spine is incapable of healing after injury." That doesn't sound right. While spinal injuries can be severe, the spine does have some capacity to heal, especially with treatment like bracing or surgery. So C is false.

Option D: "The human spine has 20 vertebrae." Hmm, I thought the normal spine has 33 vertebrae: 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral (fused), and 4 coccygeal. So 7+12+5=24 before the sacrum and coccyx. So D is wrong.

Option E: "Pregnancy is a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine." Wait, during pregnancy, the body undergoes various changes. I think the lumbar lordosis actually increases as the abdomen expands, leading to a more pronounced inward curve. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite, but I'm a bit fuzzy. I'll have to think more about this.

Option F: "The spine has no role in movement and balance." No, that's definitely not true. The spine is crucial for movement and balance; it's part of the musculoskeletal system, allowing flexibility and supporting the body's posture. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine." I remember that ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that causes the spine to fuse, leading to reduced mobility, not increased. So it's associated with hypomobility, making G false.

Option H: "Scoliosis is a condition where the spine curves to the left." Scoliosis is a sideways curvature, but it can curve either left or right. The most common form is a right thoracic curve, but the direction varies. So H is incorrect because it's not always to the left.

Option I: "Back pain is an uncommon complaint." Definitely not. Back pain is one of the most common complaints people have, especially lower back pain. So I is false.

Option J: "The cervical spine is the thickest part of the spine." Wait, the cervical spine is the neck region, which has the smallest vertebrae. The lumbar region is the thickest because it supports more body weight. So J is incorrect.

Now, going back to option E, I want to make sure. Pregnancy can cause changes in posture. The weight of the growing uterus can pull the pelvis and cause the lower back to arch more, which is an increase in lordosis. Wait, but the question says "loss of lordosis." So if E says that pregnancy causes loss, that would be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Lordosis is an inward curvature. During pregnancy, as the belly expands, the lower back might curve more inward to compensate, so the lordosis increases. So E would be incorrect because it's saying loss, which is the opposite.

Wait, but maybe in some cases, like when the abdominal muscles are weak, the posture might change differently. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe during pregnancy, the body adapts, and maybe the lordosis increases, so E is wrong.

So if E is wrong, then the correct answer must be A. Because looking back, most of the other options are clearly incorrect. A says Schober's test is for quantifying lumbar flexion, which I think is correct. Schober's test measures the range of lumbar spine flexion, so A is true.

The correct answer is **A**. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **A**: Schober's test is indeed designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine, making this statement correct.  
- **B**: The lumbar spine is the lower part of the spine, not the upper part, so this is incorrect.  
- **C**: The spine can heal after injury with appropriate treatment, so this is false.  
- **D**: The human spine has 33 vertebrae (7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 4 coccygeal), not 20, so this is incorrect.  
- **E**: Pregnancy often increases lumbar lordosis (inward curvature) rather than causing a loss of it, so this is false.  
- **F**: The spine plays a crucial role in movement and balance, making this statement incorrect.  
- **G**: Ankylosing spondylitis causes reduced mobility (hypermobility is the opposite), so this is false.  
- **H**: Scoliosis involves a sideways curvature of the spine, but it can curve in either direction, not exclusively to the left, so this is incorrect.  
- **I**: Back pain is a very common complaint, so this is false.  
- **J**: The cervical spine is the thinnest part of the spine, not the thickest, so this is incorrect.  

Thus, the only correct statement is **A**.  

Answer: A
