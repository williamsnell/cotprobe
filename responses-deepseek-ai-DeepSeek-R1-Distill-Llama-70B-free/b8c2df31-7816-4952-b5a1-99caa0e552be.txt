Okay, so I have this question about muscle contraction and the fuel sources during short-term intense activity like sprinting. Hmm, I remember that muscles use different energy sources depending on the type of exercise. Let me think.

I think when you do something that's high intensity but short duration, like sprinting, your body can't rely on oxygen as much because it's anaerobic. So the energy systems involved are probably the ATP-PC system and glycolysis. Wait, right, the phosphagen system and glycolysis. The ATP-PC provides immediate energy but only lasts a few seconds. Glycolysis breaks down glucose to produce ATP without oxygen.

But where does that glucose come from? I think the glucose for glycolysis in muscles comes from stored glycogen. So the muscle cells have glycogen stored within them. During intense activity, the muscle glycogen is broken down into glucose, which is then used anaerobically to produce ATP. 

Looking at the options, I see options H is plasma glucose. So that's blood sugar. But during intense exercise, I remember that the liver does release glucose into the blood, but that's more for maintaining blood sugar levels and maybe for the brain and other tissues. But muscle tissue, especially during high-intensity efforts, primarily uses its own glycogen stores because the blood can't deliver glucose quickly enough to meet the demand. 

So the main fuel is muscle glycogen. That's option C. Let me double-check. Plasma lactate (A) is a result of glycolysis, not a fuel source. Liver glycogen (B) would be broken down into glucose and released into the blood, but the muscles might not get it fast enough. Muscle protein (E) is broken down during prolonged exercise but not the main source here. Plasma free fatty acids (D) are used more in long-duration, low-intensity activities. Ingested carbs (F) wouldn't have been digested yet. Muscle triacylglycerol (G) is another fat source, but again, more for endurance. Plasma glucose (H) is used, but not the main source when you need quick energy. Plasma amino acids (I) are more about building or repairing tissues. Plasma triacylglycerol in VLDL (J) is for transporting fats, not directly used in muscles during sprinting.

So yeah, the answer should be C: Muscle glycogen.

The primary fuel for muscle contraction during short-term intense activity, such as sprinting, is derived from anaerobic energy systems. These include the ATP-PC system and glycolysis. Glycogen stored within the muscle cells is broken down into glucose, which is then utilized anaerobically to produce ATP. This process is rapid and does not rely on oxygen, making it ideal for high-intensity, short-duration efforts. While plasma glucose (H) is available, it is not the main fuel source during sprinting due to the slower delivery of glucose from the bloodstream. Other options, such as plasma free fatty acids (D) or muscle triacylglycerol (G), are more relevant to low-intensity, long-duration activities. Therefore, the main fuel source is muscle glycogen.

Answer: C
