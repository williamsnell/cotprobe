Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because probability can be tricky. Let me read it again.

The question is: Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive. What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?

Hmm, right. So the numbers are from 20 to 69, inclusive. That means the tens digits can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Wait, because 20 is included, so 2 is the first tens digit, and 69 is included, so 6 is the last. So the possible tens digits are 2,3,4,5,6. That's 5 different tens digits. 

Wait, but wait a second. 20-29 have tens digit 2, 30-39 have 3, and so on up to 60-69 with 6. So yes, 5 possible tens digits.

We are choosing 5 different integers. The question is about the probability that each has a different tens digit. So, since there are 5 tens digits, and we're picking 5 numbers, that would mean each number has a unique tens digit. So one from the 20s, one from the 30s, etc., up to the 60s.

So first, I need to find the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers from the given range. Then, find the number of favorable outcomes where each has a different tens digit. Then, probability is favorable divided by total.

Let me break it down.

Total possible numbers: from 20 to 69 inclusive. Let's count how many that is. 69 -20 +1 = 50 numbers. So 50 numbers in total.

Choosing 5 different ones. So the total number of possible combinations is C(50,5), which is 50 choose 5. Let me compute that value.

Wait, but I might not need to compute the exact numbers because the options have denominator 52969. Let me check what 50 choose 5 is. 50*49*48*47*46/(5*4*3*2*1) = (50*49*48*47*46)/(120). Let me compute that.

Wait 50C5 is 2,118,760? Wait no, let me compute. 50*49=2450, 2450*48=117,600, 117600*47=5,527,200, 5,527,200*46=254,251,200. Then divide by 120. 254,251,200 / 120 = 2,118,760. Oh wait, but the options have denominator 52,969. Hmm, that's different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the denominator.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of permutations instead of combinations? Or perhaps the approach is different.

Wait, looking at the answer options, the denominators are 52969. Let me compute 50 choose 5: 50C5 is indeed 2,118,760. Wait, but 52,969 is much smaller. Oh wait, maybe the question is about selecting with order? Like, permuting 5 numbers out of 50? Because 50P5 is 50*49*48*47*46 = which is 254,251,200. But 52969 is way smaller than that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute 50C5 again. 50! / (5! (50-5)!) = (50×49×48×47×46)/(5×4×3×2×1) = let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 50×49=2450, 2450×48=117,600, 117600×47=5,527,200, 5,527,200×46=254,251,200.

Denominator: 5×4=20, 20×3=60, 60×2=120, 120×1=120.

So 254,251,200 divided by 120 equals 2,118,760. So the total possible combinations is 2,118,760. But the options have 52,969 as the denominator. Hmm, so that's not matching. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about arranging the 5 numbers, so permutations, not combinations. Let me compute 50P5: 50×49×48×47×46 = let's compute that.

50×49=2450, ×48=2450×48=117,600. ×47=117600×47=5,527,200. ×46=5,527,200×46=254,251,200.

So 254,251,200 is the total number of permutations when selecting 5 distinct ordered integers. But the answer options have 52,969 as denominator. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says "5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive." So it's a combination, not permutation, because the order of selecting doesn't matter. So the total possible is 50C5=2,118,760. But the options have 52,969, which is way smaller. Hmm, perhaps I've misread the problem. Wait, perhaps the range is from 20 to 69 inclusive, but does that include 20 and 69? Yes, it says inclusive.

Wait another thought: wait 20 to 69 inclusive is 50 numbers. But let me make sure. 69-20=49, plus 1 is 50. So correct.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the number of favorable outcomes where each has a different tens digit, and then divide by the total possible, which is 50C5. So let's compute that.

Favorable outcomes: We need to choose 5 numbers, each with a different tens digit. Since the tens digits are 2,3,4,5,6 (5 digits), we need one number from each of the five decades.

Each decade has 10 numbers. For example, 20-29: 10 numbers. Same for 30-39, etc., up to 60-69.

So for each of the 5 decades, we can choose 1 number. The number of ways is (10 choices for 20s) × (10 for 30s) × (10 for 40s) × (10 for 50s) × (10 for 60s). So 10^5 = 100,000 ways. But wait, no, because the numbers have to be different, but since each is from a different decade, their tens digits are unique, so as long as each is chosen from their decade, the numbers are unique. Because you can't have two numbers from the same decade in this case.

Wait, but wait, in this approach, aren't we allowing the same unit digits? Like, 21 and 31 would both be allowed, even though they share the same unit digit. But the problem only requires different tens digits, not different unit digits. So that's okay.

So the number of favorable outcomes is 10^5 = 100,000.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the numbers have to be different. Wait, but each is from a different decade, so their tens digits are different, but their unit digits could be the same. But since we are choosing 5 different integers, having the same unit digit across different decades is allowed. So the count is indeed 10 ×10×10×10×10=100,000.

So the probability is 100,000 divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 numbers from 50, which is 50C5=2,118,760.

So probability = 100,000 / 2,118,760.

Let me compute that fraction. Simplify it.

Divide numerator and denominator by 40: 100,000 ÷40=2500, 2,118,760 ÷40=52,969.

So the fraction becomes 2500 / 52,969.

Looking at the options, option I is 2500/52969.

Wait, option I says 2500/52969, which matches.

But wait, let me double-check my reasoning. Because sometimes when I select, for example, the same unit digit in two different decades, but the question doesn't care about unit digits, only that the tens digits are different. So yes, 10 choices per decade, and 5 decades, so 10^5 =100,000 favorable.

Total possible combinations: 50C5=2,118,760, which is 50!/(5!45!)=2,118,760.

So the probability is 100,000 / 2,118,760 = 2500 / 52,969.

So the correct option is I.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that 5 different integers chosen randomly from the range 20 to 69 (inclusive) each have a different tens digit. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Total number of integers in the range**:  
   The range is from 20 to 69, inclusive, which gives \( 69 - 20 + 1 = 50 \) numbers.

2. **Total number of ways to choose 5 different integers**:  
   This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{50}{5} \), which calculates the number of ways to choose 5 items from 50 without regard to order.  
   \[
   \binom{50}{5} = \frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = 2,118,760
   \]

3. **Number of favorable outcomes**:  
   For the 5 numbers to have different tens digits, one number must be chosen from each of the 5 decades (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s). Each decade contains 10 numbers, so the number of favorable outcomes is:  
   \[
   10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^5 = 100,000
   \]

4. **Probability**:  
   The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:  
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{100,000}{2,118,760}
   \]  
   Simplifying this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 40:  
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{2500}{52,969}
   \]

5. **Matching the options**:  
   The simplified fraction \( \frac{2500}{52,969} \) corresponds to option **I**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: \frac{2500}{52969}**
