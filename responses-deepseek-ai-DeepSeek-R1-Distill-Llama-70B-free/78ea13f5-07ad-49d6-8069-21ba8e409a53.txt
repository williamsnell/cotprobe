Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A motorist was traveling at 5 miles per hour when she became distracted, and negligently tapped the rear of another vehicle. A passenger in the struck vehicle had a rare medical condition that made her highly vulnerable to any slight physical impact or intrusion. The minimal impact caused the passenger to lightly bump her shoulder against the door, which triggered her rare immunosuppressant disease to surface. The passenger became permanently incapacitated from the impact. She sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries. A physician submitted a report stating that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability. Has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles?

Options:

A: No, because the motorist could not have predicted that such a small impact would have such severe consequences.
B: Yes, because the victim in this case is called a "predictably unpredictable plaintiff."
C: No, because the passenger's rare medical condition was not directly caused by the motorist.
D: Yes, because the motorist is always responsible for any harm caused by their negligent actions.
E: No, because the medical report did not conclusively prove that the collision was the sole cause of the disability.
F: Yes, because the law holds the defendant liable for all injuries, regardless of their severity or nature.
G: No, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law.
H: Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff "as he finds her."
I: No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this torts question. Let's read it carefully. The question is about whether the plaintiff has a valid claim against the motorist who caused an accident. 

So, the motorist was going 5 mph and tapped the rear of another vehicle. The passenger had a rare medical condition making her very vulnerable to any impact. Even though the bump was light, it caused her shoulder to hit the door, triggering her disease and leaving her permanently incapacitated. She's suing the motorist. A doctor's report says the collision was a substantial factor in her disability.

The question is about whether she's stated a claim under the law. The options are A to J, but I'll focus on the given options.

I remember that in negligence, the key elements are duty, breach, causation, and damages. The motorist was negligent because she was distracted and tapped the car. So duty and breach are met.

Causation is the tricky part here. In tort law, the defendant is liable for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. But the plaintiff here had a rare condition. I think this relates to the "eggshell plaintiff" doctrine. I remember that the defendant takes the plaintiff as they find them. So even if the plaintiff is unusually vulnerable, the defendant is still liable for the full extent of the injuries caused, even if a normal person wouldn't have been as injured.

Looking at the options, option H says yes because the defendant takes the plaintiff as he finds her. That sounds exactly like the eggshell plaintiff rule. So H would be the correct answer.

Let me check the other options. Option A says no because the motorist couldn't predict the severe consequences. But the eggshell plaintiff doesn't require the defendant to predict the exact injury, just that the type of injury (like physical harm from a collision) is foreseeable. So A is incorrect.

Option B mentions "predictably unpredictable plaintiff." I'm not sure about that term. Maybe it's referring to the same idea, but I think H is a more accurate statement.

Option C says the condition wasn't directly caused by the motorist. But the collision triggered the disease, so it's a direct cause. Plus, the doctor's report says it's a substantial factor.

Option D says motorist is responsible for all harm, which is too broad. It's only for foreseeable consequences. So D is incorrect.

Option E says the report didn't prove it was the sole cause. But under tort law, it's about being a substantial factor, not necessarily the sole cause. So E is incorrect.

Option F says liable for all injuries regardless of nature. No, because it has to be a foreseeable type of injury. F is wrong.

Option G talks about psychosomatic reactions being malingering. But here, it's a physical reaction due to a medical condition, not psychological. So G is wrong.

Option I says motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries not psychological. Here, the injury is physical, and the harm was foreseeable (a collision causing some injury). So I is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is based on the "eggshell plaintiff" doctrine, which holds that a defendant is liable for the full extent of injuries caused, even if the plaintiff is unusually vulnerable. The motorist's negligence caused the collision, which triggered the passenger's rare condition, making the motorist responsible under this principle.

H
