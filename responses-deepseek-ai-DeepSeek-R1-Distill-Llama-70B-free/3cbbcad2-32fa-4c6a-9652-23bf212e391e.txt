Question:

A random sample of 25 men and a separate random sample of 25 women are selected to answer questions about attitudes toward abortion. The answers were categorized as "pro-life" or "pro-choice." Which of the following is the proper null hypothesis for this situation?

Options:

A: The proportion of "pro-life" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women.
B: The proportion of "pro-life" women is related to the proportion of "pro-choice" men.
C: The proportion of "pro-choice" women is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" men.
D: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is unrelated to the proportion of "pro-life" women.
E: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is greater than the proportion of "pro-choice" women.
F: The proportion of "pro-life" men is greater than the proportion of "pro-life" women.
G: The proportion of "pro-choice" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women.
H: The variables "gender" and "attitude toward abortion" are related.

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about hypothesis testing, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that there are two random samples: one of 25 men and another of 25 women. They're being asked about their attitudes toward abortion, and the answers are categorized as either "pro-life" or "pro-choice." The question is about identifying the proper null hypothesis for this situation.

Hmm, I remember that the null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or no difference. It's what you assume to be true unless the data provides evidence against it. So in most cases, the null hypothesis would state that there's no difference between the groups being compared.

The question is about the proportion of "pro-life" men compared to women. So they're probably testing whether the proportion of pro-life individuals is the same in both genders.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the proportion of pro-life men is the same as pro-life women. That sounds like a null hypothesis because it's stating equality.

Option B talks about pro-life women being related to pro-choice men. That seems more like a correlation or some other relationship, maybe not a null hypothesis for comparing proportions directly.

Option C says pro-choice women are the same as pro-life men. Wait, that's comparing different attitudes across genders. That might not be the direct comparison intended here.

Option D says pro-choice men are unrelated to pro-life women. Again, this is about relationships between different variables, not a direct proportion comparison.

Option E states that pro-choice men are greater than pro-choice women. That's an alternative hypothesis, not the null, because it's asserting a difference in a specific direction.

Option F is similar, saying pro-life men are greater than pro-life women. Again, that's a directional claim, which is more like an alternative hypothesis.

Option G claims pro-choice men are the same as pro-life women. That seems a bit off because it's comparing different attitudes between genders, not the same attitude.

Option H says gender and attitude are related. That sounds like a different type of hypothesis, maybe for a chi-square test, but the question is about proportions in two independent samples.

So the question is about comparing the proportion of pro-life between men and women. So the null hypothesis should state that these proportions are equal.

Looking back, option A says exactly that. So the correct answer should be A.

The null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or no difference, which is tested against the alternative hypothesis. In this scenario, the question involves comparing the proportion of "pro-life" men to "pro-life" women. The null hypothesis should therefore state that there is no difference between these proportions.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: States that the proportion of "pro-life" men is the same as the proportion of "pro-life" women. This aligns with the definition of the null hypothesis for this scenario.
- **Option B**: Suggests a relationship between "pro-life" women and "pro-choice" men, which is unrelated to the direct comparison of "pro-life" proportions.
- **Option C**: Compares "pro-choice" women to "pro-life" men, which is not the focus of the hypothesis test.
- **Option D**: Discusses a lack of relationship between "pro-choice" men and "pro-life" women, which is not relevant to the comparison of "pro-life" proportions.
- **Option E**: Claims that "pro-choice" men are greater than "pro-choice" women, which is a directional claim and part of the alternative hypothesis.
- **Option F**: States that "pro-life" men are greater than "pro-life" women, which is also a directional claim and part of the alternative hypothesis.
- **Option G**: Compares "pro-choice" men to "pro-life" women, which is not the focus of the hypothesis test.
- **Option H**: Suggests that gender and attitude are related, which is more relevant to a different type of test, such as a chi-square test.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it directly addresses the comparison of "pro-life" proportions between men and women in the context of the null hypothesis.

Answer: A
