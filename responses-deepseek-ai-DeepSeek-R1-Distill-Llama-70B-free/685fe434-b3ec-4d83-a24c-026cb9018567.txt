Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer and drag force on a plate. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says a plate is at 60°C and is being cooled by forced convection from an airstream. The air's velocity is 2 m/s, and the conditions are 27°C and 1 atm. We need to find the heat transfer per unit width for two distances (20 cm and 40 cm) and the drag force over 40 cm.

First, I think I need to calculate the heat transfer coefficient using the formula for forced convection over a flat plate. Oh right, the Nusselt number (Nu) comes into play here. The formula for laminar flow over a flat plate is Nu = 0.664 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3), where Re is the Reynolds number and Pr is the Prandtl number.

Wait, but what's the Prandtl number for air? I remember that at around 20-30°C, the Prandtl number for air is approximately 0.7. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I think it's around 0.7 to 0.71, so maybe 0.7 for simplicity.

Next, I need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re). Re is (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity. But wait, what's the kinematic viscosity of air at 27°C? I remember that at 20°C, it's about 1.5e-5 m²/s. Since temperature increases, the viscosity increases. Let me think, maybe at 27°C, it's around 1.6e-5 or 1.62e-5 m²/s. I should verify that. Oh wait, I think the kinematic viscosity (ν) for air at 27°C is approximately 1.62 x 10^-5 m²/s.

So for part (a), the distance (x) is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. The velocity (u) is 2 m/s. Re = (u * x) / ν. Plugging in the numbers: (2 * 0.2) / 1.62e-5. Let's compute that. 0.4 / 1.62e-5 = approximately 24,691. So Re is about 24,691. Wait, but wait—laminar flow is when Re is less than 500,000, right? So 24k is definitely laminar.

Now, calculating Nu using the formula: Nu = 0.664 * (Re)^(1/2) * (Pr)^(1/3). So Re is 24,691. The square root of that is sqrt(24,691) ≈ 157.1. Pr is 0.7, so its cube root is about 0.887 (since 0.7^(1/3) ≈ 0.887). So Nu = 0.664 * 157.1 * 0.887. Let me compute that: 0.664 * 157.1 is about 104.3, and then 104.3 * 0.887 ≈ 92.6. So Nu is approximately 92.6.

But wait, I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me recalculate: 0.664 * 157.1 = let's do 0.664 * 150 = 99.6, plus 0.664 * 7.1 ≈ 4.71, so total about 104.31. Then 104.31 * 0.887: 100 * 0.887 is 88.7, 4.31*0.887≈3.83, so total around 92.53. So Nu ≈ 92.5.

Then the heat transfer coefficient (h) is Nu * k / x, where k is the thermal conductivity of air. What's the thermal conductivity of air at around 27°C? I think it's about 0.0258 W/m·K. So h = 92.5 * 0.0258 / 0.2. Let me compute that: 92.5 * 0.0258 = approx 2.3865. Then divide by 0.2: 2.3865 / 0.2 = 11.9325 W/m²·K.

Wait, that seems high. Or is it okay? Let me think, yes, for convection coefficients, that's in the right ballpark. So h ≈ 11.93 W/m²·K.

Then, the heat transfer per unit width (q) is given by Newton's law of cooling: q = h * A * (T_plate - T_air). The area A is the area of the plate section. Since it's per unit width, the width is 1 m, and length is 0.2 m. So area A = 0.2 m² (width * length, but width is 1 m as unit width). Wait, no—wait, per unit width, so the area would be x (length) times 1 m (width), so 0.2 m².

Wait no, wait, the formula is q = h * A * ΔT. The temperature difference ΔT is 60°C - 27°C = 33 K.

So q = 11.93 * 0.2 * 33. Let me calculate that: 11.93 * 0.2 = 2.386. Then 2.386 *33 = about 78.7 W. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly 79. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of h. Nu was 92.53, k is 0.0258 W/m·K, and x is 0.2 m. So h = (92.53 * 0.0258) / 0.2. Let me compute that step by step. 92.53 * 0.0258 = let's compute 90 * 0.0258 = 2.322, 2.53 * 0.0258 ≈ 0.0652. So total is about 2.387. Then divide by 0.2: 2.387 / 0.2 = 11.935 W/m²·K. So that part is correct.

Then q = h * A * ΔT. A is 0.2 m². So 11.935 * 0.2 = 2.387; 2.387 * 33 = 78.71 W. So about 78.7 W. Looking at the options, option H is 78 W, option J is 79.5 W, option I is 80, and so on. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the Prandtl number is taken as 0.71, not 0.7. Let's recalculate with Pr=0.71. Then its cube root is (0.71)^(1/3). Let me calculate that: 0.71^(1/3) is approximately 0.89 (since 0.89^3 is about 0.704, which is close to 0.71). So let's try with Pr^(1/3)=0.89.

So Nu = 0.664 * sqrt(Re) * 0.89. Re is 24,691, so sqrt is ~157.1. So 0.664 * 157.1 = 104.3, then 104.3 * 0.89 ≈ 92.9. So Nu is about 92.9.

Then h = (92.9 * 0.0258) / 0.2. 92.9 * 0.0258 ≈ let's compute 90 * 0.0258 = 2.322, 2.9 * 0.0258 ≈ 0.07482. So total about 2.3968. Divide by 0.2: 11.984 W/m²·K.

Then q = 11.984 * 0.2 *33. 11.984 * 0.2 = 2.3968. 2.3968 *33 ≈ 79.1 W. So about 79.1 W. Hmm, that's closer to 79 W. Looking at the options, option E is 82, option H is 78, option I is 80, option J is 79.5. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of Re is incorrect. Let me double-check that. The velocity u is 2 m/s, x is 0.2 m, and ν is 1.62e-5 m²/s. So Re = (2 * 0.2) / 1.62e-5 = 0.4 / 1.62e-5 = 24,691. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for Nu isn't correct. Because sometimes for the average Nu, it's 0.664 Re^(1/2) Pr^(1/3). But wait, that's for the local Nu, right? Or is it the average?

Wait, no, the formula for the average Nusselt number for laminar flow over a plate is indeed Nu_avg = 0.664 Re^(1/2) Pr^(1/3). So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the thermal conductivity is a bit different. Let me check the value of k for air at 27°C. I think it's around 0.026 W/m·K. Let me try k=0.026.

So h = (92.9 * 0.026) / 0.2. 92.9 * 0.026 = let's compute 90 * 0.026=2.34, 2.9*0.026=0.0754. So total about 2.4154. Divide by 0.2: 12.077 W/m²·K.

Then q = 12.077 * 0.2 *33. 12.077 * 0.2 = 2.4154. 2.4154 *33 ≈ 79.68 W. Closer to 80 W. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let's compute the exact value step by step.

Compute Re:

u = 2 m/s, x = 0.2 m, ν = 1.62e-5 m²/s.

Re = (2 * 0.2) / 1.62e-5 = 0.4 / 0.0000162 = 24,691. So that's correct.

Compute Nu:

Nu = 0.664 * (Re)^0.5 * (Pr)^0.333.

Pr for air at 27°C: Let me check standard tables. At 20°C, Pr is about 0.703, and at 30°C, it's about 0.701. So at 27°C, probably around 0.702 or so. Let's take Pr = 0.702.

So Pr^(1/3) is (0.702)^(1/3). Let me calculate that. 0.9^3 is 0.729, which is higher than 0.702. So let's see: 0.89^3 is 0.7049, which is very close to 0.702. So cube root of 0.702 is approximately 0.89.

So Nu = 0.664 * sqrt(24,691) * 0.89.

sqrt(24,691)= sqrt(24,691)= Let me compute it accurately. 157^2 is 24,649. 158^2 is 24,964. So 157.1^2 = (157 + 0.1)^2 = 157² + 2*157*0.1 + 0.1² = 24,649 + 31.4 + 0.01=24,680.41. Which is close to 24,691. So sqrt(24,691)=approximately 157.1 + (24,691 -24,680.41)/(24,964 -24,680.41). The difference between 24,691 and 24,680.41 is 10.59. The denominator is 283.59. So 10.59 / 283.59 ≈ 0.0373. So sqrt is approx 157.1 + 0.0373 ≈ 157.1373.

So sqrt(Re) ≈157.137.

Thus, Nu = 0.664 * 157.137 * 0.89.

Compute 0.664 * 157.137 first.

0.664 * 157 = let me compute 0.6*157=94.2, 0.064*157=10.048. So total 94.2+10.048=104.248.

Then 0.664 * 0.137 = 0.091088.

So total 104.248 + 0.091088 ≈ 104.339.

Now multiply by 0.89: 104.339 * 0.89.

Compute 100 * 0.89=89, 4.339 *0.89≈3.862. So total 89 +3.862=92.862. So Nu ≈92.862.

Now, h = Nu * k_air / x.

k_air =0.0258 W/m·K (at 27°C, according to some tables), so:

h = (92.862 * 0.0258) / 0.2.

Compute numerator: 92.862 *0.0258.

Let me compute 90 *0.0258=2.322, 2.862*0.0258≈0.0739. So total ≈2.322+0.0739=2.3959.

So h = 2.3959 / 0.2 =11.9795 W/m²·K.

Then, q = h * A * (T_plate - T_air).

A is 0.2 m (length) * 1 m (width) = 0.2 m².

ΔT=60-27=33 K.

So q = 11.9795 *0.2 *33.

11.9795 *0.2 =2.3959.

2.3959 *33 = let's compute 2 *33=66, 0.3959*33≈13.065. So total≈66 +13.065=79.065 W.

So approximately 79.07 W, which is about 79.1 W. Looking at the options, option E is 82, option H is 78, option I is 80, option J is 79.5. Hmm, none exactly match, but maybe I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for Pr, k, and viscosity.

Let me check the exact value of kinematic viscosity at 27°C. Viscosity μ for air at 27°C is about 1.86e-5 kg/m·s. Kinematic viscosity ν= μ/ρ. At 1 atm and 27°C, air density ρ is approximately 1.177 kg/m³.

So ν= (1.86e-5) / 1.177 ≈1.581e-5 m²/s.

Wait, earlier I used ν=1.62e-5 m²/s, but perhaps the correct value is closer to 1.581e-5.

So let me recalculate Re with ν=1.581e-5.

Re = (2 *0.2) /1.581e-5 =0.4 /0.00001581≈25,306.78.

So Re is about 25,307.

That's a bit higher than before, which would make Nu a bit higher.

Compute sqrt(Re)=sqrt(25,307)= approx 159.13 (since 159^2=25,281, 160^2=25,600). 25,307-25,281=26, so 159 + 26/(2*159 +1) )=159 +26/319≈159.0815.

So sqrt(Re)=approx 159.08.

Now Nu=0.664 *159.08 *0.89.

Compute 0.664 *159.08 = let's compute 0.6*159.08=95.448, 0.064*159.08≈10.18. So total≈95.448+10.18=105.628.

Multiply by 0.89: 105.628 *0.89.

100*0.89=89, 5.628 *0.89≈5.005. So total≈89+5.005=94.005. So Nu≈94.005.

Now, h= (94.005 *0.0258)/0.2.

Compute 94.005 *0.0258:

94 *0.0258=2.4212, 0.005 *0.0258=0.000129. So total≈2.4212 +0.000129=2.4213.

Divide by 0.2: 2.4213/0.2=12.1065 W/m²·K.

Then q=12.1065 *0.2 *33.

12.1065*0.2=2.4213.

2.4213 *33=79.91 W. So about 80 W.

Looking at the options, option I is 80 W, 110 W, 0.006 N. Hmm, that's a possibility.

But wait, part (a) is 20 cm, which we've calculated to be about 80 W. Let's proceed to part (b), which is 40 cm, to see if it aligns.

For part (b), x=0.4 m.

Re = (2 *0.4)/ν =0.8 /1.581e-5≈50,553.

Then sqrt(Re)=sqrt(50,553)= approx 224.8 (since 224^2=50,176, 225^2=50,625). The exact value would be around 224.8.

So Nu=0.664 *224.8 *0.89.

Compute 0.664 *224.8: 0.6 *224.8=134.88, 0.064*224.8≈14.387. Total≈134.88+14.387=149.267.

Multiply by 0.89: 149.267 *0.89.

100*0.89=
