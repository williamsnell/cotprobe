Describe a procedure that can be used to determine inventory turnover rate.

Options:

E: Subtract the cost of goods sold from the average inventory
F: Multiply the cost of goods sold by the average inventory
G: Divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory
H: Subtract the average inventory from the cost of goods sold
I: Multiply the ending inventory by the cost of goods sold, then divide by the beginning inventory
J: Add the cost of goods sold to the average inventory

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about inventory turnover rate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that inventory turnover rate is a measure of how often a company sells and replaces its inventory. It's an important ratio because a high turnover might mean the company is selling its stock quickly, which is usually good. But if it's too high, maybe they're not keeping enough stock. On the flip side, low turnover could indicate slow-selling items or poor inventory management.

Wait, the formula for inventory turnover. I think it's something like Cost of Goods Sold divided by average inventory. Oh right, because COGS represents the cost of items sold during the period, and average inventory is the average amount of inventory held during that time. So, dividing COGS by average inventory would tell you how many times the inventory was sold and replaced.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches that. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Divide total inventory by COGS. No, that's the inverse of what I remember. It should be COGS divided by something, not the other way around.

Option B: Add beginning inventory to COGS, then divide by ending inventory. That doesn't make sense. Adding COGS to inventory? I think COGS is an expense, not an asset like inventory. So adding them doesn't fit.

Option C: Add COGS to ending inventory, divide by beginning. Again, adding COGS to inventory seems off. Plus, we're supposed to use average inventory, not just add and then something else.

Option D: Divide average inventory by COGS. Wait, no, because that would be average inventory / COGS, which is the inverse of what I thought. The correct way is COGS divided by average inventory.

Option E: Subtract COGS from average inventory. That doesn't make sense. Subtracting a cost from an asset value isn't right for this ratio.

Option F: Multiply COGS by average inventory. That would give a big number, but the ratio should be a division, not multiplication.

Option G: Divide COGS by average inventory. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. So this must be the correct one.

Option H: Subtract average inventory from COGS. No, that would give a negative number if COGS is less than average inventory, which doesn't make sense for a turnover rate.

Option I: Multiply ending inventory by COGS, then divide by beginning inventory. That seems complicated and unrelated to the formula I know.

Option J: Add COGS to average inventory. Again, adding a cost to an asset value doesn't fit for this ratio.

So putting it all together, the correct procedure is option G: Divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.

The inventory turnover rate measures how frequently a company sells and replaces its inventory. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory. This ratio helps assess the efficiency of inventory management.

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it divides total inventory by COGS, which is the inverse of the correct formula.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as adding beginning inventory to COGS and dividing by ending inventory does not align with the formula.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as adding COGS to ending inventory and dividing by beginning inventory is not the standard approach.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it divides average inventory by COGS, which is the inverse of the correct formula.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as subtracting COGS from average inventory is not relevant to the ratio.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as multiplying COGS by average inventory does not yield the turnover rate.
- **Option G**: Correct, as it involves dividing COGS by average inventory, which matches the formula for inventory turnover rate.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as subtracting average inventory from COGS is not meaningful for this ratio.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as the described calculation does not reflect the standard formula.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as adding COGS to average inventory is not the right approach.

The correct answer is **G: Divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory**.

Answer: G
