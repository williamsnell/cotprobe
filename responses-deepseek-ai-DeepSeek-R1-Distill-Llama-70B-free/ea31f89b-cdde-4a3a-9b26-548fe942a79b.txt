Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The reaction is CO2(g) + H2(g) ⇌ CO(g) + H2O(g). We start with one mole each of CO2 and H2, reacting at 825K. At equilibrium, the pressure of CO is 0.27 atm. We need to find the equilibrium constant K at this temperature.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium constant Kp is calculated using the partial pressures of the products and reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. The formula should be Kp = (P_CO * P_H2O) / (P_CO2 * P_H2). Right?

But wait, I need to figure out the pressures of all the substances at equilibrium. The initial amounts are one mole each, but some of them react to form products. Let me think about the changes.

Let's denote the change as x. So for each mole of CO2 consumed, one mole of CO and one mole of H2O are produced. Wait, but since the reaction starts with 1 mole each of CO2 and H2, and they react in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but in the problem, CO is measured as 0.27 atm at equilibrium. So I can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the other pressures.

Initial pressures: CO2 is 1 atm, H2 is 1 atm, CO is 0, H2O is 0. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial moles are 1 mole each, but are they in a container where the volume and temperature would determine the pressure? Oh, wait, the problem doesn't say anything about volume or total pressure, so I guess we can assume that the initial pressures are each 1 atm. Or wait, maybe the reaction is taking place in a system where the initial pressure of each reactant is 1 atm? Or perhaps initial moles are 1 each, but I might need to think in terms of changes.

Wait, the problem says one mole of CO2 is reacted with one mole of H2. I think that implies that the initial moles are 1 each, but the system might be in a container of fixed volume. But without knowing the volume, it's hard to convert moles to concentrations. Oh wait, but the problem gives the equilibrium pressure of CO as 0.27 atm. So maybe the initial pressures are 1 atm each, and the change is based on that.

So ICE table:

Initial:
[CO2] = 1 atm
[H2] = 1 atm
[CO] = 0
[H2O] = 0

Change:
CO2 decreases by x, H2 decreases by x, CO increases by x, H2O increases by x.

At equilibrium:
[CO2] = 1 - x
[H2] = 1 - x
[CO] = x
[H2O] = x

But wait, in the problem, at equilibrium, CO is 0.27 atm. So x is 0.27 atm.

Wait, but that would mean that x is 0.27. Then, substituting:

[CO2] = 1 - 0.27 = 0.73 atm
[H2] = 1 - 0.27 = 0.73 atm
[CO] = 0.27 atm
[H2O] = 0.27 atm

So, plugging into the Kp expression:

Kp = ( (0.27) * (0.27) ) / ( (0.73) * (0.73) ) 

Wait, let me calculate that. 0.27 squared is 0.0729, and 0.73 squared is approximately 0.5329.

So Kp = 0.0729 / 0.5329 ≈ 0.137.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.137. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I think I should double-check. Did I make any mistake in setting up the ICE table? Let me think again. The stoichiometry is correct—each reactant is consumed in 1:1 ratio, and each product is formed in 1:1. The initial pressures are 1 atm each, so the setup is correct.

Another way to think: the reaction is CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O. At equilibrium, CO is 0.27 atm. So that's the extent of reaction, x. So the other product H2O is also 0.27 atm.

So Kp = (0.27 * 0.27) / ( (1-0.27) * (1-0.27) ) = (0.27^2)/(0.73^2) = (0.0729)/(0.5329) ≈ 0.137. So yes, I think I did it right.

So the correct option is B: 0.137.

To determine the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) for the reaction:

\[
\text{CO}_2(g) + \text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons \text{CO}(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(g),
\]

we use the equilibrium constant expression:

\[
K_p = \frac{P_{\text{CO}} \cdot P_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}}{P_{\text{CO}_2} \cdot P_{\text{H}_2}}.
\]

### Step 1: Set up the ICE table
- **Initial pressures**: \( P_{\text{CO}_2} = 1 \, \text{atm} \), \( P_{\text{H}_2} = 1 \, \text{atm} \), \( P_{\text{CO}} = 0 \, \text{atm} \), \( P_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 0 \, \text{atm} \).
- **Change**: Let \( x \) represent the decrease in pressure of \( \text{CO}_2 \) and \( \text{H}_2 \), and the corresponding increase in pressure of \( \text{CO} \) and \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \).
- **Equilibrium pressures**:
  - \( P_{\text{CO}_2} = 1 - x \),
  - \( P_{\text{H}_2} = 1 - x \),
  - \( P_{\text{CO}} = x \),
  - \( P_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = x \).

### Step 2: Determine \( x \) from the problem
At equilibrium, the pressure of \( \text{CO} \) is given as \( 0.27 \, \text{atm} \). Thus, \( x = 0.27 \).

### Step 3: Calculate equilibrium pressures
Substitute \( x = 0.27 \) into the equilibrium expressions:
- \( P_{\text{CO}_2} = 1 - 0.27 = 0.73 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( P_{\text{H}_2} = 1 - 0.27 = 0.73 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( P_{\text{CO}} = 0.27 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( P_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 0.27 \, \text{atm} \).

### Step 4: Substitute into the \( K_p \) expression
\[
K_p = \frac{(0.27) \cdot (0.27)}{(0.73) \cdot (0.73)} = \frac{0.0729}{0.5329} \approx 0.137.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( K_p = 0.137 \) is **B: 0.137**.
