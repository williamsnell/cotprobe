Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I need to find three things: the convection coefficient for the water, the overall heat transfer coefficient, and the rate of heat transfer. Hmm, let me start by thinking through each part step by step.

First, part (a), finding the convection coefficient (h_i) for the water. I remember that for forced convection in a pipe, we use correlations like the Dittus-Boelter equation. The equation is something like Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33, where Nu is the Nusselt number, Re is the Reynolds number, and Pr is the Prandtl number.

Wait, but wait, I need to make sure about the properties of water. Since the bulk temperature is 65.6°C, I should probably use the properties of water at that temperature. Let me jot down the necessary properties:

At around 65°C, the density (rho) of water is about 980 kg/m³, the dynamic viscosity (mu) is around 0.00047 kg/(m·s), the thermal conductivity (k) is approximately 0.68 W/m·°K, and the specific heat (c_p) is about 4180 J/kg·°K.

Now, I need to calculate the Reynolds number. Reynolds number Re is (rho * v * D)/mu, where v is the velocity, and D is the diameter of the pipe. Oh wait, the pipe is a 2.54 cm schedule 40 steel pipe. I need to find the inner diameter. Hmm, I remember that for schedule 40 pipes, the nominal size is the same as the outside diameter. Wait, no, wait. For a 2.54 cm nominal pipe diameter, the schedule 40 has specific dimensions. Let me think: the outside diameter is 2.54 cm, but the inside diameter is smaller. I think the schedule 40 for a 1 inch (2.54 cm) pipe has an inside diameter of about 2.067 cm or something like that. Wait, 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so the inside diameter for schedule 40 is 2.067 cm (which is 0.067 inches when converted, since 1 inch is 2.54 cm, wait, no, wait, 2.067 cm is about 0.812 inches, no that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact value. Oh wait, maybe I can calculate it. Hmm, I remember that for a 1-inch schedule 40 pipe, the inner diameter is about 0.85 inches. Wait, 0.85 inches is about 2.16 cm. So D is 2.16 cm, which is 0.0216 meters.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the pipe's inner diameter can be found from the schedule number. Schedule 40 for a 1-inch pipe has an outer diameter of 1.315 inches, and the inner diameter is about 1.049 inches? No, wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing inches and cm. Let me maybe think in inches to avoid confusion. 1 inch nominal size. Schedule 40: the outer diameter is 1.315 inches, and the inner diameter is 1.049 inches for schedule 40. So D is 1.049 inches, which is about 2.66 cm. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1 inch is 2.54 cm. So 1.049 inches is about 2.66 cm. Hmm, but wait, the problem says the pipe is 2.54 cm, which is exactly 1 inch, so perhaps the inner diameter for schedule 40 is 0.0216 m or 2.16 cm. Wait, maybe I should confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps the exact inner diameter isn't crucial because I can use the formula for schedule 40 pipe dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe for this problem, the exact inner diameter might be given or I can calculate it. Alternatively, perhaps the pipe's inside diameter is D = 0.0216 m (2.16 cm). Wait, because the nominal size is 2.54 cm (1 inch), and schedule 40's inner diameter is about 0.0216 m. Perhaps that's correct.

So, velocity v is 2.44 m/s. So Re = (rho * v * D)/mu.

Plugging in the numbers: rho=980 kg/m³, v=2.44 m/s, D=0.0216 m, mu=0.00047 kg/(m·s).

So Re = (980 * 2.44 * 0.0216) / 0.00047.

Wait, let's compute numerator first: 980 * 2.44 = approx 2391.2. Then multiply by 0.0216: 2391.2 * 0.0216 ≈ 51.66. Then divide by 0.00047: 51.66 / 0.00047 ≈ 110,000 (approx). So Re is about 110,000. That's in the turbulent flow regime, so Dittus-Boelter equation applies (since it's for Re > 10,000).

Now, Prandtl number Pr for water at this temperature is around 2.99. Let me make sure: at 65°C, Pr is about 3. So I'll use Pr = 3.

So Dittus-Boelter equation: Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33.

So Re^0.8: 110,000^0.8. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 10^5 is 1e5, so 1e5^0.8 is 10^(5*0.8)=10^4=10,000. Wait, but 1e5 is 100,000, and 110,000 is a bit more. So 110,000^0.8 is a bit more than 10,000. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as (1.1e5)^0.8. Let me think in terms of logarithms. The logarithm of 1.1e5 is log(1.1) + 5. log(1.1) is about 0.0414. So log(1.1e5) = 5.0414. Multiply by 0.8: 5.0414 * 0.8 ≈ 4.0331. So antilog is 10^4.0331 ≈ 10^4 * 10^0.0331 ≈ 10,000 * 1.077 ≈ 10,770. So (1.1e5)^0.8 ≈ 10,770.

So, Re^0.8 ≈ 10,770.

Pr^0.33: Pr is 3, so 3^0.33. Let me compute that. 3^0.33 is the same as e^(0.33 * ln3). ln3 is 1.0986, so 0.33 * 1.0986 ≈ 0.3626. e^0.3626 ≈ 1.436.

So Pr^0.33 ≈ 1.436.

So Nu = 0.023 * 10,770 * 1.436.

Let me compute 0.023 * 10,770 first: 0.023 * 10,770 ≈ 247.71.

Then multiply by 1.436: 247.71 * 1.436 ≈ Let's see, 247 * 1.4 is 345.8, plus 247 * 0.036 is about 8.892, so total around 354.692.

So Nu ≈ 354.692.

Now, Nu is h_i * D / k, so h_i = (Nu * k)/D.

k is 0.68 W/m·°K, D is 0.0216 m.

So h_i = (354.692 * 0.68) / 0.0216.

Compute numerator: 354.692 * 0.68 ≈ 241.179.

Divide by 0.0216: 241.179 / 0.0216 ≈ 11,163 W/m²·°K.

Wait, but wait, perhaps my approximations are leading me a bit off. Let me recalculate the Re and the other steps more accurately.

Wait, the exact velocity is 2.44 m/s, and D is 0.0216 m, as per the schedule 40 1-inch pipe. Let me compute Re more accurately.

Re = (980 kg/m³ * 2.44 m/s * 0.0216 m) / 0.00047 kg/(m·s).

So numerator: 980 * 2.44 = let me compute this: 980 * 2 = 1960, 980 * 0.44 = 431.2, so total 1960 + 431.2 = 2391.2. Then multiply by 0.0216: 2391.2 * 0.0216 = let's compute 2391.2 * 0.02 = 47.824, 2391.2 * 0.0016 = approx 3.82592. So total 47.824 + 3.82592 ≈ 51.65 kg·m/(s²).

Wait, but Re is (kg/(m·s²)) * s, because denominator is mu in kg/(m·s). So units would be kg/(m·s) * m * s → kg/(m·s) * m·s → kg/(m) * m → dimensionless, which is correct.

Wait, so Re = 51.65 / 0.00047 ≈ 51.65 / 0.00047. Let me compute that: 51.65 / 0.00047 = let's see, 51.65 / 0.00047 = 51.65 * (1/0.00047) ≈ 51.65 * 2127.66 ≈ 51.65 * 2000 is 103,300, 51.65 * 127.66 ≈ approx 51.65 * 100=5,165, 51.65 * 27.66≈ ~1,427. So total approx 103,300 +5,165 + 1,427 ≈ 109,892. So Re ≈ 109,892, which is about 1.1e5, which matches my earlier approximation.

So Re^0.8: as before, around 10,770.

Pr^0.33: 3^0.33 ≈ 1.436.

Nu = 0.023 * 10,770 * 1.436 ≈ 0.023 * 10,770 = 247.71, then 247.71 * 1.436 ≈ 354.8.

So h_i = (354.8 * 0.68) / 0.0216.

Compute numerator: 354.8 * 0.68 = let's compute 350 *0.68=238, 4.8*0.68≈3.264, so total ≈241.264.

Divide by 0.0216: 241.264 / 0.0216 ≈ 11,165 W/m²·°K.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is (a) 10,697, option A is 11,000, and option D is 10,500. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the Dittus-Boelter equation uses Pr^(0.3) for heating, but wait, the problem states that the interior is cooled by water flow, so perhaps the exponent is different. Oh wait, no, the Dittus-Boelter equation is for both heating and cooling, but the exponent depends on the direction. Wait, the correct form for cooling (where the fluid is being cooled, so the temperature of the fluid is lower than the wall) might be Pr^(0.3), but I'm not sure. Let me double-check the equation.

Wait, the Dittus-Boelter equation is: for heating or cooling, when the fluid is in turbulent flow (Re > 10^4), it's Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^n, where n is 0.3 when the fluid is being cooled (since the property is based on the bulk temperature) and 0.4 when heated. Wait, no, maybe I've got that mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is 0.3 for cooling, 0.4 for heating. So in this case, since the water is cooling, taking heat from the pipe, so the fluid is being cooled, so Pr^0.3.

Wait, that's an important point I might have missed. So if the water is cooling, then the exponent is 0.3 instead of 0.33. Hmm, that would change the calculation.

So let me recalculate with Pr^0.3.

Pr is 3, so 3^0.3. Let me compute that. 3^0.3 is e^(0.3 * ln3) = e^(0.3 * 1.0986) = e^0.3296 ≈ 1.389.

So now, Nu = 0.023 * 10,770 * 1.389.

So 0.023 * 10,770 = 247.71 as before. Multiply by 1.389: 247.71 * 1.389 ≈ let's compute 247.71 * 1 = 247.71, 247.71 * 0.3 = 74.313, 247.71 * 0.08 = 19.8168, 247.71 * 0.009 ≈ 2.22939. Adding them up: 247.71 +74.313=322.023, +19.8168=341.84, +2.229=344.069.

So Nu ≈ 344.07.

Then h_i = (344.07 * 0.68) / 0.0216.

Compute numerator: 344.07 * 0.68 = let's see, 300 *0.68=204, 44.07*0.68≈30. (Wait, 40 *0.68=27.2, 4.07 *0.68≈2.77, so total 27.2+2.77=29.97). So total is 204 + 29.97 ≈ 233.97.

Divide by 0.0216: 233.97 / 0.0216 ≈ let's compute 233.97 /0.0216 ≈ 23397 /21.6 ≈ approx 1083. (Wait, 21.6 * 10,000 = 216,000, which is way too high. Wait, 23397 /21.6 = let me compute 23397 ÷21.6: 23397 ÷ 21.6 ≈ 1083. So 23397 ÷21.6 is 1083. So 233.97 ÷0.0216 = 10,830 W/m²·°K.

Wait, that's a higher value than before, but that's because I used a different exponent for Pr. Now, the options don't have 10,830, so perhaps I messed up the exponent. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick with the initial calculation, using 0.33 for the exponent.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the correct Dittus-Boelter equation. According to my notes, the Dittus-Boelter equation for turbulent flow is:

- For liquids, Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33

But wait, actually, the exponent for Prandtl number depends on whether the fluid is being heated or cooled. Some sources say that when the fluid is being heated, you use Pr^0.4, and when cooled, Pr^0.3. So in this case, since the water is cooling the pipe (the pipe is hotter), the fluid is being heated? Wait no, wait: the pipe's outer surface is where steam is condensing, releasing heat to the pipe, which then transfers heat to the water inside. So the water is being heated. Therefore, the correct exponent would be 0.4, perhaps?

Wait, no, that's conflicting. Let me clarify: The Dittus-Boelter equation is applicable for both heating and cooling, but the exponent on Prandtl number depends on whether the fluid is being heated or cooled. From what I remember, when the fluid is being heated (i.e., the wall is hotter than the fluid), the exponent is 0.4. When the fluid is being cooled (wall is colder than the fluid), the exponent is 0.3. So in this problem, the water inside is at 65.6°C, while the pipe's outer surface is at 107.8°C, so the inner pipe wall is hotter than the water, so the water is being heated. Therefore, the correct exponent would be 0.4.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So I think I made a mistake earlier by using 0.33. Let me correct that.

So, Pr = 3, and since the water is being heated, we use Pr^0.4.

So Pr^0.4 = 3^0.4. Let's compute that. 3^0.4 = e^(0.4 * ln3) ≈ e^(0.4 *1.0986) = e^0.4394 ≈ 1.552.

So now, Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.4 = 0.023 * 10,770 * 1.552.

Compute 0.023 * 10,770 = 247.71 as before.

Multiply by 1.552: 247.71 * 1.552 ≈ Let's compute 247.71 * 1.5 = 371.565, and 247.71 * 0.052 ≈ 12.88. So total ≈ 371.565 + 12.88 ≈ 384.445.

So Nu ≈ 384.445.

Then h_i = (Nu * k)/D = (384.445 * 0.68) / 0.0216.

Compute numerator: 384.445 * 0.68 ≈ 261.222.

Divide by 0.0216: 261.222 / 0.0216 ≈ 12,100 W/m²·°K.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A has (a) 11,000, option B has 10,697, option C has 12,000, so this would point to option
