Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Social Security question about Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. Let me see... Mr. Johnson is 62 and retired, with average yearly earnings of $5400. His wife is also 62. The question is, if he dies, what would Mrs. Johnson get? There's a lump-sum payment and a monthly benefit involved.

Hmm, I remember that Social Security has something called a lump-sum death payment. I think it's a one-time payment. I think it's $255, but I'm not totally sure. Oh wait, maybe it's only if certain conditions are met. Like, maybe the person has to have worked enough quarters or something. But Mr. Johnson is retired, so I guess he must have worked enough.

Then there's the monthly benefit for the widow. Since both are 62, I think that's before the full retirement age. Wait, what's the full retirement age now? I think for people born after 1954 or so, it's 67, but since they're 62, they're taking early retirement. So, when a spouse dies, the surviving spouse can get a reduced benefit based on the deceased's earnings.

I think the widow's benefit at 62 is 50% of the deceased's full retirement benefit. Wait, no, maybe it's 50% of the deceased's primary insurance amount. Or is it based on the deceased's benefit at the time of death?

Wait, let me think. If Mr. Johnson is 62 and retired, he's probably collecting reduced benefits. So his monthly benefit would be less than his full retirement amount. But when he dies, his wife can switch to the widow's benefit, which I think is based on his full Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), not the reduced amount he was getting.

Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

The average yearly earnings are $5400. I think that's used to calculate his Social Security benefit. Maybe using the formula where they take the average earnings, multiply by some percentage. But I'm not sure about the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps the average yearly earnings are used to find his monthly benefit. But I'm not exactly sure how. The formula for Social Security benefits is a bit complicated. Let me think: the formula is based on the 35 highest-earning years. They calculate the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), then apply the bend points.

But if his average is $5400 a year, that's $450 a month. Then the AIME would be calculated, but wait, that's probably not the right approach. Maybe it's just a simplified example.

Alternatively, perhaps the average yearly earnings are directly used to compute the benefit. Let's say that with $5400 yearly earnings, maybe his monthly benefit is calculated as 90% of the first $926, 32% of the next $6,002, etc. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. The question is about the lump sum and the monthly benefit after his death. So the lump sum is straightforward—probably $255. The monthly benefit would be based on his benefit, but since she's 62, she'll get a reduced widow's benefit.

Wait, the widow can receive the full amount of the deceased's benefit if she waits until her full retirement age, but since she's 62, it's reduced. What's the reduction for a widow at 62? I think it's 28.5% reduction, so she gets 71.5% of the deceased's PIA.

But wait, if Mr. Johnson was already collecting reduced benefits, does that affect the widow's benefit? Or does the widow's benefit get based on his full PIA regardless? Because I think the widow's benefit is based on the deceased's PIA, not the reduced amount he was receiving. So even if he took early retirement, the widow can get a higher amount based on his full PIA.

So, Mr. Johnson's PIA would be calculated based on his average earnings. Let's say his average indexed monthly earnings are $5400 a year, which is $450 a month. Then the Social Security formula is:

- 90% of the first $926 = 90% × 926 ≈ $833.40
- 32% of the next $6,002 (but wait, his AIME is only $450, so it's all in the first bracket)

Wait, no, because $450 is below $926. So his PIA would be 90% × 450 = $405 a month.

Wait, but the bend points are for the AIME. So if the AIME is $450, then PIA is 90% of 450, which is $405.

So the widow's benefit at full retirement age would be $405. But since she's 62, she gets 71.5% of that. Let me compute that.

405 × 0.715 = ?

Let's calculate:

400 × 0.715 = 286
5 × 0.715 = 3.575
Total ≈ 289.575 ≈ $289.58.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options have $289 as a monthly benefit. Hmm. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the average yearly earnings of $5400 is used to find his monthly benefit directly, without the bend points. Maybe it's a simplified example where the benefit is computed as (average earnings × 90%) divided by 12.

Wait, $5400 a year is $450 a month average. If PIA is 90% of that, it's 450 × 0.9 = 405, same as before.

So the widow's benefit at 62 is 71.5% of $405, which is about $289.58. But looking at the options, none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses a different percentage. Maybe the widow's benefit is 50% of the deceased's benefit, but that doesn't sound right. Or maybe the deceased's benefit was already reduced because he started collecting at 62.

Wait, if Mr. Johnson is 62 and collecting Social Security, his benefit is reduced. Let's see, for someone born in 1960 or later, the reduction for starting at 62 is about 30% of their PIA. So if his PIA is $405, then his monthly benefit at 62 is 70% of 405, which is 283.50.

But the widow's benefit is based on the PIA, not the reduced amount. So the widow can get up to 100% of the PIA if she waits until her full retirement age. But since she's 62, she's getting a reduced benefit.

Wait, the widow's benefit reduction at 62 is 28.5% of the PIA. So 71.5% of 405 is about 289.58, as I had before. But none of the answer options have that. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the average yearly earnings are used to compute the widow's benefit directly. So $5400 a year is $450 a month. If the widow's benefit is 50% of that, it's $225. But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is $255 and $206.80. Option I is $255 and $200.50.

Wait, the lump sum is definitely $255, I think. Because that's the standard lump sum death payment. So the first part of the answer is $255.

Now for the monthly benefit. If the husband's PIA is $405, and the wife is getting 71.5% of that at 62, which is around $289, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the widow's benefit is based on the deceased's actual benefit, not the PIA. So if Mr. Johnson's monthly benefit at 62 is 70% of $405, which is $283.50, then the widow's benefit would be that same amount. But if she's also 62, perhaps she can only get 50% of his benefit, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, no, the widow's benefit is calculated as a percentage of the deceased's PIA, not their actual reduced benefit. So if deceased's PIA is $405, and she's 62, she gets 71.5% of 405.

Wait, let me check. The widow's benefit is calculated as follows: if the surviving spouse is at full retirement age, they get 100% of the deceased's PIA. If they're 60, it's 71.5%, and if they're between 60 and FRA, it's higher than 60 but lower than 100. Wait, no, wait: the reduction for widow(er)'s benefits is as follows: 

- Widow(er) at full retirement age: 100% of PIA.
- Widow(er) at age 60: 71.5% of PIA.
- Widow(er) between 60 and FRA: increased proportionally.

Wait, but Mrs. Johnson is 62. So she would be getting more than 71.5%? Or is it less?

Wait, no, I think the reduction is less for being older than 60. Let me think again. The exact formula for the widow's reduction is based on the number of months before FRA. If FRA is 67, then at 62, she's 5 years early. Each year is 4.5% reduction, so 5 * 4.5 = 22.5% reduction. So she gets 77.5% of the deceased's PIA.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused between retirement benefits and widow's benefits. For retirement benefits, the reduction is 5/9 of 1% per month, which for 60 months (5 years) would be 30% reduction. But for widow's benefits, the reduction starts at age 60. So the reduction for widow's benefits is more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the widow's benefit is reduced by 19.6% per year, but that's not correct. Let me try to find the exact reduction. 

Upon checking, the widow(er)'s benefit is reduced by 4/9% for each month before the FRA, up to 28.5% maximum. So if the FRA is 67, and she's 62, that's 5 years early, which is 60 months. 60 months × 0.444% = 26.666% reduction. So she gets 73.333% of the PIA.

Wait, 4/9% is approximately 0.444% per month. So 60 months × 0.444% = 26.666% reduction. So the benefit is 73.333% of the PIA.

So if the PIA is $405, then 73.333% is 405 × 0.73333 ≈ 405 × 0.73 ≈ 295.35, about $295.35. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question assumes that the widow's benefit is simply 50% of the deceased's PIA, but I don't think that's correct. Or perhaps it's 50% of the deceased's actual benefit, which was reduced.

Wait, Mr. Johnson's PIA is $405. If he's taking it at 62, his benefit is reduced. The reduction for retirement benefits is calculated as 5/9 of 1% per month, up to 36 months. Wait, no, for each year before FRA, it's 5/9 of a percent per month. So for 5 years (60 months), the total reduction is 30% (5 × 12 × 5/9% = 60 × 0.0055555 ≈ 0.33333, or 33.333% reduction. So his benefit would be 66.666% of PIA. So 405 × 0.66666 = $270.

If the widow's benefit is based on his actual reduced benefit, then she would get 100% of that, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps she can take over his benefit, which is $270, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the calculation is different. Let me think again. The average yearly earnings of $5400 is perhaps used to compute the deceased's benefit. So the PIA is based on $5400, but maybe the formula is (average earnings × 0.9) / 12 or something.

Wait, $5400 a year is $450 a month. If PIA is 90% of that, it's 405. So the widow's benefit at 62 is, as per earlier calculations, around $289.58, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is just simplified, and the widow's benefit is $250.

Looking at the options, option D says $0 and $250. Option C says $255 and $250. Option I says $255 and $200.50.

Wait, the lump sum is definitely $255, so options E, I, and C have that. The monthly would be either $250, $206.80, or $200.50.

But earlier, I thought the widow's benefit at 62 would be about $289, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is either option C or E, but neither has that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the PIA. Maybe the average yearly earnings of $5400 is the PIA, not the AIME. So PIA is $5400 a year, which is $450 a month. Then the widow's benefit at 62 would be 71.5% of 450, which is 450 × 0.715 = 321.75. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the average yearly earnings being $5400 is the amount used to compute the deceased's benefit, and the widow's benefit is 50% of that. So 5400 × 50% = 2700 a year, which is $225 a month. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the widow's benefit is calculated as 50% of the deceased's PIA, which would be 202.5. But that's also not an option.

Wait, let me think about the options. The only options with the correct lump sum of $255 are options C, E, I. Now, the monthly benefits in these options are $250, $206.80, and $200.50.

Hmm, perhaps the correct monthly benefit is $250. Looking at option C: $255 and $250. But why would the monthly be $250? Maybe because the PIA is $500, and 50% is $250, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the average earnings are $5400 per year, which is $450 per month. The PIA is 90% of that, which is $405. Widow's benefit at 62 is 71.5% of $405, which is about $289. But that's not an option. So maybe the question is assuming that the widow's benefit is $250.

Alternatively, perhaps the monthly benefit is $250 because that's the spouse's benefit, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The lump sum is $255, which is correct. The monthly survivor benefit for a widow at 62 is 71.5% of the deceased's PIA. But if the deceased's PIA is $350, then 71.5% is $250.5. So the monthly benefit would be $250.50, which is option G's second part, but G's first part is $601.50, which is wrong.

Wait, option I is $255 and $200.50. So maybe the PIA is $280, 71.5% is about $200. Hmm, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the average yearly earnings of $5400 is the basis for the PIA as $5400 × some factor. Maybe it's $5400 × 0.9 = $4860 per year, which is $405 per month. Then, 71.5% is $289.58. But again, none have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different method. Maybe the monthly benefit is based on the average earnings directly, without the PIA calculation. So $5400 a year is $450 a month. The widow's benefit is 50% of that, which is $225. But no option has that.

Alternatively, perhaps the monthly benefit is $206.80, which is option E's second part. How would that happen?

Wait, $206.80 is 71.5% of about $289. Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option E: $255 and $206.80. But how?

Wait, maybe the PIA is $289.58, and 71.5% is $206.80. That doesn't make sense. Wait, 206.80 is 71.5% of what? Let's see, 206.80 / 0.715 ≈ 289.58. So that would mean the PIA is $289.58, which is based on average earnings of $322.32 a month. But the average is $450, so that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

If the average earnings are $5400 a year, the PIA is calculated using the Social Security formula. The formula is:

- 90% of the first $926 of AIME,
- plus 32% of the amount between $926 and $5,785,
- plus 15% of the amount above $5,785.

Wait, but the AIME is the average of the 35 highest years. If the average is $5400, then the AIME is $5400/12 = $450. So it's all in the first bracket. So PIA is 90% of 450 = 405.

So the PIA is $405. Widow's benefit at 62 is 71.5% of 405, which is 405 × 0.715 = 289.575 ≈ $289.58.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is using a different approach, perhaps the monthly benefit is based on the deceased's actual benefit, which is reduced because he started at 62.

So Mr. Johnson's benefit at 62 is 70% of PIA. So 0.7 × 405 = 283.5.

So if the widow's benefit is based on that, at her 62, perhaps she gets 100% of that, which would be 283.5. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the widow's benefit is 50% of his benefit, which would be 141.75, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I:
