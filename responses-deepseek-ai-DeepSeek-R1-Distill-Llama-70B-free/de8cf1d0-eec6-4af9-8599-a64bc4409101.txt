Okay, so I've got this economics question here about perfectly competitive markets and why firms would have to pay higher wages to get more workers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that in a perfectly competitive market, there are a lot of firms and a lot of workers. Each firm is a small player, so they can't really influence the market price on their own. They take the market price as given. So if a firm wants to hire more workers, they have to attract them somehow.

Wait, but why would they have to pay higher wages? I think in perfect competition, the wage is determined by the market forces of supply and demand. So if a firm wants more workers, maybe they have to offer a higher wage to get them because otherwise, workers would prefer to work elsewhere.

Oh right, the concept of equilibrium. In equilibrium, the quantity of labor supplied equals the quantity demanded. But if firms as a group want to hire more workers beyond the equilibrium point, they have to entice workers by offering higher wages. Because at the current wage, the quantity supplied is fixed. So to get more workers, they need to pay more to encourage more people to supply their labor.

So looking at the options, option C says "Firms must raise wages to attract more workers." That sounds right because if you're in a competitive market and you want more labor, you have to offer a higher wage to draw workers away from other firms or into the labor market.

Wait, other options. Option B is about workers forming a cartel, but that's more like a monopoly situation, not perfect competition. Option G is government mandate, which isn't part of the market forces here. Option H is a decrease in labor supply, which might cause firms to pay more, but the question is why firms as a group have to pay higher wages when they want more workers, not because of a supply decrease.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is C. Firms have to raise wages to attract more workers because in a competitive market, the wage is the mechanism to balance supply and demand. If they want more labor, they have to offer a higher wage.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms hiring labor must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers because the wage rate is determined by market forces. When firms as a group seek to hire additional workers beyond the current equilibrium, they must raise wages to attract more labor, as the existing wage rate only elicits the current quantity of labor supplied. This is why option C, "Firms must raise wages to attract more workers," is correct. Other options, such as workers forming a cartel (B) or a government mandate (G), are inconsistent with the dynamics of a perfectly competitive market.

Answer: C
