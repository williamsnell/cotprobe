Question:

A woman owned four beach houses. Each house had star-shaped windows. As the hurricane season was approaching, she hired a carpenter to build storm windows for the star-shaped and deliver them to the four houses. Because of the unique shape of the windows, the carpenter had to do all work by hand. The carpenter and woman signed a contract under which the carpenter promised to build and deliver the storm windows to all four beach houses within 30 days, and the woman promised to pay $8,000 ($2,000 per beach house) within one week of completion of the job. Two weeks after the contract was signed, a fire destroyed the carpenter's workshop, where he was storing all the completed storm windows before delivery. The carpenter then sent a letter to the woman that read:"The fire destroyed my equipment and inventory  including the storm windows, which had been completed and which were awaiting delivery. I am dead broke and cannot complete my obligations under the contract. " The woman then telephoned the carpenter and told him, "Unless you fulfill your contractual obligations, I will sue you!"In an action for specific performance to compel the carpenter to build and deliver the storm windows, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: not succeed, because the carpenter's workshop was destroyed before he could deliver the storm windows.
B: succeed, because the beach houses would suffer severe damage in the event a hurricane struck without the storm windows having been installed.
C: succeed, because the carpenter should have insured his inventory and equipment.
D: succeed, because the contract requires the carpenter to deliver the storm windows within a specified time frame.
E: not succeed, because the carpenter's performance would be excused by the unforeseeable act of God.
F: not succeed, because the woman did not pay the carpenter in advance.
G: succeed, because the carpenter's loss of the inventory would not excuse his duty of performance.
H: succeed, because the carpenter had completed the storm windows but failed to deliver them.
I: not succeed, because the carpenter's loss of inventory would render his performance impossible.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a woman who owns four beach houses. Each has star-shaped windows. She hires a carpenter to build storm windows for them and deliver to the four houses. They sign a contract where the carpenter agrees to build and deliver within 30 days, and the woman will pay $8,000 within a week of completion.

Then, two weeks after signing, a fire destroys the carpenter's workshop where all the completed storm windows were stored. The carpenter tells the woman he can't fulfill the contract because he's broke. The woman threatens to sue unless he complies.

The question is about whether the woman will succeed in an action for specific performance, meaning she wants the court to order the carpenter to build and deliver the windows.

I remember that specific performance is an equitable remedy usually granted when monetary damages aren't sufficient, like for unique items or real estate. But here, the issue is about whether the carpenter can perform, and if not, whether he's excused.

So, the carpenter had already built the windows but they were destroyed in the fire. The contract was to build and deliver. He can't deliver because they're destroyed, but can he rebuild them? Or is he excused from performing?

I think about the doctrine of impossibility or impracticability. For a contract to be excused due to impossibility, the event must make performance impossible, not just more difficult or expensive. Also, the impossibility must be due to an unforeseen event that's not the fault of the party seeking excuse.

In this case, the fire destroyed the workshop and inventory. Fires are typically considered acts of God (force majeure) if they're not caused by the party's own negligence. So, the carpenter might argue that the fire was an unforeseeable event beyond his control, making it impossible to perform.

But wait, the carpenter had already completed the storm windows, right? They were just awaiting delivery. So the fire destroyed the finished products. Does that mean he can't deliver, but does he have the capability to rebuild them? Or is the fire an unforeseen event that prevents him from performing?

Another point is whether the carpenter can mitigate by rebuilding the windows. But the problem states that he is "dead broke" and can't complete the obligations. So he might not have the funds to rebuild. But the question is more about legal excuse than ability to pay. If the destruction of the goods makes performance impossible, then he might be excused.

Alternatively, under UCC Article 2, if goods are destroyed, the risk of loss might fall on the buyer or seller depending on when the loss occurs. But this is a service contract as well, since he's building custom windows.

Also, the contract requires the carpenter to both build and deliver. If he can't deliver because they're destroyed, but he can't rebuild because he has no funds, does that make his performance impossible? Or is he obligated to find a way regardless?

Wait, the options mention some points. Let's look at them.

Option E says not succeed because the act of God (fire) makes performance excused. Option I says the same because loss of inventory makes it impossible.

Option G says the loss doesn't excuse his duty. Option H says the windows were completed but not delivered.

If the carpenter had completed the windows but couldn't deliver because they were destroyed, then maybe he's in breach for not delivering. But if he can't deliver because they're gone, and he can't rebuild, then maybe it's impossibility.

But wait, the contract is to build and deliver. If the windows were already built, then maybe he only needs to deliver. But the fire destroyed them, so delivery is impossible. So, could it be that he's excused because he can't deliver, or is he required to rebuild them?

If the windows were unique and already made, their destruction might make performance impossible. But if the contract requires him to build and deliver, he could perhaps build new ones. Unless he can't because he's broke and the workshop is destroyed.

I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The contract is to build and deliver within 30 days. He had two weeks, so maybe he had two more weeks left. But the fire occurred two weeks after signing, so 14 days in. He had 16 days left to build and deliver.

If the windows were completed, then he only needed to deliver. But they were destroyed, so he can't. But could he have built new ones in the remaining time? Probably not, since they're unique and he does everything by hand.

Alternatively, the fire might have destroyed his workshop, making it impossible to build more.

So, the key issue is whether the destruction of the windows and workshop is an unforeseen event that makes performance impossible, thus excusing the carpenter.

Option E says the performance is excused by an act of God. That sounds plausible. Option I says loss of inventory makes it impossible.

Now, the other options: Option G says loss of inventory doesn't excuse. But if the loss makes it impossible, then it should. So I think E or I could be correct.

Wait, but in contract law, the destruction of goods can sometimes be considered a supervening impossibility. If the goods were already completed and ready for delivery, their destruction may relieve the seller of the obligation to deliver, but sometimes under the UCC, the risk of loss may have passed to the buyer. But this is a services contract, not a sale of goods. So maybe common law applies.

Under common law, if specific performance is sought, the court might consider whether the carpenter can still perform. If the windows were destroyed, but the carpenter can rebuild them, then specific performance might be possible. But if he can't because he's broke and workshop destroyed, maybe it's impossible.

But the question is about the woman suing for specific performance. If the carpenter can't perform, the court won't order it because it's impossible.

So, the options are E, I, or G.

Option E: Not succeed due to act of God.

Option I: Not succeed because loss of inventory makes it impossible.

Option G says the loss doesn't excuse, so she would succeed.

Wait, but if the windows were completed, but destroyed, perhaps the carpenter can't deliver, but maybe he should have had insurance. That's option C, but that's about whether he should have insured, which isn't directly the issue here. The issue is impossibility.

So, the correct reasoning is that the destruction of the windows by fire, an act of God, makes performance impossible, so the carpenter's obligation is excused. Therefore, the woman can't get specific performance.

Looking at the options, E and I are the candidates. E is unforeseeable act of God, I is impossibility due to loss.

Which one is correct?

In the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261, an event may discharge a duty if it makes performance impossible, provided the event isn't the fault of the party and was unforeseen. A fire, unless caused by the carpenter's negligence, would be an act of God.

So, the correct answer would be E or I. But let me think again.

The question is about specific performance. If the carpenter can't perform because the windows are destroyed, but he could potentially rebuild them, maybe it's not impossible. But if he can't because he's broke and workshop destroyed, then it's impossible.

But the problem says he can't complete because he's dead broke. So, it's about his financial inability. But in contract law, inability to pay isn't an excuse. So, if he can't perform because he's broke, that's not a legal excuse. But if the goods were destroyed, making performance impossible, that's different.

Wait, the windows were completed but destroyed, so he can't deliver. He might argue that without the windows, he can't perform. But if the contract requires delivery, and the goods are destroyed, he can't deliver, so performance is impossible. But if the contract requires both building and delivering, perhaps he can build again. But if he can't because the workshop is gone, then it's impossible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the answer is E, that performance is excused by an unforeseeable act of God.

So, looking back at the options:

A: Not succeed, because workshop destroyed before delivery. But the contract was to build and deliver. He had built but couldn't deliver because they were destroyed. So maybe A is about impossibility.

E: Not succeed, because act of God.

I: Not succeed, because loss of inventory.

Wait, the loss of inventory (the windows) would make delivery impossible, but if he can rebuild, maybe not. But he can't rebuild because of the workshop and funds.

So, I think the correct answer is E, because the fire is an act of God, an unforeseen event, making performance impossible.

Wait, but in the UCC, if goods are destroyed, the risk depends on whether the buyer has taken possession or if the seller is a lost seller. But this is a service contract, so maybe not applicable.

Alternatively, under the doctrine of impossibility, the destruction of the subject matter (the windows) by an unforeseen event would discharge the obligation.

So, the correct answer is E or I.

Wait, the options: E says excused by act of God, I says because loss of inventory makes it impossible.

I think the more accurate reason is that the destruction of the windows (the specific goods) makes performance impossible, so the answer is I.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to think about whether specific performance is possible. If the carpenter can't deliver the windows because they were destroyed, but he could build new ones if he had the means, then is it impossible? Or is the impossibility only if the subject matter is unique and can't be replaced.

In this case, the windows are unique (star-shaped), so maybe the destruction makes them impossible to replace. But the carpenter could make new ones, but he can't because he's broke. But being broke isn't a legal excuse; it's a personal problem. So, the destruction of the windows might not be enough, unless it's impossible to rebuild them.

Wait, but the contract requires him to build and deliver. If he can't build because of the workshop, then it's impossible. But if he could build elsewhere, perhaps not.

But the question says he had to do all work by hand, implying that perhaps he needs his workshop. So, without it, he can't build, making performance impossible.

So, the answer would be E, act of God, or I, impossibility.

I think the correct answer is E: not succeed because the fire is an act of God, making performance excused.

Wait, but E says "unforeseeable act of God." So, the fire is such an event.

So, the answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the woman can compel the carpenter to perform the contract through specific performance after the carpenter's workshop and completed storm windows were destroyed in a fire. The key legal issue is whether the carpenter's performance is excused due to impossibility or an unforeseen act of God.

The contract required the carpenter to build and deliver custom storm windows within 30 days. The fire destroyed the completed windows and the workshop, leaving the carpenter unable to fulfill the contract. Under contract law, specific performance may be denied if performance becomes impossible due to an unforeseen event beyond the party's control, such as an act of God.

Option E suggests that the carpenter's performance is excused because the fire was an unforeseeable act of God. This aligns with the doctrine of impossibility, where an unforeseen event like a fire destroys the subject matter of the contract, making performance impossible. While the carpenter could theoretically rebuild the windows, the destruction of his workshop and his financial insolvency render it practically impossible. Thus, the fire serves as a valid excuse for non-performance.

Other options, such as I, focus on the loss of inventory rendering performance impossible. However, the more precise reasoning is that the fire, as an act of God, excuses the carpenter's obligation. Therefore, the woman's action for specific performance would not succeed.
