Okay, so I've got this problem about using the van der Waals equation to find the pressure of nitrogen gas when it's heated. Hmm, I remember that the van der Waals equation is an equation of state for real gases, which corrects for the ideal gas assumptions. The equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT, where a and b are constants specific to each gas.

The problem gives me the initial conditions: the gas is at 300 K and 100 atm, with a volume of 1.000 m³. The mass is 92.4 kg. They heat it to 500 K, and I need to find the new pressure.

Wait, so the volume is constant at 1.000 m³. So the process is isochoric, meaning V doesn't change. So V is 1 m³, which I'll need to convert because the a and b constants are given in dm³ units. Oh right, 1 m³ is 1000 dm³.

First, I think I need to find the number of moles of nitrogen. The mass given is 92.4 kg. Nitrogen's molar mass is about 28 g/mol. So I'll convert kg to grams: 92.4 kg is 92400 g. Moles = mass/molar mass = 92400 / 28. Let me calculate that: 92400 /28 = 3300 moles. Wait, 28 times 3300 is 92400, yes. So n = 3300 mol.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 28 * 3000 is 84,000. 28 * 300 is 8,400. So 3000 + 300 is 3300, which gives 84,000 + 8,400 = 92,400. Yes, exactly. So n=3300 mol.

So now, I need to find the pressure when T is 500 K, using the van der Waals equation. Rearranging the equation to solve for P.

The van der Waals equation is:

[P + a(n/V)^2] (V/n - b) = RT

Solving for P:

P = [RT/(V/n - b)] - a (n²/V²)

So I can plug in the values here.

First, compute V/n and V. V is 1 m³ = 1000 dm³. n is 3300 mol. So V/n = 1000 /3300 dm³/mol ≈ 0.3030 dm³/mol.

Then, subtract b, which is 0.0387 dm³/mol. So 0.3030 - 0.0387 = 0.2643 dm³/mol.

Next, compute RT. R is the gas constant. In units that work with the given a and b. Since a is in dm^6 atm /mol², and b in dm³/mol, I think R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/mol·K. So R=0.0821, T=500 K.

RT = 0.0821 * 500 = 41.05 dm³·atm/mol.

Then, RT divided by (V/n - b) is 41.05 / 0.2643 ≈ let's see, 41 / 0.264 is about 155. So approximately 155 atm. Let me do the exact division: 41.05 / 0.2643.

Let me calculate that: 0.2643 * 155 = 0.2643 *150=39.645, 0.2643*5=1.3215, total 40.9665. Which is very close to 41.05. So 155 approximately. So that term is about 155 atm.

Now, the second term is a*(n/V)^2. Let's compute n/V: n is 3300, V is 1000 dm³, so 3300/1000 = 3.3 mol/dm³.

So (n/V)^2 is (3.3)^2 = 10.89 mol²/dm⁶.

a is 1.352 dm^6 atm /mol². So a*(n/V)^2 =1.352 *10.89 ≈ let's see: 1.352 *10 is 13.52, 1.352*0.89≈1.203. So total ≈14.723 atm.

So putting it all together: P = 155 -14.723 ≈ 140.277 atm. So approximately 140 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 140 atm. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me redo the calculations more accurately.

RT: 0.0821 *500 = 41.05.

V/n = 1000/3300 = 0.303030... dm³/mol.

V/n - b = 0.303030 - 0.0387 = 0.26433 dm³/mol.

RT/(V/n -b) = 41.05 / 0.26433 ≈ let's use a calculator approach.

Compute 0.26433 *155 = 0.26433 *150= 39.6495, 0.26433 *5=1.32165. Sum is 40.9711. Which is a bit less than 41.05.

The difference is 41.05 -40.9711 = 0.0789. So how much more than 155 do I need?

0.26433 * x = 0.0789 → x ≈ 0.0789 / 0.26433 ≈ 0.298. So RT/(...) is 155.298, approximately 155.3 atm.

So first term is 155.3.

Second term: a*(n/V)^2.

n/V = 3300 /1000 = 3.3 mol/dm³.

(3.3)^2 = 10.89.

a =1.352 → 1.352 *10.89 = let me compute it accurately.

1.352 *10 =13.52.

1.352 *0.89 = ?

0.89 is 0.8 +0.09.

1.352 *0.8 = 1.0816.

1.352 *0.09 = 0.12168.

Sum: 1.0816 +0.12168 = 1.20328.

So total a*(n/V)^2 = 13.52 +1.20328 =14.72328 atm.

So P = 155.3 -14.72328 =140.5767 atm. Approximately 140.58 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:140 atm.

So the answer should be A.

To determine the pressure of nitrogen gas at 500 K using the van der Waals equation, we start with the given data:

- Initial temperature: $T_1 = 300 \, \mathrm{K}$, initial pressure: $P_1 = 100 \, \mathrm{atm}$, volume: $V = 1.000 \, \mathrm{m}^3 = 1000 \, \mathrm{dm}^3$, mass: $m = 92.4 \, \mathrm{kg}$.
- Molar mass of nitrogen: $M = 28 \, \mathrm{g/mol}$.
- Constants for nitrogen: $a = 1.352 \, \mathrm{dm}^6 \, \mathrm{atm} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-2}$, $b = 0.0387 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.
- Gas constant: $R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}$.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles
The number of moles of nitrogen is given by:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{92400 \, \mathrm{g}}{28 \, \mathrm{g/mol}} = 3300 \, \mathrm{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the van der Waals equation
The van der Waals equation is:

\[
\left(P + a \left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2\right) \left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right) = RT.
\]

Rearranging to solve for $P$:

\[
P = \frac{RT}{\frac{V}{n} - b} - a \left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\frac{V}{n}$ and $\frac{V}{n} - b$
Given $V = 1000 \, \mathrm{dm}^3$ and $n = 3300 \, \mathrm{mol}$:

\[
\frac{V}{n} = \frac{1000}{3300} \approx 0.3030 \, \mathrm{dm}^3/\mathrm{mol}.
\]

Subtracting $b$:

\[
\frac{V}{n} - b = 0.3030 - 0.0387 = 0.2643 \, \mathrm{dm}^3/\mathrm{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute $RT$
At $T = 500 \, \mathrm{K}$:

\[
RT = 0.0821 \times 500 = 41.05 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm}/\mathrm{mol}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute $\frac{RT}{\frac{V}{n} - b}$
\[
\frac{RT}{\frac{V}{n} - b} = \frac{41.05}{0.2643} \approx 155.3 \, \mathrm{atm}.
\]

### Step 6: Compute $a \left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2$
First, calculate $\frac{n}{V}$:

\[
\frac{n}{V} = \frac{3300}{1000} = 3.3 \, \mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{dm}^3.
\]

Then, square it:

\[
\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2 = (3.3)^2 = 10.89 \, \mathrm{mol}^2/\mathrm{dm}^6.
\]

Now, multiply by $a$:

\[
a \left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2 = 1.352 \times 10.89 \approx 14.723 \, \mathrm{atm}.
\]

### Step 7: Compute $P$
Substitute the results into the equation for $P$:

\[
P = 155.3 - 14.723 \approx 140.6 \, \mathrm{atm}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pressure of the gas at $500 \, \mathrm{K}$ is approximately $140 \, \mathrm{atm}$, which corresponds to option **A**.
