The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A patient in a hospital was placed in a wheelchair with his broken leg extended straight out in front of him. As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because the patient has not provided any evidence to prove that the hospital was responsible for the malfunctioning doors.
B: No, because the hospital has a duty to ensure the safety of all its patients and failed to do so in this case.
C: Yes, because the hospital was not aware of any defects in the doors.
D: Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.
E: Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. 
F: No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.
G: No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this legal question here. Let's see what it's about. The scenario is a patient in a hospital who was in a wheelchair with his broken leg extended. A nurse was pushing him through automatic doors at a normal pace, but the doors closed on his foot, causing injury. Then the nurse pulled back, which made the doors close tighter, causing more injury. The patient is suing the hospital for improper maintenance of the doors. But he hasn't provided any specific evidence of the hospital's neglect or conduct that caused the malfunction. The hospital is asking for summary judgment. The question is whether the court should grant that motion.

Alright, I need to think about the legal concepts here. Summary judgment is when a court decides that there's no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. So the court would grant summary judgment if the patient can't present enough evidence to support his claim.

The patient's claim is based on the hospital's alleged improper maintenance leading to the doors malfunctioning. But he hasn't provided specific evidence of any negligence on the hospital's part. So the hospital is arguing that without such evidence, the patient's case doesn't hold up.

I remember that in tort law, specifically negligence, the plaintiff must prove four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. The patient here is alleging that the hospital breached its duty by improperly maintaining the doors, leading to the accident.

But without evidence of specific neglect or maintenance issues, it's hard to prove breach. The mere fact that an accident happened doesn't automatically mean negligence. That's the res ipsa loquitur doctrine, right? Which means "the thing speaks for itself." But I think that applies when the accident is of a kind that wouldn't normally happen without negligence. Like if a surgery instrument is left inside a patient—that's clear negligence. But here, automatic doors closing on someone's foot might not be so clear.

Wait, but the doors are in a hospital, so maybe they have a higher duty of care. However, the patient hasn't shown any specific evidence of the hospital's failure. So even if res ipsa applies, the hospital could still rebut it by showing they maintained the doors properly.

Another angle is whether the nurse's action was a superseding cause. When the nurse pulled back, the doors closed tighter, causing more injury. If that's considered a superseding cause, it might break the chain of causation, making the hospital not liable. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here since the initial injury was the doors closing in the first place.

Option A says yes because no evidence of responsibility. Option D says yes because proof of accident alone doesn't establish negligence. That sounds relevant because the patient didn't provide specific evidence of the hospital's breach.

Option F says no because a jury could find a latent defect. But without evidence, can a jury just infer that? I think courts usually require more than just the accident happening to infer negligence, unless it's res ipsa.

Option G suggests res ipsa loquitur applies. But res ipsa requires that the accident be of a type that normally wouldn't happen without negligence, and that the defendant is in a better position to know what happened. Here, the doors malfunctioning—maybe, but the patient would still need to show that the hospital had exclusive control or something, which he hasn't.

So the hospital moved for summary judgment because the patient can't show breach. Without evidence of specific neglect, the hospital isn't liable. So the correct answer should be either A or D or G.

Wait, option D says proof of an accident alone doesn't establish negligence. That's a general principle. So the patient needs more than that, which he hasn't provided. So the court should grant summary judgment because there's no evidence of the hospital's breach.

So looking at the options, D seems correct. It's a general rule that an accident doesn't prove negligence. The patient hasn't provided evidence, so the hospital's motion should be granted.

The question revolves around whether the court should grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment in a case where a patient was injured by automatic doors. The patient alleges improper maintenance by the hospital but has not provided specific evidence of negligence or malfunctions causing the accident. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

To establish negligence, the patient must prove duty, breach, causation, and damages. While the hospital owes a duty of care, the patient has not shown a breach of that duty through specific evidence of improper maintenance or negligence. The mere occurrence of an accident does not automatically establish negligence, as the plaintiff must provide evidence of a specific act or omission by the defendant.

Option A correctly states that the patient has not provided evidence to prove the hospital's responsibility for the malfunctioning doors. Option D highlights the legal principle that proof of an accident alone does not establish negligence, which is directly relevant here. Without evidence of specific neglect or malfunctions, the patient's claim fails to meet the required standard.

Other options, such as res ipsa loquitur (Option G), are less applicable because the patient has not shown that the accident is of a type that would not normally occur without negligence or that the hospital had exclusive control over the doors. Similarly, the nurse's actions (Option E) or the possibility of a latent defect (Option F) do not provide a basis for denying summary judgment without supporting evidence.

The correct answer is based on the principle that an accident alone does not prove negligence, and the patient has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claim. Therefore, the court should grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment.
