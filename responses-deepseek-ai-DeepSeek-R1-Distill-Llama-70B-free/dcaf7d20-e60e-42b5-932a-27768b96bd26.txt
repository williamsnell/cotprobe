Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I need to calculate the pH of a 0.2 M NH3 solution. The Kb is given as 1.8e-5 at 25°C. Hmm, I remember that NH3 is a weak base, so it doesn't completely ionize in water. The reaction equation is NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-. Right, so the hydroxide ions from this reaction will determine the pH.

Wait, I think the first step is to set up the Kb expression. Kb is [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3]. Since the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.2 M, and initially, there's no NH4+ or OH-, I can let x be the amount that reacts. So, at equilibrium, NH3 is 0.2 - x, and both NH4+ and OH- are x.

So the Kb expression becomes (x^2)/(0.2 - x) = 1.8e-5. Now, I need to solve for x. I'm a bit confused about whether I can approximate 0.2 - x as 0.2. Let's see, if Kb is 1.8e-5, which is pretty small, so x should be much smaller than 0.2. So the approximation should hold.

So, x^2 ≈ (1.8e-5)(0.2) → x^2 = 3.6e-6. Taking the square root of both sides, x = sqrt(3.6e-6). Let me calculate that. The square root of 3.6 is about 1.897, and sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3. So x ≈ 1.897e-3 M. That's the concentration of OH- ions.

Now, to find pOH, I take -log[OH-]. So, log(1.897e-3) is... Let me think. Log(1.897)= about 0.278, so log(1.897e-3)= 0.278 -3 = -2.722. So pOH is 2.722.

Then, pH is 14 - pOH. 14 - 2.722 = 11.278. Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 11.28, which matches this. But wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Did I do the square root correctly?

Wait, let me recalculate x. x^2 = 3.6e-6 → x is sqrt(3.6e-6). Let me compute that more accurately. The square root of 3.6 is approximately 1.897, so 1.897e-3. So that seems right.

Wait, but sometimes I forget whether it's Kb or Ka. Oh wait, Kb is for base, so that's correct. Also, when I get the pOH, I subtract from 14 to get pH. That seems right.

But wait another thing. Some people might forget that the solution is in water and that autoionization of water could contribute, but at this concentration, it's negligible. So yeah, the pH should be about 11.28. Let me check the options again. Option G is 11.28. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. When I calculated x, I made the approximation that 0.2 - x ≈ 0.2. Let me check if that's a valid approximation. x is 0.001897, which is about 0.19% of 0.2. So yes, 5% rule says it's okay. So the approximation is valid. So I think my calculation holds.

So yeah, the pH is around 11.28. So the correct option is G.

To calculate the pH of a 0.2 M NH₃ solution with \( K_b = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), we start by recognizing that NH₃ is a weak base. The reaction is:

\[
\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^-
\]

Let the amount of NH₃ that reacts be \( x \). At equilibrium:
- \([ \text{NH}_3 ] = 0.2 - x\),
- \([ \text{NH}_4^+ ] = x\),
- \([ \text{OH}^- ] = x\).

The \( K_b \) expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[ \text{NH}_4^+ ][ \text{OH}^- ]}{[ \text{NH}_3 ]} = \frac{x^2}{0.2 - x}
\]

Since \( K_b \) is small, \( x \ll 0.2 \), so \( 0.2 - x \approx 0.2 \). Substituting, we get:

\[
x^2 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.2) = 3.6 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{3.6 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.897 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

This is the \([ \text{OH}^- ]\) concentration. The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[ \text{OH}^- ] = -\log(1.897 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.722
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 2.722 = 11.278
\]

Thus, the pH is approximately 11.28. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is **G**.
