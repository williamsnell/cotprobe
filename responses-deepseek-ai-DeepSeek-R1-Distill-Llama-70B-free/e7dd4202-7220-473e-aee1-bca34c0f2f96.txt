Okay, so I have this physics question here about the escape velocity from Earth's gravity. Hmm, I remember that escape velocity is the speed a rocket needs to break free from a planet's gravitational pull without further propulsion. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula and the value for Earth.

Wait, I think the formula is something like v equals the square root of (2GM/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of Earth, and R is the radius of Earth. Oh right, and that gives the escape velocity. But I don't remember the exact numbers for M and R, so maybe I can think of the commonly known value.

I recall that the escape velocity from Earth is around 11.2 kilometers per second. Oh wait, but wait, isn't that for escaping the solar system? Or is that for Earth itself? No, no, the escape velocity from Earth's surface is about 11.2 km/s. But wait, sometimes I get confused between that and orbital velocity. Oh right, orbital velocity is about 7.8 km/s, which is the speed needed to orbit the Earth, not escape.

So looking at the options, the choices are in meters per second. Let me check the options again. Option A is 1.12 × 10^4 m/s, which is 11,200 m/s or 11.2 km/s. That seems right. But wait, what about the other options? Option D is 8.48e3, which is 8,480 m/s. No, that's lower than the orbital speed, so probably not.

Wait, another thought: sometimes escape velocity is approximated as 11.186 km/s, which is close to 1.12e4 m/s. So option A is 1.12e4, which is 11,200 m/s. That matches what I remember.

But wait, could there be a mistake? Because sometimes people might confuse miles with kilometers, but the units here are meters. So 1.12e4 m/s is 11,200 m/s, which is correct.

I think option A is the right answer. So the rocket must be given approximately 11.2 km/s to escape Earth's gravity.

The escape velocity from Earth's gravitational field is the minimum speed a rocket must achieve to break free without further propulsion. This velocity is derived from the formula:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of Earth, and \( R \) is the radius of Earth. The commonly accepted value for Earth's escape velocity is approximately \( 11.2 \, \text{km/s} \), which corresponds to \( 1.12 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( 1.12 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \) is \( 11,200 \, \text{m/s} \), which matches the known escape velocity.
- Other options, such as \( 8.48 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s} \) (Option D), are too low and correspond to orbital velocities rather than escape velocities.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: \( 1.12 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \)**.
