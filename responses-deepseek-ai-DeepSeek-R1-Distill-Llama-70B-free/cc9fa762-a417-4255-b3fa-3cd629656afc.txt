Okay, so I have this question about normal goods, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that goods can be categorized as normal or inferior based on how their demand responds to changes in income. I think inferior goods are the ones where demand decreases when income increases. So normal goods must be the opposite.

Wait, so if income goes up, people buy more of normal goods. That makes sense because when people have more money, they can afford more things they want. So the demand increases with income. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says demand increases with income. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Demand is independent of income. No, that doesn't sound right. Normal goods are related to income changes.

Option B: Demand curve shifts downward with increase in income. That would mean less demand when income goes up, which sounds more like inferior goods. So B is probably not correct.

Option C: Consumption is socially unacceptable as income rises. That doesn't make sense. I don't think social acceptability is part of the definition.

Option D: Demand curve shifts upward with a decrease in income. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. If income decreases, demand goes up? That seems odd. I think normal goods would have demand decrease when income decreases, so D might not be right.

Option E: Demand varies directly with income. Directly means as income goes up, demand goes up. That fits what I was thinking earlier. So E looks promising.

Option F: Replaced by inferior goods as income increases. No, that's the opposite. Inferior goods are bought less when income rises, so F doesn't fit normal goods.

Option G: Demand decreases as income increases. No, that's inferior goods again. So G is wrong.

Option H: Demand doesn't change regardless of related goods' prices. That doesn't relate to income, so H is probably not it.

Option I: Only purchased by above-average income consumers. I don't think that's the definition. Normal goods are for everyone, depending on income level.

Option J: Demand increases only with a decrease in complementary goods' prices. That doesn't directly tie to income changes. So J isn't right.

So putting it all together, the correct answer must be E. Because normal goods have a demand that increases when income increases.

Normal goods are those whose demand increases as income rises. This is because, with higher income, consumers can afford more goods and services, leading to higher demand. Among the options provided, option E correctly states that the demand for normal goods varies directly with income, aligning with this definition.

Answer: E
