Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychology, specifically on avoidance-avoidance conflicts. Hmm, I remember that conflicts are a type of psychological stress. There are different kinds, like approach-approach, approach-avoidance, and avoidance-avoidance. 

An avoidance-avoidance conflict is when a person is faced with two options, both of which are unpleasant. So, they want to avoid both. I think the classic example is being stuck between two bad choices, like two tasks you don't want to do. 

What are the behaviors that result from this? I'm trying to recall. I remember that in such situations, people might feel stuck. Maybe they can't decide which option is less bad, so they procrastinate or put off the decision. Or perhaps they try to avoid the situation entirely, like leaving or withdrawing from it.

Wait, another thought—vacillation. That's when someone goes back and forth between the two options, unable to choose. Like being indecisive, switching between the two because neither is appealing. So vacillation might be one behavior. And the other could be trying to leave the field, meaning physically or mentally escaping the situation because both choices are negative.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H says "Vacillation and attempting to leave the field." That sounds right. 

Other options: Option A is indecision and escalation. Escalation doesn't quite fit here; that's more like increasing commitment, maybe in approach-approach or something else. Option B is aggression and passive resistance. I'm not sure that's tied directly to avoidance-avoidance. Option C is procrastination and denial. Procrastination could be part of it, but denial might be more of a defense mechanism. Option D is displacement and rationalization, which are defense mechanisms too. Option E: overcompensation and withdrawal. Overcompensation sounds more like a reaction to feelings of inadequacy. Option F: negotiation and compromise, which are problem-solving strategies, not really behaviors from conflict. G: acceptance and engagement—those are more positive, so probably not. I: submission and avoidance—submission is giving in, but I'm not sure. J: confrontation and resolution, which again are proactive, not avoidance.

So H is the best fit. The two behaviors are vacillating between the options and trying to escape the situation altogether.

The question asks about the two types of behavior resulting from an avoidance-avoidance conflict, which occurs when an individual faces two unpleasant options and seeks to avoid both. In such situations, the behaviors typically include vacillation, where the person oscillates between the two options without making a decision, and attempting to leave the field, which involves mentally or physically escaping the stressful situation.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Indecision and escalation—Escalation doesn't fit as it involves increasing commitment, not avoidance.
- **B**: Aggression and passive resistance—Not directly tied to avoidance-avoidance conflicts.
- **C**: Procrastination and denial—Procrastination is possible, but denial is more of a defense mechanism.
- **D**: Displacement and rationalization—These are defense mechanisms, not specific to this conflict.
- **E**: Overcompensation and withdrawal—Overcompensation is unrelated to avoidance conflicts.
- **F**: Negotiation and compromise—Proactive strategies, not avoidance behaviors.
- **G**: Acceptance and engagement—Positive actions, not relevant here.
- **I**: Submission and avoidance—Submission involves giving in, which isn't a typical response.
- **J**: Confrontation and resolution—Proactive, not avoidance-focused.

The correct answer is **H: Vacillation and attempting to leave the field**, as these behaviors align with the typical responses to an avoidance-avoidance conflict.
