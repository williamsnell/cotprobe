Okay, so I've got this pump problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem talks about two similar pumps. The first one has an impeller diameter of 6 inches, which is 0.5 feet, right? It runs at 1200 rpm and delivers 2 cfs (cubic feet per second) against a head of 16 feet. Then, there's a second pump that needs to discharge 40 cfs at 600 rpm. I need to find the diameter of this second pump and the head it will develop. The options are from A to J, each giving different diameters and heads.

I remember that for similar pumps, there are some scaling laws based on the principle of similarity. I think these have to do with the ratios of flow rate, head, and speed. Oh right, the affinity laws or similarity equations. They probably relate the different parameters in a way that when one changes, the others change proportionally.

So the main idea is that if two pumps are similar, their performance can be scaled using these ratios. The key equations I think are:

1. Flow rate (Q) is proportional to the product of the impeller diameter (D) and the rotational speed (N). So Q1/Q2 = (D1/D2) * (N1/N2).

2. Head (H) is proportional to the square of the rotational speed and the square of the diameter. So H1/H2 = (D1/D2)^2 * (N1/N2)^2.

Since both pumps are similar, the same ratios should hold. 

Wait, but wait, the second pump has a lower speed than the first. The first is 1200 rpm, and the second is 600. So that's half the speed. But the flow rate is higher, 40 cfs compared to 2 cfs. So maybe the diameter is larger? Because if speed is lower, but flow is higher, the diameter must compensate.

Let me write down the given data:

Pump 1:
D1 = 0.5 ft (since 6 inches is 0.5 ft)
N1 = 1200 rpm
Q1 = 2 cfs
H1 = 16 ft

Pump 2:
D2 = ? (need to find)
N2 = 600 rpm
Q2 = 40 cfs
H2 = ? (need to find)

So first, maybe I can find the ratio of flows, and then relate it to the ratio of (D * N). Then use that to find D2.

Let's compute the ratio Q2/Q1 = 40 / 2 = 20.

From the flow equation: Q1/Q2 = (D1/D2) * (N1/N2). So rearranging, D2 = D1 * (N1/N2) * (Q1/Q2). Wait, no, the equation is Q1/Q2 = (D1/D2) * (N1/N2). So solving for D2:

D2 = D1 * (N1/N2) * (Q1/Q2)^(1/1) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let's redo this. The equation is:

Q1/Q2 = (D1/D2) * (N1/N2)

So solving for D2:

D2 = (D1 * N1 * Q2) / (N2 * Q1)

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

So Q2/Q1 is 20. N1 is 1200, N2 is 600: N1/N2 is 2.

So Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1)

Wait, no. Let me get the equation correctly. The correct relation is:

Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1) * (efficiency ratio), but since they are similar, efficiency is same, so:

Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1)

Wait, no, I think I had it backward earlier. Because for the same pump, when you increase diameter or speed, flow increases. So the equation should be:

Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1)

Wait, no, that's not right. Because if the speed increases, flow increases. So it's proportional. Let me think: For a given pump, Q is proportional to D^3 and N? No, wait, let's get the correct equations.

Wait, the affinity laws say:

- Q is proportional to D * N (so Q varies with D and N)
- H is proportional to D² * N²
- Power (P) is proportional to D^3 * N^3 * rho, but maybe that's not needed here.

So for two similar pumps, the ratios are:

Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1)

H2/H1 = (D2/D1)^2 * (N2/N1)^2

So that's the correct approach.

So plugging in the numbers:

Q2/Q1 = 40 / 2 = 20.

So 20 = (D2/0.5) * (600/1200)

Simplify 600/1200 = 0.5.

So 20 = (D2/0.5) * 0.5.

Multiply 0.5 by (D2/0.5): 0.5 * (D2 / 0.5) = (D2 * 0.5 ) / 0.5 = D2.

Wait no, 0.5 * (D2/0.5) = (0.5/0.5) * D2 = 1 * D2 = D2.

So 20 = D2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would suggest D2 is 20 ft, but looking at the options, the maximum diameter there is 3 ft. So this must be a mistake.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the equation. Let me recheck the formula.

The correct formula is Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1).

So 20 = (D2 / 0.5 ft) * (600 / 1200).

600/1200 is 0.5.

So 20 = (D2 / 0.5) * 0.5.

Which simplifies to (D2 / 0.5) * 0.5 = D2 * (0.5 / 0.5) ) = D2 * 1.

So 20 = D2.

Wait, that would mean D2 is 20 ft, which is way larger than any of the options. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1)^3 * (N2/N1), but that doesn't make sense because the affinity laws for flow rate are Q proportional to D*N. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of specific speed or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the units. Let me double-check.

Ah, wait, the formula is correct. Q varies with D*N. So why is the diameter coming out to 20 ft? That's not possible because the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me try again.

Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1)

So 40 / 2 = (D2/0.5) * (600/1200)

20 = (D2/0.5) * 0.5

Multiply (D2/0.5) by 0.5: (D2 * 0.5) / 0.5 = D2.

So 20 = D2.

Wait, that's the same result. So that suggests D2 is 20 feet, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should invert the equation. Because if the speed is lower, but the flow is higher, maybe the diameter is larger, but perhaps the equation should be set up differently.

Wait, wait, let me invert the ratio. Maybe I should have Q1/Q2 = (D1/D2) * (N1/N2).

Wait, that's another way to write it. Let me try that.

So Q1/Q2 = (D1/D2) * (N1/N2)

So 2/40 = (0.5/D2) * (1200/600)

Simplify 2/40 = 0.05

1200/600 = 2.

So 0.05 = (0.5/D2) * 2

Multiply (0.5/D2) by 2: (0.5 * 2)/D2 = 1/D2

So 0.05 = 1/D2 → D2 = 1/0.05 = 20 ft.

Same result again. So that's the same problem. But none of the options have D=20 ft. So maybe I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the given units are in inches for the diameter. The first pump is 6 inches, which I converted to 0.5 ft. But perhaps I should have kept it in inches for the calculation and then converted back.

Wait, no, because the other pump's diameter options are in feet. So that shouldn't matter. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the flow rate isn't scaling directly as D*N, but perhaps it's D^2*N? No, I think for pumps, flow rate is proportional to D*N. So that's the standard.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a step. Let's think about the units. Flow rate is in cfs (cubic feet per second). So maybe I should check the dimensional analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the specific speed or other factors. Or maybe I'm confusing the formulas for different scaling conditions.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the problem isn't about similar pumps in terms of same efficiency, but perhaps it's about geometric similarity without considering efficiency. Hmm, but the question states that the pumps are similar, so their efficiencies would be the same, and thus the scaling laws should apply.

Wait, maybe I should think about the head first. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the specific speed and then find the diameter.

Wait, specific speed is a parameter defined as (N * sqrt(Q)) / (H)^(3/4). But I'm not sure if that will help directly. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read it.

Wait, the problem says the model pump has an impeller of 6 in. diameter. So that's 0.5 ft. The second pump is similar. So the scaling applies.

Wait, maybe I should compute the diameter using the flow scaling, then compute the head, and see which option matches.

Wait, let me try that again.

So, Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1)

So 40 / 2 = (D2/0.5) * (600/1200)

20 = (D2/0.5) * 0.5 → 20 = D2 * (0.5 / 0.5) → D2 = 20 ft. But none of the options have D=20 ft. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flow rate is related to the cube of the diameter times the speed? No, that doesn't sound right. Because I thought flow rate is proportional to D*N. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the correct scaling laws again. Oh wait! There are two different scenarios in pump scaling: when the speed is changed, but diameter remains the same, and when the diameter is changed, but speed remains the same. Or when both are changed.

Wait, the general scaling laws for similar pumps (geometrically similar) are:

Q2 / Q1 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1)

H2 / H1 = (D2/D1)^2 * (N2/N1)^2

Power2 / Power1 = (D2/D1)^3 * (N2/N1)^3

So that's correct. So perhaps I'm using the correct equations.

So then, why is the diameter coming out to 20 ft, which is not among the options. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the ratios. Let me try another approach. Let me express D2 in terms of D1, N1, N2, Q1, Q2.

From Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1)*(N2/N1)

So D2 = (Q2/Q1) * (D1 * N1) / N2

Plugging in the numbers:

Q2/Q1 = 40/2 =20

N1=1200, N2=600

So D2 =20 * (0.5 ft * 1200 rpm ) / 600 rpm

Calculating the numerator: 0.5 *1200 = 600

Denominator: 600

So 600/600=1

So D2=20 *1 =20 ft.

Same result again. So that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the original pump is model, and the second is a larger prototype, so perhaps the scaling is correct but the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, the problem states that the model pump delivers 2 cfs against a head of 16 ft. The second pump is similar, required to discharge 40 cfs at 600 rpm. So perhaps I should also check the head.

Wait, even if the diameter came out to 20 ft, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should compute the scaling factor for the diameter based on the flow and speed.

Let's denote 'k' as the scaling factor for diameter: D2 =k * D1.

Since D1 is 0.5 ft, D2=0.5k.

Now, the flow rate Q2 =k * (N2/N1) * Q1.

Wait, no, from the equation:

Q2 = (D2/D1) * (N2/N1) * Q1.

So Q2 = (k * D1 / D1) * (N2/N1) * Q1.

So Q2 =k * (600/1200) * 2.

Q2 =k * 0.5 *2 =k *1.

But Q2 is given as 40 cfs. So 40= k *1 →k=40.

So D2= 0.5 ft *40=20 ft.

Same result again. So this suggests that the diameter is 20 ft, which is not in the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the flow rate is being scaled differently. Let me think about it another way. Maybe the model is smaller, so the prototype is scaled up, but perhaps the model's speed is higher.

Wait, the model is running at 1200 rpm, while the prototype runs at 600. So the prototype's speed is half that of the model. So the scaling factor for the diameter would be sqrt((H2/H1)) * (N1/N2), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the head first. Let's see.

H2 = H1 * (D2/D1)^2 * (N2/N1)^2.

If I can express D2 in terms of D1 using the flow equation, perhaps I can find H2.

But since I can't find D2 because the calculation gives 20 ft, which isn't in the options, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the problem. Let's assume that the correct answer is among the options, so perhaps I can test each option to see which fits.

Let's take option B: Diameter 2.2 ft, Head 30 ft.

Compute Q2/Q1 = (2.2/0.5) * (600/1200) = (4.4) * (0.5) = 2.2.

So Q2= 2.2 * Q1 =2.2 *2=4.4 cfs, but the required Q2 is 40 cfs. So that's not matching. So option B is wrong.

Option H: D=2 ft, Head=45 ft.

Compute Q2/Q1 = (2/0.5) * (600/1200) =4 *0.5=2.

So Q2=2 *2=4 cfs. Not 40. So wrong.

Option E: D=2.4 ft, Head=55 ft.

Q2/Q1= (2.4/0.5) * (600/1200)=4.8 *0.5=2.4 → Q2=4.8 cfs. Not 40.

Option F: D=3 ft, Head=60 ft.

Q2/Q1= (3/0.5)* (0.5)=6 *0.5=3 → Q2=6 cfs. Not 40.

Option J: D=1.9 ft, Head=42 ft.

Q2/Q1= (1.9/0.5) *0.5=3.8 *0.5=1.9 → Q2=3.8 cfs. No.

Option I: D=1.5 ft, Head=40 ft.

Q2/Q1=3 *0.5=1.5 → Q2=3 cfs. No.

Option G: D=1.2 ft, Head=20 ft.

Q2/Q1=2.4 *0.5=1.2 → Q2=2.4 cfs. No.

Option C: D=1.71 ft, Head=46.8 ft.

Q2/Q1= (1.71/0.5)*0.5=3.42 *0.5=1.71 → Q2=3.42 cfs. Not 40.

Option A: D=1.8 ft, Head=36 ft.

Q2/Q1=3.6 *0.5=1.8 → Q2=3.6 cfs. No.

Wait, none of these options produce Q2=40 cfs. So this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, or perhaps the problem is intended to be solved differently.

Wait, maybe I should consider the fact that when scaling, the specific speed remains the same. Specific speed (Ns) is defined as Ns = (N * sqrt(Q)) / (H)^(3/4). For similar pumps, Ns should be the same.

So for Pump 1:

Ns1 = (1200 rpm * sqrt(2 cfs)) / (16 ft)
