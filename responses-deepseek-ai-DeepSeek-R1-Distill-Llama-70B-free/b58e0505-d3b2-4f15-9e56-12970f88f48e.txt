Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and Laplace's equation. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the setup is two concentric spherical shells. The inner sphere has a radius of 0.5 meters and is at 0 volts. The outer sphere has a radius of 2.0 meters and is at 100 volts. I need to find the electric field between them using Laplace's equation.

Wait, Laplace's equation is for regions where there's no charge, right? So the space between the two shells is charge-free, which makes sense because the problem doesn't mention any charge there.

I remember that for spherical symmetry, the solution to Laplace's equation in such cases depends only on the radial distance r. So the potential V only depends on r. The general solution for V in such cases is a sum of terms involving 1/r and r, but since the spheres are concentric, maybe it's simpler.

Wait, I think the potential V(r) in such a case is a linear function in terms of r. Or wait, no, maybe it's related to 1/r? Or perhaps a combination of the two. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that for a conducting shell, the potential inside the shell is constant, but in this case, the regions are between the shells. So, the potential varies with r. Since the inner sphere is at 0 and the outer at 100, the potential increases as we move outward.

Oh wait, so the general solution for V(r) when there's spherical symmetry and no charge is V(r) = A + B/r, where A and B are constants determined by boundary conditions. Right, that sounds familiar. Because the general solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates (with certain symmetry) is that form.

So applying the boundary conditions here. At r = 0.5 m, V = 0. At r = 2.0 m, V = 100 V.

So plug in r = 0.5:

0 = A + B/(0.5) => 0 = A + 2B. So equation (1): A = -2B.

At r=2.0 m, V=100:

100 = A + B/(2).

Substituting A from equation (1):

100 = (-2B) + (B/2) = (-4B/2 + B/2) = (-3B/2).

So solving for B:

100 = (-3B/2) → B = (100 * (-2)) /3 → B = -200/3 ≈ -66.666...

Now, substitute B back into equation (1) to find A:

A = -2*(-200/3) = 400/3 ≈ 133.333...

So V(r) = (400/3) - (200/3r).

Wait, let me double-check the substitution. So when r=0.5, V is 400/3 - (200/3)/(0.5) = 400/3 - 400/3 = 0, which matches. And at r=2, 400/3 - (200/3)/(2) = 400/3 - 100/3 = 300/3 = 100, which is correct.

So V(r) = (400/3) - (200)/(3 r).

But wait, I'm supposed to find the electric field E, which is the negative gradient of V. So in spherical coordinates, E(r) = -dV/dr * r̂.

So let's compute dV/dr. V(r) = 400/3 - (200/3) * r^(-1).

So dV/dr = 0 - (200/3)*(-1)* r^(-2) ) = 200/(3 r²).

So E(r) = - [200/(3 r²)] r̂.

Wait, but I thought E is the negative gradient, so E = - dV/dr. So dV/dr is 200/(3 r²), so E = -200/(3 r²) r̂.

Let me see the options. Let's look at the options:

Option D: E = [(-200)/(3r²)] r̂. That matches.

Other options: Option A is -100/r, which would be if V was proportional to 1/r, but in our case, V isn't like that. Option B is -100/(3 r²), which is half of what I have. Option C is -200/(2 r²) → -100/r². Hmm, no. Option D is -200/(3 r²), which matches.

So the correct answer is D.

To solve the problem, we use Laplace's equation for the region between two concentric spherical shells where the potential varies with radial distance \( r \). The general solution for the potential \( V(r) \) in such cases is:

\[
V(r) = A + \frac{B}{r},
\]

where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants determined by the boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are:

1. At \( r = 0.5 \, \text{m} \), \( V = 0 \, \text{V} \),
2. At \( r = 2.0 \, \text{m} \), \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \).

### Step 1: Apply boundary conditions
Using \( r = 0.5 \, \text{m} \) and \( V = 0 \, \text{V} \):
\[
0 = A + \frac{B}{0.5} \implies A = -2B. \tag{1}
\]

Using \( r = 2.0 \, \text{m} \) and \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \):
\[
100 = A + \frac{B}{2}. \tag{2}
\]

Substitute \( A = -2B \) from equation (1) into equation (2):
\[
100 = -2B + \frac{B}{2} \implies 100 = -\frac{3B}{2} \implies B = -\frac{200}{3}.
\]

Substitute \( B = -\frac{200}{3} \) back into equation (1) to find \( A \):
\[
A = -2 \left(-\frac{200}{3}\right) = \frac{400}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Write the potential \( V(r) \)
The potential is:
\[
V(r) = \frac{400}{3} - \frac{200}{3r}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the electric field \( E(r) \)
The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential:
\[
E(r) = -\frac{dV}{dr} \hat{r}.
\]

Differentiate \( V(r) \):
\[
\frac{dV}{dr} = 0 - \frac{200}{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{r^2}\right) = \frac{200}{3r^2}.
\]

Thus:
\[
E(r) = -\frac{200}{3r^2} \hat{r}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The correct expression for \( E(r) \) matches **Option D**:
\[
E = \frac{-200}{3r^2} \hat{r}.
\]

### Final Answer:
D
