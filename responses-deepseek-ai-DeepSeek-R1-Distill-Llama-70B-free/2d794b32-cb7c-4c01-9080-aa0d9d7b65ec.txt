Question:

A husband and wife were about to leave on vacation for one month. They thought it would be a great idea to have new carpeting installed in their home while they were away. They contacted a reputable carpeting company, which offered to do the job for $7,000. The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife. When the husband and wife returned from vacation, they were happy with the work and sent a check for $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposited the check. If the workman now seeks to recover for services he performed, he will

Options:

A: not recover, because he agreed to perform the services without a direct contract with the husband and wife.
B: recover against the husband and wife only.
C: not recover, because the carpeting company already received payment.
D: recover against the carpeting company only.
E: not recover, because he did not have a written contract.
F: recover against the carpeting company, because they were the ones who contracted him.
G: recover against the husband and wife, because they were the ultimate beneficiaries of his work.
H: not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.
I: recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company.
J: recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically involving third-party beneficiaries or something like that. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the situation is that a husband and wife hire a carpeting company for $7,000. They give the company their house keys and leave for a month. Then, the carpeting company realizes they're overbooked and can't finish the job. So they contact a workman they've used before and tell him about the job. The workman agrees to do the installation in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. 

When the couple returns, they're happy and send the $7,000 check to the carpeting company, which deposits it. Now, the workman is trying to get paid for his services. The question is, can he recover payment, and from whom?

Hmm. So, I remember that in contract law, if someone is a third-party beneficiary, they can sometimes enforce a contract even if they weren't directly a party to it. There are different types of third-party beneficiaries, like intended beneficiaries, incidental beneficiaries, etc. Intended beneficiaries are usually in the position to sue, while incidental ones cannot.

In this case, the carpeting company contracted with the husband and wife to do the work. They then subcontracted the workman. So, the workman is a subcontractor. Now, the question is whether the workman can recover from the original clients (husband and wife) or from the carpeting company.

Wait, I think that when a contractor subcontracts work, the subcontractor (workman) is typically paid by the contractor, not the client. The client's obligation is to the contractor, and the contractor's obligation is to the subcontractor. So the workman would look to the carpeting company for payment.

But wait, the workman's agreement was with the carpeting company, right? The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. Oh, wait, no—wait, let me read that again. 

The carpeting company told the workman about the job and he agreed to do it in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So, the workman's payment is supposed to come from the clients, not the carpeting company. Does that change things?

But then, the clients paid the carpeting company, who deposited the check. So, the carpeting company got the $7,000. So, the workman did the job, but the payment went to the carpeting company. So, is the workman out of luck?

Wait, but the workman's agreement was with the carpeting company, I think. Let me recheck the facts. The workman was contacted by the carpeting company, and agreed to do the job in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So, the workman's expectation was that the husband and wife would pay him. But the husband and wife paid the carpeting company instead.

So, perhaps the workman is a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the husband and wife and the carpeting company. Because the carpeting company agreed to do the work for $7,000, and then assigned or subcontracted it to the workman, with the understanding that the workman would be paid by the clients.

Alternatively, maybe the workman is an intended third-party beneficiary because the contract was made with the intention that he would perform the work and be paid by the clients.

Wait, but in general, the rule is that the party who contracts with the client is responsible for paying the subcontractors. Unless the client agrees to pay the subcontractor directly, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, another angle: the husband and wife had a contract with the carpeting company. The carpeting company then hired the workman to fulfill their obligation. So the workman is a subcontractor. The subcontractor's right to payment is from the contractor (carpeting company), not the client. Unless the client has directly agreed to pay the subcontractor, which they didn't here.

But in this case, the workman's agreement was that he would be paid by the husband and wife. So his contract was with the carpeting company, but the payment was supposed to come from the clients. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the workman is an assignee of the carpeting company's right to payment. But assignment requires that the assignor (carpeting company) transfers their right to receive payment to the workman. Did that happen here?

Alternatively, maybe the workman is a third-party beneficiary of the original contract between the husband and wife and the carpeting company. Let me think: the original contract was for the carpeting company to install carpeting for $7,000. The carpeting company then subcontracts to the workman. The workman's payment is from the husband and wife.

Wait, but the husband and wife paid the carpeting company, so the carpeting company has the $7,000. The workman didn't get paid, so he wants to get paid. But he didn't have a contract with the husband and wife; he had a contract with the carpeting company, where he agreed to do the work in exchange for payment from the clients.

So perhaps the workman can't recover from the clients because they already paid the carpeting company. Alternatively, maybe he can recover from the carpeting company because the carpeting company has the money.

Wait, but the workman's agreement was with the carpeting company. Let me re-read the facts: "The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife." So the workman's payment was supposed to come from the husband and wife, but the husband and wife paid the carpeting company. So the workman might have a problem because the husband and wife have already fulfilled their obligation by paying the carpeting company.

Alternatively, maybe the workman can sue the carpeting company, arguing that the carpeting company is obliged to pay him because he did the work on their behalf.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline the possible scenarios.

Scenario 1: The workman is a subcontractor. The carpeting company is his employer. So the workman should look to the carpeting company for payment. But the carpeting company received the $7,000 from the clients. So if the workman can show that the carpeting company was supposed to pay him from that money, then he can sue the carpeting company.

Scenario 2: The workman is a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the clients and the carpeting company. The contract was that the carpeting company would install the carpet for $7,000. The clients paid, and the workman did the work. So perhaps the workman can claim that he's the intended beneficiary and can sue the clients for payment.

But wait, the clients already paid the carpeting company. So if the workman sues the clients, they might say, "We already paid the contractor, it's not our responsibility to pay the subcontractor."

I think generally, subcontractors can't go after the client unless the client has directly agreed to pay them. So the workman's remedy would be against the carpeting company, not the clients.

But in this case, the workman's agreement was that he would be paid by the clients. So perhaps the carpeting company assigned their right to payment to the workman. If that's the case, then the workman could be an assignee and could collect from the clients.

But assignment usually requires some form of notice to the obligor (the clients). Did the carpeting company assign their right to the workman? The facts don't explicitly say so. They just say the workman agreed to do the job in exchange for payment from the clients.

Alternatively, maybe the workman is an intended third-party beneficiary. The original contract was between the clients and the carpeting company. By subcontracting to the workman, the carpeting company might have intended that the workman would be paid by the clients.

Wait, but usually, the subcontractor is paid by the contractor, not the client. Unless there's a specific agreement otherwise.

So perhaps the workman can't recover from the clients because they've already paid the contractor. And the contractor (carpeting company) has the money, so the workman would have to sue the contractor for payment.

But then, the options are:

Option D says recover against the carpeting company only.

Option F says recover against the carpeting company because they contracted him.

Option J says recover against either the clients or the carpeting company.

Wait, but can the workman choose whom to sue? Probably not, because the clients have already paid the contractor. The workman's agreement was with the carpeting company, so he should look to them for payment.

Alternatively, if the carpeting company is supposed to pay him, and they have the $7,000, then the workman can sue the carpeting company for his payment.

So the correct answer would be that the workman can recover against the carpeting company only.

Looking at the options:

D: recover against the carpeting company only.

F: recover against the carpeting company because they were the ones who contracted him.

So both D and F seem possible.

Wait, what's the difference between D and F? D is "recover against the carpeting company only." F is "recover against the carpeting company because they were the ones who contracted him."

So the reasoning for F is that the carpeting company contracted him, so he can recover from them.

I think the correct reasoning is that the workman's contract is with the carpeting company, so he can sue them for payment. The clients have already paid the carpeting company, so the workman can't get anything from them. So the answer would be D or F.

Wait, option D says "recover against the carpeting company only." Option F says the same but gives a reason. So I think D is the correct answer because F is more about why, but the question is about whom he can recover from.

Wait, but let's think again. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So his expectation was to be paid by them, but they paid the carpeting company. So can he argue that he's a third-party beneficiary of the original contract and thus can collect from the husband and wife?

In that case, the husband and wife would have already fulfilled their obligation by paying the carpeting company. So the workman can't collect from them because they've already paid.

Alternatively, the workman might argue that the carpeting company is his employer and should pay him, regardless of whether they received payment from the clients.

So perhaps the workman can only recover from the carpeting company.

So the options are either D or F.

Looking again, option D says he can recover against the carpeting company only, option F says he can recover against them because they contracted him.

I think the correct answer is D because the workman's contract was with the carpeting company, so his remedy is against them. The clients have no obligation to pay him since they paid the carpeting company.

So the answer should be D.

The question revolves around contract law and the ability of a workman to recover payment for services rendered. The husband and wife contracted with a carpeting company for $7,000 to install carpeting. The carpeting company, unable to fulfill the job, subcontracted the workman to perform the installation. The workman agreed to do the job in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. However, upon completion, the husband and wife paid the carpeting company $7,000, which was deposited. The workman now seeks to recover payment.

Key points to consider:

1. **Contractual Relationships**:  
   - The primary contract is between the husband and wife (clients) and the carpeting company. The carpeting company agreed to perform the work for $7,000.  
   - The workman was subcontracted by the carpeting company to perform the installation. The workman's agreement was with the carpeting company, and his payment was expected to come from the husband and wife.

2. **Payment Flow**:  
   - The clients fulfilled their obligation by paying the carpeting company $7,000. The workman cannot seek payment from the clients because they have already paid the carpeting company.  
   - The workman's remedy lies with the carpeting company, as the subcontractor is typically paid by the contractor, not the client, unless there is an explicit agreement otherwise.

3. **Third-Party Beneficiary Analysis**:  
   - The workman might argue that he is a third-party beneficiary of the original contract between the clients and the carpeting company. However, the clients have already paid the carpeting company, and there is no indication that the clients agreed to pay the workman directly. Thus, the workman cannot recover from the clients.

4. **Subcontractor's Remedy**:  
   - The workman's contract was with the carpeting company, and the carpeting company received the $7,000 payment from the clients. The workman can seek payment from the carpeting company, as the carpeting company is responsible for paying its subcontractors.

Analysis of Options:
- **A, E, H**: These options are incorrect because the workman’s ability to recover does not depend on the absence of a direct contract with the clients, the lack of a written contract, or the absence of privity of contract.  
- **B, G, I, J**: These options are incorrect because the workman cannot recover from the clients, as they have already paid the carpeting company.  
- **C**: Incorrect because the carpeting company’s receipt of payment does not bar the workman from seeking payment from the carpeting company.  
- **D**: Correct. The workman can recover against the carpeting company only, as the carpeting company is responsible for paying the subcontractor.  
- **F**: While technically correct, it is less precise than option D, as it focuses on why the workman can recover rather than the specific remedy.

The correct answer is **D**: recover against the carpeting company only.

Answer: D
