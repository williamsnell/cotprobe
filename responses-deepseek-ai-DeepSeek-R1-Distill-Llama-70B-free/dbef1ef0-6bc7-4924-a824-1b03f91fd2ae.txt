Question:

What are the general contentions as to whether or not aggressiveness is instinctual?

Options:

A: Aggressiveness is determined by genetic inheritance alone
B: Aggressiveness has no instinctual basis in man
C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual
D: Aggressiveness is a response only to immediate environmental stimuli
E: Aggressiveness is an exclusively human trait not found in other animals
F: Aggressiveness is a trait that can be completely eradicated through education
G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses.
H: Aggressiveness is solely based on learned responses
I: Aggressiveness is a seasonal behavior, similar to migration in animals
J: Aggressiveness emerges only in the absence of societal structures

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about aggressiveness and whether it's instinctual. Hmm, I've studied a bit of psychology before, so maybe I can recall some concepts here.

The question gives me options from A to J. Let me read the question again: it's about the general contentions regarding whether aggressiveness is instinctual. So, I think the options are presenting different viewpoints on this.

I remember that instinctual behaviors are those that are innate, meaning they're genetically determined and not learned. So, some people might argue that aggression is just something we're born with, like an instinct. Others might say it's learned from the environment.

Option A says it's determined by genetics alone. That sounds too extreme because most traits are influenced by both genes and environment. Option B claims there's no instinctual basis, which might be the opposite view. Option C says it's purely instinctual, which again seems too absolute.

Option D suggests it's only about immediate environmental stimuli. That would mean it's all learned, right? But I think most scientists agree that it's a mix. Option E says it's exclusive to humans, which doesn't make sense because animals do exhibit aggressive behaviors too.

Option F claims we can completely get rid of aggressiveness through education. I don't think that's possible because some level of aggression might be instinctual or at least influenced by biology. So F seems unlikely.

Option G states it's a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses. That sounds familiar, like the nature vs. nurture debate. I think this is the correct approach because most behaviors aren't purely one or the other.

Option H says it's solely based on learned responses, which ignores any biological component. Option I talks about it being seasonal, like migration. I don't think aggression is seasonal in humans, so I can probably rule that out.

Option J suggests it only happens without societal structures, which doesn't seem right because aggression can occur even within societies.

So, putting it all together, the contention is whether aggression is all instinct, all learned, or a mix. The correct answer should reflect the interaction between innate and learned factors, which is option G.

The question asks about the general contentions regarding whether aggressiveness is instinctual. To answer this, it's important to consider the nature vs. nurture debate, where instinctual behaviors are innate and learned behaviors are acquired through the environment. 

- **Option A** suggests aggressiveness is determined solely by genetics, which is too extreme as most traits involve both genetic and environmental factors.  
- **Option B** argues there is no instinctual basis, which is the opposite extreme.  
- **Option C** claims aggressiveness is purely instinctual, which is also overly simplistic.  
- **Option D** states it is only a response to immediate environmental stimuli, implying it is entirely learned, which neglects any biological influence.  
- **Option E** incorrectly asserts that aggressiveness is exclusive to humans, ignoring its presence in animals.  
- **Option F** suggests aggressiveness can be completely eradicated through education, which underestimates the potential biological component.  
- **Option G** proposes that aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses, aligning with the widely accepted view that most behaviors result from both nature and nurture.  
- **Option H** claims it is solely based on learned responses, dismissing any instinctual element.  
- **Option I** incorrectly describes aggressiveness as seasonal, which is not applicable to humans.  
- **Option J** suggests aggressiveness occurs only without societal structures, which is inaccurate as aggression can exist within societies.  

The most balanced and accurate perspective is **Option G**, as it acknowledges the interplay between innate and learned factors.  

Answer: G
