Okay, so I've got this problem here about heating water, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: "How many calories of heat are required to raise 1,000 grams of water from 10°C to 100°C?" The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that the calorie is a unit of energy, specifically related to heating. Oh right, the calorie (cal) is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. So, 1 calorie = 1 gram * 1°C.

Wait, wait, but sometimes I get confused between calories and kilocalories. Oh wait, in this context, it's definitely calories, not the food Calories which are actually kilocalories. So, each calorie here is the small 'c' kind.

The problem says 1,000 grams of water. So that's like a kilogram. And the temperature change is from 10°C to 100°C. Oh, so that's a change of 90 degrees. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 10 is 90°C.

So the formula for heat (q) is q = m * c * ΔT. Where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. For water, the specific heat is 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. So c is 1 cal/(g·°C) here.

Plugging in the numbers: m is 1,000 grams. ΔT is 90°C. So q = 1000 g * 1 cal/(g·°C) * 90°C.

Calculating that, 1000 times 90 is 90,000. So q equals 90,000 calories.

Looking at the options, option H is 90,000 calories. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes I make mistakes with units. 1,000 grams is correct, and the temperature change is indeed 90 degrees. Yep, the calculation seems right. So the answer must be H.

To determine how many calories of heat are required to raise 1,000 grams of water from 10°C to 100°C, we use the formula:

\[
q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the water (1,000 grams),
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of water (1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius),
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature change (100°C - 10°C = 90°C).

Substituting the values:

\[
q = 1,000 \, \text{g} \cdot 1 \, \text{cal/(g·°C)} \cdot 90 \, \text{°C} = 90,000 \, \text{calories}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **H: 90,000 calories**.
