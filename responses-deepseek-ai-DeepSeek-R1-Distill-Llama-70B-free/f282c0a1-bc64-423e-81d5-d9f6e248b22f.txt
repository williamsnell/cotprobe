Okay, so I've got this question about stock splits and par value. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Alright, let's break it down.

The question is about Alto Co. splitting its common stock 5 for 1 on July 1. The fair value at that time was $100 per share. Before the split, they had 10,000 shares outstanding, each with a $10 par value. The question is asking what happens to the par value after the split.

Wait, I remember that when a company does a stock split, it's like dividing each existing share into multiple shares. So a 5-for-1 split means each old share becomes five new shares. So if they had 10,000 shares before, after the split, they'll have 50,000 shares (because 10,000 *5=50,000). 

But what about par value? Oh right, par value is the face value or stated value of the stock. I think that when a stock splits, the par value per share changes. Since each share is split into more shares, the par value per share should decrease proportionally. 

Let me think: Before the split, each share had a par value of $10. After a 5-for-1 split, each new share would have a par value of $10 divided by 5, which is $2. So the new par value per share is $2. 

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the par value changes in a stock split. Oh right, in a stock split, the par value per share is adjusted. The total par value remains the same as before the split. So total par value before was 10,000 shares * $10 = $100,000. After the split, it's 50,000 shares * new par value = $100,000. So new par value is $100,000 /50,000 = $2. So the par value per share is $2.

Looking at the options, option I says "Was reduced to $2." So that would be correct.

Wait, but another thought: Some sources say that in a stock split, the par value isn't necessarily changed, but the number of shares increases. Wait no, I think in a split, the par value per share is typically reduced because each share is being divided into more shares.

Alternatively, sometimes the par value might stay the same if the split is done in a way that doesn't require changing it, but in practice, splits usually adjust the par value. For example, if the par was $10 and you split 5 for 1, the par becomes $2 per share.

So the correct answer should be that the par value is reduced to $2, which is option I.

The question involves a 5-for-1 stock split by Alto Co., where the par value of the common stock is analyzed before and after the split. Prior to the split, Alto Co. had 10,000 shares outstanding with a par value of $10 per share, resulting in a total par value of $100,000. A 5-for-1 split means that each existing share is divided into five new shares, increasing the total number of shares to 50,000. 

In a stock split, the total par value remains constant, but the par value per share is proportionally reduced. Since the total par value remains $100,000 and the number of shares increases to 50,000, the new par value per share is calculated as:

\[
\text{New Par Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Par Value}}{\text{New Number of Shares}} = \frac{100,000}{50,000} = 2
\]

Thus, the par value per share is reduced to $2 after the split. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: Was reduced to $2.**
