Okay, so I'm trying to solve this calendar problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, in year N, the 300th day is a Tuesday. Then, in year N+1, the 200th day is also a Tuesday. I need to find out what day of the week the 100th day of year N-1 was. The days are numbered where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7.

Hmm, alright. Let's break this down. I think I should figure out whether the years N-1, N, and N+1 are leap years because that affects the number of days between the years.

Wait, right. Leap years have 366 days instead of 365. So, if a year is a leap year, then the next year starts two days later in the week compared to the previous. Otherwise, it starts one day later. Because 366 mod 7 is 2, and 365 mod 7 is 1.

So, first, I need to determine whether year N is a leap year. Because that will tell me how many days are between year N and N+1, which affects the day of the week for the 200th day in N+1.

Wait, but the problem gives us days in N and N+1. Let's think:

In year N, day 300 is a Tuesday.

In year N+1, day 200 is a Tuesday.

I need to link these two to find out if N is a leap year.

Let me think: The number of days between day 300 of year N and day 200 of year N+1 will determine how the days shift.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: From day 300 in year N to the end of the year is 365 - 300 + 1 (if N is not a leap year) or 366 - 300 +1 (if N is a leap year). Then, add the 200 days in N+1.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because I'm going from day 300 of N to day 200 of N+1. So the total days between those two points would be (end of year N) - 300 + 1 (for the last day) plus 200 days into N+1. But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of days between those two dates, then see how many weeks plus extra days that is.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the number of days between the two dates (day 300 of N and day 200 of N+1) and see what day of the week that difference corresponds to.

So, let me compute the number of days between day 300 of N and day 200 of N+1.

Wait, but that's not correct because the two dates are in different years. So from day 300 of N, the number of days remaining in N is 365 (if not leap) or 366 (if leap) minus 300, plus 1 (because day 300 is included in N). Then, plus 200 days into N+1.

Wait, no, because if I'm moving from day 300 of N to day 200 of N+1, that's (total days in N from day 300 to end) + 200 days in N+1.

So, total days between the two dates would be (365 - 300 +1) + 200 if N is not a leap year, or (366 -300 +1) +200 if N is a leap year.

So let's compute both possibilities.

Case 1: N is not a leap year.

Days from day 300 to end of N: 365 -300 +1 = 66 days.

So total days between day 300 of N and day 200 of N+1: 66 + 200 = 266 days.

Case 2: N is a leap year.

Days from day 300 to end of N: 366-300+1=67.

Total days: 67 + 200=267.

Now, the day of the week advances by the number of days modulo 7.

Because each day cycles every 7 days. So 266 mod7 is 266/7=38*7=266, remainder 0. So 266 days is exactly 38 weeks, so 0 days difference. So the day of the week would be the same.

Similarly, 267 mod7: 267/7=38*7=266, remainder 1. So 1 day difference.

But according to the problem, day 300 of N is Tuesday, and day 200 of N+1 is also Tuesday.

So, in case 1: 0 days difference. So day 200 in N+1 would be same as day 300 in N, which is Tuesday. That's exactly what the problem states, so that's possible.

In case 2: 1 day difference. So day 200 would be Wednesday (since 300 was Tuesday, +1 day). But the problem says it's Tuesday, so case 2 isn't possible. So N is not a leap year.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the day difference is the number of days passed, so from day 300 of N (Tuesday) to day 200 of N+1 is 266 days. Since 266 mod7 is 0, the day remains Tuesday. Which matches the problem statement. So N is not a leap year.

So year N has 365 days.

Now, I need to find the day of the week for day 100 in year N-1.

Wait, but let's think: from day 100 of N-1 to day 300 of N, how many days are in between?

Wait, perhaps it's better to find out what day of the week Jan 1 of each year is, and then compute accordingly.

Let me try to build a timeline.

First, in year N, day 300 is Tuesday.

Assuming that N is not a leap year, because as we determined earlier.

So, 300 days into N is a Tuesday.

I can compute what day Jan 1 of year N was.

Wait, because if I know that day 300 is Tuesday, I can find what day Jan 1 was.

Wait, the number of days between Jan 1 and day 300 is 299 days (since Jan 1 is day 1, so days 2 to 300 is 299 days). So, 299 mod7 is 299/7=42*7=294, 299-294=5. So 5 days.

So, the day of the week for Jan 1, N would be (Tuesday -5 days). Wait, because day 1 is 299 days before day 300.

Wait, no: because if day 300 is Tuesday, then day 1 is 299 days earlier.

So, 299 days earlier is the same as going back 299 mod7=5 days.

So, Tuesday minus 5 days is ... let's count backward.

Tuesday is day 2 (since Monday is 1). So 2 -5 = -3 mod7. Which is 4 (because 7-3=4). So day 4 is Thursday.

Wait, no, wait. Let's double-check: Monday is 1, Tuesday 2, Wednesday3, Thursday4, Friday5, Saturday6, Sunday7.

If day 300 is Tuesday (2), then day 1 is 299 days before. 299 mod7=5. So day 1 is 5 days earlier in the week than day 300.

So starting from Tuesday (2), subtract 5 days.

2 -5 = -3. But mod7, that's the same as 4 (since 7-3=4). So day 1 of N is Thursday (4).

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because 299 days before day 300 would be day 1. So 299 days is 42 weeks and 5 days. So 5 days before Tuesday would be Thursday. Because Tuesday minus 5 is Thursday: Tuesday is 2, minus 5 is -3, mod7 is 4, which is Thursday.

So Jan 1 of N is Thursday.

Now, to find Jan 1 of N-1, I need to know how many days are between Jan 1 of N-1 and Jan 1 of N. Since N is not a leap year, that's 365 days. 365 mod7 is 1. So Jan 1 of N is one day of the week later than Jan 1 of N-1.

So, if Jan 1, N is Thursday (4), then Jan 1, N-1 would be Thursday minus 1 day, which is Wednesday (3).

Wait, because each year, if it's not a leap year, the next year starts one day later. So if N starts on Thursday, then N-1 must have started on Wednesday, because N-1 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks +1 day. So Jan 1, N is +1 day from Jan 1, N-1.

So, yes, Jan 1 of N-1 is Wednesday (3).

Now, I need to find day 100 of year N-1.

So, from Jan 1 (Wednesday, 3) to day 100.

How many days is that? It's 99 days after Jan 1.

Because day 1 is Jan 1, day 100 is 99 days later.

99 mod7 is ... 99/7=14*7=98, remainder 1. So 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day.

So, starting from Wednesday (3), add 1 day. That brings us to Thursday (4).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, day 1 is Wednesday. So day 2 would be Thursday (3+1=4), day 3 Friday (5), etc. Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of adding days. So, Jan 1 is day 1, which is Wednesday (3). So day 100 is 99 days after Jan 1. So 99 mod7 is 1 (since 14*7=98, 99-98=1). So the day of the week would be Wednesday +1 = Thursday (4).

So day 100 of N-1 is a Thursday, which is day 4.

Looking back at the options, option F is 4. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but let me double-check everything because it's easy to make a mistake with mod operations.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

1. Year N is not a leap year (365 days).

2. Day 300 of N is Tuesday.

3. Day 1 of N is 299 days before day 300. 299 mod7=5. So day 1 is 5 days before Tuesday.

Tuesday is 2, so 2-5= -3, mod7=4 (Thursday). So Jan 1, N is Thursday.

4. Year N-1 ends on day 365, which is Dec 31, N-1, which is the day before Jan 1, N. Since N is not a leap year, N-1 could be a leap year or not? Wait, wait, no. Wait, we determined that N is not a leap year, but what about N-1?

Wait, no, wait. The determination that N is not a leap year was based on the transition from N to N+1. Because if N had been a leap year, then the day shift would have been different.

But wait, now that I think about it, N could be a leap year if N+1 is not. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me re-examine that part.

We had two cases:

Case 1: N is not a leap year. So from day 300 of N to day 200 of N+1 is 66 + 200=266 days. 266 mod7=0. So same day, Tuesday. So that's consistent.

Case 2: N is a leap year. Then, days between would be 67 +200=267. 267 mod7=1. So day would be Tuesday +1=Wednesday. But problem says it's Tuesday, so case2 invalid. So N is not a leap year.

So, N is not a leap year. But what about N-1? Could N-1 be a leap year? Because that affects how the days transition from N-1 to N.

Wait, yes. Because the number of days between Jan 1, N-1 and Jan 1, N depends on whether N-1 is a leap year.

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, I assumed that N-1 is not a leap year, but that's not necessarily correct. Because N is not a leap year, but N-1 could be.

So wait, perhaps I should re-examine that part.

So, the transition from N-1 to N depends on whether N-1 is a leap year.

Because if N-1 is a leap year, then it has 366 days. So the next year (N) would start two days later in the week.

If N-1 is not a leap year, then N starts one day later.

Wait, but in my previous step, I assumed that N-1 is not a leap year, but that might not be correct.

So, perhaps I made a mistake there.

Let me correct that.

So, I need to determine whether N-1 is a leap year.

But how?

Well, perhaps I should find out the day of the week for Jan 1 of N, which is Thursday.

And I need to find Jan 1 of N-1.

So, the number of days in N-1 is 365 if it's not a leap year, or 366 if it is.

So, let me compute the number of days between Jan 1, N-1 and Jan 1, N.

That would be 365 or 366, depending on whether N-1 is a leap year.

The day of the week for Jan 1, N is Thursday (4).

The day of the week for Jan 1, N-1 would be (Thursday - (365 mod7) days) if N-1 is not a leap year, or (Thursday - (366 mod7) days) if N-1 is a leap year.

But wait, 365 mod7 is 1, 366 mod7 is 2.

So, if N-1 is not a leap year, then Jan 1, N is Jan 1, N-1 +1 day. So Jan 1, N-1 would be Thursday -1 = Wednesday (3).

If N-1 is a leap year, then Jan 1, N is Jan 1, N-1 +2 days. So Jan 1, N-1 would be Thursday -2 = Tuesday (2).

So, without knowing whether N-1 is a leap year, I can't be certain. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but perhaps I can find out whether N-1 is a leap year by using the information about day 200 of N+1.

Wait, but let me think. I'm not sure. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards to find the day for Jan 1 of N-1, and then calculate day 100.

Wait, but without knowing whether N-1 is a leap year, I can't compute the exact day shift.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try another approach.

Wait, maybe I can find the day of the week for day 100 of N-1 using the information from N and N+1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the day of the week for Jan 1 of N-1, considering whether N-1 is a leap year or not.

Wait, but how? Because I don't know if N-1 is a leap year.

Wait, perhaps I can find the day of the week for Jan 1 of N+1 and work backward.

Wait, because in N+1, day 200 is a Tuesday.

So let's find Jan 1 of N+1.

Because from Jan 1, N+1, day 200 is 199 days later.

So, 199 mod7 is 199/7=28*7=196, 199-196=3. So 3 days.

So, if day 200 is Tuesday, then Jan 1, N+1 is Tuesday minus 3 days. So Tuesday is 2, 2-3=-1 mod7=6 (Saturday).

So Jan 1, N+1 is a Saturday.

Now, from Jan 1, N to Jan 1, N+1.

Since N is not a leap year (365 days), the shift is +1 day. So Jan 1, N+1 is Jan 1, N +1 day.

Earlier, we found Jan 1, N is Thursday (4). So adding 1 day, Jan 1, N+1 would be Friday (5). But according to our calculation, Jan 1, N+1 is Saturday (6). That's a discrepancy! So that can't be right.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, I thought that N is not a leap year, so Jan 1, N+1 would be Jan 1, N +1 day. But according to the calculation, Jan 1, N+1 is Saturday, which would require that Jan 1, N is Friday.

But earlier, we found Jan 1, N to be Thursday. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, that suggests that somewhere, my earlier reasoning is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Jan 1, N+1.

Let me re-calculate.

In N+1, day 200 is Tuesday.

The number of days from Jan 1 (day 1) to day 200 is 199 days.

199 mod7=3. So Jan 1 is 3 days before Tuesday.

Tuesday is day 2. So 2-3= -1, mod7=6. So Jan 1, N+1 is Saturday (6).

So that's correct.

Now, from Jan 1, N to Jan 1, N+1: since N is not a leap year (365 days), 365 mod7=1. So Jan 1, N+1 is Jan 1, N +1 day.

So, if Jan 1, N is Thursday (4), then Jan 1, N+1 would be Friday (5). But according to the calculation, it's Saturday (6). So this is a problem.

This suggests that my initial assumption that N is not a leap year might be wrong.

Wait, but earlier I thought that N is not a leap year because the days between day 300 of N and day 200 of N+1 was 266 days, which is 0 mod7, so same day.

But perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, let me re-express that calculation.

The number of days between day 300 of N and day 200 of N+1.

If N is a leap year,
