Okay, so I've got this problem here about property taxes, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: A tax of $800 is paid on a property with an assessed value of $20,000. If the tax rate is increased by 1%, what will the new tax cost be? The options are A through J.

Hmm, so I need to find the new tax after the rate increases by 1%. Let me think about what I know about tax rates. I remember that the tax is usually calculated by multiplying the assessed value by the tax rate, which is often a percentage.

Wait, so the initial tax is $800, and the assessed value is $20,000. So maybe the current tax rate can be found by dividing the tax by the assessed value. Let me write that down.

Current tax = $800
Assessed value = $20,000
So current tax rate = 800 / 20,000.

Let me calculate that. 800 divided by 20,000. Hmm, 20,000 divided by 100 is 200, so 800 divided by 20,000 is 0.04. Oh right, because 20,000 times 0.04 is 800. So the current tax rate is 4%.

But wait, wait. Oh wait, 4% of 20,000 is 800. Yeah, that's right. So the tax rate is 4%.

Now, the problem says the tax rate is increased by 1%. So I think that means the new tax rate is 4% plus 1%, making it 5%.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because sometimes when they say "increased by 1%", that could be a percentage increase based on the original rate. But in this case, I think it's a straightforward 1 percentage point increase. Because 1% of the current rate would be a 0.04 increase, but that's not how they're wording it. They say the tax rate is increased by 1%, which I think just means adding 1% to it.

So new tax rate is 4% + 1% = 5%.

Now, I need to find the new tax cost. So the assessed value is still $20,000, right? Because the problem doesn't mention any change in the assessed value. So the new tax would be 5% of 20,000.

Calculating that: 5% of 20,000. 1% of 20,000 is 200, so 5% is 5 times 200, which is 1000. So the new tax would be $1,000.

Looking at the options, option A is $1,000. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So initial rate is 800/20000 = 4%. Increase by 1% gives 5%. 5% of 20000 is 1000. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any errors here. So the answer should be A.

The current tax rate is calculated by dividing the tax ($800) by the assessed value ($20,000), resulting in a 4% tax rate. When the tax rate is increased by 1%, the new tax rate becomes 5%. Applying this new rate to the assessed value of $20,000 gives a new tax of $1,000.

Answer: A
