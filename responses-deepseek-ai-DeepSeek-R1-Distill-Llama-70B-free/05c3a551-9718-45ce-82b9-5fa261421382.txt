Okay, so I have this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The scenario is when someone responds to an argument with a sarcastic statement like, "Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen." The question is asking which fallacy this person might have committed.

Hmm, I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. There are many types, and I need to recall them to match the situation here.

So the options are A through J, each representing a different fallacy. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Tu quoque. I think this is the "you too" fallacy, where someone accuses the opponent of doing what they themselves are doing, trying to discredit them. But in this case, the response isn't about accusing the other person of something; it's more of a sarcastic dismissal. So maybe not A.

Option B: Appeal to ignorance. This fallacy happens when someone assumes that because something isn't known to be false, it must be true, or vice versa. The sarcastic comment doesn't seem to be about ignorance; it's more about mocking the argument's validity. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C: Argumentum ad populum. This is an appeal to popularity, where the argument is made by claiming that many or most people believe it. The sarcastic remark doesn't reference popularity, so probably not C.

Option D: False cause. This fallacy occurs when the argument incorrectly identifies the cause of a phenomenon. The example given doesn't suggest a cause-effect relationship, so D is unlikely.

Option E: Appeal to indignation. This fallacy uses the arousal of anger or indignation to persuade. The sarcastic comment is more dismissive than anger-inducing, so E doesn't fit.

Option F: Appeal to spite. This is when someone appeals to the bitterness or resentment of the audience. While sarcasm can be biting, the response here isn't necessarily invoking spite towards the argument's source. So F might not be it.

Option G: Horse laugh. Wait, I'm not too familiar with this one. I think it's when someone mocks or laughs at an argument to dismiss it without addressing its merits. That sounds a lot like the sarcastic response given. So G could be the correct answer.

Option H: Slippery slope. This fallacy claims that a relatively small first step will lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant effect. The response doesn't imply a chain of events, so H is probably not right.

Option I: Straw man fallacy. This is when someone misrepresents someone else's argument to make it easier to attack. The sarcastic comment here isn't misrepresenting the argument; it's just dismissing it sarcastically. So I might not be the answer.

Option J: Argumentum ad hominem. This is attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. The sarcastic remark isn't directed at the person but at the argument's validity, so J doesn't fit.

Wait, going back to option G, the horse laugh. I think this is when someone dismisses an argument by laughing it off or being sarcastic without providing a real rebuttal. That fits the example given, where the response is a sarcastic dismissal rather than a reasoned counterargument.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: horse laugh.

The sarcastic response, "Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen," is an example of the horse laugh fallacy. This fallacy occurs when someone dismisses an argument through mockery or sarcasm without addressing its merits. 

The other options were considered and dismissed as follows:
- **A (Tu quoque):** Involves accusing the opponent of hypocrisy, not relevant here.
- **B (Appeal to ignorance):** Relates to assuming truth from lack of evidence, not applicable.
- **C (Argumentum ad populum):** Appeals to popularity, which isn't the case.
- **D (False cause):** Incorrectly identifies cause-effect, not present here.
- **E (Appeal to indignation):** Arouses anger, but the response is dismissive, not anger-inducing.
- **F (Appeal to spite):** Involves bitterness, not the focus of the sarcasm.
- **H (Slippery slope):** Suggests a chain of events, which isn't implied.
- **I (Straw man):** Misrepresents the argument, but the response doesn't do that.
- **J (Ad hominem):** Attacks the person, but the sarcasm targets the argument's validity.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: horse laugh**.

Answer: G
