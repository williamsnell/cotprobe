Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: "They call up more every day.
"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
"But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."
Du Fu, "Ballad of the Army Carts," ca. 750 C.E.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a poem by Du Fu, specifically "Ballad of the Army Carts," which was written around 750 C.E. The question is about what the poem provides direct evidence for regarding taxation in the third stanza.

First, I need to look at the poem itself to understand the context. The poem is a lament about the hardships faced by soldiers and their families due to constant military conscription and taxation. The soldiers are speaking, expressing their struggles.

The third stanza mentioned in the question is:

"The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."

So, focusing on the first two lines here: the District Officers demanding land tax, but the people can't pay because they're already struggling. The phrase "can't get blood from a stone" suggests that they have nothing left to give.

I need to match this with the options provided. The options are A through J. The question is about which option the poem provides direct evidence for in its discussion of taxation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Tang's large standing army without conscription. But the poem talks about conscription, as soldiers are being rounded up and sent away. So this is probably not correct.

Option B: Fair and equitable taxation. The poem shows that taxes are being demanded even when people can't pay, so the system doesn't seem fair. Unlikely.

Option C: Advanced agricultural tech. The poem doesn't discuss technology, so probably not.

Option D: Strong local bureaucracy. The District Officers are active in demanding taxes, which suggests a functioning bureaucracy. That's a possibility.

Option E: Economic prosperity due to high taxes. The people are struggling, so this isn't about prosperity.

Option F: Lack of regular income due to unpaid taxes. The lines say the officers are demanding taxes but the people can't pay, implying taxes aren't being collected. So maybe this is about unpaid taxes leading to lack of income for the state.

Option G: Land distribution based on taxation. The poem doesn't talk about how land is distributed, just that taxes are demanded.

Option H: Heavy reliance on conscription. The poem does mention conscription, like men being rounded up. But the question is specifically about the third stanza and taxation.

Option I: Forced labor instead of taxes. The poem doesn't mention forced labor; it's about taxes and conscription separately.

Option J: High urbanization. The poem talks about villages and agriculture, not cities, so probably not.

So, narrowing it down. The third stanza's focus is on taxation. The District Officers are demanding land tax, but people can't pay. So this suggests that the local officials (District Officers) are part of a system where taxes are being enforced, but the people are unable to pay, leading to unpaid taxes.

Looking at the options, D talks about strong local bureaucracy. The presence of District Officers actively demanding taxes indicates that the local bureaucracy is in place and functioning, so D could be a possibility.

Option F says the dynasty lacks regular income due to unpaid taxes. The poem shows that taxes can't be collected, so maybe the state isn't getting the income it expects. But the question is about what the poem directly provides evidence for. The poem doesn't explicitly state that the state lacks income, just that people can't pay, so F might be an inference rather than direct evidence.

Alternatively, D is about the bureaucracy's strength, which is directly shown by the District Officers enforcing taxes despite the hardship. So D seems more directly supported by the poem.

Wait, but the question is specifically about taxation, not about military conscription. So in the third stanza, the tax issue is about the officers demanding it, which suggests a strong bureaucratic presence at the local level, enforcing tax collection. So D would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another angle: the fact that taxes are being demanded even when people can't pay might suggest that the system is oppressive, but the question is about what the poem provides direct evidence for. So the presence of District Officers enforcing taxes shows a strong local bureaucracy.

So the answer should be D.

The poem "Ballad of the Army Carts" by Du Fu provides direct evidence of the Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level through the depiction of District Officers demanding land taxes, even when the population is unable to pay. This indicates a functioning bureaucratic system enforcing tax collection, despite the hardships faced by the people.
