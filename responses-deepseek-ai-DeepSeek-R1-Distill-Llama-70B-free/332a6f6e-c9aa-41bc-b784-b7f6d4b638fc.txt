Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum efficiency and photon detection. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says the quantum efficiency is 0.1, and 100 photons are sent into the detector one after another. We need to find out the average number of detections and the root mean square (rms) deviation.

Wait, quantum efficiency... right, I remember that quantum efficiency (QE) is the probability that a single photon will be detected. So if the QE is 0.1, each photon has a 10% chance of being detected. So for each photon sent in, there's a 10% chance it's counted.

Since 100 photons are sent, I think each has an independent chance. So the number of detected photons would follow a binomial distribution. Oh wait, but when the number of trials is large and the probability is small, the binomial distribution approximates a Poisson distribution. Or wait, maybe notâ€”what's the exact approach here?

In a binomial distribution, the mean (expected value) is n times p. Here, n is 100, p is 0.1, so the mean is 100 * 0.1 = 10. So on average, 10 photons are detected. That makes sense.

Now, the rms deviation is the standard deviation. For a binomial distribution, the variance is n*p*(1-p). So variance would be 100 * 0.1 * 0.9. Let's calculate that: 100 * 0.09 is 9. So the variance is 9, which makes the standard deviation the square root of 9, which is 3.

So the average is 10, and the rms (which is the standard deviation) is about 3. So looking at the options, option B says average 10, rms 3. Option D says rms 1, which is too low. Option H has rms 4, which is higher than 3. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thought. Another approach: each photon detection is a Bernoulli trial with success probability p=0.1. The number of successes in n=100 trials is a binomial variable. So mean is 10, variance is np(1-p)=9, so standard deviation 3. Yep, that's solid.

The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the probability that a single photon is detected. With a quantum efficiency of 0.1, each photon has a 10% chance of being detected. When 100 photons are sent into the detector, the number of detected photons follows a binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 100 \) and \( p = 0.1 \).

The mean (expected value) of a binomial distribution is given by \( \mu = n \cdot p \). Substituting the values, \( \mu = 100 \cdot 0.1 = 10 \). Thus, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times.

The variance of a binomial distribution is \( \sigma^2 = n \cdot p \cdot (1-p) \). Substituting the values, \( \sigma^2 = 100 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 9 \). The standard deviation (rms deviation) is the square root of the variance, so \( \sigma = \sqrt{9} = 3 \).

Therefore, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.**
