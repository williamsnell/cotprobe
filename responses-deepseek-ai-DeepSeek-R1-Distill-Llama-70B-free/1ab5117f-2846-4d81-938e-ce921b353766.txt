Okay, so I need to figure out which countries have high secondary school enrollment rates among less developed countries as of 2020. The options are A through J, each listing four countries.

First, I remember that secondary school enrollment rates vary a lot between countries. More developed countries usually have higher rates, but some less developed countries might also have made significant progress.

Looking at the options, I can start by recalling some general data. For example, I know that Uruguay and Costa Rica are both upper-middle-income countries and likely have higher enrollment rates. Colombia might also be in a similar category. On the other hand, countries like Niger, Pakistan, and Timor-Leste tend to have lower enrollment rates because they face more developmental challenges.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Peru, Uruguay, Cambodia, Niger. Peru is middle-income, so maybe. Uruguay definitely has high rates. Cambodia and Niger might be lower, so this might not be the best choice.

Option B: Pakistan, Niger, Peru, Bhutan. Pakistan and Niger are probably lower, so this seems unlikely.

Option C: Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, Costa Rica. Bhutan is a lower-middle-income country, but I'm not sure about their enrollment rates. Cambodia is lower. Uruguay and Costa Rica are strong, so this could be a possibility.

Option D: Costa Rica, Colombia, Niger, Timor-Leste. Both Costa Rica and Colombia are likely high. Niger and Timor-Leste are lower, so this mix doesn't seem right.

Option E: Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, Costa Rica. Niger and Cambodia are lower, so this is probably not the group with high enrollment.

Option F: Timor-Leste, Pakistan, Peru, Bhutan. Timor and Pakistan are lower, so this doesn't fit.

Option G: Niger, Bhutan, Timor-Leste, Colombia. Niger and Timor are lower, so no.

Option H: Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Uruguay, Pakistan. Only Uruguay stands out here, others are lower.

Option I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Costa Rica. All of these are upper-middle-income countries. I think they have high enrollment rates. This seems very plausible.

Option J: Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, Pakistan. Timor and Pakistan are lower, so this isn't right.

So the best option seems to be I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. These are all countries that have made good progress in education and have higher secondary enrollment rates.

The correct answer is I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.

These countries are upper-middle-income nations that have made significant progress in education, leading to higher secondary school enrollment rates compared to less developed countries. 

Answer: I
