Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An officer stopped a car for having a burned out headlight and license plate light. When the driver could not produce a driver's license, the officer asked him if he minded if they searched the vehicle. The officer did not advise the driver that he had a right to refuse consent or that if he refused his decision would be honored, but there was nothing duplicitous or coercive in the officer's conduct. The driver smiled and said "of course, no problem." The officer found stolen bank checks under the rear seat. In a later suppression motion, the driver claimed that his consent was not voluntary. What will the court most likely decide on that issue?

Options:

A: The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.
B: The consent was involuntary because the officer did not have a warrant to search the car.
C: The consent was involuntary because it was the product of implied duress.
D: The consent was involuntary because the driver did not explicitly say the words "I consent."
E: The consent was involuntary because the officer found stolen bank checks in the car.
F: The consent was involuntary because the officer did not advise the driver of his right to refuse.
G: The consent became voluntary as a matter of law when the driver failed to produce a driver's license.
H: The consent was voluntary because the officer asked politely.
I: The consent was voluntarily given because the driver smiled and was cooperative.
J: The consent was involuntary as the driver was not informed about the consequences of refusal.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about consent to search a vehicle. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through carefully.

Alright, the scenario is that a police officer stops a car because the headlights and license plate light are out. The driver can't produce a license, so the officer asks if they can search the vehicle. The officer didn't tell the driver that he could refuse or that his refusal would be honored. But there's nothing tricky or coercive in how the officer asked—no threats or anything like that. The driver agreed by smiling and saying, "Of course, no problem." Then the officer found stolen checks, and now the driver is trying to suppress the evidence, claiming his consent wasn't voluntary.

The question is, what will the court decide? The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

So, I remember that for consent to be valid, it needs to be voluntary. That means the person giving consent must do so without being forced, threatened, or deceived. If the consent isn't voluntary, then the search could be deemed unconstitutional, and the evidence might be suppressed.

In this case, the officer didn't inform the driver of his right to refuse. I'm trying to recall if the law requires the police to explicitly tell the person they can say no. I think in some cases, the court has held that the absence of such information doesn't necessarily make the consent invalid. The key is whether, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would feel free to refuse.

So, the officer asked politely, there was no coercion or duplicity. The driver didn't seem forced; he even smiled and agreed readily. So the issue is whether the lack of advisement about the right to refuse affects the voluntariness of the consent.

I remember a case where the Supreme Court discussed this. I think it was United States v. Drayton, where the Court said that police don't need to explicitly advise a person of their right to refuse consent for it to be valid. The court looks at the totality of the circumstances. So if the request was made in a way that a reasonable person would feel free to say no, then the consent is voluntary even without being told about the right to refuse.

In this scenario, the officer's conduct wasn't coercive. The driver was cooperative and didn't show any signs of being under duress. So the court would likely find that the consent was voluntary. Therefore, the evidence wouldn't be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the consent was voluntary and not coerced. That seems to fit because there was no duress or coercion.

Option F suggests the consent was involuntary because the officer didn't advise the driver of his right to refuse. But as per the case law, explicit advisement isn't required. So F is probably incorrect.

Options B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J all have issues. B is about not having a warrant, but consent searches don't require warrants. C talks about implied duress, but the facts don't indicate any. D requires explicit words, which isn't necessary. E is about the evidence found, which is irrelevant to the voluntariness. G is about failing to produce a license making consent voluntary, which seems off. H says it's voluntary because the officer was polite—maybe, but that's part of the bigger picture. I says it's voluntary because the driver was cooperative, which might support A. J talks about not knowing consequences, but again, the advisement isn't required.

So the best answer seems to be A. The consent was voluntary because there was no coercion, and the officer's conduct was proper. The lack of advisement doesn't negate the voluntariness.

The court will most likely decide that the consent was voluntarily given. The key issue is whether the consent was voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. The officer's conduct was not coercive or duplicitous, and the driver responded cooperatively by smiling and agreeing. While the officer did not advise the driver of his right to refuse, such advisement is not required for consent to be valid. The absence of coercion or duress, combined with the driver's cooperative demeanor, supports the conclusion that the consent was voluntary. Therefore, the evidence found during the search is admissible.

Answer: A
