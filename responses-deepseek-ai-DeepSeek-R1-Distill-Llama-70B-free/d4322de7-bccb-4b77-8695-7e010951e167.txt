Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the Aztec Empire. The question is asking what the empire was based on in terms of systematic expansion. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the Aztecs were known for their large empire, which they expanded through various methods. I think they were skilled in several areas like agriculture, trade, and military conquest. But I'm not exactly sure which one was the main basis for their expansion.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A vast network of roads and trade routes. I recall that the Aztecs had an extensive road system, which helped with trade and communication. They also used causeways to connect parts of their capital, Tenochtitl√°n, which was built on an island in Lake Texcoco. But was this the primary method of expansion?

Option B: Control of waterways for transportation and irrigation. The Aztecs did build canals and used waterways, especially since their capital was on a lake. However, I'm not sure if controlling waterways was their main expansion strategy.

Option C: Cultivation and trade of cacao and maize. These were important crops. Cacao was used as currency, and maize was a staple. But while trade was significant, I'm not certain if it was the systematic method they used for expansion.

Option D: Religious beliefs requiring human sacrifice. The Aztecs were known for their religious practices, including human sacrifice. But did this drive their expansion? I think religion played a role, but was it the systematic basis? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option E: Tribute in the form of gold, jade, etc. Tribute was a big part of their empire. They collected resources from conquered peoples. But was this the method of expansion, or a result of it? I think it's more about how they maintained control rather than how they expanded.

Option F: Establishing colonies in unexplored territories. I don't remember the Aztecs being known for colonizing new areas in the same way, say, the Spanish did. They might have expanded through alliances or conquests rather than establishing colonies.

Option G: Ceramic production, architecture, and art. These were aspects of their culture, but not directly related to how they expanded their empire.

Option H: Farming techniques like terracing and irrigation. They were skilled farmers, but again, this seems more about sustaining their population rather than expanding their empire.

Option I: A strict caste system promoting social stratification. The Aztecs did have a stratified society, including nobles and commoners, but I'm not sure how this relates to their expansion strategy.

Option J: Oppressive control based on military conquest. This rings a bell. The Aztecs were definitely a militaristic society. They expanded through military campaigns, conquering neighboring city-states and integrating them into their empire. Military power was central to their expansion.

So, putting it together, I think the Aztecs expanded systematically through military conquest. They would conquer areas, impose their rule, and then extract tribute. So the systematic expansion was based on military control and oppressive measures to maintain their empire.

Wait, but option J says "oppressive social and religious control based on military conquest." That sounds a bit more about the control mechanisms after conquest. The question is about the expansion itself. So maybe the expansion was through military conquest, and the control mechanisms were part of maintaining that.

Alternatively, option A is about roads and trade, which facilitated expansion. But I think the primary method was military. So the answer is probably J.

Wait, but another thought: the expansion was systematic, so maybe it's about how they organized their expansion. They had a system where they would conquer, integrate, and then impose tribute. So the systematic expansion would rely on military conquest as the method. So the answer would be J.

Alternatively, some sources I've read mention that the Aztecs expanded through military campaigns and then established tributary systems. So the basis of their expansion was military conquest, which allowed them to control and extract resources.

So looking back, the question is about what the empire was based on for expansion. So the systematic expansion was through military conquest and then using oppressive social and religious control to maintain it. So option J seems to fit.

The Aztec Empire's systematic expansion was primarily based on military conquest. They expanded their empire through military campaigns, conquering neighboring city-states and integrating them into their empire. Once conquered, they imposed oppressive social and religious control to maintain their rule and extract tribute. This combination of military power and subsequent control mechanisms was central to their systematic expansion.

Answer: J
