Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an AR(2) process. Let me see if I can figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on time series analysis, but I'll take it step by step.

The question gives the process: yt = 1.5 yt-1 - 0.5 yt-2 + ut. I remember that AR stands for Autoregressive, and the number in parentheses is the order, so this is a second-order autoregressive model. 

I think the key here is to determine whether this process is stationary, has a unit root, or is explosive. Stationary processes have a stable mean and variance over time, right? Unit root processes are non-stationary because they have a root equal to 1, meaning shocks can have permanent effects. Explosive processes are those where the coefficients cause the series to grow without bound, making them non-stationary as well.

So for an AR(2) model, the characteristic equation is important. The characteristic equation is obtained by setting up the model in terms of lag operators. For the given equation, the characteristic equation would be r² - 1.5r + 0.5 = 0. I remember that the roots of this equation determine the behavior of the process.

To find the roots, I'll use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ar² + br + c = 0, so the roots are [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a). Here, a=1, b=-1.5, c=0.5. Plugging these in: [1.5 ± sqrt( (1.5)^2 - 4*1*0.5 ) ] / 2.

Calculating the discriminant: (1.5)^2 is 2.25, and 4*1*0.5 is 2. So sqrt(2.25 - 2) = sqrt(0.25) = 0.5. So the roots are [1.5 ± 0.5]/2. Let's calculate them:

First root: (1.5 + 0.5)/2 = 2/2 = 1.
Second root: (1.5 - 0.5)/2 = 1/2 = 0.5.

So the roots are r=1 and r=0.5. Now, for stationarity in an AR model, the roots should all be outside the unit circle. That means the absolute value of each root should be greater than 1. Wait, no, wait. I think that's for the invertibility of the MA model. For AR models, the condition is that all roots must lie outside the unit circle for the process to be stationary. Wait, no, the other way around. Or is it the other way? No, wait, I might be mixing things up.

Actually, for an AR process to be stationary, the roots of the characteristic equation must lie outside the unit circle. That is, the absolute value of each root must be greater than 1. Because if a root is inside the unit circle (|r| < 1), then the process could be explosive. Let me think again.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The characteristic equation for an AR(p) model is 1 - φ1 r - φ2 r² - ... - φp r^p =0. The roots of this equation are the AR roots. For stationarity, all roots must lie outside the unit circle, meaning their absolute values are greater than 1. If any root has an absolute value less than 1, the process isn't stationary. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Wait, no, maybe I should look at the modulus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the AR coefficients. For a second-order AR model, the conditions for stationarity are that the coefficients satisfy certain inequalities. Let me recall those conditions.

For an AR(2) model, the stationarity conditions are:

1. φ2 + 1 > 0
2. 1 - φ1 + φ2 > 0
3. |φ2| < 1

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the conditions involve the roots. So if both roots have modulus greater than 1, the process is stationary. If any root has modulus less than 1, it's not. Because when roots are inside the unit circle, the model is non-stationary or explosive.

Wait, but in this case, one of the roots is 1. So that's on the unit circle. So if a root is exactly 1, the process has a unit root and is therefore non-stationary. So in this case, the model is a unit root process because one of the roots is 1. That would make the process non-stationary.

So let's recap: the roots are 1 and 0.5. So one root is on the unit circle (r=1) and the other is inside (r=0.5). That means the process is non-stationary because it has a unit root. But since the other root is inside, does that make it explosive? Or is it just a unit root process?

Wait, I think that if any root is exactly 1, the process is a unit root process, which is a type of non-stationary process. Explosive processes occur when the roots are inside the unit circle, meaning |r| <1. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the roots are inside the unit circle, the model is actually stationary, isn't it? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up again.

Wait, no. Let me think about the general solution of an AR(2) model. The solution is based on the roots. If the roots are real and distinct, the general form is yt = α1 r1^t + α2 r2^t, where r1 and r2 are the roots.

If both |r1| >1 and |r2| >1, then the process is stationary. Because as t increases, the terms would decay to zero. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if r is greater than 1, then r^t grows exponentially, which would make the process explosive. Wait, that's confusing me.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it backward. Let me think again. For an AR model, the characteristic equation is 1 - φ1 r - φ2 r² = 0. So the roots are the solutions for r in this equation. Now, for the model to be stationary, the roots must lie outside the unit circle, meaning |r|>1. Because then, the homogeneous solution (the part without the error term) would decay to zero as t increases, leading to a stable mean and variance.

Wait, but if a root is inside the unit circle (|r| <1), then the term would explode because as t increases, r^t would get smaller if |r| <1, but that would make the solution approaching zero, which is stable. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the solution when the roots are inside versus outside. Suppose r is 0.5: then as t increases, 0.5^t approaches zero. So that term dies out. So that's a stable solution. If r is 2, then 2^t grows without bound, leading to an explosive process.

Wait, so the condition for stationarity is that all roots of the characteristic equation must lie outside the unit circle (|r|>1). If any root is inside (|r|<1), the process is explosive. But wait, no, I think that's the opposite. Because if the roots are outside, then the homogeneous part would decay to zero as t increases, making the process stable and stationary. If a root is inside, then the term would explode because it would grow as t increases, but wait, no, 0.5^t decreases as t increases.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let's take an example. Suppose the model is yt = 0.5 yt-1 + ut. The characteristic equation is r = 0.5, so the root is 0.5. The solution would be yt = (0.5)^t * yt0 + sum of errors. So as t increases, the effect of the initial condition dies out, leading to a stationary process around the error terms.

Wait, but that's an AR(1) model with |φ|=0.5<1, which is stationary. So in that case, the root is inside the unit circle, and the process is stationary. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me correct myself.

In an AR model, if the roots of the characteristic equation are inside the unit circle (|r| <1), then the process is stationary. If any root is on or outside the unit circle (|r| ≥1), the process is non-stationary.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the AR(1) model with |φ|<1 is stationary. The characteristic equation is 1 - φ r =0 → r=1/φ. So if |φ|<1, then |r|=1/|φ|>1. So the root is outside the unit circle. But that model is stationary. So that suggests that for stationarity, the roots must be outside the unit circle.

Wait, that makes sense because in the AR(1) case, when |φ|<1, the root is r=1/φ which has |r|>1. So the process is stationary. When |φ|=1, it's a unit root, non-stationary. When |φ|>1, the root is inside the unit circle (|r|=1/|φ|<1), but the process would be explosive, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The AR(1) model is yt = φ yt-1 + ut. The solution is yt = φ^t y0 + sum_{i=1 to t} φ^{t-i} ut-i. If |φ| <1, then as t increases, φ^t →0, so the process is stationary. If |φ|>1, then φ^t grows without bound, making the process explosive.

But the characteristic equation for AR(1) is 1 - φ r =0 → r = 1/φ. So if |φ|<1, |r|=1/|φ|>1, which is outside the unit circle. So in that case, the process is stationary. If |φ|>1, |r|=1/|φ|<1, so the root is inside the unit circle, and the process is explosive.

So for AR models, if all roots of the characteristic equation lie outside the unit circle (i.e., |r|>1 for all r), then the process is stationary. If any root is inside (|r|<1), the process is explosive. If any root is on the unit circle (|r|=1), then it's a unit root process and non-stationary.

Wait, but in our problem, one root is 1 (on unit circle) and the other is 0.5 (inside). So the process has a unit root and an explosive component. So what does that mean for the overall process?

I think that if any root is inside the unit circle (|r|<1), the process is explosive. Because even though one root is on the unit circle (causing a unit root), the other being inside would cause the process to be explosive. But I'm not entirely sure how these combine. Alternatively, perhaps having a unit root makes it non-stationary regardless of the other roots.

Wait, but let's think about it. The general solution would be yt = A(1)^t + B(0.5)^t. So the first term is a constant (since 1^t=1), and the second term decays to zero. So the process would behave like a random walk (from the unit root term) plus a decaying term. But the presence of the unit root would dominate, leading to non-stationarity. But the other term is stationary. So the overall process is non-stationary.

Wait, but what about the explosive part. The other root is 0.5, which is inside the unit circle, so the term B(0.5)^t would decay over time. That's a stable component. So maybe the process isn't explosive overall because the explosive part comes from the unit root, not from a root inside. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing explosive and unit root processes.

Wait, I think that in this case, the process is non-stationary because it has a unit root. But it's not explosive because none of the roots are causing the process to grow without bound. Or is it explosive because one root is inside the unit circle? No, I think explosive processes occur when the roots are inside the unit circle. Wait, no, earlier I thought that if a root is inside, the process is explosive. But in the AR(1) case, when the root is inside (i.e., |φ|>1), the process becomes explosive.

Wait, I'm getting really confused. Let me try to clarify with an example.

In AR(1): yt = φ yt-1 + ut.

- If |φ| <1: stationary.
- If |φ| =1: unit root, non-stationary.
- If |φ| >1: explosive, non-stationary.

So for the AR(2) case, the same logic applies but with multiple roots.

In our problem, the roots are 1 and 0.5.

- The root 1 implies a unit root → non-stationary.
- The root 0.5 is inside the unit circle (|0.5| <1), but wait, in AR(1) when the root is inside (as in |φ|>1 leading to |r|=1/|φ|<1), the process is explosive. But in this case, the root 0.5 would correspond to a φ of 2, which is greater than 1. So in that case, the process would be explosive. But how does that interact with the unit root?

Wait, no. Because in the AR(2) model, the coefficients are φ1=1.5 and φ2=-0.5. So the characteristic equation is r² -1.5 r +0.5=0, as I computed earlier, giving roots 1 and 0.5.

So the presence of the unit root (r=1) implies that the process is a unit root process, hence non-stationary. The other root (0.5) being inside the unit circle would, in isolation, imply an explosive process. But when combined with a unit root, I'm not sure how it behaves. 

But wait, perhaps the key is that because one of the roots is inside the unit circle, the process is explosive. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the presence of a unit root makes it a unit root process, and the other root being inside makes it also explosive. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solution. The general solution for an AR(2) model with roots r1 and r2 is yt = A r1^t + B r2^t + ut. So in this case, yt = A (1)^t + B (0.5)^t + ut. So as t increases, the (0.5)^t term dies out, leaving A + ut. The A is a constant, so the process behaves like a constant plus a random walk (since ut is a white noise term). Wait, no, because ut is white noise, but the ut term doesn't accumulate over time. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the homogeneous solution is A(1)^t + B(0.5)^t. So as t increases, the B(0.5)^t term approaches zero. So the homogeneous part approaches A, a constant. So the particular solution would involve the ut terms, which would be a moving average part. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the unit root (r=1) means that the process is non-stationary, regardless of the other roots. So in this case, the process is a unit root process, hence non-stationary. But is it also explosive? I'm not sure. Because the other root being inside the unit circle (r=0.5) might not contribute to explosiveness, as that term would decay.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall the options. The options are about whether the process is stationary, non-stationary, unit root, or explosive.

The process has a unit root, so it's non-stationary. Does it also qualify as explosive? I'm not sure. I think that an explosive process is one where the variance grows without bound over time. But in this case, the unit root component would lead to a variance that increases over time, similar to a random walk. The other component (r=0.5) would not contribute to that because it's decaying.

Wait, but maybe the process is both non-stationary and explosive. Or perhaps it's just non-stationary because of the unit root. I'm a bit confused about whether an AR(2) with a root at 1 and another inside the unit circle is considered explosive.

Wait, let me think of another approach. The necessary and sufficient condition for an AR(p) process to be stationary is that all roots of the characteristic equation lie outside the unit circle. So in this case, since one root is at 1 (on the circle) and the other is inside, the process is not stationary. It's non-stationary.

Now, for being explosive, I think that occurs when any root lies inside the unit circle, because that would cause the process to exhibit exponential growth. Wait, but in the AR(1) case, when |φ|>1, the process is explosive. So that would correspond to a root inside the unit circle. So yes, in this case, the root at 0.5 (inside) would cause the process to be explosive.

Wait, but wait. The AR(1) model with |φ|>1 is explosive because the coefficient is large, leading to growing terms. But in the AR(2) case, having a root inside the unit circle would mean that the process is explosive. So in this case, because one root is inside, the process is explosive.

But wait, no. Because the solution yt = A(1)^t + B(0.5)^t. So the 0.5 term is decaying, but the 1 term is a constant. So the process would behave like a constant plus a decaying term. That doesn't sound explosive. So maybe the presence of the unit root makes it non-stationary, but the other root being inside doesn't make it explosive. Or perhaps I'm mixing up something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the AR coefficients. For an AR(2) model, the stationarity conditions are:

1. |φ2| <
