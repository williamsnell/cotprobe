The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Police officers had probable cause to believe that a man had committed a series of armed bank robberies with an accomplice. The officers obtained a valid arrest warrant for the man and went to his house to arrest him. The officers found the front door ajar and could hear a radio playing inside. They knocked on the door, identified themselves as police officers, and stated that they had a warrant. Getting no response, the officers entered the house. After the officers called the man's name several times and again identified themselves as police officers, the man emerged from the basement and was arrested. The officers went into the basement to look for the accomplice. They opened a closet door and found cocaine in plain view. They did not find the accomplice. The man was indicted for cocaine possession. He has moved to suppress the cocaine as evidence on the ground that it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?

Options:

A: No, because the officers discovered the cocaine during a lawful protective sweep of the house looking for the man's accomplice.
B: Yes, because the man was not given a chance to surrender before the officers entered the house.
C: Yes, because the officers did not find the accomplice in the house.
D: No, because the officers had a valid arrest warrant for the man.
E: Yes, because the officers entered the house without permission.
F: Yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet.
G: No, because the search was incident to the man's arrest.
H: No, because the officers had probable cause to believe that the man was involved in criminal activity.
I: No, because the cocaine was in plain view when the officers opened the closet.
J: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.

Okay, so I've got this Fourth Amendment question here about whether the court should suppress some cocaine evidence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the situation: Police officers had probable cause to believe a man committed armed bank robberies with an accomplice. They got a valid arrest warrant for him and went to his house. The front door was ajar, they could hear a radio, so they knocked, announced themselves, said they had a warrant. No response, so they entered. They called his name several times, identified themselves again, and he came out of the basement and was arrested. Then they went into the basement looking for the accomplice, opened a closet, found cocaine in plain view. No accomplice found. Now the man is indicted for possession and moves to suppress the evidence.

So the main issue is whether the seizure of the cocaine was constitutional under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. I remember that for evidence to be admissible, it must have been obtained through constitutional means.

The key points here are:

1. The officers had a valid arrest warrant. That generally allows them to enter the suspect's residence to make the arrest, right? So entering the house to arrest him was lawful.

2. After arresting the man, they proceeded to search the basement, looking for the accomplice. I think this might involve the concept of a 'protective sweep.' A protective sweep is a limited search of the premises for the purpose of officer safety, to make sure there aren't other dangerous people around. The Supreme Court in Maryland v. Buie allowed protective sweeps incident to an arrest if the officers have a reasonable belief that there are other dangerous people present.

So, in this case, the officers were looking for an accomplice, which they had probable cause to believe existed. So their protective sweep of the basement could be justified. During this sweep, they opened a closet and found cocaine in plain view.

The plain view doctrine allows officers to seize evidence without a warrant if they are lawfully present in the location where the evidence is in plain sight, the evidence is incriminating, and the officers have a lawful right of access to the object itself.

So putting it together: The arrest warrant allowed them to enter the house. After arresting the man, they did a protective sweep of the basement for the accomplice, which is permissible. During this lawful sweep, they came across the cocaine in plain view in the closet. Therefore, the seizure was lawful, and the evidence shouldn't be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, because they discovered it during a lawful protective sweep. This seems correct based on what I thought.

Option B: Yes, because he wasn't given a chance to surrender. But the officers did announce themselves and had a warrant. The fact that he didn't respond doesn't invalidate the entry, I think.

Option C: Yes, because no accomplice was found. But the protective sweep's legality doesn't depend on finding someone; it's based on the reasonable belief at the time.

Option D: No, because valid arrest warrant. While the warrant allows the arrest, the issue is the search after. So D might not be the best reason.

Option E: Yes, because they entered without permission. But they had a warrant, so entering was allowed.

Option F: Yes, because no probable cause for cocaine. But plain view doesn't require probable cause if they're lawfully present.

Option G: No, because search incident to arrest. But search incident to arrest (chimel) usually applies to the area within the arrestee's reach. The basement might be beyond that, so a protective sweep is a different doctrine.

Option I: No, because plain view. Yes, but only if they were lawfully in the closet.

Option J: Yes, because no search warrant. But a warrant isn't needed if the seizure falls under an exception like plain view during a lawful sweep.

So the correct answer seems to be A. Alternatively, could it be I? Because I says it's because the cocaine was in plain view when they opened the closet. But that's only part of the story—they also had to be lawfully present there.

Wait, the protective sweep allows them to look into the closet. So their entry into the basement and looking into the closet is lawful as part of the sweep. Therefore, when they open the closet and see the cocaine in plain view, they can seize it.

So either A or I could be correct. Option A says it's because of a protective sweep. Option I says because it was in plain view.

Wait, looking back, the question is about the motion to suppress. The issue is whether the seizure was lawful. So the seizure was lawful under plain view, provided they were lawfully present. So the reason they were present was the protective sweep, which is lawful. So both A and I touch on different aspects.

But the options are exclusive, so which one is the correct answer?

Option A: Correct because it was during a lawful protective sweep. So the presence was lawful, and the plain view applies. So A would be the reason.

Alternatively, option I says 'because the cocaine was in plain view'—but that alone isn't enough if they weren't lawfully present. So the more accurate reason is A.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial entry was lawful under the arrest warrant. The protective sweep is allowed, so their presence in the basement was lawful. When they opened the closet, the cocaine was in plain view, so they could seize it.

So the reason the evidence isn't suppressed is because the seizure was lawful under the plain view doctrine, made possible by the lawful protective sweep.

Wait, so the court shouldn't suppress because the officers were lawfully present (due to the protective sweep) and the cocaine was in plain view. So the correct reason would be either A or I.

Looking at the options again:

Option A says it was discovered during a lawful protective sweep looking for the accomplice. That's correct because the protective sweep allowed them to be in the basement, and upon opening the closet, they found it in plain view.

Option I says because the cocaine was in plain view when they opened the closet. That is also correct, but it's a more specific reason. But the broader reason is that the protective sweep made their presence lawful, which allowed the plain view.

In the context of multiple-choice questions, each option is an independent reason. So I think both A and I are correct in a sense, but only one is the best answer.

Wait, but in the options, A and I are separate. So which is the better answer?

The fact pattern says that the officers were looking for the accomplice, so they did a protective sweep. That's a valid exception, so their presence in the basement was lawful. So when they opened the closet, the plain view applied. So the reason the evidence is admissible is because they were lawfully present during a protective sweep, making A the correct answer.

Wait, but could there be an issue with the scope of the protective sweep? Like, how long does it last or what areas can be searched? But in this case, they were in the basement where the suspect was found, so it's within the area where an accomplice might be hiding.

Alternatively, option I says it's because the cocaine was in plain view. But the presence in the closet was legal due to the protective sweep, so without the protective sweep, the plain view wouldn't apply.

So the correct reasoning is that the protective sweep allowed them to be there, making the plain view seizure lawful. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but another point: When they went into the basement, they were looking for the accomplice. So, was the closet part of the area that could be swept? I think so. So their opening the closet was part of the protective sweep, which is allowed.

So, in conclusion, the court should not suppress the evidence because the officers were conducting a lawful protective sweep, which allowed them to find the cocaine in plain view. So the correct answer is A.

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. In this case, the officers had a valid arrest warrant for the man, which allowed them to enter his house to effect the arrest. After arresting him, they conducted a protective sweep of the basement to look for the accomplice. A protective sweep is permissible under Maryland v. Buie if officers have a reasonable belief that other dangerous individuals may be present. Here, the officers had probable cause to believe an accomplice existed, making the protective sweep lawful.

During the sweep, the officers opened a closet and found cocaine in plain view. The plain view doctrine allows officers to seize evidence without a warrant if they are lawfully present, the evidence is incriminating, and they have lawful access to it. Since the officers were lawfully in the basement due to the protective sweep, their discovery of the cocaine in plain view was constitutional.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The cocaine was discovered during a lawful protective sweep, making the seizure constitutional.
- **B**: Incorrect. The man was given an opportunity to surrender when the officers announced themselves, and the lack of response does not invalidate the entry.
- **C**: Incorrect. The legality of a protective sweep does not depend on whether an accomplice is found; it depends on the officers' reasonable belief at the time.
- **D**: Incorrect. While the arrest warrant allowed the officers to enter, the issue is the subsequent search, which is addressed by the protective sweep and plain view doctrines.
- **E**: Incorrect. The officers had a valid arrest warrant, so their entry was lawful.
- **F**: Incorrect. Probable cause for the cocaine is not required under the plain view doctrine if the officers are lawfully present.
- **G**: Incorrect. A search incident to arrest (Chimel) applies to the arrestee's immediate reach, which does not extend to the basement in this case.
- **I**: Partially correct but incomplete. The plain view doctrine applies here, but the officers' lawful presence in the basement was due to the protective sweep, making A the better answer.
- **J**: Incorrect. A search warrant was not required because the seizure fell under the exceptions of protective sweep and plain view.

The best answer is **A**, as the protective sweep justified the officers' presence in the basement, allowing the lawful seizure of the cocaine under the plain view doctrine.

**Answer: A**
