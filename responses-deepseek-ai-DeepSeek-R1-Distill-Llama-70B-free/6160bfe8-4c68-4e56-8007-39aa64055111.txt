Okay, so I've got this question about neurons and their parts. Hmm, I remember that neurons have several components, each with specific functions. The question is asking which part directs the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins. 

Wait, I think the main parts are dendrites, cell body, axon, and the axon terminals. Oh right, the cell body is also called the soma. I remember that the cell body contains the nucleus and the various organelles necessary for protein synthesis. So, like, the ribosomes and stuff are there.

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that the neuron releases to communicate with other cells. Those must be made somewhere in the neuron. Since proteins are involved, and neurotransmitters might be proteins or at least require proteins for their synthesis, it makes sense that the part with the nucleus is doing that. The nucleus holds the DNA, so the cell body must be where transcription happens, telling the ribosomes what proteins to make.

Wait, what about the axon? The axon is more about transmitting signals away from the cell body to other neurons or to muscles or glands. The terminal part of the axon releases neurotransmitters, but does it produce them? I think the production happens in the cell body, and then the neurotransmitters are transported down the axon to the terminals.

So putting it all together, the cell body (soma) is the part that directs the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins. So looking at the options, option G is the cell body.

The cell body, also known as the soma, is the part of the neuron that contains the nucleus and the organelles necessary for protein synthesis, such as ribosomes. It directs the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins, which are then transported to other parts of the neuron, including the axon terminals. 

Answer: G
