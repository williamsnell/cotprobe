Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K.
Silylene $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_2\right)$ is a key intermediate in the thermal decomposition of silicon hydrides such as silane $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_4\right)$ and disilane $\left(\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)$. Moffat et al. (J. Phys. Chem. 95, 145 (1991)) report $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{SiH}_2\right)=+274 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. If $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{SiH}_4\right)=+34.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ and $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)=+80.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$(CRC Handbook (2008)), compute the standard enthalpies of the following reaction:
$\mathrm{SiH}_4 (\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{SiH}_2(\mathrm{g})+\mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g})$

Options:

A: 330 kJ mol^{-1}
B: 255 kJ mol^{-1}
C: 180$\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$
D: 150 kJ mol^{-1}
E:  240$\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$
F: 270 kJ mol^{-1}
G: 300$\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$
H: 120 kJ mol^{-1}
I: 195 kJ mol^{-1}

Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about the decomposition of silane into silylene and hydrogen gas. I remember that the question is asking me to find the standard enthalpy change for the reaction. Hmm, I think I should start by writing down the reaction they provided.

The reaction is SiH4(g) → SiH2(g) + H2(g). Right, so I need to find ΔH° for this reaction. I remember that the standard enthalpy change of a reaction can be calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is ΔH° = Σ ΔfH°(products) - Σ ΔfH°(reactants).

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. Yes, the enthalpy change is the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus the sum for the reactants.

Looking at the reaction, the reactant is SiH4, and the products are SiH2 and H2. So I need the ΔfH° values for each of these.

From the problem statement, I see the given data:
- ΔfH°(SiH2) is +274 kJ/mol.
- ΔfH°(SiH4) is +34.3 kJ/mol.
- ΔfH°(Si2H6) is +80.3 kJ/mol, but I don't think that's needed here since it's not part of this reaction.

Wait, but what about H2? Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation for elemental hydrogen (H2) is zero because it's in its standard state. So ΔfH°(H2) = 0 kJ/mol.

So plugging into the formula, the reaction is:
ΔH° = [ΔfH°(SiH2) + ΔfH°(H2)] - [ΔfH°(SiH4)]

Substituting the numbers:
ΔH° = (274 + 0) - (34.3) = 274 - 34.3 = 239.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 239.7 exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A:330, B:255, C:180, D:150, E:240, F:270, G:300, H:120, I:195, J:210.

Hmm, E is 240, which is very close to my calculation of 239.7. Maybe it's rounded up, so 240 kJ/mol would be the correct choice. So the answer should be option E.

Wait a second, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. 274 minus 34.3 is indeed 239.7, which is approximately 240. So yes, E is the right choice.

To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction:

\[
\mathrm{SiH}_4 (\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{SiH}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}),
\]

we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\ominus = \sum \Delta_f H^\ominus (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta_f H^\ominus (\text{reactants}).
\]

From the problem, the given data is:
- \(\Delta_f H^\ominus (\mathrm{SiH}_2) = +274 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\),
- \(\Delta_f H^\ominus (\mathrm{SiH}_4) = +34.3 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\),
- \(\Delta_f H^\ominus (\mathrm{H}_2) = 0 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\) (since it is in its standard state).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\ominus = \left( \Delta_f H^\ominus (\mathrm{SiH}_2) + \Delta_f H^\ominus (\mathrm{H}_2) \right) - \Delta_f H^\ominus (\mathrm{SiH}_4),
\]

\[
\Delta H^\ominus = (274 + 0) - 34.3 = 239.7 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

This value is approximately \(240 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\), which matches option E. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 240 kJ mol\(^{-1}\).**
