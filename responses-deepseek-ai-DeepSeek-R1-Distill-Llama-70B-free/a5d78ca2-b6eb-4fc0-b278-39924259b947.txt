Okay, so I've got this problem about helium diffusing into a evacuated flask, and I need to calculate the pressure after a month. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand all the details. The flask is made of Pyrex glass, and it's round with a volume of 100 cm³. The wall thickness is 0.7 mm. It's evacuated to 1e-12 atm and sealed. I'm supposed to find the pressure after one month due to helium's inward diffusion.

The permeability of Pyrex to helium at 20°C is given as 4.9e-13 cm³ s⁻¹ per millimeter thickness and per millibar partial pressure difference. Oh, and the atmospheric helium content is 5e-4 mol percent. 

Wait, mol percent is like mole fraction, right? So the partial pressure of helium outside the flask would be that mole fraction multiplied by the atmospheric pressure. But what's the atmospheric pressure in mbar? I remember that 1 atm is about 101325 Pa, which is 1013.25 mbar. So the partial pressure of He outside is 5e-4 * 1013.25 mbar. 

But wait, the permeability is given per mbar of partial pressure difference. So since the flask is evacuated, the pressure inside is initially 1e-12 atm, which is way lower than atmospheric pressure. So the pressure difference is roughly the atmospheric partial pressure of He.

So the helium outside is at P = 5e-4 * 1013.25 mbar. Let me compute that. 5e-4 is 0.0005, multiplied by 1013.25 gives 0.506625 mbar. So the partial pressure difference ΔP is approximately 0.506625 mbar because inside is almost zero.

The permeability (let me call it K) is 4.9e-13 cm³/(s·mm·mbar). Since the wall thickness is 0.7 mm, I need to adjust K for that. So K' would be K multiplied by the thickness. Wait, no, wait. Permeability is given per mm thickness. So if the glass is 0.7 mm thick, the permeability would be K = 4.9e-13 cm³/(s·mm·mbar) multiplied by 0.7 mm. So 4.9e-13 * 0.7 = 3.43e-13 cm³/(s·mbar).

Wait, no. Wait, the units are cm³ s⁻¹ per mm thickness and per mbar. So the formula for the diffusion rate is probably (permeability) * (thickness) * (pressure difference). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the formula.

The formula for the rate of gas flow due to diffusion through a material is given by:

Q = (P * A * t) / (thickness), where P is the permeability.

Wait, maybe better to recall Fick's law for diffusion through a membrane. The molar flux J is given by J = -D * (ΔC)/Δx, but in terms of volume and permeability, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

Rate of gas flow (volume per time) = (permeability) * (area) * (pressure difference) / (thickness).

Wait, the permeability is given as cm³ s⁻¹ per mm thickness and per mbar. So the units are (cm³/s) per (mm * mbar). So the formula should be:

Flow rate (cm³/s) = (permeability) * (area in cm²) * (ΔP in mbar) / (thickness in mm).

Wait, no. Because the permeability already includes the thickness and pressure terms. Wait, let me think. Let me check the units more carefully.

The permeability K is given in cm³/(s·mm·mbar). So to get cm³/s, we need to multiply K by (mm) and (mbar), and the area.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Flow rate = K * A * (ΔP) / thickness?

Hmm, no, because K already includes per mm, so if the thickness is d mm, then perhaps the correct formula is:

Flow rate (cm³/s) = (K) * (A) * (ΔP) / (d), where d is in mm.

Wait, let me think about the units. K is cm³/(s·mm·mbar). So when we multiply by A (cm²), ΔP (mbar), and divide by d (mm), the units would be:

(cm³/(s·mm·mbar)) ) * cm² * mbar / mm = (cm³ * cm² * mbar) ) / (s * mm^2 * mbar) ). Wait, that doesn't look right. Maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Flow rate (cm³/s) = (K * A * ΔP) / d,

where K is in cm³/(s·mm·mbar), A is area in cm², ΔP in mbar, and d in mm.

Wait, let me plug the units:

[ K ] = cm³/(s * mm * mbar)

[ A ] = cm²

[ ΔP ] = mbar

[ d ] = mm

So (K * A * ΔP) / d = (cm³/(s mm mbar) ) * cm² * mbar ) / mm

= (cm³ * cm² * mbar) ) / (s * mm * mbar * mm )

= (cm⁵ mbar) ) / (s * mm² * mbar )

Wait, that's not working out. Maybe I should think about this differently. Perhaps the correct expression is:

The flow rate Q is equal to (permeability) multiplied by the area, multiplied by the pressure difference, and then divided by the thickness.

So Q = (K) * A * (ΔP) / d,

where d is the thickness in mm.

So the units would be:

cm³/(s·mm·mbar) ) * cm² * mbar ) / mm

= (cm³ * cm² * mbar ) ) / (s * mm * mbar * mm )

= cm⁵ / (s * mm² )

But 1 cm² is (10 mm)^2 = 100 mm², so cm² = 100 mm².

So cm⁵ = (10 mm)^5 = 1e5 mm^5.

So putting it together:

(cm^5) / (s * mm^2 ) ) = (1e5 mm^5) / (s * mm^2 ) ) = 1e5 mm^3 / s.

But 1 cm³ is 1e3 mm³ (since 1 cm = 10 mm, volume is (10)^3 = 1e3 mm³/cm³). So 1e5 mm³/s is 1e5 / 1e3 = 1e2 cm³/s.

Wait, this isn't making sense. I think I'm getting stuck on the unit analysis, which is making this more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Q = (K * A * (P1 - P2)) / d,

where K is the permeability, A is area, P1 and P2 are pressures, d is thickness.

But let's think about the process. The flask is sealed, so the only way gas gets in is by diffusion through the walls. The rate at which gas flows into the flask is proportional to the area, the pressure difference, and inversely proportional to the thickness. So the formula must be something like Q = (K * A * ΔP) / d,

where Q is in cm³/s.

So given that, we can calculate the flow rate, then multiply by time to get the total volume that has entered, and then use PV = nRT to find the pressure.

Wait, but the problem gives the permeability as 4.9e-13 cm³/(s·mm·mbar). So the units of K are cm³ per (second * mm * mbar). So when you multiply by area (cm²), pressure difference (mbar), and divide by thickness (mm), you get:

(cm³/(s·mm·mbar)) ) * cm² * mbar / mm = (cm³ * cm² * mbar) / (s * mm * mbar * mm )

Hmm, let's compute the units:

Numerator: cm³ * cm² = cm^5

Denominator: s * mm * mm = s * mm²

So units are cm^5/(s * mm² )

But I need to convert that to cm³/s.

Wait, perhaps I should express all units in mm instead.

1 cm = 10 mm, so 1 cm² = 100 mm², and 1 cm³ = 1000 mm³.

So let's substitute:

cm^5 = (10 mm)^5 = 1e5 mm^5.

So cm^5/(s * mm² ) = (1e5 mm^5) / (s * mm² ) ) = 1e5 mm^3/s.

But 1 mm³ is 1e-3 cm³ (since 1 cm³ = 1e3 mm³, so 1 mm³ = 1e-3 cm³). Wait, no, 1 cm³ is (10 mm)^3 = 1000 mm³, so 1 mm³ is 0.001 cm³.

So 1e5 mm³/s = 1e5 * 0.001 cm³/s = 100 cm³/s.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the permeability is a very small number, so the flow rate should be tiny.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to look for the correct formula.

Wait, I think the formula is:

Flow rate (Q) = (Permeability) * (Area) * (Pressure difference) / (Thickness)

So Q = (K) * (A) * (ΔP) / d.

Where K is in cm³/(s·mm·mbar), A in cm², ΔP in mbar, d in mm.

So plugging in the numbers:

K = 4.9e-13 cm³/(s·mm·mbar)
A = surface area of the flask
ΔP = 0.506625 mbar (from earlier)
d = 0.7 mm

So the flow rate is:

Q = (4.9e-13) * A * (0.506625) / 0.7

But I need to compute A, the surface area of the flask. The flask is round, so it's a sphere? Or a cylinder? The problem says it's a round flask, so probably a sphere. Wait, no, maybe a cylindrical flask, but the term 'round' is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the volume is 100 cm³. Let's think about the shape.

Wait, the problem says it's a round 100 cm³ Pyrex flask. So perhaps it's a sphere, but more likely, it's a cylindrical flask with a circular cross-section, but I'm not sure. Without more information, perhaps I can assume it's a sphere.

Wait, but for a sphere, the volume is (4/3)πr³, and the surface area is 4πr². For a cylinder, the volume is πr² h, and surface area would be 2πr² + 2πr h, but if it's a tall cylinder, maybe the area is approx 2πr h. But without knowing the dimensions, perhaps the problem expects us to treat it as a thin-walled sphere or cylinder, and the area can be approximated using the volume.

Wait, maybe I should compute the surface area for a sphere. Let me try that.

Volume V = (4/3) π r³ = 100 cm³ → r³ = (3 * 100) / (4 π) → r^3 ≈ (300) / (12.566) ≈ 23.87 cm³ → r ≈ cube root of 23.87 is approx 2.88 cm. Then surface area A = 4 π r² ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * (2.88)^2 ≈ 4 *3.1416*8.294 ≈ 4 * 26.06 ≈ 104.24 cm².

If it's a sphere, that's the area. Alternatively, if it's a cylinder, perhaps the surface area is larger. For example, for a cylinder with volume V=πr² h=100 cm³. If we assume that the height h is equal to 2r (a common assumption for minimal surface area), then r = cube root(100/(π * 2)) ≈ cube root (15.915) ≈ 2.51 cm. Then the surface area would be 2πr² + 2πr h. Since h=2r, it's 2πr² + 4πr² = 6π r² ≈ 6 * 3.1416 * (2.51)^2 ≈ 6 * 3.1416 * 6.30 ≈ 6 * 19.78 ≈ 118.7 cm².

But without knowing the exact shape, maybe the problem expects me to treat it as a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem says 'round' as in a round-bottom flask, which is typically a sphere. So I'll proceed with the sphere's surface area of approximately 104.24 cm².

Wait, but maybe the question doesn't require the exact area because it's a round flask, perhaps the area can be calculated using another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem gives the volume as 100 cm³, and the flask is considered to have a thickness of 0.7 mm, but perhaps the area doesn't depend on the shape because it's given as a round flask, so maybe we can use a formula that relates volume and surface area, but that's probably complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula for the surface area in terms of the volume for a thin-walled sphere.

Wait, for a thin-walled sphere, the volume is approximately V ≈ (4/3) π r³, and surface area is 4 π r². So if I have V, I can find r, then compute A.

So with V=100 cm³, r³ = (3 * V)/(4 π) = (3*100)/(4 *3.1416) ≈ 300/(12.566) ≈ 23.87 cm³ → r ≈ 2.88 cm.

So surface area A = 4 π r² ≈ 4 *3.1416*(2.88)^2 ≈ 4*3.1416*8.294 ≈ 4*26.06 ≈ 104.24 cm².

So the area A is approx 104.24 cm².

Now, let's calculate the flow rate Q.

Q = (4.9e-13 cm³/(s·mm·mbar)) * (104.24 cm²) * (0.506625 mbar) / (0.7 mm)

Wait, let's plug in the numbers step by step.

First, multiply K and A:

4.9e-13 * 104.24 = 4.9e-13 * 1.0424e2 = approx 5.11e-11 cm³/(s·mm·mbar) * cm².

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

4.9e-13 * 104.24 = 4.9 * 104.24 = let's compute 4 * 104.24 = 416.96, 0.9 * 104.24=93.816 → total 510.776. So 510.776e-13 = 5.10776e-11 cm³/(s·mm·mbar) * cm².

Wait, but the units are getting tricky here. Let me think again. The formula is Q = K * A * ΔP / d.

So K is in cm³/(s·mm·mbar), A is in cm², ΔP is in mbar, and d is in mm.

So when we multiply K (cm³/(s mm mbar)) by A (cm²), ΔP (mbar), and divide by d (mm), the units become:

(cm³ * cm² * mbar) / (s * mm * mbar * mm) → cm^5/(s * mm²).

But as I thought earlier, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

So Q = (4.9e-13) * (104.24) * (0.506625) / (0.7)

Calculate numerator first: 4.9e-13 * 104.24 = 5.10776e-11.

Then multiply by 0.506625: 5.10776e-11 * 0.506625 ≈ 2.588e-11.

Then divide by 0.7: 2.588e-11 / 0.7 ≈ 3.698e-11 cm³/s.

Wait, but wait, the calculation steps:

Compute 4.9e-13 * 104.24 = 4.9 * 104.24 = let me compute that accurately.

4.9 * 100 = 490, 4.9 * 4.24 = approx 20.776 → total 510.776 → 510.776e-13 = 5.10776e-11.

Then 5.10776e-11 * 0.506625 ≈ 5.10776e-11 * 0.5 = 2.55388e-11, and 5.10776e-11 * 0.006625 ≈ 3.3853e-13 → total ≈ 2.55388e-11 + 0.033853e-11 = 2.58773e-11.

Then divide by 0.7: 2.58773e-11 / 0.7 ≈ 3.698e-11 cm³/s.

Wait, so Q ≈ 3.698e-11 cm³/s.

Now, over one month, which is 30 days, we need to find the total volume that has diffused into the flask.

Time t = 30 days = 30 * 24 * 3600 seconds. Let's compute that.

30 * 24 = 720 hours. 720 * 3600 = 2,592,000 seconds.

So total volume V_total = Q * t = 3.698e-11 cm³/s * 2.592e6 s ≈ 3.698e-11 * 2.592e6 = approx 9.57e-5 cm³.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

3.698e-11 * 2.592e6 =
