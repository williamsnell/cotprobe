Question:

A state legislature has recently enacted an obscenity statute prohibiting "the selling or offering for sale of any obscene printed or video materials. " Following numerous complaints from a local citizens' group, the police entered an adult bookstore, examined materials on the shelves, and purchased magazines that depicted actual pictures of sexual intercourse. The owner was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the state obscenity law. At his trial, the owner's defense was that the sale of the materials complained of was constitutionally protected speech. Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?

Options:

A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors.
B: The particular materials involved were sold to consenting adults only.
C: The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.
D: The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.
E: The particular materials involved were part of a larger collection of non-explicit content.
F: The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.
G: The particular materials were imported and not produced in the state.
H: 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with obscenity. Hmm, I remember that obscenity isn't protected by the First Amendment, but there are some specific tests for determining what's obscene. Let me think through this.

The question says a state enacted an obscenity statute prohibiting the sale of obscene materials. The police went into an adult bookstore, bought some magazines showing actual sexual intercourse, and the owner was charged. The owner's defense is that this is protected speech. So, I need to figure out what fact would help the owner's case.

The options are A to H. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors. I think this might not matter because if the material is considered obscene, selling it to adults might still be prohibited. The Supreme Court case I'm recalling, like Ginsberg v. New York, dealt with selling to minors, but that was about whether the law was too broad. But here, the sale is to adults, so maybe this point isn't directly helpful.

Option B: The materials were sold to consenting adults only. Wait, I remember something about the privacy of the home and that the state can't prohibit the sale of obscene materials to consenting adults in private. Oh, right! The case is Stanley v. Georgia, where the Court said that possessing obscene material in the privacy of one's home is protected. But wait, does that apply to selling? Maybe not directly. Because Stanley was about possession, not sale. So maybe B isn't the best option.

Option C: The materials were serious scientific studies. Ah, yes! The Miller test, which is used to determine obscenity, has three parts. One of them is whether the work lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. So if the material is a serious scientific study, it might not meet the third prong of being obscene. That could help the owner argue that the material isn't obscene and thus protected.

Option D: The police didn't have a search warrant. Well, if the police entered without a warrant, that's a Fourth Amendment issue. But the question is about the constitutionality of the sale as speech. So even if the evidence was obtained illegally, that might lead to suppression of evidence, but if the law itself is unconstitutional, that's a different matter. The owner's defense here is about the First Amendment, not about procedural issues. So D might not be the best choice.

Option E: Part of a larger collection of non-explicit content. I'm not sure how this helps. Maybe it's about the context, but I don't recall a specific case where the surrounding material affects the obscenity determination. The Miller test focuses on the work as a whole. So maybe E isn't the key.

Option F: Depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct. The Miller test also looks at whether the material depicts sexual conduct in a way that's patently offensive under contemporary community standards. So whether it's normal or deviant might affect that second prong, but I'm not sure. It could go either way, but I'm not certain if this is the strongest point.

Option G: The materials were imported, not produced in the state. I don't think the origin affects the obscenity determination. The issue is the content, not where it's made. So G probably doesn't help.

Option H: 85% of citizens believe the material doesn't contribute to antisocial behavior. The Miller test uses community standards, but I think it's about whether the average person would find it appealing to prurient interests and patently offensive. Public opinion about the effects might not directly tie into the legal test for obscenity. The test is more about the content itself rather than public perception of its impact.

So, putting it all together. The Miller test requires that the material must (1) appeal to the prurient interest, (2) depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and (3) lack serious literary, artistic, etc., value. If the materials are serious scientific studies (Option C), that would satisfy the third prong, meaning they don't lack value and thus aren't obscene. That would make the statute's application unconstitutional in this case, helping the owner's defense.

Wait, but could there be another option? Like Option B about consenting adults. But as I thought earlier, Stanley was about possession, not sale. The case here is about selling, so maybe the state can regulate the sale even to adults if it's obscene. But if the material isn't obscene because it has serious value (Option C), then the sale is protected.

So I think the best answer is C.

To determine which fact would most help the bookstore owner's defense, it is essential to analyze the options under the legal framework for obscenity. The Supreme Court's Miller test establishes that material is obscene if it: (1) appeals to the prurient interest, (2) depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and (3) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. If any of these elements is not met, the material is not obscene and is protected under the First Amendment.

- **Option A**: A policy against selling to minors does not directly address whether the material is obscene under the Miller test. Obscenity laws can still apply to sales to adults if the material meets the criteria for obscenity. This is not the strongest defense.

- **Option B**: Selling to consenting adults only does not negate the possibility of obscenity. While privacy rights in possession of obscene material in the home (as in *Stanley v. Georgia*) are protected, the sale of obscene material is a separate issue and can still be regulated.

- **Option C**: If the materials are serious scientific studies, they would likely satisfy the third prong of the Miller test by demonstrating serious scientific value. This would mean the material is not obscene and is constitutionally protected, making this the strongest defense.

- **Option D**: The absence of a search warrant raises a Fourth Amendment issue, but it does not address the First Amendment question of whether the material is obscene. The owner's defense focuses on constitutional protection of speech, not procedural errors.

- **Option E**: Being part of a larger collection of non-explicit content does not directly impact the obscenity determination, as the Miller test evaluates the material in question as a whole.

- **Option F**: Depicting normal sexual conduct may influence the second prong of the Miller test (patently offensive), but it is not as definitive as demonstrating serious value under the third prong.

- **Option G**: The origin of the material (imported vs. produced in-state) is irrelevant to the obscenity determination, which focuses on content, not provenance.

- **Option H**: Public opinion about the material's effects does not directly align with the Miller test, which focuses on the content itself, not societal perceptions of its impact.

The most helpful fact for the owner's defense is that the materials are serious scientific studies, as this directly satisfies the third prong of the Miller test, making the material non-obscene and constitutionally protected.
