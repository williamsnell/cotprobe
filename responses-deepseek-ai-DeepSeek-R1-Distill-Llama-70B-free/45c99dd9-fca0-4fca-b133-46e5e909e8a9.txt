Okay, so I've got this question about auditor independence and nonaudit services. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me remember what I learned about this topic.

The question is asking which nonaudit service provided by an auditor to an issuer client would impair independence or require audit committee preapproval. The options are A through H, and I need to pick the correct exception.

First, I recall that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC have rules about what nonaudit services auditors can provide. The idea is that certain services might create conflicts of interest and impair the auditor's independence. So, the auditor can't provide services that are prohibited, and some services need preapproval from the audit committee.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Nonaudit services directly related to the issuer's business operations. Hmm, I think services related to operations are generally allowed if they don't involve management responsibilities. But wait, some direct operational services might be prohibited if they're considered management functions. I'm not sure yet. Let me check the others.

Option B: Services related to preparing financial statements. Wait, isn't that prohibited? Because the auditor is supposed to audit the financials, and if they also prepare them, that's a conflict. Like, they can't audit their own work. So this might be a prohibited service, meaning the auditor can't provide it without losing independence. But does it require preapproval or is it outright banned? I think it's prohibited, so providing it would impair independence regardless of preapproval.

Option C: Financial information systems design and implementation. Oh, right, designing financial systems can be a problem. If the auditor designs the system they later audit, that's a conflict. So this is prohibited. So the auditor can't provide this without impairing independence.

Option D: Services not recognized as nonaudit at engagement time. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The auditor should know what counts as nonaudit. If they didn't recognize it, maybe it's allowed? Or perhaps this is a loophole. I'm not sure, but I think the key is whether the service is prohibited. If it's not a prohibited service, then maybe it's allowed. But if it is prohibited, they can't do it regardless.

Option E: Legal advice. Oh yeah, providing legal services, especially on matters like audits, is definitely prohibited. Because if the auditor gives legal advice, it could influence the audit. So this would impair independence, so it's not allowed.

Option F: Services with revenues under 5%. I remember that if the nonaudit fees are less than 5% of the total fees, they might be allowed without preapproval. So this is an exception. So this wouldn't require preapproval because it's below the threshold.

Option G: Services approved by the audit committee before the audit is done. Wait, preapproval is usually required for non-prohibited services. If they get approval promptly, then it's okay. So this is allowed as long as the committee approves it. But the question is about which service does not require preapproval, so this might not be the exception because it was approved. Hmm, maybe not the answer.

Option H: Tax planning and compliance. Tax services are generally allowed as nonaudit services. But wait, I think tax planning is allowed, but compliance might be okay too. Or does tax planning cross a line? I'm a bit confused here. I thought that tax services that aren't related to bookkeeping are permissible. So maybe tax planning is allowed without preapproval, but I'm not certain.

Now, the question is asking which service cannot be provided without impairing independence or without audit committee preapproval. So the correct answer is the service that is prohibited, meaning the auditor can't provide it at all, regardless of preapproval.

Looking back, option B is about preparing financial statements. Since the auditor cannot prepare financial statements for the client they're auditing, this service is prohibited. Therefore, the auditor cannot provide this service without impairing independence, so preapproval isn't even possible.

Similarly, option C and E are also prohibited. But the question is about which is the exception to the preapproval requirement. Wait, the question says except which one. So the other options are allowed without preapproval, except for one.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "may provide... without impairing independence and without obtaining preapproval, except...". So the correct answer is the one that they cannot provide without preapproval, i.e., it's prohibited or requires preapproval.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says, which of the following is an exception—meaning that for all except one, the auditor can provide the service without preapproval. The except is the one that can't be provided without preapproval or impairs independence.

Wait, no, the question is: "may provide... without impairing independence and without obtaining preapproval of the audit committee, except" which one. So all options except the correct answer are allowed without preapproval. The correct answer is the one that cannot be provided without preapproval.

Wait, or is it the one that's prohibited, so cannot be provided at all, regardless of preapproval. Because some services are prohibited, meaning the auditor can't provide them at all, while others require preapproval.

So, the question's asking which service cannot be provided without preapproval (i.e., requires preapproval) or impairs independence (i.e., is prohibited). The options are looking for the one that is either prohibited or requires preapproval, thus being the exception to the rule that the others can be provided without preapproval.

So, the correct answer is the service that's prohibited. Because the others can be provided without preapproval, but the prohibited ones can't be provided at all, making them the exception.

Looking again, option B: nonaudit services related to the preparation of financial statements—this is prohibited. So the auditor can't provide this service without impairing independence, even with preapproval.

Similarly, option C is about financial info systems—this is also prohibited, I think.

Wait, but the options are all possibilities, and the question is which is the exception. So maybe the correct answer is option B.

Wait, let me try to remember the prohibited services. The main prohibited services include:

- Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements (so option B is prohibited)
- Financial information systems design (option C is prohibited)
- Legal services (option E is prohibited)
- Management functions or human resources (not in the options)
- Broker-dealer services (not in the options)
- Investment advisory services (not in the options)
- Promotion or marketing (not in the options)

So, options B, C, and E are prohibited. So the auditor cannot provide these without impairing independence.

The question is phrased as: which service can the auditor provide without preapproval except for this one. So the options that are prohibited can't be provided at all, thus they are the exceptions.

Looking back at the options, the question is which service cannot be provided without preapproval. Wait, no: the question is which service cannot be provided without impairing independence or without preapproval. So the answer is the service that is prohibited, regardless of preapproval.

So in the options, the correct answer would be B, C, or E.

But let's check the exact rule. The SEC rules state that certain nonaudit services are prohibited, and others require preapproval.

The prohibited services include:

- Bookkeeping or accounting services
- Financial systems design
- Legal services
- etc.

So from the options, B, C, E are prohibited.

The question is which one is the exception, i.e., the one that cannot be provided without preapproval or impairs independence. So the correct answer would be one of these.

But the options are given as possible answers, and the question is phrased as which is the exception to the allowed services without preapproval.

Wait, the other options: A, D, F, G, H.

Option F: less than 5% of fees. I think that's allowed without preapproval.

Option G: approved by the audit committee before the audit is done. So that's allowed because it's preapproved.

So, the prohibited services are B, C, E. So among the options, these are the ones that cannot be provided, thus being the exception.

The question is, which of the following is the exception, meaning the auditor cannot provide it without preapproval or it's prohibited. So the answer must be B, C, or E.

But the question is phrased as: "may provide... without impairing independence and without obtaining preapproval of the audit committee, except".

So the except is the one they cannot provide without preapproval or it's prohibited.

So, in the options, the ones that are prohibited (B, C, E) cannot be provided even with preapproval. Wait, no, prohibited services can't be provided at all, regardless of preapproval.

So the correct answer is one of these.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is which is the exception, meaning which service can't be provided without preapproval. Wait, but prohibited services can't be provided, period. So perhaps the question is looking for the prohibited service, which is the exception.

In the options, the correct answer is B, C, or E.

But let me think about the exact rules again. The SEC has a list of prohibited nonaudit services, which include:

1. Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements (so option B is prohibited)
2. Financial information systems design and implementation (option C is prohibited)
3. Appraisal or valuation services
4. Actuarial services
5. Internal audit outsourcing
6. Management functions or human resources
7. Broker-dealer services
8. Investment adviser services
9. Legal services (option E is prohibited)

So B, C, E are prohibited, meaning the auditor cannot provide them under any circumstances, even with preapproval.

Therefore, the answer should be one of these.

Looking at the options, the question is which one is the exception. So the correct answer is either B, C, or E.

But the question is phrased as which service may NOT be provided without preapproval, i.e., which is prohibited.

So, among the options, B, C, and E are prohibited, thus cannot be provided without impairing independence, making them the exceptions.

But the options are A to H, and only one is correct.

So, the question is which one is the exception. So from the options, the answer should be B, C, or E.

But looking back at the question, the options are labeled A to H, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, I think the correct answer is B: Nonaudit services related to the preparation of financial statements.

Because that's directly related to the financials the auditor would be auditing, which is a clear conflict.

So the answer is B.
</think>

The question asks which nonaudit service an auditor cannot provide to an issuer client without impairing independence or without obtaining preapproval from the audit committee. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules prohibit certain nonaudit services if they create conflicts of interest or impair independence. These prohibited services include:

1. **Bookkeeping or accounting services related to financial statements** (Option B): This is prohibited because the auditor cannot prepare financial statements that they will later audit, as it creates a direct conflict of interest.
2. **Financial information systems design and implementation** (Option C): This is also prohibited because designing the systems that will be audited creates a conflict of interest.
3. **Legal services** (Option E): Providing legal advice, especially on audit-related matters, is prohibited as it can influence the audit.

Among the options, Option B stands out as the correct answer because it directly involves the preparation of financial statements, which is a core prohibited service. The auditor cannot provide this service under any circumstances, even with preapproval, as it fundamentally impairs independence.

ANSWER: B
