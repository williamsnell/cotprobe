Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a historical event involving Lin Zexu and his letter to Queen Victoria. I'm a bit rusty on my Chinese history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Lin Zexu was a Chinese official during the Qing dynasty. He's famous for his role in the Opium Wars. The question is about the outcome after he sent a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839. The letter itself talks about the opium trade, saying that foreigners are sending opium which harms China, and points out the hypocrisy because Britain prohibits opium at home but exports it to China.

So, what happened after Lin sent this letter? I think the letter was part of the events leading up to the Opium Wars. Lin Zexu had confiscated and destroyed a lot of opium, which was a bold move. The British were not happy about that. I believe this led to the First Opium War (1839-1842), where the British forced China to sign the Treaty of Nanking. 

Looking at the options provided:

A: Expulsion of all foreigners. I don't think that happened immediately. The expulsion might have been more of a Chinese desire, but the British didn't leave; instead, they went to war.

B: Violent uprisings by pro-British Muslims. I'm not sure about this. There were Muslim groups in China, but I don't recall this being a direct outcome of the letter.

C: British compensated China. No, I think the opposite happened. China had to pay indemnities after losing the war.

D: Peaceful coexistence. That doesn't make sense because the war was the result, not peace.

E: Successful ban. The opium trade didn't stop; in fact, the treaties might have allowed more trade.

F: Hong Kong ceded to China. Wait, no. The Treaty of Nanking ceded Hong Kong to Britain, right? So this option is the opposite.

G: Queen Victoria responded. I don't think she directly replied. The letter was more of a diplomatic move, but the response was probably military action.

H: Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms. This sounds right. The Opium Wars led to China's defeat. The new terms were more favorable to the West, like the Treaty of Nanking.

I: British apology and stopped trade. No, the war led to Britain continuing the opium trade, but under more formal terms perhaps.

J: Anti-opium movement in Britain. I don't think the letter caused that. The movement might have existed, but the outcome after the letter was war.

So, the correct outcome was that China lost the war, leading to new trade terms. So option H is the answer.
</think>

The letter by Lin Zexu to Queen Victoria in 1839 was a significant event leading to the First Opium War. Lin's actions, including confiscating and destroying opium, were met with hostility from the British. The war resulted in China's defeat and the signing of the Treaty of Nanking, which imposed unfavorable trade terms on China, benefiting the West. 

Option H correctly identifies the outcome as China's naval defeat and new trade terms favoring the West.

Answer: H
