Okay, so I've got this Bible question here, and I need to figure out the answer. The question is asking about Moses and Aaron's sister. Hmm, I remember that Moses and Aaron are two important figures in the Bible, especially in the story of the Exodus. But wait, what about their sister? I think her name starts with an M... Maybe Miriam? I've heard that name before in the context of the Exodus story.

Let me think. Moses and Aaron are brothers, right? And they have a sister who plays a role in their early story. I think she's the one who watches over Moses when he's placed in the Nile River as a baby. Oh right, when their mother puts Moses in a basket to save him from Pharaoh's decree, the sister watches from a distance. Later, she suggests their mother as a nurse to Pharaoh's daughter, which is how Moses ends up being raised by his own mother in the palace.

So Miriam must be the sister. She's also a prophetess and leads the women in singing after the parting of the Red Sea. I remember that song, the Miriam's song, where they celebrate the victory over the Egyptians. So that must be her.

Looking at the options, option E is Miriam. That makes sense. The other options don't seem right. Jochebed is actually their mother, isn't she? Because she's the one who puts Moses in the basket. So A is their mother, not sister. So E has to be the correct answer.

The sister of Moses and Aaron is Miriam. She plays a significant role in their story, including watching over Moses as a baby and celebrating the Exodus with a song. Among the options, E: Miriam is correct.
