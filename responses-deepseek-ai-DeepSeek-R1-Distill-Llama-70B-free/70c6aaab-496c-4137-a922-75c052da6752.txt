Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the role of frustration in human aggression. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that there's something called the frustration-aggression hypothesis. Let me think about what that was.

Okay, so the hypothesis basically says that frustration leads to aggression. Frustration is when someone is blocked from achieving a goal, right? Like when you really want something but can't get it. That makes you feel frustrated, and that feeling can turn into aggression.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this idea. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says frustration is a form of aggression. Wait, no, I think frustration is more like a cause or a precursor, not the same as aggression. So A might not be correct.

Option B says frustration leads to aggression only in people with a genetic predisposition to violence. I'm not sure about this. I think the hypothesis doesn't necessarily limit it to just genetically predisposed individuals. It's more general, like frustration can lead to aggression in anyone, though maybe some people are more prone due to various factors.

Option C claims frustration is always from external stimuli and never causes aggression. That doesn't sound right. Because the hypothesis does link frustration to aggression, so C is probably wrong.

Option D suggests aggression happens spontaneously without preceding emotions like frustration. That contradicts what I remember because the hypothesis says frustration is a preceding emotion leading to aggression. So D is incorrect.

Option E states frustration is unrelated to aggression and is only environmental. Wait, no, the question is about the link between them, so E can't be right because it's saying they're unrelated.

Option F says frustration arises when someone feels deprived of something they think they deserve, which may lead to aggression. That rings a bell. It sounds like the definition I learned. Frustration occurs when a desired goal is blocked, and that can cause aggressive behavior. So F seems like a strong candidate.

Option G claims frustration is a result of aggression. That's the opposite of what I know. Aggression might cause frustration in others, but the question is about frustration leading to aggression, so G is wrong.

Option H says aggression only happens in painful situations. I don't think that's right. Aggression can come from various emotions, not just pain. Plus, the question is about frustration, so H is irrelevant here.

Option I states frustration is a direct cause of aggression. I remember the hypothesis does say frustration causes aggression, but I think it's more of a tendency rather than a direct cause every time. So maybe I is too absolute. Or perhaps it's correct. I'm a bit confused between F and I now.

Option J says aggression is always a conscious choice, and frustration is minor. That doesn't fit because sometimes aggression can be impulsive, not always a conscious decision. Plus, the hypothesis suggests frustration plays a bigger role than minor.

Wait, the frustration-aggression hypothesis does say that frustration leads to some form of aggression, but it's not always a direct or sole cause. There are other factors too. So which option is better, F or I?

Option F says frustration may lead to aggression, implying that it's a possible cause, not an absolute. Option I says it's a direct cause, which might be too strong. The hypothesis suggests that frustration increases the likelihood of aggression, but doesn't guarantee it. So F seems more accurate because it uses "may lead," acknowledging that it's not the only factor.

So the correct answer should be F.

The role of frustration in human aggression is best explained by the frustration-aggression hypothesis, which posits that frustration—a feeling that arises when a person is deprived of something they feel they deserve—can lead to aggressive behavior. This hypothesis emphasizes that frustration increases the likelihood of aggression, though it is not the sole or direct cause in every situation. Among the options provided, the one that aligns most closely with this understanding is:

**F: Frustration arises when a person feels they deserve something and are deprived, which may lead to aggression.**

Answer: F
