Okay, so I've got this problem about a pseudoplastic non-Newtonian fluid flowing through a pipe, and I need to find the pressure drop per foot. Hmm, I remember that pressure drop in pipes is related to factors like flow rate, viscosity, pipe diameter, and the type of fluid. Since it's a pseudoplastic fluid, which is non-Newtonian, I think the approach might be a bit different from the standard Newtonian cases.

First, let me list out what I know from the problem. The pipe is a schedule 40 standard steel pipe with a diameter of 1 1/4 inches. The flow rate is 15 gallons per hour. The fluid has a density of 60 lbm/ft³ and a viscosity (mu_ap) of 22500 poise. Wait, poise is a unit of dynamic viscosity. Oh right, 1 poise equals 1 dyne·s/cm², and in the CGS system, 1 Pa·s is 10 poise. But I'm not sure about the units here—maybe I need to convert them to something else.

Wait, what's the formula for pressure drop in non-Newtonian fluids? I remember that for Newtonian fluids, it's the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, but for non-Newtonian, like pseudoplastic, it's different. Oh right, pseudoplastic fluids have a viscosity that decreases with increasing shear rate. So their behavior can be described using the power-law model. The power-law model says that the apparent viscosity mu is equal to k * (shear rate)^n, where k is the consistency index and n is the power-law index. But wait, in this problem, they've given me the apparent viscosity mu_ap as 22500 poise. Maybe I can use that directly?

Wait, but wait a second. Hmm, in the power-law model, the shear stress is related to the shear rate. But I'm not sure if I can directly apply that here. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the fluid is pseudoplastic and non-Newtonian, perhaps I should use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation modified for non-Newtonian fluids. Or maybe the Fanning equation?

Wait, the Fanning equation relates pressure drop to friction factor, which depends on Reynolds number. But for non-Newtonian fluids, the Reynolds number calculation is different because the viscosity isn't constant. Oh, right! For non-Newtonian fluids, the generalized Reynolds number is used, which incorporates the flow behavior index and the consistency index.

Wait, but in this problem, mu_ap is given as 22500 poise, which is a measure of apparent viscosity. So maybe I can treat it as a constant for this problem, even though it's a pseudoplastic fluid. Because the problem provides mu_ap, perhaps they want me to proceed as if it's a Newtonian fluid with that viscosity. That would make the calculation easier.

Wait, but wait. The problem statement says it's a pseudoplastic fluid, so the viscosity isn't constant. But the given mu_ap is probably the apparent viscosity at a certain shear rate. Maybe I should proceed with the steps for a Newtonian fluid, using this mu_ap value.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the velocity of the fluid in the pipe.
2. Determine the Reynolds number using the apparent viscosity.
3. Find the friction factor.
4. Use the pressure drop formula involving friction factor, velocity, density, and pipe diameter.

Wait, but for non-Newtonian fluids, the friction factor calculation is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to treat it as a Newtonian fluid with the given mu_ap.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the volumetric flow rate. The given flow rate is 15 gallons per hour. I need to convert that into cubic feet per second or something else that's in consistent units.

Wait, let me think about units. Since the density is given in lbm/ft³ and the viscosity in poise, I might need to convert everything into consistent units, like feet, seconds, pounds, etc.

Wait, 1 gallon is approximately 0.133681 cubic feet. So 15 gal/hr is 15 * 0.133681 ft³ per hour. Let me calculate that.

15 * 0.133681 ≈ 2.00522 ft³/hr. Now, to convert that to ft³/s, divide by 3600 seconds per hour.

2.00522 / 3600 ≈ 0.000557 ft³/s.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert gallons per minute to something else. Or maybe find the flow rate in ft³/s. Alternatively, maybe I should first find the velocity.

Wait, the pipe diameter is 1 1/4 inches, which is 1.25 inches. Let me convert that to feet: 1.25 inches = 1.25/12 = 0.104166667 feet.

The cross-sectional area A of the pipe is π*(d/2)^2. So A = π*(0.104166667/2)^2 ≈ π*(0.052083333)^2 ≈ π * 0.0027117 ≈ 0.008539 ft².

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate that. Oh wait, 0.052083333 feet is the radius. Squared is (0.05208333)^2 = 0.00271172 ft². Multiply by π gives approximately 0.008539 ft².

Now, the volumetric flow rate Q is 15 gal/hr. Let me convert that to ft³/s.

1 gallon = 0.133681 ft³. So 15 gal = 15 * 0.133681 = 2.005215 ft³.

Then, flow rate Q is 2.005215 ft³ per hour. So per second: 2.005215 / 3600 ≈ 0.000557 ft³/s.

So velocity v is Q/A = 0.000557 / 0.008539 ≈ approximately 0.0652 ft/s.

Wait, let me do the exact calculation: 0.000557 / 0.008539.

0.000557 / 0.008539 ≈ 0.0652 ft/s. Hmm.

Now, next step: calculate the Reynolds number.

Wait, for a Newtonian fluid, Re = (rho * v * D) / mu.

But here, mu is given as 22500 poise. Wait, 1 poise is 0.001 Pa·s (since 1 Pa = 1 N/m² = 10^6 dyne/cm², and 1 Pa·s = 10 poise). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the units straight.

Wait, dynamic viscosity mu in CGS units is poise = dyne·s/cm². To convert to lb·s/ft², since we're working in the English system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert mu_ap to lb·s/ft².

Wait, 1 poise = 0.00208854 lb·s/ft².

So 22500 poise * 0.00208854 lb·s/ft² per poise.

Let me calculate that: 22500 * 0.00208854 ≈ 22500 * 0.00208854.

Well, 22500 * 0.002 is 45. 22500 * 0.00008854 is approximately 22500 * 0.00009 = 2.025. So total is approximately 45 + 2.025 = 47.025 lb·s/ft².

Wait, that seems high, but perhaps that's correct.

So mu = 47.025 lb·s/ft².

Now, rho is given as 60 lbm/ft³.

Diameter D is 0.10416667 ft.

Velocity v is approximately 0.0652 ft/s.

So Re = (rho * v * D) / mu.

Plugging in the numbers:

Re = (60 lbm/ft³ * 0.0652 ft/s * 0.10416667 ft) / (47.025 lb·s/ft²).

Wait, let's compute the numerator first: 60 * 0.0652 * 0.10416667.

60 * 0.0652 = 3.912.

3.912 * 0.10416667 ≈ 0.4075.

Denominator is 47.025.

So Re ≈ 0.4075 / 47.025 ≈ 0.00867.

Wait, that's a very low Reynolds number, which makes sense because the viscosity is high. So the flow is laminar, since Re is much less than 2000.

In laminar flow, the friction factor f is 16/Re for Newtonian fluids. But wait, this is a pseudoplastic fluid, so maybe the friction factor is different. But since we're treating mu_ap as the viscosity, perhaps using the Newtonian approach is acceptable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Newtonian formula with the given mu_ap. So I'll proceed with that.

So f = 16/Re = 16 / 0.00867 ≈ 1843.7.

Wait, but that seems extremely high. Wait, Re is 0.00867, so 16/Re is about 1843.7. That can't be right because friction factors are usually much lower. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the Re calculation.

Re = (rho * v * D) / mu.

rho = 60 lbm/ft³.

v = 0.0652 ft/s.

D = 0.10416667 ft.

mu = 47.025 lb·s/ft².

So numerator: 60 * 0.0652 * 0.10416667.

Let me compute it step by step.

60 * 0.0652 = 3.912.

3.912 * 0.10416667 = ?

0.10416667 is 5/48, approximately 0.10416667.

3.912 * 0.10416667 ≈ 3.912 * 0.1 is 0.3912, 3.912 * 0.00416667 is about 0.0163. So total ≈ 0.4075.

Denominator: 47.025.

So Re ≈ 0.4075 / 47.025 ≈ 0.00867, which I think is correct.

So f = 16/0.00867 ≈ 1843.7.

Wait, that's a huge friction factor. But in laminar flow, the friction factor is indeed higher, but in this case, the Re is very low, leading to a high f. Hmm.

Now, the pressure drop per foot can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

ΔP = (f * rho * v² * L) / (2 * D)

Where L is the length over which the pressure drop occurs, which is 1 foot.

So plugging in the values:

ΔP = (1843.7 * 60 lbm/ft³ * (0.0652 ft/s)^2 * 1 ft) / (2 * 0.10416667 ft)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute v squared: (0.0652)^2 ≈ 0.004252 ft²/s².

Then, rho * v² = 60 * 0.004252 ≈ 0.25512 lbm/(ft²·s²).

Wait, but units: lbm is mass unit, and pressure is in force per area, so I need to convert lbm to force, perhaps using lb force as the unit.

Wait, perhaps I should convert lbm to lbf using the conversion factor 1 lbm = 1 lb f / g_c, where g_c is the gravitational conversion factor, 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the unit conversion more carefully.

Wait, let me think about the units in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The pressure drop ΔP should be in lb/ft² (since 1 psi = 1 lb/in², but perhaps we're working in lb/ft² here and then converting to psi).

Wait, the units in the equation: (f is dimensionless) * rho (lbm/ft³) * v² (ft²/s²) * L (ft) divided by D (ft).

So numerator units: (lbm/ft³) * (ft²/s²) * ft = lbm/(ft·s²).

Denominator units: ft.

So overall, (lbm/(ft·s²)) / ft) = lbm/(ft²·s²).

But pressure is in lb force per area. To convert lbm to lb force, we need to multiply by g_c, the gravitational conversion factor. Because weight (force) w = m * g = (lbm) * g_c (lb f / lbm).

Wait, perhaps I should include g_c in the equation. So the correct form might involve (rho * g_c) instead of rho.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not including g_c. Let me recall the correct form of the Darcy equation.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is:

ΔP = (f * rho * g_c * v² * L) / (2 * D)

Where g_c is 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²).

So with that, the units would work out as:

rho (lbm/ft³) * g_c (lbm·ft/(lbf·s²)) * v² (ft²/s²) * L (ft) / D (ft) = (lbm/ft³) * (lbm·ft/(lbf·s²)) * (ft²/s²) * ft * (1/ft) )

Simplify numerator:

lbm * lbm * ft * ft² * ft / (ft³ * lbf * s² * s²) ) → Not sure, perhaps a better approach is to just proceed with the calculation including g_c and see.

So, let's include g_c.

So, g_c = 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²).

So, ΔP = (f * rho * g_c * v² * L) / (2 * D)

Plugging in the numbers:

f ≈ 1843.7

rho = 60 lbm/ft³

g_c = 32.174

v = 0.0652 ft/s

L = 1 ft

D = 0.10416667 ft

So, compute each part:

First, f * rho = 1843.7 * 60 ≈ 110,622.

Multiply by g_c: 110,622 * 32.174 ≈ Let's see, 100,000 * 32.174 = 3,217,400. 10,622 * 32.174 ≈ 341,  342,000. So total ≈ 3,217,400 + 342,000 ≈ 3,559,400.

Wait, more accurately:

110,622 * 32.174 ≈ Let me compute 110,622 * 30 = 3,318,660; 110,622 * 2.174 ≈ 110,622 * 2 = 221,244; 110,622 * 0.174 ≈ 19,248. So total ≈ 3,318,660 + 221,244 = 3,539,904 + 19,248 = 3,559,152.

Then multiply by v squared: v^2 = 0.004252.

So, 3,559,152 * 0.004252 ≈ Let's approximate: 3,559,152 * 0.004 = 14,236.608; 3,559,152 * 0.000252 ≈ 896. So total ≈ 14,236.608 + 896 ≈ 15,132.608.

Then multiply by L (1 ft): 15,132.608.

Divide by (2 * D) = 2 * 0.10416667 ≈ 0.20833334 ft.

So, ΔP ≈ 15,132.608 / 0.20833334 ≈ 72,600 lb/ft².

Wait, that can't be right. 72,600 lb/ft² is way too high. Because 1 psi is 144 lb/ft² (since 1 psi = 1 lb/in², and 1 ft² = 144 in²), so 72,600 lb/ft² is about 504 psi/ft. But looking at the options, the highest is 60.1 psi/ft. So something is wrong here.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back and check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units earlier. Let me re-express the formula correctly. The Darcy-Weisbach equation in consistent units:

ΔP (lb/ft²) = (f * rho (lbm/ft³) * g_c (ft·lbm/(lbf·s²)) * v² (ft²/s²) * L (ft)) / (2 * D (ft))

Wait, perhaps I should handle the units more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to convert all units to SI units, compute, and then convert back.

Let me try that approach.

Convert flow rate Q = 15 gal/hr to m³/s.

1 gallon = 0.00378541 m³. So 15 gal = 15 * 0.00378541 ≈ 0.05678215 m³.

Then, Q = 0.05678215 m³/hr. To convert to m³/s: 0.05678215 / 3600 ≈ 1.5778e-5 m³/s.

Diameter D = 1.25 inches. 1 inch is 0.0254 m, so D = 0.03175 m.

Area A = π*(D/2)^2 = π*(0.015875 m)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.000252 m² ≈ 0.000792 m².

Velocity v = Q/A = 1.5778e-5 m³/s / 0.000792 m² ≈ 0.0199 m/s.

Now, convert viscosity mu_ap from poise to Pa·s.

1 poise = 0.1 Pa·s. So 22500 poise = 2250 Pa·s.

Density rho = 60 lbm/ft³. Convert to kg/m³.

1 lbm = 0.453592 kg. 1 ft³ = 0.0283168 m³.

So rho = 60 lbm/ft³ = 60 * 0.453592 kg / 0.0283168 m³ ≈ (27.215
