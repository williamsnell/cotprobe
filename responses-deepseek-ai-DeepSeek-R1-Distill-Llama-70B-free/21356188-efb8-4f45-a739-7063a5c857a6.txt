Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic waves. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says an electromagnetic wave of 40 KHz is radiated by an antenna, and I need to find the time it takes to reach a point 60 km away. The options are from A to J, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, first, I remember that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, right? Oh wait, but sometimes in different materials they slow down, but the question doesn't specify any medium other than vacuum. So I think I can assume the speed is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second.

The frequency given is 40 KHz. KiloHertz is thousands, so that's 40,000 Hz. But wait, do I even need the frequency for this problem? Because the question is about the time it takes to reach a certain distance. So maybe the frequency isn't directly relevant here since the speed of the wave is what determines the time. Oh wait, unless the question is trying to trick me into thinking about wavelength or something else. But no, I think the key is just using distance equals speed multiplied by time, so time is distance divided by speed.

The distance is 60 km. Oh wait, I need to convert that to meters because the speed of light is in meters per second. So 60 km is 60,000 meters. Got it.

So the formula should be time = distance / speed. Plugging in the numbers, that's 60,000 meters divided by 3 x 10^8 meters per second.

Let me compute that. 60,000 divided by 300,000,000. Hmm, 60,000 is 6e4, and 3e8 is 3 followed by 8 zeros. So 6e4 / 3e8 is (6/3) * (1e4/1e8) )= 2 * 1e-4 = 2e-4 seconds.

Wait, 2e-4 seconds is 0.0002 seconds. To convert that to milliseconds, I multiply by 1000. Because 1 millisecond is 1e-3 seconds. So 0.0002 seconds * 1000 = 0.2 milliseconds. Oh wait, no. Wait, 0.0002 seconds is 0.2 milliseconds because 1e-3 is a millisecond. So 0.0002 s = 0.2 ms. So the time taken is 0.2 milliseconds.

Looking at the options: option F is 0.2 msec. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second, why is the frequency given as 40 KHz? Did I miss something? Because in this calculation, the frequency didn't affect the result. Oh, but electromagnetic waves' speed in vacuum doesn't depend on frequency. So yeah, the frequency here is probably a distractor. Unless... Wait, maybe the question is referring to the wavelength or period? Let me think again.

Wait, the period T is 1/frequency. Frequency is 40 kHz, so 4e4 Hz. So T is 1/(4e4) seconds, which is 2.5e-5 seconds. But I don't see how that factors into the time to reach 60 km. Because the time taken is based on the speed, not the period. Unless the question is about how many wave cycles occur in that time, but the question just asks for the time taken to reach the point, so my initial approach is correct.

So I think I was right the first time. The answer is F: 0.2 msec.

To determine the time taken by the electromagnetic wave to reach a point 60 km away, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

The speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is approximately \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). The distance is given as 60 km, which needs to be converted to meters:

\[
60 \, \text{km} = 60,000 \, \text{m}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{60,000}{3 \times 10^8} = 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{seconds}.
\]

To convert this to milliseconds (since \(1 \, \text{ms} = 10^{-3} \, \text{s}\)):

\[
2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s} = 0.2 \, \text{ms}.
\]

Thus, the time taken for the wave to reach the point is \(0.2 \, \text{ms}\). The frequency of \(40 \, \text{kHz}\) does not affect the calculation because the speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is independent of frequency.

The correct answer is:

**F: 0.2 msec**
