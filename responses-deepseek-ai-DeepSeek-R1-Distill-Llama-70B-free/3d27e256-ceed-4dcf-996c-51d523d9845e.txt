Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about sinusoidal oscillators, and I need to figure out which one is not a sinusoidal oscillator. Hmm, I remember that sinusoidal oscillators produce a sine wave output, right? They typically use feedback circuits with LC or RC components, and they maintain a steady amplitude by using some form of loss compensation.

Looking at the options:

A: Hartley oscillator. I think Hartley uses an LC circuit. It's a type of LC oscillator, so it should be sinusoidal.

B: Colpitts oscillator. Yeah, that's another LC oscillator. Definitely sinusoidal.

C: Clapp oscillator. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. Wait, Clapp is similar to Colpitts but uses a different configuration. Still LC-based, so sinusoidal.

D: Quartz crystal oscillator. Crystal oscillators use a quartz crystal which has a very precise resonant frequency. They're LC-type too, so their output is a sine wave.

E: LC oscillator. Well, that's the category all the above fall into. Sinusoidal for sure.

F: Crystal oscillator. Same as D, I think. Uses a crystal, so it's sinusoidal.

G: Relaxation oscillator. Hmm, I remember that relaxation oscillators typically produce a square wave or some sort of pulse output, not a sine wave. They use a charging capacitor and a neon lamp or something similar, leading to a sawtooth or square wave.

H: RC phase shift oscillator. This uses resistors and capacitors. I think it's a type of sinusoidal oscillator because it uses phase shift feedback to sustain oscillations, producing a sine wave.

I: Wien bridge oscillator. Wien bridge uses an RC network. I recall that it's a common sinusoidal oscillator, especially in audio ranges. So that's sinusoidal.

J: Armstrong oscillator. Armstrong is another LC oscillator type. It uses a tickler coil, so it's definitely sinusoidal.

So the question is asking which is NOT a sinusoidal oscillator. Based on this, the Relaxation oscillator (G) is the odd one out because it produces non-sinusoidal waves like square waves or sawtooth waves.

The question asks which of the listed options is not a sinusoidal oscillator. Sinusoidal oscillators produce a sine wave output and typically use LC or RC circuits with feedback to sustain oscillations. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **A: Hartley oscillator**: Uses an LC circuit and produces a sine wave. It is a sinusoidal oscillator.  
- **B: Colpitts oscillator**: Another LC oscillator that produces a sine wave. It is sinusoidal.  
- **C: Clapp oscillator**: A variant of the Colpitts oscillator, also LC-based and sinusoidal.  
- **D: Quartz crystal oscillator**: Uses a quartz crystal for precise resonant frequency and produces a sine wave. It is sinusoidal.  
- **E: LC oscillator**: A general category that includes Hartley, Colpitts, and Clapp oscillators. All are sinusoidal.  
- **F: Crystal oscillator**: Similar to D, it uses a crystal and produces a sine wave. It is sinusoidal.  
- **G: Relaxation oscillator**: Typically produces square waves or sawtooth waves, not sine waves. It is not a sinusoidal oscillator.  
- **H: RC phase shift oscillator**: Uses resistors and capacitors with phase shift feedback to produce a sine wave. It is sinusoidal.  
- **I: Wien bridge oscillator**: Uses an RC network and is known for producing sine waves. It is sinusoidal.  
- **J: Armstrong oscillator**: An LC oscillator that uses a tickler coil and produces a sine wave. It is sinusoidal.  

The only option that does not produce a sine wave is the **Relaxation oscillator (G)**, as it generates non-sinusoidal waveforms like square waves or sawtooth waves.

Answer: **G**
