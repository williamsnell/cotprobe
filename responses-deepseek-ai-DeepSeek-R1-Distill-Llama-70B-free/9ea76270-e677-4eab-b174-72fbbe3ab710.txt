Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about treaty reservations, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. I remember that in international law, treaties can have reservations made by states, but sometimes these reservations aren't valid. The question is asking when a reservation is considered invalid.

The options are A through D. Let me think about each one.

Option A says a reservation is invalid if the majority of state parties object. I'm not sure about that. I think the process is more about whether the reservation is against the treaty's object and purpose. Like, each state can object, but the reservation is still valid unless a certain number object. Wait, but I don't think it's a majority thing. Maybe it's that if a state objects, the reservation doesn't apply between those two states, but the reservation itself isn't invalid unless it's against the object and purpose.

Option B states it's invalid only when an international tribunal decides so. Hmm, I don't think that's right because reservations can be invalidated based on their content without needing a tribunal. Tribunals might make rulings, but the invalidity is determined by the treaty law itself, not just by a tribunal's decision.

Option C says it's invalid only when incompatible with jus cogens. Jus cogens are peremptory norms that can't be derogated from. But I remember that the general rule for reservations is about the object and purpose, not specifically jus cogens. So maybe C is too narrow. It's one of the factors, but not the only one?

Option D claims a reservation is invalid when incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. That rings a bell. I think the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) has provisions about this. Yes, Article 19 or something around there. It says that a state can make a reservation unless it's incompatible with the object and purpose. So a reservation is invalid if it goes against that.

Wait, but what about the other options. Let me double-check. So the key is the object and purpose. So the correct answer should be D.

Option C is about jus cogens. While jus cogens is important, a reservation being against jus cogens would make the treaty itself invalid, or certain provisions, but maybe not the reservation. Or does it? Wait, no, a state can't make a reservation that's against jus cogens because that's a higher level. But the primary test for a reservation's validity is the object and purpose, not jus cogens. So perhaps C is incorrect because it's not the only or even the main reason.

So putting it all together, the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D. A reservation is invalid when it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. This is based on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which establishes that a reservation must align with the treaty's fundamental objectives.

Answer: D
