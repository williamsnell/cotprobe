Question:

Following their law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were driving home in an automobile that was owned and operated by the graduate. As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. "The complaint is

Options:

A: admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.
B: inadmissible, because it is considered hearsay.
C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
D: admissible, because the graduate consented to its use.
E: inadmissible, because the roommate is not a party to the lawsuit.
F: inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.
G: admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.
H: admissible as a statement of fact.
I: admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
J: admissible as an admission.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about evidence law, specifically hearsay exceptions and admissibility. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

First, let me recap the scenario. After a law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were in a car accident with a motorcycle. The rider sued the graduate for speeding. The roommate sued the rider for negligence and running a red light. Then, the roommate settled with the graduate and dismissed his lawsuit. At the trial against the rider, the roommate testified that the rider drove through a red light and swerved into their path. Now, the rider wants to introduce the roommate's complaint against the graduate, which alleges the graduate was speeding.

The question is whether that complaint is admissible, and the options are from A to J.

So, the issue here is whether the complaint is hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any exception or is admissible under another rule.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The roommate's complaint says the graduate was speeding. The rider is offering this to show that the graduate was indeed speeding, which would support the rider's case that the graduate was at least partially at fault.

Wait, but the roommate testified that the rider ran a red light. So, the rider wants to contradict that by showing that the roommate previously alleged the graduate was speeding, implying that the graduate might have been at fault. But is the complaint admissible?

The roommate is now a witness testifying against the rider, so the rider is trying to impeach the roommate's credibility by showing a prior inconsistent statement. But wait, is the complaint considered a prior inconsistent statement?

Prior inconsistent statements are admissible if they were made under oath and subject to cross-examination. But wait, here, the complaint was part of a lawsuit that was settled and dismissed. Does that affect its admissibility?

Alternatively, the complaint could be an admission by a party-opponent. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), admissions by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay. Specifically, FRE 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or someone else on behalf of the party.

Wait, but the roommate was the plaintiff in his own lawsuit against the graduate. So, the complaint is the roommate's own statement made in a legal proceeding. Now, the rider is trying to use that against the roommate in this trial.

Wait, the roommate is now a witness for the defense (the graduate), I think. Or wait, no—the trial is between the rider and the roommate. Wait no, the initial setup was that the rider sued the graduate, and the roommate sued the rider. Then, the roommate settled with the graduate and dismissed his suit against the rider. Now, the rider is on trial, and the roommate is testifying against him.

So, in the trial, the rider is the plaintiff, and the roommate is a defendant? Or wait, no, the rider is suing the graduate, and the roommate is a witness.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the parties:

- The motorcycle rider sued the graduate (driver) for speeding, causing the accident.

- The roommate sued the rider for negligence (riding through a red light).

Then, the roommate settled with the graduate and dismissed his lawsuit against the rider. So, the roommate is no longer suing the rider, but the rider's case against the graduate is ongoing.

At the trial (probably the rider's case against the graduate), the roommate testifies against the rider, saying the rider was at fault (ran a red light). The rider then wants to introduce the roommate's prior complaint against the graduate, which alleged that the graduate was speeding.

So, the roommate was a plaintiff in a case against the graduate, making that complaint. Now, the rider (as plaintiff) is trying to use that complaint to show that the graduate was at fault, contradicting the roommate's testimony.

The roommate's complaint is a statement by the roommate, but it's being offered against him now. Wait, no—the rider is the plaintiff, and the roommate's statement is against the graduate, but here, the rider is trying to use it against the graduate, perhaps? Or wait, no, in this trial, the issue is the rider's case against the graduate.

Wait, the rider is suing the graduate for speeding. The graduate's defense is that the rider was at fault (ran a red light). The roommate, as a witness for the graduate, testifies that the rider ran the red light. Now, the rider wants to rebut that by showing that previously, the roommate alleged the graduate was speeding, which would suggest the graduate was also at fault.

So, the roommate's complaint is being offered by the rider (the plaintiff) to show that the graduate was speeding, which would mean the roommate is inconsistent in his claims—first blaming the graduate, then blaming the rider.

So, is this statement admissible?

Now, considering hearsay. The complaint is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth (that the graduate was speeding). So, it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Possible exceptions: prior inconsistent statement, admission by a party-opponent, or declaration against interest.

Let's think about prior inconsistent statement. Under FRE 801(d)(1)(A), a prior inconsistent statement can be used as substantive evidence if it was given under oath and subject to cross-examination. The complaint was certainly made under oath (as legal pleadings are verified or under penalty of perjury, I think). But was it subject to cross-examination? In a deposition or prior testimony, yes. But a complaint is a pleading, not testimony. So, maybe it doesn't qualify under 801(d)(1)(A). So, it might not be admissible as a prior inconsistent statement under that rule.

Alternatively, could it be an admission by a party-opponent? Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or someone else on behalf of the party. Wait, but the roommate is not a party to this case. The current case is between the rider and the graduate. The roommate was a party in a different case against the graduate. So, the roommate is a non-party witness here. Therefore, his statements wouldn't qualify as admissions by a party-opponent in this case. Because the roommate isn't a party here.

Another angle: The roommate's complaint is a statement by him, and he's now testifying. The rider could try to impeach him with his prior inconsistent statement. But under FRE 613, prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach, but they don't become substantive evidence unless they meet the criteria under FRE 801(d)(1). Since the complaint wasn't made under oath in a proceeding, it might not qualify, so it can only be used for impeachment, not as substantive evidence.

But wait, the question is about admissibility, not whether it's substantive or just for impeachment. The rider is offering the complaint as evidence that the graduate was speeding, so they want it for the truth. So, if it's hearsay, and no exception applies, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but another possibility: the complaint could be an admission by the roommate as a statement against interest. Wait, no—the declaration against interest exception applies when the declarant's statement is against their own interest at the time it was made. Here, the roommate's statement in the complaint was part of suing the graduate, so it's in his interest to say the graduate was speeding. So, not a statement against his interest. So, that exception doesn't apply.

Alternatively, the business records exception? No, because the complaint is a legal document prepared in anticipation of litigation, so it's not a business record.

Another option is that it's an admission under FRE 801(d)(2). But as I thought earlier, the roommate isn't a party here, so his statements aren't admissions by a party-opponent in this case.

Wait, but could the graduate's own statements be an admission? No, because the complaint is the roommate's statement, not the graduate's.

So, if the complaint is hearsay and doesn't fall under any exception, it's inadmissible. So, the answer would be B: inadmissible because it's hearsay.

But wait, let me think again. Option J says it's admissible as an admission. But as per the earlier analysis, since the roommate isn't a party here, his statement isn't an admission against himself in this case. Unless the roommate is a party, but he's not. He's a witness, so his prior statements would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Option I says "admissible as a prior inconsistent statement." But prior inconsistent statements are only admissible as substantive evidence if they were made under oath at a prior proceeding. A complaint is a pleading, not testimony, so it's not under oath in a proceeding. Therefore, it doesn't meet the requirements for 801(d)(1)(A), so it can't be admitted as a prior inconsistent statement for the truth, only for impeachment purposes, which wouldn't help the rider.

Option J says it's admissible as an admission. But again, the roommate isn't a party here, so his statements aren't admissions by a party-opponent. Unless the roommate is considered the party's agent, which he isn't.

Wait, could the roommate's statement in the complaint be considered an admission against the graduate? Because the complaint was against the graduate. But in this trial, the graduate is the defendant, and the rider is the plaintiff. So, if the roommate's statement is offered against the graduate, and the graduate is a party, then under 801(d)(2)(A), it could be admissible as the graduate's own statement. Wait, no—the complaint is the roommate's statement, not the graduate's. So, that doesn't apply.

Wait, perhaps the graduate adopted the roommate's statement? That seems unlikely. The graduate was the defendant in the roommate's lawsuit, so the graduate wouldn't have adopted the allegations; instead, he would have denied them.

Hmm. So, perhaps the complaint is inadmissible because it's hearsay, and none of the exceptions apply. So, the answer would be B.

Wait, but another point: settlements. Option F says inadmissible because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise. Under FRE 408, evidence of a compromise is inadmissible to prove liability, but it can be admitted for other purposes, like impeachment. But here, the rider is trying to use the complaint's allegation, not the fact of the settlement, so I don't think 408 applies here.

So, the complaint is hearsay, no exception applies, so it's inadmissible. So, the answer is B.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of the roommate's complaint, which alleges that the graduate was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed" at the time of the accident. The rider seeks to introduce this complaint to rebut the roommate's testimony that the rider ran a red light. The issue is whether the complaint is admissible under the rules of evidence.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Hearsay Definition**: The complaint is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the graduate was speeding). Therefore, it is hearsay unless an exception applies.

2. **Prior Inconsistent Statement (Option I)**: Under FRE 801(d)(1)(A), a prior inconsistent statement is admissible as substantive evidence only if it was made under oath and subject to cross-examination. While the complaint was made under oath, it is a legal pleading, not testimony from a prior proceeding. Thus, it does not qualify as a prior inconsistent statement under this rule.

3. **Admission by a Party-Opponent (Option J)**: Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and was made by the party or their representative. However, the roommate is not a party to the current lawsuit (the case is between the rider and the graduate), so his statement in the complaint does not qualify as an admission by a party-opponent.

4. **Declaration Against Interest (Option C)**: This exception applies when a statement is against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. Here, the roommate's allegation in the complaint was made to support his own lawsuit against the graduate and was in his interest, not against it. Thus, this exception does not apply.

5. **Business Records Exception (Option G)**: The complaint is a legal document prepared in anticipation of litigation, not a business record. Therefore, this exception does not apply.

6. **Settlement as Compromise (Option F)**: Under FRE 408, evidence of a compromise is inadmissible to prove liability. However, the rider is seeking to admit the complaint itself, not the fact of the settlement, so this rule does not apply.

7. **Impeachment (Option I)**: While the complaint could theoretically be used to impeach the roommate's credibility by showing a prior inconsistent statement, it cannot be admitted for the truth of the matter asserted unless it meets the criteria for a hearsay exception, which it does not.

### Conclusion:
The complaint is hearsay, and none of the exceptions to the hearsay rule apply. Therefore, it is inadmissible.
