Question:

A drama guild is renovating an old theater, hoping to use it for 15 years. The guild can follow one of two plans to finance the work: Plan A is to use $5,000 collected from guild members to pay for a renovation job which would be done immediately and would last 15 years. Plan B is to borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens, and then in the 5th and 10th years of the theater's life to renovate it; each job will last five years. Interest is 6% for both plans. (a) Which plan should the guild follow? (b) If, in Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovation jobs will cost $3,000 each and the guild will not be able to borrow the money for any of the three jobs (i.e., the members will have to contribute), which plan should the guild follow?

Options:

A: Plan A, with the $5,000 invested first to grow at 6% interest before renovating
B: Plan B, with renovations every 7 years and borrowing at a lower interest rate
C: Plan A
D: Plan B, with the guild members contributing an additional $1,000 upfront for future renovations
E: Plan A, but with an additional loan taken out in the 10th year
F: Plan A, with a smaller renovation every 5 years using money from fundraising events
G: Plan B
H: Both plans
I: Plan B, with additional renovations every 3 years financed by ticket sales
J: Neither plans

Okay, so I've got this drama guild question to tackle. Hmm, let's see. They're renovating an old theater and have two financing plans to choose from. They want to use the theater for 15 years, so I guess the renovations need to last that long or be done in phases.

Plan A is to use $5,000 collected from members right away for a renovation that lasts 15 years. So that's a one-time upfront payment. Plan B is a bit more complex. They borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens. Then, in the 5th and 10th years, they renovate again, each time for five years. So Plan B has three renovations: one before opening, and then at 5 and 10 years. Each renovation lasts five years, which would cover the entire 15 years if they're done every five years. But wait, the first renovation is before opening, so maybe after the first year. Hmm, I need to think about the timing.

The interest rate is 6% for both plans. I think I need to compare the present value or maybe the future value of both plans to see which is cheaper or more cost-effective.

Let's start with part (a). The question is which plan the guild should follow. So we're comparing the total cost of Plan A versus Plan B in terms of their financial impact over 15 years.

For Plan A, it's simple: they spend $5,000 now. But maybe they could have invested that money elsewhere, so the opportunity cost is considered using the interest rate. Alternatively, for Plan B, they're borrowing $2,000 at different times. Wait, no, Plan B says they borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens, and then in the 5th and 10th years, they renovate. So, three renovations: year -1 (before opening), year 5, and year 10. Each costs $2,000 borrowed. But wait, the question says in Plan B, each job will last five years. So each renovation is done every five years.

Wait, the initial Plan B plan says they borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens (so year 0, if the theater opens at year 1?), then in 5th and 10th years. So three renovations: at time 0 (year before opening), time 5, and time 10. Each costing $2,000.

But the problem is that the guild is considering two plans. Plan A is a single payment of $5,000 now (or at time 0), and Plan B is three payments of $2,000 at times 0,5,10.

Wait, but the question states that in Plan B, the guild will borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens. So that's at time -1, right? Because the theater is opening in year 0. Then, the first renovation is before opening, so at year -1. Then at year 5 and year 10. So the three costs are at year -1, 5, and 10.

But the time frame is 15 years, so the theater is used for 15 years starting from year 0, with renovations done at -1,5,10.

Wait, but the problem says the guild wants to use the theater for 15 years. So the renovations' timing must cover that period. So Plan A does a renovation at time 0 that lasts 15 years. Plan B does renovations at time -1 (so the work is done before opening, which would last until year 4), then another at year 5 (lasting until 9), and another at year 10 (lasting until 14), but wait, that leaves from year 14 to 15 uncovered. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Or maybe each renovation lasts five years, so the first (at -1) ends at year 3 (since -1 +5 =4?), wait, no, perhaps the timing is such that the renovation starts immediately. So maybe each renovation done at a certain year lasts until five years after that. So if done at year -1, it's good until year 4 (since -1 +5=4). Then the next at year 5 lasts until 10, and the third at 10 lasts until 15. Oh, that makes sense. So the three renovations cover the entire 15 years without gaps. So the planning is correct.

Now, for the cost comparison. The guild is considering which plan is better financially. Since both involve spending money at different times, we probably need to calculate the present value of each plan's costs and see which is lower. Alternatively, we can calculate the future value at the end of 15 years, but present value is more common for comparing investments.

So for Plan A: They spend $5,000 at time 0. The present value (PV) is just $5,000 because it's at the present time.

For Plan B: They have three expenditures. The first is $2,000 at time -1. The second at time 5, and the third at time 10. But wait, in terms of present value at time 0, how do we calculate each?

Wait, the present value would be calculated as of time 0. So the expenditure at time -1 (which is one year before time 0) would have its PV calculated as of time 0. So we can think of each payment as occurring at different times relative to the present (time 0).

So for each payment in Plan B:

1. $2,000 at time -1. To find its PV at time 0: since it's one year before, we can calculate it as 2000 / (1 + i)^1. Since i=6%, that's 2000 /1.06 ≈ 1886.78.

2. $2,000 at time 5. PV at time 0 is 2000 / (1.06)^5. Let me calculate that. 1.06^5 is approximately 1.33822558. So 2000 /1.33822558 ≈ 1494.82.

3. $2,000 at time 10. PV is 2000 / (1.06)^10. 1.06^10 ≈ 1.7908477. So 2000 /1.7908477 ≈ 1116.47.

Adding these up: 1886.78 + 1494.82 + 1116.47 = let's see. 1886.78 + 1494.82 is 3381.6, plus 1116.47 is 4498.07.

So the total present value for Plan B is approximately $4,498.07.

Plan A is $5,000, which is higher than Plan B's $4,498.07. So Plan B is cheaper in terms of present value. So the guild should choose Plan B for part (a).

Wait, but wait, another approach: since the money is borrowed, does that mean the guild is paying interest on the loans? Or are they just considering the present value of the payments they make?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to model it as the guild having to repay the loans. Wait, the question says "borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens". So each time they borrow, they have to pay back the loan with interest over time. Or are they paying for the renovations by borrowing, but the cost is just the principal, and the interest is considered in the analysis?

Wait, the question says the interest is 6% for both plans. So perhaps the cost streams are being discounted at 6%. So yes, the present value approach is correct.

So under Plan A, the PV is $5,000. Plan B's PV is about $4,498. So Plan B is better.

So for part (a), the answer would be Plan B, which is option G, I think. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Plan A, with $5k invested first to grow. Hmm, no, in Plan A, they spend it immediately.

B: Plan B, with renovations every 7 years. No, Plan B is every 5.

C: Plan A.

D: Plan B, with additional $1k upfront.

E: Plan A, with another loan at 10.

F: Plan A, smaller renovations every 5 using fundraising.

G: Plan B.

So for part (a), the answer is Plan B, which is option G.

Now part (b): If in Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovation jobs will cost $3,000 each, and the guild can't borrow the money, so the members have to contribute. So now, in Plan B, the first renovation is at time -1, costing $2,000 (borrowed), but the second and third (at 5 and 10) cost $3,000 each, and the guild can't borrow, so they have to pay from their own funds.

Wait, but the original Plan B was to borrow $2,000 each time. Now, for the 2nd and 3rd jobs, it's $3,000 each, and they can't borrow, so they have to contribute from members. So the payments at 5 and 10 are now $3,000 each, to be paid in cash by the members.

So the present value of Plan B now is:

Time -1: $2,000 (borrowed, so its PV is 2000/(1.06)^1 ≈ 1886.78.

Time 5: $3,000 (paid by members). PV is 3000/(1.06)^5 ≈ 3000/1.3382 ≈ 2241.68.

Time 10: $3,000. PV is 3000/(1.06)^10 ≈ 3000/1.7908 ≈ 1676.48.

Total PV: 1886.78 + 2241.68 + 1676.48 ≈ let's add.

1886.78 + 2241.68 = 4128.46 + 1676.48 = 5804.94.

So Plan B now has a PV of approximately $5,804.94.

Compare that to Plan A's PV of $5,000. So Plan A is cheaper now.

So the guild should now switch to Plan A.

So for part (b), the answer is Plan A, which is option C.

So the options for the answers would be:

(a) Plan B (G), (b) Plan A (C). But wait, the question is structured as two parts in the same question, but the options given are all individual options; each option is a choice for either (a) or (b) or both, but the way the question is presented seems to be a single answer, but the user has to answer both (a) and (b). Wait, no, the question is phrased as a single multiple-choice question. Wait, no—the original question is: part (a) and (b). But the options are for each part. Wait, no, looking at the options, each option (A-J) is a possible answer. The question is phrased as two parts, but the options are single choices. So perhaps the correct approach is to select for each part which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread. The question is a single question with two parts, (a) and (b), and the options are for each part. But the way the user presented it, the options are given as A-J, each being a possible answer. So perhaps the correct approach is to answer each part and then select the option that matches.

Wait, the problem is presented as a single multiple-choice question, but with two parts, (a) and (b). So perhaps each part is a separate question, but the way the user input is structured here, it's a single question, so perhaps I should select the correct options for each part.

Wait, the initial instruction says to "answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J." So it's a single question, but it's part (a) and part (b). Hmm, perhaps the options are for each part, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for each part, and the user is to select both, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps each part is a separate question, but the user only provided one question. Wait, perhaps the original question is from a test where part (a) and (b) are separate, but the user is presenting them together. But given the options, each option is a possible answer, so perhaps each part is a separate multiple-choice question but presented together here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to answer part (a) first, which is to choose between the options, and part (b) separately. But the user's instruction is to reply with the selected letter, implying a single answer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine.

The question has two parts: (a) and (b). Each part requires choosing between the same set of options. But the way the options are presented, each option is a possible answer, perhaps for each part. So perhaps the correct approach is to select the correct option for each part, but in this case, the user expects a single answer, so perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, no. The user is asking for a single question, so perhaps (a) and (b) are parts of the same question, but the answer remains one option. Alternatively, perhaps each part is considered separately, but the user is expecting a single response.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

In part (a), without any changes, Plan B is better because its PV is lower. So the answer is Plan B, which is option G.

In part (b), with the changes in Plan B's costs, Plan A becomes better. So the answer is Plan A, option C.

But the options don't combine answers for both parts; each option is a single choice. So perhaps the question is only asking about part (a) and part (b) as separate questions, but the way the user presented it, it's a single question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer combines both parts, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the initial question is only part (a), but the user included part (b) as an additional scenario. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking both parts, and the correct answer is the option that correctly answers both. But looking at the options, I don't see any that address both parts.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option G is Plan B.

Option C is Plan A.

So if part (a) is G and part (b) is C, but the options are single choices, perhaps the user is to answer both, but the way to present the answer is to select the correct option for each part. But the user's instruction is to reply directly with the letter selected. So perhaps the question is structured as two separate questions, but the user is presenting them as a single one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only part (a), and part (b) is a follow-up. But I'm not certain. Given this confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that part (a) is the main question, and the answer is option G.

Wait, but the user's question includes both (a) and (b), but in the context of the system, perhaps they want both answers, but each as a separate response. However, the initial instruction says to reply with a single letter.

Hmm, perhaps the user is asking for both parts, but each part is a separate question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to choose Plan B for part (a) and Plan A for part (b), but there's no option that combines both. Therefore, perhaps the options are for each part, and the user is to select the correct one for each part separately.

But given the way the options are presented, I think each option refers to a choice for the entire question, which includes both parts. However, that doesn't make sense because the options don't address both parts together.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on part (a) as the main question, and the answer is G. Then, if part (b) is a separate question, the answer would be C. But the user's instruction is to answer the given question, which includes both parts, but I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only part (a), and part (b) is an extra, but the user included both. But I'm not certain.

Given that, perhaps I should proceed to answer part (a) as G and part (b) as C, but the options don't combine these. So perhaps the correct answer is G for part (a) and C for part (b). But since the options are single letters, perhaps the user is to select two letters, but the instruction says to reply with a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the question is only part (a), and part (b) is an additional consideration. But given the information, I think the correct answer for part (a) is G, and for part (b), it's C.

But the options don't have an option that says, for example, "Plan B for (a) and Plan A for (b)". So perhaps the user is to answer each part, but the options are for each part. But since the user's instruction is to reply with a single letter, I think the question is about part (a), so the answer is G.

The drama guild is deciding between two renovation plans for their theater, which they intend to use for 15 years. Plan A involves a one-time upfront payment of $5,000 at time 0, while Plan B involves borrowing $2,000 at times -1, 5, and 10, with each renovation lasting 5 years. The interest rate for both plans is 6%. The guild needs to evaluate which plan is more cost-effective.

### Part (a): Comparing Plan A and Plan B
- **Plan A**: The present value (PV) is $5,000, as the entire amount is spent at time 0.
- **Plan B**: The PV of the payments is calculated as follows:
  1. $2,000 at time -1: \( \frac{2000}{1.06} \approx 1886.78 \)
  2. $2,000 at time 5: \( \frac{2000}{1.06^5} \approx 1494.82 \)
  3. $2,000 at time 10: \( \frac{2000}{1.06^{10}} \approx 1116.47 \)
  Total PV for Plan B: \( 1886.78 + 1494.82 + 1116.47 \approx 4498.07 \).

Since the PV of Plan B ($4,498.07) is lower than that of Plan A ($5,000), Plan B is more cost-effective for part (a).

### Part (b): Adjusted Plan B
In this scenario, the second and third renovations under Plan B cost $3,
