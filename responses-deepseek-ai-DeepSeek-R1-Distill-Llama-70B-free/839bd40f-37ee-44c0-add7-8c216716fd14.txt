Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron orbiting a proton. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question gives me the angular momentum L as 6e-35 N-sec and the total energy H0 as -4e-18 J. I need to find the distance of nearest approach and farthest separation. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the right one.

Alright, I remember that in the Bohr model, the energy levels of an electron in a hydrogen atom are quantized. The total energy H0 is given, which I think is the same as the Hamiltonian, representing the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). Since the energy is negative, the electron is bound to the proton, which makes sense.

Angular momentum plays a key role here. I think the angular momentum L is quantized as well, given by L = n * ħ, where n is an integer. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether that's the case here. Oh wait, wait. No, in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as L = nħ, where n is the principal quantum number. But when the electron is in orbit, it's moving in an elliptical orbit, right? Oh wait, no, in the Bohr model, it's a circular orbit. So maybe that's a simpler approach.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think I can approach this using the concept of an elliptical orbit. Because when an electron has angular momentum, the orbit isn't necessarily circular. The closest and farthest points would be the perihelion and aphelion, so the distances vary between these two points.

I think I should model this using the concept from celestial mechanics but applied to the electron-proton system. So the Coulomb force provides the centripetal force here, similar to gravity in planetary orbits. But since the Coulomb force is stronger, the equations might look similar but with different constants.

The formula for the closest and farthest approach in an orbit can be derived using energy and angular momentum. Let me recall those formulas. I remember that in an orbit under an inverse-square law force (like Coulomb or gravity), the distance of closest approach (r_min) and farthest (r_max) can be found using the vis-viva equation, which relates the specific orbital energy (which is H0 here) and the angular momentum.

Wait, the vis-viva equation is (v²) = μ (2/r - 1/a), where μ is the standard gravitational parameter, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But since this is an electron and proton, the force is electromagnetic, not gravitational, so μ would be different. Alternatively, μ here would be the Coulomb constant multiplied by the product of the charges, but I think I need to adjust the formula correctly.

Wait, let's clarify. The Coulomb force is F = (k_e * e²) / r², where k_e is Coulomb's constant, e is the elementary charge. So for the case of an electron orbiting a proton, the force is given by Coulomb's law.

In orbital mechanics, the effective potential is often used. The effective potential V_eff(r) combines the Coulomb potential and the centrifugal barrier due to angular momentum. The minima and maxima of the orbit (the closest and farthest points) occur where the radial velocity is zero, which means that the kinetic energy in the radial direction is zero. So at these points, all the kinetic energy is in the angular direction.

Wait, maybe another approach. The specific orbital energy (ε) is given by the total mechanical energy, which is H0 here. So ε = H0 = -4e-18 J. Also, the angular momentum L is given as 6e-35 N·s.

In orbital mechanics, for an inverse-square law force, the semi-major axis a is related to the energy and angular momentum. But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The relationship between energy, angular momentum, and the semi-major axis could be derived. Let me recall that for an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis a is given by a = (μ * (1 - e²)) / (2 * |ε|), where e is the eccentricity, and μ is some constant. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact expressions here.

Alternatively, the formula for the semi-latus rectum p is p = (L²) / (μ * m), where m is the mass of the electron. Wait, no, the formula might be p = (h²) / (μ m), but I'm getting mixed up between the different variables.

Wait, perhaps instead of getting lost in the formulas, I should think about the formulas for r_min and r_max. I remember that for an orbit, r_min = a (1 - e) and r_max = a (1 + e), where e is the eccentricity. The semi-major axis a is related to the energy and angular momentum.

Another formula I remember is that the specific angular momentum h is L/m, where L is the angular momentum and m is the mass of the electron. So h = L/(m_e), where m_e is the electron mass.

Wait, yes, specific angular momentum h is defined as h = L / m. So h would be 6e-35 / (9.11e-31 kg) ≈ let me calculate that. 6e-35 / 9.11e-31 = approx 6 / 9.11e4 → around 6.59e-5 m²/s.

But I'm not sure if I'm getting that right. Let me compute it properly: 6e-35 divided by 9.11e-31. 6e-35 / 9.11e-31 = (6 / 9.11) * 1e-4. 6/9.11 is approximately 0.659, so h ≈ 0.659e-4 → 6.59e-5 m²/s.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I need h here. Let me think about the energy and angular momentum relations.

The total mechanical energy (H0) is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. For an inverse-square law force, the potential energy U(r) is proportional to -1/r. So U(r) = -k_e * e² / r, where k_e is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Wait, but in the case of the hydrogen atom, the potential energy is U(r) = - (k_e e²)/r. The kinetic energy K is (1/2) m_e v². The total energy H0 is K + U.

But when the electron is at the distance of closest approach (r_min) and farthest (r_max), the radial velocity is zero. So all the kinetic energy is in the angular component.

Wait, that's a key point. At r_min and r_max, the radial velocity is zero, so the velocity is entirely tangential. So at those points, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m_e (v_θ)^2, where v_θ is the tangential velocity.

The angular momentum L is m_e r v_θ. So v_θ = L/(m_e r). Substituting into the kinetic energy, K = (1/2) m_e (L²)/(m_e² r²) ) = L²/(2 m_e r²).

Wait, but L is given, so K at r_min would be L²/(2 m_e r_min²).

At the same time, the potential energy at r_min is U = -k_e e² / r_min.

So the total energy H0 is K + U, which at r_min (and similarly at r_max) would be:

H0 = [L²/(2 m_e r²)] - (k_e e²)/r.

But wait, when the electron is at r_min or r_max, it's at a turning point. So the mechanical energy equals the effective potential there. The effective potential V_eff(r) is the sum of the Coulomb potential and the centrifugal potential, which is (L²)/(2 m_e r²).

So, V_eff(r) = - (k_e e²)/r + (L²)/(2 m_e r²).

At the turning points, the kinetic energy is entirely in the angular direction, so the total energy equals V_eff(r). Therefore, H0 = V_eff(r) at r_min and r_max.

So, H0 = - (k_e e²)/r + (L²)/(2 m_e r²).

Let me write this equation:

H0 = (-k_e e²)/r + (L²)/(2 m_e r²).

We can rearrange this equation to find r. Let's multiply both sides by r²:

H0 r² = -k_e e² r + (L²)/(2 m_e).

Bring all terms to one side:

H0 r² + k_e e² r - (L²)/(2 m_e) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of r. Let me write it as:

H0 r² + (k_e e²) r - (L²)/(2 m_e) = 0.

Wait, no, the quadratic is in r, so the standard form is a r² + b r + c = 0. Let me identify a, b, c.

a = H0

b = k_e e²

c = - L²/(2 m_e)

Wait, no, let's see:

H0 r² + k_e e² r - (L²)/(2 m_e) = 0.

So a = H0, b = k_e e², c = - L²/(2 m_e).

Wait, but H0 is negative. So when I solve this quadratic equation, I can find the two roots, which correspond to r_min and r_max.

Wait, but quadratic equations have two roots, so the two solutions for r would be the two turning points, i.e., the nearest and farthest distances.

So applying the quadratic formula:

r = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4 a c) ] / (2 a).

Wait, but in this equation, a is H0, which is negative, and b is positive because it's k_e e².

Wait, let's plug in the values.

First, compute all the constants:

k_e = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg

H0 = -4e-18 J

L = 6e-35 N·s

So, let's compute each term:

a = H0 = -4e-18 J

b = k_e e² = 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute e² first: (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C². Then 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38 = approx 23.06 * 1e-29 = 2.306e-28 N·m²/C * C² → N·m².

Wait, but units: k_e e² has units of (N m²/C²) * C² → N m², which is J·m. Hmm, but in our equation, the units should be okay, as we're going to have meters in the end.

Wait, perhaps better to calculate numerically.

Compute b = k_e * e^2:

k_e = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C²

So, b = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute:

8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.06. So 23.06e9 * 1e-38 = 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28 N·m².

So, b = 2.306e-28 N·m².

Now, c = - L²/(2 m_e )

Compute L²: (6e-35)^2 = 36e-70 (N²·s²)

Divide by 2 m_e: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg = 1.8218e-30 kg.

So, L²/(2 m_e ) = 36e-70 / 1.8218e-30 = (36 / 1.8218) * 1e-40 → approx 19.76 * 1e-40 = 1.976e-39 N·s²/kg * m²? Wait, units might not matter here as I'm just computing the numerical value.

So, c = - (6e-35)^2 / (2 * 9.109e-31) → let me compute that.

Calculate numerator: (6e-35)^2 = 36e-70.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So, 36e-70 / 1.8218e-30 = (36 / 1.8218) * 1e-40 ≈ 19.76 * 1e-40 = 1.976e-39.

But since c is negative of that, c = -1.976e-39.

Wait, but let me double-check: L is 6e-35, so L² is 36e-70. 36e-70 divided by (2 * 9.109e-31) is 36e-70 / 1.8218e-30 = (36 / 1.8218) * 1e-40 → yes, 19.76 * 1e-40 → 1.976e-39.

So, c = -1.976e-39.

Now, let's plug into the quadratic formula.

The quadratic equation is a r² + b r + c = 0.

So, a = -4e-18, b = 2.306e-28, c = -1.976e-39.

Wait, wait. Let me write the equation correctly. The equation is H0 r² + (k_e e²) r - (L²)/(2 m_e) = 0 → a = H0, which is -4e-18.

So, the quadratic equation is:

(-4e-18) r² + (2.306e-28) r - (1.976e-39) = 0.

Wait, but that seems a bit messy. Let's write it as:

a = -4e-18

b = 2.306e-28

c = -1.976e-39.

The quadratic formula is r = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4 a c) ] / (2 a).

Let's compute the discriminant first: D = b² - 4 a c.

Compute term by term.

b² = (2.306e-28)^2 = approx (2.306)^2 * 1e-56 = 5.32 * 1e-56 = 5.32e-56.

Compute 4 a c: 4 * (-4e-18) * (-1.976e-39) 

4 * (-4e-18) * (-1.976e-39) = 4 * 4e-18 * 1.976e-39 → 4 * 4 * 1.976 → 31.616e-57.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

4 * a * c = 4 * (-4e-18) * (-1.976e-39) 

The negatives cancel, so positive.

4 * 4e-18 = 1.6e-17.

1.6e-17 * 1.976e-39 = (1.6 * 1.976) * 1e-56 → approx 3.1616e-56.

So, D = b² - 4 a c = 5.32e-56 - 3.1616e-56 = (5.32 - 3.1616)e-56 → 2.1584e-56.

Then sqrt(D) = sqrt(2.1584e-56) → sqrt(2.1584) is approx 1.47, so 1.47e-28 m².

Wait, sqrt(2.1584e-56) = sqrt(2.1584) * sqrt(1e-56) → 1.47 * 1e-28 → 1.47e-28 meters.

Wait, no, sqrt(1e-56) is 1e-28, correct.

So, sqrt(D) = 1.47e-28 m.

Now, compute numerator: -b ± sqrt(D).

b is 2.306e-28 → -b is -2.306e-28.

So, numerator options:

Option 1: -2.306e-28 + 1.47e-28 = (-2.306 + 1.47)e-28 → (-0.836)e-28 → -8.36e-29.

Option 2: -2.306e-28 - 1.47e-28 = (-3.776)e-28 → -3.776e-28.

Denominator is 2a = 2*(-4e-18) = -8e-18.

So, r1 = (-8.36e-29) / (-8e-18) → positive value.

r2 = (-3.776e-28) / (-8e-18) → positive value.

Compute r1:

-8.36e-29 / -8e-18 = (8.36e-29) / (8e-18) = (8.36 /8 ) * 1e-11 → approx 1.045 * 1e-11 m → 1.045e-11 m.

r2:

-3.776e-28 / -8e-18 = (3.776e-28 / 8e-18) → (3.776 /8 ) * 1e-10 → 0.472 * 1e-10 → 4.72e-11 m.

Wait, so r1 is approximately 1.05e-11 m, and r2 is 4.72e-11 m.

Wait, but wait, the quadratic equation gives two roots, but which one is r_min and which is
