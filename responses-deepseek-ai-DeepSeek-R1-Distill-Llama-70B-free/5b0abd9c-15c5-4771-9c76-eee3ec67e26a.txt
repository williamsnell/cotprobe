Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question about the boiling of liquid NH3. Hmm, let me think. The question asks what happens during the boiling process. I remember that when a liquid boils, it's turning into a gas. So, the molecules must be moving more and gaining energy.

Let's look at the options. Option A says hydrogen bonds within individual NH3 molecules break. Wait, no, hydrogen bonds are between molecules, right? The bonds within a molecule, like the N-H bonds, are covalent. So breaking those would mean the molecule itself is breaking apart, which doesn't happen when boiling. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Hydrogen bonds between molecules get stronger. That doesn't make sense because when you boil something, the intermolecular forces should be breaking, not getting stronger. So B is likely wrong.

Option C: Temperature rises as molecules speed up. Wait, when you boil a liquid, you're adding heat, which increases the kinetic energy. But at the boiling point, the temperature doesn't rise anymore because the heat is used to break the intermolecular forces, not to increase temperature. So C might not be correct.

Option D: N-H bonds strengthen. No, those are covalent and they don't change during boiling. They might break at decomposition temperatures, which are way higher than boiling points. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Energy remains constant. No, boiling requires energy input. The system's energy increases as heat is absorbed, so E is wrong.

Option F: Temperature decreases as molecules slow down. No, that's the opposite. Boiling happens at a specific temperature, and adding heat makes molecules move faster, not slower. F is wrong.

Option G: N-H bonds break. No, same reasoning as A. The molecules stay intact when boiling, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Hydrogen bonds between molecules break. Oh, right! Boiling involves transition from liquid to gas, so the intermolecular hydrogen bonds must break, allowing molecules to escape into the vapor phase. So H makes sense.

Option I: Volume decreases. Wait, when a liquid turns to gas, the volume should increase because gases take up more space. Unless it's under pressure, but at boiling point, the volume would expand, so I is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H.

When liquid NH₃ reaches its boiling point, it transitions from the liquid phase to the gas phase. During this process, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds that hold the NH₃ molecules together in the liquid state must break apart to allow the molecules to enter the vapor phase. This is a fundamental aspect of the boiling process, as intermolecular forces are overcome by the increased kinetic energy of the molecules.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, G**: These suggest that covalent N-H bonds within individual NH₃ molecules break. This is incorrect because covalent bonds are much stronger and do not break during boiling.
- **B**: Suggests hydrogen bonds strengthen, which is incorrect because boiling weakens and breaks these intermolecular forces.
- **C, F**: Incorrect because the temperature remains constant at the boiling point; heat energy is used to break intermolecular bonds, not to change the temperature.
- **D**: Incorrect because N-H covalent bonds do not strengthen during boiling.
- **E**: Incorrect because energy is added to the system during boiling.
- **I**: Incorrect because the volume increases as the liquid turns into gas.
- **H**: Correct because the hydrogen bonds holding NH₃ molecules together break during boiling.

Thus, the correct answer is **H**.
