Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Two objects, a sphere and a block, same mass, released from rest at the top of an inclined plane. The sphere rolls without slipping, and the block slides without friction. Which one reaches the bottom first? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when objects roll down an incline, their acceleration depends on their moment of inertia and how their mass is distributed. Oh right, because part of the potential energy goes into both translational and rotational kinetic energy for the rolling object, while the sliding object only has translational.

Wait, but wait, the block is sliding without friction. So it doesn't have any energy loss due to friction, right? But the sphere is rolling without slipping, which implies static friction is acting on it. So does that mean the sphere has some torque and rotational motion?

So the key here is to compare the acceleration of both objects. The block, since it's sliding without friction, should just have acceleration a = g sinθ, where θ is the angle of the incline. Because there's no friction opposing the motion, so all the force component of gravity along the incline goes into acceleration.

Now for the sphere. Since it's rolling without slipping, it's experiencing both translational and rotational motion. The acceleration for a rolling object down an incline is given by a = (g sinθ) / (1 + I/(m r²)). Here, I is the moment of inertia, m is mass, and r is radius.

The moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5) m r². Plugging that into the acceleration formula, we get a = (g sinθ) / (1 + (2/5)/1) since I/(m r²) is (2/5 m r²)/(m r²) = 2/5. So the denominator becomes 1 + 2/5 = 7/5. So a = (g sinθ) * (5/7) = (5/7) g sinθ.

Wait, so the sphere's acceleration is (5/7) times g sinθ. The block's acceleration is g sinθ. So the block's acceleration is larger. Because 5/7 is approximately 0.714, so the sphere's acceleration is about 71.4% of the block's. So the block should reach the bottom first.

Wait, but I thought that for rolling without slipping, the acceleration is less than the block sliding without friction. So the block, having a higher acceleration, would take less time to reach the bottom.

So looking at the options, which one matches this reasoning. Let me go through the options.

Option A: The block, because it slides down faster due to its shape. Hmm, shape doesn't directly affect the acceleration here. It's more about whether it's rolling or sliding. So maybe not the best reasoning.

Option B: The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does. Oh, that makes sense. The sphere's energy is split into translational and rotational, so it accelerates slower. So this option looks correct.

Option C: Sphere because less surface area. No, surface area isn't the main factor here. It's about energy distribution, not contact area.

Option D: Both same time. No, because their accelerations are different.

Option E: Block because more surface area. No, that doesn't fit. Surface area isn't the determining factor here.

Option F: Sphere because shape allows it to roll faster. No, the sphere actually accelerates slower.

Option G: Sphere gains mechanical energy due to torque. No, torque is a factor for the sphere, but it leads to lower acceleration compared to the block. So this option doesn't make sense.

Option H: Sphere gains rotational KE, block doesn't. That's correct, but the option says the sphere reaches first, which is wrong. Because the block's acceleration is higher, so it arrives first.

Option I: Same time because same mass. No, because mass doesn't affect acceleration in this scenario—it cancels out in the equations.

Option J: Block because no mechanical energy loss due to friction. Wait, the sphere has static friction which is providing the torque, but static friction doesn't dissipate energy. The sphere isn't losing mechanical energy to friction; it's converting some into rotational KE. The block has no friction, so it's not losing any energy either. So both don't lose energy to friction. So Option J's reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, but both objects are without slipping and without friction. So the sphere has static friction aiding rotation, but no kinetic friction to cause energy loss. The block has no friction at all. So in that case, the block only has translational KE, while the sphere has both, but without energy loss. So the block's acceleration is higher.

So the correct answer should be B: The block, because it does not gain rotational KE, so all its energy goes into translational motion, making it accelerate faster.

Wait, but I thought that the block, without friction, only has translational motion. So it's correct that it gains no rotational KE because it's sliding, not rolling. So the block's acceleration is higher than the sphere's. So the block arrives first.

Yes, so Option B is the correct answer.

To determine which object reaches the bottom of the ramp first, we analyze the motion of both the block and the sphere. The block slides down without friction, meaning all its gravitational potential energy is converted into translational kinetic energy. Its acceleration is given by:

\[
a_{\text{block}} = g \sin\theta
\]

The sphere, on the other hand, rolls down without slipping. This means part of its gravitational potential energy is converted into rotational kinetic energy, in addition to translational kinetic energy. The acceleration of the sphere is reduced due to this energy distribution and is given by:

\[
a_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + \frac{I}{m r^2}}
\]

For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia \(I\) is \(\frac{2}{5} m r^2\). Substituting this into the formula, the sphere's acceleration becomes:

\[
a_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + \frac{2}{5}} = \frac{5}{7} g \sin\theta
\]

Since \(a_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{5}{7} g \sin\theta\) is less than \(a_{\text{block}} = g \sin\theta\), the block accelerates faster and reaches the bottom of the ramp first.

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The block's shape does not directly explain why it slides faster; the key factor is the absence of rotational kinetic energy.
- **B**: Correct. The block does not gain rotational kinetic energy, so all its energy goes into translational motion, allowing it to accelerate faster.
- **C**: Incorrect. Surface area in contact with the ramp is irrelevant to the result.
- **D**: Incorrect. The objects do not reach the bottom at the same time because their accelerations are different.
- **E**: Incorrect. Surface area is not the determining factor.
- **F**: Incorrect. The sphere does not roll faster; it accelerates slower due to rotational motion.
- **G**: Incorrect. While the sphere gains mechanical energy due to torque, this reduces its translational acceleration compared to the block.
- **H**: Incorrect. Although the sphere gains rotational kinetic energy, this does not allow it to reach the bottom first.
- **I**: Incorrect. Mass does not affect the result, as it cancels out in the acceleration equations.
- **J**: Incorrect. Neither object loses mechanical energy to friction; the difference lies in the distribution of energy.

The correct answer is **B**: The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does.
