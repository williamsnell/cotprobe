Okay, so I have this accounting problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

On August 4, a store bought five sofas. The invoice was for $7,000, with terms 2/10, n/30. The invoice was paid on August 13. The question is asking how much the store paid.

Hmm, I remember that terms like 2/10, n/30 mean something about discounts for early payment. Let me think. The first number is the discount percentage, the second is the number of days you have to pay to get that discount. And the n probably stands for "net", meaning the total days to pay without a discount.

So 2/10, n/30 means that if you pay within 10 days, you get a 2% discount. If you don't, you pay the full amount within 30 days.

Wait, but when is the last day to get the discount? The terms are 2/10, so the discount is available if payment is made within 10 days of the invoice date. So when is that?

The invoice date is August 4. So day 1 is August 5, right? Then day 10 would be August 14? Because August 4 is day 0. Let me count: August 4 is day 0, 5 is 1, 6 is 2, up to the 14th being day 10.

Wait, August has 31 days. So August 4 plus 10 days would be August 14. Because 4+10 is 14. So payment made by August 14 gets the 2% discount.

But the payment was made on August 13. That's within the 10-day window. So the store can take the 2% discount.

So the calculation would be: $7,000 minus 2% of $7,000.

Let me compute that. 2% of 7,000 is 0.02 *7000 = $140.

So the amount paid would be 7000 - 140 = $6,860.

Looking at the options, option G is $6,860. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the dates. Invoice on August 4, payment on August 13. So the number of days between August 4 and August 13 is 9 days. Because August 4 is day 0, then 5 is 1, up to 13 being day 9. So yes, it's within the 10-day period. So the discount applies.

Another way to think about it: the discount is available if paid within 10 days, so any time up to and including the 10th day. Since August 4 plus 10 days is August 14, any payment on or before August 14 qualifies. So August 13 is definitely within that period.

So yes, the correct calculation is $7,000 - (2% of 7,000) = $6,860. So the answer should be G.
</think>

The terms of the invoice are 2/10, n/30, meaning a 2% discount is available if payment is made within 10 days of the invoice date (August 4). The payment was made on August 13, which is within the 10-day window (August 4 to August 14). 

Calculating the discount:  
2% of $7,000 = $140.  
Total payment = $7,000 - $140 = $6,860.

Thus, the store paid **$6,860**. 

Answer: G
