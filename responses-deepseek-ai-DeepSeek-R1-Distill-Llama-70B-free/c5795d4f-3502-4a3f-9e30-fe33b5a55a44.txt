Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem says: A company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars it makes. If the company makes 15 white cars in one day, how many blue cars will it make? And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, alright. So the ratio of blue cars to white cars is 5:3. That means for every 3 white cars produced, they make 5 blue ones. Now, they made 15 white cars in a day. I need to find out how many blue cars that corresponds to.

Wait, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think setting up a proportion is the way to go here. So the ratio of blue to white is 5/3. So if white cars are 3, blue is 5. But in this case, white cars are 15, so I need to find the corresponding blue cars.

Let me write this down as a proportion. So blue cars over white cars equals 5 over 3. So:

blue / white = 5 / 3

We know white is 15, so plugging that in:

blue / 15 = 5 / 3

To solve for blue, I can cross-multiply. So blue equals (5/3) * 15. Let me compute that.

5 divided by 3 is approximately 1.666..., but let's keep it as a fraction. 5 times 15 is 75, and then divide by 3. 75 divided by 3 is 25. So blue cars would be 25.

Wait, let me double-check that. If 3 white correspond to 5 blue, then 15 white is 5 times more than 3. So 5 blue times 5 would be 25. Yeah, that makes sense. So 15 white would mean 25 blue cars.

Looking at the options, option A is 25. So the answer should be A.

The company's production ratio of blue cars to white cars is 5:3. Given that 15 white cars are produced, we set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{blue}}{\text{white}} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Substituting the known value for white cars:

\[
\frac{\text{blue}}{15} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for blue cars:

\[
\text{blue} = \frac{5}{3} \times 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the company will make 25 blue cars. The correct answer is:

A: 25
