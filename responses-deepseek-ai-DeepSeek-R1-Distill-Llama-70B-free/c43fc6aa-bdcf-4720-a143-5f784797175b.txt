Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about cross-cultural tests and their examples. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking about characteristics of cross-cultural tests and then naming four examples. So I need to understand what cross-cultural tests are. From what I remember, cross-cultural tests are designed to be administered across different cultures, meaning they should minimize cultural bias. They should be applicable to diverse populations without unfair advantages or disadvantages due to cultural differences.

So the tests should ideally use methods that don't rely heavily on language or cultural-specific knowledge. They might use non-verbal methods, like images or performance tasks, instead of verbal questions. That way, people from different language backgrounds can take them without issues.

Now, looking at the options, each option lists four tests. I need to identify which option includes tests that are known for being cross-cultural and using non-verbal or culture-fair methods.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Stanford-Binet, Kaufman Brief, Naglieri Nonverbal. I know the Wechsler scales are widely used, but they have verbal and performance sections. The Naglieri is nonverbal, which is good, but I'm not sure if all four are cross-cultural. Stanford-Binet has a nonverbal section as well, but I think these tests are more standardized but may still have cultural components.

Option B: Leiter International, Culture Fair, Progressive Matrices, Goodenough Draw-a-Man. Leiter is known as a nonverbal test, Culture Fair is designed to be culture-fair, Progressive Matrices (like Raven's) are nonverbal and used cross-culturally. Draw-a-Man is a test of intelligence that doesn't rely on language. So all four here seem to fit cross-cultural use.

Option C: Myers-Briggs, Big Five, Emotional Intelligence, Strengths and Difficulties. These are more personality and trait tests. Myers-Briggs is about personality types, Big Five is traits, so these might not be focused on intelligence or cognitive abilities in a cross-cultural way.

Option D: Peabody Picture, WAIS, Raven's, Differential Ability. Peabody uses pictures, which is good. WAIS is Wechsler's adult test, which has verbal components. Raven's is nonverbal and cross-cultural. Differential Ability Scales might be more standardized but not sure if all are non-verbal.

Option E: CPI, 16PF, Eysenck, NEO. These are all personality tests, so probably not the right category. Theyâ€™re about personality traits, not necessarily cross-cultural cognitive assessments.

Option F: Miller Analogies, Woodcock-Johnson, Stanford Achievement, Kaufman KABC. Miller Analogies are verbal and depend on knowledge, which might be culture-specific. Stanford Achievement is an achievement test, so again, possibly culture-bound.

Option G: Torrance Creative, Bender Gestalt, Conners, Achenbach. These seem more like specific assessments for creativity, motor skills, behavior, and emotional issues. Not sure about cross-cultural aspects here.

Option H: MMPI, Beck Depression, TAT, Rorschach. These are all related to personality and psychopathology. Rorschach and TAT are projective tests, which might be more culture-dependent.

Option I: Piers-Harris, Self-Directed, Strong, Career Assessments. These are self-concept and interest inventories, probably not cross-cultural cognitive tests.

Option J: Vineland, Bayley, Denver, Ages and Stages. These are developmental screening tools, focusing on adaptive behavior and development in children. They might be used across cultures, but the question is about cross-cultural tests, which I think are more about intelligence or cognitive abilities.

So, going back, the question is about characteristics of cross-cultural tests. They should be non-verbal or culture-fair, minimizing language and cultural bias. Looking at the options, Option B seems to fit best. Leiter International is a nonverbal test, Culture Fair is explicitly designed to be culture-fair, Progressive Matrices are non-verbal and used widely, and the Goodenough Draw-a-Man test is a non-verbal intelligence test.

Option A includes some verbal tests, which might not be as suitable for cross-cultural administration without adaptation. Similarly, option D includes WAIS, which has a verbal component.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The question asks about the characteristics of cross-cultural tests and provides options listing four examples each. Cross-cultural tests are designed to minimize cultural bias, often using non-verbal or culture-fair methods to ensure applicability across diverse populations. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** includes tests like the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and Stanford-Binet, which have verbal components that may introduce cultural bias, making them less suitable for cross-cultural use.
- **Option B** includes the Leiter International Performance Scale, Culture Fair Intelligence Test, Progressive Matrices, and Goodenough Draw-a-Man Test. These are all non-verbal or explicitly designed to be culture-fair, fitting the characteristics of cross-cultural tests.
- **Option C** focuses on personality and trait assessments, which are not primarily cognitive or intelligence-based cross-cultural tests.
- **Option D** includes the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), which has verbal components, making it less suitable for cross-cultural administration without adaptation.
- **Options E, F, G, H, I, and J** include tests focused on personality, achievement, creativity, psychopathology, self-concept, or developmental screening, which do not align with the focus on cognitive assessments in cross-cultural contexts.

Option B is the most appropriate choice as it includes tests specifically designed for cross-cultural use, emphasizing non-verbal and culture-fair methods.

Answer: B
