Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about correlations and how much variation in y is explained by x. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a correlation of 0.6 indicates that the percentage of variation in y explained by x is how many times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember something about correlation coefficients and their squares. Oh right, the coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation coefficient. So the r-squared value tells us the proportion of variance explained.

So for r = 0.6, r squared is 0.6^2 = 0.36. That means 36% of the variation in y is explained by x. And for r = 0.3, r squared is 0.3^2 = 0.09, so that's 9%.

The question is asking how many times greater the 36% is compared to 9%. So I need to divide 36 by 9. Let me calculate that: 36 / 9 = 4. So it's 4 times as much.

Looking at the options, B is 4. So the answer should be B.

The correlation coefficient squared gives the percentage of variation in y explained by x. For r = 0.6, r² = 0.36 (36%), and for r = 0.3, r² = 0.09 (9%). Dividing 36% by 9% gives 4. Thus, a correlation of 0.6 explains four times the variation compared to 0.3.
