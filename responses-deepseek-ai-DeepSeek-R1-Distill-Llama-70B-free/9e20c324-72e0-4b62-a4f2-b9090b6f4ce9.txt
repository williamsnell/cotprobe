Okay, so I have this question in front of me about ethical relativism and human rights. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given options is the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. Let me start by breaking down what I know about these terms.

Ethical relativism is the idea that moral judgments are relative to the cultural, historical, or personal context. So, what's right or wrong depends on where you are or who you are. This can make it hard to criticize other cultures because each has their own moral standards. Now, human rights are universal claims—like everyone deserves dignity, life, etc.—but ethical relativism would argue that these are just Western constructs and not applicable universally. So, relativists might be hostile to the idea of human rights because they see them as imposing one culture's values on others.

The question is asking which of the options is the strongest argument against this relativist hostility. The options are A through J, each a different philosophy or theory.

Let me go through each option and see how they relate.

A: Cognitivism. This is the belief that moral statements can be true or false, and that they express propositions about the world. So, if someone is a cognitivist, they might argue that human rights are based on objective truths, which would counter relativism. That could be a contender.

B: Social Contract Theory. This is the idea that moral and political obligations are based on a contract between individuals. Think Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau. Social contract theories often underpin human rights because they suggest that governments derive their authority from the consent of the governed and must protect certain rights. If a society's contract doesn't respect rights, maybe it's illegitimate. But how does this directly counter relativism? It's more about the basis of rights rather than the universality.

C: Utilitarianism. This is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. Utilitarians might support human rights if they lead to the greatest good, but relativism is more about cultural variance. Utilitarianism doesn't necessarily argue against cultural relativism because different cultures might have different utility calculations.

D: Empiricism. This is the idea that knowledge comes from experience and evidence. Empiricist approaches might look at human rights through data and outcomes. But I'm not sure how empiricism directly challenges relativism's stance on human rights. It's more about methodology than moral universals.

E: Nihilism. Nihilists believe that life lacks intrinsic meaning and that moral truths don't exist. That seems more aligned with relativism, actually, because if there's no objective right or wrong, then human rights don't have a basis either. So this would probably support relativism, not argue against it.

F: Positivism. Legal positivism holds that laws are based on social facts and human conventions. But in terms of ethics, positivism might say that what's right is what's legally codified. This could support relativism because different societies have different laws, so no universal rights.

G: Rationalism. Rationalists believe that knowledge and morality come from reason. So, if human rights can be derived through reason, then they're universal and not dependent on culture. For example, Kant's deontology is a form of rationalism. This could counter relativism because it posits that certain rights are rationally necessary, regardless of cultural context.

H: Communitarianism. This emphasizes the importance of community and social institutions. Communitarians might argue that rights are derived from the community, which could support relativism because different communities have different values. So this might not be a strong argument against relativism.

I: Existentialism. Existentialists focus on individual freedom and choice. They might argue that individuals must create their own meaning, but this doesn't necessarily support universal human rights. In fact, it could coexist with relativism because each individual's choices are personal and not necessarily universal.

J: Deontological Ethics. This is about duties and rules, like Kant's categorical imperative. Deontological ethics argues that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. So, human rights based on deontological principles would be universal and not subject to cultural variation. This directly challenges relativism because it asserts that some rights are absolute.

So, looking back, the question is about the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. The options that seem relevant are A, B, G, and J.

Cognitivism (A) says moral statements can be true or false, supporting the idea that human rights are objective. Social contract (B) provides a basis for rights but may not directly counter relativism. Rationalism (G) and Deontological Ethics (J) both argue for universal moral truths based on reason or duties, respectively.

Between G and J, deontological ethics is more about the content of moral rules, whereas rationalism is about the method (using reason). So, deontological ethics provides specific moral principles that are universal, making it a strong argument against relativism. Alternatively, rationalism supports the idea that reason can determine universal truths, which would include human rights.

I think both G and J are strong, but the question is about the strongest. Deontological ethics (J) presents clear, non-consequentialist moral rules that apply universally, making a direct case against relativism's cultural dependence.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest argument against relativism's hostility. So, perhaps J is better because it provides a foundation for human rights as absolute, while G is more about the method of knowing.

So the answer is either G or J. Hmm. Let me think again. Ethical relativism says that moral judgments are relative, so the strongest counter would be a theory that posits objective moral truths. Both cognitivism (A) and deontological ethics (J) do that. Cognitivism is the meta-ethical view that moral statements can be true, which supports the existence of objective rights. Deontological ethics is a normative theory that provides specific principles. So, which is the stronger argument against relativism?

I think the strongest argument would come from a theory that not only says moral statements can be true (cognitivism) but also provides a basis for universal moral rules. So deontological ethics would be the stronger argument because it gives content to those rights, not just asserting they can exist.

Alternatively, social contract theory (B) might not directly challenge relativism as much, unless the contract is based on universal human needs, but that's more of a stretch.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is J: Deontological Ethics.

The strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights is **Deontological Ethics**. Ethical relativism posits that moral judgments are relative to cultural, historical, or personal contexts, which can undermine the universality of human rights. Deontological Ethics, rooted in the idea of absolute duties and rules (e.g., Kant's categorical imperative), asserts that certain rights and moral principles are inherently valid and apply universally, regardless of cultural variations. This directly challenges relativism by providing a foundation for human rights as objective and non-negotiable. While other options, such as Rationalism (G) and Cognitivism (A), also support the idea of objective moral truths, Deontological Ethics offers specific, universal moral principles, making it the most compelling counter to relativism's hostility to human rights.
