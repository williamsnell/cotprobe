Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question with two statements, and I need to figure out if each is true or false. Let's take it step by step.

First, Statement 1: "The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximization algorithm." Hmm, I remember that the EM algorithm is used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in cases with incomplete data. From what I've studied, each iteration of EM does indeed increase the log-likelihood. The EM algorithm works by first finding the expectation (E-step) and then maximizing it (M-step), which should not decrease the log-likelihood. So I think Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: "One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment." Wait, Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. That means it doesn't require prior knowledge of the environment's dynamics. The agent learns the Q-values through trial and error by interacting with the environment. So if the statement says it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge, that's incorrect. So Statement 2 is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, option B is "True, False." So the answer should be B.

The log-likelihood increases with EM algorithm iterations, making Statement 1 true. Q-learning is model-free, so Statement 2 is false. 

Answer: B
