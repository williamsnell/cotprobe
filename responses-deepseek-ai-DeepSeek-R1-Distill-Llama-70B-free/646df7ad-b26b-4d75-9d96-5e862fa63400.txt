Question:

Suppose that a hypothesis test is conducted using a 5% significance level. Which of the following statements are correct?

(i) The significance level is equal to the size of the test

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hypothesis testing, and I need to figure out which statements are correct. Let's take it step by step. I remember that in hypothesis testing, the significance level plays a crucial role, so I should probably start by recalling what each part means.

The question has four statements (i to iv), and I need to check each one. The significance level is given as 5%, which is alpha (α). 

Statement (i): "The significance level is equal to the size of the test." Hmm, I think the size of a test refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait! Actually, the 'size' of a test is another term for the significance level, which is the maximum probability of Type I error—rejecting the null when it's actually true. So (i) should be correct because significance level equals the size.

Statement (ii): "The significance level is equal to the power of the test." Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. That's a Type II error situation. So power is 1 - beta. But significance level is alpha. They're different. So (ii) is incorrect.

Statement (iii): "2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test." Oh wait, in a two-tailed test with alpha 5%, each tail gets alpha/2, which is 2.5%. So yes, (iii) is correct.

Statement (iv): "5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test." Wait, no. Because if it's two-tailed, each tail is 2.5%, not 5%. So (iv) is incorrect.

Now compiling: Correct statements are (i) and (iii). Which options have these?

Looking at the options:

Option H: (i) and (iii) only. So that's the correct choice.

The correct answer is the option where statements (i) and (iii) are correct. 

- Statement (i) is correct because the significance level (α) is indeed equal to the size of the test, which is the probability of committing a Type I error.
- Statement (ii) is incorrect because the significance level is not equal to the power of the test; power refers to the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.
- Statement (iii) is correct because for a two-tailed test with a 5% significance level, each tail accounts for 2.5% of the distribution.
- Statement (iv) is incorrect because each tail of a two-tailed test does not account for 5%; this would be the case for a one-tailed test.

Thus, the correct option is:

H: (i) and (iii) only.

H
