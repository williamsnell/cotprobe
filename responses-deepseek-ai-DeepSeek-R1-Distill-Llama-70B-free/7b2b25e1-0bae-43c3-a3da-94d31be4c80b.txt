Okay, so I need to figure out how the money supply changes when the Fed sells government securities in an open market operation. Hmm, I remember that the Fed uses open market operations to control the money supply. When they sell securities, they're taking money out of the economy, right?

Wait, the reserve requirement is five percent. So I think that's the key here. I remember something about the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve requirement. So if the reserve is 5%, that's 0.05. So the multiplier would be 1 / 0.05, which is 20. 

So when the Fed sells securities, they're reducing the amount of money in circulation. The initial change is the amount they sold, which is $10 million. But because of the multiplier effect, the impact is bigger. So the total change in the money supply would be the initial change multiplied by the money multiplier.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When the Fed sells securities, they're doing so to banks, right? So when a bank buys securities from the Fed, their reserves decrease. Because the Fed is taking money from the banks. So the banks have less reserves, which means they can't lend as much, so the money supply decreases.

The initial impact is that the banks lose $10 million in reserves. But because of the reserve requirement, that affects the loans they can make. So the money multiplier comes into play. The formula I think is that the change in money supply is equal to the change in reserves multiplied by (1 + (1 - reserve requirement)/reserve requirement). Wait, no, maybe it's just 1 over the reserve ratio.

Wait no, the money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve requirement. So if the reserve requirement is 5%, then 1/0.05 is 20. So a change in reserves leads to a 20 times change in the money supply.

But wait, in this case, the Fed is selling $10 million of securities. So they're reducing the banks' reserves by $10 million. So the change in reserves is a decrease of $10 million. Then the money supply should decrease by 10 * 20 = $200 million.

Wait, but I've heard that the money supply can decrease by the amount sold multiplied by the multiplier. So selling $10 million would reduce the money supply by 10 * 20 = $200 million. So looking at the options, option A is a decrease of $200 million.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up whether the multiplier applies in this scenario. Let me think again. The reserve requirement is 5%, so the required reserves are 5% of deposits. If the Fed sells securities, banks have less reserves. So the banks' excess reserves decrease. So they have to reduce their lending.

Each dollar of reserves can support a certain amount of deposits. So if the Fed takes away $10 million in reserves, the potential deposits (money supply) would decrease by 10 million * (1/0.05) = $200 million.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer would be option A: decrease by $200 million.

When the Federal Reserve sells $10 million worth of government securities in an open market operation, it reduces the reserves of commercial banks by $10 million. The reserve requirement is 5%, meaning the money multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{reserve requirement}} = \frac{1}{0.05} = 20 \). 

The reduction in reserves leads to a proportional decrease in the money supply, calculated as the initial change in reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Thus, the money supply decreases by \( 10 \, \text{million} \times 20 = 200 \, \text{million} \).

The correct answer is **A: decrease by $200 million.**
