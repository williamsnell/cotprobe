Question:

Consider the following statements: (1) As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. (2) Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact. Which of these statements is True/False, as of 2020?

Options:

A: The first statement is unproven, the second is true
B: Neither statement has been definitively proven true or false
C: False, False
D: Both statements are partially true
E: The first statement is partially true, the second is false
F: The first statement is true, the second is unproven
G: True, False
H: True, True
I: False, True
J: The first statement is false, the second is partially true

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question presents two statements about life satisfaction and happiness, and I have to determine which are true or false based on what's known as of 2020. The options are combinations of true, false, unproven, or partially true for each statement.

Statement (1): As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction.

Hmm, I remember learning about the Easterlin paradox, which suggests that once basic needs are met, additional wealth doesn't necessarily lead to greater happiness. So, in poorer countries, increases in GDP per capita do lead to higher life satisfaction, but after a certain point, in richer countries, further wealth doesn't make people much happier. So the statement might be partially true because it's not universally the case. In some contexts, richer countries do report higher satisfaction, but only up to a point.

Statement (2): Important life events like marriage or divorce affect our happiness but have little long-term impact.

I think this relates to the concept of hedonic adaptation. People experience a boost in happiness when they get married, for example, but over time, they adapt, and their happiness returns to a baseline level. Similarly, negative events like divorce might cause a dip, but people often adapt back. So this statement is generally considered true. Studies have shown that the impact of such events isn't long-lasting in terms of overall life satisfaction.

So evaluating the options:

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option H says both are true. But wait, statement 1 isn't entirely true because after a certain point, more wealth doesn't increase satisfaction. So statement 1 would be partially true, not fully true. So H can't be correct.

Option D says both are partially true. Statement 1 is partially true because it's true up to a point. Statement 2 is actually true, not partially. So D might not be right.

Option A: first unproven, second true. But I think statement 1 has evidence supporting it partially, so unproven might not be accurate.

Option I: first false, second true. But statement 1 isn't entirely false; it's partially true.

Option E: first partially true, second false. No, because statement 2 is true.

Option J: first false, second partially true. No, because statement 1 isn't entirely false.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

Statement 1 isn't universally true because after a certain wealth level, life satisfaction doesn't increase. So the statement as written is partially true, not entirely true. So if the question is whether the statement is true, then the first statement is only partially true. Similarly, the second statement is true as per hedonic adaptation.

Looking again at the options, none seem to exactly match. Wait, the options are about whether each statement is true or false as of 2020.

So statement 1: is it true or false? Well, the general trend does show that as countries get richer, up to a point, life satisfaction increases. So in general, the statement is true. But wait, the Easterlin paradox says that beyond a certain point, it doesn't. So the statement doesn't say "without limit" though. It just says "as countries get richer". So if a country is getting richer, and it's not yet at the satiation point, then life satisfaction increases. So the statement is true in the sense that there's a positive correlation, even if it's not linear beyond certain points. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the way statement 1 is phrased might be considered true because on average, richer countries do have higher life satisfaction. The fact that after a certain point, additional wealth doesn't add much doesn't make the statement false; it just adds nuance. So the statement could still be true.

So statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is true. Then option H would be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement 1 is only partially true. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps statement 1 is true because the general trend supports it, even if it's not a straight line. So in 2020, the data would show that as countries get richer, their average life satisfaction does tend to be higher. So statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is also true because the research supports the idea of hedonic adaptation.

So then the answer would be H: both statements are true.

The question evaluates the truthfulness of two statements about life satisfaction and happiness as of 2020. Here's the analysis:

1. **Statement (1):** "As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction."  
   This statement aligns with the general trend observed in research, where increasing wealth correlates with higher life satisfaction, particularly in countries where basic needs are met. While the Easterlin paradox suggests that beyond a certain point, additional wealth does not significantly increase happiness, the statement does not claim that wealth increases satisfaction indefinitely. Therefore, the statement is considered true based on the available evidence.

2. **Statement (2):** "Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact."  
   This statement is supported by the concept of hedonic adaptation, where people tend to return to their baseline happiness level after significant life events. Research consistently shows that the long-term impact of such events on overall happiness is minimal. Thus, this statement is also true.

Given the analysis, both statements are true.
