Question:

A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?

Options:

A: Metaphase
B: G1
C: Prophase
D: G0
E: Prometaphase
F: S phase
G: Anaphase
H: M
I: Telophase
J: G2

Okay, so I have this question about cell cycle phases and p53 gene mutations. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question is about a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. He received radiation therapy, but the tumor kept growing and he died six months later. The tumor cells have a point mutation in the p53 gene, making the product inactive.

I remember that p53 is a tumor suppressor gene. When it's working, it plays a big role in regulating the cell cycle. Specifically, I think p53 is involved in stopping the cell cycle when there's DNA damage. So, when DNA is damaged, p53 steps in to prevent the cell from dividing until the damage is repaired.

Wait, when does this happen? Oh right, p53 acts primarily during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The G1 checkpoint is where the cell decides whether to proceed with division or not. If the DNA is damaged, p53 triggers cell cycle arrest at this point, allowing time for repair. If the damage is irreparable, p53 can also induce apoptosis, which is programmed cell death.

So in this patient, the p53 gene is mutated and inactive. That means when the radiation therapy causes DNA damage (because that's how radiation works, right? It damages the DNA of cancer cells), the cells can't arrest the cycle at G1. Without this arrest, the damaged cells might proceed to S phase, where DNA replication happens. But replicating damaged DNA can lead to more mutations and uncontrolled cell growth, which is bad.

Wait, the question is about why the tumor kept growing despite radiation. Normally, radiation would cause DNA damage, and if p53 is working, the cells would stop at G1 and either repair or die. But if p53 isn't working, the cells can't stop at G1. So the cells might not undergo apoptosis, and instead, they might proceed through the cell cycle, leading to tumor progression.

So the defect is in the G1 phase checkpoint. Therefore, the tumor cells can't arrest in G1, leading to unchecked cell division despite the DNA damage from radiation.

Looking at the options, the question is asking which phase's cell cycle arrest is defective. The options include G1 (option B) and G2 (option J), among others.

I think the key here is that p53 primarily functions at the G1 checkpoint. So the defect is in G1 arrest.

Wait, but another point: G2 is another checkpoint before mitosis. I think the G2 checkpoint is more about making sure DNA replication is complete and any damage is repaired before entering mitosis. So if p53 isn't working, both G1 and G2 checkpoints might be affected, but p53's main role is in G1.

So the answer should be G1 phase arrest is defective. Looking back, option B is G1.

Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's G1. So the correct answer is B.

The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly at the G1 checkpoint. When DNA damage occurs, such as from radiation therapy, p53 normally induces cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase to allow time for DNA repair or, if the damage is irreparable, to trigger apoptosis. In this case, the patient's tumor cells have a mutation in the p53 gene, rendering it inactive. As a result, the cells cannot arrest at the G1 phase, leading to unchecked cell division and tumor progression despite radiation therapy.

Among the options provided, the G1 phase (option B) is the correct answer because p53's primary function is to regulate the G1 checkpoint, and its inactivation directly impairs this process.

Answer: B
