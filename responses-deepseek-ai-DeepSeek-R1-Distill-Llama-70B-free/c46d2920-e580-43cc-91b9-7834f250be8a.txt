Okay, so I have this physics problem here about camera lenses and focusing. Hmm, I remember that cameras use lenses to focus images, and when you adjust the focus, you're moving the lens to get a clear image. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the lens has a focal length of 6 cm. Wait, wait, focal length is usually fixed, right? Oh, right, but when you focus, you're moving the lens relative to the film or sensor. So initially, the camera is focused for very distant objects. Distant objects, like at infinity, so the image is formed at the focal point. So the film is at the focal length, which is 6 cm from the lens.

Now, the object is 2 meters away from the lens. Oh, wait, 2 meters is 200 cm. So the object distance is 200 cm. We need to find where the image will form when the object is at 200 cm, and then see how much the lens must move.

I think the thin lens equation is what I need here. The formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Where f is the focal length, do is object distance, and di is image distance.

So plugging in the numbers. f is 6 cm, do is 200 cm.

1/6 = 1/200 + 1/di.

Let me solve for di. Subtract 1/200 from both sides.

1/di = (1/6) - (1/200). Let me find a common denominator. 6 and 200. 6 * 200 = 1200, but maybe a smaller one? 6 is 2*3, 200 is 2^3 *5^2. So the least common multiple is 600, I think.

So converting fractions:

1/6 = 100/600,

1/200 = 3/600.

So 1/di = 100/600 - 3/600 = 97/600.

So di = 600/97 cm. Let me calculate that.

600 divided by 97. 97*6=582, so 600-582=18. So 6 and 18/97. 18/97 is approximately 0.1855, so di≈6.1855 cm.

Wait, that's about 6.1855 cm. So the image is formed a little further away than the focal length. Because when the object is at 200 cm, which is a finite distance, the image is slightly beyond f.

But wait, when focused at infinity, the image is at f. So now, when the object is at 200 cm, the image is at 6.1855 cm. So the difference between the two positions is the movement of the lens.

Wait, wait. Wait, when you focus on a distant object, the lens is at the focal length from the film. So for infinity, di would be 6 cm. Now, for the object at 200 cm, di is 600/97 ≈6.1855 cm. So the image is now 6.1855 cm in front of the lens.

Wait, but the film is behind the lens, right? So the lens needs to move towards the film or away from it? Let me visualize.

If the image is further from the lens than the focal length, then the film needs to be moved further away? Or wait, no. Wait, the lens is moving, not the film. Because the film is fixed. So when the image distance increases, the lens must move away from the film to allow the image to form on the film. Or wait, maybe the other way around.

Wait, no. Think of the camera: when you focus on something closer, the lens moves away from the film. Because for closer objects, the image forms further away, so the lens must extend.

Wait, let's think again. When the object is at infinity, the image is at 6 cm. Now, when the object is at 200 cm, the image is at di ≈6.1855 cm. So the image is a bit further from the lens than when it was at infinity.

Wait, wait no. Wait, when an object is at a finite distance greater than 2f, the image is between f and 2f on the other side. Oh wait, no. Object at 200 cm is greater than 2f (since 2*6=12 cm, and 200 cm is way more than that). So when object is beyond 2f, the image is between f and 2f. So in this case, the image is at approximately 6.1855 cm. Which is between 6 cm and 12 cm. So the image is a bit further than f.

So the film is at 6 cm when focused at infinity. Now, the image is at 6.1855 cm, so the film needs to move to that position. But since the film can't move, the lens must move towards the film? Or away?

Wait, no. The lens is what moves. So for the image to stay on the film, when the image distance increases beyond f, the lens must move away from the film. Because the image is forming further back, so the lens needs to move away (toward the object side) to allow the image to reach the film.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of it as the lens moving. When the lens moves away from the film (i.e., towards the object), the image distance would increase. So yes, when the image needs to form further away, the lens moves away from the film.

So in this case, since the image is at about 6.1855 cm, which is 0.1855 cm further than 6 cm. So the lens must move 0.1855 cm away from the film. Wait, let me calculate the exact difference.

di = 600/97 = approximately 6.185367 cm. So 6.185367 -6 = 0.185367 cm. So about 0.185 cm.

Looking at the options, which are in 0.x cm. The options are A:0.5, B:1.5, C:0.7, D:0.3, E:0.4, F:0.2, G:0.8, H:0.1, I:0.6, J:1.0.

0.185 is approximately 0.19 cm, which is closest to 0.2 cm. So option F is 0.2 cm away from the film.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it: when the object is closer, the image moves further away. So the lens moves away from the film.

So the answer should be option F: 0.2 cm away from the film.

Wait but let me make sure. Let me recalculate di.

1/f =1/do +1/di.

f=6 cm, do=200 cm.

1/6 = 1/200 + 1/di.

Compute 1/di = 1/6 -1/200 = (200 -6)/(6*200) )? Wait no, wait 1/6 is 200/1200, 1/200 is 6/1200. So 200/1200 -6/1200 =194/1200 =97/600.

So di=600/97 cm. 600 ÷97: 97 ×6=582, 600-582=18, so 6.18... So 0.18 cm. So 0.18 cm is about 0.185 cm, as before.

So the movement is 0.185 cm, which would round to 0.2 cm. So the correct option is F:0.2 cm away.

Wait but wait, the multiple-choice options: option F says 0.2 cm away from the film, which means the lens moves away, so the image forms further, which is correct.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we use the thin lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \( f \) is the focal length, \( d_o \) is the object distance, and \( d_i \) is the image distance. The focal length is given as \( f = 6 \, \text{cm} \), and the object distance is \( d_o = 200 \, \text{cm} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{1}{d_i} \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{200}
\]

Finding a common denominator (\( 600 \)):

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{100}{600} - \frac{3}{600} = \frac{97}{600}
\]

Thus:

\[
d_i = \frac{600}{97} \approx 6.1855 \, \text{cm}
\]

The image distance is approximately \( 6.1855 \, \text{cm} \), which is slightly greater than the focal length (\( 6 \, \text{cm} \)). This means the image forms \( 0.1855 \, \text{cm} \) further from the lens compared to when the object is at infinity. Since the film is fixed, the lens must move away from the film to ensure the image forms on the film.

The required movement of the lens is approximately \( 0.1855 \, \text{cm} \), which rounds to \( 0.2 \, \text{cm} \). Therefore, the lens must move \( 0.2 \, \text{cm} \) away from the film.

The correct answer is:

**F: 0.2 centimeters away from the film**
