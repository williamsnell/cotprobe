Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a projector and an image. Hmm, I remember that projectors use lenses to project images, and this must relate to the lens formula. Let me think about what I know.

The problem states that the projector's lens has a focal length of 40 cm. The object, which is the slide, is 4.0 cm long. The image is projected onto a screen that's 20 meters away from the lens. I need to find the size of the image.

Wait, right, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. But wait, I should make sure about the sign conventions. Typically, in optics, the object distance u is positive because it's on the same side as the incoming light. The image distance v would be positive if it's a real image, which it is here because it's projected on a screen.

Wait, but the problem gives the object size as 4 cm. So that's the height of the object. I think the image height can be found using the magnification formula, which is m = image height / object height = -v/u. So once I find v, the image distance, I can find the image height.

Wait, but the screen is 20 meters away. Oh wait, that's the image distance, right? Because the image is formed on the screen. So v is 20 meters. Let me convert that into centimeters because the focal length is given in cm. 20 meters is 2000 cm.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the object is placed at some distance u from the lens, and the image is formed at v=2000 cm. So I can plug into the lens formula to find u first, then use magnification to find the image height.

So the lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

Given that f=40 cm, v=2000 cm. So plugging in:

1/40 = 1/u + 1/2000.

Let me calculate 1/u = 1/40 - 1/2000. Let's see, 1/40 is 0.025, 1/2000 is 0.0005. So 0.025 - 0.0005 = 0.0245. So 1/u = 0.0245, which means u = 1 / 0.0245 ≈ 40.816 cm. Approximately 40.816 cm.

Wait, but wait. Let's do it more accurately. Let me compute 1/40 minus 1/2000.

1/40 is 50/2000. 1/2000 is 1/2000. So 50/2000 -1/2000 = 49/2000. So 1/u =49/(2000). So u=2000/49 ≈40.816 cm.

Okay, so the object distance u is about 40.816 cm. Now, the magnification m is -v/u. So m= - (2000 cm) / (40.816 cm) ≈ -2000/40.816 ≈ -49.0 (approximately). So the negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, but since the question is about the size, the absolute value is what matters.

So the image height is m multiplied by the object height. The object is 4 cm, so image height is 4 cm * 49 = 196 cm.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 2000 divided by 40.816. Let's compute that more accurately.

40.816 is approximately 40 + 13/16 (since 0.816 is about 13/16, which is 0.8125). So 2000 / (2000/49) )= 49. So yes, 2000/(2000/49) )=49 exactly. So m is -49, so the image is 4 *49=196 cm tall.

Looking at the options, option I is 196 cm. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we use the lens formula and magnification formula. The lens formula is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

where \( f \) is the focal length, \( u \) is the object distance, and \( v \) is the image distance. The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = \frac{\text{image height}}{\text{object height}} = -\frac{v}{u}
\]

### Step 1: Convert distances to the same unit
The focal length is \( f = 40 \, \text{cm} \), and the image distance is \( v = 20 \, \text{m} = 2000 \, \text{cm} \).

### Step 2: Solve for \( u \) using the lens formula
Rearranging the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{v}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{40} - \frac{1}{2000}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{u} = 0.025 - 0.0005 = 0.0245
\]

\[
u = \frac{1}{0.0245} \approx 40.816 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate magnification
The magnification is:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{2000}{40.816} \approx -49
\]

The negative sign indicates the image is inverted, but the size is determined by the absolute value.

### Step 4: Calculate the image height
The object height is \( 4.0 \, \text{cm} \). The image height is:

\[
\text{image height} = m \cdot \text{object height} = 49 \cdot 4 = 196 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Final Answer
The size of the projected image is **196 cm**, which corresponds to option **I**.
