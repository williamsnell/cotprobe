Okay, so I've got this problem here about convex polygons and dividing them into triangles without any intersecting lines. Hmm, I remember that this is a classic combinatorics problem. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about an 8-sided convex polygon. So, an octagon. I think the process of dividing it into triangles is called triangulation. Right, triangulation. And the key here is that no lines intersect each other inside the polygon.

I recall that for any convex polygon with n sides, the number of triangles formed in a triangulation is always (n-2). So for an octagon, that's 6 triangles. Oh wait, but the question isn't about the number of triangles, it's about the number of ways to do the triangulation.

Oh right, the number of ways is given by the Catalan numbers. Catalan numbers! I remember that the nth Catalan number counts the number of ways to triangulate a convex polygon with (n+2) sides. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Let me think.

Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics, including the number of ways to correctly match parentheses, the number of rooted binary trees, and yes, the number of ways to triangulate a polygon.

The formula for the nth Catalan number is (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). So for example, the first few Catalan numbers are C0=1, C1=1, C2=2, C3=5, etc.

Wait, but in the context of polygons, how does it apply? I think the nth Catalan number corresponds to the number of ways to triangulate a convex polygon with (n+2) sides. Because when n=2 (the second Catalan number), it's 2, which would be a quadrilateral (4 sides). Let's check: a quadrilateral can be split into two triangles in two ways. Oh yeah, that makes sense.

So for a polygon with m sides, the number of triangulations is the (m-2)th Catalan number. Because if m=4 (n=2), then C2=2, which is correct.

So in this problem, the polygon has 8 sides. So m=8. Then the number of triangulations should be the (8-2)=6th Catalan number. Wait, but let me make sure about the indexing. Because some sources index Catalan numbers starting from C0, others from C1.

Wait, the formula is C_n = (1/(n+1)) * binomial(2n, n). So for n=0, C0=1, which would correspond to a polygon with 2 sides (digon), which is a line segment, so no triangles. So perhaps the Catalan number C_{m-2} corresponds to an m-gon.

Wait, let me think again. For a triangle (3 sides), there's only one way to triangulate it, which is itself. So for m=3, the number of triangulations is 1, which is C1=1? Or is it C0?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's approach it differently. Let's use the Catalan numbers and their position.

C0 = 1
C1 = 1
C2 = 2
C3 = 5
C4 = 14
C5 = 42
C6 = 132
C7 = 429
C8 = 1430

So for each m (sides), the number of triangulations is C_{m-2}.

So for m=3 (triangle), C1=1. Correct.
For m=4 (quadrilateral), C2=2. Correct.
For m=5 (pentagon), C3=5. Yes, that's right.
So for m=8, it would be C6, which is 132.

Looking at the options, option J is 132. So the answer should be J.

To determine the number of ways to triangulate a convex polygon with 8 sides (an octagon) without intersecting lines, we use the concept of Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number, given by the formula:

\[
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n},
\]

counts the number of ways to triangulate a convex polygon with \(n+2\) sides. For an octagon (\(m=8\)), the number of triangulations corresponds to the \((m-2)\)-th Catalan number, which is \(C_6\).

The first few Catalan numbers are:
\[
C_0 = 1, \, C_1 = 1, \, C_2 = 2, \, C_3 = 5, \, C_4 = 14, \, C_5 = 42, \, C_6 = 132, \, C_7 = 429, \, C_8 = 1430.
\]

Thus, for \(m=8\), the number of triangulations is \(C_6 = 132\). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 132**
