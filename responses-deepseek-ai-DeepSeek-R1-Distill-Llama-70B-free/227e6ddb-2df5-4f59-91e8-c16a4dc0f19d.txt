Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the density of blood by mixing two liquids, xylene and bromobenzene. Hmm, I remember that when an object floats in a fluid, its density matches the fluid's density. So the blood drops don't sink or rise, meaning their density is the same as the mixture.

The mixture is made by volume: 72% xylene and 28% bromobenzene. Their densities are given as 0.867 g/cm³ for xylene and 1.497 g/cm³ for bromobenzene. I think I need to calculate the density of the mixture.

Wait, right, density is mass over volume. But since the mixture is by volume, I should find the mass contributed by each part and then divide by the total volume.

Let me think: Let's say the total volume is 100 mL for simplicity. So 72 mL is xylene, 28 mL is bromobenzene.

Mass of xylene: volume * density. So 72 mL * 0.867 g/cm³. Since 1 mL is 1 cm³, that's 72 * 0.867. Let me calculate that. 70*0.867 is 60.69, and 2*0.867 is 1.734, so total is around 62.424 grams.

Mass of bromobenzene: 28 mL * 1.497 g/cm³. So 28 * 1.5 is 42, but a bit less. Let's see, 28 * 1.497. 20*1.497 is 29.94, and 8*1.497 is 11.976. Adding those gives 41.916 grams.

Total mass is 62.424 + 41.916 = 104.34 grams.

Total volume is 100 mL, which is 100 cm³. So density is mass/volume = 104.34 / 100 = 1.0434 g/cm³.

So the blood's density must be 1.0434 g/cm³. Looking at the options, option F is 1.0434 g/cm³. That should be the answer.

To determine the density of blood, we calculate the density of the mixture in which the blood drops neither sink nor rise. The mixture contains 72% xylene (density = 0.867 g/cm³) and 28% bromobenzene (density = 1.497 g/cm³) by volume. 

Assuming a total volume of 100 mL (or 100 cm³) for simplicity:

1. **Mass of xylene**:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 72 \, \text{mL} \times 0.867 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 62.424 \, \text{g}.
   \]

2. **Mass of bromobenzene**:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 28 \, \text{mL} \times 1.497 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 41.916 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Total mass of the mixture**:  
   \[
   \text{Total Mass} = 62.424 \, \text{g} + 41.916 \, \text{g} = 104.34 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Density of the mixture**:  
   \[
   \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Total Mass}}{\text{Total Volume}} = \frac{104.34 \, \text{g}}{100 \, \text{cm}^3} = 1.0434 \, \text{g/cm}^3.
   \]

Since the blood drops are in equilibrium, their density matches the density of the mixture. Therefore, the density of the blood is **1.0434 g/cm³**, which corresponds to option **F**.
