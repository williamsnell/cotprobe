Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem to solve: evaluate log base 8 of 2, which is written as log_8 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on logarithms, but I remember some basic properties. Let me think.

Wait, logarithms are the inverses of exponents, right? So log_b a means the exponent you need to raise b to get a. So in this case, log_8 2 is asking, "8 raised to what power gives 2?"

So I'm trying to find x such that 8^x = 2. Oh right, because log_8 2 = x implies 8^x = 2.

Now, I remember that 8 is a power of 2. Specifically, 8 is 2^3. So maybe I can rewrite this equation in terms of base 2 to make it easier.

Let me try that. So, if 8 is 2^3, then 8^x is (2^3)^x. And when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So (2^3)^x = 2^(3x).

So now my equation is 2^(3x) = 2^1, because 2 is 2^1. Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So 3x = 1.

Solving for x, I divide both sides by 3. So x = 1/3.

Wait, so log_8 2 equals 1/3. Let me check if that makes sense. Because 8^(1/3) is the cube root of 8, which is 2. Yep, that works out.

I guess another way to think about it is using the change of base formula. The formula says that log_b a = log_c a / log_c b, where c is any positive number. Using base 2 might be easiest here.

So log_8 2 = log_2 2 / log_2 8. We know log_2 2 is 1 because any log base a of a is 1. And log_2 8 is 3 because 2^3 is 8. So 1 divided by 3 is 1/3. That matches what I got earlier.

So both methods give me the same answer, 1/3. Looking back at the options, option A is 1/3. So the correct answer should be A.

To evaluate $\log_8 2$, we recognize that logarithms are the inverse of exponents. Specifically, $\log_8 2$ asks, "To what power must 8 be raised to obtain 2?" This can be expressed as solving for $x$ in the equation $8^x = 2$.

Since $8$ is a power of $2$ ($8 = 2^3$), we rewrite $8^x$ as $(2^3)^x = 2^{3x}$. Thus, the equation becomes $2^{3x} = 2^1$. Equating the exponents gives $3x = 1$, so $x = \frac{1}{3}$.

To verify, we can use the change of base formula: $\log_8 2 = \frac{\log_2 2}{\log_2 8}$. Knowing that $\log_2 2 = 1$ and $\log_2 8 = 3$, we find $\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}$.

Both methods confirm that $\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

A: $\frac{1}{3}$.

Answer: A
