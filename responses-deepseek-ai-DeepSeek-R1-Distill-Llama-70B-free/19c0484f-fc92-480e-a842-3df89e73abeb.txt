Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about airflow through a pipe that narrows. Hmm, okay, I remember some concepts from fluid dynamics. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The pipe has a diameter of 1.1 ft and narrows to 0.8 ft. Air is moving through it with a mass flow rate of 6.1 slugs/sec. At the larger diameter, the pressure is 110 psig and the temperature is 75°F. I need to find the pressure, velocity, density, and temperature in the smaller section.

Wait, psig is pounds per square inch gauge, right? So that's the pressure above atmospheric. I think I need to convert that to absolute pressure because most equations use absolute. So 110 psig plus 14.7 psi (standard atmospheric) gives 124.7 psia.

Since the pipe is narrowing, the velocity should increase because of the continuity equation. Oh right, the continuity equation says that the mass flow rate (ṁ) is constant, so ṁ = ρ * A * v, where ρ is density, A is area, and v is velocity. So when the area decreases, if density stays the same, velocity would increase. But wait, density might change if pressure or temperature changes.

Wait, but the problem involves compressible flow, so Bernoulli's equation might come into play. But wait, I'm not sure. Since air is a compressible fluid, maybe I should consider the ideal gas law as well. Because pressure and temperature changes would affect density.

Let me list what I know:

- Diameter at section 1 (D1) = 1.1 ft → radius r1 = D1/2 = 0.55 ft.
Area A1 = π r1² = π (0.55)^2 ≈ 0.95 sq.ft.
- Section 2 diameter D2 = 0.8 ft → r2 = 0.4 ft.
Area A2 = π (0.4)^2 ≈ 0.503 sq.ft.
- Mass flow rate ṁ = 6.1 slugs/sec.
- P1 = 110 psig = 124.7 psia.
- T1 = 75°F. I need to convert that to absolute temperature, probably in Rankine. Because Fahrenheit to Rankine is T(R) = T(F) + 459.67. So 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 R.

I think I should first find the density at section 1. Using the ideal gas law, PV = mRT, but m is mass. Wait, the ideal gas equation can be written as P = (ρ R T), where ρ is density, R is the specific gas constant for air. What's R for air? I remember R_specific for air is about 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R) because R = 1716 ft·lb/(slug·°R). Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, no, R is usually 53.35 ft·lb/(lb-mol·R), but when using slugs, we have to adjust. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the value as 1716 ft·lb/(slug·°R). Hmm, I'm a bit shaky here. Alternatively, sometimes it's given as 1716 ft·lbf per slug·R. Yes, that sounds right.

So, density ρ = P/(R T). Let's compute that for section 1.

P1 = 124.7 psia. Wait, psia is pounds per square inch absolute, which is force per area. So to use in the ideal gas law, which involves pressure in lb/ft², I think. Because 1 psi is 144 psf (pounds per square foot) because 1 ft² = 144 in². So 124.7 psi = 124.7 * 144 lb/ft².

Calculating that: 124.7 * 144 → Let me compute that. 100 *144=14400, 24*144=3456, 0.7*144=100.8. So 14400 + 3456=17856 + 100.8=17956.8 lb/ft².

So P1 = 17956.8 lb/ft².

R for air is 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R).

T1 = 534.67 R.

So ρ1 = P1/(R T1) = (17956.8) / (1716 * 534.67).

Wait, calculating denominator: 1716 * 534.67 → Let me compute that.

Approximating, 1700 * 535 = 1700 *500=850000 and 1700*35=59500 → 909500. But let me do it accurately:

1716 * 534.67 = ?

Well, 1716 * 500 = 858000.

1716 * 34.67 = ?

1716 *30=51480.

1716 *4.67 = Let's see, 1716 *4=6864, 1716 *0.67≈1151.72. So 6864 + 1151.72≈8015.72.

So 51480 + 8015.72 = 59495.72.

So total is 858000 +59495.72 ≈917,495.72.

So denominator is approximately 917,496 lb·R/(ft²·slug).

Wait, because R is in ft·lb/(slug·R), so when multiplied by T in R, the denominator becomes lb·R/(slug·ft²). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong. Wait, P is in lb/ft², R is in (ft·lb)/(slug·R), and T is in R. So P/(R*T) would have units (lb/ft²) / ( (ft·lb)/(slug·R) * R ) ) → the R in the denominator and numerator would cancel, so units are (lb/ft²) * (slug·R)/(ft·lb·R)) → the lb cancels, R cancels, ft remains in denominator. So (slug)/(ft² * ft) ) → slug/ft³. So that makes sense for density.

So back to the calculation: ρ1 = 17956.8 / (917,496) → Let's compute that.

17956.8 ÷ 917,496 ≈ approximately 0.01956 slugs/ft³.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 917,496 * 0.02 = 18349.92 → which is more than 17956.8. So 0.02 would give 18350, which is higher. So perhaps 0.0195.

So ρ1 ≈ 0.01956 slugs/ft³.

Now, the mass flow rate ṁ = ρ * A * v. So ṁ = 6.1 = ρ1 * A1 * v1.

We can find v1 (velocity in section 1). A1 is the area, which we calculated as approx 0.95 sq.ft.

So v1 = ṁ / (ρ1 * A1 ) = 6.1 / (0.01956 * 0.95).

Calculating denominator: 0.01956 *0.95 ≈ 0.0186.

So 6.1 / 0.0186 ≈ 328 ft/s.

Wait, but in the options, the velocities are all around 600-800. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the area is larger? Let me recalculate A1.

D1 = 1.1 ft → radius r1 = 0.55 ft. So A1 = π r1² = π * (0.55)^2 = π * 0.3025 ≈ 0.9503 sq.ft. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should check the calculation for ρ1 again.

Let me redo ρ1:

P1 = 124.7 psia → 124.7 * 144 = 17956.8 lb/ft².

R = 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R).

T1 = 75°F = 534.67 R.

So ρ1 = 17956.8 / (1716 * 534.67).

Let me compute 1716 * 534.67 more accurately.

534.67 * 1716:

Let me do 534 * 1716:

534 = 500 + 34.

500 *1716= 858,000.

34 *1716: 30*1716=51,480; 4*1716=6,864 → 51,480 +6,864=58,344.

So 534 *1716=858,000 +58,344=916,344.

Now 0.67 *1716 = 1151.72.

So 534.67 * 1716=916,344 + 1151.72=917,495.72.

So denominator is 917,495.72 lb·R/(slug·ft²).

Wait, no, the denominator is 1716 * T, so yeah, 917,495.72 lb/(ft²·slug) → no, wait, no, because P is in lb/ft², R is in (ft·lb)/(slug·R), so when multiplied by T (R), the denominator becomes (ft·lb)/(slug) * R → when divided into P (lb/ft²), we get (lb/ft²) * (slug) / (ft·lb) ) → (slug)/(ft^3).

So 17956.8 lb/ft² divided by 917,495.72 (ft·lb)/(slug·R) * R → because R and T units: R is ft·lb/(slug·R), T in R. So R*T is ft·lb/slug.

So 17956.8 / (917,495.72) → let's compute that.

Let me compute 17956.8 / 917495.72.

Dividing 17956.8 by 917495.72 ≈ approximately 0.01956 slugs/ft³.

So ρ1 ≈ 0.01956 slugs/ft³.

So then velocity v1 = ṁ / (ρ1 A1) → 6.1 / (0.01956 * 0.9503).

Compute denominator: 0.01956 * 0.9503 ≈ 0.0186 slugs/ft³ * ft² → slugs/ft.

Wait, no, units: ρ is slugs/ft³, A is ft², so ρ*A is slugs/ft³ * ft² = slugs/ft.

So ṁ is slugs/sec, so ṁ/(ρ*A) → (slugs/sec) / (slugs/ft) ) → ft/sec.

So v1 = 6.1 / (0.01956 * 0.9503) → 6.1 / (≈0.0186) ≈ 328 ft/s.

Hmm, but the options have higher velocities, like 600-800 ft/s. So maybe I'm missing something here. Did I mess up the area?

Wait, the question says the mass flow rate is 6.1 slugs/sec. Oh wait, maybe I should compute the velocity in section 2, not section 1. Because the question is about the smaller section.

Oh right! So the velocity in section 2 is higher. Because the area is smaller.

So mass flow rate ṁ is the same in both sections, so ṁ = ρ1 A1 v1 = ρ2 A2 v2.

So v2 = (ρ1 A1 / ρ2 A2) * v1.

But I don't know ρ2 yet. Hmm.

Wait, but I need to find the pressure, velocity, density, and temperature in the smaller section. So I probably need to apply the energy equation, maybe Bernoulli's equation if the flow is incompressible. But since it's air, it's compressible, so Bernoulli might not be accurate.

Alternatively, maybe using the continuity equation and the ideal gas law along with the energy equation.

Wait, maybe the process is isothermal? But the temperature might change, so perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe frictionless and adiabatic? But the problem doesn't specify.

Hmm, perhaps I should assume that the flow is isentropic. So applying the energy equation for a streamline, considering the flow as steady, and with no heat transfer and negligible friction. So the stagnation temperature would remain constant.

Alternatively, maybe the temperature doesn't change significantly, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make an assumption that the temperature in section 2 is the same as section 1 because the problem doesn't provide any information about heat transfer or work done. But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the steady flow energy equation, which for an incompressible fluid would give certain relations, but air is compressible here.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the ideal gas law and the continuity equation, along with the momentum equation.

Wait, another approach: since it's a subsonic flow, perhaps we can use the Bernoulli equation with compressibility effects. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached using the concept of mass flow rate and the ideal gas law, along with the equation for velocity.

Wait, let me think again. For compressible flow, the mass flow rate is given by ṁ = ρ A v.

But without knowing Mach number or other factors, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure drop can be estimated using the Bernoulli equation, assuming incompressible flow, but since air is compressible, that might not be accurate.

Wait, but let's try that approach for a first approximation. The Bernoulli equation between two points would state that the sum of pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy is constant. Assuming horizontal pipe (no potential energy change), so P1 + 0.5 ρ1 v1² = P2 + 0.5 ρ2 v2².

But since the flow is compressible, density changes with pressure, so ρ2 is not equal to ρ1. So this might complicate things.

Alternatively, if I assume that the temperature is constant, which would make it isothermal. In that case, the ideal gas law becomes P1 / ρ1 = R T = P2 / ρ2 → so ρ2 = ρ1 (P2 / P1).

But without knowing P2, that doesn't help yet.

Wait, maybe I can relate velocities and densities through the continuity equation. Let's try to express everything in terms of P2.

The mass flow rate ṁ = ρ1 A1 v1 = ρ2 A2 v2.

But from ideal gas law, ρ = P/(R T). If temperature is constant, then ρ2 = (P2 / P1) ρ1.

So ṁ = (P2 / P1) ρ1 A2 v2.

But from Bernoulli equation, P1 + 0.5 ρ1 v1² = P2 + 0.5 ρ2 v2².

Substituting ρ2 = (P2 / P1) ρ1 into Bernoulli equation:

P1 + 0.5 ρ1 v1² = P2 + 0.5 (P2/P1) ρ1 v2².

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity can be found through the continuity equation and the ideal gas law.

Let me think: ṁ = ρ1 A1 v1 = ρ2 A2 v2.

But ρ1 = P1/(R T1), and ρ2 = P2/(R T2).

Assuming that the temperature doesn't change (isothermal), then T2 = T1.

So ρ2 = (P2 / P1) ρ1.

So ṁ = (P2 / P1) ρ1 A2 v2.

But from ṁ = ρ1 A1 v1, we can write v1 = ṁ / (ρ1 A1).

Similarly, v2 = ṁ / (ρ2 A2) = ṁ / ( (P2/P1 ρ1) A2 ) ) = (ṁ P1 )/( P2 ρ1 A2 ).

But ṁ = ρ1 A1 v1 → substituting into v2: v2 = (ρ1 A1 v1 * P1) / (P2 ρ1 A2 ) ) → simplifies to v2 = (A1 / A2) (P1 / P2) v1.

Hmm, but without knowing P2, this might not help yet.

Wait, perhaps using the Bernoulli equation with the isothermal assumption.

From Bernoulli: P1 + 0.5 ρ1 v1² = P2 + 0.5 ρ2 v2².

But ρ2 = (P2 / P1) ρ1.

So substituting:

P1 + 0.5 ρ1 v1² = P2 + 0.5 (P2/P1) ρ1 v2².

We can substitute v2 from the continuity equation.

From continuity equation: v2 = (ρ1 A1 / ρ2 A2 ) v1.

But since ρ2 = (P2 / P1) ρ1 → v2 = (ρ1 A1 ) / ( (P2/P1) ρ1 A2 ) ) * v1 → simplifies to v2 = (A1 P1 ) / (A2 P2 ) v1.

So v2 = (A1 / A2) (P1 / P2) v1.

Now plug this into Bernoulli equation:

P1 + 0.5 ρ1 v1² = P2 + 0.5 (P2/P1) ρ1 [ (A1/A2)(P1/P2) v1 ]^2.

Simplify the term inside the square brackets: (A1/A2)(P1/P2) v1.

So squared: (A1²/A2²) (P1²/P2²) v1².

Putting it back:

P1 + 0.5 ρ1 v1² = P2 + 0.5 (P2/P1) ρ1 (A1²/A2²) (P1²/P2²) v1².

Simplify the terms:

0.5 (P2/P1) * (A1²/A2²) (P1²/P2²) ) = 0.5 (A1²/A2²) (P1 / P2).

So the equation becomes:

P1 +
