Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the Century Shoe Company bought a machine for $1200, and they charge depreciation at 20% of the declining balance. I need to find the book value after 3 years. 

Wait, okay, I remember that declining balance depreciation is a method where you calculate depreciation each period based on the current book value. So each year, the depreciation is 20% of whatever the book value is at that time. And since it's declining, each year the depreciation amount gets smaller, right? 

So the initial cost is $1200. Let me think about how to calculate this for each year. 

Year 1: Depreciation would be 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that. 20% of 1200 is 0.2 * 1200 = $240. So the book value after year 1 would be 1200 - 240 = $960. 

Year 2: Now, the book value is $960. Depreciation is again 20% of this. So 0.2 * 960 = $192. Subtracting that from 960, the new book value is 960 - 192 = $768. 

Year 3: The book value is now $768. Depreciation is 0.2 times 768. Let me compute that: 0.2 * 768 = 153.6. So subtracting that from 768 gives 768 - 153.6 = $614.40. 

Wait, but looking at the options, $614.40 is option I. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes people make mistakes in these calculations. 

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the question is asking for the value after 3 years, which would include three depreciation periods. So each year, I correctly applied 20% on the declining balance. 

Let me recalculate each step to be sure. 

Year 1: 
Depreciation = 1200 * 0.2 = 240. 
Book value = 1200 - 240 = 960.

Year 2:
Depreciation = 960 * 0.2 = 192.
Book value = 960 - 192 = 768.

Year 3:
Depreciation = 768 * 0.2 = 153.60.
Book value = 768 - 153.60 = 614.40.

Yes, that's correct. So the book value after three years is $614.40, which is option I. 

Wait, but looking at the options again, I should make sure I didn't miss any. Let me check the options again. Option I is $614.40, so that must be the answer. 

I think that's correct. Depreciation each year is 20% of the current value, so each year's calculation depends on the prior year's book value. So after three years, it's $614.40.

To determine the book value of the machine after 3 years using the declining balance method with a depreciation rate of 20%, we calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the current book value.

1. **Year 1**:  
   - Depreciation = $1200 * 20% = $240  
   - Book value = $1200 - $240 = **$960**

2. **Year 2**:  
   - Depreciation = $960 * 20% = $192  
   - Book value = $960 - $192 = **$768**

3. **Year 3**:  
   - Depreciation = $768 * 20% = $153.60  
   - Book value = $768 - $153.60 = **$614.40**

After 3 years, the book value of the machine is **$614.40**. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

I: $614.40

**Answer: I**
