Question:

A foreign visitor was on trial for kidnapping a small child. The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?

Options:

A: Yes, the statement does not directly implicate the accused in the crime.
B: No, the statement will serve to corroborate the prosecutor's theory of the case.
C: Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.
D: Yes, the statement should be excluded because it could bias the jury.
E: Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.
F: No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.
G: Yes, the statement is hearsay and therefore inadmissible.
H: No, the statement helps establish the relationship between the accused and the child.
I: No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here about the admissibility of a statement made by the defendant. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a foreign visitor is on trial for kidnapping a child. The prosecutor says the visitor knew the child and that the child's parents had money, implying that this was a motive for the kidnapping. The prosecutor called a witness who would testify that the defendant said, "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in."

The defense objected, and we're supposed to figure out if the court will sustain that objection.

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence here. The statement is being offered as evidence against the defendant, so it's likely some form of an admission by a party opponent. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, admissions are generally admissible. Specifically, Rule 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement, so it's an admission.

So the statement here is made by the defendant. The question is whether it's relevant and whether any rules exclude it.

The prosecutor's theory is that the defendant knew the child and the parents had money. The witness's testimony is about the defendant's statement expressing looking forward to visiting and enjoying the house. This suggests that the defendant was aware of the parents' wealth, which could be a motive for kidnapping. It also shows that the defendant knew the child and the parents, which goes to the relationship.

So the statement seems relevant because it tends to make the fact that the defendant knew the child and the parents' financial situation more probable than it would be without the evidence. That's FRE 401.

Now, could there be any other issues? Maybe hearsay, but as I thought earlier, admissions by a party opponent aren't considered hearsay. So the statement is admissible as an admission.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the statement doesn't directly implicate the accused. But it does; it shows knowledge of the parents' wealth and the child, which supports the kidnapping motive. So A might not be correct.

Option B says the statement corroborates the prosecutor's theory. That makes sense because it shows the defendant's awareness of the wealth and the relationship, which are key points in the case. So B could be a reason to let the evidence in.

Option C claims it's irrelevant. But I think it's relevant because it goes to motive and relationship, which are material issues. So C is probably wrong.

Option D suggests the statement could bias the jury. I don't see how; it's more about the defendant's knowledge than anything inflammatory. So D might not be the reason.

Option E says prejudice outweighs probative value. The statement seems pretty probative because it directly relates to the elements of the crime. So E might not apply unless there's something else, but I don't see it here.

Option F says the statement can come in as impeachment if the defendant testifies and as a party admission. Well, it's a party admission, so it's admissible regardless of impeachment. So F is correct in part, but the main reason is as an admission, not just for impeachment.

Option G argues it's hearsay. But as an admission, it's not hearsay, so G is incorrect.

Option H says it helps establish the relationship. That's true, but it's more about the motive too. So H is a possible reason, but the statement's admissibility isn't just about the relationship; it's about the knowledge of wealth.

Option I says it's for impeachment and if the defendant takes the stand. Again, the primary admissibility is as a party admission, not just for impeachment.

So looking back, the statement is admissible as a party admission under 801(d)(2), which means the objection would be overruled. So the court won't sustain the objection. That means the correct answer is either B or F or H.

Wait, the options are about whether the court will sustain the objection. If the objection is overruled, the court doesn't sustain it. So the answer would be 'No, the statement is admissible.' Looking at the options, B says 'No, the statement will serve to corroborate the prosecutor's theory.' That seems right because the statement supports the theory that the defendant knew the child and the parents' wealth.

F says it's admissible as a party admission and for impeachment. But the primary reason is the admission, so F is a possible answer, but the objection is to the testimony being admitted, so the witness's statement is being offered as substantive evidence, not for impeachment. So B might be the better option.

Wait, but let me think again. The defense's objection is to the proposed testimony, meaning they're objecting on some ground. The possible grounds could be hearsay, relevance, etc. Since the statement is an admission, it's not hearsay. So the main objection would be on relevance or another ground.

The statement is relevant because it shows the defendant's knowledge and possible motive. So the objection would be overruled, meaning the court doesn't sustain it. So the answer is either B, F, or H.

Alternatively, F says it can come in as a party admission, which is correct. So the court would allow it, so the objection is overruled (answer is No, which would correspond to option B or F).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option F: No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.

So F is a correct statement of admissibility. So the court would likely overrule the objection, meaning the answer is F.

But wait, the question is whether the court will sustain the objection. So if the statement is admissible, the objection is overruled (so the answer is No, which would be options B, F, H, I). But the options are phrased as 'Will the court likely sustain the objection?' So if the answer is No, the court doesn't sustain it, so the correct options are B, F, H, I.

Looking at the options, option B says 'No, the statement will serve to corroborate the prosecutor's theory.' That's correct because it does corroborate the theory.

Option F says it's admissible as a party admission, which is correct.

So which option is the best fit? The question is about whether the objection is sustained. The defense objected, likely on hearsay or relevance grounds. Since it's an admission, hearsay objection is overruled. As for relevance, it's relevant because it shows knowledge and motive, so the objection on relevance would also be overruled.

Thus, the court will not sustain the objection, so the answer is B or F. But looking at the options, F includes that it's a party admission, which is the primary reason it's admissible.

Wait, the options are:

A: Yes, statement doesn't directly implicate.

B: No, corroborates theory.

F: No, comes in as impeachment and party admission.

So the correct answer would be either B or F. But the question is about the likely ruling.

The statement is admissible as a party admission. So the objection would be overruled, so the court doesn't sustain the objection. So the answer is either B or F.

But looking at the options, F seems to correctly state the reason for admissibility.

Wait, but the witness is testifying about the statement, which is being offered for the truth of the matterâ€”that the defendant knew the child and the parents' wealth. So it's a statement by the defendant, so it's a party admission, making it admissible under 801(d)(2). Therefore, the objection would be overruled, so the answer is 'No,' meaning the court doesn't sustain the objection.

Looking at the options, F says the statement can come in as a party admission. So F is correct.

But wait, option B says it serves to corroborate, which is also correct. So which one is the better answer.

In the context of the question, the defense's objection is likely based on hearsay or relevance. The statement is not hearsay because it's a party admission, so the objection on hearsay would fail. It's also relevant because it's about the defendant's knowledge of the parents' wealth and the child, which are central to the case.

Therefore, the correct reason is that it's a party admission, making F the correct answer. But wait, option F also mentions impeachment, which is not the main issue here because the statement is being offered substantively, not for impeachment. So perhaps B is the better answer because it's about corroborating the theory, which is a relevance point.

Alternatively, the correct reasoning is that it's an admission, so F's first part is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between B and F. Let me think again.

The witness's testimony is about the defendant's statement, which is an admission. So the objection is overruled because it's admissible under 801(d)(2). So the correct answer would be that the court doesn't sustain the objection, so the answer is 'No,' which in the options is B, F, H, or I.

Between these, the best fit is F because it correctly identifies the statement as a party admission. So the answer is F.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the defendant, which the prosecutor seeks to introduce as evidence in a kidnapping trial. The statement, "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in," is offered to establish the defendant's knowledge of the child and the parents' wealth, which supports the prosecutor's theory of motive.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the Statement**: The statement is made by the defendant and is being offered against them. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 801(d)(2)), such statements are classified as admissions by a party opponent and are not considered hearsay. This makes the statement admissible as substantive evidence.

2. **Relevance**: The statement is relevant because it tends to establish the defendant's knowledge of the child and the parents' wealth, both of which are central to the prosecutor's theory of the case. FRE 401 defines relevant evidence as that which has the tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Here, the statement satisfies this standard.

3. **Objection Grounds**: The defense's objection is likely based on hearsay or relevance. However, the statement is admissible as a party admission, and it is also relevant to the issues of guilt and motive. Therefore, the objection on these grounds would fail.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The statement directly implicates the defendant by establishing knowledge of the child and the parents' wealth, which supports the kidnapping motive.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The statement corroborates the prosecutor's theory by providing evidence of the defendant's knowledge and potential motive.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement is relevant to the issues of guilt and motive, as it speaks to the defendant's awareness of the parents' wealth and their relationship with the child.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no indication that the statement is inflammatory or prejudicial; it is probative of the defendant's knowledge and motive.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The probative value of the statement outweighs any potential prejudice, as it directly relates to the elements of the crime.
   - **Option F**: Correct. The statement is admissible as a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2) and could also be used for impeachment if the defendant testifies. However, the primary basis for admissibility is as a party admission.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The statement is not hearsay because it is an admission by the defendant.
   - **Option H**: Partially correct but incomplete. While the statement helps establish the relationship between the defendant and the child, its primary purpose is to show the defendant's knowledge of the parents' wealth and potential motive.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The statement is admissible substantively as a party admission, not merely for impeachment purposes.

### Conclusion:
The statement is admissible as a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2) and is relevant to the prosecutor's theory of the case. The defense's objection would likely be overruled. While both options B and F are correct, option F provides a more comprehensive explanation of the admissibility of the statement.
