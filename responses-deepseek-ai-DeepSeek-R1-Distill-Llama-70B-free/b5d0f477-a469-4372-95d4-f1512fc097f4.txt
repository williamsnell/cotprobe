Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about functional analysis. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking what a functional analysis is conducted to identify. The options are variables related to different terms like organismic, controlling, dependent, etc.

Wait, functional analysis is a concept from psychology, right? I remember something about operant conditioning. Oh right, functional analysis in behavioral psychology is used to understand the causes of behavior, especially problem behaviors. It's often used in applied behavior analysis (ABA) to figure out why someone is exhibiting a certain behavior.

So, the goal is to determine the function the behavior serves. Functions could be things like getting attention, escaping a task, or gaining access to something. These functions are related to the variables that influence the behavior.

In experiments, variables are categorized into independent, dependent, and extraneous. But functional analysis is more about identifying the variables that are affecting the behavior in question. Oh, right, they're looking for the variables that are controlling the behavior.

Wait, but let me think again. The independent variable is the one the researcher manipulates, and the dependent is the outcome. But functional analysis is about identifying the relationships, so perhaps it's looking for the variables that are influencing the dependent variable, which is the behavior.

Another angle: functional analysis is about identifying the function of a behavior, which usually relates to the consequences that follow the behavior. So, maybe it's looking for the dependent variables? Or is it about the independent variables that affect the dependent variable.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. In an experiment, you manipulate the independent variable to see the effect on the dependent variable. But in functional analysis, you're trying to find out what variables are influencing the behavior. So perhaps it's about identifying the independent variables that are causing changes in the behavior, which is the dependent variable.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The question is about the variables identified in the analysis. So in functional analysis, you're looking for the variables that are controlling the behavior. These would be the independent variables, but sometimes they might refer to them as controlling variables because they're controlling the occurrence of the behavior.

Alternatively, the term "controlling variables" might be a distractor. Let me think about the steps in functional analysis. They test different conditions to see what variables make the behavior happen. Like, does the behavior increase when attention is given? Then attention is a controlling variable.

So, the variables identified are the ones that control the behavior. Looking at the options, I see option B is controlling, and option I is independent, which is similar. Or is it?

Wait, the independent variable is the one the researcher manipulates. So in this case, the variables being tested (like attention, escape) are the independent variables. But the question is about what the analysis identifies. So the analysis is identifying the independent variables that affect the behavior.

Hmm, but sometimes in behavioral terms, these variables are called controlling variables because they control the behavior's occurrence.

Looking back at the options, option B is controlling. Option I is independent. So which is correct?

Wait, the question is phrased as "identify _______ variables." I think in this context, functional analysis is used to identify the variables that are influencing the behavior, which are the independent variables. Because the behavior is the dependent variable, and the functional analysis looks for what variables (like attention, escape) are causing it.

So the answer would be independent variables.

Wait, no, maybe it's more about the dependent variables. No, wait, no. Because the dependent variable is the behavior itself, and the functional analysis is looking for what's causing it, which would be the independent variables.

Wait, but in functional analysis, you're testing different variables to see which one is maintaining the behavior. So you're looking for the independent variables that serve as the function.

So the correct answer is that functional analysis identifies independent variables. So looking at the options, option I is independent, and option J is manipulated, which is similar because independent variables are manipulated.

Wait, but sometimes independent variables are called manipulated variables. So both I and J could be similar, but I think the more precise term is independent variables.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the structure of experiments. In an experiment, the researcher manipulates the independent variable and measures the dependent variable. So in functional analysis, the variables tested (attention, escape, etc.) are the independent variables because they are being manipulated to see their effect on behavior.

Therefore, the answer would be independent variables, which is option I.

But wait, sometimes functional analysis in behavioral psychology is about identifying controlling variables. I've heard the term controlling variables used in this context. So maybe the correct answer is controlling variables, option B.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of the definition. Functional analysis is a procedure to identify the variables that control behavior. So the variables are the controlling ones. Therefore, option B: controlling.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the analysis is determining which variables are in control of the behavior, hence controlling variables.

So the answer should be B: controlling.

Wait, but controlling variables are a type of independent variable. So maybe the question is considering them as controlling variables in this context.

I think I need to decide between B and I. Which is more accurate in the context of functional analysis.

In the textbook I remember, functional analysis helps identify the functional relationship, determining which variables function as reinforcers, etc. So the variables identified are the ones that control or influence the behavior, which are the controlling variables.

So the correct answer is B: controlling.

Functional analysis is a method used in behavioral psychology, particularly in applied behavior analysis (ABA), to identify the variables that influence or control behavior. The goal is to determine the function a behavior serves, such as gaining attention, escaping a task, or accessing a stimulus. These variables are often referred to as "controlling variables" because they are the factors that maintain or regulate the behavior.

In the context of functional analysis, the variables being identified are those that exert control over the behavior, making them the focus of the analysis. While these variables can be considered independent variables in an experimental context (as they are manipulated to observe their effect on behavior), the term "controlling variables" is more precise in this specific context.

Given the options provided, the most accurate term for the variables identified in a functional analysis is "controlling variables."

Answer: B
