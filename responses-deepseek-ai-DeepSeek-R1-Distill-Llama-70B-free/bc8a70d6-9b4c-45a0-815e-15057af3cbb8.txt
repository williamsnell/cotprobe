Alright, so I've got this problem here about three partners who invested different amounts in a hardware store, and I need to figure out how much Birch should get from the profits. Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the partners are Alton, Birch, and Castor. They each invested different amounts: Alton put in $4,000, Birch $5,000, and Castor $11,000. The total profit for the year is $15,000. The question says that the profits are to be shared in proportion to each man's investment. So I need to find out what proportion Birch contributed and then calculate his share of the profit.

Hmm, proportions. I think that means I have to find the ratio of each person's investment to the total investment. Then, apply that ratio to the total profit to find each person's share.

So first, let's calculate the total investment. That should be the sum of all three investments. So Alton's $4k plus Birch's $5k plus Castor's $11k. Let me add those up: 4 + 5 is 9, plus 11 makes 20. So the total investment is $20,000.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Oh, no, the amounts are in thousands, right? So 4,000 is 4k, 5k, 11k. So 4+5+11 equals 20, so the total investment is $20,000. Got it.

Now, Birch's investment is $5,000. So his proportion is 5,000 out of 20,000. Let me write that as a fraction: 5/20. Simplifying that, 5 divided by 5 is 1, and 20 divided by 5 is 4. So 1/4. So Birch's share is one fourth of the total profit.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. 5,000 divided by 20,000. Yeah, 5 divided by 20 is 0.25, which is 25%. So 25% of the profit is Birch's share.

The total profit is $15,000. So I need to find 25% of 15,000. Let me compute that. 25% is the same as a quarter. So a quarter of 15,000 is 3,750. So Birch should get $3,750.

Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Total investment is 4+5+11=20k. Birch's portion is 5k, which is 5/20, which is 1/4. 1/4 of 15k is 3.75k, which is $3,750. That seems right.

Looking at the options, option E is $3,750. So the correct answer should be E.

The total investment by Alton, Birch, and Castor is $20,000. Birch's share of the investment is $5,000, which is 25% of the total. To find Birch's share of the $15,000 profit, calculate 25% of $15,000, which equals $3,750.

Answer: E
