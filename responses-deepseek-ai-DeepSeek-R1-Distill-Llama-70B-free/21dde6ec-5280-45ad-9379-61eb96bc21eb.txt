Okay, so I've got this problem here about currency options, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what I can remember from my studies.

The problem gives me a few pieces of information:

1. The current exchange rate is 0.011 $/¥. So, that means 1 yen equals 0.011 dollars. Alternatively, 1 dollar would be 1 / 0.011 ≈ 90.909 yen. But I'm not sure if I'll need that right now.

2. There's a four-year dollar-denominated European put option on yen with a strike price of $0.008, and it sells for $0.0005. Hmm, okay. So this is a put option, which gives the holder the right to sell yen for dollars at the strike price. Since it's dollar-denominated, the option is priced in dollars, and the strike is in dollars per yen.

3. The continuously compounded risk-free interest rate on dollars is 3%. So, r_dollar = 3%, or 0.03.

4. The continuously compounded risk-free interest rate on yen is 1.5%. So, r_yen = 1.5%, or 0.015.

The question is asking for the price of a four-year yen-denominated European put option on dollars with a strike price of ¥125. So, this option is the opposite in a way—yen-denominated, so the price is in yen, and the strike is in yen per dollar. Let's try to break this down.

I remember that there's a relationship between call and put options across different currencies, often involving something called put-call parity. Also, there's something about converting between different currency denominations when dealing with options. Let me try to recall the formula or the approach.

Wait, I think the key here is to use the put-call parity for European options. But since the options are in different currencies, I might need to adjust for that. Alternatively, maybe using the Garman-Kohlhagen model which is for currency options.

Wait, the Garman-Kohlhagen model is for pricing European options on currencies. It's similar to the Black-Scholes model but adjusted for the foreign interest rate. The formula, as I remember, is for a European call option on a currency, but we can adapt it for puts as well.

But wait, the problem gives us the price of a put option, and we need to find another put option's price. So maybe it's better to think about put-call parity or some relationship that connects these two options.

Let me think: if I have a dollar-denominated put option on yen, what's its relation to a yen-denominated put option on dollars?

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the two options are related through the exchange rate. Because one is to sell yen for dollars, and the other to sell dollars for yen. Also, their strike prices are in different currencies, so I need to find a way to convert them.

Let me define some terms. Let me denote the first option as Option 1: dollar-denominated European put on yen. So, it's a put option where the underlying is yen, and the option is priced in dollars. The strike is K1 = $0.008 per yen. Option 1's price is C1 = $0.0005.

We need to find the price of Option 2: yen-denominated European put on dollars. So, the underlying is dollars, and the option is priced in yen. The strike is K2 = ¥125 per dollar.

Hmm, perhaps I can find a relationship between the prices of these two options using some formula. I remember that for European options, when you have a call on one currency, it's equivalent to a put on the other in some way, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the implied volatility from the given put option and then use that to price the other put. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for put options in the Garman-Kohlhagen model and then seeing if there's a relationship between the two options.

But wait, the given option is a put, and the one we need is also a put. But in opposite currencies. So perhaps using the put-call parity in each currency and then relating them.

Let me think about the put-call parity for a moment. For a European call and put on the same underlying, with the same strike and expiration, the relationship is:

C - P = S * e^(-r_t * T) - K * e^(-r_d * T)

Wait, no, I think in the case of currency options, the put-call parity is:

C - P = S0 * e^(-r_foreign * T) - K * e^(-r_domestic * T)

Where S0 is the spot exchange rate, r_domestic is the risk-free rate in the domestic currency (the currency in which the option is denominated), and r_foreign is the risk-free rate in the foreign currency.

Wait, in our case, for Option 1, which is a dollar-denominated put on yen, the put-call parity would involve the spot rate (S) in dollars per yen. So, for Option 1, the put price P1 is given as $0.0005.

But wait, maybe I should write the put-call parity for a dollar-denominated call on yen and a put on yen. Then, the formula would be:

C1 - P1 = S0 * e^(-r_yen * T) - K1 * e^(-r_dollar * T)

Because in the dollar-denominated option, S is dollars per yen, so the foreign currency is yen, whose risk-free rate is r_yen.

But wait, in this case, for a call option on yen (which gives the right to buy yen for dollars), the put-call parity would be:

Call price (C1) - Put price (P1) = Spot (S0) * e^(-r_foreign * T) - Strike (K1) * e^(-r_domestic * T)

Here, r_domestic is the dollar rate (3%), and r_foreign is the yen rate (1.5%).

So, rearranging, P1 = C1 - [S0 * e^(-r_yen * T) - K1 * e^(-r_dollar * T)]

But in our problem, we don't have the call price. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the given put option's price and then find the corresponding call price, and then use that to find the other option's price.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem gives me a put option in dollars, and I need a put in yen, perhaps I can find a formula that relates the two.

Another thought: the price of a European put option can be found using the Garman-Kohlhagen formula. Let me recall that formula.

The Garman-Kohlhagen formula for a European call option on a currency is:

C = S0 * e^(-r_foreign * T) * N(d1) - K * e^(-r_domestic * T) * N(d2)

And for a put option, the formula would be:

P = K * e^(-r_domestic * T) * N(-d2) - S0 * e^(-r_foreign * T) * N(-d1)

But N(-d1) is 1 - N(d1), and similarly for N(-d2), which is 1 - N(d2). So, perhaps I can write the put option formula in terms of the call option.

Wait, but maybe that's not the quickest approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the implied volatility from the given put option price and then use that volatility to compute the other put option's price.

But that might require solving for volatility, which could be complex without knowing the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates the two options directly, without needing to compute volatility.

Wait, let's think about the relationship between the dollar-denominated put on yen and the yen-denominated put on dollars.

In terms of the Black-Scholes model, the option prices are symmetric in some way. Let me think about the exchange rates. If S is the spot rate in dollars per yen, then 1/S is the spot rate in yen per dollar.

So, if I have a dollar-denominated put option on yen with strike K1 dollars per yen, and I need a yen-denominated put option on dollars with strike K2 yen per dollar, perhaps there's a way to relate these two.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the two options are, in a sense, each other's reciprocals. So, maybe their prices are related through S and the risk-free rates.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the price of a put option in one currency can be converted to the other currency using the exchange rate and adjusting for the interest rates.

Wait, let's try to model this. Let me denote:

Option 1: Dollar-denominated European put on yen, strike K1 = $0.008, price P1 = $0.0005.

Option 2: Yen-denominated European put on dollars, strike K2 = ¥125, price P2 (which we need to find).

We can think of these options as being on the same underlying but from opposite perspectives. So, perhaps using the put-call parity in each case and then linking them.

Wait, maybe the key is to find the relationship between the two put options via their respective put-call parities. Let's try that.

First, for Option 1 (dollar-denominated put on yen):

The put-call parity is C1 - P1 = S0 * e^(-r_yen * T) - K1 * e^(-r_dollar * T)

Similarly, for a yen-denominated call on dollars, the put-call parity would be C2 - P2 = (1/S0) * e^(-r_dollar * T) - K2 * e^(-r_yen * T)

Wait, because in the yen-denominated case, the spot rate would be 1/S0 (yen per dollar), the foreign interest rate would be r_dollar, and the domestic rate is r_yen.

But I'm not sure about that yet. Let me try to think through it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the two put options in terms of each other.

Another approach: The dollar-denominated put on yen gives the right to sell yen at K1 dollars per yen. The yen-denominated put on dollars gives the right to sell dollars at K2 yen per dollar. So, in a way, if you have the right to sell yen for dollars at K1, it's similar to the right to sell dollars for yen at 1/K1. So, perhaps there's a relationship between K1 and K2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in this problem, K1 is 0.008 dollars per yen, which is equivalent to 1/K1 = 125 yen per dollar. Because 1 / 0.008 is 125. Oh, wait, K2 is 125 yen per dollar. So, K2 is exactly 1/K1.

That's an important observation: K2 = 1/K1.

So, K1 = 0.008 $/¥ → 1/K1 = 125 ¥/$, which is exactly K2.

That's a key point. So, the strike prices are reciprocals of each other. That might help in relating the two options.

Now, given that, perhaps the prices of the two put options are related through the exchange rate and the discount factors from the interest rates.

Wait, perhaps we can express the price of the yen-denominated put as the price of the dollar-denominated put multiplied by the exchange rate and adjusted by the discount factors.

Alternatively, let me think about the no-arbitrage condition between the two options. If I can create a portfolio that combines the two puts and some borrowing/lending, maybe I can find a relationship between their prices.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think of the price of the yen-denominated put as the price of the dollar-denominated put converted into yen, adjusted for the interest rates.

Wait, let's consider the time value. Since the options are European and four years is a long time, the discounting factors will play a significant role.

Let me try to write the formula for the price of a European put option using the Garman-Kohlhagen model.

For a European put option on currency, the formula is:

P = K * e^(-r_domestic * T) * N(-d2) - S0 * e^(-r_foreign * T) * N(-d1)

Where d1 = [ln(S0/K) + (r_domestic - r_foreign + σ²/2) * T] / (σ * sqrt(T))

d2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)

But I'm not sure about the sign conventions here. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the put price as:

P = e^(-r_domestic * T) * [ K * N(-d2) - S0 * e^(r_foreign * T) * N(-d1) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the correct formula, but since I can't, I'll try to reconstruct it.

Wait, from what I recall, the Garman-Kohlhagen model for a call option is:

C = S0 * e^(-r_foreign * T) * N(d1) - K * e^(-r_domestic * T) * N(d2)

And for a put option, it's:

P = K * e^(-r_domestic * T) * N(-d2) - S0 * e^(-r_foreign * T) * N(-d1)

Which can also be written as:

P = e^(-r_domestic * T) * K * N(-d2) - e^(-r_foreign * T) * S0 * N(-d1)

But since N(-d2) = 1 - N(d2) and N(-d1) = 1 - N(d1), the put formula can also be expressed in terms of the call.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the put price in terms of the call price.

But in any case, perhaps I can use the given put price to find the implied volatility and then use that same volatility to compute the other put option's price.

Wait, that might be a way to proceed. So first, let's compute the implied volatility from the given dollar-denominated put option on yen. Then, use that same volatility to compute the yen-denominated put on dollars.

But I'm not sure if the volatility would be the same, because volatility is usually quoted in terms of the exchange rate. So, the volatility of yen per dollar is the same as dollars per yen, just the quote is reciprocal.

Wait, no, volatility is in terms of the exchange rate, so the volatility for dollars per yen would be the same as for yen per dollar. So, if I compute σ from the first option, I can use it for the second.

Okay, so let's proceed. First, compute the implied volatility σ from Option 1.

Option 1 is a dollar-denominated European put on yen. So, using the put formula.

The formula for a European put is:

P = K * e^(-r_d * T) * N(-d2) - S0 * e^(-r_f * T) * N(-d1)

Where:
- P is the put price
- K is the strike price
- r_d is the domestic risk-free rate (dollar, 3%)
- r_f is the foreign risk-free rate (yen, 1.5%)
- T is the time to expiration in years
- S0 is the current spot exchange rate (dollars per yen, 0.011)
- d1 and d2 are the usual terms.

But wait, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Let me make sure I have the correct formula for a put option. Let me think of it as the price to sell the foreign currency (yen) for domestic (dollars) at K.

Wait, another approach: Let me use the Black-Scholes formula for puts, adapted for currency options.

The formula for a put option on a currency (yen) in terms of dollars is:

P = K * e^(-r_d * T) * N(-d2) - S0 * e^(-r_f * T) * N(-d1)

Where:
- d1 = [ln(S0/K) + (r_d - r_f + σ²/2) * T] / (σ * sqrt(T))
- d2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)

So, given that, we can solve for σ using the given P, S0, K, r_d, r_f, and T.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated because it involves solving for σ in a non-linear equation. However, since this is a thought process, perhaps I can proceed by making an assumption or finding a way around.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between the two put options that doesn't require knowing σ.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me consider the two options:

Option 1: Put on yen, dollar-denominated, strike K1 = 0.008, price P1 = 0.0005.

Option 2: Put on dollars, yen-denominated, strike K2 = 125, which is 1/K1, price P2 is what we need to find.

Since K2 = 1/K1, perhaps P2 can be expressed in terms of P1, scaled by S0 and the discount factors.

Wait, let's consider the put-call parity for each option.

For Option 1 (dollar-denominated put on yen):

P1 = C1 - [ S0 * e^(-r_f * T) - K1 * e^(-r_d * T) ]

Wait, no, the put-call parity is C - P = S0 * e^(-r_f * T) - K1 * e^(-r_d * T)

So, rearranged, P1 = C1 - [ S0 * e^(-r_f * T) - K1 * e^(-r_d * T) ]

But without knowing C1, the call price, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the put price in terms of the call price.

Wait, but maybe I can do the same for Option 2 and then find a relationship between the two.

For Option 2 (yen-denominated put on dollars):

P2 = C2 - [ (1/S0) * e^(-r_d * T) - K2 * e^(-r_f * T) ]

Because in yen terms, the spot rate is 1/S0 (yen per dollar), the foreign rate is r_d (dollar's risk-free rate), and the domestic rate is r_f (yen's risk-free rate).

But again, without knowing C2, the call price in yen terms, it's not helpful. So perhaps this approach isn't the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the two put options without involving the call options. Let me think about the exchange rates.

Let
