Okay, so I have this question about Hart and Fuller's arguments regarding Nazi law. Hmm, I remember that Hart and Fuller were legal philosophers who had a debate about the validity of law, especially in the context of the Nazi regime. 

From what I recall, Fuller was a proponent of the idea that law has an internal morality. He argued that even if a law is enacted properly, if it fails to meet certain moral standards, it isn't really a law. So in the case of Nazi laws, which were morally reprehensible, Fuller would say they aren't valid laws because they don't adhere to the principles of legality, like being prospective, clear, etc.

On the other hand, Hart was a legal positivist. Legal positivists believe that the validity of a law depends on its sources, like whether it was enacted according to the established procedures and rules of recognition of a society. So for Hart, the question isn't about the moral content but about whether the law was created following the correct procedures.

So the question is asking what Hart's response was to Fuller's argument that Nazi law was invalid. Fuller probably argued that Nazi laws were invalid because they were immoral or didn't meet certain moral criteria. But Hart, being a positivist, would counter that the validity is based on the rule of recognition, not moral judgment.

Wait, I think Hart said that even though Nazi laws were morally bad, they were still laws because they were enacted according to the then-prevailing rule of recognition in Germany. So Hart would not agree with Fuller's argument that the laws were invalid just because they were immoral. Instead, Hart would focus on the social facts of how the laws were created and recognized.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Hart agreed with Fuller. That doesn't seem right because their positions are opposed. 

Option H: Hart contended Fuller's argument was irrelevant to the validity. That sounds possible because for Hart, validity is about the rule of recognition, not moral content.

Option J: Hart suggested the Nazi law wasn't truly a law. No, that would align more with Fuller's view, not Hart's.

Option A: The law was validly enacted. That might be Hart's position because he'd say it's valid if it followed the rules, regardless of its content.

Wait, but the question is about Hart's response to Fuller's specific argument. Fuller's argument was that Nazi law was invalid because it didn't meet moral criteria. So Hart would respond by saying validity isn't about morality but about the rule of recognition.

So looking at the options, perhaps H is correct because Hart would say Fuller's moral arguments don't affect the law's validity. Alternatively, option A might be correct if Hart is asserting the law's validity based on proper enactment.

Wait, another angle: Hart's position is that the law's validity depends on the rule of recognition. So if the Nazi law was recognized as law by the officials, then it's valid, regardless of its content. So Hart wouldn't say the law is invalid just because it's immoral; he'd say it's a law but a bad one.

So when Fuller argues it's invalid, Hart's response would be that Fuller's argument (about morality) doesn't determine validity. So option H says Hart contended Fuller's argument was irrelevant to validity. That fits because Hart would say validity is about the rule of recognition, not moral judgments.

Alternatively, looking at the actual exchange, I think Hart's response was that Fuller's criteria (like generality, prospectivity) are about the 'inner morality of law', but Hart argued that these are not necessarily part of the definition of law. So Hart might have said that Fuller's argument doesn't make the law invalid in terms of legal positivism.

So the correct answer would be H: Hart contended Fuller's argument was irrelevant to the validity of the law.

Hart, as a legal positivist, argued that the validity of a law depends on its sources and whether it was enacted according to the established procedures and rules of recognition in a society, rather than its moral content. Fuller, in contrast, believed that law must adhere to certain moral principles to be considered valid. When responding to Fuller's argument that Nazi law was invalid due to its moral failings, Hart contended that Fuller's focus on morality was irrelevant to the question of legal validity. For Hart, the validity of Nazi law was determined by whether it conformed to the prevailing rule of recognition at the time, not by its moral worth. Therefore, Hart's response emphasized that Fuller's moral arguments did not affect the legal validity of the law.

The correct answer is H.
