Okay, so I've got this question about the solid-state structures of the principal allotropes of elemental boron. Hmm, I remember that allotropes are different structural forms of the same element. Like how carbon has graphite, diamond, and graphene.

The question is asking about the structural units in their solid-state structures. The options are various boron polygons and polyhedrons, like B5 pentagons, B10 decagons, B12 icosahedra, etc.

Wait, I think I've heard that boron has a complex structure. I remember something about icosahedra being involved. Boron's allotropes, like the alpha and beta forms, have these unique structures. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Oh right, I think the structure involves icosahedrons. So, icosahedra are 20-faced polyhedrons, right? Each face is a triangle, but in this case, each "face" is a boron atom. So each boron atom is part of an icosahedron.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: there's also some kind of bridging between these icosahedra. Like, maybe some atoms connecting them. Oh, but the question is about the principal structural units, so the main building blocks.

Icosahedra would mean B12 units, since each icosahedron has 12 vertices. Wait no, each icosahedron has 12 vertices, but each vertex is a boron atom. So each icosahedron is a B12 unit.

Looking at the options, option I is B12 icosahedra. That must be the answer. Because I remember that boron's structure is based on B12 icosahedra linked together with other structures, perhaps some tetrahedra or something else.

Wait, but another option is B4 tetrahedra. So maybe some tetrahedral units are involved. Or maybe B3 triangles? But I think the key structural unit is the icosahedron.

So the solid-state structures of boron allotropes are made up of B12 icosahedra as their main structural units. So the correct answer is I.

The solid-state structures of the principal allotropes of elemental boron are based on a unique arrangement of boron atoms. Among the options provided, the key structural unit is the B12 icosahedron. This is because boron's allotropes, such as alpha-boron and beta-boron, are known to form complex structures where B12 icosahedra serve as the primary building blocks. These icosahedra are interconnected, often with additional boron atoms bridging between them, but the principal structural unit is the B12 icosahedron. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: B12 icosahedra

Answer: I
