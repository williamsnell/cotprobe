Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: 0.001 mol of NaOH is added to 100 ml of a solution that's 0.5 M HC2H3O2 (acetic acid) and 0.5 M NaC2H3O2 (sodium acetate). I need to find the pH of this solution. The Kd (I think that's the dissociation constant) for acetic acid is given as 1.8 × 10^-5.

Hmm, right. So this is a buffer solution problem because we have a weak acid (acetic acid) and its conjugate base (acetate ion from sodium acetate). When you add a strong base like NaOH to this, it should react with the acetic acid.

Wait, buffer solutions use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). But first, I need to figure out the new concentrations after adding NaOH.

So, the initial solution is 100 ml, which is 0.1 liters. The concentrations are both 0.5 M for acetic acid and sodium acetate. So, moles of each initially are:

Moles of HC2H3O2 = 0.5 M * 0.1 L = 0.05 mol.
Moles of NaC2H3O2 = 0.5 M * 0.1 L = 0.05 mol.

Then, we add 0.001 mol of NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely, providing OH- ions. But in the solution, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. The reaction should be:

OH- + HC2H3O2 → C2H3O2^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- will convert a mole of HC2H3O2 into C2H3O2^-.

So, the moles after reaction:

HC2H3O2: 0.05 mol - 0.001 mol = 0.049 mol.
C2H3O2^-: 0.05 mol + 0.001 mol = 0.051 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. The solution's volume is still approximately 100 ml, I think, because adding 0.001 mol of NaOH in solution probably doesn't change the volume much. So, the concentrations would be:

[HC2H3O2] = 0.049 / 0.1 = 0.49 M.
[C2H3O2^-] = 0.051 / 0.1 = 0.51 M.

Now, using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. First, find pKa.

Ka is given as 1.8e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.8e-5)) wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka).

So pKa = -log(1.8e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.8) is around 0.2553. So log(1.8e-5) is 0.2553 -5 = -4.7447. So pKa is 4.7447, approximately 4.74.

Then, plug into Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.7447 + log(0.51 / 0.49).

What's 0.51 divided by 0.49? Let me compute that. 0.51/0.49 ≈ 1.0408.

Log(1.0408) is approximately 0.017. So pH ≈ 4.7447 + 0.017 ≈ 4.7617.

Looking at the options, I see E is 4.76, which is very close. But wait, did I make any mistakes?

Let me double-check. The moles: 0.001 mol NaOH added to 0.05 mol acetic acid. So 0.05 -0.001 =0.049, and 0.05 +0.001=0.051. Yes.

Concentration is correct, 0.049/0.1 and 0.051/0.1. So [A-]/[HA] is 0.51/0.49 ≈ 1.0408. Log of that is about 0.017.

pKa is about 4.74, so 4.74 + 0.017 is 4.757, which rounds to 4.76. So option E is 4.76.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute log(1.0408) more accurately.

Using a calculator approach: log(1.04) is about 0.0170. Log(1.0408)= let's see, 1.0408 is 1 + 0.0408. The log can be approximated using the formula log(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3..., but that's for small x. Alternatively, log(1.04)=0.01703, and since 0.0408 is a bit higher than 0.04, maybe 0.0172 or so. So 0.017 is a good enough approximation.

Alternatively, exact calculation using natural logs? Hmm, perhaps not necessary. So the pH comes to about 4.76, which matches option E.

Wait another thing. Sometimes when you add a strong base to a buffer, you can also consider whether all the base is consumed by the acid. In this case, since we have 0.001 mol of NaOH and 0.05 mol of acetic acid, the OH- will all react (as 0.001 <0.05), so that's correct. No excess OH- left, so no need to consider a different case.

Alternatively, if the NaOH were more than the acetic acid, you'd have excess OH-, but that's not the case here.

So the calculation seems solid. Therefore, the correct answer is E, 4.76.

To determine the pH of the solution, we start by recognizing that this is a buffer solution containing acetic acid (HC₂H₃O₂) and its conjugate base (C₂H₃O₂⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer solutions:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate initial moles of HC₂H₃O₂ and C₂H₃O₂⁻
The solution volume is 100 mL (0.1 L), and the initial concentrations of HC₂H₃O₂ and NaC₂H₃O₂ are both 0.5 M. Thus, the initial moles are:

\[
\text{Moles of HC₂H₃O₂} = 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.1 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of C₂H₃O₂⁻} = 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.1 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Account for the reaction with NaOH
Adding 0.001 mol of NaOH introduces OH⁻ ions, which react with HC₂H₃O₂ to form C₂H₃O₂⁻:

\[
\text{OH}^- + \text{HC₂H₃O₂} \rightarrow \text{C₂H₃O₂}^- + \text{H₂O}
\]

After the reaction:
- Moles of HC₂H₃O₂ decrease by 0.001 mol:  
\[
0.05 \, \text{mol} - 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.049 \, \text{mol}
\]
- Moles of C₂H₃O₂⁻ increase by 0.001 mol:  
\[
0.05 \, \text{mol} + 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.051 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate new concentrations
The total volume remains approximately 100 mL (0.1 L). Thus, the new concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HC₂H₃O₂}] = \frac{0.049 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 0.49 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{C₂H₃O₂}^-] = \frac{0.051 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 0.51 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The dissociation constant of acetic acid is given as \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \). First, calculate \( \text{pKa} \):

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a) = -\log(1.8 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.74
\]

Next, calculate the ratio \(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\):

\[
\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = \frac{0.51}{0.49} \approx 1.0408
\]

Now, calculate \(\log(1.0408)\):

\[
\log(1.0408) \approx 0.017
\]

Substitute into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.74 + 0.017 = 4.757 \, (\text{approximately } 4.76)
\]

### Step 5: Verify the answer
The calculated pH of 4.76 matches option E. The assumptions are consistent: the reaction of NaOH with HC₂H₃O₂ is complete, and the buffer solution remains valid.
