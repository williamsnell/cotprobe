Question:

We are training fully connected network with two hidden layers to predict housing prices. Inputs are $100$-dimensional, and have several features such as the number of square feet, the median family income, etc. The first hidden layer has $1000$ activations. The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?

Options:

A: 120010
B: 111110
C: 100121
D: 112110
E: 110010
F: 110020
G: 122121
H: 110011
I: 111021
J: 130021

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the number of parameters in a fully connected neural network. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I remember that in a fully connected network, each layer's parameters are determined by the number of weights and biases. 

The network has two hidden layers. The input is 100-dimensional, which means the input layer has 100 neurons. The first hidden layer has 1000 activations, so that's 1000 neurons there. The second hidden layer has 10 neurons. The output is a single scalar, so the output layer has 1 neuron.

To find the total parameters, I need to calculate the weights and biases for each layer. 

Starting with the first layer: it's between the input (100) and the first hidden layer (1000). Each of the 1000 neurons in the first hidden layer gets its own set of weights from the input. So the number of weights here is 100 (input features) multiplied by 1000 (hidden neurons). That's 100 * 1000 = 100,000 weights. Then each neuron also has a bias term, so that's another 1000 biases. So total parameters for the first layer are 100,000 + 1000 = 101,000.

Next, the second layer connects the first hidden (1000) to the second hidden (10). So each of the 10 neurons here has 1000 weights coming in. So that's 1000 * 10 = 10,000 weights. And each of the 10 neurons has a bias, adding 10 more. So the second layer contributes 10,000 + 10 = 10,010 parameters.

Then the output layer: it's connected from the second hidden (10) to the output (1). So each output neuron (just one here) has 10 weights. So 10 * 1 = 10 weights. And one bias term for the output neuron. So that's 10 + 1 = 11 parameters.

Now, adding all these up: first layer is 101,000, second is 10,010, output is 11. Total parameters would be 101,000 + 10,010 = 111,010, then plus 11 gives 111,021.

Wait, let me double-check that. So 100*1000 = 100,000, plus 1000 is 101,000. Then 1000*10=10,000, plus 10 is 10,010. 10*1=10, plus 1 is 11. Adding them together: 101,000 +10,010 is 111,010; adding 11 gives 111,021.

Looking at the options, option I is 111021. So that must be the correct answer.

To calculate the total number of parameters in the fully connected neural network, we sum the weights and biases for each layer:

1. **First hidden layer (100 input features → 1000 neurons):**  
   - Weights: \(100 \times 1000 = 100,000\)  
   - Biases: \(1000\)  
   - Total: \(100,000 + 1000 = 101,000\)

2. **Second hidden layer (1000 neurons → 10 neurons):**  
   - Weights: \(1000 \times 10 = 10,000\)  
   - Biases: \(10\)  
   - Total: \(10,000 + 10 = 10,010\)

3. **Output layer (10 neurons → 1 neuron):**  
   - Weights: \(10 \times 1 = 10\)  
   - Biases: \(1\)  
   - Total: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

Adding all the parameters together:  
\[
101,000 + 10,010 + 11 = 111,021
\]

The correct answer is **I: 111021**.
