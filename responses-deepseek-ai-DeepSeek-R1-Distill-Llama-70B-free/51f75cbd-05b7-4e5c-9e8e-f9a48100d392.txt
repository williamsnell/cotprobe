Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the x distance of the top of a hill. The equation given is z equals a bunch of terms with x and y. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with equations like this, especially for finding maxima or minima, calculus comes into play. Oh right, we're probably looking for critical points here because the top of the hill would be a maximum point.

So the equation is z = 2xy -3x² -4y² -18x +28y +12. I think to find the maximum, I need to take the partial derivatives with respect to x and y and set them to zero. Because at the maximum point, the slope in all directions is zero.

Let's start with the partial derivative with respect to x. So, treating y as a constant. The derivative of 2xy with respect to x is 2y. Then the derivative of -3x² is -6x. The derivative of -4y² with respect to x is zero because it's treated as a constant. Similarly, the derivative of -18x is -18. The other terms (28y and 12) are constants and their derivatives are zero.

So putting that together, the partial derivative ∂z/∂x should be 2y -6x -18.

Now for the partial derivative with respect to y. Again, treating x as a constant. The derivative of 2xy is 2x. Then the derivative of -4y² is -8y. The derivative of 28y is 28. The rest are constants or terms without y, so their derivatives are zero.

So ∂z/∂y = 2x -8y +28.

To find the critical points, I set both of these partial derivatives equal to zero.

So now we have a system of equations:

1) 2y -6x -18 = 0
2) 2x -8y +28 = 0

Hmm, let's simplify these equations. Maybe I can solve them using substitution or elimination.

First equation: 2y = 6x +18. Dividing both sides by 2 gives y = 3x +9.

Second equation: 2x -8y = -28. Let me substitute y from the first equation into the second.

So substituting y=3x+9 into the second equation:

2x -8*(3x +9) = -28.

Let me expand that: 2x -24x -72 = -28.

Combining like terms: (2x -24x) is -22x, so -22x -72 = -28.

Adding 72 to both sides: -22x = 44.

Divide both sides by -22: x = 44 / (-22) → x = -2.

Wait, that gives x as -2. But looking at the options, G is -2m. So that's the x distance. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I don't want to make a mistake.

Let me go through the substitution again.

Equation 1: y = 3x +9.

Equation 2: 2x -8y = -28.

Substitute y:

2x -8*(3x +9) = -28.

Compute inside: 2x -24x -72 = -28.

Combine terms: (2x -24x) is -22x, so -22x -72 = -28.

Adding 72 to both sides: -22x = 44.

So x = 44 / (-22) = -2. Yep, that's correct.

So the x distance is -2 meters. Looking at the options, option G is -2m.

Wait, but the question asks for the x distance. So negative x would mean west direction? But the problem says x is the distance east. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "x is the distance east" and "y is the distance north". So x can be negative, indicating west, but the question is about the x distance, so the magnitude would be 2 meters west. But the question just asks for the x distance, so the answer is -2 meters, which is option G.

To determine the $x$ distance of the top of the hill, we start with the given height function:

\[
z = 2xy - 3x^2 - 4y^2 - 18x + 28y + 12
\]

The top of the hill corresponds to a critical point of this function, where the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero. First, we compute the partial derivatives:

1. Partial derivative with respect to $x$:
\[
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 2y - 6x - 18
\]

2. Partial derivative with respect to $y$:
\[
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2x - 8y + 28
\]

Setting these equal to zero gives the system of equations:

1. \( 2y - 6x - 18 = 0 \)
2. \( 2x - 8y + 28 = 0 \)

Simplifying the first equation:
\[
2y = 6x + 18 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 3x + 9
\]

Substituting \( y = 3x + 9 \) into the second equation:
\[
2x - 8(3x + 9) = -28
\]
\[
2x - 24x - 72 = -28
\]
\[
-22x - 72 = -28
\]
\[
-22x = 44 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]

Thus, the $x$ distance of the top of the hill is $-2$ meters. Since $x$ represents the distance east, a negative value indicates the direction is west. However, the question specifically asks for the $x$ distance, so the answer is $-2$ meters.

The correct option is:

**G: -2m**
