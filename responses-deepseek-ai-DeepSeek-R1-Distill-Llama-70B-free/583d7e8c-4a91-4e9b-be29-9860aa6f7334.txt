Okay, so I've got this question about when the first day of spring is in the United States. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact date, but I remember it's around March. Let me think... I know that seasons are determined by the Earth's tilt and its orbit around the sun. The spring equinox is when day and night are roughly equal in length.

Wait, I think the equinoxes mark the start of spring and autumn. So the vernal equinox is the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Now, when does that happen? I recall it's either March 20 or March 21. Does it vary each year?

I've heard that sometimes it can be on the 20th and sometimes the 21st because of the Earth's elliptical orbit and leap years affecting the exact timing. But traditionally, I think March 21st is often cited as the first day of spring. Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options: option F is 21-Mar, and option D is 30-Mar. Option A is 15-Mar, which seems too early. I'm pretty sure it's not in April or May, so options B, C, E, G, H, I, and J are out. That leaves F and D. Wait, but I'm more certain it's around the 20th or 21st. So 21-Mar must be the correct answer.

I think in the US, they probably go with March 21st as the official start. So the answer should be F.

Answer: F
