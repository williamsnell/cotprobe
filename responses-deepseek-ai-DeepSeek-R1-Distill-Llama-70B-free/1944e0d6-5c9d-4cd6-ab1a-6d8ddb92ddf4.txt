Okay, so I've got this problem about a cylindrical pressure vessel. Hmm, I remember that for thin-walled pressure vessels, there are standard formulas to calculate the stress. But wait, I think this is a thick-walled vessel because the radius is given as 15 inches, but maybe I'm wrong. No, wait, the formula I'm thinking of is for thin-walled cylinders where the radius is much larger than the thickness. So maybe it's thin-walled here.

The problem gives the mean radius as 15 inches. The internal pressure is 3500 psi. Oh, and the efficiency of the welded connections is 78%. The material has a yield strength of 12e4 psi, which is 120,000 psi. The factor of safety is 1.5, so I need to calculate the thickness.

Wait, the formula for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder is sigma = (p * r) / (2 * t), where p is pressure, r is radius, t is thickness. But wait, if I'm considering efficiency, maybe the formula adjusts for that. Oh right, sometimes the allowable stress is calculated with efficiency and safety factors.

Efficiency (η) is the ratio of the strength of the welded joint to the strength of the base material. So the allowable stress would be (η * sigma_y) / factor of safety.

Wait, no, the yield strength is the material's property. So the maximum allowable stress is sigma_allow = sigma_y / (factor of safety). But with efficiency, I think the formula incorporates the efficiency because the welded joints are weaker. So maybe sigma_allow = (η * sigma_y) / FOS.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sigma = (p * r) / (2 * t * η), and then I have to apply the factor of safety on top. Or maybe the allowable stress is sigma_allow = sigma_y / FOS, and that's what we use in the formula.

Wait, let me think. The hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder is (p r)/(2 t). But when considering weld efficiency, I think the formula becomes (p r)/(2 t η). Or is it (p r η)/(2 t)? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the basic formula is sigma = (p r)/(2 t), but because the welds are only 78% efficient, the effective stress is higher. So perhaps the allowable stress is sigma_allow = (eta * sigma_y) / FOS.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine the maximum allowable stress (sigma_allow). This should be the yield strength divided by the factor of safety. But also considering the weld efficiency. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The design formula for a cylindrical vessel considering weld efficiency is sigma = (p r)/(2 t η). So then we can solve for t.

But what's the allowable stress here? Oh, because the material can only handle up to sigma_y, but we have a factor of safety. So the maximum allowable stress is sigma_allow = sigma_y / FOS.

So putting it all together:

sigma_allow = (p r) / (2 t η)

Wait, no, that's the stress. So sigma_allow is the maximum stress allowed, which is sigma_y / FOS.

So:

sigma_allow = sigma_y / FOS

But also, the stress from pressure is (p r)/(2 t η)

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try again.

The stress in the wall due to pressure is (p * r) / (2 t). But because the welds are not 100% efficient, the effective thickness is reduced. Or perhaps the stress is increased. So the formula including efficiency becomes (p r) / (2 t η) ? Or maybe (p r η) / (2 t) ?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula when considering weld efficiency is:

sigma = (p r) / (2 t η)

So that's the stress. And this should be less than or equal to sigma_allow, which is sigma_y / FOS.

So setting them equal:

(p r) / (2 t η) = sigma_y / FOS

Then solving for t:

t = (p r FOS) / (2 η sigma_y )

Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange:

t = (p r ) / (2 sigma_allow η )

Wait, no, let me do it step by step.

We have sigma = (p r) / (2 t η) = sigma_allow = sigma_y / FOS

So (p r) / (2 t η) = sigma_y / FOS

Multiply both sides by 2 t η:

p r = (2 t η sigma_y ) / FOS

Then solve for t:

t = (p r FOS) / (2 η sigma_y )

Wait, no:

Wait, from the equation:

(p r) / (2 t η) = sigma_y / FOS

Multiply both sides by 2 t η:

p r = (2 t η sigma_y ) / FOS

Then, solve for t:

t = (p r FOS) / (2 η sigma_y )

Wait, does that make sense? Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

p = 3500 psi

r = 15 inches

FOS = 1.5

η = 0.78 (78% efficiency)

sigma_y = 12e4 psi = 120,000 psi

So plugging in:

t = (3500 * 15 * 1.5) / (2 * 0.78 * 120000 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 3500 *15 = 52,500. 52,500 * 1.5 = 78,750.

Denominator: 2 * 0.78 = 1.56. 1.56 * 120,000 = 187,200.

So t = 78,750 / 187,200.

Let me compute that. 78,750 ÷ 187,200 ≈ 0.4205 inches. Wait, but that's not any of the options. The options are from 0.55 to 1.25 inches.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the formula is sigma = (p r) / (2 t). But the allowable stress is (η sigma_y) / FOS.

Wait, no. Another thought: The allowable stress is sigma_allow = (η * sigma_y) / FOS.

So:

sigma = (p r) / (2 t) = sigma_allow = (η * sigma_y) / FOS

So (p r)/(2 t) = (η sigma_y) / FOS

Then solving for t:

t = (p r FOS) / (2 η sigma_y )

Wait, that's the same formula as before. So plugging in again:

t = (3500 *15 *1.5) / (2 *0.78 *120000 )

Which is 3500*15=52500, 52500*1.5=78750.

Denominator: 2*0.78=1.56, 1.56*120000=187200.

So 78750 / 187200 = approximately 0.4205 inches. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula doesn't include efficiency in the denominator. Maybe the correct formula is sigma = (p r) / (2 t), and the allowable stress is (η sigma_y)/FOS.

So then:

(p r)/(2 t) = (η sigma_y)/FOS

So t = (p r FOS) / (2 η sigma_y )

Wait, same as before. So same result. So that gives 0.42 inches, but that's not among the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the vessel is thick-walled, so I should use the thick-walled formula instead. But for a thick-walled cylinder, the hoop stress is given by sigma = (p (r^2 - t^2)) / (2 t r). Wait, no, maybe that's for spherical vessels. Or perhaps the thin-walled approximation isn't valid here.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for thin-walled is sigma = (p r)/(2 t). For a thick-walled cylinder, the maximum hoop stress is (p R^2) / (2 t (R - t)), approximately, assuming R >> t. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the confusion is about whether to use inside radius or mean radius. Wait, the problem says mean radius is 15 inches. So for thin-walled, r is the mean radius, so t is small compared to r.

Hmm, but why am I getting a value that's not among the options. Let me recalculate the numbers.

Wait, let's compute it again:

t = (3500 *15 *1.5) / (2 *0.78 *120000 )

Compute numerator: 3500 *15 = 52,500. 52,500 *1.5 =78,750.

Denominator: 2 *0.78=1.56. 1.56 *120,000=187,200.

So 78,750 /187,200 = 0.4205 inches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula without the efficiency in the stress equation. Like, maybe the formula is sigma = (p r)/(2 t), and the allowable stress is sigma_allow = sigma_y * efficiency / FOS.

So:

sigma = (p r)/(2 t) <= sigma_allow = (sigma_y * η) / FOS

So:

t = (p r FOS) / (2 sigma_y η )

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So same result.

But the options don't have 0.42. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternative approach: Maybe the formula includes the efficiency as a multiplier in the denominator. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is t = (p r) / (2 sigma_allow η )

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sigma = (p r)/(2 t η), so solving for t gives t = (p r)/(2 sigma_allow η )

Wait, let me try that.

So sigma_allow = sigma_y / FOS = 120000 /1.5 =80,000 psi.

So sigma_allow is 80,000 psi.

So sigma = (p r)/(2 t η) = 3500 *15 / (2 t *0.78 )

Set equal to 80,000:

3500 *15 / (2 t *0.78 ) =80,000

Multiply both sides by denominator:

3500 *15 =80,000 *2 t *0.78

Compute left side: 3500 *15 =52,500.

Right side:80,000 *2=160,000. 160,000 *0.78=124,800.

So 52,500 =124,800 t

t=52,500 /124,800 ≈ 0.4205 inches. Same result again.

Still not matching the options. So perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong. Maybe the efficiency isn't in the stress formula but is applied elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sigma = (p r)/(2 t), and the allowable stress is (η sigma_y)/FOS.

So sigma_allow = (0.78 *120,000)/1.5= (93,600)/1.5=62,400 psi.

So sigma = (3500 *15)/(2 t) =5250/(2 t) =2625/t.

Set equal to 62,400:

2625/t =62,400

t=2625/62400 ≈0.042 inches. That can't be right.

Wait, that gives 0.042, which is way too small. So perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Let me check another source. Oh wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The allowable stress is sigma_allow = (eta * sigma_y) / FOS.

The hoop stress is sigma = (p r)/(2 t).

Set sigma <= sigma_allow.

So:

(p r)/(2 t) = (eta sigma_y) / FOS

So t = (p r FOS) / (2 eta sigma_y )

Which is the same as before.

So t = (3500 *15 *1.5) / (2 *0.78 *120000 )

Which is 78750 / (187200) = approximately 0.4205 inches.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the radius is the inside radius, not the mean radius. Wait, no, the problem says mean radius is 15 inches. But perhaps the formula uses the inside radius. But in thin-walled, mean radius is approximately the same as inside radius if t is small.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the actual stress is higher due to the efficiency. Wait, maybe the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Another approach: Maybe the formula to find the thickness is t = (p d)/(2 S), where S is the allowable stress, and d is the diameter.

Wait, but then considering efficiency, maybe S is (eta * sigma_y)/FOS.

So d is 2*r =30 inches.

So t = (3500 *30) / (2 * (0.78 *120000 /1.5) )

Wait, let me compute S first.

S = (eta * sigma_y)/FOS = (0.78 *120000) /1.5 = (93600)/1.5=62,400 psi.

So t = (3500 *30) / (2 *62400 ) = (105000) / (124800 ) ≈ 0.842 inches.

Wait, that's approximately 0.842. Looking at the options, I see option D is 0.84 in. So that's close.

So that would be option D.

Wait, but why did I change the formula? Because earlier I used radius, now I'm using diameter. Let me check.

Because in the thin-walled formula, hoop stress is sigma = (p r)/(t). So r is radius.

But I've seen another formula where sigma = (p d)/(2 t), so d is diameter. Oh wait, because r is diameter/2, so (p*(d/2)) / t = pd/(2t), which is same as before.

So in the formula, t = (p d)/(2 S). So perhaps I should have used diameter.

Wait, let me recompute this way.

t = (p d) / (2 S )

Where p=3500 psi, d=30 inches (since r=15), and S is (eta * sigma_y)/FOS.

So S= (0.78 *120000)/1.5=62,400 psi.

t= (3500 *30) / (2 *62400 )

Calculate numerator: 3500 *30=105,000.

Denominator: 2*62400=124,800.

So t=105,000 /124,800 ≈0.842 inches. So that's approximately 0.84 inches, which is option D.

Ah! So perhaps the mistake earlier was not using the diameter but the radius. So the correct formula uses diameter in the numerator.

Wait, but wait. The thin-walled formula is sigma = (p r)/t. So if I use diameter, I have to adjust. Because sigma = (p d)/(2 t), which comes from substituting r= d/2.

So when I set up the equation as t=(p d)/(2 S), that's correct.

So yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is approximately 0.84 inches, which is option D.

To calculate the thickness of the cylindrical pressure vessel, we use the thin-walled pressure vessel formula for hoop stress:

\[
\sigma = \frac{p r}{t}
\]

where:
- \( p \) is the internal pressure (\( 3500 \, \text{psi} \)),
- \( r \) is the mean radius (\( 15 \, \text{in} \)),
- \( t \) is the thickness of the vessel,
- \( \sigma \) is the hoop stress.

The allowable stress (\( \sigma_{\text{allow}} \)) is determined by considering the yield strength (\( \sigma_y = 120,000 \, \text{psi} \)), the factor of safety (\( \text{FOS} = 1.5 \)), and the weld efficiency (\( \eta = 0.78 \)):

\[
\sigma_{\text{allow}} = \frac{\eta \sigma_y}{\text{FOS}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\sigma_{\text{allow}} = \frac{0.78 \times 120,000}{1.5} = 62,400 \, \text{psi}
\]

The hoop stress equation can now be rearranged to solve for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{p r}{\sigma_{\text{allow}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{3500 \times 15}{62,400}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
3500 \times 15 = 52,500
\]

Then, divide by the denominator:

\[
t = \frac{52,500}{62,400} \approx 0.84 \, \text{in}
\]

Thus, the thickness of the vessel is approximately \( 0.84 \, \text{in} \), which corresponds to option D.
