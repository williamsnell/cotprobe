Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electroplating or something. Let me read it carefully. The question says that a 1.0 amp current is passed through an electrolytic cell for 1.0 hour, and I need to find out how many grams of each metal (Ag, Cu, Al) are deposited at the cathode.

Hmm, I remember that when current flows through an electrolytic cell, metal ions gain electrons and get deposited as metal. The amount deposited depends on the current, time, and the metal's properties.

Oh right, Faraday's laws of electrolysis are involved here. The first law says the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the amount of electricity used. The second law relates it to the molar mass and the number of electrons transferred.

So the formula I think is: mass = (current × time × molar mass) / (number of electrons × Faraday constant)

Wait, Faraday's constant F is 96,500 C per mole. Right, because 1 mole of electrons is about 96,500 coulombs.

Let me break it down for each metal.

First, calculating the total charge passed. Current is 1.0 amp for 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 3600 seconds, the charge Q is I × t = 1.0 * 3600 = 3600 coulombs.

Now for each metal:

1. Silver (Ag) from Ag+ solution:
Silver has a +1 charge. So each Ag+ gains 1 electron to become Ag. So the moles of electrons per mole of Ag is 1.

Molar mass of Ag is about 108 g/mol. So mass = (3600 C × 108 g/mol) / (1 × 96500 C/mol)
Let me compute that. 3600*108 = 388800. Divide by 96500: 388800 / 96500 ≈ 4.03 grams.

Wait wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again. 3600 *108 = let's see, 3600*100=360,000, 3600*8=28,800. So total 388,800.

388800 divided by 96500 is approximately 4.03 grams. So about 4.02 grams of silver.

2. Copper (Cu) from Cu²+ solution:
Copper ions are Cu²+. Each Cu²+ gains 2 electrons to become Cu metal. So moles of electrons per mole Cu is 2.

Molar mass of Cu is about 63.5 g/mol.

So mass = (3600 C × 63.5 g/mol) / (2 × 96500 C/mol)
Compute numerator: 3600 *63.5 = let's see, 3600*60=216,000; 3600*3.5=12,600. So total 228,600.

Denominator: 2*96500=193,000.

So 228600 / 193000 ≈ 1.185 grams. Wait, but I thought it might be 1.19 or 1.20. Let me compute it more accurately.

228600 ÷ 193,000 = (228600 ÷ 1000) is 228.6; 193 goes into 228.6 how many times? 228.6 /193 ≈ 1.1848, so approximately 1.18 or 1.19 grams.

3. Aluminum (Al) from Al³+ solution:
Aluminum has a +3 charge. So each Al³+ gains 3 electrons to form Al metal. Moles of electrons per mole Al is 3.

Molar mass of Al is about 27 g/mol.

Mass = (3600 ×27) / (3 ×96500)
Compute numerator: 3600 *27=97200.

Denominator: 3 *96500=289500.

97200 / 289500 = Hmm. Let's see, 289500 is about 2.895e5. 97200 is 9.72e4.

So 9.72e4 / 2.895e5 = approximately 0.336 grams. Let me do it more accurately.

97200 ÷ 289500 = divide numerator and denominator by 100: 972 / 2895.

Let me compute 2895 × 0.335 = 2895 *0.3=868.5, 2895*0.035=101.325. Sum is 969.825. Close to 972. So about 0.335 grams.

So putting it all together: Ag is ~4.02g, Cu ~1.19g, Al ~0.335g.

Now looking at the options.

Option H says 4.02g Ag, 1.19g Cu, 0.335g Al. That's exactly what I calculated.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option H: 4.02g of Ag, 1.19g of Cu, 0.335g of Al.

Yes, that's correct.

To determine the mass of each metal deposited at the cathode, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The formula for the mass deposited is:

\[
\text{mass} = \frac{\text{current} \times \text{time} \times \text{molar mass}}{\text{number of electrons} \times \text{Faraday constant}}
\]

### Given Data:
- Current (\(I\)) = 1.0 A
- Time (\(t\)) = 1.0 hour = 3600 seconds
- Faraday constant (\(F\)) = 96,500 C/mol

### Calculations:
1. **Silver (Ag):**
   - Charge of Ag\(^+\): +1, so 1 electron is transferred per Ag atom.
   - Molar mass of Ag = 108 g/mol.
   - Mass of Ag deposited:
     \[
     \text{mass}_{\text{Ag}} = \frac{1.0 \times 3600 \times 108}{1 \times 96500} = \frac{388800}{96500} \approx 4.02 \, \text{g}
     \]

2. **Copper (Cu):**
   - Charge of Cu\(^{2+}\): +2, so 2 electrons are transferred per Cu atom.
   - Molar mass of Cu = 63.5 g/mol.
   - Mass of Cu deposited:
     \[
     \text{mass}_{\text{Cu}} = \frac{1.0 \times 3600 \times 63.5}{2 \times 96500} = \frac{228600}{193000} \approx 1.19 \, \text{g}
     \]

3. **Aluminum (Al):**
   - Charge of Al\(^{3+}\): +3, so 3 electrons are transferred per Al atom.
   - Molar mass of Al = 27 g/mol.
   - Mass of Al deposited:
     \[
     \text{mass}_{\text{Al}} = \frac{1.0 \times 3600 \times 27}{3 \times 96500} = \frac{97200}{289500} \approx 0.335 \, \text{g}
     \]

### Final Results:
- Mass of Ag deposited: 4.02 g
- Mass of Cu deposited: 1.19 g
- Mass of Al deposited: 0.335 g

### Matching with Options:
The calculations match **Option H**, which states: 4.02 g of Ag, 1.19 g of Cu, and 0.335 g of Al.
