Okay, so I have this question about GDP and which option falls under the category C. Hmm, I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, and it's the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a year. Wait, the question is asking about which option is classified under C when calculating GDP. Oh right, in the context of GDP, C typically stands for Consumption, which includes spending by households on goods and services.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The components of GDP are usually broken down into four categories: Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Spending (G), and Net Exports (NX). So C is for consumer spending. So the question is asking which of the options is an example of consumption.

Looking at the options:

A: Purchase of a new car by a car rental company. So a company buying a car to rent out. That sounds more like investment because it's a business investment for production purposes. So this would be part of I, not C.

B: Purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company. Definitely investment, since it's a capital good used in production. So B is I.

C: A company buying a new office building. Again, investment because it's a business purchase for their operations. So C is I.

D: Homeowner mowing her own lawn. This is a bit tricky. If you do it yourself, it's not part of the market economy. GDP only counts goods and services that are sold in the market. So mowing your own lawn doesn't add to GDP because it's not a market transaction. So D isn't part of C.

E: Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts. That's an intermediate good. The baker buys flour to produce donuts, which are the final product. So the flour isn't counted in GDP because it's part of the production process, not the final product. So E is not included in C or any other category except maybe as an intermediate step that's not counted.

F: Purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm. Again, this is a business buying software, which would be part of investment (I), as it's a capital good used in production.

G: $50 spent eating out at a restaurant. This is a direct purchase by a consumer for a service, so it's consumption. So G would be part of C.

H: A barber cutting his own hair. Like option D, this is a personal service that isn't part of the market economy. So it's not counted in GDP, so H isn't C.

Wait, let me make sure. The options are about what's classified under C. So the correct answer should be G, because it's a consumer spending on a service. The other options are either investment or not counted at all.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option G is a restaurant meal, which is a service consumed by the household, so yes, that's definitely consumption.

So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant. This is classified under Consumption (C) in GDP calculations because it represents household spending on a service. Other options either fall under Investment (I) or are not counted in GDP.

Answer: G
