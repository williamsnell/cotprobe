Okay, so I have this problem where Julian is jogging around a circular track with a radius of 50 meters. The question is about finding dy/dt at a specific moment when his x-coordinate is changing at a certain rate. Hmm, let me think about this.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with motion in a circular path, we can model the position using parametric equations. So like, x(t) = r cos(theta) and y(t) = r sin(theta), where r is the radius. Since the radius here is 50 m, x and y are functions of the angle theta as it changes over time.

Wait, but the problem gives me the x-coordinate's rate of change, dx/dt, and asks for dy/dt. So I think I should relate the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt somehow. Oh right, because both x and y are functions of theta, which is a function of time t. So I can use the chain rule here.

Let me write down the expressions. So,
x = r cos(theta)
y = r sin(theta)

Taking the derivative of x with respect to time t:
dx/dt = d/dt [r cos(theta)] = -r sin(theta) * d(theta)/dt
Similarly, dy/dt = d/dt [r sin(theta)] = r cos(theta) * d(theta)/dt

Hmm, so dx/dt is related to sin(theta) and dy/dt is related to cos(theta). Also, the product of dx/dt and dy/dt would involve sin(theta) and cos(theta), but maybe there's a way to find dy/dt directly.

Wait, I also know that for a circular path, (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 = (dr/dt)^2. But wait, the radius isn't changing, so dr/dt is zero. That can't be right. Oh wait no, that's for when r is changing. Wait, no, wait, in this case, the radius is fixed at 50 m. So it's a circular motion with constant radius, so the speed is along the tangent. Hmm, but this might not directly help.

Alternatively, I can think about the derivatives in terms of each other. Let me consider the ratio dy/dt over dx/dt. From the earlier expressions:

dy/dt = r cos(theta) * d(theta)/dt
dx/dt = -r sin(theta) * d(theta)/dt

So dy/dt divided by dx/dt would be [r cos(theta) * d(theta)/dt] / [-r sin(theta) * d(theta)/dt]. The r and d(theta)/dt terms cancel out, leaving dy/dt / dx/dt = -cos(theta)/sin(theta) = -cot(theta). So dy/dt = dx/dt * (-cot(theta)).

But I don't know theta yet. However, I have the coordinates (40,30) at that moment. So I can find theta from the position. Let's see, x = 40 = r cos(theta), so cos(theta) = 40/50 = 0.8. Similarly, y = 30 = 50 sin(theta), so sin(theta) = 30/50 = 0.6.

So cos(theta) is 0.8 and sin(theta) is 0.6. Therefore, cot(theta) is cos(theta)/sin(theta) = 0.8 / 0.6 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

So dy/dt = dx/dt * (-cot(theta)) = (-1.25) * (-4/3) = (1.25)*(4/3). Let me compute that. 1.25 is 5/4, so (5/4) * (4/3) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667 m/s. Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the signs.

Because when I took the derivative, dx/dt is -r sin(theta) d(theta)/dt. So if Julian is moving in the circular path, the angle theta is increasing with time, so d(theta)/dt is positive. So let me think: at the point (40,30), which is in the first quadrant, so theta is between 0 and 90 degrees. So sin(theta) is positive, cos(theta) is positive.

Given that, dx/dt is negative because it's -r sin(theta) * d(theta)/dt. So if d(theta)/dt is positive, then dx/dt is negative. So in the problem, dx/dt is given as -1.25 m/s, which makes sense because the x-coordinate is decreasing when moving in the circular path counterclockwise in the first quadrant.

So the ratio dy/dt = dx/dt * (-cot(theta)). Let me plug in the numbers: dx/dt is -1.25, cot(theta) is 4/3, so:

dy/dt = (-1.25) * (-4/3) = (5/4) * (4/3) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 1.667, which is approximately 5/3. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait another way to compute this: using the position to find velocity. The velocity vector is tangent to the circle, and its magnitude is r * d(theta)/dt. So the speed is v = r * d(theta)/dt.

We can find v from dx/dt or dy/dt. Let's compute v using dx/dt.

From dx/dt = -r sin(theta) * d(theta)/dt. So:

dx/dt = -50 * (0.6) * d(theta)/dt. Because sin(theta) is 0.6.

So, dx/dt = -30 * d(theta)/dt. We are told dx/dt is -1.25. So:

-1.25 = -30 * d(theta)/dt => d(theta)/dt = (-1.25)/(-30) = 1.25/30 = 5/(120) = 1/24 rad/s.

Now, dy/dt = r cos(theta) * d(theta)/dt. So:

dy/dt = 50 * 0.8 * (1/24) = 40 * (1/24) = 40/24 = 5/3 ≈1.6667 m/s, which is 1.667.

So the correct answer is I: 1.667.

To solve the problem, we analyze Julian's motion on a circular track of radius \( r = 50 \, \text{m} \). His position at a given moment is \((x, y) = (40, 30)\), and we are tasked with finding \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) given that \(\frac{dx}{dt} = -1.25 \, \text{m/s}\).

### Step 1: Relating \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dy}{dt}\)
Using the parametric equations of circular motion:
\[
x = r \cos(\theta), \quad y = r \sin(\theta),
\]
we differentiate with respect to time \(t\):
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -r \sin(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt}, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = r \cos(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt}.
\]
Dividing \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) by \(\frac{dx}{dt}\), we find:
\[
\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} = -\cot(\theta), \quad \text{so } \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} \cdot (-\cot(\theta)).
\]

### Step 2: Finding \(\cot(\theta)\)
From the coordinates \((x, y) = (40, 30)\), we calculate:
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{40}{50} = 0.8, \quad \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{30}{50} = 0.6.
\]
Thus:
\[
\cot(\theta) = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{0.8}{0.6} = \frac{4}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \(\frac{dy}{dt}\)
Substituting \(\frac{dx}{dt} = -1.25 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{4}{3}\) into the equation for \(\frac{dy}{dt}\):
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} \cdot (-\cot(\theta)) = -1.25 \cdot \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) = 1.25 \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.667 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **I: 1.667**.
