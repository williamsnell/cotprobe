Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about albinism. Hmm, albinism is when there's a lack of pigment in the skin, eyes, and hair. The question says it's determined by a single recessive gene, which I think is 'a'. So, the gene for albinism is recessive.

Part (a) asks: What's the probability an albino results from a cross between an albino and a phenotypically normal individual. Wait, albinism is recessive, so the albino must have the genotype aa. The phenotypically normal person could be AA or Aa, right? Unless the question specifies, but it just says normal phenotype. Oh wait, the parents are an albino and a normal. So the albino is aa, and the other parent is either AA or Aa.

Wait, but the problem doesn't say anything about the genotype of the normal parent. Oh, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, no—when it says "a cross between an albino and an individual of a normal phenotype," without any other info, the normal individual must be a carrier or not. Wait, but in the general population, the frequency of albinism is given as 0.00005, which I think is q². Because q² is the frequency of the recessive phenotype. Since q is the frequency of the recessive allele.

So, the frequency of the recessive allele in the population is sqrt(0.00005). Let me calculate that. Square root of 5e-5. Let's see, 5e-5 is 0.00005. The square root is approx 0.00707, so about 0.7% for q, the allele frequency.

Wait, but for part (a), the cross is between an albino (aa) and a normal. The normal's genotype is either AA or Aa. Wait, but what's the probability that the normal parent is AA or Aa? Because the normal parent could be either. So, the frequency of AA is (1 - q)^2, and Aa is 2pq, where p is the dominant allele frequency.

Wait, p is 1 - q, so p = 1 - 0.00707 ≈ 0.99293.

So the proportion of the population that is AA is p², which is (0.99293)^2 ≈ 0.9859. And Aa is 2pq = 2 * 0.99293 * 0.00707 ≈ 0.0141 or 1.41%.

Wait, so the normal parent has a 98.59% chance of being AA and 1.41% chance of being Aa. But wait, no, the phenotypically normal individuals include both AA and Aa. So when selecting a random normal individual, the probability that they're AA is (p²)/(p² + 2pq) and Aa is (2pq)/(p² + 2pq).

Wait, because in the population, the frequency of AA is p² and Aa is 2pq. Since the question is about a cross with a normal individual, which could be either AA or Aa.

So when you cross aa (albino) with either AA or Aa, the possible offspring.

If the other parent is AA: aa x AA. The gametes from aa are only 'a', and from AA are only 'A'. So all offspring would be Aa, which is phenotypically normal. So no albino offspring.

If the other parent is Aa: aa x Aa. The gametes from aa are 'a's. From Aa, gametes are 50% A and 50% a. So the possible offspring are 50% Aa (normal) and 50% aa (albino).

So the overall probability of an albino offspring is the probability that the normal parent is Aa times 0.5. Because if the parent is AA, 0% chance of albino, if Aa, 50% chance.

So the probability the normal parent is Aa is (2pq)/(p² + 2pq). Let's compute that.

Wait, but earlier I found that 2pq is approx 0.0141, and p² is approx 0.9859. So the denominator is p² + 2pq = 0.9859 + 0.0141 = 1.0. So the probability that a normal individual is Aa is 0.0141, which is 1.41%.

Wait no, wait. Because 2pq is the frequency of Aa in the population. So the proportion of normal individuals who are Aa is 2pq / (p² + 2pq) = 2pq / (1 - q²) because p² + 2pq + q² =1, so p² +2pq =1 - q².

But since q is 0.00707, q² is 0.00005, so denominator is 0.99995.

So the proportion is (2pq) / 0.99995 ≈ (0.0141) / 1 ≈ 0.0141, which is 1.41%.

So the chance that the normal parent is Aa is 1.41%. Then, when crossed with aa, the chance of an albino is 50% of that. So 0.0141 * 0.5 = 0.00705, which is 0.705% approximately. So about 0.7%.

Wait, but wait: part (a) is asking for the probability of an albino resulting from such a cross. So the cross is between aa and a normal person. So the probability is 0.5 * probability that the normal is Aa.

Which is 0.5 * (2pq) as a proportion of all possible normal genotypes.

Wait, 2pq is the frequency of Aa in the population, and (p^2 + 2pq) is the frequency of phenotypically normal people. So the proportion of normal people that are Aa is 2pq / (p^2 + 2pq).

So the probability of the cross resulting in an albino is (2pq/(p²+2pq)) * 0.5.

But wait, since p is (1 - q), and q is 0.00707, let's compute this.

Compute 2pq = 2*(0.99293)*(0.00707) ≈ 0.0141.

p² = (0.99293)^2 ≈ 0.9859.

So 2pq / (p² + 2pq) = 0.0141 / (0.9859 + 0.0141) ) = 0.0141 / 1.0 = 0.0141.

So the probability that the normal parent is Aa is 0.0141, or 1.41%. Then the chance of having an albino is 1.41% * 0.5 = 0.705%, approximately 0.7%.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options for part (a) and (b) are each percentages. So part (a) is 0.7% or 0.5% or such. Looking at the options, option E is (0.7%, 0.99). Option H is (0.5%, 0.90). Option B is 1%, etc.

So part (a)'s answer is approximately 0.7%, which matches option E's first part, 0.7%.

Now part (b): What proportion of albinos have phenotypically normal parents?

Hmm. So albinos are aa. So their parents must each contribute an 'a' allele. So the parents could be Aa x Aa, Aa x aa, or aa x aa. But aa x aa would result in aa offspring, but their parents are both albino. But the question is about albinos with phenotypically normal parents. So the parents must be phenotypically normal, which means they both can't be aa.

So the possible crosses that result in an albino with normal parents are when both parents are Aa (since if one parent is aa, that's albino, which is not "normal" phenotype).

Wait, no, parents can be Aa and aa? No, because if one parent is aa (albino), then the other parent must give an 'a' for the child to be aa. But the other parent would have to be at least Aa, right? Because 'aa' is homozygous recessive. So for a child to be aa, each parent must give an 'a' allele.

So the possible parent combinations are:

1. Aa x Aa → aa (probability 25%).
2. Aa x aa → aa (probability 100% of aa from aa parent and 50% a from Aa parent? Wait, no: if one parent is aa, they can only give 'a' gametes. So if other parent is Aa, they give 'A' or 'a' (50% each). So the chance of child being aa is 50% in that case.

Wait, but the question is about albinos (aa) who have phenotypically normal parents. So both parents must be phenotypically normal, i.e., A_ (either AA or Aa).

So the only way for parents to be normal but have an aa child is if both are Aa, because if one parent is AA, they can't contribute 'a' gametes. So the only way is when both parents are Aa.

Wait, no. If one parent is AA and the other is Aa, the child can't be aa. Because the AA parent can only give 'A' gametes, so the child would be Aa. If both parents are Aa, then each can give 'a' gametes, so 25% chance of aa.

Wait, another possibility: if one parent is Aa and the other is aa? Then the parent aa can only give 'a' gametes, and the Aa gives 'A' or 'a' gametes. So the children would be 50% Aa (phenotypically normal) and 50% aa (albino). But in this case, one parent is albino, so the parents are not both phenotypically normal. So this scenario is excluded because the question is about albinos with both parents phenotypically normal.

So the only scenario where both parents are normal (phenotype) and have an albino child is when both are Aa. So the chance is when both are Aa, the chance their child is aa is 25%.

So the proportion of albinos with normal parents is the proportion of albinos who result from Aa x Aa crosses.

So to find this proportion, we need to calculate the fraction of aa individuals whose parents are both Aa.

But wait, the total number of aa individuals can come from two sources:

1. Parents are both Aa: probability of each child being aa is 0.25.
2. One parent is Aa and the other is aa: but wait, that would mean one parent is albino, so the parents aren't both normal. So this case doesn't contribute to the albinos with normal parents.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The albinos can result from:

- Aa x Aa: 25% aa, so each such couple contributes 0.25 aa per child.
- Aa x aa: 50% aa, but since one parent is albino, the parents aren't both normal. So albinos from this cross have at least one albino parent, so they're excluded from the proportion we're calculating.
- aa x aa: all offspring are aa, but both parents are albino, so again, excluded.

So the only source of albinos with two normal parents is the Aa x Aa cross.

So the total number of albinos is the sum of all aa produced from all possible crosses.

Wait, let's compute the frequency of albinos.

The frequency of aa (albinos) is q² = 0.00005.

But the albinos can come from:

1. Aa x Aa: probability of aa is 0.25 per child. The frequency of Aa x Aa matings is (2pq)^2 (since each parent must be Aa, which has frequency 2pq). Wait, no, the frequency of Aa is 2pq, so the frequency of Aa x Aa matings is (2pq)^2. But wait, actually, the Hardy-Weinberg principle tells us genotype frequencies are p², 2pq, q². So the proportion of matings that are Aa x Aa is (2pq)^2 / (2pq + p² + q²)^2? No, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the frequency of Aa individuals is 2pq, so the proportion of all possible matings that are Aa x Aa is (2pq)^2. But the total number of matings is all possible, but perhaps it's easier to compute the fraction of aa cases resulting from Aa x Aa.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the probability that an albino individual has two Aa parents.

But given that all albinos are aa, and considering their parents:

The possible parent genotypes (assuming random mating) are:

- Both parents Aa: probability that each is Aa is (2pq)^2. The chance their child is aa is 0.25.
- One parent Aa and the other aa: probability 2*(2pq)(q²). The chance their child is aa is 0.5 * 1 (because aa can only give 'a').
But wait, no. Let me think in terms of the possible parent combinations that can produce aa offspring.

Another approach: using Bayesian probability.

We can find the probability that both parents are Aa, given that the child is aa.

So P(both Aa | child aa) = [P(child aa | both Aa) * P(both Aa)] / P(child aa).

We know P(child aa) is q².

P(child aa | both Aa) is 0.25.

P(both Aa) is (2pq)^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the probability that a random mate is Aa is 2pq, so the probability both parents are Aa is (2pq)^2.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the probability that the mother is Aa and the father is Aa is (2pq)^2.

So the numerator is 0.25 * (2pq)^2.

The denominator, P(child aa), is q².

So the overall probability is [0.25 * (2pq)^2 ] / q².

Let me compute this.

We know that q = 0.00707, so q² = 0.00005.

2pq = 2 * 0.99293 * 0.00707 ≈ 0.0141, so (2pq)^2 ≈ (0.0141)^2 ≈ 0.000198.

Then numerator is 0.25 * 0.000198 ≈ 0.0000495.

Denominator is 0.00005.

So 0.0000495 / 0.00005 ≈ 0.99.

So 99% of albinos have both parents Aa (phenotypically normal).

So part (b)'s answer is approximately 0.99, which matches option E's second part.

So looking back at the options, option E is (0.7%, 0.99), which matches both parts.

So the correct answer should be option E.
</think>

Albinism is a recessive genetic disorder caused by the allele \(a\). The frequency of albinism in the population is given as \(0.00005\), which corresponds to \(q^2\) in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Thus, the frequency of the recessive allele \(q\) is:

\[
q = \sqrt{0.00005} \approx 0.00707 \, (0.707\%).
\]

The dominant allele frequency \(p\) is:

\[
p = 1 - q \approx 0.99293.
\]

### Part (a): Probability of an albino resulting from a cross between an albino (\(aa\)) and a phenotypically normal individual
An albino (\(aa\)) can only produce gametes with the allele \(a\). A phenotypically normal individual can have the genotype \(AA\) or \(Aa\). The probability of the normal individual being \(AA\) is \(p^2\), and the probability of being \(Aa\) is \(2pq\). If the normal individual is \(AA\), all offspring will be \(Aa\) (phenotypically normal). If the normal individual is \(Aa\), there is a 50% chance of producing an \(aa\) (albino) offspring.

The proportion of normal individuals who are \(Aa\) is:

\[
\frac{2pq}{p^2 + 2pq} = \frac{2(0.99293)(0.00707)}{(0.99293)^2 + 2(0.99293)(0.00707)} \approx \frac{0.0141}{0.9859 + 0.0141} \approx 0.0141 \, (1.41\%).
\]

The probability of an albino offspring is:

\[
\text{Probability of normal parent being } Aa \times 0.5 = 0.0141 \times 0.5 \approx 0.00705 \, (0.705\%).
\]

Thus, the probability of an albino resulting from this cross is approximately **0.7%**.

### Part (b): Proportion of albinos with phenotypically normal parents
Albinos (\(aa\)) can only result from parents who each contribute an \(a\) allele. The only way for both parents to be phenotypically normal (\(A_\)) is if both are heterozygous (\(Aa\)). The probability of this occurring is:

\[
\text{Probability both parents are } Aa \times \text{Probability of producing } aa = (2pq)^2 \times 0.25.
\]

Using Bayesian probability, the proportion of albinos with both parents \(Aa\) is:

\[
\frac{(2pq)^2 \times 0.25}{q^2}.
\]

Substituting values:

\[
\frac{(0.0141)^2 \times 0.25}{0.00005} \approx \frac{0.000198 \times 0.25}{0.00005} \approx 0.99 \, (99\%).
\]

Thus, approximately **99%** of al
