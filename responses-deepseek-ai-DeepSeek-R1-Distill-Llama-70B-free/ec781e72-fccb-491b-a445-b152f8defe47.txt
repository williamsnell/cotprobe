Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this insurance question. Let me read it again. Thomas has property damage insurance on his car with a limit of $5,000. He damaged Frank's car, causing $2,350 in damages. The question is how much the insurance company will pay.

Hmm, I remember that insurance policies usually have limits, which is the maximum they'll pay per claim. So Thomas's policy maxes out at $5k. But the damage here is $2,350, which is less than the limit. So I think the insurance should cover the actual damage because it's under the limit.

Wait, but sometimes insurance companies might have deductibles or other conditions. The question doesn't mention any deductible, so I guess we can ignore that. It's just a straightforward case where the damage is within the policy limit.

So the options are E, which is $2,350, and others. Looking at the options: A is the full limit, which is more than needed. B and others are different numbers, but E matches the actual damage. So the answer should be E.

I don't think the other options make sense. Like, why would they pay more or less than the actual amount if the policy covers it? Unless there's some kind of depreciation or something, but the question doesn't mention that. So yeah, E is the right choice.

The insurance company will pay the actual damage amount since it's within the policy limit.

Answer: E
