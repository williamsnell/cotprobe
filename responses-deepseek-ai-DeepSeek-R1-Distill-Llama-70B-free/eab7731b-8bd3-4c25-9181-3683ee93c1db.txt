Question:

3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that they form a pair? (A 3-card hand is a 'pair' if two of the cards match in rank but the third card is different. For example, 668 is a pair, but 999 is not.)

Options:

A: \frac{1}{26}
B: \frac{13}{52}
C: \frac{1}{13}
D: \frac{72}{425}
E: \frac{1}{78}
F: \frac{4}{13}
G: \frac{1}{36}
H: \frac{3}{26}
I: \frac{1}{8}
J: \frac{1}{52}

Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about finding the probability that three randomly chosen cards from a standard 52-card deck form a pair. A pair is when two cards have the same rank, and the third is different. So, examples are like 6-6-8, but not 9-9-9 because that's three of a kind, not a pair.

Hmm, right. So, probability is about favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes. I think I need to calculate both the total number of possible 3-card hands and the number of those hands that form a pair.

First, the total number of possible 3-card hands. That's a combination problem because the order of the cards doesn't matter when you're dealt the hand. So the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k! (n - k)!)). So for 52 cards choosing 3, it's 52C3. Let me calculate that. 52*51*50/(3*2*1) = (52*51*50)/6. Let's compute: 52/2 is 26, so 26 * 51 *50 /3. Wait, 26*51 is 1326, 1326 *50 =66300, divided by 3 is 22100. So yeah, 22100 possible 3-card hands.

Next, the number of favorable outcomes, which are the hands that form a pair. So, how to compute that.

I think the approach is to first choose the rank that will form the pair. There are 13 possible ranks (Ace through King). Once we've chosen a rank, we need to choose 2 suits out of the 4 available for that rank. So, for each rank, the number of ways to choose 2 cards is 4C2. 4C2 is (4*3)/(2*1) =6.

So for each rank, there are 6 possible pairs. But then, the third card must not form another pair or three of a kind. So the third card has to be of a different rank. So, after choosing the pair, we need to choose the third card from the remaining ranks, and any suit.

Wait, so let me break it down:

1. Choose the rank for the pair: 13 options.
2. Choose 2 suits from that rank: 6 options.
3. Choose the rank for the third card: since it has to be different, there are 12 remaining ranks.
4. Choose 1 suit for that third card: 4 options.

So the total number of favorable hands is 13 * 6 * 12 *4.

Wait, let me compute that. 13 *6 is 78. 12 *4 is 48. 78 *48 = let's see. 70*48=3360, 8*48=384. So 3360 +384= 3744. So 3744 favorable hands.

Wait, but wait a minute, does that include cases where the third card might form a pair with another card? No, because we specifically chose the third card's rank to be different. Oh wait, no, because the third card is of a different rank, so it can't form a pair with the other two. So that seems right.

So the probability is favorable / total, which is 3744 / 22100.

Let me simplify that fraction. Both numbers are even, so divide numerator and denominator by 4: 936 / 5525.

Hmm, do they have more common factors? Let's see. 936 divided by 3 is 312. 5525 divided by 3 is 1841.666, which isn't an integer, so 3 isn't a factor. 936 and 5525: I think 13? Let's check 5525 /13: 13 *425 is 5525. 936 /13 is 72. So 72/425.

So the probability is 72/425.

Looking at the options, option D is 72/425. So the answer should be D.

To determine the probability that three randomly chosen cards from a standard 52-card deck form a pair, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes (hands with exactly one pair) and divide it by the total number of possible 3-card hands.

1. **Total number of possible 3-card hands**:  
   This is a combination problem, as the order of the cards does not matter. Using the combination formula:  
   \[
   \binom{52}{3} = \frac{52 \times 51 \times 50}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 22100
   \]

2. **Number of favorable outcomes (hands with exactly one pair)**:  
   - Choose the rank for the pair: There are 13 possible ranks (Ace through King).  
   - Choose 2 suits for the chosen rank: There are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways to choose 2 suits from 4.  
   - Choose a different rank for the third card: There are 12 remaining ranks.  
   - Choose 1 suit for the third card: There are 4 possible suits.  

   The total number of favorable hands is:  
   \[
   13 \times 6 \times 12 \times 4 = 3744
   \]

3. **Probability**:  
   The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:  
   \[
   \frac{3744}{22100}
   \]  
   Simplifying the fraction:  
   - Divide numerator and denominator by 4:  
     \[
     \frac{936}{5525}
     \]  
   - Divide numerator and denominator by 13:  
     \[
     \frac{72}{425}
     \]

Thus, the probability that three randomly chosen cards form a pair is \(\frac{72}{425}\). Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is **D**.
