Okay, so I need to find the determinant of matrix A. The matrix given is a 3x3 matrix, which is:

A = [[2, 4, 3],
     [3, 0, 1],
     [1, 2, 5]]

Hmm, I remember that calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be done using the rule of Sarrus or the general method of expansion by minors. I think I'll go with the expansion method because I'm more comfortable with that, even though it might take a bit longer.

So the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:

det(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[ a  b  c ]
[ d  e  f ]
[ g  h  i ]

Let me map the given matrix to this structure. So,

a = 2, b =4, c=3
d=3, e=0, f=1
g=1, h=2, i=5

Plugging into the formula:

det(A) = 2*(0*5 - 1*2) - 4*(3*5 -1*1) +3*(3*2 -0*1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First part: 2*(0*5 -1*2) = 2*(0-2)= 2*(-2) = -4.

Second part: -4*(3*5 -1*1) = -4*(15-1)= -4*14= -56.

Third part: 3*(3*2 -0*1) =3*(6-0)=3*6=18.

Now add them all together: -4 + (-56) +18.

Wait, let me compute that. -4 minus 56 is -60, then plus 18 gives -42.

So the determinant should be -42. Let me check the options. Option G is -42, so the answer must be G.

To calculate the determinant of the 3x3 matrix 

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 3 \\ 3 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 5 \end{bmatrix}, \]

we use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

\[
\text{det}(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg),
\]

where the matrix elements are labeled as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
a & b & c \\ 
d & e & f \\ 
g & h & i 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Mapping the given matrix to this structure:

\[
a = 2, \, b = 4, \, c = 3, \, d = 3, \, e = 0, \, f = 1, \, g = 1, \, h = 2, \, i = 5.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\text{det}(A) = 2(0 \cdot 5 - 1 \cdot 2) - 4(3 \cdot 5 - 1 \cdot 1) + 3(3 \cdot 2 - 0 \cdot 1).
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \( 2(0 \cdot 5 - 1 \cdot 2) = 2(-2) = -4, \)
2. \( -4(3 \cdot 5 - 1 \cdot 1) = -4(15 - 1) = -4(14) = -56, \)
3. \( 3(3 \cdot 2 - 0 \cdot 1) = 3(6 - 0) = 3(6) = 18. \)

Adding these terms together:

\[
\text{det}(A) = -4 - 56 + 18 = -42.
\]

Thus, the determinant of matrix \( A \) is \(-42\). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: -42**
