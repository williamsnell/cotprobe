Okay, so I have this question about lasers and which type uses transitions involving the energy levels of free atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my laser types, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives options from A to I. The main point is to figure out which laser uses free atoms' energy levels. I remember that different lasers have different active media—like gases, solids, or semiconductors.

So, let's go through each option one by one. First, option A is a dye laser. I think dye lasers use organic dyes in a liquid solution. The transitions aren't in free atoms but in molecules or solutions, so probably not A.

Option B is a semiconductor laser. Those are like laser diodes, right? They use semiconductors, so the transitions are between the conduction and valence bands in the semiconductor material. Not free atoms either.

Option C is the gas laser. Wait, gas lasers use gases as their active medium. Examples I can think of include helium-neon lasers. In those, the gas is excited, and the atoms in the gas emit light as they transition between energy levels. So this might be the right one. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D is a chemical laser. I'm not too sure about this one. I think chemical lasers involve chemical reactions that produce excited molecules. They probably use molecular transitions rather than free atoms, so maybe not D.

Option E is a fiber laser. Those use optical fibers, typically doped with rare-earth elements like erbium. The transitions are in the ions within the fiber, so again, not free atoms.

Option F is a solid-state laser. That includes things like ruby lasers or neodymium YAG lasers. These use crystals or glasses with dopant ions. The transitions are in the ions, so not free atoms.

Option G is a free-electron laser. That's a bit different. I remember it uses a beam of electrons, not atoms, so the transitions aren't related to atomic energy levels. So G is out.

Option H is an excimer laser. Excimer lasers use molecules, typically noble gas halides. The transitions are within these molecules, so not free atoms. So H isn't the answer.

Option I is a diode laser, which I think is similar to the semiconductor laser in option B. So same reasoning applies—it's based on semiconductor physics, not free atoms.

So after going through each option, it seems like option C, the gas laser, is the correct answer because it uses free atoms in a gaseous state, and the transitions are between their energy levels.

The question asks which type of laser utilizes transitions involving the energy levels of free atoms. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed based on its active medium and the nature of the transitions:

- **A: Dye laser** – Uses organic dyes in a liquid solution, so transitions involve molecules, not free atoms.  
- **B: Semiconductor laser** – Relies on transitions between the conduction and valence bands in a semiconductor, not free atoms.  
- **C: Gas laser** – Employs gases as the active medium, where transitions occur between energy levels of free atoms (e.g., helium-neon lasers). This fits the description.  
- **D: Chemical laser** – Involves chemical reactions that produce excited molecules, so transitions are molecular, not atomic.  
- **E: Fiber laser** – Uses optical fibers doped with ions, where transitions occur in the ions, not free atoms.  
- **F: Solid-state laser** – Relies on transitions in dopant ions within a crystal or glass, not free atoms.  
- **G: Free-electron laser** – Uses a beam of electrons, not atoms, so transitions are unrelated to atomic energy levels.  
- **H: Excimer laser** – Involves transitions within molecules (e.g., noble gas halides), not free atoms.  
- **I: Diode laser** – Similar to semiconductor lasers, with transitions in semiconductor materials, not free atoms.  

The correct answer is **C: Gas laser**, as it directly involves transitions between the energy levels of free atoms in a gaseous medium.
