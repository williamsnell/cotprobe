Okay, so I've got this question about the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and I'm a bit rusty on my World War I history, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question and the provided information carefully.

The question is about Article III of the treaty and its result. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. 

First, I remember that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in World War I. It was between the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey) and the Bolshevik government of Russia. The main points I recall are that Russia had to give up a lot of territory, which led to the creation of some independent states, but the details are a bit fuzzy.

Looking at the specific article provided, Article III says that territories west of a certain line, which were formerly Russian, will no longer be under Russian sovereignty. The line is determined by a Russo-German commission. So, what's to the west of this line? I think it refers to areas that Russia is giving up. 

I remember that after the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks withdrew from the war. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk imposed harsh terms. Russia lost significant territories, including parts that are now Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic states. These areas were west of Russia proper and were ceded to Germany and Austria-Hungary. 

So, the territories in question are the western parts of the former Russian Empire. Since the treaty is between Russia and the Central Powers, the result would be that these western territories were taken over by the Central Powers, specifically Germany, I think. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this scenario. Let's go through them:

Option A: Surrender of eastern Austria to Russia. No, because the treaty was Russia losing territory, not gaining.

Option B: Bulgaria to Russia. Doesn't fit; Bulgaria was on the Central Powers' side.

Option C: Western German Empire to Russia. No, that doesn't make sense because the Central Powers were taking territory from Russia, not the other way around.

Option D: Neutral zone between German and Russian Empires. I don't think the treaty established a neutral zone; it was about transferring territories.

Option E: Austria-Hungary to Russia. Again, no, the opposite was happening.

Option F: Eastern German Empire to Russia. Wait, the article is about Russia losing territory west of a line. So the Germans would be taking land from Russia, not giving their eastern part.

Option G: Joint control over western Russia. Maybe, but the article says the territories are no longer under Russian sovereignty. Joint control isn't the same as surrender.

Option H: Eastern German Empire to Austria. Doesn't fit with Article III, which is about Russia's loss.

Option I: Eastern Russia to Germany. Wait, the article refers to territories west of the line. So if Russia is giving up the west, then the territories to the east would remain with Russia. So I don't think this is right.

Option J: Western Russia to Germany. Yes, this makes sense. Because Article III says the western territories are no longer Russian. So those areas are being surrendered to Germany, I believe.

Wait, but let me clarify. The line is the border. So territories west of the line (which are to the west, so closer to Germany) are being taken by Germany. So Russia is giving up its western territories to Germany.

So looking at the options, option J says the surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire. That fits.

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed on March 14, 1918, marked Russia's withdrawal from World War I. Article III of the treaty stipulated that territories west of a specified line, which had previously belonged to Russia, would no longer be under Russian sovereignty. These territories were ceded to the Central Powers, primarily Germany, as part of the harsh terms imposed on Russia. The result of this article was the surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire.
