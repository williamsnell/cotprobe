Okay, so I have this question about the population of Teotihuacán at its peak. I'm a bit rusty on my ancient civilizations, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Teotihuacán was a major Mesoamerican city, right? It's in what's now Mexico. I think it's one of the biggest ancient cities in the Americas. I've heard that it was a significant urban center, so the population must have been pretty large.

Wait, I recall that some of the largest ancient cities include places like Rome, which I believe had around a million people. But Teotihuacán was in the Americas, so maybe not as big as Rome, but still substantial. I'm trying to remember specific numbers.

I think the population estimates vary, but I've read that Teotihuacán might have had somewhere between 100,000 to 200,000 people. That's a rough estimate. Let me think about the options given. The options are A: 50k, B: 200k, C: 500k, D: 1 million.

If I remember correctly, some sources say that at its peak, Teotihuacán could have been as large as 200,000. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've also heard some estimates that go higher. Maybe up to 250,000 or even more? Or was that another city?

Alternatively, I think the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán was larger, maybe reaching 200,000 or more. But that's much later. Teotihuacán was earlier, around the first millennium AD.

I also remember that the city covered a vast area, with large pyramids like the Pyramid of the Sun. The size of the city suggests a large population. But how does that translate into numbers?

Another angle: looking at the options, 200,000 is option B. 500,000 is C, and a million is D. I think 200k is more commonly cited for Teotihuacán. Wait, but I've read in some sources that it might have been even larger, maybe around 500,000. Or was that for a different city?

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing it up with other cities. Let me try to recall. I think the population of Teotihuacán was one of the largest in the pre-Columbian Americas. So perhaps it did reach 200,000, making option B correct. But I'm not entirely sure if it's higher.

Wait, I've also heard that some scholars estimate that Teotihuacán could have had up to 100,000 people, but that seems low given its prominence. Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I think the more accurate figure I've come across is around 200,000, so option B might be the answer.

But I'm a bit uncertain because I remember reading that it was possibly the sixth largest city in the world at the time. If that's the case, then perhaps the population was higher. Let me think about historical city sizes. For example, ancient Rome is said to have had around a million. Chang'an (modern Xi'an) in China during the Tang Dynasty had over a million as well.

If Teotihuacán was one of the largest, maybe it's closer to 200,000, which would make it a major city but not as large as the top ones. So I'm leaning towards option B: 200,000 people.

At its peak, Teotihuacán was one of the largest cities in the pre-Columbian Americas, known for its vast size and significant urban development. While estimates vary, a commonly cited figure for its population is around 200,000 people. This aligns with its status as a major urban center and the sixth largest city globally at the time. Although some sources suggest higher numbers, 200,000 is the most frequently referenced estimate.

Answer: B
