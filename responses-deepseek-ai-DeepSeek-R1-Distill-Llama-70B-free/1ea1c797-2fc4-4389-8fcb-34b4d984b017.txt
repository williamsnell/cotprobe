Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that 229 J of heat is supplied to 3.0 moles of Argon gas at constant pressure, and the temperature increases by 2.55 K. We need to find the molar heat capacity at constant volume, Cv.

Hmm, wait. I remember that heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and constant volume (Cv) are related for gases. Oh right, for an ideal gas, the relation Cp - Cv = nR comes into play, where R is the gas constant. But wait, n here is the number of moles.

Wait, wait, the problem gives the heat at constant pressure, so the heat added is n*Cp*ΔT, right? Because when you heat a gas at constant pressure, the heat q is given by q = n Cp ΔT. But wait, wait, the formula I remember is q = n Cv ΔT at constant volume, and q = n Cp ΔT at constant pressure. So in this case, since the process is at constant pressure, the heat added is using Cp.

So the given data is q = 229 J, n =3.0 mol, ΔT=2.55 K. So plugging into q = n Cp ΔT, we can find Cp.

Let me calculate that:

Cp = q / (n * ΔT) = 229 J / (3.0 mol * 2.55 K) 

Let me compute the denominator first. 3.0 * 2.55 is 7.65. So 229 / 7.65 ≈ let's see. 7.65 * 30 is 229.5, because 7.65 * 30 = 229.5. So 229 /7.65 is approximately 30, but wait, 7.65*30 = 229.5, which is just a bit more than 229. So 229/7.65 is about 29.93, which is approximately 30 J/(mol·K). So Cp is about 30 J/(mol·K).

But wait, that can't be right, because I thought Cp for monoatomic gases like Ar is (5/2) R, which is (5/2)*8.314 ≈ 20.785 J/(mol·K). Wait, that's a problem. So wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers. q is 229 J, n is 3.0, ΔT is 2.55.

So 3.0 * 2.55 = 7.65. 229 /7.65 = ?

Well, 7.65 * 30 is 229.5, which is just a bit over 229. So 229/7.65 is approximately 30, but a tiny bit less. Let's calculate it more accurately.

229 ÷7.65. Let me do the division: 7.65 ) 229 (29.93)

7.65 * 29 = 221.85.

Subtracting from 229: 229 - 221.85 =7.15.

Bring down a zero: 71.5.

7.65 goes into 71.5 about 9 times (7.65 *9=68.85). 71.5-68.85=2.65. So so far, 29.9, and the next digit.

So approximately 29.93 J/(mol·K) for Cp.

Wait, but earlier I thought Cp for Ar should be about (5/2) R. Let me compute R. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So (5/2)*8.314 = 5 *4.157=20.785 J/(mol·K). So that's around 20.8 J/(mol·K). But according to my calculation, Cp is around 30 J/(mol·K). That doesn't add up. What did I do wrong?

Ah, wait! No, wait, I think I messed up the formula. Oh wait, no, wait. For monoatomic gases, Cv is (3/2) R, and Cp is (5/2) R. So Cp should be about 20.8 J/(mol·K). But according to the calculation above, Cp is coming out to be about 30 J/(mol·K), which is way higher.

So that suggests I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the process isn't under constant pressure, but no, the question says it's at constant pressure. Wait, let me recheck the numbers in the problem.

Problem says: 229 J is supplied as heat to 3.0 mol Ar(g) at constant pressure, temperature increases by 2.55 K. So q=229 J, n=3, ΔT=2.55.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Wait, 229 J is the heat. So my calculation is correct, but the result doesn't match the expected Cp for Ar. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption about whether the process is at constant pressure or volume.

Wait, the problem says that the heat is supplied at constant pressure. So q_p = n Cp ΔT. So that formula applies.

But according to that, Cp is 229/(3 * 2.55) = 229 /7.65 ≈ 29.93 J/(mol·K), which is about 30 J/(mol·K). But that's not possible for monoatomic gas.

Wait, maybe the data is given for constant volume instead of pressure? No, the problem clearly states it's at constant pressure.

Is there a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. For heat at constant pressure, q = n Cp ΔT. At constant volume, q = n Cv ΔT.

So with the given data, q is 229 J, n=3.0, ΔT=2.55. So Cp is 229 / (3 * 2.55) = 229/7.65 ≈ 30 J/(mol·K). But that's higher than expected.

Wait, but maybe the gas is diatomic or polyatomic. Wait, no, Argon is a noble gas, monoatomic. So for monoatomic, Cp should be 5/2 R = approx 20.8 J/(mol·K). So 30 is way higher than that.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the question is about Cv, so after finding Cp, I can find Cv.

Wait, the question is asking for Cv, the molar heat capacity at constant volume.

Right! So first, find Cp using the given data, then use Cp - Cv = R to find Cv. Because for an ideal gas, Cp - Cv = nR, but wait, wait, actually, it's Cp - Cv = n R when considering the molar heat capacities. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, for an ideal gas, the relation is Cp,m - Cv,m = R, where Cp,m and Cv,m are the molar heat capacities.

Yes, that's correct. So for each mole, Cp,m - Cv,m = R.

So once I find Cp,m, I can subtract R to get Cv,m.

So in this problem, I found Cp,m ≈30 J/(mol·K). Then Cv,m = Cp,m - R =30 -8.314≈21.686 J/(mol·K). But that's not matching the usual (3/2) R which is about 12.47 J/(mol·K) for monoatomic gases.

Wait, this is confusing. Because for monoatomic gases, Cv should be (3/2) R ≈12.47 J/(mol·K), and Cp is (5/2) R≈20.785 J/(mol·K). So if the calculation gives Cp,m≈30, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the heat at constant pressure is q_p = n Cp ΔT.

Yes, that's correct. So with the given values, n=3, q=229 J, ΔT=2.55 K.

So Cp =229/(3 *2.55) = 229/7.65 ≈30 J/(mol·K). But that's higher than Cp for Ar.

Hmm. That suggests that perhaps the question's data is leading to a different conclusion. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate 229 divided by 7.65.

7.65 *30 is 229.5, which is just a bit over 229. So 30 gives 229.5, so 229 is 30 minus (0.5/7.65) ≈0.065. So about 29.935 J/(mol·K), approximately 29.94, which I can round to about 30 J/(mol·K).

But wait, that's the calculated Cp, which doesn't make sense for Ar. So perhaps the data is not for Ar but for another gas? But the question says Ar(g).

Wait, perhaps the process isn't at constant pressure, but at constant volume? No, the question says it's at constant pressure. So perhaps the given value is correct, and the Cp is 30 J/(mol·K), which doesn't make sense for Ar. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the formulas. Another possibility is that the heat was supplied at constant volume, not pressure. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait, the question says "at constant pressure". So the formula q = n Cp ΔT applies.

So using that, I get Cp ≈30 J/(mol·K). Then, using Cp - Cv = R, Cv = Cp - R. So 30 -8.314≈21.686 J/(mol·K). But that can't be right, because for monoatomic gas, Cv should be (3/2) R ≈12.47 J/(mol·K).

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the number of moles. Wait, 3.0 mol is correct. Or perhaps the heat is 229 J? That's possible, but the problem says that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the given data leads to a Cp that doesn't fit Ar. So perhaps the problem is hypothetical, and we proceed regardless.

So in that case, given that, the steps would be:

1. Calculate Cp from q =n Cp ΔT → Cp = q/(n ΔT) =229/(3*2.55)=30 J/(mol·K).

2. Then, since Cp - Cv = R, so Cv = Cp - R =30 -8.314≈21.686 J/(mol·K).

But wait, the options don't include 21.7. Let me look at the options:

Options are:

A:30

B:50

C:35

D:18

E:12.5

F:25

G:15

H:40

I:20

J:45

So 21.7 isn't an option. The closest is I:20, or F:25, but neither is 21.7.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in Cp.

Let me compute 229/(3*2.55) again.

3 *2.55=7.65.

229 ÷7.65.

Let me do long division:

7.65 × 29 = ?

7 ×29=203; 0.65 ×29=18.85 → 203 +18.85=221.85.

229 -221.85=7.15.

Now, 7.15 /7.65 → approximately 0.934.

So 29.934, which is approximately 29.93 J/(mol·K). So Cp ≈29.93 J/(mol·K).

Then Cv = Cp - R =29.93 -8.314≈21.616 J/(mol·K).

But this isn't one of the options. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the process is at constant volume, not pressure. Because if so, then we can calculate Cv directly.

Wait, the question says the process is at constant pressure. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait. For an ideal gas, the heat capacity at constant pressure is Cp = Cv + R.

Wait, but in terms of molar heat capacities, yes, Cp,m = Cv,m + R.

So if I calculate Cp as 30, then Cv is 30 -8.314=21.686.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the molar heat capacity at constant volume, and the process is at constant pressure, but the heat is given, so I need to find Cv.

Wait, but the heat at constant pressure is related to Cp, and from there, I can find Cv.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate Cv using another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the gas isn't monoatomic? But Argon is a noble gas, so it's monoatomic. So that can't be it.

Wait, maybe the data in the problem is incorrect, but I have to proceed with it.

So according to the calculation, the Cp is approximately 30 J/(mol·K). Then Cv is 30 -8.314≈21.686, which isn't among the options.

Looking back at the options, option I is 20 J/K/mol, which is close to 21.686 but not exact. Option F is25, which is further away.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Cp.

Wait, let me recalculate.

q =229 J, n=3.0 mol, ΔT=2.55 K.

Cp = q/(n*ΔT) =229/(3 *2.55) =229/7.65.

Let me compute 7.65 * 30 =229.5.

So 229.5 is 7.65 *30, so 229 is just 0.5 less than that, so 229=7.65*(30 - (0.5/7.65)).

0.5/7.65≈0.0653, so 30-0.0653≈29.9347.

So Cp≈29.9347 J/(mol·K).

Then Cv =29.9347 -8.314 ≈21.6207 J/(mol·K).

So approximately 21.62 J/(mol·K).

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:20 J/K/mol, but that's 1.62 off, which is a significant difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the heat supplied is the enthalpy change ΔH, which is equal to q_p (since at constant pressure, q_p =ΔH). For an ideal gas, ΔH= n Cp ΔT. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the heat capacity is given per mole, but perhaps the calculation is per total. No, the formula uses molar heat capacities.

Wait, perhaps the problem is misprinted, and the amount is 2 moles, not 3. Let me see.

If n=2, then 229/(2 *2.55)=229/5.1≈44.90 J/(mol·K). Then Cv would be 44.90 -8.314≈36.59, which is not an option either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the temperature change is different. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the process is at constant volume, and the given heat is q_v = n Cv ΔT.

But no, the problem states that it's at constant pressure. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate Cv without using Cp.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the gas isn't ideal, but the problem states to assume perfect gases. So that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and I should calculate Cv directly. But how?

Wait, at constant pressure, Q = n Cp ΔT. So Cp is 30. Then Cv is 30 -8.314≈21.686, but that's not in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I is 20, which is close to 21.686. But 20 is (approximately) 20, so maybe the correct option is I? But that would require a different calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of Cp.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation:

229 J / (3.0 mol * 2.55 K) = 229/(7.65) = 229 ÷7.65.

Let me compute that more accurately.

7.65 × 30 = 229.5, which we know is 0.5 J more than 229. So 30 - (0.5/7.65) ≈30 -0.065=29.935 J/(mol·K).

So Cp is approximately 29.935 J/(mol·K).

Then Cv would be 29.935 -8.314=21.621 J/(mol·K).

But the options don't have 21.62; the closest is I:20, which is 1.62 units lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Cv.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the relation between heat capacities.

Wait, for monoatomic ideal gases, Cv=(3/2) R ≈12.47 J/(mol·K).

But according to the data, that's not what we're getting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is misprinted, and the gas is diatomic, which would have Cv=(5/2) R≈20.785 J/(mol·K), which is close to option I:20.

But the problem states Argon gas, which is monoatomic.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total heat capacity, not molar.

Wait, the question says 'molar heat capacities at constant volume', so it's definitely per mole.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the given data is under constant volume, but the question says it's at constant pressure. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I can compute Cv using another formula, like Cv = (q_v)/(n ΔT). But at constant pressure, q is not equal to n Cv ΔT. So without knowing q at constant volume, I can't use that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A:30

B:50

C:35

D:18

E:12.5

F
