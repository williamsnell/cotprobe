Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about expanding (m + n)^6 where m and n are odd integers. I need to find out how many terms in the expansion are odd. The options are from A to J, with J being 5.

Hmm, let's start by recalling the binomial expansion. The expansion of (a + b)^k is the sum from i=0 to i=k of (k choose i) * a^(k-i) * b^i. So for (m + n)^6, each term is C(6, i) * m^(6-i) * n^i, right?

Wait, but the question is about whether each term is odd. Because m and n are odd, so any power of them will also be odd. Because an odd number multiplied by itself remains odd. So m^anything is odd, same for n^anything.

So each term in the expansion is C(6, i) multiplied by two odds. So the term's parity depends on the binomial coefficient C(6, i). Because odd times odd is odd, but if the coefficient is even, then the term becomes even. Because even times odd is even.

So the question really boils down to: how many of the binomial coefficients C(6, i) for i from 0 to 6 are odd?

I remember something about binomial coefficients and their parity. There's Lucas' theorem, which says that C(n, k) is odd if and only if in the binary representation of k, each bit is less than or equal to the corresponding bit in n.

Wait, let me think. The number of odd terms in the expansion of (1 + 1)^n is equal to 2^s, where s is the number of 1s in the binary representation of n. For example, if n is 6, which is 110 in binary. So s is 2. Then the number of odd terms would be 2^2 =4.

Wait, so for (m + n)^6, each term is determined by whether C(6, i) is odd. So the number of odd terms is 4.

But wait, does this apply here? Because in the expansion, each term is C(6,i) * m^{6-i} * n^i. Since m and n are odd, each term's parity is the same as C(6, i)'s parity. Because odd * odd is odd, but even * odd is even.

So the number of odd terms is equal to the number of i's where C(6, i) is odd.

So for n=6, how many C(6, i) are odd?

Let me list them:

i=0: C(6,0)=1 → odd.

i=1: C(6,1)=6 → even.

i=2: C(6,2)=15 → odd.

i=3: C(6,3)=20 → even.

i=4: C(6,4)=15 → odd.

i=5: C(6,5)=6 → even.

i=6: C(6,6)=1 → odd.

So the coefficients at i=0,2,4,6 are odd. That's four terms.

So the correct answer should be 4 terms, which is option D.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about this is using Lucas' theorem. The binary representation of 6 is 110. The number of 1s is 2, so 2^2=4. Yep, that's consistent.

So I think the answer is D.

To determine how many terms in the expansion of \((m + n)^6\) are odd, where \(m\) and \(n\) are odd integers, we analyze the binomial coefficients \(C(6, i)\) for \(i = 0, 1, \dots, 6\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are odd, any power of \(m\) or \(n\) remains odd, and the parity of each term in the expansion depends solely on the parity of \(C(6, i)\). Specifically:

- If \(C(6, i)\) is odd, the term is odd because the product of odd numbers is odd.
- If \(C(6, i)\) is even, the term is even because the product of an even number with odd numbers is even.

The binomial coefficients for \((m + n)^6\) are:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&C(6, 0) = 1 \quad \text{(odd)}, \\
&C(6, 1) = 6 \quad \text{(even)}, \\
&C(6, 2) = 15 \quad \text{(odd)}, \\
&C(6, 3) = 20 \quad \text{(even)}, \\
&C(6, 4) = 15 \quad \text{(odd)}, \\
&C(6, 5) = 6 \quad \text{(even)}, \\
&C(6, 6) = 1 \quad \text{(odd)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

The coefficients \(C(6, 0), C(6, 2), C(6, 4),\) and \(C(6, 6)\) are odd, corresponding to four terms in total. This result is consistent with Lucas' theorem, which states that the number of odd binomial coefficients in \((1 + 1)^n\) is \(2^s\), where \(s\) is the number of 1s in the binary representation of \(n\). For \(n = 6\) (binary: \(110\)), \(s = 2\), so \(2^2 = 4\).

Thus, the number of odd terms in the expansion of \((m + n)^6\) is **4**.
