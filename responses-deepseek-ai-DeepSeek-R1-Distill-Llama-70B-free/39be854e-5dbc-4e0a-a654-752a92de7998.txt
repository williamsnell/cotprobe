Question:

Consider an example of forced convection within a pipe. The local heat transfer coefficient is valid at the point it is evaluated at, and in its immediate vicinity. When the length of pipe as a whole is of concern, the average heat transfer coefficient applies. The average temperature difference is defined as (T_s - T)_av= [{(T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out)} / 2] where T_s = wall surface temperature T_in = bulk fluid temperature at entrance T_out = bulk fluid temperature at exit. Derive the average heat transfer coefficienth_avin terms of the local coefficienth_x.

Options:

A: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / 2\piR^ L]
B: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / (T_s -T_av)]
C: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_xdx} / (T_s - T_av)]
D: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)^2dx} / (T_s - T_av)]
E: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / (T_s + T_av)]
F: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / (T_in - T_out)]
G: h_av= [{^L\int_0(h_x + T)dx} / (T_s - T_av)]

I: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s + T)dx} / (T_s -T_av)]
J: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / L]

Okay, so I've got this question about forced convection in a pipe, and I'm supposed to find the average heat transfer coefficient h_av in terms of the local coefficient h_x. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, first, I remember that the heat transfer rate in convection is given by Newton's law of cooling. For a pipe, the local heat transfer rate at a point x along the pipe would be q_x = h_x * A * (T_s - T_x), where A is the surface area at that point. Since we're dealing with a pipe, the surface area element would be the circumference times a small length dx, so A = 2πR dx, where R is the radius.

So, the local heat flux is dq = h_x * 2πR dx (T_s - T_x).

To find the total heat transfer rate over the entire length L of the pipe, I need to integrate dq from x=0 to x=L. So integrating both sides:

Q_total = ∫ (from 0 to L) h_x * 2πR (T_s - T_x) dx.

But we need the average heat transfer coefficient, h_av. The average would relate the total heat transfer to the average temperature difference. So, the average Q is also equal to h_av times the average temperature difference times the total surface area.

The average temperature difference is given as (T_s - T)_av = [(T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out)] / 2. Wait, because T_in is the inlet temperature and T_out is the outlet, so T_av is just the average of the two ends.

So, the total surface area of the pipe is 2πR L. Therefore, the average heat transfer equation is:

Q_total = h_av * (T_s - T_av) * 2πR L.

But wait, I have Q_total from the integration as well. So setting them equal:

h_av * (T_s - T_av) * 2πR L = ∫ (from 0 to L) h_x * 2πR (T_s - T_x) dx.

Hmm, okay, I can cancel out the 2πR from both sides. That leaves:

h_av * (T_s - T_av) * L = ∫ (from 0 to L) h_x (T_s - T_x) dx.

So solving for h_av:

h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx ] / [ (T_s - T_av) * L ].

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that some have the integral divided by (T_s - T_av), others by L or other terms. Let me check the options again.

Option C says h_av is the integral of h_x dx over (T_s - T_av). So that would be ∫h_x dx / (T_s - T_av). But in my derivation, I have ∫h_x (T_s - T_x) dx divided by [ (T_s - T_av) * L ].

Wait, that doesn't match option C. Hmm. Let me re-express my result. From the equation:

h_av = [ (1/(L (T_s - T_av)) ) * ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx ].

Alternatively, h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ) ].

Looking at the options, none of them directly match this yet. Let me see the options again:

Option B: ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx / (T_s - T_av).

Wait, but wait in the problem statement, T is the bulk fluid temperature. So in the integral, it's T(x), which varies along the pipe.

Wait, in my expression, the denominator is L*(T_s - T_av). So in the options, I'm looking for something like [ integral h_x (T_s - T) dx ] divided by [ L*(T_s - T_av) ].

But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let's look again:

Option C: [ ∫ h_x dx ] / (T_s - T_av).

No, because the integral in C doesn't have (T_s - T) as part of the integrand. So that can't be right because the integrand should include (T_s - T_x).

Option H: [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ (T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out) ) ].

Because (T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out) ) equals 2 (T_s - T_av), since T_av is the average of (T_in and T_out). So denominator becomes 2(T_s - T_av).

So the option H would be [ integral h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [2 (T_s - T_av) ].

But in my expression, the denominator is L (T_s - T_av), so it's different.

Hmm. Am I missing something? Let me think again.

Wait, in my derivation, I had:

h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ) ].

Which can be written as [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx / L ] / (T_s - T_av).

But none of the options have the average (T_s - T) term divided by L. Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C is ( ∫ h_x dx ) / (T_s - T_av). But no (T_s - T) in the integral.

Option J: [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / L. But that's missing division by (T_s - T_av).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-derive the average h.

The average heat transfer coefficient is defined such that Q = h_av A ΔT_av.

Where A is the total area, which is 2πRL.

Q is also the integral of the local heat transfer: ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) * 2πR dx from 0 to L.

So equate the two:

h_av * 2πR L (T_s - T_av) = ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) 2πR dx.

Cancel 2πR on both sides:

h_av L (T_s - T_av) = ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx.

So h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ].

Hmm. So that's the correct expression. Now, looking at the options, I don't see this exact expression.

Wait, let's check if any option can be rewritten to match. Let me see:

Looking at option B: [∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av).

Which would make h_av = [∫ ... ] / (ΔT_avg). But from my derivation, I have:

h_av = [∫ ... ] / [ L * ΔT_avg ].

So option B is missing the division by L.

Option J: [∫ ... ] / L. But it's missing division by ΔT_avg.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of average temperature. Let me double-check.

The average temperature difference is given as (T_s - T)_av = [ (T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out) ] / 2.

Which is [2 T_s - (T_in + T_out)] / 2 = (2 T_s - T_in - T_out)/2.

Wait, that's correct. So T_s - T_av is [ (T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out) ] / 2.

So, I think my earlier derivation is correct.

Looking again at the options, none of them seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option H is [∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ (T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out) ) ].

Which is the same as [∫ ... ] / [2 (T_s - T_avg) ].

So:

h_av = [ ∫ ... ] / [ 2 (T_s - T_avg) ].

But according to my derivation, h_av is [∫ ... ] / [ L (T_s - T_avg) ].

So unless L is 2, which it's not necessarily, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area. Let me think again about the total area.

Wait, the area A is 2πRL. So in the Q equation:

Q = h_av * A * (T_s - T_avg).

Which is h_av * 2πRL (T_s - T_avg).

And Q is also the integral of h_x (T_s - T_x) 2πR dx from 0 to L.

So:

h_av * 2πRL (ΔT_avg) = 2πR ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx.

Cancel 2πR:

h_av L (ΔT_avg) = ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx.

So h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T_x) dx ] / [ L (ΔT_avg) ].

Looking at the options, none of them have L in the denominator except perhaps option J, but option J is ∫ / L without the ΔT_avg.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the definition of h_av.

Alternatively, perhaps the average h is defined as the integral of h_x over the length, divided by the average (T_s - T) and something else.

Wait another approach: The average heat transfer coefficient is given by h_av = (1/L) ∫ h_x dx only when the temperature difference is constant. But in this problem, (T_s - T) varies, so h_av depends on both the variation of h_x and (T_s - T).

In the given scenario, the average is based on the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx, divided by the integral of (T_s - T) dx. Wait, that might be another approach. Let me think.

Wait, dimensional analysis: h_av has units of W/(m²·K). The integral ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx would have units (W/(m²·K)) * K * m = W/(m·K). Then we need to divide by something with units m·K to get h_av in W/(m²·K).

Wait, no, better to think in terms of the definition.

The average can be considered as the integrated heat flux divided by the average temperature difference and the area.

Wait, another approach: The total heat transfer Q is the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dA, where dA = 2πR dx. So,

Q = ∫ (from 0 to L) h_x (T_s - T) 2πR dx.

The average h_av is such that Q = h_av * (T_s - T_av) * A_total.

So,

h_av = Q / [ (T_s - T_av) * A_total ].

Which is:

h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) 2πR dx ] / [ (T_s - T_av) * 2πR L ].

Simplify:

h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ (T_s - T_avg) * L ].

So again, same result. So the expression for h_av is:

h_av = [ ∫₀ᴸ h_x (T_s - T(x)) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_avg) ]

Looking at the options, I need to find an option that represents this.

Looking through the options again, I don't see any that match exactly. Wait, let me check each option.

Option B: integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx divided by (T_s - T_avg). So [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (ΔT_avg).

But in my expression, it's [ ∫ ... dx ] / [ L ΔT_avg ].

So option B is missing the division by L.

Option J: [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / L. So it's missing division by ΔT_avg.

Hmm, so none of the options directly match. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the average is taken differently. For average heat transfer coefficient when (T_s - T) varies, the correct average is:

h_avg = [ ∫₀ᴸ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ ∫₀ᴸ (T_s - T) dx ].

But wait, that doesn't seem to align with the options either.

Wait, checking the definition again: we have the average temperature difference as (T_s - T_avg). So when we write Q = h_avg * A * (T_s - T_avg), then:

h_avg = Q / [A (T_s - T_avg)].

But Q is ∫ h_x (T_s - T) A_x dx, where A_x = 2πR dx.

So,

h_avg = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) 2πR dx ] / [ 2πR L (T_s - T_avg) ) ].

Cancel 2πR,

h_avg = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_avg) ].

So I'm confident that this is the correct expression. Now, looking at the options, I don't see this exact option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me look again.

Option C: [ ∫ h_x dx ] / (T_s - T_avg).

No, because it's missing (T_s - T) in the integrand.

Option B: [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_avg). But in my expression, there's a division by L as well, so this would be correct only if L=1, which it's not.

Wait, perhaps the integral includes the entire length, so maybe the denominator doesn't have L? No, in the denominator, after cancellation, we have L.

Wait, perhaps the actual average h is just the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx divided by the integral of (T_s - T) dx. Because sometimes average is defined as ∫ f(x) g(x) dx / ∫ g(x) dx.

If that's the case, then h_avg = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ ∫ (T_s - T) dx ].

But in our case, since we have a specific average temperature difference defined as (T_s - T_avg), which is a specific value, not an integral.

Wait, perhaps the given (T_s - T_avg) is the average of (T_s - T_in) and (T_s - T_out), i.e., (T_s - T_avg) = [(T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out)] / 2.

So, (T_s - T_avg) = [2 T_s - T_in - T_out ] / 2.

But in this case, perhaps the correct option is B, because it's [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_avg).

But according to our derivation, it's [ ∫ ... ] / [ L (T_s - T_avg) ].

So unless in the problem, L=1, but that's not indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Maybe the average heat transfer coefficient is defined as the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx divided by the integral of (T_s - T) dx.

In that case, since the average (T_s - T_avg) is given as a constant, then:

∫ (T_s - T) dx over the pipe is (T_s - T_avg) * L.

So h_avg would be [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ ∫ (T_s - T) dx ].

Which is [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ (T_s - T_avg) * L ].

Which again brings me back to the same expression.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct one is B, but it's missing the L in the denominator. Or maybe option C is incorrect because it's missing the (T_s - T) in the integrand.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about units.

h_avg has units of W/(m²·K).

The integral in the numerator of option B is ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx. h_x is W/(m² K), (T_s - T) is K, dx is m. So units: (W/(m² K)) * K * m = W/m.

Denominator in option B is (T_s - T_avg), which is K.

So overall, units become (W/m) / K = W/(m K). Which is not matching h_avg units.

Wait, that can't be right. So option B's units are wrong for h_avg.

Hmm, my expression for h_avg is [ ∫ ... dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_avg) ].

Integral has units W/m, denominator has m * K, so overall units (W/m) / (m K) ) = W/(m² K), which is correct.

Looking at the options, let's check the units.

Option B: [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_avg).

Integral is W/m, denominator is K. So units are (W/m)/K = W/(m K), which is incorrect. So option B can't be correct.

Option J: [ ∫ ... dx ] / L. Units: (W/m) / m = W/m², which isn't correct either.

Option C: [ ∫ h_x dx ] / (T_s - T_avg). Integral has units (W/(m² K)) * m = W/(m K). Divided by K gives W/(m K²), which is wrong.

Option H: [ ∫ ... dx ] / [ (T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out) ].

Denominator is K + K = 2K. So integral (W/m) / (2K) → W/(2 m K), which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. Let me think about the definition of average heat transfer
