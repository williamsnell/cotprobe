Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about solubility in water. Hmm, I remember that solubility rules are key here. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which compound is least soluble in water. The options are A through I. So, I need to recall the solubility rules I learned. I think most nitrates are soluble, same with Group 1 metal salts. Also, sulfates and chlorides are usually soluble, but there are exceptions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Cu(OH)₂. Copper hydroxide. I remember that hydroxides are generally insoluble except for Group 1 and some others like Ca, Sr, Ba. So Cu(OH)₂ is probably not soluble.

Option B: Zn(NO3)₂. Zinc nitrate. Nitrates are almost always soluble, so this should dissolve well in water.

Option C: NiSO3. Nickel sulfite. Wait, sulfites? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Sulfites are usually soluble in water, except for some like those of Ba, Pb, Ca, Sr, maybe. Nickel is a transition metal, so NiSO3 might be less soluble. Wait, but I'm not certain about sulfites. Alternatively, I might be confusing sulfites with sulfides, which are generally insoluble.

Option D: MgCl2. Magnesium chloride. Chlorides are mostly soluble except when with Ag, Pb, or Hg. MgCl2 is definitely soluble.

Option E: Mn(NO3)2. Manganese nitrate. Again, nitrate, so soluble.

Option F: FeSO4. Iron (II) sulfate. Sulfates are usually soluble except for some metals like Ba, Pb, Ca, Sr maybe. Iron is in the transition metals, but I think FeSO4 is soluble. Wait, but isn't Fe(OH)2 not soluble? Oh wait, that's hydroxide. FeSO4 should be soluble.

Option G: CrCl3. Chromium chloride. Chlorides are generally soluble, but wait, Cr is a transition metal. Does that matter? I think most transition metal chlorides are soluble, except maybe some. For example, AgCl is not soluble. But chromium chloride, like CrCl3, I think is soluble in water. Or maybe not? Wait, another thought: sometimes higher charged ions can form hydroxides. Like AlCl3 is soluble but might hydrolyze in water. But overall, I think CrCl3 is soluble.

Option H: NaBr. Sodium bromide. Na is group 1, so all sodium salts are soluble. So this should be very soluble.

Option I: KI. Potassium iodide. Same as above, group 1 cation, so very soluble.

Now, which of these is least soluble. Let's recap.

Looking for the insoluble ones. So, the likely candidates are A (Cu(OH)₂) and C (NiSO3) if sulfites are less soluble.

Wait, but sulfites: the solubility rules say that sulfites of alkali and alkaline earth metals are soluble. Others are not. So, Ni is a transition metal, so NiSO3 is probably insoluble.

So between A and C. Which is less soluble? Wait, another point: hydroxide solubility. Cu(OH)₂ is definitely insoluble in water. How about NiSO3? I'm not as sure about sulfites. Alternatively, I might have this wrong. Wait, another approach: looking at common compounds. For example, BaSO3 is not very soluble, but I think sulfites might be more soluble than hydroxides.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solubility product (Ksp). Hydroxides of transition metals tend to have very low Ksp, making them insoluble. So Cu(OH)₂ would have a low Ksp. What about NiSO3? Hmm, I don't remember the exact Ksp values, but I think that sulfites are generally more soluble than hydroxides. Or maybe not? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another angle. Let me go through each option.

A: Cu(OH)₂ – hydroxide, insoluble.

B: Zn(NO3)₂ – nitrate, soluble.

C: NiSO3 – sulfite. I'm not too sure about this. Maybe sulfites are sparingly soluble. For example, calcium sulfite is not very soluble. So NiSO3 might be less soluble than the others except A.

D: MgCl2 – soluble.

E: Mn(NO3)₂ – soluble.

F: FeSO4 – soluble.

G: CrCl3 – I think this is soluble but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe some chloride exceptions, but Cr isn't one of them. So probably soluble.

H: NaBr – very soluble.

I: KI – very soluble.

So, the least soluble would be the one that's not soluble. So between A and C.

Wait, another point: I think that hydroxides are generally less soluble than sulfites. Or is it the other way around? For example, CaSO3 is not very soluble, but Ca(OH)2 is also not very soluble but maybe more than sulfites.

Alternatively, I might be mixing sulfites with sulfates. Oh wait, no. Sulfates are SO4^2-, sulfites are SO3^2-.

Wait, perhaps for NiSO3, considering it's a sulfite, and if the cation is a transition metal, it might not be very soluble. So if A is Cu(OH)₂, which I know is insoluble, and C is NiSO3, which is probably insoluble as well. Comparing the two, which is less soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps looking for the most insoluble. I think that hydroxides like Cu(OH)₂ are typically less soluble than sulfites of transition metals. So Cu(OH)₂ would be the least soluble.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about NiSO3. Nickel is Ni²+; sulfite is SO3²-. So the formula would be NiSO3. Let me think about the solubility of similar compounds. For example, MgSO3 is soluble because Mg is group 2, but Ni is a transition metal. So NiSO3 is probably insoluble.

So between A and C, which is less soluble.

Wait, another approach: checking common compounds. For example, copper hydroxide is known to be insoluble in water. Nickel sulfite? I'm less certain. Maybe nickel sulfite is more soluble than copper hydroxide. Or perhaps less.

Alternatively, perhaps NiSO3 is more soluble in water than Cu(OH)₂. So the least soluble would be Cu(OH)₂.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Another thought: sulfites might be more soluble than hydroxides because they have a smaller charge? No, the charge is the same (SO3^2- and OH⁻, but when in compounds, the pairing is with cations).

Alternatively, perhaps copper hydroxide is less soluble than nickel sulfite.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the options. The other options are all soluble except A, C, and maybe G.

Wait, about CrCl3: I think that most chloride salts are soluble, but I seem to recall that some transition metal chlorides are less soluble, but maybe not. For example, AgCl is not soluble, but others like FeCl3 are soluble. So CrCl3 is probably soluble.

So, the least soluble is either A or C.

So which one is it?

If I had to choose between the two, I'd say Cu(OH)₂ is less soluble than NiSO3.

Wait, another thought: sulfites might decompose in water. Or perhaps they're not as commonly insoluble as hydroxides. I'm a bit shaky here, but I think that hydroxides of transition metals are generally more insoluble than their sulfites.

So, the answer should be option A: Cu(OH)₂.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The question is which is the least soluble. So the least soluble would be the one that's insoluble, which is A and C. Now, I'm to pick the least among them.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake and NiSO3 is more soluble than Cu(OH)₂.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solubility of the sulfites. For example, sodium sulfite is Na2SO3, which is soluble. Magnesium sulfite is MgSO3, which is not very soluble. Wait, no, I think MgSO3 is actually sparingly soluble. So for NiSO3, which is a transition metal sulfite, it's likely to be insoluble.

So if both A and C are insoluble, which is the least soluble. Comparing Ksp values might help. I don't remember exact numbers, but I think that hydroxides of transition metals have very low solubility. For example, Cu(OH)₂ has a Ksp around 1.6e-19, which is very low. As for NiSO3, I don't have the exact Ksp, but sulfites may have higher Ksp than hydroxides, meaning they're more soluble. So between Cu(OH)₂ and NiSO3, the copper hydroxide is less soluble.

So the least soluble would be Cu(OH)₂, option A.

To determine which compound is least soluble in water, we analyze the solubility of each option based on solubility rules and properties of the compounds:

1. **Option A: Cu(OH)₂**  
   Hydroxides are generally insoluble except for those of Group 1 metals and some Group 2 metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, Ba). Cu(OH)₂, a transition metal hydroxide, is known to be insoluble in water, with a very low solubility product (Ksp ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹).

2. **Option B: Zn(NO₃)₂**  
   Nitrates are almost always soluble in water. Therefore, Zn(NO₃)₂ is highly soluble.

3. **Option C: NiSO₃**  
   Sulfites (SO₃²⁻) are generally soluble for alkali and alkaline earth metals but are often insoluble for transition metals. NiSO₃, being a transition metal sulfite, is likely insoluble. However, sulfites may have slightly higher solubility than hydroxides, as they are less prone to forming strongly insoluble compounds.

4. **Option D: MgCl₂**  
   Chlorides are typically soluble in water, with exceptions for compounds like AgCl, PbCl₂, and Hg₂Cl₂. MgCl₂ is highly soluble.

5. **Option E: Mn(NO₃)₂**  
   Similar to Zn(NO₃)₂, nitrates are highly soluble, so Mn(NO₃)₂ dissolves readily in water.

6. **Option F: FeSO₄**  
   Sulfates are generally soluble, with exceptions for BaSO₄, PbSO₄, and CaSO₄. FeSO₄ is soluble in water.

7. **Option G: CrCl₃**  
   Chlorides of most transition metals, including CrCl₃, are soluble in water, though some may hydrolyze.

8. **Option H: NaBr**  
   Sodium salts are always soluble, so NaBr is highly soluble.

9. **Option I: KI**  
   Potassium salts are also always soluble, making KI highly soluble.

**Comparison of the least soluble compounds (A and C):**  
Both Cu(OH)₂ and NiSO₃ are insoluble in water. However, hydroxides like Cu(OH)₂ generally have much lower solubility products (Ksp) compared to sulfites, indicating that Cu(OH)₂ is less soluble than NiSO₃. Thus, **Cu(OH)₂** is the least soluble compound among the options.

**Answer: A**
