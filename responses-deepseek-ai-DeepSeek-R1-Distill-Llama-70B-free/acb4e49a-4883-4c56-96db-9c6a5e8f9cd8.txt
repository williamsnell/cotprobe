Question:

A security guard had a license to carry a concealed handgun. One day, he was walking past a barber shop when he saw his friend inside getting a haircut. The security guard knew that the barber, an elderly man, had a history of significant heart problems. The security guard decided to play a joke on his friend. The security guard took out his gun, burst through the door of the barber shop, pointed the gun at the friend, and shouted, "Don't move or I'll shoot!" The barber, thinking that an armed intruder was about to shoot the friend, suffered a heart attack and collapsed. If the barber brings suit against the security guard for infliction of emotional distress and seeks recovery for damages arising from the heart attack, he should

Options:

A: prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present.
B: not prevail, because the security guard did not physically harm the barber.
C: not prevail, because the barber was not a member of the friend's immediate family.
D: not prevail, because the barber had a pre-existing health condition.
E: prevail, because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.
F: prevail, because the security guard assaulted the friend.
G: prevail, because the security guard's actions were negligent and reckless.
H: prevail, because the security guard's actions caused the barber severe emotional distress.
I: not prevail, because the resulting harm was unforeseeable.
J: not prevail, because the security guard didn't directly target the barber.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with intentional infliction of emotional distress. Hmm, I remember that intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires certain elements. Let me think through this step by step.

The scenario is about a security guard who has a license to carry a concealed handgun. He sees his friend in a barber shop and decides to play a joke. He takes out his gun, bursts in, points it at his friend, and shouts not to move or he'll shoot. The barber, who has a history of heart problems, thinks there's an armed intruder about to shoot and has a heart attack. Now, the barber is suing the guard for emotional distress damages.

So the question is, will the barber prevail? The options are from A to J. Let me try to break down the elements of IIED.

First, IIED requires that the defendant's actions were intentional or reckless. The guard intended to play a joke, so he probably knew pointing a gun would cause fear. But was it directed at the barber? The guard was aiming at his friend, not the barber. So maybe the guard didn't intend to harm the barber, but his actions still caused the barber distress.

Next, the conduct must be extreme and outrageous. Pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot seems extreme. Even if it was a joke, the act could still be considered outrageous because it's a serious threat.

Then, the action must cause emotional distress. The barber suffered a heart attack, which is a physical manifestation of severe emotional distress. So that part is covered.

But wait, there's another element: the distress must be severe. A heart attack is definitely severe, so that's met.

Another point is whether the guard could have foreseen that his actions would cause this kind of harm. The guard knew the barber was present (option A mentions that). He also knew the barber had heart problems, as stated in the question. So the guard should have anticipated that such a frightening act could cause the barber serious harm.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the barber will prevail because the guard knew he was present. That makes sense because the guard was aware of the barber's presence, so he should have known the potential harm.

Option E says the guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful. That's true, but the key is whether those actions were directed towards the barber. The guard intended to scare his friend, not the barber. So maybe IIED requires that the actions were directed at the plaintiff.

Wait, in IIED, the defendant's actions must be directed at the plaintiff, or the plaintiff must have been in the zone of danger. Here, the barber was in the shop, so he was in the zone of danger created by the guard's actions. So maybe that's enough.

But another thought: for IIED, the defendant must have intended to cause severe emotional distress, or know that it's substantially certain to result. Did the guard intend to cause distress to the barber? Probably not. He intended to play a joke on his friend. But he knew the barber was there and had heart issues. So perhaps his actions were reckless regarding the barber's presence.

Wait, there's also the concept of negligence. If the guard was reckless, maybe it's a case of negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), but that usually requires a different analysis, like being in a zone of physical impact or for a duty owed.

Wait, but the question is about IIED, which is intentional. So the guard's act was intentional towards his friend, not the barber. But the barber was a bystander who was terrorized by the same action.

In some cases, bystanders can recover for IIED if they are directly affected by the defendant's actions. But typically, IIED requires that the conduct was intended to cause distress in the plaintiff. Here, the guard intended to cause fear in his friend, but the barber's distress was a foreseeable consequence.

Another angle: The guard's actions were so outrageous that they go beyond the bounds of decency. Pointing a gun and threatening to shoot, even as a joke, is pretty extreme. So maybe the court would find that the guard's behavior meets the 'extreme and outrageous' standard.

Looking at the options again, option E says the guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful. That seems to fit because the act was intended to frighten, even if not specifically targeting the barber.

But wait, does IIED require that the defendant intended to cause distress to the specific plaintiff? Or is it enough that the actions were so extreme that they would cause distress to anyone present, and the defendant knew people were present?

I think the latter is possible. So the guard knew the barber was there, and his actions were extreme enough that it's foreseeable that someone with a heart condition would be severely distressed.

So in that case, the guard's actions would be considered intentional towards causing distress to those present, including the barber.

Looking at the options, option A says the barber prevails because the guard knew he was present. Option E says because the actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.

Alternatively, option J says the guard didn't directly target the barber, so he doesn't prevail. But IIED doesn't necessarily require direct targeting if the plaintiff was in the zone of danger and the distress was foreseeable.

So between options A and E. Option A focuses on the guard's knowledge of the barber's presence. Option E on the nature of the actions.

Another point: The guard had a license, but that doesn't excuse reckless behavior. His joke was reckless because he knew the barber had heart issues.

So, putting it all together, the barber should prevail because the guard's actions were extreme, intentional, and the guard knew the barber was present, making the resulting distress foreseeable.

Looking at the options again:

A: Prevail because guard knew barber was present.

E: Prevail because actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.

Which is the better fit? I think A is a correct point, but IIED might require more than just presence. The guard's actions were directed at the friend, but the barber was in the vicinity. So maybe it's about whether the guard's actions were intended to cause distress to the barber or whether the barber's presence made the distress foreseeable.

In some jurisdictions, for IIED, the plaintiff need not be the intended target, but the defendant's actions must be such that they knew or should have known that the plaintiff would suffer distress. So if the guard knew the barber was there and had heart problems, he could foresee the distress.

Therefore, the guard's actions would be extreme and outrageous, and the distress to the barber was foreseeable. So the barber should prevail.

Looking at the options, A says the guard knew the barber was present, which supports foreseeability. E says the actions were intentionally frightening and harmful, which is also correct.

Wait, but the guard intended to frighten his friend, not the barber. So while the actions were intentional towards the friend, the effect on the barber was foreseeable but not intended. So maybe IIED isn't the right claim because the intent wasn't towards the barber. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of recklessness as to the barber's presence and condition.

Hmm, maybe the correct theory here is negligence, but the question is about IIED. So if the guard's actions were so extreme that they were intended to cause fear in anyone present, then IIED applies.

Alternatively, maybe the guard's actions constituted assault towards the friend, but the barber's claim is derivative. But the question is about IIED, not about the friend's claim.

Wait, another point: The guard's act could also be seen as an assault on the friend. But for the barber, it's about being a bystander who suffers emotional distress as a result. But for IIED, I think the key is that the defendant's actions were directed at the plaintiff or that the plaintiff was in the zone of physical danger.

In this case, the barber was in the same room when the guard pulled the gun and shouted. So he was in the zone of danger, making his distress foreseeable.

So under the theory that the barber was in the zone of danger, he can recover for IIED even if he wasn't the intended target.

So the elements are met: intentional (and extreme) act, causing severe distress, and the barber was in the zone of danger.

So looking back at the options, option A says he prevails because the guard knew he was present. Option E says because the actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.

I think the correct answer is A because the guard knew the barber was present, making the distress foreseeable. But I'm a bit confused between A and E.

Wait, another thought: IIED requires that the defendant's conduct was intended to cause emotional distress, or that it was so reckless that it's considered the same as intent. So if the guard intended to cause fear in his friend, but was reckless regarding the barber's presence and heart condition, does that suffice?

In that case, the guard's actions were intentional towards the friend, but reckless towards the barber. So maybe IIED doesn't apply because the intent wasn't towards the barber. But if the guard was reckless towards the barber's foreseeable harm, then perhaps it's IIED.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions allow IIED claims when the defendant's actions were so extreme that they recklessly disregard the risk of causing emotional distress to another.

In that case, the guard's actions would qualify as extreme and outrageous, and the barber's presence and condition made the distress foreseeable. So the guard acted recklessly towards the barber, which could satisfy the intent requirement for IIED.

So the answer would be A, because the guard knew the barber was present, which made the harm foreseeable. Alternatively, E, because the actions were intentionally harmful.

Wait, but the guard didn't intend to harm the barber. He intended to prank his friend. So the intent was towards the friend, but the effect on the barber was a foreseeable result. So perhaps the guard's actions were reckless regarding the barber's well-being, which could support an IIED claim.

In that case, the answer would be A, as the guard knew the barber was there, making the distress foreseeable.

Alternatively, some might argue that the guard's actions were so extreme that intent towards the friend is enough, but I think the key is that the barber was present and known to the guard.

So I'm leaning towards option A as the correct answer.

To determine whether the barber will prevail in his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against the security guard, we must analyze the elements of IIED and how they apply to the facts.

### Elements of IIED:
1. **Intentional or Reckless Conduct**: The defendant's actions must be intentional or reckless.
2. **Extreme and Outrageous Conduct**: The conduct must be extreme and outrageous, going beyond the bounds of decency.
3. **Causation**: The conduct must cause severe emotional distress.
4. **Foreseeability**: The defendant must have known or could have reasonably foreseen that their actions would cause severe emotional distress to the plaintiff.

### Application to the Case:
- The security guard intentionally pulled out his gun, pointed it at his friend, and shouted a threatening statement. While the guard's intent was to play a joke on his friend, his actions were extreme and outrageous, as pointing a gun and threatening to shoot is inherently frightening and dangerous.
- The barber, who had a history of heart problems, was present in the barber shop and was directly exposed to the guard's actions. The guard knew the barber was present, and given the barber's known medical condition, the guard could have foreseen that such actions might cause the barber severe emotional distress.
- The barber suffered a heart attack as a result of the guard's actions, which constitutes severe physical harm caused by the emotional distress.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: "Prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present."  
  This is correct because the guard's knowledge of the barber's presence makes the resulting emotional distress foreseeable. The guard's actions were extreme and outrageous, and the barber's harm was a foreseeable consequence.

- **Option E**: "Prevail, because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful."  
  While the guard's actions were intentionally frightening, they were specifically directed at the friend, not the barber. However, the guard's recklessness regarding the barber's presence and medical condition could still satisfy the intent requirement for IIED.

- **Other Options**:  
  - **Option B**: Incorrect because physical harm is not required for IIED; severe emotional distress is sufficient.  
  - **Option C**: Incorrect because IIED does not require the plaintiff to be a member of the immediate family.  
  - **Option D**: Incorrect because the barber's pre-existing heart condition does not bar recovery; it makes the harm foreseeable.  
  - **Option F**: Incorrect because the guard's actions constituted assault against the friend, but the barber's claim is based on IIED.  
  - **Option G**: Incorrect because negligence is not the standard for IIED; the guard's actions were intentional or reckless.  
  - **Option H**: Incorrect because while the guard's actions caused severe emotional distress, this option does not address foreseeability or the extreme nature of the conduct.  
  - **Option I**: Incorrect because the harm was foreseeable given the guard's knowledge of the barber's presence and medical condition.  
  - **Option J**: Incorrect because the guard's actions created a zone of danger that included the barber, making direct targeting unnecessary.

### Conclusion:
The barber should prevail because the security guard knew the barber was present, making the resulting emotional distress foreseeable. The guard's actions were extreme and outrageous, satisfying the elements of IIED.
