Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the curvature of a vector function at a specific point. The function is given as r(t) = 5cos(t)i + 4sin(t)j + 3tk, and I need to find the curvature when t is 4π/3. The options are A through J, with numerical values provided.

Hmm, I remember that curvature, κ (kappa), for a vector function r(t) is calculated using a specific formula. I think the formula involves the cross product of the first and second derivatives of r(t). Oh right, the formula is κ = |r'(t) × r''(t)| / |r'(t)|³.

So the plan is to find the first and second derivatives of r(t), compute their cross product, find the magnitude of that cross product, and then divide by the magnitude of r'(t) cubed.

Let me start by finding r'(t) and r''(t).

The function r(t) has three components:
- The i-component is 5cos(t). The derivative of cos(t) is -sin(t), so r'(t) for i is -5sin(t).
- The j-component is 4sin(t). The derivative of sin(t) is cos(t), so r'(t) for j is 4cos(t).
- The k-component is 3t. The derivative of t is 1, so r'(t) for k is 3.

So putting it together, r'(t) = (-5sin(t))i + (4cos(t))j + 3k.

Now, the second derivative r''(t) would be the derivative of r'(t):
- The derivative of -5sin(t) is -5cos(t) (since the derivative of sin is cos).
- The derivative of 4cos(t) is -4sin(t) (because the derivative of cos is -sin).
- The derivative of 3 is 0.

So r''(t) = (-5cos(t))i + (-4sin(t))j + 0k.

Next, I need to compute the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t). The cross product is calculated using the determinant method.

Let me denote r'(t) as (a, b, c) = (-5sin(t), 4cos(t), 3)
And r''(t) as (d, e, f) = (-5cos(t), -4sin(t), 0)

The cross product r' × r'' will have components:

i component: b*f - c*e = (4cos(t)*0) - (3*(-4sin(t))) = 0 + 12sin(t) = 12 sin(t)
j component: c*d - a*f = (3*(-5cos(t))) - (-5sin(t)*0) = -15 cos(t) - 0 = -15 cos(t)
k component: a*e - b*d = (-5sin(t))*(-4sin(t)) - (4cos(t))*(-5cos(t)) 
Let me compute that: (20 sin²(t)) - (-20 cos²(t)) → 20 sin²(t) + 20 cos²(t) = 20 (sin² t + cos² t) = 20 * 1 = 20.

Wait, did I get the signs right for the components? Let me double-check the cross product formula. The cross product of vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is:

( a2b3 - a3b2 , a3b1 - a1b3 , a1b2 - a2b1 )

So for i component: a2b3 - a3b2 = (4cos(t))(0) - (3)(-4 sin(t)) → 0 +12 sin(t) → correct.

j component: a3b1 - a1b3 = (3)(-5 cos(t)) - (-5 sin(t))(0) → -15 cos(t) - 0 → correct.

k component: a1b2 - a2b1 = (-5 sin(t))(-4 sin(t)) - (4 cos(t))(-5 cos(t)) → 20 sin²(t) + 20 cos²(t) → yes, 20(sin² + cos²) = 20.

So the cross product vector is (12 sin(t))i - 15 cos(t) j + 20k.

Now, I need the magnitude of this cross product. The magnitude is sqrt[ (12 sin(t))² + (-15 cos(t))² + (20)^2 ]

Calculating each term:
(12 sin t)^2 = 144 sin² t
(-15 cos t)^2 = 225 cos² t
20^2 = 400.

So the magnitude is sqrt(144 sin² t + 225 cos² t + 400).

Wait, but wait. The curvature formula is |r' × r''| divided by |r'|^3. So I also need to find |r'(t)|.

Let me compute |r'(t)| first. r'(t) is (-5 sin t, 4 cos t, 3). So its magnitude is sqrt[ (-5 sin t)^2 + (4 cos t)^2 + 3^2 ] = sqrt[25 sin² t + 16 cos² t + 9].

So |r'(t)|^3 is [sqrt(25 sin² t + 16 cos² t + 9)]^3.

But perhaps I can compute all this when t is 4π/3. Let me plug in t = 4π/3, which is 240 degrees.

At t = 4π/3, sin(t) is sin(240°) = -√3/2. Cos(t) is cos(240°) = -1/2.

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute r'(t) at t=4π/3:

r'(t) = (-5 sin t)i + 4 cos t j +3k.

sin t = -√3/2 → -5*(-√3/2) = (5√3)/2.

cos t = -1/2 → 4*(-1/2) = -2.

So r'(t) at this point is (5√3/2)i - 2j +3k.

Then, r''(t) is (-5 cos t)i -4 sin t j.

cos t = -1/2 → -5*(-1/2)=5/2.

sin t = -√3/2 → -4*(-√3/2)= 2√3.

So r''(t) is (5/2)i + 2√3 j.

Now, the cross product r' × r''.

Wait wait, perhaps I should compute the cross product using the numerical values at t=4π/3. Alternatively, I could compute the symbolic expressions and then substitute. Maybe it's easier to compute the cross product using the t=4π/3 values.

r'(t) at t=4π/3 is (5√3/2, -2, 3).

r''(t) is (5/2, 2√3, 0).

So the cross product is:

|i          j          k          |
|5√3/2    -2          3          |
|5/2     2√3         0          |

Compute the determinant:

i [ (-2)(0) - (3)(2√3) ] - j [ (5√3/2)(0) - (3)(5/2) ] + k [ (5√3/2)(2√3) - (-2)(5/2) ]

Let me compute each component:

i component: ( (-2)*0 - 3*(2√3) ) → 0 -6√3 → -6√3. So i * (-6√3).

j component: ( (5√3/2)*0 - 3*(5/2) ) → 0 - 15/2 → -15/2. But since it's subtracted (because of the formula), it becomes -(-15/2) = +15/2. So j component is 15/2.

k component: (5√3/2)*(2√3) - (-2)*(5/2) → let me compute each term.

First term: (5√3/2)*(2√3) → 5√3 * √3 = 5*(3) =15. The 2 in denominator and 2 in numerator cancel each other, so it's 15.

Second term: (-2)*(5/2) = -5. But since it's subtracted, it's - ( -5 )= +5.

So k component: 15 +5 =20.

So the cross product vector is (-6√3)i + (15/2)j +20k.

Wait, wait! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the cross product calculation. Let me recheck. Because the cross product formula is:

i (r'_y * r''_z - r'_z * r''_y ) 
- j (r'_x * r''_z - r'_z * r''_x )
+ k (r'_x * r''_y - r'_y * r''_x )

So more accurately, for r'=(a,b,c), r''=(d,e,f):

cross = (b f - c e)i - (a f - c d) j + (a e - b d)k.

So with r'(t) as (5√3/2, -2, 3) and r''(t) as (5/2, 2√3, 0):

i component: (-2)(0) - 3*(2√3) → 0 -6√3 = -6√3.

j component: -( (5√3/2)(0) - 3*(5/2) ) → - ( 0 - 15/2 ) → - ( -15/2 )= 15/2.

k component: (5√3/2)(2√3) - (-2)(5/2) → let's compute:

First term: 5√3/2 * 2√3 = (5 * 2) * (√3 * √3) ) / 2 → 10 * 3 /2 → 30/2=15.

Second term: (-2)*(5/2) = -5. So the k component becomes 15 - (-5) → 15 +5 =20.

So the cross product is (-6√3, 15/2, 20).

Now, the magnitude of this cross product is sqrt[ (-6√3)^2 + (15/2)^2 + 20^2 ].

Compute each term:

(-6√3)^2 = 36 *3=108.

(15/2)^2=225/4=56.25.

20^2=400.

So sum is 108 +56.25 +400 = 108+56.25=164.25 +400=564.25.

sqrt(564.25) → let's compute. 23^2=529, 24^2=576. So sqrt(564.25) is between 23 and 24. Let me calculate it.

23.7^2=561.69 → 23.7^2= (23 +0.7)^2= 23² + 2*23*0.7 +0.7²=529 +32.2 +0.49=561.69.

23.75^2= (23 + 0.75)^2 → 23^2=529; 2*23*0.75=34.5; 0.75^2=0.5625 → 529+34.5=563.5+0.5625=564.0625.

Wait, 23.75^2=564.0625, which is just 0.1875 less than 564.25. So sqrt(564.25)≈23.75 + (0.1875)/(2*23.75) → since derivative of x^2 is 2x, so delta x ≈ (delta)/(2x). So delta is 0.1875; x≈23.75. So delta_x≈0.1875/(2*23.75)=approx 0.1875/47.5≈0.003947.

So sqrt(564.25)≈23.75 + 0.003947≈23.754, approximately 23.754.

But perhaps I can compute it more precisely. Alternatively, perhaps I can just keep it as sqrt(564.25) for now.

Now, the denominator is |r'(t)|^3.

Compute |r'(t)| at t=4π/3: r'(t) is (5√3/2, -2, 3).

|r'(t)| = sqrt( (5√3/2)^2 + (-2)^2 +3^2 )

Compute each term:

(5√3/2)^2 = (25*3)/(4) = 75/4=18.75.

(-2)^2=4.

3^2=9.

So sum is 18.75 +4 +9=31.75.

So |r'(t)| = sqrt(31.75). Let me compute that. 5.6^2=31.36; 5.7^2=32.49. So sqrt(31.75) is approximately between 5.63 and 5.64.

Compute 5.63^2=31.6969 → 5.63^2= approx 31.6969.

5.635^2 = ?

(5.63 + 0.005)^2 =5.63^2 + 2*5.63*0.005 +0.005^2=31.6969 +0.0563 +0.000025≈31.7532. Which is very close to 31.75. So |r'(t)|≈5.635.

So |r'(t)|³ = (5.635)^3.

Compute 5^3=125. 5.6^3=5.6*5.6=31.36 → 31.36 *5.6= let's see:

31.36 *5=156.8; 31.36*0.6=18.816 → sum 175.616.

5.6^3=175.616.

Now, 5.635 is a bit higher than 5.6.

Compute 5.635^3:

5.6^3=175.616.

0.035 is the additional part. Let me think of it as 5.6 + 0.035=5.635.

Using binomial expansion:

(a + b)^3 ≈a^3 +3a²b +3ab² +b³.

a=5.6, b=0.035.

a³=175.616.

3a²b=3*(5.6)^2 *0.035 =3*(31.36)*0.035= 3*1.0976=3.2928.

3ab²=3*(5.6)*(0.035)^2= 16.8*(0.001225)= approx 0.02079.

b³=0.035^3=0.000042875.

So total ≈175.616 +3.2928=178.9088 +0.02079≈178.9296 +0.000042875≈178.9296.

So |r'(t)|³≈178.93.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute 5.635^3 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps exact fractions would be better, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

So the curvature κ is |cross| / |r'|^3.

|cross|= sqrt(564.25) ≈23.754.

So κ ≈23.754 / 178.9296.

Compute that division.

23.754 /178.9296 ≈ Let's see.

178.93 is about 179. 23.75/179 is roughly 0.1327.

But let me think more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

Compute 23.754 ÷ 178.93.

Let me write it as 23754 ÷178930.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 23.754 ÷178.93.

So 178.93 goes into 23.754 how many times? Well, it's less than 1, so 0. something.

Let me compute 178.93 * 0.13 = ?

0.1 *178.93=17.893.

0.03 *178.93=5.3679 → 17.893 +5.3679=23.2609.

So 0.13 gives 23.2609, but our numerator is 23.754, so the difference is 23.754-23.2609=0.4931.

Now, 0.4931 /178.93 ≈ 0.002753.

So total κ≈0.13 +0.002753≈0.13275.

So approximately 0.1328.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:0.13, option F:0.14, option D:0.15, etc. Wait, the options are:

A: 0.12

B: 0.13

C:0.20

D:0.15

E:0.18

F:0.14

G:0.16

H:0.19

I:0.25

J:0.22

So 0.1328 is approximately 0.13, which is option B.

But wait, perhaps I should check the calculations for any errors.

Let me recheck the cross product components:

At t=4pi/3, r'(t) = (5√3/2, -2,3), r''(t)=(5/2, 2√3, 0).

Cross product:

i component: (-2)(0) -3*(2√3) → 0 -6√3 → correct.

j component: -( (5√3/2)(0) -3*(5/2) ) → -(0 - 15/2) → 15/2 → correct.

k component: (5√3/2)(2√3) - (-2)(5/2) → (5√3 * 2√3)/2 - (-5) → (10*3)/2 +5 → 15 +5=20 → correct.

So cross product components are correct.

Magnitude of cross product: sqrt( ( -6√3 )² + (15/2)² +20² )

= sqrt( 108 + 225/4 +400 )

Convert 400=1600/4,
