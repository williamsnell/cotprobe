Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says: Consider two positive even integers less than 15. They don't have to be different. When the sum of these two numbers is added to their product, how many different possible values may result? The options are from A to J, with numbers like 18,21, etc.

Hmm. So, the key points are:

1. Two positive even integers. So each number is even and positive, so possible values are 2,4,6,... up to 14, because less than 15.

2. They can be the same, so for example, both 2, or 4 and 4, etc.

3. We're looking at the sum of the two numbers plus their product. So, if the numbers are a and b, the expression is (a + b) + (a * b). Wait, that can be rewritten as a + b + ab. Let me see if that's factorable. Oh yeah, a + b + ab is equal to (a+1)(b+1) - 1. Because (a+1)(b+1) is ab +a +b +1, so subtract 1 and you get a + b + ab. So the expression simplifies to (a+1)(b+1) -1.

That's a useful form because it might make it easier to compute the possible values.

So instead of calculating a + b + ab each time, I can compute (a+1)(b+1) -1.

Now, the possible a and b are even numbers from 2 to 14 inclusive. Let's list them out: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14.

So the possible values for a and b are each in this list. Since they can be the same, it's like choosing pairs with replacement.

So I need to find all possible (a+1)(b+1) -1, where a and b are in {2,4,6,8,10,12,14}.

But wait, since a and b are interchangeable, the pair (a,b) is the same as (b,a) for this expression. So I don't need to worry about order, but since the problem says "not necessarily distinct", I guess I have to consider all ordered pairs, but since a and b can be same, but for the product, it won't matter the order.

Wait, actually, since a and b are even and positive, and in the list 2,4,...14, each a and b can be any of those, including same.

So to find all possible values of (a+1)(b+1)-1, I need to compute this for each possible a and b. But since a and b are in same set, perhaps it's better to think about the possible (a+1) and (b+1) values.

Each a is 2,4,...,14. So a+1 would be 3,5,...,15.

So a+1 can be 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. Same for b+1.

So the product of (a+1)(b+1) is the product of two numbers from the set {3,5,7,9,11,13,15}.

So the possible products are all products of any two numbers in that set, then subtract 1.

I need to find how many distinct values of (product) -1 there are.

So first, perhaps I can list all the possible products of (a+1)(b+1), then subtract 1, and count how many unique results I get.

But since a and b can be same, the set includes squares like 3*3=9, 5*5=25, etc.

Wait, but since a and b can be any in the list, including same, the product can range from 3*3=9 up to 15*15=225.

But since a and b are each even numbers less than 15, their a+1 and b+1 are 3,5,...,15 as I said.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct products of pairs (including same pairs) from the set {3,5,7,9,11,13,15}, then subtract 1 from each product and count the distinct values.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to think of all possible products (p) of two numbers from that set, compute p-1, and count the distinct p-1's.

So first, I'll list all possible products, then see which p-1 are unique.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, I can note that each product is unique except for certain cases where different pairs give same product.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible products.

Let me list the set S = {3,5,7,9,11,13,15}. So 7 elements.

The number of possible ordered pairs (including same elements) is 7*7=49. But since (x,y) and (y,x) produce same product, but in this case, a and b are interchangeable, so I can consider unordered pairs, but since the problem allows a and b to be same, perhaps it's better to just compute all possible products and count.

Wait no, actually, since a and b are in same set, (a+1)(b+1) is same as (b+1)(a+1), so the product is same regardless of order. So the number of unique products is the number of unique products from all possible unordered pairs, including same elements.

So perhaps I should find all unique products of S elements, including squares.

So to find the number of unique products, I can compute all possible products and count how many are unique.

But that's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the count by considering the possible products.

Wait, but let's think of the numbers in S. They are all odd numbers, since the original a and b are even, so a+1 is odd, same for b+1.

So all products are odd * odd = odd. So p is odd, and p-1 is even.

So the result is even numbers.

But that doesn't directly help, but perhaps it's a useful note.

So, the possible products are:

Let me try to compute all possible products. Since S has 7 elements, the unique products may be less than 49 because some products might repeat.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the products and see.

But this might take a while, but perhaps I can find a better approach.

Wait, the expression is (a+1)(b+1) -1. So if a and b are both 2, (2+1)(2+1) -1 = 3*3 -1=9-1=8.

Similarly, for a=2, b=4: (3)(5)-1=15-1=14.

Wait, but perhaps I should create a table of a+1 and b+1 values and compute all possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible values of (a+1) as 3,5,7,9,11,13,15.

So I can list all possible products:

Start with 3:

3*3=9 → 9-1=8

3*5=15 →14

3*7=21 →20

3*9=27 →26

3*11=33 →32

3*13=39 →38

3*15=45 →44

Then 5:

5*3=15 →14 (already counted)

5*5=25 →24

5*7=35 →34

5*9=45 →44 (already from 3*15)

5*11=55 →54

5*13=65 →64

5*15=75 →74

Then 7:

7*3=21 →20 (counted)

7*5=35 →34 (counted)

7*7=49 →48

7*9=63 →62

7*11=77 →76

7*13=91 →90

7*15=105 →104

Then 9:

9*3=27 →26 (counted)

9*5=45 →44 (counted)

9*7=63 →62 (counted)

9*9=81 →80

9*11=99 →98

9*13=117 →116

9*15=135 →134

Then 11:

11*3=33 →32 (counted)

11*5=55 →54 (counted)

11*7=77 →76 (counted)

11*9=99 →98 (counted)

11*11=121 →120

11*13=143 →142

11*15=165 →164

Then 13:

13*3=39 →38 (counted)

13*5=65 →64 (counted)

13*7=91 →90 (counted)

13*9=117 →116 (counted)

13*11=143 →142 (counted)

13*13=169 →168

13*15=195 →194

Finally, 15:

15*3=45 →44 (counted)

15*5=75 →74 (counted)

15*7=105 →104 (counted)

15*9=135 →134 (counted)

15*11=165 →164 (counted)

15*13=195 →194 (counted)

15*15=225 →224

So now, I'll list all the p-1 values I got from each product:

From 3:

8,14,20,26,32,38,44

From 5:

24,34,54,64,74

From 7:

48,62,76,90,104

From 9:

80,98,116,134

From 11:

120,142,164

From 13:

168,194

From 15:

224

Wait, but I think I might have missed some when I was listing them. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect all the p-1 values and then count unique ones.

So let's list all p-1 values:

From 3:

8,14,20,26,32,38,44

From 5:

24,34,54,64,74

From 7:

48,62,76,90,104

From 9:

80,98,116,134

From 11:

120,142,164

From 13:

168,194

From 15:

224

Wait, but I think I may have missed some in the way I listed. Let me try a different approach. Let me list all the p-1 values as I go through each combination.

Starting with a+1=3:

3*3=9 →8

3*5=15 →14

3*7=21 →20

3*9=27 →26

3*11=33 →32

3*13=39 →38

3*15=45 →44

So from 3, p-1 values: 8,14,20,26,32,38,44.

Now a+1=5:

5*3=15 →14 (already in list)

5*5=25 →24

5*7=35 →34

5*9=45 →44 (already)

5*11=55 →54

5*13=65 →64

5*15=75 →74

So new p-1 values:24,34,54,64,74.

Next, a+1=7:

7*3=21 →20 (already)

7*5=35 →34 (already)

7*7=49 →48

7*9=63 →62

7*11=77 →76

7*13=91 →90

7*15=105 →104

New p-1 values:48,62,76,90,104.

a+1=9:

9*3=27 →26 (already)

9*5=45 →44 (already)

9*7=63 →62 (already)

9*9=81 →80

9*11=99 →98

9*13=117 →116

9*15=135 →134

New:80,98,116,134.

a+1=11:

11*3=33 →32 (already)

11*5=55 →54 (already)

11*7=77 →76 (already)

11*9=99 →98 (already)

11*11=121 →120

11*13=143 →142

11*15=165 →164

New:120,142,164.

a+1=13:

13*3=39 →38 (already)

13*5=65 →64 (already)

13*7=91 →90 (already)

13*9=117 →116 (already)

13*11=143 →142 (already)

13*13=169 →168

13*15=195 →194

New:168,194.

a+1=15:

15*3=45 →44 (already)

15*5=75 →74 (already)

15*7=105 →104 (already)

15*9=135 →134 (already)

15*11=165 →164 (already)

15*13=195 →194 (already)

15*15=225 →224

New:224.

Now, I'll list all the p-1 values I have:

From 3: 8,14,20,26,32,38,44.

From 5:24,34,54,64,74.

From 7:48,62,76,90,104.

From 9:80,98,116,134.

From 11:120,142,164.

From 13:168,194.

From 15:224.

Now, let's compile all these numbers and see if any are duplicates.

Looking through the list, I don't see any duplicates across these groups. So each group adds unique p-1 values.

Now, let's count them.

From 3:7 numbers.

From 5:5 new.

From7:5 new.

From9:4 new.

From11:3 new.

From13:2 new.

From15:1 new.

So total:7+5=12; 12+5=17; 17+4=21; 21+3=24; 24+2=26; 26+1=27.

Wait, but that's 27 unique values? But the options don't have 27 as correct unless looking.

Wait the options are:

A:18, B:21, C:45, D:27, E:35, F:42, G:22, H:30, I:49, J:36.

So option D is 27.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the numbers.

Let me list all the p-1 values:

From 3:

8,14,20,26,32,38,44 →7.

From5:24,34,54,64,74 →5. Total so far 12.

From7:48,62,76,90,104 →5. Total 17.

From9:80,98,116,134 →4. Total 21.

From11:120,142,164 →3. Total 24.

From13:168,194 →2. Total 26.

From15:224 →1. Total 27.

Yes, that's 27.

Wait, but wait I think I might have missed that some of the products could result in same p-1. Let me check.

For example, does any p-1 value occur in more than one group?

From 3: up to 44.

From5: up to 74.

From7: up to 104.

From9: up to 134.

From11: up to 164.

From13: up to 194.

From15:224.

Looking at the numbers, they're all distinct. So 27 unique p-1 values.

Wait, but wait, when I look at the numbers, let me check for overlaps. Let's see:

For example, 8,14,20,26,32,38,44.

Then 24,34,54,64,74.

Wait, 24 is new. 34 is new. 54,64,74.

Then 48,62,76,90,104.

80,98,116,134.

120,142,164.

168,194.

224.

No, I don't see any duplicates. So the count is 27.

So the answer would be D:27.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the initial approach, I considered a and b as ordered pairs, but since a and b are interchangeable, perhaps I'm double-counting some products. Wait no, because when I considered a+1 and b+1 as any pair, I included all possible combinations, but in the way I calculated, I considered each a+1 and b+1 in all possible pairings, including same elements, so I think the count is correct.

Wait another angle: the number of possible (a+1)(b+1) products is for a+1 and b+1 each being in S={3,5,7,9,11,13,15}.

So how many unique products are there? Let me think: for example, 3*5=15, 5*3=15, but that's same product.

Wait, but in my counting above, I considered all possible a+1 and b+1, including same elements, but when a+1 is 3, and b+1 is 5, it's same as a+1=5 and b+1=3. So perhaps I'm counting each product twice except when a+1=b+1.

Wait, but in my approach above, I considered a+1 in order from 3 to 15, and for each, multiplied by all b+1 >= a+1. Wait no, that's not what I did. In my initial approach, I just multiplied each a+1 with all possible b+1, including those before and after.

Wait, no, I think I didn't do that. Let me clarify.

Ah, no, in my initial approach, I didn't consider whether b+1 is greater than a+1 or not. I just took a+1 in the order 3,5,7,...15, and for each, multiplied with all possible b+1, including those that come before in the list.

So for example, when a+1=5, I included 5*3=15, which was already computed when a+1=3 and b+1=5. So that would result in duplicate p-1 values.

Wait a minute, that's a problem. Because in my initial counting, I treated each a+1 and b+1 as ordered, but the products
