Okay, so I have this question here about the government running a budget deficit and the Fed's money supply increase. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my macroeconomics, but I'll try to remember.

Alright, the question says the government has a budget deficit of $30 billion. That means the government is spending more than it's taking in through taxes and other revenues, so it needs to borrow the difference. Now, the Fed doesn't want to increase the money supply by more than $40 billion. Wait, so the Fed is controlling the money supply here.

I remember that when a government runs a deficit, it typically borrows by issuing bonds. These bonds are often bought by the central bank (the Fed in this case), which injects liquidity into the economy. But in this case, the Fed is limiting the money supply increase, so maybe they don't buy all the bonds. Or perhaps there's a reserve requirement involved.

Oh right, the legal reserve requirement is 20%. So banks have to keep 20% of their deposits as reserves. That means that when the Fed increases the money supply, it's through the purchase of government securities, which increases the banks' reserves. But since banks only need to keep 20% as reserves, they can lend out 80% of any new deposits.

Wait, but how does this connect to the budget deficit? Let me think. The government has a deficit, so it needs to finance $30 billion. If the Fed buys some of these bonds, that increases the money supply. But the Fed is capping the money supply increase at $40 billion. So how much can the Fed contribute, and what's left for the national debt?

I think the key here is understanding the relationship between the budget deficit, money supply, and the national debt. The budget deficit (G - T) is financed either by the Fed buying bonds (which increases the money supply) or by the public buying bonds (which doesn't increase the money supply because it's just a transfer from savers to the government).

So the total deficit is D = $30 billion. The Fed is willing to let the money supply increase by up to M = $40 billion. But wait, the Fed's money supply increase is limited, so the amount the Fed can buy is M divided by (1 - reserve requirement). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the money multiplier comes into play here. The money multiplier is 1/(reserve requirement). Since the reserve requirement is 20%, or 0.2, the multiplier is 1/0.2 = 5. So when the Fed buys bonds, each dollar they spend leads to an increase in the money supply by a multiple of 5. But wait, no, actually, when the Fed buys bonds, it's a one-time increase in the monetary base. The money supply increases based on that.

Wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up. The Fed can increase the monetary base through open market operations. The total change in the money supply would be the change in the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier.

In this case, the Fed is limiting the change in the money supply to $40 billion. So M = 40 billion. The change in the monetary base (let's call it MB) is related to M by MB * money multiplier = M.

Money multiplier is 1/(reserve requirement) = 1/0.2 = 5. So MB = M / 5 = 40 /5 = 8 billion. So the Fed can increase the monetary base by $8 billion. That means they can buy $8 billion worth of government bonds.

But wait, the deficit is $30 billion. So if the Fed only buys $8 billion of the bonds, the remaining $22 billion must be financed by the public (like through Treasury bond sales to households, etc.). These public purchases don't add to the money supply because it's just moving money from one pocket to another.

So the national debt is the total amount the government needs to borrow, which is the deficit. But wait, the national debt is the total outstanding debt, so the increase in the national debt would be the total deficit minus whatever the Fed buys. Because when the Fed buys, it's a monetization of the debt, so it doesn't add to the debt held by the public. So the increase in the national debt (publicly held) is the deficit minus the Fed's purchase.

So increase in national debt = D - Fed's purchase = 30 billion - 8 billion = 22 billion.

Wait, but the options are A through J. Let me look back. Option B is $22 billion. So the answer should be B.

Wait, wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me double-check. The Fed's purchase leads to an increase in the money supply. The Fed can only allow M to increase by $40 billion. So the maximum the Fed can buy is 8 billion (since M = 5 * MB). So the Fed buys 8 billion, and the rest must be borrowed by the government from the public, which is 30 -8 =22 billion. So the national debt increases by 22 billion because that's how much the government had to borrow from the public.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be B: $22 billion.

To determine how much the national debt must increase, we analyze the given scenario:

1. **Budget Deficit**: The government has a budget deficit of $30 billion, meaning it needs to finance this amount through borrowing.

2. **Fed's Money Supply Limitation**: The Fed is willing to increase the money supply by no more than $40 billion. The legal reserve requirement is 20%, so the money multiplier is \( \frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \). This means that every dollar the Fed injects into the economy increases the money supply by 5 times that amount.

3. **Fed's Contribution**: To find out how much the Fed can purchase in government bonds without exceeding the $40 billion money supply limit, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Fed's purchase} = \frac{\text{Money supply increase}}{\text{Money multiplier}} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ billion}.
   \]

4. **National Debt Increase**: The total budget deficit is $30 billion, and the Fed can only finance $8 billion of it. The remaining $22 billion must be financed by borrowing from the public, which increases the national debt.

Thus, the national debt must increase by **$22 billion**.

**Answer: B**
