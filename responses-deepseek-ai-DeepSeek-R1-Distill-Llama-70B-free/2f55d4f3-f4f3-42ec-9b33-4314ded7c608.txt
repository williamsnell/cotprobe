Question:

You are training a linear regression model for a simple estimation task, and notice that the model is overfitting to the data. You decide to add in $\ell_2$ regularization to penalize the weights. As you increase the $\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, what will happen to the bias and variance of the model?

Options:

A: Bias increase ; Variance increase
B: Bias decrease ; Variance increase
C: Neither bias nor variance is affected by $\ell_2$ regularization
D: Variance remains constant ; Bias decreases
E: Bias increase ; Variance decrease
F: Bias remains constant ; Variance increases
G: Both bias and variance remain constant
H: Variance remains constant ; Bias increases
I: Bias decrease ; Variance decrease
J: Bias remains constant ; Variance decreases

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about linear regression and regularization. Hmm, I remember that overfitting is when the model is too closely fit to the training data, which makes it perform poorly on new data. So the person in the question is using ℓ₂ regularization to address that.

Wait, ℓ₂ regularization is also called Ridge regression, right? It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. So the cost function becomes the usual cost plus λ times the sum of the squares of the weights.

Now, when you increase the regularization coefficient λ, the penalty term becomes more significant. I think this makes the model pay a higher price for larger weights. So the model tries to keep the weights smaller to minimize this penalty. But how does that affect bias and variance?

Bias is about how well the model's expected prediction matches the true value. If the model is too simple or constrained, it can't capture the true relationship well, leading to higher bias. On the other hand, variance is how much the model's predictions vary when trained on different datasets.

Regularization like ℓ₂ tends to reduce overfitting. Overfitting is usually associated with high variance because the model is capturing the noise in the training data, making it vary a lot between different datasets. So by adding regularization, we're smoothing out the model, which should reduce variance.

Wait, but how about bias? If we're constraining the model more (by increasing λ), does that introduce more bias? Because the model can't adjust the weights as much, so it's less likely to fit the training data perfectly. So maybe the model is now biased towards simpler solutions, which could mean higher bias but lower variance.

So when we increase λ, the model's variance decreases because it's less prone to fitting the noise. But the bias increases because the model can't fit the true underlying relationship as closely, especially if the true relationship is more complex. So the trade-off is between bias and variance—regularization reduces variance at the cost of increased bias.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one where bias increases and variance decreases. Let me check the options again.

Option E says bias increases and variance decreases. That matches what I was thinking. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Another way to think is that regularization adds a prior that the weights are small, which makes the model less flexible. Less flexibility means it can't capture all the nuances of the data, so higher bias. But because it's less flexible, it's not overfitting as much, so lower variance.

So the correct answer should be E.

When training a linear regression model and observing overfitting, adding ℓ₂ regularization (Ridge regression) helps by penalizing large weights. The penalty term, proportional to the square of the weights, discourages the model from fitting the noise in the training data. As the regularization coefficient (λ) increases, the model becomes less flexible and simpler, which reduces its ability to capture the true underlying relationship. This leads to an increase in bias because the model is constrained and cannot fit the data as closely. However, the reduced flexibility also means the model is less prone to overfitting, which decreases its variance. Thus, increasing ℓ₂ regularization results in higher bias and lower variance.

The correct answer is **E: Bias increase; Variance decrease**.
