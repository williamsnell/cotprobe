Question:

This question refers to the following information.
[T]he the end and measure of this power, when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all mankind in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and possessions, and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved, but a power to make law, and annex such penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. â€¦
Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I have this question about John Locke's Second Treatise of Government. I remember that Locke was a big figure in the Enlightenment, and his ideas influenced a lot of modern political thought, especially regarding natural rights and the social contract. The question is asking about when a government loses its legitimacy according to Locke.

The passage provided talks about the power of the magistrate, which I think refers to the government or the ruling authority. Locke says that this power comes from a compact or agreement among the people. The main goal of the government is to preserve the society, meaning protecting the people's lives, liberties, and possessions. The power isn't absolute or arbitrary; instead, it's about making laws with penalties that help maintain the whole by dealing with harmful elements without unnecessary severity.

So, the key points I'm picking up are that the government's legitimacy is based on the consent of the people, and its primary function is to protect the rights and safety of the people. If the government violates this, it loses its legitimacy.

Looking at the options:

A: when the people wish to change governors
- I don't think this is right. Locke's point is more about the government's actions, not the people's desire for change. The people can change their government, but that's a consequence of the government losing legitimacy, not the cause.

B: it does not have penalties for breaking the law
- No, the passage says the government should have penalties, but they should be appropriate. So not having penalties isn't the issue; it's more about the type and purpose of the penalties.

C: it tries to exercise absolute power
- This seems to fit. Locke says the power can't be absolute. When the legislative tries to grasp absolute power over lives, liberties, and estates, they breach the trust and forfeit their power.

D: it does not have a legislative body
- The passage mentions the legislative transgressing, so the presence of a legislative body isn't the issue. The issue is what the legislative does, not whether it exists.

E: it does not enact laws
- The government is supposed to make laws, but the problem arises when the laws are unjust or absolute. So not enacting laws isn't the main point.

F: it is weak and can be overthrown
- This isn't directly related. Locke's focus is on the abuse of power, not the strength of the government.

G: the people do not follow the laws
- The legitimacy loss isn't because people disobey, but because the government oversteps its authority.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be C. When the government tries to exercise absolute power, it loses legitimacy according to Locke.

The correct answer is C. Locke argues that a government's legitimacy is derived from the people's consent and its purpose to protect their lives, liberties, and possessions. When the government seeks absolute power, it violates this trust and thus loses its legitimacy.
