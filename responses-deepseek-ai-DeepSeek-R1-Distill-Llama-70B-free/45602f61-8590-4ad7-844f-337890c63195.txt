Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the Carnot efficiency of a steam turbine. Hmm, I remember that Carnot efficiency is related to the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs in a heat engine. The formula I think is something like (T_hot - T_cold) divided by T_hot, and all temperatures must be in Kelvin.

Wait, right, the Carnot efficiency equation is η = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot). Oh wait, no, wait. No, I think it's actually (T_hot - T_cold)/T_hot, which is the same as 1 - (T_cold/T_hot). Yeah, that makes sense because efficiency is higher when the temperature difference is larger.

Now, the problem gives me the steam temperatures. The turbine operates with steam at 300 degrees Celsius and discharges at 80 degrees Celsius. So I guess the hot reservoir is 300°C and the cold is 80°C. But wait, I need to convert these to Kelvin. 

To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 300°C is 300 + 273.15 = 573.15 K. And 80°C is 80 + 273.15 = 353.15 K. 

So plugging into the formula: η = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot) = 1 - (353.15 / 573.15). Let me calculate that. 

First, compute the division part. Let's see, 353.15 divided by 573.15. Hmm, 573 is about twice 286.5, but wait, I'll just do the division. 

Approximately, 353.15 / 573.15 ≈ 0.6165. So 1 minus that is about 0.3835. So around 38.35% efficiency.

Looking at the options, I see option H is 0.38, which is 38%, and option G is 0.42 (42%). So which is closer? My approximation was about 38.35%, so 0.38 is the closest. 

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation. Let's compute 353.15 divided by 573.15 more precisely. 

Let me compute:

353.15 ÷ 573.15. Let's see:

573.15 goes into 353.15 how many times? Well, 573 is bigger than 353, so it's less than 1. Let me compute it as 353.15/573.15.

Using a calculator approach: 353.15 / 573.15 ≈ 0.6165. So 1 - 0.6165 is 0.3835, so approximately 38.35%. So 0.3835, which is 0.38 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the answer should be option H, 0.38.

To calculate the Carnot efficiency of the steam turbine, we use the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{T_{\text{cold}}}{T_{\text{hot}}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{hot}}\) and \(T_{\text{cold}}\) are the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, respectively, in Kelvin. The problem provides the steam temperatures as \(300^\circ \mathrm{C}\) and \(80^\circ \mathrm{C}\). Converting these to Kelvin:

\[
T_{\text{hot}} = 300 + 273.15 = 573.15 \, \mathrm{K}, \quad T_{\text{cold}} = 80 + 273.15 = 353.15 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{353.15}{573.15}.
\]

First, calculate the division:

\[
\frac{353.15}{573.15} \approx 0.6165.
\]

Then, subtract from 1:

\[
\eta = 1 - 0.6165 = 0.3835.
\]

This corresponds to approximately \(38.35\%\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(0.38\), which is option H.

Answer: H
