The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
As a Jew, I have never believed in collective guilt. Only the guilty were guilty.
Children of killers are not killers but children. I have neither the desire nor the authority to judge today's generation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the generation of Hitler.
But we may—and we must—hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past. And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living.
We remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.
Elie Wiesel, "Reflections of a Survivor," 1987

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Elie Wiesel's passage. Let me read the passage again carefully.

Wiesel says he doesn't believe in collective guilt, meaning he doesn't think the children of killers are guilty themselves. He mentions that today's generation isn't responsible for the past crimes, but they are responsible for how they remember the past and what they do with that memory. He emphasizes the importance of remembering, stating that it helps the community deal with their history's ghosts and that not doing so will traumatize the living. He believes remembering Auschwitz is important because it shows that despite past horrors, the world can be saved, and salvation is found in memory.

So the question is about what Wiesel inferred about remembering the Holocaust. The options are A to J.

Looking at the options:

A: Unnecessary burden on Germans. But Wiesel says we must remember, so this seems opposite.

B: Necessary for Germans to reconcile with their history. The passage talks about the German people needing to remember, not just Jews, so this might fit.

C: Not necessary for Jewish healing. But Wiesel says remembering helps the Jewish people vanquish ghosts, so C is probably incorrect.

D: Allow Jews to forgive Germans. The passage doesn't mention forgiveness, more about memory and responsibility.

E: More harm than good. No, he believes in the importance of remembering.

F: Only necessary for Jews. No, because he's talking to the German people too, about their responsibility in remembering.

G: Repeat history. He actually implies that remembering prevents recurrence, so G is the opposite.

H: Ensure it never happens again. That sounds like a common reason for remembrance, but the passage focuses more on the present effects of memory rather than future prevention. So maybe, but I'm not sure.

I: Hinders German healing. No, he says remembering helps, not hinders.

J: Revenge. No, he doesn't mention revenge.

So the main point is that remembering is necessary for the community (he's addressing both Jews and Germans, I think) to come to terms with their past. So option B says it's necessary for the German people to reconcile with their history. That makes sense because he's saying they must remember the past appropriately, which would help them reconcile.

Wait, but the passage is addressed to the German people? Or is he speaking generally? Let me check. He says "we may—and we must—hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past." The 'it' refers to today's generation, which I think he's directing towards the German people, as he's a Jewish survivor addressing them.

So the inference is that remembering is necessary for the German people to reconcile with their own history, which is option B.
</think>

The passage emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust as a means for the German people to confront and reconcile with their history. Wiesel asserts that while the current generation isn't guilty of past crimes, they are responsible for how they remember and engage with those events. This process of remembrance is crucial for healing and ensuring that the past doesn't continue to traumatize the present. The correct inference is that remembering the Holocaust is necessary for the German people to come to terms with their history.

Answer: B
