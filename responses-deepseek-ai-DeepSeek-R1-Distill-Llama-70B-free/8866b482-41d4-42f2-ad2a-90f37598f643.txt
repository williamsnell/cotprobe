Okay, so I have this economics question about import quotas on foreign automobiles. Hmm, I remember that import quotas are a type of trade restriction, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what is an import quota? From what I recall, a quota is a limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country. So if the government sets a quota on foreign cars, it means only a certain number can be sold in the domestic market.

Now, the question is asking what effect this quota will have. The options are about price changes and who is protected or hurt. I think quotas affect supply and demand. If fewer foreign cars are allowed in, the supply of cars in the domestic market decreases because there are fewer imports. 

When supply decreases, assuming demand stays the same, the price should go up. So the price of automobiles would increase. That helps me narrow it down because some options talk about decreasing prices, which might not be right.

Next, who benefits and who doesn't? Well, domestic producers (like local car manufacturers) would benefit because with fewer foreign competitors, they can charge higher prices. Consumers, on the other hand, have to pay more now, so they're at a disadvantage. So the quota protects domestic producers but at the expense of consumers.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says it increases price and protects domestic producers at consumers' expense. That sounds right. Let me check the others to be sure. 

Option B says prices decrease, which I don't think is correct. Option C mentions protecting foreign producers, which doesn't make sense because the quota is against them. Option D talks about protecting domestic consumers, but higher prices would hurt them, so that's not right. Option E and F mention domestic efficiency; I'm not sure how quotas affect efficiency. Quotas might reduce competition, which could make domestic producers less efficient over time, but that's not directly part of the question. 

Options G and J suggest lower prices, which again I think is wrong because supply is reduced. H and I talk about efficiency but I'm focusing on the price and protection aspects. So yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is A.

An import quota on foreign automobiles restricts the quantity of cars that can be imported, reducing the supply in the domestic market. With decreased supply and unchanged demand, the price of automobiles is expected to rise. This benefits domestic producers by protecting them from foreign competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. Conversely, consumers are negatively impacted as they face higher prices. 

Analyzing the options, A correctly states that the price increases and domestic producers are protected at the expense of consumers. Other options either incorrectly suggest a price decrease, misidentify the protected group, or introduce unrelated factors like efficiency.

Answer: A
