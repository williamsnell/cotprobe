Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: The polynomial which results from the expansion of (x² + 5x +6)² + (px + q)(x³ +7x² +3x) has degree 2. Find p + q.

Hmm, okay. So the idea is that when you expand these two expressions and add them together, the highest power of x in the resulting polynomial is 2, which means the degree is 2. My goal is to find the values of p and q that make this true, and then add them together for the answer.

Let me break this down. I think I'll tackle each part separately and then combine them.

First, let's expand (x² +5x +6)². I remember that (a + b + c)² equals a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So applying that here:

(x²)² = x⁴
(5x)² = 25x²
(6)² = 36

Then the cross terms:
2*(x²)(5x) = 10x³
2*(x²)(6) = 12x²
2*(5x)(6) = 60x

So when I add all these together:
x⁴ + 10x³ + (25x² +12x²) +60x +36
Which simplifies to:
x⁴ +10x³ +37x² +60x +36

Okay, got that part. So that's the first expansion.

Next, I need to expand (px + q)(x³ +7x² +3x). Let me do that distribution.

Multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second:

px * x³ = p x⁴
px *7x² =7p x³
px *3x =3p x²

Then q times each term:
q*x³ = q x³
q*7x² =7q x²
q*3x =3q x

So putting it all together:
p x⁴ + (7p + q) x³ + (3p +7q) x² + 3q x

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. Wait, when I distribute (px + q), each term in (x³ +7x² +3x) is multiplied by px and q. So:

px*(x³) = p x⁴

px*(7x²) =7p x³

px*(3x) =3p x²

q*(x³) = q x³

q*(7x²) =7q x²

q*(3x) =3q x

So collecting like terms:

x⁴ term: p x⁴

x³ terms: 7p x³ + q x³ → (7p + q)x³

x² terms: 3p x² +7q x² → (3p +7q) x²

x terms: 3q x

So the second expansion is: p x⁴ + (7p + q) x³ + (3p +7q) x² +3q x

Now, the problem says that when we add the two expanded polynomials together, the result has degree 2. So let's write down the sum.

First expansion: x⁴ +10x³ +37x² +60x +36

Second expansion: p x⁴ + (7p + q)x³ + (3p +7q)x² +3q x

Adding them term by term:

x⁴ term: 1 + p → (1 + p)x⁴

x³ term: 10 + (7p + q) → (10 +7p + q)x³

x² term: 37 + (3p +7q) → (37 +3p +7q)x²

x term:60 +3q → (60 +3q)x

constant term:36

Wait, no, wait. The second expansion only has up to x terms, except for the terms with x⁴, x³, etc. So when adding, each degree is added together.

Wait, but wait, when adding the two, it's:

(x⁴ +10x³ +37x² +60x +36) + (p x⁴ + (7p + q)x³ + (3p +7q)x² +3q x)

So combining:

x⁴ terms: 1 + p

x³ terms:10 +7p + q

x² terms:37 +3p +7q

x terms:60 +3q

constant term:36

Now, the resulting polynomial must have degree 2. That means that the coefficients for x⁴ and x³ must be zero. Because if any of those higher degree terms are present, the overall polynomial would have a higher degree.

So for the polynomial to have degree 2, the coefficients of x⁴ and x³ must be zero.

So I can set up two equations:

1. Coefficient of x⁴: 1 + p = 0 → p = -1

2. Coefficient of x³:10 +7p + q = 0

I can substitute p = -1 into the second equation.

So equation 2 becomes:10 +7*(-1) + q = 0 →10 -7 + q =0 →3 + q=0 → q= -3

Wait, wait, 10-7 is 3, so 3 + q =0 → q= -3.

So p is -1 and q is -3. So p + q is (-1) + (-3) = -4.

Wait, but let me double-check my equations.

From x⁴:1 + p =0 → p= -1.

Then, x³:10 +7p + q =0.

Putting p=-1:10 +7*(-1) + q=0 →10-7 + q=0 →3 + q=0 →q= -3.

So p + q = (-1) + (-3) = -4.

Looking at the options, option G is -4. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the expansions.

Let me recheck the expansions.

First, (x² +5x +6)².

(x²)^2 =x^4

2*(x²)(5x)=2*5 x^3=10x^3

2*(x²)(6)=12x^2

(5x)^2=25x^2

2*(5x)(6)=60x

6^2=36.

So adding: x^4 +10x^3 + (12x^2 +25x^2)=37x^2 +60x +36. That looks correct.

Second expansion: (px + q)(x^3 +7x^2 +3x).

px*x^3 =p x^4.

px*7x^2=7p x^3.

px*3x=3p x^2.

q*x^3= q x^3.

q*7x^2=7q x^2.

q*3x=3q x.

So combining:

x^4 term: p.

x^3:7p + q.

x^2:3p +7q.

x:3q.

That's correct.

So when adding the two polynomials, the sum is:

x^4 term: 1 + p.

x^3 term:10 +7p + q.

x^2 term:37 +3p +7q.

x term:60 +3q.

Constant term:36.

Since the result must have degree 2, the coefficients of x^4 and x^3 must be zero.

So:

1 + p =0 → p= -1.

10 +7p + q =0 → substituting p=-1: 10 +7*(-1) + q=0 →10-7=3 →3 + q=0 →q= -3.

So p is -1, q is -3. So p + q= -4.

Looking at the options, option G is -4. So the answer is G.

To solve the problem, we need to expand the given polynomials and ensure that the resulting polynomial has degree 2. This means the coefficients of \(x^4\) and \(x^3\) must be zero.

### Step 1: Expand \((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\)
Using the formula \((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc\):
\[
(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2 = x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36
\]

### Step 2: Expand \((px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)\)
Distributing each term:
\[
(px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x) = p x^4 + (7p + q)x^3 + (3p + 7q)x^2 + 3q x
\]

### Step 3: Add the Two Polynomials
Adding the expanded forms:
\[
(x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36) + (p x^4 + (7p + q)x^3 + (3p + 7q)x^2 + 3q x)
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
(1 + p)x^4 + (10 + 7p + q)x^3 + (37 + 3p + 7q)x^2 + (60 + 3q)x + 36
\]

### Step 4: Ensure the Resulting Polynomial Has Degree 2
For the polynomial to have degree 2, the coefficients of \(x^4\) and \(x^3\) must be zero:
1. Coefficient of \(x^4\): \(1 + p = 0 \implies p = -1\)
2. Coefficient of \(x^3\): \(10 + 7p + q = 0\). Substituting \(p = -1\):
\[
10 + 7(-1) + q = 0 \implies 10 - 7 + q = 0 \implies 3 + q = 0 \implies q = -3
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \(p + q\)
\[
p + q = -1 + (-3) = -4
\]

### Final Answer
The value of \(p + q\) is \(-4\), which corresponds to option **G**.
