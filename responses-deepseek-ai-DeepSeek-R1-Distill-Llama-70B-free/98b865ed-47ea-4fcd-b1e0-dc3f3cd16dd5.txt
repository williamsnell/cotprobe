Okay, so I need to figure out how long it will take Jerry to read a 320-page book based on his reading speed. Let me start by understanding the given information.

Jerry read a 200-page book in 10 hours. I think I should find out his reading rate first, like how many pages he reads per hour. So, if he reads 200 pages in 10 hours, I can calculate that by dividing 200 by 10. Let me do that: 200 divided by 10 is 20. Oh, so he reads 20 pages per hour. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about a 320-page book. I need to find out how many hours it will take him at the same rate. If he reads 20 pages each hour, then for 320 pages, I should divide 320 by 20. Let me calculate that: 320 divided by 20 equals 16. So, it should take him 16 hours to read the 320-page book.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, his speed is 20 pages per hour. 20 pages/hour times 16 hours would be 320 pages. Yep, that adds up. So the time required is 16 hours.

Looking at the options, option D is 16 hours. So the correct answer must be D.

To determine how long it will take Jerry to read a 320-page book, we first calculate his reading rate. Jerry reads 200 pages in 10 hours, which gives a rate of 20 pages per hour. 

Next, we use this rate to find the time required for 320 pages:  
320 pages รท 20 pages/hour = 16 hours.  

Thus, it will take Jerry 16 hours to read the 320-page book. The correct answer is **D: 16 hours**.
