Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the carrying charge for a television set bought on an installment plan. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these terms, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the television's cash price is $525. That means if you pay it all at once, it's $525. But they're buying it on the installment plan. Let's see, the down payment is $75. So that's paid right away, right? Then there are twelve monthly payments of $42.75 each. Wait, so each month they pay $42.75 for a year, and that's the installment part.

So the question is asking for the carrying charge. I remember that carrying charge is the amount added to the cash price when you buy something on installments. It's like the interest or the extra cost you pay for not paying all at once. So to find the carrying charge, I need to figure out the total amount paid under the installment plan and then subtract the cash price from that.

Let me outline the steps. First, calculate the total amount paid in installments. Then add the down payment. That sum minus the cash price should give the carrying charge.

Wait, wait. The down payment is part of the total paid, right? So the total paid is down payment plus all the monthly payments. So that's $75 plus (12 times $42.75). Let me do that math.

12 multiplied by 42.75. Let's see, 12 times 40 is 480, and 12 times 2.75 is 33. So 480 + 33 equals 513. So the monthly payments add up to $513. Then the down payment is $75, so total paid is 513 +75 = 588.

Oh wait, wait. The cash price is $525. So the total paid under installments is $588. So the carrying charge would be the difference between these two. 588 minus 525 equals 63. So the carrying charge is $63.

Looking at the options, option G is $63. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get that right? Let me double-check. So cash price is 525. Installment total is 75 + (12 *42.75). Let me compute 12 *42.75 again. 42.75 *12: 42 *12 is 504, and 0.75 *12 is 9, so total 513. Yes, 513. So 513 +75 is 588. Then 588 - 525 is 63. Yep, that seems right.

So the carrying charge is $63, which is option G.

The carrying charge is calculated by determining the total amount paid under the installment plan and subtracting the cash price. 

1. **Total monthly payments**:  
   12 monthly payments of $42.75 each:  
   \( 12 \times 42.75 = 513 \).  

2. **Total amount paid**:  
   Add the down payment ($75) to the total monthly payments:  
   \( 513 + 75 = 588 \).  

3. **Carrying charge**:  
   Subtract the cash price ($525) from the total amount paid:  
   \( 588 - 525 = 63 \).  

Thus, the carrying charge is **$63**, which corresponds to option **G**.
