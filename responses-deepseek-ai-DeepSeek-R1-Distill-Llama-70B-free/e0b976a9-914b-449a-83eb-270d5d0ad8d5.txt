Question:

Classical and neoclassical (marginalist) theorists have usually supported the market system of allocation. Be-cause of this, they usually opposed government inter-vention in the economy . Keynes advocated government inter-vention. Does this mean he was against the market economy?

Options:

A: Keynes supported a market economy with equal government and private enterprise control
B: Keynes was completely against government intervention
C: Keynes believed in a completely free private enterprise economy
D: Keynes promoted only minor tweaks to the market system, without significant government intervention
E: Keynes believed government intervention should only occur in times of war or crisis
F: Keynes was an advocate for a mixed economy, but with minimal roles for both the government and the private sector
G: Keynes argued for a purely government-run economy, with no market influences
H: Keynes sought to abolish private ownership in favor of a fully government-controlled economy
I: Keynes wanted to replace the market system
J: Keynes aimed to stabilize the market economy

Okay, so I have this economics question about Keynes and his views on government intervention and the market economy. Hmm, I remember that Keynesian economics is different from the classical and neoclassical views. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that classical and neoclassical theorists support the market system and oppose government intervention. Keynes, on the other hand, advocated for government intervention. But does that mean he was against the market economy? I think I need to recall what Keynes actually believed.

From what I remember, Keynes wasn't against the market economy entirely. Instead, he thought that the market system doesn't always work perfectly. He believed that government intervention was necessary, especially during times of economic downturns, like the Great Depression. So his idea was more about stabilizing the economy rather than completely replacing the market system.

Wait, so he wasn't advocating for a completely government-run economy, right? He wanted a mixed economy where both the private sector and the government play roles. The government's role would be to step in when the market fails, like providing stimulus during a recession to create demand.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Keynes supported a market economy with equal control from government and private. I'm not sure about "equal," but he did support a mixed economy.

Option B says he was against government intervention, which contradicts what I know because he was for intervention.

Option C says he believed in a completely free enterprise economy, which doesn't fit because he wanted some government involvement.

Option D suggests only minor tweaks without significant intervention. I think Keynes actually supported significant intervention when necessary, especially in crises, so maybe not just minor.

Option E says intervention only during war or crisis. I think he believed in intervention during economic crises too, not just war. But maybe that's part of it. But the question is about his general stance.

Option F says mixed economy with minimal roles for both. I'm not sure about minimal. Keynes wanted active fiscal policies, so maybe more than minimal.

Option G is purely government-run economy, which isn't correct.

Option H and I are about abolishing private ownership or replacing the market, which I don't think Keynes wanted.

Option J says he aimed to stabilize the market economy. That sounds right because he wanted to fix market failures rather than eliminate the market system.

So putting it all together, Keynes wasn't against the market economy. He wanted to stabilize it through government intervention, especially during economic crises. So he was an advocate for a mixed economy where the government plays a role in stabilizing the market, not replacing it.

Looking back at the options, J says he aimed to stabilize the market economy, which fits. Alternatively, A says a market economy with equal control, but I'm not sure if equal is the right term. Maybe more that the government has a significant role alongside the market.

Wait, option A says equal government and private control. I'm not certain if that's accurate. Keynes might have believed in a mixed economy but not necessarily equal control. He emphasized government intervention more during certain times.

So the best answer is probably J: Keynes aimed to stabilize the market economy.

Keynes believed in the market economy but recognized its imperfections, particularly during economic crises. He advocated for government intervention to stabilize the economy rather than replace it. His approach supported a mixed economy where both the private sector and the government play roles, with the government stepping in to address market failures. The correct answer reflects his aim to stabilize the market economy through such interventions.

Answer: J
