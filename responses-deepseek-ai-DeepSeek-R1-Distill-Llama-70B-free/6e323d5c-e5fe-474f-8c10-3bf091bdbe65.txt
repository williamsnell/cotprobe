Okay, so I've got this math problem here: What is the quotient of 1,224 divided by 9? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on division, but I think I can work through this.

Let me start by recalling how to do long division. I remember that division is about finding how many times one number fits into another. So here, I need to see how many times 9 fits into 1,224.

First, let me write down the numbers to visualize it better. 9 goes into 1,224. I'll set it up as 9 | 1224.

I think I should start from the left. So, looking at the first digit, which is 1. 9 goes into 1 zero times, so I move to the next digit, making it 12.

Now, how many times does 9 go into 12? Well, 9 times 1 is 9, and 9 times 2 is 18, which is too big. So it's 1 time. I write down 1, subtract 9 from 12, and get 3. Then bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32.

Next, how many times does 9 go into 32? Let me think: 9*3 is 27, and 9*4 is 36, which is too much. So 3 times. 3 times 9 is 27. Subtract that from 32, and I get 5. Bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 54.

Now, how many times does 9 go into 54? Oh, that's easy. 9*6 is 54, so exactly 6 times. 6 times 9 is 54. Subtracting gives zero, and there are no more digits to bring down.

Putting it all together, the quotient is 136. So looking at the options, B is 136. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check to be sure. 9 times 136 equals... let's see. 9*100 is 900, 9*30 is 270, and 9*6 is 54. Adding those up: 900+270 is 1170, plus 54 is 1224. Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident the answer is B.

The quotient of 1,224 divided by 9 is calculated using long division. 

1. Divide 9 into 12, which gives 1. Multiply 1 by 9, subtract from 12, and bring down the next digit (2), making 32.  
2. Divide 9 into 32, which gives 3. Multiply 3 by 9, subtract from 32, and bring down the next digit (4), making 54.  
3. Divide 9 into 54, which gives 6. Multiply 6 by 9, subtract from 54, resulting in 0.  

The quotient is 136. Verifying, 9 * 136 equals 1,224, confirming the calculation.  

The correct answer is **B: 136**.  

B
