Question:

All walking animals, including humans, have a natural walking pace—a number of steps per minute that is more comfortable than a faster or slower pace. Suppose that this pace corresponds to the oscillation of the leg as a physical pendulum.  Fossil evidence shows that T. rex, a two-legged dinosaur that lived about 65 million years ago, had a leg length L = 3.1 m and a stride length S = 4.0 m (the distance from one footprint to the next print of the same foot).  Estimate the walking speed of T. rex. (Unit: m/s)

Options:

A: 1.6
B: 0.7
C: 1.4
D: 1.8
E: 1.1
F: 0.9
G: 2.2
H: 2.5
I: 3.0
J: 2.8

Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about estimating the walking speed of a Tyrannosaurus Rex using the concept of a physical pendulum. Interesting!

Alright, the problem says that the natural walking pace of animals, including humans, corresponds to the oscillation of the leg as a physical pendulum. So, the idea is that the legs act like pendulums, swinging back and forth at their natural frequency. That makes sense because when we walk, our legs swing in a sort of pendulum motion.

The problem gives me the leg length, L, as 3.1 meters. That's for T. rex, right? And the stride length, S, is 4.0 meters. Stride length is the distance between one footprint and the next of the same foot. So each step covers 4 meters.

I need to find the walking speed in meters per second. The options are from A to J, with values ranging from about 0.7 to 3.0 m/s.

Wait, I remember that the period of a physical pendulum is given by T = 2π√(I/(mgh)), but wait, no, that's for a physical pendulum. Oh wait, wait, maybe for a simple pendulum, the period is T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, in this case, the leg is acting as a pendulum. So the period of each swing would be the time for one step. But wait, when you take a step, you're swinging your leg forward and then bringing it back. Or wait, each step is a half-period? Because for each full swing (forward and back), that's a full period, but each step is a half-swing. Hmm, maybe I should think about that.

Wait, when you walk, each step involves lifting the foot and moving it forward. So each step is a half-period of the pendulum because the pendulum swings forward (step) and then backward (as the other foot steps). Or wait, maybe each step is a full period? No, that can't be right. Because each swing forward would be a half-period. Let me think again.

In a pendulum, a full cycle is moving from one extreme to the other and back. So for a walking motion, each step is a half-cycle. Because when the leg swings forward, that's a half-period, and then it swings back for the next step. So the time for each step is half the period of the pendulum.

Wait, no, wait. Suppose the leg swings forward to make a step, and then swings backward as the other leg steps. So each step is a half-period. So the time per step is T/2, where T is the period of the pendulum. Hmm, that might make sense. So if the period is T, each step takes T/2 time.

Wait, but when you take a step, your leg swings forward, which is a quarter of the pendulum's motion (from equilibrium to extreme), and then it's the other leg's turn. So perhaps each full stride (two steps, one by each leg) takes a full period. So each step (half-stride) would be half the period. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me clarify: the period T is the time for one complete back-and-forth swing of the pendulum. So in the case of walking, each step corresponds to a swing forward, which would take T/2 time because the swing back would be another T/2. Hmm, no, perhaps not. Let's think about it as the time between steps. Each full swing (forward and back) would correspond to moving two steps, one with each leg. So perhaps for each step, the time is T/2.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that each step happens once per half-period. So the step frequency is twice the pendulum frequency. Because the pendulum swings once (full period) for two steps. So the frequency of steps is f = 2/(2π)√(g/L) )? Wait, no, the frequency of the pendulum is 1/T, where T is 2π√(L/g). So the frequency f_pendulum = 1/(2π√(L/g)) ) = √(g/(4π² L)).

But if each step takes T/2 time, then the step frequency is 2/T. So f_steps = 2/(2π√(L/g)) ) = 1/(π√(L/g)) ) = √(g)/(π√L) ).

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the period of the pendulum. The time for one full swing is T = 2π√(L/g). So each step would take T/2 time because each step is a half-swing. So the time per step is T/2 = π√(L/g).

So the number of steps per second would be 1/(T/2) ) = 2/(T) = 2/(2π√(L/g)) ) = 1/(π√(L/g)).

Wait, but then how does that relate to the walking speed? Because speed is distance per time. The stride length is the distance per step. So if each step is S meters, and each step takes (T/2) time, then the speed is S divided by the time per step. So speed v = S / (T/2) ) = (2 S)/(T).

Since T is the period of the pendulum, which is 2π√(L/g), then T = 2π√(L/g). So substituting, v = (2 S)/(2π√(L/g)) ) = (S)/(π√(L/g)).

Simplify that. Let's see, √(L/g) is in the denominator, so it's equivalent to S * √(g/(L)) / π.

So, v = (S * sqrt(g/L)) ) / π.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. S is 4.0 meters, L is 3.1 meters, and g is 9.8 m/s².

Let me calculate the numerator first: S * sqrt(g/L) = 4.0 * sqrt(9.8 / 3.1).

Compute 9.8/3.1. Let's see, 3.1 * 3 = 9.3, so 9.8 is about 3.1613 times 3.1. So sqrt(3.1613) is approximately 1.778.

So 4.0 * 1.778 ≈ 7.112.

Then divide by π (approx 3.1416), so 7.112 / 3.1416 ≈ 2.267 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is J:2.8, and H is 2.5, G is 2.2. So 2.267 is close to 2.2 or 2.3, but the options don't have 2.3. Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the period. Let me re-examine the initial assumption.

Alternative approach: Maybe the walking speed is determined by the natural frequency of the leg as a pendulum. So the number of steps per second would be the same as the pendulum's frequency. Wait, but that would mean that the time per step is the same as the period of the pendulum. So the number of steps per second is 1/T.

Wait, if the pendulum's period is T = 2π√(L/g), then the number of steps per second is f = 1/T = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(g/L).

Then, the speed would be the number of steps per second multiplied by the stride length. So v = f * S = [ (1/(2π)) * sqrt(g/L) ] * S.

Let me compute that. S is 4.0 m, L=3.1 m, g=9.8 m/s².

So sqrt(g/L) = sqrt(9.8/3.1) ≈ sqrt(3.1613) ≈ 1.778.

Then (1/(2π)) * 1.778 ≈ (1/6.283) * 1.778 ≈ approx 0.2829.

Multiply by S=4.0: 0.2829 *4 ≈ 1.131 m/s.

Hmm, that's about 1.13 m/s, which is close to option E:1.1 or F:0.9.

Wait, but that's a walking speed of about 1.1 m/s. That seems a bit slow for a T. rex. I remember that estimates vary, but some suggest that T. rex could move at speeds around 5-11 km/h, which is about 1.4 to 3.1 m/s. So 1.1 seems on the lower side, but perhaps possible.

Wait, but earlier I had a calculation that gave me about 2.26 m/s. So which approach is correct?

I think my confusion arises from whether each step corresponds to a full period or a half-period. Let's clarify.

In a pendulum, the period is the time to complete a full swing: moving from the equilibrium position to one extreme, back through equilibrium to the other extreme, and back again. So a full period is a complete back-and-forth motion.

When walking, each step involves the leg swinging forward (from back to front), which is half a period. Because the next step would involve the same leg swinging back, but wait no— the next step is the other leg stepping forward. So perhaps each step (by one leg) corresponds to a half-period of the pendulum.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the walking as each step being a half-period. So the time for each step is T/2, where T is the pendulum's period.

In that case, the number of steps per second would be 2/T. Then, the speed would be steps per second times stride length.

So, steps per second = 2 / T.

T = 2π√(L/g), so 2/T = 1/(π√(L/g)) = √(g/(L))/(π).

Therefore, speed v = (2 / T) * S = (2 * S) / (2π√(L/g)) ) = (S) / (π√(L/g)).

Which brings us back to the first calculation of about 2.26 m/s.

Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier. So then why did I get two different approaches giving different results?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the numbers carefully.

Compute sqrt(g/L): g=9.8, L=3.1. 9.8/3.1 ≈3.1613. sqrt(3.1613) ≈1.778.

So, S=4.0 m, so 4.0 * 1.778 ≈7.112.

Divide by π: 7.112 /3.1416≈2.267 m/s.

So that's about 2.27 m/s, which is close to option G:2.2, but there's also option J:2.8.

But wait, another thing to consider is whether the formula is correct. Because perhaps the pendulum model is a simple one, but in reality, the leg's motion is more complex. Also, the stride length might relate to twice the arc length of the pendulum's swing.

Wait, the stride length S is the distance between footprints. For a pendulum, the maximum displacement from the equilibrium is related to the angle. But if the swing is small, the arc length is approximately the stride length. So perhaps S ≈ 2Lθ, where θ is the angular displacement in radians. But if θ is small, sinθ ≈θ, and the arc length is Lθ. Wait, but wait, the stride is the distance between two footprints, which would be twice the maximum displacement of the pendulum. So perhaps S ≈ 2*(Lθ). Hmm, but in that case, for small angles, θ is in radians, and the distance is 2Lθ.

Wait, but in our case, maybe the stride is S = 2L sinθ, but for small θ, sinθ ≈θ, so S≈2Lθ.

But since the speed is based on the frequency and stride length, perhaps the exact relationship depends on the angular displacement, but maybe the initial approach is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the walking speed is determined by the angular frequency ω times the stride length divided by 2π or something like that.

Wait, angular frequency ω = sqrt(g/L). For a simple pendulum, ω = sqrt(g/L). Then, the maximum speed of the pendulum bob is v = Lω. But that's the maximum speed during the swing. However, the average speed over the entire period would be lower.

But in this problem, perhaps the walking speed is approximated by the average speed of the pendulum. The average speed of a simple pendulum over a full period is (2/π) times the maximum speed. So average speed = (2/π) * Lω.

Wait, that's an interesting approach. So the average speed during the swing would be (2/π)*Lω.

But wait, the stride is S, which is the distance covered in one step. So perhaps each step is a half-period, so the time per step is T/2. So the average speed would be the distance per step divided by the time per step.

Wait, let me clarify: if each step takes T/2 time, and the distance is S, then the speed is S/(T/2) = 2S/T.

But T is the period of the pendulum, which is 2π/ω, where ω is sqrt(g/L). So T=2π√(L/g).

So substituting, speed v = 2S/(2π√(L/g)) )= (S)/(π√(L/g)).

Which is the same formula as before. So that gives us the same 2.26 m/s.

Looking back at the options, the closest value is G:2.2. But let me check the calculation again with more precise numbers.

Compute sqrt(9.8/3.1):

9.8 /3.1 = 3.16129032.

Square root of that: sqrt(3.16129032) ≈ 1.778.

Then, 4.0 * 1.778 = 7.112.

Divide by pi: 7.112 /3.14159265 ≈ 2.266 m/s.

So approximately 2.27 m/s. That's very close to option G:2.2, but perhaps I should consider more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 9.8/3.1 more accurately.

3.1*3=9.3, 9.8-9.3=0.5, so 3.1 *0.161 =0.5. So 3.161 exactly.

So sqrt(3.161)= as before, 1.778.

So 4 *1.778=7.112. Divided by pi (3.14159265):

7.112 /3.14159265 = let's compute that more accurately.

3.14159265 ×2=6.2831853.

7.112-6.2831853=0.8288147.

Now, 0.8288147 /3.14159265 ≈ 0.264.

So total is 2.0 + 0.264=2.264 m/s.

So that's 2.26 m/s. So the closest option is G:2.2. But let me check the options again.

Options:

A:1.6

B:0.7

C:1.4

D:1.8

E:1.1

F:0.9

G:2.2

H:2.5

I:3.0

J:2.8

So 2.26 is closer to 2.2 than to 2.5. So the answer should be G:2.2.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the stride length S is related to the period differently. Because stride length is the distance between two consecutive footprints of the same foot. So each stride corresponds to two steps: one by each foot. So perhaps the time for a stride is T, the period of the pendulum.

Wait, that would change things. Because if the period T is the time for a full stride (which includes two steps), then the number of strides per second is 1/T, and each stride is S meters. So the speed would be S/(T).

Wait, but T is 2π√(L/g). So S/(2π√(L/g)).

Let me compute that.

S=4.0 m.

So 4.0/(2π√(3.1/9.8))).

Wait, wait, wait, no: √(L/g) would be √(3.1/9.8) = sqrt(0.3161)≈0.562.

So √(L/g) ≈0.562.

So denominator is 2π*0.562≈3.53.

So 4.0 /3.53≈1.133 m/s.

That's about 1.13 m/s, which is close to option E:1.1 or option F:0.9.

But earlier calculation when considering each step as a half-period gave us 2.26 m/s.

Hmm, so which approach is correct? I think the confusion arises from whether the stride corresponds to a full period or a half-period.

Let me think about how a human walks. Each stride is the distance between two consecutive footprints of the same foot. So when you take a stride, you've moved forward S meters, and it's the result of one step by each leg. So the time for a stride is the time it takes for both legs to step once each. So perhaps the time for a stride is the period T. So each stride (S meters) takes T time.

In that case, the speed would be S/T.

If T is the period of the pendulum, which is 2π√(L/g), then speed v = S/(2π√(L/g)).

Wait, that's the same as before. So with the numbers:

S=4.0, L=3.1, g=9.8.

So v=4/(2π * sqrt(3.1/9.8)).

Compute sqrt(3.1/9.8)=sqrt(0.3161)=0.562.

Then denominator is 2π*0.562≈3.526.

So 4 /3.526≈1.134 m/s.

That's about 1.13 m/s. So that's close to option E:1.
