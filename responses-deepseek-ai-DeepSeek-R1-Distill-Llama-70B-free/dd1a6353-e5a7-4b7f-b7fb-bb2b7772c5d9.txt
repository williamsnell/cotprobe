Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Pleistocene ice masses in North America. The question is asking which one was centered in the Rocky Mountains. Hmm, I remember that during the Pleistocene epoch, there were several large ice sheets and mountain glaciers. 

Wait, the big ones I recall are the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. The Laurentide was the largest one, covering much of Canada and the northern United States, right? So it was probably centered more in the eastern part or the central part of North America, not the Rockies.

Oh, but then there's the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. I think that was located along the western edge, maybe the Pacific side. The Rocky Mountains run along the western part of North America, so maybe the Cordilleran was centered there. Or was it? Wait, no, I think the Cordilleran was more along the coast, like the Pacific coastal area, including places like British Columbia and maybe into the northwestern US.

Wait, so if the Rockies are in the west but more inland, perhaps the ice sheet centered there is a different one. Or maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let me think again. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet was to the west, while the Laurentide was to the east and covered more of the central and eastern areas.

Wait, but the question is about the Rocky Mountains. So perhaps the correct answer is the Rocky Mountain ice sheet? But I'm not sure if that's one of the major ones. I think the major ones are Laurentide and Cordilleran. Oh, but I also remember that there were smaller mountain glaciers in ranges like the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies themselves.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is Rocky Mountain. Option J is Cordilleran. So maybe I should consider which one was centered in the Rockies. Alternatively, maybe the ice mass in the Rockies was a part of a larger sheet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about this. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered a vast area, including parts of Canada and the northern US, like from the Hudson Bay area. The Cordilleran was more along the western coast, including the areas around the current-day Cordillera mountain range, which includes the Rockies.

Wait, wait, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was centered in the region of the Cordillera, which includes the Rocky Mountains. So perhaps the answer is J: Cordilleran.

Alternatively, maybe the Rocky Mountain ice mass is a separate one, but I don't recall that being one of the major named ice sheets. The two main ones are Laurentide and Cordilleran. So if the question is about the Rockies, which are part of the Cordillera, then the Cordilleran Ice Sheet would be the one.

So looking at the options, J is Cordilleran. So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks for the Pleistocene ice mass in North America centered in the Rocky Mountains. During the Pleistocene epoch, the two major ice sheets in North America were the Laurentide and the Cordilleran. The Laurentide Ice Sheet was the larger of the two and covered much of Canada and the northern United States, primarily in the eastern and central regions. In contrast, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was located along the western edge of North America, encompassing the Cordillera mountain range, which includes the Rocky Mountains. 

Given that the Rocky Mountains are part of the Cordillera, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet is the correct answer. While the term "Rocky Mountain" might seem relevant, it is not one of the major named ice sheets. Therefore, the ice mass centered in the Rocky Mountains during the Pleistocene was part of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.

Answer: J
