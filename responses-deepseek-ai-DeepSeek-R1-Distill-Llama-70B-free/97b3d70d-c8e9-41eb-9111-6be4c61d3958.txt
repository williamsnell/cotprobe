Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the weight and volume of water in a container. Hmm, I remember from physics that weight relates to force due to gravity, and mass is a different quantity. Oh wait, in the English system, weight is often used interchangeably with force, so I think that's what's happening here.

The container's empty weight is given as 3.22 lb force. That's the force exerted by gravity on the container itself when it's empty. Then, when it's filled with water at 60°F, the total mass (which is the combined mass of the container and the water) is 1.95 slugs. Wait, slugs are the unit of mass in the English system, right? Yeah, I remember that 1 slug is about 32.174 lb·s²/ft, but maybe I don't need the exact conversion here.

So, the first thing I think I need to find is the mass of the water. Because the total mass is the container's mass plus the water's mass. But wait, the container's weight is given as 3.22 lb force. Since weight (force) equals mass times gravity (W = m*g), I can find the container's mass by dividing its weight by g.

Wait, what's the value of g in ft/s²? I think it's 32.2 ft/s², yes. So, the container's mass is 3.22 lb force divided by 32.2 ft/s². Let me calculate that: 3.22 / 32.2. Let me do the division. 32 goes into 3.22 about 0.1 times because 32 * 0.1 is 3.2, so approximately 0.1 slugs. Let me check: 32.2 * 0.1 is 3.22, exactly. So the container's mass is 0.1 slugs.

So then, the total mass when filled is 1.95 slugs. The mass of the water must be the total mass minus the container's mass. So 1.95 - 0.1 = 1.85 slugs. Wait, no, wait a second. Because when the container is filled, the total mass is 1.95 slugs, which includes both the container and the water. So yeah, water's mass is 1.95 - 0.1 = 1.85 slugs.

Now, the weight of the water would be mass times g. So 1.85 slugs * 32.2 ft/s². Let me calculate that. 1.85 * 32.2. Hmm. Let's break it down: 1 * 32.2 is 32.2, 0.85 * 32.2 is... 0.8 *32.2 is 25.76, and 0.05 *32.2 is 1.61, so 25.76+1.61=27.37. So 32.2 + 27.37 = 59.57 lb force. So the weight of the water is approximately 59.57 lb force.

Next, finding the volume of the water. I know that density is mass per unit volume (density = mass/volume), but wait, no, in the English system, weight is involved. Oh wait, the density given is 62.4 lb force per cubic foot. Wait, density in English units is usually lb mass per cubic foot, but this is given as lb force. Hmm, maybe it's weight density, which is the weight per unit volume.

Wait, weight density (often called specific weight) is indeed weight divided by volume. So if the density is 62.4 lb force per cubic foot, then density (weight) = weight/volume => so volume = weight/density.

So, the weight of the water is 59.57 lb force, and the density is 62.4 lb force/ft³. So volume is 59.57 / 62.4. Let me compute that. 59.57 divided by 62.4. Hmm. Let's approximate: 62.4 is about 60, so 60/60 is 1, but 59.57 is a little less than 62.4. So perhaps around 0.955 ft³.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately: 59.57 /62.4. Let me do this division. 62.4 goes into 59.57 how many times? Let me write it as 5957 divided by 62400, but perhaps it's easier to approximate. 62.4 * 0.95 = 62.4 * 0.9 (56.16) + 62.4 *0.05 (3.12) = 59.28. Oh, 0.95 gives 59.28, which is very close to 59.57. So 59.57 is a bit more than 0.95, perhaps 0.955. Because 62.4 *0.955 = let's see: 62.4 * 0.9 =56.16, 0.05*62.4=3.12, 0.005*62.4=0.312. So 56.16+3.12=59.28 +0.312=59.592, which is almost exactly the numerator we have, 59.57. So volume is approximately 0.955 ft³.

Looking at the options, option C is 59.57 lb force and 0.955 ft³. So that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the mass of the empty container. The weight of the empty container is given as 3.22 lb force, and weight is related to mass by the formula:

\[
W = m \cdot g
\]

where \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \). Solving for the mass of the container:

\[
m_{\text{container}} = \frac{W_{\text{container}}}{g} = \frac{3.22}{32.2} = 0.1 \, \text{slugs}.
\]

The total mass of the container and water is given as 1.95 slugs. Therefore, the mass of the water is:

\[
m_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{total}} - m_{\text{container}} = 1.95 - 0.1 = 1.85 \, \text{slugs}.
\]

Next, the weight of the water is calculated using \( W = m \cdot g \):

\[
W_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot g = 1.85 \cdot 32.2 = 59.57 \, \text{lb force}.
\]

To find the volume of the water, we use the density of water, which is given as \( 62.4 \, \text{lb force/ft}^3 \). The relationship between weight, density, and volume is:

\[
\text{density} = \frac{W}{V} \quad \Rightarrow \quad V = \frac{W}{\text{density}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_{\text{water}} = \frac{W_{\text{water}}}{\text{density}} = \frac{59.57}{62.4} \approx 0.955 \, \text{ft}^3.
\]

Thus, the weight of the water is approximately \( 59.57 \, \text{lb force} \), and its volume is approximately \( 0.955 \, \text{ft}^3 \). Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 59.57 lb force, 0.955 ft³.**
