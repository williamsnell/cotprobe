Okay, so I've got this question here about nucleotide bases in RNA. Let's see... I remember that RNA and DNA have some differences in their structures. Hmm, the question is asking which of the listed options is NOT found in RNA.

Alright, let's look at the options. Option A is deoxyribose. Wait, I think deoxyribose is a sugar found in DNA. RNA uses ribose instead. So if the question is about RNA, deoxyribose wouldn't be present. That might be the answer.

Option B is phosphate. Both DNA and RNA have phosphate groups as part of their backbone. So phosphate is present in RNA, so B isn't the correct answer.

Option C is cytosine. I'm pretty sure cytosine is a base found in both RNA and DNA. So C isn't the one we're looking for.

Option D is nitrogenous base. Well, all the bases are nitrogenous, like adenine, thymine, etc. So RNA definitely has nitrogenous bases. So D isn't right.

Option E is uracil. Oh, right! RNA uses uracil instead of thymine, which is in DNA. So E is present in RNA, so it's not the answer.

Option F is thymine. Thymine is in DNA, replacing uracil. So RNA doesn't have thymine. Wait, so if the question asks which isn't found in RNA, F could be the correct answer. But earlier I thought A might be correct. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the question is about nucleotide bases. Deoxyribose is a sugar, not a base. Oh, right! The options are about the bases, not the sugars. So the question is which base isn't in RNA.

So, the bases in RNA are adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). DNA has thymine (T) instead of uracil. So the base not found in RNA would be thymine. So looking at the options, F is thymine. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. Deoxyribose is a component of DNA, but the question is about the bases. So the bases in RNA are A, U, C, G. Thymine is only in DNA. So the correct answer is F: Thymine.

The question asks which nucleotide base is not found in RNA. RNA contains the bases adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Thymine (T), on the other hand, is found in DNA but not in RNA. While deoxyribose is a sugar specific to DNA, it is not a base, so the correct answer focuses on thymine as the base not present in RNA.

Answer: F
