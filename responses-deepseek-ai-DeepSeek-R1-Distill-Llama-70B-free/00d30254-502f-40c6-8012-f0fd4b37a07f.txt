Okay, so I've got this question about Ethan, a new preschool student who isn't talking or playing with others during center time. The question is asking which strategy would best help him develop interpersonal relationships. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is the right choice.

First, I should think about what's going on with Ethan. He's new, so maybe he's feeling shy or anxious. Preschoolers often take time to adjust to new environments, especially if they're not used to being around a lot of other kids. So, the teacher needs to find a way to help him feel comfortable and build connections with his peers.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Asking Ethan to lead a group activity without support. Hmm, that might be too much pressure for him. If he's already not interacting, putting him in charge could make him more anxious or resistant.

Option B: Ignoring the issue and hoping it improves. That doesn't seem proactive. Kids might need guidance, especially if they're struggling socially. Ignoring it could mean Ethan doesn't get the help he needs.

Option C: Moving him to a different classroom with older kids. I'm not sure about that. Older kids might have different dynamics, and Ethan might still feel out of place. Plus, being in a class with same-age peers is usually better for social development.

Option D: Assigning a partner for Ethan. That sounds promising. Pairing him with another student could provide a buddy system, making it easier for Ethan to engage without feeling overwhelmed. The partner could help him join in activities.

Option E: Speaking with his parents. While communication with parents is important, the question is specifically about strategies in the classroom. So this might be more of a secondary step after trying other methods.

Option F: Reprimanding him. That's definitely not a good idea. It could make Ethan feel worse and more reluctant to interact.

Option G: Demonstrating empathy during conflicts. Empathy is important, but the question is about helping Ethan interact, not just during conflicts. It's a broader issue than just handling conflicts.

Option H: Encouraging without support. Encouragement is good, but Ethan might need more than just that. He might need some structure or assistance to actually participate.

Option I: Modeling affection. While showing appropriate affection is part of a positive classroom environment, it's more about the teacher's behavior rather than directly helping Ethan interact with peers.

Option J: Encouraging students to talk about feelings. Emotional awareness is helpful, but again, it's more general. The question is about a specific strategy to help Ethan engage socially.

So, putting it all together, option D seems like the best approach. By assigning a partner, Ethan gets a supportive peer which can make it easier for him to start interacting. It provides a structured way for him to participate without feeling isolated. The teacher can facilitate this pairing, perhaps by choosing a friendly and outgoing student who can help draw Ethan out.

The best strategy to help Ethan develop interpersonal relationships is to assign him a partner during center time. This approach provides structured support, allowing Ethan to interact with a peer in a more comfortable and guided environment.

Answer: D
