C: explicit costs are higher than implicit costs.
D: total revenues from production are equal to the sum of explicit and implicit costs.
E: total revenues from production are lower than the sum of explicit and implicit costs.
F: explicit costs are equal to implicit costs.
G: implicit costs are higher than explicit costs.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about normal profit. Hmm, I remember that normal profit is when a firm's total revenue equals its total costs, which includes both explicit and implicit costs. Let me think through this carefully.

The question is asking, when a firm is earning a normal profit, which statement is true. The options are A to J. Let me go through each one.

Option A says total revenues equal implicit costs. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because I think normal profit is when revenues cover both explicit and implicit costs. So A can't be correct.

Option B: Total revenues equal explicit costs. No, that's only accounting profit, maybe. Economic profit would consider implicit costs too. So B isn't right either.

Option C: Explicit costs higher than implicit. Not necessarily. It depends on the firm. But the question is about what's true when they're making normal profit, not about which is higher. So C's probably not the answer.

Option D: Total revenues equal the sum of explicit and implicit costs. Oh wait, that makes sense. Because normal profit is when you cover all costs, both explicit (like rent, wages) and implicit (like the owner's opportunity cost). So D sounds correct.

Option E: Revenues lower than total costs. That would mean a loss, so E's not right.

Option F: Explicit equals implicit. Not necessarily true. It depends on the firm, but the question isn't about that. So F's out.

Option G: Implicit higher than explicit. Again, not necessarily, and it's not about the equality in normal profit, so G's not the answer.

Option H: Revenues higher than total costs. That would mean an economic profit beyond normal, so H's incorrect.

Option I: Revenues are double total costs. That's way too much. So I's wrong.

Option J: Implicit costs equal revenue minus explicit. Wait, that's the definition of implicit costs, right? Because implicit costs = total costs - explicit costs. So J could be a correct statement in general, but the question is about when they're earning a normal profit. So in that case, when revenues equal total costs (explicit + implicit), then implicit would be revenues minus explicit, which is J. But wait, isn't that always true, not just when normal profit is earned? Because whether you're making a profit or loss, implicit costs are always total costs minus explicit. So J is a general statement. But the question is about when the firm is earning a normal profit, so the correct answer is D because it's the condition for normal profit.

Wait, so the correct answer should be D. Let me double-check. Normal profit is when TR = TC, where TC includes explicit and implicit. So yes, D says TR equals the sum of both, which is correct.

When a firm is earning a normal profit, it means that its total revenue (TR) is equal to its total costs (TC), which include both explicit costs (direct expenses like wages and rent) and implicit costs (indirect expenses like the opportunity cost of the owner's time or capital). 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Normal profit is not when TR equals only implicit costs.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Normal profit is not when TR equals only explicit costs.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The relationship between explicit and implicit costs is not fixed and does not define normal profit.  
- **D**: Correct. Normal profit occurs when TR equals the sum of explicit and implicit costs.  
- **E**: Incorrect. If TR is lower than total costs, the firm incurs a loss, not a normal profit.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Explicit and implicit costs are not necessarily equal during normal profit.  
- **G**: Incorrect. The comparison between implicit and explicit costs is irrelevant to the definition of normal profit.  
- **H**: Incorrect. If TR exceeds total costs, the firm earns an economic profit, not a normal profit.  
- **I**: Incorrect. TR being double the sum of total costs is not related to normal profit.  
- **J**: Incorrect. While implicit costs are calculated as total costs minus explicit costs, this is a general accounting relationship and not specific to normal profit.

The correct answer is **D**, as it directly aligns with the definition of normal profit. 

Answer: D
