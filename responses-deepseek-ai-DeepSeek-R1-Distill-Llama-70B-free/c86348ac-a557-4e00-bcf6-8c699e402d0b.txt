Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the question is about the profit-sharing relationship in a general partnership where the partners have only agreed on voting percentages, which are unequal. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that in a general partnership, profits are typically shared equally unless there's an agreement stating otherwise. But wait, that's when the agreement specifies profit-sharing ratios. Here, the question says they've only agreed on voting percentages, not on how profits are shared. So, does the voting percentage affect profit sharing?

Hmm, in partnerships, voting rights often relate to the management and control of the business rather than directly determining profit shares. So, if they've only set up voting percentages, the profit sharing might default to an equal split. But wait, the voting shares are unequal. Does that imply anything about their contributions or roles?

Wait, no. Voting shares usually pertain to decision-making. Unless the partnership agreement explicitly ties profit sharing to voting percentages, they're separate. So if the partners didn't agree on profit-sharing ratios, the default would be equal sharing, regardless of their contributions or voting rights.

Looking at the options:

Option I says partners share equally. That seems to fit because in the absence of a specific profit-sharing agreement, they split profits equally.

Other options: Option B talks about contributions to capital, which is more relevant if they had agreed based on capital contributions. Option C says in proportion to voting percentage, but I don't think that's the default. Option F mentions a predetermined ratio, which isn't the case here because they didn't agree on that. So the correct answer should be I.

In a general partnership, when there is no specific agreement on profit sharing, profits are typically shared equally among partners. The question specifies that the partners have only agreed on voting percentages, which pertain to decision-making rather than profit distribution. Since there is no mention of a profit-sharing agreement, the default rule of equal distribution applies. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I**: Correct, as it aligns with the default rule of equal profit sharing in the absence of a specific agreement.
- Other options either misinterpret the role of voting percentages or introduce factors (like capital contributions or predetermined ratios) that are not relevant here.

Thus, the correct answer is that partners share equally.
