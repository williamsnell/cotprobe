Okay, so I've got this question about defining culture and understanding what Benedict meant by cultural relativity in 1934. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the question asks two things: defining culture and explaining cultural relativity as per Benedict. Wait, but the options are only about cultural relativity, so maybe the first part is just context.

I remember that culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a group or society. But that's probably not directly needed here since the options focus on the second part.

Now, cultural relativity. I think it's a concept in anthropology. From what I recall, cultural relativism is the idea that you should understand a culture on its own terms, without judging it by the standards of another culture. So it's about not being ethnocentric and respecting each culture's practices within their context.

Benedict was an anthropologist, right? She wrote about this. So she probably argued that each culture should be evaluated based on its own values and norms, rather than some universal standard. That would mean that practices which seem strange to outsiders might make sense within the cultural context.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Comparing without bias. Hmm, that sounds a bit like relativism, but it's more about the method of comparison. I think relativism is more about understanding within the culture's own context, not just comparing.

Option B: Superiority of one's culture. That's the opposite, more like ethnocentrism.

Option C: Economic system for cultural goods. Doesn't seem right, that's more economics or material culture, not relativism.

Option D: Genetic inheritance of culture. No, culture is learned, not genetic.

Option E: Study of differences. That's more like comparative studies, not relativism.

Option F: Behavior understood within cultural context. Yes, that fits. Because relativism is about evaluating behavior within the culture it belongs to.

Option G: Adaptation to environment. That's more about how culture develops in response to surroundings, maybe like functionalism.

Option H: Transmitted through language/symbols. That's about how culture is passed on, not relativism.

Option I: All cultures are equal. Well, relativism does imply that no culture is inherently superior, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what Benedict meant. It's more about understanding each culture's internal logic rather than making value judgments about equality.

Option J: Adopting foreign elements. That's more about acculturation or diffusion.

So between F and I. F says behavior can only be understood within its cultural environment. I says all cultures are equal.

Wait, cultural relativism doesn't necessarily say all cultures are equal in value, but rather that each should be judged on their own terms. So it's more about understanding and evaluating within their context, not making a value judgment about equality.

So option F seems correct. It's about understanding behavior in its own cultural context, which is what relativism is all about.

Cultural relativity, as described by Benedict (1934), is the belief that human behavior can only be understood and evaluated within the context of its cultural environment. This concept emphasizes the importance of analyzing cultural practices and values without imposing external standards or biases, allowing for a deeper understanding of each culture's unique logic and norms.

Answer: F
