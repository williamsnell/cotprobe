Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Haber process, I think. The reaction is 3H2(g) + N2(g) → 2NH3(g). The question is asking me to find the total pressure at equilibrium given certain conditions. Hmm, let's break this down.

Alright, the problem states that a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen in a 3:1 mole ratio is passed over a catalyst at 400°C. The mole fraction of ammonia in the equilibrium mixture should be 10%, and Kp is given as 0.00164 atm^-2. I need to calculate the total pressure.

Wait, so the mole fraction of NH3 is 10%, which is 0.1. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that for reactions involving gases, the equilibrium can be analyzed using partial pressures. Oh right, Kp is the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures.

The reaction is 3H2 + N2 ↔ 2NH3. The stoichiometric coefficients are 3, 1, and 2 for H2, N2, and NH3 respectively. So the expression for Kp would be (P_NH3)^2 / (P_H2)^3 * P_N2).

But wait, I need to set up an ICE table maybe. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. Let's see.

The initial mole ratio is 3:1 for H2:N2. Let's assume that we start with, say, 3 moles of H2 and 1 mole of N2. But wait, when they react, some will convert to NH3. But since the mole fraction of NH3 is 10%, that might help.

Wait, mole fraction is (moles of NH3) / (total moles). At equilibrium, the mole fraction is 0.1. Let's denote the total moles at equilibrium as n_total. Then, moles of NH3 = 0.1 * n_total.

Let me define variables. Let me let the initial moles be 3a and a for H2 and N2, respectively. Because their ratio is 3:1. So initial H2 =3a, N2=a, NH3=0.

At equilibrium, let's say that x moles of N2 have reacted. So for every mole of N2 that reacts, 3 moles of H2 react, producing 2 moles of NH3. So the change would be:

H2: 3a - 3x
N2: a - x
NH3: 0 + 2x

So the total moles at equilibrium would be (3a - 3x) + (a - x) + 2x = 4a - 2x.

The mole fraction of NH3 is [2x] / [4a - 2x] = 0.1. So:

2x / (4a - 2x) = 0.1
Multiply both sides by denominator: 2x = 0.1*(4a - 2x)
2x = 0.4a - 0.2x
Bring 0.2x to left: 2.2x = 0.4a
So x = (0.4a) / 2.2 = (4a/10)/(11/5) )= (4a/10)*(5/11) )= (20a)/(110) )= (2a)/11.

So x is (2a)/11.

Now, the partial pressures. Let's assume the total pressure is P. The partial pressure of each gas is their mole fraction multiplied by P.

So, P_NH3 = 0.1 * P.

P_H2 = [ (3a - 3x) / (4a - 2x) ) ] * P.

Similarly, P_N2 = [ (a - x) / (4a - 2x) ) ] * P.

Wait, let's compute 3a -3x. Since x=2a/11, 3a -3*(2a/11) = 3a*(1 - 2/11) )= 3a*(9/11) )=27a/11.

Similarly, a -x = a - 2a/11 = (11a -2a)/11 =9a/11.

So the mole fractions:

Mole fraction of H2: (27a/11) / (4a - 2x) → wait, what's 4a -2x?

4a -2x =4a - 2*(2a/11) =4a -4a/11 = (44a -4a)/11 =40a/11.

So, mole fraction of H2 is (27a/11) / (40a/11) )=27/40.

Mole fraction of N2 is (9a/11) / (40a/11) )=9/40.

So, P_H2 = (27/40) P, P_N2 = (9/40) P, and P_NH3 = 0.1 P.

Now, plug into the Kp expression.

Kp = ( (P_NH3)^2 ) / ( (P_H2)^3 * P_N2 ) )

Substituting:

Kp = ( (0.1 P)^2 ) / ( ( (27/40 P)^3 ) * (9/40 P) ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (0.01 P²)

Denominator: (27^3 /40^3) * P^3 ) * (9/40 P) ) = (27^3 *9)/(40^4) ) * P^4.

Wait, 27^3 is 19683, 9 is 9, so 19683 *9 = 177147. 40^4 is 40*40*40*40= 2560000.

So denominator becomes (177147 / 2560000 ) * P^4.

So putting it all together:

Kp = (0.01 P²) / ( (177147 / 2560000) P^4 ) )

Simplify the fractions. 0.01 is 1/100.

So,

Kp = ( (1/100) P² ) / ( (177147 /2560000) P^4 )

Which is (1/100) / (177147/2560000 ) ) * ( P² / P^4 )

Simplify the constants:

(1/100) * (2560000 /177147 ) ) = (2560000) / (100 *177147 )

Wait, 2560000 ÷ 100 is 25600. So 25600 /177147 ≈ let's compute that.

Hmm, 177147 ÷25600 is roughly 6.92, so 1/6.92 ≈ 0.1445. Wait, no, because 25600 ÷177147 = approximately 0.1445.

Wait, 177147 *0.1445 ≈ 177147 *0.1=17714.7; 177147*0.04=7085.88; 177147*0.0045≈797.16. So sum: 17714.7 +7085.88=24799.58 +797.16≈25596.74. Which is close to 25600, so 0.1445.

So 0.1445.

Then, the P terms: P² / P^4 = 1/P².

So putting it together:

Kp = 0.1445 * (1 / P² )

Given that Kp is 0.00164 atm^-2.

So,

0.00164 = 0.1445 / P²

Wait, solving for P²:

P² = 0.1445 / 0.00164

Compute that: 0.1445 /0.00164 ≈ let's see.

0.00164 is 1.64e-3.

0.1445 / 0.00164 = (144.5e-3 ) / (1.64e-3 ) ) = (144.5 /1.64 ) ≈ 88.11.

So P² = 88.11 → P ≈ sqrt(88.11) ≈ 9.39 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 9.4 atm. So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium of the reaction:

\[
3\text{H}_2(g) + \text{N}_2(g) \leftrightarrow 2\text{NH}_3(g)
\]

### Step 1: Initial Setup and ICE Table
The initial mole ratio of hydrogen to nitrogen is 3:1. Let the initial moles of hydrogen be \(3a\) and nitrogen be \(a\). At equilibrium, let \(x\) moles of nitrogen react. The changes in moles are:

- \(\text{H}_2\): \(3a - 3x\)
- \(\text{N}_2\): \(a - x\)
- \(\text{NH}_3\): \(2x\)

The total moles at equilibrium are:

\[
\text{Total moles} = (3a - 3x) + (a - x) + 2x = 4a - 2x
\]

### Step 2: Mole Fraction of \(\text{NH}_3\)
The mole fraction of ammonia is given as 10% (\(0.1\)). Thus:

\[
\text{Mole fraction of } \text{NH}_3 = \frac{2x}{4a - 2x} = 0.1
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
2x = 0.1(4a - 2x) \implies 2x = 0.4a - 0.2x \implies 2.2x = 0.4a \implies x = \frac{2a}{11}
\]

### Step 3: Partial Pressures
Let the total pressure at equilibrium be \(P\). The partial pressures are proportional to the mole fractions:

- \(\text{P}_{\text{NH}_3} = 0.1P\)
- \(\text{P}_{\text{H}_2} = \frac{3a - 3x}{4a - 2x}P = \frac{27}{40}P\)
- \(\text{P}_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{a - x}{4a - 2x}P = \frac{9}{40}P\)

### Step 4: Equilibrium Constant Expression
The equilibrium constant \(K_p\) is given as:

\[
K_p = \frac{(\text{P}_{\text{NH}_3})^2}{(\text{P}_{\text{H}_2})^3 (\text{P}_{\text{N}_2})}
\]

Substituting the partial pressures:

\[
K_p = \frac{(0.1P)^2}{\left(\frac{27}{40}P\right)^3 \left(\frac{9}{40}P\right)}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
K_p = \frac{0.01P^2}{\frac{177147}{2560000}P^4} = \frac{0.01}{\frac{177147}{2560000}} \cdot \frac{1}{P^2}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \(P\)
Given \(K_p = 0.00164 \, \text{atm}^{-2}\), solve for \(P^2\):

\[
0.00164 = \frac{0.1445}{P^2} \implies P^2 = \frac{0.1445}{0.00164} \approx 88.11 \implies P \approx \sqrt{88.11} \approx 9.39 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer
The total pressure at equilibrium is approximately **9.4 atm**, which corresponds to **option A**.
