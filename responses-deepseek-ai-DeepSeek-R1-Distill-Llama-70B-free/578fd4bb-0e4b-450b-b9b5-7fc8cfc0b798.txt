Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Nathanson and which kind of retributivism he supports. I remember that retributivism is a theory of punishment that focuses on punishing the offender because they deserve it for what they've done. So it's more about justice and less about deterrence or rehabilitation.

The options are A to J, each with different terms. I'm a bit rusty on the exact types, so I need to think through each one. Let's start by recalling what each term means in the context of retributivism.

Proportional retributivism (option A) suggests that the punishment should fit the crime. Like, the severity of the punishment matches the severity of the offense. I think this is a common form, maybe linked to people like Kant.

Equality (B) could relate to equal punishment for equal crimes, but I'm not sure if that's a specific type or just a principle within retributivism.

Retaliatory (C) makes me think of the 'eye for an eye' approach. It's more about revenge or retaliation, which is a form of retributivism but perhaps a more primitive or less nuanced version.

Punitive (D) is a broader term. Punishment is about infliction of pain, so punitive retributivism would focus on the punishment aspect as deserved. But I'm not sure if Nathanson specifically supports this.

Compensatory (E) might involve making amends, perhaps through restitution. That feels more like restorative justice, which I'm not sure is the same as retributivism.

Absolute (F) would mean that punishment is absolute regardless of circumstances, but I don't recall Nathanson supporting that.

Restorative (G) is about repairing harm to the victim and community, which is more of a separate theory, not retributivist.

Corrective (H) is about reforming the offender, which leans more towards rehabilitation than retribution.

Preventive (I) aims to prevent future crimes, which is more of a utilitarian approach, not retributivist.

Consequential (J) focuses on the outcomes, like deterrence, again more utilitarian.

Wait, but the question is about Nathanson. From what I remember, Nathanson wrote about retributivism and its different forms. I think he talked about three types: punitive, compensatory, and distributive. But the options don't include distributive.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again. Oh, right, Nathanson distinguishes between different forms of retributivism. He supports a version where the punishment is proportionate to the offense. So proportional retributivism, which is option A.

Alternatively, I might be confusing him with someone else. Another thought: some sources mention that Nathanson argues against pure retributivism and for a more mixed theory, but the question is about which kind he supports.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. I think Nathanson is associated with the idea that retribution can be justified in a way that's proportionate. So the answer would be proportional, which is option A.

Nathanson supports proportional retributivism, which holds that the punishment should fit the crime, with its severity matching the offense's severity.
