Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Section 2022(a) of a state's medical licensing code provides:"For the purposes of this statute, only those persons who have graduated from an optometry school located in the state and accredited by the board of optometrists shall be licensed to conduct the practice of optometry within the state. "A doctor graduated from a school of optometry located in a neighboring state. The following month, the doctor was granted a license to practice optometry in that neighboring state by its board of optometrists. For approximately one year, the doctor was engaged in the practice of optometry in the neighboring state. Subsequently, the doctor decided to relocate his practice to the state for which Section 2022(a) applies. The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice. If the doctor challenges the constitutionality of Section 2022(a) of the medical licensing statute as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following, if factually true, is the WEAKEST defense that the state could offer?

Options:

A: The statute will help to increase the number of local optometrists who can handle emergencies.
B: The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.
C: The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.
D: The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.
E: The statute will help to ensure that only optometrists who are familiar with the state's unique vision-related health issues practice in the state.
F: The statute will help to provide job security for the state's board of optometrists.
G: The statute will help to maintain the reputation of the state's optometry board.
H: The statute will help to promote the state's optometry school.
I: The statute will help to ensure that the state's optometry school graduates have priority in getting licensed.
J: The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically the Commerce Clause. Hmm, I remember the Commerce Clause deals with the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce and how states can't unduly burden it. The question is about a state's medical licensing code, Section 2022(a), which requires optometrists to graduate from an in-state accredited school to get licensed. 

The scenario is that a doctor graduated from an optometry school in a neighboring state, got licensed there, practiced for a year, then moved to this state and started practicing without knowing about this law. The state board told him to stop, and he's challenging the law under the Commerce Clause.

The question is asking which defense, if true, would be the weakest. So, I need to think about what makes a state law a strong or weak defense against a Commerce Clause challenge.

I recall that when a state law is challenged under the Commerce Clause, the court uses the Pike v. Bruce Church test. The law is valid if the local benefits outweigh the burden on interstate commerce. If the law discriminates against out-of-state businesses in favor of in-state ones, it's usually struck down unless it serves a legitimate local purpose that can't be achieved through less restrictive means.

The weakest defense would be one that's not a strong justification, maybe one that's based on protectionist motives or lacks a legitimate purpose.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The statute helps increase local optometrists for emergencies. That sounds like a legitimate concern. Having enough practitioners is important, especially for emergencies. This might be a valid defense.

Option B: Ensuring practicing optometrists are subject to standards of a regulatory body. That sounds like a legitimate purpose, ensuring quality and competence. But wait, if the doctor is already licensed elsewhere, maybe this isn't as strong. Or maybe it's about ensuring they meet the state's specific standards, which could be a valid reason.

Option C: Ensuring only the most qualified practice. This could be a bit weak if the state's schools aren't necessarily better. But it's about quality, so might be a decent defense.

Option D: Protects in-state optometrists from competition. Oh, this sounds like protectionism. That's a red flag because the Commerce Clause is against economic protectionism. If the state's defense is that they're protecting their own practitioners from out-of-state competition, that's a weak defense because it's not a legitimate governmental interestâ€”it's just helping local businesses at the expense of others.

Option E: Ensuring familiarity with unique health issues. That could be a strong defense if the state has specific vision health problems that local graduates would know about. It shows a legitimate purpose beyond just protecting local interests.

Options F, G, H, I, J: F is about job security for the board members, which doesn't make sense. G is about the board's reputation, which seems irrelevant. H is promoting the state's school, which might be a weak defense because it's about the school's reputation, not public health. I is giving priority to in-state graduates, which again sounds protectionist. J is about having enough optometrists, which is similar to A but maybe less specific.

So, the weakest defense would be one that's clearly protectionist or lacks a legitimate purpose. D and I seem to be about protecting in-state practitioners. D says it's to protect from competition, which is bad. I says priority to in-state graduates, which is also protectionist.

Between D and I, D is more explicit about protecting from competition, which is a classic invalid reason under the Commerce Clause. So the weakest defense is D.

The weakest defense the state could offer is that the statute helps protect in-state optometrists from competition. This reasoning is explicitly protectionist and violates the Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from enacting laws that unduly burden interstate commerce to favor local economic interests. Protectionism is not a legitimate governmental interest and would likely fail judicial scrutiny.

Answer: D
