Okay, so I've got this problem about a synchronous machine's flux distribution curve, and I need to find the induced emfs at no-load caused by the harmonics relative to the fundamental. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The flux distribution is given by B_x = 100 sin(x/τ * π) - 14 sin(3x/τ * π) - 20 sin(5x/τ * π) + 1 sin(7x/τ * π). Wait, that's probably a Fourier series expansion, right? Because the flux in electrical machines often has harmonic components represented this way.

I remember that when a flux has harmonic components, it induces emfs in the armature windings. The fundamental component is the main one, and the harmonics are higher frequencies. The induced emf for each harmonic depends on its amplitude relative to the fundamental.

So the question is asking for the ratios E3/E1, E5/E1, E7/E1. The options are all fractions, so I need to compute each harmonic's amplitude divided by the fundamental's amplitude.

Looking at the given equation, the coefficients are 100, -14, -20, and +1 for the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th harmonics respectively. Wait, does each term represent the amplitude of that harmonic? I think so. So the fundamental (n=1) has a coefficient of 100. The third harmonic (n=3) is -14, fifth is -20, seventh is +1.

But wait, when it comes to induced emfs, I think the emf is proportional to the amplitude of the harmonic. So for each harmonic, E_n is proportional to the amplitude of B_n, right? Because the induced emf is related to the rate of change of flux linkage, which depends on the flux density's harmonic content.

So for E3, the amplitude is the coefficient of the 3rd harmonic, which is 14. Similarly, E5 is 20, E7 is 1. And the fundamental E1 is 100.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, are the signs important? I don't think so because the sign would affect the phase, not the magnitude. So the ratios should just consider the absolute values.

So E3/E1 = 14/100 = 0.14? But looking at the options, none of them have 0.14. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps there's a factor involved. Oh, right! In a synchronous machine, the induced emf for harmonics might involve some scaling based on the number of poles or something else. Alternatively, I might have forgotten that the induced emf is proportional to the harmonic number times the flux amplitude.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The emf induced by a harmonic is E_n = E_1 * (n * B_n / B_1). Or is it E_n = (n * B_n) / B_1 * E_1? Because the induced emf depends on the harmonic number. Because higher harmonics rotate faster, but in terms of magnitude, it's proportional to n times the flux amplitude.

Wait, no. Let me get this more clearly. The induced emf for the nth harmonic is proportional to n times the amplitude of that harmonic's flux, because the flux's rate of change (which determines emf) increases with frequency, and frequency is proportional to n.

So E_n is proportional to n * B_n. So E3 would be 3 * 14, E5=5*20, E7=7*1. And E1 is 1 * 100.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about E_n as fractions of E_1. So E3/E1 would be (3*14)/(1*100) = 42/100 = 0.42. But none of the options have that either. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the induced emf relates to the flux harmonics.

Alternatively, perhaps the emf induced by each harmonic is proportional to the amplitude of that harmonic. Because the fundamental emf E1 is proportional to B1, and each E_n is proportional to B_n. So E3/E1 would be B3/B1, which is 14/100 = 0.14, E5/E1=20/100=0.2, E7/E1=1/100=0.01.

Wait, but looking at the options, none have these exact ratios. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. I think the correct approach is that the induced emf is proportional to the harmonic number times the amplitude. So E_n = (n * B_n) * k, where k is a constant. Then E1 = 1 * B1 * k. So E_n/E1 = (n * B_n) / (1 * B1).

So E3/E1 = (3 *14)/100 → 42/100=0.42.

E5/E1=5*20/100=100/100=1.

E7/E1=7*1/100=0.07.

But looking at the options, none of the options have E5/E1=1. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the induced emf for a harmonic is just proportional to the amplitude of that harmonic. Because the E1 is from B1, and E3 from B3, etc. So the ratios would be E3/E1=14/100=0.14, E5=20/100=0.2, E7=1/100=0.01.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: 0.05, 0.01, 0.002. No.

Option E: 0.03, 0.006, 0.0012. No.

Option C: E3=0.075, E5=0.01435, E7=0.00072. Hmm, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the flux distribution equation is given as the peak value. So the fundamental is 100, but the other terms are the amplitudes of the respective harmonics. So for the induced emf, each harmonic's emf is proportional to (n * Bn). So E3 is 3*14, E5=5*20, E7=7*1. But E1 is 1*100.

So the ratios would be:

E3/E1 = (3*14)/(1*100) = 42/100 = 0.42.

E5/E1= (5*20)/100 = 100/100=1.

E7/E1=7*1/100=0.07.

But none of the options match these numbers. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I'm supposed to find the relative amplitudes without considering the harmonic number. Or perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the emf is proportional to the amplitude without considering the harmonic order. So E3 is just the amplitude of the third harmonic, so 14, E1 is 100. So E3/E1 =14/100=0.14. Similarly, E5/E1=0.2, E7/E1=0.01. But none of the options have these values.

Wait, let's look again at the options. Maybe one of the options has 0.14 for E3, but looking at the options:

Option B: E3=0.00072, which is way too small.

Option C: E3=0.075.

Option D: 0.05.

Option E: 0.03.

Option G: 0.09.

Hmm. None have 0.14. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the given B_x is the peak flux density. But the emf induced depends on the linkage, which is proportional to the integral of flux density over the pole area. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the emf is proportional to the amplitude of each harmonic component.

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for induced emf in a synchronous machine.

The induced emf for a harmonic is given by E_n = (n * ω * k_w_n * N * B_n * l * τ) / (2 * π * a), where ω is the angular velocity, k_w is the winding factor, N is turns, l is length, τ is the pole pitch, and a is the number of parallel paths.

But perhaps for this problem, the key point is that the ratio E_n/E_1 is given by (n * B_n) / (1 * B_1). Because the other factors (like ω, N, etc.) are same for all harmonics and thus cancel out in the ratio.

So E_n/E_1 = (n * B_n) / B_1.

So let's compute each ratio:

E3/E1 = (3 * 14) / 100 = 42/100 = 0.42.

E5/E1 = (5*20)/100 = 100/100 = 1.0.

E7/E1 = (7 *1)/100 = 7/100=0.07.

But looking at the options, none of the E5/E1 ratios is 1.0. So perhaps I'm doing this wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given B_x is the no-load flux, and the emf is proportional to the rate of change of flux. So the fundamental emf is proportional to the fundamental flux, and the harmonic emfs are proportional to their respective flux amplitudes. But wait, this would make E_n/E1 = B_n/B1. So 14/100=0.14, 20/100=0.2, etc.

But again, none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, maybe the given B_x is the maximum value, but the RMS value is what's considered. Or perhaps the expansion includes the amplitude coefficients as peak values, but the induced emf uses the RMS.

Wait, the Fourier series given is probably for the peak flux density. So the coefficients are the amplitudes. So for the fundamental, the amplitude is 100. The third harmonic amplitude is 14, fifth 20, seventh 1.

In terms of RMS, the RMS of a sinusoidal wave is amplitude divided by sqrt(2). So the RMS of E1 is 100 / sqrt(2). Similarly, E3_rms is 14 / sqrt(2), etc. But when calculating the ratio E3/E1, the denominators would cancel, so the ratio would still be 14/100=0.14.

So that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the induced emf's RMS is proportional to the amplitude, so the ratios remain the same.

Wait, maybe I should look for an option where E3 is 0.14, E5 is 0.2, E7=0.01. But looking through the options, none have these.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the harmonic numbers. Let me double-check: The first term is sin(x/τ π), which is the fundamental (n=1). Then sin(3x/τ π)=3rd harmonic (n=3), then 5th, 7th.

So the coefficients are correct.

Hmm, perhaps the given data has a typo? Or perhaps the question is misinterpreted. Alternatively, maybe the coefficients are divided by something else.

Wait, another thought. The flux distribution might be given as a function of position, and the induced emf depends on integrating that over the phase winding. So each harmonic would contribute an emf proportional to its amplitude multiplied by the winding function or something. But that might complicate things beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the induced emf for each harmonic is simply proportional to the amplitude of that harmonic in the flux.

So E3/E1 = 14/100 = 0.14, E5/E1=20/100=0.2, E7/E1=1/100=0.01.

Looking at the options again, none match these values. So maybe I'm missing a factor that scales these ratios.

Wait, maybe I should consider the space harmonics. Wait, in a synchronous machine, the armature reaction creates harmonics, but perhaps this is about the flux produced by the field current, which would produce certain space harmonics.

Wait, the given B_x is probably the air-gap flux density. For a sinusoidal distribution, the fundamental is dominant, but here it's a Fourier series with different harmonics. The induced emf would then be a function of these harmonics.

Wait, another approach: The induced emf in the armature is given by E = (ω * k * N * f), where f is the flux per pole. But for harmonics, each n would contribute E_n = (n * ω * k * N * B_n * something). Hmm, perhaps the fundamental E1 is proportional to B1, and E_n is proportional to n * B_n. So E_n/E1 = (n * B_n)/B1.

So plugging in the numbers:

E3/E1 = (3 *14)/100 = 42/100 = 0.42.

E5/E1 = (5 *20)/100 = 100/100 = 1.0.

E7/E1 = (7 *1)/100 = 7/100 = 0.07.

But again, none of the options match these. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the peak emf values. Or perhaps the given B_x is the RMS value. Oh wait, in the given equation, the coefficients are the peak amplitudes. So when calculating the induced emf, the RMS value would be each coefficient divided by sqrt(2). But when taking the ratio, the sqrt(2) cancels out, so the ratios remain the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck because none of the options match 0.42, 1.0, 0.07.

Wait, maybe I should look for an option where E3 is 0.14, E5=0.2, E7=0.01, but none of the options have these.

Alternatively, perhaps the given B_x is a function of position, and the emf is the integral over the winding, which would involve the winding function and perhaps the number of conductors, which could change the ratios. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the first harmonic as the fundamental, and the others as their respective fractions. So for E3, the ratio is 14/100=0.14, E5=20/100=0.2, E7=0.01. But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the given B_x is in terms of the fundamental component already. Or maybe the question is about the maximum flux, but the emf is related to the RMS. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again: what's the correct way to compute the induced emf by a harmonic.

Wait, I recall that in a synchronous machine, the induced emf for a harmonic is proportional to the harmonic number times the amplitude of that harmonic in the flux. So E_n = n * B_n / B1 * E1.

So for E3/E1 = (3 *14)/100=0.42.

E5/E1 = (5 *20)/100=1.0.

E7/E1=7*1/100=0.07.

But again, none match the options.

Wait, perhaps the coefficients are not the amplitudes but something else. Let me look back at the given equation.

The equation is: B_x= 100 sin(x/τ π) -14 sin(3x/τ π) -20 sin(5 x/τ π) +1 sin(7 x/τ π).

So the coefficients are 100, -14, -20, and +1. So the amplitudes are 100,14,20,1 respectively.

So if E1 is due to 100, E3 due to 14, etc. Then the ratios are E3/E1=14/100=0.14, E5=20/100=0.2, E7=1/100=0.01.

Looking again, none of the options have these exact numbers. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, wait. Oh! I think I might have made a mistake in the harmonic numbering. Because the general term is sin(n π x/τ), so for the fundamental, n=1 (sin(π x/τ)), which is correct. So the third harmonic is n=3, fifth n=5, etc.

Wait, but perhaps the induced emf depends on the harmonic order multiplied by the amplitude, but perhaps the options have E3 as (3 *14)/ (100) =0.42, E5= (5 *20)/100=1.0, E7= (7 *1)/100=0.07. But options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the harmonic voltages relative to the fundamental, and these are in terms of their RMS values. But that wouldn't change the ratios, as I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe the question is about the peak values of the emfs. For example, E3_peak = 3*14=42, E1_peak=100. So E3/E1_peak=0.42. Similarly, E5_peak=100 (5*20), E7_peak=7.

But then the ratios would be 0.42, 1.0, 0.07.

Hmm, but again, none of the options match. So perhaps I'm way off track.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where the ratios are E3=0.14, E5=0.2, E7=0.01. But scanning the options:

Option A: E3=0.1, which is lower than 0.14.

Option D: E3=0.05, E5=0.01, E7=0.002.

Option E: E3=0.03, E5=0.006, E7=0.0012.

Option B: E3=0.00072, E5=0.01435, E7=0.075.

Option C: E3=0.075, E5=0.01435, E7=0.00072.

Option F: E3=0.01435, E5=0.075, E7=0.00072.

Hmm, none match 0.14, 0.2, 0.07.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the harmonic components of the induced emf, not the flux. So the B_x given is the flux, and the induced emf depends on the time derivative of the flux linkage.

Wait, flux linkage is the integral of B over the area. So if B(t) has a sinusoidal component, the flux linkage
