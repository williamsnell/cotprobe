Question:

In a secluded county, where prejudice festers and discrimination flourishes, there is a lovely lake, which the county has developed and maintained for recreational purposes. Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership "standards," as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The plaintiff will prevail, because the company is in violation of the county's approved bylaws.
B: The plaintiff will prevail if she can prove the company's policy is based on gender discrimination.
C: The plaintiff will prevail, because the company's policy is discriminatory and violates her civil rights.
D: The plaintiff will lose, because she can use other facilities within the county.
E: The plaintiff will lose, because the company is a private entity and not subject to equal protection laws.
F: The plaintiff will lose, because the company has the right to set its own membership criteria.
G: The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.
H: The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.
I: The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about equal protection and discrimination. Let me read through the problem again and break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is in a county where there's a lake that's been developed for recreation. The county leased part of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by a prominent family. The lease required the company to build and operate a yacht club with a restaurant, bar, and marina. They pay the county 10% of their net profits as rent. The bylaws were approved by the county, and they say the club is for members only. The membership committee sets high standards and fees, and they only approve applications from men, rejecting all women. There are other similar facilities available to women in the county. A woman is suing the company, claiming her application was denied because of her gender, which violates her equal protection rights.

The question is about which option is correct regarding the outcome of her lawsuit.

First, I need to think about the legal principles involved here. Equal protection under the law is a big issue, especially regarding gender discrimination. The 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause applies to state and local governments, not private entities, unless there's a sufficient nexus with the state (like a public-private partnership or state action).

In this case, the company is a private entity, but it's operating on county-owned land under a lease. The bylaws were reviewed and approved by the county. So, there's a question of whether the county's involvement makes the company's actions subject to equal protection scrutiny.

I remember the Supreme Court case of Moose Lodge v. Irvis, where a private club's discriminatory membership practices were challenged. The Court held that the state's issuance of a liquor license didn't constitute sufficient state action to impose 14th Amendment restrictions on the private club's policies. However, if the private entity is closely tied to the state or performs a public function, then state action might be found.

In this problem, the county leased public land to the company, and the bylaws were approved by the county. But does that make the company's membership decisions a state action? It's a bit tricky. The lease and approval might not be enough to convert the company's actions into state action unless the state is significantly involved in the company's policies.

Another angle is whether the company is a place of public accommodation. If it's considered a public accommodation, then anti-discrimination laws like Title II of the Civil Rights Act would apply. But the company is a private club, and traditionally, private clubs have more leeway in restricting membership, though this varies by jurisdiction and the specific laws.

The options given:

Option A: Plaintiff prevails because the company violated county bylaws. I don't think the bylaws themselves are the issue; the problem is the discrimination. Unless the bylaws prohibited such discrimination, but the scenario doesn't say that.

Option B: She wins if she proves gender discrimination. But the issue is whether the company is subject to equal protection laws. Private companies might not be unless state action is involved.

Option C: She wins because it's discriminatory. But again, private clubs can sometimes discriminate unless they're considered places of public accommodation.

Option D: She loses because other facilities are available. This sounds like the "separate but equal" argument, which is not valid under equal protection. Availability elsewhere doesn't justify discrimination.

Option E: She loses because the company is private. But if there's state action, this wouldn't hold. So E might not be correct if state action is found.

Option F: Company can set its own membership. True for private clubs, unless they're subject to anti-discrimination laws.

Option G: Classifications based on sex haven't been held to violate equal protection. Wait, that's not accurate. The Supreme Court has held that sex-based classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. So G is incorrect.

Option H: She wins unless the company proves an important basis. This sounds like shifting the burden, but in equal protection cases, the plaintiff usually needs to show discrimination; the defendant might then offer a legitimate reason.

Option I: She loses because other facilities are available. Similar to D, which is incorrect because it's a separate issue.

So, considering all this, the key issue is whether the company's actions constitute state action. If the county's involvement in approving bylaws and leasing the land is enough to make the company's policies state action, then the discrimination would be unconstitutional. However, as per Moose Lodge, unless the state is actively involved in the discrimination, it might not be sufficient.

In this case, the bylaws were approved, but the company sets the membership criteria. The county's approval of the bylaws doesn't necessarily mean they approved the discriminatory policies. Unless the county required or encouraged the discrimination, it's probably not state action.

Therefore, the company, as a private entity, can set its own membership criteria, even if discriminatory, unless they're bound by anti-discrimination laws. Since it's a private club and not a public accommodation, they might be allowed to discriminate.

Wait, but the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II, prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation, but private clubs are exempt. So if the yacht club is a private club, not open to the public, then they can discriminate based on gender.

But the question is about equal protection, not just anti-discrimination statutes. So if there's no state action, the 14th Amendment doesn't apply. Therefore, the company's policy, while discriminatory, isn't a violation of equal protection because it's a private entity without state action.

So the woman would lose because the company is private, and unless state action is found, the equal protection claim doesn't hold. Looking at the options, E says she loses because the company is private. But wait, some might argue that the county's involvement (leasing public land, approving bylaws) creates state action. However, in Moose Lodge, the court found that issuing a liquor license wasn't enough. Here, the county's role is a bit more involved, but maybe not enough.

Alternatively, if the facilities are so integrated with the county's operations that they're considered public, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer might be B, where she can prove gender discrimination, implying that if it's proven, she wins. But again, if the company is private and no state action, she can't win on equal protection. Unless there's a state law that prohibits such discrimination by private clubs, but the question doesn't specify that.

Wait, the question is about equal protection under the Constitution, so state action is required. Therefore, without state action, the company's discrimination isn't a constitutional violation, so she can't prevail on 14th Amendment grounds.

So the options: E says she loses because the company is private, which would be correct if there's no state action. But some options might hinge on whether the company's actions are considered state action.

Wait, looking again: the county leased the land and approved the bylaws. The bylaws were part of the lease agreement, so perhaps the county has some authority over the company's policies. If the county approved the bylaws that allowed discriminatory membership, does that make it state action?

In the case where a state creates a corporation or approves bylaws that facilitate discrimination, courts might find state action. For example, in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, the court found state action when a state agency leased space to a private restaurant that discriminated, because the agency was intertwined with the restaurant's operations.

In our case, the county leased the land and approved the bylaws, which included membership criteria. So perhaps there's enough state involvement to constitute state action. If so, then the company's policy would be subject to equal protection, and the discrimination would be unconstitutional.

If that's the case, then option B would be correct: she prevails if she proves gender discrimination. Because once state action is established, the policy would be subject to scrutiny.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the county's role isn't significant enough, then it's not state action. So it's a bit of a toss-up.

Given that the county owns the land, leases it, and approves the bylaws, I think there's a strong argument for state action. Therefore, the company's discrimination would be unconstitutional. So the plaintiff would prevail if she can prove gender discrimination, which is option B.

Wait, but another angle: the company is a private club, and even if there's state action, the court might apply the appropriate level of scrutiny. Sex discrimination is subject to intermediate scrutiny, so the company would need to show that excluding women serves an important government interest and is substantially related to that interest. But the company's reason for excluding women isn't given here, so perhaps the policy wouldn't survive scrutiny.

So putting it all together, the correct answer would be option B: The plaintiff will prevail if she can prove the company's policy is based on gender discrimination. Because if there's state action (due to county involvement), then the discrimination is unconstitutional.

Wait, but in the options, option B says she will prevail if she proves it's based on gender. If state action is found, then yes, she can challenge it. If not, she can't. So the correct answer hinges on whether there's state action.

Alternatively, if there's no state action, then E or F would be correct. So which is it?

In Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, the Supreme Court found state action when a state agency was closely tied to a private business that discriminated. Here, the county leased land to the company, but the company operates independently, setting its own membership policies. The county's approval of the bylaws doesn't necessarily mean they dictated the membership criteria. Unless the county explicitly approved the gender-based exclusion, which they didn't according to the problem statement, the county's involvement might not be enough.

So perhaps there's no state action, making option E correct: she loses because the company is private. But then, in that case, option E would be correct.

Wait, the problem says the bylaws were reviewed and approved by the county. The bylaws allowed the membership committee to set standards, including the gender-based exclusion. So the county approved the bylaws that permitted such discrimination. Does that count as state action?

Hmm, that's a good point. If the county approved the bylaws which allowed the membership committee to set such discriminatory standards, then perhaps the county is facilitating the discrimination, which could constitute state action.

In that case, the company's actions would be considered state action, and the gender discrimination would be a violation of equal protection.

So then, the plaintiff would prevail if she proves the policy is based on gender, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the county's approval of the bylaws is enough to make it state action, then the discrimination is unconstitutional, and she would win.

So I'm leaning towards option B being correct.

Wait, another thought: in the Moose Lodge case, the court said that the state's action in granting a liquor license didn't make the private club's discrimination amount to state action. But in our case, the county owns the land and the facilities, and the lease is for a public purpose (recreation). So perhaps the public function doctrine applies. The public function doctrine holds that when a private entity performs a function traditionally exclusive to the state, it may be considered state action.

Running a public recreational facility could be seen as a public function. Therefore, the company's operation of the yacht club on public land might constitute state action, making the discrimination a constitutional violation.

If that's the case, then the plaintiff would prevail if she proves gender discrimination, which is option B.

But wait, the facilities are built and operated by the company, not the county. So maybe it's not a traditional public function. The company is a private entity running a club, even if on public land. So perhaps it's not enough for state action.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's look at the options again.

Option G says that classifications based on sex haven't been held to violate equal protection. But that's incorrect because the Supreme Court has held that sex-based classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny. So G is wrong.

Option H says she'll prevail unless the company can prove an important basis. That's the intermediate scrutiny standard. If state action is found, then the company's policy would need to meet this standard, which it likely can't. So H would be the correct standard if state action applies.

But the options don't have H as the correct one unless state action is found.

Given all this, I'm torn between options B and E. But considering the county's involvement in leasing the land and approving the bylaws, which allowed the discrimination, I think state action is present. Therefore, the plaintiff would prevail if she proves gender discrimination, making option B correct.

The question revolves around whether a woman's exclusion from a private yacht club based on gender violates her equal protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The key issue is whether the company's actions constitute "state action," as the 14th Amendment applies only to state and local governments or private entities sufficiently intertwined with the state.

The county leased public land to the company and approved its bylaws, which allowed the membership committee to set discriminatory membership criteria. This raises the question of whether the county's involvement creates a sufficient nexus to constitute state action. Relevant legal precedents, such as *Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority* and *Moose Lodge v. Irvis*, suggest that state action may be found if the government is closely tied to the private entity's discriminatory practices. However, in *Moose Lodge*, the court held that issuing a liquor license did not constitute state action, but the facts here involve the county leasing public land and approving bylaws, which could be seen as more significant involvement.

If state action is found, the company's gender-based exclusion would be subject to constitutional scrutiny. Sex-based classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny, requiring the company to prove that the exclusion serves an important government interest and is substantially related to that interest. Given the lack of any stated justification for the exclusion, the policy would likely fail this standard.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The violation is not about the bylaws but about discrimination.
- **Option B**: Correct if state action is found. The plaintiff would prevail by proving gender discrimination.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The discrimination claim requires a showing of state action to invoke constitutional protections.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The availability of other facilities does not justify discrimination.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. If state action is present, the company is not entirely private for constitutional purposes.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Private clubs can set membership criteria, but not if state action is involved.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Sex-based classifications are subject to constitutional scrutiny.
- **Option H**: Correct standard if state action is found, but the question focuses on the outcome, not the legal standard.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Similar to D, this does not justify discrimination.

Given the county's significant involvement in leasing public land and approving bylaws that facilitated discrimination, there is a strong argument for state action. Therefore, the plaintiff would prevail if she proves gender discrimination, making **Option B** the most accurate answer.

Answer: B
