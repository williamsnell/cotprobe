Okay, so I've got this question about research designs, specifically asking about when the Multiple Baseline Design is used. Hmm, I remember that research designs are methods used to structure studies to answer specific questions. Different designs have different purposes based on the situation.

The question gives four options, A to D. The options are about when certain factors are not possible, like reversal, assignment, selection, or enough data. I need to figure out which one applies to the Multiple Baseline Design.

Wait, let me think. I remember that baseline designs are often used in single-subject research, which is common in fields like psychology or education. Single-subject designs focus on individual participants over time, often looking at behavior changes.

The Multiple Baseline Design is one of these single-subject designs. What's its key feature? Oh right, in Multiple Baseline, the intervention is applied across different behaviors, settings, or participants. So instead of doing a reversal (like in an ABAB design), you start with different baselines for each condition.

Why would you use this design? I think it's when you can't reverse the treatment. Like, if the treatment is supposed to have a permanent effect, you can't just take it away once applied. For example, teaching someone a new skill; you can't unteach it to go back to baseline. So reversal isn't feasible in such cases.

So looking at the options, option A is "when reversal is not possible." That fits because if you can't reverse the treatment, you can't use a reversal design, so Multiple Baseline is an alternative.

Wait, let me make sure. The other options: B is when assignment isn't possible. Assignment refers to randomly assigning participants to groups, which is more about experimental designs like RCTs. Multiple Baseline doesn't really deal with thatâ€”it's about within-subject designs.

Option C is when selection is not possible. I'm not sure what selection refers to here, maybe selecting participants? Not sure, but I don't think that's the main issue for Multiple Baseline.

Option D is when there's not enough data. Multiple Baseline might require multiple data points across different baselines, but the main reason for using it isn't about data availability. It's more about the inability to reverse the treatment.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A: when reversal is not possible.

The Multiple Baseline Design is used in single-subject research when reversal of the treatment or intervention is not feasible. This is often the case when the intervention is intended to have a permanent effect, such as teaching a new skill, where reversing the treatment would not be practical or ethical. Among the options provided:

- **A**: Correct, as the design is specifically used when reversal is not possible.  
- **B**: Incorrect, as the design does not primarily address issues with participant assignment.  
- **C**: Incorrect, as the design is not focused on selection issues.  
- **D**: Incorrect, as the design is not primarily used due to data availability.  

Thus, the correct answer is when reversal is not possible.
