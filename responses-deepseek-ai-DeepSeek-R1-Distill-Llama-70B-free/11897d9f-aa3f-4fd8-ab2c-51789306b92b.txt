Okay, so I've got this problem about heat exchangers. Hmm, two counterflow heat exchangers connected in series. I need to find their effectiveness and the UA value for each. Let's see what I remember.

The problem states that they're heating air from 22°C to 30°C using water at 35°C. The flow rate of air is 283.2 L^3/sec. Wait, L^3? Oh, that's probably liters per second, but I need to convert that to kg/s since heat transfer equations usually use mass flow rates.

First, I should find the air properties. I remember that the specific heat of air is around 1005 J/kg·K, and its density is about 1.2 kg/m³. Oh wait, but wait, because 283.2 L/s is 283.2 * 10^-3 m³/s. So m_dot_air = density * volume flow rate. Let me calculate that.

m_dot_air = 1.2 kg/m³ * 283.2e-3 m³/s. Let me compute that: 283.2e-3 is 0.2832 m³/s. So 1.2 * 0.2832 = 0.33984 kg/s. So approximately 0.34 kg/s.

Now, the air is being heated from 22°C to 30°C, which is a temperature rise of 8°C. So the heat required per second is Q = m_dot_air * c_p_air * (T_out - T_in). Plugging in the numbers: 0.33984 kg/s * 1005 J/kg·K * 8 K. Let's compute that.

0.33984 * 1005 = approximately 341.58. Then 341.58 * 8 = 2732.64 Watts. So Q is about 2733 Watts.

Wait, but since these are two heat exchangers in series, each exchanger will contribute part of this heating. But wait, no, the total system is two exchangers in series, so the overall heat transfer should be 2733 W. Or wait, each exchanger is contributing to this, but it's a series connection, so the overall heat transfer is what we need.

Wait, no, each exchanger is part of the system. So maybe the total Q is 2733 W, but each exchanger handles part of that. Hmm, but since they're in series, the air goes through one, then the next. So perhaps the heat is split between them, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, each exchanger can be considered individually, connected in series, so the overall effectiveness is the product of their individual effectiveness. Wait, but the question is about each exchanger's effectiveness and UA, so perhaps each exchanger has the same effectiveness and same UA since they are identical in series? Or maybe they are not identical. Hmm, the question doesn't specify if they're identical, so perhaps I should assume they are. Or maybe not. Well, perhaps the problem expects me to treat each exchanger as having the same effectiveness and UA, so let's proceed with that assumption.

Wait, but to find the effectiveness and UA for each exchanger. So each exchanger has its own effectiveness and UA, but perhaps they are the same. Let's think.

In counterflow exchangers, the effectiveness formula is ε = (T_hot_in - T_hot_out)/(T_hot_in - T_cold_in). But wait, no, wait. Wait, for a counterflow heat exchanger, the effectiveness can be calculated using the formula:

ε = (T_cold_out - T_cold_in) / (T_hot_in - T_cold_in)

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The effectiveness is (actual heat transfer)/(max possible heat transfer). The maximum heat transfer would occur if the cold fluid exited at the hot fluid's inlet temperature.

In this case, the hot fluid is water at 35°C. The cold fluid (air) is coming in at 22°C. So the maximum possible temperature rise for the air would be 35 - 22 = 13°C, but the actual rise is 8°C. So the overall effectiveness for the whole system would be 8/13 ≈ 0.615. Hmm, but wait, that would be the effectiveness if it were a single exchanger. But since there are two in series, perhaps their combined effectiveness is 0.615? Or maybe each contributes part of it.

Wait, no. When exchangers are in series, their effectiveness combine in a certain way. For two exchangers in series, each with effectiveness ε1 and ε2, the overall effectiveness ε_total is not simply ε1 + ε2, but it's a bit more involved.

Wait, no, for exchangers in series, the overall effectiveness can be calculated as:

1 - (1 - ε1)(1 - ε2) / (1 - ε1 ε2)

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, maybe the heat exchangers in series have an overall effectiveness that's a product of their individual effectiveness. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can model each exchanger as having the same effectiveness ε, and then the overall effectiveness would be [ (1 + ε) / 2 ] or something like that. Wait, perhaps it's better to model each exchanger's exit temperature and see how the series connection affects the total.

But maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, let's compute the required overall heat transfer Q, which is 2733 W as I calculated earlier. Now, the system uses two heat exchangers in series, so each exchanger contributes to heating the air. Let me denote the first exchanger as E1 and the second as E2.

In E1, the air is heated from 22°C to some intermediate temperature T1, and then in E2, from T1 to 30°C.

The heat transferred in E1 is Q1 = m_dot_air * c_p_air * (T1 - 22)
The heat transferred in E2 is Q2 = m_dot_air * c_p_air * (30 - T1)
The total heat is Q1 + Q2 = 8 * m_dot_air * c_p_air = 2733 W, which matches what I found earlier.

But to find the effectiveness of each exchanger, I need to know the temperatures of the water in each exchanger. Wait, but the problem says that water is at 35°C. I'm assuming that each exchanger uses the same water supply? Or perhaps the water flows through each exchanger, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps each exchanger has its own water flow, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each exchanger as using water at 35°C, and in each, the water is at a higher temperature than the air. So for each exchanger, the hot fluid is water at 35°C, and the cold fluid is air, which enters at 22°C for the first exchanger and at T1 for the second.

Wait, but if the two exchangers are in series, the air flows first through E1, then E2. So the outlet temp of E1 is the inlet to E2. So for E1: T_cold_in =22, T_cold_out = T1; for E2: T_cold_in = T1, T_cold_out=30.

Since both exchangers are counterflow, the effectiveness for each can be determined based on their own temperature differences.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the overall effectiveness first. The overall system has an effectiveness of (30-22)/(35-22) = 8/13 ≈ 0.615. But since there are two exchangers in series, each perhaps contributes to this. So maybe each exchanger has an effectiveness ε, and the overall effectiveness is a function of ε for two in series.

I think for two identical exchangers in series, the overall effectiveness ε_total is given by:

ε_total = 2ε / (1 + ε)

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. For two exchangers in series, each with effectiveness ε, the overall effectiveness is:

ε_total = 1 - (1 - ε)^2 / (1 + ε*(1 - (1 - ε))) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ε_total = 1 - (1 - ε1)(1 - ε2) / (1 - ε1 ε2)

Wait, that might be for parallel exchangers. Hmm.

Alternatively, for series exchangers, perhaps the effectiveness is additive in some way, but I think that's not correct. Maybe it's better to model each exchanger's effectiveness and their temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps each exchanger has the same UA value, so let's denote UA as U*A for each exchanger.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the ε-NTU method. Because that's the standard approach for heat exchangers.

The effectiveness ε for a counterflow exchanger is given by:

ε = (1 - e^(-NTU)) / (1 + e^(-NTU)) * (T_hot_in - T_cold_in) / (T_hot_in - T_cold_out)

Wait, no, the formula for counterflow is:

ε = (T_cold_out - T_cold_in) / (T_hot_in - T_cold_in)

But that's the same as the general effectiveness formula. The NTU method relates ε with NTU, which is UA/(m c_p), but since m and c_p are for the same fluid, perhaps.

Wait, but for each exchanger, we can write the effectiveness in terms of NTU.

The formula for a counterflow exchanger's effectiveness is:

ε = (e^{NTU} - 1) / (e^{NTU} + 1)

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall: For a counterflow exchanger, the effectiveness is:

ε = (1 - e^{-NTU}) / (1 + e^{-NTU})

Wait, no, that's for a specific case. Alternatively, the formula is:

ε = (T_cold_out - T_cold_in) / (T_hot_in - T_cold_in) = (1 - e^{-NTU}) / (1 + e^{-NTU})

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check the correct formula. Oh right, for a counterflow heat exchanger, the effectiveness is given by:

ε = (e^{NTU} - 1)/(e^{NTU} + 1) * (T_hot_in - T_cold_in)/(T_hot_out - T_cold_out)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express it as:

ε = (T_cold_out - T_cold_in) / (T_hot_in - T_cold_in) = [1 - e^{-NTU (1)}] / [1 + e^{-NTU (1)}]

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, for a counterflow exchanger, the effectiveness is:

ε = (1 - e^{-NTU}) / (1 + e^{-NTU})

Wait, I think that's correct. So if each exchanger has the same NTU, then the overall effectiveness can be calculated based on two exchangers in series.

Alternatively, perhaps each exchanger has the same NTU, so the overall effectiveness would be higher than a single exchanger's.

But in this problem, the overall system's effectiveness is 0.615, as I calculated earlier. So if each exchanger has ε1 and ε2, but assuming they're the same, ε1=ε2=ε.

Then the overall effectiveness is given by:

ε_total = 1 - (1 - ε)^2 / (1 + ε (1 - (1 - ε)))

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct approach. Alternatively, let's model the two exchangers in series.

Let me think: The first exchanger raises the air from 22°C to T1. The second raises it from T1 to 30°C.

Each exchanger has effectiveness ε and UA = U*A.

For the first exchanger, E1:

ε1 = (T1 - 22)/(35 - 22) = (T1 - 22)/13

Similarly, the heat transferred in E1 is Q1 = m_dot_air * c_p_air * (T1 - 22)

For the second exchanger, E2:

ε2 = (30 - T1)/(35 - T1) 

And Q2 = m_dot_air * c_p_air * (30 - T1)

The total heat is Q1 + Q2 = 8 * m_dot_air * c_p_air = 2733 W

But since both exchangers are connected in series, perhaps their effectiveness and UA values are the same, so ε1 = ε2 = ε, and UA1 = UA2 = UA.

So for E1:

ε = (T1 - 22)/13 → T1 = 22 + 13ε

For E2:

ε = (30 - T1)/(35 - T1)

Substituting T1 from E1 into E2's equation:

ε = (30 - (22 +13ε)) / (35 - (22 +13ε)) 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 30 -22 -13ε = 8 -13ε

Denominator: 35 -22 -13ε = 13 -13ε =13(1 - ε)

So ε = (8 -13ε) / [13(1 - ε)]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

ε *13*(1 - ε) = 8 -13ε

Expand left side:

13ε (1 - ε) = 13ε -13ε²

So,

13ε -13ε² = 8 -13ε

Bring all terms to one side:

13ε -13ε² -8 +13ε =0 → 26ε -13ε² -8 =0

Rearranged:

-13ε² +26ε -8 =0 → multiply both sides by -1:

13ε² -26ε +8 =0

Quadratic equation: 13ε² -26ε +8=0

Using quadratic formula: ε = [26 ± sqrt(676 - 4*13*8)] / (2*13)

Calculate discriminant: 676 - 416 =260

So sqrt(260) ≈ 16.1245

Thus,

ε = [26 ±16.1245]/(26) → because denominator is 26.

Compute the two possibilities:

First option: (26 +16.1245)/26 ≈42.1245/26≈1.620 → which is greater than 1, impossible for effectiveness.

Second option: (26 -16.1245)/26 ≈9.8755/26≈0.379.

So ε≈0.379.

Hmm, approximately 0.379.

Now, looking at the options, option E has effectiveness 0.375, which is close. Let's check if this is the case.

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute UA for each exchanger as well.

So for each exchanger, NTU = UA / (m c_p). But which fluid? Because the effectiveness formula depends on the fluid with the lowest heat capacity rate.

Wait, in a counterflow exchanger, the effectiveness is given based on the fluid with the smaller heat capacity rate. But in this case, the air is the fluid being heated, and water is the other fluid.

Wait, but for each exchanger, the effectiveness is calculated as (T_cold_out - T_cold_in)/(T_hot_in - T_cold_in). So for both exchangers, the hot fluid is water at 35°C.

So for each exchanger, the effectiveness ε is (T1 - 22)/13 for E1, and (30 - T1)/(35 - T1) for E2.

Wait, but earlier I found that ε is approximately 0.379. So then, each exchanger's ε is 0.379, so perhaps option E, which is 0.375. Close enough.

Now, let's compute UA for each exchanger.

NTU for each exchanger is given by:

ε = (1 - e^{-NTU}) / (1 + e^{-NTU})

We can solve for NTU.

Rearranging:

ε (1 + e^{-NTU}) ) = 1 - e^{-NTU}

ε + ε e^{-NTU} =1 - e^{-NTU}

Bring terms with e^{-NTU} to one side:

ε e^{-NTU} + e^{-NTU} =1 - ε

e^{-NTU} (ε +1) )=1 - ε

So,

e^{-NTU} = (1 - ε)/(1 + ε)

Take natural logarithm:

-NTU = ln( (1 - ε)/(1 + ε) )

So,

NTU = - ln( (1-ε)/(1+ε) ) = ln( (1+ε)/(1-ε) )

So for ε=0.375,

NTU = ln( (1+0.375)/(1-0.375) ) = ln(1.375 / 0.625 ) = ln(2.2) ≈0.7885.

Now, NTU = UA/(m c_p). So we can compute UA for each exchanger.

We have m_dot_air = 0.33984 kg/s, c_p_air=1005 J/kg·K.

UA = NTU * m_dot_air * c_p_air.

So,

UA = 0.7885 * 0.33984 kg/s * 1005 J/kg·K.

Calculating that:

0.7885 *0.33984 ≈0.2678.

0.2678 *1005 ≈269.3 W/°C.

Looking at the options, option E is effectiveness 0.375 and UA=150 W/°C. That's lower than 269. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each exchanger is handling the same amount of heat. Alternatively, perhaps the overall effectiveness is different.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that each exchanger's effectiveness is the same because they're identical and in series. But maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: The total Q is 2733 W. Each exchanger contributes part of it. Let me think about the first exchanger, E1, which raises the air temp from 22 to T1, and E2 raises it from T1 to 30.

Each exchanger's effectiveness is based on their own temperature difference.

But perhaps I should calculate each exchanger's ε and UA separately.

Wait, but without knowing T1, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I should set up equations for both exchangers and solve for T1 and ε.

Wait, let's write the ε equations for both exchangers.

For E1:

ε1 = (T1 -22)/(35 -22) = (T1 -22
