Okay, so I have this problem about a synchronous generator, and I need to find the unsaturated self-inductance of the field winding. Hmm. Let me see. I remember that self-inductance has to do with the magnetic flux linkage in the coils when current flows through them. Since it's the field winding, that's the rotor's winding.

The question gives me a bunch of parameters, so I need to figure out which ones are relevant. The key here is to calculate the self-inductance based on the fundamental component of the air-gap flux. Right, so I think the formula for self-inductance (L) is something like L = (μ₀ * N² * A * g_e) / (l * a), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's L = (μ₀ * μ_r * N² * A * g_e) / (l * a), but I don't think relative permeability μ_r is given here. Oh wait, since it's unsaturated, maybe μ_r is taken as 1 or maybe it's already included in some other factor. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the self-inductance of the field winding can be calculated using the formula L = (μ₀ * N_f² * l * π D) / (p * q * a), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I've heard about the concept of self-inductance being related to the number of turns, the permeance, and the average length around the magnetic path.

Wait, let's start from the basics. The self-inductance of a coil is given by L = N² * (μ₀ μ_r A) / l, where A is the cross-sectional area, l is the mean length, and N is the number of turns. But wait, in a machine, the effective area might relate to the air-gap and the length of the core.

Wait, another approach. I think the self-inductance of the field winding can be found using the formula:

L_f = (μ₀ * π * D * N_f² * l * K_p) / (2 * p * a)

Where:
- D is the diameter of the rotor,
- l is the axial length (net axial length of stator iron? Or maybe rotor? Hmm, the given net axial length is for the stator iron, but maybe it's similar for the rotor),
- N_f is the number of turns per rotor coil multiplied by the number of rotor coils,
- p is the number of poles,
- a is the number of parallel paths in the rotor winding,
- K_p is the pitching factor, which is given by cos(π * stator slot pitch / 2).

Wait, no, wait. The field winding is on the rotor. So the number of turns in each rotor coil is 15, and there are 14 rotor coils. So the total number of turns N_f would be 15 * 14 = 210? Or wait, each coil is connected in series, so maybe it's 15 turns per coil times the number of coils. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem states: "series rotor-coil connection." So each rotor coil has 15 turns, and there are 14 rotor coils. So the total number of turns for the field winding is 15 * 14 = 210. Wait, but sometimes the number of turns is given as per phase or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the number of turns per phase is what's important. Wait, but for the field winding, it's a single circuit, I think, since it's a DC excitation. So all the rotor coils are connected in series. So total N_f = 15 * 14 = 210.

Wait, but sometimes the way the coils are connected affects the effective number of turns. Wait, no, in a series connection, each additional coil adds its turns. So 14 coils each with 15 turns would give 14*15=210 turns total.

But wait, the problem says "series rotor-coil connection", which I think means each coil is connected in series, so the total is 14*15 = 210.

Now, the diameter D. The problem gives the O.D. of the rotor iron as 0.865 m. So the diameter D_rotor = 0.865 m.

The net axial length of the stator iron is given as 3.365 m. Since the rotor is inside the stator, I think the axial length of the rotor would be similar, maybe a bit less, but perhaps we can use the stator's axial length as the effective length for the field winding. So l = 3.365 m.

Number of poles, P, is given as 2? Wait, no, P is given as 2, but that's for the generator. Wait, the number of poles is related to the frequency and speed. But for the formula, I think p is the number of pole pairs. Oh wait, in the standard formula, p is the number of poles, but sometimes it's expressed as pairs. Wait, wait, the data says P=2, which is the number of poles. So p=1, because it's a two-pole machine. Because the number of pole pairs is p = P/2. So for P=2, p=1.

Wait, but wait, in the formula for self-inductance, do I use the number of poles or the number of pole pairs? Hmm. Let me think. The self-inductance of the field winding is influenced by the number of poles because it affects the distribution of the magnetic field. So perhaps p is the number of pole pairs. So if the generator is two-pole (P=2), then p=1. So p=1.

The number of parallel paths a. The problem says it's a series rotor-coil connection. Wait, the question says "series rotor-coil connection." So the number of parallel paths a is 1. Because in series, each coil is connected end-to-end, so all coils are in one path. So a=1.

The stator coil connection is two-circuit (a=2), but that's for the stator, not the rotor. So for the field winding (rotor), a=1.

What else do I need? The permeance factor g_e is given as 1.08. I think g_e is the ratio of the effective air-gap length to the actual air-gap length. Wait, but perhaps it's used in the formula for inductance.

Wait, another thought: The formula for the self-inductance of the field winding can be expressed as:

L_f = (μ₀ * N_f² * l * D * K_p) / (2 * p * g * a)

Where g is the air-gap length. Wait, but I don't have the air-gap length. Hmm, perhaps I can compute it from the stator and rotor dimensions.

Wait, the stator has an I.D. (internal diameter) of 0.948 m, and the rotor has an O.D. of 0.865 m. Wait, that can't be right. The stator's inner diameter must be larger than the rotor's outer diameter. Because the rotor is inside the stator. So wait, perhaps the stator's internal diameter is 0.948 m, and the rotor's external diameter is 0.865 m. So the air gap would be (0.948 - 0.865)/2 = (0.083)/2 = 0.0415 m? Wait, wait, no. The air gap is the difference between the stator's inner radius and the rotor's outer radius. So the stator's I.D. is 0.948 m, so radius is 0.474 m. The rotor's O.D. is 0.865 m, so radius is 0.4325 m. So the air gap is 0.474 - 0.4325 = 0.0415 m. So g = 0.0415 m.

Wait, but wait, the units here are in meters, which is a bit big for an air gap. Typically, air gaps in machines are a few millimeters. So 0.0415 m is 4.15 cm, which seems way too large. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, the stator I.D. is 0.948 m, so radius 0.474 m.

Rotor O.D. is 0.865 m, radius 0.4325 m.

So the difference in radii is 0.474 - 0.4325 = 0.0415 m, which is 4.15 cm. That's a very large air gap. Maybe there's a mistake. Let me double-check the problem statement. Oh wait, the problem gives "I.D. of stator iron = 0.948 m" and "O.D. of rotor iron = 0.865 m." Wait, that would mean the stator is larger than the rotor. So the air gap is (0.948/2 - 0.865/2) = (0.474 - 0.4325) = 0.0415 m. Hmm, but that's 4.15 cm, which is huge. Maybe the values are in millimeters? No, the problem states them in meters. Hmm, this might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the parameters.

Wait, perhaps the stator I.D. is the inner diameter, and rotor O.D. is the outer diameter. So the air gap is (stator I.D. - rotor O.D.) / 2? No, wait, the air gap g is the radial distance between the stator's inner surface and the rotor's outer surface. So g = (stator I.D. - rotor O.D.) / 2. Wait, no, because if stator I.D. is larger than rotor O.D., then the difference is stator I.D. - rotor O.D., and that's the diameter difference. So the radius difference is (stator_I.D/2 - rotor_O.D/2) = (0.948/2 - 0.865/2) = same as (0.948 - 0.865)/2 = 0.083 / 2 = 0.0415 m, which is the same as before. So g = 0.0415 m.

Wait, but for a 60 Hz machine, that's a huge air gap. Normally, air gaps are a few millimeters, like 1 mm or so. So perhaps the problem uses the unit incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the parameters. Wait, perhaps the given O.D. of rotor iron is the outer diameter, which for a rotor is the same as the inner diameter of the stator's iron. So perhaps the air gap is very small. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, maybe the formula I'm using doesn't require the actual air gap length but uses the permeance factor g_e. Oh wait, the problem says to assume g_e = 1.08, so perhaps that's the effective permeance factor.

Wait, another formula: The self-inductance of the field winding can be given by L = (μ₀ * N_f² * l * D * K_p * K_w) / (2 * p * a * g), where K_p is the pole-pitch factor, K_w is the winding factor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula that incorporates permeance.

Alternatively, I think the general formula for inductance is L = (N^2) * (permeance). So permeance is the magnetic analog of conductance, which is the ease with which flux can pass through a material. For the air gap, the permeance is given by (μ₀ * A) / (g * l), where A is the area, g is the air gap length, and l is the mean path length. Wait, perhaps.

Wait, let me think again. The inductance L is given by L = N^2 * (μ * A_eff) / l_eff, where A_eff is the effective area and l_eff is the effective length of the magnetic path. For the field winding, the effective area would be the area of the rotor's teeth or something, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

L = (μ₀ * μ_r * (N_f)^2 * π * D * l) ) / (2 * p * a * g_e)

Wait, considering that the permeance is (μ₀ * A) / (g_e * l), where A is the area through which the flux flows. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the steps I need to take. First, find N_f, the number of turns in the field winding. Then, compute the self-inductance using a formula that includes N_f squared, the permeability, some dimensions, and the number of poles and parallel paths.

Wait, another approach. The self-inductance of the field winding can be calculated using the formula:

L_f = (μ₀ * (N_f)^2 * l * D * π) / (2 * p * a * g_e)

Where:
- μ₀ = 4π x 1e-7 H/m,
- N_f is the number of turns,
- l is the axial length,
- D is the diameter of the rotor,
- p is the number of pole pairs,
- a is the number of parallel paths,
- g_e is the permeance factor (given as 1.08).

Wait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Let me try plugging in the numbers and see.

Given:
- N_f = 14 coils * 15 turns/coil = 210 turns.
- l = 3.365 m (net axial length of stator iron, assume same for rotor).
- D = 0.865 m (rotor O.D.).
- p = 2 poles → p = 1 pair.
- a = 1 (series connection, so one parallel path).
- g_e = 1.08.

So plugging into the formula:

L_f = (4πe-7) * (210)^2 * 3.365 * 0.865 * π / (2 * 1 * 1 * 1.08)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate numerator:

4πe-7 * (210)^2 * 3.365 * 0.865 * π.

Compute (210)^2 = 44100.

Multiply 4πe-7 * 44100 = 4 * π * 44100 * 1e-7.

4 * π ≈ 12.566.

12.566 * 44100 ≈ 12.566 * 4.41e4 = let's compute 12.566 * 4e4 = 5.0264e5, and 12.566 * 1e4=1.2566e5 → total ≈ 6.282e5.

Multiply by 1e-7: 6.282e5 * 1e-7 = 6.282e-2 ≈ 0.06282.

Now multiply by 3.365: 0.06282 * 3.365 ≈ 0.2112.

Multiply by 0.865: 0.2112 * 0.865 ≈ 0.1826.

Multiply by π: 0.1826 * π ≈ 0.5735.

So numerator is approximately 0.5735.

Denominator: 2 * 1.08 = 2.16.

So L_f ≈ 0.5735 / 2.16 ≈ 0.2656 H.

Wait, that's about 0.2656 H, but that's not among the options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the average diameter or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should use the stator's internal diameter for D, because the field winding's flux passes through the stator. Hmm, perhaps I should use the stator's I.D. as the D in the formula. Let me recalculate with D = 0.948 m.

So, D = 0.948 m.

Redoing the numerator:

4πe-7 * (210)^2 * 3.365 * 0.948 * π.

Compute (210)^2 = 44100, same as before.

4πe-7 * 44100 ≈ 0.06282 as before.

0.06282 * 3.365 ≈ 0.2112.

0.2112 * 0.948 ≈ 0.2003.

0.2003 * π ≈ 0.6299.

Denominator: 2.16.

So L_f ≈ 0.6299 / 2.16 ≈ 0.2915 H.

Still, that's about 0.29 H, which isn't among the options. The options are from 1.06 H to 2.06 H. So I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let's think again. Perhaps the formula should include the number of phases. Wait, the field winding is DC, so it's a single-phase winding, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses the number of conductors or something else.

Wait, another thought: The field winding inductance can be calculated as L_f = (μ₀ * N_f^2 * l * π D) / (6 * g_e * p * a). Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

L_f = (μ₀ * (N_f / a)^2 * l * π D) / (2 * p * g_e)

Wait, since a is the number of parallel paths, the effective number of turns per path would be N_f / a. So if a=1, it's N_f.

Let me try that formula.

So, L_f = (μ₀ * (N_f / a)^2 * l * π D) / (2 * p * g_e)

Given:

μ₀ =4πe-7,
N_f=210,
a=1,
l=3.365,
D=0.948 (stator I.D.),
p=1,
g_e=1.08.

So,

Numerator: (210)^2 =44100,
μ₀=4πe-7,
l=3.365,
π D=π *0.948 ≈ 2.978.

Denominator: 2 * 1 * 1.08 = 2.16.

Putting it all together:

L_f = (4πe-7 * 44100 * 3.365 * 2.978) / (2.16)

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, compute 4πe-7 * 44100:

4πe-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6,
1.2566e-6 * 4.41e4 ≈ 5.54e-2.

Now multiply by 3.365:
