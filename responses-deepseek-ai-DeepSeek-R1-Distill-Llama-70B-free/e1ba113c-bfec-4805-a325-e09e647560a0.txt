Question:

A rancher, being owner in fee simpleconveyed the property by warranty deed to a woman. The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.
B: not succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not reference the mortgage.
C: succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.
D: not succeed, because the farmer was not a party to the original mortgage contract.
E: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.
F: not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.
G: succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.
H: not succeed, because the woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt.
I: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
J: succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mortgages and property conveyance. I'm a bit rusty on property law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup is: A rancher owns a property in fee simple. He conveys it via warranty deed to a woman. Then, the woman gets a mortgage from her niece for $500k, and the mortgage is recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveys the ranch to a farmer using a quitclaim deed, which doesn't mention the mortgage. Then she defaults on the mortgage, and the niece sues the farmer in personam to get the mortgage money. The question is whether the niece will succeed.

Hmm. So the key here is understanding the implications of a quitclaim deed and whether the farmer becomes responsible for the mortgage debt.

First, I remember that a warranty deed typically contains covenants, including that the property is free of encumbrances. But the rancher conveyed to the woman, so that's probably not directly relevant here. The woman then gives a mortgage to her niece. Mortgages are liens on the property. Since the mortgage was recorded immediately, it's a matter of public record.

Now, when the woman later conveys the property to the farmer via quitclaim deed, which makes no reference to the mortgage. I think a quitclaim deed only conveys whatever interest the grantor has, without any warranties. So if the woman still had the mortgage lien on the property, then the farmer would take the property subject to that mortgage, right? Because the mortgage is a lien that runs with the land.

Wait, but the question is about the niece bringing an in personam action against the farmer. In personam means it's a personal action against the person, not an in rem action against the property. So the niece is trying to hold the farmer personally liable for the mortgage debt.

But the farmer wasn't a party to the original mortgage. The mortgage was between the woman and the niece. So unless the farmer explicitly assumed the mortgage, he wouldn't be personally liable. In some states, when you take property subject to a mortgage, you don't automatically assume the debt unless you agree to it. So the farmer, taking via quitclaim, probably just took the property with the mortgage lien, but isn't personally liable unless he agreed to assume it.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Succeed because the mortgage was recorded. But recording affects priority and notice, not personal liability. So even if the farmer had notice, without assuming the debt, he's not personally liable. So A might not be the right answer.

Option B: Not succeed because the quitclaim didn't reference the mortgage. But the mortgage is a lien regardless. The deed not referencing it doesn't change that. So B might not be correct either.

Option C: Succeed because implied delegation. I don't think an implied delegation happens just because you convey the property. The delegate would need some sort of agreement, like assuming the mortgage.

Option D: Not succeed because farmer wasn't a party. That makes sense because in personam liability usually requires being a party or assuming the debt.

Option E: Succeed because quitclaim doesn't absolve of mortgage debt. Wait, the quitclaim deed doesn't affect the lien, but the farmer's personal liability? I don't think so. The debt was the woman's, and unless the farmer took on that debt, he isn't liable.

Option F: Not succeed unless farmer had constructive notice. But even if he had notice, without assuming, he's not liable. So F's condition isn't enough.

Option G: Succeed because third-party beneficiary. I don't see how that applies here. The mortgage agreement was between niece and woman, so the farmer isn't a third-party beneficiary.

Option H: Not succeed because woman is still responsible. That's correct because the original debtor is the woman. So the niece would go after her, but she's probably defaulting. But the question is about the farmer's liability.

Option I: Not succeed because farmer didn't promise. Yes, that aligns with what I was thinking. Without the farmer assuming the debt, he isn't personally liable.

Option J: Succeed because farmer accepted quitclaim. No, just accepting the deed doesn't mean accepting the mortgage debt unless it's explicitly assumed.

So the correct answer seems to be either D or I. Let me think again. The niece is suing the farmer in personam, trying to make him pay the debt. For that, the farmer needs to have some personal obligation. Since he wasn't a party to the mortgage and didn't assume it, he isn't personally liable. So the niece can't recover from him in personam. Therefore, the answer would be that the mortgagee (niece) won't succeed.

Looking back, option D says not succeed because farmer wasn't a party. Option I says not succeed because farmer didn't promise. Both seem correct, but I think D is more accurate because the issue is that there's no privity of contract. The farmer wasn't a party to the mortgage contract, so he can't be held personally liable. The mortgagee's remedy would be against the property, not the person.

Alternatively, option I is about whether the farmer promised to pay, which is the same as assuming the debt. So both D and I could be correct, but I think I might have misapplied something.

Wait, the question is about in personam liability. So the niece is trying to get a personal judgment against the farmer. In most states, when a mortgagor sells the property, the buyer can take subject to the mortgage but isn't personally liable on the debt unless they assume it. So the farmer didn't assume it, so no personal liability.

So the correct answer is either D or I. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ...farmer was not a party to the original mortgage contract.

Option I: ...farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.

Which is the better answer? The key is that the farmer didn't assume the mortgage. So the in personam claim against the farmer would require that he agreed to pay the debt. Since he didn't, he's not liable. So option I is the reason.

But wait, the mortgagee (niece) could have other remedies, like foreclosing on the property, but that's an in rem action, not in personam.

So the answer should be that the niece can't recover in personam because the farmer didn't assume the debt. So the correct option is I.

Wait, but looking back, I think that when property is transferred subject to a mortgage, the new owner (farmer) doesn't become personally liable for the debt unless he assumes it. So the niece can foreclose on the property, but can't get a money judgment against the farmer personally unless he's on the hook, which he isn't.

So the answer is I: not succeed, because the farmer didn't promise to pay.

Wait, but earlier I thought D was a contender. Hmm. Let me think again. The farmer wasn't a party to the original contract, so he can't be held liable on it. So D is correct because there's no privity. But I is about whether he promised, which is another way of saying the same thing.

Wait, in contract law, to be liable on a debt, you need to be a party or an assignee. The farmer isn't either, so D is the reason.

Wait, no. The mortgage is a contract between the woman and the niece. The farmer isn't a party, so he can't be sued on that contract. Therefore, the niece's in personam claim against the farmer fails because he wasn't a party to the mortgage. So the answer is D.

Wait, but what about the doctrine of assumption? If the farmer assumed the mortgage, even if it's not in the deed, he might be liable. But the question says the quitclaim deed didn't reference the mortgage. So no assumption. So D would be correct.

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think of it this way: For the niece to have a personal claim against the farmer, the farmer must have taken on the obligation. That can happen if he explicitly or implicitly assumed the mortgage. But a quitclaim deed without any mention doesn't do that. So the farmer didn't assume, so no personal liability.

So the niece can't sue in personam against the farmer because he didn't agree to pay. So the reason is I.

Wait, but I thought that whether he was a party or not is the key. Because even if he had notice, if he didn't assume, he's not liable. So D and I are both pointing to the same conclusion.

But the options are different. So which one applies here.

In the scenario, the farmer wasn't a party to the mortgage, so under contract law, he can't be held liable. So the answer is D.

Wait, but some might say that when you take land subject to a mortgage, you become personally liable. But I don't think that's the case. Typically, the buyer's obligation is to the seller, not the mortgagee, unless they assume the mortgage.

So the correct answer is I: not succeed because the farmer didn't promise to pay.

Alternatively, D says because he wasn't a party, which is a broader reason.

Wait, perhaps the court would say that the farmer, as a grantee, isn't a party to the mortgage contract, so he can't be sued in personam. So D is correct.

But I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another angle: The woman's warranty deed from the rancher would have included covenants, like against encumbrances. But when she gave a mortgage, she might have breached a covenant, but that's a separate issue between her and the rancher, perhaps.

The main issue is the farmer's liability to the niece. Since the farmer didn't assume the mortgage, he's not personally liable. So the niece can't get an in personam judgment against him.

So the answer is I: because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.

But looking back, the options are:

Option I: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.

Option D: not succeed, because the farmer was not a party to the original mortgage contract.

Which is the more accurate reason?

I think the key here is that the farmer wasn't a party to the mortgage agreement, so he can't be held liable on it. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the mortgage is a contract between the woman and the niece. The farmer, as a third party, can't be forced to pay unless he agrees. So D is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the farmer's taking the property subject to the mortgage makes him responsible, but that's an in rem issue, not in personam. So the niece could foreclose but can't get a personal judgment.

So, the niece is bringing an in personam action, so she needs the farmer to be personally liable. Since he didn't assume the debt, the answer is I.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me try to think of it another way.

In personam liability requires that the defendant is personally obligated. The farmer's obligation would arise only if he assumed the mortgage. Since he didn't, he's not personally liable. So the reason is I.

But in contract terms, only parties or their assigns can be held liable. So D would also make sense.

Wait, but the farmer didn't contract with the niece, so he's not a party. So D is correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look for the correct rule.

When a mortgagor (woman) conveys property to a third party (farmer), the third party takes the property subject to the mortgage lien, but isn't personally liable on the mortgage debt unless the third party explicitly assumes the mortgage. 

So, in this case, the farmer didn't assume the mortgage, so he's not personally liable. Therefore, the niece can't sue him in personam. The reason is that he didn't promise to pay, which is option I.

Wait, but some might argue that the farmer, by taking the deed, implicitly agreed to pay, but I don't think so. Unless the deed says so, or there's a written assumption, he's not liable.

So the correct answer is I: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.

Wait, no, another thought: The mortgagee's in personam action is against the mortgagor (woman). But if the mortgagor conveys the property, the mortgagee can still go after the mortgagor personally because the mortgage debt is her obligation. But in this case, the niece is suing the farmer, not the woman. So the question is, can the niece hold the farmer personally liable?

No, because the farmer didn't assume the debt. So the answer is I.

But I'm getting myself tangled. I think I'll settle on option I as the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the niece, as the mortgagee, can bring an in personam action against the farmer to recover the mortgage debt. The key issue is whether the farmer, who received the property via a quitclaim deed that did not reference the mortgage, can be held personally liable for the mortgage debt.

1. **Understanding the Conveyances and Mortgage**:
   - The rancher conveyed the property to the woman via a warranty deed, which typically includes covenants but is not directly relevant here.
   - The woman then obtained a mortgage from the niece, which was recorded immediately. This created a lien on the property.
   - The woman later conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed, which does not include warranties and only transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time.

2. **Implications of the Quitclaim Deed**:
   - A quitclaim deed does not absolve the grantee (farmer) of the mortgage lien, as the lien "runs with the land." However, the farmer would not automatically assume personal liability for the mortgage debt unless explicitly agreed to.
   - The quitclaim deed in this case did not reference the mortgage, and there is no indication that the farmer assumed the mortgage debt.

3. **In Personam Liability**:
   - An in personam action seeks a personal judgment against the defendant. For the farmer to be personally liable for the mortgage debt, he must have assumed the debt, either explicitly or implicitly.
   - There is no evidence in the scenario that the farmer assumed the mortgage debt. Without such an assumption, the farmer cannot be held personally liable for the debt.

4. **Analysis of the Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Recording the mortgage affects the lien's priority and provides notice but does not establish personal liability for the farmer.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The absence of a reference to the mortgage in the quitclaim deed does not alter the fact that the mortgage is a lien on the property.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no implied delegation of duties simply because the property was conveyed; assumption of the mortgage is required for personal liability.
   - **Option D**: Plausible. The farmer was not a party to the original mortgage contract, and without assumption, he cannot be held personally liable.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. While the quitclaim deed does not absolve the property of the mortgage lien, it does not make the farmer personally liable for the debt.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. Constructive notice of the mortgage does not, by itself, create personal liability for the farmer.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The farmer is not a third-party beneficiary of the mortgage agreement.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. While the woman remains liable for the debt, this does not address the farmer's personal liability.
   - **Option I**: Correct. The farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, and without such a promise, he cannot be held personally liable.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. Accepting the quitclaim deed does not imply acceptance of the mortgage debt unless explicitly agreed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The niece cannot succeed in her in personam action against the farmer because he did not promise to pay the mortgage debt. Personal liability for the debt requires assumption, which did not occur here. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.**
