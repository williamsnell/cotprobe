Okay, so I've got this question about ancient sites with specific earthworks. Let me see what I can remember. The question is asking which site has monumental earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle dating back around 3,500 years. Hmm, that's a specific description.

I remember that some ancient sites are known for their earthworks. Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A is Caral. I think Caral is in Peru, right? It's one of the oldest cities in the Americas. I believe it has some plazas and pyramids, but I'm not sure about the earthworks with ridges. Maybe not exactly what the question is describing.

Option B is Chichen Itza. That's a Mayan site in Mexico. It has the pyramid El Castillo and a ball court, but again, I'm not recalling earthworks with concentric ridges. More stone structures there.

Option C is the Parthenon. That's in Greece, part of ancient Athens. Definitely a stone temple, no earthworks involved. So probably not this one.

Option D is Machu Picchu. It's an Incan site in Peru, known for its stone architecture and mountainous location. Earthworks might be part of the terracing, but I don't think they have concentric ridges in a semicircle. 

Option E is Angkor Wat. That's in Cambodia, a large temple complex. It has moats and walls, but I'm not sure about the semicircular ridges. I think it's more of a square layout with surrounding moats.

Option F is the Great Pyramids of Giza. These are in Egypt, massive stone structures. They don't have earthworks with ridges like that. The pyramids themselves are the main structures.

Option G is the Colosseum. That's in Rome, a big amphitheater for gladiatorial games. Not earthworks either, just a large stone and concrete structure.

Option H is Poverty Point. I've heard of this one before. I think it's in the United States, maybe Louisiana. Poverty Point is known for its large earthworks. From what I remember, it has several concentric ridges that form a semicircle, maybe even a full circle. And the time frame fits tooâ€”around 3,500 years ago would be the late Archaic period in North America. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Option I is Gobekli Tepe. That's in Turkey, known for being one of the earliest examples of monumental architecture. It has large stone pillars in circles, but I don't think it's earthworks with ridges. More like stone structures arranged in circles.

Option J is Stonehenge. That's in England, a famous stone circle. The stones are arranged in a circle, but I don't think there are concentric ridges in a semicircle. Stonehenge is more about the stones themselves and the ditch and bank enclosure around it. Maybe some earthworks, but the specific structure described doesn't quite match.

Putting it all together, the site with concentric ridges in a semicircle around 3,500 years old is most likely Poverty Point. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: Poverty Point. This site in Louisiana is known for its monumental earthworks, including concentric ridges arranged in a semicircle, dating back around 3,500 years to the late Archaic period. 

Answer: H
