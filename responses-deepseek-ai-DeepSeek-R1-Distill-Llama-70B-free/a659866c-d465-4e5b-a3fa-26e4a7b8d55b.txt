Question:

TencerInc. has estimated its revenue function to be r(x) = 3x^2, where x is the number of years the company has been in business and r(x) is the total revenue earned up to year x in millions. The profit function is f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x +1, f(x) is the total profit earned up to year x. What is the cost accrued over a three year period? What is the rate of change of cost of production by the end of the third year?

Options:

A: $25 million, $12 million
B: $23 million, $11 million
C: $27 million, $13 million
D: $19 million, $10 million
E: $24 million, $13 million
F: $21 million, $9 million
G: $26 million, $14 million
H: $20 million, $10 million
I: $22 million, $11 million
J: $22 million, $12 million

Okay, so I've got this problem here about TencerInc.'s revenue and profit functions, and I need to find the cost accrued over three years and the rate of change of the cost by the end of the third year. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that in economics, profit is usually revenue minus cost. Oh right, so Profit = Revenue - Cost. So if I have the revenue function r(x) and the profit function f(x), then the cost function c(x) should be r(x) - f(x). That makes sense.

So given that, I can write c(x) = r(x) - f(x). Let's plug in the given functions. The revenue function is r(x) = 3x², and the profit function is f(x) = 2x² -5x +1. So subtracting f(x) from r(x), I get c(x) = 3x² - (2x² -5x +1). Let me compute that.

3x² minus 2x² is x². Then, subtracting -5x is like adding 5x, so that gives +5x. Then subtracting 1 gives -1. So the cost function is c(x) = x² +5x -1. Okay, got that.

Now, the first part of the question asks for the cost accrued over a three-year period. So I think that means the total cost at the end of year 3. So I should plug x=3 into c(x).

Calculating c(3) = (3)^2 +5*(3) -1. Let's compute that. 3 squared is 9, 5*3 is 15. So 9 +15 is 24, minus 1 is 23. So c(3) is 23 million. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3 squared is definitely 9, 5 times 3 is 15, so 9+15=24, 24-1=23. Yeah, that's correct.

So the total cost after three years is 23 million. Now, the second part is the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year. Rate of change usually refers to the derivative of the cost function, which gives the marginal cost. So I'll need to find c'(x), the derivative of c(x), and then evaluate it at x=3.

The cost function is c(x) = x² +5x -1. The derivative of x² is 2x, the derivative of 5x is 5, and the derivative of a constant (-1) is zero. So c'(x) = 2x +5.

Now, evaluating this at x=3: c'(3) = 2*(3) +5 = 6+5=11. So the rate of change of cost at the end of the third year is 11 million per year. Hmm, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The derivative is 2x+5, so at x=3, 2*3=6 plus 5 is 11. Yep, that's right.

So putting it all together, the cost over three years is 23 million, and the rate of change (marginal cost) at year 3 is 11 million. Now, looking at the options, which one matches these numbers?

Looking at the options:

Option B: $23 million, $11 million. That's exactly what I got. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The question asked for the cost accrued over three years, which is c(3), not the change from year 2 to 3 or anything else. So yes, c(3)=23 is correct. And the rate of change at the end is the derivative at x=3, which is 11. So yes, B is the correct answer.
</think>

To determine the cost accrued over a three-year period and the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year, we start with the relationship between revenue, profit, and cost. The profit function is given as:

\[
f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 1
\]

The revenue function is:

\[
r(x) = 3x^2
\]

Using the relationship \( \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \), we can derive the cost function \( c(x) \) as:

\[
c(x) = r(x) - f(x)
\]

Substituting the given functions:

\[
c(x) = 3x^2 - (2x^2 - 5x + 1)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c(x) = x^2 + 5x - 1
\]

### 1. Cost Accrued Over Three Years
To find the total cost at the end of the third year (\( x = 3 \)):

\[
c(3) = (3)^2 + 5(3) - 1 = 9 + 15 - 1 = 23 \, \text{million}
\]

### 2. Rate of Change of Cost by the End of the Third Year
The rate of change of cost is given by the derivative of the cost function, \( c'(x) \):

\[
c'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 5x - 1) = 2x + 5
\]

Evaluating this at \( x = 3 \):

\[
c'(3) = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \, \text{million per year}
\]

### Final Answer
The cost accrued over three years is $23 million, and the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year is $11 million per year. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: $23 million, $11 million**
