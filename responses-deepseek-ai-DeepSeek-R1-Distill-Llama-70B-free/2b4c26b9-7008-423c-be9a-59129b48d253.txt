Okay, so I've got this question about which state has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels. Hmm, I remember from my law classes that ships and jurisdiction can be a bit tricky. Let me think through this.

The question is asking about ordinary jurisdiction, so I guess it's the usual rule, not exceptions. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I recall that ships are considered to be part of the state where they're registered. So, if a crime happens on a ship, the country whose flag the ship is flying (the flag state) typically has jurisdiction. That makes sense because the flag represents the state's authority.

Looking at the options, option I is "The flag State." That seems right. But wait, are there other possibilities? Like, sometimes the port state might have jurisdiction if the ship is in their waters. Option D is the port state, but I think that's more for when the ship is in port and the crime affects that state's interests.

Option H is the coastal state. I think coastal states have jurisdiction in their territorial waters, but if the ship is on the high seas, then it's the flag state. The question doesn't specify where the vessel is, but generally, the primary jurisdiction is with the flag state unless it's in another state's waters.

Option A says all states enjoy jurisdiction, which doesn't sound right because that would lead to conflicts. The UN (E) and IMO (C) are international organizations and don't have jurisdiction themselves. The International Tribunal (J) handles disputes between states, not criminal cases.

So putting it together, the usual situation is that the flag state (I) has jurisdiction over crimes on its vessels.

The question concerns which State typically exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels. Under international law, ships are generally considered part of the territory of the State where they are registered, known as the flag State. This means the flag State ordinarily has jurisdiction over crimes occurring on its vessels, especially when on the high seas. While other States, such as the port State or coastal State, may have jurisdiction in specific circumstances (e.g., when the vessel is in their territorial waters), the primary jurisdiction lies with the flag State. International organizations like the International Maritime Organization (IMO) or the United Nations (UN) do not directly exercise jurisdiction, nor does the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Therefore, the correct answer is the flag State.
