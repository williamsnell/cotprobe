Okay, so I've got this problem about Mary Rogers and her earnings. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on commissions and such, but I'll take it slow.

Mary is a saleswoman with a sales quota of $900. She has a weekly salary of $80. Plus, she gets a commission of 5% on all her sales. Oh wait, but there's more: she also gets an additional 2 and a half percent on sales that are over her quota. So the question is, what does she earn when her sales total $1,200 in a week?

Alright, let's parse this. Her total sales are $1,200. The quota is $900, so the amount she's over quota is $300. Because 1,200 minus 900 is 300. Got it.

So her earnings come from three parts: the base salary, the regular commission on all sales, and the extra commission on the over-quota amount.

Wait, let me clarify. The commission structure is 5% on all sales. Then, on top of that, she gets an additional 2.5% on the sales over quota. So the 5% is on the entire sales, and then the extra 2.5% is only on the part that's above $900.

So first, calculate her base pay. That's straightforward: $80 per week.

Next, the regular commission. That's 5% of her total sales. Her sales are $1,200. 5% of 1,200 is ... let's see, 0.05 * 1200. 0.05 * 1000 is 50, and 0.05 * 200 is 10, so total $60.

Then, the additional commission. She gets 2.5% on the amount over quota. She exceeded by $300. So 2.5% of 300 is 0.025 * 300. Let's compute that. 0.025 is the same as 2.5 cents on the dollar. So 300 * 0.025. 300 * 0.02 is 6, and 300 * 0.005 is 1.5. So 6 + 1.5 is $7.50.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2.5% is 0.025. So 300 * 0.025. Let me compute it another way. 1% of 300 is 3, so 2% is 6, and 0.5% is 1.5. So 6 +1.5 is 7.5. Yep, that's correct.

So now, adding all the parts together. Base salary is 80. Regular commission is 60. Additional commission is 7.50. So 80 +60 is 140, plus 7.50 makes 147.50.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. The options include J: $147.50. So that's the answer, right?

Alternatively, did I misread the commission structure? Hmm. Let me double-check. The problem says she receives a weekly salary of $80, plus a commission of 5% on all sales and an additional 2.5% on sales over her quota.

So yes, the 5% is on all sales, including the quota part, and then the 2.5% is only on the over-quota. So the way I did it is correct.

Wait another thought: does the additional 2.5% apply only to the over-quota, or is it on top of the 5%? For example, does she get 5% on all, and then another 2.5% on the over, making it 7.5% on the over?

Yes, that's how I applied it. So for the first $900, she gets 5% on all of it. For the $300 over, she gets 5% (as part of the all sales) plus an additional 2.5%, totaling 7.5% on the over. But wait, no: the way the problem is phrased, it's 5% on all sales, and then an additional 2.5% on the over. So for the over, she gets 5% (from the all sales) plus 2.5%, making 7.5% on the over. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the commission is 5% on all sales, regardless of quota. Then, on the amount over quota, she gets an additional 2.5%. So for the over-quota amount, she gets 5% (same as others) plus 2.5%, making 7.5% on that part. But in my calculation above, I only applied the 2.5% on the over. Wait, no, that's correct because the 5% is already included in the regular commission.

Wait no, noâ€” the way I did it was that the regular commission is 5% on all sales, so 5% on 1200, which is 60. Then, the additional is 2.5% on the over-quota (300), which is 7.50. So the total is 60 +7.50 = 67.50 in commissions. Plus base 80. 80 +67.50 = 147.50. So that's correct.

Wait, but what if the additional 2.5% is on top of the 5% only for the over-quota? I think that's what it is. So yes, that's how I calculated it.

So the total earnings are $147.50, which is option J.

Mary Rogers has a base salary of $80 per week. Her commission structure includes 5% on all sales and an additional 2.5% on sales exceeding her quota of $900. For a week where her sales totaled $1,200:

1. **Base Salary**: $80 (fixed amount).
2. **Regular Commission**: 5% of total sales ($1,200).  
   \[
   0.05 \times 1200 = 60
   \]
3. **Additional Commission**: 2.5% on the amount exceeding the quota ($1,200 - $900 = $300).  
   \[
   0.025 \times 300 = 7.50
   \]

Adding these together:  
\[
80 + 60 + 7.50 = 147.50
\]

Thus, Mary's total earnings for the week are $147.50. The correct answer is:

J: $147.50
