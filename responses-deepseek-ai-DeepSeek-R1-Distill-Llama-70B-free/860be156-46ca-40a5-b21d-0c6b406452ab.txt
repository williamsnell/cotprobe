Okay, so I've got this question about preemphasis circuits in FM systems. Hmm, I remember that preemphasis is used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by boosting the higher frequencies before transmission. But wait, the question is about ensuring that the preemphasis doesn't affect the channel bandwidth. So I need to find the right value of k squared that meets this condition.

Alright, let's look at what's given. The transfer function's magnitude squared is |Hp(f)|² = k² f². So that means the preemphasis circuit is emphasizing higher frequencies proportionally to f squared. 

The modulating signal has a spectral density G(f) = G₀ / [1 + (f/f₁)²], and it's given that f₁ is much smaller than f_m. Oh wait, f₁ << f_m. So f₁ is much less than the maximum frequency in the modulating signal, I think. That might simplify some terms because when f is much larger than f₁, the denominator becomes approximately (f/f₁)^2, so G(f) ≈ G₀ (f₁²)/(f²). But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

The goal is to determine k² so that the preemphasis doesn't change the bandwidth. I think that means the overall system's bandwidth remains the same as without preemphasis. Wait, in FM systems, the bandwidth is related to the modulating signal and the preemphasis/deemphasis network. Oh right, preemphasis modifies the frequency response, but to not affect the overall bandwidth, the product of the preemphasis transfer function and the signal's spectral density should be flat or not cause any expansion beyond the original bandwidth.

Wait, but bandwidth is usually determined by the highest frequency component present. So if the preemphasis increases high-frequency components, that could potentially increase the bandwidth. But the requirement here is that it doesn't affect the bandwidth, so perhaps the emphasis shouldn't extend beyond the original bandwidth. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let me think about the modulation. In FM, the bandwidth is determined by the Carson's rule: bandwidth ≈ 2(f_m + f_dev), where f_dev is the frequency deviation. But that's more about the transmission bandwidth, which is twice the sum of the maximum modulating frequency and the frequency deviation. Wait, but the preemphasis is applied before modulation, so perhaps it affects the modulating signal's spectrum.

Wait, but in this context, the problem is about the channel bandwidth, which I think refers to the baseband channel before any modulation. Or maybe it's after modulation, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bandwidth here refers to the occupied bandwidth of the FM signal. But that's usually determined by the Carson's rule, which depends on the modulating signal's bandwidth and the modulation index.

Wait, but the preemphasis would change the modulating signal's spectrum, which in turn affects the FM signal's bandwidth. So to not affect the bandwidth, the preemphasized signal's bandwidth should be the same as the original. But how?

Let me think about the modulating signal. The given G(f) is a Lorentzian-type spectrum with a cutoff around f₁. Since f₁ << f_m, I'm guessing that f_m is the maximum frequency of the modulating signal. Wait, no, f_m is probably the maximum frequency component of the message signal. So f₁ is much smaller than that.

Wait, actually, the condition says f₁ << f_m. So f₁ is much smaller than the maximum frequency of the modulating signal. That suggests that the original signal G(f) has a bandwidth extending up to around f_m, with the spectral density decreasing beyond f₁.

But with the preemphasis, the transfer function squared is k² f². So the overall spectrum after preemphasis would be G(f) * |Hp(f)|² = [G₀ / (1 + (f/f₁)^2)] * (k² f²).

Simplifying that, it becomes (G₀ k² f²) / (1 + (f²/f₁²)). Hmm, let's see. For f much larger than f₁, 1 + (f/f₁)^2 ≈ (f/f₁)^2, so G(f) * |Hp(f)|² ≈ (G₀ k² f²) / (f²/f₁²) ) = G₀ k² f₁². So for high frequencies, the spectral density becomes flat, at a level G₀ k² f₁².

But wait, the original G(f) without preemphasis decreases as 1/f² for f >>f₁. So with preemphasis, it becomes flat beyond f₁. So the spectrum is now flatter beyond f₁, which could extend the bandwidth if the flat part is significant. But the requirement is that the bandwidth doesn't change, so perhaps the flat part shouldn't contribute beyond the original bandwidth.

Wait, but the problem says that the preemphasis shouldn't affect the bandwidth. So perhaps the modified spectrum shouldn't introduce any new frequency components beyond the original f_m. Alternatively, maybe the preemphasis should not cause the signal to have significant energy beyond the original bandwidth, which is determined by f_m. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another approach: the bandwidth of the channel is determined by the highest frequency where the signal has significant power. Without preemphasis, the signal's G(f) drops off as 1/f² beyond f₁. But with preemphasis, the modified spectrum is G(f)*k² f². So for f >>f₁, this becomes G₀ k² f₁². So it's a flat spectrum beyond f₁, which suggests that the power is spread out to higher frequencies, but if f_m is the maximum frequency, then perhaps the preemphasis is only applied within the original bandwidth, so the preemphasized signal's bandwidth remains up to f_m.

Wait, but if the preemphasized signal is flat beyond f₁, then the highest frequency where it's non-zero is still f_m. So the bandwidth doesn't extend beyond f_m, which is the same as before. So perhaps any k² would work as long as it doesn't cause the signal to exceed the channel bandwidth. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the key is to ensure that the preemphasis doesn't cause the signal's energy to spill beyond the channel's allocated bandwidth. So the preemphasized signal's energy should be negligible beyond a certain frequency, which is the channel's bandwidth limit. But what determines the channel bandwidth here? Maybe the channel can only handle up to a certain frequency, say, 2f_m or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the FM system's bandwidth is determined by the baseband signal's bandwidth after preemphasis. So in that case, the preemphasized signal's bandwidth must not exceed the channel's bandwidth. So the modified signal's bandwidth should be the same as the original, which was up to f_m.

Wait, but the problem says that the preemphasis shouldn't affect the bandwidth, so the bandwidth should remain the same. So perhaps the preemphasized signal's spectrum after multiplication with |Hp(f)|² should not have significant components beyond the original bandwidth. But given that |Hp(f)|² is f², which increases with frequency, it would boost high frequencies, but since the original G(f) drops off as 1/f², the product would be flat beyond f₁.

Wait, but if G(f) without preemphasis is significant up to f_m, then with preemphasis, the product would have significant energy up to f_m as well. So the bandwidth doesn't change. Hmm, maybe that's why the preemphasis doesn't affect the bandwidth. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the power in the signal after preemphasis should be the same. But no, the question isn't about power; it's about bandwidth.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasized signal's power spectral density (PSD) must not extend beyond the original maximum frequency f_m. But if f₁ is much smaller than f_m, then the flat part of the PSD after preemphasis extends up to f_m, maintaining the same bandwidth.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the condition mathematically. We need the overall PSD after preemphasis to have a bandwidth not exceeding the original. So the original bandwidth is, perhaps, determined by the point where G(f) drops to a certain level. But with the preemphasis, the PSD becomes G(f) * |Hp(f)|².

Wait, let me compute the modified G(f):

G_modified(f) = [G₀ / (1 + (f/f₁)^2)] * k² f².

Simplify numerator: G₀ k² f² / denominator (1 + (f/f₁)^2) = G₀ k² f² / (1 + (f^2/f₁²)).

We can factor f₁² in the denominator:

= G₀ k² f² f₁² / [f₁² + f²] 

Wait, no, that's not the case. Let me rewrite it correctly.

Wait, 1 + (f/f₁)^2 = (f₁² + f²)/f₁², so denominator is (f₁² + f²)/f₁². So the modified G(f) becomes:

G_modified(f) = [G₀ / ((f₁² + f²)/f₁²)] * k² f² = G₀ k² f² * f₁² / (f₁² + f²).

So G_modified(f) = G₀ k² f₁² f² / (f₁² + f²).

Now, let's factor out f₁² in denominator:

= G₀ k² f₁² f² / [f₁² (1 + (f/f₁)^2)] = G₀ k² f² / [1 + (f/f₁)^2] * f₁² / f₁²? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake there. Let me recast it.

Wait, G_modified(f) = [G₀ k² f² ] / [ (1 + (f/f₁)^2) ].

But let me see for f much larger than f₁, say f >> f₁. Then 1 + (f/f₁)^2 ≈ (f/f₁)^2, so denominator ≈ f²/f₁².

So G_modified(f) ≈ [G₀ k² f² ] / (f²/f₁²) ) = G₀ k² f₁².

So for high frequencies, the modified PSD approaches G₀ k² f₁², a constant.

But what determines the bandwidth? The highest frequency where the PSD is significant. Without preemphasis, the original G(f) drops as 1/f² beyond f₁, so the bandwidth is up to f_m. With preemphasis, the PSD becomes flat beyond f₁, but if f_m is much larger than f₁, the PSD remains flat up to f_m, thus the bandwidth is still up to f_m. So the bandwidth doesn't change because the modified PSD is flat up to the same f_m.

Wait, but that seems to suggest that the preemphasis doesn't affect the bandwidth, regardless of k². But the question is asking for a suitable value of k² such that the bandwidth isn't affected. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the energy in the preemphasized signal beyond a certain point doesn't contribute to the bandwidth. Or maybe the condition is that the preemphasized signal's bandwidth equals the original, so the maximum frequency where the signal is non-zero remains the same.

Wait, another approach: the channel's bandwidth is determined by the highest frequency component of the signal. Without preemphasis, the highest frequency is f_m. With preemphasis, perhaps the highest frequency is still f_m, so the bandwidth remains the same. Thus, any k² would satisfy the condition, but that can't be because the options involve specific expressions for k².

Wait, maybe the preemphasis affects the necessary bandwidth during transmission, such as in FM where the bandwidth depends on the modulating signal's spectrum. If the preemphasized signal's spectrum extends beyond f_m, it would require a larger bandwidth. So to prevent that, the preemphasized signal must not have significant energy beyond f_m.

But since the original G(f) is already limited to f_m, and the preemphasized G_modified(f) is G₀ k² f² / (1 + (f/f₁)^2), perhaps the condition is that at f = f_m, the PSD doesn't exceed a certain level, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral of the PSD must remain within the same bandwidth. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that the preemphasis should not cause the signal to have components beyond the channel's bandwidth. So the maximum frequency after preemphasis must still be within the channel's allocated bandwidth. But given that f₁ << f_m, and the modified PSD is flat beyond f₁, but the original signal was up to f_m, perhaps the condition is that the flat region's level (G₀ k² f₁²) must not cause the signal to spill beyond f_m. But I'm not sure how to translate that into a condition on k².

Wait, maybe the condition is that the energy beyond a certain cutoff is negligible, so the preemphasized signal's energy beyond f_m is zero or negligible. But since the original G(f) is zero beyond f_m, the modified G(f) would also be zero beyond f_m. So the bandwidth remains f_m regardless of k². But then why is the question asking for a condition on k²?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem refers to the FM signal's bandwidth after preemphasis. In FM, the bandwidth is determined by the maximum frequency deviation and the modulating signal's bandwidth. Carson's rule states that the FM signal's bandwidth is approximately 2 times (f_m + Δf), where Δf is the frequency deviation.

But the preemphasis affects the modulating signal's spectrum, thus affecting the required bandwidth. So to ensure that the preemphasis doesn't increase the bandwidth, the preemphasized signal's spectrum shouldn't require a larger Δf or extend beyond the original f_m.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the condition is that the product of the preemphasis transfer function and the original signal's spectrum should be such that the resulting spectrum doesn't extend beyond the original bandwidth. So perhaps the modified spectrum must have zero or negligible components beyond f_m.

But given that G(f) is zero beyond f_m, the product would also be zero beyond f_m, regardless of k². So again, I'm confused about why k² needs to be constrained.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the mathematical expression for the modified spectrum.

G_modified(f) = G₀ k² f² / (1 + (f/f₁)^2).

We can rewrite this as G_modified(f) = G₀ k² f₁² * (f²/f₁²) / (1 + (f²/f₁²)) = G₀ k² f₁² * ( (f/f₁)^2 ) / (1 + (f/f₁)^2 )

Let me define x = f/f₁, so f = x f₁.

Then G_modified(f) = G₀ k² f₁² * (x²) / (1 + x²).

So G_modified(f) = G₀ k² f₁² * x²/(1 + x²).

Now, the maximum value of x is when f = f_m, since beyond that, G(f) is zero. So x_max = f_m / f₁.

Given that f₁ << f_m, x_max is a large number.

Now, the problem is that the preemphasis shouldn't affect the bandwidth, which I think means that the modified signal's bandwidth remains the same as the original, which is up to f_m. So we need to ensure that at f = f_m, the modified PSD doesn't cause any issues.

Wait, but the original G(f) has a value at f_m of G(f_m) = G₀ / (1 + (f_m/f₁)^2 ). Since f_m >> f₁, this is approximately G₀ f₁² / f_m².

The modified G(f_m) is G₀ k² f₁² ( (f_m/f₁)^2 ) / (1 + (f_m/f₁)^2 ) = G₀ k² f₁² (f_m²/f₁²) / (1 + f_m²/f₁² )

Simplify: G₀ k² f₁² * (f_m²/f₁²) / ( (f₁² + f_m²)/f₁² ) )

= G₀ k² f₁² * (f_m²/f₁²) * (f₁²/(f₁² + f_m²)) )

= G₀ k² f₁² * f_m²/(f₁² + f_m² )

But since f_m >> f₁, f₁² + f_m² ≈ f_m², so G_modified(f_m) ≈ G₀ k² f₁² * f_m² / f_m² = G₀ k² f₁².

Wait, but that's the same as the high-frequency limit of G_modified(f), which is G₀ k² f₁². So at f = f_m, the PSD is G₀ k² f₁².

But the original PSD at f_m is G(f_m) ≈ G₀ f₁² / f_m².

So the modified PSD at f_m is higher than the original by a factor of k² (f_m²). Because G_modified(f_m) = G₀ k² f₁² and G(f_m) ≈ G₀ f₁² / f_m². So the ratio is G_modified/G = k² f_m².

So to prevent the modified PSD from being too high at f_m, perhaps we need to set k² such that the modified PSD doesn't exceed some limit. But I'm not sure what that limit would be in this context.

Wait, but the question is about the bandwidth not being affected. So perhaps the condition is that the modified PSD at f = f_m is the same as the original PSD at f = f_m. That way, the PSD doesn't rise beyond what it was, preventing any extension of the bandwidth.

Wait, let's set G_modified(f_m) = G(f_m).

So G_modified(f_m) = G₀ k² f₁² = G(f_m) = G₀ f₁² / f_m².

Solving for k²:

k² f₁² = f₁² / f_m² → k² = 1 / f_m².

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly match 1/f_m². So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the area under the modified PSD up to f_m remains the same as the original. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the channel bandwidth is determined by the maximum frequency where the signal is transmitted without significant attenuation. So if the preemphasized signal's spectrum extends beyond f_m, the channel would need to have a larger bandwidth. To prevent that, perhaps the modified spectrum must be zero beyond f_m, which it already is, since the original G(f
