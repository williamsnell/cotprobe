Okay, so I've got this economics question here about reserve ratios and bank lending. Hmm, I remember that the reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold in reserves and can't lend out. The question says the reserve ratio is 0.1, which means the bank has to keep 10% of its deposits as reserves.

The bank gets $200 in deposits. Wait, so the reserve requirement would be 10% of that, which is $20. So the bank must keep $20 in reserve. That means the rest can be lent out. So $200 minus $20 is $180. So the maximum they can lend is $180.

Looking at the options, option F is $180. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me think again. Reserve ratio applies to deposits, so yes, 10% of 200 is 20. So they can lend 180. That makes sense. So F is correct.

The reserve ratio is 0.1 (10%), so the bank must keep $20 in reserves from a $200 deposit. The maximum it can lend is $180.

Answer: F
