Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about a perfectly competitive employer and where they decide to hire labor up to. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that this has to do with how firms make decisions in different market structures. But wait, I need to think carefully.

So the question is asking, a perfectly competitive employer hires labor until... and then there are several options involving wage equals something. I think the key here is understanding the concept of marginal revenue product (MRP) and how it relates to the wage rate.

Wait, in a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers. That means they can't influence the market price of their output, right? So for labor, the employer would want to hire workers until the cost of the next worker equals the additional revenue that worker brings in. Oh right! That's where the marginal revenue product comes into play.

So the MRP is the additional revenue a firm gets from hiring one more worker. And in perfect competition, the firm will keep hiring as long as the MRP is greater than or equal to the wage rate. So when MRP equals the wage, that's the equilibrium point where they stop hiring more labor.

Looking at the options, option F says "Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor." That sounds right because the firm hires until the wage (which is the cost) equals the MRP (the benefit). 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about another concept. There's marginal product of labor (MPL), which is the additional output from one more worker. But MRP is MPL multiplied by the price of the product. Since in perfect competition, price is equal to marginal revenue, MRP is just MPL times price. So MRP = MPL * P.

But the question is about when to hire labor, so the decision is based on comparing the wage (marginal cost of labor) to MRP. So the correct condition is wage equals MRP.

Looking back at the options, option F is "Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor." So that must be the correct answer.

I think other options can be ruled out. Option B is wage equals marginal product, but that doesn't account for the price. Since MRP incorporates price, that's the right measure for revenue. Option G is marginal factor cost, which I think is the same as the wage in this context because in perfect competition, the firm takes the wage as given. So Wage = MFC, but that's not the stopping condition. The stopping condition is when MRP equals MFC, which is the wage. So F is correct.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they cannot influence the market price of their output or the wage rate for labor. When deciding how many workers to hire, a perfectly competitive employer will hire labor until the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker (marginal revenue product, MRP) equals the wage rate. This is because MRP represents the benefit of hiring an additional worker, while the wage represents the cost. The equilibrium point for hiring occurs where these two are equal.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option F** correctly states that the employer hires labor until "Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor," which aligns with the economic principle of equating marginal cost (wage) and marginal benefit (MRP) in hiring decisions.
- Other options, such as "Wage = Marginal product of labor" (Option B), do not account for the price of the product, which is essential for calculating MRP. Similarly, "Wage = Marginal factor cost" (Option G) is redundant in this context, as the wage is already the marginal factor cost in perfect competition.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor.**

Answer: F
