Question:

A large man with red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a defendant was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the corrections officer was not present at the scene of the crime.
B: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the case.
C: inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.
D: admissible as a character evidence.
E: admissible as a prior identification.
F: admissible, as it is a part of the arresting officer's routine report.
G: admissible, as it is a part of the chain of evidence in the case.
H: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
I: admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.
J: inadmissible, as it is prejudicial against the defendant.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a robbery case where the defendant is charged with armed robbery. Several eyewitnesses testified that they saw a large redheaded man commit the crime. Now, the defendant shows up at trial with a shaven head, so he's bald. The prosecution is calling a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defense objects, and we need to decide if the trial judge should allow this testimony.

First, I need to understand the issue here. The main point is whether the corrections officer's testimony about the defendant's hair color at the time of incarceration is admissible. The defense is objecting, so the options are about why it should or shouldn't be allowed.

Let me think about the possible reasons for objection. One common issue is relevance. The testimony must be relevant to a matter at issue in the case. Here, the eyewitnesses described a redheaded man, and the defendant now has no hair. So the prosecution probably wants to show that the defendant did have red hair around the time of the crime, which would align with the eyewitness accounts.

Is this testimony relevant? Yes, because it connects the defendant's appearance at the time of the crime to the description given by the witnesses. Relevance is usually determined under Federal Rule of Evidence 402, which says that evidence is admissible if it has "any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence."

So the testimony is relevant because it helps establish that the defendant matched the physical description (red hair) at the time of the robbery. But wait, could there be other objections?

Another possible objection is hearsay, but the corrections officer's testimony is based on personal knowledge. The officer would be testifying about what they observed when the defendant was brought in. So it's not hearsay because it's a statement the officer is making themselves based on their own perception.

What about character evidence? The prosecution isn't trying to show that the defendant is a certain type of person, just that he had red hair. So it's not about his character, so option D is probably not the right reason.

Option E suggests it's admissible as a prior identification. Prior identification usually refers to a witness identifying the defendant in a lineup or before trial, which isn't exactly what's happening here. The corrections officer isn't identifying the defendant as the robber, just describing his appearance.

Option F says it's part of the arresting officer's routine report. But the corrections officer is testifying about their own observation when the defendant was brought in. So it's not about an arrest report per se, but their personal observation.

Option G mentions chain of evidence, which usually relates to the continuity of possession of physical evidence. That doesn't seem to apply here because this is about a personal observation of the defendant's appearance, not a physical object being passed around.

Option H is about hearsay, but as I thought earlier, the officer's testimony is based on personal knowledge, so it's not hearsay.

Option I says it's admissible for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony. The discrepancy here is that the defendant now has no hair, but the witnesses saw a redheaded man. The corrections officer's testimony would explain that he did have red hair at the time of the arrest, which was after the robbery. So this could help the jury understand that the defendant's current appearance doesn't contradict the eyewitness accounts.

Option J claims it's inadmissible because it's prejudicial. While any evidence against the defendant could be prejudicial, under Rule 403, the judge can exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice. However, the testimony here is highly probative because it directly addresses the defendant's appearance at the time of the crime. So the judge likely wouldn't find it overly prejudicial to exclude it.

Looking back at the options, option I seems plausible. It's about clarifying the discrepancy. The prosecution is trying to show that the defendant fit the description at the time, even though he's now shaved. So the corrections officer's testimony helps bridge that gap.

Wait, but another angle: the defendant's appearance at the time of the crime is a fact in issue. The eyewitnesses testified about his red hair, so the prosecution is trying to prove that the defendant had red hair then. The corrections officer's testimony shows that shortly after the crime (when arrested), he had red hair, supporting the eyewitnesses.

So it's not just about clarifying a discrepancy, but also about proving a fact in issue. So maybe option I is correct because it's for the limited purpose of explaining why the defendant now doesn't have hair.

Alternatively, some might think that it's admissible as substantive evidence because it's relevant and not hearsay. So perhaps it's admissible without any limitation, but the options don't include that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option I: admissible for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy.

Option E: prior identification.

I think the correct reasoning is that the testimony is admissible because it's relevant to show the defendant's appearance around the time of the crime, which aligns with the eyewitness descriptions. So it's substantive evidence, not just for a limited purpose. But the options don't have an option that simply says "admissible as relevant evidence."

Wait, looking again, option I is about clarifying the discrepancy, which is a specific purpose. But the testimony is actually substantive evidence about the defendant's appearance. However, the options don't have a choice that directly states that, so perhaps the best fit is option I.

Another angle: The defense might argue that the testimony is prejudicial because it emphasizes the defendant's appearance, but that's not a strong argument. The real issue is whether the testimony is relevant, and I think it is.

So among the options, the correct one would be I: admissible for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.

Wait, but some might argue that the testimony is admissible as substantive evidence, not just for a limited purpose. But looking at the given options, option I is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps option F or G, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe option E: prior identification. No, because prior identification is when a witness identifies the defendant before trial. Here, the corrections officer isn't a witness to the crime, just observing the defendant's hair.

So I think the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a corrections officer's testimony that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head, and the prosecution seeks to use this testimony to connect the defendant's appearance at the time of the crime to the eyewitness descriptions of a large redheaded man. The defense objects, and the task is to determine the correct ruling.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Relevance**: The testimony is relevant because it helps establish that the defendant matched the physical description (red hair) provided by the eyewitnesses at the time of the robbery. This aligns with the eyewitness accounts and is a fact of consequence to the case.

2. **Hearsay**: The corrections officer's testimony is based on personal observation, not hearsay, as it is derived from their own knowledge of the defendant's appearance when he was brought to jail.

3. **Character Evidence**: The testimony does not pertain to the defendant's character but rather his physical appearance, so it is not inadmissible on these grounds.

4. **Prior Identification**: This is not a prior identification, as the corrections officer is not a witness to the crime and is not identifying the defendant as the perpetrator.

5. **Clarifying Discrepancy**: The testimony helps clarify the discrepancy between the defendant's current appearance (shaven head) and the eyewitness descriptions of a redheaded man. This makes the testimony admissible for the limited purpose of addressing this discrepancy.

6. **Prejudice**: While the testimony could be prejudicial, its probative value in connecting the defendant's appearance to the crime outweighs any potential prejudice, making it admissible.

Among the options, the most appropriate is **I: admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony**, as it directly addresses the relevance of the testimony in resolving the inconsistency between the defendant's current appearance and the eyewitness accounts.

Answer: I
