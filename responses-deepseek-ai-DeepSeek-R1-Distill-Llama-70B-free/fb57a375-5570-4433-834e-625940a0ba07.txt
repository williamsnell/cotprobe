Okay, let's see. I've got this chemistry problem here about the rate of a first-order reaction and the effect of a catalyst. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem says the rate increases from 1.5e-2 sec^-1 to 4.6 sec^-1 at 260°C when a catalyst is added. I need to find the decrease in activation enthalpy, H. Oh right, catalysts lower the activation energy, right? Because they provide an alternative pathway.

Wait, I remember the Arrhenius equation: k = A * exp(-Ea/(RT)). But since the catalyst affects the activation energy, the pre-exponential factor A might change too, but the problem says to assume that the entropy (S°) isn't affected. Hmm, how does that tie in?

Oh wait, activation entropy is part of the more detailed Eyring equation. Right, the Eyring equation relates the rate constant to the activation enthalpy (ΔH‡) and activation entropy (ΔS‡). The equation is k = (k_B T / h) * exp(-ΔH‡/(RT)) * exp(ΔS‡/R). 

But since the problem says S° (I think that's ΔS‡ here) isn't affected by the catalyst, that means the entropy term is the same for both the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions. So the change in the rate must be due to the change in activation enthalpy.

So, for the uncatalyzed reaction, k1 = (k_B T / h) * exp(ΔS‡/R) * exp(-ΔH1‡/(RT))
And the catalyzed, k2 = same except with ΔH2‡.

Since the entropy term is the same, when we take the ratio of k2/k1, the entropy part cancels out. Let me write that:

k2/k1 = exp( -ΔH2‡/(RT) + ΔH1‡/(RT) )

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔH1‡ - ΔH2‡)/(RT) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(k2/k1) = (ΔH1‡ - ΔH2‡)/(RT)

Wait, wait. Because when you have a catalyst, the activation enthalpy decreases, so ΔH2‡ is less than ΔH1‡. So the difference (ΔH1‡ - ΔH2‡) is positive, which makes sense because k2 is larger than k1.

So solving for the difference, let's call it ΔH = ΔH1‡ - ΔH2‡. So:

ΔH = RT ln(k2/k1)

Wait, wait, no. Because ln(k2/k1) equals (ΔH1 - ΔH2)/(RT). So rearranging,

ΔH1 - ΔH2 = RT ln(k2/k1)

But the question asks for the decrease in activation enthalpy, which is ΔH1 - ΔH2. So that's the value we need to calculate.

Now, plugging in the numbers.

First, R is the gas constant. Wait, which units? Because the answer options are in kcal/mole. R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K, but to convert to kcal, I need to remember that 1 kcal is about 4184 J.

So R = 8.314 J/mol·K = 8.314 / 4184 ≈ 0.001987 kcal/mol·K.

Wait, let me double-check that conversion. 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 8.314 J/(mol·K) divided by 4184 (J/kcal) equals approximately 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K).

Temperature T is 260°C. Oh wait, need to convert that to Kelvin. So 260 + 273.15 = 533.15 K.

So RT is 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K) * 533.15 K ≈ let's compute that.

0.001987 * 533.15. Let's see, 0.001987 * 500 = 0.9935, and 0.001987 * 33.15 ≈ approximately 0.0658. So total around 1.0593 kcal/mol.

Then, ln(k2/k1): k2 is 4.6 and k1 is 0.015. So 4.6 / 0.015 is approximately 306.6667.

Wait, 4.6 / 0.015. Let me calculate that: 4.6 / 0.015 = (4.6 * 1000)/15 = 4600 /15 ≈ 306.6667.

So ln(306.6667) is about... Let me think. ln(300) is about 5.7038. Because e^5 is about 148, e^6 is about 403. So 5.7 is about 300. Wait, more accurately:

ln(306.6667) = ln(306 + 2/3) ≈ 5.723.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let me recall that ln(300) is about 5.70378. Then 306.6667 is 300*(1 + 6.6667/300) ≈ 300*(1 + 0.022222). So using ln(300*(1+x)) = ln(300) + ln(1+x). Since x is small, ln(1+x) ≈ x.

So x is 0.022222. So ln(306.6667) ≈ 5.70378 + 0.022222 ≈ 5.726.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use a calculator method. Alternatively, I can use that ln(306.6667) ≈ 5.726.

So putting it all together:

ΔH = RT * ln(k2/k1) = 1.0593 kcal/mol * 5.726 ≈ let's compute 1.0593 * 5.726.

1 * 5.726 is 5.726, 0.0593 *5.726 ≈ 0.0593*5=0.2965, 0.0593*0.726≈0.0430. So total ≈ 0.2965 +0.043=0.3395. So total would be 5.726 + 0.3395≈6.0655 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait, let me do it more accurately:

1.0593 * 5.726:

Multiply 1.0593 * 5 =5.2965

1.0593 * 0.726: let's compute 1.0593 *0.7=0.74151, 1.0593*0.026=0.0275438. So total ≈0.74151 +0.0275438≈0.76905.

So 5.2965 + 0.76905≈6.06555.

So approximately 6.0655 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 6.063, which is very close. Option D is 6.563, which is higher. Option C is 6.560, which is also higher. Option I is 6.063, which is close to 6.0655.

Wait, but wait a second—did I miss a negative sign anywhere? Because the equation was ΔH1 - ΔH2 = RT ln(k2/k1). So that's the decrease in activation enthalpy, which is what the question is asking for. So yes, that would be correct.

Wait another thing: when I calculated RT, I used R as 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K). Let me make sure that's correct.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K. To convert J to kcal: 1 J = 1/4184 kcal. So 8.314 J/mol·K * (1 kcal /4184 J) = 8.314 /4184 ≈ 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K). Yes, that's correct.

And T is 533.15 K, correct.

So RT would be 0.001987 * 533.15. Let me recompute that:

0.001987 * 533 = 0.001987 *500 =0.9935; 0.001987 *33= approx 0.0656. So total about 1.0591 kcal/mol.

So RT is approximately 1.0591 kcal/mol.

Multiply by ln(306.6667)=5.726 gives 1.0591 *5.726≈6.06 kcal/mol.

So the closest option is I:6.063. But wait, let me check the calculation for ln(306.6667) again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate ln(4.6/0.015) more accurately.

4.6 / 0.015 = 306.666...

But ln(306.6667) can be calculated as follows: I remember that ln(256)=6.248 (since e^6≈403, which is higher, wait no, 256 is 2^8, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, using a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the natural logarithm of 300 is about 5.7037, as I said earlier.

So 306.6667 is 300 * 1.022222. So ln(1.022222) is approximately 0.0218. So ln(306.6667)=5.7037 + 0.0218≈5.7255.

So 5.7255 multiplied by RT=1.0591 gives:

1.0591 *5.7255.

Let's compute this more accurately.

1.0591 *5 =5.2955

1.0591 *0.7255 = ?

Compute 1.0591 *0.7=0.74137.

1.0591 *0.0255= approx 0.0270 (since 1.0591 *0.02=0.02118, 1.0591 *0.0055=0.005824; sum is 0.02699.)

So 0.74137 + 0.02699 ≈0.76836.

So total is 5.2955 + 0.76836=6.06386.

So about 6.0639 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is I:6.063.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option I is 6.063, option D is 6.563, which is higher. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but I'm also a bit confused because sometimes the formula is written with (1/T) instead of T. No, in the Arrhenius equation, it's Ea/(RT). So the formula I used is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing—am I using the right value for R? Because sometimes in thermochemistry, people use different units.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So when converting to kcal, 8.314 J is 8.314 / 4184 kcal ≈0.001987 kcal. So that's correct.

So yes, the calculation should be about 6.063 kcal/mol. So the answer is I.

To calculate the decrease in activation enthalpy (ΔH) when a catalyst is added, we use the relationship derived from the Eyring equation. Since the activation entropy (ΔS‡) is assumed to remain constant, the change in the rate constant (k) is due to the change in activation enthalpy (ΔH‡). The equation is:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H}{RT}
\]

Where:
- \( k_1 = 1.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{sec}^{-1} \) (uncatalyzed rate constant),
- \( k_2 = 4.6 \, \text{sec}^{-1} \) (catalyzed rate constant),
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} = 0.001987 \, \text{kcal/mol·K} \) (gas constant),
- \( T = 260 + 273.15 = 533.15 \, \text{K} \) (temperature in Kelvin).

### Step 1: Calculate the ratio of rate constants
\[
\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \frac{4.6}{1.5 \times 10^{-2}} = 306.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the natural logarithm of the ratio
\[
\ln(306.6667) \approx 5.726
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( RT \)
\[
RT = 0.001987 \, \text{kcal/mol·K} \times 533.15 \, \text{K} \approx 1.0591 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decrease in activation enthalpy
\[
\Delta H = RT \cdot \ln\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right)
\]
\[
\Delta H = 1.0591 \, \text{kcal/mol} \cdot 5.726 \approx 6.063 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The decrease in activation enthalpy is approximately **6.063 kcal/mol**, which corresponds to option **I**.
