Okay, so I've got this question about American public opinion in 1965 regarding the Vietnam War. The question is asking what percentage of Americans thought sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I remember that the Vietnam War was a pretty controversial conflict, especially as it escalated. I think public opinion shifted over time, but in the early years, support was higher. So the question is specifically about 1965. I think that's when the U.S. started sending ground troops in larger numbers. 

Wait, I recall that initially, a lot of people supported the war, but as time went on and casualties increased, opposition grew. So in 1965, maybe the majority still supported it, but some were against. Or perhaps a significant minority thought it was a mistake. 

I'm trying to remember any specific polls from that time. I think that in the early to mid-60s, support for the war was still above 50%, but there was a growing opposition. Maybe around 30-40% opposed it by 1965. So looking at the options, 25% is option I, 30% is J, 45% is G, 50% is C, etc. 

Wait, I think that by 1967 or 1968, a majority started opposing the war, but in 1965, it was still more supportive. So perhaps around 25-30% thought it was a mistake then. 

I've heard the term "silent majority" used later, but that was more Nixon's term in the late 60s. So in 1965, the opposition was less. Maybe around 25%? That would be option I. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think I might have read somewhere that by 1966, opposition was increasing, but in 1965, it was lower. 

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the exact percentages. Maybe it was around 30% in 1965. So option J is 30%. Or perhaps the number was even lower, like 10% or 25%. 

I'm a bit confused because I remember that in 1965, President Johnson was increasing troop levels, and the first major protests were starting around that time. So maybe public opinion was just beginning to turn, leading to maybe a quarter of the population opposing it. 

Wait, another angle: I think the Gulf of Tonkin incident was in 1964, leading to increased U.S. involvement. So by 1965, the troop levels were rising. Maybe the initial support was high, but by mid-1965, some doubts were creeping in. 

I'm trying to think if there's a specific poll or survey from that time. I think that in 1965, the number of people who thought it was a mistake was in the lower double digits. So maybe 25% or 30%. 

I think I've read that in 1965, about a quarter of Americans had doubts, so 25%. That would correspond to option I. Alternatively, if it's 30%, then J. 

Another thought: I remember that in 1966, a poll showed that a majority still supported the war, but the opposition was growing. So in 1965, maybe it was less than a third. So 25% might make sense. 

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is around 25%, which is option I.

The question asks what percentage of Americans thought sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake in 1965. Based on historical context, public opinion on the Vietnam War shifted over time, with initial support in the early 1960s and growing opposition as the war escalated. By 1965, when troop levels increased, a small but significant portion of the population began to question the decision. 

While support for the war remained above 50% in 1965, opposition was starting to grow. Historical data suggests that around 25% of Americans thought sending troops was a mistake by that year. This aligns with option I, which represents 25%.

Answer: I
