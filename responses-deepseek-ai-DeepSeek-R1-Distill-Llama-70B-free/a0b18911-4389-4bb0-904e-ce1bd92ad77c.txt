Alright, so I have this problem here about calculating the net price of a Speedway Racing Set after two discounts. Hmm, okay, let me try to work through it step by step. 

The list price is $84, and it's discounted first by 20% and then by another 10%. I remember that when you have multiple discounts, you don't just add them up. Instead, each discount is applied one after the other. So, the first discount reduces the price, and then the second discount is applied to that already reduced price.

Let me break it down. The original price is $84. The first discount is 20%. So, I need to find 20% of 84 and subtract that from 84. Alternatively, I could calculate 80% of 84 because if you take away 20%, you're left with 80%. That might be easier.

Calculating 80% of 84: 0.8 * 84. Let me do that multiplication. 84 times 0.8... Well, 80 times 0.8 is 64, and 4 times 0.8 is 3.2, so adding those gives 67.2. So, after the first discount, the price is $67.20.

Now, the second discount is 10%. This time, it's 10% off the new price of $67.20. Again, instead of subtracting 10%, I can calculate 90% of 67.20 because that's the remaining amount after the discount. So, 0.9 multiplied by 67.20.

Let me compute that. 67.20 times 0.9. Hmm, 60 times 0.9 is 54, and 7.2 times 0.9 is 6.48. Adding those together, 54 + 6.48 equals 60.48. So, the final price after both discounts should be $60.48.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is $60.48. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when I'm dealing with percentages, it's easy to mix up the order or the application.

Original price: $84.

First discount: 20% off means I'm paying 80% of the original. 84 * 0.8 = 67.2. That seems right.

Second discount: 10% off the new price. So 10% of 67.2 is 6.72, subtracting that from 67.2 gives 60.48. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, I can think of it as applying both discounts together. So the first discount is 20%, which is a factor of 0.8, and the second is 10%, which is 0.9. Multiplying those factors together: 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72. Then, 84 * 0.72 would give the final price.

Let me compute 84 * 0.72. 80 * 0.72 is 57.6, and 4 * 0.72 is 2.88. Adding those gives 57.6 + 2.88 = 60.48. Same answer again. So I'm pretty confident that the net price is $60.48.

So looking back at the options, option B is $60.48, which matches my calculation.

The list price of the Speedway Racing Set is $84. After applying a 20% discount, the price becomes $67.20 (80% of $84). A subsequent 10% discount reduces the price further to $60.48 (90% of $67.20). 

Thus, the net price is **$60.48**, which corresponds to option B.
