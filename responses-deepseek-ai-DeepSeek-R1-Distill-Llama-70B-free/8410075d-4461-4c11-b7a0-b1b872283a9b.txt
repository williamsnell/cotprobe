Okay, so I have this problem about calculating inventory value using FIFO. Hmm, FIFO stands for First In, First Out, right? That means the company sells the oldest inventory first. So, the value of the remaining inventory is based on the most recent purchases. 

The problem says MotorollaElectronics has 30 widgets on hand. They provided some records of purchases and an inventory entry. Let me list out the information given:

- Inventory on Dec. 2: 6 units at $2.30 each.
- Purchase on Jan. 15: 352 units at $2.50.
- Purchase on Feb. 4: 101 units at $2.20.
- Purchase on Feb. 14: 645 units at $2.00.

Wait, so the inventory is 30 widgets, and the question is to find the value using FIFO. So, I think I need to figure out how many units from each purchase are left in inventory and then calculate the total cost.

Let me think about the timeline. The company starts with 6 units. Then they make a purchase of 352 in January, then 101 in February 4th, and then 645 on Feb 14th. But wait, the problem is about the inventory on hand, so perhaps the inventory is after all these transactions. But the initial inventory is 6, which is before any purchases. Or wait, maybe the initial inventory is the starting point, and the purchases are added to it.

Wait, the problem says "It discovers that it has 30 widgets on hand." So, the current inventory is 30. So, the company must have sold some widgets since the purchases, leaving them with 30. So, to find the value, I need to track which units remain.

But wait, the purchases are over time, so the FIFO method would mean that the earliest purchased units are sold first. So, the remaining 30 would be the most recent ones.

Let me think step by step.

First, starting with the earliest transaction.

1. Dec. 2: They have 6 units. Let's call this batch A: 6 units at $2.30.

2. Then, on Jan 15, they purchase 352 units (batch B: 352 at $2.50).

3. On Feb 4, another purchase: 101 units (batch C: 101 at $2.20).

4. On Feb 14, another purchase: 645 units (batch D: 645 at $2.00).

But now, total units purchased would be 6 (initial) +352 +101 +645. Wait, no, the initial 6 is inventory, not a purchase. Wait, the initial inventory is 6 units. Then they make purchases, so the total units available for sale would be 6 +352 +101 +645. But the company only has 30 left, so they must have sold a lot.

Wait, but how? Let me calculate the total units they have before any sales.

Total units = initial inventory + all purchases.

Wait, but initial inventory is 6, then they buy 352, so total after that is 6+352=358. Then they buy 101 more, making 459. Then another 645, making 1104. So, total units before any sales would be 6 +352 +101 +645 = 1104.

But the company has 30 widgets on hand, so they sold 1104 -30 = 1074 units.

Using FIFO, the first units sold would be the earliest ones. So, the first to go would be batch A (6 units), then batch B (352), then batch C (101), and then batch D (645). But we only sold 1074, so let's see how much of each batch is sold.

Batch A: 6 units. All sold because FIFO says first out.

Batch B: 352 units. All sold next, since they were purchased before C and D.

So after selling A and B, that's 6 +352 = 358 units sold.

Now, we have 1074 -358 = 716 units left to sell from the next batches.

Next is batch C: 101 units. So all of batch C is sold. Now total sold is 358 +101 = 459.

Remaining to sell: 716 -101 = 615.

Next is batch D: 645 units. So, they sell 615 units from D.

So, how much remains in each batch?

Batch A: 0 (all sold)

Batch B: 0 (all sold)

Batch C: 0 (all sold)

Batch D: 645 -615 = 30 units remaining.

So, the 30 units in inventory are from batch D, which was purchased at $2.00 each.

Therefore, the total value is 30 units * $2.00 = $60.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, initial inventory:6. Then purchase 352, so total before next purchase is 6+352=358. Then purchase 101, so 459. Then purchase 645, total 1104. They have 30 left, so sold 1074.

FIFO: sell in the order of batches A, B, C, D.

So, units sold:

A:6, B:352, C:101. Total sold after C: 6+352+101=459.

Remaining to sell:1074-459=615.

Batch D has 645, so we take 615 from D, leaving 645-615=30.

So, the 30 units are from D, costing $2.00 each.

Total value:30 *2=$60.

Looking at the options, option F is $60.00.

To determine the value of the widgets in inventory using the FIFO (First In, First Out) method, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Initial Inventory (Dec. 2):** 6 units at $2.30 each.  
2. **Purchase (Jan. 15):** 352 units at $2.50 each.  
3. **Purchase (Feb. 4):** 101 units at $2.20 each.  
4. **Purchase (Feb. 14):** 645 units at $2.00 each.  

The company has 30 widgets remaining in inventory, meaning they have sold a total of \( 6 + 352 + 101 + 645 - 30 = 1074 \) units. Under FIFO, the oldest units are sold first. The sequence of sales is as follows:

- **Batch A (Dec. 2):** All 6 units are sold.  
- **Batch B (Jan. 15):** All 352 units are sold.  
- **Batch C (Feb. 4):** All 101 units are sold.  
- **Batch D (Feb. 14):** \( 1074 - (6 + 352 + 101) = 615 \) units are sold.  

This leaves \( 645 - 615 = 30 \) units remaining in Batch D. Since Batch D was purchased at $2.00 per unit, the value of the remaining inventory is:  

\[
30 \, \text{units} \times \$2.00 \, \text{per unit} = \$60.00
\]

Thus, the value of the widgets in inventory is **$60.00**.

**Answer: F**
