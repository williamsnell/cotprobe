Question:

Loretta Landlord owned a commercial building in a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community. One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving. If Loretta then sued Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for

Options:

A: Loretta, only if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change.
B: Loretta, if she can prove that Sally intended to breach the contract from the start.
C: Sally, because the change in law was beyond her control.
D: Sally, because the law change is a valid reason for terminating the lease.
E: Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.
F: Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.
G: Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.
H: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.
I: Sally, because the law change made the purpose of the lease void.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about a lease agreement and a breach of contract. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

So, the situation is that Loretta Landlord owns a commercial building, and she's renting a space to a dance troop on a month-to-month basis for $500 a month. The dance troop's director moves away, they can't find a new one, so they fold and leave the space. Then Sally Sleazy comes in, sees the empty space, and thinks it's perfect for a topless strip joint. She rents it under a two-year lease at $1,000 a month without telling Loretta what she plans to use it for. 

Then, a month after the strip joint opens, the County Commissioners pass a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally tells Loretta that because of this new law, she can't operate, so she's leaving. Now, Loretta is suing Sally for breach of the lease contract. We need to determine who would win.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that contract law has certain principles about impossibility or impracticability of performance and how changes in the law can affect contracts. Let me think about the relevant doctrines here.

First, when a contract is made, both parties are obligated to perform unless certain exceptions apply. One of these exceptions is impossibility of performance. But I think the impossibility doctrine is quite narrow. It usually applies when the performance becomes physically or legally impossible through no fault of the party seeking to be excused.

Wait, so in this case, the new law makes operating a topless strip joint illegal. So Sally can't operate her business there anymore because it's against the law. But is that enough to excuse her from the lease?

I remember a case where a change in the law made performance illegal, and that can sometimes discharge the contract. For example, if the contract requires doing something that becomes illegal, the parties are excused from performing. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Another point is that Sally didn't disclose her intended use when she signed the lease. Loretta might not have known that the space was going to be a strip joint, especially since it was previously used by a dance troop. But the lease was for a commercial space, so maybe she should have anticipated any lawful use. The problem is whether the new law affects the enforceability of the lease.

Wait, but the lease was signed before the law was passed. So at the time the lease was made, Sally's intended use wasn't illegal. The law changed afterward. So, does that mean that Sally is still bound by the lease, or is she excused because the subsequent law makes her use illegal?

I think the general rule is that if a law changes after the contract is made, rendering performance illegal, the contract is not automatically discharged. However, in some situations, if the contract specifically relied on the continued legality of the activity, it might be different.

Alternatively, if the lease included any provisions about compliance with laws, that could affect the outcome. But the question doesn't mention such terms, so I assume it's a standard lease.

Another angle is the concept of frustration of purpose. This is when the reason for making the contract is frustrated by an unforeseen event, making the contract essentially pointless. But frustration of purpose is also narrowly applied. The event must not be the fault of either party and must destroy the purpose of the contract, which was known to both parties at the time of contracting.

In this case, Sally's purpose was to run a strip joint. If Loretta didn't know about that purpose, maybe frustration of purpose doesn't apply because it wasn't within the contemplation of both parties when the lease was made. So Sally might not be able to use frustration of purpose to get out of the lease.

Wait, but the lease was for a commercial space, and the previous tenant was a dance troop. So Loretta might have expected a certain type of business, but Sally's use as a strip joint might be a different use. If the lease didn't specify the use, Sally might have been allowed to use it as she saw fit, as long as it's legal. But after the law changed, it's no longer legal.

So the question is, can Sally terminate the lease because the law now prohibits her business? Or is she still on the hook for the lease payments?

I think the key here is whether the change in law makes performance impossible. Since the law now prohibits the use, Sally can't operate, so she might argue that performance is impossible. But I'm not sure if that's a valid defense because the impossibility came after the contract was formed.

Wait, there's a concept called "supervening illegality." If a contract becomes illegal after it's made due to a change in law, the parties may be excused from performing. But I'm not entirely certain about the specifics. Let me think about this more carefully.

In some jurisdictions, if the performance of a contract becomes illegal as a result of a change in the law, the contract may be deemed terminated because the purpose of the contract has been frustrated. But again, this might depend on whether the parties could have foreseen the change in the law.

In this scenario, the County Commissioners passed the law after the lease was signed. So, at the time of the lease, Sally's intended use wasn't illegal. She started operating, then the law changed, making her business illegal. So, she can't continue.

But does that make her breach of the lease excusable? Or is she still liable because she should have anticipated that the law might change, or because she's bound by the contract regardless?

I remember that contracts are generally binding, and changes in law don't usually discharge the contract unless the contract specifically depends on the law remaining the same. So, if the lease didn't mention anything about complying with future laws, Sally might still be liable.

Alternatively, if operating a strip joint became illegal, and the lease required her to comply with all laws, then she might have a defense. But without such a clause, it's unclear.

Wait, but even if there's no such clause, if the law makes the use illegal, the tenant can't operate, so maybe they can terminate. But I'm not sure if that's a recognized legal principle.

Another point: Loretta is suing Sally for breach. So Sally would have to defend by showing that she's not in breach, perhaps due to impossibility or frustration.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: Loretta wins only if she can prove Sally knew about the upcoming law change. I don't think that's necessary because Sally's knowledge of the law change isn't the main issue. The issue is whether the law change affects her obligation.

Option B: Loretta wins if she can prove Sally intended to breach from the start. But there's no indication Sally planned to breach; she operated for a month before the law changed.

Option C: Sally wins because the change was beyond her control. But beyond her control doesn't automatically mean she's excused unless it's impossibility.

Option D: Sally wins because the law change is a valid reason. I'm not sure if the law change is a valid reason unless it's under impossibility.

Option E: Sally because the law made performance impossible. This sounds like impossibility, but whether it applies here is the question.

Option F: Same as E, discharge under impossibility.

Option G: Loretta, if she didn't know of Sally's intended use. Maybe if Loretta didn't know, but I'm not sure how that affects the breach.

Option H: Loretta because the law was passed after the lease. This might suggest that the lease stands regardless, but I'm not certain.

Option I: Sally because the law made the purpose void. This might relate to frustration of purpose, but again, if Loretta didn't know the purpose, then maybe not.

Wait, the lease was for a commercial space. The intended use wasn't specified, so Sally's use as a strip joint might be a permissible use under the lease unless prohibited. But the new law prohibits it, so maybe Sally can't perform.

But is the impossibility doctrine applicable when the impossibility arises from a change in law after the contract is made? I think that's a tricky point. In some cases, courts have held that a subsequent change in law making performance illegal does not discharge the contract unless the contract was based on the assumption that the law wouldn't change.

Alternatively, if the lease requires the tenant to comply with all laws, then when the law changes, the tenant can't comply, but if the lease doesn't have such a clause, the tenant is still obligated.

But in this problem, the lease didn't specify the use, so Sally could use it as she saw fit as long as it was legal. But after the law changed, her use became illegal, so she can't continue.

Wait, but does that make the lease impossible to perform? Or does it just make her business illegal, but she could potentially use the space for another purpose.

Ah, that's a good point. The lease is for the space, not specifically for operating a strip joint. So Sally could, in theory, use the space for another lawful business. So the fact that her intended business is now illegal doesn't necessarily make the lease impossible to perform. She could find another use for the space, perhaps.

But if she's only interested in using it as a strip joint, then she might argue that the lease's purpose is frustrated. But again, without Loretta knowing that purpose, it's harder to claim frustration.

So, putting this together, Sally's obligation under the lease is to pay rent. She's stopping payment because her business is illegal, but she could use the space for something else. Therefore, she can't claim impossibility because she can still perform by using the space lawfully in another way.

Alternatively, if the lease required her to operate a strip joint, then it would be impossible, but the lease just rents the space, not the specific use. Therefore, Sally is still obligated to pay, and if she stops, she's in breach.

So, Loretta would likely win because Sally can't claim impossibility since she can still use the space for another lawful purpose. Therefore, the breach is on Sally's part, and Loretta can get a judgment against her.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me match this conclusion.

Option H says Loretta wins because the new law was passed after the lease was executed. So the fact that the law came after doesn't affect the lease.

Option E says Sally wins because the law made performance impossible. But as I thought, since she can use the space for another purpose, performance isn't impossible, so E isn't correct.

Option B says Loretta wins if she can prove Sally intended to breach from the start. But there's no indication Sally intended that; she operated for a month. So B isn't it.

Option G: Loretta wins only if she didn't know about the use. If Loretta didn't know Sally's intended use, maybe she can enforce the lease regardless. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Wait, another thought: if Sally didn't disclose her intended use, does that matter? For example, if the lease was based on a mutual understanding of the use, and Sally misled Loretta, maybe Loretta can argue fraud or misrepresentation. But the question doesn't mention that Loretta relied on Sally's intended use, so maybe that's not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the lease requires the tenant to comply with all laws, then Sally's breach of that condition could lead to termination, but the question doesn't state such a term.

So, going back, if Sally can't operate her strip joint because it's now illegal, but she can use the space for another business, then she's still obligated under the lease. Therefore, she's in breach, and Loretta would win.

So looking at the options, option H says Loretta wins because the new law was passed after the lease. That makes sense because the lease is enforceable regardless of subsequent laws unless the contract is discharged by impossibility, which in this case it isn't because Sally can use the space for another purpose.

Wait, but option H says Loretta wins because the new law was passed after the lease was executed. So the timing of the law doesn't invalidate the lease; the lease remains in force.

Alternatively, option B is about intent to breach, which doesn't apply here.

So, the correct answer would be H: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the fact that Sally can use the space for another purpose means she can't claim impossibility, so Loretta would win regardless of the law's timing. So maybe H is correct, but maybe another option is better.

Alternatively, option E is about impossibility, which I don't think applies because she can still perform the lease.

So, the likely outcome is that the court would rule for Loretta because Sally can't claim impossibility since she can use the space for another purpose. Therefore, Sally is in breach.

But looking at the options again, H says Loretta wins because the new law was passed after the lease. That seems correct because the lease was valid when made, and a subsequent law doesn't automatically discharge the contract unless it's impossible, which it isn't here.

So, the answer should be H.

The question revolves around a lease agreement between Loretta Landlord and Sally Sleazy. Loretta leased a commercial space to Sally for two years at $1,000 per month. Sally intended to operate a topless strip joint but did not disclose this use to Loretta. Shortly after opening, a new law prohibited topless strip joints in the area, and Sally claimed the law made her business impossible to operate, leading her to vacate the premises. Loretta sued Sally for breach of the lease, and the issue is whether Sally can be excused from her obligations under the lease.

Key legal principles include impossibility of performance and frustration of purpose. Impossibility applies when performance becomes physically or legally impossible through no fault of the party seeking excuse. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines the contract's purpose, but this doctrine is narrowly applied and requires the purpose to be known to both parties at the time of contracting.

In this case, the new law prohibiting topless strip joints was enacted after the lease was signed. While this change in law made Sally's intended use illegal, it does not necessarily discharge the lease because the lease was for the commercial space itself, not specifically for operating a strip joint. Sally could still use the space for another lawful purpose, meaning performance of the lease is not truly impossible. Without a clause in the lease requiring compliance with future laws, Sally cannot claim impossibility or frustration of purpose as a valid defense.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I**: These options incorrectly focus on factors like Sally's knowledge of the law change, intent to breach, or frustration of purpose, which are not supported by the facts or applicable law.
- **H**: This is correct because the lease was valid when executed, and a subsequent law does not automatically discharge the contract unless performance becomes impossible. Since Sally can still use the space for another lawful purpose, the lease remains enforceable.

Thus, the likely outcome is a judgment for Loretta because the new law, passed after the lease was executed, does not excuse Sally from her obligations under the lease.

Answer: H
