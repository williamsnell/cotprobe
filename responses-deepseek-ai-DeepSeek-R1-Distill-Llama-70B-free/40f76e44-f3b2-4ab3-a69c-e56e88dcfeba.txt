Okay, so I have this question about vector spaces and matrices. Hmm, let me try to parse it step by step.

The problem is about a real vector space V with finite dimension n. We're looking at the set of matrices from V into itself, which is M(V). So M(V) would be the space of all n x n real matrices since each such matrix represents a linear transformation from V to V.

Now, there's a linear transformation T in M(V). We're considering two subspaces U and W. 

U is the set of all matrices X in M(V) such that TX = XT. Oh right, these are the matrices that commute with T. So U is the commutant of T, I think.

W is the set of all matrices of the form TX - XT for some X in M(V). So W is the image of the commutator map, right? Because for any X, TX - XT is the commutator of T and X, and W is the span of all such commutators.

The question asks which statements I, II, III are true.

I: If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then U = M(V). 

Wait, if T is diagonalizable (which it would be if there's a basis of eigenvectors), then any matrix that commutes with T must also be diagonal in that basis. Because if T is diagonal, then a matrix X that commutes with T must also be diagonal—since off-diagonal elements would cause TX and XT to differ. So in that case, U is the set of all diagonal matrices. But M(V) is the set of all n x n matrices. So U isn't all of M(V) unless n=1. So wait, the statement I says that U equals M(V) if T is diagonalizable. That doesn't seem right. Because even if T is diagonal, only diagonal matrices commute with it. So unless T is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, U won't be the entire space. Oh wait, wait. If T is a scalar multiple of the identity, then TX = XT for any X, so U would be all of M(V). But in the statement I, it's when V has a basis of eigenvectors. So T is diagonalizable but not necessarily a scalar matrix. So I would be false because U would be the set of diagonal matrices, which isn't all of M(V) unless n=1. 

Wait, no, if T is the identity matrix, then all X would commute with T, so U would be M(V). But if T is diagonal but not the identity, U is smaller. So the statement I says that if V has a basis of eigenvectors for T, then U is M(V). That's only true if T is a scalar matrix. So I would be false in general. So I is not necessarily true.

II: dim(U) + dim(W) = n².

Hmm, I remember that in some contexts, the dimension of U plus the dimension of W equals the dimension of M(V), which is n². Is that the case here?

Wait, M(V) has dimension n² because each matrix is an n x n matrix. Now, U is the commutant of T, and W is the image of the commutator map. I think there's a formula related to the dimensions here. Let me think. For a linear operator T on M(V), the commutator map ad_T(X) = TX - XT is a linear transformation on M(V). The image of this map is W, and the kernel is U. So by the rank-nullity theorem, dim(U) + dim(W) = dim(M(V)) which is n². So statement II should be true.

Wait, let me double-check. The kernel of ad_T is exactly U, because X is in the kernel if ad_T(X) = 0, which is TX = XT. The image is W, since W is all matrices of the form TX - XT. So by rank-nullity, dim(U) + dim(W) = dim(M(V)) = n². So II is correct.

III: dim(U) < n.

Wait, U is the set of matrices that commute with T. The dimension of U depends on T. For example, if T is the identity matrix, then U is all of M(V), which has dimension n². So in that case, dim(U) would be n², which is not less than n (since n ≥1, and n² >= n for n >1). So III can't be correct in that case. So statement III is false.

So to recap:

I: False. Because unless T is a scalar matrix, U isn't M(V).

II: True. Because of rank-nullity.

III: False. Because U could have a dimension larger than n, like n² when T is identity.

So which options are correct? Let's look at the options.

The options are about which statements are true.

I and III: Only II is true, so options that don't include II are out.

Looking at the options:

Option H: II only.

So the correct answer should be H.

The problem involves a real vector space \( V \) of finite dimension \( n \), and the space of matrices \( M(V) \), which has dimension \( n^2 \). We are given a linear transformation \( T \in M(V) \) and two subspaces:

- \( U = \{ X \in M(V) : TX = XT \} \), the set of matrices that commute with \( T \).
- \( W = \{ TX - XT : X \in M(V) \} \), the image of the commutator map.

We analyze the given statements:

1. **Statement I**: "If \( V \) has a basis containing only eigenvectors of \( T \), then \( U = M(V) \)."  
   This is false. If \( T \) is diagonalizable (i.e., has a basis of eigenvectors), \( U \) consists of all diagonal matrices in that basis, which is a strict subset of \( M(V) \) unless \( T \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Thus, \( U \) is generally not equal to \( M(V) \).

2. **Statement II**: " \( \dim(U) + \dim(W) = n^2 \)."  
   This is true. The commutator map \( \text{ad}_T(X) = TX - XT \) is a linear transformation on \( M(V) \). By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the kernel (\( U \)) plus the dimension of the image (\( W \)) equals the dimension of \( M(V) \), which is \( n^2 \). Hence, \( \dim(U) + \dim(W) = n^2 \).

3. **Statement III**: " \( \dim(U) < n \)."  
   This is false. The dimension of \( U \) depends on \( T \). For example, if \( T \) is the identity matrix, \( U = M(V) \), and \( \dim(U) = n^2 \), which is not less than \( n \) for \( n > 1 \). Thus, \( \dim(U) \) can be much larger than \( n \).

From the analysis, only Statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: II only.**
