Question:

A landlord, an owner in fee simple, leased a three- story house to a tenant for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the student, because the new owner should have notified him about the taxes.
B: the new owner.
C: the landlord, because he never objected to the assignment.
D: the student, because he was not aware of the original lease agreement.
E: the new owner, because the student was not part of the original lease agreement.
F: the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not "run with the land," unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.
G: the tenant, because he was the one who originally agreed to pay the taxes.
H: the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.
I: the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not "run with the land. "

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this landlord-tenant law question. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, so there's a landlord who owns a three-story house outright (fee simple). He leased it to a tenant for 10 years. The lease says the tenant has to pay $300 a month and also pay the taxes on the premises during the lease. Also, the lease says the tenant can't assign or sublease the property. So, the tenant and his family lived there for two years, then the tenant assigned his leasehold interest to a student. The tenant still owed three months' rent. The assignment was in writing and said the student would pay the $300 monthly rent but didn't mention taxes. The landlord didn't object to this assignment. Six months later, the landlord sold the property to a new owner. The student didn't pay the taxes, so the new owner paid them and sued the student for reimbursement. The question is who wins.

Hmm. So the issue is about whether the student is responsible for paying the taxes. I remember from my property classes that when a lease has a covenant, it can sometimes "run with the land," meaning it's binding on future tenants or owners. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

First, let's break down the lease terms. The tenant agreed to pay taxes. The lease also prohibited assignment or subleasing. But the tenant went ahead and assigned it anyway. The landlord didn't object, which might be important. So, does the assignment violate the lease? Well, the lease says the tenant can't assign, but if the landlord doesn't object, maybe the assignment is still valid, or maybe the landlord waived that condition. But I'm not sure if that affects the covenant to pay taxes.

Now, when the tenant assigned the lease to the student, the student didn't agree to pay taxes in the assignment. So the written assignment only covers the $300 rent. But the original lease had the tenant agreeing to pay taxes. So the question is whether this obligation passes to the student.

I think covenants can run with the land in two ways: as real covenants or equitable servitudes. Real covenants require that the covenant "touches and concerns" the land, intent to run, and notice. Equitable servitudes don't need all that, but usually, the covenant has to be in writing and meet certain criteria.

In this case, the original lease had the tenant agreeing to pay taxes. Taxes are a burden that touches and concerns the land because they affect the property's value. So the covenant likely runs with the land. But wait, the original lease was between the landlord and the tenant. The student is an assignee. So when the tenant assigns the lease, does the student take on all the covenants, including paying taxes?

I think so, because when a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee (student) steps into the tenant's shoes and is bound by all the terms of the original lease. Even if the assignment itself didn't mention taxes, the original lease's terms still apply. The student becomes the new tenant under the lease, so they have to comply with all the covenants.

But wait, there's another angle. The lease prohibited assignment without consent. The tenant assigned without consent, but the landlord didn't object. So maybe the landlord's inaction constitutes consent, making the assignment valid. If the assignment is valid, then the student is bound by the lease terms, including paying taxes.

So when the new owner bought the property, they took it subject to the lease. Since the student is the current tenant, the new owner can enforce the lease terms, including the tax payment.

Wait, but the student didn't agree to pay taxes in the assignment. Does that matter? I think the assignment doesn't have to restate all the terms; it's enough that the original lease is still in effect. So the student, as assignee, is bound by all the terms, including the tax covenant.

So when the student didn't pay the taxes, the new owner had to pay them and now sues the student. The student is liable because they're bound by the tax covenant.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the student isn't liable because the covenant doesn't run unless clearly expressed. But in the original lease, it was clearly expressed, so F is wrong.

Option H says the student didn't contract to pay taxes, but as an assignee, they're bound regardless of their own agreement.

Option I says the covenant is collateral and doesn't run, but I think that's incorrect because tax covenants typically do run.

So the judgment should be for the new owner against the student. Looking at the options, the correct answer should be B: the new owner.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the original lease required the tenant to pay taxes, and the assignment didn't mention it, does the student still have to pay? Yes, because the assignment doesn't create a new lease; it's a transfer of the existing lease. So the student is still subject to the original terms.

Therefore, the new owner can enforce the tax covenant against the student. So the correct answer is B.

The landlord leased a property to a tenant for 10 years, with the lease requiring the tenant to pay $300 monthly rent and taxes. The lease prohibited assignment or subleasing, but the tenant assigned the lease to a student without the landlord's explicit consent. The landlord did not object to the assignment. The written assignment only mentioned the $300 rent and was silent on taxes. Later, the landlord sold the property to a new owner, and the student failed to pay the taxes. The new owner paid the taxes and sued the student for reimbursement.

The key issue is whether the student, as the assignee, is responsible for paying the taxes under the original lease. When a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee typically steps into the tenant's shoes and is bound by all the terms of the original lease, including any covenants. The covenant to pay taxes "touches and concerns the land" and is intended to run with the property. Even though the assignment did not explicitly mention taxes, the student, as the new tenant, is still obligated to comply with the original lease terms.

The landlord's failure to object to the assignment likely constitutes implied consent, making the assignment valid. The new owner, as the successor in interest, can enforce the lease terms, including the tax covenant, against the student. The student's lack of awareness of the original lease agreement does not absolve them of responsibility, as they are bound by the terms of the lease upon assignment.

Options F and I are incorrect because the covenant to pay taxes does run with the land, as it touches and concerns the property. Option H is also incorrect because the student, as assignee, is bound by the original lease terms regardless of whether they explicitly agreed to pay taxes. The correct judgment is for the new owner.
