Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking how fast light travels in glass with a refractive index of 1.5. The options are all different speeds, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the refractive index relates to how much light slows down when entering a medium. Oh right, the formula is n equals c over v, where n is the refractive index, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and v is the speed in the medium. So I can rearrange that to find v equals c divided by n.

The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant, right? I think it's approximately 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. Oh wait, but the options are in centimeters per second. So I need to convert that. Let me think, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 3.00 x 10^8 m/s is 3.00 x 10^10 cm/s. Because 10^8 meters is 10^10 centimeters. Yeah, that makes sense.

So if the refractive index n is 1.5, then the speed v is c divided by 1.5. So plugging in the numbers: 3.00 x 10^10 cm/s divided by 1.5. Let me calculate that. 3 divided by 1.5 is 2, so 3e10 / 1.5 is 2e10 cm/s. So 2.00 x 10^10 cm/s. 

Looking at the options, option A is 2.00 × 10^10 cm/sec. So that should be the right answer. But wait, let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't get it backwards. Oh yeah, n is the ratio of the speed in vacuum to the speed in the medium. So n = c/v → v = c/n. Yep, that's correct.

I don't think any of the other options match. Let me glance through them again. Option B is 1.5e10, which would be if n was 2, right? Because 3e10 / 2 is 1.5e10. Option J is close to the vacuum speed, but that's only in a medium with n approaching 1, like air. So no, J is 2.99e10, which is almost the speed in vacuum, so that's not right.

So I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is A.

To determine how fast light travels in glass with a refractive index of 1.5, we use the relationship between the refractive index \( n \), the speed of light in a vacuum \( c \), and the speed of light in the medium \( v \). The formula is:

\[
n = \frac{c}{v} \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad v = \frac{c}{n}.
\]

The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately \( c = 3.00 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \). Substituting \( n = 1.5 \) into the equation:

\[
v = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{10}}{1.5} = 2.00 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass is \( 2.00 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \), which corresponds to option A. Other options either represent incorrect calculations or speeds in different media.
