Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about simple harmonic motion (SHM). Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on SHM, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a fingernail file is clamped in a vise at one end, and the other end is being vibrated to and fro. The motion is approximately SHM. The frequency is 10 vibrations per second, and the amplitude is 4 millimeters. The question is asking for the velocity when the displacement is 2 millimeters.

Hmm, right. SHM... I remember that in SHM, the velocity isn't constant like in uniform motion. It varies with the displacement. Oh wait, the maximum velocity occurs when the displacement is zero, and it's zero when the displacement is at its maximum (the amplitude). So velocity depends on how far the object is from the equilibrium position.

I think the formula for velocity in SHM is v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²), where ω is the angular frequency, A is the amplitude, and x is the displacement from the mean position. Oh wait, wait. Or was it v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²)? Yeah, that sounds right. Because when x is zero (at the equilibrium point), the velocity is maximum, which is ω*A. And when x is A, velocity is zero. That makes sense.

So first, I need to find ω. Angular frequency is related to the regular frequency. Oh right, ω = 2πf. The frequency given is 10 Hz, so ω = 2π *10 = 20π rad/s.

The amplitude A is 4 mm. The displacement x is 2 mm. So substituting into the formula:

v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²)
v = 20π * sqrt( (4)^2 - (2)^2 )
v = 20π * sqrt(16 -4)
v = 20π * sqrt(12)

Wait, sqrt(12) can be simplified. Sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So sqrt(12)= about 3.464, but maybe I can keep it symbolic for now.

So v = 20π * 2 * sqrt(3)
Wait no, wait. No, wait, let me correct that. sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 20π * sqrt(12) is 20π * 2 * sqrt(3)/2? Wait no, wait. Let me not get confused. Wait, sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so:

v = 20π * (2 * sqrt(3)) ) ?

Wait wait no, no. Wait, sqrt(12) is 2 times sqrt(3), yes. So 20π * sqrt(12) = 20π * 2 * sqrt(3) ?

Wait no, 20π multiplied by sqrt(12) which is 2*sqrt(3). So that's 20π * 2 * sqrt(3) = 40π*sqrt(3). Wait, no, no. Wait. Let me compute sqrt(12) correctly. 12 is 4*3, so sqrt(4*3)=2√3. So sqrt(12)=2√3. So 20π * 2√3 = 40π√3 mm/s.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because 20π times sqrt(12) is 20π times 2√3, which is 40π√3. Hmm, but wait, let me think in numbers. Let me compute the numerical value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it numerically step by step.

So, v = 20π * sqrt(12). Let me compute sqrt(12) first. Sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(12)= approx 3.464.

So 20π is approximately 62.83 (since π is about 3.1416, 20*3.1416=62.832). Multiply that by 3.464:

62.832 * 3.464. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 60 * 3.464 is 207.84, and 2.832 *3.464 is about... Let's see, 2*3.464=6.928, 0.832*3.464≈2.883. So 6.928 +2.883=9.811. So total is 207.84 +9.811≈217.65 mm/s.

Wait, but the options don't have 217.65. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:190, B:260, C:200, D:230, E:180, F:210, G:220, H:250, I:240, J:218.

Oh, J is 218 mm/s. That's very close to my approximate calculation of 217.65. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but let me double-check my approach. Because sometimes I might mix up formulas. Another way to calculate velocity is using v = ω√(A² - x²). Yes, that's the correct formula. So let me compute it again more accurately.

So, ω = 2πf = 20π rad/s.

A=4mm, x=2mm.

v=20π * sqrt(4² -2²) = 20π * sqrt(16-4) =20π * sqrt(12) = 20π*(2√3) )=40π√3.

Wait wait, wait. 20π multiplied by sqrt(12) is 20π*(2√3) =40π√3. Because sqrt(12)=2√3, so 20π * 2√3 is 40π√3.

Wait, but wait, 40π√3 is approximately 40 *3.1416 *1.732.

Let me compute that: 40 *3.1416 is about 125.664. Multiply by 1.732: 125.664 *1.732.

Let me compute 125 *1.732 = 216.5, and 0.664*1.732≈1.15. So total is approximately 217.65 mm/s. So yeah, about 218 mm/s, which is option J.

So the correct answer should be J:218 mm/sec.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the free end of the fingernail file, which undergoes simple harmonic motion (SHM). The velocity in SHM is given by the formula:

\[
v = \omega \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}
\]

where:
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, related to the frequency \( f \) by \( \omega = 2\pi f \),
- \( A \) is the amplitude,
- \( x \) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \omega \)
The frequency is given as \( f = 10 \, \text{Hz} \), so:

\[
\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \cdot 10 = 20\pi \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute known values
The amplitude is \( A = 4 \, \text{mm} \), and the displacement is \( x = 2 \, \text{mm} \). Substituting these into the formula:

\[
v = 20\pi \sqrt{4^2 - 2^2} = 20\pi \sqrt{16 - 4} = 20\pi \sqrt{12}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify \( \sqrt{12} \)
Since \( \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3} \), we have:

\[
v = 20\pi \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = 40\pi\sqrt{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Approximate the numerical value
Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):

\[
v \approx 40 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 1.732 = 40 \cdot 5.441 = 217.65 \, \text{mm/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated velocity is approximately \( 217.65 \, \text{mm/s} \), which is very close to option \( J: 218 \, \text{mm/s} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: 218 mm/sec.**
