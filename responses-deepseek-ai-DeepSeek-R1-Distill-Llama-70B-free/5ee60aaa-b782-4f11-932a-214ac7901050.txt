Question:

A farmer who raises hens for egg production wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56 grams. He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?

Options:

A: Because tis more extreme than ±2.00, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
B: Because tis more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
C: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
D: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 20 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
E: Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 16 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
F: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 16 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
G: Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 20 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
H: Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
I: Because tis less extreme than ±2.00, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
J: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about a farmer testing egg masses. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the farmer wants eggs with a mean mass of 56 grams. He's looking at a new type of hen and took a random sample of 18 eggs. The mean of this sample is 54.1 grams. The distribution is symmetric and mound-shaped with no outliers, which probably means it's approximately normal, so that's good for using the t-test.

He conducted a t-test to see if the mean is different from 56 grams. The test statistic he got is t = -1.973. The significance level is 5%, so alpha is 0.05. I need to figure out whether he should reject the null hypothesis or not.

Wait, the null hypothesis here is that the mean is 56 grams. The alternative is that it's different from 56, so it's a two-tailed test. That makes sense because he's just checking if it's different, not higher or lower specifically.

The t-test uses degrees of freedom, which is sample size minus one. So with 18 eggs, the degrees of freedom (df) is 17. That's important because the critical t-value depends on the df.

I remember that for a two-tailed test with alpha 0.05, the critical t-value is the value where 2.5% is in each tail. I think for df=17, the critical t is around ±2.11, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, I might be mixing it up with other tables. Let me think. Oh right, the t-table: for df=17 and two-tailed 0.05, the critical value is approximately ±2.11. So our calculated t is -1.973.

So the absolute value of t is 1.973. Comparing this to 2.11, 1.973 is less than 2.11. That means the t-statistic is not as extreme as the critical value. So we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Looking at the options now. Let's see. The conclusion should be not to reject the null. So which option says that?

Option C says because t is less extreme than the critical value for 17 df, so don't reject. That looks right. Option D mentions 20 df, which is incorrect because our sample is 18, so df is 17. Option J talks about 18 df, which is wrong because df is n-1, so 17.

Other options like A and B compare to ±2.00 or ±1.96. Wait, 1.96 is the critical value for a z-test, not t-test. Because for large samples, t approaches z, but with 17 df, it's still a t-distribution. So those options are probably wrong.

So the correct reasoning is that since |t|=1.973 < critical t=2.11, we fail to reject the null. So the conclusion is that there's not enough evidence at 5% significance. So option C seems correct.

The farmer is testing whether the mean mass of eggs from a new type of hen differs from 56 grams using a t-test. He collected a random sample of 18 eggs, resulting in a sample mean of 54.1 grams. The test statistic is \( t = -1.973 \), and the significance level is 5% (\( \alpha = 0.05 \)). Since this is a two-tailed test, the critical \( t \)-value for 17 degrees of freedom (df = \( n-1 = 18-1 = 17 \)) is approximately \( \pm 2.11 \).

The absolute value of the test statistic \( |t| = 1.973 \) is less than the critical value \( 2.11 \). Therefore, the test statistic is not extreme enough to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.

Among the options provided, only **Option C** correctly states that \( t \) is less extreme than the critical value for 17 degrees of freedom, leading to the conclusion that the null hypothesis should not be rejected.
