Question:

A defendant and his friend were down on their luck. They decided they would make some extra cash by robbing the local liquor store. The friend didn't like guns and decided to use a toy gun, which looked like a real gun, but only shot water. The defendant was aware that the gun was not real. Their plan fixed, they walked into the liquor store late one afternoon when few customers were in the store. The friend produced the toy pistol and pointed it at the customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the clerk began to rummage behind the counter for the key to the register. While his head was ducked, the clerk pulled a shotgun from behind the counter and fired it at the defendant and his friend. The defendant dived to the side, but his friend was shot and killed. If the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death he should be found

Options:

A: guilty of felony murder.
B: not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill his friend.
D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.
E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
F: guilty of second degree murder.
G: guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
H: guilty of first degree murder.
I: guilty, because the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony when his friend was killed.
J: not guilty, because the defendant did not pull the trigger.

Okay, so I've got this question here about criminal law, specifically felony murder. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So the scenario is that a defendant and his friend are robbing a liquor store. The friend uses a toy gun that looks real but only shoots water. The defendant knows it's not real. They go in, the friend points the toy gun at people, and the defendant tells everyone to get down. The clerk, while ducking, grabs a shotgun and shoots the friend, killing him. Now, the defendant is charged with his friend's death.

The question is asking what the defendant should be found guilty of, if anything, from the given options.

I remember that felony murder is when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the defendant can be held liable even if they didn't intend or cause the death directly. But wait, there are some exceptions, right? Like the "merger rule" where if the felony is part of the murder, it can't be used. Also, the "felony murder rule" applies when the death is a foreseeable result of the felony.

In this case, the felony is robbery. The clerk shot the friend, so the question is whether the defendant is guilty of felony murder for the friend's death.

Wait, but I think there's something called the "co-felon" rule. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh right, the felony murder rule applies to all participants in the felony. But wait, if a co-felon is killed by a third party (like the clerk), does the defendant still get charged?

I think the general rule is that if a co-felon is killed during the commission of the felony, the other participants can be guilty of felony murder. Because the act that leads to the death is part of the felony, even if it's not by their own hand.

Wait, but some jurisdictions have exceptions. Like, if the killing was done by a third party, like a bystander or the victim, then it's more complicated. But in this case, the clerk is the victim of the robbery, so maybe it's considered a response to the felony.

But wait, the clerk was acting in self-defense, right? So if the clerk's action was justified, then the killing might not be felony murder. Because for felony murder, the death has to be during the commission of the felony and inherently dangerous.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions follow the "proximate cause" rule, where if the death was a foreseeable consequence of the felony, it's felony murder. But if the clerk's action was a justifiable homicide, then the defendant might not be guilty.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The defendant is committing a robbery, which is a felony. During the robbery, the friend is killed by the clerk. The key is whether the clerk's action was a direct response to the felony.

In some cases, courts have held that if the victim (here, the clerk) reacts reasonably to the felony, causing the death of a co-felon, then the other felon can still be held liable under felony murder because the death was a foreseeable result of the robbery.

So in this case, the friend used a toy gun that looked real. The clerk, fearing for his life, shot in self-defense. So the clerk's action was a direct response to the robbery. Therefore, the defendant could be guilty of felony murder because the friend's death was a foreseeable consequence of the robbery.

Looking at the options:

A: guilty of felony murder. That seems possible.

D: guilty because a felon may be convicted of murder of a co-felon. That's also possible, but I think it's more about the felony murder rule.

I: guilty because he was involved in a felony when his friend was killed. That's also a way of stating felony murder.

But wait, option D says a felon can be convicted of murder of a co-felon. I think that's referring to the idea that each co-felon is guilty of the deaths of others in the felony. So in this case, the defendant is a co-felon, and the friend was also a co-felon. So option D might be correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The felony murder rule holds each participant responsible for deaths during the felony, regardless of who actually caused the death. So the clerk's act might be considered a foreseeable consequence, making the defendant guilty under felony murder.

Option A says guilty of felony murder, which would fit.

Option D says guilty because a felon can be convicted of murder of a co-felon. That's more specific, but I think it's a correct statement. So both A and D might seem correct, but I need to see the options.

Looking back, the options are A through J. So A is about felony murder, D is about a felon being convicted of a co-felon's murder, which is a specific application of the felony murder rule.

Another point is that the friend was killed by the clerk, a third party. Some jurisdictions require that the killing be by a co-felon or a law enforcement officer. If the clerk is a victim, maybe it's treated differently. But I think the majority rule is that it's still felony murder because the clerk's actions were a direct response to the felony.

So the defendant would be guilty of felony murder.

Looking at the options, A is guilty of felony murder. D is guilty because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. Which is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn. Option D is more specific, but the correct legal doctrine is felony murder. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm confusing. Let me think: The felony murder rule applies when a death occurs during a felony. The fact that it's a co-felon doesn't change that. So the correct answer would be A: guilty of felony murder.

Alternatively, option D says "guilty because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon." That's a correct statement because under the felony murder rule, each co-felon is guilty of any death that occurs, including other co-felons.

Wait, but in this case, the friend was a co-felon, and the defendant is also a co-felon. So the defendant is guilty of the friend's murder under the felony murder rule.

So both A and D could be correct, but perhaps D is more specific.

Wait, the question is about what the defendant is charged with. The options are about which charge is correct.

Option A says guilty of felony murder. Option D says guilty because a felon can be convicted of murder of a co-felon.

I think both points are correct, but the correct answer is that the defendant is guilty of felony murder, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Some states have a rule that if the killing was done by a third party (not a co-felon or police), then it's not felony murder unless the third party's actions were foreseeable. In this case, the clerk's actions were a direct response to the robbery, so it's foreseeable. So yes, felony murder applies.

So the correct answer should be A: guilty of felony murder.

Another thought: Option D says guilty because a felon can be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. That's a correct statement, but it's more of a general rule. The specific charge here is felony murder, which is a type of murder. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says "guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon." That's actually a correct statement of the law. So if the question is about whether the defendant can be convicted, the answer could be D.

But I think the primary issue is whether the felony murder rule applies. So the answer is A.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: The felony murder rule applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of who causes it, as long as it's a foreseeable result.

In this case, the clerk's action was a foreseeable response to the robbery, so the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

So the correct answer is A.

The scenario involves a defendant and his friend committing a robbery using a toy gun. During the robbery, the clerk, fearing for his life, shoots and kills the friend. The question is whether the defendant can be held guilty of his friend's death under the felony murder rule.

The felony murder rule applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the death is a foreseeable result of that felony. In this case, the robbery is the underlying felony, and the friend's death was a direct response to the robbery. The clerk's action, though justifiable self-defense, was a foreseeable consequence of the robbery. Therefore, the defendant, as a participant in the felony, can be held liable for the friend's death under the felony murder rule.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: guilty of felony murder.** This is correct because the felony murder rule applies to deaths occurring during a felony, even if caused by a third party, as long as the death is a foreseeable result of the felony.
- **D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.** While this statement is true, it is more of a general rule and does not specifically address the application of the felony murder rule in this scenario.
- Other options either misapply the law or fail to address the specific circumstances of the case.

The most precise answer is **A: guilty of felony murder**, as it directly addresses the legal doctrine applicable to the facts.

Answer: A
