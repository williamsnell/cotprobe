Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

The sentence given is: "Some kind people help some endangered species." The example provided defines the predicates as:
- x is endangered (Ex)
- Kx: x is kind
- Px: x is a person
- Sx: x is a species
- Hxy: x helps y

Wait, wait, I think I need to clarify the predicates. Oh, the example says Ex is x is endangered, Kx is kind, Px is person, Sx is species, and Hxy is x helps y. So, I need to make sure I use these correctly.

Let me break down the sentence. "Some kind people" means there exists at least one person who is kind. So in logic terms, that would be an existential quantifier for x, where Kx (x is kind) and Px (x is a person). So something like ∃x (Kx ∧ Px).

Then, "help some endangered species." So there exists some species that is endangered, and the person helps them. So for y, we have Ey (y is endangered) and Sy (y is a species). So ∃y (Ey ∧ Sy). And the helping part is Hxy, which is x helps y.

Putting it all together, the structure would be: There exists an x such that x is a kind person, and there exists a y such that y is an endangered species, and x helps y. So in symbols: ∃x (Kx ∧ Px) ∧ ∃y (Ey ∧ Sy) ∧ Hxy. But wait, in predicate logic, how do we combine these? Oh, right, the entire statement is under the existential quantifiers. So it's more like ∃x ∃y [(Kx ∧ Px) ∧ (Ey ∧ Sy) ∧ Hxy].

Wait, but looking at the options, they might structure it differently. Let me check the options again.

Option A: (∃x)(∃y){[(Kx • Sx) • (Ey • Py)] • Hxy}
Hmm, Kx is kind, Sx is species, so this would mean x is both kind and a species. That doesn't make sense because people are kind, species are the ones being helped. So this seems wrong.

Option B: (∃x){(Kx • Px) • (∃y)[(Ey • Sy) • Hxy]}
This looks better. It says there exists an x who is kind and a person, and for that x, there exists a y that is endangered and a species, and x helps y. So the structure is ∃x (Kx ∧ Px) ∧ ∃y (Ey ∧ Sy ∧ Hxy). That seems correct.

Option C: (∃x)(∃y){[(Kx • Px) • (Ey • Sy)] • Hxy}
This is similar to what I thought earlier. It says there exists x and y such that x is kind and a person, y is endangered and a species, and x helps y. So this is also a possible correct structure.

Option D: (∃x)(∃y){[(Kx • Px) • (Ey • Sy)] ⊃ Hxy}
This uses implication, which would mean if x is kind and a person, and y is endangered and a species, then x helps y. But that's not the same as saying that some x and y exist where x helps y. So this isn't correct because it's stating an implication rather than an existence.

Option E: (∃x)(∃y){[(Kx • Px) • (Ey • Sy)] ⊃ Hxy}
Same as D, just the implication. So incorrect for the same reason.

Option F: (∃x)(∃y){[(Kx • Sx) • (Ey • Py)] • Hyx}
Here, Kx and Sx would mean x is both kind and a species, which is wrong because x is a person. Also, Hyx is y helps x, which is the reverse of what we need. So this is incorrect.

Wait, so now I'm a bit confused between options B and C. Let me think again. The original sentence is "Some kind people help some endangered species." So it's asserting the existence of such people and species, and the helping relationship.

Option B has the structure where for an x that is a kind person, there exists a y that is an endangered species, and x helps y. So it's like: ∃x (Kx ∧ Px) ∧ ∃y (Ey ∧ Sy ∧ Hxy). 

Option C has both x and y existentially quantified together, with all conditions in the same scope. So it's ∃x ∃y [(Kx ∧ Px) ∧ (Ey ∧ Sy) ∧ Hxy].

Are these two logically different? Let me think. In B, the scope of y is within x, meaning for each x, there's a y. But in C, both x and y are bound by the outermost quantifiers, so it's saying there's at least one x and at least one y that satisfy all the conditions together.

Wait, but in the original sentence, it's not necessary that the same x is used for all y. It's just that some x (kind person) helps some y (endangered species). So both B and C seem to capture that.

But wait, in option B, the structure is ∃x (Kx ∧ Px) and then within that, ∃y (Ey ∧ Sy) and Hxy. So it's like, for some x who is a kind person, there exists a y that is an endangered species, and x helps y. That seems correct.

Option C, on the other hand, has both x and y existentially quantified together. So it's saying there exists an x and a y such that x is a kind person, y is an endangered species, and x helps y. Which also seems correct.

Wait, but in the original sentence, "some kind people help some endangered species," does it require that the same x helps the same y? Or is it that each x can have their own y? I think it's the latter. So both B and C would be correct, but perhaps the way the quantifiers are placed makes a difference.

Wait, maybe I should look at the structure of each option more carefully.

Option B: (∃x){(Kx • Px) • (∃y)[(Ey • Sy) • Hxy]}
So this is ∃x (Kx ∧ Px) ∧ ∃y (Ey ∧ Sy ∧ Hxy). Wait no, that's not right. The way it's written is (∃x){(Kx ∧ Px) • (∃y)[(Ey ∧ Sy) • Hxy]}. So the main connective is a conjunction between (Kx ∧ Px) and the inner ∃y. So it's saying there's an x who is kind and a person, and for that same x, there's a y that's an endangered species and x helps y.

Option C is (∃x)(∃y){[(Kx ∧ Px) ∧ (Ey ∧ Sy)] ∧ Hxy}. So this is saying there's an x and a y such that x is kind and a person, y is endangered and a species, and x helps y.

So both B and C are similar, but the way the quantifiers are scoped is different. In B, the y is scoped within the x's quantifier, meaning for each x, there's a y. That would mean that each kind person might help some species, but the original sentence just says that some kind people help some endangered species, not necessarily that each kind person does. So perhaps C is more appropriate because it just says there's at least one x and at least one y that satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but the original sentence is "Some kind people help some endangered species." It doesn't specify how many, just that there exists at least one person and at least one species. So I think both B and C are correct in that sense, but maybe C is the better representation because it's a single existential statement covering both x and y together.

Alternatively, perhaps B is correct because it first asserts the existence of a kind person, and then, given that person, there's an endangered species they help. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider the structure. The sentence is: Some kind people (exist) who help some endangered species (exist). So it's ∃x (Kx ∧ Px) ∧ ∃y (Ey ∧ Sy) ∧ Hxy. But in logic, you can't have two separate existentials like that; instead, they should be combined into a single ∃x ∃y statement.

So the correct way is to have ∃x ∃y [(Kx ∧ Px) ∧ (Ey ∧ Sy) ∧ Hxy], which is exactly what option C is.

Option B, however, has the structure where the inner ∃y is within the scope of the outer ∃x, meaning that for each x, there's a y. But that would imply that each kind person helps some endangered species, which might be a stronger statement than intended. The original sentence doesn't say that every kind person does this, just that some do.

Wait, no, the original sentence says "some kind people help some endangered species." So it's not about all kind people, just that there exists at least one person and at least one species. So perhaps option C is correct because it captures that there's at least one x and at least one y, without implying that every x does something.

So I think option C is the correct answer. Let me double-check the options:

Option C: (∃x)(∃y){[(Kx • Px) • (Ey • Sy)] • Hxy}

Yes, that's the structure I was thinking of. So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The sentence "Some kind people help some endangered species" needs to be translated into predicate logic using the given predicates: 

- \( Kx \): \( x \) is kind  
- \( Px \): \( x \) is a person  
- \( Sx \): \( x \) is a species  
- \( Ex \): \( x \) is endangered  
- \( Hxy \): \( x \) helps \( y \).  

The sentence asserts the existence of at least one kind person (\( Kx \wedge Px \)) and at least one endangered species (\( Ey \wedge Sy \)) such that the kind person helps the endangered species (\( Hxy \)). This requires a single existential quantification over both \( x \) and \( y \), where all conditions are conjoined together under the scope of the quantifiers. 

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: \( (\exists x)(\exists y)\{[(Kx \cdot Sx) \cdot (Ey \cdot Py)] \cdot Hxy\} \)  
   - Incorrect because \( Kx \cdot Sx \) implies \( x \) is both kind and a species, which contradicts the roles of \( x \) (person) and \( y \) (species).

2. **Option B**: \( (\exists x)\{(Kx \cdot Px) \cdot (\exists y)\{[(Ey \cdot Sy) \cdot Hxy]\}\} \)  
   - This structure implies that for a kind person \( x \), there exists an endangered species \( y \) that \( x \) helps. While this is logically correct, it scopes \( y \) within \( x \), which may imply that each kind person helps some species, a stronger statement than intended.

3. **Option C**: \( (\exists x)(\exists y)\{[(Kx \cdot Px) \cdot (Ey \cdot Sy)] \cdot Hxy\} \)  
   - This correctly captures the sentence by asserting the existence of at least one kind person (\( Kx \wedge Px \)) and at least one endangered species (\( Ey \wedge Sy \)) such that the person helps the species (\( Hxy \)). The quantifiers are properly scoped to express the existence of such \( x \) and \( y \) together.

4. **Option D**: \( (\exists x)(\exists y)\{[(Kx \cdot Px) \cdot (Ey \cdot Sy)] \supset Hxy\} \)  
   - Incorrect because it uses implication (\( \supset \)) instead of conjunction, which would mean "if \( x \) is a kind person and \( y \) is an endangered species, then \( x \) helps \( y \)." This does not match the existential claim of the original sentence.

5. **Option E**: \( (\exists x)(\exists y)\{[(Kx \cdot Px) \cdot (Ey \cdot Sy)] \supset Hxy\} \)  
   - Same as Option D and thus incorrect for the same reason.

6. **Option F**: \( (\exists x)(\exists y)\{[(Kx \cdot Sx) \cdot (Ey \cdot Py)] \cdot Hyx\} \)  
   - Incorrect because \( Kx \cdot Sx \) again misrepresents \( x \) as both kind and a species, and \( Hyx \) reverses the helping relationship.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the correct translation because it accurately represents the existence of at least one kind person and at least one endangered species such that the person helps the species, with all conditions properly conjoined under the scope of the existential quantifiers.
