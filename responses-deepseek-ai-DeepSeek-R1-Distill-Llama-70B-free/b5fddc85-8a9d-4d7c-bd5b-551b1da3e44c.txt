Okay, so I've got this problem about mirrors and an object placed between them. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. So there are two mirrors facing each other. One is concave and the other is convex. Both have a radius of 10 cm. They are 20 cm apart. The object is halfway, so 10 cm from each mirror, and it's 3 cm tall.

Wait, the question says the object is 3 cm high. I think that's the height, so when calculating magnification, that's the size we'll consider.

The task is to find the position and size of the final image after reflection first at the convex mirror and then at the concave mirror. So the light first hits the convex mirror, reflects, then hits the concave mirror, and reflects again. The final image is formed after both reflections.

I remember that for mirrors, the radius R is related to the focal length by R = 2f. So for each mirror, the focal length f would be R/2. Since the radius is 10 cm, f is 5 cm for both. But wait, the sign matters. Concave mirrors have a positive focal length when the object is in front, and convex have negative. Or is it the other way around? Oh right, in the standard convention, concave mirrors have f positive when the object is in front, convex have f negative.

Wait, but sometimes it's confusing. Let me make sure. Yes, concave mirrors are converging, so their focal length is positive when the object is in front (real object). Convex mirrors are diverging, so their focal length is considered negative.

So for the convex mirror, f_convex = -5 cm. Concave mirror, f_concave = +5 cm.

The object is placed 10 cm in front of each mirror because the mirrors are 20 cm apart and the object is halfway. Wait, no. Wait, the distance between the mirrors is 20 cm. So from the convex mirror to the object is 10 cm, and the same from the object to the concave mirror.

Wait, perhaps I should model the setup. Let me imagine the two mirrors are facing each other. The convex mirror is on the left, the concave on the right, or vice versa? Actually, I think it doesn't matter which is which for the initial setup, but since the question says the light reflects first at the convex, so the object is in front of the convex, and the concave is behind the object. Or wait, no: the object is halfway between them, so the light from the object hits the convex mirror first, then the reflection from that hits the concave mirror.

Wait, no. Wait, the object is placed halfway between the two mirrors. So each mirror is 10 cm away from the object. But if the mirrors are facing each other, that means the object is in the space between them, right? So the convex mirror is on one end, and the concave on the other. The object is in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the convex mirror as being on the left and the concave on the right, with the object in the center, 10 cm from each.

So the first reflection is off the convex mirror. The object is 10 cm in front of the convex mirror. So the object distance for the convex mirror is 10 cm (u = +10 cm, since it's in front).

Wait, no, wait. The mirrors are 20 cm apart. So the object is 10 cm from each. So for the convex mirror, the object is at u = +10 cm (since it's a real object in front). The convex mirror's radius is 10 cm, so f_convex = -5 cm.

Wait, the formula for mirrors is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is object distance, di is image distance, and f is focal length.

So for the first reflection (convex mirror):

u = object distance = +10 cm (since it's in front)
f = -5 cm

So 1/(-5) = 1/10 + 1/di1
=> 1/di1 = 1/(-5) - 1/10 = (-2/10 - 1/10) = -3/10
So di1 = -10/3 cm ≈ -3.333 cm.

Negative di means the image is virtual and located behind the mirror. So the image formed by the convex mirror is virtual, 3.333 cm behind the mirror. So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror.

Wait, but in our setup, since the convex mirror is on the left, the image being behind it would be towards the concave mirror. But wait, the concave mirror is on the right, so the image is in between the two mirrors? Because the mirrors are 20 cm apart. So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror, which would place it at 20 cm - 3.333 cm = 16.666 cm in front of the concave mirror. No, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of coordinate system.

Let me think of the convex mirror at position 0, the concave at position 20 cm. The object is at 10 cm. So the image formed by the convex mirror is at di1 = -3.333 cm. So it's 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror, which is at position 0. So the image is at position -3.333 cm. But that's to the left of the convex mirror. Wait, that can't be right because the object is at 10 cm, facing the convex mirror.

Wait, maybe I got the sign conventions wrong. Let me double-check.

In the mirror equation, for a convex mirror, f is negative. The object is in front of the mirror, so u is positive.

So 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where v is the image distance.

So for the convex mirror:

f = -5 cm, u = +10 cm.

1/v = 1/f - 1/u = (1/(-5)) - (1/10) = (-2/10 -1/10 )= -3/10 → v = -10/3 ≈ -3.333 cm.

Negative image distance means the image is behind the mirror (virtual). So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror.

But wait, the convex mirror is at position 0. So the image is at position 0 - 3.333 cm = -3.333 cm. That's to the left of the convex mirror, which is facing towards the concave mirror. But that would mean the image is on the opposite side of where the object is, which doesn't make sense because the object is between the two mirrors. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the mirrors are facing each other. So the convex mirror's reflecting surface faces towards the concave mirror and the object. So when the object is placed in front of the convex mirror (at 10 cm), the image is formed behind it, which is on the same side as where the concave mirror is. So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror, which is in the direction towards the concave mirror.

Wait, no. Wait, the concave mirror is on the other side, 20 cm away. So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror, so towards the concave mirror. So the position of this image would be at 0 + (-3.333) = -3.333 cm? Hmm, perhaps I should model it more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to place the convex mirror at position x=0, facing towards positive x, and the concave mirror at x=20 cm, also facing towards positive x. So the object is at x=10 cm, in front of the convex mirror (so convex mirror's front is at x=0). So the image formed by the convex mirror would be at x = 0 - 3.333 cm = -3.333 cm. That's behind the convex mirror, which is facing towards the concave mirror. So the image is on the opposite side of the convex mirror from the concave mirror. That would be a problem because then the concave mirror wouldn't see that image as its object. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the object is in front of the convex mirror, the image is formed behind the mirror. So the image is on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. So the convex mirror is at x=0, the object at x=10 cm. The image is at x= -3.333 cm. That's to the left of the convex mirror, away from the concave mirror (which is at x=20 cm). So the light would reflect off the convex mirror and form an image that's behind it, which is on the same side as where the concave mirror isn't. So that can't be, because the concave mirror is at x=20 cm, so the image is at x=-3.333 cm. So the concave mirror is at x=20 cm, and the image is at x=-3.333 cm, which is 23.333 cm away. But that's not possible because the two mirrors are only 20 cm apart. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should model the two mirrors as both facing each other, so for the convex mirror, the object is on one side, and the concave mirror is on the other. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the object is placed in between the two mirrors, each 10 cm away. So the object is in front of both mirrors? That can't be, because the mirrors are facing each other. So the object must be in front of one and behind the other. Wait, no, because if the mirrors are facing each other, the object is placed in the space between them, so it's in front of both. No, that doesn't make sense because each mirror's front is facing each other. So perhaps the object is placed in front of the convex mirror, which is facing the concave mirror.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider that the object is placed between the two mirrors, 10 cm from each. The convex mirror is on the left, concave on the right, each 10 cm from the object.

So the first reflection: the object is in front of the convex mirror (so u = +10 cm for the convex mirror). The convex mirror's f is -5 cm. Using the mirror formula:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/di = 1/f - 1/do → 1/di = (1/(-5)) - (1/10) = (-1/5 -1/10) = -3/10 → di = -10/3 ≈ -3.333 cm.

So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror, which is in the direction opposite to the object, meaning towards the left of the convex mirror. But the concave mirror is on the right side, so the image is on the left of the convex mirror. So that image would not be in front of the concave mirror. Hmm, perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think: the convex mirror is at x=0. The object is at x=10 cm. The concave mirror is at x=20 cm. So the image formed by the convex mirror is at x= -3.333 cm, which is behind the convex mirror, to the left of it. But the concave mirror is at x=20 cm, so the image is 23.333 cm away from the concave mirror. But the concave mirror is facing towards x=0, so it's front is facing the convex mirror. So the image at x=-3.333 cm is not in front of the concave mirror; it's behind it. So the concave mirror can't see that image as its object. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mirrors are arranged so that the object is in front of both. Hmm, but that's not possible if they're facing each other. Alternatively, perhaps the convex mirror is on the right and the concave on the left. Wait, perhaps I should reverse their positions.

Let me try again. Let's say the concave mirror is on the left at x=0, and the convex mirror on the right at x=20 cm. The object is at x=10 cm.

So the object is 10 cm in front of the concave mirror (since it's at x=10 cm, and concave is at x=0 → u = 10 cm). Wait, no, because the concave mirror's front is at x=0, facing towards positive x. So the object is at x=10 cm, which is in front of the concave mirror. So for the concave mirror, u = 10 cm, f = +5 cm.

But wait, the question says the reflection happens first at the convex mirror. So the object is in front of the convex mirror, which is on the right at x=20 cm. So the object is at x=10 cm, so u = 20 cm -10 cm = 10 cm in front of the convex mirror. Wait, no, the convex mirror is at x=20 cm, and the object is at x=10 cm. So the distance from the object to the convex mirror is 10 cm. So u = +10 cm.

So the first reflection is at the convex mirror: f_convex = -5 cm, u = +10 cm.

So again, 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/(-5) = 1/10 + 1/di → 1/di = (-1/5) - (1/10) = (-2/10 -1/10) = -3/10 → di = -10/3 ≈ -3.333 cm.

So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror, which is at x=20 cm. So the image position is x = 20 cm - 3.333 cm = 16.666 cm.

Wait, but that's the position relative to the convex mirror being at x=20 cm. So the image is at x=16.666 cm, which is between the object (x=10 cm) and the convex mirror (x=20 cm). So that image is now facing the concave mirror, which is at x=0.

Wait, no, because the concave mirror is at x=0, and the image is at x=16.666 cm, which is 16.666 cm in front of the concave mirror. Because from the concave mirror at x=0, the image is at x=16.666 cm, so the distance between them is 16.666 cm. So now, this image acts as the object for the concave mirror.

So for the concave mirror, the object is at u = +16.666 cm (since it's in front of the concave mirror). The concave mirror has f = +5 cm.

Using mirror formula again: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/5 = 1/16.666 + 1/di2.

Let me compute 1/16.666. 16.666 is 50/3, so 1/(50/3)=3/50=0.06.

So 1/di2 = 1/5 - 3/50 = (10/50 - 3/50) =7/50 → di2=50/7 ≈7.142 cm.

Positive di2 means the image is real and in front of the concave mirror. So the final image is at x=0 +7.142 cm =7.142 cm in front of the concave mirror.

Wait, but the concave mirror is at x=0, so the image is at x=7.142 cm.

Wait, but the question is asking for the position relative to which mirror? The answer options talk about "in front of the mirror" without specifying which one. Hmm, but the options mention "the mirror", perhaps referring to the concave mirror, since that's the second one. Or maybe the convex mirror?

Wait, the problem says that the first reflection is at the convex, then the concave. So the final image is formed after reflecting off the concave mirror. So the position is relative to the concave mirror, which is at x=0. So the image is 7.142 cm in front of the concave mirror.

Wait, but the answer options have options like 6.37 cm, 7 cm, etc. 7.142 is approximately 7.14 cm, but none of the options exactly match that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me redo the concave mirror calculation.

f =5 cm, u=16.666 cm =50/3 cm.

So 1/di = 1/f - 1/u = 1/5 - 3/50 = (10/50 - 3/50 )=7/50 → di=50/7 ≈7.1428 cm.

So approximately 7.14 cm in front of the concave mirror.

Looking at the options, option E says 7 cm behind, F says 7 cm in front and twice the size. G says 7 cm front and 1/12. Option B is 6.37 front, same size. Hmm, none match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the first reflection.

Wait another thought: perhaps the object's position relative to the convex mirror is different. The setup says the mirrors are 20 cm apart, and the object is halfway, so 10 cm from each. So if the convex mirror is at x=0, the object is at x=10 cm, and the concave mirror is at x=20 cm.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered the convex mirror at x=20, that might have been the issue. Let me think again with the convex mirror at x=0, object at x=10, concave at x=20.

Convex mirror: f =-5 cm, u=10 cm.

1/f = 1/u +1/di → 1/(-5)=1/10 +1/di → 1/di= -1/5 -1/10 =-3/10 → di=-10/3 ≈-3.333 cm.

So the image is 3.333 cm behind the convex mirror, which is at x=0. So the image is at x=0 -3.333= -3.333 cm. Wait, that's to the left of the convex mirror. But the concave mirror is at x=20 cm, so the image is at x=-3.333 cm, which is 23.333 cm in front of the concave mirror. So the distance from the concave mirror is 20 - (-3.333)=23.333 cm? Wait, no, the image is at x=-3.333 cm, and the concave mirror
