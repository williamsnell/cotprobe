Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the monthly cost of owning a home. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the man buys a house and lot for $35,000. He pays $12,000 down, so he must be borrowing the rest. Let me calculate the mortgage amount. $35,000 minus $12,000 down is $23,000. So the mortgage is $23,000.

The mortgage is at 6% interest and is due in 10 years. Hmm, I remember that mortgage payments are usually calculated using an amortization formula, but maybe for this problem, they just want the annual interest portion. Or perhaps it's a simple interest loan? Wait, the problem says it's a mortgage due in 10 years, so it's probably an amortizing loan, but I'm not sure if I need to calculate the monthly mortgage payment here. Wait, the question is about the total cost per month of owning the home, so I think I need to include the mortgage payment, but maybe they're simplifying it by just using the interest part each year.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "allowing 4% interest on his investment, and 2% depreciation on the house valued at $25,000." Hmm, so maybe the 4% is his expected return on investment, and the 2% is depreciation. So perhaps his total cost includes not just the mortgage interest but also other expenses, and then we calculate the annual cost and then divide by 12 for monthly.

Wait, the question is about the cost per month of owning the home. So all the expenses, including mortgage, taxes, insurance, repairs, etc., need to be summed up on an annual basis and then divided by 12.

Let me list all the annual expenses:

1. Mortgage interest: The mortgage is $23,000 at 6% per annum. So the annual interest would be 0.06 * 23,000 = $1,380.

Wait, but wait, if it's a mortgage, the payment each month includes both principal and interest. But the problem might be simplifying by just considering the interest part as an expense each year. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the annual mortgage payment and include that. Hmm, but the problem says "borrowing the balance on a 6% mortgage", so maybe they're considering the interest as an expense each year. Let me think: for a 6% mortgage on $23,000, the annual interest would be 0.06 * 23,000 = $1,380. But when you pay mortgage each month, you pay both principal and interest. But since the problem doesn't specify whether to include principal repayment as part of the cost, but given that it's asking about the cost of owning, perhaps the interest is the only part considered as an expense, while the principal is part of the investment. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here. Let me see how other expenses are treated.

Other expenses:

- Real-estate taxes: $240 per year.
- Water tax: $30 per year.
- Insurance premiums: $70 per year.
- Repairs: $120 per year.

Then, allowing 4% interest on his investment. His investment is the down payment, which is $12,000. So 4% of 12,000 is 0.04 * 12,000 = $480 per year. So that's an expected return, so perhaps that's an opportunity cost he incurs each year.

Depreciation is 2% on the house valued at $25,000. So 0.02 * 25,000 = $500 per year. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, but in this context, maybe it's being considered as an annual cost.

Wait, no, wait: for tax purposes, depreciation reduces taxable income, but here, the problem seems to be considering all these factors as annual costs. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's see.

So let me list all the annual expenses:

1. Mortgage interest: $1,380.
2. Real-estate taxes: $240.
3. Water tax: $30.
4. Insurance: $70.
5. Repairs: $120.
6. Opportunity cost (4% on $12,000): $480.
7. Depreciation (2% on $25,000): $500.

Wait, but wait: is the depreciation an expense here? Because in financial calculations, depreciation is an expense that represents the using up of the asset's value over time. So perhaps it's included as an annual cost.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the depreciation as a loss in value, which affects the overall cost of ownership. So perhaps we should include it.

So adding all these up:

$1,380 (mortgage interest) + $240 (taxes) + $30 (water tax) + $70 (insurance) + $120 (repairs) + $480 (opportunity cost) + $500 (depreciation) = Let's compute that.

Let me add them step by step:

1,380 + 240 = 1,620

1,620 +30=1,650

1,650 +70=1,720

1,720 +120=1,840

1,840 +480=2,320

2,320 +500=2,820.

So total annual cost is $2,820.

Wait, but wait a second: the mortgage is $23,000 at 6% over 10 years. If I pay each month, the monthly payment would be calculated using the present value of an annuity formula. Let me see if that's necessary.

Wait, the problem says the mortgage is due in 10 years, so perhaps it's a balloon payment, but more likely, it's an amortizing loan where each payment includes principal and interest. If that's the case, then the annual mortgage expense would be the sum of the monthly payments times 12, but that includes both principal and interest.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the interest as an expense each year, and not the principal part. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says, "borrowing the balance on a 6% mortgage due in 10 years." So perhaps it's an interest-only loan for 10 years, meaning that each year, he pays only the interest, which is 6% of $23,000, so $1,380 per year, and then at the end of 10 years, he pays the principal. If that's the case, then the annual mortgage cost is $1,380.

But if it's an amortizing loan, then the annual payment would be higher than just the interest. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the intended approach is to just take the interest each year as the mortgage expense.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the annual mortgage payment (P&I) and include that as an expense.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the annual payment would be higher because it includes both principal and interest. So perhaps I should calculate the monthly mortgage payment and then sum it up to annual.

Let me try that approach.

The formula for monthly payment on an amortizing loan is:

M = P [ i(1+i)^n ] / [ (1+i)^n - 1 ]

Where:
P = principal loan amount = $23,000
i = monthly interest rate = 6% per annum / 12 = 0.005
n = number of payments = 10 years * 12 months = 120.

So plugging in the numbers:

M = 23,000 * (0.005*(1+0.005)^120) / ((1+0.005)^120 - 1)

Let me compute (1+0.005)^120 first. Let me approximate it. The present value factor for 120 periods at 0.5% per period.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula step by step.

But alternatively, perhaps using a financial calculator approach:

Compute (1.005)^120. Let me compute that:

Since 1.005^120 is approximately e^(0.005*120) = e^0.6 ≈ 1.8221, but more accurately, using a calculator, 1.005^120 ≈ 1.8194.

So numerator: 0.005 * 1.8194 ≈ 0.009097.

Denominator: 1.8194 - 1 = 0.8194.

So M ≈ 23,000 * (0.009097 / 0.8194) ≈ 23,000 * 0.01109 ≈ 23,000 * 0.01109 ≈ Let's compute 23,000 * 0.011 = 253, and 23,000 * 0.00009 = 2.07, so total approx 253 + 2.07 ≈ 255.07 per month.

Wait, that's approximately $255 per month. So annual mortgage payment would be 255 * 12 = $3,060 per year.

Hmm, but earlier I thought that if it's an interest-only loan, the annual interest would be $1,380. But if it's an amortizing loan, the annual payment is $3,060.

But the problem states that the mortgage is "due in 10 years", which could imply that it's an amortizing loan, where the principal is paid over 10 years, so each payment includes principal and interest.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a balloon payment, where only interest is paid each year, and the principal is due at the end. But the way the question is phrased, it's not clear. Hmm.

But the problem is asking for the cost per month of owning the home, so perhaps the mortgage payment (including principal and interest) is part of that cost. So maybe the correct approach is to calculate the monthly mortgage payment and include that as part of the monthly costs, along with other expenses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the interest part as an expense, and the principal payment as a return of capital, not an expense. That could make sense because, in accounting, interest is an expense, while principal repayment is not.

But in personal finance, when calculating the cost of owning a home, people often include the mortgage payment (P&I) as part of their monthly expenses.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again.

The problem lists several expenses: real-estate taxes, water tax, insurance, repairs. Then it mentions allowing 4% interest on his investment and 2% depreciation. So perhaps the 4% is the opportunity cost of his down payment, and the 2% is depreciation, both to be included as annual costs.

In that case, the mortgage interest is an expense, so $1,380 per year.

Alternatively, if the mortgage payment includes both principal and interest, then the annual payment would be higher, but the problem doesn't specify whether to include the principal part as an expense. So perhaps the intended approach is to just include the interest part.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to consider all the expenses except the mortgage payment, and then add the mortgage interest as an expense, along with other costs.

Let me proceed with that approach, as perhaps that's what the problem expects.

So annual expenses:

- Mortgage interest: 6% of $23,000 = $1,380.

Other expenses:

- Real estate taxes: $240.

- Water tax: $30.

- Insurance: $70.

- Repairs: $120.

Opportunity cost (4% on $12,000): $480.

Depreciation (2% on $25,000): $500.

Adding all these together: 1,380 + 240 + 30 +70 +120 +480 +500.

Let me compute:

1,380 + 240 = 1,620.

1,620 +30=1,650.

1,650 +70=1,720.

1,720 +120=1,840.

1,840 +480=2,320.

2,320 +500=2,820.

So total annual cost is $2,820.

Now, to find the monthly cost, divide by 12: 2,820 / 12 = 235.

Wait, 2,820 divided by 12: 12 * 235 = 2,820.

So that would be $235 per month.

Looking at the options, option I is $235 per month. So is that the answer?

Wait, but hold on. Did I include the mortgage interest correctly? Because if the mortgage payment each month includes principal and interest, then perhaps I should have included the total mortgage payment as an expense instead of just the interest. Let me recalculate that approach.

If the mortgage is an amortizing loan, then the annual mortgage payment is $3,060, as I calculated earlier. So then, the annual expenses would include $3,060 (mortgage P&I) instead of $1,380 (interest only).

Let me recalculate the total annual cost with that.

So:

Mortgage P&I: $3,060.

Real estate taxes: $240.

Water tax: $30.

Insurance: $70.

Repairs: $120.

Opportunity cost: $480.

Depreciation: $500.

Adding these up: 3,060 +240=3,300.

3,300+30=3,330.

3,330+70=3,400.

3,400+120=3,520.

3,520+480=4,000.

4,000+500=4,500.

So total annual cost would be $4,500. Then monthly would be 4,500 / 12 = 375.

But that's not among the answer choices. So perhaps that's not the intended approach.

Wait, but perhaps I was wrong in including the opportunity cost and depreciation. Because sometimes, when calculating the cost of owning a home, the opportunity cost (4%) and depreciation are considered as part of the cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to include the mortgage interest as an expense, along with the other expenses, and then calculate the total.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's see.

Another approach: the problem might consider all the annual expenses except the mortgage payment, and then add the mortgage interest. So perhaps the annual cost is:

- Real estate taxes: $240.

- Water tax: $30.

- Insurance: $70.

- Repairs: $120.

- Mortgage interest: $1,380.

- Opportunity cost on investment (4% of $12,000): $480.

- Depreciation (2% of $25,000): $500.

Adding these together gives $2,820 per year, which is $235 per month, as before.

So that would be option I: $235.

But wait, I'm seeing that option I is $235. So that's an option.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the 4% interest on investment is not an expense, but rather the expected return. So perhaps the problem is considering that as a cost, meaning that the owner could have earned 4% on his $12,000 elsewhere, so it's an opportunity cost.

Similarly, depreciation is a non-cash expense but is considered here as a cost.

So I think including both is correct as per the problem statement.

So the total annual cost is $2,820, leading to a monthly cost of $235, which is option I.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $210 per month

B: $265 per month

C: $275 per month

D: $200 per month

E: $250 per month

F: $220 per month

G: $255 per month

H: $245 per month

I: $235 per month

J: $230 per month

So option I is $235, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other expenses. The annual expenses I considered were:

- Mortgage interest: $1,380.

- Taxes: $240.

- Water tax: $30.

- Insurance: $70.

- Repairs: $120.

- Opportunity cost: $480.

- Depreciation: $500.

Yes, that's all the expenses mentioned.

Wait, but let me think again: the problem says "cost per month of owning the home." So perhaps the mortgage payment itself is part of the cost, not just the interest. Because the mortgage payment includes principal and interest, and that's a cash outlay each month.

So maybe I should calculate the mortgage payment (P&I) per year and include that as an expense.

Earlier, I calculated the annual mortgage payment as approximately $3,060.

So let me include that in the annual cost instead of the interest-only $1,380.

So annual expenses would be:

Mortgage P&I: $3,060.

Real estate taxes: $240.

Water tax: $30.

Insurance: $70.

Repairs: $120.

Opportunity cost: $480.

Depreciation: $500.

Adding up: 3,060 + 240 = 3,300.

3,300 +30=3,330.

3,330+70=3,400.

3,400+120=3,520.

3,520+480=4,000.

4,000+500=4,500.

So total annual cost is $4,500, which is $375 per month. But that's not an option, so that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the interest part of the mortgage, not the principal, as an expense, because the principal is part of the investment. So then the correct approach is to include the interest as an expense, and not the principal.

Therefore, the annual cost is $2,820, leading to $235 per month, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not include the opportunity cost and depreciation as expenses. Let me see.

If I exclude opportunity cost and depreciation, then the annual cost would be:

Mortgage interest: $1,380.

Taxes: $240.

Water tax: $30.

Insurance: $70.

Repairs: $120.

Total: 1,380 + 240 = 1,620.

1,620 +30=1,650.

1,650 +70=1,720.

1,720 +120=1,840.

So $1,840 per year, which is $153.33 per month. That's way below the options given, so that can't be right.

So perhaps including the opportunity cost and depreciation is correct, leading to $235 per month.

Wait, but another perspective: the problem says "allowing 4% interest on his investment, and 2% depreciation on the house valued at $25,000." So perhaps this is an alternative way of computing the annual cost, instead of including the mortgage interest.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to structure it differently.

The total cost of owning the home would include all the expenses paid each year, plus the opportunity cost of the down payment, plus depreciation.

So, the expenses are:

- Mortgage interest: $1,380.

- Real estate taxes
