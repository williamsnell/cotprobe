Okay, so I've got this problem about a single slit diffraction. Hmm, I remember that diffraction has to do with the bending of light around an obstacle or through a slit. Fraunhofer diffraction is when you observe the pattern far away from the slit, right? So the question is about the minima in that pattern.

The problem says it's illuminated by red light with a wavelength of 650 nm. Oh wait, I should probably convert that to meters for calculations. So 650 nm is 650e-9 meters, which is 6.5e-7 m. I'll write that down.

The first order minima have an angular distance theta of 5 degrees from the optic axis. So theta is 5 degrees. I need to find the slit width. I think the formula for single-slit diffraction minima is a sine theta equals m lambda over the slit width. Let me recall: the condition for minima is a* sin(theta) = m lambda, where a is the slit width, m is the order, and lambda is the wavelength.

Wait, m is the order. So first order means m=1. So plugging in, sin(theta) = lambda/(a) * m. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get it straight. The formula is a * sin(theta) = m lambda. Yeah, that's right. So a = (m lambda) / sin(theta).

So I need to compute a using the given values. Let's plug in the numbers. m is 1, lambda is 6.5e-7 meters, theta is 5 degrees. I'll compute sin(5 degrees) first. Let me convert 5 degrees to radians? No, my calculator can handle degrees. So sin(5°) is approximately, let me think, what's the approximate value. I know that sin(0)=0, sin(30)=0.5, so 5 degrees is small. Maybe around 0.087. Let me check. Actually, using calculator: sin(5 degrees) is about 0.08716.

So a = (1 * 6.5e-7 m) / 0.08716.

Let me compute that. 6.5e-7 divided by 0.08716. Let's see, 6.5e-7 is 6.5 x 10^-7. 0.08716 is roughly 8.716e-2.

So 6.5e-7 / 8.716e-2 = (6.5 / 8.716) * 1e-5. Let me compute 6.5 divided by 8.716. Hmm, 8.716 is approximately 8.7. 6.5/8.7 is about 0.747. So 0.747e-5 meters. Because 1e-5 meters is 1e-3 mm, since 1e-3 m is 1 mm. Wait, 1e-5 m is 0.00001 m, which is 10^-3 mm. Oh wait, 1 m is 1000 mm. So 1e-3 m is 1 mm. So 0.747e-5 m is 7.47e-6 m, which is 0.00747 mm. Wait, no, wait another way: 1e-5 m is 1e-3 mm. So 0.747e-5 m is 0.747 * 1e-5 m = 7.47e-6 m. To convert to millimeters, since 1m=1e3 mm, 7.47e-6 m * (1e3 mm /1 m) = 7.47e-3 mm. So approximately 7.47e-3 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.45 ×10^-3 mm, which is very close to my calculation. Hmm. So I think the answer is C.

Wait, but wait a minute, I should make sure I didn't mess up any steps. Let me recheck.

Another approach: Let me compute a = (m lambda) / sin(theta). m=1, lambda=650e-9 m, sin(theta)=sin(5)= approx 0.08716.

So a = (650e-9) / 0.08716.

Compute 650e-9 = 6.5e-7. 6.5e-7 / 0.08716.

Let me compute 6.5 / 0.08716 = approximately 74.5. Because 0.08716 *74 is about 6.46, which is close to 6.5. So 74.5.

So 74.5e-7 meters? Wait, no. Wait, 6.5e-7 divided by 0.08716 is (6.5 / 0.08716) * 1e-7 / 1. Because 1e-7 is from 6.5e-7.

Wait, 6.5e-7 / 0.08716 = (6.5 / 0.08716) * 1e-7.

6.5 / 0.08716 is approximately 74.5.

So 74.5 * 1e-7 = 7.45e-6 meters, which is 7.45e-3 mm. So that's 7.45 × 10^-3 mm, which is option C.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be C.

To determine the width of the slit, we use the formula for single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction minima:

\[
a \sin(\theta) = m \lambda
\]

Here:
- \( m = 1 \) (first-order minima),
- \( \lambda = 650 \, \text{nm} = 650 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 6.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \),
- \( \theta = 5^\circ \).

Rearranging for \( a \), the slit width:

\[
a = \frac{m \lambda}{\sin(\theta)}
\]

The sine of \( 5^\circ \) is approximately \( \sin(5^\circ) \approx 0.08716 \). Substituting the values:

\[
a = \frac{1 \cdot 6.5 \times 10^{-7}}{0.08716}
\]

First, calculate \( 6.5 \times 10^{-7} / 0.08716 \):

\[
6.5 \times 10^{-7} / 0.08716 \approx 7.47 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert to millimeters (\( 1 \, \text{m} = 10^3 \, \text{mm} \)):

\[
7.47 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 7.47 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mm}
\]

This matches option **C: \( 7.45 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mm} \)**, which is the closest to the calculated value.

Answer: C
