Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about rheumatoid arthritis, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question is asking which of the options A through J is true about rheumatoid arthritis. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: It is always associated with psoriasis. Hmm, wait, isn't psoriasis more linked to psoriatic arthritis? I thought rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a different condition, though they can sometimes present with similar symptoms. So A is probably false because RA isn't always with psoriasis.

Option B: Caused by uric acid crystals. No, that's gout. Gout is caused by urate crystals depositing in joints, leading to sudden, severe attacks. RA is an autoimmune disease, so B is incorrect.

Option C: It's an oligoarthropathy. Oligo means few, so oligoarthritis is when only a few joints are affected. But RA is typically a polyarthritis, affecting many small and large joints. So C is probably false.

Option D: Heberden's nodes are a feature. Wait, Heberden's nodes are those bony enlargements at the fingertips, right? I think those are more common in osteoarthritis, especially in the distal interphalangeal joints. RA usually affects the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints, leading to things like swan neck deformity or Boutonniere. So D might be false.

Option E: Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of cases. I'm a bit confused here. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that can be present in RA, but I remember that it's not in all cases. Wait, I think about 70-80% of RA patients are rheumatoid factor positive, especially in more severe cases. But there's also something called seronegative RA where it's not present. So E says 25%, which seems too low. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the general population or something else, but I'm not sure. I'll have to think more on this.

Option F: It's a non-inflammatory condition. No way. RA is definitely inflammatory; it's characterized by inflammation in the synovium leading to joint destruction. So F is false.

Option G: High calcium levels are common. I don't think so. High calcium (hypercalcemia) can be linked to other conditions like hyperparathyroidism or malignancy. RA might actually be associated with osteoporosis due to chronic inflammation, but not high calcium. So G is probably false.

Option H: It's infectious arthritis. No, infectious would be like septic arthritis from bacteria or a virus. RA is autoimmune, not caused by an infection. So H is wrong.

Option I: Predominantly affects lower limbs. Hmm, RA tends to affect hands and feet, but more symmetrically. Often the small joints of the hands and wrists are involved. Lower limbs might be affected, but I don't think it's predominant. So I might be false.

Option J: Anemia is common. Yes, I remember that anemia of chronic disease is common in RA. The body's chronic inflammation can lead to anemia. So J sounds correct.

Wait, let me go back to option E. If 25% have rheumatoid factor, that seems low. But I recall that while most RA patients are positive, not all are. Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, no—rheumatoid factor can also be present in other conditions, like Sjögren's or lupus. And some RA patients don't have it. So perhaps E is incorrect if it's saying only 25% have it. I think the majority do; maybe around 70-80% of RA patients are RF positive. So E is false.

So looking back, J says anemia is common, which aligns with what I remember about RA. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, any other options I might have mixed up? Let me double-check D again. Heberden's nodes are in osteoarthritis, whereas RA has other deformities. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is J: Anaemia is a common finding.

To determine which statement is true about rheumatoid arthritis (RA), let's analyze each option:

- **A**: Incorrect. RA is not always associated with psoriasis; psoriasis is more commonly linked to psoriatic arthritis.
- **B**: Incorrect. Uric acid crystal deposition causes gout, not RA, which is an autoimmune disease.
- **C**: Incorrect. RA is typically a polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, not an oligoarthropathy.
- **D**: Incorrect. Heberden's nodes are characteristic of osteoarthritis, not RA.
- **E**: Incorrect. Rheumatoid factor is present in approximately 70-80% of RA cases, not just 25%.
- **F**: Incorrect. RA is an inflammatory condition, not non-inflammatory.
- **G**: Incorrect. High calcium levels are not common in RA; chronic inflammation may lead to osteoporosis instead.
- **H**: Incorrect. RA is autoimmune, not caused by an infection.
- **I**: Incorrect. RA often affects small joints in the hands and feet, not predominantly the lower limbs.
- **J**: Correct. Anemia, particularly anemia of chronic disease, is a common finding in RA due to chronic inflammation.

The correct answer is **J**: Anaemia is a common finding.
