Okay, so I've got this problem about lactic acid and making a buffer solution. Hmm, I remember buffer solutions are made by mixing a weak acid with its conjugate base. In this case, lactic acid is the weak acid, and sodium lactate is the conjugate base. 

The problem has three parts: (a) finding the pH of the buffer, (b) the change after adding sodium hydroxide, and (c) the pH when that same amount of NaOH is added to pure water. 

Starting with part (a). I think I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Oh wait, but wait, the activity coefficients are given. Oh right, because the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in terms of activities might be different. 

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is usually written as pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). But when activities are considered, I think it's modified. Oh right, because activity a = γ*[concentration]. So the equation becomes pH = pKa + log( (γ_A [A-]) / (γ_H [HA]) ) ). But wait, wait. Lactic acid is a weak acid, so it's HA dissociating into H+ and A-. Sodium lactate is the salt, which provides the A- ions. 

So for the buffer solution, the activity of H+ would be based on the activities of A- and HA. Let me write down the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly considering activities. 

The equation should be pH = pKa + log( (a_A-) / (a_HA) ) ). And the activity of A- is γ * [A-], and activity of HA is just [HA], since HA is a neutral molecule and its activity coefficient is approximately 1 (but wait, the problem says activity coefficients for each univalent ion is 0.65. So ions like Na+ and lactate- have γ=0.65. But the undissociated lactic acid (HA) is a neutral molecule, so its activity is just [HA], since activity coefficients for neutral species are close to 1, and the problem says to take water as unit activity. So perhaps I can neglect γ for HA.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in terms of activities becomes:

pH = pKa + log( (γ [A-]) / [HA] )

Wait, no. Because the activity of A- is γ * [A-], but HA is neutral, so activity is [HA]. So the ratio is (γ [A-]) / [HA]. So log part is log( (γ [A-]) / [HA] ).

But wait, the problem statement says the activity coefficient of each univalent ion is 0.65 throughout. So for A- (lactate), γ is 0.65. What about H+? H+ is also a univalent ion, so its activity coefficient is 0.65 as well? Hmm, but in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the H+ activity is accounted for in the pH measurement. So when using the equation with activities, the pH is in the activity sense. 

Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me think again. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation when considering activities is:

pH = pKa' + log( [A-] / [HA] )

But pKa' is the pKa in terms of activities. Alternatively, the correct approach is to consider that the dissociation is HA ⇌ H+ + A-, and the thermodynamic expression is:

Ka = (a_H+ * a_A-) / a_HA

Since a_HA ≈ [HA], because it's a neutral molecule, then:

Ka = (a_H+ * γ_A- [A-]) ) / [HA]

So rearranging, a_H+ = Ka * [HA] / (γ_A- [A-])

Taking log:

log a_H+ = log Ka + log([HA]/(γ_A- [A-]))

But a_H+ is the activity, so pH = - log a_H+ = - (log Ka + log([HA]/(γ_A- [A-])) )

Which simplifies to pH = pKa + log (γ_A- [A-]/[HA] )

Wait, because pKa = -log Ka, so:

pH = pKa + log( [A-] * γ_A- / [HA] )

So that's the correct form. So the equation becomes pH = pKa + log( (γ [A-]) / [HA] )

Wait, so the log term is multiplied by the activity coefficient of A-.

So now I can compute this.

Given data: Ka for lactic acid is 1.4e-4. So pKa is log(1/(1.4e-4)) → let me calculate that. Wait, pKa = -log(1.4e-4). Let's compute that.

Log(1.4) is about 0.1461, so log(1.4e-4) is log(1.4) + log(1e-4) → 0.1461 -4 = -3.8539. So pKa is 3.854.

The solution is made by adding 1.00 mole of lactic acid (HA) and 0.80 mole of sodium lactate (which gives A-) to 1 kg of water. So the total mass is 1 kg, so assuming the density is roughly 1 kg/L, but wait, not necessarily. Wait, 1 kg water is about 1 L, but when you add 1 mole HA and 0.8 mole NaA, does that significantly change the volume? Maybe, but the problem probably assumes that the total volume is approximately 1 L. So the concentrations are [HA] ≈ 1.00 M, [A-] ≈ 0.80 M.

So substituting into the equation:

pH = 3.854 + log( (0.65 * 0.80) / 1.00 )

Compute (0.65 * 0.8) = 0.52.

So log(0.52) is approximately -0.284. So pH = 3.854 - 0.284 ≈ 3.570.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate log(0.52) more accurately. Let's see, log(5)=0.69897, log(5.2)=0.7160; wait, 0.52 is 5.2e-1. So log(5.2e-1) = log(5.2) -1 → 0.7160 -1 = -0.284. So yes, that's correct.

So pH would be about 3.854 - 0.284 = 3.570. So approximately 3.57.

Looking at the options, part (a) is the first value. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 3.47,...

Option C: 3.87,...

Option E: 3.07,...

Option G: 3.57,...

Wait, option G's first value is 3.57. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait, I might have missed something. Oh, the problem says 1 kg of water, so the solution's mass is 1 kg plus the moles of HA and NaA. Wait, moles to grams: lactic acid's molar mass is about 90 g/mol (CH3CH(OH)COOH). So 1 mole is 90g, 0.8 mole is 72g. So total added is 162g, making the total solution about 1162g, approximately 1.162 kg. Wait, so the volume would be 1.162 kg / density. But if the density is about 1 g/mL, then the volume is 1.162 L. Therefore, the concentrations would be [HA] = 1.00 / 1.162 ≈ 0.861 M, [A-] = 0.80 / 1.162 ≈ 0.688 M.

Hmm, that changes things. So I think I made a mistake by assuming the volume is 1 L; the actual volume is a bit higher, so the concentrations are a bit lower.

So let's recalculate.

Moles HA: 1.00 mol, moles A-: 0.80 mol.

Mass of solution: 1 kg (water) + 1.00 * 90g + 0.8 * 90g? Wait, sodium lactate is NaC3H5O3. Its molar mass is about 112 g/mol (Na:23, C3H5O3: 89). So moles NaA is 0.80, mass is 0.8 * 112 = 89.6g. Moles lactic acid (HA) is 1.00, so 90g. So total mass is 1000 + 90 + 89.6 = 1179.6 g, which is 1.1796 kg. Assuming the density is about 1 kg/L, the volume would be 1.1796 L.

So [HA] = 1.00 / 1.1796 ≈ 0.847 M.

[A-] = 0.80 / 1.1796 ≈ 0.678 M.

Now, substitute into the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log( (γ [A-]) / [HA] )

= 3.854 + log( (0.65 * 0.678) / 0.847 )

Compute numerator: 0.65 * 0.678 = 0.4407.

Divide by 0.847: 0.4407 / 0.847 ≈ 0.5203.

Log(0.5203) ≈ -0.284.

So pH ≈ 3.854 - 0.284 = 3.570.

Wait, same result as before. Hmm, interesting. Because the concentrations are both being divided by a similar volume, the ratio [A-]/[HA] remains 0.8/1.00, so the same as before. Oh wait, because if the volume increases, both [HA] and [A-] decrease by the same factor. So when taking the ratio [A-]/[HA], the volume cancels out. Therefore, the ratio remains 0.8/1.00 = 0.8. So the previous calculation was correct. So pH is about 3.57.

Looking back at the options, option G's (a) is 3.57. So that's a good sign.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when activity coefficients are involved, it's about the ionic strength affecting them, but the problem states to assume the activity coefficient is 0.65 for each univalent ion. So I don't need to calculate ionic strength or anything; I can take γ as 0.65 for A-.

So part (a) answer is 3.57.

Now part (b): adding 0.50 mole of NaOH to the same solution. 

When you add a strong base like NaOH, it will react with the weak acid (HA) to form A-.

The reaction is: HA + OH- → A- + H2O.

So moles before reaction:

HA: 1.00 mol

A-: 0.80 mol

After adding 0.50 mol OH-:

HA will decrease by 0.50, so HA = 0.50 mol.

A- will increase by 0.50, so A- = 1.30 mol.

So new moles are HA = 0.50, A- = 1.30.

But wait, the volume of the solution increases when adding NaOH? Well, the problem says the solution is in 1 kg of water, so perhaps the volume is considered constant, but in reality, adding 0.50 mol of NaOH as a solid or solution? Hmm, but the problem says it's added to the quantity of solution containing 1 kg of water. So I think the volume is the same as before, which was approximately 1.1796 L? Or perhaps we can treat the volume as the same as part (a), since adding solid NaOH won't change the volume significantly. Alternatively, the problem might be simplifying this, assuming the volume remains 1.1796 kg (mass), so the same volume as before. So the concentrations are:

[HA] = 0.50 / 1.1796 ≈ 0.424 M.

[A-] = 1.30 / 1.1796 ≈ 1.103 M.

Now, using the Henderson equation again with the new concentrations and activity coefficients.

pH = pKa + log( (γ * [A-]) / [HA] )

= 3.854 + log( (0.65 * 1.103) / 0.424 )

Compute numerator: 0.65 * 1.103 ≈ 0.717.

Denominator: 0.424.

So ratio: 0.717 / 0.424 ≈ 1.691.

Log(1.691) ≈ 0.228.

So pH ≈ 3.854 + 0.228 ≈ 4.082.

So about 4.08.

Looking at the options for part (b), the second number is the change in pH. Wait, no. Wait, part (b) is the change in pH. Wait, wait, the question is (b) the change in pH resulting from adding 0.50 mole of NaOH. So the initial pH was 3.57, and after adding, it's 4.08. So the change is 4.08 - 3.57 = 0.51 increase.

Wait, no, the question says "the change in the pH", which I think refers to the new pH, not the difference. Because part (c) also asks for the change in pH when adding same NaOH to pure water. Let me re-read the question.

Actually, looking back: part (a) asks for pH of solution. Part (b) says "find the change in the pH of the solution resulting from the addition". So it's the new pH after adding. So part (b) is the new pH, which we calculated as approximately 4.08.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option G says (a) 3.57, (b) 4.07, (c) 13.512.

Hmm, our calculation for (b) was 4.08, which is close to 4.07. So probably option G is correct.

Now part (c): adding 0.50 mole of NaOH to 1 kg of pure water. So what's the pH here?

When you add NaOH to pure water, it dissociates completely. NaOH → Na+ + OH-.

The concentration of OH- is 0.50 mol / (1 kg water). Assuming the volume is about 1 L (since 1 kg water is ~1 L), so [OH-] = 0.50 M.

But wait, the activity of OH- is needed. The pH is calculated using the activity. So the activity of OH- is γ * [OH-], where γ is 0.65 (since OH- is a univalent ion, same as Na+).

So a_OH- = 0.65 * 0.50 = 0.325.

pOH = -log(a_OH-) = -log(0.325).

Log(0.325) = log(3.25e-1) → log(3.25) ≈ 0.5119, so log(0.325) ≈ -0.488.

So pOH ≈ 0.488.

pH = 14 - pOH → 14 - 0.488 = 13.512.

So pH is approximately 13.512.

Now, looking at the options, part (c) in option G is 13.512, which matches.

So putting it all together: (a) 3.57, (b) 4.07, (c) 13.512. So the correct option is G.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### Part (a): pH of the buffer solution
The buffer is prepared by mixing 1.00 mole of lactic acid (HA) and 0.80 mole of sodium lactate (A⁻) in 1 kg of water. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in terms of activities:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{\gamma_{A^-} [A^-]}{[HA]} \right)
\]

- The ionization constant \( K_a \) of lactic acid is \( 1.4 \times 10^{-4} \), so \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.4 \times 10^{-4}) = 3.854 \).
- The activity coefficient \( \gamma_{A^-} \) is given as 0.65.
- The concentrations of \( [A^-] \) and \( [HA] \) are approximately 0.80 M and 1.00 M, respectively, assuming the solution volume is close to 1 L.

Substituting into the equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 3.854 + \log \left( \frac{0.65 \cdot 0.80}{1.00} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 3.854 + \log(0.52) = 3.854 - 0.284 = 3.570
\]

Thus, the pH of the buffer solution is approximately **3.57**.

---

### Part (b): Change in pH after adding 0.50 mole of NaOH
Adding 0.50 mole of NaOH to the buffer reacts with the weak acid (HA) to form A⁻:

\[
\text{HA} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{A}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

- Initial moles: \( \text{HA} = 1.00 \, \text{mol}, \text{A}^- = 0.80 \, \text{mol} \).
- After reaction: \( \text{HA} = 0.50 \, \text{mol}, \text{A}^- = 1.30 \, \text{mol} \).

The new concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.50}{1.1796} \approx 0.424 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{1.30}{1.1796} \approx 1.103 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again:

\[
\text{pH} = 3.
