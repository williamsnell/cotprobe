Okay, so I have this question about the American flag and how many stars it has. Let me think about this. I remember that the flag has stripes and stars. The stripes represent the original colonies, right? But the stars are for the states. Wait, how many states are there in the United States?

Hmm, I think there are 50 states. So if each star stands for a state, then the flag should have 50 stars. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I see older images of the flag with fewer stars. Like, maybe when there were only 48 states. But that's not current, right?

Let me try to recall. The United States started with 13 colonies, so the first flag had 13 stars. As more states joined the Union, they added more stars. The last states to join were Hawaii and Alaska, which became states in 1959, making the total 50. So the current flag should have 50 stars.

Looking at the options, option F is 50. So the answer should be F.

The American flag has stars representing each state in the Union. Since there are currently 50 states, the flag has 50 stars.

F: 50

Answer: F
