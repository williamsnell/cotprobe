Question:

A female psychologist provides a 2-month course of brief behavior therapy for a driving phobia to a male client. Six months after termination they meet at an art opening reception and begin to date. Over the next few months, the relationship progresses and they become sexual. In this situation, the psychologist has acted:

Options:

A: Ethically, as long as she does not provide therapy to the client again in the future
B: Ethically, because she waited an appropriate amount of time after termination before starting a relationship
C: Ethically because it had been 6 months since termination
D: Ethically, because the client initiated the relationship
E: Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment
F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances
G: Probably ethically since there was no coercion involved and the relationship was consensual
H: Unethically, because she should have referred the client to another psychologist before starting a relationship

Okay, so I need to figure out this ethics question about a psychologist and a client. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is a female psychologist who provided a two-month course of brief behavior therapy for a driving phobia to a male client. Then, six months after termination, they meet at an art opening and start dating. Over the next few months, the relationship becomes sexual. The question is whether the psychologist acted ethically in this situation.

I remember that ethical guidelines for psychologists, especially regarding sexual relationships with clients, are pretty strict. I think the main issue here is about the power dynamics and potential exploitation, even after therapy has ended.

So, let's break down the options. Option A says it's ethical as long as she doesn't provide therapy again. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Even if she doesn't treat him again, the fact that they had a prior therapist-client relationship might still make a sexual relationship unethical.

Option B suggests it's ethical because she waited an appropriate time. I think the waiting period might matter, but I'm not certain if six months is considered enough. I remember hearing that some guidelines specify a certain period, like two years maybe? Or perhaps it's just a general principle.

Option C says it's ethical because six months have passed. But I'm not sure if time alone is sufficient. It might depend on other factors, like the nature of the therapy and the vulnerability of the client.

Option D claims it's ethical because the client initiated it. That doesn't seem right. The psychologist should maintain professional boundaries regardless of who initiates contact. The client might not have the same understanding of the ethical implications.

Option E states it's ethically according to standards but shows poor judgment. Hmm, maybe. If starting a relationship after six months is allowed, but it's still not advisable because it could harm the client or damage the professional reputation.

Option F says it's unethical because such relationships are prohibited under any circumstances. I think that's too absolute because some codes might allow it after a certain period, but I'm not sure.

Option G says probably ethical because no coercion and consensual. But I don't think consent is the only factor. The power imbalance might make it inherently problematic, even if the client consents.

Option H suggests it's unethical because she should have referred him elsewhere. But the therapy was already terminated, so maybe that's not the issue here.

Wait, I think the key point is that even after termination, psychologists are prohibited from engaging in sexual relationships with former clients. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules. The APA's Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct, specifically Standard 10.08, I believe, talks about sexual intimacies with former clients. Let me try to recall. I think that standard prohibits such relationships for at least two years after termination unless it can be demonstrated that no harm occurred. Or maybe it's a flat prohibition regardless of time.

Alternatively, some codes might allow it after a certain period, but others might not. If the psychologist started the relationship six months after termination, and if the standard requires a longer waiting period, then it's unethical. But I'm not certain about the exact timeframe.

Alternatively, maybe the rule is that it's always unethical, regardless of time, because of the potential for exploitation. So in that case, any sexual relationship with a former client would be prohibited.

Wait, I think the correct rule is that sexual relationships with former clients are prohibited for at least two years after termination. So if it's only six months, that's too soon, making it unethical.

Looking at the options again, option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, but if the rule allows after two years, then F might be incorrect. Alternatively, if the rule prohibits it regardless of time, then F would be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that it's unethical because she engaged in a sexual relationship, which is prohibited. So F would be the answer.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. I recall that the APA ethics code prohibits psychologists from engaging in sexual relationships with current clients, and also with former clients for a certain period. But I'm not sure if it's a flat prohibition or time-based.

Wait, looking it up in my notes, Standard 10.08 of the APA Ethics Code says that psychologists should not engage in sexual intimacies with a former client for at least two years after termination, unless they can show that no harm is done. So if the psychologist started a relationship six months after, that's within the two-year period, which would be unethical.

So in this scenario, the psychologist started dating six months after termination and became sexual. That would violate the two-year rule.

So the question is, which option aligns with that. Let me look at the options again.

Option F says it's unethically prohibited under any circumstances. But according to the code, it's prohibited for two years, not forever. So F is incorrect because it's not 'any circumstances', just within two years.

Option B says it's ethical because she waited an appropriate time. But six months isn't the two years required, so B is incorrect.

Option E says it's ethically according to standards but poor judgment. Wait, if the code prohibits it for two years, then she violated the standard, so it's not ethically according to standards. So E is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the standards. Some sources say that the prohibition is for two years, but others might have different rules. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because while the code may technically allow it after two years, starting a relationship even after six months shows poor judgment because the power dynamic might still exist, even if the client is consenting.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F, considering that some codes prohibit any sexual relationship with a former client, regardless of time. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about this again. The question is about the psychologist's actions. She provided brief therapy, two months, terminated, six months later they meet and start dating, become sexual.

If the rule is that you can't have a sexual relationship for two years after termination, then six months is too soon, so it's unethical. But the options don't directly mention the two-year period. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment.

If the code allows relationships after two years, then after six months it's not allowed, so E's first part would be incorrect.

Option F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances.

But if after two years it's allowed, then F is incorrect because it's not prohibited under any circumstances.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the code prohibits it, regardless of time. Alternatively, perhaps the code only prohibits it with current clients, not former ones.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think about the actual code. The APA code (2017) says:

10.08 Sexual Intimacies With Former Clients: Psychologists should not engage in sexual intimacies with a former client for at least two years after termination of therapy, except in the most unusual circumstances. Such intimacies are prohibited for an indefinite period if the psychologist has reason to believe that the client is vulnerable to exploitation.

So, the psychologist can engage in a sexual relationship with a former client after two years, unless the client is vulnerable. In this scenario, the therapy was for a driving phobia, which may not make the client particularly vulnerable, but it's a brief therapy. The psychologist started the relationship after six months, which is within the two-year period. So, according to the code, she should not have engaged in the sexual relationship.

Therefore, her actions were unethical because she engaged in a sexual relationship within the prohibited period.

Looking back at the options, which option states that it's unethical because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under the circumstances.

Option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, which isn't correct because after two years, it's allowed. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about whether she acted ethically or unethically. So, according to the code, her actions were unethical because she engaged in a relationship within the two-year period.

So the correct answer would be that she acted unethically because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client too soon.

Looking at the options, option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, which is incorrect because after two years it's allowed. So the correct answer must be another option.

Wait, looking again, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E.

Wait, the question is, which option correctly describes her actions. She engaged in a sexual relationship six months after termination, which violates the two-year rule. So her actions were unethical, making options that say it's unethical correct.

Options F says "Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances." But according to the code, it's prohibited only for two years, not any circumstances. So F is incorrect.

Option E says: "Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment." But if the code prohibits it for two years, then she violated the standard, so E's first part is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the code may not explicitly prohibit it, but it's still poor judgment. But I think the code does prohibit it for two years, so her actions were unethical, not just poor judgment.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F, but the code allows it after two years. So in this case, she is prohibited, making her actions unethical.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The question is, did the psychologist act ethically?

She started a sexual relationship six months after termination. According to the code, it's prohibited for two years, so she violated that. Therefore, her actions were unethical.

Looking at the options, which one says that her actions were unethical because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under the circumstances.

Option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, which is not correct, but the closest is F.

Wait, but the correct reasoning is that the code prohibits it for two years, so her actions were unethical. Therefore, the answer should be F, because she engaged in a prohibited relationship, even though the option's reasoning is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is F.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the possible answers again.

Option F says it's unethically prohibited under any circumstances, which is incorrect because after two years, it's allowed. So F is incorrect.

Option E says it's ethically according to standards but poor judgment. But if she violated the standard, then E's first part is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because even though she violated the time frame, some might argue that technically she didn't, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the code says you can't have sex with a former client for two years, so she did it six months later, which is a violation. Therefore, her actions were unethical.

Looking at the options, which one states that she acted unethically because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited.

Ah, option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, but the code allows it after two years, so F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is F.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that says it's unethical because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited.

Option F says that.

But according to the code, it's prohibited for two years, not any circumstances. So F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because the code prohibits it entirely, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: "Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment."

Wait, but if she violated the standard by having a relationship within two years, then it's not ethically according to standards. So E is incorrect.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of what I know.

In many professional codes, including psychology, sexual relationships with current clients are strictly prohibited. For former clients, there's usually a waiting period, often two years. If the psychologist starts a relationship within that period, it's considered unethical.

In this case, the waiting period was six months, which is less than two years, so it's unethical.

Looking at the options, the one that says it's unethical because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited.

Option F says that, but it's phrased as 'prohibited under any circumstances', which isn't accurate because after two years it's allowed. So F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F because the code prohibits it regardless of time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, perhaps I should go with option F as the answer.

The scenario involves a female psychologist who provided brief behavior therapy to a male client for two months. Six months after termination, they met at an art opening, started dating, and eventually became sexual. The question is whether the psychologist acted ethically in this situation.

Ethical guidelines, such as those outlined in the APA's Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct (Standard 10.08), prohibit psychologists from engaging in sexual relationships with former clients for at least two years after termination, except in the most unusual circumstances. This rule is in place to protect clients from potential exploitation due to the power imbalance inherent in the therapist-client relationship.

In this case, the psychologist initiated a sexual relationship six months after termination, which violates the two-year prohibition. Therefore, her actions were unethical. While some options suggest that waiting an appropriate time or the client initiating the relationship might make it ethical, these factors do not override the clear prohibition on sexual relationships within the two-year period.

Option F states that engaging in a sexual relationship with a former client is prohibited under any circumstances. However, this is not entirely accurate because the APA allows such relationships after two years, provided no exploitation is present. Thus, Option F is incorrect because it misrepresents the code as prohibiting such relationships under all circumstances.

Given the analysis, the psychologist's actions were unethical because she violated the two-year prohibition. However, none of the options perfectly align with this reasoning. Despite this, Option F is the closest to being correct, as it captures the unethical nature of the relationship, even if the reasoning about "any circumstances" is flawed.

Answer: F
