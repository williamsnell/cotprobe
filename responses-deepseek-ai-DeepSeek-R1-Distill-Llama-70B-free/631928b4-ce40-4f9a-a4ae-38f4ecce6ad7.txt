Question:

The Russell-Saunders coupling of the angularmomenta of two atomicorbitalsgives rise to a quantum number L in which all the angular quantum numbers,l_i, are combined vectorially. That is, L = l_1 + l_2 , l_1 + l2- 1, ... , \vertl1- l_2\vert What will be the values of L when a p and a d electron in-teract?

Options:

A: 3, 2, 0
B: 4, 2, 1
C: 2, 1, 0
D: 2, 1, 1
E: 5, 3, 1
F: 1, 0, -1
G: 3, 2, 1
H: 3, 1, 0
I: 4, 3, 2
J: 2, 1, -1

Okay, so I've got this question about Russell-Saunders coupling and angular momentum quantum numbers. Hmm, I remember that when two electrons interact, their angular momenta combine vectorially. Right, so each electron has its own angular momentum quantum number, l. For a p electron, l is 1, and for a d electron, l is 2. Wait, yeah, p is l=1, d is l=2.

The question is asking what values L can take when these two electrons interact. So Russell-Saunders coupling means we add them vectorially. Oh right, the formula is L = l1 + l2, l1 + l2 -1, all the way down to |l1 - l2|. So for l1=1 and l2=2, the maximum L would be 3, then 2, then 1. Because 1+2=3, then 3-1=2, then 2-1=1. Wait, but wait, the minimum is |1-2|=1. Oh wait, subtracting until we hit that minimum. So the possible L values are 3, 2, 1? Or wait, let's double-check.

Wait, another approach: l1 is 1, l2 is 2. So the possible sums start at 1+2=3, then 2 (3-1), then 1 (2-1), and we can't go lower than |1-2|=1. So L can be 3, 2, 1. So the possible L values are 3, 2, 1. 

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option G is 3,2,1. Oh yeah, that's one of the choices. Looking back, the options are A to J.

Wait, but wait, the options are labeled A through J. Let me check each option.

Option G says 3,2,1. So that's the correct sequence.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because in Russell-Saunders coupling, the order of adding doesn't matter, right? So 1 and 2 can combine to 3, 2, 1. So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option G.

To determine the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number \( L \) when a \( p \) electron (\( l_1 = 1 \)) and a \( d \) electron (\( l_2 = 2 \)) interact, we use the Russell-Saunders coupling rule. This rule states that \( L \) can take on values ranging from \( l_1 + l_2 \) down to \( |l_1 - l_2| \), in integer steps. 

For \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 2 \):
- The maximum value of \( L \) is \( l_1 + l_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \).
- The minimum value of \( L \) is \( |l_1 - l_2| = |1 - 2| = 1 \).
- Therefore, the possible values of \( L \) are \( 3, 2, 1 \).

Among the given options, the correct sequence of \( L \) values is provided by **Option G: 3, 2, 1**.

Answer: G
