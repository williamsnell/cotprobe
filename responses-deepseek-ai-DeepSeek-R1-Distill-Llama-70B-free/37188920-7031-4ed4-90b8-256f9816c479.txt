Okay, so I have this problem about gravitational sedimentation equilibrium and need to find the Boltzmann constant. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The setup is that gamboge particles are suspended in water, and their concentration is measured at different heights. The idea is that due to gravity, the particles settle, creating a concentration gradient. At equilibrium, the upward thermal motion balances the downward gravitational force, which should relate to the Boltzmann distribution.

I remember that in such a situation, the number density of particles decreases exponentially with height. The formula I think is n = n0 * exp(-mgh/(kT)), where m is the mass of a particle, g is gravity, h is height, k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but wait—another thought. Since the particles are in a liquid, does buoyancy play a role? Oh right, because the effective mass is the mass of the particle minus the mass of the displaced fluid. So maybe the formula uses the buoyant mass?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is n = n0 * exp( - (m' g h)/(k T) ), where m' is the effective mass (m_particle - m_water_displaced). Or wait, maybe it's (density of particle minus density of water) times volume divided by something.

Let me think again. The particles are denser than water, so they settle. The gravitational force on a particle is (density_particle - density_water) * volume * g. Oh wait, but in the problem, the density of the water isn't given. Hmm. Wait the problem gives the density of the gamboge particles as 1351 kg/m³. I don't know the density of water, but I think it's about 1000 kg/m³. So the difference would be 351 kg/m³.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the fluid is water with density 1000 kg/m³, so the effective density is 1351 - 1000 = 351 kg/m³.

But wait, in the data given, the mean number of particles at height 0 is 203, and it decreases as height increases. So the formula would be n(h) = n0 exp(-h/(H)), where H is the scale height. Alternatively, H is (k T)/(m g), but H would be the height where the number drops by 1/e.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to take the logarithm of the ratio of the number of particles at different heights. For example, between each height and the height above it, calculate the ratio and see how it depends on height.

So the data points are:

Height (µm): 0, 25, 50, 75, 100.
Mean number: 203, 166, 136, 112, 91.

Wait, 0 µm is at the top, or the bottom? Oh, I think in sedimentation, the highest concentration is at the bottom (h=0) and it decreases as you go up. So 0 µm is the bottom, 100 µm is the top.

So for each step, the height increases by 25 µm. Let's take the first two points: at h=0, n=203; at h=25, n=166. So the ratio is 166/203 = approx 0.818. For the next step, 136/166 ≈ 0.819. Then 112/136 is about 0.824, and 91/112 is about 0.812. So it's roughly similar, but maybe averages out.

Wait, but the ratio is n(h)/n(h + delta h) ?

Wait, no. Because for each height h, the next is h + delta_h. So the ratio would be n(h+delta_h) / n(h) ?

Wait, no. Because the particles are settling, the concentration at a higher height should be lower than the concentration just below it. So if I'm considering the concentration as a function of height, it's n(h) = n0 exp(-h/H), where H is a constant.

But taking the logarithm, ln(n(h)) = ln(n0) - h/H. So for each data point, if I take ln(n) at each height, it should form a straight line with negative slope -1/H.

So the idea is to calculate the slope of ln(n) vs h, which is -1/H.

But wait, the points are at h=0,25,50,75,100 µm. Let's convert to meters, since the units in the problem are in meters. So 25 µm is 25e-6 m, right? 25e-6 m.

So let's compute the natural logarithm of each n:

n: 203, 166, 136, 112, 91.

ln(203) ≈ 5.313; ln(166) ≈ 5.111; ln(136) ≈ 4.913; ln(112) ≈ 4.718; ln(91) ≈ 4.511.

So the ln(n) values are approximately:

0 µm: 5.313

25 µm:5.111

50 µm:4.913

75 µm:4.718

100 µm:4.511

Now, let's plot these against h (in meters). But since h is small, let's see the slope between each pair.

Between 0 and 25 µm:

h=0: ln(n)=5.313

h=25e-6 m: ln(n)=5.111

The change in ln(n) is 5.111 - 5.313 = -0.202 over a change in height of 25e-6 m.

So the slope is -0.202 / (25e-6) = approx -8073.6 m^-1.

Wait, but the slope is -1/H, so H is 1/8073.6 ≈ 1.24e-4 m, which is 0.124 mm. Hmm, that seems a bit small, but let's proceed.

Wait, but let's compute the slope between each consecutive pair.

Between 0 and 25 µm: delta_ln(n) =5.111 -5.313 = -0.202; delta_h=25e-6 m.

Slope1 = -0.202/(25e-6) = -8073.6

Between 25 and 50 µm: ln(n)=4.913; delta_ln=4.913-5.111= -0.198; delta_h=25e-6.

Slope2 = -0.198/(25e-6) = -7920

Between 50 and 75: ln(n)=4.718; delta_ln=4.718-4.913= -0.195; delta_h=25e-6.

Slope3 = -0.195/(25e-6)= -7800.

Between 75 and 100: ln(n)=4.511; delta_ln=4.511-4.718= -0.207; delta_h=25e-6.

Slope4= -0.207/(25e-6)= -8280.

Wait, so the slopes are around -8000 per m, give or take.

But perhaps to get a more accurate value, I should take the average of these slopes. Alternatively, compute it using all the data points, using a linear fit.

Alternatively, using all the points to compute the best fit line for ln(n) against h.

Let me consider each data point as (h, ln(n)).

h (m) | ln(n)
0 |5.313
25e-6 |5.111
50e-6 |4.913
75e-6 |4.718
100e-6 |4.511

To find the best fit line, we can compute the slope using the formula:

slope = [ (x2 - x1)(y2 - y1) + (x3 - x2)(y3 - y2) + ... ] / (sum of (xi^2) terms) ?

Wait, no, the formula for linear regression is:

slope m = [n Σ(xy) - Σx Σy ] / [n Σx² - (Σx)^2 ]

Alternatively, since the points are equally spaced, perhaps it's easier to compute the average of the slopes between consecutive points.

Wait, the four slopes I calculated were approximately:

-8073.6, -7920, -7800, -8280.

So the average would be (-8073.6 -7920 -7800 -8280)/4.

Calculating:

-8073.6 -7920 = -15,993.6

-7800: total -24,793.6

-8280: total -32,073.6.

Divide by 4: -8,018.4 m^-1.

So the average slope is approximately -8018 m^-1. So H=1/8018 ≈ 0.0001247 m, which is 0.1247 mm.

Wait, but wait, H is (k T)/(m g) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the formula again. The scale height H is (k*T)/(m'*g), where m' is the effective mass.

Wait, the effective mass is the mass of the particle minus the mass of the displaced fluid. Because the buoyant force reduces the effective weight.

So the effective mass m' = (density_particle - density_water) * volume.

Because mass = density * volume.

So m' = (rho_p - rho_water) * V.

Given that rho_p is 1351 kg/m³, and rho_water is about 1000 kg/m³ (I'll assume that).

So m' = (1351 - 1000) * V = 351 * V.

But what's V? The problem states that the mean volume of a gamboge particle is 9.78e-21 m³.

So m' = 351 kg/m³ * 9.78e-21 m³ = 351 *9.78e-21 kg.

Calculating that: 351 *9.78e-21 = let's compute 350 *9.78e-21 = 3423e-21 = 3.423e-18 kg. Then 1 *9.78e-21=9.78e-21, so total m'≈3.423e-18 + 0.978e-20 = 3.43278e-18 kg.

Wait, 351 *9.78e-21 = let me compute 351 * 9.78 first.

351 *9 = 3159, 351 *0.78=273.78. Sum: 3159 + 273.78=3432.78. So 3432.78e-21 kg = 3.43278e-18 kg.

So m'≈3.43278e-18 kg.

H is (k*T)/(m' * g).

H is 0.0001247 m (from earlier).

Wait, but wait, the slope was -1/H, so the slope is approximately -8018 m^-1.

So, 1/H ≈8018 m^-1, so H = 1/8018 ≈ 0.0001247 m.

Wait, but wait, in the formula, the slope is - (m' g)/(k T) ) * 1, because ln(n) = ln(n0) - (m' g h)/(k T) ).

So the slope is -(m' g)/(k T).

So the slope_m is - (m' g) / (k T). So solving for k:

k = (m' g) / (-slope_m * T )

Wait, because slope_m is negative, so -slope_m would be positive.

Wait, let me clarify. The slope from the data was -8018 m^-1, which is equal to -(m' g)/(k T). So:

slope = - (m' g) / (k T)

So rearranging,

k = (m' g) / (-slope * T )

We have m' =3.43278e-18 kg.

g is 9.81 m/s².

T is 20°C, which is 293.15 K.

But wait, the slope is negative, so -slope would be positive.

So let's plug in the numbers.

Compute m' g: 3.43278e-18 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 3.43278e-18 *9.81 = approximately 3.369e-17 kg·m/s².

Wait, 3.43278 *9.81 = let's compute:

3 *9.81 =29.43, 0.43278 *9.81≈4.245. So total ≈33.675. So 33.675e-18 kg·m/s² → 3.3675e-17.

So m' g =3.3675e-17.

Now, -slope is 8018 m⁻¹.

T is 293.15 K.

So k = (3.3675e-17) / (8018 * 293.15 )

Compute denominator: 8018 * 293.15 ≈ ?

Let me compute 8000 * 293 = 2,344,000. 18 * 293 ≈5268.4. So total ≈2,344,000 +5,268.4= 2,349,268.4.

Wait, 8018 *293.15 = let me compute 8018 *293 = ?

8018 * 200 =1,603,600.

8018 *93 = 8018*(90+3)= 8018*90=721,620 and 8018*3=24,054 → sum 721,620 +24,054=745,674.

Total 1,603,600 +745,674=2,349,274.

But wait, the 0.15 in 293.15, so 8018 *0.15=1,202.7.

So total denominator is 2,349,274 +1,202.7=2,350,476.7.

So denominator ≈2.350e6.

So now, k=3.3675e-17 / (2.350e6 ) → 3.3675e-17 / 2.35e6 = (3.3675 /2.35 ) * 1e-23.

Compute 3.3675 /2.35 → approximately 1.432.

So k≈1.432e-23 J/K.

Looking at the options:

A:1.34e-23

B:1.54e-23

C:1.42e-23

D:1.38e-23

E:1.64e-23

F:1.44e-23

G:1.21e-23

H:1.47e-23

I:1.24e-23

J:1.50e-23.

So option C is 1.42e-23, which matches our approximation. But let me double-check the calculations, maybe I made an error in m' or H.

Wait, let me recheck the computation of m':

Volume V =9.78e-21 m³.

Density difference rho_diff =1351-1000=351 kg/m³.

m' = rho_diff * V → 351 kg/m³ *9.78e-21 m³ = 351 *9.78e-21.

Compute 351 *9.78:

As before, 350*9.78=3423, 1*9.78=9.78. So 3423+9.78=3432.78 → 3432.78e-21 kg →3.43278e-18 kg. Correct.

Slope: average of -8018 m⁻¹. So 8018 m⁻¹.

So m' g =3.43278e-18 kg *9.81 → let's compute accurately.

3.43278e-18 kg *9.81 m/s² → 3.43278 *9.81 = let me compute:

3 *9.81=29.43

0.43278 *9.81:

Compute 0.4*9.81=3.924

0.03278 *9.81≈0.3215.

So total 3.924+0.3215=4.2455.

So 3*9.81=29.43 +4.2455=33.6755.

So 33.6755e-18 → 3.36755e-17 kg·m/s².

Denominator: (slope) * T =8018 *293.15.

Wait, wait, in the denominator, it's (-slope)*T.

Wait, the slope was -8018, so -slope is 8018.

So 8018 * 293.15 → compute that exactly.

Compute 8000*293.15 =8000*293 +8000*0.15 → 8000*293=2,344,000. 8000*0.15=1,200 → total 2,345,200.

Then 18*293.15= 18*(200+93.15) → 18*200=3,600; 18*93.15=1,676.7 → 3,600+1,676.7=5,276.7.

So total denominator is 2,345,200 +5,276.7=2,350,476.7.

So denominator≈2.350e6.

So k=3.36755e-17 /2.350e6 → 3.36755e-17 /2.350e6 = (3.36755 /2.35 ) * 1e-23.

3.36755 /2.35 → let's compute:

2.35 *1.432 ≈?

2 *1.432=2.864.

0.35*1.432=0.5012 → total 3.3652. So 2.35 *1.432≈3.3652, which is very close to 3.36755.

So the value is approximately 1.432e-23 J/K.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.42e-23, and option F is 1.44e-23.

Hmm, 1.432 is closer to 1.43e-23, but none have that. The options are C:1.42, F:1.44.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 3.36755e-17 / (8018 *293.15)= 3.36755e-17 / (2,350,476.7)

Wait, 3.36755e-17 ÷ 2.350e6 = ?

3.36755 /2.
