Question:

Laryngeal oedema is usually confined to the larynx above the vocal folds because

Options:

A: laryngeal oedema is not confined to any particular area of the larynx
B: fluid will drain rapidly into the thorax below the vocal folds.
C: there are numerous mucous glands in the vestibular folds.
D: the vocal folds have a protective layer that prevents oedema
E: the larynx below the vocal folds is more susceptible to inflammation
F: the mucosa below the vocal folds absorbs fluid more rapidly
G: the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues.
H: there are fewer blood vessels in the area below the vocal folds

Okay, so I have this question about laryngeal edema and why it's usually confined above the vocal folds. Hmm, I remember that the larynx has different areas, and the vocal folds are a significant part. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the larynx is divided into the supraglottis (above the vocal cords), glottis (the area around the vocal cords), and subglottis (below). Edema is swelling due to fluid accumulation. So why does it usually stay above the vocal folds?

I think it's something about the mucosa. Oh right, the mucosa above the vocal folds is different from below. The vocal folds themselves have a specific structure. Oh, the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly adhered to the underlying tissues. So maybe that makes it harder for fluid to accumulate there.

Wait, so if the mucosa is tightly attached, any swelling would be limited. Above the folds, the mucosa might be looser, allowing fluid to collect more easily. That would mean edema doesn't spread below as much because the tissues there are more tightly bound and can't hold as much fluid.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached. That makes sense because if it's tight, fluid can't accumulate as much below. So the edema stays above where the mucosa is more flexible or loosely attached.

Other options: Option A says it's not confined, which contradicts the question. Option B says fluid drains into the thorax, but I don't think drainage is the main reason. Option C mentions mucous glands in vestibular folds, but I'm not sure how that affects edema. Option D suggests a protective layer, but I think it's more about the attachment. Option E is about susceptibility, but the question is about confinement, not cause. Option F talks about absorption, which I'm not certain about. Option H discusses fewer blood vessels, which might affect edema, but I think the key is the tight mucosa.

Laryngeal oedema is usually confined above the vocal folds because the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to the underlying tissues, limiting the accumulation of fluid in that area. This tight attachment prevents significant swelling below the vocal folds, whereas the mucosa above the vocal folds is more loosely attached, allowing fluid to collect more easily.

The correct answer is:

G: the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues.

Answer: G
