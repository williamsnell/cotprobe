Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diving bell and its volume change when submerged. Hmm, diving bell... I remember that when you submerge something in water, the pressure increases with depth. Oh right, pressure underwater increases because of the weight of the water above. So the deeper you go, the higher the pressure.

The question says the diving bell has an air space of 3.0 cubic meters on the deck. When it's lowered to 50 meters deep, what's the new volume? The options are from A to J. I think I need to calculate how the volume changes under pressure.

Wait, I remember something about Boyle's Law. Isn't that the one where pressure and volume are inversely related at constant temperature? Oh right, P1V1 = P2V2. Since the temperature is the same, that should work here.

But wait, I need to figure out the pressures. The pressure underwater is the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the water depth. Atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 101,325 Pascals. Then, the pressure from the water. Hmm, how do you calculate that?

Oh right, pressure due to a fluid column is given by P = ρgh. Where ρ is the density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the depth. The density given here is 1.025 g/cm³, which is 1025 kg/m³. Because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³, so 1.025 is 1025 kg/m³.

So the pressure at 50 meters depth is ρgh. Let me plug in the numbers. g is 9.8 m/s². So 1025 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 50 m. Let me compute that.

1025 * 9.8 is... let's see, 1000 * 9.8 is 9800, and 25 *9.8 is 245, so total 9800 + 245 = 10045. Then multiply by 50: 10045 *50. 10000*50 is 500,000 and 45*50 is 2250, so 502,250 Pa. So that's the pressure from the water.

But wait, the total pressure underwater is atmospheric plus the water pressure. So 101,325 Pa (atmospheric) plus 502,250 Pa gives... 101,325 + 502,250 is 603,575 Pa. Approximately 6.03575e5 Pa.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the density. The problem says the mean density is 1.025 g/cm³. Oh wait, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³, so 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³. That's correct.

So the initial pressure P1 is atmospheric, 101325 Pa. The final pressure P2 is 603,575 Pa.

Using Boyle's Law: P1V1 = P2V2. So V2 = (P1/P2) * V1.

Plugging in the numbers: V2 = (101325 / 603575) * 3.0 m³.

Let me compute that ratio. 101325 divided by 603575. Let's see, 101325 is approximately 100,000 and 603,575 is about 600,000. So 1/6 approx. But let me calculate it more accurately.

101325 ÷ 603575. Let's compute denominator as 603575 ≈ 6.03575e5.

101325 ÷ 603575 ≈ Let me compute this division. Let me see, 101325 * 6 = 607950, which is just a bit more than 603,575. So 101325 *5.95? Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute 101325/603575.

Alternatively, factor out 25: 101325 = 25*4045, 603575=25*24143. So 4045/24143. Hmm, but that might not help. Maybe approximate.

Well, 101325 / 603575 ≈ 0.1677. Because 0.1677 * 603575 = approx 101,325.

So V2 is 0.1677 * 3.0 m³. 0.1677 *3 is about 0.5031. So approximately 0.5 cubic meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 0.5 m³. So would the answer be H?

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the pressure correctly? Because sometimes in these problems, people might ignore the atmospheric pressure and just take the gauge pressure. Let me think.

Wait no, when the diving bell is on the deck, the air inside is at atmospheric pressure. When submerged, it's subjected to the sum of atmospheric and water pressure. So the approach I took is correct.

But let me make sure about the pressure calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Density ρ = 1025 kg/m³.

g = 9.8 m/s².

h =50 m.

Pressure from water: P = ρgh = 1025 *9.8 *50.

Compute 1025 * 50 first: 1025 *50 is 51,250.

Then 51,250 *9.8: Let's compute 51,250 *10 =512,500. Subtract 51,250 *0.2 (which is 10,250) → 512,500 -10,250 = 502,250 Pa. That matches earlier.

So P2 is 101,325 + 502,250 = 603,575 Pa.

So the ratio P1/P2 is 101325/603575 ≈ 0.1677.

So V2 = 3 * 0.1677 ≈ 0.503 m³. So about 0.5, which is option H.

But wait, the available options are:

A:0.8, B:2.0, C:2.8, D:3.5, E:4.0, F:1.2, G:2.5, H:0.5, I:1.0, J:1.5.

So 0.5 is H.

But wait, another thought: Is the diving bell rigid? Because if it's not, but can compress, then the volume would decrease as per the pressure increase. But if the bell is rigid and the air inside is compressed, then the volume would decrease. But in this case, the problem says the 'air space' of 3 m³ on deck. So it's the volume of air. So when the pressure increases, the volume decreases, assuming temperature is same.

So yes, the calculation should be correct. So the answer should be H:0.5 m³.

Wait but wait, another angle: is the density of seawater given as 1.025 g/cm³. Oh wait, but when calculating ρ in kg/m³, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³, which is correct.

Hmm, I think I did everything correctly. So the answer is H.

To determine the volume of the air space in the diving bell at a depth of 50 m, we use Boyle's Law, which states that at constant temperature, \( P_1V_1 = P_2V_2 \), where \( P \) is pressure and \( V \) is volume. 

### Step 1: Calculate the total pressure at 50 m depth
The total pressure underwater is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the water column:
\[
P_2 = P_{\text{atmospheric}} + \rho g h
\]
Where:
- \( P_{\text{atmospheric}} = 101,325 \, \text{Pa} \),
- \( \rho = 1025 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) (density of seawater),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \),
- \( h = 50 \, \text{m} \).

The pressure due to the water column is:
\[
\rho g h = 1025 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 50 = 502,250 \, \text{Pa}.
\]
Thus, the total pressure at 50 m depth is:
\[
P_2 = 101,325 + 502,250 = 603,575 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply Boyle's Law
The initial pressure \( P_1 \) is atmospheric pressure (\( 101,325 \, \text{Pa} \)), and the initial volume \( V_1 \) is \( 3.0 \, \text{m}^3 \). Using Boyle's Law:
\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1}{P_2} V_1.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
V_2 = \frac{101,325}{603,575} \cdot 3.0.
\]
The ratio \( \frac{101,325}{603,575} \) is approximately \( 0.1677 \). Therefore:
\[
V_2 = 0.1677 \cdot 3.0 = 0.5031 \, \text{m}^3.
\]
This rounds to \( 0.5 \, \text{m}^3 \).

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
From the given options:
- **A: 0.8 m³**
- **B: 2.0 m³**
- **C: 2.8 m³**
- **D: 3.5 m³**
- **E: 4.0 m³**
- **F: 1.2 m³**
- **G: 2.5 m³**
- **H: 0.5 m³**
- **I: 1.0 m³**
- **J: 1.5 m³**

The closest match is **H: 0.5 m³**.
