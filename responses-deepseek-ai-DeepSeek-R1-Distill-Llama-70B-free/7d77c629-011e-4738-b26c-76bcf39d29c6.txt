Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the energy required to move gas through a pipeline. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my fluid mechanics, but let's try to break this down step by step.

The problem states that the gas has a molecular weight M of 20 lb/lbmol. The pipeline is 14 inches in diameter, and the Darcy friction factor f is 0.013. The pressure at the end of the line is 17 psia, which is P2. The temperature is constant at 65°F. The pipeline is 17500 feet long, and we need to find the energy required to move 500 lb/min of gas. The options are from A to J, with various horsepower values.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with flow of gases in pipelines, the key equation might be the one involving the pressure drop due to friction. Oh right, the Darcy-Weisbach equation comes into play. But since this is a gas, maybe I should consider the Weymouth equation or the Panhandle equations? Or wait, perhaps it's simpler than that. Let's think.

The basic idea is that we're moving a fluid (gas) through a pipe, and due to friction, there's a pressure drop. The energy required would relate to the work done in overcoming this pressure drop. Since the problem gives us the pressure at the end of the line, maybe we need to find the pressure at the start, but wait, no, the question is about the energy to move the gas, so perhaps the pressure drop along the pipe is the key.

But wait, the problem gives P2 as 17 psia. Oh, wait, that's the pressure at the end of the line. So I think we're supposed to calculate the pressure drop and then find the work done.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is calculated using the pressure drop multiplied by the flow rate. Hmm.

Wait, the general formula for power (energy per unit time) is work done per unit time. The work done by the pump or compressor would be related to the pressure difference times the volume flow rate. But for gases, since they're compressible, it's a bit more involved.

Let me think: the energy required would be the work done to compress the gas and push it through the pipe against the friction losses. Since the temperature is constant, maybe we can assume it's an isothermal process. Oh, right, because the temperature is given as constant.

In an isothermal process for an ideal gas, the work done is P1V1 ln(P1/P2), but wait, that might not be directly applicable here. Alternatively, the pressure drop would be the key factor. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we should calculate the pressure drop first using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The Darcy friction factor f is given as 0.013, which is a bit on the lower side, maybe for turbulent flow. 

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is: h_f = f * (L/D) * (V^2)/2g, where h_f is the head loss (in feet of fluid), L is the pipe length, D is diameter, V is the average velocity, and g is acceleration due to gravity. But wait, that's for incompressible flow. But gas is compressible, so maybe using this equation would require knowing the density.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the pressure drop (ΔP) using the formula for compressible flow. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to model this.

Wait, the formula for head loss in terms of pressure drop for gases is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * V^2) / (2D), where ρ is the density. But since the gas is compressible, the density might vary along the pipe, but since temperature is constant, maybe we can use the ideal gas law to find an average density or something.

Wait, but the energy required would be the work done to push the gas against the pressure gradient. So perhaps the power needed is the product of the volumetric flow rate and the pressure drop.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Calculate the volumetric flow rate of the gas. Wait, but we have mass flow rate (500 lb/min) and molecular weight M=20 lb/lbmol. So we can find the molar flow rate first.

2. Using the ideal gas law, find the volumetric flow rate at the given temperature and pressure.

Wait, but the problem gives P2 as 17 psia. Is that the discharge pressure or the pressure at the end? Oh, I think P2 is the pressure at the end of the pipe, so perhaps the pressure at the start is higher, and the pressure drop is P1 - P2. But without knowing P1, I'm not sure how to proceed. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the power required to move the gas, which would be based on the pressure drop and the volumetric flow rate. So perhaps the approach is:

Power (in horsepower) = (ΔP * Q) / (1716) 

Where ΔP is the pressure drop in psi, Q is the volumetric flow rate in cubic feet per second, and 1716 is the conversion factor from ft-lbf per horsepower-hour to the units here.

Wait, but I'm not certain about this formula. Alternatively, the power required might be the product of mass flow rate, specific volume, and pressure drop, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think again. The pressure drop along the pipe can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, but for a gas, the equation might be different because the density changes with pressure.

Alternatively, for gases, the Weymouth equation is sometimes used for natural gas transmission lines, which relates the flow rate to the pressure drop. The Weymouth equation is:

Q = (0.433 * T^(1/3)) / (L * (P1^2 - P2^2)^(1/2)) ) * D^(8/3) * f^(-1/2)

Wait, but I'm not too sure about the exact form. Alternatively, the formula might be:

Q = 18.062 * D^2 * sqrt( (P1^2 - P2^2) / (f * L * T * Z) ) )

Where Z is the compressibility factor, which for ideal gas is 1. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the pressure drop first using the Darcy equation for gases.

Wait, the Darcy-Weisbach equation can be written as:

(ΔP) = f * (L/D) * (ρ V^2)/2

But for gases, the density varies with pressure. Since the temperature is constant, we can express density in terms of pressure.

Let me try to break this down. Since the gas is moving through the pipe, and the temperature is constant, we can use the ideal gas law: PV = nRT. So, the density ρ is (P * M) / (R T), where R is the gas constant.

Wait, but the problem is that the pressure varies along the pipe, so the density varies. Therefore, perhaps it's better to use an average density or use the average pressure.

Alternatively, maybe for a small pressure drop, we can approximate the density as being based on the average pressure.

Wait, but in this problem, the pressure at the end is 17 psia. Wait, but what's the pressure at the inlet? We're not given P1, so perhaps we're to assume that the pressure drop is negligible, but that doesn't make sense because we're asked to compute the energy required. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the gas is moving through the pipe, and the work done is to overcome the friction losses. So we need to compute the pressure drop due to friction, then compute the work as the product of that pressure drop and the volumetric flow rate.

But without knowing P1, perhaps we can express the work in terms of the mass flow rate and other variables.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the head loss, then find the pressure drop, then compute the power.

Let me try that.

First, calculate the mass flow rate, which is given as 500 lb/min. Let's convert that to lb/s: 500 / 60 ≈ 8.333 lb/s.

The molecular weight M is 20 lb/lbmol. So the molar flow rate is mass flow rate divided by molecular weight: 8.333 / 20 = 0.41665 lbmol/s.

Now, using the ideal gas law, we can find the volumetric flow rate Q at the given temperature and pressure. Since the temperature is constant at 65°F, which is 65 + 459.67 = 524.67 °R.

Wait, but what pressure should we use? Because the pressure varies along the pipe. Hmm, perhaps we can use the average pressure. But without knowing P1, maybe we can't do that. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the pressure drop is small compared to the absolute pressure, so we can use P2 for calculation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to find the volumetric flow rate at the end of the pipe, where P2 is 17 psia. So Q = nRT/P.

n is molar flow rate, 0.41665 lbmol/s.

R is the gas constant. Using units that work: R = 10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol-°R).

So Q = (0.41665 lbmol/s) * (10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol-°R)) * (524.67 °R) / (17 psia).

Let me compute that:

0.41665 * 10.7316 = approx 4.475.

4.475 * 524.67 ≈ 2348.5.

Now divide by 17: 2348.5 / 17 ≈ 138.2 ft³/s.

Wait, but 138 ft³/s seems quite high for a 14-inch pipe. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.41665 * 10.7316 = approximately 4.475. Then 4.475 * 524.67 is indeed about 2348.5. Divide by 17 gives 138.2 ft³/s.

But a 14-inch diameter pipe has a cross-sectional area of (π*(14/24)^2)/4. Wait, 14 inches is 1.1667 feet. Area is π*(1.1667/2)^2 = π*(0.5833)^2 ≈ 1.073 ft².

If the flow rate is 138 ft³/s, the velocity V would be Q/A = 138 / 1.073 ≈ 128.6 ft/s. That's quite high, but maybe possible.

Now, using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

h_f = f * (L/D) * (V^2)/(2g)

Where f=0.013, L=17500 ft, D=1.1667 ft, V=128.6 ft/s, g=32.2 ft/s².

Compute each part:

f*(L/D) = 0.013 * (17500 / 1.1667) ≈ 0.013 * 15000 ≈ 195.

(V^2)/(2g) = (128.6)^2 / (2*32.2) ≈ (16520) / 64.4 ≈ 256.6 ft.

So h_f = 195 * 256.6 ≈ 50,081 ft of head loss.

But head loss is in feet of fluid, so to get pressure drop, we multiply by specific weight. Wait, but for gas, specific weight is ρg, which varies with pressure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the pressure drop using the formula:

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * V²) / (2D)

But we need the density ρ. Since the gas is at 17 psia and 65°F, let's compute ρ.

Using ideal gas law, PV = nRT → ρ = (P M) / (R T)

P is 17 psia, M=20 lb/lbmol, R=10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol-°R), T=524.67 °R.

So ρ = (17 * 20) / (10.7316 * 524.67) → (340) / (5645.8) ≈ 0.0602 lb/ft³.

Wait, that's very low density, which makes sense for a gas.

Now, compute ΔP:

ΔP = (0.013 * 17500 ft * 0.0602 lb/ft³ * (128.6 ft/s)^2 ) / (2 * 1.1667 ft)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 0.013 * 17500 = 227.5.

Then, 128.6^2 = 16520. So 16520 * 0.0602 = 994.0 lb/(s²*ft).

Multiply by 227.5: 227.5 * 994 ≈ 226,255 lb/(s²·ft).

Now, denominator is 2 * 1.1667 ≈ 2.3334 ft.

So ΔP ≈ 226255 / 2.3334 ≈ 97,000 lb/(s²·ft²) → because 1 ft² is (1 ft)^2, but units are getting a bit messy.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute in consistent units.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's compute the units properly.

The units for ΔP should be in lb/ft² (which is psf, pounds per square foot). Let me see:

f is dimensionless, L is in ft, ρ is in lb/ft³, V is in ft/s, D is in ft.

So:

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * V²) / (2 D)

Plugging in the units:

( [ ] * ft * lb/ft³ * (ft/s)^2 ) / (ft) ) → (ft * lb/ft³ * ft²/s²) / ft → (ft * lb * ft² )/(ft³ * s² * ft) )) → lb/(ft * s²).

Hmm, but 1 lb/ft² is equal to (1 lb/(lbf * g)) ) * (lbf * g) / ft². Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute ΔP in psf and then convert to psi.

So, let's compute the value numerically.

First, f=0.013, L=17500 ft, ρ=0.0602 lb/ft³, V=128.6 ft/s, D=1.1667 ft.

ΔP = (0.013 * 17500 * 0.0602 * (128.6)^2 ) / (2 * 1.1667)

Calculate numerator:

0.013 *17500 = 227.5.

227.5 * 0.0602 ≈ 13.68.

128.6^2 = 16520.

13.68 * 16520 ≈ 226, 000.

Denominator: 2 * 1.1667 ≈ 2.333.

So ΔP ≈ 226,000 / 2.333 ≈ 97,000 lb/ft².

Wait, 1 psi is 12 inches of Hg, but more importantly, 1 psi is 12 lb/in², and since 1 ft² is 144 in², 1 psi = 144 lb/ft². So to convert ΔP from lb/ft² to psi, divide by 144.

So 97,000 lb/ft² = 97,000 / 144 ≈ 673 psi.

Wait, that's a huge pressure drop. 673 psi seems way too high because the end pressure is 17 psia. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations somewhere.

Wait, let's double-check the numbers.

Wait, the volumetric flow rate I calculated earlier as 138 ft³/s seems too high. Let me check that again.

n = 500 lb/min / 20 lb/lbmol = 25 lbmol/min → 25/60 ≈ 0.4167 lbmol/s.

Using PV = nRT, so V = nRT/P.

n is 0.4167 lbmol/s, R is 10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol·°R), T is 524.67 °R, P is 17 psia.

So V = (0.4167 * 10.7316 * 524.67) / 17.

Compute numerator: 0.4167 * 10.7316 ≈ 4.47. 4.47 * 524.67 ≈ 2347 ft³/s.

Wait, no, wait, that's not possible. Wait, no, wait, the calculation is Q = nRT/P.

Wait, n is in lbmol/s, R in psia-ft³/(lbmol·°R), T in °R, P in psia. So units should be ft³/s.

Yes, so 0.4167 * 10.7316 = ~4.47.

4.47 * 524.67 = ~2347.

Then 2347 / 17 ≈ 138 ft³/s. So that's correct. But 138 ft³/s is indeed a very high flow rate for a 14-inch pipe.

Wait, but a 14-inch pipe has a cross-sectional area of π*(14/24)^2 /4. Wait, 14 inches is 1.1667 ft. So radius is 0.5833 ft. Area is π*(0.5833)^2 ≈ 1.073 ft². So velocity V = Q/A = 138 / 1.073 ≈ 128.6 ft/s, which seems high but perhaps possible.

But then the pressure drop comes out to 673 psi, which is way higher than P2 of 17 psia, implying that the inlet pressure would need to be over 690 psia to have a 673 psi drop to 17 psia. That seems unrealistic, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should have used the upstream pressure P1 instead of P2 to calculate the density. Because if the pressure drop is 673 psi, then P1 is 690 psia, which would make the average pressure around 350 psia, so the density would be higher.

Let me try that. Let's assume that P1 is 17 + 673 = 690 psia. Then the average pressure is (690 +17)/2 = 353.5 psia.

Compute the density at average pressure: ρ = (P_avg * M) / (R T) = (353.5 * 20) / (10.7316 * 524
