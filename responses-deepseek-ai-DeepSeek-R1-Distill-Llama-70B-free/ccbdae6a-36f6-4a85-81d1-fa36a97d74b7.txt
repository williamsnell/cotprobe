We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.

Okay, so I've got this history question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully. The question is about Sukarno, the Indonesian leader, and his attempts to remain neutral during a certain conflict. The options are from A to J, each representing a different historical event.

The passage given is from Sukarno's keynote address at the Bandung Conference in 1955. He's talking about preserving peace and mentions the collective strength of Asia and Africa, which makes me think this is related to the Non-Aligned Movement. The Bandung Conference was a significant event where newly independent nations from Asia and Africa met to promote economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism.

The question states that Sukarno tried to maintain a neutral stance during a specific event but didn't completely succeed. So I need to match this to one of the options provided.

Looking at the options:

A: Indo-Pakistani Wars. These started after independence from Britain, with the first in 1947. Sukarno was Indonesian, so maybe not directly involved here.

B: Vietnam conflicts. This includes the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War. Indonesia might have had some involvement, but I'm not sure if Sukarno was trying to stay neutral in this.

C: Cold War. The Cold War was a global ideological conflict between the US and the USSR. Many Third World leaders, including Sukarno, were part of the Non-Aligned Movement, attempting to stay neutral and not take sides. That makes sense, but I need to make sure.

D: Arab-Israeli conflict. Sukarno supported Palestinian causes, but I'm not sure if he tried to be neutral here. Indonesia is a Muslim-majority country, so maybe they took a side.

E: Algerian War. This was between France and Algeria. Indonesia might have supported Algeria's independence, but I'm not certain about neutrality.

F: Cuban Missile Crisis. This was a direct confrontation between the US and USSR, but Sukarno's Indonesia wasn't directly involved. He might have called for peace, but I'm not sure if he tried to stay neutral in this specific crisis.

G: Iran-Iraq War. That happened much later, in the 80s, so Sukarno wouldn't have been involved as he died in 1970.

H: Korean War. This was in the early 50s. Indonesia was part of the non-aligned group, so maybe they tried to stay neutral.

I: Suez Crisis. 1956 crisis where Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt. Sukarno's Indonesia was part of the Afro-Asian group that opposed colonialism, so perhaps they took a side against the invaders rather than being neutral.

J: Gulf War. That's the 1990-91 conflict, way after Sukarno's time.

Wait, the question says Sukarno attempted but didn't completely succeed in maintaining a neutral stance. The context is the Bandung Conference, which was about non-alignment. So the Cold War makes sense because during that time, many leaders tried to avoid taking sides between the US and USSR.

But wait, another thought: Sukarno's Indonesia did get involved in some Cold War proxy conflicts. For example, in the 1960s, Indonesia shifted towards the Soviet bloc, but during the 1950s, Sukarno was promoting non-alignment. So maybe the correct answer is the Cold War, option C?

Alternatively, looking at the options again, the Korean War (H) and the Suez Crisis (I) are specific events. Sukarno was part of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, so the broader context is the Cold War.

Yes, I think the correct answer is C: the Cold War.

The question refers to Sukarno's efforts to maintain neutrality during a specific historical event. Sukarno, as an Indonesian leader, was a key figure in the Non-Aligned Movement, which emerged from the Bandung Conference in 1955. This movement sought to avoid taking sides in the ideological conflict between the US and the USSR during the Cold War. While Sukarno and other leaders attempted neutrality, they were often drawn into the broader geopolitical tensions of the time. Among the options provided, the Cold War is the most fitting answer, as it aligns with the context of the Non-Aligned Movement and Sukarno's efforts to remain neutral.

Answer: C
