Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about lifespan developmental theories, specifically Baltes’s Selective Optimization with Compensation theory. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that lifespan developmental theories look at development across the entire life span, from birth to old age. Unlike some theories that focus only on childhood, these consider all stages. Baltes's theory, I think, is one of those. I recall that his model is called Selective Optimization with Compensation, often abbreviated as SOC.

So the question is asking what these theories suggest. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option.

Option A says the theories focus solely on early childhood experiences. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Lifespan theories cover the whole life, so A is probably incorrect.

Option B suggests they focus mainly on psychopathology over time. No, that's more like psychodynamic or behavioral theories, not lifespan ones. So B is out.

Option C claims development is linear without decline. I think Baltes's theory actually includes the idea that there are both gains and losses. So development isn't just linear growth; there are declines too. So C is wrong.

Option D is all of the above, but since A, B, and C are incorrect, D can't be right.

Option E says they're mainly about cognitive development. Hmm, well, the SOC theory does touch on cognitive aspects but it's more general, covering various domains like emotional and social too. So E might not be the best fit.

Option F says they only account for biological influences. No, I remember that SOC considers both biological and environmental factors, so F is incorrect.

Option G describes development as a process of growth and decline. That sounds familiar. SOC theory talks about how people optimize their strengths (growth) and compensate for losses (declines), so G seems plausible.

Option H says it's decline and then growth, which doesn't fit. SOC is about both, but not in that specific order. So H is probably not right.

Option I claims development stops after adulthood. No, lifespan theories definitely include late adulthood, so I is wrong.

Option J says they don't account for environmental influences. But SOC does consider environment, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be G: Describe development as a process of growth (gain) and decline (loss).

The correct answer is G. Baltes’s Selective Optimization with Compensation theory describes development as involving both growth and decline, emphasizing how individuals adapt by optimizing strengths and compensating for losses throughout their lives.
