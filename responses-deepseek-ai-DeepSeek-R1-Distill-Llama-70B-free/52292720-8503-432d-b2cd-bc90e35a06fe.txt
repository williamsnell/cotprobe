Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the molar mass of tobacco seed globulin using some crystallography data. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that there's a formula that relates these kinds of data. Let me think...

Wait, the formula. Oh right, I think it's something like M = (density * unit cell volume * Avogadro's number) divided by the number of formula units per unit cell. Yeah, that sounds right. So the formula is M = (d * a³ * N_A) / Z, where d is density, a is the unit cell dimension, N_A is Avogadro's number, and Z is the number of formula units per unit cell.

But wait, let me make sure I get all the units right. The unit cell dimension is given in nanometers, 12.3 nm. I need to convert that to centimeters because the density is in g/cm³. Oh right, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, which is 1e-7 cm. So 12.3 nm is 12.3e-7 cm. Wait, wait—no, wait. Because 1 m is 100 cm, so 1 nm = 1e-9 m = 1e-7 cm. So yeah, 12.3 nm is 12.3e-7 cm. So a = 12.3e-7 cm.

Next, the unit cell is face-centered cubic. Oh, right, face-centered cubic means that each unit cell has Z = 4 formula units. Because in fcc, there's one at each corner and one on each face. Each corner atom contributes 1/8th per cube, and there are 8 corners, so 8*(1/8) = 1. Each face has one atom contributing 1/2 per cube, and there are 6 faces, so 6*(1/2)=3. So total is 4 per unit cell. So Z=4.

Density d is given as 1.287 g/cm³. Avogadro's number N_A is 6.022e23 mol⁻¹.

So plugging into the formula: M = (d * a³ * N_A) / Z.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute a³. a is 12.3e-7 cm. So a³ is (12.3e-7)^3 cm³.

Let me calculate that. 12.3 cubed is, let's see, 12^3 is 1728, 0.3^3 is 0.027. So 12.3^3 is approximately (12 + 0.3)^3. Let me compute it more accurately: 12.3 *12.3 = 151.29. Then 151.29 *12.3. Let me compute 151 *12.3. 150*12=1800, 150*0.3=45, so 1845. Plus 1*12.3=12.3, so 1857.3. Wait, but 151.29 *12.3: maybe I should do it more correctly.

Wait, 151.29 * 12.3 = ?

Let me compute 151.29 * 12 = 1815.48, and 151.29 * 0.3 = 45.387. Adding them gives 1860.867. So a³ is (12.3e-7)^3 = (12.3)^3 * (1e-7)^3 = 1860.867 * 1e-21 cm³. So a³ is 1.860867e-18 cm³? Wait, no. Wait, 1e-7 cubed is 1e-21. So 12.3^3 is 1860.867, so 1860.867e-21 cm³. Because (12.3e-7 cm)^3 is 12.3^3 * (e-7)^3 cm³. So 12.3^3 = 1860.867, so a³ = 1860.867e-21 cm³, which is 1.860867e-18 cm³.

Wait, no. 1e-7 is 10^-7, so (1e-7 cm)^3 is 1e-21 cm³. So 12.3e-7 cm is 1.23e-6 cm? Wait, no, 12.3e-7 cm is 1.23e-6 cm, but that's not directly relevant. So a³ = (12.3e-7 cm)^3 = (12.3)^3 * (e-7)^3 = 1860.867 * 1e-21 cm³. So 1860.867e-21 cm³ equals 1.860867e-18 cm³. So a³ = 1.860867e-18 cm³.

Now, multiply that by density d = 1.287 g/cm³. So d * a³ = 1.287 g/cm³ * 1.860867e-18 cm³. Let's compute that.

1.287 * 1.860867 ≈ let's see. 1 * 1.8608 is 1.8608, 0.287 *1.8608 is approximately 0.534. So total is about 2.3948. So 2.3948e-18 g. Hmm, but let me calculate it more accurately.

1.287 * 1.860867. Let me compute 1.2 *1.860867 = 2.2330404. 0.087 *1.860867 = approximately 0.161. So 2.233 + 0.161= ~2.394. So 2.394e-18 g.

Then multiply by Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 mol⁻¹. So:

2.394e-18 g * 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = (2.394 *6.022) e ( -18 +23 ) = (2.394 *6.022) e5.

Compute 2.394 *6.022. Let's approximate. 2 *6=12. 0.394 *6=2.364. So 12 + 2.364 =14.364. But 6.022 is a bit more than 6, so 2.394 *6.022 ≈ let's compute 2.394 *6 = 14.364, and 2.394 *0.022=0.0527. So total is about 14.4167.

So 14.4167e5 g/mol. But wait, no, because the exponents are e5 (since 1e5). So 14.4167e5 g/mol = 1.44167e6 g/mol? Wait, wait, no. Because 14.4167e5 is 1.44167e6. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't go that high.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no—because 2.394e-18 *6.022e23 = (2.394 *6.022) * 1e5.

Wait 2.394e-18 *6.022e23 = 2.394 *6.022 *1e5 (since 1e-18 *1e23=1e5).

So 2.394 *6.022 = let me compute it accurately.

2.394 *6 =14.364.

2.394 *0.022 = 0.052668.

So total is 14.364 + 0.052668 = 14.416668.

So 14.416668e5 g/mol. So 1.4416668e6 g/mol. Wait, but that's 1.44 million g/mol, which doesn't match any of the options. The options top out at about 7e5.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in computing Z. Oh wait, Z is the number of formula units per unit cell. For face-centered cubic, Z is 4. So I think that's correct.

Wait, let me try computing d*a³ again. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

d=1.287 g/cm³.

a=12.3e-7 cm.

a³ = (12.3e-7)^3 = (12.3)^3 * (1e-7)^3 = 1860.867 * 1e-21 cm³ = 1.860867e-18 cm³.

Multiply by density: 1.287 g/cm³ * 1.860867e-18 cm³ = 1.287 *1.860867e-18 g.

Let me compute 1.287 *1.860867.

1.287 * 1.860867. Let me compute this precisely:

1.287 × 1.860867:

Let me do it step by step:

1.287 ×1 = 1.287.

1.287 × 0.8 = 1.0296.

1.287 × 0.06 = 0.07722.

1.287 × 0.000867 ≈ approximately 0.001115.

Adding all together:

1.287 + 1.0296 = 2.3166.

2.3166 + 0.07722 = 2.39382.

2.39382 + 0.001115 ≈ 2.394935.

So 1.287 ×1.860867 ≈ 2.394935.

So d*a³ = 2.394935e-18 g.

Now multiply by Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 mol⁻¹: 

2.394935e-18 g *6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = (2.394935 *6.022) *1e5 g/mol.

Compute 2.394935 *6.022.

2 *6.022 =12.044.

0.394935 *6.022. Let's compute that.

0.3 *6.022=1.8066.

0.094935 *6.022≈0.094935 *6=0.56961, 0.094935 *0.022≈0.002087. So total 0.56961 + 0.002087≈0.5717.

So 1.8066 +0.5717=2.3783.

So 2.394935 *6.022 ≈ 12.044 +2.3783 =14.4223.

So 14.4223e5 g/mol. That's 1.44223e6 g/mol.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The highest option is F:7.22e5, which is way lower. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit cell volume calculation. Let me double-check the unit conversions. Oh wait, the unit cell is given in nm, which is 1e-9 meters. But 1 meter is 100 cm. So 1 nm = 1e-9 m = 1e-7 cm. So 12.3 nm is 12.3e-7 cm.

Wait, but 1 nm is 1e-9 m, which is 1e-7 cm, yes. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have considered the volume in cm³ correctly. So a is 12.3e-7 cm, so a³ is (12.3e-7)^3 cm³. That's 12.3^3 * (1e-7)^3 = 1860.867 * 1e-21 cm³ = 1.860867e-18 cm³. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in Z. Let me think again about face-centered cubic. Each corner atom contributes 1/8th and each face contributes 1/2. So 8*(1/8) =1, 6*(1/2)=3. So Z=4. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe the unit cell dimension is given in nm, and I missed a conversion factor. Let me recheck. Oh wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, which is 1e-7 cm because 1 m is 100 cm. So 12.3 nm is 12.3e-7 cm, correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I didn't convert the volume to m³ or something else. No, because the density is given in g/cm³, so volume needs to be in cm³. So all the units should be compatible.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again: Molar mass M = (d * a³ * N_A) / Z.

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps I should compute the numbers again more carefully.

Wait, let me compute a³ again:

a = 12.3e-7 cm.

a^3 = (12.3e-7)^3 = (12.3)^3 * (1e-7)^3 = 1860.867 * 1e-21 cm³ = 1.860867e-18 cm³.

d = 1.287 g/cm³.

So d * a³ = 1.287 * 1.860867e-18 = 2.39493e-18 g.

Multiply by Avogadro's number, 6.022e23:

2.39493e-18 *6.022e23 = (2.39493 *6.022) * 1e5.

2.39493 *6.022 = let me compute this precisely.

Let me compute 2 * 6.022 =12.044.

0.39493 *6.022: 

0.3 *6.022 =1.8066.

0.09493 *6.022: 0.09493 *6 =0.56958, 0.09493 *0.022≈0.002087. So 0.56958 +0.002087≈0.571667.

Adding 1.8066 +0.571667 =2.378267.

So total is 12.044 +2.378267 =14.422267.

So 14.422267e5 g/mol =1.4422267e6 g/mol. Which is about 1.44e6 g/mol. But looking at the options, the highest is F:7.22e5. So I'm way off. That suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the unit cell dimension was given in 12.3 nm, but I used it as 12.3e-7 cm. Let me double-check that conversion.

1 nm = 1e-9 m = 1e-7 cm. So 12.3 nm is 12.3e-7 cm. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I should have used 12.3 angstroms instead of nm? But the question says 12.3 nm, so no.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of a^3. Let me compute 12.3^3.

12.3 *12.3 = 151.29.

151.29 *12.3.

Let me compute 151.29 * 10 =1512.9, 151.29 *2=302.58, 151.29 *0.3=45.387.

Adding: 1512.9 + 302.58 =1815.48; +45.387=1860.867. So a^3 is correct as 1860.867e-21 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when converting a^3 to cm³. Let me think: 12.3e-7 cm is 1.23e-6 cm. So (1.23e-6 cm)^3 is (1.23)^3 * (1e-6)^3 cm³. 1.23^3 is approximately 1.860867, so 1.860867e-18 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M = (Z * Mw) = (d * a^3 * N_A)/n, where n is the number of molecules per unit cell. Wait, no, the formula is M = (d * a³ * N_A) / Z. So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the unit cell is in nm³ and I need to convert that to cm³ correctly. Let me compute the volume in cm³.

Wait, 1 nm = 1e-9 m = 1e-7 cm. So 1 nm³ is (1e-7 cm)^3 = 1e-21 cm³. So a^3 in cm³ is 12.3^3 * (1e-7 cm)^3 = 1860.867 * 1e-21 cm³ = 1.860867e-18 cm³. Correct.

Now, let me compute everything again more accurately.

d = 1.287 g/cm³.

a³ = 1.860867e-18 cm³.

d*a³ = 1.287 * 1.860867e-18 = let me calculate 1.287 *1.860867.

1.287 *1.860867:

Calculating it step by step:

1.287 * 1 = 1.287.

1.287 * 0.8 = 1.0296.

1.287 * 0.06 = 0.07722.

1.287 * 0.000867 = approximately 0.001115.

Adding all together:

1.287 + 1.0296 = 2.3166.

2.3166 + 0.07722 = 2.39382.

2.39382 + 0.001115 ≈2.394935.

So d*a³ =2.394935e-18 g.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.394935e-18 g *6.022e23 mol⁻¹.

2.394935e-18 *6.022e23 = (2.394935 *6.022) *1e5.

Compute 2.394935 *6.022.

I'll do it more accurately:

2.394935 ×6.022.

Let me compute 2 ×6.022 =12.044.

0.394935 ×6.022.

Compute 0.3 ×6.022 =1.8066.

0.094935 ×6.022.

0.09 ×6.022=0.54198.

0.004935 ×6.022≈0.02972.

So 0.54198 + 0.02972= 0.5717.

So 0.3
