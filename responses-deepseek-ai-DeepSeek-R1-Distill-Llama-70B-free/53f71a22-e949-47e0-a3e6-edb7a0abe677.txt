Question:

What happens to neurotransmitters once they have "done their job?"

Options:

A: Neurotransmitters diffuse away and are exhaled
B: Neurotransmitters are converted into cellular energy
C: Neurotransmitters replicate to enhance the initial signal
D: Neurotransmitters are destroyed
E: Neurotransmitters are released into the bloodstream
F: Neurotransmitters are used to build new synapses
G: Neurotransmitters remain active indefinitely
H: Neurotransmitters are stored in the cell nucleus for later use
I: Neurotransmitters are deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action
J: Neurotransmitters bond permanently to the receptors

Okay, so I have this question about neurotransmitters and what happens to them after they've done their job. Hmm, I remember that neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain that help transmit signals across synapses. So, when a neuron fires, it releases these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, the gap between two neurons.

Wait, what happens after they bind to the receptors? I think the signal transmission is over at that point, so the neurotransmitters must be dealt with somehow. I remember something about them being either taken back or broken down. Oh right, some neurotransmitters are taken back into the neuron that released them. That's called reuptake, isn't it? Like how serotonin and dopamine are reabsorbed. This helps terminate the signal because once they're taken back, they can't bind to the receptors anymore.

Alternatively, I think enzymes might break down some neurotransmitters. For example, acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. So the neurotransmitters are either taken back into the neuron or destroyed by enzymes. Both of these processes deactivate them so they don't keep sending signals.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option I says they're deactivated through reuptake or enzyme action. That sounds right. Option D says they're destroyed, which is partially correct but doesn't account for reuptake. Option A says diffuse away and exhaledâ€”no, that's not how it works. They're either reabsorbed or broken down locally. 

Option J says they bond permanently, which is wrong because then the signal wouldn't stop. Option G says they remain active indefinitely, which can't be right as signals need to be transient. So yeah, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is:

I: Neurotransmitters are deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action.

After neurotransmitters bind to receptors and transmit the signal, they are deactivated either by being reabsorbed (reuptake) into the neuron that released them or by being broken down by enzymes. This ensures the signal is terminated and prevents continuous activation. 

Answer: I
