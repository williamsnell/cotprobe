Okay, so I have this question about color and light, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that a piece of paper appears blue in sunlight. So, under normal daylight, the paper is blue. That makes sense because the paper probably reflects blue light and absorbs the other colors.

Now, the situation changes. The paper is illuminated solely by red light that's passed through a green filter. Wait, so the light source is red, but then it goes through a green filter. I remember that filters only let through their own color. So a green filter would allow green light to pass and block other colors. But wait, the light here is red. So if red light hits a green filter, what happens?

Wait a second, red and green are different colors. Red light has a longer wavelength, and green is medium. So if the filter is green, it won't let red light through because red isn't green. So the red light is blocked by the green filter. That means the light that actually illuminates the paper is... nothing? Because the red light can't pass through the green filter. So the resulting light is probably no light, or maybe just black because no light is getting through.

But wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The initial light is red. Then it's passed through a green filter. Since the filter only allows green, and the incoming light is red, which isn't green, the filter blocks it. So the light that comes out is zero, meaning the paper is in darkness.

So the paper is blue under sunlight because it reflects blue. But under this new light, which is effectively no light, the paper won't reflect any color. So it would appear black because there's no light hitting it to reflect.

Wait, but another angle: when you have colored objects, their color depends on the light they reflect. If the light source is only red, but the paper is blue, then under red light alone, the paper would appear black because it doesn't reflect red. But in this case, the red light is being filtered by green, so the light is blocked. So either way, it's dark.

So the answer should be black, which is option C.

The paper appears blue in sunlight because it reflects blue light while absorbing other colors. When illuminated by red light passed through a green filter, the green filter blocks the red light, allowing no light to reach the paper. Without any light to reflect, the paper appears black.
