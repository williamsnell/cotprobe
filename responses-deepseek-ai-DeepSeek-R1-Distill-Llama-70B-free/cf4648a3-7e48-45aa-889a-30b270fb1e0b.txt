Question:

Mr. Fields is considering selling a property acquired 15 years ago for $65,000; $10,000 was for the land, and $55,000 was for the building. Mr. Fields can now sell the property for $120,000. He can also keep it and continue to collect the annual rent from the building. If Mr. Fields decides to keep the property, he will keep it for another 25 years and will, at that time, sell it for $40,000. The annual rent receipts will be $5,930 for the next twenty-five years. Should Mr. Fields sell the property now or in twenty-five years? Assume that the building, but not the land, has been depreciated using the straight line method at 2%, long term gains are taxable at a rate of 25%, Mr. Fields' income tax rate is 56%, the minimum attractive rate of return after taxes is 2(1/2)%, and taxes will hold for the next 25 years. Make all calculations to the nearest dollar.

Options:

A: Mr. Fields should lease the property to a new tenant for a higher annual rent
B: Mr. Fields should sell the property now for $120,000
C: Mr. Fields should keep the property for 25 more years
D: Mr. Fields should convert the building into a personal residence
E: Mr. Fields should rent the property for another 15 years
F: Mr. Fields should sell the property after 10 years
G: Mr. Fields should renovate the property and then decide whether to sell or keep it
H: Mr. Fields should exchange the property for a similar one to defer taxes
I: Mr. Fields should hold the property indefinitely for future generations
J: Mr. Fields should donate the property to a charitable organization for a tax write-off

Okay, I need to figure out whether Mr. Fields should sell his property now or keep it for another 25 years. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the property was bought 15 years ago for $65,000, with $10k for the land and $55k for the building. Now, he can sell it for $120k. If he keeps it, he'll get annual rent of $5,930 for 25 years and then sell it for $40k. 

I remember that when dealing with such decisions, I should calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of both options: selling now and selling later. The option with the higher NPV is better.

But wait, taxes are involved, so I have to consider tax implications. The building has been depreciated using straight-line at 2% per year. That means each year, depreciation was $55,000 * 2% = $1,100. Over 15 years, total depreciation is 15 * $1,100 = $16,500.

Depreciation affects taxes because it's a non-cash expense. When he sells, the tax basis of the building will be adjusted for depreciation. The original cost was $55k, so the book value after 15 years is $55k - $16,500 = $38,500.

If he sells now, the selling price is $120k. But the land and building are treated differently. The land doesn't depreciate, so its basis remains $10k. The building's basis is $38,500. So the total tax basis is $10k + $38,500 = $48,500.

The sale price is $120k, so the gain is $120k - $48,500 = $71,500. Since this is a long-term gain (held over a year), it's taxed at 25%. So tax on sale now is 25% of $71,500 = $17,875.

Now, calculating the after-tax proceeds from selling now: $120k - $17,875 = $102,125.

If he keeps the property, he'll collect rent each year for 25 years. But I need to account for taxes on the rent and depreciation. Also, when he sells in 25 years, there will be taxes on that sale.

Wait, let me think. Each year, he gets $5,930 rent. But he can deduct depreciation and operating expenses. Wait, the problem says the building is depreciated, but are there other expenses? The problem doesn't mention any, so maybe we only consider depreciation as an expense.

Depreciation per year is $1,100 (since it's 2% of $55k). So each year, taxable income from the property is rent minus depreciation: $5,930 - $1,100 = $4,830.

Income tax on that is 56% of $4,830. Let me calculate that: 0.56 * 4,830 ≈ $2,704.80 per year. So his after-tax cash flow from rent each year is $5,930 - $2,704.80 = $3,225.20.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no. The $5,930 is rent received, which is income. He can deduct the depreciation expense ($1,100) from that, so taxable income per year is $5,930 - $1,100 = $4,830. Then, he pays 56% tax on that: $4,830 * 0.56 ≈ $2,704.80. So his net cash inflow each year is $5,930 (rent) minus $2,704.80 (tax) = $3,225.20. But wait, that seems low. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as after-tax cash flow.

Alternatively, the formula for after-tax cash flow from operations is: (Rent - Operating Expenses) * (1 - tax rate) + Depreciation * tax rate. Because depreciation is a non-cash expense, so you get a tax shield. Wait, maybe I should model it correctly.

The correct after-tax cash flow formula is:

After-tax cash flow = (Rent + Depreciation) * (1 - tax rate) - Depreciation

Wait no, the formula is: 

EBIT = Rent - Operating Expenses - Depreciation (but here, there are no operating expenses mentioned except depreciation). So taxable income is Rent - Depreciation. Taxes are (Rent - Depreciation) * tax rate. So after-tax income is (Rent - Depreciation) * (1 - tax rate). Then, add back depreciation because it's non-cash, so cash flow becomes:

After-tax cash flow = (Rent - Depreciation) * (1 - tax rate) + Depreciation

Which simplifies to Rent*(1 - tax rate) + Depreciation * tax rate.

So plugging in the numbers:

Rent is $5,930. Depreciation is $1,100. Tax rate is 56%.

So after-tax cash flow per year is:

5,930*(1 - 0.56) + 1,100*0.56

Calculating each part:

5,930 * 0.44 = 2,609.2

1,100 * 0.56 = 616

Total after-tax cash flow per year: 2,609.2 + 616 = $3,225.2 per year. So about $3,225 each year.

Now, he will keep the property for 25 more years, so we have 25 years of this cash flow. Plus, at the end of 25 years, he'll sell it for $40k. But we need to calculate the tax on that sale.

At the time of sale in 25 years, the building's basis will be the original $55k minus 25 years of depreciation. Wait, wait, he's already depreciated it for 15 years. So in the next 25 years, he'll depreciate it for another 25 years at 2% per year.

Wait, but the building's useful life under straight-line is 50 years (since 2% = 1/50). So after 15 years, 35 years remain. But he's keeping it for 25 more years, which would take total depreciation to 40 years. Wait, that's impossible because the useful life is 50 years. So he can depreciate for 25 more years, but the remaining basis after 15 years is $38,500. Let me think: each year, depreciation is 2% of $55k, which is $1,100 per year. So for 25 more years, depreciation is 25 * $1,100 = $27,500. So the building's book value after 40 years (15+25) would be $55k - 40*$1,100 = $55k - $44k = $11k. But when he sells it for $40k, the land's basis is $10k (unchanged), and the building's basis is $11k. So total tax basis is $21k. Selling price is $40k, so gain is $40k - $21k = $19k. Tax on that gain is 25% * $19k = $4,750.

But wait, the sale is in 25 years. So the after-tax proceeds from the sale would be $40k (selling price) minus $4,750 (tax) = $35,250.

So now, the total cash flows for keeping the property are:

- Each year for 25 years: $3,225.20

- At year 25: $35,250

We need to find the present value (PV) of these cash flows at the minimum attractive rate of return after taxes, which is 2.5% (I think that's 2.5%, as 2(1/2)% is 2.5%).

The PV of the annual cash flows is an annuity. The formula for the PV of an annuity is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

Where PMT is $3,225.20, r is 2.5% or 0.025, n is 25.

Calculating that:

First, compute (1.025)^-25. Let me approximate that. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula.

Let me compute the present value factor:

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

Plugging in r=0.025, n=25.

So (1.025)^25 ≈ Let me compute that. 1.025^25.

I can compute it as e^(25*ln(1.025)).

ln(1.025) ≈ 0.02469

25 * 0.02469 ≈ 0.6173

e^0.6173 ≈ 1.853. So 1.025^25 ≈ 1.853.

Thus, 1/(1.025)^25 ≈ 1/1.853 ≈ 0.5398.

So PVIFA = (1 - 0.5398)/0.025 ≈ (0.4602)/0.025 ≈ 18.408.

So PV of the annual cash flows is $3,225.20 * 18.408 ≈ Let me compute that.

3,225.20 * 18.408. Let's see:

3,000 * 18.408 = 55,224

225.20 * 18.408 ≈ 225 * 18 = 4,050, and 225 * 0.408≈91.8 → ~4,141.8

Total ≈ 55,224 + 4,141.8 ≈ 59,365.8

Then, the PV of the sale proceeds in 25 years is $35,250 / (1.025)^25 ≈ 35,250 * 0.5398 ≈ Let's compute that.

35,000 * 0.5398 ≈ 35,000 * 0.5 = 17,500; 35,000 * 0.0398≈1,393 → total ≈18,893.

250 * 0.5398≈135. So total ≈18,893 + 135 = $19,028.

Adding the two PVs: $59,365.8 + $19,028 ≈ $78,393.8.

Now, the PV of keeping is approximately $78,394.

Now, compare that to selling now. If he sells now, he gets after-tax proceeds of $102,125.

So which is larger? $102,125 now versus $78,394 in PV for keeping.

Since $102k is larger than $78k, it's better to sell now.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because they're a bit involved.

Wait, when he sells now, he gets $120k, pays tax of $17,875, so after-tax is $102,125. Correct.

When he keeps, he gets $3,225.20 per year for 25 years, PV is about $59,366, plus $35,250 at year 25, PV $19,028. Total PV $78,394.

So selling now gives $102k, which is higher than $78k. So he should sell now.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the tax calculation when selling later. Let me recheck.

When he sells in 25 years, the building's basis is $55k - (15+25)*$1,100 = $55k - 40*$1,100 = $55k - $44k = $11k.

Land basis is $10k, so total basis $21k.

Selling price is $40k, so gain is $40k - $21k = $19k. Tax is 25% of that, which is $4,750. So after-tax proceeds are $40k - $4,750 = $35,250. That part seems correct.

Another thing to check: the after-tax cash flow calculation. I used the formula correctly, so that's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total cash flows without discounting, but that's not correct because we need to compare present values.

Wait, another way to look at it: the NPV of keeping is $78,394, and the NPV of selling now is $102,125. Since $102k is higher, he should sell now.

Looking at the options, option B says sell now for $120k.

So the correct answer should be B.
</think>

To determine whether Mr. Fields should sell the property now or keep it for another 25 years, we need to compare the Net Present Value (NPV) of both options. The option with the higher NPV is preferable.

### **Option 1: Sell the Property Now**
- **Selling Price**: $120,000  
- **Tax Basis**:  
  - Land: $10,000 (unchanged)  
  - Building: $55,000 - ($55,000 * 2% * 15) = $38,500  
  - Total Tax Basis: $10,000 + $38,500 = $48,500  
- **Gain on Sale**: $120,000 - $48,500 = $71,500  
- **Tax on Sale**: 25% of $71,500 = $17,875  
- **After-Tax Proceeds**: $120,000 - $17,875 = **$102,125**

### **Option 2: Keep the Property for 25 More Years**
#### Annual Cash Flows
- **Rent**: $5,930/year  
- **Depreciation**: $1,100/year (2% of $55,000)  
- **Taxable Income**: $5,930 - $1,100 = $4,830/year  
- **Income Tax**: 56% of $4,830 = $2,704.80/year  
- **After-Tax Cash Flow**: $5,930 - $2,704.80 = **$3,225.20/year**

#### Sale in 25 Years
- **Selling Price**: $40,000  
- **Building Basis**: $55,000 - ($55,000 * 2% * 40) = $11,000  
- **Land Basis**: $10,000  
- **Total Tax Basis**: $10,000 + $11,000 = $21,000  
- **Gain on Sale**: $40,000 - $21,000 = $19,000  
- **Tax on Sale**: 25% of $19,000 = $4,750  
- **After-Tax Proceeds**: $40,000 - $4,750 = **$35,250**

#### Present Value (PV) of Future Cash Flows
- **Discount Rate**: 2.5%  
- **PV of Annual Cash Flows**:  
  Using the Present Value of Annuity Formula:  
  \[
  PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
  \]  
  Where \(PMT = 3,225.20\), \(r = 0.025\), and \(n = 25\).  
  \[
  PV = 3,225.20 \times \frac{1 - (1.025)^{-25}}{0.025} \approx 3,225.20 \times 18.408 \approx 59,366
  \]  
- **PV of Sale Proceeds in 25 Years**:  
  \[
  PV = \frac{35,250}{(1.025)^{25}} \approx 35,250 \times 0.5398 \approx 19,028
  \]  
- **Total PV of Keeping the Property**:  
  \[
  59,366 + 19,028 \approx 78,394
  \]

### **Comparison**
- **Sell Now**: $102,125  
- **Keep for 25 Years**: $78,394  

Since the after-tax proceeds from selling now ($102,125) are greater than the PV of keeping the property ($78,394), Mr. Fields should sell the property now.

### **Answer**
**B: Mr. Fields should sell the property now for $120,000**
