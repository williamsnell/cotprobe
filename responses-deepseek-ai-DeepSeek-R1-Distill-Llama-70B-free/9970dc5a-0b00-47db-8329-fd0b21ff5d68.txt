Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about calculating the minimum sample size needed for a confidence interval. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that confidence intervals relate to how confident we are that our sample statistics reflect the true population parameters. 

The question says a polling organization wants a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error no more than 2.5%. They're trying to predict the proportion of voters for each candidate. So, I think this involves the formula for the confidence interval for a proportion.

Wait, right, the formula for the margin of error (ME) for a proportion is ME = z * sqrt[(p*(1-p))/n], where z is the z-score corresponding to the confidence level. Since it's a 95% confidence interval, I should find the z-score for that. I recall that for 95%, the z-score is approximately 1.96. Yeah, that's right.

So the formula rearranged to solve for n (sample size) would be n = (z^2 * p*(1-p)) / (ME)^2. But wait, what value do I use for p? Since p is the proportion of voters for a candidate, and we don't know it in advance, I think the most conservative approach is to use p=0.5 because that's where the variance p(1-p) is maximized. Oh right, because at p=0.5, the product p(1-p) is 0.25, which is the highest possible value. So using p=0.5 ensures that the sample size is sufficient for any possible p.

Alright, plugging in the numbers. z is 1.96, p is 0.5, and ME is 2.5%, which is 0.025 in decimal.

So, n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / (0.025)^2.

Calculating step by step. Let's compute each part.

First, 1.96 squared. 1.96 * 1.96 is approximately 3.8416.

Next, 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25.

Multiply those together: 3.8416 * 0.25 = 0.9604.

Now, the denominator is (0.025)^2. 0.025 squared is 0.000625.

So now, n = 0.9604 / 0.000625.

Let me compute that. 0.9604 divided by 0.000625. Hmm, I can think of 0.000625 as 1/1600, so dividing by 0.000625 is the same as multiplying by 1600. So 0.9604 * 1600.

Let me compute that. 0.9604 * 1600. Let's see: 0.96 *1600 is 1536, and 0.0004*1600 is 0.64. So total is 1536.64. Since sample size has to be an integer and we need the margin of error to be no more than 2.5%, we round up to the next whole number.

So n should be 1537. Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 1537. But wait, another thought: sometimes when you use p=0.5, the calculation gives a certain n, but perhaps using a slightly different approach or rounding during the calculation might change that. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1.96^2 is exactly 3.8416. 3.8416 * 0.25 = 0.9604. 0.9604 divided by 0.000625 is indeed 1536.64. Rounding up gives 1537, which is option H. But wait, another thing: sometimes the formula might use (ME/2)^2, but no, in this case, I think I handled it correctly. Because the formula for the margin of error is z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n), so when solving for n, it's z^2 * p(1-p) / (ME)^2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 1537, but I'm seeing that option D is 1536. Oh, because sometimes calculations might round differently. So 1536.64 would be 1537 when rounded up, which is option H. But wait, maybe I should check if 1536 is sufficient or if it's less than required.

Wait, let's test n=1536. Plug it back into the margin of error formula.

ME = z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n) = 1.96 * sqrt(0.25/1536)

Compute 0.25 / 1536 = 0.00016276. The square root of that is sqrt(0.00016276). Let's see, sqrt(0.0001) is 0.01, and sqrt(0.00016276) is approximately 0.01276.

Multiply by 1.96: 0.01276 *1.96 ≈ 0.025. So the ME is about 2.5% as desired. So n=1536 would give exactly ME=2.5%, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, n must be at least 1536. So why is 1537 an option?

Wait, perhaps because when calculating n, the formula gives 1536.64, which we round up to 1537. But since 1536 gives exactly 2.5%, perhaps in some cases, 1536 is acceptable. Hmm, perhaps it's a matter of convention whether to round up or take the ceiling. Because 1536.64 is more than 1536, so you need 1537 to ensure the margin of error doesn't exceed 2.5%.

Wait, let's compute more accurately. Let me calculate sqrt(0.25/1536). 0.25/1536 is 1/6144. sqrt(1/6144) is 1/78.38 approximately, because 78^2 is 6084, 78.38^2 is about 6144. So 1/78.38 ≈ 0.01276.

1.96 * 0.01276 ≈ 0.025. So n=1536 gives ME=2.5% exactly. So perhaps in that case, 1536 would be sufficient. But the formula gives n=1536.64, so the minimum integer n is 1537. Wait, no, because if n=1536 gives exactly 2.5% margin of error, then n=1536 would satisfy the condition of ME no more than 2.5%. So then why do we need 1537?

Wait, perhaps in the way the formula is applied. Let me think again. The formula gives n = (1.96)^2 * 0.25 / (0.025)^2 = (3.8416 * 0.25) / 0.000625 = 0.9604 / 0.000625 = 1536.64. So n must be greater than or equal to 1536.64. Since n must be an integer, we round up to 1537. Therefore, the minimum sample size is 1537, which is option H.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 1536 and option H is 1537. So the correct answer would be H, 1537.

But in some textbooks, they might take the floor or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Is the formula correct? Yes, the formula for sample size when estimating a single proportion is n = (z^2 * p(1-p)) / E^2, where E is the margin of error. And p=0.5 is used because it's the worst case. So yes.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 1537, which is option H.

To determine the minimum sample size needed for a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5%, we use the formula for the margin of error (ME) for a proportion:

\[
\text{ME} = z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( n \), the sample size:

\[
n = \frac{z^2 \cdot p(1-p)}{\text{ME}^2}
\]

Here:
- \( z = 1.96 \) (the z-score for a 95% confidence interval),
- \( \text{ME} = 0.025 \) (2.5% margin of error in decimal form),
- \( p = 0.5 \) (the proportion, assumed to be 0.5 because it maximizes the variance \( p(1-p) \)).

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5}{0.025^2}
\]

1. Compute \( 1.96^2 = 3.8416 \),
2. Compute \( 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 \),
3. Multiply \( 3.8416 \cdot 0.25 = 0.9604 \),
4. Compute \( 0.025^2 = 0.000625 \),
5. Divide \( 0.9604 / 0.000625 = 1536.64 \).

Since the sample size \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to ensure the margin of error does not exceed 2.5%. Thus, \( n = 1537 \).

From the given options:
- Option D is 1536, which is insufficient because it does not account for the fractional part (0.64).
- Option H is 1537, which is the correct minimum sample size.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: 1537**
