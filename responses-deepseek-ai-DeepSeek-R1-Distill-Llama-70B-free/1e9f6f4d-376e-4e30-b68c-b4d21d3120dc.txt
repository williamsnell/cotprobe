Okay, so I've got this problem about vector spaces and subspaces, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down what the question is asking.

The vector space V is given as the space of real polynomials of degree at most 3. I remember that for polynomials, the dimension of the space is one more than the maximum degree because you have coefficients from x^0 up to x^3. So for degree 3, the dimension should be 4. Like, the basis would be {1, x, x², x³}, which has four elements. So dim V is 4.

Now, W is a subspace of V. The subspace consists of all polynomials p(x) in V such that p(0) = 0, p(1) = 0, and p(-1) = 0. So each of these is a condition that the polynomial must satisfy. I'm thinking about how these conditions affect the dimension of W.

Each condition p(a) = 0 is a linear equation because evaluating a polynomial at a point is a linear operation. So for each condition, we're imposing a linear constraint on the coefficients of the polynomial.

Let me think about how many constraints there are. We have three conditions: p(0)=0, p(1)=0, p(-1)=0. So that's three equations. Since V is a 4-dimensional space, if these conditions are independent, the dimension of W would be dim V minus the number of independent constraints. So 4 - 3 = 1. But wait, I need to make sure that these constraints are indeed linearly independent.

Another approach is to construct a basis for W. Let me denote a general polynomial in V as p(x) = a + b x + c x² + d x³. Now applying the conditions:

1. p(0) = 0: Plugging in x=0, p(0) = a = 0. So a must be zero.

2. p(1) = 0: Plugging in x=1, we get a + b + c + d = 0. But since a=0, this becomes b + c + d = 0.

3. p(-1) = 0: Plugging in x=-1, a - b + c - d = 0. Again, a=0, so -b + c - d = 0.

So now we have two equations:

Equation 1: b + c + d = 0
Equation 2: -b + c - d = 0

Let me write them together:

b + c + d = 0
-b + c - d = 0

I can add these two equations to eliminate b and d. Adding them:

( b - b ) + (c + c) + (d - d) = 0 + 0 → 0 + 2c + 0 = 0 → 2c=0 → c=0.

Substituting c=0 into the first equation:

b + 0 + d = 0 → b + d = 0 → d = -b.

So now, our polynomial is p(x) = 0 + b x + 0 x² + d x³, and d=-b. So substituting d:

p(x) = b x - b x³ = b(x - x³).

So the only polynomials in W are scalar multiples of (x - x³). That suggests that W is one-dimensional because any such p(x) can be written as a multiple of this single basis vector. Therefore, dim W is 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I did everything correctly. So we started with a 4-dimensional space V. The conditions gave us three constraints, but when solving, we found that two of them led to c=0 and d=-b, but a=0 regardless. So how many free variables are left? It looks like only b is free because once you choose b, d is determined as -b, and a and c are zero. So the dimension of W is 1.

So now, the question asks for dim V + dim W. We have dim V =4, dim W=1. So 4+1=5.

Looking at the options, option G is 5. So the answer should be G.

The vector space \( V \) consists of real polynomials of degree at most 3. The dimension of \( V \) is 4 because the basis for such polynomials is \(\{1, x, x^2, x^3\}\), which has 4 elements. Thus, \(\dim V = 4\).

The subspace \( W \) is defined as the set of polynomials \( p(x) \in V \) such that \( p(0) = 0 \), \( p(1) = 0 \), and \( p(-1) = 0 \). Each of these conditions imposes a linear constraint on the coefficients of the polynomial. Writing a general polynomial in \( V \) as \( p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 \), the conditions become:

1. \( p(0) = 0 \): This implies \( a = 0 \).
2. \( p(1) = 0 \): Substituting \( x = 1 \), we get \( a + b + c + d = 0 \). Since \( a = 0 \), this simplifies to \( b + c + d = 0 \).
3. \( p(-1) = 0 \): Substituting \( x = -1 \), we get \( a - b + c - d = 0 \). Since \( a = 0 \), this simplifies to \( -b + c - d = 0 \).

From these two equations:
\[
b + c + d = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad -b + c - d = 0,
\]
adding them eliminates \( b \) and \( d \), yielding \( 2c = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \). Substituting \( c = 0 \) into \( b + c + d = 0 \), we get \( b + d = 0 \), or \( d = -b \).

Thus, the polynomial can be written as \( p(x) = b(x - x^3) \), where \( b \) is a free parameter. This shows that \( W \) is one-dimensional, with a basis \(\{x - x^3\}\). Therefore, \(\dim W = 1\).

Finally, the problem asks for \(\dim V + \dim W\). Since \(\dim V = 4\) and \(\dim W = 1\), we have \(\dim V + \dim W = 4 + 1 = 5\).

From the given options, the correct answer is **G: 5**.
