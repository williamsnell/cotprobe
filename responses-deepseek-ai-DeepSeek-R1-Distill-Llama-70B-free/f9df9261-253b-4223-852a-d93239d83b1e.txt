Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the diffusion of gases and where a solid forms in a tube. Hmm, I remember that when two gases diffuse towards each other, the distance where they meet depends on their rates of diffusion. The faster one will have traveled more distance.

Wait, the problem says that NH3 and HX are injected into opposite ends of a 1m glass tube. When they meet, they form NH4X(s). So I need to find where along the tube this deposit forms, specifically for HX being HF and HCl.

I think the key here is Graham's Law of Effusion, which relates the rate of diffusion to the molar mass. Graham's Law says that the rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So the gas with the lower molar mass diffuses faster.

Let me figure out the molar masses. NH3 has a molar mass of 14 (N) + 3(1) = 17 g/mol. For HX, X is a halogen. HF is H (1) + F (19) = 20 g/mol. HCl is H (1) + Cl (35.5) = 36.5 g/mol.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because the gases here are NH3 and HX. So their molar masses are 17 and 20 for HF, and 17 and 36.5 for HCl.

So for each part, a) when HX is HF, and b) when HX is HCl.

The formula I remember is that the distance each gas travels is proportional to their rates of diffusion. Since they meet when the sum of the distances is 1m, we can model this as:

distance NH3 travels / distance HX travels = (rate of NH3) / (rate of HX) = sqrt(Mw of HX / Mw of NH3)

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The ratio of their rates is equal to the ratio of their distances. Because if one gas is faster, it will have traveled more distance when they meet.

So let me denote d_NH3 as the distance from the NH3 end where the deposit forms. The other distance, from the HX end, would be (100 - d_NH3) cm since the tube is 1m (100 cm) long.

The rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. So Rate NH3 / Rate HX = sqrt( M_HX / M_NH3 )

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The rate is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. So, rate NH3 = k / sqrt(M_NH3), rate HX = k / sqrt(M_HX), where k is a constant.

So the ratio rate_NH3 / rate_HX = sqrt( M_HX / M_NH3 )

But how does this relate to the distances?

The time it takes for the gases to meet should be the same for both. So, the distance each travels is proportional to their rate. So,

d_NH3 / d_HX = rate_NH3 / rate_HX

But d_NH3 + d_HX = 100 cm.

So substituting, d_NH3 = (rate_NH3 / rate_HX) * d_HX

Hmm. Alternatively, since d_NH3 / d_HX = rate NH3 / rate HX, and from the rates,

rate NH3 = k / sqrt(M_NH3) and rate HX = k / sqrt(M_HX), so their ratio is sqrt(M_HX / M_NH3 )

So d_NH3 / d_HX = sqrt(M_HX / M_NH3 )

But since d_NH3 + d_HX = 100,

Let me set d_HX = x, so d_NH3 = 100 - x.

Then (100 - x)/x = sqrt( M_HX / M_NH3 )

Let me rearrange this:

(100 - x)/x = sqrt(M_HX) / sqrt(M_NH3 )

So (100 - x) / x = sqrt( (M_HX) / (M_NH3) )

Let me solve for x, which is the distance from the HX end. Or wait, wait. Because d_NH3 is from the NH3 end, and d_HX is from the HX end. So when I solve for x, that's the distance from HX end, so the position from NH3 end is (100 - x) cm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to represent this as:

Let me define x as the distance from NH3 end where the deposit forms. Then the distance from the HX end is (100 - x) cm.

The ratio of distances is x/(100 - x) = rate NH3 / rate HX.

Which is x/(100 - x) = sqrt(M_HX / M_NH3 )

So for each HX, I can compute x.

Let's do part a) first: HX is HF, so M_HX = 20 g/mol.

M_NH3 is 17.

So,

x/(100 - x) = sqrt(20 / 17 )

Calculate that sqrt(20/17) is approximately sqrt(1.176) ≈ 1.084.

So x/(100 - x) ≈ 1.084. Let's solve for x.

x = 1.084 (100 - x )

x = 108.4 - 1.084 x

x + 1.084 x = 108.4

2.084 x = 108.4

x = 108.4 / 2.084 ≈ let's calculate that.

Hmm, 108.4 / 2.084.

Well, 2.084 * 52 = approx 108.368. Because 2 *52=104, 0.084 *52≈4.368. So 104+4.368=108.368. So 52.0 would give us x ≈52 cm, but wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, 2.084 * 52 = 2*52 =104, 0.084*52=4.368, so 104 +4.368=108.368, which is just a little under 108.4. So 52 gives us 108.368, which is 108.4-108.368=0.032 less. So perhaps 52.0 cm would give us 108.368, so to get 108.4, we need a little more than 52. Let me compute 52.0 *2.084= 108.368, as above. So 108.4 is 0.032 higher. So each 1 cm adds 2.084 to the left side. So 0.032 /2.084≈0.0153 cm. So x≈52.015 cm. Approximately 52.02 cm from the NH3 end.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have 52 for HF. Let me check the options again.

Options for a) HF and b) HCl:

Looking at the options:

Option F: 45.50 cm for HF, 50.23 for HCl.

Option G: 47.50 for HF, 52.50 for HCl.

Option H: 52.03 for HF, 59.56 for HCl.

Wait, so for part a), when HX is HF, x is approximately 52 cm. Looking at the options for a), H's a) is 52.03 cm, which is very close to our calculation. So that would be part a) 52.03 cm, which is option H.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. Because I might have mixed up the ratio.

Wait, the correct formula is x/(100 -x) = sqrt(M_HX / M_NH3 )

Wait, let me compute sqrt(20/17)=sqrt(1.17647)≈1.08416.

So x/(100-x) = 1.08416

So x = 1.08416*(100-x)

x =108.416 -1.08416 x

x +1.08416 x =108.416

2.08416 x=108.416

x=108.416/2.08416 ≈ let's compute this.

108.416 divided by 2.08416.

Let me approximate 2.08416 ≈2.0842.

Compute 108.416 /2.0842:

2.0842 *52 = 108.3984, as before.

108.416-108.3984=0.0176.

So 0.0176 /2.0842≈0.00845 cm additional. So x≈52.00845 cm → approximately 52.01 cm.

So for part a), x≈52.01 cm.

Now, part b) HX is HCl.

M_HX =36.5 g/mol.

Compute sqrt(36.5/17)=sqrt(2.147)≈1.465.

So x/(100-x)=1.465 → x=1.465*(100-x)

x=146.5 -1.465 x

x +1.465x=146.5 → 2.465 x=146.5 → x=146.5/2.465 ≈ let's compute.

2.465 * 59 = let's see: 2.465 *60=147.9 → which is larger than 146.5. So 2.465 *59=?

2.465 *50=123.25; 2.465 *9=22.185 → total 123.25+22.185=145.435.

146.5-145.435=1.065.

So 1.065 /2.465≈0.432 cm.

So x≈59.432 cm.

So x≈59.43 cm.

Looking at the options, for part b), HCl is expecting around 59.56 cm. Option H for part b) is 59.56 cm. So option H has a) 52.03 and b)59.56, which matches our calculations.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the distance from the NH₃ injection end where NH₄X(s) forms, we use the relationship between the rates of diffusion of NH₃ and HX. According to Graham's Law of Effusion, the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. The ratio of the distances traveled by the two gases is equal to the ratio of their rates of diffusion:

\[
\frac{d_{\text{NH}_3}}{d_{\text{HX}}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{HX}}}{M_{\text{NH}_3}}}
\]

Here, \(d_{\text{NH}_3}\) is the distance from the NH₃ end, and \(d_{\text{HX}}\) is the distance from the HX end. Since the total length of the tube is 100 cm, we have:

\[
d_{\text{NH}_3} + d_{\text{HX}} = 100 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Part (a): HX = HF
The molar mass of NH₃ is \(M_{\text{NH}_3} = 17 \, \text{g/mol}\), and the molar mass of HF is \(M_{\text{HF}} = 20 \, \text{g/mol}\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{d_{\text{NH}_3}}{d_{\text{HF}}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{HF}}}{M_{\text{NH}_3}}} = \sqrt{\frac{20}{17}} \approx 1.084
\]

Let \(d_{\text{NH}_3} = x\). Then \(d_{\text{HF}} = 100 - x\), and:

\[
\frac{x}{100 - x} = 1.084
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 1.084(100 - x)
\]

\[
x + 1.084x = 108.4
\]

\[
2.084x = 108.4
\]

\[
x = \frac{108.4}{2.084} \approx 52.01 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the deposit forms approximately **52.01 cm** from the NH₃ end when HX is HF.

### Part (b): HX = HCl
The molar mass of HCl is \(M_{\text{HCl}} = 36.5 \, \text{g/mol}\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{d_{\text{NH}_3}}{d_{\text{HCl}}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{HCl}}}{M_{\text{NH}_3}}} = \sqrt{\frac{36.5}{17}} \approx 1.465
\]

Let \(d_{\text{NH}_3} = x\). Then \(d_{\text{HCl}} = 100 - x\), and:

\[
\frac{x}{100 - x} = 1.465
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 1.465(100 - x)
\]

\[
x + 1.465x = 146.5
\]

\[
2.465x = 146.5
\]

\[
x = \frac{146.5}{2.465} \approx 59.43 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the deposit forms approximately **59.43 cm** from the NH₃ end when HX is HCl.

### Final Answer
From the calculations, the distances are approximately **52.01 cm for HF** and **59.43 cm for HCl**, which matches **Option H**.

H: 52.03 cm for HF, 59.56 cm for HCl

Answer: H
