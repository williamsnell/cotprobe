Question:

Two alternatives for interconnecting a set of processors with bidirectional links are (1) the fully interconnected network, in which each processor is directly connected to every other processor, and (2) the ring network, in which each processor is connected to two other processors. The worst-case path length for a network is the maximum, over all pairs of nodes in the network, of the minimum length paths (measured in number of links) between the nodes. For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is

Okay, so I've got this question about interconnecting processors, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is comparing two types of networks: a fully interconnected network and a ring network. For each, I need to calculate the figure of merit, which is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length. Then, find the ratio of this figure for the fully connected network compared to the ring network when n is even and greater than 2.

First, let's think about each network type.

Starting with the fully interconnected network. In this setup, every processor is directly connected to every other processor. So, how many links are there in total? Well, each processor connects to n-1 others. But wait, that counts each link twice because if processor A is connected to B, that's one link, not two. So the total number of links should be n*(n-1)/2. That makes sense because it's the formula for combinations, choosing 2 processors out of n.

As for the worst-case path length in a fully connected network, since every pair is directly connected, the path length between any two nodes is just 1. So the maximum path (the worst case) is 1.

So the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network is the number of links multiplied by the worst-case path. That would be [n(n-1)/2] * 1, which simplifies to n(n-1)/2.

Now, moving on to the ring network. Each processor is connected to exactly two others, forming a circle. So the number of links here should be equal to the number of processors, right? Because each link connects two processors, and there are n processors in a ring, so n links in total.

What's the worst-case path length in a ring? Well, the maximum distance between any two nodes would be when you have to go around the ring the long way. Since it's a ring, the path can go clockwise or counterclockwise, and the longest path would be when the nodes are as far apart as possible. For even n, the maximum distance is n/2. Because if you have, say, n=4, each node is connected in a square. The maximum distance between any two nodes is 2 (opposite corners). So for even n, the worst-case path is n/2.

So the figure of merit for the ring network is the number of links (n) multiplied by the worst-case path (n/2), giving n*(n/2) = n²/2.

Now I need to find the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network divided by that of the ring network. So that's [n(n-1)/2] divided by [n²/2].

Let me compute this. The numerator is (n(n-1))/2, denominator is (n²)/2. So when I divide them, the denominators cancel out:

(n(n-1)/2) / (n²/2) = (n(n-1)) / n²) = (n-1)/n.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Because when you divide fractions, you multiply by the reciprocal. So (n(n-1)/2) * (2/(n²)) )= (n(n-1) * 2) / (2 n²) )= (n(n-1)) /n² = (n-1)/n.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is (n-1)/n.

Looking at the options, option D is n/(n-1), and option A is (n-1)/n. So the correct answer should be A: (n-1)/n.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the figures of merit.

Fully connected: links = n(n-1)/2, path length =1. So product is n(n-1)/2.

Ring: links =n, path length =n/2. Product is n*(n/2)=n²/2.

Ratio is [n(n-1)/2] / [n²/2] = (n-1)/n.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is (n-1)/n, which is option A.

To determine the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to the ring network, we analyze the two networks as follows:

### Fully Interconnected Network:
1. **Number of Links**: Each processor is connected to every other processor. The total number of links is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
2. **Worst-Case Path Length**: Since every processor is directly connected to every other processor, the path length between any two nodes is 1.

   **Figure of Merit**:  
   \[
   \text{Figure of Merit (Fully Connected)} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times 1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
   \]

### Ring Network:
1. **Number of Links**: Each processor is connected to exactly two others, forming a ring. Thus, the total number of links is \( n \).
2. **Worst-Case Path Length**: In a ring, the maximum distance between any two nodes is half the total number of nodes. For even \( n \), this is \( \frac{n}{2} \).

   **Figure of Merit**:  
   \[
   \text{Figure of Merit (Ring)} = n \times \frac{n}{2} = \frac{n^2}{2}.
   \]

### Ratio of Figures of Merit:
The ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to that of the ring network is:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{\frac{n^2}{2}} = \frac{n(n-1)}{n^2} = \frac{n-1}{n}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio is \( \frac{n-1}{n} \), which corresponds to **option A**.
