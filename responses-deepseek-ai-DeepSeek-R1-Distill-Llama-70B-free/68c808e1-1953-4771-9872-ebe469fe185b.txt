Okay, so I've got this question about advertising regulations, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about what advertising regulatory bodies suggest that adverts must not do. The sentence is: adverts must not encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.

I remember that advertising regulations are in place to ensure that ads don't do harmful or unethical things. So I think the first blank is about encouraging something negative. Maybe unsafe practices? Because encouraging safe practices would be the opposite of what's being prohibited. So the first blank is probably 'unsafe practices' because advertisers shouldn't encourage unsafe behavior.

Next, the second part says cause unnecessary... something. I think it's about emotions. Like, ads shouldn't cause unnecessary distress or fear. So maybe the second and third blanks are 'distress' and 'fear'? Because those are negative emotions that ads shouldn't provoke without reason.

Wait, the options have some combinations. Let me look at the options. Option I says: Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious. That fits what I was thinking. But wait, the fourth blank is about causing offence. The options have 'serious' or 'trivial' offence. I think ads shouldn't cause serious offence because trivial offence might be too minor. So 'serious' would make sense there.

Let me check another option. Option E says Unsafe, Wants, Jealousy, Serious. Wants and jealousy don't fit as emotions caused by ads in a negative way as much as distress and fear. So E doesn't seem right.

Option I has the right order: encourage unsafe practices, cause unnecessary distress or fear, and must not cause serious offence. That makes sense because all are things ads should avoid. So I think the correct answer is I.
