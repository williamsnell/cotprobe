Question:

An attorney received a document at his office with an attached note from a client for whom he had just finished drafting a will. The note read as follows: "Do you think this contract of sale for my boat complies with state law? I would have talked to you in person about this, but I'm on my way out of town. I will be back next week." The attorney reviewed the document and wrote a one-page letter to the client stating that the document complied with state law. The lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a reasonable fee. The client refused to pay the attorney anything, arguing that she had never agreed to retain the attorney and that she had received nothing of value from the attorney because the sales transaction was never concluded. Assume that there is no applicable statute or rule governing the formation of attorney-client relationships in the jurisdiction. If the attorney sues the client for the $500, will the attorney be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the client did not sign a formal agreement with the attorney.
B: No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.
C: No, because the attorney did not confirm the fee before providing the service.
D: No, because the client's note did not explicitly ask for a billable service.
E: Yes, because the attorney provided a service that is usually billable.
F: Yes, because the client was aware that the attorney's services are typically charged.
G: Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.
H: No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
I: Yes, because the client benefited from the attorney's professional advice.

Okay, so I have this question about attorney-client relationships and whether the attorney can collect a fee from the client. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that an attorney had just finished drafting a will for a client. The client sent a document with a note asking if a boat sale contract complies with state law. She mentioned she couldn't talk in person because she's leaving town and will be back next week. The attorney reviewed the document and wrote a letter saying it complies, then billed her $500, which is a reasonable fee. The client refused to pay, arguing she never agreed to retain him and got nothing because the sale didn't happen.

The question is whether the attorney will prevail in suing for the $500. The options are from A to I.

First, I need to figure out the legal basis here. The question says there's no applicable statute or rule on forming attorney-client relationships, so we're probably looking at common law principles.

At common law, an attorney-client relationship is generally formed when both parties agree, but the agreement doesn't have to be formal. It can be express or implied. An implied agreement can be based on the client's actions, like asking for legal services and the attorney providing them, expecting to be paid.

In this case, the client sent a note asking for legal advice on the contract. She didn't explicitly say "please represent me" or "please review this," but she did ask, "Do you think this contract... complies with state law?" That sounds like a request for legal advice. The attorney then provided a written opinion, which is a clear legal service.

The client's argument is that she didn't agree to retain the attorney. But sometimes, the retention can be implied. If a client asks an attorney to perform a service and the attorney does so, expecting payment, that can create an implied contract. The key is whether there was an offer to provide services and an acceptance.

Here, the client's note could be seen as an offer to have the attorney review the document. The attorney accepted by reviewing it and sending a bill. So there's an implied agreement that the attorney would be paid for the service rendered.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because no formal agreement. But contracts can be oral or implied, so formal agreement isn't necessary. So A is probably incorrect.

B: No, because no agreed essential terms. But for a contract, the main terms would be the service and payment. The attorney provided the service, and the client implicitly agreed by asking for it. The fee was reasonable, so maybe there was an agreement on that. So B might not be correct.

C: No, because no confirmed fee. But in many cases, if a client doesn't object to the fee after the service is rendered, they might be liable. Also, the note didn't specify the fee, but the attorney's fee was reasonable, so maybe it's assumed. So C could be a possible reason, but I'm not sure.

D: No, because the note didn't explicitly ask for billable service. But the question was about whether the contract complies, which is a legal service. The client must have known that such a review would be billable. So D might not hold.

E: Yes, because the service is usually billable. That could be a good point. Attorneys typically charge for such reviews, so the client should expect to pay.

F: Yes, because the client knew services are charged. Similar to E, it's about the client's awareness. If the client was aware, then she implicitly agreed to pay.

G: Yes, because attorney acted to his detriment. This relates to promissory estoppel, but I think that's more when someone relies on a promise to their detriment. Here, the attorney did the work, so maybe this applies, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue.

I: Yes, because client benefited. The client received the attorney's advice, so even if the sale didn't go through, she still got the benefit. So she should pay for the service rendered.

Now, considering the elements for a contract: offer, acceptance, consideration. The client offered to have the attorney review the document (implicit offer). The attorney accepted by doing the work. Consideration is the service provided and the payment. So the contract exists.

The client's argument that she didn't retain him might not hold because the retention can be implied. She asked for a specific service, and he provided it, billing her. She can't just accept the service and then refuse to pay.

Looking at the options, E, F, G, I are the "yes" options. The reasoning would likely hinge on whether there was an implied agreement. Since the client asked for a legal opinion and received it, she is obligated to pay, even if there was no explicit agreement.

Between E and I: E says because the service is usually billable. I says because client benefited. Both are strong. But in contract law, the focus is more on whether there was an agreement, not necessarily whether the client benefited. However, in this case, the client did benefit, so the attorney can argue that she received value.

Wait, but the client might argue that the sale didn't happen, so she didn't benefit. But the attorney's service was reviewing the contract, which she did receive. So she did get the advice, regardless of the sale's outcome.

So the best answer might be E or I. Alternatively, perhaps F, because the client was aware that such services are charged.

But the key point is whether an implied contract exists. The client's request and the attorney's action create an implied contract. So the attorney is entitled to the fee.

Looking at the options, E says yes because the service is usually billable. That makes sense because clients typically pay for such legal reviews. So the attorney can collect.

Alternatively, I says yes because the client benefited. But in some cases, the benefit isn't always the test; it's more about whether services were rendered with the expectation of payment.

Wait, another angle: if the client didn't agree to the representation, there's no contract. But the question is whether the attorney can recover under quantum meruit, which is about the reasonable value of services rendered, even without an express contract.

Quantum meruit is based on the principle that no one should be unjustly enriched at another's expense. So if the attorney provided a service with the expectation of payment, and the client received the benefit, the client must pay.

So under quantum meruit, the attorney might recover regardless of an express contract. That would support option I, because the client received the benefit of the advice.

But wait, quantum meruit is typically used when there's no enforceable contract, but the services were provided. So the attorney would have to show that he provided the services, the client received them, and it would be unjust not to pay.

In this case, the client got the letter, so she received the services. So the attorney could recover under quantum meruit.

So looking at the options again, option I says yes because the client benefited. That aligns with quantum meruit.

So the correct answer might be I.

But another point: the client didn't explicitly ask the attorney to review it, she just sent it with a note. But the attorney chose to review it and bill her. However, the note does ask for an opinion, so it's an implicit request.

Wait, the note says, "Do you think this contract... complies..." which is a direct question seeking legal advice. So the client was seeking the attorney's professional opinion, which is a service. Therefore, she implicitly agreed to pay for it.

So the attorney can recover either under an implied contract or quantum meruit.

Looking back at the options, E is about the service being usually billable. F is about the client's awareness. I is about benefit.

I think the better reasoning is that the client asked for a service, the attorney provided it, and the client is therefore liable to pay. So the implied contract exists. So among the options, E or I.

Alternatively, option E: the service is usually billable. That makes sense because in the legal profession, such reviews are typically paid services. The client should know that, so she implicitly agreed to pay.

But option I is about benefiting, which she did, so perhaps that's the better fit.

Wait, but the client's argument is that she received nothing of value because the sale wasn't concluded. But the attorney's advice was that the contract complies, so she did receive value, regardless of the sale.

I think the answer is E or I.

But let's look at the options again.

Option E: Yes, because the attorney provided a service that is usually billable.

Option I: Yes, because the client benefited from the attorney's professional advice.

Which one is more accurate? The attorney is entitled to payment because he provided a service that is normally charged for. So E could be the right answer.

But another thought: even if the client didn't benefit, the attorney still provided the service. So maybe E is better because it's about the nature of the service, not the outcome.

In the end, I think the correct answer is E because the service is typically billable, and the client should have known that seeking such a review would incur a fee.

So, the answer would be E.

The question revolves around whether an attorney can recover a fee of $500 from a client who requested a legal opinion on a boat sale contract but refused to pay, arguing no formal agreement existed and she received no value. The key issue is whether an implied attorney-client relationship was formed, allowing the attorney to recover the fee.

At common law, an attorney-client relationship can be implied through the client's actions, such as requesting legal services and the attorney providing them with the expectation of payment. Here, the client explicitly asked, "Do you think this contract... complies with state law?" which constitutes a request for legal advice. The attorney provided a written opinion, a clear legal service, and billed the client. This creates an implied agreement, as the client's request and the attorney's response demonstrate mutual understanding that the service would be compensated.

The client's refusal to pay is based on the absence of a formal agreement and the claim that she received no value. However, the attorney's service—reviewing the contract and providing an opinion—was rendered, and the fee was reasonable. The client's argument that the sale was never concluded is irrelevant because the attorney's service was complete upon providing the opinion.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, H**: These options focus on formal agreements, explicit terms, fee confirmation, or frustration of purpose, which are not central to the case. The absence of a formal agreement does not negate the implied contract, and the attorney's reasonable fee does not require prior confirmation.
  
- **E**: This option highlights that the service provided (a legal opinion) is typically billable. This aligns with the implied agreement, as clients are generally aware that such services incur fees.

- **F, G, I**: While these options touch on awareness of billable services, detriment, or benefit, the core issue is the implied contract and the billable nature of the service. The client received the attorney's professional advice, but the key is that the service is customarily paid for.

The best answer is **E**, as it directly addresses the nature of the service and the implied agreement based on standard billing practices in the legal profession.

Answer: E
