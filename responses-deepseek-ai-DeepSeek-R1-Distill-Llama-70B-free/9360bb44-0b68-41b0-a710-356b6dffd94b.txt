Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hominid diets based on tooth analysis. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question mentions a discovery in Malapa Cave, South Africa, dating just after 2 million years ago. I remember that Malapa is associated with a species called Australopithecus sediba. From what I've learned, Au. sediba lived around that time, so that's probably the species in question here.

Now, the question is about their diet. I need to think about what their teeth indicate. Teeth structure can tell us a lot about diet. For example, sharp teeth might suggest meat-eating, while flat molars might be for grinding tough plant material.

Au. sediba's teeth are a bit of a mix, I think. Their molars are large, which suggests they ate tough foods that needed a lot of chewing. But I also recall that their canines are small, which might indicate a reduced emphasis on tearing meat, so maybe they weren't heavy meat-eaters.

I remember something about carbon isotopes in teeth being used to determine diet. Carbon from C3 and C4 plants has different isotope ratios. C3 plants include things like fruits, leaves, and many trees, while C4 plants are grasses and some tropical plants. If the teeth show a certain isotope ratio, it can indicate which types of plants they were eating.

Wait, I think Au. sediba's diet was more focused on C3 plants. C3 plants would include fruits, leaves, maybe some nuts and such. So their diet was probably more plant-based, but not solely grasses or C4 plants. That would mean options pointing towards C3 plants are more likely correct.

Looking at the options:

Option G says fruits, leaves, and C3 plants. That fits with what I'm thinking.

Option B is C3 but includes barley and oats, which might be more associated with later human diets, not sure if they existed back then.

Option E is C4, which I don't think is the case here.

Option A includes meat and fish, but I don't remember Au. sediba being primarily carnivorous.

Option F is C4 grasses, which I think is more like what earlier hominins like some Australopithecus might have eaten, but maybe not sediba.

Option I is nuts, seeds, roots. Those are C3, but the option doesn't specify, so maybe G is better since it explicitly mentions C3.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is probably G.

The analysis of the teeth of the hominid species discovered in Malapa Cave, likely Australopithecus sediba, suggests a diet primarily consisting of C3 plants. C3 plants include fruits, leaves, and other vegetation that require specific isotopic signatures, which align with the dental structure and isotopic evidence from the site. This indicates a plant-based diet rather than one focused on meat, fish, or C4 plants like grasses. Among the options, G best captures this dietary composition.

Answer: G
