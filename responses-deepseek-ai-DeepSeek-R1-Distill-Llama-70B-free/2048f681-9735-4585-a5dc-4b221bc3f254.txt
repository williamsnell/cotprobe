Okay, so I need to find the LCM of 24 and 36. Hmm, I remember that LCM stands for Least Common Multiple. It's the smallest number that both 24 and 36 can divide into without leaving a remainder. Right.

I think the best way to find the LCM is by using the formula that involves the greatest common divisor (GCD). Oh wait, the formula is LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). So I need to find the GCD of 24 and 36 first.

To find the GCD, I can use the prime factorization method. Let's break down both numbers into their prime factors.

For 24:
24 divided by 2 is 12.
12 divided by 2 is 6.
6 divided by 2 is 3.
3 divided by 3 is 1.
So the prime factors of 24 are 2^3 * 3^1.

For 36:
36 divided by 2 is 18.
18 divided by 2 is 9.
9 divided by 3 is 3.
3 divided by 3 is 1.
So the prime factors of 36 are 2^2 * 3^2.

The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common primes. Both have 2 and 3 as primes. So for 2, the lowest exponent is 2 (from 2^2 in 36). For 3, it's 1 (from 3^1 in 24). So GCD = 2^2 * 3^1 = 4 * 3 = 12.

Now plug that into the LCM formula. LCM(24,36) = (24*36)/12. Let me calculate that. 24 times 36 is... 24*30 is 720, and 24*6 is 144, so 720+144=864. Then divide 864 by 12. 864 /12 is 72. So the LCM is 72.

Wait, but let me double-check another way. Maybe by listing the multiples.

Multiples of 24: 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, etc.
Multiples of 36: 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, etc.
I see, the first common multiple is 72. So that matches what I got earlier. So yeah, 72 is the LCM.

Looking at the options, option C is 72. So the answer should be C.

To find the LCM of 24 and 36, we use the formula:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]

First, we determine the GCD of 24 and 36 using prime factorization:

- **Prime factors of 24**: \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \)
- **Prime factors of 36**: \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \)

The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:

\[
\text{GCD} = 2^2 \times 3^1 = 4 \times 3 = 12
\]

Now, substitute into the LCM formula:

\[
\text{LCM}(24, 36) = \frac{24 \times 36}{12} = \frac{864}{12} = 72
\]

To verify, list the multiples of 24 and 36:

- **Multiples of 24**: 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, ...
- **Multiples of 36**: 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, ...

The smallest common multiple is 72, confirming the result.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 72**
