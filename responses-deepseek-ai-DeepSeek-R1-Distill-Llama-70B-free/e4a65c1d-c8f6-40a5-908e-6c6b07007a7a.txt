Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is: given x equals approximately 0.3168, what is the value of the product x multiplied by the infinite product from n=1 to infinity of (1 - x²/(n² π²)) divided by sin(x)? And then I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that infinite products sometimes relate to trigonometric functions. Oh wait, there's this product formula for sine. Let me try to recall. I think Euler did some work on this. Oh right! The sine function can be expressed as an infinite product. The formula is sin(x) equals x times the product from n=1 to infinity of (1 - x²/(n² π²)). Wait, does that sound right?

So if that's the case, then sin(x) = x * product(1 - x²/(n² π²)) for n=1 to infinity. Let me write that down:

sin(x) = x * ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x²/(n² π²))

So if I rearrange this equation, I can solve for the product term. Let's do that. Divide both sides by x:

product term = sin(x)/x

Wait, no, let me see. The equation is sin(x) = x * product. So to get the product: product = sin(x)/(x). Oh right, because you divide both sides by x.

So the product from n=1 to infinity of (1 - x²/(n² π²)) is sin(x) divided by x.

Now, looking back at the problem, the expression we have is x multiplied by this product, and then divided by sin(x). Let me write the expression:

Expression = [x * ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x²/(n² π²))] / sin(x)

But wait, from the product formula, the product is sin(x)/x. So substituting that in:

[x * (sin(x)/x)] / sin(x)

Simplify the numerator: x times (sin(x)/x) is just sin(x). So the numerator becomes sin(x), and the denominator is sin(x). So sin(x)/sin(x) is 1.

So the entire expression equals 1. So the value is 1.0, which is option B.

I think that makes sense. Let me double-check in case I made a mistake. The product formula is correct, right? Yes, I remember that Euler's product formula for sine is a standard result. So substituting it in makes the expression simplify neatly. So the answer should definitely be B.

The problem involves evaluating the expression \( x \cdot \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right) / \sin(x) \) for \( x = 0.3168 \). 

To solve this, we use the known infinite product formula for the sine function:

\[
\sin(x) = x \cdot \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right).
\]

Rearranging this formula, the infinite product term can be expressed as:

\[
\prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}.
\]

Substituting this into the given expression, we have:

\[
\frac{x \cdot \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right)}{\sin(x)} = \frac{x \cdot \frac{\sin(x)}{x}}{\sin(x)}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator, \( x \cdot \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \sin(x) \), so the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin(x)}{\sin(x)} = 1.
\]

Thus, the value of the expression is \( 1.0 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
