Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an elastic collision between a deuteron and a neutron. Hmm, I remember that in physics, when two particles collide elastically, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. But wait, the problem says the deuteron is twice the mass of the neutron. Oh right, because a deuteron is a proton and neutron together, so its mass is about twice that of a single neutron.

The deuteron is moving at 14.9 km/s and collides with a neutron at rest. After the collision, the deuteron is scattered at a LAB angle of 10 degrees. I need to find its final speed.

Wait, I think in these kinds of problems, especially when dealing with collisions, using the conservation of momentum in both x and y directions is the way to go. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact approach, especially when angles are involved.

So let's start by setting up the problem. Let me denote the deuteron as mass m, and the neutron as mass m_n. The problem states that m = 2m_n. So, m is twice the mass of the neutron.

Before collision, the neutron is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The deuteron has a momentum of m * v_initial, where v_initial is 14.9 km/s.

After the collision, the deuteron moves at an angle of 10 degrees with some speed v1, and the neutron moves off at some angle with speed v2.

Since the collision is elastic, kinetic energy is conserved. But dealing with angles might complicate things, so maybe breaking momentum into components would be better.

Let me draw a little diagram in my head. The deuteron is moving along the x-axis before collision. After, it's moving at 10 degrees from the x-axis. The neutron, which was at rest, moves off at some other angle, say theta, relative to the x-axis.

So, in the x-direction, the initial momentum is all from the deuteron: m * v_initial.

After collision, the x-components of the momenta are m*v1*cos(10°) for the deuteron and m_n*v2*cos(theta) for the neutron.

Similarly, in the y-direction, the initial momentum is zero. So the sum of the y-components after collision should also be zero.

So, in y-direction:

m*v1*sin(10°) - m_n*v2*sin(theta) = 0.

Wait, why negative? Oh because if the deuteron is moving at 10 degrees above the x-axis, the neutron might be moving below, hence the negative sign. Or maybe it's the other way around; but the point is their y-components must cancel each other.

But since m = 2m_n, let's substitute that in later.

Now, for the x-direction:

m * v_initial = m*v1*cos(10°) + m_n*v2*cos(theta).

Wait, but m is 2m_n. So substituting m = 2m_n, that equation becomes:

(2m_n) * v_initial = (2m_n)*v1*cos(10°) + m_n*v2*cos(theta).

Divide both sides by m_n:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 cos(10°) + v2 cos(theta).

Hmm, that's one equation.

The y-direction equation is:

2m_n * v1 sin(10°) = m_n v2 sin(theta).

Divide both sides by m_n:

2 v1 sin(10°) = v2 sin(theta).

So now I have two equations:

1. 2 v_initial = 2 v1 cos(10°) + v2 cos(theta).
2. 2 v1 sin(10°) = v2 sin(theta).

I can solve these equations for v1 and v2, but I have two variables and two equations, but theta is another variable. Oh wait, but maybe we can eliminate theta by expressing v2 in terms of v1 from the second equation.

From equation 2:

v2 = [2 v1 sin(10°)] / sin(theta).

Substitute into equation 1:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 cos(10°) + [2 v1 sin(10°)/sin(theta)] * cos(theta).

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe we can think of it another way. Since the collision is elastic, the kinetic energy is conserved.

The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v_initial².

The final kinetic energy is (1/2) m v1² + (1/2) m_n v2².

So setting them equal:

(1/2)m v_initial² = (1/2)m v1² + (1/2)m_n v2².

Multiply both sides by 2:

m v_initial² = m v1² + m_n v2².

Again, since m=2m_n, substitute:

2 m_n v_initial² = 2 m_n v1² + m_n v2².

Divide both sides by m_n:

2 v_initial² = 2 v1² + v2².

So equation 3: 2 v_initial² = 2 v1² + v2².

Now, I have equations 1, 2, and 3, but equation 3 relates v1 and v2 without angles. Maybe I can find a way to express v2 from equation 2 in terms of v1 and substitute into equation 1 and 3.

Wait, equation 2 is:

2 v1 sin(10) = v2 sin(theta) → v2 = (2 v1 sin(10))/sin(theta).

But equation 1 is:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 cos(10) + v2 cos(theta).

Substituting v2 from equation 2 into equation 1:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 cos(10) + [ (2 v1 sin(10))/sin(theta) ) ] * cos(theta).

Hmm. Let's factor out 2 v1:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 [ cos(10) + ( sin(10) cos(theta) ) / sin(theta) ) ].

Simplify the term inside the brackets:

cos(10) + sin(10) * (cos(theta)/sin(theta)).

Which is cos(10) + sin(10) cot(theta).

Not sure if that's helpful. Maybe we can find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in elastic collisions, the relative velocity along the line of impact is reversed. But wait, that's in the case where one object is much more massive than the other, or in one-dimensional collisions. Here, it's a two-dimensional elastic collision, so that approach might not directly apply.

Wait, I remember something about the angle of deflection in elastic collisions. There's this formula involving the masses and the angles. Maybe using the law of cosines in the center of mass frame?

Alternatively, perhaps considering the problem in the center of mass frame might simplify things. But I'm not sure how to do that immediately.

Wait, another approach: in elastic collisions, the velocities can be found using the formula derived from conservation laws. I think I've seen a formula where the final velocities are expressed in terms of the initial velocity, masses, and the angle.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to eliminate theta from the equations.

Let me take equation 2 again:

v2 = (2 v1 sin(10)) / sin(theta).

And from equation 1:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 cos(10) + v2 cos(theta).

Substituting v2 from equation 2 into equation 1:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 cos(10) + [ (2 v1 sin(10))/sin(theta) ) ] * cos(theta).

Let me write this as:

2 v_initial = 2 v1 [ cos(10) + ( sin(10) cos(theta) ) / sin(theta) ) ].

Hmm, perhaps we can use the identity cos(theta)/sin(theta) = cot(theta), so:

cos(10) + sin(10) * cot(theta).

But I don't know theta, so this might not help directly. Maybe I can square equations 1 and 2 and add them to eliminate theta.

Wait, let's see. Let me write equation 1 as:

v2 cos(theta) = 2 v_initial - 2 v1 cos(10).

Equation 2 as:

v2 sin(theta) = 2 v1 sin(10).

Now, square both equations and add them:

(v2 cos(theta))^2 + (v2 sin(theta))^2 = [2 v_initial - 2 v1 cos(10)]^2 + [2 v1 sin(10)]^2.

The left side is v2² (cos² + sin²) = v2².

The right side becomes:

(2 v_initial - 2 v1 cos(10))² + (2 v1 sin(10))².

Expanding the right side:

= [4 v_initial² - 8 v_initial v1 cos(10) + 4 v1² cos²(10) ] + 4 v1² sin²(10).

Factor out the 4:

4 [ v_initial² - 2 v_initial v1 cos(10) + v1² (cos²(10) + sin²(10)) ) ].

Since cos² + sin² =1, this becomes:

4 [ v_initial² - 2 v_initial v1 cos(10) + v1² ].

So, v2² = 4 [ v_initial² - 2 v_initial v1 cos(10) + v1² ].

But from equation 3, we have:

v2² = 2 v_initial² - 2 v1².

Wait, because equation 3 is 2 v_initial² = 2 v1² + v2² → v2² = 2 (v_initial² - v1²).

So substituting equation 3 into the squared sum result:

v2² = 4 [ v_initial² - 2 v_initial v1 cos(10) + v1² ].

But v2² is also 2 (v_initial² - v1²).

So:

2 (v_initial² - v1²) = 4 [ v_initial² - 2 v_initial v1 cos(10) + v1² ].

Divide both sides by 2:

v_initial² - v1² = 2 [ v_initial² - 2 v_initial v1 cos(10) + v1² ].

Expand the right side:

= 2 v_initial² -4 v_initial v1 cos(10) + 2 v1².

Bring everything to the left side:

v_initial² - v1² - 2 v_initial² +4 v_initial v1 cos(10) - 2 v1² =0.

Combine like terms:

(1-2) v_initial² + (-1 -2) v1² +4 v_initial v1 cos(10) =0.

That becomes:

- v_initial² -3 v1² +4 v_initial v1 cos(10) =0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

v_initial² +3 v1² -4 v_initial v1 cos(10) =0.

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of v1. Let me write it as:

3 v1² -4 v_initial cos(10) v1 + v_initial² =0.

So, quadratic in v1: 3 v1² - (4 cos(10) v_initial ) v1 + v_initial² =0.

Let me write it as 3 v1² - (4 cos(10) v_initial) v1 + v_initial² =0.

Using the quadratic formula, v1 = [4 cos(10) v_initial ± sqrt( (4 cos(10) v_initial)^2 - 4 *3* v_initial^2 ) ]/(2 *3).

Simplify the discriminant:

(4 cos(10) v_initial)^2 -12 v_initial^2 = 16 cos²(10) v_initial² -12 v_initial².

Factor out 4 v_initial²:

4 v_initial² (4 cos²(10) -3).

So the square root becomes sqrt(4 v_initial² (4 cos²(10)-3)) ) = 2 v_initial sqrt(4 cos²(10)-3).

Putting back into the equation for v1:

v1 = [4 cos(10) v_initial ± 2 v_initial sqrt(4 cos²(10)-3) ] /6.

Factor out 2 v_initial from numerator:

v1 = [2 v_initial (2 cos(10) ± sqrt(4 cos²(10) -3)) ] /6.

Simplify:

v1 = [v_initial (2 cos(10) ± sqrt(4 cos²(10)-3)) ] /3.

Now, let's compute the term under the square root: 4 cos²(10) -3.

Compute cos(10 degrees):

cos(10°) is approximately 0.9848.

So 4*(0.9848)^2 =4*(0.9698) ≈ 3.879.

3.879 -3 =0.879.

So sqrt(0.879) ≈ 0.9375.

So the two possibilities are:

[2 cos(10) + sqrt(...)] /3 → [2*(0.9848) + 0.9375 ] /3.

Compute numerator: 1.9696 +0.9375 =2.9071 → 2.9071/3 ≈0.969.

Alternatively, [2 cos(10) - sqrt(...)] → 1.9696 -0.9375=1.0321 → 1.0321/3≈0.344.

So v1 is either approximately 0.969 v_initial or 0.344 v_initial.

But v_initial is 14.9 km/s.

So 0.969 *14.9 → approx 14.448 km/s.

And 0.344 *14.9 ≈5.11 km/s.

Wait, but which one is the correct solution? Because in elastic collisions, usually, the larger mass would continue with a speed close to its initial speed, but since the deuteron is twice the neutron's mass, perhaps it doesn't slow down much. So I think the 14.44 km/s option makes sense, because that's close to its initial speed of 14.9 km/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 14.44 km/s, which is what I got with the first solution.

So the final speed of the deuteron is approximately 14.44 km/s.

To solve the problem, we analyze the elastic collision between a deuteron (mass \( m \)) and a neutron (mass \( m_n \)) using conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. The deuteron is twice the mass of the neutron (\( m = 2m_n \)) and is scattered at a LAB angle of \( \psi = 10^\circ \). The goal is to determine the final speed of the deuteron.

### Key Equations and Analysis:
1. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - In the x-direction:
     \[
     m v_{\text{initial}} = m v_1 \cos(10^\circ) + m_n v_2 \cos(\theta)
     \]
   - In the y-direction:
     \[
     m v_1 \sin(10^\circ) = m_n v_2 \sin(\theta)
     \]
   Substituting \( m = 2m_n \), these equations simplify to:
   \[
   2 v_{\text{initial}} = 2 v_1 \cos(10^\circ) + v_2 \cos(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   2 v_1 \sin(10^\circ) = v_2 \sin(\theta)
   \]

2. **Conservation of Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} m v_{\text{initial}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_n v_2^2
   \]
   Substituting \( m = 2m_n \), this becomes:
   \[
   2 v_{\text{initial}}^2 = 2 v_1^2 + v_2^2
   \]

3. **Eliminating \( \theta \)**:
   From the y-momentum equation, \( v_2 = \frac{2 v_1 \sin(10^\circ)}{\sin(\theta)} \). Substituting this into the x-momentum equation and simplifying leads to a quadratic equation for \( v_1 \):
   \[
   3 v_1^2 - 4 v_{\text{initial}} \cos(10^\circ) v_1 + v_{\text{initial}}^2 = 0
   \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   Using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{4 v_{\text{initial}} \cos(10^\circ) \pm \sqrt{(4 v_{\text{initial}} \cos(10^\circ))^2 - 12 v_{\text{initial}}^2}}{6}
   \]
   Simplifying the discriminant and solving yields two possible solutions:
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{v_{\text{initial}}}{3} \left[ 2 \cos(10^\circ) \pm \sqrt{4 \cos^2(10^\circ) - 3} \right]
   \]
   Substituting \( \cos(10^\circ) \approx 0.9848 \), the two solutions are approximately:
   \[
   v_1 \approx 0.969 v_{\text{initial}} \quad \text{or} \quad v_1 \approx 0.344 v_{\text{initial}}
   \]

5. **Selecting the Physical Solution**:
   Since the deuteron is much heavier than the neutron, it retains most of its initial speed. Thus, the correct solution is \( v_1 \approx 0.969 v_{\text{initial}} \). Substituting \( v_{\text{initial}} = 14.9 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
   \[
   v_1 \approx 14.44 \, \text{km/s}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final speed of the deuteron is approximately **14.44 km/s**, corresponding to option **C**.
