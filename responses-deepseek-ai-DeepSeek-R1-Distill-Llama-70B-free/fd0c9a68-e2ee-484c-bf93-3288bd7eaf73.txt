Okay, so I've got this problem here about chain discounts and I'm supposed to find the equivalent single discount. Hmm, I remember that chain discounts are when you have multiple discounts applied one after another, and you need to find a single discount that gives the same result. 

The question says Parks Wholesalers are offering a chain discount of 25-10-5%. So that's three discounts in a series: 25%, then 10%, then 5%. I think the way to calculate this is by applying each discount sequentially and then seeing what the total discount is equivalent to.

Wait, how does that work exactly? Oh right, each discount is applied on the reduced price after the previous discount. So it's not just adding them up because each subsequent discount is applied on a smaller amount.

Let me think of it step by step. Let's say the original price of the sofa is $100 to make it easy. 

First discount is 25%. So 25% off of $100 is $25. So the price becomes $75 after the first discount.

Next, the second discount is 10%. But wait, 10% of what? I think it's 10% off the already discounted price. So 10% of $75 is $7.50. Subtracting that, the new price is $75 - $7.50 = $67.50.

Then comes the third discount of 5%. Again, this is applied to the current price, which is $67.50. So 5% of $67.50 is $3.375. Subtracting that, the final price is $67.50 - $3.375 = $64.125.

So the final price after all three discounts is $64.125. The original price was $100, so the total discount is the difference between $100 and $64.125, which is $35.875.

Wait, but the question is asking for the equivalent single discount percentage. So the total discount is $35.875 on $100. So the percentage is (35.875 / 100) * 100% = 35.875%.

Looking at the options, let me check. The options are:

A: 36.5%  
B: 30%  
C: 50%  
D: 34%  
E: 32.5%  
F: 25%  
G: 40%  
H: 37.5%  
I: 38%  
J: 35.875%

So option J is 35.875%, which matches my calculation. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should double-check my math. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with $100. 25% off: 100 * 0.75 = 75. Okay, that's right. Then 10% off: 75 * 0.90 = 67.5. Then 5% off: 67.5 * 0.95. Let me calculate that. 67.5 times 0.95. 67.5 * 0.95 is the same as 67.5 - (67.5 * 0.05). 67.5 * 0.05 is 3.375, so subtracting gives 64.125. So the final price is $64.125, which means the discount from $100 is $35.875, so 35.875% discount. So yeah, J is the correct answer.

Alternatively, another way to think about this without assuming $100 is to use multipliers. Each discount can be represented as a decimal multiplier. So the first discount is 25%, so you're paying 75%, which is 0.75. The second is 10%, so 0.90, and the third is 5%, so 0.95. Multiply all these together: 0.75 * 0.90 * 0.95.

Let me calculate that. 0.75 * 0.90 is 0.675. Then 0.675 * 0.95. Hmm, 0.675 * 0.95. Let me compute that. 0.675 * 0.95 is the same as 0.675 * (1 - 0.05) = 0.675 - (0.675 * 0.05). 0.675 * 0.05 is 0.03375. So 0.675 - 0.03375 = 0.64125. So the multiplier is 0.64125, which means the final price is 64.125% of the original. So the discount is 100% - 64.125% = 35.875%.

Yep, same result. So the equivalent single discount is 35.875%, which is option J.

To determine the equivalent single discount for a chain discount of 25-10-5%, we need to calculate the final price after applying each discount sequentially and then find the total discount percentage.

1. **First discount (25%):**  
   Starting with an assumed price of $100, a 25% discount reduces the price to:  
   \[
   100 \times (1 - 0.25) = 75
   \]

2. **Second discount (10%):**  
   Applying a 10% discount to the reduced price of $75:  
   \[
   75 \times (1 - 0.10) = 67.5
   \]

3. **Third discount (5%):**  
   Applying a 5% discount to the reduced price of $67.5:  
   \[
   67.5 \times (1 - 0.05) = 64.125
   \]

The final price after all discounts is $64.125. The total discount is the difference between the original price ($100) and the final price ($64.125):  
\[
100 - 64.125 = 35.875
\]

To express this as a percentage of the original price:  
\[
\frac{35.875}{100} \times 100\% = 35.875\%
\]

Thus, the equivalent single discount is **35.875%**, which corresponds to option **J**.
