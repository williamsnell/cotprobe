Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of integers n between 1 and 25 inclusive such that n squared plus 3n plus 2 is divisible by 6. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Divisibility by 6 means that the expression must be divisible by both 2 and 3 because 6 is 2 times 3, which are coprime. So I should check both conditions.

Let me write down the expression: n² + 3n + 2. Maybe I can factor this to make it easier. Oh wait, yeah, n² + 3n + 2 is (n+1)(n+2). Oh that's helpful because products are often easier to analyze for divisibility.

So, (n+1)(n+2) must be divisible by 6. Let's break it down into two parts: divisibility by 2 and divisibility by 3.

First, divisibility by 2. For a product to be divisible by 2, at least one of the factors must be even. So either (n+1) is even, or (n+2) is even, or both. Well, n+1 and n+2 are consecutive integers. Oh, because n is an integer, so n+1 and n+2 are right next to each other. So one of them has to be even. So the product is always even. Wait, does that mean the expression is always divisible by 2? Because in any two consecutive numbers, one is even. So yes, (n+1)(n+2) is always even, so the expression is always divisible by 2, regardless of n.

Now for the divisibility by 3. The product (n+1)(n+2) must be divisible by 3. So, at least one of the factors must be divisible by 3. So either (n+1) mod 3 is 0, or (n+2) mod 3 is 0, or both.

Let me think about when that happens. So, for (n+1) to be divisible by 3, n+1 ≡ 0 mod 3 → n ≡ 2 mod 3. Similarly, (n+2) divisible by 3 → n+2 ≡0 mod 3 → n ≡1 mod 3.

So for the product to be divisible by 3, n must be congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. So n ≡1 mod3 or n≡2 mod3.

Wait, but let me think again. Because n can't be congruent to 0 mod3, because then neither (n+1) nor (n+2) would be divisible by 3. Because n=3k → n+1=3k+1, n+2=3k+2, neither divisible by 3. So if n is 0 mod3, then the product isn't divisible by 3.

So the expression is divisible by 3 only when n is 1 or 2 mod3. So n can't be 0 mod3.

So putting it together: since the expression is always divisible by 2, we only need to ensure it's also divisible by 3. So the condition is that n must not be congruent to 0 mod3.

Therefore, the numbers n between 1 and 25 inclusive where n mod3 is not 0.

So the total numbers from 1 to25 is 25. How many are not divisible by3?

Numbers divisible by3 between 1 and25: let's calculate. The first is 3, then 6, 9,... up to 24 (since 24=3*8). So how many terms? 3*1=3, up to 3*8=24. So 8 numbers.

So total numbers not divisible by3 is 25-8=17.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, for each 3 consecutive numbers, exactly one is divisible by3. So in 25 numbers, how many groups of 3? 25 ÷3 is 8 with a remainder of 1. So 8 full groups, each contributing 1 number divisible by3, so 8 numbers. Plus the remaining 1 number (25th) which is not divisible by3. So total not divisible by3: 25 -8=17.

Wait, so the answer would be 17? But looking at the options, option I is 17.

Wait, but wait another moment. Because I thought that the expression is (n+1)(n+2), which is always even, so it's divisible by2. So the only condition is whether it's divisible by3. So the count is 17. So the answer should be I:17.

Wait, but let me take a step back and check with some examples to be sure.

Let's pick n=1: (1+1)(1+2)=2*3=6, which is divisible by6. So n=1 counts.

n=2: (3)(4)=12, yes.

n=3: 4*5=20. 20 divided by6 is 3 with remainder 2. So 20 mod6 is 2. So not divisible by6. So n=3 shouldn't count. So 3 is excluded, as expected.

n=4:5*6=30, which is 5*6=30, divisible by6. So counts.

n=5:6*7=42, yes.

n=6:7*8=56. 56/6 is 9*6=54, remainder 2. So 56 not divisible by6. So n=6 doesn't count. Correct.

Wait, but according to our earlier logic, n=3 and n=6 are not counted because they're 0 mod3, which is correct.

So yes, our reasoning seems correct. So the count is 17, which is option I.

To determine the number of integers \( n \), \( 1 \leq n \leq 25 \), such that \( n^2 + 3n + 2 \) is divisible by 6, we analyze the expression \( n^2 + 3n + 2 \). Factoring it as \( (n+1)(n+2) \), we note that for the product to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: Since \( n+1 \) and \( n+2 \) are consecutive integers, one of them is always even. Thus, \( (n+1)(n+2) \) is always divisible by 2, regardless of \( n \).

2. **Divisibility by 3**: For \( (n+1)(n+2) \) to be divisible by 3, at least one of the factors must be divisible by 3. This occurs if:
   - \( n+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), i.e., \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), or
   - \( n+2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), i.e., \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).

   Thus, \( n \) must satisfy \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \). If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), the product is not divisible by 3.

3. **Counting valid \( n \)**: Between 1 and 25, there are 25 integers. Numbers divisible by 3 in this range are \( 3, 6, 9, \dots, 24 \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 3 and common difference 3. The number of terms in this sequence is \( \lfloor \frac{25}{3} \rfloor = 8 \). Therefore, there are \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) numbers that are not divisible by 3.

Since the expression \( n^2 + 3n + 2 \) is always divisible by 2 and divisible by 3 for \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), the total number of valid \( n \) is 17.

The correct answer is **I: 17**.
