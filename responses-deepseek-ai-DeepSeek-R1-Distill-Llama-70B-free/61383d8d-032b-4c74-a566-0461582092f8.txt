Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The setup is a piston-cylinder arrangement with saturated Freon-12 at -10°C. Then, the vapor is compressed to a final pressure of 1.6 MPa, and the process is reversible and adiabatic. I need to find the work per kilogram of Freon-12 for this process.

Hmm, right. So first, I'll recall some basic concepts. A reversible adiabatic process is an isentropic process, meaning the entropy remains constant. Since it's adiabatic, there's no heat transfer (Q=0), so the work done is at the expense of the internal energy.

The question is about calculating the work done per kilogram. I remember that for an adiabatic process in an ideal gas, the work can be calculated using PV^γ = constant, but I'm not sure if Freon-12 behaves as an ideal gas here. Wait, Freon is a refrigerant and at -10°C, it's probably in a saturated state, meaning it's a mixture of liquid and vapor. So maybe the ideal gas law doesn't apply directly here. I might need to use the properties from the refrigerant tables.

Let me think about the process. The initial state is saturated Freon-12 at -10°C. I need to determine whether it's saturated liquid or vapor. Oh wait, the question says it's saturated vapor because it's being compressed. Wait no, wait. The problem says "saturated Freon-12" which could be either liquid or vapor, but then says "the vapor is then compressed." Oh, so initial state is saturated vapor at -10°C. That makes sense because if it's vapor, you can compress it further.

So the initial state is State 1: saturated vapor at T1 = -10°C. Then, it's compressed to P2 = 1.6 MPa. So State 2 is at 1.6 MPa, and since the process is adiabatic and reversible, it's an isentropic process, so entropy remains the same.

I need to find the work done. For a piston-cylinder arrangement undergoing a reversible process, the work done is the integral of P dV. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here. Alternatively, for an adiabatic process, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy, because Q=0, so ΔU = -W. So W = -(U2 - U1).

Wait, but wait. The work done on the system is positive when the system is compressed. Since the piston is compressing the vapor, the system is doing work on the surroundings if it's expanding, but here it's being compressed, so work is done on the system. Wait, no, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is taken as positive. So when a gas is compressed, the system is doing negative work, or work is done on the system, so W would be negative.

But in the formula, W = -∫P dV. So if the volume decreases (compression), dV is negative, which would make W negative, meaning work is done on the system. So in this case, since we're compressing the vapor, the work done by the system is negative, so the work would be negative.

But I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The work done by the system is positive when the system expands, negative when compressed. So in this problem, the system is being compressed, so the work is negative, which means the options might have negative values.

But let's get back to the steps. I think the correct approach is to find the initial and final states, get their internal energies, and then calculate the work from the change in internal energy.

So first, I'll find the properties at State 1. State 1 is saturated vapor at -10°C. Looking up Freon-12 tables, for saturated vapor at -10°C, I can find specific volume (v1), entropy (s1), internal energy (u1), etc.

Wait, but I don't have the tables in front of me. I'll have to remember typical values or think of how to proceed. Alternatively, maybe I can find the initial and final states and determine the necessary properties.

At State 1: T1 = -10°C = 263.15 K (since 0°C is 273.15 K). For saturated Freon-12 vapor, the pressure P1 can be found from the saturation table. Let me think: I recall that for R-12, at -10°C, the saturation pressure is around 120 kPa. So P1 is about 120 kPa.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by using the fact that the process is isentropic. So s2 = s1.

Since the process is reversible and adiabatic, entropy remains constant. So at State 2, which is at P2 = 1.6 MPa, the entropy s2 equals s1.

But wait, when you compress a vapor isentropically, you might end up in a superheated region or in a mixture region, depending on the pressure. So I need to check whether at P2 = 1.6 MPa, the entropy s1 corresponds to a superheated vapor or if it's in the two-phase region.

Wait, but I think at higher pressures, the entropy might decrease, but since we're keeping entropy constant, perhaps the final state is superheated vapor.

So let's find s1. At State 1, saturated vapor, so s1 = s_g at T1 = -10°C. From the tables, s_g for R-12 at -10°C is approximately 0.726 kJ/kg·K (I'm just making this number up for illustration; in reality, I'd look it up).

Now, at State 2, pressure is 1.6 MPa. I need to find the state where, at P2 = 1.6 MPa, the entropy s2 = s1 = 0.726 kJ/kg·K.

I need to determine whether at P2 = 1.6 MPa, the entropy corresponds to a superheated vapor or perhaps a mixture.

Looking up the R-12 table at 1.6 MPa (which is 1600 kPa), I can find the saturation temperature. If the saturation temperature at 1600 kPa is higher than T1, then the state at P2 would be superheated vapor if the entropy is higher than s_g at that pressure, or a mixture if it's between s_f and s_g.

Wait, let me think again. At a given pressure P2, if the entropy s is greater than s_g(P2), then the state is superheated vapor. If it's between s_f and s_g, it's a mixture. If I'm correct that s1 = s_g at T1 = -10°C, which is 0.726, and P2 is 1.6 MPa, perhaps that's a higher pressure, so the saturation entropy s_g at P2 is lower than s1. So in that case, the state would be superheated vapor.

Alternatively, I might have to find the actual values. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Find State 1: saturated vapor at T1 = -10°C.
   - P1 = saturation pressure at T1 = let's say 120 kPa (I'll confirm this if I can).
   - s1 = s_g1 = 0.726 kJ/kg·K (hypothetical value).
   - u1 = u_g1 = let's say 260 kJ/kg (again, hypothetical).

2. State 2: P2 = 1.6 MPa, s2 = s1 = 0.726.

3. Determine if, at P2, s2 is in the superheated region. If at P2, the saturation entropy s_g2 is less than s1, then State 2 is superheated vapor. So we can find T2 and u2 from the superheated tables at P2 and s2.

Once I have u1 and u2, the work done W is u1 - u2, but wait, because for an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = -W. So W = -(U2 - U1) = U1 - U2.

Wait, no. Actually, the first law for a process is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. Since Q=0 (adiabatic), ΔU = -W. So W = -(U2 - U1) = U1 - U2.

Wait, but the question is about the work per kilogram, so the formula would be w = u1 - u2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: for the system, work done by the system is positive. So if the system is compressed, work is done on the system, so W would be negative.

But in our case, the piston is compressing the vapor, so the work done by the system is negative, meaning work is done on the system, so W is negative.

But let's proceed with the formula. So w = u1 - u2.

Now, let's get back to finding u2. Once I have u2, I can compute w.

But I'm stuck because I don't have the actual tables. Alternatively, I can think about how to approach it with the given options.

Wait, perhaps I can think of using the ideal gas equations for an approximation. But wait, Freon doesn't behave as an ideal gas, especially at higher pressures. So that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the specific heat at constant volume and relate temperature change to internal energy. But without knowing the temperatures, it's tricky.

Wait, another approach: for an isentropic process involving a refrigerant, the work can be calculated using the change in enthalpy and the heat capacity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the enthalpy as well. For a reversible adiabatic process, the work can also be expressed as (h1 - h2)/η, but that's for turbines and such, not sure if it applies here.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate the process using the incompressible fluid model, but I don't think that's valid for gases.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't have the exact property values. Maybe I can think about the possible answers and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options, some are positive and some negative. Since the process is compression, the work done by the system should be negative, implying that the system is having work done on it. So the work per kilogram (w) should be negative.

Looking at the options, B is -200, E is -50, H is -34, I is -150, J is -100.

So the possible answers are B, E, H, I, J.

Now, which of these makes sense? Let's think about the magnitudes.

If the Freon is being compressed from a low pressure (like 120 kPa) to 1600 kPa, that's a significant compression. The internal energy would increase because we're doing work on the system, so u2 would be higher than u1, making w = u1 - u2 negative, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.

The magnitude of the work would depend on how much u changes. I'm not sure what the typical u values for R-12 are, but if u1 is, say, 200 kJ/kg and u2 is 300, then w would be -100. But I'm just guessing.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in internal energy isn't that large, so maybe the work is around -34 or -50.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. Find State 1: saturated vapor at T1 = -10°C. So look up P1, s1, u1.

2. State 2: P2 = 1.6 MPa, s2 = s1.

3. Look up State 2 properties: since P2 is higher than P1, and s is the same, the temperature at State 2 will be higher than T1.

4. Find u2 from the superheated table at P2 and T2 (which can be found via s).

5. Compute w = u1 - u2.

Hmm, but without the exact values, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the work can be found using enthalpy change, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: for an ideal gas, the work in an isentropic process is given by w = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/ (γ - 1). But I don't know if Freon behaves ideally here.

Wait, but let's try to proceed with that approach for an approximation. So let's assume Freon behaves as an ideal gas. Then, we can write:

(T1/V1) = (T2/V2) → T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)

But since P1 V1 = n R T1 and P2 V2 = n R T2, then P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ.

Wait, but without knowing γ (the heat capacity ratio) for Freon, I can't proceed. I think for refrigerants, γ is around 1.1 or so, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the specific volume v1 at State 1.

At State 1, v1 is the specific volume of saturated vapor at -10°C. Let's say v1 is about 0.08 m³/kg (just a hypothetical number).

At State 2, since it's superheated vapor at P2 = 1.6 MPa, the specific volume v2 would be lower than v1 because pressure is higher. So v2 is, say, 0.02 m³/kg.

Wait, but without exact numbers, this is difficult. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to estimate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to use the refrigerant tables to find u1 and u2.

So, let's try to outline the procedure again more clearly.

Step 1: Determine State 1 properties.

State 1: Saturated vapor at T1 = -10°C.

From R-12 tables:

- Pressure P1 = 120 kPa (approx)
- Specific volume v1 = 0.08 m³/kg (approx)
- Entropy s1 = s_g1 = 0.726 kJ/kg·K
- Internal energy u1 = u_g1 = let's say 260 kJ/kg

Step 2: Determine State 2 properties.

State 2: P2 = 1.6 MPa, s2 = s1 = 0.726 kJ/kg·K.

We need to check if at P2 = 1.6 MPa, the entropy s2 is in the superheated region or in the two-phase region.

Looking up the saturation properties at P2 = 1.6 MPa:

- Saturation temperature Tsat2 = let's say 60°C (I'm making this up)
- At Tsat2, s_f and s_g would be known. Let's say s_g2 = 0.72 kJ/kg·K.

Wait, but if at P2=1.6 MPa, s_g2 is 0.72, and our s2 is 0.726, which is slightly higher, so State 2 is superheated vapor, just beyond the saturation dome.

So, at P2=1.6 MPa and s2=0.726, we can find T2 and u2 from the superheated tables.

Looking up superheated R-12 at P=1.6 MPa and s=0.726:

- Let's say T2 is 80°C.
- u2 = 300 kJ/kg (hypothetical)

Step 3: Calculate work done.

w = u1 - u2 = 260 - 300 = -40 kJ/kg.

Hmm, but this is a rough estimate. Looking at the options, the closest is option H (-34.087) or E (-50), but my estimate was -40, which isn't an option. So perhaps my assumptions are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps u1 is lower and u2 is higher. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use enthalpy instead. For an isentropic process, the change in enthalpy can be related, but I'm not sure.

Wait, for a turbine, the work is h1 - h2, but in a piston-cylinder undergoing compression, maybe it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the work can be calculated using the specific heat at constant pressure.

Wait, but without knowing the exact process path, that's difficult.

Another approach: Since the process is isentropic, the work can be calculated as the change in internal energy.

So, w = u1 - u2.

But without knowing u1 and u2, I can't compute exactly.

Wait, perhaps the work done is negative, as the system is being compressed, so the work is done on the system, hence negative.

Looking at the options, the negative ones are B, E, H, I, J.

If the correct answer is B: -200, that's a large value. That would mean a significant change in internal energy.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H: -34.087.

But I'm not certain. Without the exact property values, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for work in an adiabatic process.

Work, w = -∫ P dv (from 1 to 2).

But for a reversible process, P = T/(v(specific)).

Alternatively, using the relation for entropy: s2 = s1 = s_g1.

Wait, perhaps using the ideal gas law, even though it's an approximation.

For an ideal gas, s2 - s1 = c_p ln(P2/P1) - R ln(v2/v1). Wait, but since s2 = s1, this would imply c_p ln(P2/P1) = R ln(v2/v1).

R for R-12 is approximately 41.2 J/kg·K.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the relation T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ), but without knowing γ, I can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and look for the answer that makes the most sense. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is B: -200 kJ/kg, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, another approach: If the process is isentropic, then the work done is the change in internal energy. So if u1 is 200 and u2 is 400, then work is -200.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: -50,
