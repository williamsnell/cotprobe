Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the minimum molecular weight of ribonuclease based on its leucine and isoleucine content. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that ribonuclease is 1.65% leucine and 2.48% isoleucine by weight. I remember that to find the minimum molecular weight, I need to find out how many of each amino acid is present, and then determine the smallest possible molecular weight that accommodates those numbers.

Wait, right, the minimum molecular weight is found by assuming the protein contains the smallest number of each amino acid such that their percentages match the given values. So I guess I should start by figuring out the number of leucine and isoleucine residues.

Let me think about the molecular weights of these amino acids. Leucine has a molecular weight of 131 g/mol, and isoleucine is 131 g/mol as well, right? Oh wait, no. Wait, let me double-check. Leucine is C6H13NO2, which is 6*12 + 13*1 + 14 + 16*2 = 72 +13+14+32=131. Isoleucine, same formula, so also 131 g/mol. Oh, so they both have the same molecular weight. That's interesting.

Now, the percentages. So if the protein is 1.65% leucine by weight, that means that in 100 grams of protein, 1.65 grams are leucine. Same with isoleucine: 2.48 grams in 100 grams of protein.

But wait, to find the number of moles, I need to divide by the molecular weight. Since both are 131 g/mol, the moles for each would be their weight percentages divided by 131.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of residues (which is a whole number). So the idea is to find the minimum number of each amino acid such that when you compute (number * molecular weight) divided by the total molecular weight of the protein, you get the percentages given.

But since the total protein's molecular weight is what we're solving for, maybe a better approach is to consider the total weight contributed by each amino acid.

Let me think differently. Let’s say the protein has a molecular weight of M grams per mole. Then, the weight of leucine in the protein would be (number of leucine residues) * (131 g/mol) * (1/M) * 100% should equal 1.65%. Wait, no, perhaps I should model it this way.

The weight of leucine in the protein is (n_leu * 131) / M * 100 = 1.65%.

Similarly, for isoleucine: (n_ile * 131) / M * 100 = 2.48%.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to set up the equations.

Let’s denote:
n_leu = number of leucine residues,
n_ile = number of isoleucine residues,
M = molecular weight of the protein.

The total weight of leucine is n_leu * 131,
The total weight of isoleucine is n_ile * 131.

The total weight of the protein is M g/mol (but wait, no, M is in g/mol, but when considering the composition, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the protein's mass).

Alternatively, the percentage composition is given by:

( (n_leu * 131) / (M) ) * 100 = 1.65,
( (n_ile * 131) / (M) ) * 100 = 2.48.

Wait, but M is the molecular weight, which is the sum of all amino acids' molecular weights. Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, the molecular weight of the protein is M = sum over all amino acids (number * molecular weight of each). But since we don't know the other amino acids, perhaps we can find the minimal M by considering only leucine and isoleucine, but that's probably not correct. Because the protein has other amino acids as well, so the minimal M would come from considering that the only amino acids are leucine and isoleucine, which isn't the case. So perhaps the approach is to find the minimal possible M that satisfies both percentage conditions, assuming that the rest of the protein is made of other amino acids which contribute to the total weight.

Wait, but to find the minimal possible M, perhaps we can model it as a system where the sum of the weights of leucine and isoleucine in M is such that their percentages meet the given values, and then M is as small as possible. But that might not account for all the other amino acids' contributions. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the total grams of each amino acid in the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for calculating the minimum molecular weight based on the amino acid content. I remember that the formula involves finding the smallest whole number of residues that would account for the given percentages.

So for each amino acid, the number of residues is (percentage * molecular weight of protein) / (molecular weight of amino acid). But since the molecular weight of the protein is unknown, we need another approach.

Wait, perhaps we can express the number of residues for each amino acid in terms of M, the protein's molecular weight.

n_leu = (1.65/100) * M / 131,
n_ile = (2.48/100) * M / 131.

But since the number of residues must be whole numbers, M must be such that both (1.65*M/100)/131 and (2.48*M/100)/131 are integers. But wait, that's only considering leucine and isoleucine. However, the protein may have other residues as well, so their presence would mean that M is larger than the sum of just leucine and isoleucine's contributions. But since we're looking for the minimum M, perhaps we can ignore other amino acids and consider that the protein is made only of leucine and isoleucine. Because if there are other amino acids, that would require a larger M to satisfy the same percentages, so the minimal M would be when the protein is composed solely of the amino acids in question. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the percentages are fixed. Let me think again.

Wait, the percentages are based on the total weight. So, for example, if the protein is made only of leucine and isoleucine, then the total weight would be n_leu*131 + n_ile*131 = (n_leu + n_ile)*131. The percentage of leucine would be (n_leu * 131) / ((n_leu +n_ile)*131) *100 = (n_leu/(n_leu +n_ile)) *100. Similarly for isoleucine. But that's not matching the given percentages, so the minimal M would come from considering M as the sum of all amino acids, but I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the smallest M such that when you compute (n_leu * 131)/M = 0.0165 and (n_ile *131)/M = 0.0248, where n_leu and n_ile are integers. Because M is the molecular weight, and the percentage is (weight of amino acid)/M *100. So, rearranging, n_leu = (0.0165 * M)/131, and n_ile = (0.0248 * M)/131.

Since n_leu and n_ile must be integers, 0.0165*M must be divisible by 131, and 0.0248*M must also be divisible by 131. Or wait, 0.0165*M must be a multiple of 131, and same for 0.0248*M.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, n_leu = (1.65/100) * M / 131 must be an integer, similarly for isoleucine.

So, M must be such that (1.65 * M ) / (100 * 131) is integer, and (2.48 * M ) / (100 * 131) is also integer.

But that seems a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can find M as the least common multiple of the denominators when 1.65 and 2.48 are converted into fractions over 100 and multiplied by M.

Wait, maybe to think in terms of fractions. Let me express 1.65% as 0.0165 and 2.48% as 0.0248.

So for leucine: n_leu = (0.0165 * M) / 131.

Similarly, for isoleucine: n_ile = (0.0248 * M) / 131.

Since n_leu and n_ile must be integers, (0.0165 M) must be divisible by 131, and (0.0248 M) must be divisible by 131.

But 0.0165 is 33/2000, and 0.0248 is approximately 248/10000, which is 62/2500. Hmm, but exact fractions might be better.

Wait, 1.65% is 1.65/100 = 33/2000. So, 0.0165 = 33/2000.

Similarly, 2.48% is 2.48/100 = 248/10000 = 62/2500.

So substituting:

n_leu = (33/2000) * M / 131.

n_ile = (62/2500) * M / 131.

These must both be integers. So, (33 M) / (2000 * 131) must be integer, and (62 M) / (2500 * 131) must be integer.

But perhaps a better way is to express M in terms that would make these fractions integers.

Let me denote M as being a multiple of (2000 * 131)/d1 and (2500 * 131)/d2, where d1 is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 33 and 2000*131, and similarly d2 for the other term.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find M such that both (33 M) is divisible by (2000 *131), and (62 M) is divisible by (2500 *131).

Wait, but let me think in terms of M needing to make both (33 M)/(2000 *131) and (62 M)/(2500 *131) integers.

Alternatively, M must be a multiple of (2000 *131)/gcd(33,2000*131) and similarly for the other term.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators when expressed with a common M.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find M such that M is a multiple of both (2000 *131)/33 and (2500 *131)/62.

Wait, let's compute those:

For leucine: (2000 *131)/33 ≈ (2000 *131) / 33 ≈ let's compute 2000*131=262000. 262000 /33 ≈ 7939.39. So M must be a multiple of 7939.39, but since M must be an integer, perhaps we can find the minimal M that is a multiple of 7939.39 and also satisfies the isoleucine condition.

Similarly, for isoleucine: (2500 *131)/62 = (2500*131)/62. Let's compute 2500*131=327500. 327500 /62 ≈ 5280.645.

So M must be a multiple of both approximately 7939.39 and 5280.645. The LCM of these two would give the minimal M. But wait, but these numbers are not integers, so perhaps I should use exact fractions.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set M as the least common multiple of the denominators when the fractions are expressed in their minimal form.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write M as (2000 *131 * k)/33 for some integer k, and similarly M must be equal to (2500 *131 * m)/62 for some integer m. Then, find the smallest M that satisfies both.

Wait, so:

M = (2000 *131 *k) /33 = (2500 *131 *m)/62.

We can set these equal and solve for k and m.

So,

(2000 *k)/33 = (2500 *m)/62.

Cross-multiplied:

2000 *k *62 = 2500 *m *33.

Simplify:

(2000/2500) * (62/33) *k = m.

Simplify the fractions:

2000/2500 = 4/5.

62/33 is as is.

So, 4/5 *62/33 *k = m.

Multiply 4*62 = 248, and 5*33=165.

So, 248/165 *k = m.

Since m must be an integer, 248k must be divisible by 165. Let's see, 248 and 165: let's find their GCD.

165 factors: 5 * 33 =5 *3*11.

248: 8 *31. So, GCD(165,248)=1.

So, 165 must divide k. So k must be a multiple of 165.

Let k=165 *t, where t is integer.

Then, m= (248/165) *165 t =248 t.

So, substituting back, M = (2000 *131 *k)/33.

k=165t, so:

M= (2000 *131 *165 t)/33.

Simplify: 165/33=5, so:

M= 2000 *131 *5 *t.

2000 *5=10000, so M=10000 *131 * t.

t is the smallest positive integer, so t=1.

Thus, M=10000 *131 =1,310,000 g/mol? That can't be right because the options are all around 1e3 to 1e4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I think I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, 10000 *131 is 1,310,000 which is 1.31e6 g/mol, which is way too high, and the options are much lower.

Hmm, so I must have gone wrong somewhere. Let me retrace.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me approach it differently.

The idea is to find the smallest M such that:

n_leu = (1.65 * M) / (131 *100) is an integer,

n_ile = (2.48 * M) / (131 *100) is an integer.

So,

n_leu = M * 1.65 / (131 * 100) = M * 0.0165 / 131,

n_ile = M * 2.48 / (131 *100) = M * 0.0248 /131.

These must be integers. Let's compute 0.0165 /131 and 0.0248 /131.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write M as a multiple that makes both n_leu and n_ile integers.

Let me compute M such that M * 0.0165 is divisible by 131, and M *0.0248 is also divisible by 131.

Wait, 0.0165 = 33/2000,

0.0248 = 62/2500.

So,

n_leu = M * 33/(2000 *131),

n_ile = M *62/(2500 *131).

These must be integers. So, 33 M must be divisible by (2000 *131) and 62 M must be divisible by (2500 *131).

Wait, but that's similar to before. Alternatively, perhaps I can find M such that M is a multiple of (2000 *131)/33 and (2500 *131)/62.

Wait, let me compute (2000 *131)/33 and (2500 *131)/62.

Compute 2000 *131 = 262,000.

262,000 /33 ≈ 7,939.3939.

Similarly, 2500 *131=327,500.

327,500 /62 ≈ 5,280.645.

So M must be a multiple of both 7,939.3939 and 5,280.645. But since M must be an integer, perhaps the minimal M is the least common multiple (LCM) of these two values, but they aren't integers.

Alternatively, perhaps M must be a common multiple of 262,000/33 and 327,500/62.

But 262,000/33 is 7,939.3939... which is 7,939 and 4/11.

Similarly, 327,500/62 = 5,280 and 40/62 =5,280 and 20/31.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about M in terms of the denominators.

n_leu must be integer: (33 M)/(2000 *131) must be integer.

Similarly, (62 M)/(2500 *131) must be integer.

So, M must be such that:

M is a multiple of (2000 *131)/gcd(33,2000*131),

and M is a multiple of (2500 *131)/gcd(62,2500*131).

Let me compute the GCDs.

First, compute gcd(33, 2000*131).

2000 factors: 2^4 *5^3.

131 is a prime number.

33 factors: 3*11.

So, the GCD is 1, because 33 shares no common factors with 2000 or 131.

Similarly, GCD(62, 2500*131).

62 factors: 2*31.

2500 factors: 2^2 * 5^4.

131 is prime.

So, GCD is 2, since 62 and 2500 share a factor of 2.

So,

M must be a multiple of (2000*131)/1 = 262,000,

and a multiple of (2500*131)/2 = (2500/2)*131 =1250 *131=1,625, 1250*131=1,625? Wait, 131*1000=131,000, 131*200=26,200 → 131*1250=131*(1000+200+50)=131,000 +26,200 +6,550= 163,750.

Wait, 2500*131=327,500. Divided by 2 is 163,750.

So, M must be a multiple of 262,000 and 163,750.

The LCM of
