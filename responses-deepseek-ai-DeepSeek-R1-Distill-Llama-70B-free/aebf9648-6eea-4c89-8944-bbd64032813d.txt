Okay, so I've got this problem about vapor pressure lowering, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these colligative properties, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, so the problem says that water at 30°C has a vapor pressure of 31.82 mm Hg. Then, when 25.0 grams of ethylene glycol is added to 1000 grams of water, the vapor pressure drops to 31.59 mm Hg. I need to find the molecular weight of ethylene glycol. The options are from A to J, and they're all numbers, so the answer is one of those.

Hmm, I remember that the vapor pressure lowering (ΔP) is related to the mole fraction of the solute. The formula I think is ΔP = X_solute * P°, where P° is the pure solvent vapor pressure. Or wait, maybe it's ΔP = P° - P_solution, which equals X_solute * P°, right?

So the formula I should use is probably the one for vapor pressure lowering: ΔP = (mol solute) / (mol solute + mol solvent) * P°. Wait, no, that's when you've got both solvent and solute contributing, but in dilute solutions, it's more like ΔP = (mol solute) / (mol solvent) * P°. Or maybe it's using mole fractions. Let me think.

Oh right, Raoult's Law says that the partial vapor pressure of the solvent is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent multiplied by the pure solvent's vapor pressure. So P_solution = X_solvent * P°. Therefore, the change in vapor pressure (ΔP) is P° - P_solution = X_solute * P°. Because X_solute is 1 - X_solvent, so ΔP = X_solute * P°.

Wait, no, because X_solvent + X_solute = 1, so P_solution = X_solvent * P°, which makes ΔP = P° - P_solution = (1 - X_solvent) * P° = X_solute * P°. So X_solute is moles solute divided by total moles, right? But in dilute solutions, the total moles is approximately moles solvent, so X_solute ≈ (moles solute) / (moles solvent). That's the approximation for dilute solutions.

So in this case, let's compute X_solute. The ΔP is 31.82 - 31.59 = 0.23 mm Hg. So ΔP = 0.23 mm Hg.

Then, X_solute = ΔP / P°, so X_solute is 0.23 / 31.82. Let me calculate that.

0.23 divided by 31.82 is approximately... let me see. 31.82 times 0.007 is about 0.222. So 0.23 /31.82 is roughly 0.007227, so about 0.00723.

So X_solute is approximately 0.00723.

Now, X_solute is (moles solute) / (moles solvent + moles solute). But since the solution is dilute, moles solvent is much larger than moles solute, so it's approximately (moles solute) / (moles solvent).

So, X_solute ≈ n_solute / n_solvent.

We can calculate n_solvent, which is moles of water. Since water is 1000 g, and molecular weight is about 18 g/mol, so n_solvent = 1000 / 18 ≈ 55.555... moles.

n_solute is moles of ethylene glycol, which is 25.0 g divided by its molecular weight (MW), which is what we're trying to find. So n_solute = 25.0 / MW.

Putting it together: X_solute ≈ (25.0/MW) / (1000/18) )

So, 0.00723 ≈ (25.0 / MW) * (18 / 1000 )

Let me write that equation. So, 0.00723 = (25 * 18) / (1000 * MW )

Wait, because (25/MW) / (1000/18) = (25 * 18) / (1000 * MW )

So compute 25 * 18: 25*18 is 450. So:

0.00723 = 450 / (1000 * MW )

Simplify denominator: 1000 * MW is 1000 MW.

So 0.00723 = 450 / (1000 MW )

Multiply both sides by (1000 MW):

0.00723 * 1000 MW = 450

0.00723 * 1000 is 7.23, so 7.23 * MW = 450

So MW = 450 /7.23 

Compute 450 /7.23. Let's see, 7.23 times 60 is 434. So 450-434 is 16. So 60 is 7.23*60=434.8, which is 7.23*60=434.8.

Wait, let me do actual division. 450 /7.23.

7.23 * 60 = 434.8, which leaves 450 -434.8=15.2.

15.2 /7.23 is approximately 2.1. So 60 +2.1=62.1.

Wait, alternatively, 7.23 times 62 is 7.23*(60+2)=7.23*60=434.8; 7.23*2=14.46. So 434.8+14.46=449.26. Close to 450. So 62 is about right.

So the MW is approximately 62.1, which would correspond to option A:62.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can lead me astray.

Let me compute 450 divided by 7.23 precisely.

7.23 * 62 = ?

7 *62=434, 0.23*62=14.36, total 448.36.

Wait, but 7.23 *62 = 448.36. 450 is 1.64 higher.

So 1.64 /7.23 = approx 0.227, so 62.227. So 62.23, so about 62.23 g/mol.

So the MW is approximately 62.2, which would match option A:62.

Wait, but let me think again. I used the approximation that X_solute is (n_solute)/(n_solvent). But in reality, X_solute is n_solute/(n_solvent +n_solute). Since n_solute is small compared to n_solvent, the difference is negligible, but let's make sure.

n_solute is 25/MW, and n_solvent is 1000/18≈55.5556.

So if MW is 62, n_solute is 25/62 ≈0.4032 moles. So n_solvent is about 55.5556, so n_total is 55.9588. So X_solute is 0.4032 /55.9588 ≈0.0072, which is close to what we had before. So the approximation holds.

So I think the correct answer is 62, which is option A.

To determine the molecular weight (MW) of ethylene glycol, we use the concept of vapor pressure lowering, which is a colligative property. The formula for vapor pressure lowering is:

\[
\Delta P = X_{\text{solute}} \cdot P^\circ
\]

where:
- \(\Delta P = P^\circ - P_{\text{solution}}\),
- \(X_{\text{solute}}\) is the mole fraction of the solute,
- \(P^\circ\) is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent.

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta P\)
The vapor pressure of pure water at 30°C is \(P^\circ = 31.82 \, \text{mm Hg}\), and the vapor pressure of the solution is \(P_{\text{solution}} = 31.59 \, \text{mm Hg}\). Thus:

\[
\Delta P = P^\circ - P_{\text{solution}} = 31.82 - 31.59 = 0.23 \, \text{mm Hg}.
\]

### Step 2: Relate \(\Delta P\) to \(X_{\text{solute}}\)
From Raoult's Law:

\[
\Delta P = X_{\text{solute}} \cdot P^\circ \implies X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\Delta P}{P^\circ}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{0.23}{31.82} \approx 0.00723.
\]

### Step 3: Express \(X_{\text{solute}}\) in terms of moles
The mole fraction of the solute is given by:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{n_{\text{solute}}}{n_{\text{solvent}} + n_{\text{solute}}}.
\]

For dilute solutions, \(n_{\text{solvent}} \gg n_{\text{solute}}\), so:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} \approx \frac{n_{\text{solute}}}{n_{\text{solvent}}}.
\]

Let:
- \(n_{\text{solvent}} = \frac{\text{mass of solvent}}{\text{molecular weight of solvent}} = \frac{1000}{18} \approx 55.56 \, \text{moles}\),
- \(n_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{molecular weight of solute}} = \frac{25.0}{\text{MW}}\).

Substituting into \(X_{\text{solute}}\):

\[
0.00723 \approx \frac{\frac{25.0}{\text{MW}}}{55.56}.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for MW
Rearranging:

\[
\text{MW} = \frac{25.0 \cdot 55.56}{0.00723}.
\]

First, calculate \(25.0 \cdot 55.56\):

\[
25.0 \cdot 55.56 = 1389.
\]

Now divide by \(0.00723\):

\[
\text{MW} = \frac{1389}{0.00723} \approx 62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The molecular weight of ethylene glycol is approximately **62 g/mol**, which corresponds to option **A**.
