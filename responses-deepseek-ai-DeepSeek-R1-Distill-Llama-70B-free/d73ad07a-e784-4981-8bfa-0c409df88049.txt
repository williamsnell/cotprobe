Okay, so I have this history question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a passage from Roland Doregelès' book "After 50 Years," written around 1965. The passage describes a scene where Doregelès hears about the mobilization for war in 1914. He runs to the Rue Drout, reads the message, and then goes to his newspaper's office to tell Georges Clemenceau. Clemenceau asks what Paris is saying, and Doregelès replies that it's singing. Clemenceau then says, "It will be all right then."

The question asks what we can infer from this passage about how Paris reacted to the mobilization. The options are from A to J, each suggesting different reactions: sorrow, fear, skepticism, indifference, or enthusiasm, either in Paris or across Europe.

Hmm. So the passage mentions that Paris is "singing," which I take as a positive or joyful reaction. Doregelès also says he was "dead tired but exhilarated," which suggests excitement and energy. Clemenceau's response that it will be all right implies confidence, maybe because of the positive public reaction.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this inference. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Mobilization was greeted with great sorrow in Paris. But the passage doesn't show sorrow. It's more upbeat with singing, so I don't think A is correct.

Option B: Met with fear and apprehension in Paris. Again, the passage doesn't indicate fear; instead, it's positive. So B is probably not right.

Option C: Greeted with skepticism in Paris. No, skepticism would imply doubt, but the reaction here seems enthusiastic, so C isn't it.

Option D: Met with indifference in Paris. Indifference would mean people didn't care, but the fact that Paris is "singing" suggests the opposite. So D is out.

Option E: Greeted with sorrow all across Europe. The passage only talks about Paris, not all of Europe, so E is too broad and also doesn't match the mood.

Option F: Met with indifference across Europe. Again, the passage doesn't discuss Europe-wide reactions, and the Paris reaction is positive, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Greeted with skepticism across Europe. Same issue as E and F; the passage doesn't discuss Europe, and the Paris reaction isn't skeptical.

Option H: Greeted with enthusiasm all across Europe. The passage only refers to Paris, so H is too broad in scope.

Option I: Met with fear across Europe. Again, passage doesn't cover Europe, and Paris's reaction isn't fearful.

Option J: Greeted with enthusiasm in Paris. This fits because the passage describes Paris singing and a positive mood, so J seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The passage says Doregelès was exhilarated and Paris was singing. Clemenceau's response also suggests positive feelings. So yes, J makes sense.

The passage describes a scene where Doregelès learns of the mobilization for war in 1914 and rushes to share the news with Clemenceau. Upon hearing that Paris is "singing," Clemenceau expresses optimism, indicating a positive reaction. This suggests that Paris greeted the mobilization with enthusiasm, rather than sorrow, fear, or indifference. Since the passage focuses on Paris and not Europe, the correct answer is:

J: mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris.

Answer: J
