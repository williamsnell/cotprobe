Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about methane stored in a tank, and I need to figure out how much heat must be transferred to make the pressure rise from 8 atm to 100 atm. Hmm. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the tank volume is 1.5 m³. Initially, the pressure is 8 atm, and the tank contains 30% liquid and 70% vapor by volume. So, the tank isn't entirely full of vapor; there's a significant liquid portion. Wait, but when the pressure increases, I guess the liquid will vaporize, and maybe more vapor will form.

I remember that for such problems, we probably need to consider the vapor-liquid equilibrium of methane. At a given temperature, there's a saturation pressure. If the pressure inside the tank increases beyond that, the vapor can condense, or if it's lower, more vapor can form. But here, we're increasing the pressure, so perhaps the vapor is getting compressed, and more liquid forms? Or wait, no—since the system is being heated, the temperature will increase, which might affect the saturation pressure.

Wait, the problem says heat is being transferred into the tank. So the temperature of the methane inside will increase. But wait, the tank's volume is fixed, so it's a constant volume process. So as heat is added, the temperature and pressure inside will rise.

But how does the composition (liquid vs. vapor) change with temperature and pressure? Hmm. At higher temperatures, the saturation pressure increases. So if the temperature increases, the vapor pressure goes up. But since the tank's pressure is rising, perhaps we're moving along the saturation curve.

Wait, but the tank isn't necessarily at the saturation pressure initially. Let me think. Initially, the tank is at 8 atm, with 30% liquid and 70% vapor by volume. So that's a two-phase mixture. At this condition, the temperature would be the saturation temperature corresponding to 8 atm. When we heat it, the temperature will increase, and so will the pressure. But because the volume is fixed, the pressure will rise as the temperature increases.

But I'm not exactly sure about the process. Maybe we can model the initial and final states and find the heat transfer required.

So the initial state is 8 atm, with 30% liquid and 70% vapor. Let's find the saturation temperature at 8 atm for methane. I don't remember exact values, but I suppose that's part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe we can use the ideal gas law for the vapor part, but wait, methane at 8 atm might not be ideal. Hmm.

Wait, the tank's volume is fixed. The initial state is a mixture of liquid and vapor. Let's denote the volume as V = 1.5 m³. The vapor occupies 70% of V, so V_vapor_initial = 0.7 * 1.5 = 1.05 m³. The liquid occupies 0.45 m³.

But how much mass is in each phase? Maybe we can find the mass using the specific volumes. Wait, the specific volume is the volume per unit mass. For the vapor, the specific volume v_g is V_vapor_initial / m_vapor. Similarly for the liquid, v_f is V_liquid_initial / m_liquid.

Wait, but for methane, the specific volume of the liquid is much smaller than that of the vapor. So most of the mass is in the liquid phase, even though the vapor takes up more volume.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the quality of the mixture. Wait, quality is the mass fraction of vapor in a liquid-vapor mixture. But the problem states volume fractions. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because quality is usually mass-based, not volume-based.

So, perhaps I should find the mass of vapor and liquid using the specific volumes at 8 atm.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Find the saturation temperature T1 at P1 = 8 atm.
2. Determine the specific volumes v_f and v_g at T1.
3. Calculate the mass of vapor (m_v) and liquid (m_l) using the volume occupied by each phase.
   - m_v = V_vapor_initial / v_g
   - m_l = V_liquid_initial / v_f
4. The total mass m_total = m_v + m_l.
5. When the pressure increases to P2 = 100 atm, the state will again be a saturated mixture? Or maybe it's all vapor? Or perhaps it's a compressed liquid? Hmm, at higher pressures, depending on the temperature, it could be subcooled liquid. But since we're adding heat, the temperature increases. So perhaps at P2=100 atm, the tank is again a mixture of liquid and vapor, but at a higher temperature.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe at P2=100 atm, the tank could be entirely vapor if the temperature is high enough, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single-phase vapor.

Alternatively, maybe the final state is superheated vapor at 100 atm, but that would require knowing the temperature corresponding to that pressure in the superheated region, which I don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the tank is always a saturated mixture, so that at any pressure, it's at the saturation temperature. But I'm not sure that's the case here because the heating could take it beyond saturation.

Wait, but the problem is about transferring heat. So the process may involve both vaporization and possibly superheating the vapor if the heat is enough.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the initial and final states as saturated mixtures. But I'm not certain if that's the case.

Wait, maybe the key here is to realize that the tank contains a fixed mass of methane, which changes phase as heat is added. So the initial state is a mixture, and the final state is another mixture (or perhaps all vapor) at higher pressure.

Wait, but when you add heat at constant volume, the pressure increases. So the process is a constant volume heating.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a control mass problem, where the mass of methane remains the same in the tank, but its phase distribution and temperature change as heat is added.

So the initial state is at 8 atm, T1 (saturation temp), with specific volumes v_f1 and v_g1.

The final state is at 100 atm, T2 (unknown, but possibly higher than saturation at 100 atm?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the final state might be a saturated mixture at 100 atm, but then the pressure would be the saturation pressure, implying that T2 is the saturation temperature at 100 atm.

Wait, but if the pressure is 100 atm, but the system is heated beyond the saturation temperature, then the vapor becomes superheated. But in that case, the pressure would be higher than the saturation pressure. Hmm, but then the system isn't in phase equilibrium anymore. So perhaps the final state is a saturated mixture at 100 atm.

Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the final state is all vapor. Let's think about that.

So, how to model this.

I think the correct approach is to model the initial and final states as saturated mixtures. So, initial state at P1=8atm, final state at P2=100atm, each at their respective saturation temperatures T1 and T2.

So, for each state, the specific volumes v_f and v_g can be found.

Then, the initial mass is m_initial = m_v1 + m_l1.

Similarly, the final mass is m_final = m_v2 + m_l2.

Wait, but the mass in the tank remains the same because the tank is sealed. So m_initial = m_final.

Wait no, wait. The tank is sealed, so the mass doesn't change. So m_initial = m_final.

Wait, but that's not correct because the initial mass is m_initial, and the final mass would be the same, but the distribution between liquid and vapor changes.

So, let me restate:

At initial state (P1=8atm, T1):

- V = 1.5 m³
- Volume of vapor: V_v1 = 0.7 * 1.5 = 1.05 m³
- Volume of liquid: V_l1 = 0.45 m³

The mass of vapor is m_v1 = V_v1 / v_g1(T1)
The mass of liquid is m_l1 = V_l1 / v_f1(T1)
Total mass m = m_v1 + m_l1

At final state (P2=100atm, T2):

Assuming it's a saturated mixture, so T2 is the saturation temperature at P2=100atm.

The specific volumes at P2 are v_f2 and v_g2.

The volumes of vapor and liquid would adjust such that:

m_v2 = m_v1 (if all the vapor stays as vapor?), no, wait the masses can change as some liquid vaporizes or vapor condenses.

Wait, no, the mass is conserved, but the split between liquid and vapor can change. So m_v2 + m_l2 = m_v1 + m_l1.

But perhaps the final state can have a different quality.

Wait, but perhaps the final state is all vapor. Because when you add enough heat, the liquid evaporates, and the tank becomes all vapor. Let's check if that's possible.

The final pressure is 100 atm. Let's find the specific volume of methane vapor at 100 atm. If the specific volume is such that the total volume V=1.5 m³ is less than or equal to the volume if all mass were vapor, then the final state would be all vapor.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a saturated mixture.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the final state as a saturated mixture, but perhaps it's all vapor. Let me think.

So, to proceed, I need to find the specific volumes at 8 atm and 100 atm. But I don't have the actual data for methane's specific volumes at these pressures. So perhaps I can make some assumptions or use approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law for the vapor phase, assuming that at low pressures, the vapor behaves ideally. But 8 atm is not that low, and 100 atm is quite high, so ideal gas might not be accurate.

But maybe for the sake of proceeding, I can make some approximations.

Wait, perhaps I can find the saturation temperatures for 8 atm and 100 atm. Let me try to recall or find some data. Methane's boiling point at 1 atm is about 111.7 K (-161.5°C). At higher pressures, the saturation temperature increases.

I think at 8 atm, the saturation temperature is higher than 111.7 K. Let me say, for example, T1 is around 120 K. Similarly, at 100 atm, the saturation temperature might be, say, around 180 K? I'm not sure, but these are rough estimates.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the saturation properties of methane. But without specific data, it's challenging. Maybe I can think of the problem as involving the latent heat and the specific heats.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the initial and final states as two-phase mixtures and compute the heat required to go from one state to another, considering both the latent heat (for vaporization) and sensible heat (temperature change).

Wait, but without knowing the exact masses and the specific heat capacities, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the entire process occurs at constant volume with the vapor behaving as an ideal gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the initial and final states.

Initial state:

- P1 = 8 atm
- V = 1.5 m³
- 30% liquid, 70% vapor by volume.

Assuming that the mixture is at the saturation temperature T1 corresponding to P1=8 atm.

The mass of vapor is m_v1 = (V_vapor) / v_g1
The mass of liquid is m_l1 = (V_liquid) / v_f1

Total mass m = m_v1 + m_l1

Final state:

- P2 = 100 atm
- V = 1.5 m³
- Unknown phase distribution, could be all vapor, or a mixture.

Assuming it's a saturated mixture at T2, the specific volumes v_f2 and v_g2 would apply.

Alternatively, if the final state is all vapor, then m = m_v2 = P2 V / (R T2)

Wait, but that would require knowing T2, which is the temperature after heating. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the temperature at which the tank is filled with vapor at 100 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves heating the mixture to the point where all the liquid evaporates, and then further heating the vapor.

But without knowing the exact properties, perhaps the intended approach is to model the vapor as an ideal gas, and compute the heat required to raise the pressure from 8 atm to 100 atm, considering the change in temperature and the latent heat.

Wait, but let me try to model it step by step.

First, calculate the initial mass.

At P1=8 atm, T1 is the saturation temperature.

The specific volume of vapor v_g1 can be found from methane tables, but since I don't have them, I'll proceed with an example.

Suppose at 8 atm, v_g1 = 0.02 m³/kg and v_f1 = 0.00002 m³/kg (as specific volume of liquid is much smaller than vapor).

So, V_vapor_initial = 1.05 m³, so mass of vapor m_v1 = 1.05 / 0.02 = 52.5 kg.

V_liquid_initial = 0.45 m³, so mass of liquid m_l1 = 0.45 / 0.00002 = 22500 kg.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Hmm, perhaps the specific volumes are different. Maybe v_g1 is larger.

Wait, wait—maybe I should think in terms of molar volumes. At 8 atm, perhaps the molar volume is higher.

Wait, at 1 atm, methane's molar volume at boiling is about 0.02 m³/kg (since molecular weight is about 16 g/mol, so 1 mole is 16g, and 1 m³ is 1000 kg/m³, but perhaps I'm getting units mixed up.)

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that at 8 atm, the saturation temperature is higher, say around 120 K, and the specific volume of vapor is about 0.02 m³/kg.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here because I don't have the exact specific volume values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the vapor is an ideal gas. Let's proceed with that.

At initial state:

P1 = 8 atm = 8 * 101325 Pa = 810,600 Pa.

V_vapor_initial = 0.7 * 1.5 = 1.05 m³.

Using ideal gas law, m_v1 = (P1 V_vapor_initial) / (R T1)

But T1 is the saturation temperature at 8 atm. Let's say T1 is about 120 K.

R for methane is R = 8.314 / 16 = 0.519625 J/mol·K.

Wait, no, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and for methane, M=16 g/mol, so R_specific = 8.314 / 0.016 kg/mol = 519.625 J/kg·K.

Wait, no, wait: 16 g/mol is 0.016 kg/mol.

So R_specific = 8.314 / 0.016 ≈ 519.625 J/kg·K.

So m_v1 = (P1 * V_vapor_initial) / (R_specific * T1)

= (810600 Pa * 1.05 m³) / (519.625 J/kg·K * 120 K)

Calculating numerator: 810600 * 1.05 = 850,830 J (since Pa·m³ = J).

Denominator: 519.625 * 120 ≈ 62355 J/kg.

So m_v1 ≈ 850830 / 62355 ≈ 13.65 kg.

Similarly, the mass of liquid would be the remaining mass. But wait, the volume of liquid is 0.45 m³, and if the liquid's specific volume is v_f1, then m_l1 = V_l1 / v_f1.

But without knowing v_f1, perhaps I can't proceed this way. Alternatively, maybe the liquid's mass is negligible compared to the vapor's mass, but that doesn't seem right because the liquid has a much higher density.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the entire tank's contents are at the saturation conditions, and the specific volume is some average.

Wait, maybe I should compute the initial total mass, considering both phases.

But without specific volume data, this approach is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the methane is an ideal gas, and the heat transfer is calculated based on the change in internal energy. But that would be the case if the tank were entirely filled with vapor, but initially, it's only 70% vapor.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the liquid and only consider the vapor, but that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the process is such that the liquid evaporates as heat is added, and the tank becomes all vapor at 100 atm.

So, perhaps the heat required is the sum of the latent heat to vaporize the liquid and the sensible heat to raise the temperature of the vapor.

But again, without the latent heat and specific heat values, it's difficult.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the ideal gas law for the final state, assuming all the methane is in vapor form.

So, initial state:

At 8 atm, 70% vapor.

Assuming ideal gas behavior for vapor:

m_v1 = (P1 V_vapor1) / (R_specific T1)

But without T1, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the initial and final states can be connected via the ideal gas law.

Wait, perhaps the process can be considered as heating the vapor from 8 atm to 100 atm at constant volume, with the liquid evaporating as needed.

Wait, but the volume is fixed, so for the vapor phase, if it's an ideal gas, then P1 V = n1 R T1, and P2 V = n2 R T2. But since the volume of vapor changes as liquid evaporates, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial mixture is at 8 atm, and upon heating, all the liquid evaporates, and the vapor is heated to 100 atm.

So, perhaps the heat transfer includes:

1. The latent heat required to vaporize the liquid at initial conditions.
2. The sensible heat required to raise the temperature of the vapor from T1 to T2, where T2 is the temperature corresponding to 100 atm.

But
