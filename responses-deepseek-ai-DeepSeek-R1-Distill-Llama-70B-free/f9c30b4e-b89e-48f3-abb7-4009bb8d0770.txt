Okay, so I've got this question about literacy rates in Russia and the Soviet Union from 1897 to 1955. The question is asking which segment of the population probably benefited the most from the rising literacy rates. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll look at the data. The literacy rate was pretty low in 1897 at 24%, then it jumped to 45% by 1917. Then it kept increasing: 56% in 1926, 75% in 1937, 81.1% in 1939, and a whopping 99.9% by 1955. So there's a steady rise, especially a big jump after the 1920s.

Now, I need to think about who would benefit most from higher literacy. Literacy means more people can read and write, which usually opens up opportunities like better jobs, education, and participation in society. So I should consider which groups were less literate before and then gained more from these improvements.

Looking at the options:

A: Industrial laborers in major cities. Cities might have had better access to education, so maybe these workers benefited. They could find better jobs as they became literate.

B: Officers in the armed forces. They probably already had higher literacy rates since they needed to read and write for their roles. So maybe they weren't the biggest beneficiaries.

C: The urban middle class. Again, they might have had better access to education before, so the increase might not benefit them as much proportionally.

D: Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy. Clergy would have been literate already since they deal with religious texts, so this group probably wasn't the main beneficiaries.

E: The Russian nobility. They were already educated and wealthy, so increased literacy wouldn't affect them as much.

F: Foreign diplomats. They wouldn't be part of the Russian-speaking population, so this doesn't apply.

G: Russian-speaking immigrants in non-Russian territories. Not sure how much this group was targeted by Soviet education policies. They might have had their own challenges, but I'm not certain if they're the main beneficiaries.

H: The rural peasantry. This group was likely the least literate initially. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of Russia's population was rural peasants. If literacy rates improved, especially after the Soviet policies which pushed education, this group would have seen a massive change. They could access better information, jobs, and participate more in society.

I: Members of the Russian Imperial family. They were already part of the elite and probably literate, so no benefit needed here.

J: Artists and writers. They probably already had higher literacy, so the rising rates might not have been as impactful for them.

So, putting it together, the rural peasantry (option H) would have been the largest segment that saw significant improvement. They were the majority and had low literacy before, so the increase would have a big impact on their opportunities.

The rural peasantry would have benefited the most from rising literacy rates, as they were the largest segment with initially low literacy and stood to gain significantly from improved education and opportunities.

Answer: H
