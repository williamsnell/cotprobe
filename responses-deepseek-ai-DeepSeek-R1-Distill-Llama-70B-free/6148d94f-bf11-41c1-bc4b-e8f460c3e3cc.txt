Question:

Trace the development of aggression from infancy to adolescence.

G: Aggression only manifests in social settings and is not present in solitary behaviors
H: Aggression is mainly caused by parental behavior
I: Aggression emerges as a response to academic pressures during the school-age years and does not appear before this stage
J: Aggression is a result of an identity crisis during adolescence

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the development of aggression from infancy to adolescence. Let's see. The question is asking me to trace how aggression develops through these stages.

I remember that aggression isn't something that just pops up in one stage. Infants and toddlers do show aggressive behaviors, like hitting or throwing things, but it's not as complex as what we see later. I think it's related to frustration and not knowing how to express themselves. So, maybe in infancy, aggression is more about tantrums and not having the language skills yet.

Then, as children grow into early childhood, their aggression might become more intentional. They might start understanding social dynamics better, so their aggressive behaviors could be more calculated. Also, they learn by observing their parents and the environment around them. So parental behavior and societal factors definitely play a role here.

Moving into middle childhood and adolescence, aggression probably becomes more complex. Teens might deal with peer pressure, school stress, and societal expectations. Their aggression could manifest differently, like verbal aggression or more calculated actions rather than just physical outbursts. It's also a time when they're trying to establish their identity, which might lead to different forms of aggressive behavior as they navigate social hierarchies and pressures.

Looking at the options, option B says that aggression starts in infancy with temper tantrums, influenced by parents and society, and evolves into more complex forms during childhood and adolescence due to frustration and societal pressures. That sounds right because it covers the progression from early, more primitive forms to more developed ones influenced by various factors.

I should make sure the other options don't make more sense. Option A says aggression only starts in adolescence, which I know isn't true. Infants and toddlers do show aggression. Option C claims it's innate and doesn't change, but that's not accurate because the forms and reasons behind aggression do change as a child develops. Option D says it's learned in middle childhood without prior signs, which is incorrect because we see aggression earlier.

Option E attributes it solely to genetics, which ignores the environmental factors. Option F says it's only learned from peers in early childhood, but that's too narrow. Option G says it's only in social settings, but aggression can occur when a child is alone too, like when they're frustrated. Option H only blames parents, but societal factors are also important. Option I says it starts with academic pressures in school, but that's way too late because aggression is present much earlier. Option J ties it to an identity crisis in adolescence, which is only a part of it, not the whole story.

So, the best answer is B because it correctly outlines the progression and influencing factors from infancy through adolescence.
