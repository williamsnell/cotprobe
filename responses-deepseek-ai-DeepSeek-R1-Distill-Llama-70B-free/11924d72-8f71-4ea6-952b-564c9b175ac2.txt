F: 1000 times as much
G: 10,000 times as much
H: 10 times as much
I: 100 times as much
J: 1/10 as much

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. The question is about what happens to your weight when the planet you're standing on shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter. Hmm, I remember that weight is related to gravity, so I should think about how the planet's size affects the gravitational force on you.

Wait, the formula for gravitational force is F = G*(M*m)/(r²), right? G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, m is your mass, and r is the radius of the planet. Oh wait, the diameter is given, so the radius is half of that. But in this problem, the diameter becomes one-tenth, so the radius also becomes one-tenth of the original.

So, the original radius is, say, R, and the new radius is R/10. The mass of the planet, M, stays the same as per the question. So plugging into the formula, the new force F' would be G*M*m/( (R/10)² ). Let's see, (R/10)^2 is R²/100. So the denominator becomes R² over 100, which means the whole fraction becomes 100*(G*M*m)/R². So F' = 100F, where F is the original force.

Wait, that would mean the force (which is your weight) increases by a factor of 100. So you'd weigh 100 times as much as before. Looking at the options, option I is 100 times as much. So the answer should be I.

But wait, let me double-check. If the radius is smaller, gravity increases because you're closer to the center. Since the radius is one-tenth, the gravity increases by (1/(1/10))², which is 100. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer is I: 100 times as much.

To determine how your weight changes when the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, we use the formula for gravitational force:

\[
F = G \frac{Mm}{r^2}
\]

Here, \( M \) is the planet's mass (constant), \( m \) is your mass (constant), and \( r \) is the planet's radius. Since the diameter decreases to one-tenth, the radius also decreases to one-tenth of its original value (\( r' = \frac{r}{10} \)).

Substituting the new radius into the formula, the new gravitational force becomes:

\[
F' = G \frac{Mm}{\left(\frac{r}{10}\right)^2} = G \frac{Mm}{\frac{r^2}{100}} = 100 \cdot G \frac{Mm}{r^2} = 100F
\]

This shows that the gravitational force (and thus your weight) increases by a factor of 100. Therefore, you would weigh 100 times as much on the shrunken planet.

The correct answer is:

I: 100 times as much

Answer: I
