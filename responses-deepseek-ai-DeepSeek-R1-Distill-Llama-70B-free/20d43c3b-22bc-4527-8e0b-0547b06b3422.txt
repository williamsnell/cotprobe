Question:

What is the 'equitable result' in the law and practice of maritime delimitation?

Options:

A: It is the only method of delimitation that international courts and tribunals follow
B: An equitable result is what a judge or the arbitrator would decide ex aequo et bono, i.e. upon their discretion and in light of what they consider as fair and equitable in a delimitation case
C: It is the end result that all delimitations of areas of continental shelf and EEZ should achieve, after, however, drawing a provisional 'equidistance line' and adjusting the zone in the light of the relevant circumstances and the proportionality test.
D: Achieving an equitable result is an old method of delimitation which is currently not applicable

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about maritime delimitation and the concept of an 'equitable result'. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that maritime delimitation deals with how countries determine their maritime boundaries, especially regarding areas like the continental shelf and exclusive economic zones (EEZ). International law plays a big role here, and I think the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is key.

The question is asking about the 'equitable result'. I recall that in maritime boundary disputes, courts and tribunals don't just draw a line based solely on one method. Instead, they aim for a fair outcome that considers various factors. So, it's not just about applying a strict formula but looking at what's equitable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "It is the only method..." Hmm, I don't think that's right. I remember that there are different methods like the equidistance line, which is often used as a starting point. But it's not the only method, and courts adjust it based on equitable considerations. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: This says the result is what a judge decides ex aequo et bono, based on their discretion. Ex aequo et bono means deciding in fairness and equity, but I think this is more of a general principle rather than the specific method. Also, international courts usually look for equitable results by considering relevant circumstances, not just arbitrary discretion. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C: This describes an equitable result as the end goal after drawing a provisional equidistance line and then adjusting based on relevant circumstances and proportionality. That rings a bell. The process usually involves first drawing an equidistance line (like the median line) and then adjusting it to account for factors that would make the result inequitable, such as the presence of islands, coastal geography, or proportionality of the areas. So C sounds accurate.

Option D: Suggests it's an old method no longer applicable. That doesn't make sense because the concept of achieving an equitable result is still central in current maritime delimitation cases. So D is incorrect.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be C. The equitable result is achieved by first drawing a provisional line (like the equidistance) and then adjusting it based on relevant factors, ensuring the outcome is fair and equitable.

The 'equitable result' in maritime delimitation refers to the end goal of achieving a fair and balanced outcome when determining maritime boundaries. This process typically involves drawing a provisional equidistance line and then adjusting it based on relevant circumstances and the proportionality test. This approach ensures that the final result is equitable, considering factors such as coastal geography, the presence of islands, and the proportionality of the areas involved.

Answer: C
