Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this marketing question. Let me read it again. Robert is a marketer for a global consumer products company. He's working on a promotional campaign for a new international market. He wants the campaign to be clearly understood and not offend anyone. The question is asking which external environmental factor is influencing him.

Hmm, the external environment in marketing usually refers to the factors outside the company that can affect its operations. I remember there are several factors like economic, socio-cultural, political, legal, etc.

So, Robert is concerned about the campaign being understood and not offending. That makes me think about cultural aspects. Like, cultural differences can affect how people perceive messages. If the campaign isn't adapted to the local culture, it might not resonate well or could even be offensive.

Wait, the socio-cultural environment includes things like beliefs, values, customs, and social norms. So if Robert is making sure the campaign fits these aspects, he's influenced by the socio-cultural environment.

Let me think about other options. Economic environment is about income levels and such, which affects purchasing power but not directly about understanding and offending. Political environment is more about government policies and stability. Legal environment is about laws, like advertising regulations. Competitive environment is about other companies. Geographic is about location, maybe climate affecting distribution. Technological could be about how people access the ads. Natural environment is about environmental issues. International environment might be broader, but I think socio-cultural is more specific here. Demographic is about age, gender, etc., which is part of socio-cultural but maybe a subset.

So the best fit is the socio-cultural environment.

Robert is ensuring his promotional campaign is understood and doesn't offend, which relates to cultural factors. The socio-cultural environment includes beliefs, values, and norms that influence consumer perceptions. This fits best.
