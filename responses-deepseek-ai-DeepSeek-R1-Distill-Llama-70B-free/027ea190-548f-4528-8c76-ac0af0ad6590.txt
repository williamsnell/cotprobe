Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. The question is to estimate the quotient of 117.83 divided by 5.67 using compatible numbers. The options are A through J, each giving a different estimate. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that compatible numbers are numbers that are easy to work with, like rounding to make calculations simpler. So I think I should round both the dividend and the divisor to numbers that are close but easier to compute.

Looking at the dividend, 117.83. Hmm, that's pretty close to 120, right? Because 117 is just 3 less than 120, and the decimal part is .83, which is almost a whole number. So rounding 117.83 up to 120 makes sense because it's easier to divide by something else.

Now the divisor is 5.67. That's a bit trickier. I think about what's a good number near 5.67 that's easy to divide into 120. Well, 5 is a nice number, but maybe 6 is even better because 120 divided by 6 is 20. Wait, but 5.67 is a bit more than 5.5, which is halfway between 5 and 6. Maybe I should round it to 6 because it's closer to 6 than to 5. Alternatively, I could think of it as 5.67 being approximately 5.5 or 6.

Wait, let me think again. If I round 5.67 to 6, then dividing 120 by 6 gives me 20. But 5.67 is less than 6, so dividing by a smaller number would give a larger result. Oh wait, no, because if the divisor is smaller, the quotient is bigger. So if I use 6 as the divisor, which is larger than 5.67, the result would be smaller than the actual quotient. That means the actual answer would be a bit higher than 20. But looking at the options, 20 is an option (option A), but the options also include numbers like 50, which is much higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in rounding. Let me try another approach. Let's see, 117.83 divided by 5.67. Maybe I can estimate both numbers to the nearest ten or so. 117 is about 120, which is 100 + 20. And 5.67 is roughly 5.5 or 6. So 120 divided by 6 is 20, as I thought before. But wait, 5.67 is about 5.5, which is 11/2. So 120 divided by 5.5 is 120*(2/11). Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 11 is approximately 10.909, so multiplying by 2 gives about 21.818. So that's around 21.8.

But wait, that's using more precise numbers. The question is about using compatible numbers to estimate, so maybe I should round both numbers to make it easier. Let me try rounding 117.83 to 120 and 5.67 to 6, which gives me 20.

But looking at the options, 20 is option A, but I also see option F is about 30, and option J is about 50. Hmm, maybe I'm not rounding correctly. Let me think differently. Perhaps I should round 117.83 down to 100 and 5.67 up to 10, but that would give me 10, which is option E, but that seems too low.

Alternatively, maybe I should round 117.83 to 110 and 5.67 to 5. Let's see, 110 divided by 5 is 22. That's still close to 20. So maybe the answer is around 20, which is option A. But wait, I thought earlier that rounding 5.67 to 6 gives 20, which is lower than the actual value. Because 5.67 is less than 6, so the actual quotient should be higher than 20. So perhaps 20 is an underestimate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another method. Let's approximate both numbers to one or two significant figures. 117.83 is approximately 120, and 5.67 is approximately 6. So 120 divided by 6 is 20. But as I thought before, since 5.67 is less than 6, the actual quotient should be a bit higher than 20. So maybe the answer is around 20, but perhaps a little more. But looking at the options, 20 is an option, but so is 21 not listed, but the closest higher option is maybe 30, which is F. But that's a big jump.

Alternatively, maybe I should round 117.83 to 110, because 117 is closer to 110 than 120. Wait, no, 117 is 7 away from 110 and 3 away from 120, so 120 is a better approximation. So 110 divided by 5.67, but then that's more complicated.

Wait another approach: Use fractions. 5.67 is almost 5 and 2/3, which is 5.666..., so 17/3. So 5.67 ≈ 17/3. So 117.83 divided by (17/3) is 117.83 * (3/17). Let's compute that. 117.83 times 3 is 353.49, and then divide by 17. Let's see, 17 times 20 is 340, so 353.49 minus 340 is 13.49. So 20 with a remainder of 13.49, which is about 20.79. So approximately 20.8, which is about 21. So the answer would be around 21, which is close to 20.

But the options don't have 21. They have 20 (A) and 30 (F), and others. So perhaps the best estimate here is 20, which is option A.

Wait, but another way to look at it is to use rounding to make the numbers compatible. For example, 117.83 is close to 120, and 5.67 is close to 6, so 120 ÷ 6 = 20. So the answer is about 20, which is option A.

But wait, is there a better way to approximate this? Let me think about how much 5.67 times 20 is. 5.67 * 20 = 113.4. But the dividend is 117.83, which is higher than 113.4, so 20 is a bit low. Let me see, how much more? 117.83 - 113.4 = 4.43. So 4.43 divided by 5.67 is about 0.78. So the total would be about 20.78, so approximately 21. So 21 is closer to 20 than to 30, so the estimate would be about 20.

But wait, the options don't have 21, so the closest is 20, which is A. Alternatively, maybe I should round 117.83 to 110 and 5.67 to 5, which gives 22, but that's still close to 20.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in choosing the compatible numbers. Let me see. Perhaps rounding 117.83 to 100 and 5.67 to 5. 100 ÷ 5 is 20. Again, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I should use 120 ÷ 5, which is 24, but that's not one of the options either. Wait, no, 5.67 is closer to 6 than to 5, so rounding to 5 would give a higher estimate, which might not be as accurate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking to use compatible numbers, which are numbers that are easy to compute. So 120 ÷ 6 = 20 is the simplest way, giving 20 as the estimate. So the answer should be A: about 20.

But wait, earlier I thought that since 5.67 is less than 6, the actual quotient would be higher than 20. So maybe the estimate should be a bit higher, like 21, but since that's not an option, the closest would be 20. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 5.67 is closer to 5.5, so let's try that.

If I round 5.67 to 5.5, then 120 ÷ 5.5 is approximately 21.8, as I calculated before. But 21.8 is still closer to 20 than to 30. So again, 20 is the best estimate among the options given.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F is about 30, and option J is about 50. Those are much higher. Could I have made a mistake in my initial approach? Let me try another method.

Another way to estimate is to see how many times 5.67 fits into 117.83. Let's see, 5.67 times 20 is 113.4, as I calculated before. 5.67 times 21 is 119.07. 5.67 times 21 is 119.07, which is still less than 117.83? No, wait, 5.67 * 21 is 119.07, which is higher than 117.83. So 21 times would give 119.07, which is a bit more than 117.83. So that means the actual quotient is between 20 and 21, closer to 21. So the estimate would be about 21, but since that's not an option, the closest is 20, which is A.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the options are considering rounding differently. Suppose I round 117.83 to 120 and 5.67 to 5, then 120 ÷ 5 is 24. But 24 isn't an option either. Alternatively, if I round 117.83 to 100 and 5.67 to 10, that gives 10, which is option E, but that seems too low.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for numbers that are easier to compute. Like 117.83 is about 120, and 5.67 is about 5.5. So 120 ÷ 5.5 is approximately 21.8, which again is about 22, but still closer to 20 than to 30.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the actual division without estimation. Let me try to compute 117.83 ÷ 5.67 more accurately.

First, 5.67 goes into 117 how many times? Let's see, 5.67 * 20 = 113.4. Subtracting that from 117.83 gives 4.43. Then, bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals), making it 44.3. 5.67 goes into 44.3 about 7 times (5.67*7=39.69). Subtracting gives 4.61. Bring down another zero, making it 46.1. 5.67 goes into that about 8 times (5.67*8=45.36). Subtracting gives 0.74. So the quotient is approximately 20.78, so about 20.8.

So the actual value is around 20.8, which is closest to 21. But since the options don't have 21, the closest is 20, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: about 20

B: about 80

C: about 60

D: about 40

E: about 10

F: about 30

G: about 100

H: about 70

I: about 90

J: about 50

So the options are in increments of 10, except for some. So 20 is A, 30 is F, etc. So 20.8 is closest to 20, so A is the correct choice.

But wait, earlier I thought that because 5.67 is less than 6, the actual quotient is higher than 20, which it is, but only by about 0.8, so still closer to 20 than to 30.

So the correct answer should be A: about 20.
</think>

To estimate the quotient \( 117.83 \div 5.67 \) using compatible numbers, we can round the dividend and divisor to simpler values. Rounding \( 117.83 \) to \( 120 \) and \( 5.67 \) to \( 6 \) makes the calculation easier. 

Performing the division with these rounded numbers:
\[
120 \div 6 = 20
\]

This gives an estimate of \( 20 \). To refine the estimate, note that \( 5.67 \) is slightly less than \( 6 \), which means the actual quotient will be slightly higher than \( 20 \). Calculating more precisely, the actual quotient is approximately \( 20.8 \). However, since the options are in increments of 10, the closest and most reasonable estimate is \( 20 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A: about 20**.
