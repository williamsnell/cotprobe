Okay, so I've got this question about economics, specifically about how the Japanese economy expanding would affect U.S. net exports and the values of the dollar and yen. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

First, let's think about what happens when a country's economy expands. I remember that when an economy grows, people have more income, so they buy more goods and services, including imports. So if Japan's economy is expanding, they're probably buying more stuff from other countries, including the U.S.

So U.S. net exports would be the value of exports minus imports. If Japan is buying more from the U.S., U.S. exports should increase. That would make U.S. net exports go up. So the first part of the question, U.S. net exports, should increase.

Now, what about the value of the dollar? When a country's exports increase, the demand for its currency (in this case, the dollar) goes up because other countries need dollars to buy U.S. goods. So if Japan is buying more from the U.S., the demand for dollars increases. When demand for a currency rises, its value (or exchange rate) appreciates, meaning the dollar becomes stronger. So the value of the dollar should increase.

Next, the value of the yen. Since the dollar is getting stronger, the yen would weaken relative to the dollar. Because if one currency goes up, the other must go down in the exchange rate. So the yen's value would decrease compared to the dollar.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing things up. Let me think again. Japan's economy is expanding, so they import more. U.S. exports go up, so the U.S. trade balance (net exports) increases. Higher exports mean more demand for dollars, so dollar strengthens. Yen weakens because if the dollar is stronger, you need more yen to buy one dollar. So yes, the yen's value decreases.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where U.S. net exports increase, dollar increases, and yen decreases.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says Increase (net exports), Increase (dollar), Decrease (yen). That matches what I thought.

Other options: Option B has all increases, which can't be right because the yen can't increase if the dollar is increasing. Option D seems correct.

When the Japanese economy expands, it leads to increased demand for imports, including U.S. goods and services. This results in higher U.S. exports and, consequently, an increase in U.S. net exports. As U.S. exports rise, the demand for the U.S. dollar increases, causing the dollar to appreciate (its value increases). Conversely, the yen's value decreases relative to the dollar because a stronger dollar means the yen is weaker in comparison.

The correct option reflects these changes: U.S. net exports increase, the value of the dollar increases, and the value of the yen decreases.

Answer: D
