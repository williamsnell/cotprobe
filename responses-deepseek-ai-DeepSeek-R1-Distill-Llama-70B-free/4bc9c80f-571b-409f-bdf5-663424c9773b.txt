Question:

A shopper purchased a can of sardines, which had been produced by a fish company. A short while later at home, the shopper was preparing a sardine sandwich when she opened the can and, to her astonishment, she saw a decomposed mouse. The shopper became nauseated and vomited upon seeing the mouse. After consulting her attorney, the shopper initiated a strict liability action against the company. At trial, the shopper presented into evidence the sardine can with the company's label, along with other corroborating evidence. The attorney representing the company objected to the introduction of the label on the can. The trial court should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because the label is direct evidence of the company's responsibility.
B: overrule the objection, because the label is the best evidence showing that the can was produced by the company.
C: sustain the objection, because the company could not have foreseen the mouse in the can.
D: sustain the objection, because the label does not prove the company's negligence.
E: overrule the objection, as the label is the primary link between the product and the company.
F: overrule the objection, because the label is self-authenticating.
G: overrule the objection, because the label is a significant piece of evidence in strict liability cases.
H: sustain the objection, because the shopper's proper cause of action is for infliction of emotional distress, not strict liability.
I: sustain the objection, because the label is not a valid form of evidence.
J: sustain the objection, because there is no corroborating evidence that the company placed the label on the can.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the concept of strict liability and the admissibility of a label on a can as evidence. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A shopper buys a can of sardines produced by a fish company. When she opens it, she finds a decomposed mouse inside, which makes her nauseated and vomit. She sues the company under strict liability. At trial, she presents the can with the company's label as evidence, and the company's attorney objects.

The question is about whether the trial court should overrule or sustain the objection. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

So, I need to remember the rules about evidence, particularly the best evidence rule and what's required for strict liability in product liability cases.

Strict liability in products cases generally requires that the product was unreasonably dangerous, the seller was in the business of selling such products, and the product reached the consumer without substantial change. The plaintiff must prove that the defect existed when the product left the manufacturer.

Now, the issue is whether the label on the can is admissible. The company's lawyer objects to the label being introduced into evidence. The shopper's attorney wants it as evidence that the company produced the can.

I think the best evidence rule comes into play here. The best evidence rule (Federal Rule of Evidence 1002) states that to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original is required except as otherwise provided by rule. However, there's an exception when the existence of the writing is being proven, not the contents. So, if the purpose is to show that the label was on the can, which in turn shows the company produced it, the original might not be necessary because it's about the existence, not the content.

Wait, but in this case, the label itself is being offered as evidence. The label is a writing, so if the content is at issue, the original would be needed. But if the existence is the point, then maybe a copy or the can itself is enough.

Wait, but the shopper is presenting the can with the label. So she's presenting the physical object. The label is attached to the can, so it's not a copy. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply because we're not trying to prove the content of the label, just that the label was on the can. So the can itself is the best evidence of the fact that the company produced it.

Alternatively, if the label's content was important, then the original would be needed, but here, the label's existence on the can is what's important. So the can with the label would be admissible as physical evidence, not under the best evidence rule.

But looking at the options, option B says "overrule the objection because the label is the best evidence showing that the can was produced by the company." But wait, the best evidence rule doesn't require the label itself as the best evidence; the can with the label is a physical object and would be admissible as a demonstrative evidence or real evidence, not subject to the best evidence rule because it's not about proving the content of the label but rather the fact that the can had the company's label on it.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The best evidence rule applies when the terms of the writing are in issue. Here, the writing (label) is being used to show that the company produced the can. So the fact that the label exists on the can is what's important, not the specific words on the label. Therefore, the original label isn't necessary because the content isn't the issueâ€”just its existence. So the can itself is sufficient.

Alternatively, the label is being used to prove that the company made the product, so the label is evidence of that fact. But in that case, the label's content (the company's name, etc.) would be relevant. So if the label's content is being used to prove that the company produced it, then the best evidence rule would require the original label. But the shopper is presenting the can with the label, so it's the original, not a copy, so it's admissible.

Wait, but the can is a physical object, so it's not a writing. The label on the can is a writing. So when she presents the can, she's presenting the label as part of it. So if she's trying to prove the contents of the label, like the company's name, then she would need the original. But if she's just trying to show that the company's label was on the can, then the can itself is evidence of that fact, which is non-content-based.

Alternatively, maybe the best evidence rule isn't the issue here. The real issue is whether the label is admissible to show that the company produced the can. The company's attorney is objecting to the label's introduction, perhaps arguing that it's not sufficient evidence.

But in product liability cases, the plaintiff typically needs to show that the product was defective when it left the manufacturer. Here, the mouse in the can would indicate a defect. The label is relevant to show that the company made the product, so it's necessary to establish that the company is the manufacturer.

Option G says the label is significant in strict liability cases. That makes sense because strict liability requires that the defendant was the manufacturer or seller in the business of selling such products.

So the label's presence on the can is crucial to link the product to the company. Therefore, the evidence should be admitted.

Looking back at the options, option B suggests that the label is the best evidence that the can was produced by the company. But perhaps the can itself, with the label, is the best evidence. However, the best evidence rule might not apply because we're not trying to prove the content of the label, just its existence on the can.

Alternatively, maybe the objection is on best evidence grounds, but the can is the original, so it's admissible.

Wait, but the attorney for the company objects to the label being introduced. So the issue is whether the label can be admitted. The label is part of the can, so it's physical evidence, not a document. So perhaps the best evidence rule doesn't apply here because it's a physical object, not a writing whose contents are being proven.

Wait, the best evidence rule applies to writings, recordings, etc. So if the label is a writing on a can, and the can is being presented as a physical object, then the label's content isn't at issue. The fact that the label exists on the can is what's important. So the best evidence rule wouldn't bar the can from being admitted because the content of the label isn't being proven through a copy.

Alternatively, if the shopper is trying to prove that the label says "Produced by X Company," then the original label (on the can) would be the best evidence. But since she has the can, that's the original, so it's admissible.

So in this case, the trial court should overrule the objection because the label is part of the can, which is physical evidence, and the shopper has the original, so no issue under the best evidence rule.

Looking at the options, option B says overrule because it's the best evidence that the can was produced by the company. Option G says it's significant in strict liability.

Alternatively, perhaps the label's admissibility is more about relevance. The label is relevant to show the company produced the can, which is necessary for strict liability.

So the court should overrule the objection. So looking at the options, the correct answer might be G or B.

Wait, but option B says the label is the best evidence. But the can itself is the evidence, and the label is part of it. So maybe the best evidence rule isn't the reason. Alternatively, option G says it's significant in strict liability, which is correct because it links the product to the company.

Another angle: the company's attorney might argue that the label isn't sufficient to prove that the company produced the can, perhaps suggesting that someone else could have put the label on. But the shopper has corroborating evidence, so that might not be an issue. Option J says the objection should be sustained because there's no corroborating evidence that the company placed the label. But the shopper presented other corroborating evidence, so J might not be correct.

Option A says it's direct evidence of responsibility. Direct evidence would be something like a witness seeing the company make it. The label is circumstantial evidence.

Option D says the label doesn't prove negligence, but in strict liability, negligence isn't the issue. So D is irrelevant.

Option E says it's the primary link. That's true, but the reasoning would be more about relevance than the best evidence.

Option F says the label is self-authenticating. But self-authenticating applies to certain documents under FRE 902, like certified copies, etc. A label on a can isn't self-authenticating, so F is incorrect.

So, back to the options. The label is being used to show the company produced the can, which is necessary for strict liability. Therefore, the label is relevant and admissible.

So the trial court should overrule the objection. The options that say overrule are A, B, E, F, G.

Option G states that the label is a significant piece of evidence in strict liability cases. That makes sense because it links the product to the defendant.

Alternatively, option B says it's the best evidence showing the can was produced by the company. If the label is the best evidence, then B would apply. But if the can is the best evidence, then B's reasoning might not be accurate.

Wait, the label is on the can, so the can is the physical evidence. But the label's content is what indicates the company's involvement. So perhaps the label's content is being used, and since the shopper has the original, it's admissible under the best evidence rule.

Alternatively, the can is a physical object, so it's not subject to the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule applies when trying to prove the content of a writing. Here, the label is a writing on the can, but the can is a physical object. So the best evidence rule might not apply because the can isn't a writing; the label is part of the can.

Wait, but the label is a writing, and the shopper is trying to prove that the label was on the can, which indicates the company produced it. So the content of the label (the company's name, etc.) is what's important. Therefore, the best evidence rule would require the original label. Since the shopper has the can with the label, it's the original, so B's reasoning that the label is the best evidence would apply.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The best evidence rule applies when a party is trying to prove the content of a writing. If the shopper is trying to prove that the can had the company's label, which says, for example, "Produced by X Company," then the content of the label is what's important. Therefore, the original label (on the can) would be the best evidence of that content.

So in that case, the shopper is properly presenting the original, so the objection based on best evidence would be overruled. So option B says overrule because it's the best evidence. But wait, the label is part of the can, which is a physical object, not a writing. Hmm, maybe I'm conflating the can and the label.

Alternatively, perhaps the label is considered a writing, so the content of the label (the company's name) is being proven, which would require the original. Since the shopper has the original, it's admissible. So the objection, if based on best evidence, would be overruled. But if the company's attorney is objecting on a different ground, like relevance, then that's another issue.

But the question says the attorney objected to the introduction of the label. It doesn't specify the ground, but the options suggest it's about best evidence or other rules.

So, considering all that, the best answer seems to be that the label is admissible because it's the best evidence showing the company produced the can, so option B. But wait, the can itself is the physical evidence, and the label is part of it. Alternatively, option G says it's significant in strict liability, which is also a strong point.

But I think the more precise answer relates to the best evidence rule. Since the shopper is presenting the original label on the can, the objection based on best evidence (if that's the basis) would be overruled. So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me consider another approach. In product liability cases, the plaintiff needs to prove that the product was defective and that the defect existed when it left the manufacturer. To do this, they need to show that the product was indeed made by the defendant. The label on the can is evidence of that. Therefore, it's relevant and admissible.

So the trial court should overrule the objection. The options that say overrule are A, B, E, F, G.

Looking at the reasoning again, option B is about the label being the best evidence. Option G is about it being significant in strict liability.

I think the key here is that the label is necessary to establish that the company produced the can, which is a prerequisite for strict liability. Therefore, the label is a significant piece of evidence in strict liability cases, making option G correct.

Alternatively, option B is about the label being the best evidence to show the company produced it. Since the label is the best evidence, the objection should be overruled. So option B would be correct.

Wait, but the can itself is the physical object, and the label is on it. So the can is the evidence, and the label is part of it. So the best evidence rule doesn't apply because the can isn't a writing. Therefore, the label's presence is proven by the can, so the best evidence rule isn't the issue. Thus, the objection shouldn't be sustained on best evidence grounds.

So the correct reasoning would be that the label is significant in strict liability, making option G correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. The best evidence rule applies when a party is trying to prove the content of a writing. If the shopper is trying to prove that the can had the company's label, which in turn shows the company produced it, then the label's content is what's important. So the label is a writing, and its content is at issue. Therefore, the original writing (the label on the can) must be presented. Since the shopper has the original, the objection based on best evidence would be overruled.

So option B would be correct: overrule because the label is the best evidence showing the can was produced by the company.

Alternatively, perhaps the label is not a writing for best evidence purposes, but a trade dress or something else. But no, the label is a writing with the company's name, so it's a writing.

So, I'm leaning towards option B being correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a label on a can of sardines as evidence in a strict liability case. The shopper found a decomposed mouse in the can and sued the company. At trial, the company objected to the introduction of the label. The key issue is whether the label is admissible and, if so, under what grounds.

Strict liability in product liability cases requires proof that the product was defective when it left the manufacturer, and the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was the manufacturer or seller of the product. The label on the can is crucial because it links the product to the company, making it relevant evidence.

The best evidence rule (Federal Rule of Evidence 1002) applies when the content of a writing is at issue. Here, the label is a writing, and its content (e.g., the company's name) is being used to prove that the company produced the can. Since the shopper presented the original label on the can, the best evidence rule does not bar its admission. The label is the best evidence to show that the can was produced by the company, as it directly links the product to the defendant.

Other options, such as the label being significant in strict liability cases (option G), are also valid points, but the most precise reasoning is that the label is the best evidence to establish the company's role in producing the can. Therefore, the trial court should overrule the objection.
