Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a Jamin refractometer. I remember that a Jamin refractometer uses interference to measure the refractive index of a substance. It has two tubes, each 30 cm long. One tube contains a gas at low pressure, and the other is under vacuum. When the gas is removed, there's a shift of 10 fringes of red light, and the wavelength in a vacuum is given as 6000 Angstroms. The task is to find the refractive index of the gas.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling how a Jamin refractometer works. From what I remember, the Jamin refractometer splits light into two beams: one passes through the sample (gas) and the other through a vacuum (or another reference medium). The two beams then interfere, creating fringes. When the sample is removed, the path length changes, causing a shift in the interference pattern.

The formula I think is relevant here involves the change in the number of fringes and relates it to the refractive index of the gas. Oh right, the formula for the shift in fringes (ΔN) is connected to the refractive index (n) and the path length (L) through the medium. The wavelength (λ) in vacuum is also a factor here.

Wait, the formula I remember is something like ΔN = (2L / λ) * (n - 1). Because when the gas is removed, n becomes 1 (since vacuum has n=1), so the change in the phase or the number of fringes would be proportional to (n-1). 

So let's plug in the numbers. ΔN is 10 fringes. The length L is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters. The wavelength λ is 6000 Angstroms. Oh wait, I need to convert that into meters. 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 6000 Angstroms is 6000e-10 m, which is 6e-7 meters.

So putting it all into the formula:

10 = (2 * 0.3 m) / (6e-7 m) ) * (n - 1)

Wait, wait. Let me write that out clearly:

ΔN = (2L (n -1 )) / λ

So solving for (n-1):

n -1 = (ΔN * λ) / (2L)

Plugging in the numbers:

n-1 = (10 * 6e-7 m) / (2 * 0.3 m)

Let's calculate the denominator first: 2 * 0.3 = 0.6.

So numerator: 10 *6e-7 = 6e-6.

So n-1 = (6e-6) / 0.6 = (6e-6)/(6e-1) )? Wait, no, 0.6 is 6e-1? Wait, 0.6 is 6*10^-1. Oh wait, no: 6e-6 divided by 0.6.

Wait, 6e-6 is 6 * 1e-6, and 0.6 is 6 * 1e-1. So dividing them gives (6/6) * (1e-6 / 1e-1) ) = 1 * 1e-5 = 1e-5.

So n-1 = 1e-5. Therefore, n = 1 + 1e-5 = 1.00001.

Wait, the options are given as A through J. Looking back, option C is 1.00001. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula because sometimes I get confused between different formulas. Let me think: the optical path difference (OPD) is (n-1)L, since in the sample, the light travels a physical path L but the optical path is nL. The reference path is L in vacuum (n=1), so OPD is (nL - L) ) = L(n-1).

But the number of fringes shifted is given by the OPD divided by wavelength. Since each fringe corresponds to a wavelength shift (half a wavelength for phase, but fringe shift corresponds to full wavelength in OPD, I think).

So the formula would be ΔN = (2L(n-1)) / λ. Because in Jamin, the light goes through the sample twice (once each way, because it's a refractometer with two passes). Or wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, in a Jamin refractometer, the light passes through each tube twice, once on the way into the refractor and once on the way out, right? So the total path length through the sample is 2L, not L. So the OPD would be (n-1)*2L.

So the formula for the fringe shift would be ΔN = (2L (n-1)) / λ.

Yes, that's correct. So that's why the formula I used before is right.

So plugging the numbers again:

ΔN = 10
λ = 6000 Å = 6000e-10 m = 6e-7 m
L = 0.3 m
So,

10 = [2 * 0.3 * (n-1)] / (6e-7)

Wait, solving for (n-1):

(n-1) = (10 * 6e-7) / (2 * 0.3 )

Calculating numerator: 10 *6e-7 =6e-6.

Denominator: 2 *0.3=0.6.

So (n-1)=6e-6 / 0.6 = 1e-5.

So n = 1.00001, which is option C.

Wait, but what if I forgot the factor of 2? Then I'd have n-1=6e-6/(0.3) = 2e-5, which would make n=1.00002, which is option A. But I think the factor of 2 is correct because the light passes through twice. So I'm confident the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves a Jamin refractometer, which measures the refractive index of a gas by observing the shift in interference fringes when the gas is replaced by a vacuum. The refractometer has two tubes, each 30 cm long. One tube initially contains the gas, and the other is under vacuum. When the gas is removed, a fringe shift of 10 fringes is observed for red light with a wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{vac}} = 6000 \, \text{Å} = 6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

The formula relating the fringe shift (\( \Delta N \)) to the refractive index (\( n \)) is:

\[
\Delta N = \frac{2L(n-1)}{\lambda}
\]

Here:
- \( \Delta N = 10 \),
- \( L = 0.3 \, \text{m} \),
- \( \lambda = 6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( n-1 \):

\[
n-1 = \frac{\Delta N \cdot \lambda}{2L}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
n-1 = \frac{10 \cdot 6 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \cdot 0.3}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
10 \cdot 6 \times 10^{-7} = 6 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.6
\]

Now divide:

\[
n-1 = \frac{6 \times 10^{-6}}{0.6} = 1 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Thus:

\[
n = 1 + 1 \times 10^{-5} = 1.00001
\]

From the given options, the refractive index of the gas is \( 1.00001 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
