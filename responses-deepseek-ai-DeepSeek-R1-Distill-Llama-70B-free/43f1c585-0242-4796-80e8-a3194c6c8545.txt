Question:

A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim's estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim's estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim's estate then asked the witness the following question, "Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim's broken nose?" The witness replied, "Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, And that's only the beginning. "Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because it reports the defendant's adoptive admission of the victim's assertion.
B: inadmissible, because it is a character evidence.
C: admissible, because it is considered a prior bad act.
D: inadmissible, because it violates the defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him.
E: inadmissible, because it is a prejudicial evidence.
F: inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.
G: admissible, because it is a statement made by a party opponent.
H: admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.
I: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible, because it constitutes an excited utterance.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about admissibility in a civil trial, specifically a wrongful death case. Let me try to break it down.

So the scenario is that a victim and defendant were both longshoremen. The defendant was acquitted of murder after the victim was shot. Now, the victim's estate is suing him in a civil case. During the trial, the estate called a witness who worked with both. This witness testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said the defendant caused it. Then the estate's attorney asked if the defendant was present during their conversation and what he said. The witness replied that the defendant was there and, after the victim accused him, the defendant said, "And that's only the beginning."

Now, the defendant's attorney objected. The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

Looking at the options, the main issue here is about hearsay and possible exceptions. The statement made by the defendant is being offered against him, so I need to see if it fits any hearsay exceptions or if it's non-hearsay.

Wait, the defendant's statement was made in response to the victim's accusation. So when the victim told the witness that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant was present and said, "And that's only the beginning." That sounds like the defendant is adopting the statement or perhaps making a statement that implies a threat.

I remember that in evidence law, an adoptive admission is when a party's silence or action implies agreement with a statement made by someone else. But in this case, the defendant didn't remain silent; he responded. So maybe it's not an adoptive admission but rather a statement by a party opponent.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), statements made by a party-opponent are admissible as non-hearsay. Specifically, FRE 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or the party himself.

Here, the defendant made the statement, so it's a statement by a party-opponent. Therefore, it doesn't fall under hearsay. So the testimony about what the defendant said should be admissible.

Wait, but let me think again. The defendant's statement was in response to an accusation. So it's a statement made by the defendant himself, so it's an admission of a party-opponent. That makes it admissible under 801(d)(2)(A) because it's a statement offered against the party (defendant) and made by the party. So it's not hearsay at all.

Alternatively, if the defendant's statement was in response to the victim's assertion, it could be seen as an admission. But since the defendant is the one making the statement, it's his own admission, so it's admissible.

So looking at the options, option G says it's admissible as a statement by a party opponent. Option A says it's an adoptive admission. But wait, adoptive admissions are when the party adopts someone else's statement, like nodding or not objecting. Here, the defendant made his own statement, so it's not adoptive. Therefore, option G is better because it's the defendant's own statement, so it's a party admission.

Wait, but some might confuse this with an adoptive admission. Let me think about that. Adoptive admission would require that the defendant heard the statement and, through words or conduct, indicated agreement. But here, the defendant didn't adopt the victim's statement; he made a new statement. So the original statement by the victim is hearsay if offered for the truth, but the defendant's response is a separate statement.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the entire testimony. The witness's testimony includes both the victim's statement and the defendant's response. The victim's statement is "the defendant broke my nose," which is hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. But the defendant's response is non-hearsay because it's his own statement.

So the problem is that the victim's statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. The defendant's statement is admissible. So the part about the victim's broken nose is hearsay, but the defendant's response is not.

But the question is about the entire testimony. So the estate's attorney asked a compound question: whether the defendant was present and what he said. The witness answered both parts.

So the victim's statement is hearsay. Unless it's covered by an exception, it's inadmissible. The defendant's statement is admissible. So part of the testimony is admissible, part is not.

Wait, but the victim's statement is being offered to show that the defendant broke his nose, which is a prior bad act. But in a civil case, prior bad acts can be admissible if they are relevant and not barred by other rules. However, the prior statement by the victim would still be hearsay.

Alternatively, the victim's statement might be admissible as a statement against interest under FRE 804(b)(3), but the victim is deceased, so if the statement was against the victim's interest at the time, it could qualify. But wait, the victim saying the defendant broke his nose doesn't seem to be against his interest. It's more of an accusation against someone else, so it wouldn't be a statement against interest. So that exception doesn't apply.

Therefore, the victim's statement is hearsay and inadmissible unless another exception applies. The defendant's statement is admissible as a party admission.

But the way the question is phrased, the entire testimony is being objected to. So the part about the victim's statement is inadmissible hearsay, and the part about the defendant's statement is admissible. But the question is about whether the testimony is admissible—so perhaps the court would admit the defendant's statement but exclude the victim's prior statement.

Wait, but in the question, the witness's testimony includes both parts. So the entire testimony is objected to. If part is admissible and part isn't, the court might have to decide whether the admissible part justifies allowing the testimony, or if the objection is sustained as to the hearsay part.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the defendant's statement. Because the question is about the admissibility of the entire response. So perhaps the key is that the defendant's statement is admissible, so the entire testimony is admissible.

Wait, but the way the question is structured, the witness's testimony includes two statements: the victim's and the defendant's. So the objection is to the entire testimony. If any part is inadmissible hearsay, the whole could be excluded unless the admissible part can be separated.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the fact that the defendant's statement is a party admission, making it non-hearsay, so the testimony is admissible as to the defendant's statement. But the victim's statement is hearsay, perhaps inadmissible. But the question is about the admissibility of the witness's testimony. So perhaps the answer is that the defendant's part is admissible, so the testimony is admissible overall.

Wait, but the question is whether the testimony is admissible. So if any part is inadmissible, but the other part is, perhaps the court would allow the defendant's statement but exclude the victim's. But the way the question is presented, the testimony includes both, so maybe the answer is that it's admissible because the defendant's statement is a party admission.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire testimony is inadmissible because the victim's statement is hearsay, and the defendant's statement is being used for the truth of the matter, but the defendant's statement could be admissible as a threat.

Wait, but the defendant's statement, "And that's only the beginning," could be a threat, which is relevant to show the defendant's intent or pattern of behavior towards the victim, making it relevant in a wrongful death case.

But in terms of hearsay, the defendant's statement is not hearsay because it's his own statement. So the part about the defendant's statement is admissible. The part about the victim's statement is hearsay and inadmissible unless an exception applies.

So, the entire testimony includes both. The question is whether the testimony is admissible. If the court can separate the admissible parts, perhaps it's allowed, but if not, maybe it's excluded.

But in reality, the defendant's statement is the key part. The witness's testimony about the defendant's presence and statement is being offered to show that the defendant made a threatening statement, which is relevant to the wrongful death claim as it shows a pattern of behavior leading up to the shooting.

So in that case, the defendant's statement is admissible, making the testimony admissible. The victim's prior statement is hearsay but perhaps it's just background and the focus is on the defendant's statement.

Looking at the options again:

Option G says it's admissible as a statement by a party opponent. That fits because the defendant's statement is his own and is a party admission.

Option A says it's an adoptive admission. But adoptive admission requires the defendant to adopt the prior statement. Here, the defendant made his own statement after the victim's assertion. So it's not adoptive; it's a direct statement by the party.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but let me think about whether the defendant's statement is hearsay. Since it's the defendant's own statement, it's not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible because the defendant's statement is a party admission.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The admissibility of the witness's testimony hinges on the distinction between hearsay and non-hearsay evidence. The testimony includes two parts: (1) the victim's statement that the defendant broke his nose and (2) the defendant's response, "And that's only the beginning." 

1. **Victim's Statement**: The victim's statement is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the defendant broke his nose). This is hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) and does not fall under any recognized exception, such as a statement against interest or an excited utterance. Therefore, the victim's statement is inadmissible.

2. **Defendant's Statement**: The defendant's response, "And that's only the beginning," is not hearsay because it is a statement made by the defendant himself. Under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and was made by that party. The defendant's statement qualifies as a party admission and is therefore admissible.

The question asks about the admissibility of the entire testimony. While the victim's statement is inadmissible as hearsay, the defendant's statement is admissible as a party admission. The key focus is on the defendant's statement, which is relevant to show his intent or pattern of behavior toward the victim. Since the defendant's statement is admissible and the victim's statement is collateral, the testimony as a whole is admissible.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not admissible as an adoptive admission because the defendant did not adopt the victim's statement; he made his own statement.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The testimony is not inadmissible as character evidence; it is relevant to show the defendant's intent or pattern of behavior.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The testimony is not admissible as a prior bad act; it is admissible because the defendant's statement is a party admission.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The testimony does not violate the defendant's right to confront witnesses.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The testimony is not inadmissible as prejudicial evidence; it is relevant and probative.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The principle of collateral estoppel does not apply here.
- **Option G**: Correct. The testimony is admissible because the defendant's statement is a statement by a party opponent.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The testimony is not admissible as a declaration against interest.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The defendant's statement is not hearsay.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The testimony is not admissible as an excited utterance.

The correct answer is **G** because the defendant's statement is admissible as a statement by a party opponent. 

Answer: G
