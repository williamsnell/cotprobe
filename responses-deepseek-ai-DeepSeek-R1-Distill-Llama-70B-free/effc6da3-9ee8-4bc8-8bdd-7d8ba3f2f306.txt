Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question, therefore, should be quickly settled, whether free colored persons, born and naturalized in this country, are not American citizens, and justly entitled to all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states; and whether the Constitution of the United States makes or authorizes any invidious distinction with regard to the color or condition of free inhabitants.
"For myself, I have not the shadow of doubt on the subject. I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry . . . can prevent their acknowledgement . . . and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice."
â€”William Lloyd Garrison, "To the Free People of Color of the United States," The Liberator, January 15, 1831

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this question about William Lloyd Garrison and The Liberator. Okay, let's start by breaking down the information given.

The quote is from an article Garrison wrote in 1831. He's addressing free colored people in the US. He's arguing that they are indeed American citizens and entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizens. He's saying that the Constitution doesn't allow for distinctions based on color or condition for free people. He believes that if their rights are taken to the Supreme Court, they'll be recognized, and that the current laws affecting them are unconstitutional. He also mentions that just because they've been treated as aliens or brutes doesn't make it legal, which shows how strong prejudice is.

Now, the question is about the approach of Garrison and The Liberator. The options are from A to J, each representing different movements or ideas.

I remember that William Lloyd Garrison was a prominent abolitionist. He founded The Liberator, which was a newspaper dedicated to abolishing slavery. So his approach was definitely part of the Abolitionist movement.

Looking at the options, option G says it's a manifestation of the principles of the Abolitionist movement. That seems to fit because he's advocating for the rights of African Americans and pushing against slavery and discrimination.

But wait, are there other options that could fit? Let me think. Option H mentions the American Revolution. While the Revolution's ideals about liberty and equality might have influenced him, his approach was more specifically about abolition. So H might be related but not the best fit.

Option B is Enlightenment thinking. Enlightenment ideas about natural rights and equality could be a foundation, but again, the specific approach here is tied to abolition, not just Enlightenment principles.

Option F is the Second Great Awakening. That was a religious revival that did inspire some reform movements, including abolition. But Garrison's approach was more direct and radical, so maybe that's part of it, but the question is about the best fit.

Option G seems to be the most direct answer because it's specifically about the Abolitionist movement. So I think the answer is G.
