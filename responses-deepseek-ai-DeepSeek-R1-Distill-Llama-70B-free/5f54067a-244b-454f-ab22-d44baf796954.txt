Okay, I'm trying to figure out this group theory question. Let's see. So, the question has two statements about groups of order 42. I need to determine if each statement is true or false.

First, I'll break down the order of the group. 42 factors into prime factors as 2 * 3 * 7. So we're dealing with a group of order 42, which is the product of three distinct primes.

Statement 1 says every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. Statement 2 says every group has a normal subgroup of order 8. Wait, but 8 is 2^3, and 42 is 2*3*7, so 8 doesn't divide 42? Because 42 divided by 8 is 5.25, which isn't an integer. So if a group has order 42, it can't have a subgroup of order 8 because Lagrange's theorem says that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. So Statement 2 is definitely false. That's easy.

Now, Statement 1: normal subgroup of order 7. I remember something about Sylow theorems. Sylow p-subgroups... For a group G of order p^k * m, where p is prime, certain conditions apply. Let me think. The Sylow theorems say that the number of Sylow p-subgroups, n_p, must satisfy n_p ≡ 1 mod p and n_p divides the order of the group divided by p^k.

For order 42, and looking for Sylow 7-subgroups. The order would be 7, and 42 /7 =6. So n_7 must divide 6 and n_7 ≡1 mod7. The possible divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. Which of these are congruent to 1 mod7? Well, 1 mod7 is 1, 8 would be next, but 8 isn't a divisor. So only possible n_7 is 1. That means there's exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal because all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and if there's only one, it's normal.

So Statement 1 is true because every group of order 42 has a unique (hence normal) Sylow 7-subgroup of order 7.

So Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Looking at the options: Option I says True, False. That should be the right answer.

Statement 1: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.  
To analyze this, we use Sylow's theorems. A group of order 42 has Sylow 7-subgroups of order 7. The number of such subgroups, \( n_7 \), must satisfy \( n_7 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \) and \( n_7 \) divides \( 42 / 7 = 6 \). The only divisor of 6 that satisfies \( n_7 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \) is \( n_7 = 1 \). This means there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal. Therefore, **Statement 1 is true**.

Statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.  
The order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group by Lagrange's theorem. Since 8 does not divide 42 (as \( 42 / 8 = 5.25 \)), no subgroup of order 8 can exist in a group of order 42. Therefore, **Statement 2 is false**.

From the analysis, **Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false**. The correct option is:

I: True, False
