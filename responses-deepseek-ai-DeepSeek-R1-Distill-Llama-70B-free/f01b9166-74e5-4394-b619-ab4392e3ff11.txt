Question:

Nitrous acid, HNO2, has a pKa value of 3.3. If a solution of nitrous acid is found to have a pH of 4.2, what can be said about the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair found in solution?

Options:

A: [HNO2] > [NO2-]
B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2-]
C: [NO2-] < [H2NO2+]
D: [H2NO2+] > [NO2-]
E: [NO2-] > [HNO2]
F: [NO2-] = [HNO2]
G: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2]
H: [HNO2] = [H2NO2+]
I: [HNO2] > [H2NO2+]

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about nitrous acid and its pKa. Hmm, I remember that pKa is the pH where the acid is 50% dissociated. Right, so the pKa tells us the strength of the acid. The lower the pKa, the stronger the acid. But wait, nitrous acid's pKa is given as 3.3 here.

The question says the solution has a pH of 4.2. Wait, pH is higher than pKa. Oh, right, when pH is greater than pKa, the acid is less protonated, so the conjugate base is more prevalent. Because, in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

So, if pH is higher than pKa (4.2 > 3.3), the log term must be positive. Which means [A-] is greater than [HA], right? Because log of something greater than 1 is positive.

So in this case, the acid is HNO2, and the conjugate base is NO2-. So the concentration of NO2- should be higher than HNO2. Wait, but wait! Some textbooks might represent the acid as H2NO2+, but I think in the case of nitrous acid, it's HNO2 that's the acid. Let me think: HNO2 dissociates into H+ and NO2-.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So, when pH > pKa, [base] > [acid]. So [NO2^-] > [HNO2].

Looking at the options, option E says [NO2^-] > [HNO2]. So E would be correct. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A to I. Let's go through them.

Option A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-] → No, because pH > pKa means base is more.

Option B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-] → Wait, H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid, right? Or is it? Wait, nitrous acid is HNO2, which can act as a weak acid. So when it donates a proton, it becomes NO2^-. But sometimes, when dealing with diprotic acids, the first proton is H2A+... Wait, nitrous acid is a monoprotic acid, I think. So the conjugate acid would be H2NO2^+? Or wait, actually, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, HNO2 is a weak acid, so it donates a proton to become NO2^-. So the conjugate base is NO2^-. So the conjugate acid would be H2NO2^+? Or is that another species? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, let me clarify. The acid is HNO2, which can donate a proton to form NO2^- and H+. So the conjugate acid of HNO2 would be H2NO2^+? Or is that the case only for diprotic acids? Wait, no. HNO2 is monoprotic, so it only donates one proton. So the conjugate acid isn't formed in this case, or perhaps I'm mixing this up.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the concentrations of the conjugate acid/base pair. So the conjugate acid would be H2NO2^+? Or wait, no, the acid is HNO2, so its conjugate base is NO2^-. So the pair is HNO2 (acid) and NO2^- (base). So the ratio is [NO2^-]/[HNO2]. So when pH is higher than pKa, the base is more concentrated.

So looking back at the options, option E is [NO2^-] > [HNO2], which is correct. So the answer should be E.

Wait, let me check the other options just to be sure. Option B says [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-]. If H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid, then in a solution where pH is higher than pKa, the base (NO2^-) is more prevalent. So the conjugate acid (like H2NO2+) would be less than the base. But wait, H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid of HNO2. But in a solution of HNO2, the conjugate acid is not present; the main species are HNO2 and NO2^-.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the conjugate acid. Let me think again. The acid is HNO2; when it donates a proton, it becomes NO2^-. So the conjugate base is NO2^-, and the conjugate acid would be what? Actually, HNO2 is the acid, so the conjugate base is NO2^-. There's no conjugate acid from HNO2 in this context. Unless we're considering the reverse reaction, where NO2^- could act as a base, but that's probably beyond what's needed here.

So the main point is that when pH is higher than pKa, the base form is more concentrated. So [NO2^-] > [HNO2], which is option E.

So I think the correct answer is E.

To determine the relationship between the concentrations of the conjugate acid/base pair in a solution of nitrous acid (HNO₂) with a pH of 4.2, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]

Here, the acid is HNO₂, and its conjugate base is NO₂⁻. The pKa of HNO₂ is 3.3, and the solution pH is 4.2. Since the pH is greater than the pKa, the logarithmic term \(\log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)\) is positive. This means that the concentration of the base (NO₂⁻) is greater than the concentration of the acid (HNO₂).

Analyzing the options:

- **A:** [HNO₂] > [NO₂⁻] → Incorrect, as the base is more concentrated when pH > pKa.
- **B:** [H₂NO₂⁺] < [NO₂⁻] → Irrelevant, as H₂NO₂⁺ is not the conjugate acid in this context.
- **C:** [NO₂⁻] < [H₂NO₂⁺] → Incorrect, as the base (NO₂⁻) is more concentrated.
- **D:** [H₂NO₂⁺] > [NO₂⁻] → Incorrect for the same reason as above.
- **E:** [NO₂⁻] > [HNO₂] → Correct, as the base is more concentrated when pH > pKa.
- **F:** [NO₂⁻] = [HNO₂] → Incorrect, as this would only occur when pH = pKa.
- **G:** [H₂NO₂⁺] > [HNO₂] → Irrelevant, as H₂NO₂⁺ is not the conjugate acid.
- **H:** [HNO₂] = [H₂NO₂⁺] → Incorrect for the same reason as above.
- **I:** [HNO₂] > [H₂NO₂⁺] → Irrelevant, as H₂NO₂⁺ is not the conjugate acid.

The correct answer is **E**, as [NO₂⁻] > [HNO₂] when pH > pKa.
