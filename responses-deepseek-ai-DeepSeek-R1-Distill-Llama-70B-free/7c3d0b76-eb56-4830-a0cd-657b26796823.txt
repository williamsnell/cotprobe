Question:

After graduating from law school, a graduate moved to a city where she had been offered a position in an entertainment law firm. When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.
B: Yes, because the graduate was unfairly arrested and held in custody overnight.
C: No, because the company was within its rights to file a complaint when it noticed the graduate had attended without paying.
D: No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.
E: Yes, because the graduate ended up losing her job due to the emotional distress caused by the situation.
F: No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.
G: Yes, because the company did not attempt to contact the graduate before filing a complaint.
H: No, because the graduate did initially attend the course without paying the enrollment fee.
I: Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.
J: No, because the graduate should have pre-enrolled for the course to ensure her spot.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about a graduate who's trying to take the bar exam. She moves to a new city, gets a job contingent on passing the bar, and signs up for a bar review course. But she runs into some trouble. Let me try to break this down.

First, the facts: She arrives late on the first day of the course. Registration is already done, so she takes the materials and goes in without paying. She intended to pay but couldn't because no one was at the registration desk. Later, she sends a cashier's check for the full fee. The company gets the check, cashes it, but doesn't tell the prosecutor. The company had already filed a complaint against her for larceny by trick, leading to her arrest and some emotional distress that messed up her life.

Now the question is whether she can sue the company for intentional infliction of emotional distress. I'm a bit fuzzy on the elements of IIED, but I remember it's a tough claim. The elements are: (1) defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the conduct caused the emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe.

So, looking at the options. The company filed a complaint without knowing she paid, but she did pay later. But the company didn't inform the prosecutor even after they got the check. That seems a bit shady. Did the company act in a way that's extreme and outrageous?

Wait, larceny by trick is when you obtain something by deception with the intent to deprive permanently. Here, she took the materials and attended without paying, but she intended to pay. So maybe the company thought she was trying to defraud them. But she did send the payment, so perhaps the initial action wasn't fraudulent. But the company went ahead and pressed charges anyway, even after receiving payment.

In terms of IIED, the company's conduct has to be more than just wrongfulâ€”it needs to be outrageous. Like, beyond the bounds of decency. So filing a complaint without knowing she paid might be a mistake, but is it outrageous? Alternatively, continuing the prosecution even after knowing she paid could be worse, but in this case, the check arrived after the complaint was filed, and the company didn't inform the prosecutor. So when the complaint was filed, the company didn't know she had paid. But after she sent the check, they cashed it but didn't update the prosecutor, leading to her arrest.

So was the company's action outrageous? Maybe not when they first filed the complaint because they didn't know she had paid. But after the payment, they should have withdrawn the complaint. Not doing so could be seen as reckless or intentional, causing her further distress.

But wait, in the scenario, the company filed the complaint before receiving the check. So at that point, they might have had a reasonable belief she was trying to steal the service. But after receiving the payment, failing to notify the prosecutor could be seen as reckless disregard for her situation.

So looking at the options:

Option A: She didn't intend to defraud. That might be a defense against the larceny charge, but does it matter for IIED? Maybe not directly, but it could show the company's conduct was unwarranted.

Option B: She was unfairly arrested. Unfairness alone doesn't make it IIED; it needs to be outrageous.

Option C: Company was within rights to file. Initially, yes, because she didn't pay. But after she paid, not withdrawing the complaint might be the issue.

Option D: Filing the complaint wasn't outrageous. If the company had a reasonable basis at the time, maybe it's not outrageous. But after payment, it could become outrageous.

Option E: Job loss due to distress. Causation is there, but the conduct must be outrageous.

Option F: No intent to cause distress. Maybe, but IIED can be intentional or reckless.

Option G: No attempt to contact before filing. Could that be part of the outrageousness? Maybe, but if they had a reasonable belief, maybe not.

Option H: She attended without paying. That's the initial issue, but she did pay later.

Option I: Company didn't inform prosecutor after payment. That seems like it could be outrageous because they continued the prosecution despite being paid.

Option J: She should have pre-enrolled. Not relevant to IIED.

So which options are about the company's conduct after payment. Option I says the company didn't inform the prosecutor after receiving payment. That seems like a key point. If they knew she paid but didn't stop the prosecution, that could be outrageous.

But wait, in the timeline: The graduate sent the check after attending a couple of classes. The company received it but didn't inform the prosecutor. The graduate was arrested after that. So the company knew she paid, but let the prosecution proceed.

So their conduct after knowing she paid could be seen as outrageous. Because they had no basis to continue the complaint once payment was made. That might meet the outrageousness requirement.

So looking at the options, I think option I is pointing this out. Option I says yes because the company didn't inform the prosecutor that the fee was paid in full. That would make their conduct outrageous because they allowed the arrest to happen even after being paid.

Option D says the complaint filing wasn't outrageous. But if they continued after payment, that's where the outrage is.

So the correct answer would be I: Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the fee was paid.

Wait, but the question is, when the company filed the complaint, they didn't know she had paid yet. So when they filed, their conduct wasn't outrageous because they thought she was committing larceny. But after they received the payment, they should have withdrawn the complaint. Not doing so might be reckless or intentional, which could be outrageous.

So the issue is whether the company's failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment constitutes outrageous conduct. If that's the case, then option I would apply.

Alternatively, some might argue that the initial filing was not outrageous, but the subsequent failure to act is. Since IIED requires outrageous conduct, if the company's actions after payment were reckless, that could meet the standard.

So I'm leaning towards option I being the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the graduate can prevail on a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against the bar-review company. To establish IIED, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's conduct was intentional or reckless, extreme and outrageous, causally connected to the emotional distress, and resulted in severe distress.

The graduate attended the bar-review course without paying initially but later sent a cashier's check for the full enrollment fee, which the company deposited. However, the company failed to inform the prosecutor about the payment, leading to the graduate's arrest and severe emotional distress. The key issue is whether the company's conduct was extreme and outrageous.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **Option A:** While the graduate did not intend to defraud the company, this goes to her defense against the larceny charge, not directly to whether the company's conduct was outrageous for IIED.

- **Option B:** The unfairness of the arrest alone does not establish outrageousness, which is a higher standard.

- **Option C:** The company may have been within its rights to file the initial complaint, as it did not know about the payment at the time. However, its failure to withdraw the complaint after receiving payment could be seen as outrageous.

- **Option D:** Filing the complaint before knowing about the payment was not outrageous, but the company's subsequent failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment could rise to the level of outrageousness.

- **Option E:** While the graduate suffered severe distress and job loss, the claim hinges on whether the company's conduct was outrageous, not just the consequences.

- **Option F:** The company's lack of intent to cause distress is irrelevant because IIED can also be based on reckless disregard for the plaintiff's well-being.

- **Option G:** The company's failure to contact the graduate before filing the complaint is not necessarily outrageous, as it may have had a reasonable belief in her intent to defraud at the time.

- **Option H:** The graduate's initial failure to pay does not negate the company's potential liability for outrageous conduct after it received payment.

- **Option I:** The company's failure to inform the prosecutor about the payment after it was received could be considered outrageous, as it allowed the prosecution to continue without justification.

- **Option J:** The graduate's failure to pre-enroll is irrelevant to the IIED claim.

The most compelling argument is that the company's failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment was outrageous, as it recklessly allowed the graduate's arrest and resulting distress to occur. This aligns with **Option I**.

**Answer: I**
