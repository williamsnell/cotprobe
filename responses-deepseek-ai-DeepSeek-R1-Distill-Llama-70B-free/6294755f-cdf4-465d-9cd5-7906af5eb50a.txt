Okay, so I've got this problem here about sulfuric acid density and volume. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these calculations, but I think I can figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the density of concentrated sulfuric acid is given as 1.85 g/ml. The question is asking what volume of the acid would weigh 74.0 grams. Oh right, density is mass over volume, right? So the formula is density = mass/volume. I remember that much.

Wait, so if I rearrange that formula, I can solve for volume. Oh yeah, volume would be mass divided by density. That makes sense. So in this case, the mass is 74.0 grams and the density is 1.85 g/ml.

Let me write that down. Volume equals mass divided by density. So Volume = 74.0 g / 1.85 g/ml. I need to compute that. Let me do the division.

Hmm, 74 divided by 1.85. Let me think. 1.85 times 40 is 74, because 1.85 * 40 = 74. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait 1.85 times 40 would be 74, so 74 divided by 1.85 is 40. So the volume would be 40 ml?

But wait, let me double-check that math. I don't want to make a mistake. So 1.85 multiplied by 40: 1.85 times 40. Let me calculate that. 1.85 * 40 = (1 *40) + (0.85*40) = 40 + 34 = 74. Oh yeah, that's right. So 74 divided by 1.85 is indeed 40.

So the volume is 40 ml. Looking at the options, option J is 40.0 ml. So the answer must be J.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up anything else. Did I use the right formula? Density is mass/volume, so volume is mass/density. Yep, that's correct. The units make sense too: grams divided by grams per ml gives ml. So that's right.

I don't see any mistakes here. So yeah, the correct answer should be J.

To determine the volume of concentrated sulfuric acid that weighs 74.0 g, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}}
\]

Given:
- Mass = 74.0 g
- Density = 1.85 g/ml

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{74.0 \, \text{g}}{1.85 \, \text{g/ml}} = 40.0 \, \text{ml}
\]

Thus, the volume of the acid is 40.0 ml. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 40.0 ml**

Answer: J
