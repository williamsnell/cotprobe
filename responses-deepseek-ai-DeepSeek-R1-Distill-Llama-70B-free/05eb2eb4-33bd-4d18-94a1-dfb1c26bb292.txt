The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:

Options:

A: would remain preserved in the memories of the remaining species.
B: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.
C: would evolve into a different form or essence.
D: would be destroyed only if the species was eliminated by unnatural causes.
E: would be absorbed by another species.
F: would transform into the essence of another existing species.
G: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.
H: would exist as long as there are traces or remnants of the species left in the world.
I: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.
J: would likewise be destroyed.

Okay, so I've got this question about Aristotle's philosophy, specifically about his view on essence and forms. Hmm, I remember that Aristotle had a different take on forms compared to Plato. Let me think.

In Plato's theory, I think Forms are these abstract, perfect entities that exist independently of the physical world. So, like, the Form of a chair exists in a higher realm, and all chairs we see are just imitations of that Form. But Aristotle didn't agree with that, right? He believed that forms aren't separate from the physical objects themselves.

The question is asking about what happens to the essence or form of a species if all members are destroyed. According to Aristotle, the essence is tied to the individuals. So if all individuals of a species are gone, their essence would be destroyed too. Because in Aristotle's view, the form doesn't exist independently; it's inherent in the existing individuals.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the essence continues existing in another realm, which sounds like Plato's view, so that's not it. Option J says the essence would likewise be destroyed. That makes sense because if all individuals are gone, their form can't exist anymore.

Other options talk about memories, evolving, or being absorbed, but I don't think Aristotle's view supports that. His forms are immanent, not transcendent, so they can't exist without the individuals.

Aristotle's view is that the essence or form of a species is inherent in the individuals and does not exist independently. Therefore, if all members of a species are destroyed, their essence would also be destroyed. This aligns with option J.

Answer: J
