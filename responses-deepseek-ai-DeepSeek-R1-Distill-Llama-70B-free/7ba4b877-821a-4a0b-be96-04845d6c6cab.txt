Okay, so I have this question about collective security and I need to figure out the right answer. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll start by breaking down the question and the options.

The question is asking for the meaning of collective security. From what I remember, collective security is a concept where multiple nations come together to provide security for each other. It's like a mutual defense agreement, so if one member is attacked, the others come to their aid. That sounds familiar, maybe like NATO or the League of Nations?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The establishment of a mutual defense pact among several nations. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. NATO is a mutual defense pact, so this could be the right answer.

Option B: The right of a nation to defend itself without outside intervention. Wait, that's more about self-defense, like what's in Article 51 of the UN Charter. It's individual, not collective.

Option C: The authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council. Oh, that's more about peacekeeping missions or interventions. The UNSC can authorize force under Chapter VII, but that's not exactly collective security. It's more about enforcement.

Option D: Authorization of humanitarian missions by the UN Security Council. Similar to C, this is specific to humanitarian interventions, not the broader concept of collective security.

Option E: The right of one's allies to defend the victim State. This seems close, but it's more specific to alliances rather than a broader collective system. Plus, the question is about the general concept.

Option F: Authorization of sanctions by the UN Security Council. Sanctions are a tool used by the UN, but they're a form of economic enforcement, not the same as collective security which is about mutual defense.

Option G: The right to self-defense by more than one nation acting in concert. Hmm, this is interesting. Collective self-defense is when multiple nations act together in self-defense, like in the case of an attack on one of them. So this could also be a correct definition.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. Collective security is when a group of states agree to defend each other against any aggressor. It's more than just mutual defense; it's a system where an attack on one is considered an attack on all, leading to a collective response.

Option A says mutual defense pact. That sounds correct because it's an agreement among nations to defend each other. But Option G is about the right to self-defense collectively. So which is it?

I think the key here is the definition. Collective security is the idea that a group of nations collectively provide security for each member. So it's more than just mutual defense; it's a system where all members contribute to the security of all. For example, the United Nations system is based on collective security, where the Security Council can authorize actions to maintain peace.

Wait, but the options don't all mention the UN. The question is about the general term, not specifically the UN. So going back, mutual defense pacts are a form of collective security. So Option A could be correct.

Alternatively, Option G talks about the right to self-defense by more than one nation acting together. That's more about when a group of nations exercise their right to self-defense together. But collective security is broader; it's a system where the collective stands together against any aggression, not just self-defense.

So maybe Option A is the better choice because it's about the mutual defense agreement, which is the essence of collective security. Option G is more about a specific action under self-defense.

Therefore, the answer should be A.

The meaning of collective security is best captured by the establishment of a mutual defense pact among several nations, where an attack on one is considered an attack on all, leading to a collective response. This concept is broader than individual self-defense and involves a system of shared security among member states. While other options touch on related ideas, such as self-defense or UN actions, the core definition aligns most closely with a mutual defense agreement.

Answer: A
