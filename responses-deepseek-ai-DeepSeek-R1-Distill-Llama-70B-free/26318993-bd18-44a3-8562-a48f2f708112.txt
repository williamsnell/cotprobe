Answer:
    <think>


To solve the equation \(1.2 = 0.4y\) using mental math, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the equation**: You need to find the value of \(y\) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Isolate \(y\)**: To isolate \(y\), divide both sides of the equation by \(0.4\):
   \[
   y = \frac{1.2}{0.4}
   \]

3. **Perform the division**: 
   - \(0.4 \times 3 = 1.2\), so \(1.2 \div 0.4 = 3\).

4. **Select the correct answer**: From the given options, \(y = 3\) corresponds to option **A**.
