Question:

How are nutrients and waste materials transported from the circulatory system to the body's tissues?

Options:

A: Waste materials are expelled from the body's tissues through the skin, while nutrients are provided by the respiratory system
B: Transportation occurs through the arteries
C: Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the circulatory system and tissues via osmosis in the large arteries
D: Transportation is facilitated by the veins
E: Nutrients are transported to the tissues by the red blood cells, and waste is carried away by the white blood cells
F: The spleen filters out waste from the blood, while nutrients are distributed by the liver directly to tissues
G: Nutrients and waste materials are transported from the circulatory system to the body's tissues through the capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs due to diffusion. The capillaries' thin wall and extensive branching allows this process.
H: Exchange of materials happens in the heart
I: The lymphatic system independently handles the transport of nutrients and waste to and from tissues
J: Nutrients and waste are directly transferred from the digestive system to the tissues without involving the circulatory system

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about how nutrients and waste materials are transported between the circulatory system and the body's tissues. Hmm, I remember some stuff from class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

The question gives me options from A to J. I need to pick the correct one. Let me start by recalling what I know about the circulatory system. I know that the circulatory system includes the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. The main function is to transport nutrients and oxygen to cells and remove waste products.

Wait, so how does the exchange happen? Oh right, capillaries are the smallest blood vessels. They have thin walls, which allows for the exchange of substances. I think this happens through diffusion because the walls are only one cell layer thick. So the nutrients from the blood pass through the capillary walls into the tissues, and waste products from the tissues enter the bloodstream through the capillaries.

Let me look at the options now. Option A says waste is expelled through the skin and nutrients come from the respiratory system. That doesn't sound right. The skin can expel some waste, like through sweating, but that's not the main system. And the respiratory system brings in oxygen, but the circulatory system transports it.

Option B says transportation occurs through arteries. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body, but I don't think the exchange happens in the arteries themselves. That's probably not the right answer.

Option C mentions exchange via osmosis in large arteries. Osmosis is a type of diffusion, but large arteries don't have the thin walls needed for exchange. It should be capillaries, not arteries.

Option D suggests veins facilitate the transport. Veins carry blood back to the heart, but again, the exchange is in the capillaries, not the veins themselves. So D might not be correct.

Option E says red blood cells transport nutrients and white blood cells waste. I remember that red blood cells carry oxygen, which is a nutrient, bound to hemoglobin. But nutrients also come from the blood plasma. White blood cells are more about immune response, not waste removal. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F talks about the spleen and liver. The spleen filters the blood, removing old red blood cells and recycling iron, and the liver processes nutrients from the digestive system. But this doesn't directly answer how the circulatory system transports to tissues.

Option G says the exchange happens through capillaries via diffusion because of their thin walls and extensive branching. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking earlier. Capillaries are the site of exchange, and diffusion is the process.

Option H says the exchange happens in the heart. No, the heart pumps blood but doesn't facilitate the exchange of nutrients and waste with tissues.

Option I mentions the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system does help with waste removal and returns lymph to the bloodstream, but the primary exchange is through the circulatory system, specifically capillaries.

Option J suggests direct transfer from the digestive system to tissues without the circulatory system. That's not correct because the digestive system absorbs nutrients into the bloodstream, which then transports them via capillaries.

So putting it all together, the correct answer must be option G.

The correct answer is:

G: Nutrients and waste materials are transported from the circulatory system to the body's tissues through the capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs due to diffusion. The capillaries' thin wall and extensive branching allows this process.

Answer: G
