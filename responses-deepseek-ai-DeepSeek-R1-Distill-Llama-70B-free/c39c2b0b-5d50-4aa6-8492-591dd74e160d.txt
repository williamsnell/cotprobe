Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a rhombus. Let me see what I remember about rhombuses. I think a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all four sides are equal in length. Also, the opposite sides are parallel, and the opposite angles are equal. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. That's an important point, I think.

The problem says that the diagonals of rhombus QRST intersect at point P. So Q, R, S, T are the vertices. Wait, actually, the name is QRST, so the order is Q, R, S, T? Or maybe it's Q, R, S, T going around. Well, probably, but the exact arrangement might not matter for this problem.

We're given that the measure of angle QTS is 76 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle TSP. Hmm, let me visualize this. So point Q, R, S, T form the rhombus. Let me try to draw it mentally. Let's say the rhombus is labeled in order, so the sides are QR, RS, ST, and TQ.

Wait, but the angle given is QTS, which would be at point T, between points Q, T, and S. So angle QTS is 76 degrees. Now, I need to find angle TSP. So point T, S, and P. P is the intersection of the diagonals. So angle TSP is at point S, between points T, S, and P.

Let me think about the properties of a rhombus. The diagonals bisect the angles. So each diagonal splits the vertex angles into two equal parts. Also, since the diagonals intersect at P, which is the midpoint, and they form right angles where they intersect.

Wait, but angle QTS is 76 degrees. Let me make sure I'm getting the points right. So angle QTS is at point T. So Q is one vertex, T is another, and S is the next. So in the rhombus, sides QT and TS meet at T, forming angle QTS. Since all sides are equal, the triangle QTS should be an isosceles triangle, but wait, no, because QT and TS are sides of the rhombus and thus equal. So triangle QTS is isosceles with QT=TS.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so QT and TS are equal, so the triangle QTS would have two sides equal, making it isosceles. Therefore, the base angles would be equal. Wait, but angle QTS is at the vertex T, which is the angle between QT and TS. So in triangle QTS, angle at T is 76 degrees, the other two angles at Q and S would be equal.

Wait, but in the rhombus, the sides are QT, TS, SR, RQ, etc. So the angles at each vertex are determined by the adjacent sides.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the properties of the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect the vertex angles. So each diagonal cuts the angle at each vertex into two equal parts. So if angle QTS is 76 degrees, perhaps that's one of the angles created by the diagonal.

Wait, but angle QTS is at point T. In rhombus QRST, the diagonals would be QS and RT, intersecting at P. So diagonal QS would split angle QTR into two equal angles. Wait, no, because in the rhombus, each diagonal bisects the angles at their respective vertices.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the structure. Let me try to sketch it in my mind. Let's say the rhombus is QRST, with vertices Q, R, S, T in order. So the sides are QR, RS, ST, and TQ. The diagonals are QS and RT, intersecting at point P.

So, at point T, the two sides are ST and TQ. The diagonal from T would be TS, but wait, no—diagonals connect opposite vertices. So the diagonals are QT and SR? No, wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So if the vertices are Q, R, S, T, then the diagonals would be QS and RT.

So, the diagonal QS connects Q to S, and RT connects R to T. They intersect at point P, which is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Now, the angle given is angle QTS, which is at point T, between points Q, T, and S. So that's the angle between sides QT and TS. Wait, but in the rhombus, QT is a diagonal, not a side. Wait, no. Wait, QT is a side only if the vertices are arranged as Q, R, S, T in order. Wait no, in the rhombus QRST, the sides are QR, RS, ST, and TQ. So the sides are QR, RS, ST, TQ. So QT would be a diagonal connecting Q and T, which are opposite vertices.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify the structure. Let me imagine the rhombus with vertices labeled in order as Q, R, S, T, so the sides are QR, RS, ST, and TQ. The diagonals would then be QS (connecting Q to S) and RT (connecting R to T), intersecting at P.

So, in this setup, at point T, the sides are ST and TQ. So the angle at T is between ST and TQ. Wait, but the given angle is QTS, which is at point T, formed by points Q, T, S. So that's angle between QT and TS. But in this labeling, QT is a diagonal, not a side, because the sides at T are ST and TQ (since TQ is a side, connecting T to Q). Wait, no, that can't be because TQ is a side, and QT would be the same as TQ. So perhaps I'm mixing up the labels.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to the rhombus to better visualize the problem.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the properties. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. So when diagonals QS and RT intersect at P, they form four right angles at P.

Also, the diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus. So, for example, the diagonal QS would bisect angle Q and angle S. Similarly, diagonal RT would bisect angles R and T.

Wait, so if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the angle at point T between points Q, T, and S. Since QT is a diagonal, perhaps that angle is formed by the diagonal and side TS.

Wait, but in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So the angle at T is split into two equal angles by the diagonal RT. So if angle QTS is 76 degrees, perhaps that's one of those bisected angles.

Wait, but if the diagonal RT bisects angle at T, then angle QTR would be equal to angle STP or something like that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

Wait, perhaps angle QTS is formed by the diagonal QS and side TS. Because point Q, T, S would form triangle QTS, with QT as a diagonal and TS as a side.

Wait, but if the diagonals bisect the angles, then the angle between the diagonal and the side would be half of the vertex angle at T. So if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that would be half of the angle at T. Therefore, the full angle at T would be 2 * 76 = 152 degrees. But wait, that doesn't seem right because in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 152, the adjacent would be 28 degrees, which adds up to 180. But that might not be necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider triangle QTS. Since QT is a diagonal and TS is a side, and in a rhombus all sides are equal, but the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square. So QT is a diagonal, and TS is a side, so their lengths aren't necessarily equal. Wait, but in the problem, angle QTS is given as 76 degrees. So in triangle QTS, angle at T is 76 degrees. But I'm not sure how this helps me find angle TSP.

Wait, angle TSP is at point S, between points T, S, and P. So that's the angle at S in triangle TSP, where P is the intersection point of the diagonals.

Let me think about the properties again. Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the triangles formed by the diagonals are right-angled. So triangle QPT would be right-angled at P, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the angles around point P. Since diagonals intersect at P, and they form right angles, each of the four angles around P is 90 degrees.

Now, let's consider triangle TSP. Point S is a vertex of the rhombus, and P is the midpoint where the diagonals intersect. So SP is a segment from S to P, which is along the diagonal QS.

Wait, no, SP is part of diagonal QS, which connects Q to S. Wait, no, because the diagonals are QS and RT, intersecting at P. So from S, the diagonal goes to Q, passing through P. Similarly, from R, the diagonal goes to T through P.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the triangle formed at S. The diagonal QS splits the angle at S into two equal parts. So if I can find the measure of the angle at S, then I can find angle TSP.

But wait, the given angle is at T, angle QTS = 76 degrees. So perhaps that relates to the angle at T, which the diagonal RT would bisect. So if angle at T is 76 degrees, then each of the angles formed by the diagonal RT would be 38 degrees each. But wait, no, because angle QTS is at T, but if the diagonal RT is bisecting the angle at T, then angle QTR would equal angle PTS, each being half of the angle at T.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to approach it step by step.

In rhombus QRST, diagonals QS and RT intersect at P. So QS and RT are the diagonals, intersecting at P, their midpoint, forming right angles.

At point T, the angle is formed by sides ST and TQ. The diagonal RT connects R to T, so it splits the angle at T into two equal angles. So each of those angles would be half of the vertex angle at T.

Now, the given angle is angle QTS, which is 76 degrees. Wait, angle QTS is at point T, between points Q, T, and S. So that's the angle between sides QT and TS. Wait, but QT is a diagonal, not a side. Wait, no, in the labeling, QT is a side because the sides are QR, RS, ST, and TQ. So TQ is a side, connecting T to Q, and TS is another side, connecting T to S. So at point T, the two sides are TQ and TS, forming the vertex angle at T.

The diagonal RT connects R to T, so it splits the angle at T into two equal parts. So angle QTR (between QT and RT) would be equal to angle STR (between RT and ST). So each of these angles would be half of the angle at T.

Wait, but the problem states that angle QTS is 76 degrees. Wait, angle QTS is at point T, between points Q, T, S. So that's angle between QT and TS, which is the vertex angle at T. So the measure of angle at T is 76 degrees. Then, since the diagonal RT splits this angle into two equal parts, each part would be 38 degrees (76 divided by 2).

So angle QTR would be 38 degrees, and angle STR would also be 38 degrees.

Now, I need to find angle TSP. Let me locate this angle. Point S is one vertex, and P is the intersection point of the diagonals. So angle TSP is at point S, between points T, S, and P.

So, at point S, the sides are RS and ST. The diagonal SP connects S to P, which is along diagonal QS. Wait, no, SP is part of diagonal QS, which runs from Q to S through P.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider triangle SPT. Wait, no, angle TSP is part of triangle TSP, which includes points T, S, and P.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Since the diagonals intersect at P and form right angles, the triangles formed are right-angled. So triangle QPT is right-angled at P, as are the other triangles.

Wait, but how does this help with angle TSP?

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, and considering the properties of the rhombus, perhaps the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the angles around point S. At point S, the sides are RS and ST, and the diagonal SP goes to P.

Since the diagonal QS bisects the angle at S, the angle between QS and SP would be equal to the angle between QS and SR.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The angle at S in the rhombus is equal to the angle at Q because opposite angles in a rhombus are equal. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at T is 76 degrees, then angle at R would also be 76 degrees, and angles at Q and S would be equal and supplementary to 76, so 180 - 76 = 104 degrees each.

So angles at Q and S are each 104 degrees.

Now, since the diagonal QS bisects the angle at S, each of the two angles formed by the diagonal at S would be 104 / 2 = 52 degrees.

So angle QSP would be 52 degrees, and angle PSS (if that's a thing) would also be 52, but perhaps that's not relevant.

Wait, but angle TSP is at point S, between T, S, and P. So that's the angle between side ST and diagonal SP. Since the diagonal SP splits the angle at S into two equal parts, each of 52 degrees, then angle TSP would be 52 degrees.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 52. So the answer should be E:52.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap:

1. Rhombus QRST with diagonals intersecting at P.

2. Angle QTS = 76 degrees. Since QTS is the angle at T between QT and TS, and since in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles, this angle is the vertex angle at T, which is 76 degrees.

3. Therefore, the angle at T is 76 degrees, so the angle at R is also 76 degrees (opposite angles in a rhombus are equal).

4. The sum of adjacent angles in a rhombus is 180 degrees, so angles at Q and S are each 180 - 76 = 104 degrees.

5. The diagonal QS bisects the angle at S, so each of the two angles formed by QS at S is 104 / 2 = 52 degrees.

6. Angle TSP is one of those angles, between ST and SP, so it's 52 degrees.

So the correct answer should be E:52.

In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Additionally, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles into two equal parts. The problem involves rhombus QRST with diagonals intersecting at point P. The given angle is ∠QTS = 76°, and we need to find the measure of ∠TSP.

1. **Understanding the Rhombus Properties**:  
   - All sides are equal.  
   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.  
   - Diagonals bisect the vertex angles.  
   - Opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.

2. **Analyzing the Given Angle**:  
   - ∠QTS = 76° is the angle at vertex T, formed by sides QT and TS.  
   - Since all sides of the rhombus are equal, the angle at T is 76°, and the opposite angle at R is also 76°.  

3. **Calculating the Angle at S**:  
   - Adjacent angles in a rhombus are supplementary.  
   - Therefore, the angle at S (and also at Q) is:  
     \[
     180^\circ - 76^\circ = 104^\circ
     \]

4. **Effect of the Diagonal QS**:  
   - The diagonal QS bisects the angle at S into two equal parts.  
   - Each of the two angles formed by the diagonal at S is:  
     \[
     \frac{104^\circ}{2} = 52^\circ
     \]

5. **Identifying ∠TSP**:  
   - ∠TSP is the angle at S between side TS and diagonal SP.  
   - Since the diagonal QS bisects the angle at S, ∠TSP is one of the two equal parts, which is 52°.

Thus, the measure of ∠TSP is **52°**.
