Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the angle between two vectors, a and b. Let me think about how to approach this. 

Alright, I remember that the formula to find the angle between two vectors is using the dot product. The formula is cosθ = (a · b) / (|a| |b|). So I guess I need to compute the dot product of a and b, and then find their magnitudes.

Wait, let me make sure I have the vectors right. Vector a is 3.0 i hat minus 4.0 j hat. So in components, that's (3, -4, 0) because there's no k component. Vector b is -2.0 i hat plus 3.0 k hat. So that would be (-2, 0, 3) since the j component is zero.

Now, the dot product a · b is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components and adding them up. So that's (3)(-2) + (-4)(0) + (0)(3). Let me compute that: 3*(-2) is -6, and the other terms are zero. So the dot product is -6.

Next, I need the magnitudes of a and b. For vector a, the magnitude |a| is sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2 + 0^2) which is sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. That's easy.

For vector b, the magnitude |b| is sqrt((-2)^2 + 0^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(4 + 0 +9) = sqrt(13). Hmm, sqrt(13) is approximately 3.6055, but I'll keep it as sqrt(13) for exactness.

So putting it into the formula: cosφ = (-6) / (5 * sqrt(13)). Let me compute the denominator: 5 multiplied by sqrt(13) is 5√13. So cosφ is -6/(5√13).

Wait, but I need to find the angle φ. So I'll take the arccos of this value. Let me compute the value of the fraction. Let's see, 5√13 is approximately 5*3.6055 which is about 18.0275. So -6 divided by 18.0275 is roughly -0.3328.

So cosφ ≈ -0.3328. Now, what angle has a cosine of approximately -0.3328? I remember that cos(180°) is -1, and cos(120°) is -0.5. Wait, but wait. -0.3328 is between 0 and -0.5, so the angle should be between 90 and 120 degrees maybe? Or wait, wait. Let me think again.

Actually, the cosine is negative, which means the angle is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180. Because in the unit circle, cos is negative in the second quadrant. So the angle should be between 90 and 180.

Let me think, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can rationalize the denominator earlier to make it easier. Let me see: -6/(5√13) can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by √13. That gives (-6√13)/(5*13) = (-6√13)/65. So cosφ = (-6√13)/65. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps me much.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the exact value using a calculator. Let me think about the steps again. Alternatively, maybe I can use exact values, but I don't see any standard angles here. So perhaps I should calculate it numerically.

So if I have cosφ = -0.3328, then φ = arccos(-0.3328). Let me approximate this. I know that cos(120°) is -0.5, which is about -0.5. And cos(90°) is 0. So our value is -0.3328, which is less negative than -0.5. So the angle should be less than 120 degrees because the cosine is higher (less negative) than at 120. So somewhere between 90 and 120 degrees.

Wait, let me think about some specific angles. I know that cos(60°) is 0.5, and cos(120°) is -0.5. So for values between 0.5 and -0.5, the angles go from 60 to 120 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the cosine function decreases from 0° to 180°, so when the cosine is positive, angle is less than 90, and when it's negative, angle is more than 90.

So at cosφ = -0.3328, what's the angle? Let me think. I'll try to figure this out. Alternatively, using a calculator for better approximation. Let's see, if I have a calculator, I can compute arccos(-0.3328).

Wait, I can think in terms of known angles. For example, cos(110°) is about cos(180-70) which is -cos70. Cos70 is approximately 0.3420, so cos110 is about -0.3420. Oh wait, that's very close to our value of -0.3328. So our angle is a little less than 110 degrees because the cosine is a bit higher (less negative) than -0.3420.

Wait, because if cos(110°) is -0.3420, and our value is -0.3328, which is a little less negative. So the angle should be a little less than 110 degrees. Because as the angle decreases below 110, the cosine becomes less negative. Wait, let me clarify: at 180 degrees, cos is -1; as the angle decreases from 180 to 90, the cosine increases from -1 to 0.

So if cos is -0.3328, which is higher than -0.3420 (i.e., less negative), that would correspond to a slightly smaller angle than 110 degrees. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, no: when the angle is 110 degrees, cos is about -0.3420. If our cos is -0.3328, which is a bit higher (less negative), that would correspond to a slightly smaller angle than 110 degrees. Because as the angle decreases from 180 to 90, the cosine increases (becomes less negative).

Wait, perhaps I should take an example. Let's say for 100 degrees: cos(100) is cos(180-80)= -cos80. Cos80 is about 0.1736, so cos100 is -0.1736. Hmm, but that's even less negative than our value. Wait, so our value is -0.3328, which is more negative than cos100, so the angle would be larger than 100 degrees but less than 110 degrees.

Wait, let me get a better approach. Let me think about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle using a calculator.

Wait, but since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I can compute the angle more accurately. Let me calculate it step by step.

So, the dot product is -6.

|a| is 5, |b| is sqrt(13). So the denominator is 5*sqrt(13) ≈ 5*3.60555 ≈ 18.0275.

So cosφ = (-6)/18.0275 ≈ -0.3328.

Now, calculating arccos(-0.3328). Let me see, perhaps using a calculator.

Wait, arccos(-0.3328) is approximately... let me think. I know that cos(110°) ≈ -0.3420, and cos(105°) is about -0.2588. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cos(60°)=0.5, cos(90°)=0, cos(120°)= -0.5, cos(150°)= -√3/2≈-0.8660.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Wait, when the angle is 180°, cos is -1. At 120°, it's -0.5. At 90°, it's 0.

So, if our value is cosφ = -0.3328, it's between -0.5 and 0, so the angle is between 90 and 180 degrees. Wait, more precisely, between 90 and 120, because at 120, cos is -0.5.

Wait, wait, wait. Because wait, no. Wait, the cosine function is decreasing from 0 to 180 degrees. So when the magnitude of cosine decreases, the angle increases.

Wait, so when cosφ is -0.3328, which is between 0 and -1. So the angle is greater than 90 degrees. But let's get more precise.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator for this. Let's compute it.

So, arccos(-0.3328) is approximately ... let me think about the value. Let me use a calculator function. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the angle whose cosine is 0.3328 in the first quadrant, then subtract from 180.

Wait, 0.3328 is approximately the cosine of around 70.5 degrees because cos(70) is about 0.3420, and cos(71) is about 0.3256. So 0.3328 is between 70 and 71 degrees. Let's say approximately 70.5 degrees.

So, in the second quadrant, the angle would be 180 - 70.5 = 109.5 degrees. So approximately 109.5 degrees, which is about 110 degrees.

Looking back at the options, option C is 109 degrees, which is very close. So maybe the exact angle is 109 degrees.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation. Because perhaps using exact values, the angle is 109 degrees.

So, the options given are:

A:150, B:45, C:109, D:180, E:75, F:60, G:120, H:135, I:90, J:105.

So, the closest is C:109.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Let's double-check.

Vector a is (3, -4, 0), vector b is (-2, 0, 3).

Dot product: (3)(-2) + (-4)(0) + (0)(3) = -6 + 0 + 0 = -6. Correct.

|a| is sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2) = 5. Correct.

|b| is sqrt((-2)^2 + 0^2 +3^2) = sqrt(4+9) = sqrt(13). Correct.

So cosφ = (-6)/(5*sqrt(13)).

Calculating 5*sqrt(13) = 5 * 3.60555 ≈ 18.02775.

So cosφ ≈ -6 / 18.02775 ≈ -0.3328.

Now, arccos(-0.3328) is 109.5 degrees approximately. So the closest option is C:109 degrees.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator more precisely. Let me think about how precise I can get.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about the components. Wait, maybe using the inverse cosine function on a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle using exact values. But I don't think that's necessary here because the options are given. So, given that 109 is an option, and our calculation is around 109.5, I think the correct answer is C:109 degrees.

To find the angle $\phi$ between the vectors $\vec{a} = 3.0 \hat{\mathrm{i}} - 4.0 \hat{\mathrm{j}}$ and $\vec{b} = -2.0 \hat{\mathrm{i}} + 3.0 \hat{\mathrm{k}}$, we use the formula:

\[
\cos\phi = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}| |\vec{b}|}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the dot product $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$
The dot product is calculated as:

\[
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = (3)(-2) + (-4)(0) + (0)(3) = -6 + 0 + 0 = -6
\]

### Step 2: Compute the magnitudes $|\vec{a}|$ and $|\vec{b}|$
The magnitude of $\vec{a}$ is:

\[
|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

The magnitude of $\vec{b}$ is:

\[
|\vec{b}| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{4 + 0 + 9} = \sqrt{13}
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\cos\phi$
Substituting into the formula:

\[
\cos\phi = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}| |\vec{b}|} = \frac{-6}{5 \cdot \sqrt{13}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\cos\phi = \frac{-6}{5\sqrt{13}} = \frac{-6\sqrt{13}}{5 \cdot 13} = \frac{-6\sqrt{13}}{65}
\]

Approximating $\sqrt{13} \approx 3.6055$:

\[
\cos\phi \approx \frac{-6}{5 \cdot 3.6055} \approx \frac{-6}{18.0275} \approx -0.3328
\]

### Step 4: Find $\phi$ using $\arccos$
The angle $\phi$ is:

\[
\phi = \arccos(-0.3328)
\]

Using a calculator, $\arccos(-0.3328) \approx 109.5^\circ$. This is very close to $109^\circ$.

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to $109.5^\circ$ is **C: 109°**.
