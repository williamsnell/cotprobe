Answer:

Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to perform two iterations using the Müller method on the equation x³ - 1/2 = 0. The initial guesses are x0 = 0, x1 = 1, and x2 = 1/2. I'm supposed to find the decimal value of x3 and choose the correct option from A to J.

Wait, what's the Müller method again? I remember it's a numerical method for finding roots, kind of like the secant method but using quadratic interpolation. Oh right, it uses the last three points to fit a quadratic equation and then finds the root of that quadratic.

So the general formula for the Müller method is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) * ( (x_n - x_{n-1}) * (x_n - x_{n-2}) ) / ( (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})) * (x_n - x_{n-2}) + (f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})) * (x_n - x_{n-1}) ) )

Wait, maybe I should double-check that formula. Alternatively, the iteration formula is derived from the quadratic fit. Let me think. The method constructs a quadratic polynomial that passes through the points (x_{n}, f(x_n)), (x_{n-1}, f(x_{n-1})), and (x_{n-2}, f(x_{n-2})). Then, the next approximation x_{n+1} is found by setting this quadratic to zero and solving for x.

So for each iteration, I need to calculate the next x value based on the previous three points. Since we've already got x0, x1, x2, we'll compute x3 in the first iteration beyond x2, which I think counts as the first iteration. Oh wait, the question says to perform two iterations. So after x2, we compute x3 (first iteration), then x4 (second iteration?), but the question is asking for x3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the initial points are x0, x1, x2. The first step would compute x3, which is the first iteration. Then, the second iteration would compute x4. But the question asks for x3, so I just need to perform one iteration beyond the initial points. Or perhaps the first two iterations after x2? Wait, the question says "perform 2 iterations", but the initial points are x0, x1, x2. So maybe the first iteration gives x3, the second gives x4. But the question is asking for x3, so we only need one iteration after the initial points.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me structure this.

Given:
x0 = 0
x1 = 1
x2 = 1/2

We're to compute x3 using the Müller method. Since we have three points (x0, x1, x2), the next step is to compute x3, which is the first iteration.

Wait, but the question says perform two iterations, so maybe we compute x3 and x4, but the question asks for x3. Hmm, perhaps I should read the question again.

The question says, "Perform 2 iterations with the Müller method... What's the decimal value of x3?" So that would mean that x3 is the result after the first iteration beyond x2. So perhaps the first iteration gives x3, and the second would give x4. But since the question is only asking for x3, I need to compute just one iteration beyond x2.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the initial data includes x0, x1, x2. So the first iteration (to get x3) would use x0, x1, x2. Then, the second iteration would use x1, x2, x3 to get x4. But the question is only asking for x3, so maybe I just need to compute x3 once.

So, let's start by computing x3.

The function is f(x) = x³ - 1/2. So let's compute f at each of the given points.

Compute f(x0): x0=0, so f(0)=0 - 0.5 = -0.5.

f(x1)=1^3 - 0.5= 1 - 0.5=0.5.

f(x2)= (1/2)^3 - 0.5= 1/8 - 0.5 = (1 - 4)/8 = (-3)/8 = -0.375.

So we have:

x0=0, f0=-0.5

x1=1, f1=0.5

x2=0.5, f2=-0.375

Now, applying the Müller method step to find x3.

The formula for the next iteration in the Müller method is:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) * [ (x_n - x_{n-1})(x_n - x_{n-2}) ] / D

Where D is the determinant of a certain matrix. Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) * ( (x_n - x_{n-1})*(x_n - x_{n-2}) ) / ( (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))*(x_n - x_{n-2}) + (f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2}))*(x_n - x_{n-1}) ) )

Alternatively, another approach is to construct the quadratic equation that passes through the three points (x0, f0), (x1, f1), (x2, f2). Then, the next estimate is the root of this quadratic that is closer to the last point.

So, let me try to model the quadratic equation. Let me denote the quadratic as:

p(x) = a x² + b x + c

We have p(x2) = f(x2), p(x1)=f(x1), p(x0)=f(x0).

So, substituting:

At x = x2: a (x2)^2 + b x2 + c = f(x2)

At x = x1: a (x1)^2 + b x1 + c = f(x1)

At x = x0: a (x0)^2 + b x0 + c = f(x0)

We can set up a system of equations to solve for a, b, c.

But perhaps a more efficient way is to use the method of finite differences or Lagrange interpolation.

Alternatively, since we're fitting a quadratic to three points, we can set up the equations and solve for a, b, c.

Let me denote x0=0, x1=1, x2=0.5.

So, substituting into p(x):

1. At x=0: a*0 + b*0 + c = f(0) → c = -0.5

2. At x=1: a*(1)^2 + b*(1) + c = 0.5 → a + b + c = 0.5

We know c = -0.5, so a + b - 0.5 = 0.5 → a + b = 1.0

3. At x=0.5: a*(0.5)^2 + b*(0.5) + c = -0.375 → a*(0.25) + 0.5 b + (-0.5) = -0.375

So 0.25a + 0.5b = -0.375 + 0.5 → 0.25a + 0.5b = 0.125

Now, from equation 2: a + b = 1 → b = 1 - a.

Substituting into equation 3:

0.25a + 0.5*(1 - a) = 0.125

0.25a + 0.5 - 0.5a = 0.125

Combine like terms:

(0.25a - 0.5a) + 0.5 = 0.125 → (-0.25a) + 0.5 = 0.125

→ -0.25a = 0.125 - 0.5 → -0.25a = -0.375 → a = (-0.375)/(-0.25) = 1.5

So a = 1.5, then from equation 2, b = 1 - a = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5

So the quadratic is p(x) = 1.5 x² -0.5 x - 0.5

Now, to find the root of p(x)=0, we solve 1.5x² -0.5x -0.5 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [0.5 ± sqrt( ( -0.5 )^2 -4*1.5*(-0.5) ) ] / (2 * 1.5)

Compute discriminant D:

D = (0.5)^2 - 4*(1.5)*(-0.5) → 0.25 + 3 → 3.25

sqrt(D) = sqrt(3.25) ≈ 1.802.

So,

x = [0.5 ± 1.802 ] / 3

Compute both roots:

First root: (0.5 + 1.802)/3 ≈ (2.302)/3 ≈ 0.7673

Second root: (0.5 - 1.802)/3 ≈ (-1.302)/3 ≈ -0.434

Now, the Müller method uses the root that's closer to the last point, which is x2=0.5. So between 0.7673 and -0.434, which is closer to 0.5? 0.7673 is about 0.26 away from 0.5, while -0.434 is 0.934 away. So we choose 0.7673 as x3.

But wait, let me make sure I'm applying the method correctly. The Müller method picks the root that's on the same side as the last point's function value. Wait, another approach is that the next point should lie within the interval of the last two points if possible. Let's check the function values around these roots.

Wait, the function f(x) = x³ - 0.5. Let's compute f(0.7673):

(0.7673)^3 ≈ 0.7673 * 0.7673 = ~0.588, then * 0.7673 ≈ 0.451. So 0.451 - 0.5 = -0.049.

Hmm, but earlier, f(x2)=f(0.5)= -0.375, which is negative. And f(x1)=0.5, positive. So the root we're seeking is between x1=1 and x2=0.5, but wait, x2 is 0.5, and x1 is 1.0. Wait no, x2 is 0.5, x1 is 1.0, and x0 is 0. So the function changes sign between x0 and x1: f(0)=-0.5, f(1)=0.5. So the root is between 0 and 1, but more precisely, between 0.5 and 1, since f(0.5)=-0.375 and f(1)=0.5.

Wait, but the quadratic model gave us roots at about 0.7673 and -0.434. So 0.7673 is between 0.5 and 1, which is where the actual root lies, so that's the one we should choose.

So x3 ≈ 0.7673.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.7684, which is very close. But perhaps my approximation of sqrt(3.25) is a bit off. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(3.25) is sqrt(13/4) = sqrt(13)/2 ≈ 3.6055512755/2 ≈ 1.8027756377.

So the first root is (0.5 + 1.8027756377)/3 = (2.3027756377)/3 ≈ 0.7675918792.

So approximately 0.7675918792.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.7684, which is very close. But wait, the options are:

A: 0.7058

B: 0.8831

C: 0.6543

D: 0.8173

E: 0.7929

F: 0.8976

G: 0.7684

H: 0.7465

I: 0.8512

J: 0.9325

So 0.7675 is closest to G: 0.7684, but let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should perform the second iteration to get x3, but wait, the question says two iterations. Oh, wait, maybe I misinterpreted the initial setup.

Wait, the initial points are x0, x1, x2. The first iteration would compute x3, and the second would compute x4. So if the question is asking for x3 after two iterations, perhaps I'm missing something. No, wait, no: the first iteration (after x2) gives x3, the second gives x4. But the question asks for x3, so perhaps only one iteration is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute two steps beyond x2, but that doesn't make much sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute x3 using the first iteration, then x4 using the second, but the question is only asking for x3, so perhaps I stop after computing x3.

But in any case, the calculation I did gives x3 ≈ 0.7675, which is very close to option G (0.7684). However, perhaps I made an error in the quadratic setup.

Wait, let me double-check the quadratic equation. The points are (0, -0.5), (1, 0.5), (0.5, -0.375).

Setting up the system:

For x=0: 0*a + 0*b + c = -0.5 → c = -0.5

For x=1: a + b + c = 0.5 → a + b = 1 (since c is -0.5)

For x=0.5: 0.25a + 0.5b + c = -0.375 → 0.25a + 0.5b = -0.375 + 0.5 → 0.25a + 0.5b = 0.125

So from equation 2: a = 1 - b

Substitute into equation 3:

0.25*(1 - b) + 0.5b = 0.125

0.25 - 0.25b + 0.5b = 0.125

0.25 + 0.25b = 0.125 → 0.25b = -0.125 → b = -0.5

So a = 1 - (-0.5) = 1.5. So quadratic is 1.5x² - 0.5x -0.5.

That's correct.

So the roots are at x = [0.5 ± sqrt(0.25 + 3)] / 3 → [0.5 ± sqrt(3.25)] /3.

Which is [0.5 ± 1.8027756377]/3.

So the positive root is (0.5 + 1.8027756377)/3 ≈ 2.3027756377/3 ≈ 0.767591879.

So x3 ≈ 0.767591879.

Looking at the options, G is 0.7684, which is very close. But perhaps I should carry more decimal places to see if it matches any option exactly.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.5 + 1.8027756377319946 = 2.3027756377319946

Divide by 3: 2.3027756377319946 /3 = 0.7675918792439982.

So approximately 0.767592.

Looking at the options:

G: 0.7684

H: 0.7465

None match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Müller method uses a different approach. Maybe instead of taking the quadratic's root in the same way, the formula is different.

I recall that the Müller iteration formula is:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) * ( (x_n - x_{n-1})*(x_n - x_{n-2}) ) / [ (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))*(x_n - x_{n-2}) + (f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2}))*(x_n - x_{n-1}) ) ]

So let me compute this using the formula.

Given:

x0=0, f0=-0.5

x1=1, f1=0.5

x2=0.5, f2=-0.375

Compute denominator D:

D = (f2 - f1)*(x2 - x1) + (f1 - f0)*(x2 - x0)

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator in the formula is:

D = (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))*(x_n - x_{n-2}) + (f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2}))*(x_n - x_{n-1})

In this case, n=2, so:

D = (f2 - f1)*(x2 - x0) + (f1 - f0)*(x2 - x1)

Compute each term:

f2 - f1 = (-0.375) - 0.5 = -0.875

x2 - x0 = 0.5 - 0 = 0.5

So first term: (-0.875) * 0.5 = -0.4375

Second term:

f1 - f0 = 0.5 - (-0.5) = 1.0

x2 - x1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5

So second term: 1.0 * (-0.5) = -0.5

Thus D = (-0.4375) + (-0.5) = -0.9375

The numerator
