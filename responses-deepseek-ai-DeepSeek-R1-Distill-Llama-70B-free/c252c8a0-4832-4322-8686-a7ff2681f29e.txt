Question:

A ceramics studio contracted with an artist to produce cups and saucers designed by the artist. The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: "2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery." The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?

Options:

A: No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.
B: No, because the evidence would contradict the explicit terms of the contract.
C: Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.
D: Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.
E: No, because the contract contained a merger clause which makes extrinsic evidence inadmissible.
F: Yes, because the studio's interpretation of the contract aligns with the industry practice.
G: Yes, because the court should consider industry norms in interpreting the contract.
H: No, because the agreement was completely integrated.
I: No, because the artist was unaware of the industry practice.
J: Yes, because the evidence of established industry practice may explain the ambiguity in the contract.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a ceramics studio that contracted with an artist to produce cups and saucers. The contract says "2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery." The studio delivered 4,000 pieces (I guess 2,000 cups and 2,000 saucers) and billed $20,000, but the artist only wants to pay $10,000, thinking it's 2,000 sets at $5 per set.

At trial, the studio introduced evidence of an established industry practice to price these sets on a per-piece basis, not per set. The question is whether this evidence is admissible.

Hmm. I remember that when interpreting contracts, courts look at the language of the contract first. If the terms are clear and unambiguous, extrinsic evidence (like industry practice) isn't allowed to contradict them. But if there's ambiguity, then extrinsic evidence can be used to clarify the meaning.

So the contract says "2,000 sets... at $5 each." Wait, "each" is a bit ambiguous. Does "each" refer to each set or each piece? If it's each set, then each set is $5, so 2,000 sets would be $10,000. But if "each" refers to each piece (cup and saucer), then each piece is $5, so 4,000 pieces would be $20,000.

The studio is arguing that in their industry, it's standard to price per piece. So they're introducing this evidence to show that "each" was meant per piece, not per set.

Now, the contract has a merger clause, which typically means that the written agreement is the final and complete expression of the parties' understanding, and that extrinsic evidence can't be used to contradict it. But I think a merger clause doesn't necessarily bar the use of extrinsic evidence to interpret ambiguous terms; it just prevents adding terms that aren't in the contract.

So the key here is whether the contract term is ambiguous. If "each" is ambiguous, then extrinsic evidence like industry practice is admissible to explain what the parties intended.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because it varies an unambiguous term. But if "each" is ambiguous, this wouldn't apply.

Option B says no because it contradicts explicit terms. Again, if the term is ambiguous, this isn't a contradiction but an interpretation.

Option C says yes because trade usage is always admissible. That's not right; it's only admissible if the term is ambiguous.

Option D says yes because trade usage gives meaning. That makes sense if the term is ambiguous.

Option E says no because of the merger clause. But merger clauses donâ€™t bar evidence for interpreting ambiguous terms.

Option F says yes because studio's interpretation aligns with industry practice. That seems relevant, but it's more about whether the evidence is admissible, not just whether it supports the studio.

Option G says yes because courts consider industry norms. That's true when terms are ambiguous.

Option H says no because the agreement is completely integrated. Similar to E, but again, complete integration doesn't bar extrinsic evidence for interpretation.

Option I says no because the artist was unaware. But trade usage can still be used even if one party wasn't aware, as long as it's common knowledge in the industry.

Option J says yes because evidence explains the ambiguity. That seems correct because "each" could be ambiguous.

So the contract term is ambiguous about whether "each" refers to set or piece. Therefore, the studio's evidence of industry practice is admissible to clarify this ambiguity. The correct answer should be D or J.

Wait, D says yes because trade usage gives meaning. J says yes because it explains the ambiguity.

I think the best answer is J because it specifically points out that the evidence is used to explain an ambiguity, which is the correct reason extrinsic evidence is allowed.
</think>

The contract between the ceramics studio and the artist contains the term "2,000 sets of cups and saucers at $5 each." The ambiguity lies in whether "each" refers to each set or each individual piece (cup or saucer). The studio argues that industry practice prices cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece basis, and they seek to introduce evidence of this practice to interpret the contract.

Under contract law, when a term is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence, such as trade usage, is admissible to clarify the parties' intended meaning. The presence of a merger clause does not bar the use of extrinsic evidence for interpreting ambiguous terms; it only prevents adding terms not included in the contract. Here, the ambiguity in "each" makes the evidence of industry practice relevant and admissible to resolve the dispute.

Option J correctly identifies that the evidence is admissible because it explains the ambiguity in the contract, making it the best answer.

Answer: J
