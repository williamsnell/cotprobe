Okay, so I've got this gas problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these gas law questions. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the question says: A gas at 250 K and 15 atm has a molar volume 12% smaller than that calculated from the perfect gas law. I need to find the molar volume of the gas, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, so the perfect gas law is PV = nRT. I remember that the molar volume (Vm) is the volume per mole, so when n=1, Vm = RT/P. Right.

So first, I should calculate what the molar volume would be if the gas were perfect, and then adjust it because it's 12% smaller. That makes sense.

Let me jot down the variables:
- Temperature T = 250 K
- Pressure P = 15 atm
- R is the gas constant. I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using these units. Because when P is in atm, V is in liters.

So, using the ideal gas law, Vm (ideal) = RT/P.

Plugging in the numbers:
Vm_ideal = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * 250 K / 15 atm.

Let me compute that. 0.0821 * 250 = let's see. 0.08 *250 is 20, and 0.0021*250 is 0.525, so together it's about 20.525. Then divide by 15. 

20.525 / 15 equals... let's see, 15 *1.367 is 20.505, so approximately 1.367 L/mol. So Vm_ideal is about 1.367 dm³/mol since 1 L is 1 dm³.

Wait, wait, the problem says the actual molar volume is 12% smaller than the ideal. So the real Vm is 100% - 12% = 88% of the ideal value.

So Vm_real = Vm_ideal * (1 - 0.12) = 1.367 * 0.88.

Let me calculate that. 1.367 * 0.8 is 1.0936, and 1.367 * 0.08 is 0.10936. Adding those together: 1.0936 + 0.10936 = 1.20296 dm³/mol. So approximately 1.203 dm³/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.2, which is really close. Option E is 1.8, which is higher. Option B is 1.35, which is too high. Wait, but wait, I thought 12% smaller than 1.367 is about 1.203, so 1.2 is the right answer. So option A is 1.2 dm³/mol.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recalculate the ideal Vm.

R = 0.0821, T=250, P=15.

Vm_ideal = (0.0821 * 250) / 15.

0.0821 *250: 0.08 *250 is 20, 0.0021*250 is 0.525. So 20.525. Divide by 15: 20.525 /15.

Hmm, 15 *1 is 15, 20.525-15=5.525. 15 *0.36 is 5.4, which leaves 0.125. 0.125/15 is about 0.0083. So 1.36 + 0.0083 is about 1.3683. So Vm_ideal is approximately 1.368 dm³/mol.

Then, 12% less than that is 1.368 *0.88. Let me compute this more accurately.

1.368 * 0.88:

Calculate 1.368 *0.8 = 1.0944.

1.368 *0.08 = 0.10944.

Adding them: 1.0944 + 0.10944 = 1.20384 dm³/mol. So approximately 1.204 dm³/mol, which is 1.20 when rounded to two decimal places.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1.2 dm³/mol. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I used the right units for R. Oh wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), so yes, that's correct. So the calculations are right.

So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the molar volume of the gas using the ideal gas law, \( V_m = \frac{RT}{P} \). The given values are:

- \( T = 250 \, \mathrm{K} \)
- \( P = 15 \, \mathrm{atm} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / (mol \cdot K)} \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
V_m (\text{ideal}) = \frac{(0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / (mol \cdot K)}) \cdot 250 \, \mathrm{K}}{15 \, \mathrm{atm}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.0821 \cdot 250 = 20.525 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / mol}
\]

Now divide by the pressure:

\[
V_m (\text{ideal}) = \frac{20.525}{15} \approx 1.367 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \cdot mol^{-1}}
\]

The problem states that the actual molar volume is 12% smaller than the ideal value. To find the actual molar volume:

\[
V_m (\text{real}) = V_m (\text{ideal}) \cdot (1 - 0.12)
\]

Substitute \( V_m (\text{ideal}) \approx 1.367 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \cdot mol^{-1}} \):

\[
V_m (\text{real}) = 1.367 \cdot 0.88 \approx 1.203 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \cdot mol^{-1}}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( V_m (\text{real}) \approx 1.20 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \cdot mol^{-1}} \).

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**A: 1.2 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \cdot mol^{-1}}**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**
