Okay, let's tackle this optics problem. Hmm, I've got a multiple-choice question about a thin lens and stops. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the question is divided into three parts: determining what limits the light (aperture stop or lens aperture), finding the effective f-number, and finding the exit pupil location.

First, let me visualize the setup. There's a thin lens with a 50 mm focal length. So f = 50 mm. The diameter of the lens is 4 cm, so the radius is 2 cm. Then there's a stop (aperture stop) placed 3 cm to the left of the lens. The stop has a circular opening of 2 cm diameter, so radius 1 cm. There's an axial point object 20 cm to the left of the stop. Wait, so the object is 20 cm left of the stop, which is itself 3 cm left of the lens. So the object is 23 cm to the left of the lens (20 +3).

Part 1: Which limits the light—the aperture stop or the lens aperture?

I remember that the aperture stop is the physical stop that limits the amount of light entering the system. But sometimes, the lens itself can act as the stop if the stop is larger than the lens aperture. But wait, actually, it's about where the stop is positioned relative to the lens.

Wait, another approach: The aperture stop is the one that actually limits the light, but sometimes it's the lens that acts as the stop. I think the aperture stop is usually the limiting factor unless the lens is smaller. So here, the stop has a diameter of 2 cm, and the lens has 4 cm. So the stop is smaller. But position matters too.

Wait, I think the key is to find the entrance pupil. The entrance pupil is the image of the aperture stop as seen from the object side through the lens. Or wait, maybe the other way around; the exit pupil is the image of the aperture stop as seen from the image side. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the marginal rays. The idea is to see where the rays from the object would be clipped by either the aperture stop or the lens. If the stop is in front of the lens, then the stop could limit the light entering.

Wait, the object is at 20 cm left of the stop, which is 3 cm left of the lens. So the object is 23 cm from the lens. Since f is 50 mm (5 cm), the object is inside the focal length because 23 cm is greater than 5 cm? Wait, no, 23 cm is way larger than 5 cm. Wait, 23 cm is 230 mm, which is way beyond 50 mm. So the object is far away. Wait, no: wait, 20 cm is 200 mm, which is definitely beyond the focal length of 50 mm. So the object is real and outside.

Wait, let me correct: the object is 20 cm to the left of the stop, which is 3 cm left of the lens. So the object is 20 +3 = 23 cm from the lens. Since the focal length is 5 cm, 23 cm is greater than f, so the object is in the real object region (beyond f), so the image will be real and inverted.

Now, to find whether the stop or the lens limits the light. To do that, I think I should calculate the size of the image of the stop on the lens. If the image of the stop (as seen from the lens) is smaller than the lens aperture, then the stop is the limiting aperture. Otherwise, the lens aperture is limiting.

Wait, but how do I compute the image size of the stop on the lens? The stop is 3 cm in front of the lens. So the object distance for the lens considering the stop is 3 cm. Wait, no, the stop is in front, so the lens is forming an image of the stop. Let me think.

The stop is 3 cm to the left of the lens, so the object distance u for the lens is 3 cm. The focal length is 5 cm. Using the lens formula:

1/f = 1/v + 1/u

So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u = 1/5 - 1/3 = (3-5)/(15) = -2/15. So v = -15/2 = -7.5 cm.

So the image of the stop is 7.5 cm to the right of the lens. That is, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object (left side for a real object). Wait, but the stop is on the left side of the lens, so the image is virtual on the left side, behind the lens.

Wait, no, the stop is at u =3 cm (left of lens). So the image is at v =7.5 cm on the same side as the object, which is the left. But that doesn't make sense because the image should be real when u>f, but wait u is 3 cm, which is less than f=5 cm. So u is in the virtual object region, which would give a virtual image on the same side. Wait, wait, no, u is positive when the object is real, so u=3 cm is a real object. But wait, if u< f, then the image is virtual on the same side as the object.

So the image of the stop is virtual, located 7.5 cm to the left of the lens. So the size of the stop's image, as seen by the lens, would determine if the stop or lens is the aperture limiting factor.

Wait, I think the concept here is the entrance pupil. The entrance pupil is the image of the aperture stop as seen from the object side. Alternatively, the size of the entrance pupil compared to the lens aperture determines which limits the light.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnification. The magnification m is given by m = v/u. Wait, but for lens formula, m = -v/u. Since v is negative (image on same side as object), so m = - (-7.5)/3 = 7.5/3 = 2.5. So the image is magnified by 2.5 times.

The stop has a diameter of 2 cm. So the image (entrance pupil) would have a diameter of m * stop diameter. So 2.5 * 2 cm =5 cm. Wait, but the lens itself is only 4 cm in diameter. So the entrance pupil image is 5 cm, but the lens is 4 cm. So the lens is smaller, thus the lens aperture would limit the light. Wait, no, because the entrance pupil is the image of the stop as seen from the object. So if the entrance pupil is larger than the lens, then the lens is the limiting aperture. Wait, perhaps I have this backwards.

Wait another approach: The aperture stop is the stop that actually limits the bundle of rays. The entrance pupil is the image of the stop as seen through the lens. If the entrance pupil is larger than the lens aperture, then the lens limits the light. Otherwise, the stop does.

So in this case, the image of the stop (entrance pupil) is 5 cm in diameter, but the lens is 4 cm. Wait, 5 cm is larger than 4 cm, so the lens is the limiting aperture. So the lens aperture limits the light. So for part 1, the answer is the lens aperture limits.

But wait, let me think again. The stop is smaller (2 cm) than the lens (4 cm), but when imaged through the lens, the stop's image (the entrance pupil) is larger than the lens. So the actual aperture that limits the light is the lens because the image of the stop is larger than the lens.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: the aperture stop is the physical stop that limits the light. The entrance pupil is the image of the aperture stop. So if the entrance pupil is larger than the lens, then the lens acts as the stop; otherwise, the stop is the limiting factor.

Wait, no. The entrance pupil can't be larger than the lens, because the lens is the medium through which light passes. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the numerical aperture or something else, but maybe it's easier to move on and see how it affects the f-number, then come back.

Part 2: Effective f-number.

The effective f-number is given by f_eff = f / (D_aperture), where D_aperture is the diameter of the limiting aperture.

Wait, but wait, I think the effective f-number is based on the aperture stop's size relative to the system. Alternatively, if the lens is the limiting aperture, then the f-number is f/(lens diameter). If the stop is the limiting, then it's f/(stop diameter), but adjusted for where the stop is located.

Wait, perhaps the effective f-number is the f-number as seen at the stop's position. So the formula is f_eff = (f * stop diameter) / (D_image), where D_image is the diameter of the image of the stop.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, the effective f-number is determined by the limiting aperture. So if the lens aperture is the limiting one, then effective f-number is 50 mm divided by the lens diameter (40 mm?), wait wait, no, units are mixed here.

Wait, let me clarify units. The focal length f is 50 mm, so 5 cm. The lens diameter is 4 cm, so radius 2 cm. The stop diameter is 2 cm, radius 1 cm.

If the lens is the limiting aperture, then the effective f-number is f / (D_lens) = 50 mm / 40 mm = 1.25. But wait, that's f/D. Wait, no, f is 50 mm, D is 40 mm. So 50/40 = 1.25. So f-number 1.25.

But wait, in the options, J says lens limits, f-number 1.25. Option A has f-number 2.5. But wait, when the stop is in front, perhaps the effective f-number is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps when the stop is not at the lens, the effective f-number is f/(D_stop * (f/(u))), where u is the distance from stop to lens. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, using the concept of the entrance pupil.

Wait, the entrance pupil diameter D_ep is equal to the stop diameter multiplied by (f/u), where u is the distance from the stop to the lens. So D_ep = D_stop * (f/u).

Here, D_stop is 2 cm, f is 5 cm, u is 3 cm. So D_ep = 2 * (5/3) ≈3.333 cm.

Wait, but the lens diameter is 4 cm. So the entrance pupil is 3.333 cm, which is smaller than the lens diameter of 4 cm. That would mean that the entrance pupil (image of the stop) limits the light, so the stop is the limiting aperture. Hmm, but earlier calculation suggested that the image of the stop is larger than the lens, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, earlier I thought that the image of the stop (entrance pupil) is 5 cm, but now I'm getting 3.333 cm. That's conflicting. Let me clarify.

Wait, when the stop is placed at a distance u from the lens, the entrance pupil's diameter is given by D_ep = D_stop * (f/u). So D_ep = 2 cm * (5 cm /3 cm) = 10/3 ≈3.333 cm.

So the entrance pupil is 3.333 cm in diameter. The lens has a diameter of 4 cm. So since 3.333 < 4, the entrance pupil is smaller, meaning that it limits the light. So the stop is the limiting aperture.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the image of the stop using the lens formula, I got v = -7.5 cm and magnification m =2.5, so the image size would be 2 cm *2.5=5 cm. But that's the size as seen from the object side. So if the image (entrance pupil) is 5 cm, which is larger than the lens's 4 cm, then the lens would limit the light.

Wait, now I'm getting conflicting results. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for entrance pupil diameter is D_ep = D_stop * (f/(u)), which is 3.333 cm. Then, since 3.333 <4, the entrance pupil is smaller, so the stop is the limiting aperture. So in part 1, the stop is limiting.

But earlier, using the lens formula, the image of the stop is 5 cm, which is larger than the lens's 4 cm, implying the lens is the limiting.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the correct approach, but since I can't, I'll have to think it through.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to determine the numerical aperture at the lens. The numerical aperture is determined by the limiting aperture. The limiting aperture is the one that, when imaged through the system, appears smallest at the lens.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the chief ray. The chief ray goes from the object through the stop and then through the lens. The point where the chief ray intersects the lens is the center. The extreme ray (marginal ray) from the object will pass through the edge of the stop and the edge of the lens if the stop is limiting. Otherwise, if the lens is smaller, the marginal ray would be cut off by the lens before reaching the edge.

Wait, perhaps using similar triangles. Let me model the situation. The stop is 3 cm in front of the lens. The object is 20 cm left of the stop, which is 23 cm left of the lens.

For the marginal ray from the object's edge (but wait, the object is a point, so maybe considering the maximum angle). The maximum angle is determined by the stop. Let's see.

The marginal ray from the object (at 23 cm from lens) passes through the edge of the stop (which is at 3 cm from lens, 20 cm from object). The stop has a radius of 1 cm, so the marginal ray makes an angle such that tan(theta) = 1 cm / 3 cm = 1/3.

This ray then travels from the stop to the lens. The distance between stop and lens is 3 cm. So the height of the ray at the lens would be 1 cm + (3 cm)*tan(theta) = 1 + 3*(1/3) = 2 cm. So the ray reaches a height of 2 cm at the lens. The lens has a radius of 2 cm, so the ray just passes through the edge of the lens. Therefore, in this case, the stop is the limiting aperture because the marginal ray just reaches the lens edge.

Wait, that's an important point. So the ray from the object, passing through the edge of the stop, arrives at the lens edge. So if the stop were any smaller, the ray would be cut off before the lens. So in this case, the stop is the limiting aperture because the marginal ray exactly reaches the lens edge. So part 1 answer is the aperture stop limits the light.

Wait, but if the stop's edge projects a ray that just touches the lens edge, then the stop is the limiting. But if the projection were beyond the lens edge, then the lens would limit. So in this case, the stop is exactly the limiting.

So part 1: the aperture stop limits the light.

Now part 2: effective f-number.

The effective f-number is determined by the limiting aperture. Since the stop is limiting, the effective f-number is calculated based on the stop's size as seen by the lens.

Wait, the effective f-number is the f-number of the system considering the limiting aperture. So if the stop is the limiting aperture, the effective f-number is f/(D_stop_effective), where D_stop_effective is the diameter of the stop as seen from the lens.

Wait, no, perhaps the effective f-number is f/(D_ep), where D_ep is the entrance pupil diameter.

Wait, the entrance pupil is the image of the stop as seen from the object side. So the size of the entrance pupil is D_ep = D_stop * (f/u), where u is the distance from stop to lens. So D_ep =2 cm * (5 cm /3 cm) ≈3.333 cm.

But the f-number is usually calculated as f/(D), where D is the aperture. So in this case, the effective f-number would be f/D_ep = 50 mm / (33.33 mm) ≈1.5. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the effective f-number is calculated as f/(D_stop), but scaled by the ratio of distances.

Wait, perhaps the formula is effective f-number = (f * D_stop) / (u * D_lens), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the effective f-number is the f-number as seen at the position of the stop. So since the stop is 3 cm in front of the lens, the effective f-number is f_eff = (f) * (u/f +1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The f-number is defined as the focal length divided by the diameter of the aperture. But when the aperture is not at the lens, you have to consider the image of the aperture as seen by the lens.

Wait, the effective aperture is the image of the stop as seen by the lens. So the size of this image is D_image = D_stop * (v/u), where v is the image distance from the lens to the image of the stop.

Wait, earlier using the lens formula, we found v = -7.5 cm. So the magnification is m = v/u = -7.5/3 = -2.5. So the image of the stop is 2.5 times larger than the stop. So D_image =2 cm *2.5=5 cm.

But the lens has a diameter of 4 cm. So the effective aperture at the lens is limited by the lens itself, which is 4 cm. So the effective f-number is f/(D_lens) =50 mm /40 mm=1.25.

But wait, the options don't all have f-number 1.25. Option J says lens limits and f-number 1.25. But earlier, I thought the stop was limiting.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let's clarify:

If the image of the stop as seen by the lens is 5 cm, but the lens can only accept up to 4 cm, then the effective aperture is 4 cm, so the lens is limiting. So the effective f-number is 50/40=1.25.

But earlier, the marginal ray calculation suggested that the stop is the limiting because the ray just
