Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about continuously compounded returns, also known as log-returns. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns. The options are A through D. I remember that log-returns have some specific characteristics, especially compared to simple returns.

First, I should recall what continuously compounded returns are. From what I remember, log-returns are calculated using the natural logarithm of the price relatives. So, if you have a price today (Pt) and a price at time t+1 (Pt+1), the log-return r is ln(Pt+1/Pt). This is different from the simple return, which is just (Pt+1 - Pt)/Pt.

Now, looking at each option:

Option A: They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices. That makes sense because the term "continuously compounded" implies that the returns are compounded over an infinitely small period, hence the use of continuous growth models. So A is a feature, so it's not the answer.

Option B: They can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods. Wait, I think this is correct. Because log-returns have the property that when you have returns over multiple periods, you can add them up. For example, if you have log-returns for two consecutive periods, r1 and r2, the total return over both periods is r1 + r2. Because ln(a) + ln(b) = ln(ab). So for longer periods, you can sum the log-returns. So B is a feature, which means it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option C: They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns. Hmm, this is tricky. Wait, when you have a portfolio, the log-return isn't just the sum of individual log-returns. Because the portfolio return is based on the total value. Let me think. If you have two assets, each with their own log-returns, the portfolio's log-return isn't simply the sum of the two. It depends on their weights in the portfolio. So, for example, if asset A has weight w and return r_A, and asset B has weight (1-w) and return r_B, the portfolio return in log terms would be the log of (w*e^{r_A} + (1-w)*e^{r_B}). That's not simply r_A + r_B. So adding log-returns across assets doesn't give the correct portfolio return. Therefore, option C is NOT a feature of log-returns, making it the correct answer.

Option D: They are usually fat-tailed. I remember that financial returns often exhibit fat tails, meaning extreme events are more common than a normal distribution would predict. Log-returns might not necessarily cause fat tails; in fact, the distribution of log-returns tends to be more normal, but the prices themselves can have fat tails. Wait, no, actually, log-returns can also exhibit fat-tailedness. Or perhaps the returns being in log form can sometimes mitigate some of the tail behavior, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe simple returns can be fat-tailed, and log-returns might be as well. So I'm not sure if D is a feature or not. But the question is about which is NOT a feature. Since I'm more confident about option C, I think the answer is C.

The question asks which option is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns (log-returns). Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Log-returns are indeed interpreted as continuously compounded changes in prices, as they are derived using the natural logarithm of price relatives. This is a feature, so it is not the correct answer.

- **Option B**: Log-returns can be added over time to calculate returns for longer periods. This is because the logarithmic property allows for the addition of returns across periods (e.g., $\ln(a) + \ln(b) = \ln(ab)$). Thus, this is a feature and not the correct answer.

- **Option C**: Log-returns cannot be simply added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns. The portfolio's log-return depends on the weights of the assets and their individual returns, not their direct summation. Therefore, this is NOT a feature of log-returns, making it the correct answer.

- **Option D**: Financial returns, including log-returns, are often fat-tailed, meaning extreme events occur more frequently than predicted by a normal distribution. This is a feature, so it is not the correct answer.

The correct answer is **C**, as log-returns cannot be added across a portfolio to derive the portfolio return.
