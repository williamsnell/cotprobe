Okay, so I need to find the largest integer x for which (x + 11)/(x + 7) is an integer. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that for a fraction to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator. So, (x + 11) must be divisible by (x + 7). That means when I divide (x + 11) by (x + 7), there should be no remainder.

Let me try to rewrite this fraction. Maybe I can express it in a different way to make it easier. Let's see, (x + 11)/(x + 7) can be rewritten by splitting the numerator. So, x + 11 is the same as (x + 7) + 4. So the fraction becomes:

(x + 7 + 4)/(x + 7) = 1 + 4/(x + 7)

Oh, right! So (x + 11)/(x + 7) is equal to 1 plus 4 divided by (x + 7). For this entire expression to be an integer, 4/(x +7) must also be an integer because 1 is already an integer. So 4 divided by (x +7) must result in an integer.

That means (x +7) has to be a divisor of 4. Wait, but x is an integer, so (x +7) must be an integer divisor of 4. The divisors of 4 are the integers that can divide 4 without leaving a remainder. So the positive divisors are 1, 2, 4, and the negative ones are -1, -2, -4.

So (x +7) could be any of these values: 1, 2, 4, -1, -2, -4. Then, to find x, I subtract 7 from each of these.

Let's list them out:

1. If x +7 = 1 → x = 1 -7 = -6
2. If x +7 = 2 → x = 2 -7 = -5
3. If x +7 =4 → x=4-7= -3
4. If x +7= -1 →x= -1-7= -8
5. If x +7= -2 →x= -2-7= -9
6. If x +7= -4 →x= -4 -7= -11

So the possible x values are -6, -5, -3, -8, -9, -11. Now, the question asks for the largest integer x. Let me look at these x values and pick the largest one.

Looking at the list: -3 is the largest, followed by -5, then -6, then -8, -9, -11. So the largest x is -3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with division, especially negative numbers, I might have missed something. Let me verify for x = -3. Let's compute (x +11)/(x +7):

x = -3 → numerator is -3 +11 =8, denominator is -3 +7=4. So 8/4=2, which is an integer. That works.

What about x=-5? (-5 +11)=6, (-5 +7)=2 → 6/2=3, which is integer.

x=-6: (-6 +11)=5, denominator= -6+7=1 →5/1=5 → integer.

So yes, all these x's satisfy the condition, but the largest is -3.

Wait, wait, but wait another second. Are there any larger x's possible? Let me think. Let's suppose that (x+7) is a positive divisor. Let's see, 4's positive divisors are 1,2,4. So x+7=4 → x=-3; x+7=2→x=-5, x+7=1→x=-6.

Wait, what about if (x+7) is a positive number larger than 4, like 8? Let's see. If (x+7)=8, then 4/8=0.5, which is not integer. So that wouldn't work. So only the divisors I considered earlier are valid.

Another way to approach this is to consider that for 4/(x+7) to be integer, (x+7) must be a factor of 4. So yeah, that's exactly what I did.

So the possible x values are -3, -5, -6, -8, -9, -11. The largest is -3.

Looking back at the options, option C is -6, D is -4, F is 3, etc. Wait, let me check the options:

Options are:

A: -1

B: -3

C: -6

D: -4

E: 1

F: 3

G: -5

H: 0

I: -2

J: 2

Wait, the possible x's are -3, -5, -6, -8, -9, -11. So looking at the options, which of these are present in the options? 

Looking:

B is -3 → yes.

G is -5 → yes.

C is -6 → yes.

The others in the options are not in the possible x's. So the largest x from the options is -3 (option B). But wait, earlier I thought the largest x is -3, which is in the options.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the problem says "the largest integer for which (x +11)/(x +7) is an integer." So the possible x's are -3, -5, -6, -8, -9, -11. Among these, the largest is -3, which is option B.

But wait, earlier in the options, I thought option C was -6, which is incorrect. So the correct answer is option B, -3.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recheck the possible divisors.

Wait, the denominator is (x+7), which is a divisor of 4. So possible (x+7) is ±1, ±2, ±4.

So x can be:

x+7=1 → x=-6

x+7=2 →x=-5

x+7=4 →x=-3

x+7=-1 → x= -8

x+7=-2 →x= -9

x+7=-4 →x= -11

So the possible x values are -6, -5, -3, -8, -9, -11. So the largest is -3.

So in the options, -3 is option B. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but looking at the initial problem, the options are A through J. Let me make sure that option B is -3.

Yes, option B is -3. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the largest integer \( x \) for which \( \frac{x + 11}{x + 7} \) is an integer, we start by rewriting the fraction:

\[
\frac{x + 11}{x + 7} = 1 + \frac{4}{x + 7}.
\]

For the entire expression to be an integer, \( \frac{4}{x + 7} \) must also be an integer. This means \( x + 7 \) must be a divisor of 4. The divisors of 4 are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4 \). Therefore, \( x + 7 \) can take the values \( 1, 2, 4, -1, -2, -4 \), and solving for \( x \) gives:

\[
x = -6, -5, -3, -8, -9, -11.
\]

Among these values, the largest integer is \( x = -3 \). Checking the options provided, \( x = -3 \) corresponds to option **B**.
