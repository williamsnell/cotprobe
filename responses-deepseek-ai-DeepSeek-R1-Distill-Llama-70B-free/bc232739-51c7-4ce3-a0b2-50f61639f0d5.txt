Question:

A young lawyer worked late at her office one night. When she finally decided to go home, she headed to the elevator, got in, and pushed the button for the ground floor. The elevator went all the way to the ground floor, but then just stopped there. The doors did not open. The lawyer tried pushing each of the buttons in the elevator and tried to use the intercom in the elevator to call for help, but nothing on the elevator's control panel seemed to be functioning. The lawyer was afraid that she would be stuck in the elevator all night. She began pounding on the doors and yelling. She started to feel panicked, hyperventilated, lost consciousness, and fell to the floor of the elevator. As she fell, she struck her head on the elevator wall, causing a large bump and bruise on her head. She was unconscious in the elevator for about 30 minutes before a security guard tried to use the elevator and realized it wasn't working. The guard managed to force the doors open and found the lawyer. At that moment, the lawyer regained consciousness. An investigation revealed that the elevator stopped working because it had not been properly maintained. The owner of the building had canceled all service and maintenance work on the elevator in order to save money. If the lawyer sues the building owner for false imprisonment, she will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because she was confined in the elevator for an unreasonably long period of time.
B: prevail, because she was injured during her confinement in the elevator.
C: not prevail, because the building owner did not intentionally cause the lawyer to be confined.
D: not prevail, because the lawyer was unconscious and unaware of what was happening for most of the confinement period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the lawyer can successfully sue the building owner for false imprisonment. Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, I remember that false imprisonment is a tort that involves the unlawful confinement of someone against their will. The key elements are that the confinement must be intentional, the person must be aware of the confinement, and it must cause some harm or distress.

In this case, the elevator stopped working because the owner didn't maintain it properly. The lawyer was stuck and tried to get help but couldn't, so she panicked and eventually passed out. She was unconscious for about 30 minutes until a guard found her.

Wait, the question is about false imprisonment. So did the building owner intentionally cause her confinement? I think the owner's action was canceling maintenance, which is a form of negligence, not an intentional act. Because false imprisonment requires intent, maybe the owner didn't intentionally trap her. 

Another point is whether the lawyer was aware of her confinement. She was conscious at first, pounding and yelling, but then she lost consciousness. So for part of the time, she was aware and distressed, but for the majority, she was out. Does that matter? I think the awareness is important because if she wasn't aware during the confinement, maybe it doesn't count as false imprisonment. But wait, she was aware initially, so that period would still count.

But wait, the building owner didn't act with the intent to confine her. Their negligence caused the elevator to stop, but false imprisonment usually requires intent. So maybe the owner is liable for negligence, but not for false imprisonment, which is an intentional tort.

Looking at the options:

Option A says she'll prevail because she was confined for an unreasonable time. But the issue is whether the confinement was intentional.

Option B says because she was injured. But the injury might be a factor in damages, not necessarily determining if it's false imprisonment.

Option C says she won't prevail because the owner didn't intentionally cause confinement. That aligns with my thought about intent.

Option D says because she was unconscious most of the time. But she was aware at first, so maybe that's not the main issue.

So I think the correct answer is C. The building owner didn't act intentionally to confine her; the confinement was a result of negligence, not intent.

The lawyer’s situation involves a claim of false imprisonment, which requires intentional confinement, awareness of confinement, and resulting harm. Here, the building owner’s negligence in maintaining the elevator caused the confinement, but there was no intent to confine the lawyer. False imprisonment is an intentional tort, and the owner’s actions, though negligent, do not meet the intent requirement. While the lawyer was initially aware and distressed, the lack of intent by the owner means she would not prevail on a false imprisonment claim.

Answer: C
