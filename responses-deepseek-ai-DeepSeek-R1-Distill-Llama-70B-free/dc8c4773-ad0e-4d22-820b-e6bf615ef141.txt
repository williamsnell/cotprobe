Question:

A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game. The fan contacted his best friend and invited him to go to the game. The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following "modified" comparative negligence statute:"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. "Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of

Options:

A: $45,000. 00
B: $50,000.00
C: nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.
D: A split judgment where the fan pays $55,000.00 and the driver pays $45,000.00
E: $100,000.00 but paid by both the fan and the driver
F: $45,000.00 but only from the driver's insurance
G: $55,000. 00
H: $55,000.00 but only from the fan's insurance
I: $55,000.00 from the driver as the fan was more negligent
J: $100,000. 00

Okay, so I've got this legal question about comparative negligence, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the situation: A baseball fan bought two tickets and invited his friend. They were driving to the game when the fan sped up to cross an intersection as the light was changing from amber to red. He was going 50 mph in a 25 mph zone. At the same time, another car entered the intersection on a red light and collided with them. The friend suffered a broken pelvis and is suing the driver of that car.

The jurisdiction has a modified comparative negligence statute, which says that a negligent plaintiff can recover only if their negligence isn't equal to or greater than the defendant's. If it's equal or greater, no recovery.

The jury's findings are:
1. The fan (plaintiff's driver) was 55% negligent for speeding.
2. The driver (defendant) was 45% negligent for running the red light.
3. The friend's damages are $100,000.

Wait, but the friend is suing the driver of the other car, right? So the friend is the plaintiff, and the driver is the defendant. But the fan's negligence is a factor here because he's the one driving the car the friend was in. So, the friend's recovery might be reduced based on the fan's negligence, but only if the jurisdiction allows for that.

Wait, but in this case, the plaintiff is the friend, who is a passenger. So the fan's negligence would be imputed to the friend? Or is the fan considered a separate party? Hmm. In some jurisdictions, a passenger's recovery isn't reduced by the driver's negligence because the passenger isn't the one who was negligent. But wait, in comparative negligence, if the plaintiff (friend) was himself negligent, that would reduce recovery. But here, the friend wasn't driving; he's just a passenger. So would the driver's (fan's) negligence affect the friend's claim against the other driver?

Wait, I think I might be getting confused here. The friend is suing the other driver, not the fan. The fan's negligence would only affect the case if the friend was also negligent, but since he's a passenger, he's probably not. Unless the jurisdiction applies something different. Wait, but the question says the friend is suing the driver of the other car, so the fan's speeding is a separate issue.

Wait, no. The fan's speeding is part of the accident's cause. So the friend is suing the other driver, but the other driver's defense might be that the fan was also negligent, contributing to the accident.

So in a modified comparative negligence jurisdiction, the plaintiff's recovery is barred if their own negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's. But here, the plaintiff is the friend, who wasn't driving. So the friend's own negligence—if any—would be the issue. But the friend wasn't negligent; he was just a passenger. Unless the jurisdiction allows the defendant to raise the negligence of the plaintiff's driver (the fan) against the plaintiff.

Ah, right! That's a key point. In some jurisdictions, if the plaintiff is a passenger, and the driver of their vehicle was negligent, the plaintiff's recovery can be reduced by the driver's percentage of fault, even though the plaintiff wasn't driving. Because the plaintiff is in the same "boat" as the driver, so the driver's negligence is imputed to the passenger.

But wait, not all jurisdictions do that. It depends on whether the jurisdiction allows for vicarious liability or imputed negligence in such cases. Let me think. In this question, the jurisdiction's statute says that a negligent plaintiff can't recover if their negligence is 50% or more. But here, the plaintiff (friend) wasn't negligent himself; it's the fan (driver) who was negligent. So does the driver's negligence count against the friend?

I remember that in some places, the negligence of the driver (if the plaintiff is a passenger) can be imputed to the plaintiff, reducing recovery. So the friend's recovery would be reduced by the fan's 55% negligence. But wait, the statute here is about the plaintiff's own negligence. So if the friend wasn't negligent, but the driver was, does that count?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify the legal concept. The doctrine of imputed negligence applies in some cases, but I think it's more common in family situations, like when a parent's negligence is imputed to a child. But for passengers, I'm not sure. Or perhaps in joint enterprise situations, but the question doesn't state that they were in a joint enterprise.

Alternatively, the defendant might argue that the fan's negligence contributed to the accident, and under comparative negligence, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by the plaintiff's own proportion of fault. But if the plaintiff wasn't at fault, only the driver was, then the defendant's argument would be that the driver's negligence should reduce the plaintiff's recovery.

Wait, I think the key here is that the plaintiff's own negligence is considered. If the plaintiff (friend) wasn't negligent, then the defendant can't reduce the damages based on the driver's negligence. Because the driver is a third party. Unless the jurisdiction allows for apportionment of fault among all parties, including the plaintiff's driver.

Wait, but in this case, the plaintiff is suing only the other driver, not the fan. So the other driver's liability is being considered. The other driver is 45% at fault, the fan is 55% at fault. But the fan isn't a defendant here, only the other driver is.

So the question is whether the plaintiff's recovery against the other driver (defendant) is reduced by the fan's negligence. But the plaintiff wasn't negligent, so the fan's negligence wouldn't count against the plaintiff unless the jurisdiction allows for it.

Wait, but the fan's negligence would be considered as part of the cause of the accident, but since the plaintiff is suing the other driver, the defendant would argue that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by both the defendant's negligence and the fan's negligence. So the defendant might argue that their liability should be apportioned, reducing their own liability by the fan's percentage.

In a modified comparative negligence jurisdiction, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their own percentage of fault. But if the plaintiff wasn't at fault, but someone else was (the fan), then the defendant's negligence is 45%, and the fan's is 55%, but the fan isn't a party. So the defendant can argue that the fan's negligence contributed, and thus the plaintiff's damages should be reduced by the fan's percentage.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the plaintiff's own negligence is what's considered, not someone else's. So if the plaintiff (friend) wasn't negligent, then their recovery isn't reduced. But the defendant might argue that the fan's negligence was a cause, so the defendant isn't 100% liable, but only 45% liable. So the plaintiff can recover 45% of the damages from the defendant.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the jury found that the fan was 55% negligent and the driver 45% negligent. So the total fault is 100% (55+45). So the defendant is 45% at fault, but the fan is 55%. So the defendant's liability is 45% of the total damages.

But wait, the plaintiff is suing the defendant, so the defendant's maximum liability would be 45% of $100,000, which is $45,000.

But the question is about the jurisdiction's modified comparative negligence. The statute says that if the plaintiff's negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's, the plaintiff can't recover. But in this case, the plaintiff wasn't negligent. The fan was. So the plaintiff's own negligence is zero, which is less than the defendant's 45%, so the plaintiff can recover.

But wait, the fan's negligence is being considered. How does that play into this? Because the fan is the plaintiff's driver, perhaps the court would consider the fan's negligence as the plaintiff's own negligence, thereby reducing the recovery.

Wait, I might have to think about whether the fan's negligence is imputed to the friend. If so, the friend's total negligence would be 55%, which is greater than the defendant's 45%, so the friend can't recover anything. But that would mean option C is correct, which says the court enters judgment for nothing because the fan was more negligent than the driver.

But wait, does the jurisdiction's law allow for imputation of the driver's negligence to the passenger? I'm not entirely sure. I think in some states, the passenger's recovery isn't affected by the driver's negligence because the passenger isn't at fault. But in others, the driver's negligence could be imputed to the passenger, reducing recovery.

But the question doesn't state that the jurisdiction follows such a rule. It only states the modified comparative negligence statute regarding the plaintiff's own negligence.

So if the friend, as the plaintiff, wasn't negligent himself, then his recovery isn't reduced. The defendant's negligence is 45%, so the friend can recover 45% of the damages, which is $45,000. So the answer would be A: $45,000.

Wait, but the friend is suing the driver, so the driver's liability is 45%, so the friend can recover that portion. So the judgment would be $45,000.

But wait, the options include option A as $45,000 and option I as $55,000 from the driver. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The statute says that the plaintiff can't recover if their negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's. But the plaintiff's negligence is zero, so they can recover. The defendant's percentage is 45%, so the plaintiff can recover 45% of the damages. So $45,000.

So the answer should be A: $45,000.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the fan's 55% is considered as the plaintiff's negligence, which is higher than the defendant's 45%, then the plaintiff can't recover anything. So option C. But I don't think the fan's negligence counts as the plaintiff's unless the jurisdiction imputes it.

In the absence of specific information that the jurisdiction imputes the driver's negligence to the passenger, I think the plaintiff's own negligence is considered. Since the friend wasn't negligent, he can recover the full amount? No, wait, the defendant's negligence is 45%, so the plaintiff can recover that portion. So the recovery is 45% of $100,000, which is $45,000.

So the answer should be A.

The question involves a jurisdiction with a modified comparative negligence statute, which bars recovery if the plaintiff's negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's. The friend, as the plaintiff, is suing the driver of the other car for damages. The jury found the fan (the driver of the vehicle in which the friend was a passenger) 55% negligent for speeding, the driver 45% negligent for running the red light, and the friend's damages totaled $100,000.

Key considerations include:

1. **Plaintiff's Negligence**: The friend was a passenger and did not contribute to the accident through his own negligence. The fan's negligence (55%) does not automatically count against the friend unless the jurisdiction imputes the driver's negligence to the passenger, which is not explicitly stated in the question.

2. **Defendant's Liability**: The driver of the other car was found 45% negligent. Under the modified comparative negligence statute, the plaintiff can recover damages proportional to the defendant's negligence, as the plaintiff's own negligence (if any) is less than the defendant's.

3. **Calculation of Recovery**: Since the plaintiff's recovery is not barred (the plaintiff's negligence, if any, is less than the defendant's), the friend can recover 45% of the total damages from the driver. This amounts to $45,000 (45% of $100,000).

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A ($45,000)**: Correct, as it reflects the proportional recovery based on the defendant's 45% negligence.
   - **C (Nothing)**: Incorrect, as the plaintiff's negligence (if any) is not greater than or equal to the defendant's.
   - **Other Options**: Incorrect because they either misrepresent the proportional recovery or fail to align with the statute's requirements.

Thus, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of **$45,000**.
