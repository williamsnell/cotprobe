Okay, so I have this question about Sikhism and where the key to liberation is found. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I remember a bit from my classes. Let me think.

The question is asking about the key to liberation in Sikhism. The options are from A to I. I think liberation in Sikhism is related to spiritual concepts. Let's go through each option.

Option A: In faith in God. That sounds plausible because many religions emphasize faith. But I'm not sure if that's the primary key in Sikhism.

Option B: Strict adherence to the Five Ks. The Five Ks are the five articles of faith that Sikhs wear. They are important for identity, but I don't think they're the key to liberation by themselves. They might be more about practice and identity.

Option C: Ascetic renunciation. I remember that Sikhism doesn't really promote asceticism. They encourage living in the world, not renouncing it. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

Option D: Yoga and physical disciplines. I think Sikhism doesn't focus much on physical yoga practices. They might do some, but I don't think it's central to liberation.

Option E: Acts of charity and service. Sikhs do emphasize seva, which is service. But is that the key to liberation? I'm not so sure. It's more of a practice than the key itself.

Option F: The community. Community is important, like the Sangat. But again, I don't think that's the key to liberation itself.

Option G: Meditation and prayer. This rings a bell. I think Sikhs believe in remembering God through meditation, like repeating the name of God. This is probably a key part of their spiritual practice leading to liberation.

Option H: Rejecting worldly possessions. As I thought earlier, Sikhism doesn't promote renunciation. They encourage living as householders, so this might not be right.

Option I: The life of the householder. Yes, I remember that Sikhs value living in the world, being part of the community, working, and serving. So the life of a householder is important. But how does that relate to liberation? Maybe through living ethically and remembering God while being a householder.

Wait, so the key is about how they live their life. In Sikhism, liberation comes from living a balanced life, working, and remembering God. So perhaps the key is in meditation and prayer (option G) and also in living as a householder (option I). But the question is about where the key is found. 

I think the primary key is remembering God through meditation and prayer. That's the central practice that leads to liberation. So the answer might be G.

Alternatively, could it be I? Because the householder's life is the context in which one practices these things. But I think the key is the practice itself, not just the context.

So I'm leaning towards G: meditation and prayer.
