Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the mean, median, and mode of a set of measurements. The numbers given are 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, and 9. Hmm, let's break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

First, let's tackle the mean. The mean is the average, right? So I need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Let's see, adding them up: 3 plus 5 is 8, plus 6 is 14, another 6 makes 20, plus 7 is 27, and finally adding 9 gives me 36. There are six numbers in total. So 36 divided by 6 equals 6. So the mean is 6. That part seems straightforward.

Next up is the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Wait, the numbers are already in order here: 3,5,6,6,7,9. Since there are six numbers, which is an even count, the median will be the average of the third and fourth numbers. Let's count: first is 3, second 5, third 6, fourth 6. So I average 6 and 6. That gives me (6+6)/2 = 6. So the median is 6 as well.

Now the mode. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the list: 3 appears once, 5 once, 6 twice, 7 once, and 9 once. So 6 is the only one that repeats. That makes 6 the mode.

Putting it all together, the mean is 6, median is 6, and mode is 6. Now I need to look at the options provided to find which one matches these values.

Looking through the options:

Option A: Mean 5.5, median 5.5, mode 3. Nope, doesn't match.
Option B: Mean 6, median 7, mode 5. Wrong median and mode.
Option C: Mean 6, median 5.5, mode none. Median should be 6, and mode is 6, so no.
Option D: Mean 6, median 6, mode 6. Yes, that's what I calculated.
Option E: Mean 5.5, median 6, mode 6. Mean is wrong.
Option F: Mean 7, wrong.
Options G, H, I, J don't match either.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the mean, median, and mode of the given dataset (3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9):

1. **Mean**: The average of the numbers.  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{3 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 9}{6} = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]

2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is ordered. Since there are 6 numbers (even count), the median is the average of the third and fourth values:  
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{6 + 6}{2} = 6
   \]

3. **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. Here, 6 appears twice, more than any other number.  
   \[
   \text{Mode} = 6
   \]

Thus, the mean, median, and mode are all 6. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: Mean: 6, Median: 6, Mode: 6**

Answer: D
