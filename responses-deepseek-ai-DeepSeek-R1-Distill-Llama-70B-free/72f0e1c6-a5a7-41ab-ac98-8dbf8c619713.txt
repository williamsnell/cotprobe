Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' Hmm, I remember that H.L.A. Hart was a legal philosopher, and his work is part of the positivist school. I think he talked a lot about the nature of law and legal systems.

So the question is asking which statement best explains why Hart made this distinction. The options are from A to J. Let me think about each option.

First, what's the difference between being obliged and having an obligation? From what I recall, Hart used these terms to differentiate between being forced to do something (like through threats or force) and being obligated because of a rule or norm that one accepts. So 'being obliged' might be more about external pressures, whereas 'having an obligation' is about internal acceptance of a rule that binds you.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: It refutes the natural lawyer's view of the role of morality in law. I'm not sure. Natural lawyers believe law is based on morality, but I'm not certain if this distinction directly refutes that. It might be more about the sources of obligation rather than morality's role.

Option B: It illuminates the concept of a rule. That sounds plausible. Because Hart's work, especially in "The Concept of Law," focuses a lot on the nature of rules—both primary and secondary. The distinction might help explain how rules create obligations rather than just obligations through force.

Option C: It differentiates between formal and substantive justice. I don't think this is right. Formal vs. substantive justice relates more to the fairness of procedures versus the content of laws, which doesn't directly tie to Hart's distinction here.

Option D: It highlights the importance of individual rights in law. Not sure. Rights are more about what individuals are entitled to, not exactly about the nature of obligations.

Option E: It clarifies the relationship between law and society. Maybe, but I think this is broader. The distinction is more specific about obligations.

Option F: It explains the nature of power-conferring rules. Power-conferring rules are a type of secondary rule in Hart's theory, like those that enable people to create contracts or wills. But does the distinction between being obliged and having an obligation relate to that? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option G: It distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations. Oh, that seems relevant. Because 'being obliged' might refer to legal obligations enforced by the state, whereas 'having an obligation' could include both legal and ethical, but wait, Hart's point was more about the internalization of rules. Wait, no—Hart's distinction is about how obligations arise from rules that are accepted as part of a system, not just external forces.

Option H: It provides a guideline for the application of laws. I don't think so. That sounds more like a practical application rather than a theoretical distinction.

Option I: It explains the role of judicial discretion in the law. No, judicial discretion is about judges' decisions, which isn't directly related to this.

Wait, back to option B and G. Hart's main point in making this distinction was to show how legal systems are based on rules that people accept and follow, not just because they're forced. So the concept of a rule is central here. Because when you have an obligation, it's because a rule exists and is accepted, not just because someone is forcing you to do it.

So option B says it illuminates the concept of a rule. That makes sense. By distinguishing the two, Hart is explaining how rules create obligations. Being obliged is more like being coerced, whereas having an obligation comes from a rule that's part of a system.

Alternatively, option G suggests it's about legal vs. ethical obligations. But I think that's a different distinction. Hart's point is more about the source of the obligation—whether it's from an accepted rule (obligation) or from external pressure (being obliged). So it's about how rules create obligations, which would tie back to the concept of a rule in law.

So I'm leaning towards option B as the correct answer.

The distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' made by H.L.A. Hart is central to understanding his legal philosophy, particularly in his work *The Concept of Law*. Hart differentiates between being externally compelled to act (being obliged) and being bound by rules that are accepted as part of a legal system (having an obligation). This distinction highlights how legal obligations arise from rules that are internalized and accepted, rather than from external coercion.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: While natural lawyers emphasize morality's role in law, this distinction does not directly refute their views.
- **Option B**: This is plausible because the distinction illuminates how rules create obligations, which is a cornerstone of Hart's theory.
- **Option C**: The distinction does not pertain to formal vs. substantive justice.
- **Option D**: It does not specifically highlight individual rights.
- **Option E**: While it touches on law and society, the distinction is more specific to the nature of obligations.
- **Option F**: Power-conferring rules are part of Hart's theory but not directly tied to this distinction.
- **Option G**: This refers to legal vs. ethical obligations, which is a different distinction.
- **Option H**: It does not provide guidelines for applying laws.
- **Option I**: It does not explain judicial discretion.

The best explanation is that the distinction illuminates the concept of a rule, as it explains how rules create obligations within a legal system.
