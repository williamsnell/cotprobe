Question:

After a party where the adults all drank alcohol, with everyone having at least six beers, they started up a game of baseball. The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?

Options:

A: Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.
B: No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.
C: No, because the host was the organizer of the party and should have had control over the situation.
D: No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.
E: Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.
F: No, because the host willingly drank the alcohol and should have known the possible consequences.
G: Yes, because the umpire was also intoxicated and could have misjudged the situation.
H: No, because the host used excessive force in a situation that did not warrant it.
I: Yes, because the umpire provoked the host by making an unfair call.
J: Yes, because the host was not in his right mind due to the alcohol.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about criminal battery and the defense of voluntary intoxication. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the scenario: After a party where everyone drank a lot, they played baseball. The host supplied the gear. There was an argument over an umpire's call, and the host, who was drunk, hit the umpire, breaking his nose. The host is now charged with criminal battery, and his defense is voluntary intoxication, claiming he couldn't form the intent to commit the crime.

Hmm, I remember that criminal battery is a type of offense that involves unlawful physical contact with another person, causing harm or offense. The key here is the intent required for the crime.

I think crimes can be categorized based on the level of intent required. There's specific intent and general intent. Specific intent crimes require the defendant to have a particular intention beyond just committing the act. For example, burglary requires the intent to commit a felony inside the building. General intent crimes, on the other hand, just require the intent to commit the act itself, without needing a further purpose.

Voluntary intoxication can sometimes be a defense. From what I recall, it's more applicable to specific intent crimes. The idea is that if you're so intoxicated that you couldn't form the specific intent required, you might have a defense. But for general intent crimes, voluntary intoxication usually isn't a valid defense because the prosecution only needs to show that you intended the act, not a particular result beyond that.

So, the question is whether criminal battery is a specific or general intent crime. Let's think about battery. Battery is generally defined as the intentional and harmful or offensive touching of another person. The intent here is to commit the touching, but does it require a specific intent beyond that?

I believe that battery is considered a general intent crime. The prosecution needs to prove that the defendant intended to make the contact, but not that they had a specific further intent. So, even if the defendant was intoxicated, if they intentionally swung at the umpire, that's enough for general intent.

Looking at the options, option B says no, because it's a general intent crime and voluntary intoxication isn't available. Option E says yes, because it's a specific intent crime, which I don't think is correct.

Other options: Option A says voluntary intoxication is always a partial defense for any crime requiring mens rea, but that doesn't sound right because it's not applicable to all. Option C talks about the host being the organizer, but I don't think that's relevant to the intent defense. Option D mentions negligence, but that's more about tort law, not criminal intent. Option F is about knowingly drinking, which is true, but the issue is the intent at the time of the act, not prior knowledge. Option G is about the umpire being intoxicated, which doesn't affect the host's intent. Option H is about excessive force, but that's more a matter of self-defense or justification, not intent. Options I and J relate to provocation and being in the right mind, which again don't negate the general intent required.

So putting it together, the defense of voluntary intoxication probably won't work here because battery is a general intent crime. The correct answer is B.

The scenario involves a host charged with criminal battery after hitting an umpire during a drunken argument at a party. The defense claims voluntary intoxication prevented the host from forming the intent to commit the crime. 

Criminal battery requires intent to make harmful or offensive contact, which is classified as a general intent crime. Voluntary intoxication is typically not a valid defense for general intent crimes because the prosecution only needs to prove the intent to commit the act, not a specific further intent. Since battery falls under general intent, the defense of voluntary intoxication does not apply here.
