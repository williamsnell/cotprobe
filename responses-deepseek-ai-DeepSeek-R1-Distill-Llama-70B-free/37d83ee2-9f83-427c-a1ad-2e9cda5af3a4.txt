Okay, I'm trying to solve this Z-transform problem. Let me think step by step. So the question is about finding the Z-transform of the unit step sequence f[n] = u[n]. 

I remember that the unilateral Z-transform is defined as F(z) = sum from n=0 to infinity of f[n] * z^-n. Right, so for each sample of the sequence f[n], starting at n=0, we multiply by z to the power of negative n and sum all that up.

The unit step sequence u[n] is 1 when n is >=0 and 0 otherwise. So f[n] = 1 for all n starting at 0. That means the sum is going to have a lot of terms, each being 1 * z^-n.

Let me write that out. F(z) = sum_{n=0}^infty (1) * z^-n. So that's sum from n=0 to infinity of z^-n. Wait, that looks like a geometric series. 

The sum of a geometric series where each term is (1/z)^n, starting at n=0. The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is a/(1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Here, a is 1 (since n starts at 0, z^0 is 1), and r is 1/z. 

So the sum should be 1 / (1 - (1/z)). Hmm, let me simplify that. 1/(1 - 1/z) is equal to z/(z-1). Wait, because let's see: 1 - 1/z = (z-1)/z. So taking the reciprocal, it's z/(z-1). 

Wait, but I thought the Z-transform of u[n] was 1/(1 - z^-1) which is the same as z/(z-1). Let me double-check that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can recall some standard Z-transform pairs. I think one of them is u[n] corresponds to 1/(1 - z^-1) in the Z-domain. Let me make sure. 

Wait, let me calculate again. The sum is sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{-n} = 1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2} + z^{-3} + ... which is a geometric series with ratio r = z^{-1}. So sum is 1/(1 - z^{-1}) which is 1/(1 - 1/z) = z/(z-1). 

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this. Let me check each option:

Option A: 1/(z-1) → that's different because we have z in numerator.
Option B: z/(1+z) → denominator is z+1, not z-1.
Option C: z^2/(z-1) → numerator is z^2, not z.
Option D: 1/(2 - z) → denominator is 2-z, no match.
Option E: (z-1)/z → reciprocal of what we have.
Option F: 1/(z^2 -1) → denominator is z squared minus one.
Option G: 1/(1 - z) → that's similar but without the z in numerator.
Option H: z/(1 - z) → that's z/(1-z) which is same as -z/(z-1), different from our result.
Option I: z/(z-1) → yes, this matches our result.
Option J: z/(z²-1) → denominator is z squared minus one.

So the correct answer should be option I: z/(z-1). Wait, but I thought the standard form I've seen is 1/(1 - z^{-1}), which is the same as z/(z-1). So yes, option I is correct.

To find the Z-transform of the unit step sequence \( f[n] = u[n] \), we use the definition of the unilateral Z-transform:

\[
F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f[n] z^{-n}.
\]

For \( f[n] = u[n] \), the sequence is 1 for \( n \geq 0 \), so the Z-transform becomes:

\[
F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{-n}.
\]

This is an infinite geometric series with the first term \( a = 1 \) and common ratio \( r = z^{-1} \). The sum of the series is:

\[
F(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
F(z) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}} = \frac{z}{z - 1}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{1}{z - 1} \) — Incorrect, as the numerator is missing.
- **Option B**: \( \frac{z}{1 + z} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator is \( 1 + z \), not \( z - 1 \).
- **Option C**: \( \frac{z^2}{z - 1} \) — Incorrect, as the numerator is \( z^2 \), not \( z \).
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1}{2 - z} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator is \( 2 - z \), not \( z - 1 \).
- **Option E**: \( \frac{z - 1}{z} \) — Incorrect, as this is the reciprocal of the correct answer.
- **Option F**: \( \frac{1}{z^2 - 1} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator is \( z^2 - 1 \), not \( z - 1 \).
- **Option G**: \( \frac{1}{1 - z} \) — Incorrect, as the numerator is missing.
- **Option H**: \( \frac{z}{1 - z} \) — Incorrect, as this is equivalent to \( -\frac{z}{z - 1} \), which is different.
- **Option I**: \( \frac{z}{z - 1} \) — Correct, matches the derived result.
- **Option J**: \( \frac{z}{z^2 - 1} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator is \( z^2 - 1 \), not \( z - 1 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: \( \frac{z}{z - 1} \)**.
