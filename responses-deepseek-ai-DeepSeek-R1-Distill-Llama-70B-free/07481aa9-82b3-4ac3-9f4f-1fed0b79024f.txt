Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of the options is not located in Nevada. Let's go through each one by one.

First, option A is the Liberace Museum. I remember hearing that Liberace was a famous entertainer in Las Vegas, so I think the museum was there. I believe it's closed now, but it was definitely in Nevada.

Option B is Pikes Peak. Hmm, Pikes Peak rings a bell as being in Colorado. I think it's near Colorado Springs and has that famous race, the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. So that's probably not in Nevada.

Option C is Hoover Dam. I'm pretty sure Hoover Dam is on the Colorado River between Nevada and Arizona. So yes, part of it is in Nevada.

Option D is Death Valley National Park. Death Valley is in California, but I think it also extends into Nevada because the park is pretty large. So maybe some parts are in Nevada.

Option E is Lake Mead. That's definitely in Nevada and Arizona, created by the Hoover Dam. So that's in Nevada.

Option F is Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. I've heard of Red Rock Canyon being near Las Vegas, so that's in Nevada.

Option G is Fremont Street Experience. That's in downtown Las Vegas, so definitely in Nevada.

Option H is Mount Charleston. I think that's a mountain near Las Vegas, so it's in Nevada.

So the only one that doesn't fit is option B, Pikes Peak, which is in Colorado.

The correct answer is B: Pikes Peak, as it is located in Colorado, not Nevada.
