Question:

A nephew brings an action against the administrator of his uncle's estate based upon a contract for services rendered in the management of his uncle's property. In order to rebut the presumption that the services rendered were gratuitous, since the nephew was a relative of his uncle, the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. The sister-in-law testified that she had lived in the nephew's house, knew his uncle, and that she was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney asked her to look at a letter and to tell the court whether it was written by the uncle. Upon objection by the attorney for the administrator of the estate, the trial judge would most likely

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.
B: sustain the objection, because the letter was not previously disclosed to the court.
C: sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law's testimony could be biased in favor of the nephew.
D: sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.
E: overrule the objection, because the letter can be considered as a document affecting the disposition of property.
F: sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not an immediate family member.
G: overrule the objection, because the Dead Man's Statute does not apply to written evidence.
H: overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.
I: overrule the objection, because the sister-in-law is a reliable witness due to her relationship with the nephew.
J: sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the Dead Man's Statute and the authentication of handwriting. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario: A nephew is suing the administrator of his uncle's estate. The case is about a contract for services the nephew provided in managing his uncle's property. The main issue here is rebutting the presumption that the services were gratuitous because they're relatives. So the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness.

The sister-in-law testifies that she lived in the nephew's house, knew the uncle, and was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney then asks her to look at a letter and tell the court if it was written by the uncle. The opposing attorney objects, and we need to determine how the trial judge would rule.

Let me recall what the Dead Man's Statute says. From what I remember, the Dead Man's Statute (also known as the hearsay exception for declarations of deceased persons) generally prevents a party from testifying about statements made by a deceased person when the opposing party is unable to cross-examine the deceased. But wait, in this case, the witness isn't testifying about the contents of the letter but rather authenticating the handwriting. So maybe the Dead Man's Statute isn't directly applying here.

Wait, but the question is about authenticating a letter. So the sister-in-law is being asked if the letter was written by the uncle. That's about the authenticity, not the content. So perhaps the Dead Man's Statute doesn't block her from testifying about the handwriting.

I think the Dead Man's Statute primarily concerns the admissibility of the content of statements made by the deceased. For example, if the letter's content was being offered for its truth, then the statute might apply. But here, it's about whether the letter is in the uncle's handwriting. That's a different issue.

So the objection is probably on the grounds that she's not an expert in handwriting, or because of some other rule. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Overrule because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting. That sounds right because under FRE 901, a lay witness who is familiar with the handwriting can authenticate a document. So the sister-in-law, being familiar, can testify.

Option D: Sustain because she's not a handwriting expert. But I don't think you need to be an expert to authenticate; a non-expert can do it if they have sufficient familiarity.

Option J: Sustain because of the Dead Man's Statute. But as I thought earlier, the Dead Man's Statute might not apply here because she's not testifying about the content, just the handwriting. So J might not be the right reason.

Wait another angle: Could the Dead Man's Statute affect her testimony about the handwriting? I don't think so. The statute typically deals with statements, not the physical act of writing. So the authentication of the handwriting isn't prohibited by the Dead Man's Statute.

So the trial judge would likely overrule the objection because the sister-in-law is competent to authenticate the handwriting. That would make option A correct.

Wait, but looking at the options more carefully. Option A says the objection is overruled because the authenticating witness doesn't need to be an expert. That aligns with what I was thinking. So the judge would overrule the objection, allowing the testimony.

So the correct answer should be A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony regarding the authentication of a letter's handwriting under the Dead Man's Statute. The nephew's attorney asks the sister-in-law, who is familiar with the uncle's handwriting, to authenticate a letter. The opposing attorney objects, and the trial judge must decide whether to overrule or sustain the objection.

The Dead Man's Statute generally prohibits testimony about statements made by a deceased person when the opposing party cannot cross-examine the deceased. However, in this case, the sister-in-law is not testifying about the content of the letter but rather authenticating its handwriting. Authentication of handwriting is a separate issue and does not fall under the prohibitions of the Dead Man's Statute. 

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901, a lay witness familiar with the handwriting of the person in question can authenticate a document. The sister-in-law's familiarity with the uncle's handwriting qualifies her to testify about its authenticity, and she does not need to be a handwriting expert. Therefore, the objection would most likely be overruled.

The correct answer is **A**, as the trial judge would overrule the objection, allowing the sister-in-law to testify about the handwriting.

**Answer: A**
