Question:

The dirt floor of theShanidarCave in the northern part of Iraq has been examined. Below the layer of soil that contained arrowheads and bone awls was a layer of soil that yielded flint tools and pieces of charcoal. When the charcoal was examined it was discovered that in 1 kg of carbon, approximately 9.4 × 10^2 carbon\Elzbar14 nuclei decayed each second. It is known that in 1 kg of carbon from living material, 1.5 × 10^4 disintegrations of carbon\Elzbar14 occur each second. Use these data to calculate when people of the stone age culture occupied the cave.

Options:

A: 6.5 × 10^4 years ago
B: 4.6 × 10^4 years ago
C: 9.4 × 10^2 years ago
D: 8.8 × 10^3 years ago
E: 5730 years ago
F: 2.3 × 10^4 years ago
G: 11,460 years ago
H: 7.3 × 10^3 years ago
I: 1.5 × 10^4 years ago

Okay, so I've got this question about radiocarbon dating from an archaeology context. Hmm, I remember that radiocarbon dating is used to determine the age of organic materials by measuring the decay of carbon-14. The cave in question is Shanidar Cave, and they found different layers. The layer below had flint tools and charcoal, which are older than the layer with arrowheads and bone awls.

So the problem gives me data about the decay rate of carbon-14 in the charcoal. I think the key here is to use the decay formula to find out how old the sample is. The decay formula I remember is N = N0 * e^(-kt), where N is the current amount, N0 is the initial amount, k is the decay constant, and t is time.

Wait, but wait, the question provides the decay rates in disintegrations per second. Oh right, because carbon-14 decays at a known rate, and the activity (disintegrations per second) depends on the amount left.

The initial activity (from living material) is 1.5e4 disintegrations per kg per second. The sample from the cave has a lower activity: 9.4e2 disintegrations per kg per second. So the activity has decreased over time.

I think the formula can be rearranged to solve for time. Activity A is proportional to the amount of carbon-14 present. So A = A0 * e^(-kt). Rearranging, ln(A0/A) = kt. So t = (ln(A0/A))/k.

But wait, what's the decay constant k for carbon-14? I remember that the half-life of C-14 is about 5730 years. The decay constant k is ln(2) divided by the half-life, so k = 0.693 / 5730 yr^-1.

Let me write down the given values:

A0 = 1.5e4 disintegrations/s/kg
A = 9.4e2 disintegrations/s/kg
k = 0.693 / 5730 ≈ 1.209e-4 per year

So plugging into the formula:

t = ln(A0/A) / k

Calculating the ratio A0/A = (1.5e4) / (9.4e2) ≈ 15.957. Take the natural log of that. Ln(15.957) is about 2.773.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate 1.5e4 / 9.4e2.

1.5e4 is 15000, 9.4e2 is 940.

15000 / 940 ≈ 15.957.

Now ln(15.957) ≈ Let me think. ln(10) is 2.3026, ln(e) is 1, so e^3 is about 20.085. Wait, but wait, 15 is between e^2.7 (around 14.88). Let me calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator step by step:

Compute ln(15.957):

We know that ln(16) is approximately 2.7726, because 2^4=16, and ln(2)=0.693, so 4*0.693=2.772. So 15.957 is just a tiny bit less than 16. So ln(15.957) ≈ 2.773.

So t = 2.773 / (1.209e-4) 

Wait, let me compute that denominator correctly. 0.693 / 5730 = let me compute that again.

0.693 divided by 5730. Let's do this in exponents: 5730 is 5.73e3.

0.693 / 5.73e3 = approx 1.209e-4 per year.

So t = 2.773 / 1.209e-4 years.

Compute 2.773 / 1.209e-4:

First, 2.773 / 1.209 ≈ 2.3 (since 1.209 * 2 = 2.418, which is less than 2.773. 1.209 * 2.3 = 2.7827, which is a bit more than 2.773, so closer to 2.29).

Wait, perhaps better to compute 2.773 / 1.209.

Let me do it step by step:

1.209 * 2 = 2.418, which is less than 2.773. The difference is 2.773 - 2.418 = 0.355.

Now, 0.355 / 1.209 ≈ 0.293. So total is 2 + 0.293 = 2.293.

So approximately 2.293.

So t ≈ 2.293 / 1e-4 = 2.293e4 years.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.293e4 is 22,930 years, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.5e4, B is 4.6e4, F is 2.3e4, etc.

Wait, I thought my calculation gives 22,930, but that's not an option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the calculation:

t = (ln(A0/A)) / k

ln(A0/A) is about 2.773.

k is 0.693 / 5730 ≈ 1.209e-4 per year.

So t = 2.773 / 1.209e-4 → let's compute 2.773 / 1.209e-4.

2.773 divided by 0.0001209.

Wait that's the same as 2.773 * (1 / 0.0001209) → 1/0.0001209 is approximately 8273. So 2.773 * 8273 ≈ let's compute this.

2 * 8273 = 16546.

0.773 * 8273 → 0.7 * 8273 = 5791.1, 0.073 *8273≈ 603. So total ≈ 5791 + 603 = 6394.

So total t ≈ 16546 + 6394 = 22940 years.

Wait, 22,940 years. But looking at the options, the closest is option J: 3.0e4, which is 30,000, but that's higher. Or option F is 2.3e4, which is 23,000, which is closer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio A0/A.

Wait, A0 is 1.5e4, A is 9.4e2.

1.5e4 / 9.4e2 = 15000 / 940 = let me calculate that more accurately.

940 * 15 = 14,100. 15000 - 14,100 = 900. 900 /940 ≈ 0.957. So total is 15.957.

Yes, that's correct.

So ln(15.957) ≈ 2.773.

Then t = 2.773 / (0.693/5730) = 2.773 * (5730/0.693) → compute that.

5730 / 0.693 = let's see. 0.693 * 8000 = 5544. So 5730 - 5544 = 186. 186 / 0.693 ≈ 268. So 8000 + 268 = 8268.

So 2.773 * 8268 ≈ let's compute 2 * 8268 = 16536, 0.773 * 8268 ≈ approx 0.7 *8268=5797, 0.073 *8268≈604. So total 5797+604=6401. So 16536 +6401=22937 years.

So approximately 22,937 years, which is 2.2937e4, which is about 2.29e4 years.

Looking back at the options, option F is 2.3e4, which is 23,000. So F would be the closest.

But wait, let me double-check: What if I used the exact calculation for ln(15.957)?

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the formula t = (ln(N0/N)) / (λ), where λ is ln(2)/half-life.

Wait, no, the approach I took was correct. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: 6.5 ×10^4

B:4.6 ×10^4

C:9.4 ×10^2

D:8.8 ×10^3

E: 5,730

F:2.3 ×10^4

G:11,460

H:7.3 ×10^3

I:1.5 ×10^4

J:3.0 ×1e4

So the closest to my 2.29e4 is F:2.3e4.

But wait, is there another way this might be computed? Like perhaps a miscalculation in the half-life?

Wait, another approach: The activity is proportional to the amount of C-14, which is N = N0 e^(-λ t).

So the ratio of activities is A = A0 * e^(-λ t).

So t = (1/λ) * ln(A0/A).

The decay constant λ is 0.693 / 5730 ≈ 1.2097e-4 per year.

So compute ln(15000/940) = ln(15.957) ≈2.77258.

So t = 2.77258 / (0.693 / 5730).

Compute denominator: 0.693 / 5730 = 1.2097e-4.

So t = 2.77258 / 1.2097e-4 = 2.77258 / 0.00012097 ≈ 22930 years.

Which is 2.293 ×1e4, so 2.29e4.

Looking at the options, F is 2.3e4, which is 23,000. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm seeing that option F is 2.3 ×1e4, which matches.

So the answer should be F.

To determine when the people of the Stone Age culture occupied the Shanidar Cave, we use radiocarbon dating. The decay of carbon-14 follows the formula:

\[
N = N_0 e^{-kt}
\]

where:
- \(N\) is the current activity,
- \(N_0\) is the initial activity,
- \(k\) is the decay constant,
- \(t\) is the time elapsed.

The decay constant \(k\) is related to the half-life (\(t_{1/2}\)) of carbon-14 by:

\[
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}
\]

The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years, so:

\[
k = \frac{0.693}{5730} \approx 1.209 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{yr}^{-1}
\]

The initial activity (\(A_0\)) of carbon-14 in living material is given as \(1.5 \times 10^4\) disintegrations per second per kilogram, and the current activity (\(A\)) of the sample is \(9.4 \times 10^2\) disintegrations per second per kilogram. The formula can be rearranged to solve for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{A_0}{A}\right)}{k}
\]

First, calculate the ratio of activities:

\[
\frac{A_0}{A} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^4}{9.4 \times 10^2} \approx 15.957
\]

Next, take the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(15.957) \approx 2.773
\]

Now, substitute into the formula for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{2.773}{1.209 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 22,940 \, \text{years}
\]

This value can be expressed as \(2.29 \times 10^4\) years. Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is:

**F: \(2.3 \times 10^4\) years ago.**

Thus, the Stone Age culture occupied the cave approximately 23,000 years ago.
