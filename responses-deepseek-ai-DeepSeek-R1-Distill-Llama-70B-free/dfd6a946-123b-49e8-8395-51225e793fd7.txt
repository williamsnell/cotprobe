Okay, so I've got this problem here about an ice cream shop selling milkshakes. Let's see, the question says they sold 48 vanilla milkshakes in a day, and that's 40% of the total milkshakes sold that day. I need to find the total number of milkshakes sold.

Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this. So, 40% is the same as 0.4 in decimal form, right? And that 40% equals 48 milkshakes. So, if I let the total number of milkshakes be some number, say, T, then 40% of T is 48.

Wait, how do I write that as an equation? Oh yeah, 0.4 * T = 48. That makes sense. So to find T, I need to solve for it. 

Let me think, if 0.4 times T is 48, then T must be 48 divided by 0.4. Let me do that calculation. 48 divided by 0.4... Hmm, 0.4 goes into 48 how many times? Well, 0.4 times 100 is 40, which is less than 48. 0.4 times 120 is 48 because 0.4*100=40 and 0.4*20=8, so 40+8=48. Oh wait, no, wait, 0.4 times 120 would be 48? Let me check that. 0.4 * 120: 0.4 * 100 is 40, 0.4 * 20 is 8. So 40 + 8 is indeed 48. So T equals 120.

So the total number of milkshakes sold that day is 120. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches. Let's see the options are A:100, B:80, C:130, D:72, E:150, F:60, G:120, H:90, I:108, J:200. So option G is 120, which is the answer.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 40% of 120 should be 48. Let's calculate 10% of 120 is 12, so 40% is 4 times that, which is 48. Yep, that checks out. So I'm confident that G is the correct answer.

The ice cream shop sold 48 vanilla milkshakes, which represents 40% of the total milkshakes sold. To find the total number of milkshakes (T), we set up the equation:

\[ 0.4 \times T = 48 \]

Solving for T:

\[ T = \frac{48}{0.4} = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of milkshakes sold is 120, which corresponds to option G.
