Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking which country is actively trying to preserve the purity of their native language from contamination by English or other languages. The options are A through F: Brazil, Australia, Japan, United States, India, and South Africa.

Hmm, I remember that different countries have different approaches to language preservation. Some might be more proactive about keeping their language pure, while others might be more open to adopting foreign words, especially from English due to globalization.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: Brazil. Brazil speaks Portuguese, right? I think Brazil is pretty open to incorporating foreign words, especially from English, because of technology and globalization. I don't recall Brazil being particularly strict about language purity. They might have some efforts, but I'm not sure it's a major focus.

Option B: Australia. Australia is an English-speaking country, so their main language is English. But wait, the question is about preserving a native language from English. So if the country's main language is English, then it's probably not trying to protect another native language from English. Unless they're talking about indigenous languages, but I don't think that's the case here. The question seems to refer to the predominant national language.

Option C: Japan. Japan uses Japanese as their national language. I remember that Japan has a tendency to borrow English words, especially in technology and modern contexts. Words like "email" become "emaeru" or something similar. But wait, I've also heard that there are efforts to preserve the Japanese language. For example, there's a tendency to use Japanese terms instead of directly borrowing English. Maybe they have language policies or organizations that work on maintaining the purity of Japanese. I think the Japanese government has an agency or something that promotes the use of correct Japanese and limits the influence of foreign languages. So this might be the correct answer.

Option D: United States. The U.S. doesn't have an official language at the federal level, but English is the most widely spoken. I don't think the U.S. is actively trying to preserve English purity. In fact, American English is known for borrowing words from other languages, especially Spanish, given the large Hispanic population. So the U.S. probably isn't the one trying to keep their language pure from others.

Option E: India. India has many official languages, with Hindi and English being prominent. I don't think India is trying to keep their languages pure. In fact, Indian languages have a lot of loanwords, especially from English due to colonial history. Plus, India is a linguistically diverse country with many languages coexisting, so they might not have a single policy on purity.

Option F: South Africa. South Africa has several official languages, including English, Afrikaans, isiZulu, etc. They promote multilingualism, so I don't think they're focused on keeping one language pure. Instead, they encourage the use and development of all their official languages, which includes protecting them, but not necessarily from English influences.

So, putting it all together. The country that's actively preserving their native language's purity is likely Japan. I remember reading that Japan sometimes replaces English loanwords with Japanese equivalents. For example, instead of using "personal computer," they might use "pasokon," which is a direct borrowing but also integrated into the language. However, I think they have conscious efforts to maintain the purity, maybe through language planning or cultural policies.

Wait, but some might argue that France is known for this, with their Académie Française, but France isn't one of the options here. So among the options given, Japan fits the description best.

The country actively trying to preserve the purity of their native language from contamination by English or other languages is Japan. Japan has efforts in place to maintain the integrity of the Japanese language, including using Japanese terms instead of borrowing from English and promoting correct usage through cultural and language policies.
