Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about air being compressed polytropically, and we need to find the heat transferred per kilogram of air during this process.

Alright, the given data: initial pressure P1 is 1 bar, initial temperature T1 is 17°C. The compression is polytropic with n = 1.30, and the final pressure P2 is 5 bars. We need to find the heat transfer per kg, so I think we're looking for q, the specific heat transfer.

I remember that for a polytropic process, the relation between P and V is given by P V^n = constant. Also, the formula for heat transfer in a polytropic process is q = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (n - 1), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of specific heat and temperatures.

Alternatively, the formula for the specific heat transfer in a polytropic process is q = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me recall the formula correctly.

Oh right, the specific heat transfer for a polytropic process can be calculated using the equation q = (R (T2 - T1)) / (1 - n) ), where R is the specific gas constant. Or maybe it's another formula... Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Since it's a polytropic process, the relation between T and P is T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2)^( (n-1)/n ). So I can find T2 using this equation. Once I have T2, I can find the change in internal energy, ΔU, which is specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature, multiplied by the mass. Then, since the first law of thermodynamics states that Q = ΔU + W, but in this case, Q is the heat transfer, and work done is involved.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer in a polytropic process of an ideal gas. The formula I found before is q = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ) * (1/m), but that's getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, I think the specific heat transfer (per unit mass) can be found using the formula q = (R/(γ - 1)) (T2 - T1) * (γ - n)/(n - 1) )... Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Let me think again. For a polytropic process, PV^n = constant. So the process is described by P V^n = P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n.

We can find the relation between T1 and T2. Since PV = nRT, for an ideal gas. Wait, for ideal gas, PV = m R T, where R is the specific gas constant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a step-by-step approach.

1. Find the final temperature T2.

Using the polytropic relation between T and P:

(T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1)^( (n-1)/n )

Given P2 =5 bar, P1=1 bar, n=1.30.

So (5/1)^(0.3/1.3) =5^(0.3/1.3). Let me compute that exponent: 0.3/1.3 ≈ 0.23077.

So 5^0.23077. Let me calculate that. Let me think, 5^0.23. Hmm, I know that 5^0.2 is about 1.38, 5^0.3 is about 1.62. Approximately, maybe around 1.5. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 5^0.23077 = e^(0.23077 * ln5). ln5 is approximately 1.6094. So 0.23077 * 1.6094 ≈ 0.3715. e^0.3715 ≈ 1.45. So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.45.

T1 is 17°C, which is 290.15 K. So T2 ≈290.15 *1.45 ≈420.47 K.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 0.23077 *1.6094 = roughly 0.23077 *1.6 is about 0.3692. e^0.3692 is approx 1.446. So 290.15 * 1.446 = let's compute that.

290 *1.4 is 406, 290 *0.046 is about 13.34. So total around 419.34 K. So T2 is approximately 419.34 K.

2. Calculate the change in internal energy per unit mass. For an ideal gas, ΔU = c_v (T2 - T1), where c_v is the specific heat at constant volume.

But wait, what's the value of c_v for air? I recall that for diatomic gases like air, c_v is approximately 20.78 J/mol·K, but wait, that's molar specific heat. Oh wait, but for specific gas constant R, R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between c_p and c_v. For diatomic gases, γ = c_p/c_v ≈ 1.4. So if I can find c_v in terms of R.

Wait, for air, the specific gas constant R is 287 J/kg·K. Because R = 8.314 / M, where M is molar mass. Air's molar mass is about 28.97 g/mol, so 0.02897 kg/mol. So R = 8.314 / 0.02897 ≈287 J/kg·K.

And γ for air is about 1.4. So γ = c_p / c_v → 1.4 = c_p / c_v → c_p = 1.4 c_v.

Also, c_p - c_v = R → 1.4 c_v - c_v = R → 0.4 c_v = 287 → c_v = 287 / 0.4 = 717.5 J/kg·K.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 287 divided by 0.4 is 717.5? Wait, 0.4 * 700 is 280, so 717.5 would give 287. So yeah, correct. So c_v is 717.5 J/kg·K.

So ΔU = c_v (T2 - T1) = 717.5 J/kg·K * (419.34 K - 290.15 K) → 717.5 * 129.19 K.

Let me compute that. 700 *130 = 91,000. 17.5 *130 = 2,275. So approximately 93,275 J/kg. But let me calculate accurately:

419.34 - 290.15 = 129.19 K.

717.5 * 129.19 = Let's compute 700 *129.19 = 90,433; 17.5 *129.19 = approx 17 *130=2210, 0.5 *129.19=64.595 → total 2210+64.595=2274.595. So total ΔU ≈90,433 +2,274.6 = 92,707.6 J/kg → approximately 92,708 J/kg.

3. Now, the heat transfer. For a polytropic process, the heat transfer can be found using the formula:

q = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) → but this is per kg?

Wait, another approach: the work done during polytropic process is W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (n - 1). But since work done on the gas is positive, and heat transfer is q = ΔU + W (first law: Q = ΔU + W, but sign conventions can be tricky here. Wait, let me get the sign right.

In thermodynamics, work done by the system is positive, so when the gas is compressed, work is done on the gas, which would be negative from the system's perspective. So for compression, W is negative.

Wait, first law is Q = ΔU - W, where W is the work done by the system. So in this case, during compression, the system (gas) is doing negative work, so W is negative. So Q = ΔU - W → but W is negative, so Q = ΔU + |W|.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the formula for heat transfer in a polytropic process. The formula is:

q = (c_v (T2 - T1)) * ( (n - γ) / (n - 1) ) )

Wait, I think that's the correct formula. Because for a polytropic process with index n, the heat transfer per unit mass is q = c_v (T2 - T1) * (n - γ)/(n - 1). Let me verify this.

Alternatively, another formula I found is q = (R/(γ - 1)) (T2 - T1) (γ - n)/(n - 1). Hmm, but let me make sense of this.

Wait, in polytropic process, the relation between T and P is T1/P1^( (γ -1)/γ ) = T2/P2^( (γ -1)/γ ), but perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the general formula for heat transfer in a polytropic process. The heat transfer q is given by:

q = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) → but this is the work done, isn't it? Or perhaps I'm confusing with the work formula.

Wait, the work done in a polytropic process is W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (n - 1). Hmm, if n >1, which it is here (n=1.3), then for compression, P2 V2 > P1 V1, so work is positive, meaning work is done on the system. So W would be positive in this case.

Wait, but in the first law, Q = ΔU + W, but W is the work done by the system. Wait, no, the convention can be confusing. Let me clarify: when work is done on the system, it's considered positive. So in this case, during compression, work is done on the gas, so the work W is positive from the system's perspective? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, traditionally, work done by the system is positive. So when the gas is compressed, the surroundings are doing work on the gas, so W (work done by the system) is negative. Therefore, in the first law, Q = ΔU - W → but W is negative, so Q = ΔU + |W|.

But perhaps using the formula for heat transfer in a polytropic process would be easier. The formula I found earlier is:

q = [ (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ] * (1/m) → but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, considering that for polytropic processes, the heat transfer can be expressed in terms of temperatures.

Wait, another approach: since we have T1 and T2, and knowing c_v, perhaps we can find the heat transfer using the relation involving the polytropic index.

I found that the heat transfer for a polytropic process is given by:

q = c_v (T2 - T1) * (n - γ) / (n - 1)

Let me check the derivation. For a polytropic process, PV^n = constant. Using the ideal gas law, PV = RT → V = RT/P. Substituting into PV^n = C → P (RT/P) ^n = C → P^{1 -n} (RT)^n = C → T^n / P^{n-1} = C.

Comparing to the relation for an ideal gas, T^γ / P^{γ-1} = constant for adiabatic processes. So for a polytropic process, the exponent of T is n, and of P is (n-1), so perhaps similar to the isentropic case but with n instead of γ.

Wait, perhaps the formula for heat transfer in a polytropic process is:

q = (c_v (T2 - T1)) * (n - γ) / (n - 1)

Let me plug in the numbers.

We have c_v = 717.5 J/kg·K

T2 - T1 = 129.19 K

n =1.3, γ=1.4

So (n - γ) = 1.3 - 1.4 = -0.1

(n -1) = 0.3

So (n - γ)/(n -1) = (-0.1)/(0.3) = -1/3 ≈ -0.3333

So q = 717.5 * 129.19 * (-1/3)

Compute 717.5 * 129.19 first.

717.5 * 100 =71,750

717.5 *29.19 = Let's compute 717.5 *30=21,525, subtract 717.5 *0.81.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approximate. 717.5 * 129.19 ≈ 717.5 *130 = 93, 175 (since 700*130=91,000; 17.5*130=2,275; total 93,275). So approximately 93,275 J/kg.

But since the exact T2 - T1 is 129.19, which is 130 -0.81. So 717.5 * (130 -0.81) = 717.5*130 - 717.5 *0.81.

717.5 *130 = 93,  as before, 93,275.

717.5 *0.81 = approx 581.18.

So 93,275 - 581.18 ≈ 92,693.82 J/kg.

Then multiply by (-1/3): 92,693.82 * (-1/3) ≈ -30,897.94 J/kg → approximately -30,898 J/kg, which is -30.898 kJ/kg.

But wait, this doesn't match any of the options exactly. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula for heat transfer in a polytropic process.

I found another source that says for a polytropic process, the heat transfer is:

q = (c_p (T2 - T1) ) * ( (γ - n) / (γ - 1) ) )

Wait, let me see. Alternatively, another formula I found is q = c_v (T2 - T1) * (n - γ)/(n - 1). Which is what I used before.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Let me think about the derivation.

In a polytropic process, the relation between T and P is:

T1^(γ) / P1^{γ-1} = T2^{γ} / P2^{γ-1} → for isentropic processes. But for polytropic, it's T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2)^{(n-1)/n}.

So for polytropic process, (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^{(n-1)/n}.

The heat transfer for a polytropic process can be found using:

q = [ (P1 V1 - P2 V2) ] / (n - 1) → but since we don't have V, perhaps it's better to express in terms of T.

Alternatively, another formula is q = c_v (T2 - T1) (n - γ) / (n - 1).

Wait, I'm confident that formula is correct. So let me proceed with that.

So with the numbers: c_v=717.5, T2-T1=129.19, (n-γ)= -0.1, (n-1)=0.3.

So q=717.5 *129.19 * (-0.1)/0.3 → which is 717.5 *129.19 * (-1/3).

717.5 *129.19 = let's compute more accurately.

717.5 * 129.19 = ?

Let me compute 700 * 129.19 = 90,433.

17.5 * 129.19 = let's compute 17 *129.19 = 2196.23, and 0.5 *129.19=64.595. So 2196.23 +64.595=2260.825.

Total =90,433 +2,260.825= 92,693.825 J.

Multiply by (-1/3): 92,693.825 * (-1/3) ≈ -30,897.94 J/kg → which is approximately -30,898 J/kg, or -30.898 kJ/kg.

Looking at the options, option A is -31.33 kJ/kg, which is close. But let me see if there's a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating T2. Let me recalculate T2 more accurately.

The relation is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((n-1)/n).

P2/P1 =5, n=1.3.

(n-1)/n =0.3/1.3 ≈0.23076923.

So ln(T2/T1) = (0.23076923) * ln(5).

ln(5)=1.60943791.

So 0.23076923 *1.60943791= 0.3715 (exactly, let me compute: 0.23076923 *1.60943791.

0.2 *1.6094 =0.32188.

0.03 *1.6094=0.048282.

0.00076923 *1.6094≈0.001238.

Adding up: 0.32188 +0.048282=0.370162 +0.001238=0.3714.

So ln(T2/T1)=0.3714 → T2/T1= e^0.3714 ≈1.4497.

So T2=290.15 K *1.4497≈ let's compute.

290 *1.4497 = ?

290 *1 =290.

290 *0.4=116.

290 *0.0497≈14.
