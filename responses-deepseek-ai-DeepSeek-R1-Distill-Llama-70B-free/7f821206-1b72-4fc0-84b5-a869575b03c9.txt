Question:

A defendant was charged with illegally selling arms to a foreign country without a government license. During the trial, the defendant admitted selling the weapons, which included missiles, rocket launchers, bazookas, and ammunition, to agents of the foreign country. In his defense, however, the defendant testified that he did not sell the arms as a private citizen, but rather for his employer, a federal agency. In rebutting the defendant's testimony, the government called a high-ranking official from the federal agency to the stand. He testified that if the defendant were, in fact, a member of the agency, that information would ordinarily be contained in the agency's employment records. Asked whether the defendant's employment records were on file with the agency, the official then testified, "I have searched the agency employment records diligently, but I haven't found any documentation that the defendant was employed by the agency. "Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the official's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because it shows the absence of an entry in the record of a public agency.
B: inadmissible, because it is an opinion rather than a fact.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: inadmissible, because the official's statement is speculative and not based on concrete evidence.
E: admissible, because the official had firsthand knowledge of the information contained in the agency's employment records.
F: admissible, because the official is an authoritative figure in the agency.
G: admissible, because it directly contradicts the defendant's testimony.
H: inadmissible, because the official did not personally verify the absence of the defendant's employment records.
I: inadmissible, because the agency employment records are the best evidence to substantiate whether the defendant was actually in the employ of the governmental intelligence agency.
J: admissible, as it provides evidence of the agency's standard operating procedures.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me start by breaking down the scenario. The defendant is charged with selling arms illegally. He says he did it for his employer, a federal agency. The government then calls a high-ranking official from that agency who testifies that if the defendant were employed there, his records would be on file. He searched diligently but found nothing. The defense objects, and we need to determine if the testimony is admissible.

Okay, first, I remember that hearsay is a big issue in evidence law. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. But there are exceptions. One of them is the public records and reports exception under FRE 803(8). 

So the official's testimony is about the absence of records. I think that falls under the public records exception. The idea is that if a record would normally be made and kept, the absence of such a record can be proven by someone in charge. 

Wait, but the official didn't say the records don't exist; he said he searched and didn't find any. Does that count? I think the Federal Rules allow for proof that a record was not made. Specifically, FRE 803(8) includes the absence of an entry in a public record if such a record would normally be made. 

So the official's testimony that he searched and didn't find the defendant's employment records would be admissible under this exception. It's not hearsay because it's a public record, and the absence is a recognized exception.

Looking at the options, option A says it's admissible because it shows the absence of an entry in a public agency's record. That fits with what I just thought. Option E mentions firsthand knowledge, which might be relevant, but the main issue is the hearsay exception.

Other options: B says it's inadmissible as opinion, but the testimony is factual, not an opinion. C says hearsay without exception, but we just found an exception applies. D says speculative, but the official did a diligent search, so it's based on evidence. H says he didn't personally verify, but as a high-ranking official, he's qualified to know the records. I mentions best evidence, but the best evidence rule applies when you need the original document, but here the testimony is about the absence, so it doesn't require the document itself.

So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. The official's testimony is admissible because it shows the absence of an entry in the records of a public agency, which falls under the public records exception to hearsay.

Answer: A
