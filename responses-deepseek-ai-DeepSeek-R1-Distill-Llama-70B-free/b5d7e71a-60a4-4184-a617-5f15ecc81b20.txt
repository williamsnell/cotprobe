Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about debt securities and unrealized gains or losses. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember the concepts.

The question is about Dodd Co.'s debt securities. At December 31, their available-for-sale securities have a cost basis of $24,000 and a fair value of $30,000. The income tax rate is 20%. We need to find the amount of unrealized gain or loss recognized in the income statement.

Wait, wait. I remember that available-for-sale securities are handled differently from other types. Let me recall: for available-for-sale, any unrealized gains or losses are not recognized in the income statement immediately. Instead, they go to other comprehensive income (OCI). So, the income statement wouldn't show the unrealized gain or loss. Instead, it's reported in OCI, and the balance sheet reflects the change.

But wait, the question specifically asks about the income statement. So if the unrealized gain isn't recognized there, then the amount would be zero. Because only realized gains and losses go into the income statement. Unrealized ones are deferred.

So in this case, the cost is $24k, fair value is $30k. That's a $6k gain. But since it's unrealized, it doesn't go into the income statement. Thus, the income statement wouldn't recognize any gain or loss. So the answer should be $0.

Looking at the options, option H is $0. So the correct answer would be H.

The question involves determining the unrealized gain or loss recognized in the income statement for Dodd Co.'s available-for-sale debt securities. Available-for-sale securities are unique in that unrealized gains or losses are not recognized in the income statement. Instead, they are reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reflected on the balance sheet. 

Since the income statement only recognizes realized gains or losses, and the $6,000 gain ($30,000 fair value - $24,000 cost basis) is unrealized, it does not appear in the income statement. Therefore, the amount recognized in the income statement is $0.

The correct answer is:

H: $0

Answer: H
