Question:

The city installed a sewer line across a residential subdivision. The city acquired a valid easement for construction of the sewer from the development company that owned the subdivision. One year later a buyer purchased a house within the subdivision. Unknown to the buyer, the sewer line ran across his property, approximately 10 feet beneath the foundation of his home. The deed that the buyer received from the grantor, the development company, made no mention of the easement. Ten years after the buyer purchased his house, a crack in the sewer line caused water to leak into the buyer's basement. The flooding resulted in extensive damage to his home. The city has abolished governmental immunity. In an appropriate action by the buyer against the city to recover damages, the plaintiff will probably

Options:

A: prevail, only if the sewer line was negligently maintained.
B: prevail, because the city has abolished governmental immunity.
C: prevail, because the city failed to disclose the presence of the sewer line.
D: prevail, only if the city was aware of the crack in the sewer line.
E: not prevail, because the damage was not foreseeable.
F: not prevail, because the sewer line was installed before the buyer purchased the property.
G: prevail, because under the circumstances, the sewer line constituted a public nuisance.
H: not prevail, because the deed did not mention the easement.
I: not prevail, because the city had acquired a valid easement for the sewer line.
J: not prevail, because the easement was acquired legally.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about easements and property damage. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on property law, but let's see.

The situation is that a city installed a sewer line across a residential subdivision. They got a valid easement from the development company that owned the subdivision. So, the city has the right to use the land for the sewer, even though they don't own it.

Then, a year later, a buyer bought a house in that subdivision. The buyer didn't know the sewer was there, and it's about 10 feet under his house. The deed he got from the development company didn't mention the easement. Now, ten years later, the sewer cracked, causing water to leak into his basement and damage his home. The city has abolished governmental immunity, which I think means they can be sued like a regular person now.

The question is whether the buyer can sue the city and recover damages. The options are A through J.

Hmm. So, the key points here are about easements, the city's liability, and the buyer's situation.

First, I remember that an easement is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. Here, the city got an easement from the development company, which was the original owner. So, the subdivision was their land, and the easement would apply to each lot as they're sold.

When the buyer bought his lot, the deed didn't mention the easement. But wait, in property law, when an easement benefits a public utility like a sewer, it's typically considered an easement appurtenant, which runs with the land. That means when the land is sold, the easement goes with it, whether or not it's mentioned in the deed. So, the buyer's deed not mentioning it doesn't matter; the easement exists regardless.

So the city had a valid easement, which means they were legally allowed to install and maintain the sewer line under the buyer's property.

Now, the problem arises when the sewer line cracks and causes damage. The buyer is suing the city for the damage. The city has abolished governmental immunity, so they can be sued. But does that mean the city is automatically liable, or is there more to it?

I think the next point is about the city's duty. Even if they have an easement, they have to maintain it properly. If the sewer was installed correctly and maintained properly, but it still cracked due to something unforeseen, maybe the city isn't liable. Alternatively, if the city was negligent in maintaining the sewer, then they might be liable.

Looking at the options, option A says the buyer will prevail only if the sewer was negligently maintained. That makes sense because the city isn't automatically liable just because the sewer exists; they have to have been negligent. So, if the crack was due to poor maintenance, the buyer could sue for negligence.

Option B says the buyer will prevail because the city abolished immunity. But that's not enough on its own. The city can be sued, but the buyer still needs to show that the city was at fault.

Option C says because the city failed to disclose. But the city didn't have a duty to disclose; the seller (development company) might have had that duty, but the city didn't. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says only if the city knew about the crack. But in negligence, it's about whether they should have known, not necessarily actual knowledge. So D might not be the right standard.

Option E says not prevail because damage wasn't foreseeable. I'm not sure about foreseeability here. If a sewer leak could cause basement flooding, that seems foreseeable. So E might not be correct.

Option F says not prevail because the sewer was installed before purchase. But the timing shouldn't matter because the easement exists regardless, so F is probably not the right reason.

Option G says because it's a public nuisance. A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with the health, safety, or property rights of the community. The sewer might be a public utility, but if it's causing damage, is it a nuisance? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the primary issue. The main issue is negligence in maintenance.

Option H says because the deed didn't mention the easement. But as I thought earlier, the deed doesn't need to mention it because the easement runs with the land. So H is incorrect.

Option I says not prevail because the city had a valid easement. Wait, does having a valid easement shield them from liability for negligence? I don't think so. The easement allows them to be there, but they still have to maintain it properly. So I might not be correct.

Option J says not prevail because the easement was acquired legally. Similar to I, having a legal easement doesn't mean they can't be liable for negligence. So J is probably wrong.

So, putting it all together, the buyer would need to show that the city was negligent in maintaining the sewer line. If the sewer was properly maintained but just failed due to no fault of the city, then maybe the buyer can't recover. But if the maintenance was negligent, then the buyer can prevail.

Looking back at the options, option A says prevail only if the sewer was negligently maintained. So that seems correct.

The city installed a sewer line across a residential subdivision after acquiring a valid easement from the development company. The buyer purchased a house in the subdivision without knowledge of the sewer line, which was not mentioned in the deed. Ten years later, a crack in the sewer caused water damage to the buyer's home. The city has abolished governmental immunity, meaning it can be sued like a private entity.

Key points:
1. The city had a valid easement for the sewer line, which runs with the land and does not depend on being mentioned in the deed.
2. The abolition of governmental immunity allows the buyer to sue the city, but the buyer must still prove the city was at fault.
3. The city's liability depends on whether it negligently maintained the sewer line. If the crack was due to negligent maintenance, the buyer can recover damages. If the sewer was properly maintained, the city is not liable.

Option A correctly states that the buyer will prevail only if the sewer line was negligently maintained. Other options are incorrect because:
- The abolition of immunity alone does not guarantee recovery (B).
- The city had no duty to disclose the easement (C).
- Negligence depends on reasonable care, not actual knowledge of the crack (D).
- The damage was foreseeable (E).
- The timing of the sewer installation does not bar recovery (F).
- The issue is negligence, not public nuisance (G).
- The deed's omission of the easement is irrelevant (H).
- A valid easement does not shield the city from negligence claims (I, J).
