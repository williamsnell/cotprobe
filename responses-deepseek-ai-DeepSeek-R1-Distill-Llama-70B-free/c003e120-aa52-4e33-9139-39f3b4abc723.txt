The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with burglarizing a pharmacy. The break-in allegedly occurred late one evening after the store had closed for business. The defendant was identified as the perpetrator of the crime by a film that was recorded during the burglary from a hidden camera. When the defendant was apprehended, he denied involvement in the crime and told the arresting officers that he had been out of town when the burglary occurred. Prior to trial, the defendant's court appointed attorney filed a motion requesting discovery of the videotape film that was recorded during the perpetration of the crime. The trial judge granted the request and ordered the prosecution to send a duplicate copy of the videotape to the defendant's attorney. Following the judge's ruling, the prosecuting attorney, pursuant to state law, then filed a discovery motion specifically asking the defendant whether he planned to raise an alibi defense. The prosecuting attorney also sought discovery of the identity of such an alibi witness. Assume that the judge requires the defendant to respond as to whether the defendant intends to raise an alibi defense. May the judge also require the defendant to disclose the identity of the alibi witness?

Options:

A: No, because revealing the identity of the witness might put the witness at risk.
B: No, because it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial.
C: No, because by requiring the defendant to reveal information before he is tactically ready to do so substantially impairs his ability to successfully defend himself.
D: Yes, because the prosecution should have an opportunity to investigate the merits of the alibi.
E: Yes, as long as the prosecution provides the defendant with a list of their witnesses in return.
F: Yes, because the defendant must prove his innocence.
G: Yes, because the court has a right to know the identity of all witnesses.
H: No, because such disclosure constitutes an implied representation that is testimonial in character and, thus, violates the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.
I: No, because the prosecution is not entitled to know the defense's strategy.
J: Yes, because the defendant waived any claim of privilege when he sought discovery of the film from the prosecution.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about criminal procedure and discovery rules. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question carefully.

The scenario is about a defendant charged with burglary. He was caught on a hidden camera, but he claims he was out of town. His attorney asked for a copy of the videotape, which the judge granted. Then, the prosecution filed a discovery motion asking if the defendant plans to raise an alibi defense and wants to know the identity of the alibi witness. The question is whether the judge can require the defendant to disclose the identity of the alibi witness.

Hmm. I remember that discovery rules are a bit different for the defense and prosecution. Generally, the prosecution has to disclose certain things to the defense, like exculpatory evidence, but the defense doesn't have to disclose as much unless specific rules apply.

Wait, right, there's a specific rule about alibi defenses. I think under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, if the defendant intends to offer an alibi defense, they must notify the prosecution of that intention and provide the names of the witnesses they'll use to establish the alibi. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Let me think.

So, the prosecution here is asking for both whether the defendant will raise an alibi and the identity of the witness. The judge is requiring the defendant to respond. The question is whether the judge can also make them disclose the witness's identity.

I believe that the rules do allow for this. Under Rule 12.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, I think the defendant must notify the government of an intent to offer an alibi defense and provide the names and addresses of the witnesses. If they don't, the court may prohibit them from presenting that evidence. But I'm not entirely certain about the specifics, especially if this is state law as mentioned in the question.

Wait, the question says "pursuant to state law," so it's possible the state has similar rules. So, assuming the state law is like the federal rule, the prosecution can ask for the alibi notice and the witness identities.

But looking at the options, let's see. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

Option D says yes because the prosecution should have the chance to investigate the alibi. That sounds right. If the defense discloses the alibi witnesses, the prosecution can then check their credibility, see if they have any motives to lie, or perhaps find contradictory evidence.

Option H says no because it's self-incrimination. But wait, the defendant isn't testifying here; they're just providing the name of a witness. So the privilege against self-incrimination wouldn't apply in this case because providing the name of a witness isn't testimonial; it's more procedural.

Option C says no because it impairs the defendant's ability to defend. But I think the rules are designed to prevent sandbagging the prosecution. So disclosure is required to allow the prosecution to prepare.

Option D seems correct because it allows the prosecution to investigate the alibi.

Another option is E, which says yes if the prosecution provides their witness list. But I don't think that's a condition. The prosecution is required to provide their witness list regardless, but the alibi disclosure is a separate matter.

Option J says yes because the defendant sought discovery. I don't think that's the reason. The waiver might not apply here because the defendant's right to seek evidence doesn't necessarily mean they have to disclose their defense strategy in return, except as per the rules.

So, putting it together: the correct answer is D. The judge can require the defendant to disclose the identity of the alibi witness because the prosecution should have the opportunity to investigate the merits of the alibi.

The question revolves around whether a judge can require a defendant to disclose the identity of an alibi witness during discovery. The defendant was charged with burglary and claimed an alibi, prompting the prosecution to seek disclosure of the alibi defense and the witness's identity. Under applicable rules, such as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.1, a defendant intending to raise an alibi defense must notify the prosecution and provide the names of alibi witnesses. This rule is designed to prevent surprise defenses and allow the prosecution to investigate the credibility of the alibi. 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is that the judge may require disclosure because it enables the prosecution to investigate the merits of the alibi. This aligns with procedural fairness and the purpose of discovery rules. Other options, such as concerns about self-incrimination or impairment of defense strategy, are not applicable here because disclosing a witness's identity is procedural and does not involve the defendant's compelled testimony.

Answer: D
