Question:

During spring break, a private boarding school was deserted while students and teachers were away on vacation. A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.
B: denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.
C: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to test the substance.
D: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.
E: granted, because the student was not present during the search.
F: granted, because the student's room is considered private property.
G: denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.
H: denied, because the discovery of the substance was incidental to the counselor's actions.
I: denied, because the school has a policy allowing searches of student rooms.
J: denied, because the counselor had a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the exclusionary rule and when evidence can be suppressed. Let me break down the scenario and the legal principles involved step by step.

First, the facts: A guidance counselor at a private boarding school is working late and decides to enter a student's room. He's looking to steal something valuable. He finds a suitcase under the bed, opens it, and discovers an express mail envelope. He opens the envelope, finds white powder he thinks is heroin, and calls the police. The officer takes the envelope to the station, opens it, sends a sample to the lab, which confirms it's heroin. No search warrant was obtained. The student is arrested and charged, and his attorney is moving to suppress the evidence.

The question is whether the motion to suppress will be granted or denied. So I need to think about whether the seizure and search of the envelope were lawful under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.

I remember that the Fourth Amendment generally requires a warrant based on probable cause, but there are exceptions. The key here is that the initial search was conducted by the counselor, a school employee, not the police. So this might involve the "private search" doctrine.

The private search doctrine says that evidence discovered by a private individual, not acting as an agent of the government, can be admissible even without a warrant because the Fourth Amendment only restricts governmental actions. If the police then seize the evidence, as long as they don't exceed the scope of the private search, it's okay.

In this case, the counselor was acting on his own, not as a government agent. He found the envelope and opened it, then called the police. The police officer took the envelope and then opened it again at the station. Wait, but the counselor already opened it. So the police didn't conduct their own search beyond what the private individual did.

Also, the school's status as a private boarding school matters. In public schools, school officials have a bit more leeway in searching students' property under the "in loco parentis" doctrine, but this is a private school. However, the counselor's actions are still private unless he's acting in concert with the government.

Another point: the counselor was trespassing and committing theft when he entered the student's room. Does that affect the admissibility? Wait, but the legality of the private individual's actions doesn't necessarily make the evidence inadmissible. The Fourth Amendment doesn't apply to private searches, regardless of whether they're legal or not. So even if the counselor was trespassing, if the police didn't encourage or participate, it's still a private search.

So when the police take the envelope, they're relying on the private search. The question is whether the police's actions were lawful. They didn't get a warrant, but because the search was done by a private party, the evidence isn't suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the motion is denied because the search was conducted by a private party. That makes sense because the police didn't perform an unconstitutional search; they just took evidence found by someone else.

Option J says denied because the counselor had reasonable suspicion. I'm not sure about that. The counselor was acting on his own, and reasonable suspicion might relate to whether his search was justified, but since he's a private individual, the reasonableness of his search isn't the issue. It's about whether the police's actions were constitutional.

Option B talks about in loco parentis, but that usually applies to public schools allowing searches without warrants. Since this is a private school, I don't think that applies here.

Option D says the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope. But if the envelope was already opened by the private party, the police don't need a warrant to look inside again. The evidence was in plain view after the private search.

Option A and D focus on the police needing a warrant, but under the private search doctrine, that's not necessary. The police can take the evidence without a warrant because the private individual already found it.

So the correct answer should be G. The motion to suppress will be denied because the search was conducted by a private party, and the evidence is admissible despite the lack of a warrant.

The motion to suppress the evidence will most likely be denied because the search was conducted by a private party, the guidance counselor, who was not acting as a government agent. Under the "private search" doctrine, evidence discovered by a private individual, even if the search was unlawful, does not violate the Fourth Amendment and can be admissible in court. The police did not conduct an unconstitutional search; they merely seized evidence that was already uncovered by the private individual. Since the counselor's actions were independent of the government, the exclusionary rule does not apply, and the evidence is admissible.

The correct answer is **G**.

Answer: G
