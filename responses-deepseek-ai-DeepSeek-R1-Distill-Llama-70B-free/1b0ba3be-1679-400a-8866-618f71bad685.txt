Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to compare three different numbers in binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. The question is asking me to put them in order from least to greatest. Hmm, let me think through this.

Alright, the numbers given are:

- Binary 1100
- Decimal 11
- Hexadecimal D

I remember that each of these represents the same value but in different number systems. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, each is a different number. Wait, no. Wait, no, the question is comparing three numbers, each in a different base. So I need to convert each to the same base, probably decimal, to compare them.

So first, let's convert each to decimal.

Starting with binary 1100. Binary is base 2. So each digit represents a power of 2. Let's write it out.

The binary number is 1100. From right to left, the digits represent 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, etc.

So 1 1 0 0.

Wait, let me count the digits. It's four digits, so the leftmost is 2^3.

So calculation:

1 * 2^3 = 8

1 * 2^2 = 4

0 * 2^1 = 0

0 * 2^0 = 0

Adding those up: 8 +4 =12. So binary 1100 is 12 in decimal.

Next, the decimal 11. That's easy, it's 11 in decimal.

Then the hexadecimal D. Hex is base 16. Each digit represents 16^0, 16^1, etc. D is one of the letters. I remember that in hex, A is 10, B is 11, up to F which is 15. So D is 13 in decimal.

So now I have the three numbers converted to decimal:

- Binary 1100: 12
- Decimal 11: 11
- Hex D: 13

Now I need to order them from least to greatest.

So 11 is the smallest, then 12, then 13.

So the order is: Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hex D.

Looking back at the options, let's see.

Option A: Binary, Decimal, Hex → 12, 11, 13 → no, because 11 is less than 12.

Option B: Decimal 11, Binary 1100 (12), Hex D (13) → Yes, that's the order I found.

Option C: Decimal 11, Hex D (13), Binary 1100 (12) → No, because 12 is less than 13.

Option D: Hex D (13), Decimal (11), Binary (12) → No.

So the correct option is B.

The numbers given are:

- Binary 1100  
- Decimal 11  
- Hexadecimal D  

To compare them, we convert each to decimal:  

- Binary `1100` = \(1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0 = 12\).  
- Decimal `11` = \(11\).  
- Hexadecimal `D` = \(13\).  

In decimal, the order from least to greatest is:  
**Decimal 11 (11), Binary 1100 (12), Hexadecimal D (13)**.  

Among the options, only **Option B** matches this order.  

Answer: B
