Okay, so I have this economics question here about aggregate supply and how a shift affects equilibrium. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the aggregate supply curve represents the total output producers are willing to sell at different price levels. Oh wait, the question says it's upward sloping, so as the price level increases, the quantity supplied increases too. That makes sense because higher prices might encourage businesses to produce more.

Now, the question is what happens when the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left. Shifting left means that at every price level, the quantity supplied is lower than before. So, for example, at a certain price level P, the quantity supplied would drop from Q to a lower Q'. 

But wait, equilibrium is where aggregate supply (AS) meets aggregate demand (AD). If AS shifts left, the equilibrium point must change. Let me visualize this. The AS curve moving left would mean that for any given price level, the economy can't supply as much as before. So, where would the new equilibrium be?

I think when AS shifts left, the equilibrium price level would increase. Because with a left shift, producers are less willing or able to supply goods and services at each price level. So, to reach equilibrium, the price has to go up to meet the demand. But wait, if price goes up, what happens to quantity? Since the AS curve is upward sloping, a higher price would mean a higher quantity supplied, but because the curve has shifted left, the quantity might not increase as much as before, or it might actually decrease.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me break it down step by step. Suppose the economy is in equilibrium at point E, with price P and quantity Q. If AS shifts left, the new curve is AS'. At the original price P, the quantity supplied is now lower. So, the supply can't meet the demand at P anymore, causing a shortage. How does the market adjust?

In such a situation, prices will tend to rise because of the shortage. As prices rise, two things happen: 1) The quantity demanded decreases (because higher prices mean less demand, going along the AD curve which is downward sloping). 2) The quantity supplied increases along the new AS' curve.

So, the new equilibrium will be at a higher price level and a lower quantity of output than before. Because even though higher prices encourage more production along AS', the shift left means overall supply is constrained, so the quantity doesn't rise as much as it would have without the shift. Wait, no, actually, if the price increases and AS is upward sloping, the quantity supplied would increase, but since the AS curve shifted left, the increase in quantity might be less than the decrease in demand.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let's think of it numerically. Suppose initially, at P=100, Q=100. AS shifts left, so at P=100, maybe Q=90 now. So, at P=100, there's a shortage because Qd is higher than Qs. So price increases to, say, P=110. At P=110, the Qd might decrease to 95, and Qs, along the new AS', might be 95. So the new equilibrium is P=110, Q=95. So both price increased and quantity decreased compared to the initial P=100, Q=100. 

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that higher price would lead to higher Qs. So in the shift, the equilibrium quantity actually decreased because the shift outweighed the effect of the price increase. So, the price level increases, and the quantity of output decreases.

Looking back at the options, option B says price level increases and quantity decreases. That makes sense now. So the correct answer should be B.

When the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it means that at every price level, the quantity supplied decreases. This creates a shortage at the original equilibrium price, leading to upward pressure on prices. As prices rise, the quantity demanded decreases (due to the downward sloping aggregate demand curve), and the quantity supplied increases along the new aggregate supply curve. However, because the aggregate supply curve has shifted left, the overall effect is that the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases, which aligns with the reasoning above.

The correct answer is **B**.

B
