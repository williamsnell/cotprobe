Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these mole calculations. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that the motor vehicles in a large city produced a total of 9.1 × 10^6 kg of carbon monoxide (CO) in a single year. I need to find out how many moles of CO that corresponds to. The options are from A to J, each with different values, so I have to calculate it and pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that to convert between mass and moles, I need the molar mass of the substance. Carbon monoxide is CO, which is made up of carbon and oxygen. So I think I should find the molar mass of CO first.

Carbon has an atomic mass of about 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen is about 16.00 g/mol. So adding those together: 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g/mol. That means one mole of CO weighs 28.01 grams.

Wait, but the mass given here is in kilograms. Oh right, I need to convert kilograms to grams because molar mass is in grams per mole. So 9.1 × 10^6 kg is the same as 9.1 × 10^6 kg × (1000 g/kg) = 9.1 × 10^9 grams.

Now, to find the number of moles, I divide the total mass by the molar mass. So that's (9.1 × 10^9 g) / (28.01 g/mol). Let me compute that.

Hmm, doing the division. Let's see, 9.1 × 10^9 divided by 28.01. Maybe I can approximate 28 to 30 for easier calculation, but wait, I should be more precise.

Let me write it out:

9.1e9 / 28.01 = ?

Let me compute 9.1e9 divided by 28.01. Let's see, 28 times 3.25e8 is 9.2e9. Wait, 28 * 3.25e8 = 28 * 325,000,000 = 9,100,000,000, which is 9.1e9 exactly. But wait, the denominator is 28.01, not 28. So it's slightly less than 3.25e8.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it step by step.

So 28.01 g/mol is approximately 28 g/mol. So 9.1e9 g divided by 28 g/mol is approximately 3.25e8 moles. But since 28.01 is a bit more than 28, the actual number will be a little less than 3.25e8.

Looking at the options, option J is 3.3 × 10^8, and option I is 2.8 × 10^8. Hmm, wait. Wait, my initial calculation with 28 gave me 3.25e8. So with 28.01, it's slightly less, like maybe 3.25e8 minus some small amount. So perhaps around 3.25e8, but I'm not seeing that exact number. Wait, the options don't have 3.25e8. Let me check.

Wait the options are:

A:9.1e6

B:5e7

C:8.3e8

D:4.5e8

E:7.2e7

F:6.1e8

G:1.2e8

H:1.5e8

I:2.8e8

J:3.3e8

Wait, so the closest to my calculation of approximately 3.25e8 would be J: 3.3e8 or maybe a bit lower. But let me do a more precise calculation.

Let me compute 9.1e9 / 28.01.

Hmm, 28.01 times 3.25e8 = ?

Well, 28 * 3.25e8 = 9.1e9, as I saw before. But since 28.01 is 0.01 more than 28, the result would be 3.25e8 - (3.25e8 * 0.01)/28.01). Wait, maybe that's complicating it too much. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 9.1e9 divided by 28.01.

Let me write it as 9100000000 / 28.01.

Well, 28.01 times 3e8 is 8.403e9. Wait, 28.01 * 3e8 = 28.01 * 300,000,000 = 8,403,000,000.

But 9,100,000,000 minus 8,403,000,000 is 697,000,000. So now, how many times does 28.01 go into 697,000,000?

Divide 697,000,000 by 28.01.

Let me see, 28 * 24.8 million is 28 *24.8e6 = 696,4e6, which is 696,400,000. So 24.8e6 *28.01 is approximately 24.8e6 *28 = 696.4e6, and then 24.8e6 *0.01= 248,000. So total would be 696,648,000. That's pretty close to 697,000,000. So that's about 24.8e6 more.

So total moles would be 3e8 +24.8e6 = 3.248e8 moles, approximately.

Wait, 3.248e8 is 324,800,000. Let me check the options again. The closest option to 3.25e8 is J:3.3e8, which is 330,000,000. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 9.1e9 /28.01 = ?

Let me think: 28.01 is approximately 28. So 9.1e9 /28 = (9.1/28) * 1e9.

9.1 divided by 28: 28 goes into 9.1 about 0.325 times (since 28*0.3=8.4, 28*0.325=9.1). So exactly 0.325, so 0.325e9 = 3.25e8.

But since 28.01 is a bit more than 28, the actual value will be a bit less than 3.25e8. So perhaps around 3.24e8, which is 324,000,000. Looking at the options, the closest one would be J:3.3e8 (330,000,000) or maybe another option I'm missing.

Wait, looking at the options again, option J is 3.3e8, which is a bit higher than my approximate 3.24e8. Hmm, but perhaps my approximation is off. Maybe I should do a more precise calculation.

Wait, let's compute 9.1e9 /28.01 more accurately.

Let me write it as 9,100,000,000 ÷ 28.01.

Let me perform the division step by step.

28.01 * 3.24e8 = ?

Calculating 3.24e8 *28.01.

Breaking it down: 3.24e8 *28 = 3.24e8 *20 = 6.48e9, 3.24e8 *8=2.592e9. So 6.48e9 +2.592e9 =9.072e9.

Then 3.24e8 *0.01 =3.24e6. So total is 9.072e9 +3.24e6=9,075,240,000.

Wait, but the total mass is 9,100,000,000 grams. So 9,075,240,000 is less than 9.1e9, so we need a bit more.

The difference is 9,100,000,000 -9,075,240,000=24,760,000 grams.

Now, how many more moles is that? 24,760,000 /28.01 ≈ let's compute that.

24,760,000 ÷28.01 ≈ approx 24,760,000 ÷28 = 885,714 moles. But since it's 28.01, it's a bit less, so maybe around 885,000.

So total moles would be 3.24e8 + 0.000885e8 = 3.240885e8 ≈3.24e8.

So approximately 3.24 ×10^8 moles.

Looking back at the options, none of the options exactly match 3.24e8. The closest option is J:3.3e8, but that's higher than 3.24e8. Wait, but perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I should use exact molar masses. Let me double-check the molar mass.

Wait, carbon is 12.01 and oxygen is 16.00, so CO is 12.01 +16.00=28.01 g/mol. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial kg to grams conversion. Wait the problem states 9.1 ×10^6 kg. So 9.1e6 kg = 9.1e6 *1e3 g =9.1e9 grams. That's correct.

So the calculation is 9.1e9 g /28.01 g/mol = approx 3.24e8 mol.

Looking at the options again:

Option J is 3.3e8, which is a bit higher. But maybe the problem expects us to use a rounded molar mass. Let me check what happens if we use 28 g/mol exactly.

9.1e9 /28 = (9.1/28) *1e9=0.325e9=3.25e8.

So if I use 28 instead of 28.01, I get 3.25e8. But none of the options have exactly that. So perhaps the intended answer is J:3.3e8, but that's 5% higher than 3.24e8. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise division.

Let me try 9,100,000,000 ÷28.01.

Using a calculator approach:

28.01 ) 9100000000 ( 

Well, 28.01 goes into 910 how many times? Let's see, 28*32=896, so 32 times with a remainder of 14. So 32 *28.01= 896.32.

Wait, but maybe I should approach it as:

We can write 9,100,000,000 ÷28.01 ≈ (9,100,000,000 ÷28) × (1 / (1 +0.01/28)) ).

Wait, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x for small x.

So 28.01 =28(1+0.01/28)=28(1+0.00035714).

So 1/28.01 ≈ (1/28)(1 -0.00035714).

So (9.1e9)/28.01 ≈ (9.1e9 /28) * (1 -0.00035714).

We already know 9.1e9 /28 =3.25e8.

So 3.25e8 * (1 -0.00035714)=3.25e8 - (3.25e8 *0.00035714).

Compute 3.25e8 *0.00035714= 3.25e8 *3.5714e-4= (3.25 *3.5714)e4= approx 11.6e4=1.16e5.

So subtract 1.16e5 from 3.25e8:

3.25e8 - 0.00116e8=3.2484e8.

So approximately 324,840,000 moles.

Looking at the options again, the closest one is J:3.3e8 (330 million), but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I should check the options again to see if any match 3.24e8.

Looking at the options: C is 8.3e8, which is way higher. F is 6.1e8, also higher. Hmmm. None of the options exactly match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says 9.1 ×10^6 kg of CO. So that's 9.1e6 kg. To grams, that's 9.1e6 *1e3=9.1e9 grams. Correct.

Molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol. So moles = 9.1e9 /28.01.

Let me compute this using a calculator method more carefully.

Let me write 9,100,000,000 ÷28.01.

Let me consider 28.01 x =9,100,000,000.

I can approximate x as:

x ≈9,100,000,000 /28.01.

Let me compute 9,100,000,000 ÷28.01:

= (9,100,000,000 ÷10) ÷ (28.01/10) =910,000,000 ÷2.801.

Now compute 910,000,000 ÷2.801.

Hmm, 2.801 × 324,000,000=?

Wait, 2.801 × 300,000,000=8.403e8.

2.801 ×24,000,000=6.714e7.

So 8.403e8 +6.714e7= 8.47414e8.

But 2.801 × 324,000,000=8.47414e8, which is less than 9.1e8 (wait no, 910 million is 9.1e8, 8.474e8 is less than that). So the remaining is 9.1e8 -8.47414e8= 0.62586e8.

Now, 0.62586e8 ÷2.801 ≈ approx (62586000 ÷2.801)= approx 22,340,000.

So total is 324,000,000 +22,340,000=346,340,000. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Let me try to compute 9,100,000,000 ÷28.01.

Let me write it as 9,100,000,000 ÷28.01.

Let me do it step by step.

28.01 × 300,000,000 = 8,403,000,000.

Subtracting from 9,100,000,000, we have 9,100,000,000 -8,403,000,000=697,000,000 left.

Now, 28.01 ×24,800,000=?

Compute 28 ×24,800,000= 696,400,000.

0.01 ×24,800,000=248,000.

So 28.01 ×24,800,000=696,400,000 +248,000=696,648,000.

Subtracting from the remaining 697,000,000, we have 697,000,000 -696,648,000=352,000.

Now, 28.01 ×12,557= approx 352,000 (since 28×12,557=351,  0.01×12,557=125.57 → total 351,125.57, which is close to 352,000).

So total moles are 300,000,000 +24,800,000 +12,557≈324,812,557 moles. Approximately 3.248e8 moles.

So about 3.248 ×10^8 moles. Now, looking at the options, the closest is J:3.3e8, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects rounding to two significant figures.

Wait, the given value is 9.1 ×10^6 kg, which has two significant figures. So the answer should also have two significant figures. So let me express 3.248e8 as 3.2e8, but wait, 3.248e8 would be 324,800,000, which is 3.2 ×10^8 when rounded to two significant figures. But looking at the options, I don't see 3.2e8.

Wait the options are:

A:9.1e6

B:5e7

C:8.3e8

D:4.5e8

E:7.2e7

F:6.1e8

G:1.2e8

H:1.5e8

I:2.8e8

J:3.3e8

So two sig figs would give 3.2e8, but that's not an option. The closest is J:3.3e8, but that's three sig figs. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 9.1e9 /28.01.

Compute 9,100,000,000 ÷28.01.

Using a calculator (pretending I'm doing it step by step):

We can write 28.01 × 3.24e8 = ?

3.24e8 ×28.01 = ?

3.24e8 ×28 = 9,072e6 =9,072,000,000.

3.24e8 ×0.01=3,240,000.

So total is 9,072,000,000 +3,240,000 =9,075,240,000.

Subtracting from 9,100,000,000: 9,100,000,000 -9,075,240,000=24,760,000.

Now, 24,760,000 ÷28.01 ≈ ?

Let me compute 24,760,
