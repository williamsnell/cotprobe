Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the molarity of H2SO4 in a rain cloud. Okay, molarity is moles per liter, right?

So the cloud has a water volume of 10^5 liters. That's 100,000 liters. Wait, but wait, I remember that 1 liter of water is about 1000 kg/m³, but maybe I don't need the density here because the problem gives me the volume in liters. 

The cloud is over a chemical factory that emits SO3. Each SO3 molecule bonds with one out of 10^4 H2O molecules to form H2SO4. So for every 10,000 water molecules, there's one SO3 molecule reacting. 

Wait, but I'm dealing with molecules here. I think I should convert this into moles because molarity uses moles. Oh, right, Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules per mole. So I'll need that.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the total number of H2O molecules in the cloud.
2. Determine how many of those react with SO3, because each SO3 reacts with 1 H2O out of 10^4.
3. Find the number of moles of H2SO4 produced.
4. Use the volume of the cloud to find molarity.

Wait, wait. Actually, maybe I should rephrase that. The problem says each SO3 molecule bonds with one out of 10^4 H2O molecules. So for every 10^4 H2O molecules, there's one SO3 molecule. So the ratio is 1 SO3 to 1 H2O to make H2SO4. Wait, no, because each SO3 bonds with one H2O, so each reaction would produce one H2SO4 molecule. So the number of H2SO4 molecules depends on how much SO3 is available, but wait, the problem doesn't give the amount of SO3. Hmm, maybe I misread.

Wait, the problem says the cloud is over a factory emitting SO3, but doesn't specify the amount of SO3. Oh wait, perhaps the ratio is that each SO3 molecule reacts with 1 out of 10^4 H2O molecules. So the number of H2SO4 molecules is equal to the number of SO3 molecules, but perhaps the SO3 is the limiting factor here.

Wait, but the problem doesn't say how much SO3 is in the cloud. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me reread the question.

"Each SO3 molecule bonds with one out of 10^4 H2O molecules (to form H2SO4)" So for every SO3 molecule, 1 H2O is used. So the number of H2SO4 molecules is equal to the number of SO3 molecules. But how many SO3 molecules are present? Hmm, the problem doesn't say, which is confusing. Oh wait, perhaps it's assuming that the cloud's H2O is the only thing, and the SO3 is present in such a way that only a fraction of the H2O is converted. 

Wait, maybe the ratio is that in the cloud, for every 10^4 H2O molecules, one is bonded with SO3 to make H2SO4. So the total H2SO4 molecules would be (total H2O molecules) / 10^4.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for each H2O that reacts, only 1 SO3 is involved. So the number of H2SO4 molecules would be the number of H2O molecules divided by 10^4.

So first, let's find the total number of H2O molecules in the cloud.

The volume is 1e5 liters. Wait, but 1 liter of water is approximately 1000 moles because 18 grams per mole, so 1 liter is about 55.5 moles. Wait, wait. Let me calculate that correctly.

Wait, the density of water is about 1000 kg/m³, which is 1 kg per liter. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 1 liter of water is 1000 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 55.5556 moles. So 1 liter ≈ 55.56 moles.

So for 1e5 liters, the moles of H2O would be 1e5 * 55.56 ≈ 5.556e6 moles.

Wait, but wait, let's compute that again. 1e5 liters is 100,000 liters. Each liter is ≈55.5556 moles. So 100,000 * 55.5556 ≈ 5,555,560 moles. Approximately 5.5556e6 moles.

But wait, each mole of H2O has 6.022e23 molecules. So the total number of H2O molecules is 5.5556e6 moles * 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 3.346e30 molecules.

Wait, that's a lot. But then, the number of H2SO4 molecules is that divided by 1e4, because each SO3 bonds with 1 out of 1e4 H2O molecules. So 3.346e30 / 1e4 = 3.346e26 molecules of H2SO4.

Now, to convert that into moles, we divide by Avogadro's number. So 3.346e26 molecules / 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 5.556e2 moles. So that's approximately 555.6 moles of H2SO4.

Now, the volume of the cloud is 1e5 liters, which is 1e5 L.

Molarity is moles per liter, so 555.6 moles / 1e5 L = 0.005556 M. Wait, 0.005556 is 5.556e-3 M. Looking at the options, option A is 3e-3, E is 2.5e-3, G is 1.5e-3. Hmm, 5.5e-3 is option J: 5.5e-3 M.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that's one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me re-examine.

Each SO3 molecule bonds with 1 H2O out of 1e4 H2O molecules. So for every 1e4 H2O molecules, one SO3 molecule reacts, producing one H2SO4 molecule.

So the number of H2SO4 molecules = (number of H2O molecules) / 1e4.

Yes, that's correct.

So number of H2O molecules = 1e5 L * (1000 kg/m³) * 1000 g/kg / 18 g/mol * Avogadro's number.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute the number of H2O molecules correctly.

Wait, 1 liter of water is 1000 g. Molar mass is 18 g/mol. So moles in 1 liter = 1000 / 18 ≈ 55.5556 mol. So for 1e5 liters, moles = 1e5 * 55.5556 ≈ 5.55556e6 mol.

Each mole has 6.022e23 molecules, so total molecules: 5.55556e6 * 6.022e23 ≈ 3.346e30 molecules.

Then, H2SO4 molecules = 3.346e30 / 1e4 = 3.346e26 molecules.

Moles of H2SO4 = 3.346e26 / 6.022e23 ≈ 5.555e2 moles, which is 555.5 moles.

Molarity is moles / volume in liters. So 555.5 / 1e5 = 0.005555 M, which is 5.555e-3 M.

Looking at the options, J is 5.5e-3 M. That's very close to what I got. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: perhaps the ratio is per mole of H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moles of H2O, then take 1e-4 of that for H2SO4.

Wait, that's another approach. Moles of H2O is 1e5 L * 55.5556 mol/L = 5.55556e6 mol.

If each H2SO4 comes from 1e4 H2O, then moles of H2SO4 would be 5.55556e6 / 1e4 = 555.556 mol.

Wait, that's the same as before. So 555.556 mol in 1e5 liters is 555.556 / 1e5 = 0.00555556 M, which is 5.55556e-3 M.

So again, the closest option is J:5.5e-3.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I made any miscalculations. Let me see:

Molarity = (moles of H2SO4) / (volume in liters)

Moles of H2SO4 = (1e5 L * 55.5556 mol/L) / 1e4 = (5.55556e6 mol) / 1e4 = 555.556 mol.

Molarity = 555.556 mol / 1e5 L = 0.0055556 M = 5.5556e-3 M ≈ 5.56e-3 M.

Looking at the options, J is 5.5 ×10^-3 M, which is very close. So the correct answer is J.

To calculate the molarity of H₂SO₄ in the cloud, we proceed as follows:

1. **Volume of the cloud**: The cloud has a water volume of \(10^5\) liters.

2. **Moles of H₂O in the cloud**:  
   The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, and the density of water is approximately \(1 \, \text{kg/L}\).  
   Therefore, 1 liter of water contains:  
   \[
   \frac{1000 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 55.56 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   For \(10^5\) liters:  
   \[
   10^5 \, \text{L} \times 55.56 \, \text{mol/L} = 5.556 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Number of H₂O molecules**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules/mol):  
   \[
   5.556 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} = 3.346 \times 10^{30} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

4. **Number of H₂SO₄ molecules**:  
   Each SO₃ molecule bonds with 1 out of \(10^4\) H₂O molecules. Therefore, the number of H₂SO₄ molecules is:  
   \[
   \frac{3.346 \times 10^{30} \, \text{molecules}}{10^4} = 3.346 \times 10^{26} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

5. **Moles of H₂SO₄**:  
   Converting molecules to moles using Avogadro's number:  
   \[
   \frac{3.346 \times 10^{26} \, \text{molecules}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}} = 5.556 \times 10^2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

6. **Molarity of H₂SO₄**:  
   Molarity is defined as moles per liter. The volume of the cloud is \(10^5\) liters:  
   \[
   \text{Molarity} = \frac{5.556 \times 10^2 \, \text{mol}}{10^5 \, \text{L}} = 5.556 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

7. **Closest option**:  
   The calculated molarity (\(5.556 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\)) is closest to option **J: \(5.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\)**.

**Answer: J**
