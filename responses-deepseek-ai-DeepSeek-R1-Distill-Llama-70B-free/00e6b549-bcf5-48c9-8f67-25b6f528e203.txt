Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about consanguinity and which pattern of inheritance it's strongly associated with.

Hmm, consanguinity refers to the relationship between couples who are blood relatives, like cousins. I remember that when people are closely related, there's a higher chance that they share similar genes, especially recessive ones. Because if both parents carry the same recessive allele, their kids are more likely to inherit two copies, which would express the recessive trait.

Wait, so what's the pattern here? Patterns of inheritance include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, etc. Consanguinity increases the risk of recessive disorders because each parent is more likely to carry the same recessive allele. So if both are carriers, their children have a 25% chance each time.

Autosomal recessive disorders need two copies of the defective gene. So in consanguineous marriages, the chances are higher because the couple shares a common ancestor, making it more probable they both carry the same recessive gene.

Looking at the options, option G is autosomal recessive. Other options like X-linked or mitochondrial don't fit as well because consanguinity mainly affects recessive conditions, which are typically autosomal.

So I think the answer is G: Autosomal recessive.

Consanguinity refers to marriages between close relatives, which increases the likelihood of both parents carrying the same recessive allele. This, in turn, raises the risk of their offspring inheriting two copies of the recessive allele, leading to autosomal recessive disorders. Among the given options, autosomal recessive inheritance is the pattern most strongly associated with consanguinity.
