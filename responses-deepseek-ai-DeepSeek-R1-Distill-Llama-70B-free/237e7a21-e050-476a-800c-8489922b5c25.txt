Okay, so I've got this problem here about gas effusion. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that Graham's Law is involved here. Let me think. Graham's Law relates the rates of effusion of two gases to their molar masses. Oh wait, right, the formula is (Rate1/Rate2) = sqrt(M2/M1), where Rate is the rate of effusion and M is the molar mass.

So the problem says that gas X took 112.2 seconds to effuse, and oxygen took 84.7 seconds. Both are the same volume, right? Oh wait, same volume, same temperature and pressure I suppose, so the rate is inversely proportional to the time taken. So if gas X takes longer, it's moving slower than oxygen, which makes sense because maybe it's heavier.

Wait, so the rates would be inversely proportional to the time. So Rate of X is 1/112.2, and Rate of O2 is 1/84.7. But wait, actually, since effusion rate is volume per time, if the volume is the same, the time is inversely proportional to the rate. So Rate X = Volume / 112.2, Rate O2 = Volume / 84.7. So the ratio (Rate X)/(Rate O2) is (84.7)/(112.2), because Volume cancels out.

So plugging into Graham's Law: (Rate X)/(Rate O2) = sqrt(M_O2 / M_X). So (84.7/112.2) = sqrt(32 / M_X). Because oxygen's molar mass is 32 g/mol (since O2 is 16*2=32).

Let me calculate 84.7 divided by 112.2. Hmm, let's see. 84.7 divided by 112.2. Let's approximate 112.2 is about 112, 84.7 is about 85. So 85/112 is roughly 0.75... Wait, 112*0.75 is 84, so yes, approximately 0.756.

So 0.756 equals sqrt(32/M_X). Squaring both sides, 0.756^2 = 32/M_X. Let's compute 0.756 squared. 0.7^2 is 0.49, 0.05^2 is 0.0025, but wait, I'll just multiply 0.756 * 0.756. Let me do this step by step.

0.756 * 0.756:
First, 700 *700 = 490000, but wait, since it's 0.756, multiply each by 1000 to get 756^2.

756 * 756. Let me compute that. Let's see, 700^2 is 490000. 56^2 is 3136. Then cross terms: 2*(700)*(56) = 2*39200=78400. So total is 490000 +78400 +3136= 571536. So 756^2 is 571536, so 0.756^2 is 571536 * 1e-6 = 0.571536.

So 0.571536 equals 32 / M_X. So rearranging, M_X = 32 / 0.571536.

Let me compute 32 divided by 0.571536. Hmm, 32 divided by 0.5 is 64. 0.5715 is a bit more than 0.5, so 64 divided by (something a bit more than 1). Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 32 / 0.571536. Let's see:

0.571536 ≈ 0.5715.

Let me write it as 32 ÷ 0.5715 ≈ ?

Well, 0.5715 * 56 = let's see: 0.5 *56=28, 0.07*56=3.92, 0.0015*56=0.084. So 28 +3.92 +0.084 = 31.984. Oh wait, that's almost 32. So 0.5715 *56 ≈31.984, which is about 32. So 32 ÷0.5715 ≈56.

Wait, that's interesting. So M_X is approximately 56 amu.

Looking at the options, option H is 56.2 amu, which is very close to 56. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So (84.7/112.2) = sqrt(32/Mx). Compute 84.7/112.2:

Let me do this division accurately. 84.7 ÷ 112.2. 

Hmm, 112.2 is approx 112, 84.7 is 84.7/112.2. Let's compute 84.7 divided by 112.2.

Well, 112.2 times 0.75 is 84.15. Because 112 * 0.75 is 84, and 0.2*0.75 is 0.15, so 84.15. 84.15 is just a bit less than 84.7, which is 0.55 more. So 0.75 + (0.55/112.2). 0.55/112.2 is about 0.0049. So approximately 0.7549.

So 0.7549 ≈ 0.755.

So square of 0.755 is (0.755)^2. Let's compute 0.75^2 is 0.5625. 0.005^2 is negligible, but cross terms: (0.75 +0.005)^2 = 0.75^2 + 2*(0.75)*(0.005) +0.005^2 = 0.5625 + 0.0075 + 0.000025 = 0.570125.

So 0.755^2 ≈ 0.5701. So 0.5701 = 32/Mx → Mx=32/0.5701 ≈56.18 amu.

Looking at the options, option H is 56.2 amu. So that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we use Graham's Law of Effusion, which states:

\[
\frac{\text{Rate}_1}{\text{Rate}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}
\]

Here, the rates of effusion are inversely proportional to the times taken for effusion, assuming the same volume, temperature, and pressure. Let the molar mass of gas X be \( M_X \), and the molar mass of oxygen (\( O_2 \)) is \( M_{O_2} = 32 \, \text{amu} \). The times for effusion are \( t_X = 112.2 \, \text{s} \) and \( t_{O_2} = 84.7 \, \text{s} \).

The ratio of rates is:

\[
\frac{\text{Rate}_X}{\text{Rate}_{O_2}} = \frac{t_{O_2}}{t_X} = \frac{84.7}{112.2} \approx 0.755
\]

Substituting into Graham's Law:

\[
0.755 = \sqrt{\frac{32}{M_X}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
0.755^2 = \frac{32}{M_X}
\]

\[
0.5701 = \frac{32}{M_X}
\]

Rearranging for \( M_X \):

\[
M_X = \frac{32}{0.5701} \approx 56.18 \, \text{amu}
\]

From the given options, the closest value to \( 56.18 \, \text{amu} \) is \( 56.2 \, \text{amu} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
