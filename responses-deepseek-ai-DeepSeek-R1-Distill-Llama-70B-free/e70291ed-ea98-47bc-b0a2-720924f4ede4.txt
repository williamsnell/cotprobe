Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the radius of a cyclotron orbit for an electron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotron motion has to do with charged particles moving in a magnetic field. The basic idea is that the magnetic force provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion. Right, so the formula should relate these two forces.

Wait, the magnetic force on a moving charge is given by F = q(v × B). Since the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field here, the force simplifies to F = qvB. And the centripetal force required for circular motion is F = (mv²)/r, where m is mass, v is velocity, and r is radius.

So setting these equal: qvB = mv²/r. Oh wait, I can cancel a v from both sides. That leaves qB = mv/r. Solving for r gives r = (mv)/(qB). Got it. So that's the formula I need to use.

Now, let me plug in the numbers. The problem states that the magnetic induction B is 1 weber per square meter. The velocity v is 1e6 m/s, and it's an electron, so I need the charge and mass of an electron.

The charge of an electron is approximately 1.6e-19 coulombs. And the mass is about 9.1e-31 kilograms. Let me jot that down.

So putting into the formula: r = (m*v)/(q*B). Plugging the numbers: (9.1e-31 kg * 1e6 m/s) / (1.6e-19 C * 1 Wb/m²).

Let me compute the numerator first. 9.1e-31 multiplied by 1e6 is 9.1e-25. Then the denominator is 1.6e-19. So 9.1e-25 divided by 1.6e-19.

Wait, 9.1 / 1.6 is approximately 5.6875. And the exponents: 1e-25 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-6. So multiplying those parts together: 5.6875e-6 meters. Let me write that as 5.6875e-6 m.

Looking at the options, the closest one would be... Let's see the options again. Option H is 5.7e-6 m. That's very close to my calculation. But wait, did I make any errors in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. Did I get the mass and charge right? Yes, electron charge is 1.6e-19 C, mass is 9.1e-31 kg. And B is 1, v is 1e6. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in these formulas, the charge is the absolute value, but since the electron is negative, the direction would matter for the force direction, but not the magnitude of the radius. So the radius calculation is correct.

Hmm, but let me compute the numbers more precisely. Let's compute 9.1e-31 * 1e6 = 9.1e-25. Then 1.6e-19 is the denominator. 9.1 / 1.6 is exactly 5.6875? Let me compute that: 1.6 * 5 is 8, which leaves 1.1 (since 9.1-8=1.1). 1.6 * 0.6875 is 1.1 (because 0.6875 * 1.6 = 1.1). So yes, 5.6875. So 5.6875e-6 is approximately 5.69e-6 meters.

Looking back at the options, option H is 5.7e-6. That's the closest. But wait, maybe I should check if I missed any constants or factors. Let me think about the formula again. Oh wait, did I forget to account for the direction or any other factors? No, the formula is correct. The charge is in coulombs, B in tesla (which is the same as Wb/m²), velocity in m/s, mass in kg. The units should work out to meters.

So the radius should be approximately 5.7e-6 meters, which is option H. But let me look again. Wait, option H is 5.7e-6 m. So that's the answer.

To determine the radius of the cyclotron orbit (gyroradius) for an electron moving in a magnetic field, we use the formula:

\[
r = \frac{mv}{qB}
\]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the electron (\( 1 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( q \) is the charge of the electron (\( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)),
- \( B \) is the magnetic induction (\( 1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the numerator
\[
mv = (9.1 \times 10^{-31}) \times (1 \times 10^6) = 9.1 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
\[
qB = (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \times (1) = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C·Wb/m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the radius
\[
r = \frac{9.1 \times 10^{-25}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 5.6875 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated radius (\( 5.6875 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)) is closest to option **H: \( 5.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**.

Thus, the final answer is:

**H: \( 5.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**.
