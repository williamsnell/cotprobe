Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric charges and forces. Let me read it again.

The setup is that there are two point charges on the x-axis. One is +6.0 μC at x=8.0 meters, and the other is -4.0 μC at x=16 meters. The question is asking what charge must be placed at x=24 meters so that any charge placed at the origin (x=0) experiences no electrostatic force.

Hmm, right. So the origin is where another charge, let's say q, is placed. We need the net force on q to be zero. Since the force is due to the electric fields from the other charges, the net electric field at the origin from all three charges must be zero.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, each of the three charges will create an electric field at the origin, but the force on q is the sum of these fields multiplied by q. Since q can be any charge, the only way for the force to be zero is if the sum of the electric fields from the three charges is zero. Because F = qE, so if E is zero, F is zero regardless of q.

So, I need to calculate the electric fields at the origin due to each of the three charges (the existing two and the one we're placing at 24 m) and set their sum to zero.

Let me recall Coulomb's law for electric field. The electric field E due to a point charge Q is E = kQ / r², where r is the distance from Q to the point, and k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99e9 N·m²/C²). The direction matters too: the field points away from positive charges and towards negative ones.

So, the origin is at x=0. The charges are at x=8, x=16, and x=24. So, the distances from each charge to the origin are 8 m, 16 m, and 24 m respectively.

Let me denote the charge at 24 m as Q3. We need to find Q3 such that the sum of the electric fields from Q1 (+6 μC at 8m), Q2 (-4 μC at 16m), and Q3 (at 24m) is zero at the origin.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the directions. The electric field from Q1 at the origin: since Q1 is positive, the field points away from Q1. So, from Q1 at x=8, the field at origin points towards the left, because the origin is to the left of Q1. So E1 is to the left, which would be in the negative x-direction.

Similarly, Q2 is -4 μC at x=16. So, the field at origin is towards Q2 because it's negative. So the field points to the right (since origin is left of Q2), so E2 is to the right, positive x-direction.

Q3 is at x=24. Let's say it's positive; then the field at origin points away from Q3. Because Q3 is to the right of the origin, the field points further to the right. If Q3 is negative, the field would point towards it, so to the left.

Now, the sum of E1 + E2 + E3 must be zero.

So, let's write the expressions for each E.

E1 is due to Q1: E1 = k * Q1 / r1². r1 is 8 m. Since E1 points to the left, it's negative (assuming positive is to the right). So E1 = -k * (6e-6 C) / (8)^2.

Similarly, E2 is due to Q2: E2 = k * Q2 / r2². r2 is 16 m. Q2 is -4e-6 C, so the field points towards Q2, which is to the right. So E2 is positive. So E2 = k * (-4e-6 C) / (16)^2 * (1) because direction is right. Wait, no. Wait, the sign of the charge affects the direction. The formula for E is E = (k Q) / r² * r_hat. So for Q2, which is negative, the field at origin is towards Q2, which is to the right. So E2 is positive.

Wait, let me clarify. The electric field from Q2 at origin is in the positive x-direction because Q2 is negative, so field points toward it, which is to the right.

So E2 is positive: E2 = k * (4e-6 C) / (16^2) * (1) because direction is positive.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the charge is negative, so the field is in the direction opposite to that if it were positive. So when Q is positive, field is away, so from Q1 (positive), field at origin is to the left. For Q2 (negative), field at origin is to the right. So E1 is negative, E2 is positive.

Now, E3 is due to Q3 at x=24. The field it creates at origin depends on the sign of Q3. If Q3 is positive, the field points away, so to the right (positive). If Q3 is negative, field points to the left (negative).

So E3 is either positive or negative depending on Q3's sign.

So, sum E1 + E2 + E3 = 0.

Let me compute each term.

First, compute E1:

E1 = -k * (6e-6 C) / (8^2) 

E1 = -k * 6e-6 / 64 

Similarly, E2 = +k * (4e-6) / (16^2) 

Because the negative sign of Q2 makes the field point to the right, so E2 is positive.

Wait no, wait. The formula for E is E = k Q / r² * direction. So for Q2, which is negative, the direction is towards Q2, which is to the right. So the E2 vector is positive, and the magnitude is (k * |Q2| ) / r².

So E2 = (k * 4e-6) / (16)^2.

Similarly, E3 will be (k * Q3) / (24)^2, but the sign will depend on Q3. Because if Q3 is positive, the field points away (to the right, positive). If negative, field points to the left (negative).

So, E3 = (k * Q3) / (24)^2. Wait, no: the field direction is determined by the sign of Q3. So E3 is (k * Q3) / (24)^2, but considering direction: if Q3 is positive, E3 is positive (to the right), if negative, E3 is negative (to the left).

Wait, but in the equation, the sum of E1, E2, E3 must be zero.

So:

E1 + E2 + E3 = 0

Which is:

[ -k * 6e-6 / 8² ] + [ k * 4e-6 / 16² ] + [ k * Q3 / 24² ] = 0

We can factor out k and e-6 (since all terms are in terms of microcoulombs), and then solve for Q3.

Let me compute each term.

Compute each term as a numerical value, then solve.

Let me compute each term without the constants first.

Term1: -6e-6 / 8² = -6e-6 / 64 = - (6/64) e-6 = - (3/32) e-6.

Term2: 4e-6 / (16)^2 = 4e-6 / 256 = (4/256) e-6 = (1/64) e-6.

Term3: Q3 * (1/(24^2)) = Q3 * (1/576) ; but since E3 is k * Q3 / (24)^2, the sign is included in Q3.

So putting them together:

(-3e-6/32) + (1e-6/64) + (Q3 * e-6 / 576 ) = 0

Wait, but I think it's better to factor out the constants.

Let me write all terms in terms of e-6, and factor out k and e-6:

k * e-6 [ (-6/(8^2)) + (4/(16^2)) + (Q3/(24^2)) ) ] = 0.

Since k and e-6 are not zero, the term inside the brackets must be zero.

So,

(-6/(8^2)) + (4/(16^2)) + (Q3/(24^2)) ) = 0.

Let me compute each fraction:

6/(8^2) = 6/64 = 3/32 ≈ 0.09375.

But since it's negative, it's -3/32.

4/(16^2) = 4/256 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625.

So,

-3/32 + 1/64 + Q3/(576) = 0.

Let me find a common denominator to combine these fractions. Let's see, denominators are 32,64,576.

The least common multiple is 576.

So, convert each term:

-3/32 = (-3 * 18) / 576 = -54/576.

1/64 = (9)/576.

So,

-54/576 + 9/576 + Q3/576 = 0.

Adding the first two terms:

(-54 +9 )= -45 → -45/576 + Q3/576 = 0.

So,

(-45 + Q3) / 576 = 0.

Which implies,

-45 + Q3 = 0 → Q3 = 45.

Wait, but that would make Q3 positive 45 μC. Let me check the math.

Wait, let me recompute the fractions carefully.

Wait, 6/(8²) is 6/64 = 3/32.

So,

-3/32 is equal to - (3 * 18) / (32 *18 )= -54/576.

Similarly, 4/(16^2) is 4/256 = 1/64 → which is 9/576.

So,

-54/576 + 9/576 = (-54 +9)/576 = (-45)/576.

So,

-45/576 + Q3/576 = 0 → (-45 + Q3) = 0 → Q3 =45.

So, Q3 must be +45 μC.

Looking back at the options, option G is +45 μC.

So the correct answer should be G.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the charge \( Q_3 \) that must be placed at \( x = 24 \, \mathrm{m} \) such that the net electric field at the origin (\( x = 0 \)) is zero. This ensures that any charge placed at the origin will experience no electrostatic force.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Electric Field Contributions**:  
   The electric field at the origin is due to three charges:  
   - \( Q_1 = +6.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \) at \( x = 8.0 \, \mathrm{m} \),  
   - \( Q_2 = -4.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \) at \( x = 16 \, \mathrm{m} \),  
   - \( Q_3 \) (unknown) at \( x = 24 \, \mathrm{m} \).  

   The electric field due to a point charge is given by:  
   \[
   E = \frac{k |Q|}{r^2}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \), \( Q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the point of interest.

2. **Direction of Electric Fields**:  
   - The field due to \( Q_1 \) (\( E_1 \)) points to the left (negative \( x \)-direction) because \( Q_1 \) is positive, and the origin is to the left of \( Q_1 \).  
   - The field due to \( Q_2 \) (\( E_2 \)) points to the right (positive \( x \)-direction) because \( Q_2 \) is negative, and the field points toward the charge.  
   - The field due to \( Q_3 \) (\( E_3 \)) depends on the sign of \( Q_3 \). If \( Q_3 \) is positive, \( E_3 \) points to the right; if \( Q_3 \) is negative, \( E_3 \) points to the left.

3. **Net Electric Field at the Origin**:  
   The net electric field at the origin must be zero:  
   \[
   E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 0
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for each field:  
   \[
   -\frac{k (6.0 \times 10^{-6})}{8^2} + \frac{k (4.0 \times 10^{-6})}{16^2} + \frac{k Q_3}{24^2} = 0
   \]  
   Factoring out \( k \) and \( 10^{-6} \):  
   \[
   -\frac{6.0}{64} + \frac{4.0}{256} + \frac{Q_3}{576} = 0
   \]  

4. **Simplify the Equation**:  
   Convert all terms to a common denominator (576):  
   \[
   -\frac{54}{576} + \frac{9}{576} + \frac{Q_3}{576} = 0
   \]  
   Combine terms:  
   \[
   -\frac{45}{576} + \frac{Q_3}{576} = 0
   \]  
   Solving for \( Q_3 \):  
   \[
   Q_3 = 45 \, \mu\mathrm{C}
   \]  

5. **Determine the Sign of \( Q_3 \)**:  
   Since \( Q_3 \) is positive, the electric field \( E_3 \) points to the right, ensuring the net electric field at the origin cancels out.

### Final Answer:
The charge \( Q_3 \) that must be placed at \( x = 24 \, \mathrm{m} \) is \( +45 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \).  

**Correct Option: G**
