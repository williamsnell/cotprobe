Question:

A watch manufacturer has an agreement with a watch wholesaler in which the wholesaler agrees to purchase all of the watches made each month by the manufacturer, within an estimated number of 1000 to 1500 watches per month. Although the agreement worked well at 1,000 watches per month, the manufacturer expanded its plant capacity and produced 2500 watches per month. The wholesaler could no longer pay for that volume of watches. The manufacturer sued the wholesaler to compel it to buy its full output each month as required by the contract. will the court likely grant the manufacturer's request?

Options:

A: Yes, a doubling of the output contract in these circumstances meets a good faith standard and is reasonable.
B: No, because the expansion is a disproportionate increase in product that exceeds contractual estimates and cannot be handled by the buyer.
C: No, because the manufacturer should have consulted with the wholesaler before increasing production.
D: Yes, because the manufacturer has the right to increase production as it sees fit.
E: Yes, because doubling the size of the output contract is not unreasonable and is only 500 more the top estimated limit.
F: No, because the wholesaler has the right to reject any amount that exceeds the estimated number.
G: Yes, because the contract does not specify a maximum production limit.
H: No, because a change of more than 10% is considered to be unreasonable and the basis for a breach of contract.
I: Yes, because the agreement states the wholesaler will purchase all watches made each month.
J: No, because the wholesaler cannot be expected to buy more than the estimated amount agreed upon.

Okay, so I need to figure out this contract law question. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is about a watch manufacturer and a wholesaler who have an agreement. The wholesaler agrees to buy all the watches the manufacturer makes each month. The estimated number is between 1000 to 1500 watches per month. 

Initially, everything worked well when the manufacturer was producing 1000 watches a month. But then the manufacturer expanded their plant capacity and started producing 2500 watches monthly. The wholesaler couldn't handle paying for that increased volume. So the manufacturer sued to force the wholesaler to buy all the watches as per the contract.

The question is whether the court will grant the manufacturer's request. The options are from A to J.

I remember that contracts often require good faith and that parties should act in a way that's reasonable and not undermine the other party's expectations. Also, the concept of "output contracts" comes into play here. An output contract is where a buyer agrees to purchase all the output of a seller. But I think there's a limit based on reasonableness and good faith.

In this case, the original agreement was an estimate of 1000 to 1500 watches. The manufacturer more than doubled their production to 2500. That's a significant increase beyond the upper limit of the estimate. So the wholesaler probably didn't agree to such a high number. 

Looking at the options, option B says no because the expansion is a disproportionate increase beyond the contractual estimates and the buyer can't handle it. That makes sense because 2500 is way above the 1500 max estimate. So the manufacturer might be acting in bad faith by increasing production so much without considering the wholesaler's capacity.

Option A suggests the doubling is reasonable and meets good faith. But I don't think doubling is reasonable here because it exceeds the upper limit. So A is probably wrong.

Option C says the manufacturer should have consulted first. While that's a good practice, I'm not sure if the contract requires that. The issue is more about whether the increase is within the bounds of the contract.

Option D says the manufacturer can increase as they see fit. But that doesn't consider the wholesaler's ability to buy. So D is probably not correct.

Option E says doubling isn't unreasonable and is only 500 over the top estimate. Wait, 2500 is actually 1000 over 1500. So E's reasoning is flawed because 2500 is way beyond 1500. So E is incorrect.

Option F says the wholesaler can reject amounts exceeding the estimate. That sounds plausible because the contract had an estimated range. But I'm not sure if the contract allows the wholesaler to reject or if they must buy all regardless. 

Option G says yes because there's no max limit. But the contract does have an estimated range, so G might not apply.

Option H mentions a 10% change being unreasonable. 2500 is a 66% increase from 1500, which is way more than 10%, so H could be a valid reason, but I'm not sure if that's a standard rule. Maybe it's more about reasonableness rather than a fixed percentage.

Option I says yes because the wholesaler agreed to buy all watches. But if the manufacturer's increase is unreasonable, the wholesaler might not be obligated. So I is probably wrong.

Option J says no because the wholesaler can't be expected to buy beyond the estimate. That aligns with the idea that the manufacturer exceeded the agreed range without justification, so J seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought B was the answer. Let me think again. The contract was for an estimated 1000-1500. So the actual output is supposed to be around that. 2500 is outside that range. So the manufacturer's demand is beyond what was estimated. 

In contract law, when there's an output contract, the quantity isn't fixed but is determined by the seller's output. However, the buyer isn't obligated to buy an unreasonable quantity. So if the seller's output is so much higher than what was estimated, the buyer might not have to purchase it all. The manufacturer's action could be seen as bad faith because they're producing way more than the estimate, which the wholesaler can't handle.

So looking back, option B says no because the increase is disproportionate and exceeds the estimates, making it unreasonable for the buyer. Option J is similar but focuses on the agreed estimate. Both B and J seem relevant.

But wait, the agreement says the wholesaler will buy all the watches made each month. So is there an implied limitation based on the estimates? I think courts would look at whether the quantity is in good faith and within reasonable expectations. Since 2500 is way above the 1000-1500 range, the manufacturer might be acting in bad faith by producing so much more. Therefore, the court would likely rule against the manufacturer.

So the correct answer would be either B or J. Let me check the options again. Option B says it's a disproportionate increase beyond the estimates, so the court would say no. Option J says the wholesaler can't be expected to buy more than the estimated amount. Both seem correct, but perhaps B is more about the reasonableness and the disproportionate aspect, which is a key point.

I think the best answer is B. The court would not grant the manufacturer's request because the increase is too much beyond what was agreed upon.

The court is unlikely to grant the manufacturer's request because the significant increase in production exceeds the estimated range of 1000 to 1500 watches per month. This disproportionate increase is beyond the reasonable expectations set by the contract and may be seen as a breach of good faith. The wholesaler cannot be expected to purchase such a large volume, which is more than double the upper limit of the estimated range. Therefore, the manufacturer's demand is unreasonable, and the court would likely rule in favor of the wholesaler.

Answer: B
