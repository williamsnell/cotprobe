Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a muscle fiber contracting and lifting a weight. I'm supposed to calculate the work done by the fiber. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know about work and Hooke's law.

Alright, the problem says the muscle fiber contracts by 3.5 cm. Wait, I should probably convert that to meters because the units in physics are usually in meters, kilograms, seconds. So 3.5 cm is 0.035 meters. That makes sense.

The muscle obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh right, Hooke's law describes a spring's force, and here the muscle is behaving like a spring. The force constant k is given as 750 N/m. So k is 750, x is 0.035 m.

I remember that when you have a spring, the work done when it's stretched or compressed is related to the area under the force vs. displacement graph. Since F = -kx is a linear relationship, the graph is a straight line, and the area is a triangle.

Wait, what's the formula for the work done by a spring? I think it's (1/2)kx². Or wait, is it when you compress it, the work done is (1/2)kx². So in this case, the muscle is contracting, which I think is like compressing the spring, so the work is positive, right?

Wait, but when a spring is compressed, someone is doing work on the spring, right? So if the muscle is contracting, it's doing work on whatever it's lifting. So the work done by the muscle would be the same as the work done on the spring, which is (1/2)kx².

So plugging in the numbers: k is 750 N/m, x is 0.035 m. Let's compute that.

First, square x: 0.035 squared is ... let's calculate. 0.035 * 0.035. 0.03 squared is 0.0009, 0.005 squared is 0.000025. Wait, no, better to compute 35e-3 squared. 35^2 is 1225, so 0.035^2 is (35*1e-2)^2 = (35^2)*(1e-4) )= 1225e-4 = 0.1225. Wait, wait, 0.035 is 3.5e-2, so (3.5e-2)^2 is 12.25e-4, which is 0.001225.

So (1/2)*k*x² becomes (0.5)*(750)*(0.001225).

Let me compute that step by step.

750 multiplied by 0.001225. Hmm, 750 * 0.001 is 0.75. 750 * 0.000225 is 750 * 225e-6. 225e-6 is 0.000225. So 750 * 0.000225 = 0.16875. So total is 0.75 + 0.16875 = 0.91875.

Wait wait, no. Wait, no, wait. 0.001225 is 1.225e-3. So 750 * 1.225e-3.

Alternatively, 750 * 1.225 = 750 * (1 + 0.225) = 750 + 750*0.225.

750 *0.2 is 150, 750 *0.025 is 18.75. So 150+18.75=168.75. So 750 * 1.225 = 750 + 168.75 = 918.75. But that's in units of 750*(1.225e-3) = 918.75e-3 = 0.91875.

Then multiply by 0.5 because of the 1/2 factor. So 0.91875 * 0.5 is 0.459375 J.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option B is 0.46 J, which is approximately 0.459375. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait, am I sure the formula is (1/2)kx²? Because I recall that the potential energy stored in a spring is (1/2)kx², which would be the work done on the spring. But since the muscle is doing work, maybe it's the same as the work done by the spring. So yes, the work done by the muscle is (1/2)kx², which is approximately 0.459 J, so 0.46 J, which is option B.

To calculate the work performed by the muscle fiber, we use the formula for work done by a spring-like system, which is given by:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

Here, the muscle fiber obeys Hooke's law, \( F = -kx \), where \( k = 750 \, \mathrm{N/m} \) is the force constant, and \( x = 3.5 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.035 \, \mathrm{m} \) is the contraction distance.

1. **Square the displacement**:
   \[
   x^2 = (0.035)^2 = 0.001225
   \]

2. **Substitute into the work formula**:
   \[
   W = \frac{1}{2} (750) (0.001225)
   \]

3. **Calculate the terms**:
   - First, compute \( 750 \times 0.001225 \):
     \[
     750 \times 0.001225 = 0.91875
     \]
   - Then multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
     \[
     W = 0.5 \times 0.91875 = 0.459375 \, \mathrm{J}
     \]

4. **Compare with the options**:
   The closest value to \( 0.459375 \, \mathrm{J} \) is \( 0.46 \, \mathrm{J} \), which corresponds to **option B**.

Thus, the work performed by the muscle fiber is approximately **0.46 J**.
