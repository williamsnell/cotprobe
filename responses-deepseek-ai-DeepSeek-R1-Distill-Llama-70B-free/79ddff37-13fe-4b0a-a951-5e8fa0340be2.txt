Question:

A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?

Options:

A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms
B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR
C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier
D: The patient's symptoms are coincidental and not related to the CFTR mutation
E: The G551D mutation in CFTR does not cause symptoms
F: The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype
G: The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained
H: The patient's clinical phenotype is due to a mutation in a different gene
I: The patient has a rare form of CFTR mutation that requires two alleles
J: The CFTR mutation is associated with her clinical phenotype but not the cause

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about a patient with some specific symptoms and a CFTR mutation. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the patient is a 30-year-old woman with a 2-day history of abdominal pain. Her history includes recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She also has thick nasal secretions and salty sweat that crystallizes. Her vitals are normal, but she has epigastric tenderness.

So, I remember that CFTR gene mutations cause Cystic Fibrosis (CF), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. That means you need two defective alleles to have the disease. The classic symptoms of CF include respiratory issues like recurrent infections and sinusitis, digestive problems like pancreatitis, and salty sweat because CF affects chloride ion transport, leading to increased salt in sweat.

In this case, she's tested positive for the G551D mutation in one allele. But wait, CF is recessive, so usually you need two mutations. But wait, some mutations might cause different phenotypes depending on their severity. Oh right, there are different classes of CFTR mutations. The G551D mutation is a class III mutation, which is a gating mutation. It affects the chloride channel's ability to open. People with two copies of G551D have a classic CF presentation. But what if she only has one?

Wait, but the question says she has a detectable mutation in one allele. So she's either a carrier or has another mutation that's not detected. The test checked for the 36 most common mutations. So maybe she has a mutation that's not in those 36 on the other allele. Oh, that's a possibility. Because the test only looks for common mutations, if the other mutation is rare or not included, it wouldn't show up.

Now, looking at her symptoms: they're classic for CF. She's presenting with respiratory issues, sinus problems, pancreatitis. The salty sweat is a hallmark. So her symptoms point towards CF.

So if she has one mutation (G551D) and another undetected mutation (since the test didn't find it), she would have two defective alleles, making her have CF. But in this case, the test only found one. So what's the explanation?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms. That's correct in general for CF, but if she only has one, does she have symptoms? Wait, carriers (only one mutation) usually don't have symptoms. But sometimes, carriers might have mild or atypical symptoms. But classic CF requires two mutations.

Option B: Only one G551D allele is needed. No, because CF is recessive. So B is incorrect.

Option C: She's an obligate carrier. Obligate carriers are people who, based on family history, must carry a mutation. But she's presenting with symptoms, so this doesn't fit. Plus, carriers typically don't have symptoms.

Option D: Symptoms are coincidental. That seems unlikely because her symptoms align so well with CF.

Option E: G551D doesn't cause symptoms. No, that's not right. G551D definitely causes CF when present in two copies.

Option F: Mutation is unrelated. No, her symptoms fit CF, so the mutation is related.

Option G: Second mutation not detected. That makes sense. The test only checked 36 common ones. So she might have a rare mutation on the other allele which wasn't tested for. Thus, she has two mutations, leading to CF.

Option H: Different gene. Her symptoms point to CFTR, so this is less likely.

Option I: She has a rare mutation needing two alleles. Well, CF is usually recessive, but her having two alleles (one G551D and another mutation) would make sense. But the question is whether this is the case.

Option J: Mutation is associated but not cause. No, the mutation is the cause.

So putting it together, the correct answer is G. The second mutation wasn't detected because the test only looked for the 36 most common. Therefore, she has two mutations (G551D and another), leading to CF symptoms.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with symptoms consistent with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), including recurrent upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pancreatitis, thick nasal secretions, and salty sweat. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and it is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning two defective alleles are typically required to manifest the disease. The patient was found to have a G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, which is a known CF-causing mutation. However, the genetic test only screened for the 36 most common mutations, and it is possible that the second mutation is rare or not included in the test, meaning it was not detected. This would explain why the patient exhibits symptoms of CF, as she likely has two defective alleles (one G551D and another undetected mutation). 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While CF typically requires two mutated alleles, the patient’s symptoms suggest she has two defective alleles, with the second mutation likely undetected.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Only one G551D allele is insufficient to cause CF, as CF is recessive.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The patient is not merely a carrier; she has symptoms consistent with CF.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The symptoms are not coincidental; they align with CF caused by CFTR mutations.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The G551D mutation does cause symptoms when present in two copies.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The mutation is directly related to her clinical phenotype.  
- **G**: Correct. The second mutation was likely not detected because the test only screened for the 36 most common mutations.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The symptoms are consistent with CFTR mutations, not another gene.  
- **I**: Incorrect. CF is typically recessive, and the patient’s symptoms are consistent with two mutations.  
- **J**: Incorrect. The mutation is the cause of her symptoms, not just associated with them.  

The best explanation is that the second mutation was not detected by the testing, leading to her CF symptoms.
