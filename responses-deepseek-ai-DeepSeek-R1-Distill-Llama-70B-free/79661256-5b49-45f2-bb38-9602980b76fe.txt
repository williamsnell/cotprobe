Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is asking for the mass of one molecule of cholesterol. Cholesterol's chemical formula is given as C27H46O, and the molecular mass is 386. Hmm, right.

I remember that the molecular mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule. So, for cholesterol, that would be 27 carbons, 46 hydrogens, and one oxygen. But wait, I don't think I need to calculate that because the problem already gives the molecular mass as 386. So that's the molar mass, which is 386 grams per mole, right?

Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the molecular mass is in g/mol. So one mole of cholesterol would weigh 386 grams. But the question is about a single molecule. So I need to find out what fraction of a mole that is.

I remember Avogadro's number, which is 6.022 x 10^23 molecules per mole. So one mole is a really big number, like a lot of molecules. So if I have one molecule, that's 1 divided by Avogadro's number.

So the mass of one molecule would be the molar mass divided by Avogadro's number. So 386 g/mol divided by 6.022e23 molecules/mol. That should give grams per molecule.

Let me write that down: mass = 386 / (6.022e23). Let me calculate that.

Wait, but 386 divided by 6.022e23. Let me compute this. Let me get the approximate value. 

386 divided by 6.022 is approximately... let's see, 6 times 64 is 384, so 6.022 is about 6. So 386/6 is roughly 64.333... So that's 64.333 grams per mole divided by 1e23, but wait no: Wait, no, the division is 386/(6.022e23) = (386/6.022) * 1e-23.

So 386 divided by 6.022 is approximately, let me calculate that more accurately. 

6.022 times 64 is 6.022 * 60 = 361.32, and 6.022 *4=24.088, so 361.32 +24.088=385.408. Oh wait, so 6.022 *64 ≈ 385.4, which is close to 386. So 386 is 64.333... Let me compute 386 /6.022 exactly.

Let me do that calculation: 6.022 *64 =385.408, as above. So 386 -385.408 =0.592. So 0.592 left. So 0.592 /6.022 is approximately 0.098. So 64.098. So approximately 64.1.

So 64.1 grams per mole divided by Avogadro's number, which is 1e23, so 64.1e-23 grams per molecule. Wait, no, 64.1 is 386/(6.022e23) = (386/6.022) * 1e-23. So 386/6.022 is about 64.1, so 64.1e-23 grams. Wait, 64.1e-23 is 6.41 x 10^-22 grams. Because 64.1 is 6.41 x10^1, so 6.41e1 *1e-23 is 6.41e-22.

So the mass would be approximately 6.41 x 10^-22 grams. Now I look at the options, option D is 6.41e-22 g, so that's D.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 386 divided by Avogadro's number:

386 / 6.022e23 = (386 /6.022) * 1e-23. Let me compute 386 /6.022 precisely.

6.022 × 64 is 385.408, as before. So 386 -385.408 = 0.592. So 0.592 /6.022 = approx 0.098. So 64.098. So approximately 64.1.

So 64.1e-23 is 6.41e-22, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Another approach: 1 mole = 6.022e23 molecules, so 1 molecule is 1/(6.022e23) moles. So the mass is moles * molar mass. So mass = (1/6.022e23) * 386 g/mol = 386/(6.022e23) g.

Yes, same as before. So that's 6.41e-22 grams. So the answer should be D.

To determine the mass of one molecule of cholesterol (C27H46O), we start with its molar mass, which is given as 386 g/mol. This means one mole of cholesterol weighs 386 grams. 

Using Avogadro's number, \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \), we can calculate the mass of a single molecule by dividing the molar mass by Avogadro's number:

\[
\text{Mass of one molecule} = \frac{386}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \, \text{g}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{386}{6.022} \approx 64.1
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Mass of one molecule} \approx 64.1 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g} = 6.41 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{g}
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: \( 6.41 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{g} \)**.
