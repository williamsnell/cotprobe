Question:

During assigned seat-work time, Mary, a firstgrade student, sometimes leaves her seat and attempts to play with a block collection. When she leaves her seat, she fails to complete her seat work. Which of the following behavioral intervention strategies will most effectively increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work?

Options:

A: Instituting a class-wide reward system for staying in seats during work time
B: Giving Mary additional seat work as a consequence for leaving her seat
C: Having a one-on-one talk with Mary about the importance of discipline in class
D: Allowing Mary to read from a teacherselected book for a specific period of time before beginning her seat work
E: Removing the blocks from the classroom during the assigned seat-work time
F: Assigning a classmate to monitor Mary's behavior during seat-work time
G: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time
H: Explaining to Mary the value of completing seat work in terms of the objectives of the lesson
I: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks while doing her seat work
J: Ignoring Mary when she leaves her seat to play with the blocks

Okay, so I've got this question about Mary, a first-grade student, who keeps leaving her seat to play with blocks instead of doing her seat work. The question is asking which behavioral intervention would most effectively increase the likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work in the long term. Let me think through this carefully.

First, I need to understand the problem. Mary is supposed to be doing her seat work but she's getting distracted by the blocks. She leaves her seat, doesn't finish her work, and plays instead. So the goal is to find an intervention that will encourage her to stay in her seat and complete her tasks.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Class-wide reward system for staying in seats. That might work because it gives a group incentive. If the whole class is rewarded when everyone stays on task, Mary might feel motivated to comply to get the reward. But it's a group approach, so maybe it's not as targeted for Mary's specific behavior.

Option B: Giving more seat work as a consequence. That doesn't sound right. Adding more work could make her more frustrated and less likely to want to do her work. It might even increase the problem because she'd have more work to avoid.

Option C: One-on-one talk about discipline. Talking to her might help, but if it's just a lecture, she might not be motivated. Kids sometimes need more than just talk; they need incentives or clear consequences.

Option D: Letting her read a selected book before starting work. That could be a way to give her a break, but I'm not sure how it directly addresses the issue of leaving her seat. It might just delay the problem.

Option E: Removing the blocks during seat work. That seems logical because if the blocks aren't there, she can't play with them. It removes the temptation. But maybe it's a bit restrictive and doesn't teach her self-regulation.

Option F: Assigning a classmate to monitor her. That could work, but it might also create dependence on the monitor. Plus, having a peer watch her might not be as effective as other methods, and it could lead to social issues.

Option G: Allowing her to play with blocks afterward if she stays in her seat. This sounds like a positive reinforcement strategy. If she completes her work, she gets a reward she values. That could be effective because she's motivated by the blocks, so using them as a reward might encourage her to stay on task.

Option H: Explaining the value of completing seat work. That's more of a cognitive approach. While understanding the importance might help, young children like first-graders might not be as motivated by explanations alone. They often respond better to immediate rewards.

Option I: Letting her play with blocks while doing seat work. That seems counterproductive because if she's playing, she's not focusing on her work. It might make the problem worse.

Option J: Ignoring her when she leaves. Ignoring the behavior might not address it. If she's seeking attention or enjoying the blocks, ignoring could let the behavior continue without any consequence or incentive to change.

So, thinking about behavioral interventions, positive reinforcement is often effective. Mary wants to play with blocks, so offering that as a reward after she completes her work (Option G) would likely motivate her. This way, she learns that staying on task leads to a desired outcome. Over time, this could build a habit of completing her work.

Another approach could be Option E, removing the blocks. That might stop the problem immediately, but it doesn't teach Mary why she should stay in her seat. It's more of a quick fix. Positive reinforcement (Option G) could have a more lasting effect because it teaches her the value of completing her work through rewards.

Option A's class-wide system might help, but it's less direct. Mary's issue is specific, so a targeted intervention like G would probably be better.

So, putting it all together, I think the best option is G: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time.

The most effective behavioral intervention to increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work is to use positive reinforcement. By allowing Mary to play with the blocks after she remains in her seat and completes her work, she is motivated by a reward she values. This strategy teaches her that staying on task leads to a desired outcome, fostering self-regulation and a habit of completing her work. 

Answer: G
