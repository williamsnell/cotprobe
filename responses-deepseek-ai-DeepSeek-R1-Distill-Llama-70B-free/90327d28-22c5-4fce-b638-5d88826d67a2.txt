Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about the percentage of the world population practicing open defecation as of 2020. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on exact statistics, but I remember that open defecation is a significant public health issue in many developing countries.

I think the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF track these kinds of data. From what I recall, there was a push through the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to reduce open defecation. The MDGs ran until 2015, so I'm trying to remember if the percentage was around that time and what it was.

Wait, I think around 2015, the percentage was higher, maybe around 15% or so. But since then, there's been progress, so the number should have decreased. But I'm not exactly sure by how much. 

I remember hearing that in 2020, some organizations reported that about 673 million people still practiced open defecation. Let me calculate what percentage that would be of the world population. The world population in 2020 was approximately 7.8 billion. So 673 million divided by 7.8 billion equals roughly 0.086, which is 8.6%. Looking at the options, that's close to 9%, which is option D. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain if that exact figure is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. Another thought: sometimes these statistics can vary slightly based on the source or the exact definition of open defecation. For example, does it include people who defecate in the open in rural areas versus urban? I think the definition is pretty consistent, though.

Alternatively, I might have heard that the percentage is lower than 10%. If we take the 673 million figure, 673 divided by 7800 (million) is 673/7800. Let me do that calculation more accurately. 7800 divided by 100 is 78. So 78 times 8 is 624, which is less than 673. 78*8=624, 78*8.6=624 + (78*0.6)=624 +46.8=670.8. So 8.6% would be about 673 million. So yeah, that's about 8.6%, which rounds to 9%, so option D.

But wait, another angle: sometimes these statistics are presented as the percentage of the rural population rather than the entire global population. Oh, but the question specifically asks about the world population, so it's the entire population. 

I'm pretty confident now that the correct answer is around 9%, which is option D.

The correct answer is D: 9%. 

The World Health Organization and UNICEF have reported that as of 2020, approximately 673 million people worldwide practiced open defecation. Given the global population was around 7.8 billion in 2020, this figure represents roughly 8.6% of the population, which rounds to 9%.

Answer: D
