Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Discuss the role of a stimulus that elicits a behavior pattern.

Options:

A: The intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior is directly proportional to the animal's motivation
B: Only stimuli of a social nature can elicit behavior patterns in animals
C: Behavior patterns are random and not specifically elicited by any particular stimuli
D: A stimulus always requires conscious recognition by the animal to elicit a behavior pattern
E: All stimuli can elicit specific behavior patterns
F: A stimulus elicits a behavior pattern based solely on the physical strength of the stimulus, regardless of the animal's internal state
G: Sign stimuli elicit specific responses from an animal and the intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior pattern is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation to perform that behavior.
H: Sign stimuli suppress specific responses in an animal
I: The frequency of a stimulus rather than its intensity determines the likelihood of eliciting a behavior pattern
J: Stimuli that elicit behavior patterns are only effective in the presence of other, secondary stimuli

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about animal behavior, specifically about stimuli and behavior patterns. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the role of a stimulus that elicits a behavior pattern. The options are A through J. I remember from my notes that behavior patterns can be elicited by specific stimuli, and sometimes these are called sign stimuli. Sign stimuli are specific cues that trigger an innate behavior, right? Like how a certain call might make a bird behave in a certain way.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says the intensity of stimuli needed is directly proportional to the animal's motivation. So, higher motivation means you need a stronger stimulus? I'm not sure. I think it might be the opposite. Like, if an animal is highly motivated, maybe a weaker stimulus would work. So this might not be correct.

Option B claims only social stimuli can elicit behavior. That doesn't sound right. I remember examples like a moth responding to light, which isn't social. So B is probably wrong.

Option C suggests behavior patterns are random and not tied to specific stimuli. No, that's not right. Many behaviors are very specific to certain cues, like reflex actions or instinctual behaviors. So C is incorrect.

Option D says a stimulus requires conscious recognition. I don't think that's true for all cases. Many responses are automatic or instinctual, without conscious thought. So D is probably wrong.

Option E says all stimuli can elicit specific behavior patterns. That seems too broad. I mean, not every stimulus would cause a specific behavior. Maybe only certain ones do, like sign stimuli. So E is likely incorrect.

Option F states that the stimulus's physical strength determines the response, ignoring internal state. But I remember that an animal's motivation or internal state does matter. For example, a hungry bird might respond more strongly to food-related stimuli. So F might be wrong because it disregards the internal state.

Option G says sign stimuli elicit specific responses, and the intensity needed is inversely proportional to motivation. Oh, wait, that makes sense. If an animal is very motivated (like very hungry), even a weak stimulus (like a faint smell of food) would trigger the behavior. So the more motivated, the less intense the stimulus needs to be. So G sounds correct.

Option H claims sign stimuli suppress responses. No, sign stimuli are supposed to elicit, not suppress. So H is wrong.

Option I says frequency determines likelihood, not intensity. I'm not sure. I think intensity is a factor, but maybe in some cases frequency matters. Not sure, but I don't remember this as the primary factor. So maybe I is not the right choice.

Option J says stimuli only work with secondary stimuli present. I don't think that's always true. Some stimuli work on their own as primary cues. So J is probably incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer seems to be option G. It correctly describes sign stimuli and relates stimulus intensity inversely to the animal's motivation.

The question asks about the role of a stimulus in eliciting a behavior pattern. The correct answer must align with the concept of sign stimuli, which are specific cues that trigger innate behaviors. 

- **Option A** suggests that the intensity of stimuli is directly proportional to motivation, but this is likely incorrect because higher motivation may require weaker stimuli.  
- **Option B** limits stimuli to social ones, which is incorrect as non-social stimuli (e.g., light for moths) also elicit behaviors.  
- **Option C** claims behavior patterns are random, which contradicts the idea of specific stimuli eliciting specific responses.  
- **Option D** states that conscious recognition is required, but many responses are automatic or instinctual.  
- **Option E** asserts all stimuli elicit specific behaviors, which is too broad and inaccurate.  
- **Option F** ignores the animal's internal state, which is important in determining responses.  
- **Option G** correctly describes sign stimuli and explains that the intensity of stimuli needed is inversely proportional to motivation, making it the best choice.  
- **Option H** incorrectly claims sign stimuli suppress responses.  
- **Option I** emphasizes frequency over intensity, which is not the primary factor.  
- **Option J** requires secondary stimuli, which is not always true.  

Thus, the correct answer is **G**, as it accurately explains the role of sign stimuli and their relationship with motivation. 

Answer: G
