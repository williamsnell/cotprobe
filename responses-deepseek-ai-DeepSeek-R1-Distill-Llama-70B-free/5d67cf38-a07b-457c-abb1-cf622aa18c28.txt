Question:

The frequency of the gene for sickle-cell anemia in African-Americans is less than that found in the people living in their ancestral home in Africa. What factors might account for this difference?

Options:

A: Sickle-cell disease is more deadly in America
B: Sickle-cell disease has been completely eradicated in America
C: The sickle-cell gene mutates at a lower rate in America
D: Genetic drift has led to a decrease in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene in African-Americans
E: Increased medical intervention in America allows individuals with sickle-cell disease to live longer and reproduce more
F: There is no difference in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene between African-Americans and their African ancestors
G: In America, the incidence of malaria is insignificant, sickle-cell genes are being diluted by normal genes and interracial marriages.
H: There is a higher survival rate for sickle-cell carriers in America
I: Sickle-cell allele is more dominant in Africa
J: The sickle-cell allele is being actively selected against in the African-American population

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about sickle-cell anemia and gene frequencies. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question is asking why the frequency of the sickle-cell gene is lower in African-Americans compared to their ancestral populations in Africa. I remember that sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene. The disease causes red blood cells to be misshapen, which can lead to various health issues, including increased risk of infections and organ damage.

Wait, but I also recall that being a carrier of the sickle-cell gene (having one copy, so being heterozygous) provides some protection against malaria. Oh right, that's a classic example of heterozygote advantage. In areas where malaria is prevalent, especially in Africa, having the sickle-cell trait (HbS) offers some resistance, so natural selection favors those with one copy of the gene. That's why the allele frequency is higher there.

But in the US, African-Americans don't have the same level of malaria exposure. Malaria is pretty rare here, so the selective pressure that maintained the higher frequency of the sickle-cell allele in Africa isn't present. Without that pressure, the allele might decrease in frequency. But how?

Well, in Africa, the heterozygotes have a survival advantage, so the allele is maintained. In America, without the malaria, the advantage disappears. So the allele would become less common over generations. But why exactly? Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, option G says that in America, the incidence of malaria is low, so the sickle-cell genes are being diluted by normal genes and interracial marriages. That makes sense because without the selective advantage, the HbS allele would decrease. Also, if people are marrying outside their original population, introducing more alleles without the sickle-cell trait could dilute its frequency.

Option D suggests genetic drift is the cause. Genetic drift is random changes in allele frequencies, but I think in this case, it's more about selection and possibly dilution, not drift. So D might not be the main reason.

Option J says the allele is being actively selected against. That would mean that having the HbS allele is harmful in the US, which I'm not sure about. Wait, actually, in areas without malaria, the heterozygote doesn't have an advantage, so the allele might just not be favored, but is it selected against? Or is it just not selected for?

Hmm, if there's no advantage, then the allele frequency might decrease because the heterozygote doesn't have a benefit, so maybe it's selected against. Or maybe it's just that the disease is more deadly, but I think that's not the main point.

Wait, another angle: in the US, better medical care might mean that individuals with sickle-cell anemia (homozygous) can live longer and have children, which would actually increase the allele frequency. But the question says the frequency is lower, so that's not the case. So maybe medical intervention isn't the main factor here.

Option E is about increased medical intervention allowing those with the disease to live longer and reproduce more. But if that were true, the allele frequency might actually stay the same or even increase, which contradicts the question. So E might not be correct.

Option G seems to fit because without malaria, the protective effect is gone, and intermarriage would bring in more non-HbS alleles, thereby diluting the frequency.

So, putting it together, the main factors are the lack of malaria (so no selection for the allele) and gene flow from other populations through intermarriage, which would lower the frequency of the HbS allele in African-Americans compared to their African ancestors.

The frequency of the sickle-cell gene is lower in African-Americans compared to their ancestral populations in Africa due to the absence of malaria in the United States. In Africa, the sickle-cell allele (HbS) is maintained at a higher frequency because heterozygotes (carriers) have a survival advantage against malaria. However, in the U.S., where malaria is insignificant, this selective advantage disappears, leading to a decrease in the allele's frequency. Additionally, interracial marriages and gene flow from populations without the sickle-cell allele further dilute its frequency in African-Americans. This explains the observed difference in allele frequencies between the two populations.
