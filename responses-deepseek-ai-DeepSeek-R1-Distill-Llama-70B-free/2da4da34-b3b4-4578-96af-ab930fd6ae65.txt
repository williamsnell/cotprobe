Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a method where an obese person is asked to restrict their eating to specific situations, like a particular place in the kitchen at certain times of the day. And I need to pick which psychological technique this is an example of.

Hmm. The options are A through J, each a different term. I remember some of these concepts from my notes, but I might need to think through each one.

First, let's break down the scenario. The person is limiting when and where they eat. So they're not eating anywhere else except the kitchen, and only at set times. I think this is some kind of behavioral strategy to control eating habits.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Counter conditioning. That's when you replace an unwanted behavior with a more desirable one. Like using a pleasant stimulus to counteract a negative response. Not sure if this fits.

B: Response control. I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's about controlling the responses to certain stimuli. So if you control when and where you respond (like eating), it might be that.

C: Exposure therapy. This is typically used for phobias, where you gradually expose someone to the feared object. Doesn't seem to fit here.

D: Cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a broader approach focusing on changing thought patterns. Restricting eating times seems more about behavior than thoughts, so maybe not.

E: Aversive conditioning. This involves associating an unwanted behavior with an unpleasant stimulus. Like using a bad taste to stop smoking. Doesn't fit here because the scenario isn't about making eating unpleasant.

F: Self-punishment. That's when someone penalizes themselves for a behavior. Not the case here; it's more about controlling when to eat.

G: Self-monitoring. This is tracking your own behavior, like keeping a food diary. The scenario isn't about tracking but restricting.

H: Reinforcement control. Reinforcement is about rewards. Maybe controlling what reinforces the behavior, but the example is about limiting the context of eating, not rewarding it.

I: Systematic desensitization. This is another anxiety treatment where you gradually expose someone to the fear source. Not related here.

So from these, the scenario is about controlling the situations in which eating occurs. That sounds like it's managing the stimuli that trigger the behavior. So maybe response control? Or is there a better fit?

Wait, another term comes to mind: stimulus control. Stimulus control is a technique where you control the environment to influence behavior. Like, if you eat only in the kitchen, you're limiting the stimuli that lead to eating elsewhere. But looking at the options, I don't see stimulus control listed. So perhaps the closest is response control, which is B.

Alternatively, maybe it's about self-control techniques. But the options don't have that. Another angle: operant conditioning. Restricting the conditions under which a behavior occurs is part of controlling the operant responses. So response control might fit.

Wait, another thoughtâ€”could it be self-monitoring? No, because self-monitoring is observing and recording, not necessarily controlling when or where.

So, putting it together: asking someone to eat only at certain times and places is controlling the responses (eating) by limiting the situations. So that's response control.

The question involves identifying the psychological technique where an obese person is instructed to restrict eating to specific situations, such as a particular place in the kitchen at predetermined times. This strategy aims to control the behavior by limiting the contexts in which eating occurs. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Counter conditioning (A):** Involves replacing an unwanted behavior with a desirable one, which doesn't fit here.  
- **Response control (B):** Refers to managing the conditions under which a behavior occurs, making it a strong candidate.  
- **Exposure therapy (C):** Used for treating phobias through gradual exposure, not relevant here.  
- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (D):** Focuses on changing thought patterns, not just behavioral contexts.  
- **Aversive conditioning (E):** Associates unwanted behavior with unpleasant stimuli, which isn't the case here.  
- **Self-punishment (F):** Involves penalizing oneself, which isn't described in the scenario.  
- **Self-monitoring (G):** Involves tracking behavior, not restricting it.  
- **Reinforcement control (H):** Relates to using rewards, which isn't the focus here.  
- **Systematic desensitization (I):** Treats anxiety through gradual exposure, unrelated to the scenario.  

The technique described aligns with controlling the stimuli that trigger eating, which is best captured by **response control**.
