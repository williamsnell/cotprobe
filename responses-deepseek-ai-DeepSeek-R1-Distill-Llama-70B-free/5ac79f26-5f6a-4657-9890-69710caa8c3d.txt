The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A producer of widgets contacted a manufacturer of boxes about the possibility of purcIiasing specially designed boxes for shipping the widgets to customers. The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held

Options:

A: unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.
B: unenforceable, because the manufacturer was under a pre-existing duty.
C: unenforceable, due to the Statute of Frauds.
D: enforceable, as the parties' intentions were clear and unambiguous.
E: unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.
F: enforceable, due to the oral agreement being a modification of the written contract.
G: enforceable, because the manufacturer was motivated by a business advantage.
H: enforceable.
I: unenforceable, as the agreement to supply more boxes was not in writing.
J: unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the scenario is about a producer of widgets and a manufacturer of boxes. The producer contacts the manufacturer to buy specially designed boxes. They send over the specs and their logo. Then, after negotiations, they enter into a written contract. The contract says the manufacturer will supply as many boxes as the producer needs, up to 10,000 per month.

Later that same day, the producer calls and says they're doing a one-time promotion and need 15,000 boxes for the first month. The manufacturer agrees orally. The question is about whether this oral agreement is enforceable.

The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

Alright, so I think I need to consider contract law principles here. Let me break it down.

First, the written contract: it's for up to 10,000 boxes per month. Then, the oral agreement is to increase that to 15,000 for the first month. So the issue is whether this oral modification is enforceable.

I remember that contracts can be modified, but there are rules about that. One key point is consideration—does a modification require new consideration to be valid? Or does the pre-existing duty rule apply?

Wait, the pre-existing duty rule says that if you have a duty under an existing contract, you can't use that as consideration for a modification. So here, the manufacturer already agreed to supply up to 10,000 boxes. If the producer is asking for more, does that require the manufacturer to do something beyond their existing duty? Hmm.

But wait, the written contract is for up to 10,000. So the producer can order any number up to that. So if they order 15,000, that's beyond the original agreement. So the manufacturer agreeing to supply 15,000 is a new promise beyond their existing duty.

So the question is, does this new promise (to supply 15k) require consideration to be binding? Under traditional contract law, modifications without new consideration may not be enforceable because of the pre-existing duty rule. But wait, some jurisdictions have moved away from that under the UCC, especially for goods.

Wait, the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) applies here because we're dealing with the sale of goods—boxes are goods. Under UCC § 2-209, a contract for the sale of goods can be modified without additional consideration if the modification is in good faith. So even if there's no new consideration, the oral agreement might still be enforceable.

But wait, does that apply here? The original contract was for up to 10,000, and the oral agreement is for 15,000. The manufacturer agreed, so it's a mutual agreement to increase the maximum. Since it's a sale of goods, UCC applies, so the modification doesn't need new consideration.

So the oral agreement would be enforceable. But let me look at the options.

Option F says enforceable due to the oral agreement being a modification of the written contract. That makes sense if UCC allows it without consideration.

Wait, but another angle: the Statute of Frauds. The original contract—does it fall under the Statute of Frauds? Contracts for goods over $500 require a writing. But the original contract is written. The oral modification is for 15,000 boxes. If each box is, say, a certain price, but I don't know the value. However, the modification doesn't necessarily need to be in writing under UCC 2-209 because it's a modification, not a new contract. But I'm not sure if the Statute of Frauds would affect the modification. Maybe it's not an issue here.

Another point: the parol evidence rule. That's about prior or contemporaneous agreements contradicting a written contract. But here, the oral agreement is a subsequent modification, so the parol evidence rule wouldn't apply. So option J is about parol evidence rule, which doesn't fit.

Option A says unenforceable because the written contract was the final integration. But a subsequent oral modification can still be valid, especially under UCC.

Option E is about inadequate consideration. But under UCC 2-209, consideration isn't required for modifications. So E might not apply.

Option B says unenforceable because manufacturer was under a pre-existing duty. But that's the old common law rule, which doesn't apply under UCC for goods.

So putting it together: since the contract is for goods, UCC applies, and the oral modification is enforceable because UCC allows it without new consideration, as long as it's in good faith. So the correct answer would be F: enforceable due to the oral agreement being a modification of the written contract.

The enforceability of the oral agreement hinges on whether the modification to the written contract is valid under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as the contract involves the sale of goods (boxes). Under UCC § 2-209, a contract for the sale of goods can be modified without additional consideration if the modification is made in good faith. Here, the manufacturer orally agreed to supply 15,000 boxes for the first month, which constitutes a modification of the written contract. Since the UCC allows such modifications without requiring new consideration, the oral agreement is enforceable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The written contract is not the final integration because a subsequent oral modification is permissible under UCC § 2-209.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The pre-existing duty rule does not apply to contracts for the sale of goods under the UCC, which allows modifications without new consideration.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The Statute of Frauds does not bar the oral modification, as the original contract was already in writing, and the modification does not require a separate writing under the UCC.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the parties' intentions were clear, this is not the primary reason for enforceability in this case.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Under UCC § 2-209, consideration is not required for modifications of contracts for the sale of goods.
- **Option F**: Correct. The oral agreement is enforceable as a modification of the written contract under UCC § 2-209.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the manufacturer may have been motivated by a business advantage, this is not the determining factor for enforceability.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. This option is too vague and does not address the specific legal principles at play.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The oral agreement does not require a writing under the UCC for modifications.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The parol evidence rule applies to prior or contemporaneous agreements, not subsequent modifications.

Thus, the oral agreement is enforceable because it is a valid modification of the written contract under the UCC.
