Question:

Federal law prohibits "willingly and knowingly" taking cash in excess of $10,000 from the U.S. into a foreign country without first reporting the transaction in detail. An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of "willingly and knowingly" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?

Options:

A: No, because the owner's habitual actions imply intent to avoid reporting the cash.
B: No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.
C: Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.
D: No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.
E: Yes, because the owner was not intentionally breaking the law, he was simply unaware of it.
F: No, because ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.
G: Yes, because the owner is not a resident of the U.S. and therefore not subject to its laws.
H: No, because the owner is a business operator and therefore should be aware of such laws.
I: Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.
J: Yes, because the owner was not given a fair chance to defend himself in court.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about federal law and whether the conviction will be reversed on appeal. Let me break it down step by step.

The question revolves around a federal law that prohibits taking more than $10,000 in cash out of the U.S. without reporting it. The key here is the wording "willingly and knowingly." The defendant, a Detroit drug store owner, is taking his weekly cash receipts to Canada, where he does his banking. He got indicted on 10 counts, and his defense is that he didn't know about the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge told the jury that mistake of law isn't a defense, and he was convicted. Now, he's appealing.

So, the main issue here is whether the trial court's instruction to the jury was correct. The defendant's argument is that he didn't know the law, so he couldn't have acted "willingly and knowingly." The prosecution is relying on the idea that ignorance of the law isn't a defense.

I remember from my studies that generally, "ignorance of the law is no excuse." But there are exceptions, especially when the law requires a specific intent or knowledge. The phrase "willfully and knowingly" is crucial. In some cases, courts have held that when a statute uses such terms, the government must prove that the defendant knew the law and intended to violate it.

Wait, I think in cases like this, particularly with the Supreme Court's decision in Cheek v. United States, the court held that when a statute requires willfulness, the defendant must have knowledge of the law. So, if the defendant genuinely didn't know about the reporting requirement, he couldn't have acted willfully.

In this case, the defendant's main defense is that he didn't know the law. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law isn't a defense, but if the law requires specific intent (i.e., knowing the law), then that instruction might have been incorrect.

Looking at the answer options:

Option C says yes because the willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and specific intent. That aligns with what I was thinking about cases where willfulness implies knowing the law.

Option F says no because ignorance isn't a defense. But that's the general rule, not considering the specific intent aspect.

Option D says no because willfulness is inferred from habitual actions. But habit alone might not prove knowledge of the law.

So, I think the correct answer is C because the appellate court would likely reverse if the law requires proving that the defendant knew the law, which the trial court didn't allow the jury to consider.

The case hinges on whether the defendant's lack of knowledge about the law can negate the "willfully and knowingly" requirement. Federal law requires that such terms imply the defendant must know both the law and intend to violate it. The trial court's instruction that mistake of law isn't a defense was incorrect because the statute's specific intent element necessitates proof of knowledge. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to reverse the conviction.

Answer: C
