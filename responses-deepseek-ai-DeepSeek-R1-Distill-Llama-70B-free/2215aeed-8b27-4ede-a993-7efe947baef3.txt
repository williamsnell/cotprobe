Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist has an unknown element X. The atomic weight of X is 210.197 amu. It has two isotopes, ^210X and ^212X. Their masses are 209.64 amu and 211.66 amu respectively. I need to find the relative abundance of these two isotopes.

Hmm, I remember that the atomic weight is the weighted average of the isotope masses based on their abundance. So the formula should be something like:

Atomic Weight = (mass of isotope 1 * abundance 1) + (mass of isotope 2 * abundance 2)

Since there are only two isotopes, their abundances should add up to 100%. Let's denote the abundance of ^210X as x, and ^212X as y. So, x + y = 1.

The atomic weight equation becomes:
210.197 = (209.64 * x) + (211.66 * y)

But since y = 1 - x, I can substitute that:
210.197 = 209.64x + 211.66(1 - x)

Let me expand that:
210.197 = 209.64x + 211.66 - 211.66x

Combine like terms. Let's subtract 209.64x from both sides and subtract 210.197 from both sides to group the x terms:

210.197 - 211.66 = 209.64x - 211.66x

Wait, maybe another approach:
Let me group the x terms first.

209.64x -211.66x = (209.64 - 211.66)x = (-2.02)x

Then the equation becomes:
210.197 = 211.66 -2.02x

Wait, wait, let me re-calculate that step. The equation after substitution is:
210.197 = 209.64x + 211.66 - 211.66x

So grouping the x terms: 209.64x -211.66x = (209.64 -211.66)x = (-2.02)x

So 210.197 = 211.66 -2.02x

Now, subtract 211.66 from both sides:
210.197 - 211.66 = -2.02x

That gives:
-1.463 = -2.02x

Divide both sides by -2.02:
x = (-1.463)/(-2.02) = 1.463 / 2.02

Let me compute that. 1.463 divided by 2.02. Hmm, 2.02 times 0.7 is 1.414. Because 2.02 *0.7 = 1.414. Then 1.463 - 1.414 is 0.049 remaining. So 0.049/2.02 is about 0.02426. So approximately 0.7 + 0.02426 = 0.72426, which is about 72.426%. So x â‰ˆ72.42%.

So the abundance of ^210X is approximately 72.42%, and ^212X is 100 -72.42 = 27.58%.

Looking at the options, option C is 72.42% and 27.58%. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, just to double-check my calculations. Let me compute 1.463 /2.02 more accurately.

First, 2.02 * 0.7 = 1.414. Subtract that from 1.463: 1.463 -1.414 = 0.049.

So 0.049 divided by 2.02. Let's see, 0.049 /2.02.

Well, 2.02 * 0.024 is approximately 0.04848. So 0.024 gives about 0.04848, which is close to 0.049. So 0.724 (72.4%) plus approximately 0.024, totaling 72.424%, which is ~72.42%.

Yes, that seems right. So the abundances are 72.42% and 27.58%, which is option C.

To determine the relative abundance of the two isotopes of element X, we use the weighted average formula for atomic weight:

\[
\text{Atomic Weight} = (\text{mass of isotope 1} \times \text{abundance of isotope 1}) + (\text{mass of isotope 2} \times \text{abundance of isotope 2})
\]

Let the abundance of \( ^{210}X \) be \( x \), and the abundance of \( ^{212}X \) be \( y \). Since there are only two isotopes:

\[
x + y = 1
\]

The atomic weight equation becomes:

\[
210.197 = (209.64 \times x) + (211.66 \times y)
\]

Substituting \( y = 1 - x \):

\[
210.197 = 209.64x + 211.66(1 - x)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
210.197 = 209.64x + 211.66 - 211.66x
\]

\[
210.197 - 211.66 = -2.02x
\]

\[
-1.463 = -2.02x
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-1.463}{-2.02} = 0.72426 \, \text{(or approximately 72.42\%)}
\]

Thus, the abundance of \( ^{210}X \) is approximately 72.42%, and the abundance of \( ^{212}X \) is:

\[
y = 1 - x = 1 - 0.72426 = 0.27574 \, \text{(or approximately 27.58\%)}
\]

Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 72.42% and 27.58%**
