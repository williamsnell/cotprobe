Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out which statement is not true. Let me read through the options again.

The question is asking which of the statements A to E is not true. The options are about different food sources and their protein content, specifically regarding certain amino acids.

Let me start by recalling what I know about amino acids and food sources. I remember that proteins are made up of amino acids, some of which are essential, meaning our bodies can't make them, so we need to get them from our diet.

Option A says nuts and seeds are deficient in lysine. Hmm, from what I remember, lysine is an essential amino acid. I think that nuts and seeds are actually a good source of several amino acids, but I'm not sure about lysine specifically. Wait, I think lysine is more commonly found in animal products and maybe legumes. Oh wait, I think nuts and seeds might be lower in lysine. So A might be true.

Option B: Legumes are deficient in methionine. I recall that legumes are a good source of protein and they contain many amino acids. Methionine is an essential amino acid. I think that legumes are actually low in methionine, so they're sometimes paired with foods that have it, like grains. So B seems to be true.

Option C: Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein. That doesn't sound right. I've heard that a well-planned vegan diet can provide all the necessary proteins. Vegans get protein from legumes, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. So it's not impossible to get enough protein; in fact, many vegans meet their protein needs without issue. So C is probably the false statement.

Option D: Dairy products are a rich source of tryptophan. Tryptophan is another essential amino acid. Dairy products, like milk and cheese, are known to have tryptophan. Tryptophan is also found in turkey and other meats, but since the option is about dairy, I think D is true.

Option E: Cereals are deficient in lysine. Cereals, like grains, are often low in lysine. I remember that grains tend to have less lysine compared to legumes. So E is true.

So, putting it all together. The question is to find the statement that's not true. Option C says vegan diets are likely deficient in protein. But from what I know, that's not correct because vegans can get enough protein from various plant sources. So the not true statement is C.

The statement that is not true is **C: Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein**. A well-planned vegan diet can provide adequate protein from sources like legumes, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. The other options are accurate: nuts and seeds are low in lysine (A), legumes are low in methionine (B), dairy products are rich in tryptophan (D), and cereals are deficient in lysine (E).

Answer: C
