Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the chain of command and where it extends from. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the chain of command is a term I've heard in the context of organizational structure, maybe in business or military settings. It refers to the hierarchy, right? Like, who reports to whom. So, if I imagine a company, there's the CEO at the top, then managers, then team leaders, and then the employees. That's a typical hierarchy.

The question is asking from where the chain extends. So, does it go from the bottom up or the top down? I think it's usually top-down because the higher-ups make decisions, and those orders trickle down to the lower levels. Like, the CEO makes a decision, tells the managers, who then tell their teams. That makes sense because the authority starts at the top and flows downward.

Wait, but I should make sure. Sometimes people talk about bottom-up approaches where lower levels influence higher ones, but that's more about communication flow rather than the formal chain of command. The chain of command is more about the formal lines of authority.

So, if the chain starts at the top, then it's top to bottom. Looking at the options, option B says "Top to bottom." Option A is the opposite, so that's probably not right. The other options like horizontally, diagonally, etc., don't fit the linear hierarchy I'm thinking of.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is B: Top to bottom.

The chain of command extends from the top to the bottom, as authority flows downward through the hierarchy. 

Answer: B
