Okay, so I've got this problem about a manometer, and I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question says the manometer is U-shaped with water, one side connected to an apparatus and the other open to the atmosphere. The external pressure is 770 Torr, and the open side is 10 cm lower than the apparatus side. I need to find the pressure in the apparatus.

Hmm, I remember that manometers measure the pressure difference between two points. The basic principle is that the pressure exerted by a column of fluid is given by the formula P = ρgh, where ρ is density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height difference.

Wait, so in this case, the side connected to the apparatus has higher pressure because the water is lower on the open side. So the pressure in the apparatus must be higher than atmospheric pressure by ρgh.

Wait, no, wait. No, the way manometers work is that if the fluid is higher on one side, that side has lower pressure. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the fluid's height difference indicates the pressure difference. So if the open side is lower than the apparatus side, that means the apparatus has higher pressure, pushing the fluid down on its side. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Oh right, if the apparatus is at higher pressure, it would push the fluid down on its side, making the fluid level lower on the apparatus side. So in this case, the open side is 10 cm lower, which suggests that the fluid on the apparatus side is 10 cm higher? Wait, wait, the question says the open side is 10 cm lower than the side connected to the apparatus. So the fluid is higher on the apparatus side. So that would mean the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric.

Wait, the pressure in the apparatus would be atmospheric pressure plus the pressure from the column of water. Because if the apparatus's pressure is higher, it pushes the water down, causing the height on its side to be higher.

So the pressure P_apparatus = P_atm + ρgh.

Wait, but wait, the units here. The external pressure is given in Torr, and the options are in kPa, so I need to convert units somewhere.

First, let me jot down the knowns:

- Height difference (h) = 10 cm. But wait, since the open side is lower, that means the water is higher on the apparatus side by 10 cm. So h is 10 cm, which is 0.1 meters.

- Density of water (ρ) = 0.99707 g/cm³. I need to convert this into kg/m³ because the standard unit for density in SI is kg/m³. So 1 g/cm³ is equal to 1000 kg/m³. So 0.99707 g/cm³ is 997.07 kg/m³.

- Acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.8 m/s².

So the pressure from the water column is P_water = ρgh.

Let me calculate that:

P_water = 997.07 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 0.1 m.

Wait, 997.07 * 9.8 = let's compute that.

First, 1000 * 9.8 is 9800, but since it's 997.07, subtract 2.93 *9.8.

Wait, 997.07 is 1000 - 2.93. So 1000 *9.8=9800, 2.93*9.8= approx 28.724. So 9800 -28.724 = 9771.276 Pa. Then multiply by 0.1 m: 977.1276 Pascals.

Wait, wait no, wait. Because 997.07 * 9.8 = let me compute it more accurately.

997.07 * 9.8:

Compute 997.07 *10 = 9970.7.

Subtract 997.07 * 0.2 = 199.414.

So 9970.7 - 199.414 = 9771.286.

Then multiply by 0.1 m (h=0.1 m), so 977.1286 Pascals.

So P_water = approximately 977.13 Pa.

Wait, 977.13 Pa is about 977 Pascals.

But wait, the atmospheric pressure is given as 770 Torr. I need to convert that to Pascals to add them together.

I remember that 1 atmosphere is about 760 Torr, and 1 atm is 101325 Pascals.

So 770 Torr is 770/760 atm. Let me compute that.

770 /760 = approx 1.01316 atm. So 1.01316 * 101325 Pa.

Calculating that: 1 atm is 101325 Pa, so 1.01316 *101325.

Let me compute:

101325 *1 =101325

101325 *0.01=1013.25

101325 *0.003=303.975

Wait, 0.013 is 0.01 + 0.003. So 1013.25 +303.975=1317.225.

So total is 101325 +1317.225=102642.225 Pa.

Wait, wait, but is that correct? Because 770 Torr is higher than 760 Torr (1 atm), so yes, the external pressure (atmospheric) is 770 Torr, which is higher than 1 atm.

Wait a second, no. Wait, in this setup, the external pressure is the atmospheric pressure. So the atmospheric pressure is 770 Torr, which is higher than standard atmospheric pressure (which is 760 Torr, 1 atm). So the P_atm is 770 Torr.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. So the manometer measures the pressure difference between the apparatus and the atmosphere. Since the open end is at atmospheric pressure, the pressure in the apparatus is P_atm + ρgh.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Torr since the external pressure is given in Torr. Let me try to work in Torr units.

So, the height difference is 10 cm of water. I need to find what pressure that corresponds to in Torr.

I know that 1 atm is 760 Torr, which is the pressure from a 76 cm column of mercury. But water is less dense, so the same pressure would require a taller column.

The density of mercury is about 13.6 g/cm³, and water is 1 g/cm³. So since pressure is ρgh, the height for water would be (density mercury / density water) times the height of mercury. So (13.6 /1 ) *76 cm = 1033.6 cm of water equals 1 atm, which is 760 Torr.

Wait, that means 1033.6 cm H2O = 760 Torr.

So 1 cm H2O is 760 /1033.6 Torr.

Let me compute 760 /1033.6.

Well, 760 ÷ 1033.6 is approximately 0.735 Torr/cm.

So for a 10 cm height difference, the pressure difference is 10 cm * 0.735 Torr/cm =7.35 Torr.

So the pressure in the apparatus would be P_app = P_atm + pressure difference.

Wait, but wait again. Since the apparatus is connected to the higher column, the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric by 10 cm of water, which is 7.35 Torr.

So P_app =770 Torr +7.35 Torr=777.35 Torr.

Wait, but wait. Because the open side is lower than the apparatus side. So the fluid is pushed down on the apparatus side, which means the apparatus's pressure is higher. So yes, P_app = P_atm + ρgh in Torr.

So 777.35 Torr.

But the options are in kPa, not Torr. So I need to convert 777.35 Torr to kPa.

We know that 1 atm is 760 Torr =101.325 kPa.

So 777.35 Torr is (777.35 /760) atm.

Compute that: 777.35 ÷760 ≈ 1.023.

So 1.023 atm. Multiply by 101.325 kPa/atm.

1.023 *101.325. Let me compute:

101.325 *1=101.325

101.325 *0.02=2.0265

101.325 *0.003=0.303975

Adding them up: 101.325 +2.0265=103.3515 +0.303975=103.6555 kPa.

Wait, so approximately 103.66 kPa.

Looking at the options, option A is 102 kPa, which is close. Hmm, but maybe my approximation of 0.735 Torr/cm is a rough value. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Alternative approach: Using SI units.

Compute ρgh in Pascals.

ρ_water =997.07 kg/m³.

g=9.8 m/s².

h=0.1 m.

P_water=997.07 *9.8 *0.1.

Compute 997.07 *9.8 first.

Compute 1000 *9.8=9800.

But 997.07 is 1000 -2.93.

So (1000-2.93)*9.8=9800 - (2.93*9.8).

2.93 *9.8: 2*9.8=19.6, 0.93*9.8= approx 9.114. So total 19.6 +9.114=28.714.

So 9800 -28.714=9771.286 Pa.

Multiply by h=0.1 m: 9771.286 *0.1=977.1286 Pa.

So P_water=977.13 Pa.

Now, atmospheric pressure is 770 Torr. Let's convert that to Pascals.

1 Torr = 101325/760 Pa.

So 770 Torr * (101325 Pa /760 Torr) =770 *101325 /760.

Compute 770/760 first: 770 ÷760=1.01315789.

So 1.01315789 *101325 Pa.

Compute 101325 *1.01315789.

Let me compute 101325 *1=101325.

101325 *0.01=1013.25.

101325 *0.003=303.975.

101325 *0.00015789= approx 101325 *0.00015=15.19875

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute 1.01315789 *101325.

Alternatively, 101325 *1.01316.

So 101325 *1=101325.

101325 *0.01316=?

Compute 101325 *0.01=1013.25

101325 *0.003=303.975

101325 *0.00016=16.212.

Adding: 1013.25 +303.975=1317.225 +16.212=1333.437.

So 101325 +1333.437=102658.437 Pa.

So 770 Torr =102658.437 Pa.

Now, the pressure in the apparatus is P_app= P_atm + P_water.

So 102658.437 Pa +977.1286 Pa=103635.5656 Pa.

Convert that to kPa by dividing by 1000: 103.6355656 kPa.

Approximately 103.6 kPa.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 102 kPa, but wait, that's 102, but 103.6 is closer to 104, which isn't an option. Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:102 kPa

B:88 kPa

C:130 kPa

D:120 kPa

E:97 kPa

F:115 kPa

G:85 kPa

H:110 kPa

I:92 kPa

J:105 kPa

Wait, I don't see 104. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me think again. The manometer measures the pressure difference between the apparatus and the atmosphere. So if the fluid is higher on the apparatus side, the pressure in the apparatus is higher by ρgh.

But wait, another way: the pressure in the apparatus is P_app = P_atm + (ρ_water * g * h).

Wait, but let's think in terms of the manometer equation. The pressure at the apparatus (P_app) is equal to the atmospheric pressure (P_atm) plus the pressure due to the height difference, which is ρgh.

So that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for P_atm. 770 Torr in Pa.

We have 1 Torr =101325/760 Pa.

So 770 Torr =770*(101325/760) Pa.

Compute 770 *101325 = ?

Wait, 770 *101325.

Let me compute 700 *101325 =70,927,500.

70 *101325=7,092,750.

So 700+70=770: 70,927,500 +7,092,750=78,020,250.

Wait, 700*101325=70,927,500.

70*101325=7,092,750.

So 70,927,500 +7,092,750=78,020,250.

Now, 78,020,250 /760 = let's compute that.

760 * 102658 = let me see:

760 *100,000=76,000,000.

760 *2,658=760*(2000+600+58) = 760*2000=1,520,000; 760*600=456,000; 760*58=44,080.

So 1,520,000+456,000=1,976,000 +44,080=2,020,080.

So 76,000,000 +2,020,080=78,020,080.

Wait, 760 *102,658 =78,020,080. But our numerator is 78,020,250, which is 170 more.

So 78,020,250 -78,020,080=170.

So 170/760≈0.22368.

So 102,658 +0.22368=102,658.22368 Pa.

So P_atm is 102,658.22 Pa.

Adding P_water: 977.13 Pa, so total P_app=103,635.35 Pa=103.635 kPa.

Hmm, but the options don't have 103.6. The closest is option A:102 kPa, but that's a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in h.

Wait, h is 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pressure in the apparatus is P_atm - P_water? No, that wouldn't make sense, because if the apparatus has higher pressure, it would push the water down, increasing the height on its side. So the higher pressure should add to the atmospheric pressure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other way around—like, if the open side is lower, maybe the pressure is lower? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me visualize the manometer.

Imagine the U-tube. The left side is connected to the apparatus, the right is open. If the pressure in the apparatus is higher, it would push the water down on the left side, making the water level lower on the left. That would cause the right side (open) to be higher. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if the pressure on the left (apparatus) is higher, the water level on the left would be lower. So the right side would be higher, meaning the water is higher on the right, which is the open side. So the question says the open side is 10 cm lower than the apparatus side. So the water on the open side is lower, meaning the water on the apparatus side is higher. So the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric.

So P_app = P_atm + ρgh.

Wait, but then my calculation gave around 103.6 kPa, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A:102 kPa

B:88 kPa

C:130 kPa

D:120 kPa

E:97 kPa

F:115 kPa

G:85 kPa

H:110 kPa

I:92 kPa

J:105 kPa

So 103.6 is not an option. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of Torr to Pascals. Let me recalculate 770 Torr.

1 Torr = 101325 /760 Pa.

So 770 Torr = 770 * (101325 /760).

Compute 770 *101325 = ?

770 *100,000=77,000,000.

770 *1,325= let's compute 770 *1,000=770,000; 770 *325= let's compute 770*300=231,000; 770*25=19,250. So 231,000 +19,250=250,250. So 770,000 +250,250=1,020,250.

So total 77,000,000 +1,020,250=78,020,250 Pa/Torr? No, wait, no. Wait, 770 is multiplied by 101325.

Wait, perhaps another approach: 770 Torr = (770/760) *101325 Pa.

770/760 = 1.0131578947.

So 1.0131578947 *101325 = ?

Let me compute this.

101325 *1.0131578947.

Let me break it down:

101325 *1 =101325.

101325 *0.01=1013.25.

101325 *0.0031578947≈?

Wait, 0.0031578947 is approximately 3/952 ≈0.00315.

So 101325 *0.00315= approx 101325 *0.003=303.975; 101325*0.00015≈15.19875.

So approx 303.975 +15.19875=319.17375.

So total: 101325 +1013.25=102,338.25 +319.17375≈102,657.42 Pa.

So P_atm=approx 102,657.42 Pa.

Adding P_water=977
