Question:

A mother took her five-year-old child to a hospital emergency room for treatment. A doctor on the hospital staff molested the child while treating her. At the time, no one was in the treatment room except the doctor and the child; the mother had left the room to get a cup of coffee. Two weeks later, when the child told her mother what had occurred in the treatment room, the mother suffered severe emotional distress that caused her to become physically ill. In an action against the doctor by the mother on her own behalf to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, is the mother likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the mother's emotional distress was not immediate and therefore cannot be attributed to the doctor's actions.
B: No, because the mother was contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment.
C: Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. 
D: Yes, because the mother was indirectly victimized by the doctor's actions.
E: No, because the mother did not directly suffer physical harm from the doctor's actions.
F: Yes, because the mother has a legal duty to protect her child and the doctor's actions violated that duty.
G: No, because the doctor's actions did not directly cause the mother's distress.
H: Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.
I: No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness.
J: Yes, because the mother was indirectly involved in the incident and suffered as a result.

Okay, I'm trying to work through this legal question. It's about a mother suing a doctor for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) after the doctor molested her child. The mother wasn't present when it happened; she found out two weeks later from her child. Now she's suing the doctor on her own behalf. I need to figure out if she's likely to win.

First, I remember that IIED is a tort that requires certain elements. I think the elements are: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions caused emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe.

So the doctor's action of molesting the child would definitely be intentional and outrageous. That part seems clear. The question is whether the mother can claim IIED as a bystander or someone affected by the actions against her child.

Wait, I think there's a rule about who can recover for IIED. Typically, the plaintiff needs to be the direct victim. But sometimes, bystanders can recover if they witnessed the event and were closely related to the victim. Like, if a parent sees their child get hurt, they might be able to claim IIED. But in this case, the mother wasn't there when it happened; she found out later. So does that affect her claim?

I remember a case called Thing v. La Chusa, where a mother found out her child was molested by a teacher and successfully sued for IIED. The court said that even though she wasn't present, the distress from learning about the molestation was sufficient because it was a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions. But I'm not sure if that's the majority rule or if it varies by jurisdiction.

Another point is whether the mother's distress was a direct result. Since she wasn't there, but the emotional impact was severe, does that count? Also, the IIED claim doesn't require physical harm, just severe emotional distress. So option E, which says she didn't suffer physical harm, might not be correct because physical harm isn't required.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because the distress wasn't immediate. But the question says two weeks later, but IIED doesn't require immediacy, just causation. So A might not be the right answer.

B: Contributory negligence? The mother left the child alone. But IIED doesn't require contributory negligence; it's about whether the defendant's actions were outrageous. So B is probably not correct.

C: Yes, because it's foreseeable. This is the Thing v. La Chusa reasoning. If the court finds that the distress was a natural consequence, she might win. So C is a possible answer.

D: Indirect victimization. I'm not sure if this is a standard legal test. It might be more about being a bystander or in a direct relationship.

E: No physical harm. As I thought earlier, physical harm isn't required, so E is incorrect.

F: Legal duty to protect. The doctor's action violated that duty. I'm not sure if that's the standard for IIED. The focus is more on the outrageous conduct causing distress, not a breach of duty to the mother.

G: No direct causation. But she claims the distress was caused by the doctor's action through her child. Courts might find that sufficient if it's foreseeable.

H: Conduct was outrageous. That's true, but that's just one element. The question is whether the mother can recover, not just whether the conduct was outrageous.

I: Not a direct victim or contemporaneous witness. This seems to align with the traditional rule. If the mother wasn't present and didn't witness it, maybe she can't recover. But some cases allow it if the relationship is close and the distress is severe.

J: Indirect involvement. Similar to D, not sure if that's the right standard.

I think the key is whether the mother can establish that her distress was a foreseeable result of the doctor's actions. In some jurisdictions, a parent can recover for IIED when their child is harmed, even if they weren't present, because the emotional impact is foreseeable.

So looking back at the options, C says yes because it was foreseeable. That aligns with cases like Thing v. La Chusa. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but some might argue that she wasn't a direct witness, so option I would say no. But I think the modern trend is to allow such claims if the relationship is close and the distress foreseeable. So I'm leaning towards C.

Alternatively, option G says the doctor's actions didn't directly cause her distress. But the distress was caused by the doctor's action through the child, so G might not be correct.

So I think the answer is C.

The question revolves around whether a mother can recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) after her child was molested by a doctor in her absence, and she learned about the incident two weeks later. To prevail, the mother must establish the elements of IIED: (1) intentional or reckless conduct, (2) extreme and outrageous behavior, (3) causation, and (4) severe emotional distress.

The doctor's actions were clearly intentional and outrageous, satisfying the first two elements. The key issue is whether the mother can recover as a bystander or indirect victim. Traditionally, IIED requires the plaintiff to be a direct victim or a contemporaneous witness to the outrageous conduct. However, some jurisdictions allow recovery for emotional distress caused by harm to a close family member, even if the plaintiff was not present, if the distress is a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions.

Option A is incorrect because IIED does not require immediacy of distress. Option B is incorrect because contributory negligence is not relevant to IIED claims. Option C aligns with cases like *Thing v. La Chusa*, where courts have allowed recovery for foreseeable emotional distress caused by harm to a child, even if the parent was not present. Option D is vague and not a standard legal test. Option E is incorrect because physical harm is not required for IIED. Option F misapplies the concept of legal duty, which is not the focus in IIED. Option G is incorrect because the distress was foreseeably caused by the doctor's actions. Option H correctly identifies outrageous conduct but does not address whether the mother can recover. Option I reflects the traditional rule but does not account for modern trends allowing recovery in such cases. Option J is vague and not a standard legal test.

The correct answer is C, as the mother's distress was a natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's outrageous conduct.

Answer: C
