Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about life insurance policies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about the difference in annual premiums for a $10,000 20-payment life policy purchased at age 30 versus age 20. The options are from A to J, each with a different dollar amount. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how life insurance premiums are calculated, but I remember that age is a significant factor. The older you are when you buy the policy, the higher the premiums, right? Because the insurance company is taking on more risk as you're older.

Wait, but wait, this is a 20-payment life policy. Oh, I think I've heard of something called a 20-payment life insurance. Let me recall. So, in a 20-payment life policy, the premiums are paid for 20 years, and the coverage continues for the lifetime, I think. Or maybe it's that the policy is paid up after 20 years. Either way, the key here is that the premium is calculated based on age, probably using actuarial tables or something like that.

So the question is asking, how much more would the annual premium be if you buy the policy at age 30 compared to age 20. So I need to find the difference in premiums between the two ages.

But wait, I don't have the actual premium amounts for each age. Hmm. I'm trying to remember if there's a standard way to calculate such things. Maybe using the concept of life insurance cost factors or something. Oh, right, the net level premium is based on the mortality rate, and it decreases as the person gets older because the insurer's risk increases.

Alternatively, I think that for each year of age, the premium increases by a certain amount. But without knowing the exact formula or the factors, this might be tricky. Wait, maybe the question is referring to a standard calculation method, like the one used in certain textbooks or examples.

I remember that in some examples, the annual premium for a 20-payment life policy at age 20 might be calculated as a certain amount, and at age 30, that amount increases. The difference between these two would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that can be applied here. Let me try to think of the formula for the annual premium of a life insurance policy. I think the formula for the annual premium (P) for a life insurance policy is based on the sum of the probabilities of dying in each year, multiplied by the face amount, divided by the present value factor for an annuity.

Wait, more accurately, the premium is calculated as the face amount times the sum of the probabilities of dying in each year, each discounted to the present value. Or perhaps it's the present value of the death benefit plus the present value of the premiums minus the cash value. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, for a 20-payment life policy, I think the premiums are paid for 20 years, but the coverage is for life. So the policy is paid up after 20 years, but you're covered for your entire life. So the premium calculation would involve determining the level annual payment that, when paid for 20 years, will cover the insurer's expected payout.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a specific mortality table, like the Society of Actuaries table, to compute the net level premium. The net level premium is calculated as the face amount divided by the present value of a life annuity (PVIFA) based on the interest rate and the mortality rates at each age.

Wait, but without knowing the interest rate or the specific mortality factors for each age, this might be a problem. Unless the question assumes a certain set of values, perhaps from a standard example.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the differences in annual premiums for a 20-year payment life policy at different ages. I think that when you buy a policy at a younger age, the annual premium is lower because you're paying over a longer period and the insurer has more time to accumulate funds. So, buying at age 20 would have lower premiums than buying at age 30.

But wait, the question is about the difference between purchasing at 30 and 20. So the premium at 30 is higher than at 20, and we're to find the difference.

I'm trying to think if I've seen any examples where the premium increases by a certain amount when the age increases by 10 years. But without specific numbers, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps each option corresponds to a certain increase based on a 10-year age difference. Let's look at the options. The options are:

A: $48.90

B: $40.05

C: $35.50

D: $75.20

E: $10.00

F: $58.30

G: $19.84

H: $63.10

I: $24.73

J: $12.65

These are all relatively small amounts, which makes sense because a $10,000 policy's premiums probably aren't too high. But I'm not sure which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps this is based on the mortality rates from a certain table. For example, the 20-payment life policy's annual premium could be calculated using the net level premium formula, which is:

P = (Face Amount * sum of v^t * q_{x+t} ) / sum of v^t * p_{x+t}

Where v is the discount factor (1/(1+i)), i is the interest rate, q is the probability of dying in year t, p is the probability of surviving until year t.

But without knowing the exact interest rate or the q values, I can't compute this. Maybe the question assumes an interest rate of, say, 5% or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a standard illustration where the difference is known. For example, I think that for a 20-year payment life policy, each year of age adds a certain amount to the premium. So, moving from age 20 to 30 would add 10 years, so maybe each year adds around $2 or $3, making the total difference around $20 to $30. Looking at the options, G is $19.84, I is $24.73. Those might be in the ballpark.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is smaller because the increase per year is less. Let me think. If at age 20, the premium is, say, $X, and at age 30 it's $X plus some amount. Let's say the difference is around $20. Looking at the options, G is about $20, I is $24, which could fit.

Alternatively, I remember that for term life insurance, the premium increases with age, but for whole life or 20-payment life, it's level. Wait, no, the 20-payment life is a type of whole life where you pay premiums for 20 years. The premiums are level, so the same each year, but the initial calculation would be based on your age at purchase.

Wait, maybe I should think about the present value of the death benefit and the present value of the premiums. The present value of the death benefit is the sum of v^t * q_{x+t} for t from 0 to infinity (since it's a life policy), but limited to t=0 to 19 because payments are made for 20 years? Wait, no, the policy is a 20-payment life, so the payments are made for 20 years, but the coverage is for life. So the PV of the death benefit would be the sum from t=0 to infinity of v^t * q_{x+t}, and the PV of the premiums is the sum from t=0 to 19 of v^t * P.

So the equation would be:

P * (sum from t=0 to 19 of v^t) = sum from t=0 to infinity of v^t * q_{x+t}

So P = [sum from t=0 to infinity of v^t * q_{x+t}] / [sum from t=0 to 19 of v^t]

But without knowing the exact q values and the interest rate, I can't compute this. Maybe the question assumes a certain interest rate, say 5%, and uses specific q values from a table.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference in annual premiums between age 30 and 20 is around $24.73, which is option I. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's say that for each year older, the premium increases by a certain amount. For example, from age 20 to 30, 10 years, and each year adds, say, $2.47 to the premium, making the total difference about $24.73, which is option I. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, $19.84, but I'm not certain. Another approach: let's think about the present value of an annuity factor. The present value of 20 payments is (1 - v^20)/i, where v is 1/(1+i). Let's assume an interest rate of 5%, so i=0.05, v=0.95238.

PVIFA = (1 - v^20)/i = (1 - 0.95238^20)/0.05. Let me compute 0.95238^20. 

0.95238^20 ≈ (approx) 0.358. So 1 - 0.358 = 0.642. 0.642 / 0.05 ≈ 12.84.

So the present value of 20 payments is about 12.84 per dollar of annual premium.

Now, the present value of the death benefit would be the sum of v^t * q_{x+t}, but without knowing q, it's hard. Wait, perhaps the present value of the death benefit is approximated as the sum of v^t from t=0 to infinity, which is 1/i = 20, but that doesn't make sense because that's the perpetuity formula. Hmm, no, because q decreases over time, the sum would be less than 20.

Alternatively, perhaps the net level premium is calculated as Face Amount / PVIFA. But that would be the case if mortality rates were zero, which they're not. So the actual PV of death benefit is less than Face Amount * (1/i), so the premium would be less than Face Amount / PVIFA.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the difference in annual premiums is calculated using standard actuarial factors.

Wait, I think I've heard that for each year you delay purchasing a life insurance policy, the premiums can increase by a certain percentage. For example, a 10-year difference might increase the premium by 20-30%. So, if at age 20 the premium is, say, $100 per year, at 30 it might be $120 to $130. So the difference would be $20 to $30, which would point towards options G ($19.84) or I ($24.73).

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the difference is about $25, which would match option I. But without exact numbers, it's hard.

Wait, maybe there's a formula or table that gives the exact factors. For example, the annual premium for a $10,000 20-payment life policy at age 20 might be $24.73, and at age 30, it's $44.46, making the difference $19.73, which is close to option G ($19.84). Alternatively, maybe the difference is $24.73, which would be option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the present value of the death benefit at age 20 and at age 30. The older you are, the higher the probability of death in the early years, so the present value of the death benefit increases, which would require a higher premium.

Wait, but the present value of the death benefit would be higher at older ages, so the numerator in the premium formula would be higher, leading to a higher P, which means higher premiums as you get older.

So, the difference in P between age 30 and 20 would be the increase due to higher mortality rates in the earlier years of the policy when purchased at 30.

But without knowing the exact factors, I'm not sure. Maybe I should take a guess based on the options. I think the correct answer is option I: $24.73.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option G: $19.84. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the difference in the present value of a life annuity. Oh wait, that's for the death benefit. Alternatively, perhaps the difference in the PVIFA factors. Let me compute the PVIFA for 20 years at 5% at age 20 and age 30.

Wait, no, the PVIFA is based on the number of payments, which is 20 years in both cases. So the PVIFA would be the same, which is 12.84 as I calculated earlier. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the mortality rates for the first 20 years when purchased at 30 are higher than when purchased at 20. So the sum of v^t * q_{x+t} from t=0 to infinity would be higher at age 30 than at age 20.

Therefore, P_30 = sum_30 / PVIFA, and P_20 = sum_20 / PVIFA. So the difference would be (sum_30 - sum_20)/PVIFA.

If I knew the values of sum_30 and sum_20, I could compute this. But without them, I can't.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is a standard value, and the correct answer is option G or I.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the annual premium at age 20 is $X, and at age 30, it's $X plus the cost of the additional risk for the higher age.

If I assume that the difference is due to the higher risk of death in the first 10 years when you're older, perhaps the difference is around $24, making option I ($24.73) the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe the difference is smaller. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the cost per thousand. If the policy is $10,000, perhaps the cost per thousand increases by a certain amount per year of age. So for 10 years, the increase would be 10 times that amount.

But without knowing the cost per thousand at each age, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G: $19.84, because it's close to a 20% increase on a $100 premium. Wait, but the question is about a $10,000 policy, so the absolute difference would be higher.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess. I think option I: $24.73 is the correct answer.

The question asks for the difference in annual premiums for a $10,000 20-payment life policy purchased at age 30 versus age 20. The key factor influencing the premiums is the insured's age, as older individuals represent a higher risk to the insurer. The premium calculation involves actuarial factors, including mortality rates and present value considerations, but the exact formula and data (e.g., interest rates, mortality tables) are not provided.

The analysis considers that the 20-payment life policy requires level annual premiums paid for 20 years, with coverage continuing for life. The premium increases with age due to higher mortality risks. The difference in premiums between age 30 and age 20 is expected to be moderate, as the policy's structure spreads the cost over 20 years.

After evaluating the options and considering plausible increases in premiums due to aging, the most reasonable estimate for the difference is **$24.73**, corresponding to option I. This aligns with the expectation that the premium increase for a 10-year age difference would be in this range.

Answer: I
