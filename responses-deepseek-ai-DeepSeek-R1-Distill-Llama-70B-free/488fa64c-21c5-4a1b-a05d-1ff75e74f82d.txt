Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. It's about entropy change when mixing water at different temperatures. Hmm, I remember that entropy change has to do with heat transfer and temperature. Let me see what the question is exactly.

The problem states: 100 grams of water at 0°C are mixed with 50 grams of water at 50°C. I need to find the change in entropy due to this mixing. The options are from A to J, each with different values in cal/(K·deg) or something like that. Wait, cal/K is more likely, since entropy is in units of energy per temperature, like J/K or cal/K.

I think the key here is to calculate the entropy change for each part of the system—the hot water cooling down and the cold water warming up. Because when they mix, heat will transfer from the warmer water to the cooler water until they reach the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. Wait, water at 0°C? Oh, right, that's ice at the melting point. But since it's water, maybe it's just liquid water at 0°C. Or does it include melting? Hmm, the question says 100g of water at 0°C, so I think it's already in liquid form, so no phase change here. So both are liquid water, just at different temperatures.

So the process is mixing two quantities of water at different temperatures. The final temperature will be somewhere between 0 and 50, depending on the masses. Since the masses are different, the final T isn't just the average.

I remember that entropy change (ΔS) is calculated using the formula ΔS = Q_rev / T, where Q_rev is the heat transferred in a reversible process, and T is the absolute temperature at which this happens.

But in this case, the heat transfer isn't reversible because it's an irreversible process—mixing the two. However, to calculate the entropy change, we can consider the heat that each part would exchange when going from their initial temperatures to the final equilibrium temperature.

So first, I need to find the final temperature after mixing. Let's do that.

The formula for heat transfer when two substances exchange heat is:

m1 * c * (T_final - T1) + m2 * c * (T_final - T2) = 0

Wait, no. Because heat lost by the hot water equals heat gained by the cold water, assuming no heat loss to the surroundings. So:

m1 * c * (T_final - T1) + m2 * c * (T_final - T2) = 0

Wait, no, actually it's:

m1*c*(T_final - T1) = -m2*c*(T_final - T2)

But since the changes are opposite in sign, perhaps more accurately:

Heat lost by hot = heat gained by cold.

So, m2 * c * (T_final - T2) = -m1 * c * (T_final - T1)

Wait, maybe it's better to write:

m1 * c * (T_final - T1) + m2 * c * (T_final - T2) = 0

Because the sum of heat changes should be zero (assuming no heat loss).

So, let me plug in the values.

Given:
m1 = 100 g (water at 0°C)
m2 = 50 g (water at 50°C)
c for water is approximately 1 cal/(g·°C) because the specific heat capacity of water is about 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius.

So,

100 * 1 * (Tf - 0) + 50 * 1 * (Tf - 50) = 0

Simplify:

100 Tf + 50 Tf - 2500 = 0

Combine like terms:

150 Tf = 2500

Tf = 2500 / 150 ≈ 16.666... °C

So the final temperature is approximately 16.67°C.

Now, I need to calculate the entropy change for each part.

For the hot water (50°C to 16.67°C), which is cooling down, the entropy change ΔS_hot will be negative because it's losing heat.

For the cold water (0°C warming to 16.67°C), the entropy change ΔS_cold will be positive.

The total entropy change is ΔS_total = ΔS_hot + ΔS_cold.

Wait, but I've heard that in such processes, the total entropy change is the sum of each part's entropy change.

But how do I compute each ΔS?

The formula for entropy change when temperature changes is ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial), but wait, wait. No, because if you're changing the temperature, the correct formula is integrating dQ_rev / T. For a temperature change from T1 to T2, the entropy change is m c ln(T2 / T1), but only if the process is reversible, which it's not in this case. However, for calculation purposes, we can model the entropy change as if each infinitesimal heat transfer is reversible.

Wait, but actually, the correct formula for entropy change when heating or cooling a substance is:

ΔS = m c ∫ (1/T) dT from T_initial to T_final.

Which integrates to m c ln(T_final / T_initial) when c is constant.

Wait, but wait—this is correct only when the temperature change is infinitesimal and the process is reversible. But in reality, the process is irreversible, but we can still calculate the entropy change using this formula because entropy is a state function, so the path doesn't matter—only the initial and final states.

So yes, I can use ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial) for each part.

But wait, I have to convert the temperatures to Kelvin because entropy equations require absolute temperature.

Right. So let's convert each temperature to Kelvin.

T_hot_initial = 50°C = 323.15 K
T_cold_initial = 0°C = 273.15 K
T_final = 16.6667°C ≈ 289.8167 K

Now, compute ΔS for each part.

First, the hot water (50°C to 16.67°C):

ΔS_hot = m2 * c * ln(T_final / T_hot_initial)
= 50 g * 1 cal/(g·°C) * ln(289.8167 / 323.15)

Calculate the ratio: 289.8167 / 323.15 ≈ 0.8973

ln(0.8973) ≈ -0.1077

So ΔS_hot ≈ 50 * 1 * (-0.1077) ≈ -5.385 cal/K

Wait, wait. Wait, the units: 50 g * (1 cal/g°C) * (unitless from ln). So the units would be cal/(g·°C) * g * (unitless), so cal/°C. But since we're dealing with entropy, which is in cal/K, I think that's okay because the change in temperature is in Kelvin, which is same as °C in terms of intervals.

Wait, no. Actually, the temperature in the logarithm must be in absolute terms (Kelvin), but the ratio remains the same as if they were in °C because the difference is just an offset. So the ln(289.8/323.15) is correct.

So ΔS_hot ≈ 50 * (-0.1077) ≈ -5.385 cal/K

Wait, wait. Wait a second, no, because the formula gives entropy change in cal/K. Because the specific heat is in cal/(g·K), since a change of 1°C is the same as 1 K. Oh wait, no. Because in the formula, the integral is (1/T) dT, which is in 1/K, so the units of ΔS would be (cal/g·K) * g * (unitless from ln), so cal/K.

Wait, yes, because c is in cal/(g·K), since a calorie is energy, and K is temperature. So when you multiply by g, it's cal/(K), so ΔS is in cal/K.

So for the hot water, ΔS_hot is negative because it's losing heat.

Now, the cold water (0°C to 16.67°C):

ΔS_cold = m1 * c * ln(T_final / T_cold_initial)
= 100 g * 1 cal/(g·K) * ln(289.8167 / 273.15)

Compute the ratio: 289.8167 / 273.15 ≈ 1.0612

ln(1.0612) ≈ 0.0593

So ΔS_cold ≈ 100 * 0.0593 ≈ 5.93 cal/K

Now, the total entropy change is the sum of both:

ΔS_total = ΔS_hot + ΔS_cold
≈ (-5.385) + 5.93 ≈ 0.545 cal/K

Wait, that would be approximately 0.545 cal/K. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A: 0.8
B: 0.5
C: 0.3
D: 0.2
E: 0.1
F: 0.7
G: 0.6
H:1.5
I:0.9
J:1

So 0.545 is approximately 0.5 or 0.5 cal/K.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ln values. Let me recheck the calculations.

Compute ln(289.8167/323.15) first.

289.8167 /323.15 = approximately 0.8973.

ln(0.8973) is about -0.1077. So 50 * (-0.1077) = -5.385.

Then, for the cold water:

289.8167 /273.15 = approximately 1.0612.

ln(1.0612) is approximately 0.05926.

100 * 0.05926 = 5.926.

Adding the two: 5.926 -5.385 = 0.541. So approximately 0.54 cal/K.

Looking at the options, the closest is B:0.5, or perhaps F:0.7? Wait, 0.54 is closer to 0.5 than to 0.6. So option B.

But wait, another approach: some textbooks might consider using the heat transfer and average temperature, but I think the method I used is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the entropy change using the heat transferred divided by the temperature at which it is transferred. But that's more complicated because heat transfer occurs over a range of temperatures.

Wait, the formula I used (m c ln(Tf / Ti)) is correct for the entropy change when a substance is heated or cooled, regardless of the process reversibility, because entropy is a state function.

So the calculation seems correct. So the total entropy change is approximately 0.54 cal/K, which would be closest to option B:0.5 cal/K/deg. Wait, but the options' units are a bit unclear. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says, "change of entropy on mixing?" So the total is about 0.54, so 0.5 is the closest. So the answer should be B.

But wait, I should make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the ln values more accurately.

Compute ln(289.8167 /323.15):

289.8167 /323.15 = 0.8973.

ln(0.8973) = let's see, ln(0.9) is about -0.10536. Let me compute exactly:

Using a calculator, ln(0.8973) is approximately -0.1077.

Similarly, ln(1.0612):

I know that ln(1.06) is about 0.05827, and ln(1.0612) is a bit higher. Let me compute it.

Using a calculator approximation: ln(1.0612) is approximately 0.0593.

So the calculations are correct.

So 0.54, which is 0.5 when rounded. So the correct answer is B:0.5 cal/K/deg.

Wait, but let me check the units in the options. They say cal/K/deg. That seems a bit odd, but I think it's a typo, and it's meant to be cal/(K·deg), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's cal/(K). Because entropy is in units of energy per temperature, which is cal/K.

So the options probably have a typo, but regardless, the numerical value is what matters. So 0.5 is option B.

To determine the change in entropy when 100 g of water at 0°C is mixed with 50 g of water at 50°C, we calculate the entropy changes for both the hot and cold water as they reach the final equilibrium temperature. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Calculate the final temperature (T_final):**  
   Using the principle of conservation of energy, the heat lost by the hot water equals the heat gained by the cold water. The formula is:  
   \[
   m_1 c (T_{\text{final}} - T_1) + m_2 c (T_{\text{final}} - T_2) = 0
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   100 \cdot 1 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 0) + 50 \cdot 1 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 50) = 0
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   100 T_{\text{final}} + 50 T_{\text{final}} - 2500 = 0
   \]  
   \[
   150 T_{\text{final}} = 2500 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_{\text{final}} \approx 16.67^\circ \text{C}
   \]  

2. **Convert temperatures to Kelvin:**  
   \[
   T_{\text{hot initial}} = 50^\circ \text{C} = 323.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{\text{cold initial}} = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{\text{final}} \approx 16.67^\circ \text{C} = 289.82 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. **Calculate entropy changes using the formula:**  
   The entropy change for a temperature change is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta S = m c \ln\left(\frac{T_{\text{final}}}{T_{\text{initial}}}\right)
   \]  
   - For the hot water (50°C to 16.67°C):  
     \[
     \Delta S_{\text{hot}} = 50 \cdot 1 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{289.82}{323.15}\right)
     \]  
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{289.82}{323.15}\right) \approx \ln(0.8973) \approx -0.1077
     \]  
     \[
     \Delta S_{\text{hot}} \approx 50 \cdot (-0.1077) \approx -5.385 \, \text{cal/K}
     \]

   - For the cold water (0°C to 16.67°C):  
     \[
     \Delta S_{\text{cold}} = 100 \cdot 1 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{289.82}{273.15}\right)
     \]  
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{289.82}{273.15}\right) \approx \ln(1.0612) \approx 0.0593
     \]  
     \[
     \Delta S_{\text{cold}} \approx 100 \cdot 0.0593 \approx 5.93 \, \text{cal/K}
     \]

4. **Total entropy change:**  
   \[
   \Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_{\text{hot}} + \Delta S_{\text{cold}}
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta S_{\text{total}} \approx -5.385 + 5.93 \approx 0.545 \, \text{cal/K}
   \]

5. **Select the closest option:**  
   The calculated entropy change is approximately \( 0.545 \, \text{cal/K} \), which is closest to \( 0.5 \, \text{cal/K} \). Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 0.5 cal/K/deg**.
