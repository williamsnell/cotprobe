Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two observers and light flashes. Hmm, I think it's related to special relativity because it involves observers in motion relative to each other and simultaneity. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the setup is, there's an observer O who's at rest midway between two light sources. The sources are at x=0 and x=10 meters. O sees both flashes at the same time. Now, there's another observer O' moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis. For O', one flash happens 13 nanoseconds before the other. I need to find the speed of O' relative to O from the given options.

Wait, okay. So in O's frame, since the sources are 10 meters apart and O is in the middle, each source is 5 meters away. Since light travels at c, the time for each flash to reach O would be distance over speed. So time t = 5m / c. Let me compute that: c is about 3e8 m/s. So 5/(3e8) is approximately 1.666e-8 seconds, which is 16.66 nanoseconds. Wait, but O sees them simultaneously, so both flashes must have been emitted at the same time in O's frame.

Now, O' is moving relative to O. Because of this, O' won't see the flashes as simultaneous. The question is, which one flashes first and by how much. The problem says that in O's frame, both events happen at the same time, but in O's' frame, one happens before the other. The time difference is 13 nanoseconds.

I remember that in special relativity, the simultaneity of events depends on the observer's frame. The events are simultaneous for O but not for O'. So I should probably use the concept of the relativity of simultaneity here.

Wait, but wait, what about the Lorentz transformation? Because that's how events' coordinates transform between frames. The Lorentz transformations relate the space and time coordinates of events in different inertial frames.

So the two events are: Flash at x=0 and t=0 (since both happen at the same time for O), and Flash at x=10m and t=0.

Wait no, wait. In O's frame, both flashes happen at t=0. So the two events are (t=0, x1=0) and (t=0, x2=10). Now, O' is moving at velocity v relative to O. I need to find what v is such that the time difference between the two events in O's frame is 13 ns.

Wait, no. Because in O's frame, both events are simultaneous, but in O's' frame, they're not. So the time difference between the two events in O's' frame is 13 ns. So I need to compute the Lorentz transformation for each event and find the time difference.

So the Lorentz transformations are:

t' = γ (t - (v x)/c² )
x' = γ (x - v t)

But in O's frame, t=0 for both events. So for the first event (x=0, t=0):

t'1 = γ (0 - (v *0)/c² ) = 0
x'1 = γ (0 - 0 ) = 0

Wait, that can't be right. Because for the first event, everything is zero. So in O's' frame, this event happens at (t'=0, x'=0). But wait, the second event is at x=10, t=0.

So for the second event (x=10, t=0):

t'2 = γ (0 - (v * 10)/c² ) = - γ (10 v ) / c²
x'2 = γ (10 - 0 ) = 10 γ

So the time difference between the two events in O's' frame is t'2 - t'1. But t'1 is zero, so Δt' = t'2 - 0 = - (10 v γ ) / c².

Wait, but wait. The problem says that one flash occurs before the other by 13 ns. So the absolute value of Δt' is 13 ns. So |Δt'| = 13e-9 seconds.

So, | - (10 v γ ) / c² | = 13e-9 s

Which simplifies to (10 v γ ) / c² = 13e-9 s.

Because time difference is positive in magnitude.

So let me write this equation:

(10 v γ ) / c² = 13e-9 s.

Now, I need to solve for v. But γ is the Lorentz factor, which depends on v. γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So substituting γ into the equation:

10 v / (c² sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) ) = 13e-9

Hmm. That's a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify this.

Let me let β = v/c, so that v = β c. Then, substituting into the equation:

10 (β c) / ( c² sqrt(1 - β²) ) ) = 13e-9

Simplify numerator and denominator:

10 β c / (c² sqrt(1 - β^2)) ) = 10 β / (c sqrt(1 - β^2)) ) 

Set that equal to 13e-9:

10 β / (c sqrt(1 - β²) ) ) = 13e-9

Let me rearrange this:

β / sqrt(1 - β²) = (13e-9 * c ) / 10

Compute the right-hand side.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So:

(13e-9 s * 3e8 m/s ) /10 = (13 * 3e-1 ) / 10 = 39e-2 /10 = 3.9e-1 / 1 = 0.39.

Wait wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

13e-9 * 3e8 = 13 * 3e(-9+8) ) = 39e-1 = 3.9. Then divide by 10: 3.9/10=0.39.

So the equation becomes:

β / sqrt(1 - β^2) = 0.39.

Hmm, let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

β² / (1 - β²) ) = (0.39)^2 ≈ 0.1521.

So, β^2 = 0.1521 (1 - β^2 )

Expanding:

β^2 = 0.1521 - 0.1521 β^2

Bring terms together:

β^2 + 0.1521 β^2 = 0.1521

So, β^2 (1 + 0.1521 ) = 0.1521

1 + 0.1521 is 1.1521.

So β² = 0.1521 / 1.1521 ≈ let's compute that.

0.1521 / 1.1521 ≈ 0.132. So β^2 ≈ 0.132, so β ≈ sqrt(0.132) ≈ 0.363.

Wait, wait, let me compute sqrt(0.132). 0.36^2 is 0.1296. 0.363^2=0.1318. So about 0.363.

So β is approximately 0.363 c.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because the options don't have 0.36 exactly, but option G is 0.36c.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.

Wait, let's retrace.

We had:

Δt' = 13e-9 s = (10 v γ )/c^2.

Then substituting v=β c and γ=1/sqrt(1-β²):

10 β c / (c² sqrt(1-β²) ) ) = 13e-9.

Which simplifies to 10 β / (c sqrt(1-β^2) )) = 13e-9.

Then, rearrange, β / sqrt(1 - β²) = (13e-9 c ) /10.

Compute 13e-9 *3e8 = 13 *3 *1e-1 = 39 *0.1=3.9. Then divide by 10: 0.39.

So the equation is β / sqrt(1-β²) = 0.39.

Square both sides: β²/(1-β²) = 0.1521.

So cross multiply: β²=0.1521 (1-β²) → β²=0.1521 −0.1521 β² → β² +0.1521 β²=0.1521 → β² (1 +0.1521 )=0.1521 → β²= 0.1521 / 1.1521.

Compute 0.1521 /1.1521. Let me do this division more accurately.

1.1521 × 0.132 = let's see. 1.1521 * 0.13 = 0.15 (approx), but perhaps a better way.

Alternatively, 0.1521 ÷ 1.1521 ≈ 0.132.

So β^2 is 0.132, so β is about 0.363.

So v is 0.363 c, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A:0.60c

B:0.10c

C:0.40c

D:0.45c

E:0.53c

F:0.15c

G:0.36c

H:0.13c

I:0.25c

J:0.50c

So 0.36c is option G.

Wait, but wait. When I computed β ≈0.363, which is approximately 0.36. But let me see if the exact value gives precisely 0.36.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.1521 / 1.1521 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.1521 × 0.132 =?

1 ×0.132=0.132

0.15 × 0.132=0.0198

0.0021 ×0.132≈0.000277

So sum: 0.132 + 0.0198=0.1518 +0.000277≈0.152077. Which is very close to 0.1521. So yes, 0.132 is correct.

So β= sqrt(0.132)= approximately 0.363, which is about 0.36c. So option G.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because when the observer is moving, the time difference could be positive or negative depending on the direction of motion. But in the problem, the time difference is 13 ns. So in our equation, we took the absolute value, so the speed is positive.

But wait, another thought. The first event is at x=0, the second at x=10 m. So if O' is moving in the positive x direction, then which event would occur first in O's' frame?

Because in O's frame, the light from both sources reach O at the same time, but for O' moving, say, to the right (positive x), the flash from x=10 would have to catch up less than the flash from x=0, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, in O's frame, when O' moves to the right at speed v, then from O's perspective, O' is approaching the source at x=10 m and moving away from the source at x=0 m. So for O', the light from x=10 would have a shorter distance to catch up, perhaps arriving earlier.

Wait, but in terms of simultaneity, the events in O's frame are simultaneous, but in O's' frame, they are not. So in O's' frame, the event at x=10 will occur earlier if O' is moving towards it, right? Because O' is moving towards x=10, so the light from x=10 doesn't have to travel as far in O's' frame.

Wait, no. Wait, when O' is moving towards the right (towards x=10), then the distance between the sources in O's' frame is contracted. But perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about which event happens first in O's' frame.

In O's frame, both events happen at t=0. If O' is moving along the x-axis, say in the positive direction, then in O's' frame, the events will have different times.

Wait, let's think about the Lorentz transformation. The event at x=0, t=0 in O's frame will have t' = γ (0 - v*0/c² )=0, x'= γ(0 - v*0 )=0.

The event at x=10, t=0 in O's frame will have t' = γ (0 - v*10/c² )= - (10 v γ ) / c².

So in O's' frame, the event at x=10 occurs at t' negative, which is earlier than the event at x=0, which is at t'=0. So for O', the flash at x=10 occurs before the flash at x=0. Wait, but the problem states that in O', one source flashes before the other by 13 ns. So the time difference is t'2 - t'1 = (-10v γ/c²) - 0 = -10v γ/c². The magnitude is 10v γ/c², which is 13e-9 s.

So, in our calculation, we considered the magnitude and arrived at v≈0.36 c, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check for any possible miscalculations. Let me recalculate the numerical steps.

We had:

(10 v γ ) / c² = 13e-9 s.

With v=β c, and γ=1/sqrt(1-β²).

So the equation becomes:

10 β c * (1/sqrt(1-β²)) ) / c² = 13e-9.

Simplify:

10 β / (c sqrt(1-β²)) ) =13e-9.

Compute 13e-9 * c = 13e-9 * 3e8 = 3900.

Wait, 13e-9 *3e8 = 13 *3 *1e(-9 +8) )= 39 * 1e-1=3.9.

So:

10 β / (sqrt(1-β²)) ) = 3.9.

Wait, no. Because in the equation, it's 10 β / (c sqrt(1-β^2)) ) = 13e-9.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's correct that step.

Wait, in the equation:

10 β / (c sqrt(1-β^2)) ) = 13e-9.

Because when I substituted, it was [10 β ] / [c sqrt(1-β²) ].

So 10 β = 13e-9 * c * sqrt(1-β²).

Wait, that's perhaps a better way. So let's write that:

10 β = (13e-9 ) * c * sqrt(1 - β² )

But then substituting c=3e8 m/s, we get:

10 β = 13e-9 * 3e8 * sqrt(1 - β² )

Compute 13e-9 *3e8: 13 *3 =39, 1e-9 *1e8=1e-1. So 39 * 1e-1=3.9.

So:

10 β = 3.9 * sqrt(1 -β² )

Divide both sides by 10:

β = 0.39 sqrt(1 - β² )

Now, square both sides:

β² = (0.39)^2 (1 - β² )

β² = 0.1521 (1 - β² )

Expand:

β² = 0.1521 - 0.1521 β²

Bring terms together:

β² + 0.1521 β² = 0.1521

β² (1 + 0.1521 ) = 0.1521

β² = 0.1521 / 1.1521 ≈ 0.132.

So β ≈ sqrt(0.132) ≈ 0.363 c.

So v≈0.363 c, which is approximately 0.36c, which is option G.

So I think the correct answer is G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity, specifically the relativity of simultaneity and the Lorentz transformation. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Setup in Observer O's Frame**:  
   Observer O is at rest midway between two light sources located at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 10 \, \text{m}\). Both sources flash simultaneously in O's frame, meaning the events are \((t = 0, x = 0)\) and \((t = 0, x = 10)\).

2. **Observer O' Moving Relative to O**:  
   Observer O' moves at a constant velocity \(v\) parallel to the x-axis. Due to the relativity of simultaneity, the two flashes are not simultaneous in O's' frame. The problem states that one flash occurs 13 ns before the other in O's' frame.

3. **Lorentz Transformation**:  
   The Lorentz transformations relate the coordinates of events in different frames:
   \[
   t' = \gamma \left(t - \frac{v x}{c^2}\right), \quad x' = \gamma \left(x - v t\right),
   \]
   where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\) is the Lorentz factor.

   For the two events in O's frame:
   - For \((t = 0, x = 0)\):  
     \(t'_1 = \gamma (0 - 0) = 0\), \(x'_1 = \gamma (0 - 0) = 0\).
   - For \((t = 0, x = 10)\):  
     \(t'_2 = \gamma \left(0 - \frac{v \cdot 10}{c^2}\right) = -\frac{10 v \gamma}{c^2}\), \(x'_2 = \
