Okay, so I've got this question about ring theory, specifically dealing with integral domains and polynomial rings. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate their truthfulness. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J.

Starting with Statement 1: "If R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain." 

Wait, an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors, right? So, if R is an integral domain, does that mean the polynomial ring R[x] is also an integral domain?

I remember that polynomial rings over integral domains have some nice properties. Oh, right! In R[x], if you have two non-zero polynomials f and g, their product can't be zero because the leading terms multiply to a non-zero term. Since R has no zero divisors, the product of the leading coefficients is non-zero, so the product polynomial can't be zero. So R[x] should indeed be an integral domain if R is. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: "If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x)."

Hmm, this feels familiar but I'm not sure. I think this holds under certain conditions. Like, in a ring where there are no zero divisors, or maybe when the ring is an integral domain. Because if R had zero divisors, then the degrees might not add up. Wait, let me think. The degree of a product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees if the leading coefficients don't become zero when multiplied. So if R is an integral domain, then the leading coefficients multiply to a non-zero element, so deg(fg) = deg f + deg g. But if R isn't an integral domain, like if it has zero divisors, then the product of the leading terms could be zero even if neither f nor g is zero. For example, suppose R has elements a and b where ab=0 but a≠0 and b≠0. Then f = a x and g = b, their product is 0, which has undefined degree, but if we consider it as -infinity or something, it's not equal to 1 + 0 =1. So in that case, the degree doesn't add up. 

So Statement 2 is only necessarily true if R is an integral domain. But the statement says "if R is a ring"—so without any assumptions on R. Therefore, Statement 2 isn't always true. It's only true under certain conditions. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait another moment. Suppose R is a ring with zero divisors. Let me construct an example. Let R = Z/6Z, which has zero divisors (like 2*3=0). Let f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3. Then f(x)*g(x) = (2x)(3) = 6x = 0 in R[x], since 6 mod 6 is 0. So the product is the zero polynomial. The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined or sometimes considered as -∞. So in this case, deg(fg) is undefined, which is not equal to deg f + deg g, which is 1 + 0 = 1. Hence, the equality fails. So Statement 2 is not always true if R is an arbitrary ring. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Looking at the options, option C says "True, False", which would be correct. Let me double-check the options: option C is "True, False". Yep, that's what I have.

Statement 1: If \( R \) is an integral domain, then \( R[x] \) is an integral domain.  
An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. If \( R \) is an integral domain, then \( R[x] \), the polynomial ring over \( R \), also has no zero divisors. This is because the product of two non-zero polynomials in \( R[x] \) cannot be zero, as the leading terms multiply to a non-zero element (since \( R \) has no zero divisors). Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

Statement 2: If \( R \) is a ring and \( f(x), g(x) \in R[x] \), then \( \deg(f(x)g(x)) = \deg f(x) + \deg g(x) \).  
This statement is not necessarily true for arbitrary rings \( R \). While it holds if \( R \) is an integral domain (since the leading coefficients of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) multiply to a non-zero element), it fails if \( R \) has zero divisors. For example, in \( R = \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} \), which has zero divisors, taking \( f(x) = 2x \) and \( g(x) = 3 \), their product is the zero polynomial, whose degree is undefined or not equal to \( \deg f(x) + \deg g(x) \). Thus, Statement 2 is **False**.

Based on this analysis, the correct option is **C: True, False**.
