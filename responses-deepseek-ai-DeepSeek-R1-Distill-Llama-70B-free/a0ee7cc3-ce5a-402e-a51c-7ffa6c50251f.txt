Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll just start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the mass fraction of a fluorine atom that's contained in the nucleus and then determining the fraction of the atomic volume occupied by the nucleus. There are two parts here. The answer options are A to J, each with two numbers.

First, let's tackle the mass fraction part. The problem gives me the masses of a proton and an electron. Proton is 1.00728 u, and electron is 0.000549 u. Fluorine has 9 protons and 9 electrons. So, I guess I need to calculate the total mass of the protons and electrons and then find out what fraction of the total atomic mass is just the nucleus (which is protons and neutrons, right?).

Wait, wait. Fluorine's atomic number is 9, which means it has 9 protons and 9 electrons. But the nucleus includes protons and neutrons. Oh, right, the mass number A for fluorine is 19, I think. Because Fluorine-19 is the most common isotope. So the nucleus has 9 protons and 10 neutrons (since 9+10=19).

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the isotope. Oh, but it just says a fluorine atom, so I'll assume it's the common one with 19 nucleons. So nucleus mass is protons plus neutrons. But wait, the mass of a neutron is almost the same as a proton, right? Proton is about 1.00728 u, and neutron is about 1.00866 u. Hmm, but the problem only gives the proton and electron masses. Oh wait, maybe for this problem, they approximate the neutron mass as the same as the proton? Or perhaps they just use the mass number times the proton mass? Or maybe they are ignoring the neutron mass difference.

Wait, the question says "the masses of a proton and an electron are equal to..." but doesn't give neutron mass. So perhaps in this problem, the nucleus mass is calculated using only the protons, and then adding the neutrons as if they have the same mass as protons. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.

Wait, the fluorine nucleus has 9 protons and 10 neutrons. So the total mass of the nucleus would be 9*(proton mass) + 10*(neutron mass). But wait, the problem gives the proton mass as 1.00728 u and the electron as 0.000549 u. But where does the neutron's mass come into play? Oh wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things and using the mass number (A=19) multiplied by the proton mass, which might not be entirely accurate but perhaps that's what they expect here.

Wait, maybe I should proceed differently. The problem says to find the mass fraction contained in the nucleus. So the total mass of the atom is the sum of the protons, neutrons, and electrons. But wait, electrons have much smaller mass, but they're part of the atom's total mass. However, the nucleus is only protons and neutrons.

So, the mass of the nucleus (M_nucleus) is 9*(m_proton) + 10*(m_neutron). But since the problem doesn't give m_neutron, maybe I'm supposed to ignore it and just use protons and electrons? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the mass of the nucleus as approximately the sum of the protons and neutrons, using the mass number (A=19) times the proton mass? Hmm.

Wait, but let's think of it this way: The total mass of the fluorine atom is the sum of the masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons. But in reality, the mass of the atom is approximately the mass of the nucleus (protons + neutrons) plus the electrons. But wait, electrons are much lighter, so their contribution is small. But when given the mass of the proton and electron, I think the approach is to calculate the nucleus mass and the total atomic mass.

Wait, let me get this straight. The problem is asking for the mass fraction contained in the nucleus. So that's (mass of nucleus) / (total mass of atom) * 100%.

So, the total mass of the atom is the sum of protons, neutrons, and electrons. But wait, the problem doesn't give the neutron mass. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem gives the mass of the proton and the electron, perhaps it's expecting me to calculate the nucleus mass as (number of protons * proton mass) plus (number of neutrons * proton mass). Because without the neutron mass, perhaps they're assuming protons and neutrons have the same mass.

Wait, but that's not accurate. The neutron is slightly heavier, but maybe for this problem, that level of detail isn't considered. So, let's proceed with that assumption.

So, number of protons (Z) =9, number of neutrons (N)=10. So, nucleus mass = 9*(1.00728) + 10*(1.00728) = 19*(1.00728) u. Because protons and neutrons are treated as same mass.

But wait, no, that would make the nucleus mass 19 * 1.00728 u. Then, the electrons are 9 * 0.000549 u.

So total atomic mass is nucleus mass plus electrons: 19*1.00728 + 9*0.000549.

Wait, but wait. The actual atomic mass of fluorine is about 19 u, right? Because protons and neutrons together. But let me compute it step by step.

Compute nucleus mass: 9 * 1.00728 + 10 * (mass of neutron). But since mass of neutron isn't given, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore it and use just protons, or use an average?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simplified model where the nucleus mass is Z * m_proton + N * m_proton. So, that would be (Z+N) * m_proton = A * m_proton. So for A=19, m_nucleus = 19 * 1.00728 u.

Then, the electrons contribute 9 * 0.000549 u.

So the total atomic mass is 19 * 1.00728 + 9 * 0.000549.

Compute that:

19 * 1.00728 = let's compute that. 1.00728 * 20 is 20.1456, subtract 1.00728 gives 19.13832 u.

Electrons: 9 * 0.000549 = 0.004941 u.

So total mass = 19.13832 + 0.004941 = 19.143261 u.

Nucleus mass is 19.13832 u.

So the mass fraction is (19.13832) / (19.143261) ≈ let's compute that.

Compute numerator and denominator:

19.13832 / 19.143261 ≈ Let's compute 19.13832 ÷ 19.143261.

Well, 19.13832 is just a bit less than 19.143261. Let's compute the division:

19.13832 / 19.143261 ≈ 0.999455 (approximately). Let me check with a calculator:

19.13832 ÷ 19.143261 = 

Let me compute 19.13832 ÷ 19.143261:

= (19.143261 - 0.004941) / 19.143261

= 1 - (0.004941 / 19.143261)

0.004941 / 19.143261 ≈ 0.0002583

So 1 - 0.0002583 ≈ 0.9997417.

Wait, wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because 19.13832 is less than 19.143261, so the fraction would be less than 1. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 19.143261 minus 19.13832 is 0.004941. So the numerator is 19.13832, which is 0.004941 less than the denominator.

So 19.13832 / 19.143261 = 1 - (0.004941 / 19.143261)

0.004941 divided by 19.143261 is approximately 0.004941 / 19.143 ≈ 0.0002583.

So 1 - 0.0002583 = 0.9997417.

Wait, that gives about 0.99974, which is 99.974%. But looking at the options, option D is 0.9994553, which is about 99.94%, which is lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 19.13832 divided by 19.143261 again.

Let me write it as:

19.13832 / 19.143261 = ?

Let me compute this division.

We can write it as (19.143261 - 0.004941) / 19.143261 = 1 - (0.004941/19.143261)

Compute 0.004941 / 19.143261:

0.004941 ÷ 19.143261 ≈ Let's see. 19.143261 × 0.00025 = approx 0.004785. So 0.00025 is 0.004785. Our numerator is 0.004941, which is 0.000156 more than 0.004785. So 0.000156 / 19.143261 ≈ 0.00000815. So total is 0.00025 + 0.00000815 ≈ 0.00025815.

So 1 - 0.00025815 = 0.99974185 or 99.974185%. So approximately 0.99974.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 0.9997. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.994553, 2.9e-13

B:0.975321,6.7e-13

C:1.007654,3.2e-13

D:0.9994553,2.4e-13

E:0.993210,7.5e-13

F:0.897654,3.5e-13

G:0.892345,5.8e-13

H:0.987654,4.1e-13

I:0.999876,1.9e-13

J:1.002345,1.6e-13

Hmm, option I has 0.999876, which is higher than our calculation. Option D has 0.9994553. So there's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the nucleus mass. Because in reality, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the protons and neutrons, but each neutron's mass is slightly higher than a proton. So, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact mass of the fluorine atom.

Wait, but the problem gives the mass of a proton and an electron but not the neutron. So perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as just the protons, and ignoring the neutrons' mass? No, that doesn't make sense because the nucleus has neutrons too.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the mass of the nucleus is approximately the mass number times the proton mass. So, for fluorine with A=19, the nucleus mass is 19 * 1.00728 u.

Then the total mass of the atom is 19.13832 u (nucleus) plus 9 * 0.000549 u (electrons) = 19.13832 + 0.004941 = 19.143261 u.

So nucleus mass is 19.13832 u, total is 19.143261.

So the fraction is 19.13832 / 19.143261 ≈ 0.9997418.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 0.999876, which is a bit higher. But none of the other options are that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the exact atomic mass of fluorine. Wait, the actual atomic mass of fluorine is about 18.998 u, but that might vary based on the isotope. But the problem doesn't give that, so perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me compute the total mass of the atom as the sum of protons, neutrons, and electrons. But without the neutron mass, I can't do that. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the neutron mass and just compute based on protons and electrons.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because the nucleus includes neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mass of the nucleus is (Z + N) * m_proton. Since Z=9, N=10, so A=19. So 19 * 1.00728 u.

Then the electron mass is 9 * 0.000549 u.

So the total mass of the atom would be 19*1.00728 + 9*0.000549 = 19.13832 + 0.004941 = 19.143261 u.

Nucleus mass is 19.13832 u.

So the fraction is (19.13832 /19.143261) ≈ 0.9997418, which is 99.97418%.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.999876, which is 99.9876%. That's a bit higher. Hmm. Let me compute 19.13832 /19.143261 precisely.

Let me calculate 19.13832 ÷ 19.143261.

Let me set it up as division:

19.143261 ) 19.138320

Wait, actually, 19.13832 is less than 19.143261, so the result is less than 1. Let me compute it as:

19.13832 / 19.143261 = ?

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to approximate the total mass as just the nucleus mass, ignoring the electrons. But that would make the fraction 1, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is only protons, and the problem is ignoring neutrons. But that can't be right because the nucleus has neutrons.

Wait, perhaps the question made a mistake, and the mass of the nucleus is just the protons, and the electrons are separate. No, that doesn't make sense. The nucleus includes protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 19 * 1.00728.

19 * 1.00728: Let me compute 20 *1.00728 = 20.1456, subtract 1 *1.00728: 20.1456 -1.00728=19.13832 u. That's correct.

Electrons: 9 *0.000549=0.004941 u.

Total mass: 19.13832 + 0.004941=19.143261 u.

Nucleus mass:19.13832 u.

So 19.13832 /19.143261 = let me compute it more accurately.

Let me write it as numerator=19.13832, denominator=19.143261.

So (19.13832 /19.143261) = (19.143261 - 0.004941)/19.143261 = 1 - (0.004941/19.143261).

Compute 0.004941 ÷19.143261.

Let me compute 0.004941 ÷19.143261.

Well, 19.143261 * 0.00025 = 0.004785325.

So 0.00025 gives us 0.004785325, which is less than 0.004941 by 0.004941 -0.004785325=0.000155675.

So how much more than 0.00025 is needed to get 0.004941?

We have 0.000155675 remaining. Since 19.143261 * x =0.000155675.

x=0.000155675 /19.143261 ≈ approximately 8.14e-6.

So total is 0.00025 + 0.00000814 = 0.00025814.

So 1 - 0.00025814 = 0.99974186, or 99.974186%.

Looking at the options, none of them have exactly this. The closest is option I: 0.999876 (99.9876%) and option D:0.9994553 (99.94553%).

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the nucleus mass calculation. Maybe the problem expects the nucleus to include only protons, not neutrons. But that's not correct. Because the nucleus has protons and neutrons.

Wait, but without the neutron mass given, maybe the problem expects me to ignore neutrons. So, perhaps the nucleus mass is only 9 protons, not 19 nucleons. Let's try that.

If the nucleus mass is 9 * 1.00728 =9.06552 u.

Then, the electrons are 9 *0.000549=0.004941 u.

So the total mass would be 9.06552 +0.004941=9.070461 u.

Then, the fraction is 9.06552 /9.070461 = approximately 0.9994553, which is option D's first number.

Wait, that would make sense. So perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as just protons, ignoring neutrons. But that doesn't make sense because the nucleus has neutrons. But maybe the problem is worded that way.

Wait, the question says: "masses of a proton and an electron are equal to..." No neutron mass given. So the problem might be simplifying by considering the nucleus as just protons, and the rest as electrons. But that's not accurate because the nucleus has neutrons too.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that the nucleus's mass is the sum of protons plus neutrons, but using the proton mass for both. So 19 protons (instead of 9 protons and 10 neutrons). So, that would be 19 *1.00728 =19.13832 u, as before.

Then, total atomic mass is 19.13832 +9 *0.000549=19.143261 u.

So the fraction is 19.13832 /
