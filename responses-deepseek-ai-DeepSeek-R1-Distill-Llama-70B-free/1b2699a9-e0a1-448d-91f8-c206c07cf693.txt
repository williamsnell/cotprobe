Question:

A biologist deals with things on a microscopic level. To A biologist deals with things on a microscopic level. To describe cellular dimensions and the amount of materials present at the cellular level, units of an appropriately small size are needed. What are these units of measurements?

Options:

A: The units of length are nanometers and picometers, while weights are in picograms and femtograms. Molecular weights are measured in kDa (kiloDaltons).
B: The unit of cellular measurement is the liter, and molecular weights are measured in pounds.
C: The units of measurement include the millimeter and the picometer, with weights in centigrams and decigrams.
D: The units of length commonly used are centimeters and millimeters. Molecular weights are expressed in grams.
E: Cellular dimensions are measured in decimeters and hectometers. Weights are expressed in kilograms and decagrams.
F: The unit of molecular weight employed is the kilogram.
G: The units of length commonly employed in biology include the micron and the \AAngstrom. Weights are expressed in milligrams, micrograms, and nanograms. The unit of molecular weight employed is the dalton.
H: The units of length commonly employed in biology include the meter and the kilogram.
I: Lengths are measured in feet and inches, while weights are in ounces and pounds at the cellular level.
J: Weights are expressed in kilograms, grams, and milligrams.

Okay, so I'm looking at this biology question here. Let me try to break it down. The question is about the units of measurement used in biology, specifically for cellular dimensions and materials at that level.

Hmm, I remember that cells are really small, so the units must be something tiny. I've heard terms like nanometers and micrometers before. Wait, like how we measure things under a microscope. Oh right, because cells are microscopic, so meters and centimeters are way too big.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says nanometers and picometers for length, and weights in picograms and femtograms. Molecular weights in kDa. Wait, kDa is kiloDalton, right? I think Daltons are used for molecular weight. That sounds familiar, like proteins are measured in kDa.

Option B has liters and pounds. That can't be right because liters are for volume and pounds are large units for weight, not suitable for cells.

Option C uses millimeter and picometer. Wait, millimeters are bigger than centimeters? No, wait, no. Millimeters are 1/1000 of a meter, but that's still larger than a typical cell. So maybe that's not right. Also, centigrams and decigrams are for weight, but I think cells are measured in much smaller units than grams. So C might not be correct.

Option D: centimeters and millimeters. Nope, those are too big. Molecular weights in grams? No, I think that's not right. I remember molecular weight units being Daltons, not grams.

Option E: decimeters and hectometers. Definitely way too large for cells. So E is out.

Option F: kilogram for molecular weight. No, that's way too big. Proteins are like a few dozen kDa, but a kilogram is 1000 grams, so F doesn't seem right.

Option G: micron and Angstrom. Wait, a micron is a micrometer, right? And an Angstrom is even smaller, 0.1 nanometers. That makes sense for measuring small structures like cells or molecules. Weights in milligrams, micrograms, nanograms. Those are small units, which fits. And molecular weight in Daltons. Yes, that rings a bell. I think this is the right option.

Option H: meter and kilogram. No, that's way too large for cellular stuff.

Option I: feet and inches, ounces and pounds. Definitely not, those are everyday units, nothing to do with microscopic scales.

Option J: kilograms, grams, milligrams. Those are larger units, but the question is about the cellular level, which is much smaller. So J is probably not correct.

So going back, G seems correct. It has microns (micrometers) like for cell size, Angstroms for even smaller structures like atoms or molecules. Weights in micrograms and nanograms make sense for tiny amounts in cells. And molecular weight in Daltons, which I remember is the standard unit for that.

The correct answer is G. In biology, cellular dimensions are typically measured using units like the micron (micrometer) and the Ã…ngstrom, which are appropriately small for microscopic structures. For weights, units such as milligrams, micrograms, and nanograms are used, reflecting the tiny amounts of materials at the cellular level. Additionally, molecular weights are commonly expressed in Daltons, making option G the most accurate choice.
