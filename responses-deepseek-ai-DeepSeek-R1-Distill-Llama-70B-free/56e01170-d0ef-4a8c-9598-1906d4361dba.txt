Alright, so I'm trying to figure out why the Wagner Act is called "labor's Magna Charta." I remember that the Wagner Act is also known as the National Labor Relations Act, so I should focus on what that act did.

I think the Magna Carta was a significant document that established certain rights for people, so maybe the Wagner Act did something similar for workers. The options are A through J, each suggesting different things.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: It introduced mandatory profit sharing. I don't recall the Wagner Act being about profit sharing. I think that's more related to other labor laws or company policies, not this one.

Option B: It obligated employers to bargain in good faith with a union. That sounds familiar. I remember that the NLRA did require employers to negotiate with unions, which is a big deal for collective bargaining.

Option C: It outlawed company unions. Company unions were set up by employers, right? So the Wagner Act might have banned those to prevent employers from controlling the unions. I think that's correct, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason it's called the Magna Charta.

Option D: Created a universal pension system. No, that sounds more like Social Security, which came around the same time but was a different act.

Option E: Allowed automatic union membership. I think that's more about union security clauses, maybe in the Taft-Hartley Act, but not the Wagner Act.

Option F: Mandated a four-day workweek. No, that's not right. The Fair Labor Standards Act set the 40-hour workweek, I think.

Option G: Established a federal minimum wage. Again, that's the FLSA, not the Wagner Act.

Option H: Gave labor the right to self-organization and collective bargaining. This rings a bell. The Wagner Act was all about protecting workers' rights to form unions and bargain collectively, so this seems like a strong candidate.

Option I: Required health insurance. That's more recent, like Obamacare, not from the 1930s.

Option J: Prohibited antiunion discrimination. Yes, the NLRA did make it illegal for employers to discriminate against workers for union activities. So that's another correct point, but is that the main reason for the Magna Charta title?

Now, the question is why it's considered such a significant document. The Wagner Act was a major step in labor rights. The key provisions were protecting workers' rights to form and join unions, engage in collective bargaining, and strike. It also prohibited unfair labor practices by employers.

So looking back at the options, H says it gave the right to self-organization and collective bargaining. J says it prohibited antiunion discrimination. Both H and J seem correct, but the main reason the Wagner Act is so important is that it established these fundamental rights.

Wait, looking at the exact options, H is about the rights of self-organization and collective bargaining. J is about prohibiting discrimination. Both are parts of the NLRA. So which one is the main reason it's called the Magna Charta?

The term "Magna Charta" implies foundational rights. The primary focus of the Wagner Act was to allow workers to organize and bargain collectively, which was a big shift from before when such activities could be suppressed by employers. So while J is part of it, H captures the essence of why it's so significant.

So the correct answer should be H.

The Wagner Act, or National Labor Relations Act, is considered "labor's Magna Charta" because it established foundational rights for workers. It protected the right to self-organization and collective bargaining, which were transformative in allowing workers to negotiate with employers on a more equal footing. While the act also prohibited antiunion discrimination (Option J), the core reason for its significance lies in granting these essential rights, making Option H the best choice.

Answer: H
