Question:

A defendant, on trial for robbery, took the stand and testified in his own behalf. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant whether he had committed false pretenses by making long-distance telephone calls by the unauthorized use of a credit card number. The defendant replied, "That's a lie, I never did. " In rebuttal, the prosecuting attorney called the court officer to testif' that the defendant admitted committing false pretenses. The court officer further testified, however, that the defendant was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony against others. The court officer's testimony is

Options:

Okay, so I have this evidence law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a defendant in a robbery trial who testifies on his own behalf. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asks him about committing false pretenses using a credit card. The defendant denies it, saying he never did that. Then, in rebuttal, the prosecutor calls a court officer who testifies that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses. But there's a twist: the court officer also says the defendant was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against others.

So the question is about the admissibility of the court officer's testimony. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

I remember that when a witness testifies, their credibility can be attacked with certain types of evidence. But there are rules about what can and can't be used. Specifically, I think about the rules regarding character evidence and specific acts of conduct.

Let me think about the defendant's testimony. He denied committing the crime, so the prosecutor is trying to impeach him by showing he's lying. The court officer's testimony is about a prior admission by the defendant.

Wait, but the defendant was granted immunity for his testimony. So he was compelled to testify, and in exchange, he can't be prosecuted for that. But does that immunity affect the admissibility of his prior statement?

I also recall that a witness's credibility can be attacked by showing that they've been convicted of a crime, but only certain crimes. However, specific instances of conduct that aren't resulting in a conviction can also be used if they relate to truthfulness.

Wait, but here the court officer is testifying about the defendant's admission. So the issue is whether that's admissible for impeachment purposes.

I think about FRE 608(b), which deals with specific instances of conduct. It says that specific instances of a witness's conduct, other than conviction of a crime, can't be proved by extrinsic evidence. So you can ask the witness about it on cross-examination, but you can't bring in other witnesses to testify about it unless it's a conviction.

In this case, the court officer is testifying about the defendant's admission. Since the defendant is a party, not just a witness, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the defendant is testifying as a witness in his own defense, so he's a witness here.

So when the prosecutor calls another witness (the court officer) to testify about the defendant's prior statement, that's extrinsic evidence of a specific act. Under FRE 608(b), extrinsic evidence isn't allowed to prove specific acts of misconduct unless it's a conviction.

But wait, the defendant's statement was made under immunity. Does that change anything? Because if he was granted immunity, maybe the statement is admissible as an admission of a party opponent under FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Because admissions are exceptions to hearsay.

Wait, but the issue here is whether the court officer can testify about it. The defendant's own statement would be an admission, but if the court officer is testifying about it, is that hearsay?

Wait, in the scenario, the court officer is testifying that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses. So that's a statement of the defendant, offered against him. So under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement. So the court officer's testimony about the defendant's admission would be admissible as a party admission, not hearsay.

Wait, but wait. The initial issue is whether the court officer can testify about this at all, given the rules on impeachment.

So, the defendant's prior statement could be used as substantive evidence (as an admission) and also for impeachment. But FRE 608(b) says specific instances of conduct (other than convictions) can't be proved by extrinsic evidence for the purpose of attacking credibility. So even though the statement is an admission, if the prosecutor is trying to use it to show the defendant is lying (i.e., impeaching his credibility), then extrinsic evidence of that specific act isn't allowed unless it's a conviction.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant made a statement that's inconsistent with his testimony. So under FRE 613, prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach a witness. But FRE 613 allows extrinsic evidence of such statements only if they are based on personal knowledge and the witness is given the chance to explain or deny them, and the statement is in writing and signed, or recorded, etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's clarify:

- FRE 608(b): specific instances of conduct (not convictions) can't be proven by extrinsic evidence for attacking credibility. So you can ask the witness about it on cross, but can't bring other evidence unless it's a conviction.

- FRE 613: prior inconsistent statements can be used, but extrinsic evidence is allowed only if certain conditions are met (like the statement being in writing, etc.)

In this case, the court officer is testifying about the defendant's prior statement. So if the statement was made under oath and in a proceeding, maybe it qualifies as something that can be used extrinsically. But in the question, it says the defendant was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against others. So the statement was made in a prior proceeding perhaps.

Wait, but the issue is whether the court officer's testimony about that is admissible. So the question is whether that testimony is admissible for impeachment.

So if the defendant's prior statement is a prior inconsistent statement, then under FRE 613, the prosecutor could use extrinsic evidence of that statement if it was made under oath in a prior proceeding. So if the defendant's prior statement was made under oath (like in a deposition or prior testimony), then FRE 613 allows extrinsic evidence.

But in the question, the scenario is that the court officer is testifying about the defendant's admission. So perhaps the defendant made the admission in a prior case, and the court officer was present when he did so. So the court officer's testimony would be about that.

So, if the prior statement was made under oath, then the extrinsic evidence is allowed under FRE 613. But if not, then it's not allowed.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether the statement was made under oath. Hmm. That complicates it. So perhaps the prior statement was not under oath, so extrinsic evidence wouldn't be allowed under FRE 613.

Alternatively, considering that the statement is an admission, it's non-hearsay, but the use for impeachment is restricted by FRE 608.

Wait, but the statement is about a specific act of dishonesty, which would go to the defendant's credibility. So if the prosecutor is trying to impeach the defendant's credibility by showing he committed another crime, that would be subject to FRE 608(b), which prohibits extrinsic evidence of specific acts unless they resulted in a conviction.

So in this case, the defendant wasn't convicted of false pretenses, but was granted immunity. So the prosecution can't bring extrinsic evidence of that specific act to impeach him, because it's not a conviction.

Wait, but the statement is an admission, so maybe that's admissible as substantive evidence, but not for impeachment. Or perhaps it's admissible for both purposes.

Wait, but the question is about whether the court officer's testimony is admissible. So the testimony is about the defendant's prior admission. If the admission is an admission of a party opponent, it's admissible as substantive evidence under FRE 801(d)(2)(A). So the court officer's testimony would be admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt, but the issue is whether it can be used to impeach the defendant's credibility.

Wait, but the defendant is on trial for robbery, not for false pretenses. So the prosecutor might be trying to show that the defendant is a liar, which would relate to his credibility as a witness.

But under FRE 608(b), specific instances of conduct that aren't convictions can't be proven by extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes. So if the court officer's testimony is about a specific act of false pretenses, which didn't result in a conviction (because of immunity), then it's inadmissible extrinsic evidence for impeachment.

So the court officer's testimony would be inadmissible for impeachment purposes because it's extrinsic evidence of a specific act that didn't result in a conviction.

Wait, but the defendant's statement is an admission of a crime. So under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), it's not hearsay and can be used substantively against him. So the prosecutor could use the statement as evidence that the defendant committed the robbery, perhaps to show a pattern of dishonesty.

But wait, the robbery and the false pretenses are different crimes. So the question is whether evidence of the false pretenses is admissible in the robbery trial.

Under FRE 404(b), evidence of other crimes is admissible for certain purposes, like to show intent, plan, etc., but not to show that the defendant is a bad person. So if the prosecutor is offering it to show that the defendant is a thief and thus more likely to commit robbery, that might be allowed under 404(b). But if it's being offered solely to impeach the defendant's credibility, then it's subject to the restrictions of FRE 608(b).

Wait, but the question says that the prosecutor called the court officer in rebuttal. Rebuttal is usually to counter the defendant's testimony. So the prosecutor is trying to show that the defendant lied on the stand when he denied committing false pretenses.

So in that case, the prosecutor is using the prior statement to impeach the defendant's credibility. Thus, the court officer's testimony is extrinsic evidence of a specific act of dishonesty, which is prohibited under FRE 608(b) unless it's a conviction.

Since the defendant was granted immunity, there was no conviction. So the extrinsic evidence is inadmissible for impeachment.

Alternatively, if the prosecutor is using it as substantive evidence (i.e., to prove that the defendant is guilty of robbery because he's a liar), then it's a different analysis. But I think the primary purpose here is impeachment.

So, the court officer's testimony about the defendant's prior admission is inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence of a specific act not resulting in a conviction, used for impeachment purposes.

Looking back at the options:

Option J says it's inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence. That aligns with my conclusion.

Option F says it's inadmissible as hearsay. But the statement is an admission, so it's not hearsay. So F is incorrect.

Option D says inadmissible because of immunity. I'm not sure about that. The immunity affects whether the defendant can be prosecuted for that crime, but it doesn't make the statement inadmissible. The statement can still be used as evidence.

Option B says admissible as bearing on credibility. But under FRE 608(b), extrinsic evidence isn't allowed unless it's a conviction. So B is incorrect.

Option E says admissible as bearing on guilt. That might be possible under 801(d)(2) as an admission, but if the statement is about a different crime, it might be subject to 404(b) limitations. But the question is about admissibility, not whether it's relevant to guilt. So if it's admissible as an admission, E could be correct, but the issue is the use of extrinsic evidence for impeachment.

Wait, but if it's an admission, it's admissible as substantive evidence. So the court officer's testimony is admissible for that purpose. But the question is about the admissibility in the context of rebutting the defendant's testimony, which is about credibility.

Hmm. So perhaps the testimony is admissible as substantive evidence, showing that the defendant committed another crime, which could be relevant to his credibility as a witness, but under 608(b), you can't use extrinsic evidence unless it's a conviction. So if the court officer's testimony is being used to impeach credibility, it's inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence of a specific act without a conviction.

But if it's being used as substantive evidence (to show he's guilty of robbery because he's a liar), then it's admissible as an admission. But wait, the robbery and the credit card are different crimes. So the admission would be about a different crime, which may not be directly relevant to the robbery case except for impeachment.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to clarify.

The key points are:

1. The defendant's prior statement is an admission by a party opponent, so it's not hearsay (FRE 801(d)(2)(A)).

2. The statement can be used substantively against the defendant as evidence of his guilt in the robbery case, but only if it's relevant. However, the robbery and the false pretenses are separate crimes, so under FRE 404(b), evidence of other crimes is admissible only if it's relevant for some purpose other than showing bad character.

But in this case, the prosecutor is using it in rebuttal after the defendant testified. So perhaps it's to show that the defendant is lying about not committing the robbery, thereby impeaching his credibility.

Wait, but the false pretenses charge isn't directly related to the robbery. So maybe it's being used to show that the defendant has a tendency to commit crimes, which is not admissible under 404(b) unless it's for a specific purpose like intent or plan.

Alternatively, the prosecutor might argue that the false pretenses shows the defendant's knowledge or method in committing the robbery, but that's a stretch.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the court officer's testimony, not whether the evidence is relevant. So if the testimony is admissible as an admission, then it's admissible regardless of 404(b). Or is it?

Wait, no. Even if it's an admission, if it's being offered to prove another crime, FRE 404(b) would still apply unless it's for a permissible purpose.

So the court officer's testimony is about the defendant's admission to false pretenses, which is a different crime. So to admit it, the prosecutor would need to show it's relevant for a purpose other than the defendant's character, like showing a modus operandi, intent, etc.

But the way the question is phrased, the prosecutor is using it to rebut the defendant's denial, which is about credibility. So the primary purpose is impeachment, not substantive evidence of guilt.

So under FRE 608(b), the extrinsic evidence of a specific act (false pretenses) that didn't result in a conviction is inadmissible for impeachment.

Thus, the court officer's testimony is inadmissible for impeachment purposes because it's extrinsic evidence of a specific act without a conviction.

Therefore, the correct answer would be J: inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence.

Wait, but option J says, "inadmissible because the testimony is extrinsic evidence." So that fits.

Alternatively, option D says inadmissible because the defendant was granted immunity. But immunity doesn't necessarily make the statement inadmissible; it just means he can't be prosecuted for it.

So I think J is the correct answer.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of a court officer's testimony regarding the defendant's prior admission to committing false pretenses, made under a grant of immunity. The defendant denied the allegation on cross-examination, and the prosecutor sought to impeach his credibility by introducing the court officer's testimony about the prior admission. The analysis focuses on the rules of evidence, particularly FRE 608(b) and FRE 613, which govern the use of extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness's credibility.

Under FRE 608(b), specific instances of a witness's conduct (other than convictions of crime) cannot be proven by extrinsic evidence for the purpose of attacking credibility. While the defendant's prior statement qualifies as an admission of a party opponent under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), making it admissible as substantive evidence, its use for impeachment is restricted. Since the defendant was granted immunity and not convicted of the crime, the court officer's testimony constitutes extrinsic evidence of a specific act of misconduct, which is prohibited under FRE 608(b) for impeachment purposes.

Additionally, while FRE 613 allows the use of prior inconsistent statements to impeach a witness, it requires that such statements meet specific conditions (e.g., being made under oath in a prior proceeding). The question does not indicate that the defendant's prior statement met these requirements, further supporting the inadmissibility of the court officer's testimony for impeachment.

The immunity granted to the defendant does not render the statement inadmissible per se, but it does mean that the statement cannot be used as extrinsic evidence to impeach the defendant's credibility without a conviction. Therefore, the court officer's testimony is inadmissible because it constitutes extrinsic evidence of a specific act of misconduct that did not result in a conviction.

The correct answer is:

**J: inadmissible, because the testimony is extrinsic evidence.**

Answer: J
