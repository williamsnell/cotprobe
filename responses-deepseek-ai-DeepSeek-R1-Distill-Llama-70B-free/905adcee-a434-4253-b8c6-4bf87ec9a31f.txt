Okay, so I've got this question about an automobile insurance policy. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the policy was purchased on March 10th with a $155 premium and then canceled on September 6th by the owner. The question is asking how much the refund was.

Wait, I remember that insurance policies usually have terms about refunds when you cancel. I think it depends on how long the policy was in effect. So, first, I need to figure out how many months the policy was active before it was canceled.

March 10th to September 6th. Let's see... March has 31 days, so March 10th to March 31st is 21 days. Then April has 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, and then up to September 6th.

Wait, maybe it's easier to count the months instead of days. So from March to September. March is the starting point. So:

- March: They started on the 10th, so they have the remainder of March. Maybe that counts as a partial month.
- April: Full month.
- May: Full.
- June: Full.
- July: Full.
- August: Full.
- Then September: They canceled on the 6th, so that's 6 days into September.

Wait, but how do insurance companies calculate refunds? I think they might prorate based on the time the policy was in effect. Some might charge for each month or part of a month, but others might have a short-rate cancellation which is a bit more complicated.

I remember that sometimes when you cancel a policy, especially car insurance, the refund is calculated based on the unused portion of the premium. But the method can vary. One common method is the short-rate cancellation, which charges a small fee for the cancellation and then refunds the rest.

Alternatively, they might calculate it on a pro-rata basis, meaning they only charge for the exact time the policy was in force.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the method. Hmm. Maybe I should assume it's a pro-rata refund. Let's try that first.

So the policy was in effect from March 10 to September 6. Let me calculate the number of days.

March: From March 10 to March 31 is 31 - 10 +1 = 22 days (including both start and end).
April: 30 days.
May:31
June:30
July:31
August:31
September:6 days.

Adding them up:

22 (March) + 30 (April) =52
+31 (May)=83
+30 (June)=113
+31 (July)=144
+31 (August)=175
+6 (September)=181 days total.

Now, the total policy period is typically a year, so 365 days. So the fraction of the year used is 181/365.

So the premium is $155. The used portion is 181/365 *155. So the refund would be the total minus that.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the policy is for a year, so from March 10, 2023, to March 10, 2024. But they canceled on September 6, 2023. So the time in force is from March 10 to Sept 6.

Wait, actually, the policy is probably for a year, but the question doesn't specify the start and end dates beyond the purchase and cancellation dates. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the policy is for a year, so the refund is for the unused months. But if it's based on months, how many full months were used?

March: They started on the 10th, so perhaps they get charged for the full month of March?

Wait, maybe the insurance company calculates the refund based on the number of months. Let me think: from March 10 to September 6 is how many months?

March: from 10th to end: that's more than half the month, so perhaps they charge for the full month.

But if they cancel in September, do they charge for the full September? Or only up to the cancellation date.

Alternatively, some companies might calculate based on the number of full months the policy was in effect and any partial month as a full month.

So, let's see:

March: started on 10th, so maybe they charge for the full month.
April: full.
May: full.
June: full.
July: full.
August: full.
September: they canceled on the 6th, so maybe they don't charge for September, or do they charge for part of it.

Wait, but I think in some cases, if you cancel in a month, they charge for that month regardless. So, from March to September, that's 7 months (March, April, May, June, July, August, September), but since they canceled on September 6th, maybe they don't charge for September. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the exact days and then compute the pro-rata refund.

So total days in a year: 365.

Days used: 181 days.

So the used premium is (181 /365)*155.

Let me calculate that.

181 divided by 365 is approximately 0.4959.

Multiply by 155: 0.4959 * 155 ≈ let's see.

0.4959 * 150 = 74.385, and 0.4959 *5=2.4795, so total around 76.8645.

So the used premium is about $76.86. So the refund would be 155 - 76.86 = $78.14.

Looking at the options, I see option J is $77, which is close. But wait, perhaps the calculation is done by the exact number of days.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate method is used, which might involve a different calculation.

Wait, I think short-rate cancellation involves calculating the refund as the pro-rata amount minus a fee, but I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Or perhaps it's the pro-rata amount minus a small percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the company considers each month as a fraction and calculates accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the policy is considered to have been in effect for 6 months (March to August), and September is the 7th month but only 6 days in. So perhaps they charge for 6 full months and 6 days of the 7th.

Wait, but without knowing the exact method the company uses, it's hard to say. The question doesn't specify, so perhaps I should stick to the pro-rata method, which gives around $78, so the closest option is J: $77.

But wait, let me recalculate the days more accurately.

March: 31 days in the month. From March 10 to March 31 is 22 days (including both the 10th and 31st).

April: 30
May:31
June:30
July:31
August:31
September:6 days.

Total days: 22 +30=52; +31=83; +30=113; +31=144; +31=175; +6=181 days.

So 181 days out of 365.

So the used premium is (181/365)*155.

Let me compute that more accurately.

181/365 = approximately 0.49589.

0.49589 *155 = ?

Let me compute 155 * 0.49589.

155 * 0.4 = 62.

155 * 0.09 = 13.95.

155 * 0.00589 = approximately 155 *0.005=0.775, and 155 *0.00089=0.138, so total about 0.775+0.138=0.913.

Adding them up: 62 +13.95=75.95 +0.913=76.863.

So the used premium is $76.863, so the refund would be 155 -76.863=78.137, approximately $78.14.

Looking at the options, the closest is J: $77. But wait, none of the options is exactly $78.14. The options are A:100, B:155, C:30, D:110, E:93, F:125, G:180, H:62, I:45, J:77.

So J is $77, which is close. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is based on months, not days.

Wait, perhaps the policy was in effect for 5 full months and part of the sixth.

Let me see: From March 10 to September 6.

March: from the 10th, so maybe March is considered a full month.

April: full.

May: full.

June: full.

July: full.

August: full.

September: canceled on 6th, so perhaps they don't charge for September.

So total of 6 full months (March to August) and 6 days in September. But if the refund is based on full months, then 6 months would be charged.

So 6 months is half a year. So 6/12 = 0.5.

So used premium is 0.5 *155=77.5.

So the refund would be 155 -77.5=77.5, which is $77.5, so $77 when rounded down.

That would match option J:77.

So perhaps the refund is $77.

Alternatively, maybe the company gives a refund for the full months not used. So if they canceled on September 6, they might have charged for the full month of September regardless, making it 7 months.

So 7 months is 7/12 of the year.

7/12 *155= (7*155)/12=1085/12≈90.4167.

So the used premium is about $90.42, so refund is 155-90.42≈64.58, but that doesn't match any of the options closely. So probably not this method.

Alternatively, maybe the company calculates based on the number of months the policy was in force. So from March 10 to September 6 is 5 full months and a bit.

Wait, March 10 to April 10 is one month, April 10 to May 10 another, and so on. So from March 10 to August 10 is 5 months, and then from August 10 to September 6 is 27 days. So perhaps they charge for 6 months (the 5 full and part of the sixth).

So 6 months is half the year, so $77.5 refund.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, J is the closest.

To determine the refund for the automobile insurance policy, we need to calculate the unused portion of the premium based on the time the policy was in effect. The policy was purchased on March 10 and canceled on September 6, with a total premium of $155. 

### Step 1: Calculate the number of days the policy was in effect
- **March**: From March 10 to March 31 is 22 days.
- **April**: 30 days.
- **May**: 31 days.
- **June**: 30 days.
- **July**: 31 days.
- **August**: 31 days.
- **September**: 6 days.

Adding these together:  
22 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 6 (September) = **181 days**.

### Step 2: Pro-rata calculation of the refund
The total policy term is assumed to be 365 days. The fraction of the year the policy was in effect is:  
\[
\frac{181}{365} \approx 0.4959
\]

The used premium is:  
\[
0.4959 \times 155 \approx 76.86
\]

The refund is the total premium minus the used premium:  
\[
155 - 76.86 \approx 78.14
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated refund of approximately $78.14 is closest to **$77**, which corresponds to option **J**.

### Conclusion
The refund on the policy is **$77**.
