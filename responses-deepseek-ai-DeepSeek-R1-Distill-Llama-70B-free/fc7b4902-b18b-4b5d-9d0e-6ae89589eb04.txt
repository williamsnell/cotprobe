Question:

A man and a woman agreed that the woman would rob a bank and that the man would steal a car beforehand for the woman to use as a getaway vehicle. The man stole a car and parked it two blocks from the bank. He left the car key under the floor mat with a note saying that he wanted nothing more to do with the scheme. The next day, the woman robbed the bank and ran to the spot where the man had said he would leave the stolen car. She then escaped in the car and disappeared. She never shared any of the money with the man. In a jurisdiction that has adopted the bilateral requirement for conspiracy, can the man properly be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank?

Options:

A: Yes, because the man was a part of the initial planning of the robbery.
B: Yes, because the man committed a crime (stealing a car) in furtherance of the conspiracy.
C: Yes, because the robbery was successful due in part to the man's actions.
D: Yes, because the man provided the getaway vehicle.
E: Yes, because there was an agreement to rob the bank and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.
F: No, because the man expressed his intention to withdraw from the conspiracy.
G: No, because the man received no benefit from the robbery.
H: No, because the woman did not share the money with the man.
I: No, because the man did not participate in the actual robbery.

Okay, so I've got this conspiracy law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a man and a woman who agreed to rob a bank. The man's role was to steal a car for the getaway, and the woman would do the actual robbery. So, the man stole the car, parked it a couple of blocks away, left the key under the floor mat, and then wrote a note saying he wanted nothing more to do with the scheme. The next day, the woman used the car to escape after robbing the bank and didn't share any money with the man.

The question is whether the man can be convicted of conspiracy to rob the bank in a jurisdiction that follows the bilateral requirement for conspiracy. 

Hmm, I remember that conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and in some places, there's a bilateral requirement. Bilateral means both parties must agree, right? So both have to be on board with the plan.

Wait, but here the man initially agreed, stole the car, but then tried to withdraw by leaving a note. So, did he effectively withdraw from the conspiracy?

I think about what happens when someone tries to withdraw from a conspiracy. If the withdrawal is before any overt acts are committed, maybe it's different. But if overt acts have already been done, maybe the withdrawal isn't effective. Or perhaps the key is whether the overt acts were done in furtherance of the conspiracy.

So, the man stole the car, which is an overt act. Then he tried to back out. But the woman used the car anyway. So, does his withdrawal after the overt act matter? Or is his initial agreement and the overt act enough to convict him?

Wait, in a bilateral conspiracy jurisdiction, I think both parties must have the intent to agree at the same time. So if one person withdraws their consent, the conspiracy might fall apart. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Let me think about the elements of conspiracy. Typically, it's an agreement between two people with the intent to commit a crime, and an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. But some jurisdictions require that both parties are still in agreement at the time the overt act is committed, or at least that the agreement is mutual when the overt act occurs.

In this case, the man stole the car (overt act) while they were still in agreement, but then he tried to withdraw. The woman then used the car the next day. So, when she used the car, was the man still part of the conspiracy? If he withdrew before she committed the robbery, maybe the conspiracy was already broken. But the overt act (stealing the car) was done while the conspiracy was active.

Wait, but the man's withdrawal was after the overt act. So does that mean the conspiracy was still in effect when he committed the overt act, making him liable, even if he later withdrew?

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction requires bilateral agreement at the time of the overt act, then perhaps the man's withdrawal after the overt act but before the robbery might not matter because the overt act was already done.

Wait, but the woman committed the robbery the next day. So, the overt act (stealing the car) was done by the man as part of the conspiracy. Then, the woman's act of robbing the bank is another overt act. But in a bilateral conspiracy, both must agree. So if the man withdrew, does that mean the woman's act can't be imputed to him?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the possible answer choices.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, because part of initial planning. But planning alone isn't enough without an agreement.

B: Yes, because he committed a crime (stealing) in furtherance. But if he withdrew, maybe that's not enough.

C: Yes, because robbery succeeded due to his actions. But causation might not be the issue; it's about the conspiracy agreement.

D: Yes, because he provided the getaway vehicle. Similar to B and C.

E: Yes, because there was an agreement and overt act. This seems to align with the elements, but if he withdrew, maybe the agreement was no longer mutual.

F: No, because he withdrew. So if withdrawal is effective, he's not liable.

G: No, because no benefit. But I don't think receiving benefit is a requirement for conspiracy.

H: No, because she didn't share money. Same as G, not relevant.

I: No, because he didn't participate in the robbery. But conspiracy is about the agreement, not necessarily participation in the actual crime.

So the key issue is whether the man's withdrawal was effective. In a bilateral conspiracy jurisdiction, if the man withdrew before the overt act, maybe the conspiracy is broken. But here, the overt act (stealing the car) happened while the conspiracy was active. Then he tried to withdraw, but the woman still used the car.

Wait, but the woman's act of robbery was the next day. So the overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy (stealing the car) was done by the man. Then he tried to withdraw. But does that withdrawal prevent the conspiracy from continuing?

I think in some jurisdictions, once an overt act is committed, withdrawal doesn't undo the conspiracy liability for that act. So even if he tried to withdraw, the fact that he committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy would mean he's liable.

But wait, the bilateral requirement. Both parties must agree at the time of the overt act. So if the man withdrew before the overt act (if any) by the woman, does that matter? Or was the overt act the man's theft of the car, which happened when the agreement was still in place.

In the scenario, the man stole the car, which is an overt act, while the agreement was active. Then he tried to withdraw. The woman later robbed the bank, using the car. But the robbery is another overt act, but by that time, the man had withdrawn.

So, in a bilateral jurisdiction, for the woman's act to count as part of the conspiracy, both must have been in agreement at the time of her act. Since the man had withdrawn, maybe her act can't be considered an overt act in furtherance of their conspiracy.

Alternatively, the man's act (stealing the car) was an overt act, so he's liable for conspiracy based on that. Because the conspiracy was formed, he agreed, and he committed an overt act. His later withdrawal might not negate the fact that he was part of the conspiracy when the overt act occurred.

Hmm. So, the elements are: agreement, intent, and overt act. The overt act can be by either party. So if the man committed the overt act (stealing the car) while the agreement was in place, then he's liable for conspiracy. His withdrawal after that doesn't undo the conspiracy because the overt act was already done.

Wait, but in a bilateral conspiracy, both parties must agree to the plan. So if the man withdrew, perhaps the conspiracy ends, and any subsequent acts aren't part of it. But the overt act was already done before withdrawal.

So, the man can be convicted because he entered into the agreement and committed an overt act in furtherance of it. His withdrawal doesn't retroactively undo that.

Looking back at the options, option E says yes because there was an agreement and overt act. That seems correct. The man was part of the agreement and committed an overt act (stealing the car) before he tried to withdraw. So he can be convicted of conspiracy.

But wait, what about the bilateral requirement? If the man withdrew, and the woman continued, does that mean the conspiracy no longer exists bilaterally? Because the man no longer agreed. But the overt act happened before withdrawal. So perhaps the conspiracy was formed, the man's withdrawal ends his liability for future acts, but he's still liable for the conspiracy up until withdrawal.

Wait, but the robbery was the next day, which was after the man's withdrawal. So, the woman's act of robbery might not be part of the conspiracy because the man had already withdrawn. But the man's act of stealing the car was part of the conspiracy.

So, in this case, the man is guilty of conspiracy because he agreed and committed an overt act. The fact that he withdrew doesn't negate that. His withdrawal might mean he's not guilty of any crimes that happen after withdrawal, but the conspiracy itself was formed and acted upon.

So the correct answer would be E: Yes, because there was an agreement and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.

Wait, but option B says yes because he committed a crime in furtherance. That's also correct, but E is more about the elements.

Another thought: in a bilateral conspiracy, both must agree at the time of the overt act. If the man withdrew before the woman acted, would that affect it? The overt act for the conspiracy can be the man's act of stealing the car. So, when he stole the car, both were in agreement. So the overt act was done when the agreement was active. Therefore, the man is guilty of conspiracy.

So, the answer should be E.

In a jurisdiction that follows the bilateral requirement for conspiracy, the man can be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two parties to commit a crime, intent to commit the crime, and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. Here, the man and the woman initially agreed to the plan, and the man committed an overt act (stealing the car) in furtherance of the conspiracy while the agreement was still in place. 

Although the man later attempted to withdraw from the conspiracy by leaving a note, his withdrawal does not retroactively undo the conspiracy or the overt act he had already committed. The overt act of stealing the car was sufficient to establish his liability for conspiracy, even if he withdrew before the woman robbed the bank. The bilateral requirement is satisfied because the agreement and overt act (stealing the car) occurred while both parties were still in agreement. 

Thus, the man can properly be convicted of conspiracy based on the initial agreement and the overt act he committed in furtherance of it.
