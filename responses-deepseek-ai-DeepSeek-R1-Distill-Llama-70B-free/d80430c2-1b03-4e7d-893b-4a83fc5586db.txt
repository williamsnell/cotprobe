Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which substance chlorine gas reacts most readily with. The options are A through I, each being a different compound. Hmm, I remember that chlorine reacts in different ways with various substances, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through step by step.

Let me start by recalling what I know about chlorine's reactivity. Chlorine is a diatomic molecule, Cl2, and it's pretty reactive because of its electronegativity and the fact that it's a halogen. It tends to undergo addition and substitution reactions. I remember that alkenes and alkynes react with chlorine in addition reactions, especially under certain conditions. For example, adding Cl2 to an alkene would result in a dihalide because each chlorine atom adds across the double bond. 

So looking at the options, let's see which ones are alkenes. Option B is ethylene, which is C2H4. That's an alkene with a double bond between the two carbons. Then there's option I, benzene, which is an aromatic compound. Benzene is pretty stable and doesn't readily react with chlorine under normal conditions without a catalyst. But I think it does undergo electrophilic substitution when catalyzed, like in the presence of FeCl3. So it can react, but maybe not as readily as some other options without that catalyst.

What about the other options? Let's go through them one by one. Option A is butane, which is an alkane (C4H10). Alkanes are pretty unreactive because they're saturated. I think they only react with chlorine under specific conditions, like light, which initiates a substitution reaction. But that's not as quick as addition reactions with alkenes. So butane might not be the most reactive here.

Option C is acetic acid, CH3COOH. Acids can react with chlorine, but I'm not exactly sure how. Maybe in substitution? Or perhaps in some kind of addition if there's a double bond, but acetic acid has a carboxylic group. Wait, the structure of acetic acid has a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the oxygen. Does that react with Cl2? I think when chlorine reacts with acids, it might involve the hydroxyl group, but I'm not certain about the specifics. Alternatively, maybe under certain conditions, like in the presence of light, but I'm not sure if that's a quick reaction.

Option D is toluene, which is a benzene ring with a methyl group attached. Toluene is an aromatic compound, so similar to benzene. Without a catalyst, it's not very reactive towards chlorine. But under certain conditions, like with a catalyst, it can undergo substitution. But again, not as readily as alkenes.

Option E is ethanol, which is an alcohol (CH3CH2OH). Alcohols can undergo substitution reactions where the hydroxyl group is replaced by chlorine. But that usually requires a catalyst like ZnCl2 or some other acidic conditions. I think that reaction isn't as rapid as addition reactions with alkenes. So ethanol might not be the most reactive here.

Option F is propane, another alkane (C3H8). Like butane, it's unreactive and would only react under specific conditions like light, leading to a substitution reaction. Not as quick as addition.

Option G is ethane, which is the simplest alkane (C2H6). Same as the others, it's very unreactive and needs specific conditions, so it's probably not the most reactive towards Cl2.

Option H is ethanoic acid, which is another name for acetic acid. So same as option C, I think. So same considerations apply here.

So, putting it all together, the options that have double bonds are ethylene (B) and benzene (I), but benzene is less reactive towards Cl2 without a catalyst. Ethylene, on the other hand, readily reacts with Cl2 in an addition reaction to form 1,2-dichloroethane. This reaction is pretty fast and doesn't require harsh conditions, so ethylene would react most readily with chlorine.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm trying to remember if any of the other compounds might be more reactive. For example, acids could potentially react with Cl2, but I think their reactions are different. Acids could possibly be chlorinated under certain conditions, but I'm not sure if that's a direct reaction with Cl2 or if it's more involved, like in a substitution or addition where a functional group is involved.

Another angle: the question is about which reacts "most readily." So maybe looking at the types of reactions that are most exothermic or happen quickly. Addition reactions with alkenes are typically fast and exothermic, whereas substitution reactions with alkanes require more energy and are slower.

So between the options, ethylene (B) is an alkene, so it's likely the correct answer because it undergoes a quick addition reaction with Cl2.

Chlorine gas (Cl₂) is known for its reactivity, particularly in addition and substitution reactions. Among the given options, the compound that reacts most readily with chlorine is ethylene (C₂H₄), which is an alkene. Ethylene contains a double bond that allows it to undergo a rapid addition reaction with Cl₂, forming 1,2-dichloroethane. This reaction is fast and does not require harsh conditions, making ethylene highly reactive toward chlorine.

Other options, such as benzene (I), can react with chlorine but require a catalyst like FeCl₃ for electrophilic substitution, making their reaction less immediate. Similarly, alkanes like butane (A), propane (F), and ethane (G) are relatively unreactive and only undergo substitution reactions under specific conditions, such as light. Acetic acid (C) and ethanoic acid (H) may react with chlorine, but their reactions are not as rapid or direct as the addition reaction with ethylene. Toluene (D) and ethanol (E) also react under specific conditions, but their reactions are slower compared to ethylene.

Thus, ethylene stands out as the compound that reacts most readily with chlorine gas due to its double bond and the rapidity of the addition reaction.
