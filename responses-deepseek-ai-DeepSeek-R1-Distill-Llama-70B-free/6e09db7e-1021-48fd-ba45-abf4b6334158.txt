Okay, so I've got this question about a meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues from 1999. The question is about the effects of instituting flexitime in an organization. Hmm, I remember that flexitime is a work arrangement where employees can choose their hours within certain limits, right? So the question is asking which of the given options is most likely to benefit the most from flexitime.

The options are A through I: job stress, communication, productivity, overall job satisfaction, self-rated performance, absenteeism, employee turnover, company profitability, and teamwork.

I think I should break this down. Flexitime, or flexible working hours, is supposed to give employees more control over their work schedules. This can have various effects. Let me think about each option.

Job stress (A): More flexible hours might reduce stress because people can manage their personal and work responsibilities better. That makes sense. If you can avoid rush hour or take care of family needs, you're less stressed.

Communication (B): I'm not sure. If people come in at different times, maybe communication could be a bit harder, but maybe tools like email and messaging help. It might not be the biggest benefit.

Productivity (C): Flexitime can sometimes increase productivity because people can work when they're most efficient. But it might depend on the job type. For example, creative jobs might see a boost, while others might not.

Overall job satisfaction (D): Flexibility often leads to higher satisfaction because employees feel trusted and have better work-life balance. This seems like a strong candidate.

Self-rated performance (E): If employees are happier and less stressed, they might rate their performance higher, but I'm not sure if this is the primary effect.

Absenteeism (F): With flexible hours, people might be less likely to miss work because they can handle appointments or emergencies without needing a day off. So this could reduce absenteeism.

Employee turnover (G): High turnover is expensive for companies. If employees are happier with flexitime, they might be less likely to leave, reducing turnover.

Company profitability (H): This is a bit broader. While things like productivity and lower turnover can contribute, profitability also depends on many other factors. It's possible, but maybe not the direct effect measured in the study.

Teamwork (I): If people are working different hours, maybe team collaboration could be a bit tricky, but again, modern tools can mitigate this. So perhaps not the biggest benefit.

So the question is, which of these is the greatest beneficial effect? The options that seem most directly impacted are job satisfaction, absenteeism, turnover, and maybe productivity.

I remember reading that studies often show flexitime improves job satisfaction and reduces turnover. But which is the greatest? Well, the meta-analysis by Baltes probably looked at various factors. I think job satisfaction is a common outcome measured because it's directly tied to how employees feel about their job conditions.

Wait, but other factors like absenteeism and turnover are more concrete metrics. Maybe the analysis found that flexitime had the most significant impact on reducing absenteeism. Or maybe it was on job satisfaction.

Alternatively, I've heard that flexitime can lead to increased productivity because employees can manage their time better. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest effect.

Another angle: the question says "the greatest beneficial effects." So which of these variables shows the largest improvement when flexitime is introduced.

In some studies, flexible work arrangements are associated with higher job satisfaction. For example, employees who can set their own hours tend to be more satisfied because they have better work-life balance.

But on the other hand, absenteeism is something that can be directly measured and might show a significant drop.

Alternatively, I think that in the context of Baltes' work, the focus might be on job satisfaction. Or maybe it's on productivity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think of each option again.

Job stress reduction would make employees happier and maybe more productive, but is that the primary effect?

Productivity could go up, but it's not always guaranteed. Some people might be more productive, others might not. It depends on how the work is structured.

Overall job satisfaction seems like a solid bet. Employees like having the flexibility, which makes them more satisfied with their jobs overall.

Alternatively, some studies suggest that flexitime can lead to a decrease in employee turnover because employees are more committed to staying with the organization when they have better work-life balance.

So which is the greater effect? Perhaps job satisfaction is a more direct outcome of having flexitime.

Wait, but the question is about what Baltes' meta-analysis found. I'm not exactly sure what Baltes found, but I think that in work-life balance and flexibility studies, job satisfaction is a key outcome.

Another thought: when people are satisfied with their jobs, they're less likely to be absent or leave the company. So maybe the meta-analysis found that the strongest effect was on job satisfaction, which in turn affects other variables like absenteeism and turnover.

So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards option D: overall job satisfaction, being the area with the greatest beneficial effect.

The question asks about the greatest beneficial effect of instituting flexitime in an organization, based on a meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues (1999). Flexitime, which allows employees to choose their working hours within certain limits, can impact various organizational outcomes. Each option is analyzed as follows:

- **Job stress (A):** Flexitime can reduce stress by allowing employees to balance personal and work responsibilities, but this may not be the primary effect.
- **Communication (B):** Flexitime might pose challenges for face-to-face communication, but modern tools can mitigate this, making it less likely to be the greatest benefit.
- **Productivity (C):** Flexitime can increase productivity, especially in jobs where employees can work during their most efficient hours, but this depends on the job type.
- **Overall job satisfaction (D):** Flexibility often leads to higher satisfaction due to better work-life balance and trust from employers, making this a strong candidate.
- **Self-rated performance (E):** While satisfaction and reduced stress might improve self-rated performance, this is not the primary effect of flexitime.
- **Absenteeism (F):** Flexitime can reduce absenteeism by allowing employees to manage personal responsibilities without missing work.
- **Employee turnover (G):** Happier employees are less likely to leave, reducing turnover, but this is often a secondary effect of job satisfaction.
- **Company profitability (H):** While related to productivity and turnover, profitability depends on many factors and is not the direct effect measured in the study.
- **Teamwork (I):** Flexitime might pose challenges for teamwork, but modern tools can help, making this less likely to be the greatest benefit.

The analysis suggests that the greatest beneficial effect of flexitime is likely **overall job satisfaction (D)**, as it is a direct and commonly measured outcome of flexible work arrangements. While absenteeism and turnover may also improve, these are often secondary effects of increased job satisfaction.
