Question:

Kerri ran the same distance in four different races. Her times were 18.04 seconds, 21.39 seconds, 12.99 seconds, and 14.14 seconds. If the individual times are rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a second, what is the estimate of Kerri's total time for all four races?

Options:

A: 66.5 seconds
B: 64.5 seconds
C: 65.6 seconds
D: 66.6 seconds
E: 68 seconds
F: 65.5 seconds
G: 66.4 seconds
H: 66 seconds
I: 67 seconds
J: 67.5 seconds

Okay, so I have this problem here where Kerri ran four races, each the same distance. Her times were 18.04, 21.39, 12.99, and 14.14 seconds. The question asks me to round each time to the nearest tenth of a second and then find the estimated total time for all four races. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break this down. Rounding to the nearest tenth means looking at the hundredths place. If the hundredths digit is 5 or higher, I round the tenths place up by one; otherwise, I keep it as it is.

Starting with the first time: 18.04 seconds. The tenths place is 0, and the hundredths is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I just drop the 4, so it becomes 18.0 seconds. Wait, but in rounding to the nearest tenth, 18.04 is approximately 18.0, right? Or do I write it as 18.0? Hmm, I think it's just 18.0, but sometimes people might write it as 18 if the tenths are zero, but in this context, since the question specifies tenths, maybe I should keep it as 18.0.

Next, the second time is 21.39 seconds. Tenths place is 3, hundredths is 9. Oh wait, no—the tenths is the first decimal. So 21.39: tenths is 3, hundredths is 9. Since 9 is more than or equal to 5, I round the tenths up. So 3 becomes 4. That makes it 21.4 seconds.

Third time is 12.99 seconds. Tenths place is 9, hundredths is 9. Again, 9 is more than 5, so I round up. But wait, the tenths is 9, so rounding up would make it 10. That would carry over to the units place. So 12.99 becomes 13.0 seconds. Because 9 in tenths plus 1 makes 10, so it becomes 13.0.

Fourth time: 14.14 seconds. Tenths place is 1, hundredths is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I leave the tenths as 1. So it rounds down to 14.1 seconds.

Now, adding them up. So let's list the rounded times: 18.0, 21.4, 13.0, and 14.1.

Adding them step by step. First, 18.0 + 21.4. Let's see, 18 + 21 is 39, and 0.0 + 0.4 is 0.4. So that's 39.4 seconds.

Next, add 13.0. 39.4 + 13.0 is 52.4 seconds.

Then, add 14.1. 52.4 + 14.1. Let's do 52 +14 which is 66, and 0.4 + 0.1 is 0.5. So 66 + 0.5 is 66.5 seconds.

Wait, but let me check the addition again. Maybe I added wrong. Let me add all four numbers together:

18.0 + 21.4 = 39.4

39.4 + 13.0 = 52.4

52.4 +14.1 = 66.5

Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 66.5. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the rounding. Let me check each number again.

18.04: 0 in tenths, 4 in hundredths. So it stays 18.0. Correct.

21.39: 3 in tenths, 9 in hundredths. Round up to 21.4. Correct.

12.99: 9 in tenths, 9 in hundredths. Round up to 13.0. Correct.

14.14: 1 in tenths, 4 in hundredths. Stays 14.1. Correct.

So sum is 18.0 + 21.4 = 39.4, plus 13.0 is 52.4, plus 14.1 is 66.5. So the total is 66.5 seconds, which is option A.

To determine Kerri's estimated total time for all four races, we first round each individual time to the nearest tenth of a second:

1. **18.04 seconds**: The tenths place is 0, and the hundredths place is 4. Since 4 < 5, it remains **18.0 seconds**.  
2. **21.39 seconds**: The tenths place is 3, and the hundredths place is 9. Since 9 ≥ 5, it rounds up to **21.4 seconds**.  
3. **12.99 seconds**: The tenths place is 9, and the hundredths place is 9. Since 9 ≥ 5, it rounds up to **13.0 seconds**.  
4. **14.14 seconds**: The tenths place is 1, and the hundredths place is 4. Since 4 < 5, it remains **14.1 seconds**.  

Adding the rounded times:  
\[
18.0 + 21.4 + 13.0 + 14.1 = 66.5 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the estimated total time for all four races is **66.5 seconds**, which corresponds to **option A**.
