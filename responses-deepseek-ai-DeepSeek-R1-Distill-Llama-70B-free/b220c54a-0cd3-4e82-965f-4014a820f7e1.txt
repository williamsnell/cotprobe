Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about philosophy, specifically ethics. The question is about Norcross's views on moral reasoning and its implications. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question states: "Norcross agrees that if a being is incapable of moral reasoning, at even the most basic level, then it cannot be..." and then gives options from A to J. I need to figure out which option correctly completes this statement.

First, I remember that Norcross is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly in areas like moral theory and the ethics of killing. I think he's discussed the differences between moral agents and moral patients. Let me try to recall what each of these terms means.

Moral agents are entities that can act with moral responsibility. They have the capacity to understand right and wrong, make decisions based on that understanding, and thus can be held accountable for their actions. On the other hand, moral patients are beings that can be acted upon morally. They are entitled to receive moral consideration, such as being treated with respect and not being harmed unnecessarily. Importantly, moral patients don't necessarily have the ability to perform moral actions themselves.

So the question is about a being that can't do moral reasoning. If a being can't reason morally, what does that imply? Well, if they can't reason morally, they can't be moral agents because moral agency requires the capacity to understand and make moral decisions. Therefore, such a being can't be a moral agent.

Looking at the options:

A: an object of moral sympathy. Hmm, moral sympathy is about feeling for others. I think even beings without moral reasoning can still be objects of sympathy, like animals or infants. So this might not be the right answer.

B: a morally autonomous being. Moral autonomy involves self-governance based on moral principles. Without moral reasoning, a being can't be autonomous in that sense. So this could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if this is the term Norcross specifically uses.

C: a moral patient. Wait, moral patients don't need to have moral reasoning. They just need to be entities that can be affected by moral actions. So a being incapable of moral reasoning can still be a moral patient. So this wouldn't be the correct answer.

D: a being of moral integrity. Moral integrity involves adhering to moral principles. If a being can't reason morally, they can't have integrity in that sense. But I'm not sure if this is the key term Norcross uses here.

E: a moral agent. As I thought earlier, moral agents need moral reasoning. So this seems like a strong candidate.

F: a subject of moral discourse. I'm not entirely sure what this means, but I think it refers to beings that are discussed in moral terms. Even if they can't reason morally, they can still be subjects, like animals. So probably not the answer.

G: an ethically responsible entity. Responsibility implies the ability to understand and take moral actions, so without reasoning, they can't be responsible. This could be another possible answer, but I think the term is more aligned with moral agent.

H: a being of value. Value isn't necessarily tied to moral reasoning. For example, many ethicists argue that all living beings have value regardless of their cognitive abilities. So this isn't the right choice.

I: a moral observer. I'm not as familiar with this term, but I think it might refer to someone who observes moral rules. If they can't reason morally, they can't observe them in that way. But again, I'm not sure if Norcross uses this term.

J: a morally accountable being. Accountability requires understanding and intention, so without moral reasoning, they can't be held accountable. This is another possible answer, but I think it's similar to moral agent.

Now, I'm trying to remember if Norcross specifically links the inability to reason morally with being a moral agent. Yes, I think he does. Because he discusses how moral agency requires certain capacities, and without them, the being can't be an agent. So the answer is likely E: a moral agent.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question is about what the being "cannot be". If they can't reason morally, they can't be a moral agent. So the correct answer would be E.

The question revolves around Norcross's views on the relationship between moral reasoning and moral status. Norcross argues that moral agency requires the capacity for moral reasoning. A moral agent is an entity that can understand moral principles, make decisions based on them, and be held accountable for its actions. Without the ability to reason morally, a being cannot fulfill these criteria. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, F, H**: These options refer to beings that can still be objects of moral consideration or discussion even without moral reasoning, so they are not correct.  
- **B, D, G, I, J**: While these terms relate to moral responsibility or accountability, they are either less specific or not the primary term Norcross uses in this context.  
- **E**: "A moral agent" directly aligns with Norcross's argument, as moral agency requires moral reasoning.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: a moral agent**.

Answer: E
