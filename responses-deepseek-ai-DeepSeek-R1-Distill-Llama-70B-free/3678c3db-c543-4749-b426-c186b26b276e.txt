Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the hydrogen atom and spectral lines. Hmm, I remember that when electrons transition between energy levels, they emit or absorb photons, and the wavelength of that photon tells us which part of the electromagnetic spectrum we're looking at.

The question gives me the formula for wave number: ĵ = 1/λ = RH [(1/n1²) - (1/n2²)]. Oh wait, RH is the Rydberg constant. I think the Rydberg constant is about 1.097 x 10^7 m^-1. Right, because when I've seen the Rydberg formula before, it's used to calculate the wavelengths of the spectral lines of hydrogen.

So the transition is from n2 =10 to n1=5. Oh wait, wait. Wait, in the formula, n2 is the higher energy level, right? Because when the electron drops from a higher to a lower level, it emits a photon. So in this case, n2 is 10 (initial state, higher) and n1 is 5 (final state, lower). So plugging into the formula: 1/5² is 1/25, 1/10² is 1/100. The difference is (1/25 -1/100) = (4/100 -1/100)=3/100. So 3/100 times RH.

Calculating that: 3/100 is 0.03. Multiply by RH, which is about 1.097e7 m^-1. So 0.03 * 1.097e7 = let's see, 0.03 * 1e7 is 3e5, 0.03 * 0.097e7 is about 2.91e5. So total is around 3e5 + 0.291e5 = 3.291e5 m^-1? Wait, actually wait, 1.097e7 times 0.03 is 1.097e7 * 0.03. Let me calculate that: 1.097e7 is 10,970,000. 10,970,000 * 0.03 = 329,100 m^-1. So the wave number ĵ is 329,100 m^-1. 

Wave number is 1/lambda, so lambda is 1/329100 meters. Let's compute that. 1/329100 is approximately 3.04e-6 meters, which is 3.04 micrometers. Wait, because 1 meter is 1e6 micrometers. So 3.04e-6 meters is 3.04 micrometers, which is 3040 nanometers. 

Wait, the electromagnetic spectrum... visible light is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 3040 nm is way longer than visible. That's in the infrared region. Wait, but wait. Wait, 3 micrometers is 3000 nm, which is near-infrared. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes divisions can be a bit fuzzy.

Wait, the options are: C is Infrared, J is Ultraviolet, D is Extreme Ultraviolet, and F is visible. Wait, but wait, 3040 nm is definitely in the infrared. Because visible is up to about 700 nm, so anything above that is IR.

So the spectral line would be in the infrared region. So the correct answer should be option C: Infrared region.

Wait, but wait, the Rydberg formula gives the wave number. Let me double-check my calculations. n1=5, n2=10. So 1/5² is 0.04, 1/10² is 0.01. The difference is 0.03, so 0.03 * RH. RH is 1.097e7, so 0.03 *1.097e7 is about 329,100 per meter. So wavelength is 1/329100 m, which is approximately 3.04e-6 m, which is 3.04 micrometers, which is 3040 nm. Yep, that's in the infrared.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the region of the electromagnetic spectrum corresponding to the spectral line resulting from the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the tenth energy level (\(n_2 = 10\)) to the fifth energy level (\(n_1 = 5\)), we use the Bohr theory and the Rydberg formula for wave number:

\[
\tilde{\nu} = R_H \left(\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right),
\]

where \(R_H\) is the Rydberg constant (\(R_H \approx 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1}\)).

### Step 1: Calculate the wave number
Substituting \(n_1 = 5\) and \(n_2 = 10\) into the formula:

\[
\tilde{\nu} = R_H \left(\frac{1}{5^2} - \frac{1}{10^2}\right) = R_H \left(\frac{1}{25} - \frac{1}{100}\right) = R_H \left(\frac{4}{100} - \frac{1}{100}\right) = R_H \cdot \frac{3}{100}.
\]

\[
\tilde{\nu} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \cdot 0.03 = 3.291 \times 10^5 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert wave number to wavelength
The wavelength \(\lambda\) is the reciprocal of the wave number:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\tilde{\nu}} = \frac{1}{3.291 \times 10^5} \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

Converting to nanometers (\(1 \, \text{m} = 10^9 \, \text{nm}\)):

\[
\lambda \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 3040 \, \text{nm}.
\]

### Step 3: Identify the region of the electromagnetic spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into regions based on wavelength:

- **Visible light**: \(400 \, \text{nm} \leq \lambda \leq 700 \, \text{nm}\),
- **Infrared (IR)**: \(700 \, \text{nm} < \lambda \leq 1 \, \text{mm}\),
- **Ultraviolet (UV)**: \(10 \, \text{nm} \leq \lambda < 400 \, \text{nm}\),
- **Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)**: \(10 \, \text{nm} > \lambda > 0.1 \, \text{nm}\),
- **X-ray and Gamma-ray**: \(\lambda < 0.1 \, \text{nm}\).

Since the calculated wavelength (\(3040 \, \text{nm}\)) falls within the **infrared region**, the spectral line corresponds to this region.

### Final Answer:
C: Infrared region.
