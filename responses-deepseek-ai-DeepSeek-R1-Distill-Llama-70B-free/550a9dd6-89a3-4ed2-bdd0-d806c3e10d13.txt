Question:

Brown cosigned Royal's $50000 note to State Bank. If Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent what would be Brown's liability on the note?

Options:

A: Liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal.
B: Not liable to pay State as Brown was only a voluntary surety.
C: Liable to pay State only if Royal fails to meet the payment deadline.
D: Not liable to pay State, as Royal's mental incompetency releases all cosigners from liability.
E: Not liable to pay State unless Brown was a compensated surety.
F: Liable to pay State, but only half of the note due to Royal's mental incompetency.
G: Not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety.
H: Liable to pay State on the due date of the note.
I: Not liable to pay State, as Brown's liability is dependent on Royal's mental competency at the time of signing.
J: Liable to pay State, but only if Royal's assets are insufficient to cover the debt.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about cosigning a note and liability when the primary borrower becomes mentally incompetent. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question is: Brown cosigned Royal's $50,000 note to State Bank. If Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent, what's Brown's liability on the note?

First, I need to understand what it means to cosign a note. Cosigning typically means that both the primary borrower and the cosigner are responsible for the debt. So if Royal can't pay, Brown would be on the hook, right?

Wait, but what happens if Royal becomes mentally incompetent? I remember that contracts made by someone who is mentally incompetent might be voidable or void. But does that affect the cosigner's liability?

Let me think. So, if Royal is adjudicated mentally incompetent after signing the note, does that mean the note is invalid? Or does it affect the cosigner's obligation?

In contract law, a person who is mentally incompetent at the time of signing can have their contract declared void or voidable. But when someone cosigns, they are usually jointly and severally liable. That means the bank can go after either party for the full amount.

So, if Royal is mentally incompetent now, does that mean the note is invalid, making Brown not liable? Or does Brown still have to pay because he cosigned, regardless of Royal's current condition?

Wait, I think the key here is that the note was valid when it was signed. Mental incompetence after the fact—like after signing—might not invalidate the contract. Because the person was competent when they entered into the agreement, the contract is valid. So even if Royal becomes incompetent later, the note is still enforceable against both Royal and Brown.

So Brown, as a cosigner, would still be liable. Now, looking at the options.

Option A says Brown is liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal. Hmm, no, because as a cosigner, the bank can choose to go after Brown first without pursuing Royal. So that's not right.

Option B says Brown isn't liable because he's a voluntary surety. Wait, but cosigners are generally liable. Unless there's something about suretyship law that says otherwise. I think sureties can sometimes have defenses, but mental incompetence of the principal after the fact isn't one. Plus, if Brown was a compensated surety, maybe, but the question doesn't say that. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Brown is liable only if Royal fails to meet the deadline. That sounds like it's saying Brown is only secondarily liable, but as a cosigner, Brown is primarily liable. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Not liable because Royal's incompetence releases all cosigners. No, because the note was valid when signed. Incompetence after signing doesn't discharge the debt.

Option E: Not liable unless Brown was a compensated surety. I don't think that's right. Cosigners are usually liable regardless of compensation, unless specific suretyship laws apply. But the question doesn't mention compensation, so E might not be it.

Option F: Liable but only half because of Royal's condition. No, because as a cosigner, Brown is liable for the full amount. The bank can go after him for the entire $50k.

Option G: Not liable because Royal's incompetence discharges him as a surety. Wait, Royal is the principal, not the surety. Brown is the surety. So G doesn't make sense.

Option H: Liable on the due date. Yes, because as a cosigner, Brown is obligated to pay when the note is due, regardless of Royal's current status. So H sounds correct.

Option I: Not liable because Brown's liability depends on Royal's competency at signing. But Royal was competent when signing, so Brown is liable. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient. No, because as a cosigner, Brown is equally responsible. The bank can choose to pursue Brown first without exhausting Royal's assets.

So the correct answer should be H: Liable to pay State on the due date of the note.

Brown cosigned Royal's $50,000 note to State Bank, making him jointly and severally liable for the debt. When Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent, this does not invalidate the note because the contract was valid when signed, as Royal was presumably competent at that time. Mental incompetence after the fact does not discharge the debt or affect Brown's liability as a cosigner. Cosigners are primarily liable for the full amount of the debt, and the bank can pursue Brown directly, regardless of Royal's current condition. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The bank can pursue Brown directly without first seeking payment from Royal.
- **B**: Incorrect. Cosigners are generally liable unless specific suretyship defenses apply, which are not relevant here.
- **C**: Incorrect. Brown is primarily liable and not merely secondary.
- **D**: Incorrect. Royal's later incompetence does not release Brown from liability.
- **E**: Incorrect. Compensation is irrelevant to Brown's liability as a cosigner.
- **F**: Incorrect. Brown is liable for the full amount, not just half.
- **G**: Incorrect. Royal's incompetence does not discharge Brown's liability.
- **H**: Correct. Brown is liable to pay the note on its due date, regardless of Royal's incompetence.
- **I**: Incorrect. Brown's liability does not depend on Royal's current competency.
- **J**: Incorrect. Brown can be held liable even if Royal's assets are sufficient.

The correct answer is **H**.
