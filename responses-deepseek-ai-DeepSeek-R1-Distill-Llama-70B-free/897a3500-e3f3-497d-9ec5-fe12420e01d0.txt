Okay, so I've got this question about gases and their diffusion rates. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that diffusion rates are related to the molar mass of the gases. Oh right, Graham's Law! It's about the effusion rates. Graham's Law says that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar masses. So the lighter gas should diffuse faster.

The question gives me the weights of 1 liter of each gas at standard conditions. Oxygen is 1.44 g and hydrogen is 0.09 g. Wait, standard conditions, so I assume that's 1 atmosphere and 0 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, no, standard temperature and pressure is usually 0Â°C and 1 atm. But wait, the molar volume at STP is 22.4 liters per mole. So 1 liter would be 1/22.4 moles.

So for oxygen, molar mass is 32 g/mol (since O2 is 16*2=32). Hydrogen's molar mass is 2 g/mol (H2 is 1*2=2).

Wait, the question is about diffusion rates. So using Graham's Law, the rate is proportional to 1/sqrt(M), where M is molar mass. So the rate ratio is sqrt(M2/M1). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The formula is Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So the lighter gas (lower molar mass) will have a higher rate.

So let me compute the molar masses. Oxygen is 32 g/mol, Hydrogen is 2 g/mol.

So Rate of H2 / Rate of O2 = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) = 4. So H2 diffuses 4 times faster than O2.

Looking at the options, option D says "Hydrogen diffuses 4 times faster than oxygen." So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. So I calculated the molar masses correctly. Then applied Graham's Law as the ratio of rates being the square root of the inverse ratio of molar masses. So yes, because Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So M2 is O2's molar mass, M1 is H2's. So sqrt(32/2) is sqrt(16)=4. So H2 is 4 times faster. So the right option is D.

To determine which gas diffuses faster, we use Graham's Law of Effusion, which states that the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas. The formula is:

\[
\frac{\text{Rate}_1}{\text{Rate}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}
\]

Here, \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) are the molar masses of the two gases. The lighter the gas, the faster it diffuses.

- Molar mass of hydrogen (\(H_2\)) = 2 g/mol  
- Molar mass of oxygen (\(O_2\)) = 32 g/mol  

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\frac{\text{Rate of Hydrogen}}{\text{Rate of Oxygen}} = \sqrt{\frac{32}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4
\]

This means hydrogen diffuses 4 times faster than oxygen. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**D: Hydrogen diffuses 4 times faster than oxygen.**
