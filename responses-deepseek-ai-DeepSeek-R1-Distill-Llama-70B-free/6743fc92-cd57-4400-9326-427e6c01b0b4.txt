Okay, so I've got this bond question here. Hmm, let me think about how bonds work. I remember bonds have face value, coupon rate, years to maturity, and yield. The price is what I'm looking for here.

The question says it's an 8% bond with 18 years to maturity and a yield of 9%. I need to find the price. Oh right, when the yield is higher than the coupon rate, the bond sells at a discount. Because if the yield is higher, investors pay less to get the same coupon payments, which effectively increases the return.

So the formula for the price of a bond is the present value of all its cash flows. The cash flows are the annual coupons plus the face value at maturity. Since this is an annual coupon bond, I'll use the present value of an annuity formula for the coupons and the present value formula for the face value.

The face value is usually $100, right? So I'll assume that. The coupon payment each year is 8% of $100, which is $8 annually. 

The formula is Price = (C / (1 + r)^t) summed from t=1 to n + (F / (1 + r)^n), where C is the coupon, r is the yield, and F is the face value.

So plugging in the numbers: C is $8, r is 9% or 0.09, n is 18 years.

Wait, I should calculate this step by step. Let me break it down.

First, the present value of the coupons. That's an ordinary annuity. The present value of an ordinary annuity formula is C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So for the coupons: 8 * [1 - (1.09)^-18 ] / 0.09.

Then the present value of the face value is 100 / (1.09)^18.

I think I need to calculate both parts and add them together.

Calculating the first part: the annuity factor.

Let me compute (1.09)^-18. Wait, that's the same as 1/(1.09)^18. What's 1.09 to the 18th power? I might need to approximate this.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula step by step. Or perhaps I can remember that the present value factor for an annuity can be found using tables or a financial calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation method or recall standard present value factors, but I'm not sure about exact values. Maybe I can use logarithms to compute (1.09)^18.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on calculating the exact value without a calculator. But maybe I can think in terms of the answer options. Let's see, the options given are A:91.17, B:100, C:110, D:88.34, E:105.68, F:85.23, G:95.50, H:102.56, I:77.89, J:120.45.

Since the yield is higher than the coupon rate (9% vs 8%), the bond should sell at a discount, so the price is less than 100. So options above 100 are out. So B, C, E, H, J are above 100, so the correct answer must be among A, D, F, G, I.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options again. Option A is 91.17, D is 88.34, F is 85.23, G is 95.50, I is 77.89.

Hmm. So probably around low 90s or lower.

Wait, but I think I should try to compute the present value.

Let me make an approximation. The present value of the coupons is 8 per year times the present value annuity factor for 18 years at 9%.

The present value annuity factor (PVIFA) is [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So PVIFA = [1 - (1.09)^-18 ] / 0.09.

Calculating (1.09)^-18: I can compute this as e^(-18 * ln(1.09)).

Compute ln(1.09) ≈ 0.08617.

So 18 * 0.08617 ≈ 1.551.

e^-1.551 ≈ 0.212.

So (1.09)^-18 ≈ 0.212.

So the numerator is 1 - 0.212 = 0.788.

Divide by 0.09: 0.788 / 0.09 ≈ 8.755.

So the present value of the coupons is 8 * 8.755 ≈ 70.04.

Now the present value of the face value: 100 / (1.09)^18.

We already approximated (1.09)^18 ≈ 1/0.212 ≈ 4.717.

So 100 / 4.717 ≈ 21.20.

Adding the two parts: 70.04 + 21.20 ≈ 91.24.

Looking at the options, option A is 91.17, which is very close to my approximation. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the approximation of (1.09)^18.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another approach. Let me try using the rule of 72 to estimate how long it takes for an investment at 9% to double. 72 /9=8 years. So in 8 years, it doubles. In 16 years, it would be 4 times (since 8 years doubles, another 8 makes it 4x). So at 18 years, it's a bit more than 4 times. Let's say approximately 4.2 times.

So (1.09)^18 ≈ 4.2, so 100/(4.2) ≈ 23.81.

Wait, earlier I thought it was about 21.2, but with this method, it's about 23.8.

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately. Let's think: 1.09^18.

Compute step by step:

1.09^1 = 1.09

^2 = 1.1881

^4 = (1.1881)^2 ≈ 1.4145

^8 = (1.4145)^2 ≈ 2.0

Wait, that's not right. Because 1.09^8 is actually about 2.172... Hmm, wait, maybe I should compute 1.09^2=1.1881; ^4= (1.1881)^2 ≈ 1.4145; ^8 = (1.4145)^2≈ 2.0; but wait, 1.09^8 is actually higher than 2, maybe around 2.172.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that my initial approximation was about 4.717, which made the face value about 21.20, and the annuity about 70.04, totaling about 91.24. Since option A is 91.17, that's very close.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is A:91.17.

To determine the price of an 8% bond with 18 years to maturity and a yield of 9%, we use the bond pricing formula:

\[
\text{Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Here:
- \( C = 8 \) (annual coupon payment, 8% of the face value),
- \( r = 0.09 \) (yield),
- \( F = 100 \) (face value),
- \( n = 18 \) (years to maturity).

### Step 1: Present Value of Coupons (Annuity)
The present value of the coupons is calculated using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
\text{PV}_{\text{coupons}} = C \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{PV}_{\text{coupons}} = 8 \cdot \frac{1 - (1.09)^{-18}}{0.09}
\]

First, calculate \( (1.09)^{-18} \), which is approximately \( 0.212 \). Thus:

\[
\text{PV}_{\text{coupons}} = 8 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.212}{0.09} = 8 \cdot \frac{0.788}{0.09} = 8 \cdot 8.755 \approx 70.04
\]

### Step 2: Present Value of Face Value
The present value of the face value is:

\[
\text{PV}_{\text{face}} = \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{PV}_{\text{face}} = \frac{100}{(1.09)^{18}}
\]

Using \( (1.09)^{18} \approx 4.717 \):

\[
\text{PV}_{\text{face}} = \frac{100}{4.717} \approx 21.20
\]

### Step 3: Total Bond Price
Adding the two components:

\[
\text{Price} = \text{PV}_{\text{coupons}} + \text{PV}_{\text{face}} = 70.04 + 21.20 \approx 91.24
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated price of the bond is approximately $91.24, which is very close to option A ($91.17). Since the bond sells at a discount (yield > coupon rate), the correct answer is:

**A: 91.17**
