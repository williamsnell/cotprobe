Okay, so I've got this insurance problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Mr. Fields owns a house worth $30,000. He has a fire insurance policy for $20,000, and there's an 80% coinsurance clause. A fire causes $10,800 in damage. I need to find out how much the insurance company will pay.

Hmm, right. Coinsurance clauses can be a bit tricky. From what I remember, coinsurance means that the insured and the insurer share the loss in a certain proportion. The idea is to encourage the insured to carry adequate insurance. If the insured doesn't carry enough coverage, they might have to pay a part of the loss themselves.

So, the coinsurance clause here is 80%. I think that means the policy requires that the insured's coverage is at least 80% of the property's value. If they meet this, the insurer pays the full amount of the loss up to the policy limit. If not, the insured has to pay a part of the loss.

Wait, let me get this straight. The formula I think is involved here is to determine the actual cash value (ACV) of the loss. The ACV is the cost to repair or replace the property minus depreciation. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the coinsurance clause in fire insurance policies usually works by requiring the insured to maintain coverage equal to a certain percentage (here, 80%) of the property's value. If they do, the insurance company covers the loss up to the policy limit. If they don't, the company only pays a proportionate share.

So, first, I need to check if Mr. Fields meets the coinsurance requirement. His house is worth $30,000, and the policy is $20,000. The required coverage is 80% of $30,000, which is 0.8 * 30,000 = $24,000. Oh wait, his policy is only $20,000, which is less than the required $24,000. So he's underinsured.

Wait, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me think again. The coinsurance clause is part of the policy, and it says that the insured must carry insurance equal to 80% of the property's value. If they do, then in the event of a loss, the insurance company will pay the full amount of the loss, up to the policy limits. If not, then the company will only pay proportionally.

So, in this case, the property is worth $30,000, so 80% of that is $24,000. The policy is $20,000, which is less than $24,000. So he doesn't meet the 80% requirement. Therefore, the insurance company won't pay the full $10,800. Instead, they'll pay based on the ratio of the policy amount to the required amount.

So the ratio is $20,000 (policy) / $24,000 (80% of value) = 0.8333... or 5/6 approximately.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula I remember is that the insurance company's payment is the lesser of (1) the policy limit, or (2) the actual loss, multiplied by the ratio of the policy amount to the required coinsurance amount. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the insured's share and the insurer's share. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Determine the face value of the policy: $20,000.

2. Calculate the required coverage (80% of the property's value): 0.8 * $30,000 = $24,000.

3. Compare the policy amount to the required coverage. Since $20k < $24k, the insured is underinsured.

4. The insurance company will pay based on the ratio of the policy to the required coverage. So the ratio is 20k / 24k = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

5. The actual loss is $10,800. So the insurance company will pay (5/6) * $10,800.

Let me compute that: 10,800 * (5/6) = 10,800 ÷ 6 = 1,800; 1,800 *5=9,000. So the payment would be $9,000.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the insurance company's liability is the lesser of the policy limit or the calculated amount. Let me check. Let's say the loss is $10,800, and after applying the coinsurance ratio, we get $9,000, which is less than the policy limit of $20,000. So yes, the insurance company would pay $9,000.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the coinsurance works by the company paying up to the policy limit, but the formula is (policy amount / required amount) * loss, but not exceeding the policy limit. So yes, in this case, 20/24 * 10,800 = 9,000, which is under the $20,000 policy, so that's the payment.

So the correct answer should be $9,000, which is option D.

But let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

- Property value: $30k.

- Coinsurance: 80% → requires $24k coverage.

- Policy is $20k, which is less than required.

- So the company's payment is (20/24) * actual loss.

- Actual loss is $10,800.

- (20/24) * 10,800 = (5/6)*10,800 = 9,000.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is D: $9,000.

To determine how much the insurance company will pay for the loss, we need to analyze the coinsurance clause and the policy details. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Property Value and Coinsurance Requirement**:  
   The house is worth $30,000, and the policy contains an 80% coinsurance clause. This means the insured is required to carry at least $24,000 in coverage (80% of $30,000).

2. **Policy Coverage**:  
   Mr. Fields has a policy of $20,000, which is less than the required $24,000. Therefore, he is underinsured.

3. **Coinsurance Penalty**:  
   Since the insured does not meet the required coverage, the insurance company will pay only a proportionate share of the loss. The proportion is calculated as the ratio of the policy amount to the required coverage:  
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\$20,000}{\$24,000} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333
   \]

4. **Loss and Payment Calculation**:  
   The actual loss due to the fire is $10,800. The insurance company will pay the loss multiplied by the ratio:  
   \[
   \text{Payment} = \$10,800 \times \frac{5}{6} = \$9,000
   \]

5. **Final Payment**:  
   The insurance company will pay $9,000, which is less than the policy limit of $20,000.

Thus, the insurance company will pay **$9,000** on the loss.
