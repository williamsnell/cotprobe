Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this. I'm a bit rusty on my division, especially with decimals, but I think I can figure it out.

First, I remember that dividing by a decimal can be tricky. Maybe I should convert the divisor, which is 0.7, into a whole number to make the division easier. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10. That way, I'm not changing the value of the division, just making the numbers easier to work with.

So, 5.04 divided by 0.7 becomes (5.04 * 10) divided by (0.7 * 10). Let me calculate that. 5.04 times 10 is 50.4, and 0.7 times 10 is 7. So now the problem is 50.4 divided by 7.

Alright, now I just need to do 50.4 ÷ 7. Let's think about how many times 7 goes into 50.4. I can start by seeing how many times 7 fits into 50. Well, 7 times 7 is 49, which is close to 50. So that's 7 times. 7 times 7 is 49, subtract that from 50, and I get 1. Then bring down the 4, making it 14.

Now, how many times does 7 go into 14? Exactly 2 times. So adding that to the earlier 7, I get 7.2. Wait, let me write that out to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, 50.4 ÷ 7 equals 7.2. Therefore, 5.04 divided by 0.7 is 7.2. Let me check the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.2. So that's the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me double-check my calculations just to be safe.

Another way to approach this is by moving the decimal places. Since 0.7 has one decimal place, I can multiply both numbers by 10 to eliminate the decimal. So 5.04 becomes 50.4 and 0.7 becomes 7, which is the same as before. So dividing 50.4 by 7 gives 7.2. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can use estimation to confirm. 0.7 is almost 1, so 5 divided by 1 is 5. But since 0.7 is a bit less than 1, the result should be a bit higher than 5. 7.2 is higher than 5 and makes sense because 0.7 times 7 is 4.9, which is close to 5.04. So 0.7 times 7.2 should be approximately 5.04. Let me calculate that: 0.7 * 7 is 4.9, and 0.7 * 0.2 is 0.14. Adding those together, 4.9 + 0.14 equals 5.04. Perfect, that matches the original numerator. So my answer must be correct.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is 7.2, which is option C.

The problem is to find the quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7. To simplify the division, multiply both the numerator (5.04) and the denominator (0.7) by 10 to eliminate the decimal. This transforms the problem into 50.4 ÷ 7. 

Performing the division, 7 goes into 50 seven times (7 × 7 = 49), leaving a remainder of 1. Bringing down the 4 makes it 14. Since 7 goes into 14 twice, the result is 7.2. 

To confirm, multiply 0.7 by 7.2: 0.7 × 7 = 4.9 and 0.7 × 0.2 = 0.14. Adding these gives 5.04, which matches the original numerator. Thus, the correct answer is 7.2.

C: 7.2
