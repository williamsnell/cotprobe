Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about drawing a card from a standard deck and finding the probability that at least one of three events occurs: A, B, or C. 

First, I need to understand each event clearly.

Event A is drawing a heart. A standard deck has 52 cards, with 13 hearts. So the probability of A is 13/52, which simplifies to 1/4. But I don't think I'll need to calculate each individually; instead, I need to find the probability that at least one of A, B, or C happens.

Wait, the question is about the probability of at least one of the events occurring. Hmm. So that includes any of the events happening alone or in combination. 

I remember that for such problems, the inclusion-exclusion principle is useful. The formula for the probability of A or B or C occurring is P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A and B) - P(A and C) - P(B and C) + P(A and B and C). 

But wait, each event is a bit different. Let me define each event more precisely.

Event A: The card is a heart. So 13 cards.

Event B: The card is not a face card. Face cards are Jack, Queen, King, and Ace, I think. Wait, wait. Wait, sometimes Ace isn't considered a face card, but in many contexts, it's not. Wait, in a standard deck, there are 12 face cards: each suit has Jack, Queen, King, and Ace? Or is Ace not a face card? Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Wait, no, I think face cards are Jack, Queen, King. So three per suit, totaling 12. So non-face cards would be 52 - 12 = 40 cards. So Event B is drawing a non-face card, which is 40/52.

Event C: The number of spots on the card is divisible by 3. Spots refer to the pips on the card. So, for numbered cards, that's the number on them. But wait, face cards like Jack, Queen, King don't have spots, right? So their number of spots is zero. So zero is divisible by 3 because 0 divided by any non-zero number is zero, which is an integer. So for any face card, since spots are zero, C is true.

Wait, let me think again. So for each card, if it's a number card, the number of spots is equal to its value (like 2 has two spots, up to 10). But wait, 10 has ten spots? Or is there a different way? Hmm, wait, in a standard deck, the number cards go from Ace (which is 1) up to 10, and then Jack, Queen, King. So Ace is 1 spot, 2 is two, up to 10, which has 10 spots. So the number of spots for a number card is its number. So for each such card, if that number is divisible by 3, then C occurs.

So for number cards, check if the value mod 3 is zero. So 3, 6, 9, and 10? Wait no, 10 mod 3 is 1, since 3*3=9, 10-9=1. So 3, 6, 9 in each suit. That's three cards per suit, so 3*4=12. Plus, the face cards (Jack, Queen, King, Ace?), but wait, face cards have zero spots. So for any face card, the number of spots is zero, which is divisible by 3. So all face cards (12 in total) satisfy event C.

Wait, but wait: if a face card has zero spots, and zero is divisible by 3, then all face cards would make event C true. So how many face cards are there? Each suit has 3 face cards (Jack, Queen, King). So 3 *4 =12 face cards. So for C, the number of favorable cards is 12 (face cards) plus the number of number cards (non-face) whose spot count is divisible by 3.

Wait, but wait: number cards are from Ace (1) to 10. So in each suit, the number of number cards is 10 (Ace to 10), but wait, sometimes Ace may be considered separately. But for this problem, I think number cards are Ace to 10, so 10 per suit, 40 total.

So for each of these 40, we check if their value is divisible by 3. So that's numbers 3, 6, 9, and 10 (wait, 10 mod 3 is 1, so no). So in each suit, the number cards that satisfy C are 3,6,9. So 3 per suit. So 3*4=12.

Therefore, the total number of cards where C occurs is 12 (from number cards) + 12 (face cards) =24.

Wait wait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. For the number cards (non-face), the spot count is their number. So for each number card, if the number is divisible by 3, then C is true. So 3,6,9 in each suit, which is 3*4=12. For face cards, their spot count is zero, which is divisible by 3, so all 12 face cards also satisfy C. So C is 12 +12=24 cards. So 24/52.

Wait, but wait, in the initial part, I thought that all face cards are included in C. So for any card, if it's a face card, C is true. So that's 12 cards. Then, for the number cards (40 in total), the ones with numbers divisible by 3 are 3,6,9: 3 per suit, 4 suits, so 12. So yes, 24 in total.

So now, the problem is to find the probability that at least one of A, B, or C occurs.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability that none of A, B, or C occur. Because the event that at least one happens is the complement of the event that none happen.

So, P(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 1 - P(not A and not B and not C).

Hmm, yes, that might be easier.

So, what's not A, not B, and not C?

Not A: the card is not a heart. So 52-13=39 cards.

Not B: the card is a face card. Because B is not a face card, so not B is being a face card. There are 12 face cards.

Not C: the number of spots is not divisible by 3. So the card is a number card (since face cards have zero spots which is divisible by 3, so face cards can't be in not C). So for number cards, spots not divisible by 3. So in each suit, the number cards that are not 3,6,9. So 10-3=7 per suit. So 7*4=28.

Wait, wait, wait. Not C is when the number of spots is not divisible by 3. So for face cards (which are 12), their spots are zero, which is divisible by 3, so they cannot be in not C. So only the number cards can be in not C. The number cards are 40, of which 12 have spots divisible by 3, so 28 have spots not divisible by 3.

So, the intersection of not A, not B, and not C is the set of cards that are not hearts, are face cards (since not B is being a face card), and are such that their spots are not divisible by 3. But wait, face cards don't have spots, so their spots are zero. So any face card cannot satisfy not C because their spots (zero) are divisible by 3, so they can't be in not C. Therefore, the intersection is empty. Because not C requires the card to be a number card with spots not divisible by 3, but not B requires the card to be a face card. So there's no card that is both a face card and a number card. So the intersection not A and not B and not C is empty. So P(not A and not B and not C) is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. So, if I'm looking for cards that are not A (not hearts), not B (so they are face cards), and not C (spots not divisible by 3). So these are face cards that are not hearts. Because not A is not hearts, not B is being a face card. So the card is a face card and not a heart. But face cards have spots zero, which is divisible by 3, so they don't satisfy not C. So the number of such cards is zero because any such card (face, not heart) would have spots zero, which is divisible by 3, so not C would exclude them. So the intersection is empty. So the number of such cards is zero.

Thus, P(not A and not B and not C) is zero. So P(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 1 - 0 = 1. But that can't be right because the options don't have 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating not B. Let me clarify. Event B is that the card is not a face card. So not B would be the card is a face card. So the face cards are 12 in total. So, to find the intersection of not A, not B, and not C: the card is not a heart, is a face card, and has spots not divisible by 3. But face cards have spots zero, which is divisible by 3, so they cannot satisfy not C. So the intersection is indeed empty, so zero. So P(A ∪ B ∪ C) =1. But the options don't have 1 as an option, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the events. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I got Event B wrong. Let me re-express the events:

Event A: heart (13 cards)
Event B: not a face card (so 40 cards)
Event C: spots divisible by 3 (24 cards, as calculated earlier)

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using inclusion-exclusion.

So, P(A ∪ B ∪ C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A ∩ B) - P(A ∩ C) - P(B ∩ C) + P(A ∩ B ∩ C)

But maybe that's a better approach.

So let's calculate each term.

First, P(A) =13/52=1/4.

P(B)=40/52=10/13.

P(C)=24/52=6/13.

Now, P(A ∩ B): This is the probability that the card is a heart and not a face card. So how many hearts are not face cards? There are 13 hearts, 3 of which are face cards (Jack, Queen, King of hearts). So 13-3=10 non-face heart cards. So P(A ∩ B)=10/52=5/26.

P(A ∩ C): The card is a heart and has spots divisible by 3. So in hearts, the number cards with spots divisible by 3 are 3,6,9. So 3 cards. Plus, the face cards in hearts are Jack, Queen, King. Each has zero spots, which is divisible by 3. So 3 face cards. So total 3+3=6. So P(A ∩ C)=6/52=3/26.

P(B ∩ C): The card is not a face card and has spots divisible by 3. So B is non-face, so number cards. C is spots divisible by 3. So these are the number cards (non-face) with 3,6,9. So 3 per suit, 4 suits: 12. So P(B ∩ C)=12/52=3/13.

Now, P(A ∩ B ∩ C): The card is a heart, not a face card, and has spots divisible by 3. So, hearts that are number cards with 3,6,9: 3 cards. So 3/52.

Putting it all together:

P(A ∪ B ∪ C) = (13 +40 +24)/52 - (10 +6 +12)/52 + (3)/52

Wait, wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Wait, the formula is P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A∩B) - P(A∩C) - P(B∩C) + P(A∩B∩C)

So in terms of counts (since denominator is 52, I can compute numerators and then divide by 52):

= [13 +40 +24] - [10 +6 +12] + [3]

Let me compute that:

13+40=53; 53+24=77.

10+6=16; 16+12=28.

So 77 -28 =49; 49 +3=52.

So 52/52=1. Again, that's 1. But that can't be right because the options don't have 1. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the counts somewhere. Let me recheck each component.

Let me recalculate each part carefully.

First, P(A)=13.

P(B)=40.

P(C)=24.

P(A ∩ B): Hearts that are not face cards. Hearts have 13 cards. Face cards in hearts are 3 (Jack, Queen, King). So 13-3=10. So 10.

P(A ∩ C): Hearts where spots divisible by 3. So number cards in hearts with 3,6,9: 3 cards. Plus, face cards in hearts: 3 cards (since their spots are zero, which is divisible by 3). So 3+3=6.

P(B ∩ C): Non-face cards (so number cards) with spots divisible by 3. So each suit has 3,6,9: 3 per suit, 4 suits: 12.

P(A ∩ B ∩ C): Hearts that are non-face and have spots divisible by 3. So, in hearts, non-face cards with 3,6,9: 3 cards.

So, putting it all together:

P(A ∪ B ∪ C) = (13 +40 +24) - (10 +6 +12) +3 = (77) - (28) +3 = 77-28=49 +3=52.

52/52=1. So probability is 1. But that's impossible because the options don't have 1. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be some mistake. Let me think again. Perhaps the way I defined event C is wrong. Wait, does event C include face cards? Because if a card is a face card, it has zero spots, which is divisible by 3. So yes, all face cards satisfy event C. So event C includes all face cards (12) plus the number cards with spots divisible by 3 (12), totaling 24.

But let me check: when I calculate P(A ∪ B ∪ C), could it really include all possibilities except when none of A, B, C occurs. But earlier, I thought that the only way none occur is when the card is a non-heart, a face card (so not B), and has spots not divisible by 3. But wait, face cards have spots zero, which is divisible by 3. So a face card can't have spots not divisible by 3. So the intersection of not A, not B, and not C would be zero. Thus, P(A ∪ B ∪ C) is 1. But that's not possible because the options don't have 1. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, another approach: Let me list all the possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of counts. Let me try that.

Total favorable for A ∪ B ∪ C = Number of cards that are hearts, or non-face, or have spots divisible by 3.

Alternatively, since it's easier to calculate the complement, as I did before, but I must have made a mistake there.

Wait, the complement is not A, not B, not C.

Not A: not a heart (39 cards).

Not B: is a face card (12 cards).

Not C: spots not divisible by 3 (28 number cards, because spots not divisible by 3, and zero face cards, since face cards have zero which is divisible by 3).

So the intersection of not A, not B, and not C is the set of cards that are not hearts, are face cards, and have spots not divisible by 3. But face cards have spots zero, which is divisible by 3. So this set is empty. So the number of such cards is zero. Therefore, the probability of the complement is zero, so the probability of A ∪ B ∪ C is 1 - 0 =1. But that can't be right because that's not one of the options.

Hmm, I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding event B. Let me re-express event B.

Event B: a card which is not a face card is drawn. So non-face cards are 40. So B occurs when the card is a non-face card.

So, to find P(A ∪ B ∪ C), perhaps it's easier to think about which cards are NOT in A, B, or C.

A card not in A: not a heart.

A card not in B: is a face card.

A card not in C: spots not divisible by 3.

So, the cards that are not in A, not in B, and not in C are the ones that are not hearts, are face cards, and have spots not divisible by 3.

But face cards have spots zero, which is divisible by 3. So a face card can't have spots not divisible by 3. Therefore, there are zero such cards. So the number of cards not in A ∪ B ∪ C is zero. So the probability is 1.

But again, the options don't have 1, so I must have messed up.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating event C. Let me re-examine event C. Event C is the number of spots on the card is divisible by 3.

Wait, the Ace has one spot. So if the card is an Ace, does it count as 1 spot? So
