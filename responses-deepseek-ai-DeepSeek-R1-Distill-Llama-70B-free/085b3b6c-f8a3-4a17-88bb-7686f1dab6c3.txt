Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about marketing research, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: "Marketing research:" and then there are options from A to G. I need to pick the right one.

First, I should probably recall what marketing research actually involves. From what I remember, marketing research is about gathering and analyzing data to help make informed marketing decisions. It's not just about presenting a product without research, so option A is probably wrong. 

Option B says it involves only understanding the industry's structural characteristics. Hmm, I think marketing research is broader than that. It looks into consumer behavior, market trends, competitors, and more, not just the structure of the industry. So B might not be correct.

Option C states it's work done to understand how to make specific marketing strategy decisions. That sounds right because the whole point of marketing research is to inform strategies, like what products to launch, target markets, pricing, etc. So C seems like a strong candidate.

Option D claims it's only concerned with social research, ignoring market and opinion research. Wait, no, marketing research actually encompasses all those areasâ€”market research (about the market), opinion research (like consumer opinions), and sometimes social research (broader societal impacts). So D is incorrect because it's not only social.

Option E says it's solely about collecting data without analysis. No, that's not right. Analysis is a big part of research. You collect data and then analyze it to draw conclusions. So E is wrong.

Option F says it's deciding the marketing strategy without external data. That can't be right because marketing research is all about using external data to make decisions. So F is incorrect.

Option G claims it's only about opinion research, ignoring market and social. No, again, marketing research includes market research, opinion, and sometimes social aspects. So G is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C because it accurately describes marketing research as the process of understanding how to make specific marketing strategy decisions.
