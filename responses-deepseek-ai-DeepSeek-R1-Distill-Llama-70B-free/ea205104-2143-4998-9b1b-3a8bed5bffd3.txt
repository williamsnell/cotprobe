Okay, so I've got this DC generator problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. I'm a bit rusty on generators, but let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says it's a two-pole DC generator. The armature has 40 conductors connected in two parallel paths. The flux per pole is 6.48 × 10^8 lines, which I think is probably in maxwells because that's a common unit for flux. Oh wait, but sometimes flux is given in webers; but I remember that 1 weber is 10^8 maxwells. Wait no, actually, 1 maxwell is 10^-8 weber. So 6.48e8 maxwells is 6.48 weber? Or wait, perhaps the problem states it's lines of flux, so maybe it's already in webers. Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Wait, the standard formula uses flux in webers, so I'll have to check that.

The speed is 30 rpm. So, revolutions per minute. The armature's conductors are arranged in two parallel paths, so that's important for calculating the generated voltage per path.

Each conductor has a resistance of 0.01 ohms, and the current-carrying capacity is 10 A per conductor. So each conductor can handle up to 10 A.

The questions are (a) to (d), but the options give all four values together, so I need to compute each part.

Let me list what I need to find:

(a) The average generated voltage per path and the generated armature voltage.

Wait, wait. Wait, generated voltage per path and the total armature voltage? Since it's two parallel paths, I think the generated voltage per path would be the same as the total armature voltage when the current is shared between the two paths. Or wait, in a parallel setup, the voltage across each path is the same as the terminal voltage. Oh, but when the generator is running, the generated EMF would be split across the two paths. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no. In a DC machine, when the armature is connected in parallel paths, the generated EMF per path (E) is determined by the speed, flux, etc., and the total armature voltage would be the same as each path's EMF, since they're in parallel. Wait, but no. Wait, perhaps the generated EMF per conductor depends on the number of conductors in series per path.

Wait, let's recall the formula for generated voltage. The average generated voltage (EMF) in a DC machine is given by E = (PφZN)/(60A), where P is the number of poles, φ is flux per pole in webers, Z is the number of conductors, N is speed in rpm, and A is the number of parallel paths.

So for part (a), the average generated voltage per path would be E, and the total armature voltage would also be E because in a two-parallel-path setup, each path has the same voltage. So E per path is the same as the total armature voltage.

Wait, but wait, the formula I remember is E = (PφZ N)/(60 A). So P is 2, φ is 6.48e-8 Wb? Or wait, 6.48e8 lines—wait, I'm getting confused about the units. Wait, 1 Wb = 1e8 maxwells. So if flux is 6.48e8 lines, perhaps that's 6.48e8 maxwells, which would be 6.48 Wb. Because 1e8 maxwells is 1 Wb.

So phi (φ) would be 6.48 Wb.

So let's plug into the formula. P is 2 poles, φ is 6.48 Wb, Z is 40 conductors, N is 30 rpm, A is 2 parallel paths.

So E = (2 * 6.48 * 40 * 30) / (60 * 2) 

Let me compute that step by step.

Compute numerator: 2 * 6.48 =12.96, 12.96 *40=518.4, 518.4 *30=15552.

Denominator: 60 *2=120.

So E = 15552 /120 = 129.6 volts.

Wait, so the generated armature voltage is 129.6 V, and since there are two parallel paths, each path has that voltage? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait no, the formula gives the total generated voltage across the armature. Since the armature has A parallel paths, each path's voltage is E / A? Or is the total E the same across each path because they're in parallel?

Wait, no. Wait, in the formula, E is the total generated EMF, regardless of the number of paths. Because when you have A parallel paths, each path has E_path = E / A.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in a parallel connection, voltage across each path is the same as the total. No, wait, no. Wait, each parallel path would have the same voltage as the terminal voltage. So when the machine is operating, the terminal voltage is E - Ia Ra, but when calculating the generated EMF, if the armature is connected in A parallel paths, then the generated EMF per path would be E_total / A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The formula E = (PφZN)/(60A) gives the generated EMF at the terminals, considering the number of parallel paths. So if A is 2, then E is the total generated voltage, same as each path's EMF. Wait no, no. Because in the formula, E is the total EMF, which is the sum of the voltages across each conductor in series per path. So each path's EMF is E per path.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just proceed with the calculation. According to the formula, E = (2 * 6.48 *40 *30)/(60 *2).

So 2*6.48 =12.96, 12.96 *40=518.4, 518.4*30=15552, divided by (60 *2)=120: 15552/120=129.6 V.

So that's the generated armature voltage, which is part (a)'s second value. The average generated voltage per path would be the same as this because in a two-parallel-path setup, each path's generated voltage is E, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, no. Each path would have a generated EMF. Let me think: each conductor is in one of the two parallel paths. So each path has Z/A conductors in series? Wait, Z is 40 conductors, A is 2, so each path has 20 conductors in series.

Wait, but the generated EMF for each path would be based on the number of conductors in series in that path. So each path's EMF would be (P φ (Z/A) N ) / (60). Wait, because each path has Z/A conductors in series.

So E_per_path = (P φ (Z/A) N) / (60).

So substituting: P=2, φ=6.48 Wb, Z/A=20, N=30.

E_per_path = (2 *6.48 *20 *30) /60.

Calculating: 2*6.48=12.96, *20=259.2, *30=7776. Divided by 60: 7776/60=129.6 V. So same as before.

Wait, that's the same as the total armature EMF because when you have two parallel paths, each path's EMF is 129.6 V, so the total armature EMF is the same because they're in parallel. So part (a): average generated voltage per path is 129.6 V, and the armature voltage is also 129.6 V.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says (a) 129.6 V, and the armature voltage is 129.6 V. So that matches.

Now, moving on to part (b): the armature current delivered to an external load.

The armature current is determined by the number of parallel paths and the current each conductor can carry. Each conductor can carry 10 A, and each parallel path has (Z/A)/2 conductors in series, but maybe that's not the right way to think.

Wait, the current in each conductor is I_conductor, and since there are A parallel paths, each path's current would be I_armature / A.

Wait, but each conductor's current is given as 10 A maximum. Wait, in a generator, the current flows from the brushes to the external load. So for a two-pole machine with two parallel paths, each path can carry a certain current.

Wait, the maximum current per conductor is 10 A. Since each conductor is in a specific path, the total current per path would be I_path = I_conductor * number_of_conductors_per_path_in_parallel ?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of parallel paths. The total armature current I_a is equal to the sum of the currents in each parallel path. Since the two paths are in parallel, the voltage across each is the same, but the currents add up.

But each conductor in a path can carry up to 10 A. So how many conductors are in each path? Since there are 40 conductors and 2 paths, each path has 20 conductors. But wait, in a DC machine, the conductors are arranged in a way that each path consists of a certain number of coils connected in series, but perhaps in this case, the conductors are connected in two parallel paths, each containing 20 conductors. But each conductor can carry up to 10 A. Wait, but if each conductor is in parallel, then each conductor can carry current independently.

Wait, perhaps this is about the total current each path can carry. Each path has 20 conductors in parallel, so the maximum current per path would be 20 * 10 A = 200 A. But that seems too high, and probably not relevant here because we're not given a load resistance yet.

Wait, but in part (b), I'm to find the armature current delivered to the external load. So perhaps I need to compute it based on the generated voltage and the armature resistance.

Wait, but the generator's terminal voltage would be E - I_a R_a, but without knowing the load resistance or the terminal voltage, I can't compute I_a directly. Hmm, perhaps I need to compute the armature resistance first, which is part (c), and then find I_a as E / (R_sh + R_armature), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think. Each conductor has a resistance of 0.01 ohms, and there are 40 conductors. But they are connected in two parallel paths. So each path has 20 conductors in series. Wait, no, if it's two parallel paths, each path would have 20 conductors in parallel. Wait no, that can't be right because 40 conductors can't be split into two parallel paths each of 20 conductors in parallel. Or perhaps each path has 20 conductors connected in series.

Wait, wait, in a DC machine, the armature conductors are connected in a way that the number of conductors per path depends on the number of poles and the way the armature is wound. But for this problem, it's given that the armature has 40 conductors connected in two parallel paths, so each path has 20 conductors. But wait, how are these 20 conductors arranged? Are they in series or in parallel in each path?

Hmm, perhaps each path has 20 conductors connected in series. Because in a generator, each parallel path would have a certain number of conductors in series to build up the voltage. So each of the two parallel paths has 20 conductors in series.

Wait, that makes more sense. So each path has 20 conductors in series, and the two paths are in parallel. So the total armature resistance R_a is the resistance of one path divided by the number of parallel paths. Since each path has 20 conductors in series, each with 0.01 ohms, the resistance per path is 20 * 0.01 = 0.2 ohms. Since there are two parallel paths, the total armature resistance R_a is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 ohms.

Wait, that's part (c), armature resistance. So R_a is 0.1 ohms. Looking at the options, option D has armature resistance 0.1 Ω, so that matches.

Now, for part (b), the armature current delivered to the load. Hmm, but how do I find that? I think I need to know the terminal voltage, but I'm not given the load resistance. Alternatively, perhaps the current is determined by the capacity of the conductors. Each conductor can carry up to 10 A, so per path, with 20 conductors in series, each carrying 10 A, the total current per path would be 10 A (since they are in series). Wait, no: in series, the current through each conductor is the same as the path current. So if each conductor can carry up to 10 A, then each path can carry 10 A. Since there are two parallel paths, the total armature current is 2 * 10 A = 20 A.

Ah, that makes sense. So the maximum armature current is 20 A. So part (b) is 20 A.

Looking at the options, option D says armature current is 20 A. So that matches.

Now, part (d): terminal voltage. Terminal voltage V is given by V = E - I_a R_a.

We have E = 129.6 V, I_a =20 A, R_a=0.1 Ω.

So V = 129.6 - (20 * 0.1) = 129.6 - 2 = 127.6 V.

Looking at option D, the terminal voltage is 127.6 V, which matches.

So all parts point to option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given parameters and apply the appropriate formulas for a two-pole DC generator. The key steps are as follows:

### Given Data:
- **Number of poles (P):** 2  
- **Number of conductors (Z):** 40  
- **Flux per pole (φ):** \(6.48 \times 10^8\) maxwells = \(6.48 \, \text{Wb}\) (since \(1 \, \text{Wb} = 10^8 \, \text{maxwells}\))  
- **Speed (N):** 30 rpm  
- **Number of parallel paths (A):** 2  
- **Resistance per conductor (\(R_c\)):** \(0.01 \, \Omega\)  
- **Current capacity per conductor:** \(10 \, \text{A}\)  

### Part (a): Average Generated Voltage Per Path and Armature Voltage
The generated EMF (\(E\)) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
E = \frac{P \cdot \phi \cdot Z \cdot N}{60 \cdot A}
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
E = \frac{2 \cdot 6.48 \cdot 40 \cdot 30}{60 \cdot 2} = \frac{15552}{120} = 129.6 \, \text{V}
\]
Since the armature has two parallel paths, the voltage across each path is the same as the total generated armature voltage. Thus:  
- **Average generated voltage per path:** \(129.6 \, \text{V}\)  
- **Generated armature voltage:** \(129.6 \, \text{V}\)  

### Part (b): Armature Current Delivered to an External Load
Each conductor can carry a maximum current of \(10 \, \text{A}\). With 40 conductors and 2 parallel paths, each path contains 20 conductors. Since the current in each conductor is \(10 \, \text{A}\), the total current per path is:  
\[
I_{\text{path}} = 10 \, \text{A}
\]
The total armature current is the sum of the currents in the two parallel paths:  
\[
I_a = 2 \cdot 10 = 20 \, \text{A}
\]

### Part (c): Armature Resistance
Each path has 20 conductors in series, so the resistance per path is:  
\[
R_{\text{path}} = 20 \cdot 0.01 = 0.2 \, \Omega
\]
The total armature resistance for two parallel paths is:  
\[
R_a = \frac{R_{\text{path}}}{A} = \frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1 \, \Omega
\]

### Part (d): Terminal Voltage of the Generator
The terminal voltage (\(V\)) is given by:  
\[
V = E - I_a \cdot R_a
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
V = 129.6 - (20 \cdot 0.1) = 129.6 - 2 = 127.6 \, \text{V}
\]

### Final Results:
- **(a)** Average generated voltage per path: \(129.6 \, \text{V}\), Generated armature voltage: \(129.6 \, \text{V}\)  
- **(b)** Armature current: \(20 \, \text{A}\)  
- **(c)** Armature resistance: \(0.1 \, \Omega\)  
- **(d)** Terminal voltage: \(127.6 \, \text{V}\)  

From the given options, the correct choice is **D**.
