Okay, so I've got this problem here about steam condensing on a vertical pipe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on heat transfer, but let's see what I can do. Alright, let's break it down.

The problem gives me the pressure of steam as 15.3 kN/m². Wait, right, steam under pressure will condense at a certain temperature. I remember that saturation temperature depends on the pressure. I think I need to find the saturation temperature here. Oh wait, but I don't have the exact value for 15.3 kPa. Wait, no, wait, 15.3 kN/m² is the same as 15.3 kPa, because 1 kN/m² equals 1 kPa. Right, because 1 kN is 1000 N, and 1 m² is (1m)^2, so N/m² is Pa. So 15.3 kN/m² is 15300 Pa, which is 15.3 kPa.

Wait, or wait, no. Wait, 1 kPa is 1000 Pa, so 15.3 kPa is 15300 Pa. But I think the standard atmospheric pressure is 101.325 kPa, so 15.3 is way lower. So the saturation temperature for steam at 15.3 kPa must be lower than 100°C. I think I remember that at around 10 kPa, water boils around 45°C or so. Maybe I should look up the saturation temperature. Oh but since I can't look it up, I'll have to approximate. Alternatively, maybe the problem provides the temperature drop, so perhaps the saturation temp is Tw plus the temp drop.

Wait, the problem says the temperature drop across the film is 5°C. So if the steam is condensing, the wall must be at a lower temperature than the steam. So the steam's saturation temperature is higher than the wall by 5 degrees. So Tsat = Tw + 5°C. But wait, I don't know Tw here. Hmm, maybe I can find the heat transfer coefficient without knowing the exact temperatures. Let's see.

The problem asks for two things: a) the coefficient of heat transfer, and b) the required length of the pipe. The options give different values for each, so I need to calculate both.

I think the process is film condensation. For vertical surfaces, the heat transfer coefficient can be found using a correlation. I remember that for film condensation on a vertical plate, the average heat transfer coefficient is given by:

h = (4 * k * L) / (D * (Re)^0.5 * (Pr)^0.5 * (Ja)^0.5)) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the Nusselt number approach. Oh right, the Nusselt number for vertical surfaces in film condensation is given by:

Nu = (4 * Re^0.5 * Pr^0.5 * Ja^0.5) ) / (1 + 3*Pr^(1/3) + ...) )

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to recall. I think the Nusselt number for a vertical plate is:

Nu = (4/3) * ( (Ga * Pr) / (1 + 3Pr^(1/3) + ...) ) )^(1/4)

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with other correlations. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is better. I remember that for film condensation on a vertical surface, the heat transfer coefficient h can be calculated using the following formula:

h = (k * (rho * g * (Ts - Tw) * D^2 )^0.25) ) / (v * ( (mu^2 / (rho * g)) * (1/(rho^2 g D)) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the correlation for the average Nusselt number for a vertical plate. The formula I think is:

h = ( (4 * k * (rho^2 * g * (Ts - Tw) * L) ) / (D * mu * (rho * mu / (k (Ts - Tw)))^(1/3) * (mu / rho)^2 ) ) )^(1/4) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, I've read that for vertical surfaces, the Nusselt number is given by:

Nu = ( (4 * Ga * Pr ) / ( (1 + 3 Pr^{1/3})^2 ) ) )^{1/4}

Where Ga is the Galileo number, which is Gr/(Re^2). Wait, maybe it's better to look for the correct correlation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

h = 0.943 * ( (k^3 * rho^2 * g * (Ts - Tw) ) / (D * mu^2 * (Pr) ) )^(1/4)

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. I think the correct formula for the average heat transfer coefficient in film condensation on a vertical plate is:

h = ( ( (k^3 * rho^2 * g * ΔT ) ) / ( D * mu^2 * (Pr) ) )^(1/4 ) ) * ( 1 + 0.3 * ( ( (rho_l - rho_v) rho_l g D ) / mu_l^2 ) ) )^-0.25 )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I think I should stick to the standard Nusselt number formula for vertical surfaces. The Nusselt number is given by:

Nu = (4/3) ( ( Ga * Pr ) / ( 1 + 3 Pr^{1/3} )^2 ) )^(1/4)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following approach:

The heat transfer coefficient for film condensation on a vertical plate can be determined using the correlation:

h = [ (k^3 * rho^2 * g * ΔT) / (D * mu^2 * Pr ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, that seems plausible. So, h is the heat transfer coefficient, k is thermal conductivity of the liquid (water), rho is the density of the liquid, g is gravity, ΔT is the temperature difference (Ts - Tw), D is the diameter, mu is dynamic viscosity of the liquid, and Pr is the Prandtl number.

Wait, but I think I might have the formula wrong. Another possibility is that the formula includes the latent heat, but in this case, maybe it's accounted for elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass flow rate is given, which relates to the condensation rate.

Wait, the problem states that steam condenses at a rate of 25 kg/hr. So m_dot = 25 kg/hr. Let's convert that into kg/s: 25/3600 ≈ 0.006944 kg/s.

The pipe is vertical, outer diameter is 56 mm, so D = 0.056 m.

The temperature drop across the film is 5°C. So ΔT = 5°C.

So, perhaps I can calculate h using the formula I mentioned, but I need the properties of water at the saturation temperature. Wait, but I don't know Ts yet. Because the problem doesn't give the wall temperature, but I can express h in terms of the given data.

Wait, let me think again. The rate of condensation (m_dot) is related to the heat transfer. The heat flux q is given by q = h * A * ΔT. But the heat required for condensation is also q = m_dot * h_fg, where h_fg is the latent heat of vaporization. So equating the two:

h * A * ΔT = m_dot * h_fg

So h = (m_dot * h_fg) / (A * ΔT )

Hmm, but I don't know h_fg because I don't know the saturation temperature, which depends on the pressure. So I need to find h_fg at 15.3 kPa.

Wait, but I can't look up tables, so perhaps I can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives enough data to calculate without knowing the exact h_fg, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the options will allow me to calculate h without knowing h_fg, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think: For film condensation on a vertical surface, the heat transfer coefficient can be found from the Nusselt analysis. The formula is:

h = ( (k^3 * rho^2 * g * ΔT ) / ( D * mu^2 * Pr ) )^(1/4)

So I need the properties of the liquid (water) at the saturation temperature Ts. Ts is the saturation temperature at 15.3 kPa. Let me try to estimate that.

I know that at 10 kPa, the saturation temperature is about 45°C. Wait, no, that's too low. Wait, no, wait, at 1 atm (101.3 kPa), it's 100°C. At lower pressures, the saturation temp is lower. So at 15.3 kPa, Ts is higher than at 10 kPa. Let me think: perhaps around 50°C? Wait, I think at 15 kPa, Ts is about 51°C. Let me go with Ts ≈ 50°C for estimation.

At Ts = 50°C, the properties of water (liquid) are approximately:

k ≈ 0.644 W/m-K

rho ≈ 990 kg/m³

mu ≈ 5.4e-4 Pa·s

Pr ≈ 3.8

But wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me see, at 50°C, the properties of water are:

k = 0.6407 W/m·K

rho = 988 kg/m³

mu = 5.47e-4 kg/m·s

Pr = 3.55

Ok, so:

k = 0.641 W/m-K

rho = 988 kg/m³

mu = 0.000547 kg/m-s

Pr = 3.55

Now, ΔT is 5°C, D is 0.056 m.

Plugging these into the formula:

h = [ (k^3 * rho^2 * g * ΔT) / (D * mu^2 * Pr) ) ]^(1/4)

Let me calculate each part step by step.

Compute numerator inside the brackets: k^3 * rho^2 * g * ΔT

k^3 = (0.641)^3 ≈ 0.641 * 0.641 = 0.411, then * 0.641 → ~0.264 W³/m³·K³

rho^2 = (988)^2 ≈ 976,144 kg²/m^6

g = 9.81 m/s²

ΔT = 5°C = 5 K

So numerator: 0.264 * 976144 * 9.81 *5

Let me compute that:

0.264 * 976144 ≈ 0.264 * 976,000 ≈ 258, 000? Wait, let's compute accurately:

0.264 * 976,144 = ?

Well, 976,144 * 0.2 = 195,228.8

976,144 * 0.06 = 58,568.64

976,144 * 0.004 = 3,904.576

Adding those: 195,228.8 +58,568.64 = 253,797.44 +3,904.576 = 257,702.016

Then multiply by 9.81: 257,702.016 *9.81 ≈ 2,527, 000? Let me compute:

257,702 * 10 = 2,577,020, subtract 257,702 * 0.19 = approx 257,702 * 0.2 = 51,540.4 → but 0.19 is 0.2 - 0.01. So 51,540.4 - 2,577.02 → 48,963.38. So 2,577,020 - 48,963.38 ≈ 2,528,056.62.

Then multiply by 5: 2,528,056.62 *5 ≈12,640,283.1

Now the denominator: D * mu^2 * Pr

D = 0.056 m

mu = 0.000547 kg/m-s → mu^2 = (0.000547)^2 ≈ 2.985e-7 kg²/m²-s²

Pr = 3.55

So denominator: 0.056 * 2.985e-7 *3.55

Compute 0.056 * 2.985e-7 → 0.056 * 2.985e-7 ≈ 1.673e-8

Then multiply by 3.55 → 1.673e-8 *3.55 ≈ 5.944e-8

So the overall fraction is numerator / denominator = 12,640,283.1 / 5.944e-8 ≈ ?

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute:

12,640,283.1 / 5.944e-8 = 12,640,283.1 / 0.00000005944 ≈ 212,800,000.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

5.944e-8 is 0.00000005944.

So 12,640,283.1 divided by 0.00000005944.

Which is approximately 12,640,283.1 / 5.944e-8 ≈ 212,700,000.

So the bracketed term is approximately 2.127e8.

Now take the fourth root of that: h = (2.127e8)^(1/4)

What's the fourth root of 2.127e8?

Well, 1e8 is (1e2)^4 = 100^4 → 1e8^(1/4) is 100.

But 2.127e8 is 212,700,000, which is 2.127 * 1e8.

The fourth root of 2.127 is approximately 1.24, since 1.2^4=2.0736, which is close to 2.127.

So 1.24 * 1e2 → 124 W/m²·K.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the thousands. Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, I think I forgot that in the formula, the numerator is (k^3 * rho^2 * g * ΔT), and the denominator is (D * mu^2 * Pr). But I might have miscalculated the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula. Let me check the correct formula for vertical surface film condensation.

Ah, yes, the correct formula for the average heat transfer coefficient in film condensation on a vertical plate is:

h = [ (k^3 * rho^2 * g * (Ts - Tw) ) / (D * mu^2 * Pr) ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, that's the same as I used. So perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Let me recalculate the numerator and denominator more carefully.

Compute numerator: k^3 = 0.641^3 = 0.641 * 0.641 = 0.411, then * 0.641 → 0.411 * 0.641 ≈ 0.263 W³/m³·K³.

rho^2 = (988)^2 = 976,144 kg²/m^6.

g = 9.81 m/s².

ΔT = 5 K.

So numerator: 0.263 * 976,144 *9.81 *5.

Compute step by step:

0.263 * 976,144 = ?

Calculate 976,144 * 0.2 = 195,228.8

976,144 * 0.06 = 58,568.64

976,144 * 0.003 = 2,928.432

Adding them together: 195,228.8 +58,568.64 = 253,797.44 +2,928.432 = 256,725.872.

Then multiply by 9.81: 256,725.872 *9.81 ≈ ?

Let me compute 256,725.872 *10 = 2,567,258.72

Subtract 256,725.872 *0.19 = 48,777.716 (since 0.19 is 10% less than 0.2)

So 2,567,258.72 - 48,777.716 = 2,518,481.004.

Then multiply by 5: 2,518,481.004 *5 =12,592,405.02.

Denominator: D * mu^2 * Pr.

D =0.056 m

mu =0.000547 kg/m-s → mu^2 = (0.000547)^2 = 2.984e-7 kg²/m²-s².

Pr =3.55.

So denominator: 0.056 * 2.984e-7 *3.55.

Compute 0.056 *2.984e-7 = 1.670e-8

Then multiply by 3.55: 1.670e-8 *3.55 ≈ 5.934e-8.

So now, the fraction is numerator/denominator:12,592,405.02 /5.934e-8.

Compute that: 12,592,405.02 / 0.00000005934 ≈ ?

Let me compute 12,592,405.02 / 5.934e-8.

That's approximately 12,592,405.02 / 5.934e-8 = 212,200,000.

So the bracketed term is ~2.122e8.

Now taking the fourth root: h = (2.122e8)^(1/4).

Let me compute this.

First, 1e8^(1/4) is 100, as 100^4 = 1e8.

So 2.122e8 = 212.2 * 1e6 → wait, no, 2.122e8 is 212,200,000.

Wait, but 2.122e8 is 2.122 * 1e8, so its fourth root would be (2.122)^(1/4) * (1e8)^(1/4).

(1e8)^(1/4) is 100.

(2.122)^(1/4) is approximately 1.23, since 1.2^4=2.0736, and 1.22^4= (1.22)^2=1.4884, then squared again: ~2.22.
