Okay, so I've got this differential equations problem here about a tank with saltwater flowing in and out. Hmm, I remember that these are mixing problems, probably involving a differential equation to model the concentration over time. Let me try to break it down.

The tank initially has 100 gallons of water and 50 ounces of salt. So, the initial concentration is 50 oz per 100 gal, which is 0.5 oz/gal. But wait, the inflow has a varying concentration. The inflow concentration is given as (1/4)(1 + (1/2) sin t) oz/gal. Oh, right, that's a function of time, so it oscillates. The flow rate is 2 gal/min for both inflow and outflow, so the volume in the tank stays constant at 100 gallons. That simplifies things because the volume isn't changing, so I don't have to worry about that term in the differential equation.

I think the general form for the change in salt is the inflow rate minus the outflow rate. The inflow brings in salt at a rate of (concentration) times (flow rate). The outflow carries salt out at the same flow rate but with the tank's current concentration.

Let me write the differential equation. Let S(t) be the amount of salt in the tank at time t. Then, the rate of change dS/dt should be equal to the inflow of salt minus the outflow. 

Inflow: concentration is (1/4)(1 + (1/2) sin t) oz/gal, times 2 gal/min. So that's (2) * (1/4)(1 + (0.5) sin t) = (1/2)(1 + 0.5 sin t) oz per minute.

Outflow: the concentration in the tank is S(t)/100 oz/gal, because volume is 100 gal. So outflow rate is 2 gal/min * (S(t)/100) oz/gal = (2 S(t))/100 = S(t)/50 oz per minute.

Putting it together, the differential equation is:

dS/dt = (1/2)(1 + 0.5 sin t) - (S(t)/50)

Hmm, let me write that more neatly. Let's maybe multiply through by 50 to eliminate the denominator.

50 dS/dt = 25 (1 + 0.5 sin t) - S(t)

Wait, alternatively, I can write it as:

dS/dt + (1/50) S = (1/2)(1 + 0.5 sin t)

Yes, that's a linear first-order differential equation. The standard form is dy/dt + P(t) y = Q(t). So here, P(t) is 1/50, and Q(t) is (1/2)(1 + 0.5 sin t).

To solve this, I need an integrating factor. The integrating factor mu(t) is exp(∫P(t) dt). Since P is constant (1/50), the integral is (1/50) t. So mu(t) = e^(t/50).

Multiply both sides of the DE by e^(t/50):

e^(t/50) dS/dt + (1/50) e^(t/50) S = (1/2)(1 + 0.5 sin t) e^(t/50)

The left side is the derivative of [S(t) e^(t/50)] with respect to t. So integrate both sides:

∫ d/dt [S e^(t/50)] dt = ∫ (1/2)(1 + 0.5 sin t) e^(t/50) dt

So S(t) e^(t/50) = ∫ (1/2)(1 + 0.5 sin t) e^(t/50) dt + C

To compute the integral on the right, I can split it into two parts: ∫ (1/2) e^(t/50) dt + ∫ (1/4) sin t e^(t/50) dt.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ (1/2) e^(t/50) dt.

Let u = t/50 → du = dt/50 → dt = 50 du.

So ∫ (1/2) e^u * 50 du = (1/2)(50) ∫ e^u du = 25 e^u + C = 25 e^(t/50) + C.

Second integral: ∫ (1/4) sin t e^(t/50) dt.

This one is trickier because it's the product of sin t and an exponential. I think I need to use integration by parts twice and solve for the integral.

Let me set:

Let’s denote I = ∫ e^(t/50) sin t dt.

Using integration by parts: Let u = sin t → du = cos t dt.
dv = e^(t/50) dt → v = 50 e^(t/50).

So I = uv - ∫ v du = sin t * 50 e^(t/50) - ∫ 50 e^(t/50) cos t dt.

Now compute the integral on the right. Let me call this I2 = ∫ e^(t/50) cos t dt.

Again, integration by parts. Let u = cos t → du = -sin t dt.
dv = e^(t/50) dt → v = 50 e^(t/50).

So I2 = cos t *50 e^(t/50) - ∫ (-sin t) *50 e^(t/50) dt = 50 cos t e^(t/50) + 50 ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt.

Wait, notice that the integral in I2 is ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt, which is exactly I. So putting it together:

I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) - [50 cos t e^(t/50) + 50 I]

Wait, let me re-express that:

I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) - 50 [cos t e^(t/50) + I ]

Wait, no, because I2 = 50 cos t e^(t/50) + 50 I.

So going back to I:

I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) - 50 I2.

But I2 is 50 cos t e^(t/50) + 50 I.

So substitute I2:

I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) - 50 [50 cos t e^(t/50) + 50 I ]

Wait no, wait. Let me re-express:

Wait no, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go step by step.

I = ∫ e^(t/50) sin t dt.

First integration by parts:

u = sin t → du = cos t dt
dv = e^(t/50) dt → v = 50 e^(t/50)

So I = uv - ∫ v du = 50 sin t e^(t/50) - ∫ 50 e^(t/50) cos t dt.

The remaining integral is ∫50 e^(t/50) cos t dt. Let's call this integral I2.

Compute I2:

I2 = ∫50 e^(t/50) cos t dt.

Integration by parts again:

u = cos t → du = -sin t dt
dv =50 e^(t/50) dt → v = 50 * (50 e^(t/50)) )= 2500 e^(t/50)? Wait wait, no.

Wait, dv =50 e^(t/50) dt → v = 50 * ∫ e^(t/50) dt = 50 * (50 e^(t/50)) )= 2500 e^(t/50).

Wait no: ∫ e^(t/50) dt is 50 e^(t/50), so 50 times that is 50 *50 e^(t/50)=2500 e^(t/50). So v=2500 e^(t/50).

So I2 = u v - ∫ v du = cos t * 2500 e^(t/50) - ∫ (-sin t) * 2500 e^(t/50) dt.

Simplify:

I2 = 2500 cos t e^(t/50) + 2500 ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt.

But wait, ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt is our original I.

So I2 = 2500 cos t e^(t/50) + 2500 I.

Now, go back to the expression for I:

I =50 sin t e^(t/50) - I2.

Substituting I2:

I =50 sin t e^(t/50) - [2500 cos t e^(t/50) +2500 I ].

So I =50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50) -2500 I.

Bring the 2500 I to the left side:

I +2500 I =50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50).

So 2501 I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50).

Thus, I = [50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50)] / 2501.

Wait, but I think I messed up some coefficients. Let me check again.

Wait, I think when I did I2, the setup was with v being 50 * (integral of e^(t/50) dt), which is 50 *50 e^(t/50) =2500 e^(t/50). So that's correct.

But let me recompute I:

I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) - [2500 cos t e^(t/50) +2500 I ]

So I =50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50) -2500 I.

Bring 2500 I to left: I +2500 I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50).

So 2501 I = 50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50).

Thus, I = [50 sin t -2500 cos t ] e^(t/50) / 2501.

Wait, perhaps factor out 50. Let me see:

I = [50 (sin t - 50 cos t) ] e^(t/50) /2501.

Wait, because 2500 is 50^2, so 2500 =50*50.

Wait, 50 sin t -2500 cos t =50 (sin t -50 cos t).

So I = [50 (sin t -50 cos t) e^(t/50)] / (2501).

Wait, but 2501 is 50^2 +1? 50^2 is 2500, so 2501=50^2+1.

So, I is [50 (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50} ] / (50^2 +1).

But let me double-check this because it's getting a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have kept track of the coefficients more carefully.

Wait, perhaps when computing I2, I made an error in the integral.

Wait, I2 was ∫50 e^(t/50) cos t dt.

So when I did integration by parts, u = cos t, dv =50 e^(t/50) dt.

So du = -sin t dt, v=50 *50 e^(t/50) =2500 e^(t/50).

So I2 = u v - ∫ v du = 2500 cos t e^(t/50) - ∫ 2500 e^(t/50) (-sin t) dt.

Which is I2=2500 cos t e^(t/50) +2500 ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt.

But ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt is I. So I2=2500 cos t e^(t/50) +2500 I.

So putting back into I's equation:

I=50 sin t e^(t/50) - I2 =50 sin t e^(t/50) - [2500 cos t e^(t/50) +2500 I ]

So I=50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^(t/50) -2500 I.

Bring 2500 I to the left:

I +2500 I =50 sin t e^(t/50) -2500 cos t e^{t/50}.

So 2501 I = [50 sin t -2500 cos t] e^{t/50}.

Thus, I= [50 sin t -2500 cos t] e^{t/50} /2501.

Wait, but 2501 is 50^2 +1^2? Wait 50^2 is 2500. So 2501=50^2+1.

So, yes, 2501=50²+1.

So I = [50 sin t -2500 cos t] e^{t/50} / (50² +1).

But wait, I think I can factor out 50 from numerator:

Wait, 50 sin t -2500 cos t =50 (sin t -50 cos t).

So I= [50 (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50} ] / (50² +1).

Now, going back to the original integral in the DE solution.

The integral in the DE solution is:

∫ (1/2)(1 +0.5 sin t) e^{t/50} dt = (1/2) ∫ e^{t/50} dt + (1/4) ∫ sin t e^{t/50} dt.

Which we computed as:

(1/2)(25 e^{t/50}) ) + (1/4)(I).

Wait, no: the first integral was (1/2) ∫ e^(t/50) dt = (1/2)(50 e^{t/50}) )=25 e^{t/50}.

And the second integral (1/4) ∫ sin t e^{t/50} dt is (1/4) I.

So putting it all together, the integral is:

25 e^{t/50} + (1/4) * [50 (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50} ] / (50² +1).

Wait, let me compute that:

(1/4) * [50 (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50} ] / 2501 = [50/(4*2501)] (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50}.

Simplify 50/(4*2501): 50/(10004)= 25/(5002) ≈ but perhaps we can leave it as is.

So the integral becomes:

25 e^{t/50} + [50/(4*2501)] (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50}.

Now, putting everything together, the solution S(t) is:

S(t) = e^{-t/50} [ integral result + C ].

So,

S(t) = e^{-t/50} [25 e^{t/50} + [50/(4*2501)] (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50} + C ]

Simplify:

= e^{-t/50} * [25 e^{t/50} ] + e^{-t/50} * [50/(4*2501) (sin t -50 cos t) e^{t/50} ] + e^{-t/50} C.

The first term: e^{-t/50} *25 e^{t/50} =25.

The second term: [50/(4*2501)] (sin t -50 cos t).

The last term is C e^{-t/50}.

So,

S(t) =25 + [50/(4*2501)] (sin t -50 cos t) + C e^{-t/50}.

Now, as t approaches infinity, the term C e^{-t/50} approaches zero, so the long-time behavior is S(t) approaches 25 + [50/(4*2501)] (sin t -50 cos t).

Wait, but the problem says the oscillation is about a certain constant level. That suggests that the steady-state solution is a constant plus an oscillating term. The constant would be 25 oz, and the oscillating part would have a certain amplitude.

But let's compute the amplitude of the oscillating term. The oscillating part is [50/(4*2501)] (sin t -50 cos t).

We can write this as A sin t + B cos t, but to find the amplitude, we can combine them into a single sine function with amplitude sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

Let me compute A and B.

The coefficient of sin t is [50/(4*2501)] *1 =50/(10004).

The coefficient of cos t is [50/(4*2501)]*(-50) = (-2500)/(10004).

So, A=50/10004, B= -2500/10004.

The amplitude is sqrt(A^2 + B^2) = sqrt( (50^2 + 2500^2) ) /10004.

Compute numerator: 50^2=2500; 2500^2=6,250,000. So 2500 +6,250,000=6,252,500.

So sqrt(6,252,500) = 2500.5 approximately? Wait, wait. Let me check:

Wait, 2500^2 is 6,250,000. 2501^2 is (2500+1)^2=2500² +2*2500*1 +1=6,250,000 +5000 +1=6,255,001.

But our numerator inside sqrt is 6,252,500, which is less than 6,255,001.

Wait, wait, 2500.5^2 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out 2500^2.

Wait, 50^2 + (2500)^2 = (50)^2 [1 + (50)^2 ].

Because 50^2=2500, and (2500)^2 = (50^2)^2=50^4.

So, 50^2 +2500^2=50^2 (1 +50^2 )=50^2 (1+2500)=50^2 *2501.

So sqrt(50^2 *2501) )=50 *sqrt(2501).

Wait, because
