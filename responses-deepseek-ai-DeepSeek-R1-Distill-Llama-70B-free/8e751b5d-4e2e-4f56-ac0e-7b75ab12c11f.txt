Okay, so I have this limit problem to solve. The sequence is a_n equals n divided by the square root of (n squared plus one). I'm supposed to find the limit as n approaches infinity. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with limits at infinity, especially involving polynomials, there are certain strategies I can use.

Wait, the sequence is a_n = n / sqrt(n² + 1). Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can simplify the expression somehow. Oh right, sometimes dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of n helps. The highest power here is n, since sqrt(n²) is n.

So if I divide both numerator and denominator by n, that might make things clearer. Let's try that. The numerator becomes n/n, which is 1. The denominator becomes sqrt(n² + 1)/n. 

Wait, the denominator can be rewritten. The denominator inside the square root is n²(1 + 1/n²). So sqrt(n²(1 + 1/n²)) is n*sqrt(1 + 1/n²). So now the denominator is [n * sqrt(1 + 1/n²)] / n, right? Because we divided everything by n.

Oh wait, no. Let me rephrase. The original denominator is sqrt(n² +1). Let me factor out n² from inside the square root. So sqrt(n²(1 + 1/n²)) equals n * sqrt(1 + 1/n²), because sqrt(n²) is n and sqrt(1 + ...) is just sqrt(1 + something small as n grows).

So now the denominator is n * sqrt(1 + 1/n²). So when I divide the denominator by n (since we're dividing numerator and denominator by n), it becomes [n * sqrt(...)] / n, which simplifies to sqrt(1 + 1/n²).

Putting it all together, a_n becomes [n / n] divided by [sqrt(1 + 1/n²)]. So that's 1 over sqrt(1 + 1/n²).

Now, as n approaches infinity, the term 1/n² approaches zero. So 1 + 0 is 1, and the square root of 1 is 1. So the denominator approaches 1, and the whole expression approaches 1/1, which is 1.

Wait, but I remember sometimes when n is in the denominator, you can also consider the leading terms. Like, for large n, n² +1 is approximately n², so sqrt(n²+1) is approximately n. So n / n would be 1. But wait, that seems too simplistic. Oh, but more accurately, sqrt(n² +1) is n * sqrt(1 + 1/n²), which for large n is approximately n*(1 + 1/(2n²)) by the binomial approximation. So sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 when x is small.

So sqrt(n² +1) ≈ n + 1/(2n). Then, the denominator is approximately n + 1/(2n). So a_n becomes n divided by (n + 1/(2n)) ). Let's rewrite that as n/(n + 1/(2n)) = [n] / [n (1 + 1/(2n²)))] = 1/(1 + 1/(2n²)).

As n approaches infinity, 1/(2n²) approaches 0, so this becomes 1/(1+0) = 1. So the limit is 1.

Wait, but another way I can think about this is by dividing numerator and denominator by n. So a_n = [n/n] / [sqrt(n² +1)/n]. Which is 1 / [sqrt(1 + 1/n²)]. Again, as n approaches infinity, 1/n² approaches 0, so sqrt(1 + 0) is 1. So limit is 1/1 = 1.

Alternatively, I could use L’Hospital's Rule if I rewrite the expression. Let me see: as n approaches infinity, both numerator and denominator approach infinity, so it's an indeterminate form of ∞/∞. So applying L’Hospital's Rule, take derivatives of numerator and denominator with respect to n.

The derivative of the numerator (n) is 1. The derivative of the denominator sqrt(n² +1) is (1/(2*sqrt(n² +1)))*2n = n / sqrt(n² +1). So the new expression after applying L’Hospital once is [1] / [n / sqrt(n² +1)].

Wait, let me compute that. The denominator after derivative is n / sqrt(n² +1). So the expression becomes 1 / [n / sqrt(n² +1)] = sqrt(n² +1)/n. Which is the same as the original a_n. So I end up with the same expression again. Hmm, that's a loop. So applying L’Hospital's Rule here doesn't help because it leads me back to the same limit. So maybe that approach isn't the best way here.

So going back to my earlier methods, the limit is 1.

Looking at the options, G is 1. So the answer should be G.

The sequence is given by \( a_n = \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2 + 1}} \), and we need to find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity. To simplify the expression, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \( n \):

\[
a_n = \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2 + 1}} = \frac{\frac{n}{n}}{\frac{\sqrt{n^2 + 1}}{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n^2}}}.
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{n^2} \) approaches 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 0}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

This result can also be confirmed by approximating \( \sqrt{n^2 + 1} \) for large \( n \). Using the binomial expansion, \( \sqrt{n^2 + 1} \approx n + \frac{1}{2n} \), so:

\[
a_n = \frac{n}{n + \frac{1}{2n}} = \frac{n}{n \left(1 + \frac{1}{2n^2}\right)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2n^2}}.
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), \( \frac{1}{2n^2} \to 0 \), and the limit again becomes:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1.
\]

Thus, the limit of the sequence is \( 1 \), which corresponds to option **G**.
