Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the BRIC countries and their approach to corporate governance. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

First, the question is about the BRIC countries. BRIC stands for Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Wait, so the first blank is asking for the fourth country in BRIC. The options probably include China as one of the choices. Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options, option I says China, which makes sense because BRIC is Brazil, Russia, India, China. So the first blank should be China.

Next part of the question: the BRIC countries tend to follow a certain approach to corporate governance. I remember that corporate governance can be categorized into two main approaches: market-based and relationship-based (or sometimes called bank-based). I think in the past, some countries have relied more on relationships, perhaps through close ties between banks and companies, rather than relying on the open market.

I recall that countries like Germany and Japan have historically used a more relationship-based or stakeholder-oriented approach, where banks and other stakeholders have significant influence over companies. On the other hand, countries like the US and the UK are known for a market-based approach, where the stock market and shareholders play a bigger role.

So the BRIC countries, which include emerging economies, probably started with a relationship-based approach. That would mean the second blank is filled with 'Relationship'.

Now, the last part of the question says that recently, they've moved towards more _______-based mechanisms. So if they were relationship-based before, now they're moving towards the opposite, which would be market-based. So the third blank should be 'Market'.

Putting it all together, the first blank is China, the second is Relationship, and the third is Market. Looking at the options, option I is: China, Relationship, Market. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check the options. Option I is indeed China, Relationship, Market. So I think I'm confident with that.

The BRIC countries are Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Historically, these countries have followed a relationship-based approach to corporate governance, which emphasizes close ties between companies and stakeholders such as banks. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards market-based mechanisms, which rely more on the stock market and shareholders. 

The correct answer is **I: China, Relationship, Market**.
