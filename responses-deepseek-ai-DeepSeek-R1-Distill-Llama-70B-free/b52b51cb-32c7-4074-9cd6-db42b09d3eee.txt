Question:

High levels of progesterone are essential for the maintenance of the uterine lining during pregnancy. But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained?

Options:

A: The endometrium produces a hormone that supports the corpus luteum throughout pregnancy.
B: The body naturally adjusts progesterone levels during pregnancy.
C: The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete high levels of progesterone without being shut off.
D: The corpus luteum spontaneously increases in size during pregnancy, which maintains progesterone levels without hormonal regulation.
E: The corpus luteum is replaced by a secondary organ that secretes progesterone during pregnancy.
F: The corpus luteum is not necessary during pregnancy.
G: The embryo produces progesterone independently, eliminating the need for the corpus luteum after conception.
H: The corpus luteum's lifespan is extended due to increased blood flow to the ovaries during pregnancy.
I: The mother's pituitary gland secretes additional LH during pregnancy to maintain the corpus luteum.
J: The embryo secretes a hormone to preserve the corpus luteum.

Okay, so I've got this question about progesterone and the corpus luteum during pregnancy. I'm a bit rusty on my endocrinology, but let me think this through.

The question says that high progesterone levels are crucial for maintaining the uterine lining during pregnancy. But normally, high progesterone has negative feedback on LH secretion, which decreases LH. Without LH, the corpus luteum atrophies, leading to lower progesterone and menstruation. But after conception, this doesn't happen because the embryo needs the uterine lining. So the corpus luteum must continue to function. How does that happen?

I remember that the corpus luteum is responsible for producing progesterone after ovulation. If the egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone until the placenta takes over later in pregnancy. But wait, in the question, the focus is on what maintains the corpus luteum itself beyond its usual lifespan.

So normally, LH from the pituitary keeps the corpus luteum active. But the negative feedback from high progesterone would reduce LH, which should kill the corpus luteum. So something must be maintaining it despite that.

I think hCG is involved here. Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone produced by the embryo after implantation. It's similar in structure to LH, so I think it can mimic LH's action. So hCG would stimulate the corpus luteum to keep producing progesterone even when LH is low. That way, the corpus luteum doesn't atrophy, and progesterone levels stay high to support the pregnancy until the placenta takes over.

Looking at the options, option C says the placenta secretes chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) which replaces LH. Wait, I thought the embryo or the developing placenta produces hCG. Option J says the embryo secretes a hormone to preserve the corpus luteum. So that would make sense because the embryo starts producing hCG after implantation.

Wait, but option C says the placenta does it. I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall: hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast of the embryo, which becomes part of the placenta. So after implantation, the placenta does produce hCG. So both C and J could be possible, but let me look at the options.

Option C: Placenta secretes chorionic gonadotrophin, replacing LH. So that would mean the placenta's hCG takes over the role of LH, maintaining the corpus luteum.

Option J: The embryo secretes a hormone. But the embryo is the early stage, and the placenta is more involved in secretion later. But I think hCG is produced by the trophoblastic cells, which are part of the embryo initially, but as development progresses, it's the placenta.

Wait, but the initial maintenance of the corpus luteum after conception is done by hCG from the embryo before the placenta is fully established. So maybe J is correct, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the question states that the corpus luteum lasts through most of pregnancy, which implies that the hormone is provided for an extended period, which would align with the placenta's role. So option C seems more accurate because the placenta continues to produce hCG as the pregnancy progresses.

Wait, no, I think hCG is mainly important in the early stages. The corpus luteum is maintained until around the end of the first trimester when the placenta takes over progesterone production. So hCG, produced by the embryo initially, rescues the corpus luteum.

So the correct answer would be either C or J. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The placenta secretes chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete high progesterone without being shut off.

Option J: The embryo secretes a hormone to preserve the corpus luteum.

Wait, the embryo does produce hCG, right? So the embryo makes hCG, which acts as an LH-like hormone. So J would be correct. But wait, option C says the placenta does it. I'm getting a bit stuck.

I think the correct understanding is that hCG is produced by the embryo's trophoblast cells, which later become part of the placenta. So in early pregnancy, it's the embryo that produces hCG to maintain the corpus luteum. So option J would be correct.

But I'm a bit confused because I've read that the placenta produces hCG. Alternatively, maybe both the embryo and placenta produce it at different stages. So perhaps the correct answer is C because it's the placenta that continues to produce it as the pregnancy goes on.

Wait, the question says that the corpus luteum lasts through most of pregnancy. So the initial support might come from the embryo, but as the placenta develops, it takes over. But the question is about what explains the persistence of the corpus luteum.

Hmm. Alternatively, I remember that in some animals, like horses, the corpus luteum persists, but in humans, the placenta eventually takes over. So perhaps the initial maintenance is due to hCG from the embryo, but maybe the question is considering the entire duration.

Wait, the question says that after conception, the corpus luteum lasts through most of pregnancy. So perhaps the placenta is responsible for maintaining it beyond the initial stages. So option C would explain that the placenta's hCG replaces LH, keeping the corpus luteum active.

Alternatively, I think that the main role of hCG is to maintain the corpus luteum during early pregnancy until the placenta can produce enough progesterone on its own. So the corpus luteum doesn't atrophy in early pregnancy because of hCG. So the correct answer would be C, because it's the placenta producing hCG, which acts like LH.

Wait, but the embryo produces hCG first. The placenta comes later. So perhaps the correct option is J. Because the embryo produces the hormone that preserves the corpus luteum.

Alternatively, the options might not be entirely precise. Let me think of the options again.

Option C says the placenta secretes chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH. So that's correct because hCG does mimic LH, supporting the corpus luteum.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but option J says the embryo secretes a hormone. So the embryo does produce hCG, which then acts on the corpus luteum. However, the placenta also produces hCG as the pregnancy progresses.

I think the correct answer is C, but I'm a bit torn. Because in the initial phase, it's the embryo's hCG, but maybe the question considers the placenta as the source. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is J because the embryo produces the hormone. But I'm more confident that the correct answer is C because the placenta is the source of hCG during most of the pregnancy.

The question revolves around understanding how the corpus luteum is maintained during pregnancy, despite the negative feedback effects of high progesterone levels on LH secretion. Normally, LH supports the corpus luteum, but high progesterone reduces LH, leading to corpus luteum atrophy and menstruation. However, after conception, the corpus luteum persists to maintain progesterone levels, which are essential for the uterine lining and embryonic development.

The key to this persistence lies in the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is structurally similar to LH and can mimic its function. hCG is produced initially by the embryo's trophoblast cells and later by the placenta. This hormone prevents the atrophy of the corpus luteum by maintaining progesterone production until the placenta itself takes over progesterone secretion later in pregnancy.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: States that the placenta secretes chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which replaces LH to preserve the corpus luteum. This is accurate because the placenta does produce hCG as pregnancy progresses, ensuring the corpus luteum continues to function.
- **Option J**: Suggests that the embryo secretes a hormone to preserve the corpus luteum. While it is true that the embryo produces hCG initially, the question emphasizes the corpus luteum lasting "through most of pregnancy," which aligns more with the placenta's role in producing hCG.

Given that the corpus luteum persists through most of pregnancy, the placenta's production of hCG is the more comprehensive explanation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C**
