Okay, so I've got this question about fast-twitch fibres and what they contain. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my muscle fibre types, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that there are different types of muscle fibres, like slow-twitch and fast-twitch. Oh right, slow-twitch are called Type I and fast-twitch are Type II. Right, and each has different characteristics based on their metabolism and function.

So slow-twitch fibres are more endurance-based, right? They rely on aerobic respiration because they have a lot of mitochondria. That means they use oxygen to generate ATP slowly but can sustain activity over time. They're the marathon runners of the muscle world.

Fast-twitch, on the other hand, are for short bursts of speed and strength. I think they rely more on anaerobic respiration because they can't sustain activity as long. Anaerobic doesn't require oxygen, so they must generate ATP quickly. 

Wait, so if fast-twitch relies less on mitochondria, they probably have fewer of them. Because mitochondria are the powerhouse for aerobic, which is more slow-twitch. So, fast-twitch would have relatively fewer mitochondria compared to slow-twitch.

Now, what about ATPase activity? ATPase is the enzyme that breaks down ATP to release energy. High ATPase activity would mean they can hydrolyze ATP quickly, which is necessary for rapid muscle contractions. So fast-twitch fibres probably have high ATPase activity.

Putting this together: fast-twitch fibres have a small number of mitochondria (since they don't rely heavily on aerobic) and high ATPase activity for quick energy. 

Looking at the options, let me see. The question is asking which option describes fast-twitch fibres.

Option D says "a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity." That matches what I was thinking.

Wait, let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities? Let's see the other options. Option A has a large number of mitochondria, which I don't think is right for fast-twitch. Option B says no mitochondria, which seems too extreme; I think they do have some, just fewer. Option E has a moderate number which might be in between, but I'm pretty sure fast-twitch are low in mitochondria. So yeah, D seems correct.

Fast-twitch fibres are specialized for short, explosive bursts of activity, relying primarily on anaerobic respiration to generate ATP quickly. As a result, they have a relatively small number of mitochondria compared to slow-twitch fibres, which are aerobic and endurance-based. Additionally, fast-twitch fibres exhibit high ATPase activity, enabling rapid hydrolysis of ATP to fuel swift contractions. 

Analyzing the options, the correct description is that fast-twitch fibres contain **a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
