Question:

A sphere, a cube, and a cylinder, all of equal mass, are released from rest from the top of a short incline. The surface of the incline is extremely slick, so much so that the objects do not rotate when released, but rather slide with negligible friction. Which reaches the base of the incline first?

Options:

A: The object that is released first
B: The object that is released last
C: The cube and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the sphere
D: the sphere
E: the cylinder
F: the cube
G: The object in the middle
H: All reach the base at the same time.
I: None of them reach the base
J: The sphere and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the cube

Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it. The question is about three objects—a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder—all of equal mass, being released from rest at the top of a short incline. The incline is extremely slick, which I guess means there's very little friction. But wait, the question says they don't rotate when released; they just slide without much friction. So, I'm thinking, this has something to do with how they move down the incline. The question is, which one reaches the base first?

Hmm, I remember that when objects roll without slipping, their rotational inertia affects how quickly they accelerate. But in this case, the problem says they don't rotate because the surface is so slick. So, they're sliding without rotating. Oh wait, that's important. So if they don't rotate, their motion is purely translational. So their acceleration would depend only on their mass and the forces acting on them.

Wait, but all three objects have the same mass. So, if they're all sliding without friction, then the only force acting on them along the incline is the component of gravity. Since friction is negligible, that must mean that the acceleration is the same for all of them. Because acceleration a = g sin(theta), where theta is the angle of the incline. Oh, right, because without friction, the only thing pulling them down is gravity, and their masses cancel out, leading to the same acceleration.

So if they all have the same acceleration and are released from rest, then they should all take the same time to reach the bottom. Because the time depends on acceleration and distance. But wait, the distance each travels is different. Wait, no, the incline is the same for all, right? They all start from the same point and move down the same incline. So the distance each travels is the same, right? Or wait, no—wait, the sphere, cube, and cylinder have different shapes, but since they're sliding without rotating, their centers of mass are moving the same path. So the distance each center of mass travels is the same. So if a is the same, and distance s is same, then time t is the same. Because s = 0.5 * a * t². Solving for t gives sqrt(2s/a). So if a is same and s same, t same.

Wait, but wait. If they don't rotate, then their moments of inertia don't matter here because rotation isn't happening. So all translational motion. So all have same a, same s, same time. So they should all reach the base at the same time. So the answer would be H: All reach the base at the same time.

Looking at the options, option H says that. But wait, let me double-check. Let me think about the forces. The force along the incline is m g sin(theta). Since friction is negligible, the acceleration is g sin(theta). So same for all. So yes, same acceleration.

But wait, what about the moment of inertia? Oh wait, but since they're not rotating, moment of inertia doesn't affect the translational motion. So it's only about the translational acceleration. So all three have the same acceleration, same starting point, same distance. So same time.

So the correct answer should be H.

The problem involves a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder of equal mass sliding down a slick incline without rotating. Since the incline is extremely slick, friction is negligible, and the objects do not rotate. This means their motion is purely translational, and their acceleration is determined solely by the component of gravitational force along the incline, which is \( g \sin(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of the incline. 

Given that all three objects have the same mass and are released from the same starting point, they experience the same acceleration. Additionally, the distance each object travels down the incline is identical because the incline length is the same for all. Since the time taken to reach the base depends on the acceleration and the distance traveled, and both are the same for all three objects, they will reach the base of the incline at the same time.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: All reach the base at the same time.

Answer: H
