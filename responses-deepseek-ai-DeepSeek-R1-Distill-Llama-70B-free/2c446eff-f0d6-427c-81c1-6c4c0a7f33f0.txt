Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is about translating the statement "All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit" into predicate logic. The predicates given are Fx for x is a fruit, Jx for x is a jellybean, and Sxy for x is sweeter than y. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let me break this down. The original statement says that every jellybean is sweeter than every fruit. So, for any jellybean, when you compare it to any fruit, the jellybean is sweeter.

I think the structure should involve universal quantifiers because it's talking about all jellybeans and all fruits. So probably something like for all x and for all y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. Wait, but how do I put that into symbols?

Let me think. The statement can be rephrased as: For every x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. So in logical terms, that would be ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)). Does that make sense?

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm nesting the quantifiers correctly. Let me look at the options again. Option E is (∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)], which matches what I just thought. So E is a possibility.

But wait, another way to think about it is that for all jellybeans x and for all fruits y, Sxy holds. So maybe it's written as ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy). Let me check the options for that structure.

Looking through the options, option F is (∀x)(∀y)[(Jx • Fy) ⊃ Sxy], which is exactly what I just wrote. So F is also a candidate.

Wait, but the original statement is "all jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit." So every jellybean is sweeter than every fruit. So for every jellybean x, and for every fruit y, x is sweeter than y. So the correct expression would indeed be ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy), which is option F.

But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought E was correct. Let me see why. Option E is for every x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. That also seems correct. So both E and F seem correct. Wait, no, because in E, the jellybean is x and the fruit is y, but in F, both x and y are variables that can be any jellybean and any fruit, respectively.

Wait no, actually, in F, it's for all x and for all y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. Which is the same as saying every jellybean is sweeter than every fruit. So F correctly captures that.

But let me check the options again. Option E is written as (∀x)(Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)). So for each x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. That also seems correct.

Wait, but which one is the proper way to express it? Because in F, the implication is between (Jx and Fy) and Sxy. So it's saying that whenever you have a jellybean and a fruit, the jellybean is sweeter. That seems correct.

Alternatively, in E, it's saying that for each x that is a jellybean, every y that is a fruit, x is sweeter than y. That's the same as F, but structured differently.

Wait no, because in F, it's not separating the quantifiers. So in F, for every x and every y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then Sxy. So that includes all possible x and y. So F's structure is correct.

So which option is correct? Let me go through the options again.

Option E: For every x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y.

Option F: For every x and every y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y.

So both E and F seem to express the same thing, but with different structures. Wait, no. Wait, in logic, the order of quantifiers matters. So in E, it's ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)), which is the same as ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy), right? Because the implication inside would require that when Jx is true, for all y, Fy implies Sxy. So E and F are actually logically equivalent because they both express the same relationship.

Wait no, wait. Wait, in F, it's (∀x)(∀y)[(Jx • Fy) → Sxy]. Which is the same as ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy). In E, it's ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)), which also translates to ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy). So E and F are equivalent?

Wait, but that can't be right because they're different options. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In E, the structure is: for each x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. So it's like saying, pick any x, and if x is a jellybean, then for all fruits y, x is sweeter than y. That's correct.

In F, it's saying for any x and y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. Which is also correct. So both E and F would be correct, but that's impossible because the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option F is: (∀x)(∀y)[(Jx • Fy) → Sxy]. So that's for all x and y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y.

Option E is: (∀x)[Jx → (∀y)(Fy → Sxy)]. So for each x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y.

So E and F are structurally different, but in terms of meaning, they're the same. Because in both cases, whenever you have a jellybean and a fruit, the jellybean is sweeter. So both options E and F are expressing the same thing.

Wait, but that can't be right because the answer must be only one. So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me consider an example. Suppose we have a jellybean a and a fruit b. Then according to both E and F, S(a,b) should hold.

In E: For x=a, since Ja is true, then for all y, Fy implies S(a,y). So when y=b, which is a fruit, S(a,b) holds.

In F: For x=a and y=b, since Ja and Fb are true, then S(a,b) holds.

So both E and F result in the same conclusion. So why are both options present?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think about the logical equivalences. The statement ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)) is equivalent to ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy). Similarly, option F is exactly that. So E and F are equivalent.

But that can't be because the answer options are different. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the options are structured.

Wait, looking again, option E is written as [Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)], which is Jx → (forall y (Fy → Sxy)). So that's the same as saying for all y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. So that's correct.

Similarly, option F is saying for all x and y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. So both E and F are correct. But that's impossible because the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the other options to see if any of them could be correct.

Option A: (∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Jy ⊃ Sxy)]. So this would mean, for each x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. That's saying all jellybeans are sweeter than all jellybeans, which implies that they're all equally sweet, which isn't what the original statement says. So A is incorrect.

Option B: (∀x)(∀y)[(Fx • Jy) • Sxy]. So for all x and y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then Sxy. Wait, Sxy is x is sweeter than y. So this would mean fruits are sweeter than jellybeans, which is the opposite of the original statement. So B is incorrect.

Option C: (∀x)(∀y)[Sxy ⊃ (Jx • Fy)]. So for all x and y, if x is sweeter than y, then x is a jellybean and y is a fruit. That's not what the original statement says. The original statement doesn't say that only jellybeans are sweeter than fruits; it's possible that other things could be sweeter, but the statement is specifically about jellybeans and fruits. So C is incorrect.

Option D: (∀x)(∀y)[Sxy ⊃ (Fy • Jx)]. So if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit and x is a jellybean. Again, similar issue as C. It's making a claim about all cases where something is sweeter than something else, which is broader than the original statement. So D is incorrect.

Option G: (∀x)(∀y)[(Fx • Jy) ⊃ Sxy]. So for all x and y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. Again, this would mean fruits are sweeter than jellybeans, which is the opposite of the original statement. So G is incorrect.

Option H: (∀x)[Fx ⊃ (∀y)(Jy ⊃ Sxy)]. So for each x, if x is a fruit, then for all y, if y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. Again, this would mean fruits are sweeter than jellybeans, which is incorrect. So H is wrong.

Option I: (∀x)[Fx ⊃ (∀y)(Sxy ⊃ Jy)]. So for each x, if x is a fruit, then for all y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a jellybean. That's not the same as the original statement. The original doesn't make any claim about what y is when a fruit is sweeter than it. So I is incorrect.

Option J: (∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Sxy ⊃ Fy)]. So for each x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit. That's also not what the original statement says. The original says all jellybeans are sweeter than all fruits, not that whenever a jellybean is sweeter than something, that something must be a fruit. So J is incorrect.

So after eliminating all other options, it's between E and F. But earlier I thought both E and F are correct, which can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake there.

Wait, let me think again. The original statement is "All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit." So it's saying that for every jellybean, it's sweeter than every fruit. So for any jellybean x and any fruit y, Sxy holds.

In logic, that's ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy), which is exactly option F.

Option E says ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)), which is the same as ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy). So E and F are logically equivalent. So both would be correct, but that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option E: (∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)]

Option F: (∀x)(∀y)[(Jx • Fy) ⊃ Sxy]

Wait, in E, the scope of the universal quantifier for y is inside the implication. So in E, it's for all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. Which is correct.

In F, it's for all x and for all y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. So both E and F are expressing the same thing, but in different structures. So they are logically equivalent.

But the answer options don't have both E and F as correct, so I must have made a mistake. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the way the options are written.

Wait, in option E, the formula is Jx → (∀y (Fy → Sxy)). So for a given x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. That's correct.

In option F, the formula is (Jx ∧ Fy) → Sxy, with both x and y universally quantified. So for any x and y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. That's also correct.

So both E and F are correct. But that's impossible because the question expects only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the order of quantification. In E, the x is universally quantified first, then for each x, y is universally quantified. In F, both x and y are universally quantified together. But in logic, the order of universal quantifiers doesn't matter, so they are equivalent.

So this is confusing. But maybe the correct answer is both E and F, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the way the implications are structured makes a difference. Let me think about it. In E, for a fixed x, if x is a jellybean, then all fruits y are such that x is sweeter than y. So it's saying that for each jellybean, it's sweeter than all fruits. That's correct.

In F, it's saying that for any pair of x and y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. Which is the same as saying that all jellybeans are sweeter than all fruits.

So both E and F are correct. But the answer can only be one. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread option E. Let me check: E is (∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)]. So for each x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. That's correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is E because it's structured as for each jellybean, it's sweeter than all fruits, whereas F is structured as for any x and y, if x is jelly and y is fruit, then x is sweeter than y. So both are correct.

But since both E and F seem correct, but the answer expects one, perhaps the intended answer is F. Because F directly states that for any jellybean and any fruit, the jellybean is sweeter.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because it's more explicit in separating the jellybean and fruit variables.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the standard way of translating such statements. The sentence "All A are B" is typically translated as ∀x (A(x) → B(x)). But here, it's a comparative statement involving two predicates.

The original statement is "All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruits." So for every jellybean x, and for every fruit y, x is sweeter than y. So the correct translation would be ∀x∀y (Jx ∧ Fy → Sxy), which is option F.

So I think the correct answer is F.
</think>

The question asks for the best translation of the statement "All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit" into predicate logic, using the predicates Fx (x is a fruit), Jx (x is a jellybean), and Sxy (x is sweeter than y). The correct translation must capture the idea that for every jellybean and every fruit, the jellybean is sweeter than the fruit.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: (∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Jy ⊃ Sxy)]  
   This means "For every x, if x is a jellybean, then for every y, if y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y." This incorrectly states that all jellybeans are sweeter than all jellybeans, implying they are equally sweet, which is not the intended meaning. **Incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: (∀x)(∀y)[(Fx • Jy) • Sxy]  
   This means "For all x and y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y." This reverses the original statement, suggesting fruits are sweeter than jellybeans. **Incorrect**.

3. **Option C**: (∀x)(∀y)[Sxy ⊃ (Jx • Fy)]  
   This means "For all x and y, if x is sweeter than y, then x is a jellybean and y is a fruit." This is too broad, as it implies that only jellybeans can be sweeter than fruits, which is not the intended meaning. **Incorrect**.

4. **Option D**: (∀x)(∀y)[Sxy ⊃ (Fy • Jx)]  
   This means "For
