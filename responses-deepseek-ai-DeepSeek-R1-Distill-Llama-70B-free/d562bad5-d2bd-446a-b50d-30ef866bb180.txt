Okay, so I've got this problem here about a veterinarian and a cat on a scale. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question says the vet is holding the cat, and together they weigh 157.8 pounds. The vet alone is 148.3 pounds. I need to find out the cat's weight.

Wait, so the total weight when both are on the scale is the vet's weight plus the cat's weight, right? So if I subtract the vet's weight from the total, that should give me the cat's weight. Let me write that down.

So, 157.8 lb (total) minus 148.3 lb (vet alone) equals the cat's weight. Let me do the subtraction. 157.8 minus 148.3. Hmm, 157 minus 148 is 9, and then the decimals: 0.8 minus 0.3 is 0.5. So, 9 plus 0.5 is 9.5 pounds. Oh, wait, but let me make sure I did that right. Let me calculate it again to be sure. 148.3 plus 9.5 should be 157.8. 148.3 plus 9 is 157.3, and then plus 0.5 makes 157.8. Yep, that checks out.

So the cat weighs 9.5 pounds. Now I need to match this to the given options. Let me look at the options again.

Option A is between 12-15 lb. That's higher than 9.5, so no. Option B is 20-23, definitely higher. Option C is 16-19, also higher. Option D is 4-7 lb. Hmm, 9.5 is more than 7, so that's too low. Option E is 8-11 lb. Oh wait, 9.5 falls right into this range because 9.5 is between 8 and 11. So that's probably the right choice. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other options.

Option F is 28-31, way too high. G is 1-3, too low. H is 24-27, nope. I and J are even higher, so no. So the only one that fits is E: between 8 and 11 lb.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate correctly? Let me do the subtraction again to be thorough. 157.8 minus 148.3. Let's subtract the whole numbers first: 157 - 148 is 9. Then the decimal parts: 0.8 minus 0.3 is 0.5. So total is 9.5. Yeah, that's correct.

So the cat is 9.5 lb, which falls into option E's range of 8-11. So the best estimate is E.

The total weight of the veterinarian and the cat is 157.8 lb, and the veterinarian alone weighs 148.3 lb. To find the cat's weight, subtract the veterinarian's weight from the total weight:

\[
157.8 \, \text{lb} - 148.3 \, \text{lb} = 9.5 \, \text{lb}
\]

The cat's weight is 9.5 lb. Among the given options, the range that includes 9.5 lb is:

**E: Between 8 and 11 lb**

Thus, the best estimate for the cat's weight is:

E

Answer: E
