Okay, so I've got this question about frequency modulation and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about frequency modulated signals. 

The given signal is v(t) = 10cos(2 × 10^7 π t + 20 cos(1000 π t)). Hmm, wait, I think the general form of a frequency modulated (FM) signal is something like A cos(ω_c t + β cos(ω_m t)), where ω_c is the carrier frequency and ω_m is the modulating frequency. So in this case, the carrier is the 2e7 π term, and the modulating part is the 20 cos(1000 π t). 

Wait, but in FM, the frequency deviation is given by the term β multiplied by the modulating signal. Oh right, the formula for the instantaneous frequency is ω_c + β ω_m cos(ω_m t), I think. Or wait, no, the frequency deviation is actually β times the modulating signal. So the maximum frequency deviation would be when the cosine is at its peak, either +1 or -1, so the deviation is β. 

But wait, in the equation, I think the general form is v(t) = A cos(ω_c t + β sin(ω_m t)), but here it's a cosine. Oh, but cosine and sine are similar in terms of their max points, just shifted. So the key point is that β is the modulation index, which is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. Or wait, no, wait. The modulation index is usually defined as the maximum frequency deviation divided by the modulating frequency. Or wait, no, is it the maximum phase deviation? Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up here. 

Wait, another approach: the bandwidth of an FM signal is determined by the Carson's rule, which is approximately twice the sum of the frequency deviation and the modulating frequency. Because the FM signal creates sidebands around the carrier. So the total bandwidth is roughly 2*(Δf + f_m), where Δf is the frequency deviation and f_m is the modulating frequency. 

But wait, sometimes the formula is given as bandwidth = 2*(β * f_m + f_m) ? No, wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Oh, right, the Carson's rule is bandwidth = 2*(Δf + f_m), where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation. 

Wait, but in the given equation, the argument of the cosine is 2e7 π t + 20 cos(1000 π t). So expanding that, the term after the carrier is 20 cos(1000 π t). So the phase modulation is 20 cos(1000 π t), so the phase deviation is 20 radians. Wait, but in FM, the modulation causes a change in frequency, which relates to the time derivative of the phase. Oh wait, that's right. The instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase with respect to time, divided by 2π or something. Let me think. 

The phase of the carrier is φ(t) = ω_c t + β m(t), where m(t) is the modulating signal. So here, ω_c is 2e7 π rad/s. The modulating term is 20 cos(1000 π t), so that's the phase deviation. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in FM, the instantaneous frequency is ω_c + β ω_m cos(ω_m t), where β is the modulation index, which is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. So β is Δf / f_m. 

Wait, but in the given equation, the phase is 20 cos(1000 π t). So that's the phase modulation, not the frequency modulation. Wait, but in FM, the modulation is applied to the frequency, which is the derivative of the phase. So perhaps I'm getting phase modulation and frequency modulation mixed up. 

Wait, let's clarify. In PM (phase modulation), the phase is varied in proportion to the modulating signal. In FM, it's the frequency that's varied. But mathematically, for FM, the phase becomes the integral of the frequency. So if the frequency is ω_c + β ω_m cos(ω_m t), then the phase would be the integral of that, which is ω_c t + β (ω_m / ω_m) sin(ω_m t) + C, so it becomes ω_c t + β sin(ω_m t). So the phase in FM is changing sinusoidally. 

Alternatively, if you have a phase-modulated signal, the phase is directly modulated. So perhaps the given equation is a phase-modulated signal, but the question refers to it as frequency modulated. Hmm, but the question says it's an FM signal, so I'll proceed under that assumption. 

So, going back, the given equation is v(t) = 10 cos(2e7 π t + 20 cos(1000 π t)). So the phase is 2e7 π t plus 20 cos(1000 π t). So the term being added to the carrier is 20 cos(1000 π t). 

Wait, but in FM, the phase term would involve the integral of the modulating signal. So maybe I should find the frequency deviation from the phase expression. Because the instantaneous frequency is the time derivative of the phase. 

So the phase is φ(t) = 2e7 π t + 20 cos(1000 π t). Taking the derivative with respect to time gives the instantaneous angular frequency ω(t) = 2e7 π + 20 * (-1000 π sin(1000 π t)) ). So ω(t) = 2e7 π - 20000 π sin(1000 π t). 

Wait, then the instantaneous frequency is ω(t)/(2π) because f = ω/(2π). So f(t) would be (2e7 π)/(2π) ) + (-20000 π sin(...))/(2π) ). Simplifies to f(t) = 1e7 + (-10000) sin(1000 π t). 

So the carrier frequency is 10^7 Hz, which is 10 MHz. The modulating frequency is 1000/(2π) ? Wait, wait, no, the argument inside the cosine is 1000 π t, so the modulating frequency f_m is 1000/(2π) * 2π = 1000 Hz? Wait no, because when you have cos(ω_m t), ω_m is 2π f_m. So in this case, 1000 π is ω_m, which would mean f_m = ω_m/(2π) = (1000 π)/(2π) )= 500 Hz. 

Wait wait, because 1000 π t is the argument of the cosine. So ω_m = 1000 π rad/s, so f_m = ω_m/(2π) = 1000 π/(2π) )= 500 Hz. So the modulating frequency is 500 Hz. 

Now, from the derivative, the instantaneous frequency is 1e7 Hz plus (-10000) sin(2π * 500 t). Wait, because the sin term is sin(1000 π t) = sin(2π * 500 t). So the maximum frequency deviation is 10000 Hz. Because the sin term varies between -1 and 1, so the frequency varies from 1e7 Hz -10000 Hz to 1e7 Hz +10000 Hz. So Δf is 10,000 Hz, which is 10 kHz. 

Now, the bandwidth. Using Carson's rule, the bandwidth is approximately 2*(Δf + f_m). So that's 2*(10,000 + 500) = 2*10,500 = 21,000 Hz, which is 21 kHz. 

Looking at the options, option D is 21 kHz. So the answer should be D.

To determine the bandwidth of the given frequency-modulated (FM) signal \( v(t) = 10\cos(2 \times 10^7 \pi t + 20\cos(1000 \pi t)) \), we analyze the signal using the principles of FM modulation and Carson's rule for bandwidth.

1. **General Form of FM Signal**:  
   The general form of an FM signal is:  
   \[
   v(t) = A \cos(\omega_c t + \beta \cos(\omega_m t))
   \]  
   where \( \omega_c \) is the carrier angular frequency, \( \omega_m \) is the modulating angular frequency, and \( \beta \) is the modulation index. The modulation index \( \beta \) is related to the frequency deviation \( \Delta f \) by \( \beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} \), where \( f_m \) is the modulating frequency.

2. **Extracting Parameters**:  
   From the given signal \( v(t) = 10\cos(2 \times 10^7 \pi t + 20\cos(1000 \pi t)) \):  
   - The carrier angular frequency is \( \omega_c = 2 \times 10^7 \pi \, \text{rad/s} \), so the carrier frequency is \( f_c = \frac{\omega_c}{2\pi} = 10^7 \, \text{Hz} = 10 \, \text{MHz} \).  
   - The modulating angular frequency is \( \omega_m = 1000 \pi \, \text{rad/s} \), so the modulating frequency is \( f_m = \frac{\omega_m}{2\pi} = 500 \, \text{Hz} \).  
   - The phase deviation is \( 20 \, \text{radians} \), which corresponds to the maximum frequency deviation \( \Delta f = \beta f_m \). Here, \( \beta = 20 \), so \( \Delta f = 20 \times 500 = 10,000 \, \text{Hz} = 10 \, \text{kHz} \).

3. **Bandwidth Using Carson's Rule**:  
   The bandwidth of an FM signal is approximately given by Carson's rule:  
   \[
   \text{Bandwidth} = 2(\Delta f + f_m)
   \]  
   Substituting \( \Delta f = 10,000 \, \text{Hz} \) and \( f_m = 500 \, \text{Hz} \):  
   \[
   \text{Bandwidth} = 2(10,000 + 500) = 2 \times 10,500 = 21,000 \, \text{Hz} = 21 \, \text{kHz}.
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   The bandwidth of the given FM signal is **21 kHz**, which corresponds to option **D**.
