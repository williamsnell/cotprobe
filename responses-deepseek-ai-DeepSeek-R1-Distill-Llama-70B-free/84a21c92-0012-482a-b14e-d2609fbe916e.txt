Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about group tasks. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about a type of task where group members select a solution offered by one of the members as the group's solution. So, like, when they pick one person's idea to go with.

I remember that group tasks can be categorized in different ways based on how the group's output is determined. I think there's something about additive versus disjunctive tasks. Wait, additive tasks are where the group's performance is the sum of individual contributions, right? Like each person adds their part. But that's not exactly what the question is about.

Then there's disjunctive tasks. Oh right! I think disjunctive tasks are ones where the group's success depends on the weakest member. Like, if even one person fails, the whole group fails. But wait, that doesn't fit the question either. The question is about choosing a solution from one member.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me try to recall. Oh, I think I read about something called conjunctive and disjunctive tasks. Or was it additive and disjunctive? Wait, additive might be when each person's effort adds up. So if you have a group working on a task where each does a part, it's additive.

But the question is about selecting a solution offered by one member. So it's not about adding up, but rather choosing one option. So perhaps it's a different type. Oh wait, maybe it's a disjunctive task? Or maybe it's called a compensatory task.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe it's about the type of task where the group picks the best solution from individual ideas. So like, when each member comes up with solutions, and the group chooses the best one. That sounds like a disjunctive task because the group's solution is based on the best individual contribution. Because in disjunctive tasks, the group's performance is as good as the best member's performance. So if one person solves it, the group does.

So in a disjunctive task, the group can perform as well as the most capable member because others can pick that solution. So the question is about when the group selects a solution from one member, which fits the disjunctive task scenario.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not getting this wrong. I remember that in additive tasks, the group's output is the sum of all individual outputs. For example, if each person can do 2 tasks, a group of 3 would do 6.

Disjunctive tasks are when the group's success depends on at least one member succeeding. So if one person solves it, the group solves it. So the group's performance is determined by the best individual performance.

So the question describes a situation where the group picks one solution, which is the same as saying they're relying on the best individual solution. That would be a disjunctive task.

Looking back at the options, option D is disjunctive. So the answer should be D.

The question asks about a type of group task where members select a solution offered by one of the group members as the group’s solution. This describes a scenario where the group’s performance is determined by the best individual contribution. 

In group task theory:
- **Additive tasks** involve the sum of individual contributions.
- **Disjunctive tasks** depend on the success of at least one group member, with the group’s performance being as good as the best member’s performance.

The question aligns with the definition of a **disjunctive task**, where the group adopts the solution provided by the most capable member. Thus, the correct answer is:

D: disjunctive

Answer: D
