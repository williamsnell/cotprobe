Question:

In which set do all of the values make the inequality 2x â€” 1 < 10 true?

Options:

A: {6, 7, 8}
B: {10, 15, 20}
C: {5, 7, 9}
D: {2, 3, 4}
E: {2, 4, 6}
F: {4, 6, 8}

Okay, so I've got this inequality problem here, and I need to figure out which set of numbers makes the inequality true. The inequality is 2x minus 1 is less than 10. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I should solve the inequality to find the range of x values that satisfy it. So, the inequality is 2x - 1 < 10. I'll start by adding 1 to both sides to isolate the term with x. That gives me 2x < 11. Then, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for x, which means x < 5.5. So, any number less than 5.5 should satisfy the inequality.

Now, I need to check each of the given sets and see which one has all numbers less than 5.5. Let's look at the options:

Option A: {6, 7, 8}
Wait, all these numbers are 6 and above. 6 is greater than 5.5, so each of these would make 2x-1 equal to 11, 13, 15, all of which are more than 10. So option A doesn't work.

Option B: {10, 15, 20}
These are way larger than 5.5. Definitely, these would make the inequality false because 2 times 10 is 20, minus 1 is 19, which is way bigger than 10. So B is out.

Option C: {5, 7, 9}
Hmm, let's check each. 5 is exactly 5, which is less than 5.5. So 2*5=10, minus 1 is 9, which is less than 10. So 5 works. But wait, 7 is 7. 2*7=14, minus 1 is 13, which is greater than 10. So 7 doesn't work. Since not all elements satisfy the inequality, option C is invalid.

Option D: {2, 3, 4}
Let's check each. 2: 2*2=4-1=3 <10. Good. 3: 6-1=5 <10. 4:8-1=7 <10. All of them are under 5.5, so 2,3,4 all satisfy. So D is a candidate.

Option E: {2,4,6}
2 and 4 are fine, but 6 is 6. Let me calculate 2*6=12-1=11, which is more than 10. So 6 doesn't satisfy. Therefore, E isn't correct.

Option F: {4,6,8}
4 is okay, 2*4=8-1=7<10. But 6 gives 11, which is over 10. So F is out.

So the only set where all the numbers make the inequality true is option D: {2,3,4}.

To determine which set makes the inequality \(2x - 1 < 10\) true, first solve the inequality:

\[
2x - 1 < 10
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
2x < 11
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
x < 5.5
\]

Now, check each set to ensure all values are less than 5.5:

- **Option A**: \{6, 7, 8\}  
  All values are greater than 5.5. **Does not satisfy**.

- **Option B**: \{10, 15, 20\}  
  All values are much greater than 5.5. **Does not satisfy**.

- **Option C**: \{5, 7, 9\}  
  5 is valid, but 7 and 9 are greater than 5.5. **Does not satisfy**.

- **Option D**: \{2, 3, 4\}  
  All values are less than 5.5. **Satisfies**.

- **Option E**: \{2, 4, 6\}  
  2 and 4 are valid, but 6 is greater than 5.5. **Does not satisfy**.

- **Option F**: \{4, 6, 8\}  
  4 is valid, but 6 and 8 are greater than 5.5. **Does not satisfy**.

The only set where all values satisfy the inequality is **Option D**: \{2, 3, 4\}.

Answer: D
