Okay, so I have this question about auction rules, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is that Fernandez is planning to attend an auction where Cross & Black, one of his competitors, is liquidating their assets. The question is about which rule applies during the conduct of the auction.

The options are A through D. I remember that auction laws can vary, but there are some standard rules that typically apply. 

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: "Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve." Hmm, I think that's the general rule. I recall that by default, auctions are considered 'without reserve,' meaning the item will be sold to the highest bidder. Unless the seller specifies a reserve price, the auctioneer has to sell it regardless of the bid. So A might be correct.

Option B: "A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer." Wait, I'm not so sure about this. From what I remember, once a bid is made, it's binding until the hammer falls. But wait, maybe the bidder can retract it if the auctioneer allows it. Or perhaps this is a rule that exists. I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think the general rule is that a bidder can't just retract their bid once it's made, but maybe under certain conditions. I'll have to think more about this.

Option C: "The retraction of a bid by a bidder revives the previous bid." Oh, right! If a bidder takes back their bid, the auctioneer might then accept the next highest bid that was previously made. So if someone had bid $100, and then another bid $150, and then the $150 bidder retracts, the auctioneer can go back to the $100 bid. So C sounds correct in that case.

Option D: "If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer." Wait, if it's without reserve, that means the seller is committed to selling, right? So the auctioneer can't just pull the item back once bidding has started. But I'm not 100% certain. I think in a without reserve auction, the auction has to go through once it starts, meaning the auctioneer can't withdraw it. So D might not be correct.

Now, let me try to piece this together. The question is about which rule applies in the auction.

Looking back, option A says that sales are without reserve unless stated otherwise. That aligns with what I remember about auctions. The default is without reserve, so the seller must sell to the highest bidder unless a reserve was set.

Option B: I think the correct rule is that a bidder cannot retract their bid once it's made. So B would be incorrect because the bidder can't just retract any time before the hammer falls. Auctions usually consider bids as binding until the sale is finalized.

Option C seems correct as a general rule. When a bid is retracted, the previous bid is considered. So if the highest bidder pulls out, the next one's bid is accepted.

Option D: If it's without reserve, the auctioneer cannot withdraw the item. So D would be incorrect because without reserve means the sale is final once the auction starts.

But the question is which rule applies in the auction, so I'm looking for the correct statement.

Wait, the question is about the conduct of the auction, so perhaps the correct answer is A, because it's about whether the sale is with or without reserve.

Alternatively, maybe D is incorrect because without reserve means the auctioneer can't withdraw. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, another angle: The UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) has rules about auctions. Under UCC 2-328, an auction sale is with reserve unless notice is given that it's without reserve. Wait, no, wait. Isn't it the opposite? Or am I mixing it up?

Wait, no, I think the default is that the auction is with reserve. So the seller can set a reserve price unless the auction is advertised as absolute or without reserve. So if the auction is without reserve, the seller must sell to the highest bidder. So in that case, option A says that the sale is without reserve unless explicitly put up with reserve. Wait, that would mean the default is without reserve, which contradicts what I just thought.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me rethink. The UCC states that in an auction, unless the goods are put up with reserve, the sale is without reserve. Or is it the other way around?

I think the correct rule is that auctions are generally considered to be with reserve, meaning the seller can set a minimum price and withdraw the item if that's not met. But if the auction is advertised as "absolute" or "without reserve," then the seller must sell to the highest bidder, even if it's below a certain price.

Wait, but if that's the case, then option A would be incorrect because it says the sale is without reserve unless explicitly put up with reserve. So the default would be without reserve, which doesn't align with my current understanding.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the specifics. Let me try to recall. Under the UCC, the default is that an auction is with reserve, so the auctioneer can withdraw the goods unless the auction is explicitly without reserve.

Wait, no, I think the UCC says that if it's not specified, the auction is with reserve. So the seller can set a reserve. But if the auction is without reserve, then the auction must go through.

So in that case, option A would be incorrect because the default is with reserve, not without.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about this again. The question is, which rule applies in the auction.

Option A: Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve.

If the default is with reserve, then A is wrong. But if the default is without reserve, then A is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says, if the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article before the hammer falls. But if it's without reserve, the auctioneer can't withdraw it because the sale must proceed. So D is incorrect.

Option C is about retraction reviving the previous bid. That sounds correct, as the auctioneer would then take the next highest bid.

Option B says a bidder may retract any time until the hammer falls. I think that's incorrect because once you make a bid, you can't just take it back. It's binding.

So, the options left are A and C. But based on the UCC, I might have gotten the default wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the specific options. The question is about the rules that apply.

Option A: If the sale is without reserve unless explicitly stated otherwise.

No, I think the opposite is the case. Auctions are with reserve unless stated without reserve. So A would be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check. Under the UCC, 2-328(3): "A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in the usual manner, and until such announcement a bid may be retracted." So that would relate to option B, which says a bidder may retract until the hammer falls.

Wait, so according to that, option B would be correct because under UCC, a bid can be retracted any time before the hammer falls.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. So perhaps I was wrong about option B.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be B.

Wait, let me think again. The UCC says that a bid can be retracted before the hammer falls. So option B is correct.

But earlier I thought that option C was correct, but perhaps the correct answer here is B.

Wait, but the question is about which rule applies in the auction. So if the rule is that a bidder may retract at any time until the hammer falls, then B is correct.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought bids were binding once made, but according to UCC, they can be retracted before the hammer.

So the correct answer would be B.

But wait, let me make sure. Because I think some sources say that in an auction with reserve, the auctioneer can accept or reject bids, and the highest bidder doesn't automatically win unless it's a without-reserve auction. But regarding the retraction, UCC 2-328(3) says that a bid can be retracted before the hammer falls.

So, in that case, option B is correct.

Wait, but then what about option C? If a bid is retracted, does the previous bid get revived? I think that's a common practice, but I'm not sure if it's a stated rule.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the options are about which rule applies. So if the rule is that a bidder can retract any time until the hammer, then B is correct.

So, based on this, I think option B is the correct answer.

But wait, I thought earlier that A was correct. Now I'm getting more confused. Let me try to summarize.

The possible correct answers are either A, B, C, or D.

From UCC:

- Auctions are with reserve unless stated otherwise. So A is incorrect because it says the sale is without reserve unless stated. So A is wrong.

- B is correct because UCC allows retraction until the hammer falls.

- C is correct as a practice, but I'm not sure if it's a rule.

- D is incorrect in a without-reserve auction, the auctioneer can't withdraw.

So, the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around the rules applicable during an auction, particularly focusing on the conduct of the auction and the default rules that apply. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed in detail:

1. **Option A**: "Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve."  
   - This option suggests that auctions are default "without reserve," meaning the seller must sell to the highest bidder unless a reserve is explicitly stated. However, under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) 2-328, the default rule is that auctions are "with reserve," allowing the seller to set a minimum price and withdraw the item if the reserve is not met. Therefore, this option is **incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: "A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer."  
   - According to UCC 2-328(3), a bid can be retracted at any time before the auctioneer announces the completion of the sale, typically indicated by the fall of the hammer. This aligns with the rule stated in this option, making it **correct**.

3. **Option C**: "The retraction of a bid by a bidder revives the previous bid."  
   - While this is a common practice in auctions, it is not explicitly stated as a rule under the UCC. Therefore, this option is **not necessarily correct** as a general rule.

4. **Option D**: "If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer."  
   - In a "without reserve" auction, the seller is committed to selling the item to the highest bidder, and the auctioneer cannot withdraw the item once bidding has started. Thus, this option is **incorrect**.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it aligns with the UCC rule allowing bidders to retract their bids until the hammer falls.
