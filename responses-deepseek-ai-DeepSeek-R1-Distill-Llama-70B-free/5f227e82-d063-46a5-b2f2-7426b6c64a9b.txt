Okay, so I've got this physics problem about cooling a tank of water. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says there's a cubical tank with 1 m³ of water. It's kept at 65°C by a 1-kW heater, but then the heater is turned off. I need to find out how long it takes to cool down to 50°C, with the room temperature being 15°C. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, I remember something about Newton's Law of Cooling. Oh right, Newton's Law says that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and its surroundings. But wait, the formula I think is something like T(t) = T_s + (T_0 - T_s) * e^(-kt), where T(t) is the temperature at time t, T_s is the surrounding temperature, T_0 is the initial temperature, and k is some constant.

So the initial temperature here is 65°C, the surrounding is 15°C. We want to find the time when it drops to 50°C. So plugging into the formula:

50 = 15 + (65-15) * e^(-kt)

Let me compute that. 65-15 is 50, so 50 = 15 + 50 e^(-kt). Subtract 15 from both sides: 35 = 50 e^(-kt). Divide both sides by 50: 35/50 = e^(-kt). So that's 0.7 = e^(-kt). Taking natural log of both sides: ln(0.7) = -kt. So t = - ln(0.7) / k.

But wait, I don't know what k is. Hmm. How do I find k? Oh, right, the heater is providing power. When the heater is on, it's maintaining the temperature at 65°C, so the power is used to balance the heat loss. The heater's power is 1 kW, which is 1000 W or 1000 J/s.

The formula for heat loss is the rate of heat transfer, which is P = -dQ/dt. But when the heater is on, the system is in steady state, so the heat lost equals the heat supplied. So the heat loss rate is 1000 W.

Wait, the heat loss from the tank to the room would be given by Newton's Law of Cooling as well. The rate of cooling is proportional to the temperature difference. So the power P is equal to h * A * (T - T_s), where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and (T - T_s) is the temp difference.

So P = h A (T - T_s). Wait, when the heater is on, P is the power supplied. So when the heater is off, the cooling follows the exponential decay, and the k in Newton's law is related to h, A, and the thermal properties of the tank.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The general form is dT/dt = -k (T - T_s). The solution is T(t) = T_s + (T0 - Ts) e^{-kt}.

But to find k, I think I need to relate it to the heat transfer. The rate of heat loss is dQ/dt = -h A (T - T_s). But also, the change in temperature is related to the heat lost by the water. So dQ = m c dT, so dQ/dt = m c dT/dt.

So putting them together: m c (dT/dt) = -h A (T - T_s). So dT/dt = -(h A)/(m c) (T - T_s). Comparing this with Newton's Law dT/dt = -k (T-Ts), so k = (h A)/(m c).

But I don't have h, the convective coefficient. Hmm. Wait, but I have the power from the heater. When the system is at steady state, the heater's power equals the heat loss. So P = h A (T_initial - T_room). So P = h A (65 -15) = h A (50). So h A = P / 50 = 1000 W /50 K = 20 W/K.

So now I can write k as (h A) / (m c). Wait, m is the mass of the water. Since the volume is 1 m³, and water's density is 1000 kg/m³, mass m = 1000 kg. The specific heat of water, c, is about 4186 J/kg·K.

So k = (h A) / (m c) = 20 / (1000 * 4186) Let me compute that. 1000 *4186 = 4,186,000. So 20 /4,186,000 = approx 4.77e-6 per second.

Wait, 20 divided by 4,186,000. Let me check that calculation again. 20 divided by 4 million is 5e-6, but 4186000 is 4.186e6. So 20 /4.186e6 ≈ 4.77e-6 s^-1.

Now, the time t is ln(0.7)/(-k). Because earlier we had t = -ln(0.7)/k. Let's compute ln(0.7). ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667. So t = 0.35667 / (4.77e-6) seconds.

Wait, let's compute that. 0.35667 divided by 4.77e-6.

0.35667 / 4.77e-6 ≈ 0.35667 / 0.00000477 ≈ let's see, 0.35667 / 0.00000477.

Let me compute 0.35667 / 0.00000477. Let me rewrite this as 356670e-6 /4.77e-6 = 356670 /4.77.

Calculating 356670 ÷4.77: 4.77 * 75,000 is 4.77 *7.5e4 = let's see: 4 *7.5e4 = 300,000. 0.77 *7.5e4 = 57,750. So 357,750. Wait, that's more than 356,670. So perhaps around 74,800 seconds?

Wait, let me compute 4.77 * 74800 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 356670 /4.77.

Wait, 4.77 * 75,000 = 357,750 → which is 1080 more than 356,670. So 75,000 - (1080 /4.77) ≈ 75,000 - 226 ≈ 74,774 seconds.

So t ≈ 74,774 seconds.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because 74,774 seconds is like 867 hours, which isn't any of the options. The options are about 12-30 hours. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me retrace. So h A is 20 W/K. m is 1000 kg, c is 4186 J/kg·K. So k = (h A)/(m c) = 20/(1000*4186) = 20/(4,186,000) = approximately 4.77e-6 per second. That part seems correct.

But wait, when I calculated t, I used ln(0.7) which is negative, so t becomes positive. Wait, so t = (0.35667) / (4.77e-6) seconds. Let me compute 0.35667 /4.77e-6.

Wait, 4.77e-6 is 0.00000477. So 0.35667 /0.00000477 = approximately 0.35667 / 0.00000477.

Let me compute this division. 0.35667e6 /4.77 → because 0.000001 is 1e-6, so 0.35667 /4.77e-6 = (0.35667 /4.77) *1e6.

Wait, 0.35667 /4.77 is approximately 0.0748. So 0.0748 *1e6 = 74,800 seconds. That's what I had before. So 74,800 seconds.

But wait, 74,800 seconds is about 20.78 hours. Wait, 74,800 /3600 ≈ 20.78 hours. Looking at the options, option A is 20.64 hr, which is very close. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exact value.

Let me do the exact calculation for k. Let's compute h A = 1000 W /50 K =20 W/K. So k = 20/(1000 *4186) → 20/(4,186,000) = 20/4,186,000 = 0.00000477 s^-1.

Wait, wait, 20/(4,186,000) = (20/4,186) x 1e-3 → 20 ÷4,186 ≈ 0.004776 → so 0.004776e-3 → 4.776e-6 s^-1.

So k is 4.776e-6 s^-1.

Next, t = ln(0.7)/(-k) → ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3566749439.

So t = 0.3566749439 / (4.776e-6) → let's compute this.

0.3566749439 / 0.000004776 → Let me write both in exponents to simplify.

0.3566749439 is 3.566749439e-1.

0.000004776 is 4.776e-6.

So 3.566749439e-1 /4.776e-6 = (3.566749439 /4.776) )e( (-1) - (-6) ) → (0.746) )e5 → 7.46e4 seconds.

Wait, 3.5667 /4.776 is approximately 0.746.

So 0.746e5 = 74,600 seconds. So 74,600 seconds is approximately 20.72 hours.

Looking at the options, option A is 20.64 hours, which is very close. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, let me check if any step was wrong. Did I correctly compute k? Let me double-check.

h A is 1000 W / (65-15) = 1000/50 =20 W/K.

Yes.

k = h A / (m c) =20/(1000 *4186) =20/(4,186,000)=4.77e-6 s^-1.

Yes.

t= ln(0.7)/(-k) → 0.35667 /4.77e-6 = 74,600 seconds. 74600/3600 = 20.72 hours.

Hmm, option A is 20.64, which is about 20.72. Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more precisely.

Let me compute ln(0.7) more accurately. Using calculator, ln(0.7)= -0.35667494393873245.

So t= 0.3566749439 / 4.776e-6 → Let me compute this division.

0.3566749439 / 0.000004776 = let me compute it step by step.

0.3566749439 divided by 0.000004776.

Let me write it as (3566749439e-10) / (4.776e-6).

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's compute 0.35667494 / 0.000004776 = ?

0.35667494 / 0.000004776 = (356674.94e-6) / (4.776e-6) ) = 356674.94 /4.776 → Let me compute 356674.94 /4.776.

Calculating 4.776 * 74600 = ?

Wait, 4.776 * 74,600 → 4.776 *7e4 = 33,432.

4.776 * 4,600 = ?

Well, 4.776 *4000 = 19,104.

4.776 *600 = 2,865.6.

Adding 19,104 + 2,865.6 = 21,969.6.

So 4.776 *74,600 = 33,432 +21,969.6 =55,401.6.

But our numerator is 356,674.94. So 55,401.6 is less than that. So 74,600 is 55,401.6, and we have 356,674.94-55,401.6 *100 =?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do this division step by step.

Alternatively, 4.776 × 74600 = 4.776 *7.46e4.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, 4.776 * 74,600 = ?

4.776 *70,000 = 334,320.

4.776 *4,600 = let's see. 4.776 *4000=19,104. 4.776 *600=2,865.6. So 19,104+2,865.6=21,969.6.

So 334,320 +21,969.6=356,289.6.

Our numerator is 356,674.94. So 356,289.6 is 385.34 less than 356,674.94.

So 74,600 gives us 356,289.6. The difference is 385.34. How much more do we need?

Each additional 1 in the multiplier adds 4.776 to the product.

So 385.34 /4.776 ≈ 80.67.

So 74,600 +80.67=74,680.67. So 74,680.67 seconds.

Which is approximately 74,680.67 /3600 ≈20.744 hours.

Wait, but the option is 20.64. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k more accurately. Let's compute hA/(m c) exactly.

hA=20 W/K.

m=1000 kg.

c=4186 J/kg·K.

k = 20/(1000 *4186) → 20/(4,186,000) = 20/4,186,000.

Let me compute 20 ÷4,186,000.

4,186,000 divided by 20 is 209,300. So 20/4,186,000 = 1/209,300 ≈4.778e-6 s^-1.

So k is approximately 4.778e-6 s^-1.

So t = ln(0.7)/(-k) = 0.35667494 /4.778e-6 → let's compute.

0.35667494 /0.000004778 = ?

0.35667494 ÷ 0.000004778 = let's compute this.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals:

(0.35667494 *1e6) / (0.000004778 *1e6) )= 356674.94 /4.778.

Now divide 356674.94 by 4.778.

Let me compute 4.778 *74,000 = ?

4.778 *70,000 = 334,460.

4.778 *4,000 = 19,112.

So 4.778 *74,000 =334,460 +19,112=353,572.

But our numerator is 356,674.94. So 353,572 is 3,102.94 less.

So 3,102.94 /4.778 ≈650. So 74,000 +650=74,650.

So approximately 74,650 seconds.

74,650 /3600 = 20.736 hours.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.736 hours. The closest option is A:20.64, but perhaps I should check for any other factors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the specific heat. Wait, c for water is around 4186 J/kg·K. Did I use that correctly? Yes.

Another thought: Newton's Law of Cooling assumes that the temperature of the surroundings is constant, which it is here (15°C). Also, the tank's size is cubical, but since the volume is given as 1 m³, the shape doesn't affect the mass, which is 1000 kg.

Wait, but maybe the heat transfer equation is different. Oh wait, perhaps the formula for the time constant is (m c)/(h A), so the time constant τ is (m c)/(h A). So τ= (1000 *4186)/(20) → 4186000/20=209300 seconds. So the time constant is about 209300 s, which is about 58.14 hours.

Wait, but the time constant would be 1/k. Because k=1/τ.

So in our previous calculation, k=4.776e-6 s^-1 → 1/k≈209,300 s.

But in our calculation, we found t≈74,680 s, which is about 20.74 hours.

Looking at the options, option A is 20.64, which is very close. Perhaps the exact calculation would yield exactly 20.64 hours.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute t with more precise steps.

We have t= ln(0.7)/(-k) = (0.3566749439)/(4.778e-6).

Compute 0.3566749439 / 0.000004778.

0.3566749439 / 0.000004778 = ?

Let me compute this division:

Approximate 0.3566749439 ÷ 0.000004778.

We can write it as 356674.9439e-6 divided by 4.778e-6.

So (356674.9439 /4.778 ) * (e-6 / e-6) → 356674.9439 /4.778.

Compute 356674.9439 ÷4.778.

Let me compute 4.778 ×74600=?

4.778 *74,600 → let's compute 4.778 *70,000=334,460, 4.778 *4,600=?

4.778
