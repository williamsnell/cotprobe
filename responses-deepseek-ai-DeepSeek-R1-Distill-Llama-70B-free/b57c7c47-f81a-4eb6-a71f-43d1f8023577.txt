Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a photocopying machine's drum and calculating the total charge on it. Hmm, let me think. I remember that electric fields near a cylinder are involved here. Oh right, the formula for the electric field near a charged cylinder. I think it's something like E equals lambda over (2 * pi * epsilon_0 * r), where lambda is the linear charge density and r is the radius.

Wait, the drum is a cylinder, right? So the electric field just above the surface would be given by that formula. I remember that the electric field around a cylinder depends on whether the point is inside or outside. But since the field is just above the drum's surface, that would be outside the cylinder, so I guess the formula I mentioned applies.

The drum's diameter is 12 cm, so the radius r is half of that, which is 6 cm. Oh wait, I need to convert that into meters for SI units. So 6 cm is 0.06 meters.

The electric field E is given as 2.3e5 N/C. I need to find the total charge Q on the drum. But wait, I don't have lambda, the linear charge density. Oh right, lambda is Q divided by length L. Because charge per unit length. So lambda = Q / L. So I can write E = (Q / (L * 2 pi epsilon_0 r)) ?

Let me write that formula again:

E = (λ) / (2 π ε₀ r)

But λ is Q/L, so substituting:

E = (Q / L) / (2 π ε₀ r) → E = Q / (2 π ε₀ r L)

I can solve for Q:

Q = E * 2 π ε₀ r L

Epsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity, which is approximately 8.85e-12 F/m (farads per meter).

So putting in the numbers:

E = 2.3e5 N/C
r = 0.06 m
L = 42 cm = 0.42 m
ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m

Plugging into the equation:

Q = (2.3e5) * 2 * π * (8.85e-12) * 0.06 * 0.42

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 2 * π. 2 * 3.1416 is about 6.2832.

Then, multiply by 8.85e-12:

6.2832 * 8.85e-12 ≈ let's calculate that.

6 * 8.85 is about 53.1, 0.2832 *8.85 ≈ 2.506, so total approximately 55.606e-12 → 5.5606e-11.

Wait, more accurately:

6.2832 * 8.85e-12 = ?

Let me compute 6 *8.85=53.1, 0.2832 *8.85= approx (0.2 *8.85)=1.77, (0.08*8.85)=0.708, (0.0032*8.85)=0.02832). So total 1.77 +0.708=2.478 +0.02832=2.50632. So total 53.1 +2.50632=55.60632e-12 → 5.560632e-11.

Wait no, no, because 6.2832 is multiplied by 8.85e-12. So 6.2832 *8.85 = let me compute that more accurately.

6.2832 * 8.85:

6 *8.85 = 53.1
0.2832 *8.85: 0.2 *8.85=1.77, 0.08*8.85=0.708, 0.0032*8.85=0.02832. Sum: 1.77 +0.708 =2.478 +0.02832=2.50632. So 6.2832 *8.85=53.1 +2.50632=55.60632. So 55.60632e-12.

So 55.60632e-12 F·m.

Wait, that's the product of 2π and ε0: 2π ε0 ≈ 5.56e-11 (since 55.6e-12 is 5.56e-11).

Next, multiply by r (0.06 m) and L (0.42 m).

So 5.56e-11 * 0.06 = 3.336e-12.

3.336e-12 * 0.42 = let's see:

3.336e-12 * 0.4 = 1.3344e-12
3.336e-12 * 0.02 = 6.672e-14
Adding them: 1.3344e-12 + 6.672e-14 = 1.40147e-12 approximately.

So now, multiply by E (2.3e5 N/C):

Q = 2.3e5 * 1.40147e-12.

Compute that:

2.3e5 = 2.3 *1e5
1.40147e-12 = 1.40147 *1e-12.

Multiplying together: 2.3 *1.40147 = approx 3.223.

Then, 1e5 *1e-12 = 1e-7.

So 3.223e-7 Coulombs.

Wait, 1e-6 is micro, so 3.223e-7 is 0.3223 microcoulombs.

Looking at the options: option F is 0.32 μC, H is 0.26, G is 0.19, I is 0.58, etc.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Alternative approach: Compute step by step.

Compute 2π ε₀ r L first, then multiply by E.

Compute 2π ε₀ r L:

2 * π ≈6.2832

6.2832 * 8.85e-12 = ?

6.2832 * 8.85 = let's compute:

6 * 8.85 = 53.1
0.2832 *8.85 = 0.2832 *8 =2.2656, 0.2832 *0.85=0.24072 → total 2.50632
So 53.1 +2.50632 =55.60632.

So 6.2832 *8.85e-12 =55.60632e-12 =5.560632e-11.

Multiply by r=0.06 m:

5.560632e-11 *0.06=3.33638e-12.

Multiply by L=0.42 m:

3.33638e-12 *0.42 = let's compute 3.33638 *0.42:

3 *0.42 =1.26
0.33638 *0.42 ≈0.14128.

So total 1.26 +0.14128=1.40128.

So 1.40128e-12.

Multiply by E=2.3e5:

1.40128e-12 *2.3e5 = (1.40128 *2.3) * (1e-12 *1e5) )= ?

1.40128 *2.3 = approximately 3.222.

1e-12 *1e5 =1e-7.

So 3.222e-7 C = 0.3222e-6 C = 0.3222 μC.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.32 μC. So the closest is F.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for any possible mistakes. Maybe I overlooked a factor.

Wait, the formula I used is for a cylinder's electric field outside its surface. So the formula E = (λ)/(2 π ε₀ r) is correct. Since the problem states the electric field just above the drum's surface, which is outside, so the formula applies.

Another thing: the drum's length is 42 cm. That would be the length of the cylinder, correct. So using L=0.42 m is correct.

Let me recompute the final multiplication step.

1.40128e-12 * 2.3e5 = (1.40128 * 2.3) *1e-7.

1.40128 *2.3:

1 *2.3=2.3

0.4 *2.3=0.92

0.00128 *2.3=0.002944.

Adding: 2.3 +0.92=3.22 +0.002944=3.222944.

So 3.222944e-7 C = 0.3222944 μC.

Which is approximately 0.32 μC.

So the correct answer should be option F: 0.32 μC.

To calculate the total charge \( Q \) on the drum, we use the formula for the electric field just outside the surface of a charged cylinder:

\[
E = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the linear charge density, \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{F/m} \) is the vacuum permittivity, and \( r \) is the radius of the drum. Since \( \lambda = Q / L \), where \( L \) is the length of the drum, the formula can be rewritten as:

\[
E = \frac{Q}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r L}
\]

Rearranging for \( Q \):

\[
Q = E \cdot 2 \pi \epsilon_0 r L
\]

### Given values:
- \( E = 2.3 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N/C} \)
- \( r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{12 \, \mathrm{cm}}{2} = 6 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.06 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- \( L = 42 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.42 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{F/m} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( 2 \pi \epsilon_0 \):
   \[
   2 \pi \epsilon_0 = 2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{F/m}
   \]

2. Multiply by \( r \) and \( L \):
   \[
   5.56 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.42 = 1.401 \times 10^{-12}
   \]

3. Multiply by \( E \):
   \[
   Q = 2.3 \times 10^5 \cdot 1.401 \times 10^{-12} = 3.222 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{C}
   \]

4. Convert to microcoulombs:
   \[
   Q = 0.322 \, \mu\mathrm{C}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The total charge on the drum is approximately \( 0.32 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \), which corresponds to **option F**.
