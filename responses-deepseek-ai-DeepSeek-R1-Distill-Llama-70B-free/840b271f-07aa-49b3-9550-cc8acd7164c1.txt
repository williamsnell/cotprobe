The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.
"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity."

Options:

A: The success of the Populist party was due to the widespread implementation of the gold standard.
B: The Great Depression of the 1890s led to the success of the Populist party.
C: The Populist party gained success due to the rise of labor unions in the industrial North.
D: The success of the Populist party was a direct result of the prohibition movement.
E: After the Civil War, westward migration slowed, causing a long-term recession in many Western territories.
F: The expansion of the railroads in the West led to the success of the Populist party.
G: Western farmers resisted the mechanization of agriculture and resented government interference in rural affairs.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Populist Party and why it was successful. I'm a bit rusty on my U.S. history, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives a passage from the Populist Party Platform of 1892. Let me read that again to get a sense of their grievances. It talks about two major political parties struggling for power and plunder while the people suffer. They accuse these parties of allowing bad conditions to develop and not doing anything to stop them. They also mention issues like tariffs being used to distract from real problems like corporations, trusts, and financial issues like the demonetization of silver and usury.

So the Populists are upset with the existing political parties for not addressing the real issues affecting the common people, especially farmers and laborers. They want to restore the government to the people and focus on economic justice and fairness.

The question is asking which option was the most direct cause of the Populist Party's success. The options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Success due to the gold standard. Wait, the gold standard was actually a contentious issue. The Populists were critical of it because they wanted silver coinage, which would inflate the currency and help debtors, especially farmers. So the gold standard being implemented would have been a problem for them, not a cause of their success. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: The Great Depression of the 1890s. Hmm, the Panic of 1893 was a major depression. But wait, the Populist Party was formed in 1892, so the Panic happened just after. Maybe the economic downturn contributed, but was it the direct cause? I'm not sure. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: Rise of labor unions in the industrial North. Populists were more about farmers and rural areas. Labor unions were more associated with the Knights of Labor or other movements, but Populism was more agrarian. So C might not be the main reason.

Option D: Prohibition movement. That's about alcohol. The Populists weren't primarily focused on that. Their platform doesn't mention it, so D is probably not the answer.

Option E: Westward migration slowing. The passage talks about issues in Western territories, but I don't recall migration slowing down causing a recession. Maybe it's the opposite; migration was ongoing, but farmers were suffering from economic issues. I'm not sure E is right.

Option F: Expansion of railroads in the West. Railroads were a big issue because they were seen as monopolistic and exploitative. High railroad rates hurt farmers. So maybe F is a factor, but was it the most direct cause of their success?

Option G: Resistance to mechanization and government interference. Wait, farmers were actually adopting new machinery, but maybe they resented government policies, like laissez-faire. But the platform seems more focused on economic exploitation by corporations and banks. So G doesn't seem to fit.

Option H: Growth of corporate power and banking interests. Oh yeah, the platform is all about how corporations, banks, trusts are oppressing people. So this growth would have inspired rural activists to seek reforms. That sounds very aligned with the Populist movement.

Option I: Conservation and National Parks. That doesn't seem related. The Populists were more about economic and political reforms, not environmental issues.

Option J: Discontent with the Federal Reserve. Wait, the Federal Reserve System wasn't established until 1913. So in 1892, that wouldn't be the issue. So J is incorrect.

So narrowing it down, the main issues were about corporate and banking power. So H seems correct. Let me double-check the options. 

The question is about the cause of their success. The Populists gained support because people were upset with the power of big corporations and banks. So H is the direct cause. 

Other options like B (the depression) might have contributed, but the key factor was the growing corporate power and banking interests leading to the need for reform.

The Populist Party's success was primarily driven by widespread discontent among rural farmers and laborers who felt exploited by the growing power of corporations and banking interests. The party's platform highlighted issues such as corporate monopolies, trusts, and banking practices that unfairly burdened the common people. While events like the Panic of 1893 contributed to economic hardship, the direct cause of the Populist Party's success was the perception that corporate and financial elites were abusing their power at the expense of the working class. This aligns most closely with Option H.
