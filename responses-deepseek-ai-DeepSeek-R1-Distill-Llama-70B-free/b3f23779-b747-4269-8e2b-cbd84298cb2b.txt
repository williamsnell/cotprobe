Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the diamond structure of carbon. Hmm, I remember that diamond has a specific crystal structure, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

I think each carbon atom in diamond is bonded to four others. Right, because the valency of carbon is four. So each C atom has four nearest neighbors. Now, the question is about the shape formed by these nearest neighbors.

Wait, in a tetrahedral arrangement, each atom is surrounded by four others in a tetrahedron shape. Oh yeah, that's right. In a tetrahedron, each vertex is connected to the others, forming a pyramid with a triangular base. So if each C atom has four neighbors, they must be arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron.

Wait a second, the question asks what shape the nearest neighbors lie at the corners of. So if the four neighbors are at the corners of a tetrahedron, then the answer would be a tetrahedron.

Looking at the options, option I is tetrahedron. So I think the correct answer is I.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not confusing it with something else. Like, in a square planar arrangement, you have four neighbors around a square, but that's different. And in diamond structure, the coordination is tetrahedral, not square. So yeah, I'm confident it's I.

In the diamond structure, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four nearest neighbors, forming a tetrahedral arrangement. This means the nearest neighbors are positioned at the corners of a tetrahedron. Among the given options, the correct one is:

I: tetrahedron

Answer: I
