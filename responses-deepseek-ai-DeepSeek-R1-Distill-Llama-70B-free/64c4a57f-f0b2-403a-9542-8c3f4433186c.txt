Question:

A woman owned four beach houses. Each house had star-shaped windows. As the hurricane season was approaching, she hired a carpenter to build storm windows for the star-shaped and deliver them to the four houses. Because of the unique shape of the windows, the carpenter had to do all work by hand. The carpenter and woman signed a contract under which the carpenter promised to build and deliver the storm windows to all four beach houses within 30 days, and the woman promised to pay $8,000 ($2,000 per beach house) within one week of completion of the job. Two weeks after the contract was signed, a fire destroyed the carpenter's workshop, where he was storing all the completed storm windows before delivery. The carpenter then sent a letter to the woman that read:"The fire destroyed my equipment and inventory  including the storm windows, which had been completed and which were awaiting delivery. I am dead broke and cannot complete my obligations under the contract. " The woman then telephoned the carpenter and told him, "Unless you fulfill your contractual obligations, I will sue you!"In an action for specific performance to compel the carpenter to build and deliver the storm windows, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: not succeed, because the carpenter's workshop was destroyed before he could deliver the storm windows.
B: succeed, because the beach houses would suffer severe damage in the event a hurricane struck without the storm windows having been installed.
C: succeed, because the carpenter should have insured his inventory and equipment.
D: succeed, because the contract requires the carpenter to deliver the storm windows within a specified time frame.
E: not succeed, because the carpenter's performance would be excused by the unforeseeable act of God.
F: not succeed, because the woman did not pay the carpenter in advance.
G: succeed, because the carpenter's loss of the inventory would not excuse his duty of performance.
H: succeed, because the carpenter had completed the storm windows but failed to deliver them.
I: not succeed, because the carpenter's loss of inventory would render his performance impossible.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, a woman owns four beach houses, each with star-shaped windows. She hires a carpenter to build storm windows for these unique windows and deliver them to the four houses. They sign a contract where the carpenter agrees to build and deliver the storm windows within 30 days, and the woman will pay $8,000 (which is $2,000 per house) within one week after the job is done.

Two weeks after signing the contract, a fire destroys the carpenter's workshop. All the completed storm windows were stored there waiting to be delivered. The carpenter writes to the woman saying the fire destroyed everything, including the completed windows, and that he's broke and can't fulfill his obligations. The woman threatens to sue unless he does.

The question is about whether the woman can get specific performance from the carpenter to build and deliver the storm windows. The options are A to J.

Hmm, okay. So, specific performance is when the court orders a party to perform their duties under the contract, especially when monetary damages aren't sufficient. It's usually granted when the subject matter is unique or when monetary damages can't compensate the loss.

So, the main issue here seems to be whether the carpenter's failure is excused by some doctrine, like impossibility or act of God, or if he's still required to perform.

First, I remember that for specific performance, the plaintiff must show that the contract is clear and that the remedy at law (like money damages) is inadequate. Here, the windows are custom-made for star-shaped windows, which might make them unique enough for specific performance.

But wait, the carpenter's workshop and the windows were destroyed by a fire. Does that count as an act of God, making performance impossible? I think the doctrine of impossibility can relieve a party of their obligation if completing the contract becomes impossible without fault on their part.

In this case, the fire destroyed the workshop and the completed windows. The carpenter says he's broke and can't complete the job. So, does that mean he can't perform because of the fire, which is an unforeseen event beyond his control?

Wait, but the contract was about building and delivering. The fire happened after he started but before delivery. The carpenter had already built the windows but couldn't deliver because they were destroyed. Or did he? Wait, the problem says that the fire destroyed all the completed storm windows which were awaiting delivery. So, the windows were built but not yet delivered when the fire happened.

Wait, but the contract required him to build and deliver within 30 days. So, after two weeks, the windows were completed but not delivered. Then the fire happened, destroying them.

So, the question is whether the carpenter can be forced to rebuild them. Because he's saying he can't because he's broke. But the woman wants specific performance.

So, the main issue is whether the destruction of the goods by fire is an event that excuses the carpenter from performing. But I remember that under the doctrine of risk of loss, sometimes the risk is on the seller until delivery. But in contracts, unless specified otherwise, the risk might be on the seller until the goods are delivered. So if the goods were destroyed before delivery, the loss might fall on the seller. But does that mean the seller is still obligated to deliver?

Wait, but in this case, the fire happened before delivery. The contract required the carpenter to both build and deliver. So, he built them but didn't deliver, then they were destroyed. So, does that mean he can't perform because the goods are gone, and he can't rebuild them because he's broke?

But the woman is asking for specific performance. So, she wants the court to order him to build and deliver new ones. But if he can't do that because he has no workshop or funds, is that possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the carpenter's obligation is to deliver, and since the goods were destroyed, he can't, so he's in breach. But maybe the fire is an act of God, making his performance impossible, thus excusing him.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) rules because this involves the sale of goods. Under UCC §2-613, when goods are totally destroyed before the risk of loss passes, the contract is avoided, and the seller doesn't have to perform. But if the goods were completed and the risk had passed to the buyer, then the seller might still be liable.

Wait, no, let me clarify. Under UCC §2-509, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the seller delivers the goods. But in this case, the seller (carpenter) was supposed to deliver, but the goods were destroyed before delivery. So, the risk was still on the seller, so the destruction would be his problem, and he can't deliver, so he's in breach, and the contract is avoided. That would mean the woman can't get specific performance because the contract is excused.

Wait, but the problem isn't about the woman suing for breach; it's about her suing for specific performance. So, she wants the court to order him to perform.

But if the goods were destroyed, and he can't perform, can the court order him to do so? Or does the impossibility doctrine apply?

The doctrine of impossibility applies when performance becomes impossible due to an unforeseen event, making it excused. But the destruction of the workshop and goods might qualify. However, I think that the carpenter's inability to perform due to his own financial situation (being broke) is a separate issue. But the fire was an external event beyond his control.

Wait, but the destruction of the goods before delivery might mean that the contract is avoided under the UCC, so the woman can't get specific performance because the contract is no longer enforceable.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The carpenter had the obligation to deliver within 30 days. Two weeks into the contract, he completes the windows but before delivering, a fire destroys them. So, he can't deliver, and he can't rebuild because he's broke.

But the woman's argument is that she wants specific performance, meaning she wants the carpenter to build new ones.

But under the UCC, if the goods were destroyed before the risk of loss passed, the seller is excused from performing. So, the contract is avoided, and the seller doesn't have to perform. So, the woman can't get specific performance because the contract is no longer in force.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the contract is governed by common law or the UCC. Since it's about custom-made storm windows, maybe it's a service contract, but the UCC applies to goods. So, if the storm windows are goods, then UCC applies.

But another angle is that the carpenter's obligation was to build and deliver, so if he can't, maybe he's in breach, but specific performance might not be possible if he can't perform.

Wait, but the woman is suing for specific performance, which requires the court to order the carpenter to perform. But if the carpenter can't because he's broke and his workshop is destroyed, can the court order him to do so? Or would the court consider that impossible?

Alternatively, maybe the destruction of the goods before delivery doesn't excuse the carpenter because he should have had insurance. But I don't think that's a legal requirement; it's more of a business decision.

Wait, looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Not succeed because the workshop was destroyed before delivery. Hmm, but the contract was to deliver, not just build. So, destruction before delivery might be an issue.

Option B: Succeed because the houses would suffer damage without the windows. That's about the necessity of specific performance, which could be a reason, but I'm not sure if it's the main point here.

Option C: Succeed because the carpenter should have insured. I don't think that's a legal requirement, so this might not apply.

Option D: Succeed because the contract requires delivery within 30 days. But the time frame is about when he had to deliver, not sure if that's the main issue.

Option E: Not succeed because act of God. Fire as an unforeseeable event, so performance is excused.

Option F: Not succeed because woman didn't pay in advance. The contract says she pays after completion, so this isn't relevant.

Option G: Succeed because loss of inventory doesn't excuse duty. But if the goods were destroyed, maybe it does.

Option H: Succeed because he completed but didn't deliver. But the goods were destroyed, so he can't deliver.

Option I: Not succeed because performance is impossible. If the goods are gone and he can't rebuild, maybe.

So, the key issue is whether the destruction of the goods before delivery (and thus before risk passes) means the contract is avoided, making specific performance impossible.

Under UCC §2-613, when goods are destroyed without fault of either party and before the risk of loss passes, the contract is avoided, and both parties are excused. So, in this case, the fire destroyed the goods before delivery, so the contract is avoided, and the carpenter doesn't have to perform.

Therefore, the woman can't get specific performance because the contract is no longer enforceable.

So, looking at the options, E says not succeed because act of God, and I says not succeed because impossible.

Wait, but the destruction of the goods by fire would be an act of God, which is an unforeseen event beyond control, making performance impossible. So, the carpenter's performance is excused.

So, the answer would be either E or I.

I think the correct doctrine here is impossibility. So, E says it's excused by act of God, which is a type of impossibility. So, under common law, an act of God can excuse performance if it makes it impossible.

But wait, the UCC might have specific rules. So, under UCC §2-613, as I thought earlier, the contract is avoided if the goods are destroyed before the risk passes, which would make the woman's claim for specific performance fail.

So, in that case, the answer would be E: not succeed, because the carpenter's performance is excused by an unforeseeable act of God.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The UCC says that if goods are destroyed without fault, the contract is avoided. So, the seller doesn't have to perform, and the buyer doesn't have to pay. So, the woman can't get specific performance because the contract is now avoided.

So, the reason is that the contract is excused due to the destruction of the goods, which is an act of God. So, the answer would be E.

Alternatively, option I says not succeed because performance is impossible. But the destruction of the goods makes it impossible, so I think E is more accurate because it's an act of God, which is a specific doctrine.

Wait, but the question is about specific performance. So, even if the contract is avoided, the woman can't get specific performance. So, the answer would be E.

Wait, but another thought: the contract was to build and deliver. If the windows were destroyed after being built but before delivery, does that mean that the carpenter has substantially performed? Or is the destruction an event that makes the contract impossible to perform?

I think the destruction would make it impossible for him to deliver, so he's excused. Therefore, specific performance isn't possible, so the woman can't compel him.

So, looking at the options:

E: not succeed, because the carpenter's performance would be excused by the unforeseeable act of God.

I think that's the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the woman can compel the carpenter to specifically perform the contract to build and deliver custom storm windows after the carpenter's workshop and completed windows were destroyed in a fire. The key issue is whether the carpenter's performance is excused due to the fire, an unforeseeable event, or whether he is still obligated to fulfill the contract.

Under contract law, specific performance is typically granted when the subject matter is unique and monetary damages would be inadequate. However, the doctrine of impossibility or act of God can excuse a party's performance if an unforeseen event beyond their control makes performance impossible. 

In this case, the fire destroyed the completed storm windows before delivery, and the carpenter claims he is unable to rebuild them due to financial hardship. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) §2-613, when goods are destroyed without fault of either party and before the risk of loss passes to the buyer, the contract is avoided, and both parties are excused from further performance. Since the fire occurred before delivery, the risk of loss remained with the carpenter, and the destruction of the goods excused his obligation to perform.

Among the options, **E** is the most accurate because the fire constitutes an unforeseeable act of God, which excuses the carpenter's performance under the doctrine of impossibility. While **I** also touches on impossibility, **E** specifically identifies the act of God as the basis for excusing performance, making it the better answer.

ANSWER: E
