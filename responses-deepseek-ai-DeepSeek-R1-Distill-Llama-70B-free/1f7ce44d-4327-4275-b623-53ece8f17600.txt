Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about emissivity and power input. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Okay, the problem says that the emissivity of tungsten is approximately 0.35. There's a sphere, radius 1 cm, suspended in an evacuated enclosure. The enclosure's walls are at 300 K, and the sphere is at 3000 K. I need to find the power input required to maintain that temperature, ignoring heat conduction through the supports.

Wait, emissivity... emissivity is a measure of how efficiently an object radiates energy. Oh right, emissivity (ε) is a factor between 0 and 1. So a higher emissivity means the object radiates more effectively.

The sphere is in an evacuated enclosure, so there's no convection, only radiation. The sphere must be losing heat through radiation, but since it's being maintained at a higher temperature, there must be some power input to balance the heat loss.

Radiation heat transfer is usually calculated with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is σ, which is approximately 5.67×10^-8 W/m²K⁴. The formula for power radiated by an object is P = εσA(T_obj⁴ - T_surround⁴), but wait, no. Let me get this right.

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the power emitted by a black body is P = εσA T^4. But when considering the net power loss, it's the difference between the power the object emits and the power it absorbs from the surroundings. So the net power loss would be P = εσA (T_obj⁴ - T_surr⁴).

But wait, the sphere is at 3000 K, the surroundings are at 300 K. So the sphere is hotter, so it's losing heat to the surroundings. But in this case, the problem says we need to find the power input required to maintain the sphere's temperature. So the power input must balance the net heat loss, meaning that the input power equals the net radiated power.

So the power input P would be equal to the net power radiated by the sphere, which is P = εσA (T_sphere^4 - T_walls^4).

Wait, but wait: the sphere is inside the enclosure. So the sphere emits radiation, but the enclosure's walls also emit radiation. So the net loss is the sphere's emission minus the absorption from the walls.

Wait, actually, the correct formula for net power is P = εσA (T_sphere^4) - (ε_surroundings σ A_surroundings T_surround^4), but wait, the enclosure is large, so perhaps we can consider it as a black body surrounding the sphere. Oh, but the sphere is suspended inside, so the surrounding is a large enclosure, meaning the sphere is surrounded by walls at 300 K.

Wait, perhaps the surrounding is considered as a black body at 300 K. So the sphere is at 3000 K, emissivity 0.35. The net power loss from the sphere is the power it radiates minus the power it receives from the surrounding.

Wait, but the surrounding is at a lower temperature, so the sphere is losing more heat than it gains. Thus, the net power loss is P = εσA (T_sphere^4 - T_surr^4).

But wait, the enclosure is large, so the radiation from the walls would be approximately that of a black body. So the sphere's net radiation loss is P = ε σ A (T_sphere^4 - T_wall^4).

But wait, the surrounding's emissivity is probably considered as 1 since it's a large evacuated enclosure, so it's treated as a black body.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says the power radiated by an object is P = ε σ A T^4.

But in this case, the sphere is in an environment where it both emits and absorbs radiation. So the net power lost by the sphere would be its emission minus the absorption. The absorption comes from the surrounding walls.

So, the sphere emits ε σ A T_sphere^4 of power. The surrounding walls emit σ A_wall T_wall^4 (since for a black body, ε=1). But wait, in the case of the enclosure, the sphere is surrounded by walls that are at 300 K, so the sphere is absorbing radiation from those walls.

But wait, the size of the enclosure compared to the sphere matters. Since the enclosure is large, the sphere is effectively in a uniform radiation field from the walls. The power absorbed by the sphere would be the power it receives from the walls.

So the power received by the sphere from the walls is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the walls, multiplied by the sphere's cross-sectional area. Hmm, wait, no. Because the walls emit in all directions, but the sphere intercepts a small fraction of that.

Alternatively, for an object in a much larger enclosure, the power absorbed by the object from the walls can be approximated as P_abs = ε σ A T_wall^4, where A is the surface area of the object.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the object's surface area is A, and the walls are at T_wall, so the object is receiving radiation from the walls. The emissivity of the object (ε) affects how much it absorbs, so P_abs = ε σ A T_wall^4.

So the net power loss from the object is P_loss = P_emitted - P_absorbed.

So P_loss = ε σ A T_sphere^4 - ε σ A T_wall^4.

Factor out ε σ A: P_loss = ε σ A (T_sphere^4 - T_wall^4).

Therefore, the power input needed to maintain the sphere's temperature is equal to the power loss, so P_input = P_loss = ε σ A (T_sphere^4 - T_wall^4).

Wait, but wait: emissivity is the same for emission and absorption. So that should be correct.

So now I just need to plug in the numbers.

Given:
ε = 0.35
Radius r = 1 cm = 0.01 m.
So the surface area A = 4 π r².
T_sphere = 3000 K
T_wall = 300 K
σ = 5.67e-8 W/m²K⁴

Compute A: 4 * π * (0.01)^2 = 4 * π * 0.0001 = 0.00125664 m² approximately.

Wait, let me compute A accurately.

r = 0.01 m, so r² = 0.0001 m². 4πr² = 4 * 3.1416 * 0.0001 = approx 0.00125664 m².

Then, compute (T_sphere^4 - T_wall^4) = (3000^4) - (300^4).

Compute each term:

3000^4 = (3e3)^4 = 81e12 = 81,000,000,000,000 (since 3^4=81, and (10^3)^4=1e12, so 81e12 = 8.1e13? Wait, wait, 3^4 is 81, 3e3 is 3000, so (3e3)^4 is 81e12. So 81e12 = 8.1e13? Wait, 1e12 is 10^12, so 81e12 is 8.1e13.

Wait no, 3e3 is 3000. (3000)^4 = (3^4)*(1000^4) = 81 * 1e12 = 8.1e13.

Similarly, 300^4 = (3^4)*(100^4) = 81 * 1e8 = 8.1e9.

So subtracting: 8.1e13 - 8.1e9 = approx 8.1e13 (since 8.1e9 is much smaller than 8.1e13).

Wait, let me compute it accurately:

8.1e13 = 81000000000000
8.1e9 = 8100000000

Subtracting: 81000000000000 - 8100000000 = 80910000000000.

Wait, that's 8.091e13.

So (T^4 difference) is 8.091e13 K^4.

Now, putting it all together:

P = ε σ A (T^4 difference)

ε = 0.35

σ =5.67e-8 W/m²K⁴

A= ~0.00125664 m²

So compute each term:

0.35 * 5.67e-8 = let's see, 0.35 *5.67 is about 1.9845, so 1.9845e-8.

Multiply by A: 1.9845e-8 * 0.00125664 = approx 2.494e-11.

Wait, wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.35 *5.67e-8 = ?

0.35 *5.67 = let me compute: 5 *0.35=1.75, 0.67*0.35=0.2345, so total 1.75+0.2345=1.9845.

So 1.9845e-8.

Now multiply by A (0.00125664):

1.9845e-8 * 0.00125664 = 1.9845e-8 * 1.25664e-3 = (1.9845 *1.25664) * 1e-11.

What's 1.9845 * 1.25664?

Approx 2.5, because 2 *1.25 is 2.5, but let's compute:

1.9845 *1.25664 = 

Let me approximate:

1.9845 *1.25 = 2.4806, and 1.25664 is 1.25 +0.00664, so 1.9845 *0.00664 is about 0.01317. So total is approximately 2.4806 +0.01317=2.4938.

So 2.4938e-11.

Then multiply by (T^4 difference), which is 8.091e13.

So power P = 2.4938e-11 *8.091e13.

Multiply the exponents first: 1e-11 * 1e13 = 1e2.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.4938 *8.091.

Let me compute that:

2 *8 is 16, 0.4938 *8 is about 3.9504, so 16 +3.9504=19.9504.

But wait, more accurately:

2.4938 *8.091.

Compute 2 *8.091=16.182

0.4938 *8.091: Let me compute 0.4*8.091=3.2364, 0.0938*8.091≈0.759. So total 3.2364 +0.759=3.9954.

So total 16.182 +3.9954=20.1774.

So 20.1774e2 = 2017.74 watts.

Wait, so approximately 2020 watts.

Looking at the options, option D is 2020 watts.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the power input required to maintain the tungsten sphere at 3000 K inside an evacuated enclosure with walls at 300 K, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiative heat transfer. The net power loss from the sphere is given by:

\[
P = \epsilon \sigma A \left(T_{\text{sphere}}^4 - T_{\text{wall}}^4\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- Emissivity of tungsten: \(\epsilon = 0.35\)
- Radius of the sphere: \(r = 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m}\)
- Surface area of the sphere: \(A = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi (0.01)^2 = 0.00125664 \, \text{m}^2\)
- Temperature of the sphere: \(T_{\text{sphere}} = 3000 \, \text{K}\)
- Temperature of the enclosure walls: \(T_{\text{wall}} = 300 \, \text{K}\)
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: \(\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W/m}^2\text{K}^4\)

### Step 1: Compute \(T_{\text{sphere}}^4 - T_{\text{wall}}^4\)
\[
T_{\text{sphere}}^4 = (3000)^4 = 8.1 \times 10^{13} \, \text{K}^4
\]
\[
T_{\text{wall}}^4 = (300)^4 = 8.1 \times 10^{9} \, \text{K}^4
\]
\[
T_{\text{sphere}}^4 - T_{\text{wall}}^4 = 8.1 \times 10^{13} - 8.1 \times 10^{9} = 8.091 \times 10^{13} \, \text{K}^4
\]

### Step 2: Compute the power input
\[
P = \epsilon \sigma A \left(T_{\text{sphere}}^4 - T_{\text{wall}}^4\right)
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
P = (0.35)(5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.00125664)(8.091 \times 10^{13})
\]

First, calculate \(\epsilon \sigma A\):
\[
\epsilon \sigma A = (0.35)(5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.00125664) = 2.4938 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Now, multiply by \((T_{\text{sphere}}^4 - T_{\text{wall}}^4)\):
\[
P = (2.4938 \times 10^{-11})(8.091 \times 10^{13}) = 20.1774 \times 10^2 = 2017.74 \, \text{W}
\]

### Final Answer:
The power input required to maintain the sphere at 3000 K is approximately **2020 watts**, which corresponds to option **D**.
