The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Self-efficacy (the belief that one has control over one's situation) as it related to job satisfaction was studied. When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30. Which statement follows from this correlation?

Options:

A: Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.
B: There is a negative correlation between job satisfaction and self-efficacy.
C: The correlation implies that job satisfaction causes increased self-efficacy.
D: The correlation of 0.30 indicates that there is no relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction.
E: If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.
F: Teachers who were less satisfied with their job had more confidence in their ability to control their situation.
G: The correlation implies that self-efficacy causes increased job satisfaction.
H: If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.
I: 30% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.
J: 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.

Okay, so I've got this question about self-efficacy and job satisfaction, and their correlation. Hmm, I remember that correlation is a measure of how two variables relate to each other. The value given here is 0.30. Wait, correlation ranges from -1 to +1, right? So 0.30 is a positive correlation, but not a very strong one.

The question is about what follows from this correlation. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says that more satisfied teachers were less confident. But a positive correlation (0.30) means that as one increases, the other does too. So if satisfaction is higher, self-efficacy should be higher, not lower. So A is wrong.

Option B claims a negative correlation, but 0.30 is positive, so B is incorrect.

Option C suggests that job satisfaction causes increased self-efficacy. Wait, but correlation doesn't imply causation. We can't tell from a correlation which variable causes which. So C is making a causal claim without justification. So C is wrong.

Option D says the correlation indicates no relationship because 0.30 is small. But any non-zero correlation, even if small, indicates some relationship. So D is incorrect.

Option E advises giving teachers more control to make them happy. That's suggesting a cause and effect, but again, correlation doesn't prove causation. Plus, it's a policy suggestion based on a statistical finding without evidence of causation. So E might not be the best choice.

Option F says less satisfied teachers have more confidence. That would imply a negative correlation, but our correlation is positive. So F is wrong.

Option G says self-efficacy causes job satisfaction. Again, correlation doesn't establish causation. We can't conclude that from the given data, so G is incorrect.

Option H suggests making teachers happier will make them take more control. Once more, this is a causative statement. The data only shows a relationship, not the direction of causation. So H is making an unwarranted assumption.

Option I says 30% of variability is explained. Wait, the correlation coefficient (r) is 0.30. To find the variance explained, we square r. So 0.3 squared is 0.09, which is 9%. So I is incorrect because it states 30%, which is r squared times 100.

Option J states that 9% of variability is explained. That matches with r squared being 0.09, so J is correct. Oh wait, but the question is about what follows from the correlation. So the correct statement is that 9% of the variability is explained, which is J.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. So the coefficient is 0.30, which is r. The coefficient of determination is r squared, which is 0.09, meaning 9% of the variance is explained. So yes, J is correct.

So looking back, the correct answer is J.

The correlation of 0.30 indicates a positive relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. This correlation does not imply causation, so statements suggesting causality (e.g., C, E, G, H) are incorrect. Additionally, a correlation of 0.30 is not strong, but it does indicate some relationship, making options A, B, D, and F incorrect. The correct interpretation is that 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by self-efficacy, which corresponds to squaring the correlation coefficient (0.30Â² = 0.09). Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.
