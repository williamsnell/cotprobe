Question:

Tom spends 4 days at the resort and 10 hours in the steam-massage room. In a 7 day stay, Jane spends 30 hours with masseurs. Their bills are $500. and $1,125, respectively. The cost of a visit (C) is given by the following linear equation: C =xD+yH. Find the values of the constants x and y.

Options:

A: x = $100, y = $15
B: x = $75, y = $20
C: x = $90, y = $35
D: x = $70, y = $15
E: x = $125, y = $5
F: x = $50, y = $25

Okay, so I've got this problem about a resort's guest fees, and I need to figure out the values of x and y in the equation C = xD + yH. Hmm, let's see. 

Alright, the problem says that the cost C depends on the duration of the visit D and the time spent in the steam-massage room H. So the equation is linear, which makes sense because each day and each hour probably has a fixed cost.

There are two guests provided as examples. Let me jot that down. 

First, Tom stays for 4 days (D=4) and spends 10 hours in the steam room (H=10). His total bill is $500. 

Second, Jane stays for 7 days (D=7) and spends 30 hours, but wait, the problem says she spends 30 hours with masseurs. Oh wait, maybe that's the same as the steam-massage room time? I think so. So H=30 for Jane, and her bill is $1125.

So I can set up two equations based on these two data points.

For Tom:
C = xD + yH
500 = x*4 + y*10

For Jane:
1125 = x*7 + y*30

Now I need to solve these two equations to find x and y.

Let me write them out clearly:
1) 4x + 10y = 500
2) 7x + 30y = 1125

Hmm. I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.

Let me try to eliminate one variable. Maybe I can manipulate equation 1 to make the coefficients of x or y the same.

Looking at equation 1: 4x +10y=500. Maybe I can multiply this equation by 7 so that the coefficient of x becomes 28, matching equation 2 which has 7x. Wait, no, equation 2 has 7x, so if I multiply equation 1 by something else. Alternatively, maybe I can multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of y the same. Wait, let's see:

Equation 1: 4x +10y =500 → Multiply by 3 → 12x +30y =1500
Equation 2:7x +30y=1125 → Multiply by 1 → 7x +30y=1125

Wait, if I subtract equation 2 from the scaled equation 1, the y terms would cancel out.

Wait, no, in the scaled equation 1, it's 12x+30y=1500. Equation 2 is 7x+30y=1125. So if I subtract equation 2 from equation 1 scaled:

(12x +30y) - (7x +30y) = 1500 -1125 → 5x = 375 → x=75.

Wait, that can't be right because 5x=375 → x=75. But let me double-check:

Yes, (12x -7x)=5x, and 30y-30y=0. 1500-1125=375. So 5x=375 → x=75. Okay, so x is 75.

Now plug x=75 back into one of the equations to find y. Let's use equation 1: 4x +10y=500.

So 4*75 = 300. So 300 +10y=500 → 10y=200 → y=20.

Wait, so x=75, y=20. Let me check with equation 2 to make sure.

Equation 2: 7x +30y =1125. Plugging in x=75, y=20:

7*75=525, 30*20=600. 525+600=1125. Yep, that's correct.

So x=75, y=20. Now looking at the options, let's see which option matches.

Option B says x=$75, y=$20. So the answer should be option B.

To determine the values of the constants \( x \) and \( y \) in the cost equation \( C = xD + yH \), we use the data provided for Tom and Jane.

### Step 1: Set up the equations
From Tom's data:
- \( D = 4 \), \( H = 10 \), \( C = 500 \)
  \[
  4x + 10y = 500 \tag{1}
  \]

From Jane's data:
- \( D = 7 \), \( H = 30 \), \( C = 1125 \)
  \[
  7x + 30y = 1125 \tag{2}
  \]

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations
To eliminate \( y \), multiply equation (1) by 3:
\[
12x + 30y = 1500 \tag{3}
\]

Subtract equation (2) from equation (3):
\[
(12x + 30y) - (7x + 30y) = 1500 - 1125
\]
\[
5x = 375 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 75
\]

### Step 3: Find \( y \)
Substitute \( x = 75 \) into equation (1):
\[
4(75) + 10y = 500
\]
\[
300 + 10y = 500 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10y = 200 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 20
\]

### Step 4: Verify the solution
Substitute \( x = 75 \) and \( y = 20 \) into equation (2):
\[
7(75) + 30(20) = 525 + 600 = 1125
\]
The values satisfy both equations.

### Final Answer
The constants are \( x = 75 \) and \( y = 20 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**B: \( x = 75 \), \( y = 20 \)**

Answer: B
