Question:

A police officer entered a private home in response to a reported disturbance. She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with "deviate sexual intercourse", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?

Options:

A: The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.
B: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes on the men's Ninth Amendment rights, which protect other rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.
C: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes the men's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.
D: The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.
E: The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.
F: The statute is constitutional as it promotes the common good.
G: The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.
H: The statute is constitutional as it is based on the state's interpretation of religious principles.
I: The statute is unconstitutional as it goes against the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
J: The statute is constitutional because it falls within the state's police power to regulate health, safety, welfare, and morals.

Okay, so I've got this question about a Supreme Court case involving a state law that criminalizes same-sex relations. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The scenario is that a police officer enters a private home after a disturbance call, but finds no disturbance. Instead, she sees two men having consensual sex. They're arrested under a state law prohibiting "deviate sexual intercourse" between same-sex individuals. They were convicted, appealed through state courts without success, and now are at the U.S. Supreme Court.

The question is asking what the Supreme Court's likely holding would be. The options are from A to J, each presenting a different constitutional argument.

I remember from my studies that this situation resembles the case of Lawrence v. Texas (2003). In that case, the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that criminalized sodomy between consenting adults of the same sex. The Court held that such a law violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects the liberty of individuals.

Wait, in the Lawrence case, Justice Kennedy's majority opinion emphasized the right to privacy and personal autonomy. They found that intimate sexual conduct between consenting adults is part of the liberty protected by the Constitution. So the law was unconstitutional because it intruded on that right without a valid state interest.

But looking at the options here, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: The feds can't interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality. That sounds like the state's rights argument, but in Lawrence, the Court did interfere, so this option is probably incorrect.

Option B: Ninth Amendment protects unenumerated rights. While the Ninth Amendment was discussed in some cases, the primary holding in Lawrence was on substantive due process, so B might not be the main reasoning.

Option C: Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Lawrence didn't primarily use equal protection. They were more focused on the Due Process Clause. But wait, some might argue equal protection because the law targets same-sex couples. But in the actual case, the majority relied on due process, not equal protection. So C might not be correct.

Option D: First Amendment, freedom of expression. I don't think this applies here because the issue is about sexual conduct, not expression, unless you interpret it very broadly. Probably not D.

Option E: Relationship not protected by privacy. But Lawrence said the opposite, so E is likely wrong.

Option F: Promotes the common good. The Court in Lawrence didn't find that a sufficient rationale, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Substantive due process. Yes, this seems right because the Court in Lawrence held that the liberty interest includes the right to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct. So G would be the reasoning.

Option H: Based on religious principles. The Court usually doesn't uphold laws that are purely based on religious views without a secular purpose. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Eighth Amendment, cruel and unusual punishment. The issue here isn't about punishment's cruelty but the law itself. So I is not it.

Option J: Police power for health, safety, welfare, morals. States often use police power, but in Lawrence, the Court said the state's moral disapproval alone isn't enough to criminalize private conduct. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Lawrence decision was about the right to privacy and due process. So the holding would be that the statute is unconstitutional because it violates the men's right to privacy under the Due Process Clause.

Looking at the options, option G says it's unconstitutional because it infringes on liberty under substantive due process. That matches. Alternatively, option B is about the Ninth Amendment, but I think the main reasoning was the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which is about substantive due process, so option G is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the Ninth Amendment states that the enumeration of certain rights doesn't deny others retained by the people. In the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, the right to privacy was found using the Ninth Amendment among others. But in Lawrence, the majority opinion focused more on the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically substantive due process, rather than the Ninth. So option G is the better choice.

So the correct answer should be G.

The question involves a scenario similar to the landmark case *Lawrence v. Texas (2003)*, where the Supreme Court struck down a state law criminalizing consensual same-sex sodomy. The Court held that such laws violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects the liberty of individuals to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct. The majority opinion emphasized the right to privacy and personal autonomy, concluding that moral disapproval alone is insufficient to justify intruding on this protected liberty.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The Court in *Lawrence* interfered with state regulation, rejecting the argument that states can regulate sexual morality without constitutional limits.  
- **B**: Incorrect. While the Ninth Amendment protects unenumerated rights, the primary holding in *Lawrence* relied on substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, not the Ninth Amendment.  
- **C**: Incorrect. Although equal protection could be a plausible argument, the *Lawrence* decision focused on the Due Process Clause, not equal protection.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The case does not involve freedom of expression, as it pertains to sexual conduct, not speech.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The Court explicitly held that private, consensual sexual relations are protected by the right to privacy.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The Court rejected the idea that promoting the common good through moral regulation justifies infringing on individual liberty.  
- **G**: Correct. The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes on the men's right to liberty under the Due Process Clause, as established in *Lawrence*.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Laws based solely on religious principles without a secular purpose are not constitutionally valid.  
- **I**: Incorrect. The issue is not about cruel and unusual punishment but the constitutionality of the law itself.  
- **J**: Incorrect. While states have police power, the Court ruled that moral disapproval alone does not suffice to criminalize private conduct.  

The correct answer is **G**, as the Supreme Court would likely hold that the statute violates the men's right to liberty under the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process. 

Answer: G
