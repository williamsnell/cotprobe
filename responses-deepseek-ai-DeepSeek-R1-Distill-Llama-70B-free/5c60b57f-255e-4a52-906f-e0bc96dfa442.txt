Question:

Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don’t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?
1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.
2. An attacker impersonating the server.

Options:

A: True, True
B: True for the first attack, but only if the server leaks its keys
C: True, True for both attacks but only if the client provides a client certificate
D: True for the first attack, False for the second attack
E: False, False for both attacks
F: False, False
G: False for the first attack, but True for the second attack if the cryptography is not good
H: False, True
I: True, False
J: False for the first attack, True for the second attack

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this TLS question. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that a TLS connection has been successfully established between a client and a server. They checked the server certificate and did a Diffie-Hellman exchange. But the client didn't provide a certificate, so mutual authentication isn't happening here. Also, both client and server are honest, don't leak keys, and the crypto is good.

The question is asking which attacks TLS protects against in this scenario. The two options are:

1. An attacker replaying bytes the client sent earlier.
2. An attacker impersonating the server.

I need to figure out whether TLS thwarts each of these attacks.

First, I remember that TLS provides several security features. Let me break it down.

Starting with the first attack: replaying bytes. TLS uses a feature called a message authentication code (MAC) to ensure the integrity of each message. Each message is tagged with a MAC, which is based on a shared secret known only to the client and server. So if an attacker tries to replay a message, the MAC won't match because the attacker doesn't know the secret. Therefore, the receiver (client or server) can detect that the message is a replay and reject it. So TLS should protect against replay attacks. So the first statement should be true.

Now, the second attack: impersonating the server. In TLS, the server presents a certificate which the client verifies. The certificate is issued by a trusted CA, so as long as the client checks it properly, it can trust that the server is who it claims to be. Since the scenario says the server's certificate was checked, the client can be confident it's talking to the real server, not an impersonator. So TLS does protect against server impersonation. Wait, but wait—what about mutual authentication? No, the client didn't provide a certificate, so mutual auth isn't in place, but server auth is done through the certificate. So the attacker can't impersonate the server because they can't present a valid certificate. Therefore, the second statement is also true.

Wait, but looking back, the question says, "which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?" So both attacks are things TLS stops.

But wait, let me think again. The server's certificate was checked. So the client knows it's the real server. So an attacker can't impersonate the server because they can't get a valid certificate. So the second attack, impersonation, is prevented. So both 1 and 2 are true.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is "True, True." Option C says both true only if client provides a certificate. But in this scenario, the client didn't, so mutual auth isn't done. But server auth was done. So the server's identity is verified, so the server can't be impersonated. So for the second attack, TLS does protect against it.

Wait, but what if the attacker is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) who tries to impersonate the server? Without client certificates, the MITM would need to have a valid server certificate. But in this scenario, the server's certificate was checked, so MITM can't present a valid one unless they compromise the CA or the server's private key. But the question states that the server doesn't leak keys, so MITM can’t get the private key. So TLS does protect against server impersonation here.

Therefore, both 1 and 2 are protected against. So the correct answer would be A: True, True.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another thought: replay attacks are prevented because each TLS record has a unique sequence number and a MAC. So even if the attacker replays, the MAC would be wrong because the session key is known only to client and server.

So yes, both 1 and 2 are protected. So the answer is A.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: True, True.

But let me check the other options. Option D is True for the first, False for the second. So why would that be?

Wait, could there be a case where the server can be impersonated? For example, if the client didn't check the server's certificate properly, but the question says the server certificate was checked. So that's not the case here.

Hmm, so I think A is correct. But wait, some sources say that without client certificates, mutual authentication isn't done, but the server is still authenticated via the certificate. So the second attack (impersonating the server) is prevented.

So yes, both are true. So the answer should be A.

TLS provides protection against both replay attacks and server impersonation in this scenario. 

1. **Replay Attack Protection**: TLS uses message authentication codes (MACs) based on a shared secret known only to the client and server. This ensures that replayed messages can be detected and rejected, as the MAC will not match without the shared secret.

2. **Server Impersonation Protection**: The server presents a certificate signed by a trusted CA, which the client verifies. Since the server’s certificate was checked and the server does not leak its keys, an attacker cannot impersonate the server by presenting a valid certificate. This ensures the client is communicating with the actual server.

Given that both protections are in place, the correct answer is:

**A: True, True**
