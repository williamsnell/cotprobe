Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the inverse z-transform of a function F(z) using partial fraction expansion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on z-transforms, but let me try to think this through.

The function given is F(z) = (2z² - 2z) / [(z - 3)(z - 5)²]. Right, partial fractions involve breaking this down into simpler fractions that are easier to take the inverse z-transform of.

First, I know that the denominator factors are (z-3) and (z-5) squared. So, the partial fraction expansion should look like A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)². Wait, because (z-5) is squared, I need two terms for that.

So, let's set up the equation: (2z² - 2z) / [(z-3)(z-5)^2] = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

To find A, B, and C, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator (z-3)(z-5)^2 to get rid of the fractions. That leaves me with:

2z² - 2z = A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3).

Now, I need to find the values of A, B, and C. Maybe I can plug in specific values of z that simplify the equation.

Let me try z = 3 first. Plugging that in, the left side becomes 2*(3)^2 - 2*(3) = 18 -6 =12.

On the right side, when z=3, (3-5)^2 becomes ( -2 )^2 =4, so A*4. The other terms have (z-3) which becomes zero, so they vanish. So 4A =12 → A=3. Ok, got A.

Next, let me try z=5. Then the left side is 2*(5)^2 -2*5 =50 -10=40.

On the right side, when z=5, (5-5) terms vanish except for C*(5-3)=2C. So 2C =40 → C=20. Wait, that seems a bit high, but okay.

Wait, let me double-check that. Because when z=5, the equation becomes 40 = A*(0)^2 + B*(2)*(0) + C*(2). So 2C=40 → C=20. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, I have A=3 and C=20. I need to find B. Hmm, maybe I can choose another value for z, say z=0, and plug in the known values of A and C.

Plugging z=0 into the equation:

Left side: 2*(0)^2 -2*(0)=0.

Right side: 3*(0-5)^2 + B*(0-3)(0-5) +20*(0-3).

Compute each term:

3*(25) =75.

B*(-3)*(-5)=15B.

20*(-3)= -60.

So, 75 +15B -60 =0 → (75-60) +15B =0 →15 +15B=0 → B= -1.

Wait, that can't be right because 15B= -15 → B= -1. Hmm, that seems okay.

Wait, let me check with another value of z to make sure. Let's try z=1.

Left side: 2*(1)^2 -2*1 =2-2=0.

Right side: 3*(-4)^2 + B*(-2)(-4) +20*(-2).

Which is 3*(16)=48, B*(8)=8B, 20*(-2)=-40.

So 48 +8B -40 =0 → 8 +8B=0 → 8B= -8 → B= -1. Yep, same result.

So, A=3, B=-1, C=20.

So the partial fractions are 3/(z-3) -1/(z-5) +20/(z-5)^2.

Now, I need to find the inverse z-transform of each term. I remember that the inverse z-transform of 1/(z-a) is a^n u[n], right? And for 1/(z-a)^2, it's n a^{n-1} u[n], but wait, I might have to double-check that.

Wait, the standard form for the inverse z-transform is:

- Z^{-1} [1/(z - a)] = a^n u[n]
- Z^{-1} [1/(z - a)^2] = n a^{n-1} u[n]

Wait, but sometimes the form is written with (n+1) terms, but I think that's correct.

So, let's compute each term:

1. Term 3/(z-3): inverse is 3 * 3^n u[n] = 3^{n+1} u[n].

Wait, no. Because 3/(z-3) is 3 * [1/(z-3)], so inverse is 3 * 3^n u[n] = 3^{n+1} u[n]. Or, 3^{n} *3 =3^{n+1}.

2. Term -1/(z-5): inverse is -5^n u[n].

3. Term 20/(z-5)^2: inverse is 20 * n *5^{n-1} u[n]. Let's compute this.

20 * n *5^{n-1} = (20/5) * n *5^n → 4n 5^n.

Wait, 20/5 is 4, so 4n 5^n u[n].

Putting it all together, the inverse z-transform f[n] is:

3^{n+1} u[n] -5^n u[n] +4n5^n u[n].

Hmm, let me factor terms. The terms with 5^n can be combined.

So, f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n] + (4n -1)5^n u[n].

Wait, because -5^n +4n5^n =5^n (4n -1).

Looking at the options, let's check which one matches this.

Option A: 4n u[n] + [(5/6)n -1]6^n u[n] → nope.

Option B:6n u[n] + [...] 3^n → nope.

Option C:3^{n+1}u[n] -5^n u[n] → but we have 4n5^n added, which isn't here. So C isn't correct.

Option D:3n u[n] + [(4/5)n -1]5^n. Hmm, that's 3n and terms with 5^n, but in our case, the 3^{n+1} is a separate term. So D doesn't match.

Option E: [(2/3)n +1](3/2)^n -2^{n-1}. Doesn't match.

Option F:3n u[n] + [(5/4)n -1] (4/5)^n → nope.

Option G:4n u[n] + [(7/8)n -2]8^n → nope.

Option H:2n u[n] + [(3/5)n -1]4^n → nope.

Option I:5n u[n] + [(6/7)n -1]7^n → nope.

Option J:2^n u[n] + [(3/4)n +1](4/3)^n → nope.

Wait, none of the options exactly match what I have. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, let me go back. The original F(z) is (2z² -2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2]. When I set up the partial fractions, I assumed it was A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2. Then multiplied through to get 2z² -2z = A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3).

When I plugged in z=3, I got 12=4A → A=3. Correct.

z=5: 40=2C → C=20. Correct.

Then for B, I used z=0 and got -1, and z=1 also gave B=-1.

So the partial fractions are correct.

Wait, but the inverse z-transform of 3/(z-3) is 3^{n+1} u[n], because 3/(z-3) is 3 * [1/(z-3)] → inverse is 3*3^n =3^{n+1}.

Similarly, the term -1/(z-5) is -5^n u[n].

The term 20/(z-5)^2 → 20 * n 5^{n-1} u[n] = (20/5) n5^n =4n5^n.

So the total is 3^{n+1}u[n] -5^n u[n] +4n5^n u[n] =3^{n+1} u[n] + (4n -1)5^n u[n].

Looking at the options again, let's see if any match this structure.

Looking at option A: 4n u[n] + [...] 6^n → no.

Option D:3n u[n] + (4/5 n -1)5^n. Hmm, but our first term is 3^{n+1}, which is 3*3^n. None of the options have 3^{n+1} as a term.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the inverse z-transforms. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the inverse z-transform of A/(z - a) is A a^n u[n], correct. So 3/(z-3) would be 3 * 3^n u[n] =3^{n+1} u[n]. That seems right.

Similarly, 20/(z-5)^2: the inverse is 20 * n (5^{n-1}) u[n] → 20 *n *5^{n-1} = (20/5) n 5^n =4n5^n u[n]. That's correct.

So the combined function is 3^{n+1}u[n] +4n5^n u[n] -5^n u[n].

Hmm, combining the 5^n terms: (4n -1)5^n.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this as 5^n (4n -1) +3^{n+1}.

Looking back at the options, perhaps none match exactly. Wait, let me check option D again.

Option D: f[n] =3n u[n] + [(4/5)n -1]5^n u[n].

Wait, that would be 3n u[n] + (4/5 n -1)5^n =3n u[n] +4n 5^{n-1} -5^n.

Hmm, that's different from what I have.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, let's re-examine the partial fraction setup. Maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, when I set up 2z² -2z =A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5)+C(z-3).

Wait, maybe I should expand the right-hand side.

Let me expand each term:

A(z-5)^2 = A(z² -10z +25).

B(z-3)(z-5)= B(z² -8z +15).

C(z-3) = Cz -3C.

So the right-hand side becomes:

A z² -10A z +25A + B z² -8B z +15B + C z -3C.

Combine like terms:

(A + B) z² + (-10A -8B + C) z + (25A +15B -3C).

This should equal the left-hand side, which is 2z² -2z +0.

So, equate coefficients:

1. Coefficient of z²: A + B = 2.

2. Coefficient of z: -10A -8B + C = -2.

3. Constant term:25A +15B -3C =0.

We already found A=3, B=-1, C=20. Let's plug into equation 1: 3 + (-1)=2 → 2=2. Correct.

Equation 2: -10*3 -8*(-1) +20 =-30 +8 +20= -2 → correct.

Equation3:25*3 +15*(-1) -3*20=75-15-60=0. Correct.

So partial fractions are correct.

Hmm, so I think my inverse z-transform is correct. But none of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse of 20/(z-5)^2.

Wait, the inverse z-transform of 1/(z - a)^2 is n a^{n-1} u[n]. So 20/(z-5)^2 → 20 *n *5^{n-1} u[n] = (20/5) n 5^n =4n5^n u[n]. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should factor the 5^n terms.

So, f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n] + (4n -1)5^n u[n].

Looking for this structure in the options.

Option A: 4n u[n] + [(5/6)n -1]6^n → No.

Option B:6n u[n] + [...] 3^n → No.

Option C:3^{n+1}u[n] -5^n u[n] → Only, but we have 4n5^n added. So C is missing that term.

Option D:3n u[n] + [(4/5)n -1]5^n → 3n is separate, but in our case, the 3^{n+1} is a separate term. So D is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the inverse z-transform of the first term.

Wait, the term is 3/(z-3). So, the inverse is 3 * 3^n u[n] =3^{n+1} u[n]. That's correct.

Hmm, wait, looking at option E: [(2/3)n +1] (3/2)^n -2^{n-1} u[n]. Doesn't match.

Option F:3n u[n] + [(5/4)n -1](4/5)^n → No.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the terms 3^{n+1} and 5^n.

Looking back, option C is 3^{n+1}u[n] -5^n u[n]. But we have an additional 4n5^n.

So none of the options match exactly. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the answer.

Our f[n] is:

3^{n+1} u[n] +4n5^n u[n] -5^n u[n].

Which can be written as 3^{n+1}u[n] +5^n (4n -1) u[n].

Looking at the options:

Option D:3n u[n] + [(4/5 n) -1]5^n u[n].

Which would expand to 3n u[n] + (4/5 n *5^n) -5^n u[n] → 3n +4n5^{n-1} -5^n.

Hmm, that's different from our expression, which is 3^{n+1} + (4n -1)5^n.

Wait, perhaps I should consider combining terms differently. Maybe the 3/(z-3) term can be expressed differently.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should look for a term like 3^{n} multiplied by 3, which is 3^{n+1}, but none of the options have that except option C, which doesn't include the 4n5^n term.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction coefficients.

Wait, when I setup the equation for B, after plugging in A=3 and C=20, perhaps I should recheck.

Wait, when I plugged in z=0 into 2z² -2z = A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3).

So at z=0:

Left side: 0.

Right side: 3*(25) + B*(-3)(-5) +20*(-3) → 75 +15B -60=15+15B=0 →15B= -15 → B=-1.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inverse z-transform of 3/(z-3). Let me think again.

Wait, the standard inverse z-transform of X(z) = 1/(z-a) is a^n u[n].

So, if X(z) = K/(z-a), then inverse is K a^n u[n].

So, 3/(z-3) → 3 *3^n u[n]=3^{n+1} u[n].

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the answer in a different form.

Our f[n] is 3^{n+1}u[n] + (4n -1)5^n u[n].

Can this be rewritten as 3*3^n u[n] +4n5^n u[n] -5^n u[n].

Hmm, 3*3^n is 3^{n+1}, correct.

Wait, perhaps factor 5^n terms:

=3^{n+1}u[n] +5^n (4n -1) u[n].

Looking at the options, perhaps none match, but let's check option D again.

Option D: f[n] =3n u[n] + [(4/5) n -1]5^n u[n].

Wait, [(4/5)n -1]5^n = (4n/5 -1)5^n =4n5^{n-1} -5^n.

So the function is 3n u[n] +4n5^{n-1}u[n] -5^n u[n}.

That's different from our expression, which has 3^{n+1} and 4n5^n.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for an option where the terms are 3^{n+1} and something with 5^n.

Looking again, option C has 3^{n+1}u[n]
