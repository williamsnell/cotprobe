Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about AP Psychology, specifically about a final exam's content and what it's lacking. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that the exam only covers motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior units. So it's missing other units from the AP Psychology curriculum. The question is asking what kind of validity or reliability this exam lacks.

First, I remember that in psychometrics, there are different types of validity and reliability. Let me go through each option to figure this out.

Option A: Alternate-forms reliability. That's about whether two different versions of a test measure the same thing. If the exam is only covering certain units, I'm not sure this is the issue. It's more about consistency across different forms, not content coverage.

Option B: Concurrent validity. This is when a test's results are compared to another measure taken at the same time. Again, not directly about the content coverage of the test itself.

Option C: Content validity. Oh right, content validity refers to whether the test adequately covers the entire range of topics that it's supposed to. Since the exam only includes three units, it's missing other important areas like cognition, development, or clinical psychology. So this might be the answer.

Option D: Internal consistency reliability. That's about how well the items within the test measure the same thing. If the test is consistent within itself, that's different from whether it covers all necessary content.

Option E: Predictive validity. This is about whether the test can predict future performance, like how well a test score correlates with job success. Not related to the content coverage.

Option F: Criterion validity. This includes concurrent and predictive validity, so same as above.

Option G: Test-retest reliability. This measures if the test gives consistent results over time. Again, not about content coverage.

Option H: Split-half reliability. Another measure of internal consistency, where the test is split into two parts and checked for consistency. Not about content.

Option I: Face validity. This is whether the test appears to measure what it's supposed to, but it's not a formal type of validity. An example might be if a flying test requires actually flying, which makes sense. But the test might not actually be valid, it just looks that way. But in this case, the content isn't covering all areas, so maybe it's lacking face validity? Or is it more about content validity?

Option J: Construct validity. This is about whether the test measures the theoretical construct it's supposed to. If the exam doesn't cover all necessary topics, it might not measure the full construct of AP Psychology. But I think content validity is the more direct issue here.

Wait, content validity is specifically about the test covering all the content it's supposed to. Since the exam is missing several units, it's lacking content validity. So the answer should be C.

Another thought: the question is about a comprehensive exam, which implies it should cover all the units. By omitting some, the content validity is lacking because the exam doesn't adequately represent the entire curriculum.

The question concerns a comprehensive final examination in AP Psychology that only covers motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior units. The issue lies in what the exam lacks. The key concept here is **content validity**, which refers to whether a test adequately covers the full range of topics it is supposed to measure. Since the exam excludes other important units of the AP Psychology curriculum, such as cognition, development, and clinical psychology, it lacks content validity. Other forms of validity and reliability, such as internal consistency, predictive validity, or face validity, are not directly relevant to the problem of incomplete content coverage.

Answer: C
