Okay, so I've got this question here about a database that a footwear retailer uses. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The database has records for each item, and each record includes: item ID, footwear type, selling price, size, color, and quantity available. The question is asking which of the options A to E can be determined using only this database.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Which items listed in the database are not currently in the store. Hmm. Well, the database has a field for quantity available. If that number is zero, it would mean the item isn't in stock. So I guess you could use the quantity to determine which items aren't available. But wait, the question says "not currently in the store." So maybe if the quantity is zero, they're not there. So A might be possible.

Option B: Which type of footwear is most popular among adults. Hmm. The database doesn't have any information about who bought the shoes—like age or gender. It just has type, price, size, color, and quantity. So determining popularity among adults would require knowing sales data for adults, which isn't in the database. So I don't think B is possible.

Option C: The total profit made from selling a particular type of footwear. Profit usually depends on sales, cost, and maybe other factors. The database has selling price and quantity available, but it doesn't say anything about how many were sold or the cost price. So without knowing how many were sold or the cost, you can't calculate profit. So C might not be possible.

Option D: Which colors are more popular among men than women. Again, the database doesn't track gender of buyers. It just has color. So without knowing who bought which color, you can't compare popularity between men and women. So D isn't possible.

Option E: The total number of shoes sold in a particular month. The database has quantity available, but that's the stock, not the sales. Unless there's a way to track sales over time, like a sales record, but the database described doesn't include sales data. So E probably isn't possible either.

So reviewing the options, the only one that seems possible is A, because the quantity available can indicate if an item isn't in the store (quantity zero). But wait, what if an item is in the store but just not in the database? No, the question says it's a single database with all items for sale. So if an item is in the database but quantity is zero, it's not in the store. So yes, A can be determined.

Wait, but the question is about which items are not in the store. So if the database includes all items, including those not in stock, then yes, you can determine which are not available. So the answer should be A.

The database contains information about each footwear item, including quantity available. By checking the quantity, one can determine which items are not currently in stock (quantity = 0), implying they are not in the store. Other options require additional data not present in the database, such as sales data or customer demographics.

Answer: A
