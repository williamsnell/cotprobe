Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about freezing point depression and finding the molar mass of a solute. I remember that freezing point depression is a colligative property, which depends on the number of solute particles in a solution. The formula I think is ΔT = Kf * m, where ΔT is the change in freezing point, Kf is the molal freezing point constant, and m is the molality of the solution.

So the problem gives me the solution's freezing point as -1.92°C. Pure benzene freezes at 5.50°C. I need to find the molar mass of the solute. Let's jot down the given data:

Mass of benzene (solvent) = 150 grams
Mass of solute = 25.1 grams
Freezing point of solution = -1.92°C
Pure benzene freezing point = 5.50°C
Kf (molal freezing point constant) = 5.10°C·kg/mol

Wait, first I should calculate the change in freezing point, ΔT. That's the difference between the pure solvent's freezing point and the solution's. So ΔT = T_pure - T_solution. Let me plug in the numbers: 5.50°C - (-1.92°C) equals 5.50 + 1.92, which is 7.42°C. So ΔT is 7.42°C.

Using the formula ΔT = Kf * m, I can solve for m (molality). Rearranging the formula, m = ΔT / Kf. So m is 7.42°C divided by 5.10°C·kg/mol. Let me calculate that: 7.42 / 5.10 ≈ 1.454 mol/kg. So the molality is approximately 1.454 m.

Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So to find moles of solute, I multiply molality by the kg of solvent. The mass of benzene is 150 grams, which is 0.150 kg. Moles of solute = m * kg of solvent = 1.454 mol/kg * 0.150 kg ≈ 0.2181 moles.

Wait wait, no, wait. No, that doesn't seem right. Because molality is moles per kg. Oh wait, no, the formula is correct. So if I have 1.454 moles per kg of solvent, and I have 0.150 kg of solvent, then the moles would be 1.454 * 0.150. Let me compute that: 1.454 * 0.15 is approximately 0.2181 moles. Right, that's correct.

But wait, the mass of the solute is 25.1 grams. So the molar mass (M) is mass/moles. So M = mass of solute / moles. Mass is 25.1 grams, moles are 0.2181. So M = 25.1 / 0.2181 ≈ let's calculate that.

25.1 divided by 0.2181. Let me do this division. 0.2181 times 115 is approximately 25.1, because 0.2181 * 100 = 21.81, 0.2181 * 15 is about 3.27, so 21.81 +3.27=25.08. So 0.2181 * 115 ≈25.08, which is close to 25.1. So the molar mass is approximately 115 g/mol.

Looking at the options:

I: 115 g/mol. So option I.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes. Let's go step by step again.

ΔT is 5.50 - (-1.92) = 7.42. Right.

m = ΔT / Kf = 7.42 /5.10. Let me compute that accurately. 5.10 *1.45 is 5.10*1=5.10, 5.10*0.45=2.295. So 5.10 +2.295=7.395. So 5.10 *1.45=7.395, which is just a bit less than 7.42. The difference is 7.42-7.395=0.025. So how much more? 0.025 /5.10 per 1. So 0.025/5.10≈0.0049. So m≈1.4549 ≈1.455 mol/kg.

Moles of solute = m * kg of solvent. Solvent is 150g=0.15kg. So 1.455 *0.15 = ?

1.455 *0.15. Let's compute: 1 *0.15=0.15, 0.455 *0.15=0.06825. Sum is 0.15 +0.06825=0.21825 moles.

Mass of solute is 25.1g. So M=25.1 /0.21825 ≈ let me compute.

Divide 25.1 by 0.21825. Let me think in terms of 25.1 / 0.21825.

Approximating, 0.21825 is about 0.218, and 25.1 /0.218.

Let me write it as 25.1 /0.218 → multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 25100 / 218 ≈ Let's compute 218 * 115 = ?

218 *100=21800, 218*15=3270. 21800+3270=25070. So 218*115=25070. 25100 -25070=30. So 25100 is 30 more than 218*115. So 30/218 ≈0.1377. So 115 +0.1377 ≈115.1377. So M≈115.14 g/mol.

So the molar mass is approximately 115 g/mol, which matches option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Another way: 0.21825 moles for 25.1 grams.

25.1 g / 0.21825 mol = M.

25.1 ÷ 0.21825 → let's compute it.

0.21825 * 115 = ?

0.2 *115=23, 0.01825 *115=2.09875. So 23 +2.09875=25.09875. So 0.21825 *115≈25.09875, which is very close to 25.1. So M≈115.

Therefore, the correct answer is option I: 115 g solute/mole solute.

To determine the approximate molar weight of the solute, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T = K_f \cdot m
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in freezing point,
- \(K_f\) is the molal freezing point constant,
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution.

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta T\)
The freezing point of pure benzene is \(5.50^\circ \text{C}\), and the freezing point of the solution is \(-1.92^\circ \text{C}\). Thus:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{pure}} - T_{\text{solution}} = 5.50 - (-1.92) = 7.42^\circ \text{C}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for molality (\(m\))
Rearranging the formula:

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T}{K_f}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
m = \frac{7.42}{5.10} \approx 1.454 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate moles of solute
Molality is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The mass of benzene (solvent) is \(150 \, \text{g} = 0.150 \, \text{kg}\). Thus:

\[
\text{Moles of solute} = m \cdot \text{kg of solvent} = 1.454 \cdot 0.150 \approx 0.2181 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate molar mass of solute
The mass of the solute is \(25.1 \, \text{g}\). Molar mass (\(M\)) is given by:

\[
M = \frac{\text{Mass of solute}}{\text{Moles of solute}} = \frac{25.1}{0.2181} \approx 115 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The approximate molar weight of the solute is \(115 \, \text{g/mol}\), which corresponds to option **I**.
