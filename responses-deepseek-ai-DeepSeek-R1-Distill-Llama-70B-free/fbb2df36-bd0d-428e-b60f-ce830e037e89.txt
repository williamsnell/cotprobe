Question:

A defendant was booked on a commercial airline flight. When the defendant arrived at the airport, two undercover police narcotics agents observed him. His appearance and actions led the police to believe that he fit the description of a predetermined profile of a drug courier. The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.
B: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics.
C: denied, because the search was conducted with the help of a narcotics detection dog.
D: denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.
E: granted, because the police did not have the right to prevent the defendant from boarding the plane.
F: denied, because the defendant voluntarily handed over his bag to the police.
G: denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.
H: granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with searches and seizures. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant who was booked on a commercial flight. At the airport, two undercover police narcotics agents observed him. They thought he fit a drug courier profile. They approached him, told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. He asked why, and they explained they were narcotics agents and he fit the profile. Then they asked for his overnight bag, but he refused. The officers then said he wouldn't be allowed to board the plane unless they inspected the bag. The defendant decided not to fly and told the officers he changed his mind. The officers still asked for the bag, he handed it over, and then he was allowed to leave. The next day, a dog sniffed the bag, indicated narcotics, so they opened it and found heroin. Now, the defendant is charged and his attorney is moving to suppress the evidence.

The question is whether the motion will be granted or denied, and why.

I remember that in airport stops, the courts have dealt with the drug courier profile. There's a case, Florida v. Royer, I think. In that case, the Supreme Court said that police can stop someone if they have reasonable suspicion, but they can't detain them longer than necessary or under circumstances that are more intrusive than necessary. So, if the officers have reasonable suspicion, they can make a brief stop, but if they want to do more, like a search, they might need probable cause or consent.

In this case, the officers approached the defendant based on a profile. They had reasonable suspicion because he fit the profile. So, they can detain him for questioning. But when they asked for his bag, he refused. Then they told him he couldn't board unless they inspected the bag. He then decided not to fly, gave the bag to them, and left.

Wait, so did the defendant consent to handing over the bag? Or was he coerced? Because the officers said he couldn't board unless they inspected. That sounds like a conditionâ€”they're essentially saying you can't fly unless you let us search. I think that could be seen as a Fourth Amendment issue because they're conditioning his right to travel on giving up his bag. The Supreme Court in the Royer case said that such tactics can turn a consensual encounter into a seizure, especially if the person feels they're not free to leave.

So, when the defendant gave the bag, was it voluntary? The fact that the officers told him he couldn't board might have made him feel compelled. So maybe the handover wasn't voluntary, making the search invalid.

Another point is that the police didn't search the bag right away. They kept it overnight and did a dog sniff the next day. The dog sniff is generally not considered a search under the Fourth Amendment because dogs don't invade privacy (see United States v. Place). So, the sniff itself might be okay without a warrant if they have reasonable suspicion. But the issue is whether they lawfully obtained the bag in the first place.

So, the key here is whether the police had the right to take the bag. If the detention was unlawful, then the evidence is suppressed. Also, if the defendant was effectively forced to hand over the bag under the threat of not being allowed to fly, that might be considered a seizure without probable cause.

Wait, but in the scenario, after the defendant decided not to fly, the officers still asked for the bag. So he gave it to them, and then he was allowed to leave. So, the question is whether the police had the authority to retain the bag after he decided not to fly. If he's not flying, maybe they don't have a reason to hold the bag anymore. But he gave it to them, so perhaps it's considered abandoned? Or was the initial taking of the bag a seizure that required reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

In Royer, the court held that the officers could ask for the luggage as part of the stop, but when the suspect refused, they couldn't retain the luggage without probable cause. So, in this case, the defendant initially refused, but then gave the bag after deciding not to fly. So was the retention of the bag lawful?

If the police didn't have probable cause at the time they took the bag, then holding it overnight might be a problem. They only had reasonable suspicion initially, which might not be enough to seize the bag without consent.

So, the next day, the dog sniff led to probable cause, but the initial seizure of the bag might have been unlawful because they didn't have probable cause at the time. Therefore, the evidence would be suppressed because it's fruit of the poisonous tree.

Looking at the options:

Option A: granted, because no probable cause to hold the bag. This could be correct because without probable cause, holding the bag was unlawful.

Option B: denied, because reasonable suspicion. But reasonable suspicion allows for a stop, not necessarily seizure of property without consent.

Option E: granted, because police couldn't prevent boarding. That's about conditioning the right to fly, which might tie into the coercion aspect, making the consent invalid.

Option F: denied, because defendant handed it over. But if the handover was under duress, it's not voluntary.

Option H: granted, because unlawful detention. The initial stop might have been lawful, but the subsequent actions could render the detention unlawful.

So, the crux is whether the police had the right to take the bag. Since they only had reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, holding the bag overnight would be a problem. So the motion to suppress would be granted because they didn't have probable cause when they seized the bag, making the search invalid.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.

The motion to suppress the evidence will most likely be granted because the police did not have probable cause to seize and hold the defendant's bag overnight. While the officers initially had reasonable suspicion based on the drug courier profile to detain the defendant briefly, their actions escalated into a seizure when they conditioned the defendant's ability to board the plane on surrendering his bag. This created a coercive situation, undermining the voluntariness of the defendant's decision to hand over the bag. 

Under the precedent set by *Florida v. Royer*, reasonable suspicion justifies a brief stop but not the seizure of property without consent or probable cause. The police lacked probable cause at the time they took the bag, and holding it overnight was therefore unlawful. Although a dog sniff is not considered a search under the Fourth Amendment, the initial unlawful seizure of the bag taints the subsequent evidence, making it inadmissible as "fruit of the poisonous tree."

Thus, the motion to suppress the evidence will be granted.

A: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.
