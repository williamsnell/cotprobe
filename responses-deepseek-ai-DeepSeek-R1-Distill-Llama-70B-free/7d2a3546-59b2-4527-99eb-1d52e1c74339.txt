Okay, so I've got this question about cognitive distortions as defined by Aaron Beck. Hmm, I remember that cognitive distortions are irrational thought patterns that can contribute to various mental health issues. The question is about Samuel S., who's 43 and just got a bonus at work, but he feels like he's about to be fired. I need to figure out which distortion he's exhibiting.

Let me think about each option one by one. So, the options are from A to I, each a different distortion. I'll try to recall what each one means.

Option A: Polarized thinking. I think this is when someone sees things in extremes, like all good or all bad, with no middle ground. So if Samuel got a bonus, which is a positive, but he's feeling negative about being fired, maybe that's not exactly polarized thinking because he's not necessarily viewing things in black-and-white extremes in that way.

Option B: Magnification. This is when someone blows things out of proportion, making them seem much worse than they are. So maybe if Samuel is taking a minor issue and thinking it's a huge problem, but I'm not sure if that's exactly it here. He got a bonus but fears being fired, so maybe he's taking a positive and turning it into a negative without clear evidence.

Option C: Minimization. This is the opposite of magnification, where someone downplays the significance of an event. But Samuel is worried about being fired despite a bonus, so he's not minimizing his concerns; he's actually amplifying a negative thought.

Option D: Arbitrary inference. I remember this as jumping to a conclusion without evidence. Like when someone assumes the worst without any facts. So Samuel feels he's about to be fired just after getting a bonus, which is a positive indicator. That doesn't make sense, so he's making an assumption without evidence. That sounds like arbitrary inference.

Option E: Overgeneralization. This is when someone takes a single event and applies it too broadly. For example, failing once and thinking they'll always fail. I don't think that's exactly what's happening here. Samuel's situation is more about a single, unfounded fear rather than applying it widely.

Option F: Mustabatory thinking. Wait, I think that's a typo. It should be "musturbatory" or maybe "must thinking," which is when someone believes they "must" or "should" do something. Like, "I must get this perfect." Not sure if that's the case here.

Option G: Mind reading. This is when someone assumes they know what others are thinking. So Samuel might be thinking his boss wants to fire him, so he's assuming his boss's thoughts without evidence. That could fit because he's imagining his employer's intentions without any real indication.

Option H: Selective abstraction. This involves focusing on a single detail while ignoring the bigger picture. For example, if Samuel focuses on a minor setback and ignores all the positives, but in this case, he's focusing on being fired despite a bonus, which is a positive. So maybe he's selectively focusing on the negative thought without considering the evidence.

Option I: Personalization. This is when someone takes things too personally, assuming that events are about them when they're not. So if Samuel thinks the company's actions are all about him, that might fit. But in this case, he's more making an assumption about his job security without evidence.

So, putting it all together, Samuel's statement is about feeling he's going to be fired despite a positive event (bonus). He's making a negative conclusion without evidence. So looking at the options, arbitrary inference (D) and mind reading (G) seem possible.

Arbitrary inference is about making conclusions without evidence. Mind reading is assuming you know others' thoughts. So if Samuel's fear is based on assuming his employer's intention to fire him, that's mind reading. But if it's just a baseless fear without assuming what others think, it's arbitrary inference.

Wait, the question says he feels like he's about to be fired. So is he assuming his employer's intention, or just making a negative conclusion without evidence? I think it's the latter. So arbitrary inference would be the correct answer because he's drawing a negative conclusion without any supporting evidence.

Samuel S. is exhibiting **arbitrary inference**, as defined by Aaron Beck. Arbitrary inference refers to drawing a conclusion without evidence or with insufficient evidence. In this case, Samuel feels he is about to be fired despite receiving a bonus, which is a positive indicator of job security. His fear is based on an unfounded assumption rather than concrete evidence, making arbitrary inference the most fitting cognitive distortion.
