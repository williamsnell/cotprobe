Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of H+ ions in a rat liver mitochondrion's inner compartment. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember. The mitochondrion is cylindrical, right? The problem gives the dimensions: 1.8 microns long and 1.0 micron in diameter. Oh wait, and the pH is 6.0. So I need to find the number of hydrogen ions in that compartment.

First, I think I should calculate the volume of the mitochondrion. Since it's a cylinder, the volume formula is V = πr²h. Oh wait, right, radius is half the diameter. So diameter is 1.0 micron, so radius is 0.5 microns. 

But wait, microns are 1e-6 meters. So converting to meters: radius r = 0.5e-6 m, height h = 1.8e-6 m. 

Calculating the volume: V = π*(0.5e-6)^2 * 1.8e-6. Let me compute that. 

(0.5e-6)^2 is 0.25e-12. Multiply by 1.8e-6 gives 0.25e-12 * 1.8e-6 = 0.45e-18. Multiply by π (approx 3.1416), so V ≈ 1.4137e-18 m³, which is 1.4137 x 10^-18 cubic meters.

Wait, but wait, 1e-6 meters is 1 micron, so 0.5 microns is 0.5e-6 m. Yeah, done that right.

Now, pH is 6.0. pH is the negative log of the H+ concentration. So [H+] = 10^-pH. So 10^-6 is 1e-6 M (moles per liter). 

But wait, the volume is in cubic meters, and concentration is per liter. Oh right, I need to convert volume to liters. 1 m³ is 1e3 liters, wait, no, wait: 1 liter is 0.001 m³, so 1 m³ = 1e3 liters. Wait, no, wait: 1 liter = 1 dm³ = (0.1 m)^3 = 1e-3 m³. So 1 m³ = 1e3 liters. So to convert m³ to liters, multiply by 1e3.

So the volume in liters is 1.4137e-18 m³ * 1e3 L/m³ = 1.4137e-15 L.

So the number of moles of H+ is concentration multiplied by volume. [H+] is 1e-6 M, which is 1e-6 mol/L. So moles = 1e-6 * 1.4137e-15 L = 1.4137e-21 mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because 1e-6 mol/L multiplied by 1.4137e-15 L gives 1.4137e-21 mol. Right.

Then, the number of ions is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is approx 6.022e23 ions/mol. So ions = 1.4137e-21 mol * 6.022e23 ions/mol = 

Let me compute that: 1.4137e-21 * 6.022e23 = (1.4137 * 6.022) * 1e2. 

1.4137 *6 is about 8.482, and 1.4137 *0.022 is about 0.0311. So total approx 8.513. So 8.513 * 1e2 is 851.3. So approximately 851 H+ ions.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's redo the multiplication:

1.4137 * 6.022 = ?

Let me calculate 1.4137 * 6 = 8.4822. 1.4137 * 0.022 = 0.0311114. So sum is 8.4822 + 0.0311114 = 8.5133. So 8.5133. So 8.5133e2 = 851.33.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 843, D:950, J:820. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the volume calculation. I think I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's go back. The radius is 0.5e-6 m, so r squared is (0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m². Multiply by height 1.8e-6 m: 0.25e-12 *1.8e-6 = 0.45e-18 m³. Multiply by π gives approximately 1.4137e-18 m³, which is correct.

Then, volume in liters: 1.4137e-18 m³ * 1e3 L/m³ = 1.4137e-15 L. Correct.

Concentration of H+ is 1e-6 M, which is 1e-6 mol/L. So moles H+ = 1e-6 * 1.4137e-15 = 1.4137e-21 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 1.4137e-21 * 6.022e23 = (1.4137 *6.022) *1e2 = approx 8.51e2, so 851.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:843, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value more precisely.

Let me compute 1.4137e-18 m³ exactly. Wait, let me recompute the volume:

r = 0.5e-6 m, so r squared is (0.5)^2=0.25, times (e-6)^2 = e-12. So 0.25e-12 * 1.8e-6 (height) = 0.45e-18 m³. Multiply by π (3.14159265) gives 0.45 *3.14159265 = 1.41378295e-18 m³.

So volume is 1.41378295e-18 m³. Convert to liters: 1.41378295e-18 m³ * (1 L / 0.001 m³) )= 1.41378295e-15 L.

Now, [H+] is 1e-6 M, so moles = 1e-6 * 1.41378295e-15 = 1.41378295e-21 mol.

Avogadro's number is 6.02214076e23.

So number of ions = 1.41378295e-21 *6.02214076e23 = 

Let me compute that:

1.41378295e-21 *6.02214076e23 = (1.41378295 *6.02214076) *1e2

Compute 1.41378295 *6.02214076:

1.41378295 * 6 = 8.4826977
1.41378295 * 0.02214076 ≈ let's compute 1.41378295 *0.02 = 0.0282756, 1.41378295 *0.00214076≈ ~0.003023. So total ≈ 0.0282756 + 0.003023 ≈ 0.0312986.

So total is approximately 8.4826977 + 0.0312986 ≈ 8.513996.

So 8.513996e2 = 851.3996 ≈ 851.4.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match 851. The closest is option C:843 and J:820, but wait, looking again:

Wait, the options are:

A:1000

B:900

C:843

D:950

E:615

F:760

G:880

H:700

I:675

J:820

So 851 is closest to option C:843, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, another thought: The shape is cylindrical. But wait, mitochondria have an inner membrane that's folded into cristae, which increases the surface area. However, the problem states it's a cylinder, so I think we can ignore that and treat it as a simple cylinder.

Wait, but wait, am I sure about the formula for the volume of a cylinder? Yes, V = π r² h.

Wait, perhaps the pH is 6.0, so [H+] is 1e-6 M.

Wait, another thought: Did I correctly convert the volume from m³ to liters? 1 m³ = 1e3 liters, correct. So 1.4137e-18 m³ * 1e3 L/m³ = 1.4137e-15 L. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should check the initial calculation again. Let me recompute 1.41378295e-21 * 6.02214076e23.

Compute 1.41378295 *6.02214076:

1.41378295 * 6 = 8.4826977

1.41378295 * 0.02214076:

Compute 1.41378295 *0.02 = 0.02827569

1.41378295 *0.00214076 = let's compute 1.41378295 * 0.002=0.002827568, and 1.41378295 *0.00014076≈ approx 0.0001988.

So 0.002827568 + 0.0001988 ≈ 0.003026368.

So 0.02827569 + 0.003026368 = 0.031302058.

So 8.4826977 + 0.031302058 = 8.51399976.

Multiply by 1e2 gives 851.399976 ≈ 851.

So the number is approximately 851.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option C:843, but that's 8 less. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the volume is wrong. Let me recompute the volume.

Radius is 0.5 microns = 0.5e-6 m.

Height is 1.8 microns = 1.8e-6 m.

Volume V = π * (0.5e-6)^2 * 1.8e-6.

Compute (0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m².

Multiply by 1.8e-6 m: 0.25e-12 *1.8e-6 = 0.45e-18 m³.

π is 3.14159265, so 0.45e-18 *3.14159265 = 1.41378e-18 m³.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem uses 1e-6 as the concentration, but maybe the actual formula for [H+] is 10^(-pH), correct. So at pH 6, 1e-6 M.

So, perhaps I should check the exponent again. Another way: number of H+ is [H+] (in ions per m³) multiplied by volume (m³).

[H+] is 1e-6 M = 1e-6 mol/L. Wait, 1 L is 0.001 m³, so 1e-6 mol/L = 1e-6 / 0.001 mol/m³ = 1e-3 mol/m³.

Wait, wait, let me think. Concentration in mol/m³.

Yes, because 1 L = 0.001 m³, so 1 M = 1 mol/L = 1 mol / 0.001 m³ = 1e3 mol/m³.

But wait, the [H+] is 1e-6 M, which is 1e-6 mol/L. So in mol/m³, that's 1e-6 * 1e3 = 1e-3 mol/m³.

Wait, no, wait: 1 M = 1 mol/dm³ = 1 mol/(0.1 m)^3 = 1e6 mol/m³.

Wait, no, wait: 1 m³ = (10 dm)^3 = 1000 liters. So 1 mol/m³ = 0.001 mol/L. So 1 M = 1 mol/L = 1e3 mol/m³.

Wait, so [H+] = 1e-6 M = 1e-6 mol/L = 1e-6 * 1e3 mol/m³ = 1e-3 mol/m³.

So [H+] is 1e-3 mol/m³.

So number of H+ ions is [H+] (mol/m³) * volume (m³) * Avogadro's number.

So:

Number = 1e-3 mol/m³ * 1.41378e-18 m³ *6.022e23 ions/mol.

Compute that: 1e-3 *1.41378e-18 = 1.41378e-21.

Multiply by 6.022e23: 1.41378e-21 *6.022e23 = same as before, 851.

Hmm. So the calculation seems correct.

But looking at the options, option C is 843, which is close. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different approximation for π. Let me recalculate the volume with π=3 instead of 3.1416.

Wait, if I use π=3, then volume would be 0.45e-18 *3 =1.35e-18 m³.

Then, number of H+ would be 1.35e-18 m³ *1e-3 mol/m³ *6.022e23.

Wait, wait, no. Because [H+] is already in mol/m³, and volume is m³. So:

Number = 1e-3 (mol/m³) * 1.35e-18 m³ = 1.35e-21 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 1.35e-21 *6.022e23 = approx 8.1297e2 = 812.97, which would be approximately 813. So in that case, the closest option is J:820.

Wait, but why would π be approximated as 3? The problem doesn't specify. Using π=3.14 is more accurate, giving 851, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume from the start. Let me re-express all the steps clearly.

Given:

Length (height) h = 1.8 microns = 1.8e-6 m.

Diameter d =1.0 micron → radius r =0.5e-6 m.

Volume V = π r² h = π*(0.5e-6)^2 *1.8e-6.

Compute (0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m².

Multiply by h: 0.25e-12 *1.8e-6 = 0.45e-18 m³.

Multiply by π: 0.45e-18 * π = approx 1.4137e-18 m³.

[H+] =1e-6 M = 1e-6 mol/L.

Convert [H+] to mol/m³: Since 1 L = 0.001 m³, 1 mol/L = 1e3 mol/m³.

So [H+] = 1e-6 *1e3 = 1e-3 mol/m³.

Number of H+ ions = [H+] (mol/m³) * V (m³) * Avogadro.

So:

1e-3 * 1.4137e-18 *6.022e23.

Compute 1e-3 *1.4137e-18 = 1.4137e-21.

1.4137e-21 *6.022e23 = (1.4137 *6.022) *1e2 = 8.513996 *1e2 = 851.4.

So about 851 H+ ions.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:843, which is 8 less. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation in the options used more precise values for π or Avogadro's number?

Wait, let me compute 1.4137 *6.022 precisely.

1.4137 *6.022:

Compute 1 *6.022 =6.022.

0.4 *6.022=2.4088.

0.1 *6.022=0.6022.

0.01*6.022=0.06022.

0.003 *6.022=0.018066.

0.0007 *6.022=0.0042154.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to just do it step by step.

1.4137 × 6.022:

Breakdown:

1 × 6.022 =6.022.

0.4 ×6.022=2.4088.

0.01 ×6.022=0.06022.

0.003 ×6.022=0.018066.

0.0007 ×6.022=0.0042154.

Adding all:

6.022 + 2.4088 =8.4308.

8.4308 +0.06022=8.49102.

8.49102 +0.018066=8.509086.

8.509086 +0.0042154=8.5133014.

So 8.5133014.

Multiply by 1e2: 851.33014.

So approximately 851.

But the options don't have 851. The closest is option C:843, which is 8 less. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial volume was computed incorrectly. Let me recalculate the volume.

r=0.5e-6 m.

r squared: (0.5e-6)^2 =0.25e-12 m².

Multiply by h=1.8e-6 m: 0
