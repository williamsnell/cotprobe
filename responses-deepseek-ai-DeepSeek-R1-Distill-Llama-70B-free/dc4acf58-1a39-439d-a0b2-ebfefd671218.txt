Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says I need to evaluate the sum of the ceiling of square roots from √5 up to √29. The ceiling function, denoted by ⎡x⎤, means the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. So for each number n from 5 to 29, I take the square root of n and then round it up to the nearest integer. Then I add all those ceiling values together.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I think I should figure out the square roots of each number in the range 5 to 29 and then apply the ceiling function to each. After that, I'll sum them all up.

Wait, but calculating each square root individually might take a lot of time. Maybe there's a smarter way to group them based on the integer part of their square roots. Because if I can find ranges where the ceiling of the square root is the same, I can calculate how many numbers fall into each range and multiply by that ceiling value. That would save a lot of time.

Let me think about the square roots and their integer parts. For any integer k, the numbers n where the square root is between k and k+1 (but not reaching k+1) will have a ceiling of k+1 when the square root is not an integer. Wait, no. Because the ceiling is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. So if sqrt(n) is exactly an integer, the ceiling is that integer. Otherwise, it's the next integer.

Wait, no, wait. Let's correct that. The ceiling of x is the smallest integer ≥ x. So if x is 2.3, ceiling is 3. If x is exactly 2, ceiling is 2. So for numbers n where sqrt(n) is not an integer, the ceiling would be the next integer. For example, sqrt(5) is about 2.236, so ceiling is 3. But sqrt(4) is exactly 2, so ceiling is 2.

So the plan is: Identify the ranges where the square root falls between k and k+1, and then determine how many numbers in that range are included in our sum (from 5 to 29). Then, for each such k, multiply the count by (k+1) and sum all of them.

Let me list the perfect squares to find the ranges.

Perfect squares around 5-29 are:

2² = 4

3² = 9

4² = 16

5² =25

6²=36 (but 36 is beyond 29, so the next perfect square after 25 is 36, which is beyond our range.)

So the square roots from 5 to 29 will range from sqrt(5) ≈2.236 up to sqrt(29)≈5.385.

So the ceiling values will be from 3 up to 6, but let's check.

Wait, sqrt(5) is ~2.236, so ceiling is 3.

sqrt(9)=3, so ceiling is 3.

sqrt(16)=4, ceiling 4.

sqrt(25)=5, ceiling 5.

sqrt(29)=~5.385, ceiling 6.

Wait, no, sqrt(25)=5 exactly, so ceiling is 5. sqrt(26) is about 5.099, so ceiling is 6? Wait no, wait. Wait sqrt(25)=5. So let's see:

- For numbers from 5 up to 8 (since 3²=9 is the next square), sqrt(n) is between 2.236 (sqrt(5)) up to just below 3. So the ceiling here would be 3.

Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify. The ceiling function for sqrt(n) when n is between k² and (k+1)² - 1 is k+1, except when n is exactly k², then it's k.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. For n between k² and (k+1)² - 1, the square root is between k and (k+1). So the ceiling of sqrt(n) would be k+1 for all n in [k² +1, (k+1)² -1], and exactly k when n=k².

Wait, let me test this with an example:

Take k=2. So k²=4, (k+1)²=9.

Numbers from 5 to 8: sqrt(5)=~2.236, ceiling is 3.

sqrt(8)=~2.828, ceiling 3.

At n=9, sqrt(9)=3, ceiling 3.

So for n from 5 (which is 2² +1) to 8 (which is 3² -1), the ceiling is 3.

Similarly, for n=9 to 15 (since 4²=16), the square roots are from 3 up to just below 4, so ceiling is 4.

Wait, n=16 is 4², so ceiling is 4.

n=17 to 24 (since 5²=25), sqrt between 4 and 5, so ceiling is 5.

n=25 is 5², ceiling 5.

n=26 to 35 would have sqrt between 5 and 6, but our upper limit is 29, so n=26 to 29.

So let's list the ranges and the corresponding ceiling values.

Let me make a table:

Range of n:      Ceiling of sqrt(n)
---------------------------------------
5 ≤ n ≤ 8       3
9 ≤ n ≤ 15      4
16 ≤ n ≤ 24     5
25 ≤ n ≤ 29     6?

Wait, wait. Wait, let me check the last part. Because 25 is 5², so sqrt(25)=5, ceiling is 5. Then n=26: sqrt(26)≈5.099, ceiling is 6? No, wait, no. Wait, 5.099 is less than 6, but ceiling is the smallest integer ≥5.099, which is 6? No, wait, no. Wait, 5.099 is between 5 and 6. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 5.099 is 6? No, wait, no. Wait, 5.099 is larger than 5, so the smallest integer ≥5.099 is 6? No, no, because 5 is less than 5.099, but the ceiling is the next integer only when the decimal is present. Wait, no.

Wait, let's think again. The ceiling of x is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x. So if x is 5.0, ceiling is 5. If x is 5.1, ceiling is 6? No, wait, no. Because 5.1 is less than 6, but greater than 5. So the smallest integer greater than or equal to 5.1 is 6? No, wait, no. Because 5.1 is more than 5, so the ceiling is 6? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Let me correct this. If x is 5.1, the ceiling is 6? No, wait, 5 is less than 5.1, but 5 is not greater than or equal to 5.1. So the ceiling of 5.1 is 6? No, wait, that can't be. Because 6 is greater than 5.1, but is there a smaller integer that is ≥5.1? 5 is 5, which is less than 5.1, so no. So the ceiling is 6.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for any x not an integer, the ceiling is the next integer. So for x=5.0, ceiling is 5. For x=5.000001, ceiling is 6? No, wait, no. Wait, no, no. Wait, 5.000001 is greater than 5, so the smallest integer ≥5.000001 is 6? No, that's not correct. Because 5 is less than 5.000001, but the ceiling is the smallest integer that is ≥5.000001. So that would be 6, because 5 is less than 5.000001, but 6 is greater. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 5.0 is exactly 5, but 5.000001 is just a bit more, so the ceiling should be 6? That doesn't make sense because 5.0 is 5, and 5.000001 is just a tiny bit more, so the ceiling would be 6. Wait, but that's not correct because 5 < 5.000001 <6, so the smallest integer ≥5.000001 is 6? No, no, wait, that's not correct because 5.000001 is greater than 5. So the ceiling is the next integer, which is 6. Oh, wait, no! Wait, wait a second. No, wait, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, let me think of a simpler example. Take x = 2.5. The ceiling is 3, right? Because 3 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.5. Similarly, x=2.1, ceiling is 3. So yes, for any non-integer x, the ceiling is the next integer. So if x is 5.000001, ceiling is 6? Wait, no, 5.000001 is between 5 and 6, so the ceiling would be 6. But that would mean that for numbers from 5.0 to 6.0 (excluding 6.0), the ceiling is 6. But wait, no, that's not right because 5.0 is exactly 5, so its ceiling is 5. But 5.000001 is more than 5, so ceiling is 6. So in the case of n=25, sqrt(25)=5, so ceiling is 5. For n=26, sqrt(26)=~5.099, which is more than 5, so ceiling is 6.

Wait, but let's check: 5²=25, so sqrt(25)=5. Then (5+1)²=36. So numbers from 26 to 35 have sqrt(n) between 5 and 6, so ceiling of 6. But in our problem, we're only going up to n=29, so numbers 26 to 29 fall into this range.

Wait, but that would mean that for n=25, ceiling is 5; for n=26 to 29, ceiling is 6.

So let me reconstruct the ranges.

Let's list the ranges and how many terms are in each:

1. n=5 to n=8: sqrt(n) is between ~2.236 and ~2.828, so ceiling is 3.
   How many numbers here? From 5 to 8 inclusive: 8-5+1=4 numbers.

2. n=9 to n=15: sqrt(n) between 3 and just below 4, so ceiling is 4.
   Numbers: 15-9+1=7 numbers.

3. n=16 to n=24: sqrt(n) between 4 and just below 5, ceiling is 5.
   Numbers: 24-16+1=9 numbers.

4. n=25: sqrt is 5, ceiling is 5. So 1 number.

5. n=26 to n=29: sqrt between ~5.099 and ~5.385, so ceiling is 6.
   Numbers:29-26+1=4 numbers.

Wait, let me check the ranges again.

Wait, the first range: n=5 to 8.

n=5: sqrt(5)=~2.236, ceiling 3.

n=8: sqrt(8)=~2.828, ceiling 3.

Yes, that's correct.

Second range: n=9 to 15.

sqrt(9)=3, ceiling 3? Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Because the ceiling of 3 is 3, but earlier I thought the range n=9 to 15 has ceiling 4. Wait, that's a mistake.

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, sqrt(9)=3, so the ceiling is 3, not 4. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me fix this. So I need to correct the ranges.

Let me re-examine the approach. The ceiling of sqrt(n) is k when sqrt(n) is in [k-1, k). Wait, no, that's the floor function. For ceiling, perhaps it's when sqrt(n) is in (k-1, k], then ceiling would be k.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think as follows:

For each integer k, the numbers n where ceil(sqrt(n))=k are those where sqrt(n) is in (k-1, k].

Because if sqrt(n) is greater than k-1 and less than or equal to k, then ceil(sqrt(n)) is k.

Wait, let me test this.

If sqrt(n) is exactly k, then ceil is k.

If sqrt(n) is just above k-1, say k-1 + ε, then ceil is k.

So for example, if k=3:

Numbers where sqrt(n) >2 and <=3 would have ceil=3.

Which translates to n > (2)^2=4, and n <=3^2=9.

Wait, that's n=5 to n=9.

Wait, because sqrt(5)=~2.236>2, so ceil is 3.

Similarly, sqrt(9)=3, ceil is 3.

So for k=3, n ranges from 5 to 9 inclusive.

But wait, earlier I thought n=5 to 8 was for k=3, but now I'm seeing that n=9 (sqrt=3) is included in k=3.

So, that changes the ranges.

Let me reorganize this.

For each k, find the range of n where ceil(sqrt(n))=k.

Which occurs when (k-1) < sqrt(n) ≤k.

Squaring all sides (since sqrt is increasing function), we get:

(k-1)^2 < n ≤k².

But n must be an integer, so n ranges from (k-1)^2 +1 to k².

So for each k, the numbers are from (k-1)^2 +1 up to k².

So let's compute for k starting from 3, since our n starts at 5.

Compute for k=3:

n starts at (3-1)^2 +1 = 2²+1=5, up to k²=9.

So n=5,6,7,8,9.

That's 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9).

Each of these will contribute 3 to the sum.

Wait, wait, no. Because ceil(sqrt(n))=k=3. So each of these 5 numbers adds 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=9 would have ceil=3, which is correct.

Wait, but then what about k=4?

k=4:

n starts at (4-1)^2 +1=3²+1=10 up to 4²=16.

So n=10 to 16 inclusive.

That's 16-10+1=7 numbers. Each contributes 4.

Similarly, k=5:

n starts at (5-1)^2 +1=17 up to 25.

n=17 to 25, which is 25-17+1=9 numbers. Each contributes 5.

k=6:

n starts at (6-1)^2 +1=26 up to 36, but our upper limit is 29. So n=26 to 29.

That's 4 numbers. Each contributes 6.

Wait, but let me check: for k=3, numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 (5 numbers). For k=4: 10-16 (7 numbers). For k=5:17-25 (9 numbers). For k=6:26-29 (4 numbers).

So now, let's compute the sum as:

sum = (5 numbers *3) + (7 numbers *4) + (9 numbers *5) + (4 numbers *6).

Let me compute each part:

5*3=15

7*4=28

9*5=45

4*6=24

Wait, but wait, our problem starts at n=5 and goes up to n=29.

Wait, let me check if these ranges cover from 5 to 29.

k=3: 5-9 (5 numbers)

k=4:10-16 (7 numbers)

k=5:17-25 (9 numbers)

k=6:26-29 (4 numbers)

Yes, that's correct. 5+7=12, 12+9=21, 21+4=25. Wait, 5+7=12, 12+9=21, 21+4=25. So from n=5 to n=29, that's 25 numbers (since 29-5+1=25). So all accounted for.

So sum = (5*3) + (7*4) + (9*5) + (4*6) = ?

Let me compute each term:

5*3 =15

7*4=28 → 15+28=43

9*5=45 → 43+45=88

4*6=24 → 88+24=112.

So the sum is 112.

Looking at the options, option A is 112.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, 5 numbers times 3: 5*3=15.

7 numbers times 4: 7*4=28. 15+28=43.

9 numbers times 5: 9*5=45. 43+45=88.

4 numbers times 6:4*6=24. 88+24=112.

Yes, that looks correct.

So the correct answer should be A:112.

To evaluate the sum $$\lceil\sqrt{5}\rceil + \lceil\sqrt{6}\rceil + \lceil\sqrt{7}\rceil + \cdots + \lceil\sqrt{29}\rceil,$$ we use the ceiling function, which gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number. The strategy is to group the numbers based on the integer part of their square roots and calculate the contribution of each group to the total sum.
