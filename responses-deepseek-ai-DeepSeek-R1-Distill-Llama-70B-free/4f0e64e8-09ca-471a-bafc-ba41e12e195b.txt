Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which option will not terminate a contract by operation of law. The options are A through H.

First, I need to understand what it means for a contract to be terminated by operation of law. From what I remember, termination by operation of law means that the contract ends automatically without any action from the parties involved. It's when certain events happen that the law says the contract is over.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Change in law that makes contract impossible. I think this is about impossibility. Like, if a contract becomes illegal because of a new law, the contract would be terminated automatically. So A would terminate the contract.

Option B: Bankruptcy of one party. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. I remember that bankruptcy can affect contracts, but does it automatically terminate them? Or does it just allow the other party to possibly terminate or renegotiate? I think bankruptcy might not automatically end a contract; maybe it's up to the trustee or the other party to decide. So B might not terminate by operation of law.

Option C: Expiration of the contract term. That makes sense. If the term is over, the contract naturally ends. So C would terminate it.

Option D: Partial performance. Wait, partial performance usually means that one party hasn't fulfilled all obligations. If a contract is only partially performed, I think it doesn't automatically terminate. Instead, the other party might sue for breach or specific performance. So D wouldn't terminate the contract by operation of law.

Option E: Supervening illegality. If something becomes illegal after the contract is made, like a change in law making the purpose illegal, then the contract is terminated automatically. So E would terminate it.

Option F: Death or insanity of a party. Death might terminate a contract, especially if the contract is personal in nature, like a service that only that person can perform. Insanity would likely have the same effect. So F would terminate.

Option G: Fulfillment of contract. If the contract is fully performed, then it's completed, so it's terminated. So G would end it.

Option H: Destruction of the subject matter. Like if the thing being sold is destroyed, making the contract impossible to fulfill. That would terminate the contract automatically. So H would terminate it.

Now the question is which option will NOT terminate the contract. So the ones that don't cause automatic termination.

Looking at B and D again. Bankruptcy (B) might not terminate automatically. I think when a party goes bankrupt, it's up to the other party to decide whether to continue or terminate, but the contract isn't automatically ended. So B wouldn't terminate by operation of law.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about D: Partial performance. Partial performance means that some but not all of the obligations are fulfilled. Does that terminate the contract? I don't think so. The contract remains in force, but there might be a breach. So the contract isn't terminated automatically; instead, the parties might have to take action. So D also doesn't terminate by operation of law.

Wait, but the question is which will not terminate. So the answer could be either B or D. Let me think again.

The question asks which option will NOT terminate a contract by operation of law. So I'm looking for an option that doesn't cause automatic termination.

Bankruptcy (B): I think the contract isn't automatically terminated. Instead, the trustee might choose to reject the contract, but it's not automatic. So B wouldn't terminate by operation of law.

Partial performance (D): The contract is still on unless someone breaches. Partial performance doesn't end the contract on its own. So D wouldn't terminate it either.

Wait, but I might be mixing things up. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: Bankruptcy of a party. I recall that upon bankruptcy, the other party might have the option to terminate, but it's not automatic. So the contract doesn't terminate by operation of law just because one party is bankrupt.

Option D: Partial performance doesn't terminate the contract. The contract remains until fully performed or breached.

So the question is which of these options doesn't terminate the contract. The options are A to H.

So looking back, the correct answer is either B or D.

Wait, the question is which will not terminate. So the options that do terminate are A, C, E, F, G, H. The ones that don't are B and D.

But the options are from A to H, and the answer is to choose one.

Wait, the question is which will NOT terminate, so the correct answer is the option that doesn't cause termination by operation of law.

So between B and D, which one is correct.

I think the correct answer is D: Partial performance. Because partial performance doesn't end the contract; it's just that some obligations are met. The contract is still in effect until fully performed or until a breach occurs that allows termination.

Wait, but another angle: if a contract is partially performed, does it mean that the parties have started executing it, so the contract is still valid? Yes, so partial performance doesn't terminate it.

So which of the options doesn't terminate the contract? The correct answer is D.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Change in law making contract impossible → Terminates.

B: Bankruptcy → Doesn't terminate automatically.

C: Expiration → Terminates.

D: Partial performance → Doesn't terminate.

E: Supervening illegality → Terminates.

F: Death or insanity → Terminates.

G: Fulfillment → Terminates.

H: Destruction of subject matter → Terminates.

So the options that don't terminate are B and D.

But the question is which one of the options (A-J) is the correct answer. So the options given are A to H, but the correct answer is either B or D.

Wait, the question asks which will not terminate a contract by operation of law. So the answer is either B or D.

Looking back, I think the correct answer is D: Partial performance won't terminate the contract by operation of law.

Alternatively, bankruptcy (B) also doesn't terminate automatically.

Wait, perhaps I should consider what each option refers to.

Termination by operation of law happens without any party taking action. So, for example, if the subject matter is destroyed (H), the contract is terminated automatically.

Bankruptcy (B) doesn't automatically terminate the contract; it might give the other party the right to terminate, but it's not done by operation of law.

Similarly, partial performance (D) doesn't end the contract; it's just that part of it has been fulfilled. So the contract is still in effect.

So the question is asking which one does NOT terminate the contract by operation of law. So both B and D wouldn't terminate automatically, but the options are separate, so which is the correct answer.

Wait, looking at the options again, the question is which will not terminate. So the answer is the one that doesn't cause termination.

So the correct answer must be either B or D.

I think I need to recall: does partial performance terminate a contract? No, it doesn't. Partial performance means that some obligations have been met, but the contract remains until fully performed or breached.

So the correct answer is D: Partial performance will not terminate the contract by operation of law.

But wait, another thought: some sources say that a contract is not terminated by partial performance; termination occurs when the contract is fully performed or when there's a material breach leading to termination.

So among the options, D is the one that does not terminate the contract.

To determine which option will not terminate a contract by operation of law, it is important to analyze each option:

- **Option A**: A change in law that makes the contract impossible would terminate the contract by operation of law.  
- **Option B**: Bankruptcy of one party does not automatically terminate the contract. The other party may have the option to terminate, but it is not done by operation of law.  
- **Option C**: Expiration of the contract term naturally terminates the contract.  
- **Option D**: Partial performance does not terminate the contract. The contract remains in effect until fully performed or breached.  
- **Option E**: Supervening illegality terminates the contract by operation of law.  
- **Option F**: Death or insanity of a party, especially in personal contracts, terminates the contract.  
- **Option G**: Fulfillment of the contract terminates it.  
- **Option H**: Destruction of the subject matter terminates the contract by operation of law.  

The question asks for the option that will **not** terminate the contract by operation of law. Both **Option B** (bankruptcy) and **Option D** (partial performance) do not terminate the contract automatically. However, **Option D** is the most direct example of an event that does not terminate the contract by operation of law, as partial performance merely indicates that some obligations have been fulfilled, and the contract remains in effect.  

**Answer: D**
