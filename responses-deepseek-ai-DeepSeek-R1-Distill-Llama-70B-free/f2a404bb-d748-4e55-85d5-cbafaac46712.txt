Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "All planets are smaller than Jupiter." The given predicates are j for Jupiter, Px means x is a planet, and Sxy means x is smaller than y.

First, I need to understand what each part of the sentence is saying. The sentence is making a universal statement about all planets. It's saying that every planet has the property of being smaller than Jupiter. So the structure is "For all x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter."

Let me break this down. The original statement can be rephrased as "For every x, x being a planet implies that x is smaller than Jupiter." In logic terms, that's a universal quantification followed by an implication.

So the general form would be: For all x, (Px → Sxj). Wait, wait, no—because Sxy is x is smaller than y. So if I have x being smaller than Jupiter, it should be Sxj, right? Because S is a binary predicate where the first argument is the smaller one.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If Sxy means x is smaller than y, then to say x is smaller than Jupiter, it's Sxj. So the structure is Px → Sxj. So the whole statement would be ∀x (Px → Sxj). That would mean "For all x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter."

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches that.

Option A: (∀x)(Px • Sjx). This uses a conjunction, which would mean x is a planet and Jupiter is smaller than x. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Jupiter is a planet, but the statement is that all planets are smaller than Jupiter. So if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x would be the opposite. So A is wrong.

Option B: (∀x)(Px ⊃ Sxj). That's exactly what I thought earlier. Px implies Sxj for all x. So B looks correct so far.

Option C: (∃x)(Px • Sjx). This is an existential statement, saying there exists a planet x where x is a planet and j is smaller than x. That's the opposite of what we want. We don't want to say that some planet is bigger than Jupiter; we want all to be smaller. So C is incorrect.

Option D: (∀x)(Px ⊃ Sjx). Wait, Sjx would mean Jupiter is smaller than x. So this is saying if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x. But that would mean all planets are bigger than Jupiter, which is the opposite of the original statement. So D is wrong.

Option E: (∃x)(Px • Sxj). This says there exists a planet x that is smaller than Jupiter. But the original statement is about all planets, not just some. So E is incorrect.

Option F: (∀x)(Px • Sxj). This uses a conjunction again. It would mean for all x, x is a planet and x is smaller than Jupiter. But this implies that everything that is a planet is also smaller than Jupiter, which is correct. Wait, but what if x is not a planet? The conjunction would make the whole statement true only if both are true. But in logic, if x isn't a planet, Px is false, so Px • Sxj would be false, but the universal statement would require that for all x, this holds, which isn't correct because non-planets would make the statement false. So F might not be the right choice. Alternatively, using an implication is better because it only imposes the condition when x is a planet.

Option G: (∀x)(Sxj ⊃ Px). This says for all x, if x is smaller than Jupiter, then x is a planet. That's the converse of what we want. It would mean that anything smaller than Jupiter is a planet, which isn't necessarily true. So G is incorrect.

Option H: (∀x)(Sjx ⊃ Px). This means if Jupiter is smaller than x, then x is a planet. Again, not what we're saying. We're saying planets are smaller than Jupiter, not that anything bigger than Jupiter is a planet. So H is wrong.

Option I: (∃x)(Px ⊃ Sxj). This is an existential statement saying there's some x where if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter. But this doesn't capture that all planets are smaller; it just says at least one is. So I is incorrect.

Option J: (∃x)(Px ⊃ Sjx). This would mean there's an x such that if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x. Again, the opposite, and also an existential statement. So J is wrong.

So reviewing, the correct structure is ∀x (Px → Sxj), which is option B. Wait, but earlier I thought about option F and whether it's correct. Let me double-check.

Option F is (∀x)(Px • Sxj). So for every x, x is a planet and x is smaller than Jupiter. But this would mean that every x in the universe is a planet and smaller than Jupiter, which isn't the case. Because if x is not a planet, then Px is false, making the conjunction false, which would make the universal statement false. So F is incorrect because it's too restrictive. It's saying all x are planets and smaller than Jupiter, which is not what the original statement says. The original statement only concerns planets, not all x.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: (∀x)(Px ⊃ Sxj).

The question requires translating the English sentence "All planets are smaller than Jupiter" into predicate logic using the given predicates: j (Jupiter), Px (x is a planet), and Sxy (x is smaller than y). The correct translation must capture the universal statement that every planet is smaller than Jupiter.

1. **Analyzing the Sentence Structure**:  
   The sentence can be rephrased as "For all x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter." In logical terms, this is expressed as a universal quantification followed by an implication:  
   \[
   \forall x (Px \rightarrow Sxj)
   \]  
   Here, \(Px \rightarrow Sxj\) means "if x is a planet (\(Px\)), then x is smaller than Jupiter (\(Sxj\))."

2. **Evaluating the Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \((\forall x)(Px \cdot Sjx)\)  
     This uses a conjunction, which would mean "x is a planet and Jupiter is smaller than x." This is incorrect because it implies the opposite of the original statement.  
   - **Option B**: \((\forall x)(Px \rightarrow Sxj)\)  
     This matches the logical structure derived above: "For all x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter." This is correct.  
   - **Option C**: \((\exists x)(Px \cdot Sjx)\)  
     This is an existential statement meaning "There exists a planet x such that Jupiter is smaller than x." This is incorrect because the original statement is about all planets, not just some.  
   - **Option D**: \((\forall x)(Px \rightarrow Sjx)\)  
     This means "For all x, if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x," which is the opposite of the original statement.  
   - **Option E**: \((\exists x)(Px \cdot Sxj)\)  
     This means "There exists a planet x that is smaller than Jupiter," which is incorrect because the original statement is about all planets, not just some.  
   - **Option F**: \((\forall x)(Px \cdot Sxj)\)  
     This uses a conjunction, meaning "For all x, x is a planet and x is smaller than Jupiter." This is too restrictive because it implies that every x in the universe is a planet and smaller than Jupiter, which is not the case.  
   - **Option G**: \((\forall x)(Sxj \rightarrow Px)\)  
     This means "For all x, if x is smaller than Jupiter, then x is a planet," which is the converse of the original statement and incorrect.  
   - **Option H**: \((\forall x)(Sjx \rightarrow Px)\)  
     This means "For all x, if Jupiter is smaller than x, then x is a planet," which is also incorrect.  
   - **Option I**: \((\exists x)(Px \rightarrow Sxj)\)  
     This is an existential statement meaning "There exists an x such that if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter." This does not capture the universality of the original statement.  
   - **Option J**: \((\exists x)(Px \rightarrow Sjx)\)  
     This means "There exists an x such that if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x," which is the opposite of the original statement.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct translation is \((\forall x)(Px \rightarrow Sxj)\), which corresponds to **Option B**.
