Question:

A defendant was smoking marijuana as he was driving home from work one afternoon. A police officer approached him on the freeway and stopped the car to issue a citation for speeding. As the defendant handed the officer his driver's license, the officer smelled burnt marijuana, saw the joint, and saw an open envelope on the seat next to the defendant containing a substance that looked like marijuana. The officer ordered the defendant out of the car, arrested him for unlawful possession of marijuana. The officer then searched the defendant and found a sealed envelope in the defendant's back pocket. Without asking the defendant's permission, the officer opened the envelope and discovered that it contained cocaine. The officer then unzipped one of the jacket pockets on the jacket the defendant was wearing and found more cocaine and arrested the defendant for possession of cocaine. The defendant was taken to the police station and immediately escorted to an interrogation room. He was given his Miranda warnings, waived his rights, and gave a statement admitting to possession of cocaine and marijuana. Which of the following is a correct statement of the applicable legal principles regarding the search of the defendant?

Options:

A: Any evidence found in the possession of the defendant is admissible, regardless of how it was obtained.
B: One who drives an automobile on a public highway does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy.
C: If an officer smells marijuana, they are automatically allowed to search the entire vehicle and the person.
D: The defendant must give explicit permission for the officer to search their personal belongings, even after an arrest has been made.
E: If an individual effectively consents to a search of their person, the evidence gathered during the search is admissible.
F: The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unlawful searches and seizures, making the search and the evidence inadmissible.
G: The officer is not permitted to search personal items found on the defendant after the arrest without a warrant.
H: The exclusionary rule requires that if an officer conducts an unconstitutional search, the evidence acquired in the course of the officer's subsequent activities is inadmissible.
I: The officer is only allowed to search the defendant after they have been formally charged with a crime.
J: When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an individual, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the person of the individual.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure and the Fourth Amendment. Hmm, I need to think carefully. Let me break down the scenario.

So the defendant was driving home and smoking marijuana. A police officer stops him for speeding. When the defendant hands over his license, the officer smells burnt marijuana, sees a joint, and sees an open envelope with a substance that looks like marijuana. The officer arrests him for possession of marijuana. Then, the officer searches him and finds a sealed envelope in his back pocket, opens it without permission, finds cocaine. Then, the officer unzips a jacket pocket and finds more cocaine, arrests him again. At the station, he's given Miranda warnings, waives rights, and confesses.

The question is about the legal principles regarding the search. So I need to figure out which of the options A-J is correct.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, searches and seizures need to be reasonable. There are exceptions, like searches incident to arrest. So when someone is arrested, the police can search their person and the area within their reachâ€”like the "wingspan" area.

In this case, the officer arrested the defendant for marijuana possession. After that, he searched the defendant and found a sealed envelope. Oh wait, the officer opened it without asking. But under the search incident to arrest doctrine, once a lawful arrest is made, the officer can search the person, including any containers on them. So opening the envelope would be permissible because it's part of the search incident to arrest. Similarly, unzipping the jacket pocket is part of that same search.

Looking at the options:

Option J says that when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest, they may search the person as a contemporaneous incident. That sounds correct. Because after a lawful arrest, a search of the person is allowed, including any containers on them.

Option C says if an officer smells marijuana, they can search the entire vehicle and person. Wait, that's not quite right. The officer needs probable cause to search the vehicle. Smelling marijuana might give probable cause, but the scope would depend on the situation. But in this case, the arrest was made first, so the subsequent search is under the arrest search exception, not just the smell.

Option H says the officer can't search personal items without a warrant after arrest. But that's incorrect because search incident to arrest allows searching without a warrant.

Option E says if someone consents, the evidence is admissible. But the defendant here didn't consent. The officer didn't ask for permission when opening the envelope.

Option J seems to be the correct statement because it reflects the lawful search incident to a lawful arrest. So the officer was allowed to search the defendant and any items on him at the time of arrest.

The correct legal principle is that when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest, they may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the person of the individual. This principle, known as a search incident to arrest, allows the officer to search the defendant and any containers on their person without a warrant or additional consent. In this scenario, the officer's search of the defendant, including opening the sealed envelope and unzipping the jacket pocket, falls under this exception. 

Option J correctly reflects this principle.
