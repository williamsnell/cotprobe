Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of global deaths caused by suicide as of 2017. The options are from A to J, with different percentages. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure, but I'll try to think through it.

I remember that suicide is a significant public health issue, but I'm not certain how it ranks compared to other causes of death. I think heart disease, stroke, and cancers are the top causes, each accounting for maybe 10-15% or more each. Then there's accidents, infections, and so on.

Wait, I vaguely recall that suicide is among the leading causes but not the top ones. So maybe it's somewhere around 1-2%? Or is it higher? I'm a bit confused because I might be mixing it up with other statistics, like years of life lost or something else.

I think in some regions, especially among younger people, suicide is a leading cause. But globally, I'm not sure. Let me think about any reports or data I've come across. Oh right, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports on this. From what I remember, WHO mentioned that around 800,000 people die by suicide each year. 

Now, global deaths each year are roughly around 55-60 million. If I take 800,000 as the number of suicides, then the percentage would be 800,000 divided by 56 million (as an approximate total). Let's do that calculation: 800,000 / 56,000,000 equals approximately 0.0142857, which is about 1.42857%. Looking at the options, option I is 1.40%, which is very close. 

But wait, maybe the numbers are a bit different. Some sources might say the total deaths are higher or the suicides are a bit more. Alternatively, perhaps the data is from 2017, and I'm thinking of more recent stats. Also, I should consider that the total number of deaths each year can vary based on population growth and other factors.

Another angle: I remember that in some countries, suicide might account for a higher percentage, but globally, it's lower. So if I'm thinking about 1.4% as the approximate figure, that would align with option I. But let me make sure I'm not confusing it with other causes like road traffic accidents or others.

Wait, road traffic accidents are a bigger cause than suicide. I think they account for around 1.3 million deaths annually, which would be about 2.3% of 55 million. So if road accidents are around 2.3%, then suicide would be a bit lower. So 1.4% makes sense for suicide.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the years. If the question is about 2017 specifically, perhaps the percentage was a bit higher. Let me think: another source I once read stated that suicide accounts for about 1.5% of all deaths worldwide. So again, that's close to 1.4%.

Looking back at the options, option I is 1.40%, which fits. So I think the correct answer is I.

As of 2017, the share of global deaths by suicide is best estimated by considering the approximate number of suicides (around 800,000 annually) relative to total global deaths (approximately 56 million). Calculating this gives a percentage close to 1.40%, which aligns with option I. This figure is consistent with reports from organizations like the World Health Organization and accounts for suicide being a significant but not leading cause of death globally.

Answer: I
