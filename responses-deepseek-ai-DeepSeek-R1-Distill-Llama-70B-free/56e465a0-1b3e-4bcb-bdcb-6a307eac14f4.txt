Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic induction. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the question is about a single turn loop in air with a uniform magnetic field normal to its plane. The area is 5 square meters, and the rate of change of flux density is 2 webers per meter squared per second. They want the induced emf at the terminals of the loop.

Wait, right, Faraday's Law of Induction is what I need here. Faraday's Law states that the induced emf is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Oh wait, no, wait—the formula is emf = -dΦ/dt, but the negative sign is about the direction, not the magnitude, so I can ignore the sign here because they're just asking for the value.

Magnetic flux Φ is given by B * A * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the loop. In this case, the field is normal to the plane, so theta is 0 degrees. Cos(0) is 1, so Φ = B*A.

But wait, the question gives the rate of change of flux density. Oh, flux density is another term for magnetic field B, right? So dB/dt is 2 Wb/m²/s. Wait, but flux Φ is B multiplied by area. So dΦ/dt would be (dB/dt) * A, assuming the area is constant.

Oh wait, right, because if the area isn't changing, then the rate of change of flux is just the rate of change of B multiplied by the area. So dΦ/dt = A * (dB/dt).

Given that, the induced emf is ε = dΦ/dt. So putting in the numbers, the area A is 5 m², and dB/dt is 2 Wb/(m²·s). So ε = 5 * 2 = 10 volts.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, let me double-check. Oh right, Faraday's Law says that the induced emf is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux. But since they're just asking for the magnitude, the sign doesn't matter here. So the calculation is correct.

So looking at the options, option B is 10 volts. So the answer should be B.

To determine the induced emf in the loop, we use Faraday's Law of Induction, which states:

\[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}
\]

where \(\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta)\) is the magnetic flux. Since the magnetic field is normal to the plane of the loop, \(\theta = 0^\circ\), and \(\cos(0^\circ) = 1\), so \(\Phi = B \cdot A\).

The problem specifies the rate of change of flux density (\(dB/dt\)) as \(2 \, \text{Wb/m}^2\text{/s}\), and the area of the loop (\(A\)) is \(5 \, \text{m}^2\). Since the area is constant, the rate of change of flux is:

\[
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = A \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\mathcal{E} = 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \, \text{volts}
\]

The negative sign in Faraday's Law indicates the direction of the induced emf, but the problem only asks for the magnitude. Therefore, the induced emf is \(10 \, \text{volts}\).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 10 volts**
