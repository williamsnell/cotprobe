Okay, so I've got this problem about angle-modulated signals. Hmm, angle modulation includes both amplitude and frequency modulation, but wait, no, angle modulation refers to phase and frequency modulation. Right, because amplitude modulation is different. So the given signal is v(t) = A cos[ω_c t + 2 cos60π t +5 cos40π t]. 

The problem is in two parts. Part A asks for the maximum phase deviation in radians. Part B asks for the instantaneous frequency deviation when t is 1/30 seconds.

Let me start with part A. The phase deviation is the maximum change in the phase from the carrier. The general form of an angle-modulated signal is cos(ω_c t + φ(t)), where φ(t) is the modulating phase. So in this case, the phase term is 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t). 

So the phase deviation would be the maximum value of this φ(t). Since both terms are cosine functions, their maximums add up. The maximum of 2cos(...) is 2, and 5cos(...) is 5. So the maximum phase deviation is 2 +5 =7 radians. Wait, but wait, cos can't be more than 1, so each term contributes 2*1 and 5*1, sum to 7. So part A is 7 radians.

Now part B: finding the instantaneous frequency deviation at t=1/30 seconds. Instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase with respect to time, divided by 2π. Wait, no. Actually, the instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase term, including the carrier frequency. But the frequency deviation is the change from the carrier frequency. So the deviation is (dφ/dt)/(2π). 

Wait, wait, let me get this right. The general formula for the instantaneous frequency f(t) is (1/(2π)) * d/dt [ω_c t + φ(t)]. So f(t) = (ω_c + dφ/dt) / (2π). The carrier frequency is f_c = ω_c/(2π), so the deviation Δf(t) is (dφ/dt)/(2π). So yes, the frequency deviation is (dφ/dt)/(2π).

So first, compute dφ/dt. φ(t) is 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t). The derivative is -2*(60π) sin(60π t) -5*(40π) sin(40π t). So dφ/dt = -120π sin(60π t) -200π sin(40π t). 

At t=1/30 seconds, let's plug that in. Let's compute each term:

First term: sin(60π * (1/30)) = sin(2π) = 0. Because 60π*(1/30) is 2π. So the first term becomes -120π * 0 =0.

Second term: sin(40π * (1/30)) = sin( (40/30)π ) = sin(4π/3). Wait, 40/30 is 4/3, so 4π/3 radians. Sin(4π/3) is -sqrt(3)/2. So the second term is -200π * (-sqrt(3)/2) = 200π*(sqrt(3)/2) = 100π sqrt(3).

So the derivative dφ/dt at t=1/30 is 0 +100π sqrt(3), which is 100π sqrt(3). 

Now, the instantaneous frequency deviation is (dφ/dt)/(2π). So (100π sqrt(3)) / (2π) )= 50 sqrt(3). Wait, 100/(2) is 50, and sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 50 * 1.732 is approximately 86.6 Hz. 

So the instantaneous frequency deviation is 50*sqrt(3) Hz which is about 86.6 Hz.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Let me recalculate the derivative and evaluate at t=1/30.

Wait, 40π*(1/30) is (40/30)π = (4/3)π. Sin(4π/3) is -sqrt(3)/2. So the second term is -200π * (-sqrt(3)/2) = 100π sqrt(3). That's correct.

So (100π sqrt(3))/(2π) )= 50 sqrt(3) Hz. 50 * 1.732 is approximately 86.6 Hz. 

So part B is 86.6 Hz.

Looking at the options:

Option E says maximum phase deviation 7 radians and frequency deviation 86.6 Hz. So option E would be the answer. Let me check the options:

Option E: Max phase dev 7 rad, inst freq dev 86.6 Hz. Yes.

So the correct answer is E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given angle-modulated signal:

\[
v(t) = A \cos[\omega_c t + 2\cos(60\pi t) + 5\cos(40\pi t)]
\]

### Part A: Maximum Phase Deviation
The phase term is \(\phi(t) = 2\cos(60\pi t) + 5\cos(40\pi t)\). The maximum phase deviation occurs when both cosine terms are at their maximum value of 1. Thus, the maximum phase deviation is:

\[
\Delta \phi_{\text{max}} = 2 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 1 = 7 \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Part B: Instantaneous Frequency Deviation
The instantaneous frequency deviation is related to the derivative of the phase term:

\[
\Delta f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}.
\]

First, compute the derivative of \(\phi(t)\):

\[
\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} = -2 \cdot 60\pi \sin(60\pi t) - 5 \cdot 40\pi \sin(40\pi t) = -120\pi \sin(60\pi t) - 200\pi \sin(40\pi t).
\]

At \(t = \frac{1}{30}\):

1. For the first term:
   \[
   \sin(60\pi \cdot \frac{1}{30}) = \sin(2\pi) = 0.
   \]

2. For the second term:
   \[
   \sin(40\pi \cdot \frac{1}{30}) = \sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
   \]

Thus, at \(t = \frac{1}{30}\):

\[
\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} = -120\pi \cdot 0 - 200\pi \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 100\pi\sqrt{3}.
\]

The instantaneous frequency deviation is:

\[
\Delta f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot 100\pi\sqrt{3} = 50\sqrt{3} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Using \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):

\[
\Delta f(t) \approx 50 \cdot 1.732 = 86.6 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Maximum phase deviation = \(7 \, \text{radians}\),
- Instantaneous frequency deviation = \(86.6 \, \text{Hz}\).

The correct option is **E**.
