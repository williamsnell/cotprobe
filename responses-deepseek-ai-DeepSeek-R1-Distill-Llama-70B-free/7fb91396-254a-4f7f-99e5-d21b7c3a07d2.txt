Alright, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about constructing a truth table for two propositions and then determining their logical relationship. The propositions given are ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P. The options are from A to J, each describing a possible relationship.

Okay, first things first, I need to understand what each proposition means. Let's break them down.

The first proposition is ~O ⊃ P. That's read as "not O implies P." In logical terms, implication can be a bit tricky, but I remember that A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B. So, ~O ⊃ P would be equivalent to O ∨ P. Wait, that's interesting because the second proposition is O ∨ P. So, are they the same?

Wait, maybe I should double-check that. So, if I have ~O implies P, that's the same as if not O, then P. Using the equivalence for implications, A ⊃ B is the same as ~A ∨ B. So substituting, ~ ( ~O ) ∨ P, which simplifies to O ∨ P. Oh, so ~O ⊃ P is logically equivalent to O ∨ P. That would mean the two propositions are actually the same in terms of truth values.

But wait, maybe I should construct the truth table to be sure. Let's do that.

There are two propositions, O and P, so the truth table will have four rows (since 2 variables mean 2^2 = 4 possible combinations).

Let's list all possible truth values for O and P:

1. O = True, P = True
2. O = True, P = False
3. O = False, P = True
4. O = False, P = False

Now, compute ~O for each row.

Row 1: ~O = False
Row 2: ~O = False
Row 3: ~O = True
Row 4: ~O = True

Next, compute ~O ⊃ P for each row. Remember that A ⊃ B is False only when A is True and B is False.

Row 1: ~O is False, so False ⊃ P (True) → True
Row 2: ~O is False, so False ⊃ P (False) → True
Row 3: ~O is True, P is True → True
Row 4: ~O is True, P is False → False

Now compute O ∨ P for each row.

Row 1: True ∨ True = True
Row 2: True ∨ False = True
Row 3: False ∨ True = True
Row 4: False ∨ False = False

Wait, looking at the two results:

~O ⊃ P: [True, True, True, False]
O ∨ P: [True, True, True, False]

They match exactly in all four rows. So, their outputs are the same across all possible truth values. That would mean that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

So, the next part is to determine the relationship. Since their truth values match, they are logically equivalent. Now, looking at the options, the correct choice should reflect that.

Looking at the options:

Option H is "Logically equivalent."
Option G says "Both logically equivalent and consistent." Wait, but I'm not sure about consistency here. Consistency usually refers to a set of propositions where there's no contradiction, meaning there's at least one row where all are true. But here, we're comparing two propositions, so maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The question is about the two statements: whether they are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.

Wait, if two propositions are logically equivalent, then they are consistent with each other because they don't contradict each other. But I think in this context, the options are about whether the pair is consistent or inconsistent. A consistent set is one where there's at least one truth value assignment where both are true. An inconsistent set would have no such assignment.

Wait, but in this case, since the two propositions are equivalent, they must have the same truth values in all rows. So, in the rows where ~O ⊃ P is true, O ∨ P is also true, and where one is false, the other is false. So, in rows where both are true, which are three out of four rows, the set is consistent. So the set {~O⊃P, O∨P} is consistent because there are scenarios where both are true.

Wait, but the question is about the two statements, so if they're equivalent, then they are consistent because you can have models where both are true.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to look at it. Alternatively, when two statements are equivalent, they are consistent with each other because they don't contradict each other. So, the pair is consistent.

But let me check the options again. Option H says they are logically equivalent. Option G says both equivalent and consistent. But I think the first part is about equivalence, and then the second part about consistency.

Wait, but the question is to determine whether the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory, and if neither, whether they are consistent or inconsistent.

So, since they are equivalent, the answer would be H.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are:

A: Both consistent and inconsistent → Doesn't make sense.

B: Neither equivalent nor contradictory, but inconsistent → No, because they are equivalent.

C: Contradictory → No, they are same.

D: Both contradictory and inconsistent → No.

E: Neither equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent → No, because they are equivalent.

F: Both equivalent and contradictory → No, that's impossible.

G: Both equivalent and consistent → Well, they are equivalent, and since they can both be true, consistent.

H: Logically equivalent.

I: Inconsistent → No.

J: None of the above → No, because H is correct.

Wait, but if they are equivalent, then in all cases, they have the same truth value. So, in each row, their truth values match. So, in three cases, they are true together, and in one case, both false. So, the set {A, B} is consistent if there's a model where both are true. Since there are three such models, the set is consistent.

Wait, but the question is about the two statements. So the two statements are equivalent, which makes them consistent as well. But the main point is whether they're equivalent.

Looking at the options, H says they're logically equivalent. Option G says both equivalent and consistent. So, perhaps H is the right answer because the question first asks whether they are equivalent or contradictory. Since they are equivalent, that's the primary answer.

Alternatively, if the question had a separate part about consistency, but I think the initial determination is that they are equivalent.

Wait, but the question says, "using the truth tables, determine whether the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, determine whether they are consistent or inconsistent."

So, the first part is to check equivalence or contradiction. Since they are equivalent, we don't have to consider the second part about consistent or inconsistent.

So, the answer is H: Logically equivalent.

To determine the relationship between the propositions ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P, we first construct their truth tables.

### Truth Table for ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P

| O | P | ~O | ~O ⊃ P | O ∨ P |
|---|---|----|--------|-------|
| T | T | F  | T      | T     |
| T | F | F  | T      | T     |
| F | T | T  | T      | T     |
| F | F | T  | F      | F     |

### Analysis:
1. **~O ⊃ P**: This is equivalent to O ∨ P (since A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B).
2. **O ∨ P**: Directly matches the second proposition.

From the truth table:
- The columns for ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P are identical across all rows.
- This means the two propositions have the same truth values under all possible interpretations.

### Logical Relationship:
Since the truth values of ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P match exactly, the propositions are **logically equivalent**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J**: Incorrect, as they do not accurately describe the relationship.
- **G**: Incorrect, as while the propositions are consistent, the primary relationship is logical equivalence.
- **H**: Correct, as the propositions are logically equivalent.

### Conclusion:
The propositions ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P are logically equivalent.
