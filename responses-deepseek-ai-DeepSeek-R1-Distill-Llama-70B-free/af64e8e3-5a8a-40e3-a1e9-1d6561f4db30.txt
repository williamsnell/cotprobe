Question:

A man decided to stop at a drive-through hamburger stand for a late snack. As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, "Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. " The manager retorted, "I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. "Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, "You can't do this to me. " When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head. In an action by the customer against the man for battery, the customer will be

Options:

A: successful, because the man caused harm with his actions, regardless of his intent.
B: unsuccessful, because the man was not aiming at the customer.
C: unsuccessful, because the manager could have prevented the situation by accepting the man's order.
D: successful, because the man was acting recklessly and created a dangerous situation.
E: unsuccessful, because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager.
F: unsuccessful, because the man was provoked by the manager's refusal to serve him.
G: unsuccessful, because the man did not intend to shoot the customer.
H: successful, because there was a "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.
I: successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager.
J: successful, because the bullet from the man's gun directly caused the customer's injury.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question about battery. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there's a man who goes to a drive-through hamburger stand late at night. The manager tells him through the intercom that they're closing and won't take any more orders. The man gets angry and yells his order anyway. The manager apologizes and says they can't take his order. Then, she serves the car in front of him. The man gets even angrier, drives up to the window, and yells at the manager. She laughs, which makes him pull out a gun, aim at her, and fire. He misses her but hits another customer, wounding him in the head.

The question is whether the customer can successfully sue the man for battery.

I remember that battery is an intentional tort. The elements are: (1) an intentional act (2) that causes harmful or offensive contact (3) with the plaintiff's person (4) without consent or privilege.

So, the man intended to shoot the manager. He aimed at her and fired. But he hit the customer instead. Now, the issue is whether his act constitutes battery against the customer.

I think this is a case of transferred intent. Transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to commit a tort against one person but accidentally affects another. So, if the man intended to shoot the manager (intent to cause battery), but hit the customer, the intent transfers, and he can be held liable for battery against the customer.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Successful because harm was caused regardless of intent. No, battery requires intent. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Unsuccessful because he wasn't aiming at the customer. But transferred intent says intent can transfer, so B might be incorrect.

Option C: Unsuccessful because manager could have prevented it. That's more about the manager's actions, not the man's intent. Probably not relevant here.

Option D: Successful because of recklessness. But battery requires intent, not just recklessness. So D might be wrong.

Option E: Unsuccessful because he couldn't foresee hitting someone else. But transferred intent doesn't require foreseeability; it's about the intent to harm someone, even if another is affected.

Option F: Provoked by manager. Provocation can sometimes mitigate but in intentional torts, it's not a defense to intent. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Unsuccessful because he didn't intend to shoot the customer. But transferred intent says the intent to harm the manager transfers to the customer, making G incorrect.

Option H: Successful because substantial certainty. I'm not sure about this. Substantial certainty is a standard for recklessness, maybe, but here it's about intent. So H might not be the best option.

Option I: Successful because he intended to shoot the manager. Since he intended to commit battery against her, transferred intent applies, so I could be correct. But the question is about the customer, not the manager.

Option J: Successful because the bullet caused the injury. Causation is there, but J doesn't address intent. So maybe not the best.

Wait, transferred intent would make the intent to harm the manager apply to the customer. So the man is liable for battery against the customer because he intended to shoot someone (manager) and thereby caused contact with the customer.

Looking at the options, the correct reasoning is transferred intent. So which option matches that?

Option I says successful because he intended to shoot the manager. That seems to align with transferred intent. But wait, I think the correct application is that the intent to harm the manager is transferred to the customer. So the intent is there, and the act causes the contact.

Wait, in transferred intent, the intent is transferred so the man is treated as having intended to harm the customer. So the customer's case would succeed.

Looking at the options, option I says he intended to shoot the manager, so that intent makes the customer's case successful. But I think the correct reasoning is that the intent transfers, so the battery is established against the customer.

Alternatively, option H talks about substantial certainty, but that's more about recklessness. So probably not.

Wait, another point: when the man fired the gun, he intended to hit the manager, but he hit the customer. Under transferred intent, his intent is sufficient to establish battery against the customer.

So which option supports this? Option I says successful because he intended to shoot the manager. That seems correct because the intent is there, and it transfers.

Wait, but let me make sure. The elements of battery require intent to cause contact. If he intended to hit the manager, but hit the customer, under transferred intent, the intent is transferred. So the customer can sue for battery because the intent was present, just directed at someone else.

So the correct answer would be option I or option H?

Wait, another thought: transferred intent applies so the intent is imputed to the customer. So the man had the intent to commit battery against the manager, and thus, under transferred intent, he's liable for battery against the customer.

Looking at the options, option I says successful because he intended to shoot the manager. Option H says substantial certainty.

I think option I is the better fit because it's about intent, and transferred intent applies. So the customer can sue successfully because the man intended to shoot someone, and that intent transfers.

Wait, but also, option J says successful because the bullet directly caused the injury. But that's about causation, not intent. So J might not address the intent element.

So the correct answer is I: successful because he intended to shoot the manager.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another angle is that if he intended to shoot the manager, that's one thing, but the customer is another. So the intent is there, and under transferred intent, the battery is established against the customer.

Therefore, the answer should be either I or H.

Wait, another approach: the man's act was intentional towards the manager, but the contact was with the customer. So under transferred intent, the intent is transferred, making him liable for battery against the customer.

So the customer can sue successfully because the man intended to commit a battery, and the intent transfers.

Looking back at the options, which option reflects this?

Option I says successful because he intended to shoot the manager. That's correct.

So the answer should be I.

The question revolves around whether the customer can successfully sue the man for battery after being shot. Battery requires: (1) an intentional act, (2) that causes harmful or offensive contact, (3) with the plaintiff's person, and (4) without consent or privilege. The man intended to shoot the manager but missed and hit the customer instead. This scenario involves the doctrine of transferred intent, where the intent to harm one person (the manager) transfers to the unintended victim (the customer).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because battery requires intent, not just harm.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because transferred intent applies, even if the man wasn't aiming at the customer.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because the manager's actions are irrelevant to the man's intent.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because battery requires intent, not recklessness.
- **Option E**: Incorrect because transferred intent does not require foreseeability.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because provocation does not negate intent in intentional torts.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because transferred intent imputes the man's intent to the customer.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because "substantial certainty" pertains to recklessness, not intent.
- **Option I**: Correct because the man intended to shoot the manager, and under transferred intent, this intent applies to the customer.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because it focuses on causation, not intent.

The correct answer is **Option I**, as the man's intent to shoot the manager transfers to the customer under the doctrine of transferred intent, satisfying the elements of battery.

**Answer: I**
