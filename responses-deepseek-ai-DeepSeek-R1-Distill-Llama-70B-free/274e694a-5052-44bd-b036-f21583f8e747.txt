Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about maximizing profit for a train set production. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says that each train set costs $10 to produce, regardless of how many are made. So that's a fixed cost per unit, right? Or wait, no, wait. Actually, if it's $10 per set no matter how many are made, that would mean it's a variable cost because it depends on the number produced. Wait, no, wait. Usually, fixed costs are like rent, which don't change with production. Variable costs are per unit. So in this case, the cost is $10 per set, so that's variable. So the total cost (TC) would be 10 times the number of units produced (x).

The demand function is given as p = 90 - 0.02x. So p is the price retailers pay, and x is the quantity sold. So this is an inverse demand function, right? As more units are sold, the price per unit decreases.

Part (a) asks for the profit function and the number of units that maximize profit. Profit is total revenue minus total cost. So I need to find TR and TC first.

Total Revenue (TR) is price times quantity, so p * x. Substituting from the demand function, TR = (90 - 0.02x) * x. Let me expand that: 90x - 0.02x².

Total Cost (TC) is the cost per unit times quantity, so 10x.

So profit (π) is TR - TC = (90x - 0.02x²) - 10x. Simplify that: 90x -10x is 80x. So π = 80x - 0.02x².

Wait, but profit is usually π = TR - TC. So I think I did that right.

To find the profit-maximizing quantity, I remember that this is done by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x, setting it to zero, and solving for x. Alternatively, since this is a quadratic function, the maximum occurs at the vertex. But maybe I should use calculus for practice.

So dπ/dx = 80 - 0.04x. Setting this equal to zero: 80 - 0.04x = 0 → 0.04x =80 → x=80 / 0.04 → 80 ÷ 0.04 is 2000. So x=2000 units.

So the optimal production quantity is 2000 sets. Now, to find the maximum profit, plug x=2000 into the profit function.

π =80*(2000) -0.02*(2000)^2 → 160,000 - 0.02*(4,000,000) → 160,000 - 80,000 = $80,000.

So the profit is $80,000 when 2000 units are produced.

Part (b) asks for the price retailers pay. Using the demand function p=90 -0.02x. Plug in x=2000.

p=90 -0.02*2000 → 90 -40 = $50.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check which one matches this. The options are A to J. Let's see each option's first number is the quantity, second is profit, third is price.

Looking for quantity 2000, profit $80k, price $50. Let's go through the options.

Option H says 2000 sets, $80,000, $50. Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me cross-verify the profit calculation. Because sometimes I might mix up the functions.

Profit function: π=80x -0.02x².

At x=2000, π=80*2000=160,000. 0.02*(2000)^2=0.02*4,000,000=80,000. So 160,000 -80,000=80,000. Correct.

And the price at x=2000 is 90 - 40 =50. Correct.

So the answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we start by defining the profit function and determining the optimal number of train sets to maximize profit. The demand function is given as \( p = 90 - 0.02x \), where \( p \) is the price and \( x \) is the quantity sold. The cost to produce each train set is $10, so the total cost (TC) is \( 10x \).

### Part (a): Profit Function and Optimal Quantity
The total revenue (TR) is calculated as \( p \cdot x \), which substitutes to:
\[
TR = (90 - 0.02x) \cdot x = 90x - 0.02x^2
\]
The profit function (\( \pi \)) is then:
\[
\pi = TR - TC = (90x - 0.02x^2) - 10x = 80x - 0.02x^2
\]

To find the profit-maximizing quantity, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d\pi}{dx} = 80 - 0.04x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{80}{0.04} = 2000
\]
Thus, the optimal quantity to produce is 2000 sets.

Next, we calculate the maximum profit by substituting \( x = 2000 \) into the profit function:
\[
\pi = 80(2000) - 0.02(2000)^2 = 160,000 - 80,000 = \$80,000
\]

### Part (b): Price Retailers Pay
Using the demand function \( p = 90 - 0.02x \), we substitute \( x = 2000 \) to find the price:
\[
p = 90 - 0.02(2000) = 90 - 40 = \$50
\]

### Final Answer
The optimal quantity is 2000 sets, the maximum profit is $80,000, and the price retailers pay is $50. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**H: 2000 sets, $80,000, $50**
