Question:

Explain how the planarian changes its body shape.

Options:

A: By extending and retracting spines along its body
B: Through the use of cilia on its underside for movement and shape alteration
C: By secreting a mucus layer to change body contours
D: By absorbing water and expanding
E: By coordinated contraction and relaxation of circular, longitudinal, and dorsoventral muscles, the body shape of a planarian can be varied.
F: By shifting the distribution of body fluids to different segments
G: By changing the thickness of its skin
H: By rapid cell division and growth in specific body regions
I: By inflating air sacs within its body
J: By altering its genetic structure

Okay, so I have this biology question about planarians and how they change their body shape. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that planarians are flatworms, right? They're those little worm-like creatures used in regeneration experiments. They have a soft, flexible body. I'm trying to recall how they move. I think they use something called cilia. Oh wait, cilia are like tiny hair-like structures. So maybe they help in movement.

The question is about changing body shape. So, how do they do that? I've heard that some animals like worms have muscles that help them move and change shape. Planarians might have specific muscles for that. I think there are different types of muscles involved. Like, maybe circular muscles that contract around the body, longitudinal muscles that run along the length, and dorsoventral which might go from top to bottom. If these muscles contract and relax in a coordinated way, the body could change shape.

Let me look at the options. Option A says extending and retracting spines. I don't think planarians have spines. They're more flat and smooth. Option B mentions cilia on the underside for movement and shape. I know cilia are for moving, like in water, but do they change the shape much? Maybe not the main method for altering body shape. Option C is about mucus; I'm not sure. Some animals secrete mucus, but for shape change? Not sure.

Option D is absorbing water to expand. That sounds like how some cells might swell, but I'm not sure planarians do that. Option E is about musclesâ€”coordinated contraction and relaxation. That makes sense because muscles can change the form of the body when they move. Option F is shifting body fluids. Like how an earthworm moves by shifting fluids, but planarians might not do that as much.

Option G is changing skin thickness. That seems unlikely because it would require the skin to expand or contract, which might not be their main method. Option H is rapid cell division. That's more about growth rather than shape change, so probably not. Option I is inflating air sacs. I don't think planarians have air sacs. Option J is altering genetics, which is way too slow for shape changes.

So putting it together, planarians probably change shape using their muscles. So the correct answer should be option E. The other options don't fit as well with what I know about planarians.

Planarians are flatworms known for their flexible bodies and ability to regenerate. Their movement and shape-changing involve a complex musculature system. They have three types of muscles: circular, longitudinal, and dorsoventral. By contracting and relaxing these muscles in a coordinated manner, planarians can alter their body shape effectively. Other options, such as using cilia for movement or secreting mucus, are less relevant to shape change. The most accurate explanation is the coordinated action of their muscles.

E: By coordinated contraction and relaxation of circular, longitudinal, and dorsoventral muscles, the body shape of a planarian can be varied.

Answer: E
