Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about failed felony prosecutions being retried at the federal level. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my constitutional law, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking why a state-level felony case that failed might be retried federally. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says it's under the "double jeopardy" provision. Wait, double jeopardy is about being tried twice for the same offense, right? I remember that the Fifth Amendment protects against that. But wait, isn't there an exception when it's state and federal? Like, if a state tries someone and it fails, the federal government can retry because they're separate sovereigns. So does that mean double jeopardy doesn't apply here? So maybe A is about the exception, but the question is about why it's allowed, not about the provision itself. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Option B is due to procedural errors in the state trial. Procedural errors can lead to appeals or retrials, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason for moving to federal court. It's more about correcting errors in the same jurisdiction, I think.

Option C mentions international law. That seems unlikely. I don't think international law interventions are a common reason for retrying a case in federal court. More like extradition issues or something else, but not retrying a failed prosecution.

Option D is ex post facto. That refers to laws applied retroactively, which is a different issue. So probably not relevant here.

Option E is habeas corpus. That's about unlawful detention, right? Like challenging the imprisonment. But retrying a case isn't typically what habeas corpus is about. So maybe E isn't the right choice.

Option F says new evidence voids the state verdict. New evidence could lead to an appeal or retrial, but I'm not sure if that's the reason for moving to federal court. It might be a reason for a retrial in the same court, not necessarily federal.

Option G is a mistrial. A mistrial usually leads to a retrial in the same court, not moving to federal. So G might not be the answer.

Option H is civil liberties violations. That could be a reason for appealing, but again, not sure how that leads to federal retrial specifically.

Option I is on appeal by state prosecutors. Wait, if the state prosecutors appeal, doesn't that go through the state appellate courts? Moving to federal would be a different system. Unless it's a federal issue, but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back to double jeopardy. The double jeopardy clause says you can't be tried twice for the same offense. But there's the dual sovereignty doctrine which allows state and federal prosecutions for the same act because they're separate sovereigns. So if a state prosecution fails, the federal government can prosecute for the same crime because it's a different sovereign. So the reason it's allowed is because of an exception to double jeopardy, which is the dual sovereignty doctrine. But looking at the options, none directly mention dual sovereignty. So the question is phrased as why it's done, not whether it's allowed.

Wait, the question says "Failed felony prosecutions at the state level are sometimes retried at the federal level" and asks why. So the reason is that the federal government can prosecute under a different sovereign, which is an exception to double jeopardy. So the answer would relate to that.

Looking at the options, option A is about the double jeopardy provision. But wait, double jeopardy would normally prevent it, except for the dual sovereignty exception. So the answer isn't because of double jeopardy, but because of the exception to it.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about why they can retry. So the reason is that the state and federal governments are separate sovereigns, so double jeopardy doesn't apply. So the answer would be A, because the double jeopardy provision allows it through the exception.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "under the 'double jeopardy' provision." So the retrial happens under that provision, meaning because of the exception. Or perhaps the correct reasoning is that the provision allows it because each sovereign can prosecute.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A because the double jeopardy clause doesn't prevent it due to separate sovereigns. So the retrying is permissible under the Constitution's double jeopardy provision as interpreted.

Wait, but the options don't mention the exception. So I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B, due to procedural errors. But I don't think that's the main reason for moving to federal court.

Another angle: The state and federal systems are separate, so even if a state trial fails, the federal government can bring charges for the same crime because it's a different sovereign. So the reason is the dual sovereignty doctrine, which is an exception to the double jeopardy clause. So the answer would relate to the double jeopardy provision because of that exception.

Therefore, the correct answer would be A, under the "double jeopardy" provision. Because the provision, as interpreted, allows for separate prosecutions by different sovereigns.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The question is about why they are retried at the federal level. So it's because the federal government can prosecute under a different set of laws, and the double jeopardy clause doesn't bar it because it's a different sovereign.

So option A is correct because it's under the double jeopardy provision, more specifically, the exception within it. So the answer is A.

The question asks why failed felony prosecutions at the state level are sometimes retried at the federal level. The correct answer lies in understanding the constitutional framework, particularly the "double jeopardy" provision of the Fifth Amendment. Double jeopardy protects individuals from being tried twice for the same offense. However, the dual sovereignty doctrine, an exception to this rule, allows separate prosecutions by state and federal governments for the same act because they are considered separate sovereigns. This means that even if a state prosecution fails, the federal government can retry the case under federal laws. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The "double jeopardy" provision, as interpreted, permits retrial at the federal level due to the dual sovereignty doctrine, which is an exception to the double jeopardy clause.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Procedural errors in the state trial may lead to appeals or retrials within the state system but do not explain why the case would be retried federally.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. International law interventions are not relevant to retrying a case at the federal level.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. "Ex post facto" laws involve retroactive application and are unrelated to retrials across jurisdictions.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. "Habeas corpus" pertains to challenging unlawful detention, not retrials.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. New evidence might lead to a retrial in the same court but does not explain federal retrial.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. A mistrial typically results in a retrial in the same court, not a federal one.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Civil liberties violations could lead to appeals but do not directly explain federal retrial.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Appeals by state prosecutors go through state appellate courts, not federal retrials.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the retrial at the federal level is permissible under the "double jeopardy" provision due to the dual sovereignty doctrine.
