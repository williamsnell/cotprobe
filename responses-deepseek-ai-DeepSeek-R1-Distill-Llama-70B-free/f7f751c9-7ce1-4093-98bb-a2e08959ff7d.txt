(b) how much will he charge each tourist if there are 3 tourists to a ride and Mr. Louis plans to have 125 rides each year?

Options:

A: Boat B, $9.50 per passenger
B: Boat A, $8.96 per passenger
C: Boat A, $9.50 per passenger
D: Boat A, $12 per passenger

Okay, so I have this problem about Mr. Louis wanting to buy a new boat for his tourist ride business. I need to figure out which boat he should buy and how much he should charge each tourist. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. Mr. Louis has two boat options: Boat A and Boat B. Each has different initial costs and annual fuel costs. Both boats last for 10 years and have zero salvage value, which means after 10 years, they're worthless. He wants a rate of return of 6%, so I think that means he's looking at the Net Present Value (NPV) of each option. The one with a higher NPV would be the better choice because it means more profit after considering the time value of money.

So part (a) is choosing between Boat A and Boat B. Then part (b) is determining the price per tourist. Let me tackle part (a) first.

Let me list the details:

Boat A:
- Initial cost: $10,000
- Annual fuel cost: $2,000
Boat B:
- Initial cost: $7,000
- Annual fuel cost: $2,500

The rate of return (discount rate) is 6%, and the project life is 10 years. I'm supposed to calculate the NPV for each boat. The one with a higher NPV is better.

Wait, but NPV is calculated by bringing all the cash flows to present value. So the initial cost is a cash outflow at time zero, and the fuel costs are annual cash outflows. Since both are costs, their present values will be positive numbers, but which one is lower?

Wait, no, because NPV is the sum of the present values of all cash flows. So for each boat, the initial cost is a negative value, and each year's cost is subtracted, so each year's fuel cost is a negative cash flow too.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model each boat's total cost over 10 years and then compare.

Wait, but since both have zero salvage value, there's no cash flow at the end. So for each boat, the initial outlay is a one-time cost, and then each year, there's an operating cost. So the total cost for each year is the initial cost plus 10 years of fuel costs, but adjusted for their present value.

So the NPV for each boat would be the initial cost plus the present value of the annual costs. The boat with the lower total NPV of costs would be the better choice because Mr. Louis wants to minimize his costs or maximize his profits.

Alternatively, since both are just costs, the one with the lower present value of total costs is better.

Wait, actually, Mr. Louis is considering which boat to buy; perhaps the revenues are the same regardless of the boat, so he's just comparing the costs. So the boat with lower NPV of total costs (initial plus fuel) would be better.

So I'll compute the NPV for each boat's costs.

The formula for NPV is:

NPV = Initial Cost + (Fuel Cost * Present Value of Annuity Factor)

The Present Value of Annuity (PVA) factor for 6% over 10 years is calculated as [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r.

Let me compute that. r is 6% or 0.06, n is 10.

PVA = (1 - (1.06)^-10) / 0.06

I'll calculate (1.06)^-10 first. Let me see, 1.06^10 is approximately 1.7908, so 1/1.7908 is about 0.5584. So 1 - 0.5584 = 0.4416. Then divide by 0.06: 0.4416 / 0.06 ≈ 7.36.

So PVA is approximately 7.36.

Now, Boat A's total cost NPV is:

NPV_A = -$10,000 + (-$2,000 * 7.36)

Wait, no, because the initial cost is a cash outflow, so it's negative. Similarly, each year's fuel cost is a cash outflow, so that's another negative. So:

NPV_A = -10,000 - (2,000 * 7.36)

Similarly, for Boat B:

NPV_B = -7,000 - (2,500 * 7.36)

Wait, but this would give the total cost in present value terms. Since we're comparing which is better, the boat with the lower total cost (i.e., less negative NPV) is better.

Wait, let me compute the numbers.

Compute for Boat A:

2,000 * 7.36 = 14,720. So Boat A's NPV is -10,000 -14,720 = -24,720.

Boat B: 2,500 *7.36 = 18,400. NPV is -7,000 -18,400 = -25,400.

Wait, so comparing NPV_A (-24,720) and NPV_B (-25,400). Since -24,720 is higher (less negative) than -25,400, Boat A is better because its total cost is lower in present value terms.

Wait, that's interesting. Even though Boat B is cheaper initially, its higher annual fuel costs make its total cost higher when considering the time value of money.

So for part (a), Mr. Louis should choose Boat A.

Now part (b): determining how much to charge each tourist.

We know that there are 3 tourists per ride and 125 rides each year. So total passengers per year are 3 * 125 = 375.

He needs to calculate the revenue required to cover his costs and provide the 6% return. Wait, but how is this structured? I think he's looking to break even, considering the NPV of his investment. Alternatively, he might be setting a price that allows him to achieve the 6% rate of return.

Wait, but the question says he wants a rate of return of 6% acceptable. So perhaps he's looking to have a certain profit, but the way the question is phrased in part (b), I think he needs to calculate the price per passenger such that his investment plus the operating costs are covered, and he gets a 6% return.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total revenue should equal the total costs when considering the time value of money. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's about finding the price that makes the NPV of the project zero, which would be the minimum price needed to accept the project at a 6% discount rate.

Wait, but let's approach it systematically. Let's compute the total costs in present value terms, which we've already done for Boat A as -24,720. Then, the total revenue needed would be the present value of the annual revenues, which should equal the present value of the total costs plus the initial investment. Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total annual revenue needed should cover the annual costs plus the return on investment.

Wait, but given that the initial cost is $10,000 for Boat A, and each year he spends $2,000 on fuel. So each year he has a cost of $2,000. But since the initial investment is a sunk cost, perhaps we need to calculate the annual revenue required to cover the operating costs and provide a return of 6% on the initial investment.

Wait, let me think again. The NPV approach for evaluating projects says that if the NPV is positive, the project is acceptable. So the NPV is the present value of all cash inflows minus the present value of all cash outflows. If the NPV is positive, it's a good project.

But in this case, Mr. Louis is starting the project, so the initial cost is a cash outflow, and the annual revenues are cash inflows. So to find the minimum price per passenger that would make the project acceptable (NPV >=0), we can set up the equation where NPV = 0.

So, for Boat A:

NPV = -Initial Cost + (Annual Revenue) * PVA = 0

We know initial cost is $10,000. Annual Revenue is the price per passenger multiplied by passengers per year.

Passengers per year: 3 tourists/ride * 125 rides/year = 375 tourists/year.

So Annual Revenue = price * 375.

So,

-10,000 + (price * 375) * 7.36 = 0

Wait, because PVA is 7.36 for 10 years at 6%.

So,

(price * 375) * 7.36 = 10,000

price * 375 = 10,000 / 7.36

Compute 10,000 /7.36.

7.36 * 1357 ≈ 10,000, but let me compute it accurately.

10,000 /7.36 = let's do 10,000 ÷ 7.36.

Calculate 7.36 × 1357 = 10,000?

Wait, 7.36 × 1357: Let's compute 7.36 × 1357.

Alternatively, compute 10,000 ÷ 7.36.

Well, 7.36 × 1357 = ?

Wait, 7.36 × 1000 = 7360.

7.36 × 357 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 10,000 ÷ 7.36.

Let me compute 7.36 × 1357:

7 * 1357 = 9499.

0.36 × 1357 = 488.52.

So 9499 + 488.52 = 9987.52. Close to 10,000, but not quite.

So 1357 gives 9987.52, which is 12.48 less than 10,000.

So 12.48 /7.36 = approx 1.697.

So 1357 + 1.697 ≈ 1358.697.

So 7.36 × 1358.697 ≈ 10,000.

So 10,000 /7.36 ≈ 1358.697.

So,

price * 375 = 1358.697

So price ≈ 1358.697 / 375 ≈ let me compute that.

375 × 3.62 = 1350.

375 × 3.625 = 375*(3 + 0.625) = 1125 + 234.375 = 1359.375. Which is a bit more than 1358.697.

So 3.625 would give 1359.375, which is 0.678 more than 1358.697. So let's find the exact value.

Let me compute 1358.697 ÷ 375.

375 × 3 = 1125.

1358.697 - 1125 = 233.697.

Now, 233.697 ÷ 375 = let's see: 375 × 0.623 = 233.4375.

So total is 3.623.

So approximately $3.623 per passenger.

Wait, that's about $3.62 per passenger. But let me check the options. Looking at the options given, the possible answers after part (a) is Boat A, which options B, C, D, E, J are for Boat A. The prices are $8.96, $9.50, $12, $7.50, $10.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake here because $3.62 is way lower than any of the options. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine my approach. Maybe I'm not considering the annual costs correctly.

Wait, in the NPV calculation, the initial cost is a cash outflow, and each year's fuel cost is another outflow, but the revenues are inflows. So the equation should be:

NPV = -Initial Cost + (Annual Revenue - Annual Cost) * PVA = 0

Ah, yes! I forgot to subtract the annual operating costs from the revenue. So the annual cash inflow is revenue minus fuel cost.

So, for Boat A:

NPV = -10,000 + (Revenue - 2,000) * 7.36 = 0

Because each year he makes revenue from tickets and spends $2,000 on fuel, so the net cash flow is (Rev - 2,000).

So Revenue is price * 375 passengers.

So,

-10,000 + (375 * price - 2,000) * 7.36 = 0

Let me compute this.

Move the -10,000 to the other side:

(375p - 2000) * 7.36 = 10,000

Divide both sides by 7.36:

375p - 2000 = 10,000 /7.36 ≈ 1358.697

So,

375p = 1358.697 + 2000 = 3358.697

p = 3358.697 / 375 ≈ let's compute.

3358.697 ÷ 375.

Well, 375 × 8 = 3000.

3358.697 - 3000 = 358.697.

Now, 358.697 ÷ 375 = 0.956.

So total p ≈ 8 + 0.956 = 8.956, which is approximately $8.96 per passenger.

Looking back at the options, option B is Boat A, $8.96 per passenger.

So the correct answer would be option B for part (a) and (b).

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check.

Yes, the mistake earlier was not subtracting the annual operating cost from the revenue. So the correct way is to have (Revenue - Operating Cost) as the annual cash inflow, then multiply by PVA.

So the right approach gives us $8.96 per passenger, which matches option B.
</think>

To determine which boat Mr. Louis should purchase and the price he should charge per tourist, we analyze the problem in two parts:

### Part (a): Choosing Between Boat A and Boat B
Both boats have an initial cost and annual fuel costs, with a project life of 10 years and a discount rate of 6%. The Net Present Value (NPV) of each boat is calculated to determine which has the lower total cost in present value terms.

#### NPV Formula:
\[
\text{NPV} = \text{Initial Cost} + (\text{Annual Cost} \times \text{Present Value of Annuity Factor})
\]

The Present Value of Annuity (PVA) factor for 10 years at 6% is:
\[
\text{PVA} = \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} = \frac{1 - (1.06)^{-10}}{0.06} \approx 7.36
\]

#### Boat A:
- Initial Cost: $10,000
- Annual Fuel Cost: $2,000
\[
\text{NPV}_A = -10,000 + (-2,000 \times 7.36) = -10,000 - 14,720 = -24,720
\]

#### Boat B:
- Initial Cost: $7,000
- Annual Fuel Cost: $2,500
\[
\text{NPV}_B = -7,000 + (-2,500 \times 7.36) = -7,000 - 18,400 = -25,400
\]

Since Boat A has a higher NPV (less negative), it is the better choice.

### Part (b): Determining the Price Per Tourist
To calculate the price per tourist, we ensure the Net Present Value of the project is zero, meaning the total revenue covers the initial cost, annual operating costs, and provides a 6% return. The annual revenue is the price per tourist multiplied by the number of tourists per year.

#### Annual Tourists:
\[
\text{Annual Tourists} = 3 \times 125 = 375
\]

#### NPV Equation:
\[
\text{NPV} = -\text{Initial Cost} + (\text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost}) \times \text{PVA} = 0
\]

For Boat A:
\[
-10,000 + (375p - 2,000) \times 7.36 = 0
\]

Solving for \( p \):
\[
(375p - 2,000) \times 7.36 = 10,000
\]
\[
375p - 2,000 = \frac{10,000}{7.36} \approx 1,358.697
\]
\[
375p = 1,358.697 + 2,000 = 3,358.697
\]
\[
p = \frac{3,358.697}{375} \approx 8.96
\]

Thus, the price per tourist is approximately $8.96.

### Final Answer:
Boat A should be purchased, and the price per tourist should be $8.96.
