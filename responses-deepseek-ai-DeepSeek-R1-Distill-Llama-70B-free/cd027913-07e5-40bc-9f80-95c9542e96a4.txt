Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the root-mean-square speed of nitrogen molecules under standard conditions and the kinetic energy when moving at the most probable speed. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that these calculations involve the kinetic theory of gases. 

First, part (a) is about the root-mean-square (rms) speed. The formula for rms speed is sqrt(3RT/(M)), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and M is the molar mass. Oh right, standard conditions are 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atm pressure. So T should be 273 K.

Nitrogen is N2, so its molar mass is 28 g/mol. I need to convert that to kg/mol because the standard units for R in J are kg and meters. So 28 g/mol is 0.028 kg/mol.

Wait, what's the value of R? I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Right, so plugging the values into the formula: sqrt(3 * 8.314 * 273 / 0.028). Let me calculate that step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 3 * 8.314 = 24.942. Then multiply by 273: 24.942 * 273. Let me see, 24 times 270 is 6480, but more accurately, 24.942 * 273. Let me compute 24.942 * 200 = 4988.4, 24.942 *70= 1746 (approx), and 24.942 *3=74.826. Adding them together: 4988.4 + 1746 =6734.4 +74.826=6809.226. 

Wait, wait, no, that's 24.942 * 273. Oh wait, no, 3*8.314=24.942, then 24.942 * 273 = let me calculate 24 * 273 = 6552, and 0.942 *273 ≈ 257. So total is around 6552 + 257 = 6809. So approximately 6809.

Then divide by M, which is 0.028 kg/mol. 6809 / 0.028. Let me compute that. 0.028 is 28e-3, so 6809 / 0.028 = 6809 * (1/0.028). 1/0.028 is approximately 35.714. So 6809 * 35.714. Hmm, 6809 * 35 is 238,315. 6809 * 0.714 is about 6809 *0.7=4766.3, 6809*0.014=95.326. So total is 4766.3 +95.326=4861.626. So 238,315 + 4,861.626= 243,176.626. Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation somewhere. Because I'm dividing 6809 by 0.028, which is the same as 6809 * (1000/28) ). 6809 * 1000 is 6,809,000. Divided by 28. Let's compute 6,809,000 /28. 28 * 243,000 is 6,804,000. So 6,809,000 -6,804,000=5,000 left. 5,000 /28 ≈ 178.57. So total is 243,178.57 approximately.

So sqrt of that. So square root of 243178.57. Let's see, 500 squared is 250,000. So sqrt(243,178) is a bit less than 500. Maybe around 492 or 493 m/s.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 492 m/s for part a, and option J has 492 m/s for a as well but different energy. So that might be a candidate.

Now part (b): the kinetic energy when the molecule is moving at the most probable speed. The most probable speed v_p is sqrt(2RT/M). Once I find v_p, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_p².

Wait, but for kinetic energy, another approach is since KE = (1/2) m v^2. And v_p is sqrt(2RT/M), so KE = (1/2)m (2RT/M) ) = (m RT)/M. But wait, m is the mass of a single molecule, and M is the molar mass. Hmm, maybe it's better to express it in terms of R.

Alternatively, the average translational kinetic energy is (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant. But wait, the most probable speed's kinetic energy might be different. Wait, no, let me think. The most probable speed v_p is sqrt(2kT/m), where m is the mass of one molecule. So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)m v_p² = (1/2)m (2kT/m) ) = kT. So KE = kT.

Wait, that seems promising. So if I can calculate kT at standard conditions, that's the KE for part b.

But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.380649e-23 J/K. The temperature is 273 K. So KE = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 273 K = approximately 3.77e-21 J.

Looking at the options, part b is about 3.76e-21 or 3.7e-21. So let's see the options. Option D for part a is 492 m/s, and part b is 3.76e-21 J. That matches with our calculation.

So the correct option would be D: 492 m/sec, 3.76 × 10^-21 Joule.

To solve the problem, we calculate the root-mean-square (rms) speed of nitrogen molecules under standard conditions and the kinetic energy of a molecule moving at the most probable speed.

### Part (a): Root-Mean-Square Speed
The formula for rms speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
\]

Where:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \) (gas constant),
- \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \) (standard temperature),
- \( M = 0.028 \, \text{kg/mol} \) (molar mass of \( \text{N}_2 \)).

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 273}{0.028}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
3 \cdot 8.314 = 24.942, \quad 24.942 \cdot 273 = 6809.226
\]

Now divide by \( M \):

\[
\frac{6809.226}{0.028} \approx 243178.57
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{rms}} \approx \sqrt{243178.57} \approx 492 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Part (b): Kinetic Energy at Most Probable Speed
The most probable speed is given by:

\[
v_p = \sqrt{\frac{2RT}{M}}
\]

The kinetic energy is:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v_p^2
\]

Substituting \( v_p^2 = \frac{2RT}{M} \):

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m \cdot \frac{2RT}{M} = \frac{mRT}{M}
\]

Since \( m = \frac{M}{N_A} \), where \( N_A \) is Avogadro's number, and using \( k = \frac{R}{N_A} \) (Boltzmann constant):

\[
KE = kT
\]

Given \( k = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) and \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \):

\[
KE = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 273 \approx 3.76 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The rms speed is approximately \( 492 \, \text{m/s} \),
- The kinetic energy at the most probable speed is approximately \( 3.76 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J} \).

The correct option is:

**D: 492 m/sec, 3.76 × 10⁻²¹ Joule**
