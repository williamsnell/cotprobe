Okay, so I have this problem about profit maximization for a train set. Hmm, let's see. I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Right, so the profit function π is TR - TC.

The problem says each train set costs $10 to produce, no matter how many are made. So the total cost (TC) would be 10 times the number of sets produced, which is 10x. Got that part. 

Now, the demand function is given as p = 90 - 0.02x. So price p depends on the number of sets sold x. The demand function is linear, which means the revenue will be a quadratic function. 

Total revenue (TR) is price multiplied by quantity. So TR = p * x. Substituting the demand function into this, TR becomes (90 - 0.02x) * x. Let me expand that. That would be 90x - 0.02x². Okay, so TR is 90x - 0.02x².

Profit is TR minus TC. So π = TR - TC = (90x - 0.02x²) - 10x. Simplifying that, 90x -10x is 80x. So π = 80x - 0.02x². That's the profit function.

Now, to find the quantity that maximizes profit, I need to find the maximum of this function. Since this is a quadratic equation, and the coefficient of x² is negative (-0.02), the parabola opens downward, so the vertex is the maximum point. The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a) for a quadratic ax² + bx + c.

In this case, a is -0.02 and b is 80. So x = -80/(2*(-0.02)). Let me calculate that. The denominator is 2*(-0.02) = -0.04. So x = -80 / (-0.04) = 2000. So x is 2000 sets. That's the quantity that should be produced to maximize profit.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, x = 2000. Then, what's the price? The demand function is p =90 -0.02x. Plugging x=2000, p=90 -0.02*2000. 0.02 times 2000 is 40. So 90-40=50. So price is $50.

Now, the profit at x=2000 would be π=80(2000) -0.02*(2000)^2. Let's compute that. 80*2000 is 160,000. 0.02*(2000)^2 is 0.02*4,000,000 =80,000. So π=160,000 -80,000=80,000. So profit is $80,000.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H says 2000 sets, $80,000 profit, and price $50. That matches. So the answers should be 2000 sets, $80,000 profit, and $50 price.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let me recheck the profit function. TR is (90 -0.02x)x =90x -0.02x². TC is 10x. So π=90x -0.02x² -10x =80x -0.02x². Correct. Then x for max profit is at vertex: x= -b/(2a) = -80/(2*(-0.02))= -80/-0.04=2000. Correct.

So yes, the correct answer should be H: 2000 sets, $80,000, $50.

To determine the profit-maximizing quantity, price, and profit, we start by defining the profit function. The total cost (TC) is $10 per train set, so \( TC = 10x \). The demand function is \( p = 90 - 0.02x \), where \( p \) is the price and \( x \) is the quantity sold. Total revenue (TR) is the product of price and quantity, so:

\[
TR = p \cdot x = (90 - 0.02x) \cdot x = 90x - 0.02x^2
\]

The profit function (\( \pi \)) is then:

\[
\pi = TR - TC = (90x - 0.02x^2) - 10x = 80x - 0.02x^2
\]

To maximize profit, we find the vertex of this quadratic function. The vertex of a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -0.02 \) and \( b = 80 \), so:

\[
x = -\frac{80}{2(-0.02)} = -\frac{80}{-0.04} = 2000
\]

Thus, the profit-maximizing quantity is 2000 sets. Substituting \( x = 2000 \) into the demand function to find the price:

\[
p = 90 - 0.02(2000) = 90 - 40 = 50
\]

So, the price is $50. Finally, substituting \( x = 2000 \) into the profit function:

\[
\pi = 80(2000) - 0.02(2000)^2 = 160,000 - 80,000 = 80,000
\]

The profit is $80,000. Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**H: 2000 sets, $80,000, $50**
