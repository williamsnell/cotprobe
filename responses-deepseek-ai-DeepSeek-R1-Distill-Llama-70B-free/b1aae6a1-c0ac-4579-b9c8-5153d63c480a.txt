Okay, so I've got this tax question about partnerships and liquidating distributions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about Gulde's basis in the land after receiving a liquidating distribution from Chyme Partnership. So, Gulde had a tax basis of $26,000 in the partnership at the time of the distribution. The distribution consists of $12,000 cash and land. The land's adjusted basis according to Chyme is $10,000, and its fair market value is $30,000. Also, the partnership doesn't have any unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or contributed properties from partners. 

I remember that when a partner receives a liquidating distribution, the tax treatment depends on several factors. First, the distribution is considered non-liquidating if it doesn't end the partner's involvement, but in this case, it's liquidating, so that's different. In a liquidating distribution, the partner's basis is adjusted based on the items received.

So, the general rule is that when a partner receives a distribution from a partnership, the partner's basis is adjusted by the tax basis of the assets received. But wait, I think it's more about the partner's basis in the partnership being used to determine the basis in the assets received.

Let me recall the order of distribution. In a liquidating distribution, the partner's basis is allocated first to the cash received, then to other assets based on their adjusted basis. So, the partner's basis is reduced by the cash received first, and any remaining basis is allocated to the other assets.

Gulde's initial basis is $26,000. He received $12k cash and land. So, first, the $12k cash is taken out of his basis. So, his basis after receiving the cash would be $26k - $12k = $14k. Then, this $14k is allocated to the land. 

Wait, but what about the basis of the land in the partnership? The land's adjusted basis to Chyme is $10k. But when the partner receives it, the basis in the land is the partner's remaining basis after the cash distribution. So, does the land's basis to the partner become $14k, regardless of the partnership's basis in it?

I think that's right because the partner's basis in the received assets depends on their basis in the partnership, not the partnership's basis in the assets. Also, since the distribution is liquidating, any gain or loss would be recognized if the FMV of the assets differs from the basis. But wait, in this case, Chyme is distributing the land, so is there a gain or loss at the partnership level? Well, the question says that Chyme didn't have any unrealized receivables or appreciated inventory, so I think that means that the land is being distributed at its adjusted basis, so the partnership doesn't have a gain on the distribution. But I'm not sure if that affects the partner's basis.

So focusing back on the partner, Gulde. His basis in the partnership was $26,000. He receives $12k cash, which is a return of capital. So his basis is reduced by $12k, leaving $14k. This remaining $14k is allocated to the land. So the land's basis in his hands is $14k.

Looking at the options, option C is $14,000. So that's probably the correct answer. 

But wait, another thought. What if the cash distribution exceeds the partner's basis? Then the excess would be taxable as gain. But in this case, the cash is $12k and the basis is $26k, so it's less, so no gain. So the basis after cash is $14k allocated to land.

Yes, I think that's correct. So the answer should be C.

To determine Gulde’s basis in the land after the liquidating distribution, we start with Gulde’s initial tax basis in the Chyme Partnership, which is $26,000. In a liquidating distribution, the partner’s basis is first reduced by the cash received, and any remaining basis is allocated to the non-cash assets received.

1. **Cash Distribution**: Gulde receives $12,000 in cash. This reduces his basis in the partnership by $12,000, leaving $26,000 - $12,000 = $14,000.

2. **Allocation to Land**: The remaining basis of $14,000 is allocated to the land received in the distribution. The land’s adjusted basis to the partnership ($10,000) and its fair market value ($30,000) are irrelevant for determining Gulde’s basis in the land. Gulde’s basis in the land is solely determined by his remaining partnership basis after the cash distribution.

Thus, Gulde’s basis in the land is $14,000.
