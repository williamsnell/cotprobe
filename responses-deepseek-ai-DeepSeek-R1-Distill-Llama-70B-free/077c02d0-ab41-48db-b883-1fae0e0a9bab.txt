Okay, so I've got this question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about what Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without considering whether people's interests are being pursued. The options are A through H, with labels like fanatics, irrationalists, purists, etc.

Hmm, I remember that Hare is a philosopher, probably R.M. Hare. He's known for his work in ethics, especially universal prescriptivism. But wait, the question is about a specific term he uses. I think he talks about different types of moral reasoning or people's approaches to ethics.

So, the key here is that these people endorse ideals without regard for interests. That means they're more focused on the ideal itself, maybe following a principle regardless of the outcomes or people's actual interests.

Let me think about the terms. Purists might be someone who strictly adheres to a principle without compromising. Non-pragmatists would be people who don't focus on practical outcomes, which seems similar. Irrationalists might be against reason, but I don't think that's the right fit here.

Wait, I think Hare uses the term 'fanatic' in his work. Oh right! In his book "The Language of Morals," Hare discusses how a fanatic is someone who holds a moral principle without allowing for any exceptions, even when it leads to bad consequences. They don't consider the interests or well-being of people affected because their principle is absolute.

So if someone endorses an ideal without considering people's interests, Hare would call them a fanatic. That would match option A.

Wait, but I also recall that Hare contrasts fanatics with others like the 'amoralist' who doesn't accept any moral principles. So the fanatic is someone who has a rigid moral stance, ignoring the consequences on interests.

So putting it together, the answer should be A: fanatics.

The question asks what Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without considering whether people's interests are pursued. Based on the reasoning, Hare, likely R.M. Hare, uses the term "fanatic" to describe individuals who rigidly adhere to moral principles without allowing exceptions, even when it leads to harmful consequences. This aligns with the description of endorsing ideals regardless of people's interests.

Answer: A
