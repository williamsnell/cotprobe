Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many ways a group of 7 people can be divided into 2 non-empty subsets. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

I remember that when dividing a set into subsets, especially into two parts, there are a few things to consider. First, if the subsets are distinguishable (like labeled as Group A and Group B), the number of ways would be different than if they're indistinct. But in this problem, I think the subsets aren't labeled, so the order doesn't matter. 

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the question doesn't specify any particular labels on the subsets. It just says two non-empty subsets. So that means if I split the group into subsets X and Y, and another split into Y and X, those would be the same division, right? So the order doesn't matter, meaning I have to account for that in my calculation.

So, the initial thought is about the total number of subsets. For each person, they can be in either subset A or subset B. But since the subsets are non-empty, I can't have all people in A and none in B, or vice versa.

Wait, but if each of the 7 people has two choices (A or B), the total number of possible assignments would be 2^7, which is 128. But this includes the cases where all are in A or all in B, which are two cases we need to exclude. So 128 minus 2 is 126.

But wait, that's the number of ways to assign each person to either group, considering each group as a separate choice. But since the two subsets are indistinct, each division is counted twice in this total. Like, assigning person 1 to A and the rest to B is the same as assigning person 1 to B and the rest to A. So I need to divide by 2 to correct for this duplication.

So the calculation would be (2^7 - 2) / 2. Let's compute that. 2^7 is 128, minus 2 is 126. Divided by 2 is 63. So that would be 63 ways.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is to calculate the number of ways to split 7 people into two groups where the order doesn't matter. So for non-empty subsets, the number is equal to the Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n, k), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of subsets. Here, k=2.

The Stirling number S(n, 2) is given by (2^n - 2)/2, which is exactly what I calculated earlier. So S(7,2) would be (128-2)/2 = 63. So that's 63 ways.

Looking at the options, option D is 63. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but another way to think about it is using combinations. To divide into two non-empty subsets, I can pick a subset of size 1, 2, 3, etc., but since the subsets are indistinct, each split is counted once. So the total number would be the sum from k=1 to k=6 of C(7, k), but then divide by 2 because each split is counted twice (like choosing subset of size k and subset of size 7-k is the same thing).

Wait, let me see. The sum of C(7, k) for k=1 to 6 is (2^7 - 2) = 126. So the sum is 126, but since each division is counted twice (because choosing subset A and subset B is the same as choosing B and A), we divide by 2, getting 63 again. So same result.

Alternatively, if I think about it as 2^7 = 128 possible subsets (including the empty set and the full set). Then subtract the two cases where all are in one subset (either all in A or all in B). So 128-2=126. But because each division is counted twice here (once as A and B, once as B and A), I divide by 2. 126/2=63.

So yes, 63 is the answer. That's option D.
</think>

To determine the number of ways to divide a group of 7 people into 2 non-empty subsets, we start by considering the total number of ways to assign each person to one of two subsets. Each person has 2 choices (subset A or subset B), leading to \( 2^7 = 128 \) possible assignments. However, this includes the cases where all people are in one subset (either all in A or all in B), which are invalid since the subsets must be non-empty. Subtracting these 2 cases gives \( 128 - 2 = 126 \).

Since the two subsets are indistinct (the order of the subsets does not matter), each division is counted twice in the total of 126. To correct for this duplication, we divide by 2, resulting in \( \frac{126}{2} = 63 \).

This result can also be verified using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, \( S(n, k) \), which count the number of ways to partition \( n \) elements into \( k \) non-empty subsets. For \( S(7, 2) \), the formula \( \frac{2^n - 2}{2} \) gives the same result: \( \frac{128 - 2}{2} = 63 \).

Thus, the number of ways to divide the group of 7 people into 2 non-empty subsets is **63**.
