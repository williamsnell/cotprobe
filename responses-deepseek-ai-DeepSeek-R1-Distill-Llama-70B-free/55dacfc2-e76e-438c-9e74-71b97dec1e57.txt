Okay, so I have this economics problem here about profit maximization and the effect of a tax. Hmm, I remember that profit maximization occurs where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives me the demand function P = 15 - 0.05q. I think this is the inverse demand function, right? So P is the price, and q is the quantity demanded. 

The total cost function is given as TC = q + 0.02q². I need to find the marginal cost (MC) from this. Marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost with respect to q. So, taking the derivative of TC:

TC = q + 0.02q²
d(TC)/dq = 1 + 0.04q. So MC = 1 + 0.04q.

Next, for the demand side, I need to find the marginal revenue (MR). MR is the derivative of the total revenue (TR) with respect to q. TR is P multiplied by q, so:

TR = P * q = (15 - 0.05q) * q = 15q - 0.05q².

Now, find MR by taking the derivative of TR:

d(TR)/dq = 15 - 0.10q. So MR = 15 - 0.10q.

At profit-maximizing quantity, MR equals MC. So set them equal:

15 - 0.10q = 1 + 0.04q.

Solving for q:

15 - 1 = 0.10q + 0.04q
14 = 0.14q
q = 14 / 0.14 = 100.

So the profit-maximizing quantity without tax is 100 units. Now, find the price using the demand function:

P = 15 - 0.05(100) = 15 - 5 = 10.

So P* is $10 when there's no tax.

That's part a done. Now part b, where a $1 per unit tax is imposed. I think this is a per-unit tax, so it affects the cost. So the new total cost function becomes TC + tax. Since the tax is $1 per unit, the new TC is q + 0.02q² + 1*q. So TC = q + 0.02q² + q = 2q + 0.02q².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the original TC was q + 0.02q². Adding a tax of $1 per unit would add 1*q to the cost. So new TC is q + 0.02q² + q = 2q + 0.02q²? Wait, that can't be right. Because the original TC is variable costs, and the tax is a variable cost as well. So the firm's marginal cost increases by $1 per unit.

So the new MC is the derivative of the new TC. Let me recalculate:

New TC = q (original) + 0.02q² + (1*q) tax.

Wait, no. Wait, original TC is q + 0.02q². Adding a per-unit tax of $1 would mean the firm's cost per unit increases by $1. So the new TC is (q + 1q) + 0.02q²? Hmm, wait, no, that would be adding q twice. I think that's not correct.

Wait, the original TC is q (maybe fixed costs?) plus 0.02q². Wait, probably the q is a variable cost, like maybe labor costs or something. So a tax of $1 per unit would add an additional variable cost of $1 per unit. So the new variable cost per unit is (1 + 1) = 2? Or is the original TC = q (fixed?) plus 0.02q² (variable). Wait, no—usually, TC includes all costs. Let me think again.

Wait, in the original TC function, q is the variable cost term. So it's q (like each unit costs $1 to produce) and 0.02q² (perhaps a quadratic cost, maybe increasing marginal costs). So adding a tax of $1 per unit would mean that for each unit produced, the firm has to pay an additional $1 to the government. So the variable cost per unit becomes (1 + 1) = 2. So the new TC function is 2q + 0.02q².

Alternatively, the tax could be treated as an increase in marginal cost. So the original MC was 1 + 0.04q. With a $1 tax per unit, the new MC becomes (1 + 1) + 0.04q = 2 + 0.04q.

So now, the firm's MC is 2 + 0.04q. The MR remains the same because the demand function hasn't changed. So MR is still 15 - 0.10q.

Set MR equal to new MC:

15 - 0.10q = 2 + 0.04q.

Solving for q:

15 - 2 = 0.10q + 0.04q
13 = 0.14q
q = 13 / 0.14.

Let me compute that. 0.14 * 90 = 12.6. 13 - 12.6 = 0.4. 0.4 / 0.14 is approximately 2.857. So 90 + 2.857 ≈ 92.857, approximately 92.86 units.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are whole numbers or specific decimals. Alternatively, maybe exact fractions. Let me compute more accurately.

13 / 0.14 = 130/1.4 = let's see, 130 divided by 1.4.

1.4 * 90 = 126. 130 - 126 = 4. So 4/1.4 = 2.857. So 92.857, which is approximately 92.86 units. So q ≈ 92.86.

But looking at the options, the after-tax q* is given as 93 in option B, 97 in option C, 88 in D, etc.

So perhaps it's 93, which is option B's second q*. Let's check option B: q* = 100 (pre-tax), and after tax, q* =93, P*=10.36.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, the price after tax would be calculated using the original demand function, right? Because the tax affects the cost, not the demand. So P = 15 - 0.05q. So with q ≈93, P would be 15 - 0.05*93.

0.05 *93 is 4.65. So 15 -4.65 =10.35. So approximately 10.35. But in the options, option B has P*=10.36. That might be due to rounding.

So part a: q*=100, P*=10.

Part b: q*≈93, P*=10.36.

Looking at the options, option B is q*=100, P*=10; with tax, q*=93, P*=10.36.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the profit-maximizing quantity and price for the firm without any tax. The demand function is given as \( P = 15 - 0.05q \), and the total cost function is \( TC = q + 0.02q^2 \). 

### Part (a): Profit Maximization Without Tax
1. **Marginal Revenue (MR)**:  
   Total revenue is \( TR = P \cdot q = (15 - 0.05q)q = 15q - 0.05q^2 \).  
   Taking the derivative of \( TR \) with respect to \( q \), we get:  
   \[
   MR = \frac{d(TR)}{dq} = 15 - 0.10q.
   \]

2. **Marginal Cost (MC)**:  
   Taking the derivative of \( TC \) with respect to \( q \), we get:  
   \[
   MC = \frac{d(TC)}{dq} = 1 + 0.04q.
   \]

3. **Profit-Maximizing Condition**:  
   At the profit-maximizing point, \( MR = MC \):  
   \[
   15 - 0.10q = 1 + 0.04q.
   \]  
   Solving for \( q \):  
   \[
   15 - 1 = 0.10q + 0.04q \implies 14 = 0.14q \implies q = \frac{14}{0.14} = 100.
   \]

4. **Price at Profit-Maximizing Quantity**:  
   Using the demand function \( P = 15 - 0.05q \):  
   \[
   P = 15 - 0.05(100) = 15 - 5 = 10.
   \]

Thus, the profit-maximizing quantity is \( q^* = 100 \), and the corresponding price is \( P^* = 10 \).

---

### Part (b): Profit Maximization With a $1/Unit Tax
1. **New Marginal Cost (MC)**:  
   The tax increases the firm's marginal cost by $1 per unit. The new \( MC \) becomes:  
   \[
   MC_{\text{new}} = 1 + 0.04q + 1 = 2 + 0.04q.
   \]

2. **Profit-Maximizing Condition With Tax**:  
   Setting \( MR = MC_{\text{new}} \):  
   \[
   15 - 0.10q = 2 + 0.04q.
   \]  
   Solving for \( q \):  
   \[
   15 - 2 = 0.10q + 0.04q \implies 13 = 0.14q \implies q = \frac{13}{0.14} \approx 92.86.
   \]  
   Rounding to the nearest whole number, \( q^* \approx 93 \).

3. **Price at the New Profit-Maximizing Quantity**:  
   Using the demand function \( P = 15 - 0.05q \):  
   \[
   P = 15 - 0.05(93) = 15 - 4.65 = 10.35.
   \]  
   Rounding to two decimal places, \( P^* \approx 10.36 \).

---

### Final Answer
- Without tax: \( q^* = 100 \), \( P^* = 10 \).  
- With tax: \( q^* = 93 \), \( P^* = 10.36 \).  

Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is **B**.
