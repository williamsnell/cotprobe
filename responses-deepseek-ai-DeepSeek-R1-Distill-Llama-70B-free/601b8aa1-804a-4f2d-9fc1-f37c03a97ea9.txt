Question:

A shopper suffered injuries to her back and legs when she slipped on a loose piece of carpeting in a hallway connecting a department store and a cafeteria. The shopper brought suit against the owner of the entire building. The owner claimed that since he leased the cafeteria, he no longer retained any control over the connecting hallway. If the shopper offers into evidence the fact that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid, the court should rule that the evidence is

Options:

A: admissible, because it shows the owner's responsibility for maintaining safe conditions.
B: inadmissible, because the owner's actions after the accident do not pertain to the conditions at the time of the accident.
C: inadmissible, because it is evidence of a good deed by the owner after the accident.
D: inadmissible, because it is speculation about the owner's control over the hallway.
E: admissible, because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway.
F: admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.
G: admissible, because it demonstrates the owner's negligence in not maintaining the hallway previously.
H: admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.
I: inadmissible, because the evidence is irrelevant to the accident.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about evidence admissibility, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The situation is a shopper who got injured because she slipped on a loose piece of carpet in a hallway that connects a department store and a cafeteria. She's suing the owner of the entire building. The owner's defense is that he leased the cafeteria, so he doesn't control the hallway anymore.

Now, the shopper is trying to introduce evidence that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid. The question is whether this evidence is admissible.

Hmm. I remember that in evidence law, certain events that happen after the fact can be admissible or not, depending on the purpose for which they're offered. One key concept that comes to mind is the "subsequent remedial measure." I think that's under Federal Rule of Evidence 407.

From what I recall, Rule 407 says that evidence of a subsequent remedial measure—like fixing something after an accident—is generally not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. But there are exceptions. For example, it can be used to show ownership or control, or if it's offered for another purpose like feasibility of precautionary measures, but not to prove negligence itself.

In this case, the owner is claiming he didn't control the hallway because he leased the cafeteria. The shopper is introducing the fact that the owner re-laid the carpet two days later. So what's the purpose here? It seems like the shopper is trying to show that the owner had control over the hallway because he took action to fix it after the accident.

So, under Rule 407, the evidence is admissible for purposes other than showing negligence. If the evidence is to show that the owner had control or responsibility for the area, then it's allowed. Because the owner's action of re-laying the carpet could indicate that he had the authority to make changes, which supports the idea that he was in control of the hallway.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's admissible because it shows responsibility for safe conditions. That sounds like it's trying to prove negligence, which would be barred under 407. So A might not be the right choice.

Option E says it's admissible because it proves the owner had the power to make changes. That fits because it's showing control, which is an allowed purpose.

Option F says it's admissible because it shows retained ownership and control. That's similar to E but maybe broader. Ownership isn't the issue; control is. So F could be correct too.

Option G says it's admissible to show negligence in not maintaining earlier. That's probably inadmissible because it's using the remedial measure to prove prior negligence, which is what 407 prohibits.

Options B, C, D, H, I are other possibilities. B says it's inadmissible because it doesn't pertain to conditions at the time. But if it's about control, which is a current issue, then it's relevant. So B is not correct.

Option C says it's a good deed, which is the classic reason for excluding subsequent measures. But here, it's being used for a different purpose.

Option D says it's speculation about control. I don't think so; the action of re-laying suggests actual control.

Option H says it shows knowledge of the unsafe condition. Not exactly. The owner could have fixed it without knowing beforehand. It's more about control.

Option I says it's irrelevant. No, because control is a key issue in the case.

So the correct options are E and F. Now, looking at the options again, E says it proves the power to make changes, and F says it shows ownership and control.

Wait, the owner's defense is that he leased the cafeteria and thus doesn't control the hallway. So the shopper needs to show that the owner did have control. The fact that the owner re-laid the carpet after the accident would be evidence that he had control because he was able to make changes. So that would make the evidence admissible for the purpose of showing control, not for showing negligence.

So between E and F: E is about the power to make changes, which relates to control. F is about retained ownership and control.

I think E is more precise because it's about the ability to make changes, which directly relates to control over the premises. So the answer should be E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding a subsequent remedial measure under Federal Rule of Evidence 407. The shopper seeks to introduce evidence that the building owner re-laid the hallway carpet two days after her accident. The owner claims he had no control over the hallway due to leasing the cafeteria. The key issue is whether this evidence is admissible and for what purpose.

Under Rule 407, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct but may be admissible for other purposes, such as showing ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures. Here, the shopper is offering the evidence to demonstrate that the owner had control over the hallway, as the owner's action of re-laying the carpet suggests the ability to make changes to the premises.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While it suggests the evidence shows responsibility for safe conditions, this implies proving negligence, which is barred under Rule 407.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The evidence pertains to the issue of control, which is relevant to the case.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The evidence is not being offered as a "good deed" but to show control.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The evidence does not rely on speculation; it directly indicates the owner's ability to make changes.
- **Option E**: Correct. The evidence is admissible to show the owner's power to make changes, which demonstrates control over the hallway.
- **Option F**: Close but less precise. While it mentions ownership and control, the focus is on control, which is better captured by Option E.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The evidence is not being used to prove prior negligence, which would be prohibited.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The evidence does not directly show the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The evidence is relevant to the issue of control, which is central to the case.

The best answer is **E**, as it accurately reflects the purpose of the evidence: to demonstrate the owner's control over the hallway by showing the ability to make changes.

Answer: E
