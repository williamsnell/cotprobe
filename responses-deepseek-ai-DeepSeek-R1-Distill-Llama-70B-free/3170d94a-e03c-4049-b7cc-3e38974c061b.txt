Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. The question is about drawing 4 cards from a standard deck of 52 and finding the chance that all four are aces, specifically as the first four cards. Hmm, let's break this down.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of drawing specific cards without replacement, combinations are key. Because the order in which you draw the cards matters in some cases, but in this problem, since we're looking for the first four being aces, the order might not matter in terms of selection. Wait, no, actually, when you're drawing one after another, each draw affects the next, so maybe I should think in terms of sequential probabilities.

Wait, alternatively, since we're just looking for the first four cards being aces, regardless of order, maybe I can think of it as a combination problem. So the total number of possible ways to draw 4 cards from 52 is combination 52 choose 4. The number of favorable outcomes is combination 4 choose 4, since there are exactly 4 aces in the deck.

So the probability would be (4 choose 4) divided by (52 choose 4). Let me calculate that. But wait, alternatively, I could think of it step by step. The first card has a 4/52 chance of being an ace. Then, the second card would be 3/51, because one ace is already taken. Third would be 2/50, and the fourth would be 1/49. So multiplying these together: (4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) * (1/49).

Wait, but does that give the same result as the combination approach? Let me see. The combination approach gives (4!/(4!0!)) / (52!/(4!48!)) ) which simplifies to 1 / (52 choose 4). Hmm, let me compute 52 choose 4. 52*51*50*49/(4*3*2*1) = (52*51*50*49)/(24). Let me compute that. 52*51 is 2652, 2652*50 is 132600, 132600*49 is 132600*49. Let me calculate that step by step. 132600 * 50 would be 6,630,000, subtract 132600 to get 6,497,400. So 52 choose 4 is 270725. Wait, no, wait, 52 choose 4 is 270725? Let me check that again because I might have miscalculated.

Wait, 52 choose 4 is 52*51*50*49/(4*3*2*1) = (52*51*50*49)/24. Let me compute each step:

52 divided by 4 is 13. Then 13 *51 = 663. 663 *50 = 33150. 33150 *49 = let's compute 33150 *50 = 1,657,500, minus 33150 gives 1,624,350. Now divide by 24: 1,624,350 /24. Let's do that division. 24 * 67,500 = 1,620,000. So 1,624,350 -1,620,000 = 4,350. 4,350 /24 = 181.25. So total is 67,500 + 181.25 = 67,681.25? Wait, that can't be right because I know 52 choose 4 is 270725. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the calculation steps.

Wait, let's compute (52 *51 *50 *49) first. 52 *51 is 2652. 2652 *50 is 132600. 132600 *49: Let me compute 132600 *50 =6,630,000, minus 132600 gives 6,630,000 -132,600 = 6,497,400. Now divide 6,497,400 by 24. Let me see: 24 * 270,000 = 6,480,000. Subtract that from 6,497,400, which leaves 17,400. 24 * 725 = 17,400. So 270,000 + 725 = 270,725. Yes, so 52 choose 4 is 270,725.

So the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since 4 aces is only one combination), so the probability is 1 / 270725. Let me compute that as a decimal. 1 divided by 270725 equals approximately 0.000003694. Wait, but that's 3.694e-6, which is 0.000003694. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: the probability of drawing four aces in a row is 4/52 * 3/51 * 2/50 * 1/49. Let me compute that. 4/52 is 1/13 ≈0.076923. 3/51 is 1/17 ≈0.058824. 2/50 is 0.04. 1/49 ≈0.020408. Multiply all together: 0.076923 * 0.058824 = approximately 0.004536. Then multiply by 0.04: 0.0001814. Then multiply by 0.020408: 0.00000369. So about 0.00000369, which is 0.000369% chance.

Wait, but the options don't have this number. The options start at 0.000057 as option A. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Oh wait, perhaps I should have considered that the four aces can be drawn in any order in the first four cards. So instead of just one specific sequence (ace first, then another, etc.), any permutation of the four aces in the first four draws would count. So, how many such permutations are there? For four aces, it's 4! = 24 ways. So the number of favorable ordered outcomes is 24. But wait, no, in the combination approach, we considered combinations, not permutations. So maybe I should instead think in terms of ordered draws.

Wait, perhaps another way: the total possible sequences for four cards is 52 *51*50*49, since each draw reduces the deck by one and order matters. The favorable sequences are 4! =24, since there are 4 aces and each can be arranged in any order in the four draws. So the probability would be 24 / (52*51*50*49).

Let me compute that denominator: 52*51 is 2652, 2652*50=132600, 132600*49=6,497,400. So 24 divided by 6,497,400 is approximately 0.000003694, same as before. So about 0.000003694, which is 0.0003694%.

Looking back at the options, I don't see that. The options are all like 0.000057, 0.000037, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, maybe the question is about drawing four aces in any order, not necessarily the first four being in a specific order. Wait, no, the question says the first four cards, so any permutation of the four aces in those four positions would count. So the probability is 4!/(52*51*50*49) = 24/(52*51*50*49) = 24/6497400 ≈ 3.694e-6, which is 0.000003694.

But none of the options match that. The closest is option B: 0.000037, which is an order of magnitude higher. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the probability that the four aces are among the first four cards, regardless of their order. So that's a combination problem where the order doesn't matter. So the number of favorable combinations is 1 (only one set of four aces), and the total possible combinations are 52 choose 4, which is 270725. So the probability is 1/270725 ≈ 3.69e-6, same as before.

But again, none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: "the chance of drawing the 4 aces as the first 4 cards." So the order might not matter, but in the case of the first four cards, maybe they have to be in order, but that's not how I'm interpreting it. Wait, no, when you draw four cards, the order doesn't matter unless specified. So perhaps the correct approach is combinations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1 divided by 270725, which is approximately 3.694e-6, which is 0.000003694. But looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.000037, which is 3.7e-5, ten times higher. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 52 choose 4. Let me double-check that. 52 choose 4 is 52*51*50*49/(4*3*2*1) = (52*51*50*49)/24.

Compute 52*51=2652, 2652*50=132600, 132600*49=6,497,400. Divide by 24: 6,497,400 /24. Let's compute 24*270,725 = 6,497,400. So 6,497,400 divided by 24 is indeed 270,725. So 1/270,725 is approximately 0.000003694.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about four specific aces in the first four cards, but that's essentially the same as all four aces. So I'm confused because none of the options match this number.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the decimal. Let me compute 1 divided by 270,725 accurately.

Compute 1/270725:

Let me try to compute this. 270725 × 3 = 812,175; 270725 × 3.6 would be around 974,610. Let me see, 270725 × 3.694 is approximately 1,000,000. So 1/270725 is approximately 0.000003694.

Wait, maybe the options are in a different format. Let me look at the options again:

Options are:

A: 0.000057

B: 0.000037

C: 0.000107

D: 0.000077

E: 0.000007

F: 0.000097

G: 0.000027

H: 0.000047

I: 0.000017

J: 0.000002

Hmm, none of these are 0.000003694. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the probability that all four aces are drawn in the first four cards, but not necessarily in order. So in that case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 aces, which is 1, divided by the number of ways to choose any 4 cards from 52, which is 270725. So 1/270725 ≈ 0.000003694, which is 0.0003694%.

But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the probability that the first four cards include all four aces, but they can be in any order. So that would be the same as the combinations approach, giving 1/270725.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about permutations, where the aces can be in any order in the first four draws. So the number of favorable permutations would be 4! (since each ace can be arranged in any order), and the total number of possible permutations when drawing four cards is 52*51*50*49.

So the probability would be 4!/(52*51*50*49) = 24/(52*51*50*49) = 24/6497400 ≈ 3.694e-6, which is the same as before.

So again, 0.000003694, which isn't among the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the problem as four aces in the first four, but maybe it's four aces in any four cards, not necessarily the first four. No, the question says "as the first four cards," so that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of aces. Wait, no, a standard deck has four aces, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using combinations when I should be using permutations, but that doesn't seem to change the result much.

Wait, let's try another approach. The probability that the first card is an ace is 4/52. Then, given that, the second card is 3/51, third 2/50, fourth 1/49. So the probability is (4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49) = (4*3*2*1)/(52*51*50*49) ) = 24/(52*51*50*49) = same as before, 24/6,497,400 ≈ 3.694e-6.

So same result.

Wait, maybe I should compute this as a product step by step:

4/52 = 1/13 ≈ 0.07692308

3/51 = 1/17 ≈ 0.05882353

2/50 = 0.04

1/49 ≈ 0.02040816

Multiply all together:

0.07692308 * 0.05882353 = approx 0.07692308 * 0.05882353.

Let me compute 0.07692308 * 0.05882353:

0.07692308 * 0.05 = 0.003846154

0.07692308 * 0.00882353 ≈ Let me compute 0.07692308 * 0.008 = 0.00061538464, and 0.07692308 * 0.00082353 ≈ approx 0.0000633.

Adding together: 0.003846154 + 0.00061538464 ≈ 0.00446153864, plus 0.0000633 is around 0.0045248.

Then multiply by 0.04: 0.0045248 * 0.04 ≈ 0.000181.

Then multiply by 0.02040816: 0.000181 * 0.02040816 ≈ 0.000003694.

Same result as before. So I'm confident the probability is approximately 0.000003694, which is 0.0003694%.

But none of the options match this. So I'm thinking maybe the question was about drawing four aces in any four-card draw, not necessarily the first four. Wait, but the question explicitly says "as the first four cards."

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering replacement. Wait, the problem says without replacement, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are written in a different notation. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.000057

B: 0.000037

C: 0.000107

D: 0.000077

E: 0.000007

F: 0.000097

G: 0.000027

H: 0.000047

I: 0.000017

J: 0.000002

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a decimal place. Let me see: 0.000003694 is 3.694e-6, which is 0.000003694. So the options are all in the range of 0.000002 to 0.000107, which is 1e-6 to 1e-4. So my answer is about 3.69e-6, which is 0.00000369. The closest option is B: 0.000037, which is 3.7e-5, ten times higher. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of probabilities differently. Let me try another approach.

The probability that the first four cards are all aces is the same as the number of ways to arrange four aces in the first four positions, divided by the total number of ways to arrange any four cards in the first four positions.

The total number of possible sequences for the first four cards is 52 *51 *50 *49, as each card is drawn without replacement.

The number of favorable sequences is 4! (since there are four aces and each can be arranged in any order in the first four positions).

So probability is 4!/(52*51*50*49) = 24/(52*51*50*49) = 24/6,497,400 = approx 0.000003694.

Same result again.

Wait, maybe the confusion is between combinations and permutations. Let me think: if I use combinations, the probability is (4 choose 4)/(52 choose 4) = 1/270725 ≈ 0.000003694.

If I use permutations, it's (4!)/(52 P 4), which is 24/(52*51*50*49) = same as above.

So both methods give the same result, which is 0.000003694.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the question is intended to be solved differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability of getting four aces in four draws, without considering the order, which is the combination approach, giving 1/270725 ≈ 0.000003694.

But if none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is about four aces in the first four cards, but considering that each subsequent card is an ace given the previous ones were. So, let's compute:

Probability first card is ace: 4/52.

Second card is ace: 3/51.

Third: 2/50.

Fourth: 1/49.

Multiply all together: (4*3*2*1)/(52*51*50*49) = 24/(52*51*50*49) = same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the total number of possible four-card hands: 52 choose 4 = 270725. Only one of those hands is all four aces. So the probability is 1/270725 ≈
