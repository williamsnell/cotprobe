Okay, so I have this accounting problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The Adam Manufacturing Co. distributes its overhead using the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. Hmm, I remember that prime cost is the sum of direct materials and direct labor. So, the first thing I need to find is the total prime cost.

The given data is:
- Total overhead = $44,733
- Total direct labor = $185,600
- Total materials used = $54,900

So, part (a) asks for the overhead percent of prime cost. To find this, I think I need to calculate the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost and then convert that into a percentage.

Wait, right, prime cost is direct materials plus direct labor. So let me add those two. Direct materials are $54,900 and direct labor is $185,600. So, 54,900 + 185,600 equals... let me calculate that. 54,900 plus 185,600 is 240,500. Okay, so the total prime cost is $240,500.

Now, the overhead percentage would be (total overhead / total prime cost) * 100. So that's 44,733 divided by 240,500. Let me do that division. Let me see, 44,733 ÷ 240,500. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this.

Wait, maybe I can approximate it. 44,733 is about 45k, and 240,500 is about 240k. So 45/240 is 0.1875, which is 18.75%. But that's a rough estimate. Let me do the exact calculation.

44,733 ÷ 240,500. Let me write this as a decimal. 44,733 ÷ 240,500. Let me see, 240,500 × 0.185 is how much? 240,500 × 0.185. 0.1 times 240,500 is 24,050. 0.08 times is 19,240. 0.005 is 1,202.5. Adding these together: 24,050 + 19,240 is 43,290. Plus 1,202.5 is 44,492.5. Oh, that's close to 44,733. So the exact value is a little higher than 0.185. The difference between 44,733 and 44,492.5 is 240.5. So 240.5 divided by 240,500 is 0.001. So approximately 0.186, which is 18.6%. So the overhead percentage is approximately 18.6%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the options might have 18.6% as option G, let me check the options again. Oh, looking at the options, option G is 18.6%, and the charge is $6,063.60. Hmm.

Now, part (b) asks for the overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of $32,600. So, the overhead is applied based on the overhead percentage we just found. So, the overhead charge would be the overhead percentage multiplied by the department's prime cost.

So, 18.6% of $32,600. Let me calculate that. 18.6% is 0.186 as a decimal. 32,600 × 0.186. Hmm, let's compute this.

Breaking it down: 32,600 × 0.1 is 3,260. 32,600 × 0.08 is 2,608. 32,600 × 0.006 is 195.6. Now, adding these up: 3,260 + 2,608 = 5,868. Plus 195.6 is 6,063.6. So, the overhead charge is $6,063.60.

Looking back at the options, option G is 18.6% and $6,063.60. So that's the correct choice.

Wait a second, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Total prime cost: 54,900 + 185,600 = 240,500. That seems right.

Overhead percentage: 44,733 / 240,500 = let's compute it more accurately. Let me do exact division.

44,733 ÷ 240,500 = ?

Let me compute 44,733 ÷ 240,500.

Let me write it as 44733 ÷ 240500 = ?

I can simplify both numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by, say, 100: 447.33 / 2405.

Alternatively, maybe compute it step by step.

Compute 240500 × 0.18 = 43,290.

Subtract that from 44,733: 44,733 - 43,290 = 1,443.

So, 0.18 gives 43,290. Now, 1,443 ÷ 240,500 = ?

1,443 ÷ 240,500 = approximately 0.006.

So, 0.18 + 0.006 = 0.186, which is 18.6%.

So that's correct.

Then, for part (b), 0.186 × 32,600 = 6,063.6, which matches.

So the correct answer should be option G: 18.6%, $6,063.60.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total prime cost, which is the sum of direct materials and direct labor:

\[
\text{Total Prime Cost} = \text{Direct Materials} + \text{Direct Labor} = \$54,900 + \$185,600 = \$240,500.
\]

Next, we determine the overhead percentage of prime cost by dividing the total overhead by the total prime cost and converting it to a percentage:

\[
\text{Overhead Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Overhead}}{\text{Total Prime Cost}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$44,733}{\$240,500} \right) \times 100 \approx 18.6\%.
\]

For part (b), we calculate the overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of \$32,600 by multiplying the overhead percentage by the department's prime cost:

\[
\text{Overhead Charge} = \text{Overhead Percentage} \times \text{Department's Prime Cost} = 0.186 \times \$32,600 = \$6,063.60.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **18.6% and \$6,063.60**, which corresponds to option **G**.
