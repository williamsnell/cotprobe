Okay, so I've got this combinatorics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is asking for the sum of all integers k such that the combination of 23 choose 4 plus 23 choose 5 equals 24 choose k. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember something about the properties of combinations, like Pascal's Triangle. Oh right, Pascal's identity says that C(n, k) + C(n, k+1) = C(n+1, k+1). So maybe that applies here.

Let me look at the given equation: C(23,4) + C(23,5) = C(24,k). According to Pascal's identity, C(23,4) + C(23,5) should equal C(24,5), right? Because when you add two consecutive combinations from the same n, you get the combination at n+1 and the same lower index as the higher term in the sum. So in this case, 4 and 5 add up to give 5 in the next row, which is 24.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure. So Pascal's identity is C(n, k) + C(n, k+1) = C(n+1, k+1). So if my n is 23, and I'm adding C(23,4) and C(23,5), that would be k=4 and k+1=5. So the sum should be C(24,5). So that would mean k is 5, right?

But wait the question says "the sum of all integers k". So is there only one possible k here? Because combinations have unique values for different k in a given n. So if C(24,k) equals that sum, then k must be 5.

Wait, but wait again. Because sometimes combinations have symmetries. Like C(n, k) = C(n, n-k). So for example, C(24,5) is equal to C(24, 24-5) which is C(24,19). Oh right! So if C(24,5) is the same as C(24,19), then k could be 5 or 19. So that means there are two possible values for k: 5 and 19.

So the sum of all such integers k would be 5 + 19. Let me calculate that: 5+19 is 24. So the sum is 24. Now looking at the options, option F is 24.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes I get confused with the symmetry. So C(n, k) equals C(n, n-k). So for n=24, if k=5, then n-k is 19. So yes, C(24,5)=C(24,19), so both k=5 and k=19 satisfy the equation.

So the possible k's are 5 and 19. Their sum is 5+19=24. So the correct answer should be F:24.

I think that's all. I don't think there are any other k's that satisfy this because the combination function is unique otherwise. So yeah, F is the right choice.

The problem involves finding the sum of all integers \( k \) such that \(\binom{23}{4} + \binom{23}{5} = \binom{24}{k}\). Using Pascal's identity, we know that:

\[
\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1} = \binom{n+1}{k+1}.
\]

Applying this identity to the given equation, we find:

\[
\binom{23}{4} + \binom{23}{5} = \binom{24}{5}.
\]

Thus, \( k = 5 \) is one solution. However, due to the symmetry property of combinations, \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), we also have:

\[
\binom{24}{5} = \binom{24}{19}.
\]

This means \( k = 19 \) is another solution. The sum of all such integers \( k \) is:

\[
5 + 19 = 24.
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 24.**
