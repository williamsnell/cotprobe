Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem about the electronic contribution to the molar Gibbs energy of Cl atoms at 500 K. Hmm, I remember that Gibbs energy change has to do with the energy levels and their populations. Let me think about what I know.

The question says the ground state of Cl is ^2P_{3/2}, and there's another level, ^2P_{1/2}, which is 881 cm^-1 above the ground. I need to calculate the electronic contribution to the Gibbs energy. Oh right, this involves the partition function and then using that to find the Gibbs energy.

First, I should probably figure out the energy difference between these two states. Wait, the energy is given in wavenumbers, so I'll need to convert that into joules or something. I remember that 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986 × 10^-23 J. Let me calculate that.

So energy difference ΔE = 881 cm^-1 * (1.986e-23 J/cm^-1) = let's see, 881 * 1.986e-23. Hmm, 800 * 2e-23 would be 1.6e-20, but more accurately: 881 * 1.986 = let's approximate. 800*1.986=1588.8, and 81*1.986≈160. So about 1748.8? So 1748.8e-23 J, which is 1.7488e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, I think the formula for the Gibbs energy contribution is something like ΔG_electronic = -RT ln(Q), where Q is the partition function. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, the Gibbs energy is related to the chemical potential, which for electronic states is calculated using the partition function.

Right, the electronic partition function q is the sum over g_i exp(-ε_i/(kT)), where g_i is the degeneracy, ε_i the energy of the state. So here, there are two states: the ground state and the excited one.

Ground state: ^2P_{3/2} has a certain degeneracy. Oh, wait, for a P state, the total angular momentum J can be 3/2 and 1/2. The degeneracy for each term is 2J + 1. So for ^2P_{3/2}, J=3/2, so degeneracy is 2*(3/2)+1 = 4. For ^2P_{1/2}, J=1/2, degeneracy is 2*(1/2)+1=2.

So the ground state has g1=4, ε1=0 (since it's the ground state). The excited state has g2=2, ε2=881 cm^-1.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels are relative. So the excited state is at 881 cm^-1, which I've converted to 1.7488e-20 J. But for the partition function, I think I need to express the energy in terms of kT, since the exponent is ε/(kT).

So let's calculate the exponent for the excited state. Let me compute (ε2)/(k T). But wait, what's k here? Boltzmann's constant is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Given T=500 K. So k*T = 1.380649e-23 * 500 = 6.903245e-21 J.

So ε2/(k T) = (1.7488e-20 J) / (6.903245e-21 J) ≈ 2.53. Let me compute it more accurately: 1.7488 / 0.6903245 ≈ 2.53.

So the exponent is about -2.53. So exp(-2.53) is approximately e^-2.53. Let me remember that e^-2 is about 0.135, e^-3 is ~0.05. 2.53 is between them. Let me calculate e^-2.53: 2.53 is 2 + 0.53. e^-2 is 0.1353, e^-0.53 is about 0.588 (since e^0.5≈1.65, e^0.53≈1.7, so e^-0.53≈0.588). So 0.1353 * 0.588 ≈ 0.0796. So exp(-2.53) ≈ 0.0796.

Now the partition function q is g1 * exp(-ε1/(kT)) + g2 * exp(-ε2/(kT)). Since ε1=0, exp(0)=1. So q = 4 * 1 + 2 * exp(-2.53) = 4 + 2*(0.0796) ≈ 4 + 0.1592 ≈ 4.1592.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I'm calculating the correct q. Alternatively, sometimes the ground state is considered at zero energy, so the excited state is at ΔΕ = 881 cm^-1. So the partition function would indeed be q = g1 + g2 * exp(-ΔΕ/(kT)).

Wait, since ΔΕ is in cm^-1, perhaps I should calculate it in terms of kT using the conversion factor. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in terms of wavenumbers and use appropriate constants.

Wait, another approach: since 1 cm^-1 is h c / (k T), wait, no. Let me think about the relation between energy and wavenumbers.

The energy of a state in terms of wavenumbers is E = h c tilde{nu}, where tilde{nu} is the wavenumber. So to get E in J, E = h c * tilde{nu}.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent (ε2)/(k T) in terms of tilde{nu}/(k T / (h c)).

Wait, let me think: Let's compute (tilde{nu}_2) * h c / (k T), which would be the same as (ε2)/(k T).

Because ε2 = h c tilde{nu}_2, so ε2/(k T) = (h c tilde{nu}_2)/(k T) = tilde{nu}_2 / (k T/(h c)).

Wait, what is k T/(h c)? Let me compute that.

k is Boltzmann's constant, h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K,

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s,

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So k T/(h c) = (1.380649e-23 * 500) / (6.62607e-34 * 2.9979e8)

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1.380649e-23 * 500 = 6.903245e-21 J.

Denominator: 6.62607e-34 * 2.9979e8 = approx 1.986e-25 J·m. Wait, J is kg m^2/s^2, so J·m is kg m^3/s^2. Hmm, units might get complicated, but perhaps I can just compute the value.

6.62607e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25.

So denominator ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, but wait, the numerator is in J, denominator in J·m. So when we take k T/(h c), the units would be (J) / (J·m) → 1/m. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute (tilde{nu}_2) / (k T/(h c)) ) = (tilde{nu}_2 * h c) / (k T) ) = ε2/(k T), which we already computed as approximately 2.53.

So perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent as (tilde{nu}_2 * h c)/(k T).

But regardless, I think I've already calculated that the exponent is about 2.53, so exp(-2.53) ≈ 0.0796.

So the partition function q = 4 + 2 * 0.0796 ≈ 4.1592.

Now, the Gibbs energy contribution is given by ΔG = - R T ln(q), but wait, no, wait. Wait, the Gibbs energy per mole is given by ΔG = - R T ln(Q), where Q is the partition function per molecule, but when considering per mole, we multiply by Avogadro's number. Or wait, the formula I remember is that the electronic contribution is (ΔG_elec) = - R T ln(q), where q is the partition function per molecule.

Wait, another thought: for each molecule, the partition function is q. For a mole, the total partition function is Q = q^N / N! (for indistinguishable particles), but when considering the Gibbs free energy, which is an extensive variable, perhaps the expression for the molar Gibbs energy is ΔG = - R T ln(q), because the translational and other contributions are considered separately.

Wait, I think for the electronic contribution, it's calculated using the electronic partition function q, and the Gibbs energy per mole is ΔG = - R T ln(q).

So in this case, q is approximately 4.1592.

So let's compute ln(q). ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.1592) is maybe around 1.425.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. Let's see: e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.42 is about 4.15 (since 1.42 *1 =4.15? Wait, e^1.4 ≈ 4.055, e^1.41 ≈ 4.10, e^1.42 ≈ 4.16. So since q is 4.1592, ln(q) is approximately 1.423.

So ln(q) ≈ 1.423.

Now, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T is 500 K.

So ΔG = - R T ln(q) = -8.314 * 500 * 1.423.

Let me compute 8.314 *500 =4157 J/mol.

4157 * 1.423 ≈ let's compute 4000*1.423=5692, 157*1.423≈223. So total ≈ 5692 + 223=5915 J/mol.

So ΔG ≈ -5915 J/mol → approximately -5.915 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is -5.27, option D is -6.42, option J is -7.35, option E is -9.81.

Wait, my calculation is about -5.9 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's not exactly matching any option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me check each step.

First, the energy of the excited state: 881 cm^-1.

Convert that into J: 881 cm^-1 * h c = ?

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8 m/s.

h*c=6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, but 1 cm^-1 corresponds to 1e2 m^-1? No, wait, 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. So 1 cm^-1 = 100 m^-1.

Wait, but perhaps I should recall that 1 cm^-1 is h c / λ, where λ is in cm. Alternatively, the energy E = h c * tilde{nu}, where tilde{nu} is in cm^-1.

So E = h c * tilde{nu} (in cm^-1) → units of J.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·cm.

Wait, because 1 m = 100 cm, so 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So h c = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e10 cm/s = 1.9878e-23 J·cm.

Ah, that's better. So E = 1.9878e-23 J·cm * tilde{nu} (in cm^-1).

So for tilde{nu}=881 cm^-1, E = 1.9878e-23 * 881 = let me compute that.

1.9878e-23 * 800 = 1.59024e-20,

1.9878e-23 * 81 = approx 1.610e-21,

Total E = 1.59024e-20 + 0.1611e-20 = 1.75134e-20 J.

So E=1.75134e-20 J.

Then, E/(k T) = (1.75134e-20 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K * 500 K).

Compute denominator: 1.380649e-23 *500 =6.903245e-21 J.

So E/(k T) = 1.75134e-20 / 6.903245e-21 ≈ 2.535.

So exp(-2.535) = let's compute it more accurately.

I can use the Taylor series for e^x, but perhaps a better way is to remember that ln(2)≈0.693, ln(8)=2.079, but wait, perhaps using calculator-like steps.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach:

We know that e^-2 = 0.1353, e^-0.535 = ?

Compute 0.535: e^-0.5 ≈0.6065, e^-0.535 = ?

Let me compute 0.535 as 0.5 + 0.035.

e^-0.5 = 0.6065,

e^-0.035 ≈ 1 -0.035 + (0.035)^2/2 - (0.035)^3/6.

Which is approximately 1 -0.035 + 0.0006125 - 0.0000429 ≈ 0.96557.

So e^-0.535 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.035 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.96557 ≈ 0.6065 *0.965 ≈ 0.5857.

Wait, wait, no, that's for e^-0.535. So e^-2.535 = e^-2 * e^-0.535 ≈ 0.1353 * 0.5857 ≈ 0.0792.

So the excited state contributes 2 * 0.0792 = 0.1584.

So q = 4 + 0.1584 = 4.1584.

Wait, that's consistent with what I had earlier.

Now, ln(q) = ln(4.1584).

Let me compute that accurately.

We know that ln(4) = 1.386294,

ln(4.1584) is a bit higher. Let's compute it as follows.

The Taylor expansion for ln(x) around x=4:

But perhaps it's easier to compute using known values.

Alternatively, since 4.1584 is between 4 and e (2.718), wait no, e is about 2.718, but 4 is bigger. Alternatively, perhaps using ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.1)=? Let me compute.

I can use the approximation:

ln(4 + 0.1584) ≈ ln(4) + (0.1584)/(4) → 1.386 + 0.0396 ≈ 1.4256.

Wait, but that's an approximation using the derivative. The actual value might be a bit different, but for the purposes here, let's take ln(4.1584) ≈1.425.

So, R=8.314 J/mol·K,

T=500 K,

So ΔG = - R T ln(q) = -8.314 *500 *1.425.

Compute 8.314 *500 =4157 J/mol.

4157 *1.425 = let's compute that.

4000 *1.425=5700,

157 *1.425 ≈ 157*1=157, 157*0.4=62.8, 157*0.025=3.925.

Adding those, 157 +62.8=219.8 +3.925=223.725.

Total 5700 +223.725=5923.725 J/mol → 5923.725 J is 5.923725 kJ.

So ΔG ≈-5.924 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options:

A: -8.57 kJ/mol

B: -4.12

C: -5.27

D: -6.42

E: -9.81

Wait, none of these are exactly -5.92, but the closest is option C: -5.27 or perhaps option D: -6.42.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the partition function. Let me double-check.

The ground state is ^2P_{3/2}, which has J=3/2, so degeneracy is 2J+1 =4.

The excited state is ^2P_{1/2}, J=1/2, so degeneracy is 2*(1/2)+1=2.

So when calculating q, it's 4*exp(-0) + 2*exp(-E/(kT)).

Which is 4 + 2*exp(-2.535).

exp(-2.535)=0.0792, so 2*0.0792=0.1584.

So q=4.1584.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in the formula for Gibbs energy. Wait, another thought: the formula for the Gibbs energy contribution is ΔG = - R T ln(q) only applies when the ground state is taken as the reference. But perhaps I should have considered the Gibbs energy change relative to the ground state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the electronic Gibbs energy can be calculated using the formula:

ΔG = - R T ln(q) + [some other terms?]

Wait, I think that's correct. So my calculation leads to about -5.92 kJ/mol, but the options
