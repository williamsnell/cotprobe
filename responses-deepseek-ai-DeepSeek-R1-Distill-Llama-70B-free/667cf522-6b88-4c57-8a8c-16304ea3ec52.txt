Question:

A purchasing agent for a women's clothing store negotiated a contract with dressmaking company to purchase a specified quantity of khaki garments at a price of $75,000. One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the purchasing agent acted in good faith.
B: There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.
C: There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.
D: There was no valid contract formed, because the price was not agreed upon by both parties.
E: There was a valid contract formed, because the dressmaking company was responsible for their own error.
F: The contract is invalid, because the purchasing agent took advantage of the dressmaking company's error.
G: There was an enforceable contract at the revised price term, because the error was corrected before delivery.
H: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.
I: There was a voidable contract, because the dressmaking company made an error.
J: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down.

The scenario is about a purchasing agent for a women's clothing store who negotiated a contract with a dressmaking company. The contract was for a specified quantity of khaki garments at a price of $75,000. A week later, the VP of the dressmaking company called and said there was an error in calculating the contract price. They're threatening to not deliver unless the clothing store pays an additional $15,000. The question is about whether the purchasing agent should have known about the error but agreed anyway. And we have to pick the correct statement about the contract's validity.

So the key points here are: mistake in the contract, whether the other party knew or should have known about the mistake, and the implications on the enforceability of the contract.

I remember from my studies that contract law deals with mistakes and how they affect the validity. There's a difference between unilateral and mutual mistakes. Also, whether the mistake was so obvious that the other party should have known about it.

In this case, the purchasing agent should have known that the original price was in error. She agreed to the contract anyway. So, the dressmaking company is trying to enforce a higher price, but the agent might argue that the original contract is still valid.

I think about the concept of "mutual assent" or "meeting of the minds." For a contract to be valid, both parties must agree to the same terms. If one party makes a mistake and the other knows about it or should know, that could affect the enforceability.

Wait, in the case where one party makes a mistake and the other knows about it, the contract might be voidable. Because if someone knows the other party made a mistake, and they take advantage of it, that's not fair. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

So, if the purchasing agent should have known about the error, does that mean the contract is voidable? Because the dressmaking company can argue that they made a mistake, and the other party took advantage. But wait, the purchasing agent agreed to the contract despite knowing the error. So is the contract enforceable at the original price, or can the dressmaking company get out of it?

I recall that for a unilateral mistake (where only one party is mistaken), the contract can be voidable if the other party knew or should have known about the mistake and took advantage. So in this case, since the purchasing agent should have known, the dressmaking company might be able to avoid the contract, or perhaps the contract is voidable at their option.

Looking at the options:

Option B says it's a voidable contract because the purchasing agent should have known of the error. That sounds plausible because she knew or should have known, making the contract one-sided, allowing the dressmaking company to possibly void it.

Option C says there's no valid contract because no mutuality of assent. But wait, the parties did agree to the terms, but one was mistaken. So there might be an issue with consideration or mistake, but mutuality could still exist if both thought they agreed, albeit one was wrong.

Option D says no valid contract because the price wasn't agreed upon. But the price was agreed upon, just mistakenly. So D might not be correct.

Option E says it's valid because the company is responsible for their error. But if the other party knew, that might not hold.

Option F says invalid because the agent took advantage. But I think that's more about whether the contract is voidable, not necessarily invalid.

Option H says enforceable at original price because the mistake was unilateral. Wait, but if it's unilateral and the other party knew, then the contract is voidable. So H might not be correct.

Option I says voidable because the company made an error. But just making an error doesn't automatically make it voidable unless the other party knew or should have known.

So between options B and H. If the purchasing agent should have known, then the contract is voidable at the option of the dressmaking company. So B would be correct.

Alternatively, if the mistake was unilateral, but the other party didn't know, then the contract stands. But here, the agent should have known, so the mistake is unilateral, but the other party is aware. So the contract is voidable.

Wait, let me think again. In contract law, a unilateral mistake (only one party is mistaken) can make the contract voidable if the other party knew or had reason to know of the mistake. So when the purchasing agent knew or should have known about the dressmaker's error, the contract is voidable, meaning the dressmaker can elect to avoid the contract.

So that would point to option B: voidable contract because the agent should have known.

Alternatively, option I says it's voidable because the company made an error, but that's not specific enough. The reason it's voidable is because the other party knew.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically addressing the implications of a unilateral mistake and whether the contract is enforceable when the other party should have known about the error. The key facts are that the purchasing agent negotiated a contract for $75,000, but the dressmaking company later claimed an error in the price and demanded an additional $15,000. The purchasing agent should have known about the error but agreed to the contract anyway.

Under contract law, a unilateral mistake (where only one party is mistaken) can make the contract voidable if the other party knew or should have known about the mistake. In this case, the purchasing agent should have known about the dressmaking company's error, which makes the contract voidable at the option of the dressmaking company. This is because the mistake was not mutual, and the purchasing agent's awareness of the error undermines the fairness of enforcing the contract at the original price.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that the contract is voidable because the purchasing agent should have known about the error, aligning with the principle that a unilateral mistake can make a contract voidable under such circumstances.
- Other options, such as **Option H**, incorrectly assume enforceability at the original price despite the purchasing agent's knowledge of the error, which does not align with the legal principles of unilateral mistakes.

Thus, the most accurate statement is that the contract is voidable because the purchasing agent should have known about the error.

Answer: B
