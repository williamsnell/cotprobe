Question:

Late one night, co-defendants broke into a warehouse and proceeded to load the large crates of appliances onto their truck. As they were leaving, one of the co-defendants inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. At common law, the co-defendants should be found guilty of

Options:

A: burglary and larceny.
B: burglary only.
C: burglary and arson.
D: larceny and arson.
E: burglary, arson, and criminal negligence.
F: burglary, larceny, and arson.
G: arson only.
H: larceny only.
I: larceny, arson, and criminal negligence.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's go through it step by step.

The question is about co-defendants breaking into a warehouse late at night. They load large crates of appliances onto their truck. Then, one of them throws a cigarette butt into a pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. This causes a small fire to start. They have time to put it out without any danger, but they don't. Instead, they leave, and the fire spreads, engulfing the warehouse.

The question is asking what they should be guilty of at common law. The options include various combinations of burglary, larceny, arson, and criminal negligence.

First, I need to remember the elements of each crime under common law.

Starting with burglary: At common law, burglary is the unlawful entry into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony inside. Wait, but a warehouse isn't a dwelling. So, does that mean they didn't commit burglary? Because some jurisdictions may have different rules, but traditionally, burglary requires a dwelling. So if the warehouse is commercial, maybe it's not burglary. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. At common law, burglary was specifically the nighttime breaking and entering into the dwelling house of another with the intent to commit a felony. So if the building isn't a dwelling, like a warehouse, then it wouldn't be burglary. So maybe they didn't commit burglary. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that point.

Next, larceny: Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive. So they took the crates of appliances. So that's larceny. So they're guilty of larceny.

Now, arson: Arson at common law is the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. So again, a warehouse isn't a dwelling. So would the burning of a warehouse be arson? Or is there another form of arson? Wait, maybe I'm wrong. I think under common law, arson applied only to dwellings. But some jurisdictions might have broader definitions, but traditionally, it's dwellings. So if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, maybe it's not arson. But wait, the co-defendants caused a fire which spread. So perhaps they could be charged with some form of arson even if it's not a dwelling? Or maybe under a different theory.

Wait, maybe there's another angle. Even if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, if they recklessly caused a fire that spread, could that be considered arson under a different statute or perhaps criminal negligence? Or maybe they're guilty of arson because they started a fire, regardless of the building type, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's clarify. At common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. So if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, then it wouldn't be arson. But perhaps the act of intentionally setting fire could be considered under a different crime, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, they might be guilty of criminal mischief or some other offense, but that's not one of the options here.

Wait, but the options include arson in some of them. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Did they commit arson? They threw a cigarette butt into a refuse pile, which ignited. Was that an intentional act? Or was it accidental?

Wait, the co-defendant threw the cigarette butt, which then started a fire. But was that intentional? The question says "inadvertently" threw the butt into the pile. So it was an accident. So they didn't intend to start a fire. So if they didn't intend to burn the warehouse, then they didn't have the mens rea for arson, which usually requires intent. But wait, maybe they can be held criminally negligent.

Alternatively, maybe they're guilty of arson under the theory of reckless endangerment or some other form, but I'm not sure. At common law, I think intent was required. So without intent, it's not arson.

So if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, then they didn't commit burglary. They did commit larceny. And for the fire, maybe they're guilty of criminal negligence because they didn't extinguish it when they could have, leading to the spread. But criminal negligence isn't one of the charges in the options except for E and I.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: burglary and larceny.

But if burglary requires a dwelling, and the warehouse isn't, then A would be wrong.

B: burglary only. Probably not, since they took property, so larceny should apply.

C: burglary and arson. Again, if no burglary and maybe no arson, this is wrong.

D: larceny and arson. If arson isn't applicable, then D is wrong.

E: burglary, arson, and criminal negligence. Unlikely because of the burglary and arson issues.

F: burglary, larceny, and arson. Again, burglary and arson may not apply.

G: arson only. Doesn't fit because they committed larceny.

H: larceny only. But perhaps they are guilty of more.

I: larceny, arson, and criminal negligence. If arson doesn't apply, then I is out.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the burglary part. Let me think again. At common law, burglary was breaking and entering a dwelling at night with intent to commit a felony. So if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, then it's not burglary. So they broke into a warehouse, which is a structure but not a dwelling. So no burglary. Therefore, the burglary option is out.

So they committed larceny. Now, what about the fire? Since they started it inadvertently, but then didn't put it out. So could they be guilty of arson? Or is it criminal negligence?

Wait, the fire was started by accident, but they had the chance to put it out and didn't. So maybe they're guilty of arson if the fire was a foreseeable result of their actions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps they are guilty of arson because they were reckless in causing the fire, even if it started by accident.

Wait, the initial act was throwing a cigarette butt into a flammable pile. That seems reckless, not intentional. So perhaps they're guilty of reckless arson, but at common law, I think intent was required. So maybe they didn't have the intent, so no arson.

Wait, but the question says "inadvertently" threw the butt, implying it was accidental. So perhaps they didn't have the intent to start a fire, so no arson. But then, their failure to act could be criminal negligence.

But the options don't have criminal negligence except E and I. So if they are guilty of larceny, and possibly criminal negligence, but not burglary or arson, then the answer might not be listed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the burglary. Let me think again. Some jurisdictions might consider a warehouse as a 'structure' and have different rules. But under common law, burglary was specifically about dwellings.

Wait, maybe the initial breaking and entering was with the intent to commit larceny, which is a felony. So even though the warehouse isn't a dwelling, if the law in the question considers it as such, perhaps it's burglary. Or perhaps the question is considering a broader definition.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what each crime requires.

Burglary: Unlawful entry into a dwelling at night with intent to commit a felony.

If the warehouse is a business, it's not a dwelling, so no burglary. So they're not guilty of burglary.

Larceny: They took the appliances, so yes, larceny.

Arson: They didn't intend to set the fire, so no. Unless their action was so reckless that it's equivalent to intent. But common law arson requires intent.

So maybe they're not guilty of arson. So what about the fire? Since they caused it, but not intentionally, perhaps they are guilty of criminal negligence, but that's a separate offense. But the options don't include criminal negligence as a standalone.

Looking back at the options:

E: burglary, arson, and criminal negligence.

I: larceny, arson, and criminal negligence.

But if they didn't commit burglary or arson, then those options are out.

Wait, but maybe the initial act of breaking in was with intent to commit larceny, which is a felony. So they committed burglary because they entered with intent to commit larceny, which is a felony. But wait, only if the place is a dwelling. If it's a warehouse, not a dwelling, then no burglary.

Wait, but some jurisdictions may have expanded burglary beyond dwellings. But the question specifies "at common law," so I think it's about the traditional definition.

So, under common law:

- No burglary (since it's a warehouse, not a dwelling)
- Larceny (they took property)
- No arson (no intent to burn)
- Possibly criminal negligence for not extinguishing the fire.

But the options don't have an option with just larceny and criminal negligence. So maybe the answer is H: larceny only.

But wait, the fire caused damage. So perhaps there's another crime involved. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps they can be charged with arson under the theory that they recklessly caused the fire, leading to the burning of the warehouse. But at common law, I think intent was required, so reckless might not suffice.

Alternatively, perhaps they are guilty of arson because the fire they started (even accidentally) spread beyond their control, leading to the destruction of the warehouse. But I'm not sure about the common law stance on that.

Wait, another angle: the co-defendants created a fire, which then spread. So, perhaps they are guilty of arson because they started a fire, regardless of intent. But that doesn't fit with the common law requirement of malicious intent.

Alternatively, maybe their failure to extinguish the fire when they could have constitutes a separate offense, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's look at the options again. The options are:

A: burglary and larceny.

B: burglary only.

C: burglary and arson.

D: larceny and arson.

E: burglary, arson, and criminal negligence.

F: burglary, larceny, and arson.

G: arson only.

H: larceny only.

I: larceny, arson, and criminal negligence.

So, if they didn't commit burglary, then options A, B, C, E, F are out. So it's between D, G, H, I.

They definitely committed larceny, so G is out. So between D, H, I.

If they didn't commit arson, then D and I are out, leaving H as the answer. But I'm not entirely sure about arson.

Wait, perhaps starting a fire, even inadvertently, could lead to liability. But at common law, I think arson required intent. So without intent, no arson.

Wait, but perhaps under the doctrine of transferred intent, but that usually applies to offenses against the person, not property crimes.

Alternatively, maybe they are guilty of arson because they committed an act that was inherently dangerous and likely to cause a fire, showing a reckless disregard. But again, common law arson requires malice, which can be express or implied. Express malice is intent to burn; implied malice is when the burning is done in the commission of another felony, like burglary.

Wait, but in this case, they were committing larceny. So if they committed arson in the commission of larceny, does that make it arson? Or does the felony have to be independent?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down.

At common law, arson is malicious burning of a dwelling. Malice can be express (intent to burn) or implied (when committed in the commission of a felony, like burglary). But in this case, the felony would be larceny, which is a lesser felony.

Wait, but if the arson was committed during the commission of larceny, does that make it arson with implied malice? Or is it that the underlying felony has to be something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the act of starting the fire during the commission of larceny could make the arson impliedly malicious because it's done in the commission of another felony.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think that under common law, the burning had to be intentional. So if they didn't intend to start the fire, then it's not arson.

So, to recap:

- No burglary (warehouse not a dwelling)
- Larceny (yes)
- Arson (no, because no intent)
- Criminal negligence (possibly, but not an option unless in E or I)

So the only crime they've definitely committed is larceny, which would make the answer H.

But wait, the fire caused the warehouse to burn down. So perhaps they are guilty of arson under a different theory, like reckless conduct leading to arson.

Wait, perhaps the initial act was reckless, so even without intent, they could be guilty. But I'm not sure if common law arson allows for reckless conduct.

Alternatively, maybe the spreading of the fire leads to the destruction of the warehouse, which is a structure, so perhaps that's arson under a different statute. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the act of leaving without extinguishing the fire constitutes criminal negligence. So they were under a duty to act, and their failure caused harm. So that could be criminal negligence, but I don't know if that's part of the options.

Looking back, the only option that includes larceny without burglary or arson is H. So I'm leaning towards H: larceny only.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the initial entry into the warehouse with intent to commit larceny constitutes burglary, regardless of whether it's a dwelling. Wait, no, at common law, burglary required a dwelling. So if it's a warehouse, it's not burglary.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the warehouse as part of the curtilage of a dwelling, but that's stretching it.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is likely H: larceny only.

At common law, the co-defendants' actions must be analyzed according to the elements of the crimes listed in the options:

1. **Burglary**: At common law, burglary requires the unlawful entry into a **dwelling** at night with the intent to commit a felony inside. Since the warehouse is a commercial structure and not a dwelling, the co-defendants did not commit burglary. Therefore, any option including burglary (A, B, C, E, F) is incorrect.

2. **Larceny**: Larceny involves the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive. The co-defendants took the crates of appliances, satisfying the elements of larceny. Thus, larceny is clearly applicable.

3. **Arson**: At common law, arson requires the **malicious burning of a dwelling**. The warehouse is not a dwelling, and the fire was started inadvertently when a co-defendant threw a cigarette butt into a refuse pile. Since the fire was accidental and not intentional, the co-defendants did not have the requisite intent (malice) for arson. Therefore, options including arson (C, D, F, I) are incorrect.

4. **Criminal Negligence**: The co-defendants failed to extinguish the fire, which spread and destroyed the warehouse. While this could potentially constitute criminal negligence, the question does not explicitly include criminal negligence as a standalone offense in the options. Moreover, the focus of the question appears to be on burglary, larceny, and arson.

Given the analysis, the co-defendants are guilty of **larceny only**, as they unlawfully took the appliances, and there is no basis for burglary or arson under the facts provided.
