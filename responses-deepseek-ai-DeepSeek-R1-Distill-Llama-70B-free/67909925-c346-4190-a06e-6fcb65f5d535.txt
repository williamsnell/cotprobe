Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about standing waves on a string attached to a vibrating speaker. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question is, why doesn't a speaker frequency of 60 Hz produce standing waves in the string. The options are from A to J. I remember that standing waves have specific conditions. Oh right, the ends of the string have to be fixed or something, and the length of the string must be just right relative to the wavelength.

Wait, standing waves form when the string is vibrating at one of its harmonic frequencies. Those harmonics are determined by the string's length, tension, and linear mass density. The formula I think is v = sqrt(T/μ), where v is wave speed, T is tension, and μ is linear mass density.

Standing waves occur when the wavelength is such that an integer number of half-wavelengths fit into the string's length. So the condition is L = nλ/2, where L is string length, n is an integer (like 1,2,3...), and λ is the wavelength.

So the frequency of the standing wave depends on the wave speed and the wavelength. Frequency f is related by f = v / λ.

So if the speaker is producing a frequency of 60 Hz, but no standing waves happen, that must mean that 60 Hz isn't one of the string's natural harmonic frequencies. Oh wait, the string has its own set of natural frequencies, right? Those are called the harmonics, and they're given by f_n = n v / (2L), where n is an integer.

So for standing waves to form, the speaker's frequency has to match one of these f_n's. If it doesn't, then the string won't vibrate in a standing wave pattern.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option D says the string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength. Wait, no, I thought it was that the string length is a multiple of half the wavelength. Because L = nλ/2. So n is an integer, so L must be a multiple of λ/2. So if L isn't a multiple, then it can't support a standing wave for that wavelength.

Wait, but the wavelength in this case is determined by the speaker's frequency. So the wavelength λ is v / f, right? So λ = v / 60 Hz.

Then, the string's length L must be equal to n*(λ/2). So substituting λ, L = n*(v/(60*2)) = n v / 120.

But if the actual length L isn't equal to any n times v/(120), then no standing wave. So the condition is that the string length isn't an integer multiple of half the wavelength (for that particular frequency).

So the correct explanation is that the string length isn't a multiple of half the wavelength. Let me check the options.

Looking at option D: "The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave." That sounds right.

Wait, what's the wavelength here? The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker. So when the speaker produces 60 Hz, the wavelength would be v/60.

So if the string's length isn't (n/2) times that wavelength, then standing waves won't form. So that's why when the speaker is at 60 Hz, if the string's length doesn't fit this condition, no standing waves.

So option D is correct.

Let me just glance at the other options to make sure none of them make sense. Option E says the wavelength equals v/60, which is correct, but that's just stating the relationship, not why standing waves don't form. So E is a fact but doesn't explain the phenomenon.

Option D is the reason. So the answer should be D.
</think>

To determine why a speaker frequency of 60 Hz does not produce standing waves in the string, we analyze the conditions required for standing waves to form. Standing waves occur when the string's length \( L \) is an integer multiple of half the wavelength \( \lambda/2 \), i.e., \( L = n\lambda/2 \), where \( n \) is an integer. The wavelength \( \lambda \) is related to the wave speed \( v \) and the frequency \( f \) by \( \lambda = v/f \). 

If the speaker's frequency is 60 Hz, the wavelength of the wave it produces is \( \lambda = v/60 \). For standing waves to form, the string's length must satisfy \( L = n(v/60)/2 = n v / 120 \). If the string's length does not match this condition for any integer \( n \), standing waves will not form.

Option D correctly identifies this reasoning: "The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave." This explanation aligns with the physics of standing waves and the specific conditions under which they occur.

Other options are either incorrect or incomplete. For example, Option E states a true relationship (\( \lambda = v/60 \)) but does not explain why standing waves fail to form. Similarly, other options do not address the critical condition of the string's length relative to the wavelength.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D**
