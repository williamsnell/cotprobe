Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence given is: "Marco moves from Italy to Spain." The options provided are labeled A through F, each with a different combination of letters. 

First, I need to understand the components involved. The problem gives me some symbols to use:

- i: Italy
- m: Marco
- s: Spain
- Mxyz: x moves to y from z

So the predicate M is a three-place predicate where the first argument is the one moving, the second is the destination, and the third is the origin. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the notation is Mxyz, which I think is read as "x moves to y from z." So the structure is M(x, y, z), meaning x moves to y from z.

Wait, no, wait. That's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The predicate is Mxyz, which is defined as "x moves to y from z." So the first argument x is the person who is moving, the second argument y is where they're moving to, and the third argument z is where they're moving from.

So the sentence is "Marco moves from Italy to Spain." Breaking that down, Marco is the subject, so he's the one moving. He's moving from Italy (so Italy is the origin, z) to Spain (Spain is the destination, y).

So in terms of the predicate, x is Marco (m), y is Spain (s), and z is Italy (i). So the predicate would be M(m, s, i), which would translate to "Marco moves to Spain from Italy," which matches the sentence.

Now looking at the options, each option is a string of letters, which I think represents the order of the arguments in the predicate. So M followed by the arguments in order x, y, z.

Wait, but the options are just letters without the M. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: Mism
B: Mssi
C: Msim
D: Mmis
E: Mmsi
F: Mims

Wait, no, looking again, the options are labeled A to F, and each option is a 4-letter string. Wait, no, actually, looking back, I think each option is a 4-letter code where the first letter is M, followed by the three arguments. So for example, option A is "Mism", which would be M followed by i, s, m.

Wait, but that might not make sense because the arguments are supposed to be m, s, i. Let me think again. Let's parse each option.

Each option is a four-character string where the first character is M, and the next three are the arguments x, y, z. So for example, option A is M followed by i, s, m. That would be M(i, s, m), meaning i (Italy) moves to s (Spain) from m (Marco), which doesn't make sense because Marco is the one moving, not Italy.

Wait, that can't be right because the subject is Marco. So I must be misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the order is x (the mover), y (destination), z (origin). So the structure is M(x, y, z). So the correct order would be M(m, s, i), which would be Marco moves to Spain from Italy.

So the correct predicate would be M(m, s, i). So looking at the options, I need to find which one has M followed by m, s, i.

But let's look at the options:

Option A: Mism → M, i, s, m → M(i, s, m)
Option B: Mssi → M, s, s, i → M(s, s, i)
Option C: Msim → M, s, i, m → M(s, i, m)
Option D: Mmis → M, m, i, s → M(m, i, s)
Option E: Mmsi → M, m, s, i → M(m, s, i)
Option F: Mims → M, i, m, s → M(i, m, s)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a table:

Option | Letters after M
A | i, s, m → M(i,s,m)
B | s, s, i → M(s,s,i)
C | s, i, m → M(s,i,m)
D | m, i, s → M(m,i,s)
E | m, s, i → M(m,s,i)
F | i, m, s → M(i,m,s)

So the correct order should be M(m, s, i), which is option E.

Wait, but let me double-check. The sentence is "Marco moves from Italy to Spain." So Marco is moving (x=m), to Spain (y=s), from Italy (z=i). So the correct predicate is M(m, s, i), which is option E: Mmsi.

So the answer should be E.

The question requires translating the sentence "Marco moves from Italy to Spain" into predicate logic using the given symbols: 

- \( i \): Italy
- \( m \): Marco
- \( s \): Spain
- \( Mxyz \): \( x \) moves to \( y \) from \( z \)

The predicate \( M \) is a three-place predicate where:
- \( x \) is the subject (the one moving),
- \( y \) is the destination,
- \( z \) is the origin.

In the sentence, Marco (\( m \)) is the subject, Spain (\( s \)) is the destination, and Italy (\( i \)) is the origin. Therefore, the correct translation is \( M(m, s, i) \), which corresponds to the option \( Mmsi \).

Option analysis:
- **A: Mism** → \( M(i, s, m) \): Incorrect, as Italy cannot move.
- **B: Mssi** → \( M(s, s, i) \): Incorrect, as Spain cannot move.
- **C: Msim** → \( M(s, i, m) \): Incorrect, as Spain cannot move.
- **D: Mmis** → \( M(m, i, s) \): Incorrect, as it suggests moving to Italy.
- **E: Mmsi** → \( M(m, s, i) \): Correct, as Marco moves to Spain from Italy.
- **F: Mims** → \( M(i, m, s) \): Incorrect, as Italy cannot move.

The correct answer is **E**.
