Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the mode or modes of a given sample. The sample provided is 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9. And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that the mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. If no number repeats, then there's no mode. But if two or more numbers tie for the most frequent, then all of them are modes, making it multimodal.

Let me list out the numbers and count their occurrences. So:

- 6 appears once.
- 7 appears twice.
- 3 appears twice.
- 8 appears once.
- 5 appears once.
- 9 appears once.

Wait, so both 3 and 7 appear twice each. The rest appear once. That means both 3 and 7 are the most frequent, each occurring twice.

So the mode here should be both 3 and 7. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: No mode
B: 6,7,8
C:7 only
D:6 and 9
E:6 and8
F:6,7,3
G:5 and9
H:3 only
I:3 and7
J:8 and9

Looking at the options, option I says 3 and 7, which matches what I found. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the numbers.

The data is: 6,7,7,3,8,5,3,9.

Counting each:

6: 1
7: 2
3: 2
8:1
5:1
9:1

Yes, so 3 and 7 each occur twice, which is more than others. So the modes are 3 and 7.

I think that's correct. So the answer is option I.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. In the sample 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9, the numbers 3 and 7 each appear twice, which is more than any other number. Therefore, the modes are 3 and 7.

The correct answer is I: 3 and 7.
