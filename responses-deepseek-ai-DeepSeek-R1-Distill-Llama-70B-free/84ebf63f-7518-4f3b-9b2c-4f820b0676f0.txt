Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the apparent Avogadro's number using some data about potassium fluoride (KF). Hmm, I remember that Avogadro's number is about the number of particles per mole, but here they're asking for the apparent value based on the given data. Let me think about the steps.

First, the problem gives me the density of KF as 2.48 g/cm³. The solid structure is a cubic array of alternating K+ and F- ions with a spacing of 2.665e-8 cm between centers. Wait, spacing between centers—I think that's the edge length of the unit cell, right? Because in a cubic unit cell, the distance between adjacent ions would correspond to the lattice parameter 'a'.

So for a cubic unit cell, the volume would be a³. But wait, the spacing is given as 2.665e-8 cm. Let me calculate the volume. Oh wait, but units are in cm, so I should convert that to meters or keep it in cm for the volume calculation.

Wait, the density is given in grams per cm³. Let me write down the steps I know for such problems:

1. Determine the unit cell type. Since it's a cubic array of alternate K+ and F- ions, I think it's a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. Wait, no, KF has a structure similar to NaCl. Oh wait, NaCl structure is FCC with each ion surrounded by the other. So each unit cell of KF would have 4 KF formula units. Because in NaCl structure, each unit cell has 4 NaCl formula units. So that's important because it tells me how many formula units per unit cell.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In an NaCl structure, each Na+ is surrounded by Cl- in an FCC arrangement. So each unit cell has 4 NaCl formula units. So same for KF. So the unit cell contains 4 KF formula units.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. Each ion is at the corners and face centers. For NaCl, each corner and face has Cl- and Na+ alternately. So each cube corner has a Cl- and each face has a Na+? Or is it the other way around? Well, regardless, the end result is that the unit cell has 4 formula units. So n, the number of formula units per unit cell, is 4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way: in FCC, each corner atom contributes 1/8 per cube, and each face contributes 1/2. So for NaCl, the structure is two interpenetrating FCC lattices. So each unit cell has 4 atoms of each type. So 4 formula units in total. So n=4.

So I have n=4.

Now, the next step is to calculate the volume of the unit cell. The edge length a is given as 2.665e-8 cm.

So volume V = a³ = (2.665e-8 cm)³.

Let me compute that. 2.665e-8 cm is 2.665 x 10^-8 cm. So cubing that gives (2.665)^3 x 10^-24 cm³.

Wait, 2.665^3 is approximately 2.665 * 2.665 = let's see, 2.665 * 2 is 5.33, 0.665*2.665 is approx 1.776. So 2.665 squared is about 7.1. Then 7.1 * 2.665 is approximately 18.9. So 18.9 x 10^-24 cm³. So V ≈ 1.89e-23 cm³ per unit cell.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 2.665^3 more accurately.

2.665 * 2.665: 2 *2=4, 2*.665=1.33, .665 *2=1.33, 0.665^2 ≈ 0.442. So adding up:

2.665 * 2.665:

Let me do it step by step:

2.665 × 2.665:

Multiply 2.665 × 2 = 5.33.

2.665 × 0.6 = 1.599.

2.665 × 0.06 = 0.1599.

2.665 × 0.005 = 0.013325.

Wait wait, maybe a better approach is to compute 2665 × 2665 and then adjust for decimals.

2665 × 2665: Let's compute 2665 squared.

2665²: Let me compute (2600 +65)^2 = 2600² + 2*2600*65 + 65².

2600² = 6,760,000.

2*2600*65 = 2*2600=5200; 5200*65: 5200*60=312,000; 5200*5=26,000. So total 312,000+26,000=338,000.

65^2=4225.

So total 6,760,000 + 338,000 = 7,098,000; +4225 →7,102,225.

So 2665²=7,102,225. So (2.665e-8 cm)^3 = (2.665)^3 x 1e-24 cm³. Wait no: (2.665e-8)^3 = (2.665)^3 * (1e-8)^3 = 18.8921 (exact?) * 1e-24 cm³.

Wait wait, 2665 is 2.665e3. So 2.665e-8 cm is 2.665e-8 cm. So when you cube it, (2.665e-8)^3 = 2.665^3 * 1e-24 cm³.

So V = a³ = approximately 1.89e-23 cm³.

Wait, earlier I thought 2.665^3 is around 18.9, so 18.9e-24 cm³ is 1.89e-23 cm³.

So unit cell volume is 1.89e-23 cm³.

Now, the mass of the unit cell can be found using the formula:

mass = density × volume.

Density is 2.48 g/cm³.

So mass = 2.48 g/cm³ × 1.89e-23 cm³.

Let me compute that: 2.48 * 1.89 is approx 4.7 (since 2.48 * 2 is 4.96, subtract 2.48*0.11=0.2728 →4.96 - 0.2728=4.6872). So mass ≈ 4.6872e-23 grams.

Wait, more accurately: 2.48 * 1.89.

Breakdown: 2 *1.89 = 3.78, 0.48 *1.89 = 0.9072. So total 3.78 + 0.9072 = 4.6872.

So 4.6872e-23 grams per unit cell.

Now, what's the molar mass of KF? K is about 39.1 g/mol, F is about 19.0 g/mol. So 39.1 +19=58.1 g/mol.

So the mass of the unit cell is 4.6872e-23 grams. The molar mass is 58.1 g/mol.

The number of moles in the unit cell is (mass) / (molar mass) → 4.6872e-23 g /58.1 g/mol = approx 8.07e-25 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately: 4.6872e-23 /58.1 → 4.6872 /58.1 is approximately 0.0807, then times 1e-23 → 8.07e-25 mol.

But wait, the number of moles is per unit cell. And each unit cell contains n=4 formula units.

So the moles per unit cell is (n × formula units) × Avogadro's number.

Wait, no. Let me think differently. The number of formula units per unit cell is 4. So the number of moles per unit cell is (number of formula units) × (1 mole / Avogadro's number).

So, moles = (4) / (N_A), where N_A is Avogadro's number.

But from the mass, we have moles = 8.07e-25 mol.

So:

4 / N_A = 8.07e-25 → N_A = 4 / (8.07e-25) → Let me compute that.

4 / 8.07e-25 = (4/8.07) × 1e25 → 0.4956 ×1e25 → approx 4.956e24.

Wait, wait, but the options are in the 10^23 range. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the steps:

1. a = 2.665e-8 cm → V = a³ = (2.665e-8)^3 cm³ = correct.

Yes, V = (2.665e-8 cm)^3 = 1.89e-23 cm³.

Density is 2.48 g/cm³, so mass = 2.48 * 1.89e-23 = 4.687e-23 g.

Molar mass KF is 58.1 g/mol.

Moles in unit cell: 4.687e-23 g /58.1 g/mol ≈ 8.07e-25 mol.

Since each unit cell has 4 formula units, moles per unit cell = 4 / N_A → 4/N_A = 8.07e-25 → N_A = 4 / (8.07e-25) → 4.956e24.

Hmm, that's 4.956e24, but the options are 1e23 scale. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit cell volume. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, a is 2.665e-8 cm. So (2.665e-8 cm)^3 = (2.665)^3 *1e-24 cm³.

Wait, 2.665^3 is 18.892 approximately. So 18.892e-24 cm³ is 1.8892e-23 cm³.

Yes, correct.

So volume is 1.8892e-23 cm³.

Density × volume: 2.48 * 1.8892e-23 = let's calculate exactly.

2.48 × 1.8892 ≈ 2.48 *1.89.

So 2 ×1.89 =3.78, 0.48 ×1.89=0.9072 → 3.78 +0.9072=4.6872.

So mass is 4.6872e-23 grams.

Molar mass KF is 58.1 g/mol.

Moles per unit cell: (4.6872e-23 g) / (58.1 g/mol) → 8.07e-25 mol.

Each unit cell has 4 formula units, so 4 formula units = 8.07e-25 mol.

So moles per formula unit: 8.07e-25 /4 = 2.0175e-25 mol per formula unit.

But wait, wait: 4 formula units correspond to 8.07e-25 mol. So each formula unit is 8.07e-25 /4 = 2.0175e-25 mol.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think in terms of Avogadro's number.

The number of formula units per mole is Avogadro's number (N_A).

So, the number of formula units in the unit cell is 4. So,

moles per unit cell = 4 / N_A.

But from the mass calculation, moles per unit cell is 8.07e-25.

So,

4 / N_A = 8.07e-25 → N_A = 4 / (8.07e-25) → 4.956e24.

But wait, that's 4.96e24, which is 4.96 x10^24, which is larger than Avogadro's number (which is ~6.022e23).

Hmm, that's impossible. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, I'm probably mixing up something. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the number of unit cells in a certain mass, then relate that to moles.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the volume.

Wait, another thought: the edge length 'a' is given as 2.665e-8 cm. But wait, wait a second: 1 cm is 1e8 angstrom, but no, that's not relevant here.

Wait, 1 cm is 1e8 angstrom? No, 1 angstrom is 1e-8 cm. Wait, 1 cm = 1e8 angstrom. So 2.665e-8 cm is 2.665 angstrom. That seems correct.

Wait, let me recheck the volume computation.

a^3 = (2.665e-8 cm)^3 = (2.665)^3 * (1e-8)^3 cm³.

(1e-8)^3 is 1e-24. So, 2.665³ is 18.89, so 18.89e-24 cm³.

So 1.889e-23 cm³. Correct.

Mass of unit cell: density × volume = 2.48 g/cm³ * 1.889e-23 cm³ = 4.687e-23 grams.

Molar mass of KF is 58.1 g/mol.

So the number of moles per unit cell is (4.687e-23 g) / (58.1 g/mol) = 8.07e-25 mol.

Each unit cell contains 4 KF formula units, so 4 formula units correspond to 8.07e-25 mol.

Thus, 1 formula unit corresponds to (8.07e-25)/4 = 2.0175e-25 mol.

So the number of formula units per mole is 1 / (2.0175e-25) → approx 4.95e24. Which is about 4.95 x 10^24, which is higher than the accepted Avogadro's number of ~6e23.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the number of formula units per unit cell. Did I get that wrong?

Wait, in the NaCl structure, each unit cell has 4 formula units. So n=4. Let me confirm that.

Yes, NaCl structure: each unit cell has 4 NaCl formula units. So KF should be the same, so n=4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the edge length given is not the unit cell edge length. Oh wait, wait. The problem says the spacing between centers is 2.665e-8 cm. So for a cubic unit cell, the edge length a is that spacing. Because in a simple cubic structure, the spacing between adjacent ions is a. But wait, in a face-centered or body-centered structure, the spacing is different.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. The given spacing is between centers of adjacent ions. So for a cubic structure, the edge length a is equal to the spacing between adjacent ions only in a simple cubic structure. But in a face-centered or body-centered structure, the spacing would be different. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, in the NaCl structure, which KF adopts, each ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge. The structure is based on a face-centered cubic lattice. So the edge length a is the distance between adjacent ions along the cube edges. So perhaps the given spacing is indeed a/2 or something else?

Wait, no. In the NaCl structure, each ion is at the face centers and edges. So the distance between K+ and F- ions along the cube edge is a/2, because each face-centered ion is a/2 away from the corner.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the NaCl structure, each ion is at a face-centered position, but the distance between adjacent ions is a/2. Because the face-centered ion is at a/2 from the corner. So if the edge length is a, then the distance between adjacent ions (like K+ and F-) along the edge is a/2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in a face-centered cubic structure, the atoms touch along the face diagonal. So the relationship between atomic radius and edge length is different. But in the NaCl structure, each ion is in contact along the edge, so the sum of their ionic radii would be a/2, because along each edge, you have a K+ and F- ion separated by a/2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think differently. The given spacing is the distance between adjacent ions, which would be the length of a unit cell edge divided by 2 in a face-centered structure. Or perhaps not.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given 'spacing' is the edge length a. So in that case, the volume is a³ as I initially calculated.

But that led to a much larger Avogadro's number than expected, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the number of formula units per unit cell.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the unit cell is simple cubic, not FCC. Then each unit cell would have 1 formula unit (if it's simple cubic with alternating ions). But that doesn't make sense because KF has a structure similar to NaCl, which is FCC-based.

Wait, but perhaps I should reevaluate n. Let me think: in a simple cubic unit cell with alternating ions, each corner would have K+ and F- alternately. But that would actually not be a stable structure. So perhaps the unit cell is actually a cube with K+ at the corners and F- at the face centers, but that would make more than one formula unit.

Alternatively, perhaps each unit cell consists of 4 KF formula units, as in the NaCl structure. So n=4.

Wait, but assuming n=4, the calculation leads to Avogadro's number being about 5e24, which is higher than the accepted value. So perhaps I messed up the calculation of the volume.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should convert the edge length from cm to meters or another unit.

Wait, the edge length is 2.665e-8 cm.
