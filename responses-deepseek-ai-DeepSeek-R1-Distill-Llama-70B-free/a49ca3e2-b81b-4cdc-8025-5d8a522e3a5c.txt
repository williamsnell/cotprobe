Alright, I've got this multiple-choice question about pre-testing a questionnaire. Hmm, what's pre-testing used for? I remember from my studies that pre-testing, or pilot testing, is a crucial step before the actual survey. Let me think through each option.

Option A: Testing the respondent's knowledge. Wait, no, pre-testing isn't about assessing what the respondents know. It's more about the questionnaire itself, not the respondents' knowledge.

Option B: Finding out important topics. I think that's more about the initial stages of research design, like when you're deciding what to include, not during pre-testing.

Option C: Assessing the cost. That doesn't make sense. Pre-testing might help estimate costs, but the main purpose is about the questionnaire's effectiveness.

Option D: Determining favorite questions. That seems unrelated. Pre-testing is about functionality, not preferences.

Option E: Testing computer and printer. Maybe in some cases, but I don't think that's the primary purpose. It's more about the questions and structure.

Option F: Deciding whom to exclude. No, that's more related to sampling methods, not pre-testing.

Option G: Determining the time to complete. Oh, right! I remember that pre-testing can help see how long it takes respondents to finish the questionnaire. That's important for planning.

Option H: Predicting final results. Probably not, since pre-testing is a small sample and not the actual data collection.

Option I: Choosing color scheme. That's about design aesthetics, maybe part of the process but not the main reason for pre-testing.

Option J: Identifying problems with wording and routing. Yes, this rings a bell. Pre-testing helps find confusing questions or issues with how the questions flow (routing). That makes sense because you want the questions to be clear and the survey to proceed smoothly without respondents getting stuck or misinterpreting.

So, looking at the options, G and J seem relevant. But the question is about the primary purpose. While G is a good point, J is more about the core issues that pre-testing aims to addressâ€”ensuring questions are clear and the survey works as intended.

Therefore, the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. Pre-testing a questionnaire is primarily used to identify any problems with the question wording and routing. This ensures the survey is clear, functions smoothly, and collects accurate data.

Answer: J
