Okay, so I have this question about the Federal Reserve System and the three major controls they use to manage money. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that the Fed, as it's called, has tools to influence the economy. Let me try to recall what those tools are.

I think one of the main tools is setting interest rates. Oh wait, specifically, I remember something about the discount rate. That's the rate at which banks borrow money from the Fed. So if the Fed lowers the discount rate, it's cheaper for banks to borrow, which might encourage them to lend more, increasing the money supply.

Another tool I think they use is buying or selling government bonds on the open market. Oh right, that's called open market operations. When the Fed buys bonds, they're injecting money into the economy because they're paying for them, which increases the money supply. Conversely, selling bonds would take money out of circulation, reducing the supply.

The third tool, if I'm not mistaken, has to do with reserve requirements. Banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves, and they can't lend that out. So if the Fed raises the required reserve ratio, banks have less money to lend, which reduces the money supply. Lowering it frees up more money for lending, increasing the supply.

Let me look at the options now. Option G says: raise or lower the required reserve ratio, buy or sell bonds in the open market, raise or lower the discount rate. That matches exactly what I was thinking. So the three tools are the reserve ratio, open market operations, and the discount rate.

I should double-check the other options to make sure. Option A talks about the prime rate, but I think the Fed influences the prime rate indirectly, not directly. They set the federal funds rate, which affects the prime. Option B includes savings account rates and gold prices, which don't seem right. Option C is about fiscal policy, which is more the government's jobâ€”taxes and spending, not the Fed's. Option D is about economic growth and foreign aid, which isn't the Fed's role. Option E includes social security and tariffs, which again are fiscal, not monetary. Option F is about GDP and unemployment, which are outcomes, not tools. Option H mentions stocks and inflation rates, but the Fed doesn't control inflation directly; it's a target. Option I talks about currency supply and stock market, but I think the Fed's tools are more specific. Option J is about debt ceiling and taxes, which are legislative.

So yeah, option G is the correct one.

The Federal Reserve System uses three major tools to manage the money supply and influence the economy. These are:

1. **Required Reserve Ratio**: The Fed can adjust the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserve, thereby affecting the amount of money banks can lend and the overall money supply.

2. **Open Market Operations**: By buying or selling government bonds on the open market, the Fed can increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation.

3. **Discount Rate**: The Fed sets the interest rate at which banks borrow money from it, influencing the cost of borrowing for banks and subsequently affecting lending and the money supply.

Option G correctly identifies these three tools.
