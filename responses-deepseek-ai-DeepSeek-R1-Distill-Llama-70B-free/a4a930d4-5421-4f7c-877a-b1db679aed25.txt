Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that when the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), the result is 33. One of the integers is 45, and I need to find the smallest possible value of the other integer.

Hmm, I remember that there's a relationship between LCM and GCD of two numbers. Oh right, the product of the LCM and GCD of two numbers equals the product of the numbers themselves. So, LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b. That might be useful here.

Let me denote the two numbers as a and b, where a is 45, and b is the unknown. So according to the problem, LCM(45, b) divided by GCD(45, b) equals 33. So mathematically, that's (LCM(45, b) / GCD(45, b)) = 33.

From the relationship I just remembered, LCM(a, b) = (a*b)/GCD(a, b). So substituting that into the equation, I get:

[(45 * b) / GCD(45, b)] / GCD(45, b) = 33.

Simplifying that, it's (45 * b) / (GCD(45, b))^2 = 33.

Let me write that equation down:

(45b) / (d^2) = 33, where d is the GCD of 45 and b.

Wait, because the GCD of 45 and b is d, so d must be a divisor of 45. Let me list the divisors of 45. The positive divisors are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.

So possible values for d are these. Now, since d is the GCD of 45 and b, b must be a multiple of d. Let me express b as d times some integer k, where k is an integer such that GCD(k, 45/d) is 1. Because if d is the GCD, then when you factor d out from both 45 and b, the remaining parts (45/d and k) must be coprime.

So substituting b = d * k into the equation:

45 * (d * k) / d^2 = 33.

Simplify numerator: 45 d k / d^2 = (45 k)/d.

So (45k)/d = 33.

Let me rearrange this equation: 45k = 33d.

Divide both sides by 3: 15k = 11d.

So 15k = 11d. Hmm, since 15 and 11 are coprime (they have no common factors besides 1), this implies that d must be a multiple of 15, and k must be a multiple of 11.

Wait, wait, because 15k = 11d, so let's think in terms of divisibility. 11 is a prime number. So for the equation to hold, 11 must divide the left side, which is 15k. Since 11 is prime and doesn't divide 15, it must divide k. So k must be 11 times some integer m, where m is a positive integer.

Similarly, 15k = 11d implies that d must be a multiple of 15, because 15k is 15*(11m) = 165m. So 11d = 165m → d = (165m)/11 = 15m.

So d = 15m. But earlier, I established that d must be a divisor of 45. So let's see what possible values m can take such that d=15m divides 45.

The divisors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.

So d must be one of these, and d =15m. Let's see the possible m:

If m=1, d=15, which is a divisor of 45. If m=2, d=30, which isn't a divisor of 45. Similarly, m=3 would give d=45, which is a divisor. So possible m values are 1 and 3.

Wait, m=3 → d=45. Let's check.

So for m=1:

d=15*1=15. Then k=11m=11*1=11.

So b = d * k =15 *11= 165.

For m=3:

d=15*3=45. Then k=11*3=33.

So b =45 *33=1485.

Wait, but the question asks for the smallest possible value of the other integer, so 165 is smaller than 1485.

But wait, are there other possible m values? Let me check.

Wait, when m=0, d=0, which isn't a positive integer, so it's invalid. So only m=1 and m=3 are possible because higher m would make d larger than 45, which isn't a divisor.

So the possible b values are 165 and 1485. Since the question asks for the smallest possible, 165 is the answer. Let me see the options: option D is 165. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't miss any possible d values.

Wait, what if m=0? No, that's invalid because d has to be a positive integer. So possible m=1 gives d=15, which is a divisor, and m=3 gives d=45, which is also a divisor.

Wait, but what about m=2? Then d=30, which isn't a divisor of 45, so that's not allowed. So yes, only m=1 and m=3, leading to b=165 and 1485.

So the smallest is 165, which is option D.

But wait, let me think again. Is there any other d that I might have missed? Let me see.

Alternative approach: Let me express the equation again. We have (45b)/(d^2) =33, so 45b=33 d^2.

Simplify 45 and 33: both are divisible by 3. 45/3=15, 33/3=11. So 15b = 11 d^2.

So 15b =11 d² → 15 divides 11 d². Since 15 and 11 are coprime, 15 must divide d². So the prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5. So d must be a multiple of both 3 and 5, so d must be a multiple of 15.

But d is a divisor of 45, so possible d's are 15 and 45.

So for d=15: 15b=11*(15)^2 → 15b=11*225 → 15b=2475 → b=2475/15=165.

For d=45: 15b=11*(45)^2 → 15b=11*2025=22275 → b=22275/15=1485.

So yes, same result, the smallest is 165, option D.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The key equation is:

\[
\frac{\text{LCM}(a, b)}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} = 33
\]

Given \( a = 45 \), we denote \( b \) as the unknown integer and \( d = \text{GCD}(45, b) \). Using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(a, b) \cdot \text{GCD}(a, b) = a \cdot b \), we can rewrite the given equation as:

\[
\frac{\text{LCM}(45, b)}{\text{GCD}(45, b)} = \frac{\frac{45 \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(45, b)}}{\text{GCD}(45, b)} = \frac{45 \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(45, b)^2} = 33
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{45b}{d^2} = 33
\]

Rearranging, we get:

\[
45b = 33d^2
\]

Dividing through by 3:

\[
15b = 11d^2
\]

This implies that \( d^2 \) must be a multiple of 15. Since \( d \) is the GCD of 45 and \( b \), \( d \) must be a divisor of 45. The divisors of 45 are \( 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45 \). For \( d^2 \) to be a multiple of 15, \( d \) must include the prime factors of 15, which are 3 and 5. Thus, \( d \) can only be 15 or 45.

1. **Case 1: \( d = 15 \)**  
   Substituting \( d = 15 \) into \( 15b = 11d^2 \):  
   \[
   15b = 11 \cdot 15^2 = 11 \cdot 225 = 2475
   \]  
   Solving for \( b \):  
   \[
   b = \frac{2475}{15} = 165
   \]

2. **Case 2: \( d = 45 \)**  
   Substituting \( d = 45 \) into \( 15b = 11d^2 \):  
   \[
   15b = 11 \cdot 45^2 = 11 \cdot 2025 = 22275
   \]  
   Solving for \( b \):  
   \[
   b = \frac{22275}{15} = 1485
   \]

The smallest possible value of \( b \) is 165. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 165**
