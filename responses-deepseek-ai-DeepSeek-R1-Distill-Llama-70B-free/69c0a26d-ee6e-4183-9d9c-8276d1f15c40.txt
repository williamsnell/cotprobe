Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about a one-dimensional collision where two particles stick together afterwards. I need to find the fraction of the initial kinetic energy that's lost. Hmm, I remember that when particles stick together, it's called a perfectly inelastic collision. Right.

So the setup is: a particle of mass 2m is moving and collides with another particle of mass m that's at rest. After the collision, they stick together and move with some velocity. I need to calculate the kinetic energy before and after the collision to find out how much is lost.

Wait, the initial kinetic energy is only from the moving particle, right? Because the other one is at rest. So the initial KE is (1/2) * (2m) * v_initial². Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial velocity of the 2m particle is given, but in the problem statement, I don't see the actual velocity. Oh, maybe that doesn't matter because we can express everything in terms of the initial velocity.

Wait, but actually, let me think again. Since the problem is about the fraction, the actual velocity might cancel out. Let's see.

First, let's denote:

- Mass of first particle, m1 = 2m.
- Mass of second particle, m2 = m.
- Initial velocity of m1 = let's say u (since it's moving).
- Initial velocity of m2 = 0, because it's at rest.

After the collision, the combined mass is (2m + m) = 3m. Let's call their common velocity v'.

So, applying conservation of momentum. Momentum before collision equals momentum after.

Momentum before = m1 * u + m2 * 0 = 2m * u.
Momentum after = (3m) * v'.

So, 2m u = 3m v' → v' = (2m u)/(3m) ) → v' = (2u)/3.

Okay, that's the velocity after collision.

Now, the initial kinetic energy (KE_initial) is (1/2) m1 u² = 0.5 * 2m * u² → KE_initial = m u².

The kinetic energy after collision (KE_final) is (1/2) (3m) (v')². Let's plug in v' = (2u/3).

So, KE_final = 0.5 * 3m * (4u²/9) ) → Let's compute that: 0.5 * 3m * (4u²/9) = (3m * 4u²) / (2 * 9)

Simplify numerator and denominator: 12 m u² / 18 → 2 m u² / 3.

Wait, so KE_final = (2/3) m u².

Wait, but the initial KE was m u². So the final KE is (2/3) of that. So the KE lost is initial KE minus final KE.

So KE_lost = m u² - (2/3 m u²) ) = (1/3) m u².

Wait no, wait. Let me double-check. Initial KE is m u², final is (2/3) m u². So the difference is m u² - 2/3 m u² = 1/3 m u². So yes, the lost KE is 1/3 of the initial.

Wait, but wait, the question asks what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost. So the fraction is (KE_lost) / (KE_initial) = (1/3 m u²) / (m u²) ) → 1/3.

Looking back at the options, option G is 1/3. So the answer should be G.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculation.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the KE before and after.

KE_initial = (1/2)(2m) u² = m u².

KE_final = (1/2)(3m) v'^2.

v' = (2u/3).

v' squared is 4u²/9.

So KE_final = (1/2)(3m)(4u²/9) → (3m *4u²)/(2*9) → (12 m u²)/(18) → (2 m u²)/3. Which is 2/3 m u².

So KE lost is m u² - (2/3 m u²) = (1/3 m u²). So yes, fraction is 1/3, option G.

In a one-dimensional, perfectly inelastic collision where a particle of mass \( 2m \) collides with a particle of mass \( m \) at rest, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost can be determined as follows:

1. **Initial Kinetic Energy**:  
   The initial kinetic energy is entirely due to the moving particle of mass \( 2m \):  
   \[
   KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} (2m) u^2 = m u^2
   \]

2. **Final Velocity**:  
   After the collision, the two particles stick together, forming a combined mass of \( 3m \). Using conservation of momentum:  
   \[
   (2m) u + (m)(0) = (3m) v'
   \]
   Solving for \( v' \):  
   \[
   v' = \frac{2u}{3}
   \]

3. **Final Kinetic Energy**:  
   The kinetic energy after the collision is:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} (3m) v'^2 = \frac{1}{2} (3m) \left(\frac{2u}{3}\right)^2
   \]
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} (3m) \cdot \frac{4u^2}{9} = \frac{2m u^2}{3}
   \]

4. **Energy Lost**:  
   The energy lost is the difference between the initial and final kinetic energies:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{lost}} = KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}} = m u^2 - \frac{2m u^2}{3} = \frac{m u^2}{3}
   \]

5. **Fraction of Energy Lost**:  
   The fraction of the initial kinetic energy that is lost is:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction Lost} = \frac{KE_{\text{lost}}}{KE_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\frac{m u^2}{3}}{m u^2} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is \( \frac{1}{3} \), corresponding to option **G**.
