Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the heat required to warm up water. Hmm, let's see. I remember from school that when you're heating water, the formula involves the mass, the specific heat capacity, and the change in temperature. Right, the formula is Q = mcΔT. Oh wait, but wait—what are the units here?

The question says one gallon of water, which is 3.78 liters. I think the density of water is about 1 gram per milliliter, so a liter is 1000 grams. So 3.78 liters would be 3780 grams, which is 3.78 kg. Wait, wait, no, grams and kilograms—3780 grams is 3.78 kg? No, wait, 1 kg is 1000 g, so 3780 grams is 3.78 kg. Oh wait, no, 3780 g is 3.78 kg? Wait, 1000 grams is 1 kg, so 3780 grams is 3.78 kg. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the specific heat capacity of water. I remember it's 4.186 joules per gram per degree Celsius. Or wait, sometimes it's given as 4186 J/kg°C because 4.186 J/g°C multiplied by 1000 g/kg is 4186 J/kg°C. So maybe using that would be easier since our mass is in kg.

The change in temperature is from 10°C to 80°C, so that's a change of 70 degrees. So ΔT is 70°C.

So plugging into the formula: Q = m * c * ΔT.

So m is 3.78 kg, c is 4186 J/(kg·°C), and ΔT is 70°C.

Calculating that: 3.78 * 4186 * 70.

Let me compute that. First, multiply 3.78 and 4186. Let's see, 3 times 4186 is 12,558. 0.78 times 4186 is... Let me compute 0.7 * 4186 is 2930.2, and 0.08 *4186 is about 335. So adding those gives 2930.2 + 335 = 3265.2. So total 3.78 *4186 is 12,558 + 3265.2 = 15,823.2.

Now multiply that by 70: 15,823.2 *70. Hmm, 15,823 *70 is 1,107,620. And 0.2*70 is 14, so total is 1,107,634 J.

Wait, but the options are in Kcal. Oh right, kilocalories. I remember that 1 Kcal is 4184 J, approximately. So to convert Joules to Kcal, I divide by 4184.

So 1,107,634 J divided by 4184 J/Kcal. Let me do the division. Let's approximate 1,107,634 ÷ 4184.

Well, 4184 * 264 = let's see, 4184 * 200 is 836,800. 4184 *60 is 251,040. 4184*4 is 16,736. So 200+60+4=264. 836800 +251040=1,087,840 +16,736=1,104,576. So 264 Kcal would give 1,104,576 J. But our Q is 1,107,634 J, which is a bit more than that.

The difference is 1,107,634 - 1,104,576 = 3,058 J. Now, 3,058 divided by 4184 is about 0.73 Kcal. So total is approximately 264.73 Kcal. Looking at the options, the closest is option G:265 Kcal. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake. Let me recalculate. The mass is 3.78 kg, correct. Specific heat is 4186 J/kg°C, correct. ΔT is 70°C. So 3.78 *4186 = let me compute that again.

3 *4186 = 12558, 0.78 *4186: 0.7*4186=2930.2, 0.08*4186=335. So 2930.2+335=3265.2. So total is 12558 + 3265.2=15823.2 J/°C. Multiply by 70 gives 15823.2 *70 = 1,107,624 J. Oh wait, earlier I had 1,107,634, but now it's 1,107,624—probably a minor miscalculation, but same ballpark.

Now, converting 1,107,624 J to Kcal. Since 1 Kcal ≈ 4184 J, so 1,107,624 /4184. Let me see, 4184 * 265 = 4184*(200+60+5) = 836,800 + 251,040 +20,920. 836800+251040=1,087,840 +20,920=1,108,760. Oh wait, but our Q is 1,107,624, which is less than 1,108,760. So 265 Kcal is 1,108,760 J, which is a bit higher than our Q. So 265 Kcal is about 1,108,760 J. Our Q is 1,107,624, which is about 265 minus (1,108,760 -1,107,624)/4184 per Kcal.

The difference is 1,108,760 -1,107,624 = 1,136 J. So 1,136 J is how much less than 265 Kcal. So 1,136 /4184 ≈ 0.271 Kcal. So 265 - 0.271 is approximately 264.73 Kcal. So about 264.73 Kcal.

Looking back at the options, option G is 265 Kcal. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but I also remember that sometimes in such problems, the specific heat is taken as 4.184 or sometimes approximated as 4.18 or 4.2. Let me see if that changes things. If I use 4.2 instead of 4.186.

So m=3.78 kg, c=4200 J/kg°C (approximate), ΔT=70.

So Q=3.78 *4200 *70. Let's compute that.

3.78 *4200 = let's see, 3 *4200=12,600, 0.78*4200=3,276. So total is 12,600 +3,276=15,876 J/°C.

Multiply by 70: 15,876 *70 = 1,111,320 J.

Convert to Kcal: 1,111,320 /4184 ≈ ?

Calculating 4184 *265 is 1,108,760 as before. 1,111,320 -1,108,760 = 2,560 J.

So 2,560 /4184 ≈ 0.612 Kcal. So total is 265.612 Kcal. Approximately 265.61, which is close to 266 Kcal. But the option is 265, so G. So still, even with rounding the specific heat, G is the closest.

Alternatively, sometimes the specific heat is taken as exactly 4.184, which is the exact figure I used earlier. So regardless, the answer seems to be G:265 Kcal.

To calculate the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one gallon of water (3.78 liters) from 10°C to 80°C, we use the formula:

\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]

### Step 1: Determine the mass of water
The density of water is approximately \(1 \, \text{g/mL}\), so for \(3.78 \, \text{liters}\) (or \(3780 \, \text{mL}\)):

\[
m = 3780 \, \text{g} = 3.78 \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Step 2: Specific heat capacity of water
The specific heat capacity of water is approximately:

\[
c = 4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)}.
\]

### Step 3: Temperature change
The temperature change is:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial}} = 80°C - 10°C = 70°C.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \(Q\)
Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
Q = 3.78 \cdot 4186 \cdot 70.
\]

First, calculate \(3.78 \cdot 4186\):

\[
3.78 \cdot 4186 = 15,823.2 \, \text{J/°C}.
\]

Now multiply by \(70\):

\[
Q = 15,823.2 \cdot 70 = 1,107,624 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 5: Convert joules to kilocalories
Since \(1 \, \text{Kcal} = 4184 \, \text{J}\), divide \(Q\) by \(4184\):

\[
Q = \frac{1,107,624}{4184} \approx 264.73 \, \text{Kcal}.
\]

### Step 6: Match the closest option
The closest option to \(264.73 \, \text{Kcal}\) is:

**G: 265 Kcal.**

Thus, the answer is:

**G**
