Okay, so I've got this question about converting parts per million (ppm) to milligram percent. Hmm, I remember that ppm and mg% are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conversion. Let me think this through.

The question says the maximum safe concentration of fluoride ion in drinking water is 2.0 ppm. I need to express this as milligram percent. Wait, what's the difference between ppm and mg% again?

From what I recall, ppm stands for parts per million. It's a ratio of the mass of the solute to the mass of the solution. So 1 ppm is 1 milligram of solute per kilogram of solution. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 ppm is 1 milligram per liter of solution because 1 liter of water has a mass of approximately 1 kilogram. So 1 ppm equals 1 mg/L, which is the same as 1 mg per 1000 grams of solution.

Now, milligram percent (mg%) is another way of expressing concentration. I think mg% is defined as the number of milligrams of solute per 100 grams of solution. Wait, that's different from ppm. Because in ppm, it's per million, which is per 1,000,000 grams. Wait no, wait: no, wait, 1 ppm is 1 part in a million parts. So if you have 1 ppm, that's 1 mg per kg (since 1 kg is 1000 g, and 1 mg is 0.001 g). Wait, no, wait: 1 ppm is 1 mg per liter, because 1 liter is approximately 1000 grams (since 1 kg = 1000 g). So 1 ppm = 1 mg/L = 1 mg per 1000 grams. So that's 0.001 mg per 100 grams. Because 1000 grams is 10 times 100 grams, so 1 mg divided by 10 gives 0.1 mg per 100 grams. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, wait a minute. Let me get this straight. 1 ppm is 1 mg per kg of solution. Because ppm is parts per million by mass. So if the solution is 1 kg, then 1 ppm is 1 mg. But 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 1 ppm is 1 mg per 1000 grams. So mg% is mg per 100 grams. So to get mg%, I need to find how many mg are in 100 grams of solution.

So let's say I have 1000 grams (1 kg) of solution. At 1 ppm, that's 1 mg of solute. So per 100 grams, that's 1/10th of 1 kg, which is 100 grams. So 1 mg per 1000 grams is 0.1 mg per 100 grams. So 1 ppm is 0.1 mg%, right? Because mg% is mg per 100 grams.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. If I have a solution that's 1 ppm, that's 1 mg in 1000 grams of solution. So in 100 grams, which is one-tenth of that, it would be 0.1 mg. So the concentration in mg% would be 0.1 mg%. So 1 ppm equals 0.1 mg%.

So if the ppm is 2.0, then in mg% it's 2.0 * 0.1, which is 0.2 mg%. Wait, but let me check that again. Because 1 ppm is 1 mg per kg (1000 g), so per 100 g, it's 1 mg / 10 = 0.1 mg. So 1 ppm = 0.1 mg%. So 2 ppm would be 0.2 mg%.

Looking at the options, I see option F is 0.20 mg%, which would be 0.2. So that would match. Alternatively, if I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait another thought: mg% is (mg of solute / 100 g of solution) Ã— 100%, but wait no, mg% is defined as mg per 100 mL or per 100 g? Wait, no, I think mg% is milligrams per 100 grams of solution. So for mg%, it's mg per 100g. So 1 ppm is 1 mg per 1000g, which is 0.001 mg per 100g, no, wait:

Wait, 1 mg per 1000g is 0.001 mg per 100g. Because 1000g is 10 times 100g. So 1mg per 1000g is 0.1 mg per 100g. Because 1 divided by 10 is 0.1. So yes, 1 ppm equals 0.1 mg%.

Wait, but let me compute it step by step. 2 ppm is 2 mg per 1000 grams. So in 100 grams, that would be 2 mg / 10 = 0.2 mg. So the mg% is 0.2 mg%. So the answer would be 0.20 mg%, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is written as .20 mg%, which is 0.20, same as 0.2. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes different sources might define ppm differently. But I think in this case, the standard is that 1 ppm = 1 mg/L = 1 mg/kg (since 1 liter of water is about 1 kg).

Alternatively, another approach: mg% is mg per 100g, so 2 ppm is 2 mg per 1,000,000 mg? Wait, no, wait ppm is parts per million by mass. So 2 ppm is 2 mg per 1,000,000 mg? No, because ppm is by mass. Wait, 1 ppm is 1 gram per million grams. So 2 ppm is 2 grams per million grams, which is 2 mg per 1000 grams (since 1 gram is 1000 mg). So 2 mg per 1000 grams is the same as 0.2 mg per 100 grams. So that's 0.2 mg%, which is option F.

To convert the fluoride ion concentration from parts per million (ppm) to milligram percent (mg%), it is important to understand the relationship between these units. 

1 ppm is defined as 1 milligram of solute per kilogram (1000 grams) of solution. Since mg% is defined as milligrams of solute per 100 grams of solution, the conversion can be calculated as follows:

\[
1 \, \text{ppm} = \frac{1 \, \text{mg}}{1000 \, \text{g}} = 0.1 \, \text{mg\%}.
\]

Thus, for a concentration of 2.0 ppm:

\[
2.0 \, \text{ppm} = 2.0 \times 0.1 \, \text{mg\%} = 0.2 \, \text{mg\%}.
\]

This matches option F, which is 0.20 mg%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F**
