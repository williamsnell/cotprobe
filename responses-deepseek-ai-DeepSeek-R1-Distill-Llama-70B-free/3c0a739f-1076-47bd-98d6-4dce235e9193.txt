Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about personnel selection methods and their predictive validity. Hmm, I remember that predictive validity has to do with how well a selection method predicts future job performance. The question is asking which method has the highest validity.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A is a projective technique. I think projective tests are like those where you interpret ambiguous stimuli, such as inkblot tests. They're often used in psychology to assess personality but I'm not sure how reliable they are for job predictions. Probably not the highest validity here.

Option B is a skills test. Skills tests assess specific abilities relevant to the job. For example, if the job requires typing, a typing test would be a skills test. These seem pretty directly related to job performance, so they might have high validity.

Option C is a reference check. References are when previous employers vouch for the candidate. I've heard that reference checks aren't the most reliable because they can be biased or not very informative. So maybe not the highest.

Option D is a job sample test. Job samples are when candidates perform tasks that are similar to the actual job. Like, if you're hiring a writer, you might ask them to write a sample. This seems very relevant because it directly tests the ability to do the job. I remember reading that job samples have high validity because they mimic real work situations.

Option E is an objective personality inventory. These are tests that measure personality traits, like the Big Five. They can predict some aspects of behavior, but I think their predictive validity isn't as high as more direct methods like skills or job samples. It might depend on the job, but overall, maybe not the top.

Option F is a self-assessment survey. This is where the candidate rates their own skills and abilities. I think self-assessments can be unreliable because people might exaggerate their abilities or not be accurate. So validity might be lower here.

Option G is a group interview. Group interviews involve assessing candidates in a group setting, maybe through discussions or activities. They can show teamwork and communication skills, but I'm not sure how high their predictive validity is compared to more individual assessments. Maybe lower than job samples or skills tests.

Option H is a biographical inventory. These are like detailed questionnaires about a person's background and experiences. I think they can predict job performance, especially for certain traits, but maybe not as directly as a job sample test.

Option I is an interview by the personnel manager. Interviews are common, but their validity can vary. Unstructured interviews might have lower validity because they're subjective, but structured interviews can be better. However, compared to job samples or skills tests, I think interviews generally have moderate validity.

So, putting it all together, job sample tests (D) and skills tests (B) seem to have high validity. I'm trying to remember which one is higher. I think job sample tests might have an edge because they directly reflect the job's actual tasks. Skills tests are also very relevant, but maybe job samples are even better predictors because they're more comprehensive and mimic real job conditions. 

Wait, another thought: I remember that job samples often have higher predictive validity because they are direct measures of job-related behavior. Skills tests are specific, but maybe the job sample includes a variety of tasks that better capture the overall job requirements. So D might be the answer.

The question asks which personnel selection method has the highest predictive validity. Predictive validity refers to how well a method forecasts future job performance. 

- **Option A (Projective technique):** These assess personality through ambiguous stimuli but are not highly reliable for job prediction.
- **Option B (Skills test):** Directly measures job-specific abilities, such as typing or programming, making them highly relevant.
- **Option C (Reference check):** Relies on previous employers' opinions, which can be biased or uninformative, limiting validity.
- **Option D (Job sample test):** Involves tasks mirroring actual job duties, providing a direct assessment of job-related abilities and often considered highly valid.
- **Option E (Objective personality inventory):** Measures traits like the Big Five but has lower validity compared to direct job assessments.
- **Option F (Self-assessment survey):** Candidates rate themselves, which can be unreliable due to exaggeration or inaccuracy.
- **Option G (Group interview):** Assesses teamwork and communication but may not predict individual job performance as accurately.
- **Option H (Biographical inventory):** Examines background and experiences but is less direct than job samples.
- **Option I (Interview by personnel manager):** Validity varies; structured interviews are better but generally less valid than job samples.

Between **B (Skills test)** and **D (Job sample test)**, job sample tests often have higher predictive validity because they directly reflect real job conditions and tasks, making them a better predictor of performance.

Answer: D
