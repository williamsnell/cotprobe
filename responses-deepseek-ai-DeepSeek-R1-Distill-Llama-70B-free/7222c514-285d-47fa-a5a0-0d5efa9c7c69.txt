Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a KOH solution. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that KOH is a strong base, which means it should dissociate completely in water. Right, so in solution, KOH will break down into K+ and OH- ions.

The concentration given is 0.001 M. Since KOH is a strong electrolyte, the concentration of OH- ions should also be 0.001 M. Oh wait, because each KOH unit releases one OH- ion. So [OH-] = 0.001 M.

Now, pH is related to the concentration of H+ ions, but since this is a base, I think I need to find the pOH first. Oh right, pOH is the negative log of the OH- concentration. So pOH = -log(0.001). Let me calculate that. Log of 0.001 is -3 because 10^-3 is 0.001. So pOH would be 3.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because pOH is -log[OH-]. So if [OH-] is 0.001, then log(0.001) is -3. So negative of that is 3. So pOH is 3.

Now, pH and pOH are related by pH + pOH = 14, right? Because Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So if pOH is 3, then pH would be 14 - 3 = 11. So the pH should be 11.

Looking at the options, option H is 11. So the answer should be H.

Wait, wait another thing. Let me double-check. Strong base, so yes, [OH-] is 0.001 M. pOH is 3, pH is 11. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer is H.

The problem involves determining the pH of a 0.001 M aqueous solution of the strong base KOH. Since KOH is a strong electrolyte, it dissociates completely in water, producing [OH⁻] = 0.001 M. The pOH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.001) = 3
\]

Using the relationship between pH and pOH:

\[
\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14 \implies \text{pH} = 14 - 3 = 11
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is 11. Among the given options, the correct answer is **H**.
