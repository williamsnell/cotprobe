Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. The question is asking which power was granted to the states under the Articles but not under the Constitution. Hmm, I remember that the Articles of Confederation were the first form of government for the United States, and they were later replaced by the Constitution because they had a lot of weaknesses.

So the options are A through I. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: Enforcing national laws. I think under the Articles, the federal government didn't have much power. The states were more in control. So maybe the states had the power to enforce their own laws, but I'm not sure if that's what this option is referring to. The Constitution gave more power to the federal government, including enforcement, so maybe the Articles didn't grant this to the states in a way the Constitution does.

Option B: Authorizing constitutional amendments. I'm not too sure about this. The Articles required unanimous consent for amendments, which was hard. The Constitution has its own amendment process, which involves Congress and the states, so maybe the states had some role, but I don't think this is the right answer.

Option C: Establishing foreign diplomatic relations. Oh wait, I think the Articles didn't allow the federal government to handle foreign relations effectively. Each state might have had their own dealings, but I'm not certain. The Constitution gives the federal government the power to make treaties and handle foreign affairs, so maybe under the Articles, the states had more of this power.

Option D: Coining money. I remember that under the Articles, states could coin their own money, which led to economic chaos because each state had different currency. The Constitution took that power away and gave it to the federal government, so the states couldn't do that anymore. That might be the correct answer.

Option E: Having power to declare war. The Articles gave states some power over militias, but I think the federal government under the Articles could declare war with state consent. The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, so I'm not sure if states had that power before. Maybe this is a possibility.

Option F: Appealing to the president to adjudicate disputes. The Articles didn't have a president, so this doesn't make sense. The Constitution sets up the judicial system with the Supreme Court and the president as part of the federal government, so states couldn't appeal to a president under the Articles.

Option G: Regulating interstate commerce. Oh yeah, the Articles didn't give the federal government the power to regulate commerce between states, leading to trade issues. Under the Constitution, the Commerce Clause allows the federal government to regulate interstate commerce. So the states had this power under the Articles but not under the Constitution. That might be the right answer.

Option H: The power to tax citizens directly. The Articles allowed states to tax, but the federal government couldn't tax directly. The Constitution gives the federal government the power to tax, but states still have that power too. So maybe this isn't the correct answer because both systems allowed states to tax.

Option I: Having representation in Congress. Both the Articles and the Constitution have representation in Congress, but the structure changed. So this isn't the answer because it's not something the Articles granted that the Constitution didn't.

Wait, so looking back. The question is about what power the Articles granted to states that the Constitution didn't. So under the Articles, states could coin money, which the Constitution prohibits. Also, under the Articles, states regulated interstate commerce, which the Constitution took away.

So options D and G are possibilities. The question is which one is correct.

I think the Articles of Confederation allowed states to regulate commerce among themselves, but the Constitution took that power. So G could be the answer. But wait, the Articles didn't explicitly grant that power; they just didn't have a federal regulation, so states had it by default. The Constitution then gave it to the federal government.

Alternatively, coining money: the Articles allowed states to do that, but the Constitution says only the federal government can coin money. So D is also a possible answer.

Wait, when the Constitution was ratified, the federal government took over the power to coin money. So under the Articles, states could do it, but under the Constitution, they couldn't. So D is a correct answer.

But option G, regulating interstate commerce, was something the Articles didn't handle, so states had the power, but the Constitution gave it to the federal government. So G is also a correct answer.

Wait, the question is what power was granted by the Articles but not by the Constitution. So if the Articles allowed states to do something, and the Constitution took that away, then the answer would be that something.

So which option fits that?

Option G: Regulating interstate commerce. The Articles didn't have a federal power over it, so states could regulate it. The Constitution took that power, so states couldn't anymore.

Option D: Coining money. Under the Articles, states could coin money. Constitution prohibits states from coining their own money, so that's a power lost.

So both D and G are possibilities. But the question is about what was granted by the Articles but not the Constitution.

Wait, the question is phrased as "granted to the states by the Articles". So if the Articles allowed the states to do these things, but the Constitution took those powers, then both D and G are correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D or G. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The Articles of Confederation had the following features: each state retained sovereignty, powers not delegated to the federal government remained with the states. So the Articles didn't give the federal government the power to regulate commerce, so the states had it. The Constitution gives the federal government that power.

Similarly, the Articles allowed states to coin money, but the Constitution gives the federal government exclusive power over currency.

So both D and G could be correct, but let me check the options given.

The options are:

A: Enforcing national laws – No, the Articles didn't enforce, the Constitution gives that to the feds.

B: Authorizing amendments – Not sure, but the process was different.

C: Foreign relations – The Articles didn't handle that well, states might have, but the Constitution gives it to the feds.

D: Coining money – Yes, states could under the Articles, not under the Constitution.

E: Declare war – The Articles required states to contribute troops, but declaration was federal, maybe. Not sure.

F: Appeal to president – No, Articles had no president.

G: Regulate interstate commerce – States did under Articles, Constitution took that.

H: Tax directly – States could under both systems.

I: Representation – Both had it.

So the question is, which of these options is correct.

The question is looking for a power that the Articles granted to the states that the Constitution didn't. So the options are D and G.

Wait, in the Constitution, the federal government has the power to regulate interstate commerce, so the states cannot. Under the Articles, the states could.

Similarly, the Constitution forbids states from coining money, so under the Articles, they could.

So both D and G are correct, but the options are given as A to I, each as single options.

Wait, the original question is about what power was granted to the states by the Articles but not by the Constitution. So which of the options is something the Articles allowed the states to do, but the Constitution prohibits the states from doing.

Looking back, the Articles didn't give the federal government the power to regulate commerce, so the states had it. The Constitution gives the federal government that power, so the states don't anymore. So option G is correct.

Similarly, the Articles allowed states to coin money, which the Constitution forbids. So option D is correct.

So both D and G are possible, but the answer options only have one correct answer. So perhaps only one of them is correct as per the options given.

Wait, the question says "the power" granted to the states, so it's singular. So perhaps only one option is correct.

I think the correct answer is D: Coining money. Because the Articles allowed states to coin their own money, leading to different currencies, which the Constitution prohibited. So the states lost that power under the Constitution.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that the Commerce Clause in the Constitution took the power of regulating interstate commerce from the states. So option G is also correct.

Hmm. Wait, what does the question say? It says, what power was granted to the states by the Articles but not by the Constitution. So the Articles allowed the states to have that power, but under the Constitution, the states don't have it anymore.

So D and G both fit that description. So how do I choose between them?

Looking at the answer options, perhaps the correct answer is D: Coining money. Because the Constitution explicitly gives the federal government the power to coin money, so states can't. Under the Articles, states could.

And for G, the Commerce Clause allows the federal government to regulate interstate commerce, so states can't. So both are correct, but the question might be looking for one of them.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because the Constitution explicitly forbids states from coining money, while the Commerce Clause is about federal regulation, but states can still regulate some aspects unless federal law preempts.

Wait, the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power, so states can't regulate interstate commerce if Congress is doing so. So under the Articles, states could, but under the Constitution, they can't once Congress acts.

Hmm, maybe the question is looking for option D. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, the question is from a multiple-choice, so perhaps the intended answer is D: Coining money.

Alternatively, another approach: The Articles of Confederation did not grant the federal government the power to regulate commerce, so the states had that power. The Constitution does give the federal government that power, so the states lose it.

So the correct answer is G: Regulating interstate commerce.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The question is about what the Articles granted to the states that the Constitution didn't. So if under the Articles, the states could regulate interstate commerce, but under the Constitution, they can't, then G is correct.

Similarly, under the Articles, states could coin money, under the Constitution, they can't, so D is correct.

So which one is the correct answer as per the options given?

The options are A-I as listed.

Looking back at the options, the question is phrased correctly, so perhaps both D and G are correct, but in the given options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G: Regulating interstate commerce. Because the Articles didn't give the federal government that power, so the states had it, but the Constitution took it away.

Alternatively, the answer is D: Coining money. Because the Articles allowed it, Constitution prohibited.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the more commonly cited difference is that under the Articles, states could issue their own currency, which was a problem. So the answer might be D.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think I need to make a choice. Based on what I remember, the correct answer is D: Coining money.

The question asks which power was granted to the states by the Articles of Confederation but not by the Constitution. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed in detail:

- **Option A**: The Articles of Confederation did not grant states the power to enforce national laws; this power was weak under the Articles and strengthened under the Constitution. Not correct.
- **Option B**: The process for authorizing constitutional amendments was different under the Articles, requiring unanimous consent, but this is not a power granted to the states. Not correct.
- **Option C**: Establishing foreign diplomatic relations was not effectively handled under the Articles, and the Constitution gives this power to the federal government. Not correct.
- **Option D**: Under the Articles, states could coin their own money, leading to economic chaos. The Constitution explicitly forbids states from coining money, granting this power exclusively to the federal government. This fits the criteria of a power granted by the Articles but not by the Constitution.
- **Option E**: The power to declare war was held by the federal government under the Articles, with state consent, and remains with Congress under the Constitution. Not correct.
- **Option F**: The Articles had no president, so states could not appeal to one. Not correct.
- **Option G**: The Articles did not grant the federal government the power to regulate interstate commerce, so states had this power by default. The Constitution, however, gives this power to the federal government through the Commerce Clause. This also fits the criteria of a power granted by the Articles but not by the Constitution.
- **Option H**: Both the Articles and the Constitution allow states to tax citizens directly. Not correct.
- **Option I**: Representation in Congress existed under both the Articles and the Constitution, though the structure changed. Not correct.

Both **D** and **G** fit the criteria, but the question asks for a singular power. The correct answer is **D: Coining money**, as it is a commonly cited example of a power the Articles granted to states that the Constitution explicitly prohibited.

Answer: D
