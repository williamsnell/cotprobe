Okay, so I have this question about legumes, and I need to figure out which option is not a legume. Let me start by recalling what legumes are. From what I remember, legumes are plants that produce their seeds in pods. They belong to the family Fabaceae, which is a pretty big group. Legumes are known for their nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes them good for soil health.

The options given are A through G, and the question is asking which are not legumes. So I need to go through each one and see if they fit into the legume category.

Option A: Peas. Yeah, peas are definitely legumes. I think they're one of the most common examples. They grow in pods, so that's a clear yes.

Option B: Soybeans. Soybeans are legumes too. They're used in a lot of products and are known for their protein content. So B is a legume.

Option C: Peanuts. Hmm, wait. I've heard that peanuts are legumes, but I'm a bit confused because they're often called nuts. But no, peanuts are actually legumes because they grow underground in pods. So C is a legume.

Option D: Radishes. Radishes are root vegetables. They have that spicy flavor and are crunchy. I don't think they're legumes. Legumes are more like beans, lentils, etc. Radishes belong to the Brassicaceae family, I believe. So D might be the correct answer here.

Option E: Lentils. Lentils are definitely legumes. They're used in soups and curries and are a great source of protein. So E is a legume.

Option F: Beans. There are many types of beans, like kidney beans, black beans, etc. All of them are legumes. So F is a legume.

Option G: Chickpeas. Also known as garbanzo beans, chickpeas are legumes. They're used in hummus and other dishes. So G is a legume.

Putting it all together, the only option that's not a legume is D: Radishes. So the answer should be D.
