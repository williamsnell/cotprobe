Question:

A man owned a piece of land with a run-down log cabin on it. He lost interest in it, letting tax bills pile up and failing to maintain it. In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?

Options:

A: No, because the statutory period had not been met when the owner filed for ejectment.
B: Yes, because they maintained the grounds of the property.
C: Yes, because they had exclusive possession of the property.
D: Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.
E: Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.
F: No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.
G: No, because they knew there was an absentee owner.
H: Yes, because they made improvements to the property.
I: No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.
J: No, because they did not have a legal claim to the property.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this adverse possession question. Adverse possession is a legal doctrine where someone can gain ownership of a property if they meet certain criteria. From what I remember, the typical requirements are that the possession must be open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, and continuous for a certain statutory period.

Let's break down the facts given. The man owns a piece of land with a cabin. He lost interest, so taxes piled up, and the cabin wasn't maintained. In 1990, a homeless couple moves in. They restore the cabin, fence the perimeter, and maintain the grounds. They also start paying the taxes, even though they know there's an absentee owner. 

In 2000, the owner comes back and asks them to pay rent. They agree and pay for two years, but then stop after talking to a lawyer. The statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011, the owner files an ejectment action. The question is whether the couple can prevail on adverse possession.

So the key points here are the timeline. They moved in 1990. The owner comes back in 2000, so that's 10 years. They pay rent for two years (2000-2002), then stop. The statutory period is 20 years, so they need to have met the requirements for 20 years.

Now, adverse possession requires the possession to be continuous and uninterrupted. If they started paying rent, that might change the nature of their possession. Because paying rent implies that they're recognizing the owner's title, right? So from 2000 to 2002, they were tenants, paying rent. That would interrupt the adverse possession because their possession was no longer hostile; they were acknowledging the owner's rights.

So from 1990 to 2000 is 10 years of adverse possession. Then 2000-2002, they're tenants, so that's not adverse. From 2002 to 2011 is 9 more years. So total adverse time would be 10 + 9 = 19 years, which is less than the required 20. 

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. So they need 20 years of continuous adverse possession. Let's check the timeline again. They started in 1990. Owner comes in 2000, that's 10 years. Then they pay rent for two years, so up to 2002. Then they stop paying rent. So from 2002 to 2011 is 9 years. So total adverse years would be 10 (1990-2000) + 9 (2002-2011) = 19 years. That's one year short of the 20 required.

So the statutory period isn't met. Therefore, they can't claim adverse possession. So looking at the options:

Option A says no because statutory period wasn't met when the owner filed. That would be correct because they only had 19 years.

Option D says yes because over 20 years. But wait, 1990 to 2011 is 21 years, but the adverse possession was interrupted. So they didn't have continuous possession for 20 years.

Option G says no because they knew the owner. But knowing the owner doesn't necessarily defeat adverse possession if the other elements are met.

Option I says no because hostile possession was interrupted. That's also a possible reason. Because when they paid rent, their possession was no longer hostile. So the interruption breaks continuity.

So which is the correct option? The question is whether the statutory period was met when the owner filed in 2011. The period from 1990-2000 is 10 years, then 2002-2011 is 9, totaling 19, so not 20. So answer A is correct because the period wasn't met.

Alternatively, option I is about interruption. But the main issue is the total time. So if they needed 20 years and only had 19, that's the reason. So answer A.

The couple cannot prevail on a theory of adverse possession because the statutory period of 20 years was not met. Adverse possession requires continuous, uninterrupted, and hostile possession for the statutory period. Here, the couple occupied the property from 1990 to 2000, which is 10 years of adverse possession. However, when the owner returned in 2000 and they agreed to pay rent for two years (2000-2002), this interrupted their adverse possession. After stopping rent payments in 2002, they resumed possession until 2011, adding 9 more years. This totals 19 years of adverse possession, which is one year short of the required 20 years. Therefore, the statutory period was not satisfied when the owner filed the ejectment action in 2011.

Option A correctly identifies that the statutory period had not been met, making it the correct answer.
