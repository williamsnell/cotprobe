Question:

A 35-year-old man comes to the office because of 1-week history of mid low back pain that radiates down his right leg. The pain began after the patient lifted a heavy box onto his truck. He rates his current pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. He has been unable to find a comfortable position and has been sleeping in a recliner. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, and he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday and Saturday nights. BMI is 27 kg/m2 . He appears uncomfortable and stands during the physical examination. Vital signs are normal. Straight-leg raise test is positive on the right, with loss of right ankle reflex. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?

Options:

A: Piriformis syndrome
B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus
C: Compression fracture of the spine
D: Ankylosing spondylitis
E: Osteophyte formation
F: Spondylolisthesis
G: Lumbar spinal stenosis
H: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction
I: Hypertrophy of the facet joints

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through it carefully.

The patient is a 35-year-old man with mid low back pain radiating down his right leg for a week. The pain started after lifting a heavy box. He rates the pain 8/10, can't find a comfortable position, and has been sleeping in a recliner. His medical history is unremarkable, no medications. He smokes a pack a day for 25 years and drinks beer on weekends. BMI is 27, so slightly overweight. He's uncomfortable and stands during the exam. Vital signs are normal.

Physical exam findings: Straight-leg raise test is positive on the right, loss of right ankle reflex. The rest is normal.

The options are from A to I. I need to pick the most likely diagnosis.

Okay, let's break this down. The patient has back pain radiating down the leg, which suggests a radicular pain, possibly from nerve root compression. The straight-leg raise test (SLR) is positive, which is often indicative of sciatic nerve irritation, commonly due to a herniated disc. Loss of ankle reflex (Achilles reflex) points to S1 nerve root involvement because that reflex is mediated by the S1 nerve root.

So, when a disc herniates, it can compress the nearby nerve root. The most common area for disc herniation is the lower lumbar spine, like L4-L5 or L5-S1. This would cause the symptoms he's experiencing. The SLR test being positive supports this, as it's a common sign of a herniated disc compressing the sciatic nerve.

Let me go through the options:

A: Piriformis syndrome. This typically causes buttock pain and sometimes sciatic pain due to the piriformis muscle irritating the sciatic nerve. But the positive SLR and loss of reflex are more indicative of nerve root compression rather than piriformis. Plus, piriformis might not cause reflex changes.

B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus. That sounds like a herniated disc. The nucleus pulposus is the gel-like center of the disc. When it herniates, it can compress nerves. So this could be the right answer.

C: Compression fracture. That usually occurs in older patients with osteoporosis or after trauma. He's 35 and only lifted a heavy box, so unless he has osteoporosis, which isn't mentioned, this is less likely.

D: Ankylosing spondylitis. This is an inflammatory arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. It usually starts in younger adulthood but presents with chronic back pain and stiffness, often with morning stiffness. He's had pain for a week, which is acute, so probably not this.

E: Osteophyte formation. Osteophytes are bone spurs that can occur with aging or degenerative disc disease. They can cause stenosis but might not cause such acute symptoms. Plus, he's only 35, so less likely.

F: Spondylolisthesis. This is a slippage of a vertebra. It can cause nerve compression. It might present with similar symptoms, but often it's more chronic. Also, the presence of a positive SLR points more directly to disc herniation.

G: Lumbar spinal stenosis. Typically presents in older adults, causing pain with walking (neurogenic claudication). He's young, so less likely.

H: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction. This would cause pain in the lower back, possibly radiating to the buttocks, but usually not down the leg in a radicular pattern. Also, wouldn't cause a positive SLR or loss of reflex.

I: Hypertrophy of the facet joints. Facet joint issues can cause back pain and sometimes refer pain to the legs, but again, the specific findings here (positive SLR, reflex loss) point more to nerve root compression.

So the most likely diagnosis is B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus, which is a herniated disc. This explains the acute onset after lifting, the radicular pain, positive SLR, and loss of reflex at S1.

The patient is a 35-year-old man with a 1-week history of mid low back pain radiating down his right leg, starting after lifting a heavy box. He reports an 8/10 pain score, inability to find a comfortable position, and has been sleeping in a recliner. His medical history is unremarkable, but he has a significant smoking history and consumes alcohol on weekends. His BMI is 27, and he appears uncomfortable, standing during the examination. Vital signs are normal. Key physical findings include a positive straight-leg raise (SLR) test on the right and loss of the right ankle reflex, with no other abnormalities.

The symptoms suggest radicular pain due to nerve root compression. The positive SLR test is a strong indicator of sciatic nerve irritation, commonly caused by a herniated disc. The loss of the ankle reflex (Achilles reflex) points to S1 nerve root involvement, which is consistent with a herniated disc at the L5-S1 level. This is the most likely diagnosis given the acute onset after lifting, radicular pain pattern, and specific physical findings.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Piriformis syndrome** typically causes buttock pain and sciatic irritation but does not explain the loss of reflex or positive SLR test.
- **B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus** refers to a herniated disc, which aligns with the clinical presentation of nerve root compression, positive SLR, and reflex loss.
- **C: Compression fracture** is unlikely in a 35-year-old without a history of osteoporosis or significant trauma.
- **D: Ankylosing spondylitis** is an inflammatory condition that presents with chronic back pain and stiffness, not acute symptoms as seen here.
- **E: Osteophyte formation** is more associated with chronic degenerative changes and less likely to cause acute radicular symptoms.
- **F: Spondylolisthesis** involves vertebral slippage and can cause nerve compression but is less likely to present acutely in this context.
- **G: Lumbar spinal stenosis** typically affects older adults and presents with neurogenic claudication, not acute radicular pain.
- **H: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction** causes lower back and buttock pain but does not typically result in a positive SLR or reflex loss.
- **I: Hypertrophy of the facet joints** can cause back pain but does not explain the specific findings of nerve root compression.

The most likely diagnosis is **B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus**, as it best explains the patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings.
