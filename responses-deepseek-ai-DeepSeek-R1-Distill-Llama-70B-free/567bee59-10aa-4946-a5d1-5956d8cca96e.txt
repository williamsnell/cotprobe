Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the directivity of a short dipole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my antenna theory, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that directivity is a measure of how directional an antenna's radiation pattern is. It's the ratio of the maximum radiation intensity to the average radiation intensity over all directions. So the higher the directivity, the more focused the antenna's beam.

Wait, I think for a dipole antenna, especially a short dipole, the directivity isn't super high. Short dipoles are like simple antennas, maybe like the ones used in old radios or something. They don't have a lot of elements to focus the beam, so their directivity is probably around 2 or so.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that a half-wave dipole has a directivity of around 2.14, but a short dipole is even simpler, so maybe it's less? Or is that the same thing? Oh wait, no. A short dipole is much shorter than a half-wavelength, right? Like, its length is much smaller than the wavelength. So maybe the directivity is lower than that of a half-wave dipole.

Wait, another thought. I think the directivity of a short dipole is often considered to be about 1.5 or so. Or was that the gain? Oh wait, directivity and gain are related but not the same. Gain includes the efficiency, while directivity is just the directional part. But for a lossless antenna, gain equals directivity. So in this case, if it's a short dipole without losses, the gain would be the same as the directivity.

I'm trying to remember the formula. Oh, right! The directivity D of a short dipole is given by D = (3/2) * (sin(90))^2, but wait, I'm not sure. Or is that for a half-wave dipole at a certain point? Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, I remember that for a Hertzian dipole (which is a very short dipole), the radiation pattern is doughnut-shaped, and the directivity is 1.5. Wait, no, wait. The maximum radiation is in the plane perpendicular to the dipole. So the directivity would be the maximum value divided by the average.

The average radiation intensity for an isotropic radiator is the same in all directions. So the directivity D is the ratio of the peak intensity to the average. For a Hertzian dipole, the radiation pattern has a sin^2(theta) dependence, where theta is the angle from the dipole's axis.

So the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta). The maximum occurs when theta is 90 degrees, where sin(theta) is 1, so intensity is maximum there. To find the directivity, I need to calculate the maximum intensity divided by the average intensity.

The average intensity would be the integral of the intensity over all solid angles, divided by 4pi (the total solid angle). The intensity I(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the average is (integral from 0 to pi of sin^2(theta) * 2pi sin(theta) dtheta) divided by 4pi.

Wait, let me compute that. The integral part is ∫ I(theta) dΩ, where dΩ is 2π sinθ dθ. So the average is (1/(4π)) * ∫ (sin²θ) * 2π sinθ dθ, integrated from θ=0 to π.

Simplifying, that's (1/(4π)) * 2π ∫ sin³θ dθ from 0 to π. The 2π and 4π simplify to 1/2. So it's (1/2) * ∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π.

The integral of sin^3θ dθ over 0 to π. Hmm, sin^3θ can be written as sinθ (1 - cos²θ). So the integral becomes ∫ sinθ (1 - cos²θ) dθ from 0 to π.

Let me make a substitution: let u = cosθ, so du = -sinθ dθ. When θ=0, u=1; θ=π, u=-1.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=1 to u=-1 of (1 - u²) (-du) ) = ∫ from -1 to 1 (1 - u²) du.

Which is [u - (u^3)/3] from -1 to 1. Plugging in 1: (1 - 1/3) = 2/3. Plugging in -1: (-1 - (-1/3))= (-1 + 1/3)= -2/3. The difference is (2/3) - (-2/3) = 4/3.

So the integral is 4/3. So going back, the average is (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3.

Wait, but the maximum intensity is when sinθ is 1, so I_max is proportional to 1^2 = 1.

So the directivity D = I_max / average = (1) / (2/3) ) = 3/2 = 1.5.

Wait, so the directivity is 1.5. Looking at the options, option G is 1.5.

But wait, wait, I thought earlier that a short dipole's directivity is 2. Or was that for a half-wave dipole? Let me think again. A half-wave dipole has a directivity around 2.14, which is about 2.14. But a short dipole, being a Hertzian dipole, should have a directivity of 1.5.

So the correct answer should be option G: 1.5.

The directivity of a short dipole can be determined by analyzing its radiation pattern. A short dipole, such as a Hertzian dipole, has a radiation intensity proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle from the dipole's axis. The directivity \( D \) is defined as the ratio of the maximum radiation intensity to the average radiation intensity over all directions.

The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin(\theta) = 1 \), giving \( I_{\text{max}} \propto 1^2 = 1 \). To find the average intensity, we integrate \( \sin^2(\theta) \) over all solid angles and divide by \( 4\pi \). The integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_0^\pi \sin^3(\theta) d\theta = \int_{-1}^1 (1 - u^2) du = \frac{4}{3},
\]

where \( u = \cos(\theta) \). The average intensity is then:

\[
\text{Average intensity} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \cdot 2\pi \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

The directivity is therefore:

\[
D = \frac{I_{\text{max}}}{\text{Average intensity}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = 1.5.
\]

Thus, the directivity of a short dipole is \( 1.5 \), which corresponds to option G.
