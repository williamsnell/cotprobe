Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the sum of -9 plus (-8) using a number line. Hmm, number lines can be a bit tricky for me sometimes, but I'll try to visualize it.

Alright, let me think. On a number line, numbers increase from left to right. So zero is in the middle, positive numbers go to the right, and negative to the left. Starting at -9, that's nine units to the left of zero. Now, I need to add another negative number, which is -8. Adding a negative is like moving further in the negative direction, right?

So, if I'm at -9 and I add -8, I should move another eight units to the left. Let me count that. Starting at -9, moving left one unit would be -10, then -11, -12, and so on until I reach -17 after eight steps. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Another way to think about it: adding two negatives should make the number more negative. So -9 plus (-8) is like -(9 + 8), which is -17. Yeah, that makes sense because 9 plus 8 is 17, and since both are negative, the result is negative 17.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is -17. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let's see, other options: G is -18, which would be if I added 9 and 8 and then added another 1, which isn't the case here. So yeah, -17 is correct.

The sum of −9 and −8 is calculated by moving further into the negative direction on the number line. Starting at −9, adding −8 moves you eight units to the left, resulting in −17. This can also be understood as −(9 + 8) = −17. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
