Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking. The question is to find the value of 6 multiplied by 24 divided by (8 minus 5). Hmm, okay. I remember that when solving math problems, I need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So first, I should look at the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is (8 - 5). Let me calculate that. 8 minus 5 is 3. So now the problem simplifies to 6 * 24 ÷ 3.

Next, I have to handle the multiplication and division from left to right. So first, I'll do the multiplication: 6 multiplied by 24. Let me think, 6 times 24... 6 times 20 is 120, and 6 times 4 is 24, so adding those together gives 144. So now the expression is 144 divided by 3.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check that multiplication. 24 times 6: 24*6. 20*6 is 120, 4*6 is 24. 120+24 is indeed 144. So now I have 144 divided by 3.

Dividing 144 by 3. Let's see, 3 goes into 14 four times (3*4=12), remainder 2. Bring down the 4, making 24. 3 goes into 24 eight times. So 144 ÷ 3 is 48. Wait, but 3 times 48 is 144, right? Yes.

So putting it all together: 6 *24 is 144, divided by 3 is 48. So the result is 48.

Now looking at the options, option A is 48. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. Let's go through it again. The original problem is 6•24÷(8−5). 

First, (8-5)=3. So it becomes 6*24/3. 

Some people might get confused about whether to multiply 6 by (24/3) or multiply 24 by (6/3). But according to order of operations, it's left to right for multiplication and division. So first multiply 6 and 24 to get 144, then divide by 3, which gives 48. Alternatively, you could think of it as 6*(24/3) which is 6*8=48. Either way, same result.

So I'm confident the answer is 48, which is option A.

The problem requires evaluating the expression \(6 \times 24 \div (8 - 5)\). Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), we first solve the parentheses: \(8 - 5 = 3\). This simplifies the expression to \(6 \times 24 \div 3\). 

Next, perform the multiplication and division from left to right. First, calculate \(6 \times 24 = 144\). Then, divide \(144 \div 3 = 48\). 

Thus, the result is 48, which corresponds to option A.
