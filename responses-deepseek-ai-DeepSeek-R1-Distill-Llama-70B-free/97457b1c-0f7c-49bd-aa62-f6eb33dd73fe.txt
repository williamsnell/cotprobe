Okay, so I need to figure out the resistance of this electric toaster. The question says that the toaster takes a current of 5 amperes when connected to a 120-volt circuit. Hmm, I remember something about Ohm's Law from my science class. Oh right, Ohm's Law is V = I * R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. 

So the formula is Voltage equals Current multiplied by Resistance. I think I need to rearrange this to solve for R since the question is asking for resistance. Let me see, if I divide both sides by I, that would give R = V / I. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alright, plugging in the numbers. Voltage V is 120 volts, and current I is 5 amperes. So R equals 120 divided by 5. Let me do that calculation. 120 divided by 5 is 24. So the resistance should be 24 ohms.

Wait, but let me double-check. If I multiply 5 amps by 24 ohms, that should give me the voltage. 5 times 24 is 120, which matches the given voltage. So that checks out. So the resistance is indeed 24 ohms.

Looking at the options, option G is 24 ohms. So the correct answer should be G.

To determine the resistance of the electric toaster, we use Ohm's Law: 

\[ R = \frac{V}{I} \]

Given:
- Voltage (\( V \)) = 120 volts
- Current (\( I \)) = 5 amperes

Substituting the values:

\[ R = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \, \Omega \]

Thus, the resistance of the toaster is 24 ohms. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:

G: 24 ohms
