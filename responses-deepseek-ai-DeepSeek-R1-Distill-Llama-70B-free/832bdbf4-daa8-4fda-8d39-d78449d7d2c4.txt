Question:

Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?

Options:

A: National governments should take a more active role in securing energy resources, potentially through the nationalization of energy companies.
B: Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.
C: The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.
D: The concept of energy security is a construct of the capitalist system and should be rejected in favor of a more equitable distribution of resources.
E: Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.
F: Energy security is best ensured through the privatization of energy resources, allowing for a free-market competition to drive innovation and efficiency.
G: Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.
H: Energy security is not a major concern, as technological advancements will continue to provide new ways to generate energy.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a liberal perspective on future energy security. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options (A to H) aligns with liberal thinking. 

First, I should remember what a liberal perspective typically entails. From what I know, liberalism in international relations often emphasizes free trade, multilateral cooperation, and the idea that states can achieve mutual benefits through cooperation rather than conflict. Liberals also tend to believe in the power of the market and international institutions to solve problems.

Looking at the options:

Option A says national governments should take a more active role, even nationalizing energy companies. That sounds more like a statist or socialist approach, where the government controls key industries. Liberals usually prefer private enterprise and free markets, so A doesn't seem right.

Option B talks about energy scarcity leading to a new order with statism and neo-mercantilism. That implies more state control and competition, which might be a realist perspective. Liberals are more optimistic about cooperation, so B might not be the choice.

Option C states that the global economy is interconnected, so energy security depends on all. It suggests that core powers have the same interests and that conflict over energy is unlikely as long as the market order exists. This sounds very liberal because it's about interdependence and cooperation through markets. Liberals believe in mutual interests and that economic ties prevent conflict.

Option D rejects energy security as a capitalist construct and wants equitable distribution. That's more of a Marxist or critical theory perspective, not liberal. So D is probably not it.

Option E mentions oil underpinning an unequal capitalist order. This seems critical of capitalism, again not a liberal viewpoint. E is likely not the answer.

Option F suggests privatization and free-market competition for energy security. This does align with liberal ideas because they support free markets and private enterprise. However, I'm a bit torn because while F is liberal, option C also seems to fit. I need to consider which is more directly about energy security in a global context.

Option G talks about resource wars and geopolitical confrontation. That's a realist or neo-realist view, expecting conflict over resources. Liberals would be more optimistic about cooperation, so G isn't it.

Option H says energy security isn't a major concern because technology will solve it. While liberals might have some faith in technology, this seems a bit too dismissive. I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Now, comparing C and F. Option C emphasizes global interdependence and mutual interests leading to unlikely conflict, which is a key liberal tenet. Option F is about free markets and privatization, which is also liberal. But the question is about energy security in the future from a liberal perspective. 

In the context of energy security, the interconnected global economy and mutual interests (C) seem to capture the broader liberal view that cooperation through markets prevents conflict. So I think C is the correct answer.

The correct answer is option C, as it reflects the liberal perspective by emphasizing global interdependence, mutual interests, and the belief that cooperation through markets prevents conflict over energy security.

Answer: C
