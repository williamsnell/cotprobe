Okay, so I've got this economics question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Tiger Woods buys a golf ball in England for $1, and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) there is 0.75. I need to find out the total increase in England's real GDP from this purchase. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. So if MPC is 0.75, that means for every extra dollar earned, 75 cents is spent. But wait, in this case, the initial spending is a purchase by Tiger, which is an injection into the economy. So I think this relates to the multiplier effect.

Wait, right! The multiplier effect explains how an initial spending leads to increased overall output. The formula for the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So if the MPC is 0.75, then the multiplier would be 1 divided by (1 - 0.75), which is 1/0.25, equals 4. 

But wait, the initial spending is $1. So the total increase in GDP would be the multiplier multiplied by the initial amount. That would be 4 * $1 = $4. So the total increase is $4.

Looking at the options, option F is $4. So I think the correct answer is F.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The multiplier applies when there's an increase in investment or government spending, right? Because those are injections into the circular flow. So Tiger buying something is an increase in consumption, but wait, in this case, is it consumption or investment? No, Tiger is a consumer, so his purchase is part of consumption. But if the MPC is given, then the initial purchase would start the chain.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The initial $1 purchase by Tiger is the initial injection. Then, the recipients of that $1 (like the store) will spend 75% of it, and so on. So the total spending would be $1 + 0.75 + 0.75^2 + 0.75^3 + ... and so on. That's a geometric series where each term is 75% of the previous one.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is a/(1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. So the sum is 1/(1 - 0.75) = 1/0.25 = 4. So yes, the total increase in GDP is $4. So the answer is F.

I think I got it right.

The question involves calculating the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Tiger Woods' $1 purchase of a golf ball, given that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.75. The MPC represents the fraction of additional income spent on consumption. The multiplier effect, which amplifies the impact of initial spending, is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}}
\]

Substituting the given MPC of 0.75:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4
\]

The total increase in GDP is then the product of the multiplier and the initial spending:

\[
\text{Total Increase in GDP} = \text{Multiplier} \times \text{Initial Spending} = 4 \times \$1 = \$4
\]

Thus, the total increase in England's real GDP is $4, corresponding to option F.

Answer: F
