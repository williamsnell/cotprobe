"And then Shapur, King of Kings, passed away. Then his son Hormizd, King of Kings, rose over the empire. And Hormizd, King of Kings, conferred on me cap and belt and created for me a higher rank and dignity, and at court and in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, throughout the whole empire he gave me more authority and power in matters of the divine services, and created for me the title "Kerdir, Ahura Mazda's [Chief Priest]" after the name of Ahura Mazda, the Deity. And thereupon in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, many divine services were performed in magnificence, and many Warham fires were established, and many magi became happy and prosperous, and many fires and magi were imperially installed…
And then Hormizd, King of Kings, passed away. Then Bahram, King of Kings, son of Shapur, King of Kings, and brother of Hormizd, King of Kings, rose over the empire. And Bahram, King of Kings, also held me in high honor and dignity and at court and in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, gave me authority and power for divine services of every sort. And thereupon in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, many divine services were performed in magnificence and many Warharan fires were established, and many magi became happy and prosperous, and many fires and magi were imperially installed…
And in kingdom after kingdom and place after place throughout the whole empire the services of Ahura Mazda and the gods became preeminent, and great dignity came to the Mazdayanian religion and the magi in the empire, and the gods and water and fire and small cattle in the empire attained great satisfaction, while Ahriman [the evil counterpart to Ahura Mazda] and the demons were punished and rebuked, and the teachings of Ahriman and the demons departed from the empire and were abandoned. And Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Nasoreans [Orthodox Christians], Christians, Maktak [Baptists], and Manichaeans in the empire were smitten, and destruction of idols and scattering of the stores of the demons and god-seats and nests was abandoned."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there were Buddhist communities in Sassanid Persia. The question gives me an excerpt from Kerdir's inscription, and I need to pick the best explanation from the options given.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. Kerdir talks about Hormizd and Bahram, Sassanid kings, and how they promoted the Mazdayanian religion, which is Zoroastrianism. He mentions that under their rule, the Zoroastrian religion became dominant, and other groups like Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, etc., were "smitten." So, Kerdir is boasting about how the empire crushed other religions and promoted Zoroastrianism.

Now, the question is why Buddhists were present in Persia. The options are A to D.

Option A: Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers. That doesn't make sense. If they were trying to convert Buddhists, that would probably reduce the number of Buddhists, not explain why they were there in the first place.

Option B: Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia. I don't think Buddhism is known for an apocalyptic message. Buddhism focuses more on personal enlightenment and the cycle of rebirth, not an apocalyptic end. So this might not be the right reason.

Option C: Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India. I remember that the Silk Road was a major trade route connecting East and West. India is the birthplace of Buddhism, and if Persia was on the trade routes, Buddhist monks and traders might have traveled through or settled there. That makes sense because trade routes often facilitate the spread of religions as people move and interact.

Option D: Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians. The passage actually says that these groups, including Buddhists, were "smitten," which suggests they were persecuted rather than tolerated. So D doesn't seem right.

Putting it together, the presence of Buddhists is likely due to Persia being on trade routes with India. So the best answer is C.

The presence of Buddhist communities in Sassanid Persia is best explained by the empire's location along international trade routes with India. These routes, such as the Silk Road, facilitated the movement of people, goods, and ideas, allowing Buddhist monks and traders to travel and settle in Persia. This aligns with the historical context of religious and cultural exchange along trade networks.

Answer: C
