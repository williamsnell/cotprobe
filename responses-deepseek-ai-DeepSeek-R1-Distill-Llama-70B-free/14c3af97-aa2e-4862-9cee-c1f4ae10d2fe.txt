Answer:
    <think>


To solve the equation \( \frac{48}{88} = \frac{?}{11} \), we can simplify the fraction on the left side first. 

Both 48 and 88 are divisible by 4:
\[
\frac{48 \div 4}{88 \div 4} = \frac{12}{22}
\]

Next, we can simplify \( \frac{12}{22} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{12 \div 2}{22 \div 2} = \frac{6}{11}
\]

This means that \( \frac{48}{88} = \frac{6}{11} \). Therefore, the missing number in the equation is 6.

The correct answer is **H: 6**.

Answer: H
