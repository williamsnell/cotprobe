Question:

Two competing department stores have a radio whose cost is $10.82. Both stores advertise that they sell the radio on a 70% markup. However, store A bases the markup on the selling price, while store B bases it on the cost price. What is the selling price of the radio in the two stores?

Options:

A: Store A: $23.95, Store B: $18.39
B: Store A: $10.82, Store B: $7.57
C: Store A: $18.39, Store B: $23.95
D: Store A: $15.00, Store B: $20.00
E: Store A: $30.00, Store B: $25.00
F: Store A: $18.39, Store B: $36.07
G: Store A: $25.00, Store B: $30.00
H: Store A: $7.57, Store B: $10.82
I: Store A: $20.57, Store B: $25.72
J: Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39

Okay, so I've got this problem here about two department stores that are selling a radio. The radio costs $10.82. Both stores advertise a 70% markup, but they base it differently. Store A uses the markup on the selling price, and Store B uses it on the cost price. I need to find out the selling prices for both stores and pick the right option from A to J.

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on markups and margins, but I think markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. Wait, but sometimes it's expressed as a percentage of cost or of selling price, which changes the calculation. Oh right, if it's a markup based on cost, it's easier because you just add that percentage of the cost to itself. But if it's markup on selling price, that means the cost is a portion of the selling price after markup.

So for Store B, which uses cost-based markup, the calculation should be straightforward. 70% of the cost is the markup. So the selling price would be cost plus 70% of cost. Let me compute that. The cost is $10.82. 70% of 10.82 is... 0.7 * 10.82 = let's see, 10 * 0.7 is 7, 0.82 *0.7 is 0.574. So total is 7.574. Adding that to 10.82 gives 10.82 +7.574 = 18.394. Oh wait, 10.82 plus 7.574 is 18.394, which would round to maybe 18.39, but sometimes they might round up. So Store B's selling price is approximately $18.39.

Now for Store A, which bases the markup on the selling price. Oh, this is a bit trickier. Because the markup is 70% of the selling price. Wait, no, markup is usually based on cost when it's cost-based. But when it's based on selling price, it's a bit different. So the formula for markup based on selling price is:

Markup amount = Selling Price - Cost.

And the markup percentage is (Markup amount / Selling Price) * 100. So in this case, the markup is 70% of the selling price. Wait no, wait: If the markup is 70% on the selling price, then the markup amount is 70% of SP. So the cost would be SP minus 70% of SP. Which is 30% of SP. Because 100% SP -70% markup = 30% which is cost. So Cost = 0.3 * SP.

Wait, let me make sure. So if the markup is 70% on SP, then:

SP = Cost + (Markup)
But Markup is 70% of SP, so:

SP = Cost + 0.7 * SP
Let me rearrange this:

SP - 0.7 SP = Cost
0.3 SP = Cost
So SP = Cost / 0.3

Oh right, because 0.3 is 30%, so the cost is 30% of the selling price. So SP is cost divided by 0.3.

So for Store A, cost is $10.82. So SP = 10.82 / 0.3. Let me compute that. 10.82 divided by 0.3.

Hmm, 0.3 times 36 is 10.8, right? Because 0.3 * 36 = 10.8, so 10.82 is a bit more. 36.0666... So approximately 36.0666, which is about $36.07 when rounded to the nearest cent. So Store A's selling price would be around $36.07.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option J says Store A: $36.07, Store B: 18.39. Option F says Store A:18.39, Store B:36.07. So which one is correct?

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the stores. Oh wait no, because Store A is markup on selling price, which is higher. Because when you base markup on SP, the selling price is higher. So Store A's price is higher than Store B's.

Store B's price was 18.39, Store A's is 36.07. So looking at the options, option J has Store A as 36.07 and Store B as 18.39, which matches. So the correct option would be J.

Wait, but looking again, let me make sure I didn't flip the options. Option J is Store A: 36.07, Store B:18.39. Yes, that's what we got.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To determine the selling prices of the radio in both stores, we need to calculate the markup for each store based on their respective methods:

1. **Store B (Markup based on Cost Price):**  
   The cost of the radio is $10.82, and the markup is 70% of the cost.  
   Markup amount = \( 0.7 \times 10.82 = 7.574 \).  
   Selling price = Cost + Markup = \( 10.82 + 7.574 = 18.394 \), which rounds to approximately $18.39.

2. **Store A (Markup based on Selling Price):**  
   The markup is 70% of the selling price (SP). Let the selling price be \( SP \).  
   The cost is 30% of the selling price because \( SP - 0.7 \times SP = 0.3 \times SP \).  
   Therefore, \( SP = \frac{\text{Cost}}{0.3} = \frac{10.82}{0.3} \approx 36.07 \).

Thus, the selling price for Store A is approximately $36.07, and for Store B, it is approximately $18.39. Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Option J: Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39.**
