C: Backward conditioning has no impact on the response to the conditioned stimulus.
D: Backward conditioning strengthens the response to the conditioned stimulus.
E: Backward conditioning weakens the unconditioned response.
F: Backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning.
G: Backward conditioning is highly effective.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about backward conditioning. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question asks about backward conditioning procedures and their usual effect, including an explanation of inhibitory conditioning. The options are A to J, so I'll need to go through each step carefully.

I remember that classical conditioning involves associating stimuli with responses. There's forward conditioning and backward conditioning. In forward, the conditioned stimulus (CS) comes before the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Like Pavlov's dogs hearing the bell before the food. That makes the CS predict the UCS, leading to an excitatory response.

But backward conditioning is the opposite, right? The UCS comes first, and then the CS is presented. Wait, no, wait. No, backward conditioning is when the CS is presented after the UCS. So the order is UCS first, then CS. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, in backward conditioning, the CS comes after the UCS. So the sequence is UCS, then CS. That's different from forward where it's CS before UCS.

So what effect does this have? I think I remember that backward conditioning is less effective. Because the CS follows the UCS, it doesn't serve as a good predictor. It's harder for the organism to associate the CS with the UCS because the CS comes after the event. So the conditioning isn't as strong as forward.

Wait, but wait. There's another possibility. Backward conditioning might lead to inhibitory conditioning. What's that about? Inhibitory conditioning is when a stimulus actually suppresses a response. Like, if you have a CS that's presented after the UCS, maybe the organism learns that the CS doesn't predict the UCS. So when the CS is presented again without the UCS, it inhibits the response.

So putting it together: backward conditioning is when CS is presented after UCS. This usually leads to inhibitory conditioning, where the CS doesn't elicit the conditioned response as much and might even suppress it.

Looking at the options now:

Option F says backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning. That sounds right. Let me check other options.

Option I says it's when the CS is presented long after the UCS. That also sounds correct as a description of backward conditioning.

Wait, the question is two parts: describe the procedure and the usual effect, including inhibitory conditioning. So the correct answer needs to address both.

Wait, the question is phrased as, "what is the usual effect of this kind of conditioning? Include an explanation of inhibitory conditioning." So the answer should probably mention that backward conditioning results in inhibitory conditioning.

Looking at the options:

Option F says backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning. So that would be the effect.

Looking for another option that describes backward conditioning. Option I describes the procedure, saying the CS is presented long after the UCS. So if the question is about the procedure, I would choose I, but the question is about the effect and includes inhibitory.

Wait, the question is asking two things: describe the backward conditioning procedure and what's the usual effect, including inhibitory.

Wait, the first part is "describe a backward conditioning procedure." The second part is the usual effect.

So the correct answer needs to address both. Or perhaps each option is a statement about it, not each part as a separate question.

Wait, the options are each possible answers to the question. So the correct answer should correctly state what backward conditioning is and its usual effect.

Looking again, option F says it usually results in inhibitory conditioning. Option I says it's when the CS is presented long after the UCS.

Wait, the question is two parts: what is backward conditioning (procedure) and what's the usual effect, which includes explaining inhibitory conditioning.

So the answer should have both. But looking at the options, each option is a single statement. So perhaps the correct answer is F, because it directly addresses the effect involving inhibitory conditioning.

Wait, but let's think. The first part is the procedure. So backward conditioning is when the CS comes after the UCS. The usual effect is inhibitory conditioning, where the CS becomes a inhibitor.

So the correct answer is F: Backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning.

Alternatively, option I describes the procedure correctly. So if the question is only about the procedure, I is correct. But the question is about both the procedure and the effect.

Wait, the question is: "Describe a backward conditioning procedure. What is the usual effect of this kind of conditioning? Include an explanation of inhibitory conditioning."

So the correct answer should probably be F, which states the effect (inhibitory conditioning), but also, perhaps the procedure is implied.

But maybe another option combines both. Let's look again.

Option I: Backward conditioning is a procedure where the conditioned stimulus is presented long after the unconditioned stimulus. So that's the procedure. So the effect is inhibitory.

So the question's first part is the procedure, which I is correct. The second part is the effect, which F is correct. But since the question is a single question, the answer should describe both. But the options are each a single statement. So perhaps the correct answer is F because it answers the effect part. Or I because it answers the procedure.

Wait, perhaps the first part of the question is about the procedure, and the second about the effect.

The options are each possible answers. So the correct answer is F because it correctly states the effect (inhibitory conditioning). The procedure is described in option I, but the question also asks about the effect, which is F.

So the options are about the entire question. So the answer is F.

Backward conditioning is a procedure in classical conditioning where the conditioned stimulus (CS) is presented after the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). This is different from forward conditioning, where the CS precedes the UCS. In backward conditioning, the CS does not serve as a strong predictor of the UCS because it follows the UCS, making it less effective for excitatory conditioning. Instead, backward conditioning often results in inhibitory conditioning, where the CS learns to suppress or inhibit the conditioned response rather than elicit it. This occurs because the organism learns that the CS does not reliably predict the UCS, leading to a reduction or suppression of the response.

Among the options provided, **Option F** correctly states that backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning, addressing both the procedure and its usual effect.

Answer: F
