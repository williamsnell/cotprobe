Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.
Source 1
Indians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.
—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493
Source 2
It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.
—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542

Options:

A: Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.
B: Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.
C: Columbus was unaware of the atrocities committed by his men.
D: De las Casas was writing with the benefit of hindsight.
E: Columbus wanted to portray a positive image of the Spaniards to the King and Queen.
F: De las Casas was writing in response to Columbus's accounts.
G: De las Casas was not present during the encounters he described.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this history question. Let's read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about two excerpts, one from Christopher Columbus and another from Bartholomew de las Casas. The task is to determine why their descriptions of Spanish interactions with natives are so different.

Source 1 is from Columbus's letter in 1493. He describes how the natives were trading goods like cotton and gold for things like broken pottery and glass. He says he forbade this unfair trading because it was unjust. Instead, he gave them nice things without taking anything in return. His goal was to make them friendly towards the Spanish so they could become Christians and help provide resources.

Source 2 is from de las Casas's book in 1542. He paints a much darker picture, talking about the Spanish treating the natives brutally, like wolves or lions. He mentions the drastic reduction in population from 3 million to just 200, and says the Spanish were after gold and quick riches, using torture and other methods.

The options are from A to J, and I need to pick which best explains the differences in their accounts.

First, let's consider the context. Columbus wrote this in 1493, very early after his first voyage. De las Casas wrote much later, in 1542, almost 50 years later. So de las Casas had the benefit of seeing the long-term effects and more events.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Columbus was biased in favor of himself. That's possible because he was writing to the King and Queen, so he might want to present himself positively.

Option B: Columbus's men were nicer. But it's more likely that Columbus's own actions were different, or perhaps he was just portraying it that way, not that his men were inherently nicer.

Option C: Columbus was unaware of atrocities. That's possible if his men did bad things behind his back, but the excerpt shows he was aware of unfair trading and forbade it. So maybe he didn't see or acknowledge worse actions.

Option D: De las Casas was writing with hindsight. Yes, because he wrote later, he could see the overall impact over time, which Columbus couldn't have known in 1493.

Option E: Columbus wanted to portray a positive image. That makes sense because he's reporting to the monarchs; he'd want to show success and good relations to gain favor.

Option F: De las Casas was responding to Columbus. Not sure, but the question is about the difference in interactions, not whether one was responding to the other.

Option G: De las Casas wasn't present. Maybe, but he was a bishop in the area, so perhaps he had access to reports or was there later.

Option H: Exaggerating to support African slavery. I'm not sure about that, but de las Casas is known for criticizing Spanish treatment, not necessarily promoting African slavery.

Option I: De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave. His account is a critique, so maybe, but the question is about the difference in descriptions.

Option J: Different interpretations of the same events. But the events described are from different times. Columbus is talking about his initial interactions, and de las Casas is talking about later events. So maybe they're not the same events.

Wait, but the question says "the interactions" as described. So perhaps they are talking about the same period but from different perspectives.

Alternatively, the difference is that Columbus was trying to present a positive image for the monarchs, while de las Casas was writing a critique later on.

Looking again, Option E says Columbus wanted to portray a positive image. That seems likely because he's addressing the King and Queen, so he'd want to show that he's making good progress, converting natives, etc.

Option D is also a strong candidate because de las Casas had the benefit of seeing the long-term consequences, which Columbus couldn't have known at the time.

But the question is about the interactions described in the two accounts. So perhaps it's more about their perspectives and purposes in writing.

Columbus was trying to gain favor, so he presented a positive interaction. De las Casas, writing later, was exposing the atrocities.

So which option explains this difference? Option E suggests Columbus was presenting a positive image, which would account for the disparity. Option D explains that de las Casas had hindsight, which is also a factor.

But the question asks for the best explanation for the differences between the interactions as described. So perhaps the answer is E because Columbus was trying to present a positive image, making the interactions seem peaceful and mutually beneficial, while de las Casas was showing the brutal reality.

Alternatively, could it be D? If de las Casas had the benefit of hindsight, he could see the overall destruction, so his account reflects that, whereas Columbus was only writing about his initial voyage.

Hmm, but the question is about the interactions, not the outcomes. So maybe E is better.

Wait, but another angle: Option J says they had different interpretations of the same events. But were they writing about the same events? Columbus wrote about his first voyage, while de las Casas wrote about the subsequent treatment. So perhaps they're writing about different times.

So the main reason for the difference is that de las Casas was writing later and could see the long-term effects, whereas Columbus was writing early on and perhaps downplayed or didn't see the negative interactions.

So Option D would explain why de las Casas's account is so different.

Alternatively, Option E explains why Columbus's account is positive, while de las Casas's is negative. So the differences could be because of both factors, but the question is asking for the best account.

Wait, the options are possible answers, and I have to choose the best one.

So the best explanation would be that de las Casas was writing with hindsight, which allowed him to see the broader and longer-term impact, whereas Columbus was writing in the moment, focusing on his initial positive interactions.

So Option D would be the best answer.

Alternatively, Option E is also a solid contender because Columbus's purpose was to present a positive image.

I'm a bit torn between D and E.

But looking back, the question is about the interactions as described. So why did Columbus describe the interactions as peaceful and de las Casas as brutal?

One reason could be that Columbus was trying to present a good image (E), while de las Casas was exposing the truth (D, as he had more info over time).

So both factors might be at play, but the options are separate.

If I have to choose one, Option E seems to directly address Columbus's motivations, while D addresses de las Casas's perspective.

But the question is about the differences between the two accounts. So perhaps the best answer is that de las Casas had hindsight, which allowed him to report the bigger picture, while Columbus was in the early stages.

So I think the correct answer is D: De las Casas was writing with the benefit of hindsight.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: De las Casas was writing with the benefit of hindsight.

Yes, that makes sense because he wrote 50 years after Columbus, so he could see the consequences of the Spanish actions, which Columbus couldn't have known in 1493.

So the answer should be D.

The question asks for the best explanation of the differences between Christopher Columbus's and Bartholomew de las Casas's descriptions of Spanish interactions with natives. Columbus's account (1493) portrays peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions, emphasizing his efforts to conciliate the natives and facilitate conversion to Christianity. In contrast, de las Casas's account (1542) describes brutal treatment, massive population decline, and exploitation by the Spanish.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Columbus was biased in favor of himself. While plausible, this doesn't fully explain the stark difference in descriptions.
- **Option B**: Columbus's men were nicer. This is unlikely, as the difference is more about perspective and context than the behavior of Columbus's men.
- **Option C**: Columbus was unaware of atrocities. This is improbable, as Columbus acknowledges and forbids unfair trading in his account.
- **Option D**: De las Casas was writing with hindsight. This is a strong explanation, as de las Casas wrote decades later, allowing him to see the long-term consequences of Spanish actions, which Columbus could not have known in 1493.
- **Option E**: Columbus wanted to portray a positive image. This is also plausible, as Columbus was writing to the King and Queen and would have wanted to present his actions favorably.
- **Option F**: De las Casas was responding to Columbus. There is no evidence that de las Casas was directly responding to Columbus's accounts.
- **Option G**: De las Casas wasn't present during the encounters. While possible, de las Casas was a bishop in the region and likely had access to detailed reports.
- **Option H**: De las Casas exaggerated to support African slavery. This is not supported by the context; de las Casas is known for criticizing Spanish treatment, not promoting slavery.
- **Option I**: De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas. While his account is critical, this doesn't directly explain the difference in descriptions.
- **Option J**: Columbus and de las Casas had different interpretations of the same events. This is less likely, as they wrote about different time periods.

The best explanation is **Option D**, as de las Casas's later perspective allowed him to document the broader and long-term consequences of Spanish actions, whereas Columbus's account reflects the early stages of interaction and his efforts to present a positive image.

Answer: D
