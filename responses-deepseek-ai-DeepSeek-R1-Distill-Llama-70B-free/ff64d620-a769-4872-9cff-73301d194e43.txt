Okay, so I have this pulley problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question says again. It's about a pulley system with two fixed and two movable pulleys, making four supporting strands. The efficiency is 60%, and the applied effort is 50 pounds. I need to find out how much weight can be lifted.

Hmm, I remember that pulley systems change the amount of force needed to lift a weight, depending on the number of strands supporting the load. Each strand adds to the mechanical advantage. So, if there are four strands, that means the total force without considering efficiency would be four times the effort, right? Wait, no, wait. Actually, the number of strands is the mechanical advantage. So if there are four strands, the ideal mechanical advantage is four. That means, without friction or losses, the effort needed would be the weight divided by four. But since there's efficiency involved, I need to factor that in.

Efficiency in pulley systems is the ratio of the ideal work done to the actual work done, or something like that. Oh right, efficiency is (useful load / total effort) × 100%, maybe. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the actual weight lifted to the ideal weight. Let me think. Oh wait, the formula I remember is: Efficiency = (Weight Lifted) / (Mass × g × number of strands). Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps the formula is a bit different.

Let me think. The formula for efficiency in pulleys is usually Efficiency (η) = (Load / Effort) × (number of strands). No, wait, that's not right. Because the effort has to support both the load and the weight of the pulleys themselves, or maybe it's considering friction. So maybe it's better to approach it using the basic work equation.

Work done by the effort is the effort times the distance. Work done to lift the load is the load times the distance, but considering the number of strands (which affects how much distance is moved). Wait, but in pulley systems, the distance the effort moves is equal to the distance the load moves multiplied by the number of strands. So if the load is lifted by 'd', the effort applies force over 'n*d' distance, where n is the number of strands (mechanical advantage). So the work input is Effort * (n*d), and work output is Load * d.

But efficiency is the ratio of work output to work input. So efficiency η = (Load * d) / (Effort * n * d). The distances 'd' cancel out, so η = Load / (Effort * n).

Wait, that makes sense. So η = Load / (Effort × n). So we can rearrange that to solve for Load: Load = η × Effort × n.

In this problem, the number of strands is four because there are four supporting strands. So n=4. The efficiency is 60%, which is 0.6 as a decimal. The effort applied is 50 pounds. So plugging in the numbers:

Load = 0.6 * 50 lb * 4.

Let me calculate that. 50 lb times 4 is 200 lb. Then multiply by 0.6. 200 * 0.6 is 120 lb. So the load would be 120 lb.

Wait, but let me double-check. So Load = η × Effort × n.

Yes, that's correct. So 0.6 * 50 *4 = 120 lb.

Looking at the options, option I is 120 lb. So the answer should be I.

To determine the weight that can be lifted by an applied effort of 50 pounds in a pulley system with four supporting strands and an efficiency of 60%, we use the formula for efficiency in pulley systems:

\[
\eta = \frac{\text{Load}}{\text{Effort} \times n}
\]

Rearranging to solve for the load:

\[
\text{Load} = \eta \times \text{Effort} \times n
\]

Here:
- Efficiency (\(\eta\)) = 60% = 0.6,
- Effort = 50 pounds,
- Number of strands (\(n\)) = 4.

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Load} = 0.6 \times 50 \times 4 = 120 \, \text{lb}
\]

Thus, the weight that can be lifted is 120 lb. The correct answer is:

**I: 120 lb**
