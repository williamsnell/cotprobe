D: The court should apply international negligence law.
E: The court should apply the negligence law of the state where the truck driver's company is headquartered.

Okay, so I've got this question about a truck driver and a bus driver involved in a collision, and I need to figure out which state's negligence law applies in a federal diversity action. Hmm, I remember that in federal court, when there's diversity jurisdiction, the court has to apply state law, right? But wait, how exactly does that work?

So the truck driver is from State A, and the bus driver is from State B. The accident happened in State B. The truck driver sued in federal court in State B, so the court is sitting in State B. The question is about which negligence law they'll useâ€”State A's, State B's, or some other?

I think this is about conflict of laws. When a federal court hears a diversity case, it applies the substantive law of the state where it's sitting, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh wait, isn't there a rule about this? Like, the federal court uses the choice of law rules of the state in which it's situated. So if the federal court is in State B, they'll apply whatever State B's courts would apply in terms of choosing between State A and State B's laws.

So, for example, if State B's courts would apply their own negligence law because the accident happened there, then the federal court would do the same. Or does it depend on more factors, like where the parties are from?

Wait, I think it's the first part. So the federal court doesn't decide on its own which state's law to apply; instead, it defers to the forum state's (State B) choice of law rules. So the federal court would look to see what State B's courts would do in this situation. If State B's courts, when faced with a case where the accident occurred in their state, would apply their own negligence law, then the federal court applies State B's law.

So looking at the options, the correct approach is for the federal court to determine which law a State B court would apply and then apply that. So option F says exactly that: the court should determine which state's negligence law a State B court would apply and apply that. That makes sense.

Other options don't fit. Option I says apply State B's law because that's where the accident happened. But that's assuming that State B's choice of law would point to their own law, which might be the case, but the correct reason is that the federal court follows State B's choice of law rules, not just because the accident happened there.

Option J suggests applying State A's law because that's the truck driver's state. But that's unlikely because the accident occurred in State B, so State B's courts would probably apply their own laws.

So the correct answer is F.

In a federal diversity action, the court applies the substantive law of the state in which it is sitting. When determining which state's law to apply, the federal court defers to the choice of law rules of the forum state (State B in this case). This means the federal court will apply the negligence law that a State B court would apply under similar circumstances. 

Option F correctly reflects this principle, as it states that the court should determine which state's negligence law a State B court would apply and then apply that law. Other options either misstate the basis for selecting the applicable law or assume the law without considering the forum state's choice of law rules.

Answer: F
