Okay, so I've got this question about a father taking out a term insurance policy, and I need to figure out the answers to four parts. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question says the father takes out a 5-year term insurance policy to ensure his son's education. The policy is for $15,000. The parts are (a) through (d), and each asks about different aspects of the policy. I'll probably need to calculate or recall how term life insurance works.

Starting with part (a): How much is his semiannual premium for $15,000 worth of insurance? Hmm, I remember that term life insurance premiums are typically level for the term, but the exact amount can depend on factors like the insured's age, health, and the policy length. Since the policy is to age 50 and it's a 5-year term, I'm guessing the father is currently 45 or 50? Wait, the question says "policy to age 50," so maybe it's a 5-year term starting now, and he's 45, because in 5 years he'll be 50. So he's 45 now.

Wait, the options give specific numbers, so I might need to recall some standard premium rates. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to know that the annual premium for a $15,000 5-year term at age 45 is a certain amount, and then halved for semiannual payments.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me think. Term life insurance often has premiums that increase with age. For a 5-year term, the rates are usually lower than whole life. Let's say for a 45-year-old, the annual premium for $15k might be around $150 per year. That would make the semiannual payment $75. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe it's higher.

Wait the options list semiannual as around $100 to $150. Option A is $100.95, B is $150, etc. Maybe the correct semiannual is around $100. So for part (a), the semiannual premium would be, say, $100.95, which is option A's first value. But I'm not entirely certain.

Moving on to part (b): How much will he pay over the five years? So if the semiannual premium is, say, $100.95, then each year he pays twice that, so 2*100.95=201.90 per year. Over 5 years, that's 5*201.90=1009.50, which matches option A's second value. But wait, option C's second value is $1209.50, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the semiannual is $100.95, but the total would be 10 payments (5 years * 2). So 10 * 100.95 = 1009.50. So option A's (b) is $1009.50, which aligns.

Wait, but let me think again. Another thought: term insurance often has premiums that are level for the term. So if he's paying $100.95 semiannually, over 5 years, that's 10 payments, totaling 1009.50, which would be part (b)'s answer.

Part (c) asks how much he will receive at the end of five years. Now, term life insurance typically doesn't have a cash value, so if he survives the term, he doesn't get anything back. That means part (c) should be $0. So looking at the options, I need an option where (c) is $0. Looking at the choices:

Option A: (c) $0. So A is possible. Option C has (c) as $15k, which would be if it was a return of premium, but standard term doesn't do that.

Part (d): If he died at age 51, what would his beneficiary receive? Since the policy is for 5 years (until he's 50), if he dies at 51, that's after the policy ends. So the beneficiary would get nothing. So (d) should be $0. But wait, looking at the options, let's see. Option A says (d) $15k. So that can't be right. Because if he dies after the policy term, there's no payout. So if the policy is until age 50, and he dies at 51, the term has expired, so no payment.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the policy is a 5-year term, but when was it issued? If the father is taking the policy to cover until his son's education is done, which perhaps is when he's 50. So the policy term is 5 years, starting when he is 45, ending at 50. So if he dies at 51, that's after the term, so no payout.

So for (d), the correct answer is $0. Now, looking at the options, which option has (d) as $0?

Option A: (d) $15,000 → incorrect for (d). So A can't be right because (d) is wrong.

Option C: (c) is $15k, which is wrong because term doesn't return anything upon survival. So (c) should be 0, so C is wrong.

Option B: (a) $150, (b) $1800 (which would be 10 payments of $150? 10*150=1500, but (b) is 1800, which doesn't add up. So probably B is wrong.

Option D: (a) $142.95, (b) $1429.50 (which is 10 * 142.95), (c) $0, and (d) $15,000. So (d) is 15k, which is incorrect because he died after the term. So D's (d) is wrong.

Option E: (a) $150, (b) $1500 (10 *150=1500, so correct). (c) 0. (d) $15k. So (d) would be wrong because he's beyond the term.

Option F: (a) $142.95, (b) $1429.50, (c) $15k → no, because (c) should be 0.

Option G: (c) is 0, but (d) is $15k, which is wrong.

Option H: (c) is $15k, which is wrong.

Option I: (c) is $15k, wrong.

Option J: (a) $100.95, (b) $1209.50, (c) $15k, (d) 0. But (c) should be 0, so J is wrong.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking again for (d): correct answer is $0. Which options have (d) as 0?

Option A: (d) 15k → no.

Option B: (d) 0 → yes. So let's check B.

Option B: (a) $150, (b) $1800, (c) 15k, (d) 0. Wait, but part (c) is about what he receives at end of 5 years. If the policy is term life, he gets nothing, so (c) should be 0. Option B has (c) as 15k → wrong.

So perhaps I need to look again. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding part (c). Does it refer to any returns or cash value? Term life usually has no cash value, so (c) is 0.

Wait, but maybe the question is about term life with return of premium. But the question doesn't specify that, it just says term insurance. So (c) should be 0.

So looking again, which options have (c) as 0 and (d) as 0? Wait, no, (d) should be 0 only if he dies after the term. So:

Looking for (c) 0 and (d) 0? No, because (d) is 0 only if he dies after term. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me list each option:

Option A: (a) 100.95, (b)1009.50, (c)0, (d)15k → (d) incorrect.

Option B: (a)150, (b)1800, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) incorrect.

Option C: (a)100.95, (b)1209.50, (c)15k, (d)15k → both (c) and (d) incorrect.

Option D: (a)142.95, (b)1429.50, (c)0, (d)15k → (d) incorrect.

Option E: (a)150, (b)1500, (c)0, (d)15k → (d) incorrect, (b)=10*150=1500, correct.

Option F: (a)142.95, (b)1429.50, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Option G: (a)120.50, (b)1205, (c)0, (d)15k → (d) wrong.

Option H: (a)120.50, (b)1446, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Option I: (a)142.95, (b)1715.40, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Option J: (a)100.95, (b)1209.50, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Hmm, none of the options seem to have both (c) 0 and (d) 0 except maybe none, but let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in (d). If the father dies at age 51, but the policy is a 5-year term. Let me recheck the timeline. The father takes the policy to age 50, so the term is until age 50. So if he's 45 when taking the policy, it's a 5-year term, ending when he's 50. So if he dies at 51, that's after the policy has ended, so no payout. So (d) is 0.

So looking for an option where (c) is 0 and (d) is 0. But looking at the options, only option J has (d) 0, but (c) is 15k. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe the policy is a 5-year term starting at age 50, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the policy is from age 50, but that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the policy is for 5 years, but the payment is made at the end of each period. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I got (d) wrong. Let me think again: the policy is to age 50, so it's a 5-year term. So if the father is currently 45, the policy covers until he's 50. If he dies at 51, that's after the coverage period, so the beneficiary gets nothing. So (d) is 0.

Looking again, the only option that has (d) as 0 is option B and option J (wait, no, J has (d) 0? Let me check: option J is (a)100.95, (b)1209.50, (c)15k, (d)0. So J's (d) is 0, but (c) is 15k, which is wrong because (c) should be 0.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding part (c). Does part (c) refer to a return of premium? So if it's a term policy with return of premium, then at the end of the term, you get all the premiums back. But the question doesn't specify that. It just says a 5-year term insurance policy. So I think (c) should be 0.

So now I'm stuck because none of the options have (c) 0 and (d) 0. Let me read the options again carefully.

Wait, looking at option A: (c) 0, (d) 15k → (d) is wrong.

Option D: (c) 0, (d)15k → (d) wrong.

Option E: (c) 0, (d)15k → wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each part again.

(a) Semiannual premium: Let's say it's $100.95. So (a) would be A, C, or J.

(b) Total over 5 years: 10 payments of 100.95 → 1009.50, which is option A's (b) and J's (b) is 1209.50, which is higher. Wait, 10 * 100.95 = 1009.50, so option A and C have (b) as 1009.50 and 1209.50. Wait, option C's (b) is 1209.50, which would be 12 payments of 100.95 (but 5 years is 10 semiannual payments). So option C's (b) is wrong.

So the correct (b) is 1009.50, which is option A and C's (b) is higher, so A's (b) is correct.

But option A's (d) is 15k, which is wrong because the death is after the term.

So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, which can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating (d).

Wait, perhaps the policy is for 5 years starting at age 50. No, the question says "policy to age 50," meaning it ends at 50. So if he's 45 now, the policy lasts until he's 50. So if he dies at 51, no payout.

Wait, perhaps the policy is a 5-year term starting at age 50. That would mean the coverage is from 50 to 55. But the question says the father is taking the policy to ensure his son's education, which I assume is for the next five years, so perhaps the policy is from age 45 to 50.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the policy as being in force until the father reaches 50. So if he dies at 51, that's after the policy has ended, so no payment. So (d) is 0.

Looking again, the only option that has (d) as 0 and (c) as 0 is none. Wait, let me check all options again.

Wait, option J has (d) 0 but (c) 15k. So that's not it.

Option D: (d)15k, which would be wrong.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of each part:

(a) Semiannual premium: The options vary, but I think the correct semiannual is around $100. So option A's (a) is 100.95, which seems plausible.

(b) Total payment: 10 payments of 100.95 → 1009.50, which is option A's (b).

(c) Payment at end of 5 years: Term life doesn't return anything, so 0. So option A's (c) is 0.

But (d): Death at 51 → 0, but option A's (d) is 15k, which is wrong.

So none of the options fit all parts correctly. But since the options don't have all correct answers, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about (d). Maybe the policy is for 5 years from now, so if he takes it at 45, the coverage is until 50. If he dies at 51, it's after the term, so no benefit. So (d) is 0.

Looking at the options, the only one with (d) 0 is option B and J. But option B's (c) is 15k, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is option J, but part (c) is wrong because it's 15k.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a term policy with return of premium. In that case, (c) would be the total premiums paid, perhaps plus interest. But the question doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps part (c) refers to the death benefit if he dies during the term. But no, because part (c) is what he receives at the end of five years, which would be upon survival, not death.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about each option's (a) through (d):

Option A: (a) 100.95, (b)1009.50, (c)0, (d)15k → So (d) is wrong.

Option B: (a)150, (b)1800, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Option C: (a)100.95, (b)1209.50, (c)15k, (d)15k → (c) and (d) wrong.

Option D: (a)142.95, (b)1429.50, (c)0, (d)15k → (d) wrong.

Option E: (a)150, (b)1500, (c)0, (d)15k → (d) wrong.

Option F: (a)142.95, (b)1429.50, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Option G: (a)120.50, (b)1205, (c)0, (d)15k → (d) wrong.

Option H: (a)120.50, (b)1446, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Option I: (a)142.95, (b)1715.40, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

Option J: (a)100.95, (b)1209.50, (c)15k, (d)0 → (c) wrong.

So none of the options have all four parts correct as per my analysis. But that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the policy is a 5-year term, and the premium is $150 annually, making semiannual $75. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps the semiannual is $100.95, which would make the annual $201.90, but I'm not
