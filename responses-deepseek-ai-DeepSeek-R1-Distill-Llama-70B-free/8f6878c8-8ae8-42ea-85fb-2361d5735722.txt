Okay, so I've got this problem about group theory, and I'm trying to figure out whether the two statements are true or false. Let me think through each statement step by step.

First, Statement 1 says: If H is a subgroup of G and a is an element of G, then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H. Hmm. I remember that in group theory, aH is the left coset of H containing a, right? So cosets are like shifted versions of the subgroup H.

Wait, but I thought that a coset aH is not a subgroup unless a is in H. Because if a is in H, then aH would be the same as H itself, which is a subgroup. But if a is not in H, then aH isn't a subgroup because it doesn't contain the identity element. Because for aH to be a subgroup, the identity e must be in aH. That would mean that a multiplied by some h in H gives e, so h would be a^{-1}. But if a is in H, then a^{-1} is also in H, so e would be in aH. But if a is not in H, then a^{-1} isn't in H, so e isn't in aH, making aH not a subgroup. 

So Statement 1 seems to be true. Because only when a is in H, aH becomes H, which is a subgroup. Otherwise, it's just a coset and not a subgroup. So the "if and only if" condition holds here.

Now moving on to Statement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b are in G, then aH equals bH if and only if ab is in H. Wait, I'm not sure about this. I remember that two cosets aH and bH are equal if and only if a^{-1}b is in H. Because aH and bH being equal means every element in aH is in bH and vice versa. So if you take any element a h (h in H), it should be in b H. So a h = b k for some k in H. Then a^{-1} b = h k^{-1}, which is in H because H is a subgroup, so closed under inverse and multiplication.

So the condition is a^{-1}b is in H, not ab. So Statement 2 says ab is in H, which would be the condition if, like, the product of a and b is in H, but that's not the right condition for aH = bH. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Suppose aH = bH. Then a must be in bH, so there exists some h in H such that a = b h. Then ab^{-1} = h, which is in H. So that's the condition: ab^{-1} is in H. So Statement 2 is incorrect because it's talking about ab being in H, not ab^{-1}.

So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. So looking at the options, option C is True, False. So the answer should be C.

Statement 1: If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( a \in G \), then \( aH \) is a subgroup of \( G \) if and only if \( a \in H \). This is true because \( aH \) is a left coset of \( H \). For \( aH \) to be a subgroup, it must contain the identity element \( e \), which happens only if \( a \in H \). If \( a \in H \), then \( aH = H \), which is a subgroup. If \( a \notin H \), \( aH \) does not contain \( e \) and is not a subgroup. Thus, the "if and only if" condition holds.

Statement 2: If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( a, b \in G \), then \( aH = bH \) if and only if \( ab \in H \). This is false. The correct condition for \( aH = bH \) is that \( a^{-1}b \in H \), not \( ab \in H \). If \( aH = bH \), then \( a \in bH \), so \( a = bh \) for some \( h \in H \), implying \( a^{-1}b = h \in H \). Therefore, the statement is incorrect because it claims \( ab \in H \), which is not the right condition.

Based on this analysis, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. The correct answer is:

C: True, False

Answer: C
