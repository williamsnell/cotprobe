Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this fluid dynamics problem. The question is about checking the continuity of two flows and determining their vorticity. Hmm, I remember that vorticity has something to do with rotation in the fluid, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

So, the problem gives two flows:

(a) vt=6r, vr=0
(b) vt=0, vr=-5/r

I think I need to check each flow for continuity and then find the vorticity. Wait, but what's the continuity equation again? Oh right, in polar coordinates, the continuity equation for an incompressible flow is (∂(rv_r)/∂r) + (∂v_θ)/∂θ = 0. But wait, if the flow is axisymmetric, the v_θ component might be zero, right? Or maybe not, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should just check if the given velocity fields satisfy the continuity equation.

Wait, wait, the continuity equation in polar coordinates for incompressible flow is:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + (1/r) ∂v_θ/∂θ + ∂v_z/∂z = 0

But if the flow is two-dimensional (like in the r-θ plane), then v_z is zero and ∂v_z/∂z is zero. Also, if the flow is axisymmetric, then ∂v_θ/∂θ is zero because there's no dependence on θ. So the equation simplifies to (1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r = 0.

So for each flow, I can plug in v_r and see if this equation holds.

Starting with flow (a): v_r=0. So plugging into the equation: (1/r)* ∂(r*0)/∂r = (1/r)*0 = 0. So continuity holds. That's good.

Now for flow (b): v_r = -5/r. So let's compute (1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r.

r v_r = r*(-5/r) = -5. So ∂(r v_r)/∂r is the derivative of -5 with respect to r, which is zero. So (1/r)*0 = 0. So continuity holds here as well.

Wait, but both (a) and (b) satisfy continuity? So that's settled. Now moving on to vorticity.

Vorticity is the curl of the velocity field. In polar coordinates, for a two-dimensional flow (assuming v_z is zero and no dependence on z), the vorticity ω is given by the z-component of the curl, which is:

ω = (1/r)( ∂(r v_θ)/∂r ) - (1/r) ∂v_r/∂θ )

Wait, but in these flows, do we have a v_θ component? Looking back, the problem gives v_t and v_r. Wait, maybe I confused the variables. Oh, wait, in cylindrical coordinates, the velocity components are usually (v_r, v_θ, v_z). So in the problem, (a) has v_t=6r. Wait, is that the tangential velocity? Like v_θ? Because in polar, 't' might denote tangential, which would be the θ direction. So in (a), v_r=0, and v_θ=6r.

Similarly, in (b), v_t=0, so v_θ=0, and v_r=-5/r.

So for each flow, compute the vorticity.

Starting with flow (a): v_r=0, v_θ=6r.

The vorticity ω is (1/r) ∂(r v_θ)/∂r − (1/r) ∂v_r/∂θ.

Let's compute each term.

First term: (1/r) ∂(r *6r)/∂r.

r*6r =6 r². So derivative with respect to r is 12 r. Multiply by (1/r): 12 r*(1/r)=12.

Second term: (1/r) ∂v_r/∂θ. Since v_r=0, the derivative is zero. So the second term is zero.

So ω =12 -0=12.

Wait, but wait, another thought: did I mix up the terms? Because sometimes the formula for vorticity in cylindrical coordinates can be tricky. Let me double-check the formula.

The general expression for the z-component of vorticity in cylindrical coordinates is:

ω_z = (1/r) [∂(r v_θ)/∂r - ∂v_r/∂θ]

So yes, that's correct. So for (a), ω_z=12.

So flow (a) has a vorticity of 12, which is non-zero, so it's rotational.

Now flow (b): v_r= -5/r, v_θ=0.

So compute each term.

First term: (1/r) ∂(r*v_θ)/∂r. Since v_θ=0, this is (1/r)*0=0.

Second term: -(1/r) ∂v_r/∂θ. Since v_r is -5/r and doesn't depend on θ (axisymmetric), ∂v_r/∂θ=0. So the second term is also zero.

Wait, so ω_z=0 - 0 =0. So flow (b) has zero vorticity, meaning it's irrotational.

Wait, but wait again. Let me recalculate flow (b) more carefully.

Flow (b) has v_r= -5/r and v_θ=0.

So,

ω_z = (1/r)[ ∂(r*v_θ)/∂r ] - (1/r) [ ∂v_r/∂θ ]

But v_θ is zero, so first term is zero. The second term is (1/r) times the derivative of v_r with respect to θ. Since v_r doesn't depend on θ, ∂v_r/∂θ=0. So ω_z=0.

Hence, flow (b) is irrotational.

Putting it all together:

Flow (a) has vorticity 12, so it's rotational.

Flow (b) has vorticity 0, so it's irrotational.

Now looking at the options:

Option C says: Flow (a) is rotational with a vorticity of 12. Flow (b) is irrotational with vorticity 0.

Yes, that's what I got.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: Flow (a) is rotational with 12, Flow (b) is irrotational with 0.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the continuity and vorticity of the given flows, we analyze each flow in polar coordinates. The continuity equation for an incompressible, axisymmetric, two-dimensional flow simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r v_r)}{\partial r} = 0
\]

For vorticity, the z-component of the curl of the velocity field in cylindrical coordinates is:

\[
\omega_z = \frac{1}{r} \left( \frac{\partial (r v_\theta)}{\partial r} - \frac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta} \right)
\]

### Flow (a): \(v_t = 6r\), \(v_r = 0\)
- Here, \(v_r = 0\) and \(v_\theta = 6r\).
- **Continuity**: Substituting \(v_r = 0\) into the continuity equation, \(\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r \cdot 0)}{\partial r} = 0\), so continuity holds.
- **Vorticity**: Using the formula for \(\omega_z\):
  - First term: \(\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r \cdot 6r)}{\partial r} = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (6r^2)}{\partial r} = \frac{1}{r} \cdot 12r = 12\).
  - Second term: \(-\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{1}{r} \cdot 0 = 0\).
  - Thus, \(\omega_z = 12 - 0 = 12\).
- Since \(\omega_z \neq 0\), the flow is rotational.

### Flow (b): \(v_t = 0\), \(v_r = -\frac{5}{r}\)
- Here, \(v_r = -\frac{5}{r}\) and \(v_\theta = 0\).
- **Continuity**: Substituting \(v_r = -\frac{5}{r}\) into the continuity equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r \cdot -\frac{5}{r})}{\partial r} = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (-5)}{\partial r} = \frac{1}{r} \cdot 0 = 0
  \]
  so continuity holds.
- **Vorticity**: Using the formula for \(\omega_z\):
  - First term: \(\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r \cdot 0)}{\partial r} = \frac{1}{r} \cdot 0 = 0\).
  - Second term: \(-\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{1}{r} \cdot 0 = 0\).
  - Thus, \(\omega_z = 0 - 0 = 0\).
- Since \(\omega_z = 0\), the flow is irrotational.

### Final Results
- **Flow (a)**: Rotational with a vorticity of 12.
- **Flow (b)**: Irrotational with a vorticity of 0.

### Correct Option
The correct answer is **C**: Flow (a) is rotational with a vorticity of 12, Flow (b) is irrotational with a vorticity of 0.
