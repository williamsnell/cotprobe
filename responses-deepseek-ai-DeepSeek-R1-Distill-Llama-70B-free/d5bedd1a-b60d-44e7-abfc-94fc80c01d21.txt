Okay, so I've got this problem here about probability density functions and quantization stuff. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem has three parts: (a) finding the step size S with four quantization levels, (b) finding the constant K, and (c) determining the variance of the quantization error.

Starting with part (a). So, the signal's probability density function is given as f(x) = K e^(-|x|) for |x| < 4 and zero otherwise. For part (a), I need to find the step size S when there are four quantization levels.

Wait, quantization levels. Oh right, when you quantize a signal, you divide its range into intervals (called quantization levels or intervals). The step size S would be the width of each interval. But wait, the signal's range here is from -4 to 4, so the total range is 8 units.

If there are four quantization levels, and the signal is symmetric around zero, I think each level would cover a symmetric portion. But wait, the number of levels and intervals might be a bit tricky. Let me think. For M quantization levels, you usually have M intervals. But here, since the signal is symmetric, maybe each side (positive and negative) has M/2 intervals? Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, four quantization levels would split the entire range into four equal parts? Or perhaps, since it's symmetric, each side is split into two intervals each, making four in total.

Wait, no, the total range from -4 to 4 is 8 units. If we have four intervals, each would be of width S = total range / number of intervals. So 8 divided by 4 is 2. So S would be 2. That makes sense because each step is 2 units. So for part (a), S=2.

Okay, moving to part (b): finding the constant K. The probability density function must integrate to 1 over the entire range. So the integral of f(x) from -4 to 4 must be 1.

So f(x) = K e^(-|x|). Let's compute the integral. Because the function is even (symmetric about y-axis), I can compute from 0 to4 and double it.

Integral from -4 to 4 of K e^(-|x|) dx = 2 * Integral from 0 to4 of K e^(-x) dx.

Compute the integral: e^(-x) integrates to -e^(-x). Evaluated from 0 to4: (-e^(-4)) - (-e^(0)) )= ( -e^-4 + 1 ) = 1 - e^-4.

Multiply by 2 and K: 2K (1 - e^-4) =1.

So 2K(1 - 1/e^4) =1. Let's compute 1 - 1/e^4. e^4 is about 54.598, so 1/e^4 ≈ 0.0183. So 1-0.0183≈0.9817.

So 2K * 0.9817 ≈1 → K≈1/(2 * 0.9817) → 1/(1.9634) ≈0.5093. So K is approximately 0.5093. So part (b)'s answer is K=0.5093.

Now part (c): variance of quantization error when f(x) isn't constant over each level. Hmm, quantization error variance.

Wait, when the pdf isn't constant over each quantization interval, we can't assume that the error is uniformly distributed within each interval. Oh wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, maybe the quantization is non-uniform here.

But wait, in part (a), we found that the step size is 2. So each quantization interval is of length 2. But given that the pdf is f(x)=K e^{-|x|}, which is highest at x=0 and decreases as |x| increases. So the levels aren't spaced in a way that the pdf is uniform in each interval. Therefore, to find the variance, I think we have to calculate the mean squared error over all intervals.

Wait, the variance of the quantization error is given by the sum over each interval of the variance within that interval multiplied by the probability of being in that interval.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me recall the formula. The variance of quantization error (σ²) is the expected value of (x - x_q)^2, where x_q is the quantized value. So, it's E[(x - x_q)^2]. Which can be calculated as the sum over each interval I_i of the integral over I_i of (x - x_q_i)^2 f(x) dx, where x_q_i is the quantized value for that interval.

But how exactly are the quantization levels set? Since the problem says four quantization levels, I'm assuming that the levels are equally spaced. So each interval is from -4 to -2, -2 to 0, 0 to 2, 2 to 4. Each of length 2.

Wait, but each interval is 2 units. Now, for each interval, what is x_q_i? Typically, in quantization, the quantized value is the midpoint of the interval if using uniform quantization. So for the interval [-4,-2], the midpoint is at (-3). Similarly, [-2,0] → midpoint at (-1), [0,2] → 1, [2,4] →3.

Wait, but if the quantization levels are the midpoints, then each interval is centered around those levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the quantization levels are at the boundaries. Hmm, but I think it's more standard to use the midpoints as the representation levels.

So for each interval I_i, the quantized value x_q_i is the midpoint.

So for each interval, I need to compute the integral of (x - x_q_i)^2 f(x) dx over that interval.

Then sum all these contributions, each multiplied by their probability (which is the integral of f(x) over the interval).

Wait, no. The expectation is the sum of the integrals.

Wait, no, the expectation is the sum over each interval of the integral over that interval of (x - x_q_i)^2 f(x) dx.

So let me outline the steps.

1. Divide the range into four intervals, each of length 2. So the intervals are:
   a. [-4, -2]
   b. [-2, 0]
   c. [0, 2]
   d. [2,4]

Wait, but the function is symmetric about zero, so maybe I can compute for one side and double it, considering symmetry.

Each interval's midpoint (quantized value) is at:
a. (-4 + (-2))/2 = -3
b. (-2 + 0)/2 = -1
c. (0 +2)/2=1
d. (2+4)/2=3

So x_q_i for each interval I_i is -3, -1, 1, 3.

Now, for each interval, compute the integral of (x - x_q_i)^2 * f(x) dx.

Due to symmetry, the contributions from [-4,-2] and [2,4] will be the same. Similarly, [-2,0] and [0,2] will be the same. So I can compute two integrals and double them.

So let's compute for the first interval [-4,-2], then multiply by 2 for the symmetric interval [2,4]. Similarly, compute for [-2,0], multiply by 2 for [0,2].

So:

σ² = 2 * [ integral_{-4}^{-2} (x - (-3))² f(x) dx + integral_{-2}^{0} (x - (-1))² f(x) dx ]

Because the other two intervals (positive sides) will contribute the same as the first two.

Wait, no, because the function f(x) is symmetric, so when x is in [-4,-2], f(x)=K e^{x} (since |x|= -x when x<0). But when x is positive, it's K e^{-x}. Wait, no, |x| is x for positive and -x for negative, so f(x) is K e^{-|x|} = K e^{-x} for x>0, and K e^{x} for x <0.

So for the negative intervals, like [-4,-2], e^{x} would be e^{-|x|} as x is negative. So when x is negative, say x=-a, a>0, then e^{-|x|} = e^{a}.

Wait, no, let me correct. For x in [-4, -2], x is negative, so |x|= -x. So f(x)= K e^{-|x|} = K e^{x} (since |x|= -x, and e^{- (-x)}=e^{x}).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if x is negative, |x| is positive, so e^{-|x|} = e^{- (positive)}. For x = -3, |x|=3, so e^{-3}. So for x in [-4,-2], f(x)= K e^{- ( -x ) }? No, wait:

Wait, x is in [-4,-2], so |x|=4 to 2. So f(x) = K e^{-|x|} = K e^{- (4 to 2) }.

Wait, no, |x| is the absolute value. So for x=-a where a is between 2 and4, |x|=a. So e^{-|x|}=e^{-a}.

Similarly, for x in [-2, 0], |x|=0 to 2; e^{-|x|}=e^{-a} where a is from 0 to2.

So for the interval [-4,-2], f(x) = K e^{-|x|} = K e^{-a}, where a= |x|, which ranges from 2 to4. So integrating over x from -4 to -2 is the same as integrating a from 2 to4, but with x = -a, dx= -da. But since the limits would invert, it becomes integrating from a=4 to a=2, which is the same as integrating from 2 to4 with a negative sign, but when you switch the limits, it becomes positive.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to make a substitution. Let me change variable for the negative intervals.

Let’s compute the first integral for [-4,-2]:

Integral_{-4}^{-2} (x - (-3))^2 * K e^{-|x|} dx.

Since x is negative in this interval, let me substitute x = -y, where y ranges from 2 to4 (since x=-4 → y=4; x=-2 → y=2).

So dx = -dy, and when x=-4, y=4; x=-2, y=2.

So the integral becomes:

Integral_{y=4}^{y=2} ( (-y) - (-3) )^2 * K e^{-y} (-dy).

Wait, flipping the limits to 2 to4:

= Integral_{2}^{4} ( (-y +3) )^2 * K e^{-y} dy.

Simplify (-y +3)² = (3 - y)^2.

So the integral is K ∫ (3 - y)^2 e^{-y} dy from 2 to4.

Similarly, the second integral is for the interval [-2,0]. Let's substitute x=-z, where z ranges from 0 to2.

Integral_{-2}^0 (x - (-1))^2 K e^{-|x|} dx.

x = -z → dx=-dz.

(z goes from 0 to2 when x goes from -2 to0).

So the integral becomes:

Integral_{z=0}^{z=2} [ (-z) - (-1) ]^2 K e^{-z} (-dz) → flipping limits:

= Integral_{2}^{0} [ (-z +1) ]^2 K e^{-z} (-dz) → which is same as Integral_{0}^{2} [ (1 - z) ]^2 K e^{-z} dz.

So, now, each of these integrals can be computed.

But let's compute them step by step.

First, let's compute the first integral (from x=-4 to -2, which becomes y=2 to4 after substitution):

I1 = K ∫_{2}^{4} (3 - y)^2 e^{-y} dy.

Let me expand (3 - y)^2: 9 -6y + y².

So,

I1 = K [ ∫ (9 e^{-y} -6y e^{-y} + y² e^{-y}) dy ] from 2 to4.

The integral of e^{-y} is -e^{-y}.

Integral of y e^{-y} dy can be found via integration by parts. Let me recall that ∫ y e^{-y} dy = -y e^{-y} + ∫ e^{-y} dy = -y e^{-y} - e^{-y} + C.

Similarly, ∫ y² e^{-y} dy: use integration by parts twice. Let u = y² → du=2y dy. dv = e^{-y} dy → v= -e^{-y}.

So, ∫ y² e^{-y} dy = -y² e^{-y} + ∫ 2y e^{-y} dy.

We already know ∫ y e^{-y} dy is -y e^{-y} - e^{-y}.

So, ∫ y² e^{-y} dy = -y² e^{-y} + 2 [ -y e^{-y} - e^{-y} ] + C → -y² e^{-y} - 2y e^{-y} - 2 e^{-y} + C.

Putting it all together:

I1 = K [ 9 ∫e^{-y} dy -6 ∫ y e^{-y} dy + ∫ y² e^{-y} dy ] evaluated from 2 to4.

Compute each part at y=4 and y=2.

Compute each integral:

A = 9 ∫e^{-y} dy from2→4 → 9 [ -e^{-y} ] from 2→4 → 9 [ (-e^{-4}) - (-e^{-2}) ] = 9 (e^{-2} - e^{-4} )

B = -6 ∫ y e^{-y} dy from2→4 → -6 [ (-y e^{-y} - e^{-y}) ] from2→4 → -6 [ ( (-4 e^{-4} - e^{-4}) ) - ( (-2 e^{-2} - e^{-2}) ) ]

Simplify:

At y=4: (-4 e^{-4} - e^{-4}) = -5 e^{-4}
At y=2: (-2 e^{-2} - e^{-2}) = -3 e^{-2}
So,

B = -6 [ (-5 e^{-4}) - (-3 e^{-2}) ) ] → -6 [ -5 e^{-4} +3 e^{-2} ] → -6*(-5 e^{-4} +3 e^{-2}) → 30 e^{-4} -18 e^{-2}

C = ∫ y² e^{-y} dy from2→4 → [ -y² e^{-y} - 2y e^{-y} - 2 e^{-y} ] evaluated from2→4.

At y=4: - (16) e^{-4} - 8 e^{-4} - 2 e^{-4} = (-16 -8 -2) e^{-4} = -26 e^{-4}

At y=2: - (4) e^{-2} -4 e^{-2} -2 e^{-2} = (-4 -4 -2) e^{-2} = -10 e^{-2}

So the integral C from2→4 is (-26 e^{-4}) - (-10 e^{-2}) )= -26 e^{-4} +10 e^{-2}.

Putting A, B, C together:

I1 = K [ (9 (e^{-2} - e^{-4}) ) + (30 e^{-4} -18 e^{-2}) ) + ( -26 e^{-4} +10 e^{-2} ) ) ]

Let me compute term by term:

Term from A: 9 e^{-2} -9 e^{-4}

Term from B: 30 e^{-4} -18 e^{-2}

Term from C: -26 e^{-4} +10 e^{-2}

Adding all terms:

e^{-2} terms: 9 e^{-2} -18 e^{-2} +10 e^{-2} = (9-18+10) e^{-2} = 1 e^{-2}

e^{-4} terms: (-9 e^{-4}) +30 e^{-4} -26 e^{-4} = (-9 +30 -26) e^{-4} = (-5) e^{-4}

So I1 = K [ 1 e^{-2} -5 e^{-4} ]

Now, e^{-2} is about 0.1353, e^{-4} is about 0.0183.

So I1 ≈ K [ 0.1353 -5*(0.0183) ] = K [ 0.1353 -0.0915 ] = K * 0.0438.

But let's keep it symbolic for now.

Now, moving to the second integral for the interval [-2,0], which after substitution became:

I2 = K ∫_{0}^{2} (1 - z)^2 e^{-z} dz.

Expanding (1-z)^2 → 1 -2z + z².

So,

I2 = K ∫ (1 e^{-z} -2z e^{-z} + z² e^{-z} ) dz from 0→2.

Compute each integral:

D = ∫ e^{-z} dz → -e^{-z}

E = ∫ z e^{-z} dz → [-z e^{-z} - e^{-z} ]

F = ∫ z² e^{-z} dz → we did this earlier: -z² e^{-z} - 2z e^{-z} -2 e^{-z}.

So I2 = K [ D -2 E + F ]

Evaluated from 0 to2.

Compute each at z=2 and z=0.

At z=2:

D = -e^{-2}

E = [-2 e^{-2} - e^{-2}] → -3 e^{-2}

F = [ -4 e^{-2} -4 e^{-2}
