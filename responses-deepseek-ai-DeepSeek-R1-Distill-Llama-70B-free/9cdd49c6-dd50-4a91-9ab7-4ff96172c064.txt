Okay, so I have this rocket problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The rocket's initial mass is 100,000 lb. Out of this, 5% is structure, so the rest must be fuel and payload. So first, I need to figure out how much is structure, fuel, and payload.

Wait, structure is 5% of 100,000 lb. So 5% of 100,000 is 5,000 lb. So structure is 5,000 lb. That leaves 95,000 lb for fuel and payload combined. So fuel plus payload is 95,000 lb.

But I don't know how much is fuel and how much is payload yet. So I guess the payload is what I'm trying to find, right?

The specific impulse (Isp) is given as 300 lb_f-sec per lb_m. Oh wait, specific impulse is usually a measure of how efficiently the rocket uses propellant. The higher the Isp, the more efficient.

The problem also mentions a single-stage and a two-stage rocket. I need to calculate the payload for both. And the escape velocity is given as 36,800 ft/s. Wait, escape velocity from Earth is around 11.2 km/s, which is about 36,700 ft/s, so that matches up.

I remember that the rocket equation is delta_v = Isp * g0 * ln(m_initial / m_final), where m_initial is the initial mass (including fuel) and m_final is the mass after the fuel is burned. But wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think. Oh yeah, the equation is delta_v = Isp * g0 * ln((m_initial) / (m_final)). Because m_initial is the total mass, and m_final is the mass after burning all the fuel, so m_initial is bigger, which makes sense because the log would be positive.

But wait, in this problem, they neglect some terms like aerodynamic drag and gravity, so I don't have to worry about those. Also, the thrust equation is simplified because they neglect the term with p_e - p_a. So I can just focus on the rocket equation for delta_v.

So the escape velocity is the delta_v needed, which is 36,800 ft/s. So that's the delta_v we need to achieve.

Let me first tackle the single-stage rocket.

In a single-stage rocket, all the fuel is burned in one go. So the initial mass is 100,000 lb, which includes structure, fuel, and payload. The structure is 5,000 lb, so the fuel and payload together are 95,000 lb.

Wait, but for the rocket equation, m_initial is the total mass, and m_final would be the mass after the fuel is burned. So m_final is the structure plus the payload, because all the fuel is gone. So m_final = structure + payload.

So for the single-stage case, m_initial = 100,000 lb, m_final = 5,000 lb (structure) + payload.

But wait, the payload is part of the 95,000 lb. Hmm, maybe I should set up variables. Let me let payload be P. Then fuel would be 95,000 - P.

But for the rocket equation, the initial mass is 100,000 lb, and the final mass would be 5,000 lb (structure) + P (payload).

So m_initial = 100,000 lb.

m_final = 5,000 + P.

Now, applying the rocket equation:

delta_v = Isp * g0 * ln(m_initial / m_final).

Wait, but what are the units here? Isp is given in lb_f-sec per lb_m. I think g0 is the standard gravity, which in English units would be 32.174 lb_f/lb_m-s², but I might be mixing units. Alternatively, in English units, specific impulse is often given in seconds, but here it's given as lb_f-sec per lb_m, which is the same as seconds. Because Isp (in seconds) = (lb_f-sec/lb_m) * (lb_m / lb_f) * g0. Wait, maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, no, Isp in lb_f-sec/lb_m is the same as effective exhaust velocity in ft/s. Because, the formula is Isp * g0 = Ve, where Ve is effective exhaust velocity in ft/s. Let me confirm that.

Isp (in seconds) = Ve / g0. So Ve = Isp * g0.

So for Isp given as 300 lb_f-sec/lb_m, that's 300 seconds. Because in English units, Isp in seconds is calculated as (lb_f-sec/lb_m) * (lb_m / lb_f) ) * g0. Wait no, actually, I think I'm getting confused between unit systems.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The specific impulse in seconds is calculated by Isp = F * t_burn / m_propellant. But in terms of units, in metric, Isp in seconds is (N*s/kg) where N is force. In English units, lb_f is force, lb_m is mass. So Isp in seconds would be (lb_f * s) / lb_m. So yes, the given Isp is 300 s.

So for the rocket equation, delta_v = Isp * g0 * ln(m_ratio), where m_ratio is m_initial/m_final.

Wait, but wait, g0 is in ft/s². Because in English units, delta_v is in ft/s, Isp is in s, so the equation would actually be:

delta_v = (Isp * g0) * ln(m_initial/m_final)

But wait, no, I think the correct form is delta_v = Isp * g0 * ln(m_initial/m_final). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, sometimes the equation is written as delta_v = Ve * ln(m_initial/m_final), where Ve is the effective exhaust velocity in ft/s. And Ve = Isp * g0.

So if Isp is 300 s, and g0 is 32.174 ft/s², then Ve = 300 * 32.174 ≈ 9,652 ft/s.

Wait, that's a high exhaust velocity. Let me check: yes, Isp of 300 s gives Ve ≈ 300 * 32.174 ≈ 9,652 ft/s.

So the delta_v needed is 36,800 ft/s.

So for a single stage:

delta_v = Ve * ln(m_initial/m_final)

36,800 = 9,652 * ln(100,000 / (5,000 + P))

Wait, no. Because m_final is 5,000 + P, so m_initial is 100,000, so m_initial/m_final is 100,000/(5,000 + P).

So, 36,800 = 9,652 * ln(100,000/(5,000 + P)).

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me solve for the natural log term.

ln(100,000/(5,000 + P)) = 36,800 / 9,652 ≈ 3.816.

So, 100,000/(5,000 + P) = e^3.816.

What's e^3.816? Let me calculate. e^3 is about 20.085, e^4 is about 54.598. 3.816 is 0.816 above 3. So e^3.816 ≈ e^3 * e^0.816 ≈ 20.085 * 2.262 ≈ 45.45.

So 100,000/(5,000 + P) ≈ 45.45.

So, 5,000 + P = 100,000 / 45.45 ≈ 2,200 lb.

So P = 2,200 - 5,000 = negative, which can't be right. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the rocket equation wrong. Let me double-check. The rocket equation is delta_v = Isp * g0 * ln(m_initial/m_final). Wait, because Isp is in seconds, and g0 is in ft/s². So Isp * g0 would be in ft/s. So that makes delta_v in ft/s.

Wait, so for Isp of 300 s, and g0 of 32.174 ft/s², delta_v = 300 * 32.174 * ln(m_initial/m_final)

So 300 * 32.174 is approximately 9,652 ft/s, same as before.

So delta_v = 9,652 * ln(100,000/(5,000 + P)).

But we need delta_v to be 36,800 ft/s.

So 36,800 = 9,652 * ln(100,000/(5,000 + P))

Divide both sides by 9,652:

36,800 / 9,652 ≈ 3.816.

So ln(100,000/(5,000 + P)) ≈ 3.816.

Exponentiating both sides:

100,000/(5,000 + P) = e^3.816 ≈ 45.45.

So 5,000 + P = 100,000 / 45.45 ≈ 2,200 lb.

Wait, that can't be right because 5,000 + P is 2,200, which would mean P is negative, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up m_initial and m_final. Let me think again.

The rocket equation is delta_v = Ve * ln(m_initial/m_final).

But m_initial is the total mass, including fuel and structure and payload. m_final is the mass after burning all fuel, which is structure plus payload.

Wait, but in the single-stage case, the fuel is 95,000 lb minus the payload. No, wait, structure is 5,000 lb, so fuel plus payload is 95,000. So if payload is P, then fuel is 95,000 - P.

So m_initial = 100,000 lb.

m_final = structure (5,000) + payload (P) = 5,000 + P.

So m_initial/m_final = 100,000 / (5,000 + P).

But plugging that into the rocket equation gives me a negative payload, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe the specific impulse is given differently. Oh wait, the specific impulse is given as 300 lb_f/lb_m/sec, which is 300 seconds. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the delta_v is the escape velocity, but for a single-stage rocket, it's not possible to achieve that because the required mass ratio would be too high.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate it, so maybe I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the mass ratio.

Wait, let me try solving for m_initial/m_final.

Let me denote m_initial as M, and m_final as m.

So:

delta_v = Ve * ln(M/m)

We can rearrange to find M/m = e^(delta_v / Ve).

So M/m = e^(36800 / 9652) ≈ e^3.816 ≈ 45.45.

So M/m = 45.45 → m = M / 45.45.

Since M is 100,000 lb, m = 100,000 / 45.45 ≈ 2,200 lb.

But m is the final mass, which is structure (5,000 lb) plus payload. So 5,000 + P = 2,200? That can't be. So P would be negative, which is impossible. So that suggests that a single-stage rocket can't achieve escape velocity with these parameters.

But that's not possible because the options include a single-stage answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the structure mass.

Wait, the structure is 5% of the initial mass, so structure is 5,000 lb. So the rocket equation gives m_final as 5,000 + payload.

But if m_final is 2,200, that would mean the structure is 5,000, which is impossible because m_final can't be less than the structure mass. So perhaps the single-stage rocket can't reach escape velocity, but the problem says to calculate it. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the specific impulse is given in a different unit. Let me check the units again. Specific impulse is given as 300 lb_f/lb_m/sec, which is 300 seconds. So that should be correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rocket equation applies to the propellant only, so the structure isn't part of the mass that's being expelled. So maybe the structure is considered part of the dry mass.

Wait, in the rocket equation, m_initial is the total mass (structure + propellant + payload), and m_final is the dry mass (structure + payload). So that's correct.

Wait, so if m_final is 5,000 + P, and m_initial is 100,000, then for the mass ratio:

m_initial/m_final = 100,000/(5,000 + P) = 45.45 → 5,000 + P = 100,000/45.45 ≈ 2,200 lb. But 5,000 + P is 2,200 lb → P = -2,800 lb. That's impossible. So perhaps a single-stage rocket isn't possible, but the problem asks for it. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific impulse is given in a different way. Let me double-check the rocket equation.

Another approach: The mass ratio (MR) is MR = m_initial/m_final = e^(delta_v / Ve).

So delta_v is 36,800 ft/s, Ve is 9,652 ft/s.

So MR = e^(36800 / 9652) ≈ e^3.816 ≈ 45.45.

So m_initial/m_final = 45.45 → m_final = m_initial / 45.45.

m_initial is 100,000 lb, so m_final = 100,000 / 45.45 ≈ 2,200 lb.

But m_final is structure (5,000) + payload → 5,000 + P ≈ 2,200 → P ≈ -2,800 lb. That's not possible, so perhaps the single-stage rocket can't achieve escape velocity. But the options include single-stage answers, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again. Maybe the initial mass is 100,000 lb, of which 5% is structure, so 5,000 lb. The rest, 95,000 lb, is fuel and payload. So payload plus fuel is 95,000 lb.

But for the rocket equation, the initial mass is 100,000 lb, and the final mass is structure plus payload, which is 5,000 + P. So the equation is:

delta_v = Ve * ln(100,000 / (5,000 + P)).

We set delta_v to 36,800 ft/s.

So 36,800 = 9,652 * ln(100,000 / (5,000 + P)).

Divide both sides by 9,652:

36,800 / 9,652 ≈ 3.816.

So ln(100,000 / (5,000 + P)) ≈ 3.816 → 100,000/(5,000 + P) = e^3.816 ≈ 45.45.

So 5,000 + P = 100,000 / 45.45 ≈ 2,200 lb.

But 5,000 + P = 2,200 → P = 2,200 - 5,000 = -2,800 lb. That's impossible, so perhaps a single-stage rocket isn't possible. But the problem asks for it, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the structure is 5% of the dry mass, not the initial mass. Wait, the question says, "5 percent is to be structure, the remainder fuel and payload." So 5% of the initial mass is structure, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Ve. Let me recalculate that.

Isp is 300 lb_f-sec/lb_m, which is 300 seconds. So Ve = Isp * g0. Wait, but in English units, g0 is 32.174 ft/s², so Ve = 300 * 32.174 ≈ 9,652 ft/s. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the equation should be delta_v = Ve * ln(m_initial/(m_initial - fuel_burned)), but that's the same as m_initial/(m_final).

Wait, maybe I should consider that the fuel is 95,000 lb minus the payload. So fuel is 95,000 - P.

Then, m_initial is 100,000 lb, m_final is 5,000 + P.

So the mass ratio is 100,000 / (5,000 + P) = e^(delta_v / Ve).

But that leads to the same problem as before. So perhaps a single-stage rocket isn't feasible, but the problem says to calculate it. Maybe the payload is zero? That would make m_final = 5,000 lb, so m_initial/m_final = 20. So ln(20) ≈ 3. So delta_v = 9,652 * 3 ≈ 28,956 ft/s, which is less than the escape velocity of 36,800 ft/s. So to reach 36,800, the mass ratio needs to be higher, but that would require m_final to be less than 5,000 lb, which is impossible because structure is 5,000 lb. So perhaps the single-stage can't do it, but the problem wants an answer, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the structure is 5% of the dry mass. No, the question says 5% of the initial mass. So that's 5,000 lb structure.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the rocket equation. Let me think again. The rocket equation is delta_v = Ve * ln(m_initial/m_final).

So for the single-stage, m_initial is 100,000 lb, m_final is 5,000 + P.

So:

36,800 = 9,652 * ln(100,000/(5,000 + P)).

As before, this leads to P being negative, which is impossible. So maybe the single-stage can't achieve escape velocity. But the problem includes an option for single-stage, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the specific impulse is given in lb_f per lb_m per second, which is the same as seconds. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem assumes that the structure is 5% of the dry mass, not the initial mass. Let me try that.

If structure is
