Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the standard deviation of a sample of measurements: 1, 3, 7, 10, 14. Hmm, I remember that standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers are in a dataset. But wait, is this a population or a sample? The question says it's a sample, so I'll need to use the sample standard deviation formula.

Right, the formula for sample standard deviation involves calculating the mean first. So step one is to find the average of these numbers. Let me add them up: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 7 is 11, plus 10 is 21, plus 14 is 35. Oh wait, so the sum is 35. Since there are 5 numbers, the mean is 35 divided by 5, which is 7. That makes sense.

Next, I think I need to find the squared differences between each number and the mean. So for each number, subtract the mean and then square the result. Let's do that step by step.

First number is 1. 1 minus 7 is -6. Squared, that's 36. Second number is 3. 3-7 is -4, squared is 16. Third number is 7. 7-7 is 0, so 0 squared is 0. Fourth is 10. 10-7 is 3, squared is 9. Last one is 14. 14-7 is 7, squared is 49.

Now I add up all these squared differences: 36 + 16 is 52, plus 0 is still 52, plus 9 is 61, plus 49 is 110. So the total sum of squared differences is 110.

But wait, since this is a sample, I should divide by (n-1) instead of n for the variance. n here is 5, so n-1 is 4. So the variance is 110 divided by 4, which is 27.5.

Now, standard deviation is the square root of the variance. So I take the square root of 27.5. Let me calculate that. Hmm, I know that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36. So it's somewhere between 5 and 6. Let me think. 5.24 squared is 27.4576, because 5^2 is 25, 0.24^2 is about 0.0576, and 2*5*0.24 is 2.4. So 25 + 2.4 + 0.0576 is 27.4576, which is very close to 27.5. So the square root of 27.5 is approximately 5.24. Wait, looking at the options, E is 4.24, and I is 5.07. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the sum of squares. Let me check the squared differences again.

1: (1-7)^2 = 36, correct.
3: (3-7)^2 = 16, right.
7: 0.
10: (10-7)^2 = 9, yes.
14: (14-7)^2 = 49, yes.

Sum: 36 +16=52, +0=52, +9=61, +49=110. So that's correct. So variance is 110/4=27.5. Square root of 27.5 is about 5.24. But looking at the options, I don't see 5.24. Wait the options are A:5.92, B:2.87, C:7.1, D:3.5, E:4.24, F:4.69, G:6.32, H:5.5, I:5.07, J:6.5.

Hmm, none of these match 5.24 exactly. Oh wait, perhaps I missed a step. Did I use the correct formula? Wait, sometimes people confuse sample and population standard deviation. Oh wait, sample uses n-1, which I did. So the variance is 27.5, standard deviation is sqrt(27.5) ≈5.24. But the closest option is A:5.92, which is higher, and I:5.07, which is lower. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of squares.

Wait another thought: Did I do the sum correctly? Let me recheck each term:

1: (1-7)² = (-6)²=36
3: (-4)²=16
7: 0
10: 3²=9
14:7²=49

Adding them: 36 +16=52, plus 0=52, plus 9=61, plus 49=110. That's correct.

So variance is 110/4=27.5. So standard deviation is sqrt(27.5) ≈5.244. So looking at the options, the closest is I:5.07, but that's lower. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation of the mean perhaps?

Wait, the mean calculation: 1+3+7+10+14=35, divided by 5 is 7. That's correct. So back to the standard deviation. Hmm. Wait perhaps I did the square root wrong. Let me compute sqrt(27.5) more accurately.

I know that 5.5 squared is 30.25. Because 5.5*5.5 is 30.25. 5.24 squared is 27.4576 as I thought before. So 5.24 is about 5.24. So the exact value is approximately 5.24. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is I:5.07, which is 5.07, so a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a rounded figure.

Wait, let me compute 27.5 exactly. Let me see, 5.24^2 is 27.4576, 5.24^2 is 27.4576, 5.25^2 is 27.5625. So 27.5 is between 5.24 and 5.25. If I round to two decimal places, it's 5.24. But none of the options show 5.24 or 5.25.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Oh wait, wait a second. Maybe the question is asking for the population standard deviation, not the sample. Oh, but the question says 'sample of measurements', so sample standard deviation would be correct, using n-1. But if the question had mistakenly used n, let's see what happens.

If variance was 110/5=22, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.69. Oh, look, option F is 4.69. Hmm, which would be if I used n instead of n-1. But since the question says it's a sample, I think I should use n-1. Hmm, but perhaps the question intended to ask for population standard deviation, or maybe it's a trick question.

Wait, but I'm pretty sure when it's a sample, we use n-1. So the correct standard deviation should be approximately 5.24, which isn't among the options. Hmm, but let me look again at the options. Oh wait, option I is 5.07, which is lower than 5.24. Option A is 5.92, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recalculate the sum of squared differences.

1: (1-7) = -6 → 36
3: (3-7) = -4 → 16 → sum so far 52
7: 0 → sum 52
10: 3 → 9 → sum 61
14:7 →49 → sum 110. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check what the correct answer is, but the options don't include 5.24. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of the numbers. Wait, 1 +3 is 4, +7 is 11, +10 is 21, +14 is 35. So yes, mean is 7.

Wait, maybe I should try another approach. Maybe I should list each step again more carefully.

Numbers: 1, 3,7,10,14.

Mean: 35/5=7.

Deviations:

1-7 = -6 → squared 36

3-7=-4 → squared 16

7-7=0 → 0

10-7=3 →9

14-7=7 →49.

Sum of squares: 36+16=52 +0=52 +9=61 +49=110.

Variance sample: 110/(5-1)=27.5.

SD: sqrt(27.5)=5.244.

Looking at the options, the closest is I:5.07 and H:5.5. Hmm, 5.24 is between 5.07 and 5.5. But none of the options match exactly. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the population standard deviation. Let's see what that would be. Population variance is 110/5=22. So SD is sqrt(22)=4.690.

Looking at the options, F is 4.69. So if the question had mistakenly used population instead of sample, the answer would be F. But the question says it's a sample.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to round to two decimal places, 5.24 would be 5.24, but that's not an option. The options given are A:5.92, which is higher, and I:5.07, which is lower.

Wait maybe I made a calculation error in the sum of squares. Let me re-add them:

36 (from 1) +16 (3) =52.

Plus 0 (7) →52.

Plus 9 (10) →61.

Plus 49 (14) →110. Correct.

So I think I didn't make a mistake there. So the correct standard deviation should be approximately 5.24, which isn't present. But the options don't have that. Hmm. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I did a wrong approach. Let me see how the options are calculated. Maybe the person who made the question used the population formula by mistake. So if I compute that, the variance is 22, standard deviation is sqrt(22)=approximately 4.69, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the mean. Let me recalculate the mean. 1+3=4, +7=11, +10=21, +14=35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the standard deviation without considering it's a sample, so using n=5. That would give 4.69, which is option F.

But the question says 'sample', so the correct approach would be to use n-1. Hmm. Maybe the question intended to ask for population, but stated sample. That's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm meant to compute the sample standard deviation but made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator to compute sqrt(27.5) more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step. 27.5 is 27.5.

I know that 5.24^2 is 27.4576, as before.

The exact value of sqrt(27.5) is about 5.24404.

Looking at the options again: I is 5.07, which is 5.07. Hmm, that's lower than 5.24. H is 5.5, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be rounded to one decimal place. 5.244 would be approximately 5.2, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the standard deviation is being calculated with some other method, but I can't think of another way.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of the squared differences is wrong. Let me re-calculate each term.

1: (1-7)= -6 →36.

3: (3-7)= -4 →16.

7:0→0.

10:3→9.

14:7→49.

Sum:36+16=52, +0=52, +9=61, +49=110.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Since the correct answer isn't among the options, but if I had to choose the closest one, it's not present. So perhaps the intended answer is F:4.69, assuming population standard deviation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, sample standard deviation is calculated as the square root of [sum of squared differences/(n-1)]. So that's what I did, giving 5.24.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:4.24, but that's even lower than 4.69. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, maybe the question had different numbers, but I think not.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the intended answer is 5.24, but it's not an option, so perhaps the correct answer is I:5.07, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of squares.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the numbers are 1,3,7,10,14, but perhaps I added them wrong. Let me sum them again:1+3=4, +7=11, +10=21, +14=35. Correct. So mean is 7.

Wait, maybe I should try to compute the standard deviation manually with more precise steps. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the standard deviation to be 5.24, but since it's not present, perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the standard deviation. Let me do that.

Variance is 27.5.

So sqrt(27.5). Let's compute that.

I'll write out 27.5 as 275/10.

So sqrt(275/10) = sqrt(55/2).

Hmm, sqrt(55) is about 7.416, and sqrt(2) is 1.4142. So sqrt(55/2) is sqrt(27.5) ≈5.244.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using long division method for square roots. Let's see.

Find sqrt(27.5).

I know that 5^2=25, 6^2=36.

So it's between 5 and 6.

Let me see how many times 5 fits into 27.5.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute 5.24^2:

5.24 *5.24:

Calculate 5 *5 =25.

5 *0.24=1.2, times 2 (for both terms) =2.4.

0.24 *0.24=0.0576.

So 25 +2.4 +0.0576 =27.4576.

Which is just under 27.5.

So 5.24^2=27.4576.

5.24^2=27.4576.

5.25^2= (5 +0.25)^2=5^2 + 2*5*0.25 +0.25^2=25 +2.5 +0.0625=27.5625.

So 27.5 is between 5.24 and 5.25. So sqrt(27.5)=approx 5.24.

But the options don't have that. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is F:4.69, which is when using n instead of n-1, but that would be incorrect for a sample. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for population standard deviation.

Given that the options don't include 5.24, but include 4.69, which is sqrt(22), perhaps the intended answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was meant to be a different set of numbers. But I think I have to go with what's given.

So, to sum up, the correct sample standard deviation is approximately 5.24, but among the given options, the closest is not present. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is F:4.69, assuming the use of n instead of n-1.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake, but I can't see where. So I'll go with the calculation I did and see which option matches.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the numbers are 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, but perhaps I added them wrong. Wait, 1+3 is 4, plus7 is 11, plus10 is 21, plus14 is 35. That's correct, so mean is 7.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the standard deviation of the population, not the sample, so I should use n, giving 4.69, which is option F.

But the question says 'sample of measurements', so it's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo. But I have to choose from the given options, so perhaps the intended answer is F:4.69.

To find the standard deviation of the sample of measurements \(1, 3, 7, 10, 14\), the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the mean**:  
   The sum of the measurements is \(1 + 3 + 7 + 10 + 14 = 35\).  
   Since there are \(n = 5\) measurements, the mean is:  
   \[
   \bar{x} = \frac{35}{5} = 7
   \]

2. **Compute the squared differences**:  
   For each measurement, subtract the mean and square the result:  
   - \((1 - 7)^2 = (-6)^2 = 36\)  
   - \((3 - 7)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16\)  
   - \((7 - 7)^2 = 0^2 = 0\)  
   - \((10 - 7)^2 = 3^2 = 9\)  
   - \((14 - 7)^2 = 7^2 = 49\)  

   The sum of squared differences is:  
   \[
   36 + 16 + 0 + 9 + 49 = 110
   \]

3. **Calculate the variance**:  
   Since this is a sample, the variance is given by:  
   \[
   s^2 = \frac{\text{sum of squared differences}}{n-1} = \frac{110}{5-1} = \frac{110}{4} = 27.5
   \
