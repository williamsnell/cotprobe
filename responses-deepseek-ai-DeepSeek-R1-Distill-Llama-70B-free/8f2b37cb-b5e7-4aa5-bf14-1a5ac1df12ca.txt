Okay, so I've got this problem about the Fibonacci sequence and finding the remainder when the 100th term is divided by 4. Hmm, I remember the Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two. So like 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.

The question is asking for the 100th term modulo 4. That sounds a bit intimidating because the 100th Fibonacci number must be huge. Calculating it directly would be impossible without some smart approach.

Wait, I think I remember something called the Pisano period. Oh right, Pisano period is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo n repeats. So for modulo 4, there's a repeating cycle. If I can find the length of that cycle, I can find where the 100th term falls within it and then get the remainder.

So first, I need to find the Pisano period for modulo 4. Let me try to list the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 until I see a repetition in the starting pair (1,1).

Let's start:

Term 1: 1 mod4 =1

Term 2:1 mod4=1

Term3: (1+1)=2 mod4=2

Term4: (1+2)=3 mod4=3

Term5: (2+3)=5 mod4=1

Term6: (3+5)=8 mod4=0

Term7: (5+8)=13 mod4=1 (because 13 divided by 4 is 3*4=12, 13-12=1)

Term8: (8+13)=21 mod4=1 (21-5*4=1)

Term9: (13+21)=34 mod4= 34/4 is 8*4=32, so 34-32=2.

Term10: (21+34)=55 mod4. 55 divided by 4 is 13*4=52, 55-52=3.

Term11: (34+55)=89 mod4. 89/4=22*4=88, so 89-88=1.

Term12: (55+89)=144 mod4=0 because 144 is divisible by 4.

Term13: (89+144)=233 mod4. Let's see, 4*58=232, so 233-232=1.

Term14: (144+233)=377 mod4. 377/4 is 94*4=376, so 377 mod4=1.

Term15: (233+377)=610 mod4. 610 divided by 4 is 152*4=608, so remainder 2.

Wait a second, let's list these out step by step:

n: F(n) mod4

1:1

2:1

3:2

4:3

5:1

6:0

7:1

8:1

9:2

10:3

11:1

12:0

13:1

14:1

Wait, looking at the sequence so far: 1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,...

I notice that after term 6 (which is 0), term7 is 1, term8 is 1, which is the same as the starting pair. So the sequence from term7 onward is 1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,... which is the same as the start. So the Pisano period for modulo 4 is 6. Because the sequence repeats every 6 terms after the first occurrence.

Wait, let me double-check. The initial terms:

1,1,2,3,1,0, then 1,1,2,3,1,0,...

So the period is 6. Because the pair (1,1) repeats after 6 terms. So the Pisano period for modulo 4 is 6. That means the Fibonacci sequence mod4 cycles every 6 terms.

So to find the 100th term mod4, I can find 100 mod6, because the cycle repeats every 6 terms.

Wait, 100 divided by 6 is 16*6=96, remainder 4. So 100 mod6 is 4. So the 100th term mod4 is the same as the 4th term mod4.

Looking back at the earlier list:

Term1:1

Term2:1

Term3:2

Term4:3

So the 4th term mod4 is 3. Therefore, the 100th term mod4 is 3.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Because sometimes the Pisano period starts from term1, so positions 1 to 6 form a cycle, then 7-12, etc. So the 100th term would correspond to position (100 mod6).

Wait, 6*16=96, 100-96=4, so the 4th position in the cycle. Which is 3.

Hmm, so the remainder is 3, which is option I.

But wait, looking back at the options: the options are A-J, with H being 2, I being 3. So the correct answer would be I.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two. To find the remainder when the 100th term is divided by 4, we can use the concept of the Pisano period, which is the period with which the Fibonacci sequence modulo \( n \) repeats.

For \( n = 4 \), the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 is as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
F_1 & = 1 \mod 4 = 1, \\
F_2 & = 1 \mod 4 = 1, \\
F_3 & = 2 \mod 4 = 2, \\
F_4 & = 3 \mod 4 = 3, \\
F_5 & = 5 \mod 4 = 1, \\
F_6 & = 8 \mod 4 = 0, \\
F_7 & = 13 \mod 4 = 1, \\
F_8 & = 21 \mod 4 = 1, \\
F_9 & = 34 \mod 4 = 2, \\
F_{10} & = 55 \mod 4 = 3, \\
F_{11} & = 89 \mod 4 = 1, \\
F_{12} & = 144 \mod 4 = 0, \\
\end{align*}
\]

From \( F_7 \) onward, the sequence repeats the pattern \( 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0 \). Thus, the Pisano period for \( n = 4 \) is 6.

To find the remainder of the 100th term modulo 4, we calculate \( 100 \mod 6 \), which gives \( 100 = 6 \times 16 + 4 \). Therefore, the 100th term corresponds to the 4th term in the Pisano period.

From the sequence above, \( F_4 \mod 4 = 3 \). Hence, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is **3**.

The correct answer is **I**.
