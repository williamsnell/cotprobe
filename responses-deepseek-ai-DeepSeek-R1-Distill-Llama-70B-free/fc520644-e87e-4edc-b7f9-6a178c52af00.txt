Question:

A theater collected $6 for each ticket sold to a movie. The theater sold 500 tickets to the movie. The expression below can be used to find how much money the theater collected for the tickets. 6 × 500 Which expression can also be used to find how much money the theater collected for the tickets?

Options:

A: (6 × 5) × 10^1
B: 30 × 10^1
C: (6 × 5) × 10^2
D: 600 × 50
E: (6 × 5) × 10^3
F: (6 × 500) × 10^1
G: 30 × 10^3
H: 60 × 10^2

Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a theater collecting money from ticket sales. Let me try to break it down step by step. The theater charges $6 per ticket and they sold 500 tickets. The expression given is 6 multiplied by 500, which makes sense because each ticket brings in $6, and they sold 500 of them. So the total money collected should be 6 times 500.

Now, the question is asking which other expression can be used to find the same amount of money. Let's look at the options provided. 

Option A: (6 × 5) × 10^1. Hmm, 6 times 5 is 30, and 10^1 is 10. So 30 times 10 is 300. But 6 times 500 is 3000, right? So 300 is way less. So A can't be right.

Option B: 30 × 10^1. That's 30 times 10 again, which is 300. Same issue as A. Not matching 3000.

Option C: (6 ×5) ×10^2. 6×5 is 30, and 10^2 is 100. 30×100 is 3000. Oh, that's the same as 6×500. So that's a possibility. Let me keep this in mind.

Option D: 600 ×50. Let's calculate that. 600 times 50... 600 times 5 is 3000, so 600×50 is 30,000. That's way higher than 3000. So D is out.

Option E: (6×5)×10^3. 6×5 is 30, 10^3 is 1000. 30×1000 is 30,000. Again, way too high. So E's not correct.

Option F: (6 ×500) ×10^1. That's just the original expression times 10, which would make it 6000. Not 3000, so F is wrong.

Option G: 30 ×10^3. 30 times 1000 is 30,000. Again, way too high.

Option H: 60 ×10^2. 60 times 100 is 6000. Still not 3000. So H isn't right either.

Wait, so looking back, Option C gives 30×100=3000, which matches the original 6×500. So C is correct. But wait, let me double-check. 6×500 is 3000. 6×5 is 30, and 10^2 is 100. 30×100 is 3000. Yep, that's correct.

I think that's the only one that works. So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The correct answer is the option that provides an expression equivalent to \(6 \times 500 = 3000\). 

- Option C: \((6 \times 5) \times 10^2 = 30 \times 100 = 3000\), which matches the original calculation. 

Thus, the correct choice is:

C
