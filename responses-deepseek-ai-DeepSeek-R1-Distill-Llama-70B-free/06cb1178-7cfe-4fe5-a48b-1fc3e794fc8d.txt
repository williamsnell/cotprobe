Question:

A well-established paper mill and a logging company signed a written contract in which the mill agreed to buy from the company all the logs the mill would need for one year. The company was unable to keep up with the mill's needs, and its log deliveries fell short by 10% to 15% in each of the four quarters of the year. The mill paid the company on time for all delivered logs. The mill paid an attorney $2,000 for advice concerning its options in enforcing the contract. It paid a broker a reasonable fee of $5,000 to find additional logs to make up for the company's shortfall. The mill also incurred reasonable costs of $25,000 to transport the additional logs to its facility. Despite the mill's efforts to mitigate damages, it sustained $200,000 in losses because of the company's failure to timely deliver enough logs. The mill has sued the company for breach of contract. If the court finds for the mill, how much should it award in damages?

Options:

A: $205,000.00
B: $220,000.00
C: $225,000.00
D: $240,000.00
E: $200,000.00
F: $230,000.00
G: $232,000.00
H: $250,000.00
I: $235,000.00
J: $210,000.00

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding damages for breach of contract. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

So, the scenario is a paper mill and a logging company have a written contract. The mill agrees to buy all the logs it needs for a year from the logging company. But the logging company didn't meet the mill's needsâ€”they were short by 10-15% each quarter. The mill paid for all the logs that were delivered on time, but they had to find other logs to make up the shortfall. 

Now, the mill is suing for breach of contract, and the question is about how much the court should award in damages if the court rules in favor of the mill.

Alright, so the mill incurred some costs because of the logging company's failure. Let me list out what I remember from contract law about damages. The main principle is that the non-breaching party should be put in the position they would have been in if the contract had been performed. So, the goal is to compensate for losses, not to punish the breaching party.

In this case, the mill had to mitigate the damages. So, any reasonable costs they incurred to mitigate should be recoverable. Let's look at the costs mentioned:

1. Attorney fee: $2,000. Wait, are attorney's fees recoverable in contract cases? I think generally, each party bears their own attorney fees unless the contract says otherwise. Here, the question doesn't mention the contract including such a term, so probably the $2,000 isn't recoverable.

2. Broker fee: $5,000. This was a reasonable fee to find additional logs. That sounds like a cost of mitigation, so this should be recoverable.

3. Transportation costs: $25,000. Again, this is a direct result of having to get logs from another source, so it's a mitigating cost. Should be recoverable.

Then, despite their efforts, the mill still lost $200,000. So that's their actual loss after mitigation.

So, adding up the recoverable amounts: $5,000 + $25,000 = $30,000, plus the $200,000 loss, totaling $230,000.

Wait, but what about the attorney fee? Since the $2,000 isn't recoverable, it doesn't get added. So the total would be $230k.

Looking at the options, option F is $230,000. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another thing to consider is whether the $200k loss is the profit they would have made if the contract had been fulfilled. Or is it a direct loss? The question says "sustained $200,000 in losses because of the company's failure." So that's likely the loss in profit or expected benefit.

So adding the mitigation costs (broker and transport) to the loss, yes, $230k makes sense.

The court should award damages that place the mill in the position it would have been in had the contract been fulfilled. The mill incurred reasonable mitigation costs, including a $5,000 broker fee and $25,000 in transportation costs, totaling $30,000. Additionally, the mill sustained a $200,000 loss due to the breach. The attorney fee of $2,000 is not recoverable as it is not typically recoverable in contract cases unless specified by the contract. Therefore, the total damages amount to $230,000.

Answer: F
