Okay, I've got this question about identifying a sentence written in the subjunctive mood. Hmm, I remember that the subjunctive is used for hypothetical or wishful situations, often involving words like "wish," "if," or "were." Let me look through each option carefully.

Option A: "If only your man was here." Wait, "was" is past indicative, right? But sometimes in subjunctive, especially in wishes, it's "were." So maybe this isn't the correct form. I think the subjunctive would use "were" here, making it "If only your man were here." So A might not be correct.

Option B: "I wish I were your man." Oh, I remember that "wish" often triggers the subjunctive. The verb here is "were," which is the subjunctive form. This seems like a strong candidate because it's expressing a wish, so B looks correct.

Option C: "I would be your man." "Would" is a modal verb, but this is more about willingness or possibility, not necessarily the subjunctive mood. So C might not be it.

Options D and E: Both are questions about location. "Your man is where?" and "Your man, where is he?" These are just straightforward questions, so no subjunctive here.

Option F: "Your man might be here." "Might" is a modal indicating possibility, but again, it's not the subjunctive mood. It's more about possibility than a hypothetical situation.

Option G: "Your man could be here." Similar to F, "could" is about ability or possibility, not the subjunctive.

Option H: "I am not your man." This is a straightforward statement, so no subjunctive.

Option I: "Wherefore art your man?" "Wherefore" means why, so it's a question, but "art" is an archaic second person singular of "be." Not sure if this is subjunctive, but it's more about being old-fashioned rather than expressing a wish or hypothetical.

Option J: "Where is your man?" Again, a direct question, not subjunctive.

So, going back, the only sentence that uses the subjunctive is B because it uses "were" after "I wish," which is a classic subjunctive structure.

The sentence written in the subjunctive mood is:

B: I wish I were your man

This sentence uses the subjunctive form "were" after the verb "wish," which is a typical structure for expressing a wish or hypothetical situation.

Answer: B
