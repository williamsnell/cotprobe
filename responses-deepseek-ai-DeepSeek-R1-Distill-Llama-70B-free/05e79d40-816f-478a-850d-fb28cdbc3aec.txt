Question:

A father and a son were indicted and charged with bank robbery. They allegedly participated together in robbing a bank in their hometown. After the son was arrested and given Miranda warnings, he confessed and admitted that he and his father took part in the bank robbery. The prosecution decided to charge the father and son in the same indictment and prosecute them together in a single trial. At trial, the son took the stand and recanted his earlier confession by denying participation in the robbery. The prosecution now seeks to introduce into evidence the son's earlier confession that was videotaped by the police. The son and the father both object to its admissibility. The confession should be

Options:

A: admitted against the father only, because the son recanted his confession.
B: not admitted against the son, but admitted against the father as it implicates him in the crime.
C: admitted against both the son and the father, because the son implicated the father in the crime.
D: not admitted against the son or the father, because the son was under duress when he confessed.
E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession.
F: admitted against both the son and the father, because they were jointly charged.
G: not admitted against the son or the father, because the confession is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
H: not admitted against the son or the father, because the son recanted the confession.
I: admitted against both the son and the father, because they were engaged in a conspiracy.
J: admitted against the son only.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question about whether a confession can be admitted against the father and son in a joint trial. Let me go through it step by step.

The scenario is that a father and son were charged together with bank robbery. The son confessed after being arrested and given Miranda warnings, and he implicated both himself and his father. Now, at trial, the son is recanting that confession, saying he didn't participate. The prosecution wants to introduce the earlier videotaped confession, but both the son and father object.

Hmm, the key here is the rules of evidence regarding confessions and their admissibility, especially in joint trials. I remember that when two defendants are tried together, each defendant's confession can be used against them, but there are some caveats.

So, the son's confession would normally be admissible against him, right? Because it's his own statement. But wait, he's recanting it now. Does that affect admissibility? I think a recantation goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. So the jury can hear the confession and decide whether to believe it or the recantation.

But what about the father? The son's confession implicates the father. Since the father is a co-defendant, can the prosecution use the son's statement against him? I recall that under Bruton v. United States, when two defendants are tried together, one defendant's confession that implicates the other cannot be admitted against the other unless the confessing defendant testifies and is subject to cross-examination.

Wait, Bruton says that the co-defendant's confession is inadmissible against another defendant if it's being used as evidence of the other's guilt. Because the co-defendant's statement is hearsay and not subject to cross-examination, which violates the Confrontation Clause.

In this case, the son doesn't want his earlier confession used against him, which is understandable. But the father also objects. The issue is whether the confession can be used against the father.

Since the son is testifying and recanting, does that change anything? I think Bruton applies when the co-defendant's confession is used against another. So if the son's confession is being used against the father, it's inadmissible unless the son is available for cross. But here, the son is testifying, so maybe that makes a difference.

Wait, wait. If the son takes the stand and is subject to cross-examination, then his prior statement could be used against both. Because the father's attorney could cross-examine the son about the confession. So the Bruton problem is solved if the son testifies. Therefore, the confession might be admissible against both.

Looking at the options:

Option B says not admitted against the son but admitted against the father. But I thought the son's own confession is admissible against him regardless, unless there's some other issue like Miranda. The question doesn't say the confession was involuntary, only that the son recanted. So Miranda warnings were given, so it's probably admissible.

Option C says admitted against both because the son implicated the father. But without considering Bruton, that's not right. But since the son is testifying, Bruton may not block it.

Wait, no, Bruton's issue is about the hearsay statement of a co-defendant being used against another. So if the son's statement is being offered against the father, it's hearsay unless it's a statement against interest under FRE 804(b)(3). But if the son is a co-defendant and testifies, perhaps that changes it.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible against the father because the son is available to testify, so the father's rights are protected.

But I'm a bit confused. Another angle: FRE 801(d)(2) allows a statement to be used by a party opponent if it's offered against that party. But wait, the son's statement is being offered by the prosecution, not the defense. So maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, the son's statement is the prosecution's evidence. So against the son, it's his own confession, admissible. Against the father, it's hearsay unless an exception applies. The statement implicates both, but without the son's statement being admissible against the father, it can't be used.

But if the son is testifying and can be cross-examined, the Bruton issue is resolved because the father has the chance to confront the son about the statement. So maybe the statement can be admitted against both.

Looking at the options, option E says admitted against the son only. Option C says both, because implicated the father. Option B says not against son, but against father.

Wait, but the son's own statement is hearsay when used against him. Wait, no, under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it's the opposing party's statement. But the prosecution is offering the son's statement against the son, which is a party opponent. So it's admissible against the son as an admission by a party opponent.

As for the father, the son's statement is hearsay, but since the son is testifying, the father's attorney can cross-examine him, so it's admissible under Bruton's exception when the declarant testifies.

Wait, no, Bruton says that when a co-defendant's confession is admitted, and the co-defendant doesn't testify, it violates the Confrontation Clause. But if the co-defendant does testify, then the statement can be admitted because the other side can cross-examine.

So in this case, since the son is testifying, the father's attorney can cross him about the confession. Therefore, the son's confession can be admitted against both.

So the options: looking at option C: admitted against both because the son implicated the father. Option I says because they were in a conspiracy. But the question doesn't say they were part of a conspiracy, so I think I is not correct.

Wait, but the crime is bank robbery; not sure about conspiracy. But the main point is Bruton's applicability. Since the son is testifying, the confession can be used against both.

So the correct option would be C: admitted against both.

Wait, but let me think again. The son's statement is admissible against him because it's his own statement, but against the father, it's hearsay unless it's a statement against interest.

Wait, if the son's statement is against his own interest, then under FRE 804(b)(3), it could be admissible against the father if the son is unavailable. But the son is testifying, so he's available, so that exception wouldn't apply. So the statement can't be used against the father unless another exception applies.

Wait, but Bruton is about the Confrontation Clause. So when the son testifies, the father's attorney can cross him about the statement. Therefore, the statement can be used against the father as well, because the father's rights are protected by the ability to cross-examine.

So the conclusion is that the son's confession is admissible against both the son and the father.

Looking at the options, option C says admitted against both because the son implicated the father. That seems correct.

Wait, but option E says admitted against the son only. So why is that not the case?

Because the son's confession is being used against the father, which would normally be problematic under Bruton. But since the son is testifying, the father can cross him, so it's allowed.

So the answer should be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible against the son, but not the father, unless it's a statement against interest.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify.

The son's statement is being offered against the father. The statement is hearsay, so it's inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Possible exceptions: statement against interest (FRE 804(b)(3)), but that requires the declarant to be unavailable. The son is available because he's testifying, so that exception doesn't apply.

Another possibility is that it's a co-conspirator statement under FRE 801(d)(2)(E), but that requires that the statement was made in furtherance of a conspiracy and during its existence. The question doesn't mention conspiracy, so maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, if the statement is a present sense impression or excited utterance, but the question doesn't provide context for that.

So without an exception, the son's statement can't be used against the father as it's hearsay.

Thus, the son's confession is admissible against the son, but not against the father.

Looking at the options, option E is admitted against the son only. Option B says not admitted against the son, but admitted against the father, which seems incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the son is testifying, the Bruton problem is solved. But Bruton is about the Confrontation Clause, not hearsay. So even if the statement is hearsay, if the declarant is available for cross-examination, the statement is admissible under the rule of completeness or something else?

Wait, no, Bruton holds that a co-defendant's confession implicating another is inadmissible against the other without the opportunity for cross-examination. But when the co-defendant testifies, the statement becomes admissible because it's subject to cross.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating hearsay and Confrontation Clause issues. So, the son's statement is hearsay when used against the father, but when the son testifies, the father's attorney can cross him about the statement, which satisfies the Confrontation Clause. But does that make the statement admissible as substantive evidence, or just for impeachment?

Ah, that's the key. The statement can be used for impeachment (to show the son's prior inconsistent statement), but not as substantive evidence unless it's non-hearsay or falls under an exception.

So, if the prosecution wants to introduce the son's prior statement as evidence of the father's guilt, it's hearsay and inadmissible unless an exception applies. Since the son is testifying, the father's attorney can cross him about the statement, but that doesn't make the prior statement admissible as substantive evidence against the father.

Therefore, the son's confession can be used against the son (as his own statement), but not against the father because it's hearsay and no exception applies. Unless there's a conspiracy, but the question doesn't state that.

So the correct answer would be that the confession is admissible against the son only. Looking at the options, that's option E.

Wait, but option E says admitted against the son only. So that would mean the father's objection is sustained regarding his own guilt, but the son's confession is used against him.

Alternatively, if the statement is admissible against the father as non-hearsay because it's a statement of a co-conspirator made during the conspiracy, but without evidence of a conspiracy, that exception doesn't apply.

I think the correct answer is E: admitted against the son only.

Wait, but earlier I thought because the son is testifying, the father's attorney can cross, making the statement admissible. But I think that only allows the statement to be used for impeachment, not as substantive evidence against the father.

So the prosecution can't use the son's statement as evidence that the father committed the crime unless it's non-hearsay.

Therefore, the statement is admitted against the son but not against the father.

Looking at the options, that's option E: admitted against the son only.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the son's confession, which implicates both himself and his father, in a joint trial where the son recants the confession. The key issues are the rules of evidence, particularly hearsay and the Confrontation Clause as addressed in *Bruton v. United States*.

1. **Admissibility Against the Son**:  
   The son's confession is his own statement and is admissible against him under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2)(A) as an admission by a party opponent. The fact that the son later recanted his confession goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Therefore, the confession is admissible against the son.

2. **Admissibility Against the Father**:  
   The son's confession implicates the father, but it is hearsay when used against the father. Under *Bruton v. United States*, a co-defendant's confession implicating another defendant is inadmissible against the other defendant unless the confessing defendant testifies and is subject to cross-examination. While the son is testifying in this case, the ability to cross-examine him allows the father's attorney to challenge the confession. However, this does not resolve the hearsay issue. For the confession to be admissible against the father, it must fall under a hearsay exception, such as the statement against interest exception under FRE 804(b)(3). Since the son is available to testify, this exception does not apply. Thus, the confession cannot be used as substantive evidence against the father.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The confession is not admissible against the father, even if the son recanted.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The confession is admissible against the son, as it is his own statement.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While the son's testimony allows for cross-examination, the confession remains inadmissible against the father due to hearsay rules.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no evidence the confession was made under duress.  
   - **Option E**: Correct. The confession is admissible against the son only, as it is his own statement, but not against the father due to hearsay rules.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. Joint charging does not resolve the hearsay issue against the father.  
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The confession is not hearsay when used against the son.  
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Recantation affects weight, not admissibility.  
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. There is no indication of a conspiracy, so this exception does not apply.  
   - **Option J**: This is essentially the same as Option E, but less precise.

**Conclusion**: The son's confession is admissible against the son only, as it is his own statement, but it cannot be used as substantive evidence against the father due to hearsay rules.
