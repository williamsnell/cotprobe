Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about telescopes and resolving power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a normal eye can't separate two objects if their angular separation is less than 1.5 minutes. So we need to find the magnifying power of a telescope that lets the user fully use the telescope's resolving power. The telescope's objective has a diameter of 40 inches, and the mean wavelength is 5.5e-5 cm. Oh right, I remember that resolving power has to do with the smallest angle two objects can have and still be seen as separate. 

Wait, I think the formula for the resolving power of a telescope is based on the Rayleigh criterion. The formula is theta = 1.22 * lambda / (D), where theta is the minimum angle in radians, lambda is the wavelength, and D is the diameter of the telescope's aperture. But wait, I should make sure I have the formula right. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So first, I need to calculate theta, the resolving angle of the telescope. Let me plug in the numbers. The wavelength is given as 5.5e-5 cm. Oh wait, I need to convert that into consistent units. Let me think. D is in inches, but I should probably convert that to centimeters since lambda is in cm.

Wait, 1 inch is 2.54 cm. So 40 inches is 40 * 2.54 cm. Let me calculate that. 40*2.54 is 101.6 cm. So D is 101.6 cm.

Lambda is 5.5e-5 cm. So calculating theta: 1.22 * 5.5e-5 cm / 101.6 cm. Wait, the cm units will cancel, leaving it in radians.

Let me compute that. 1.22 * 5.5e-5 is approximately 6.71e-5. Then divide by 101.6: 6.71e-5 / 101.6 ≈ 6.607e-7 radians.

But wait, I think the problem says the eye can't separate angles less than 1.5 minutes. So that angle is the minimum the eye can see. So the idea is that the telescope's resolving power (which is smaller than that) will be made visible by the magnification. So the magnification M should make the telescope's theta equal to the eye's limit.

Wait, no. Wait, the telescope's resolving angle is theta_t, and the eye's limit is theta_e. The magnification M should make theta_t * M = theta_e, so that the smallest detail the telescope can resolve is expanded to the limit that the eye can see.

Wait, no, perhaps. Wait, so the formula for the magnifying power M is M = theta_e / theta_t. Because M is how much the angle is increased. So if theta_t is the telescope's resolution, then M should make theta_t * M equal to theta_e, making the angle just visible.

So rearranging, M = theta_e / theta_t.

But wait, let me make sure. The magnification M is the factor by which the angular size is increased. So if the telescope can resolve an angle theta_t, then with magnification M, the observed angle would be M * theta_t. We want this to be equal to the eye's resolving limit, theta_e. So M = theta_e / theta_t.

Yes, that makes sense.

So now I have theta_t calculated as approximately 6.607e-7 radians. Theta_e is 1.5 minutes of arc. I need to convert that to radians.

Wait, 1 minute is 1/60 degree, and 1 degree is pi/180 radians. So 1 minute is (pi/180)/60 = pi/(180*60) = pi/10800 radians. So 1.5 minutes is 1.5 * pi/(10800). Let me compute that.

1.5 * pi is about 4.712. So 4.712 / 10800 ≈ 4.367e-4 radians. So theta_e ≈ 4.367e-4 radians.

So M = (4.367e-4) / (6.607e-7) ≈ let's calculate that.

4.367e-4 divided by 6.607e-7. Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

4.367e-4 = 4.367 * 1e-4 = 0.0004367

6.607e-7 = 0.0000006607

Dividing 0.0004367 by 0.0000006607.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to write in scientific notation.

(4.367e-4) / (6.607e-7) = (4.367 / 6.607) * 1e3.

Calculating 4.367 / 6.607: Let me approximate. 6.607 goes into 4.367 about 0.66 times because 6.607 * 0.66 is about 4.36. So approximately 0.66 * 1e3 = 660.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. 6.607 * 0.66 = 6.607 * (2/3) is about 4.404. So 0.66 would be 4.36, which is very close to 4.367. So about 0.66, which gives 660.

Wait, but more accurately, let's do 4.367 ÷ 6.607.

6.607 * 0.66 = 4.361, which is just a little less than 4.367. So the actual value is approximately 0.66 + (4.367 -4.361)/(6.607) = 0.66 + (0.006)/(6.607) ≈ 0.66 + 0.0009 ≈ 0.6609.

So 0.6609 * 1e3 = 660.9. So M ≈ 661.

Looking at the options, option A is 660.6, which is really close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, computing theta_t: 1.22 * lambda / D.

lambda = 5.5e-5 cm.

D = 40 inches = 40 * 2.54 cm = 101.6 cm.

So 1.22 * 5.5e-5 = 6.71e-5. Divide by 101.6: 6.71e-5 / 101.6.

Let me compute that again. 6.71e-5 = 0.0000671.

0.0000671 / 101.6 = ?

Well, 0.0000671 / 100 is 6.71e-6. So 0.0000671 / 101.6 is a bit less, say 6.607e-6 radians. Wait, no: 0.0000671 / 101.6 ≈ 6.607e-7, because 6.607e-7 is 0.0000006607, but wait, that's not matching. Wait, 0.0000671 is 6.71e-5. Divided by 101.6, that's 6.71e-5 / 1.016e2 = 6.71e-5 / 1e2 = 6.71e-7, but wait, 101.6 is 1.016e2, so 6.71e-5 / 1.016e2 ≈ 6.607e-7 radians. So that part is correct.

Theta_e is 1.5 minutes. So 1.5 * (pi/10800) radians.

Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 1.5 * 3.1416 = 4.7124. 4.7124 / 10800 = approx 0.0004363 radians.

So M = theta_e / theta_t = 0.0004363 / 6.607e-7 ≈ let me calculate this division.

Alternatively, 0.0004363 / 0.0000006607. Let me write both as exponents:

4.363e-4 / 6.607e-7 = (4.363 / 6.607) * 1e3.

4.363 / 6.607: Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 6.607 * 0.66 = 4.361, which is 0.002 less than 4.363. So 0.66 would give 4.361. The difference is 4.363 -4.361 = 0.002. So 0.002 /6.607 ≈ 0.0003. So the total is 0.6603. So M is 0.6603 * 1e3 = 660.3.

So approximately 660.3. Looking at the options, option A is 660.6, which is very close. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thing to think about: the magnification formula. Did I get that right?

I think the formula for magnification to make the resolving power of the telescope equal to the resolving power of the eye is M = (theta_e) / (theta_t).

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula M = 5 * (D_objective)/(D_eyepiece). But that's the formula for magnification in telescopes. Wait, but perhaps that's a separate issue. No, wait, the question is about the magnifying power needed to make use of the full resolving power. So I think the approach I took is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the formula for magnification is M = (theta_e in radians) / (theta_t in radians). Which is what I used. So yes, that should be correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 660, so option A is 660.6, which matches.

To determine the magnifying power necessary for a telescope with a 40-inch diameter objective to make full use of its resolving power, we start by calculating the telescope's resolving angle, \( \theta_t \), using the Rayleigh criterion:

\[
\theta_t = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
\]

Here:
- \( \lambda = 5.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \) (mean wavelength),
- \( D = 40 \, \text{inches} = 101.6 \, \text{cm} \) (converted to centimeters).

Substituting the values:

\[
\theta_t = 1.22 \times \frac{5.5 \times 10^{-5}}{101.6} \approx 6.607 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{radians}.
\]

Next, the resolving limit of the human eye is given as \( \theta_e = 1.5 \, \text{minutes of arc} \). Converting this to radians:

\[
1 \, \text{minute} = \frac{\pi}{10800} \, \text{radians}, \quad \theta_e = 1.5 \times \frac{\pi}{10800} \approx 4.367 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The magnifying power \( M \) required to make the telescope's resolving angle equal to the eye's resolving limit is given by:

\[
M = \frac{\theta_e}{\theta_t}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{4.367 \times 10^{-4}}{6.607 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 660.3.
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is **660.6**, which corresponds to option **A**.
