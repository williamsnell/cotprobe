Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about what an allele that's masked is called. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that alleles are different forms of the same gene. Like, for example, if you have a gene that determines flower color, one allele might make it red and another might make it white. Now, when we talk about masking, I think it's about one allele hiding the effect of another. 

Wait, in Mendelian genetics, there's the concept of dominant and recessive alleles. The dominant allele is the one that gets expressed when both are present, and the recessive one is hidden. So, if you have a dominant allele, like B, and a recessive one, like b, the dominant (B) will show its trait, and the recessive (b) won't be seen. So the recessive allele is the one that's masked here.

Looking at the options, I see H is recessive. Then I think about the other terms. Words like repressive or repressed are in the options, but I don't think that's the term used here. Repressed might relate more to gene expression regulation, like when genes are turned off, but that's a different concept from masking due to dominance.

Redundant is another option, but redundant usually means something is extra or not needed. Like having backup systems. That doesn't seem to fit here. Resistant is also an option, but that's more about withstanding something, like antibiotics. So probably not that.

Recessive makes the most sense because it's the term used when an allele is masked by a dominant one. So when someone has, say, the genotype Bb, the B allele (dominant) is expressed, and the b (recessive) is masked.

I'm pretty sure the correct answer is H: recessive.

The question asks about the term used to describe an allele that is masked. In genetics, alleles can be dominant or recessive. A dominant allele is expressed when present, while a recessive allele is hidden or masked in the presence of a dominant allele. Among the options provided, "recessive" is the correct term for the masked allele. This aligns with Mendelian genetics, where the recessive allele (e.g., 'b') is not expressed when a dominant allele (e.g., 'B') is present.

Answer: H
