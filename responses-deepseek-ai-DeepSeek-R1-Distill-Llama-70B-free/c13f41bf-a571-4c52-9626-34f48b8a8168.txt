Question:

Brood parasites such as the cuckoo successfully trick other species of birds into rearing their young by exploiting the host birds' instinctive response to the loud begging cues of a fledgling in their nest. The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because

Options:

A: the host birds learn from the experience and are less likely to be duped in the future
B: on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry
C: the cuckoo fledglings share some of their genes with the host birds
D: the cuckoo fledglings contribute to the survival of the host bird species by increasing genetic diversity
E: the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species
F: the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced
G: on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own
H: the cuckoo fledglings help to protect the nest from predators
I: the genes that allow the host birds to be duped are necessary for the survival of the cuckoo species

Okay, so I've got this biology question about brood parasites, specifically cuckoos. Hmm, I remember that cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds' nests, tricking them into raising their young. The question is about why the genes that make the host birds susceptible to this trickery remain in the population. Interesting.

So, the question is a bit tricky. Let me think about what I know about natural selection and genetics. Host birds are raising cuckoo chicks instead of their own, which sounds like it would be bad for their own survival and reproductive success. So why haven't those genes disappeared?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Host birds learn and avoid it next time. Wait, but I think many birds don't learn this. Like, some species don't recognize the cuckoo eggs or chicks, so they might get parasitized again. Plus, learning would be an individual trait, but the question is about the gene pool. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B: Their response allows efficient rearing by feeding only the hungry. Oh, right, birds often use begging cues to decide whether to feed. If a chick is begging loudly, it's hungry. So the host's instinct is to respond to those cues. This behavior is probably good for their own chicks because they ensure they're feeding when necessary. So the genes for responding to begging cues are beneficial in normal situations, which is why they stay in the gene pool despite sometimes being exploited by cuckoos. That makes sense.

Option C: Cuckoo and host share genes. I don't think that's right. They're different species, so they don't share genes in that way. Unless it's about mimicry, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option D: Cuckoos increase genetic diversity. Wait, actually, brood parasitism might not contribute much to the host's genetic diversity. If the host's own offspring are dying, that could reduce diversity. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Rearing a cuckoo doesn't compromise the host's maximum fitness. But wait, if they're raising someone else's chick, their own chicks might die, so their fitness should decrease. So E doesn't seem right. Unless the cost isn't that significant.

Option F: Cuckoo's fitness would be reduced. That doesn't explain why the host's genes remain. The question is about the host's genes, not the cuckoo's.

Option G: Little energy spent on rearing. I doubt this is true. Raising a chick requires a lot of energy. If the host is spending energy on a cuckoo, that's a cost. So G probably isn't correct.

Option H: Cuckoo chicks protect from predators. I haven't heard this before. Maybe some cases where larger chicks deter predators, but I don't think that's the main reason the genes persist. So H is probably not the right choice.

Option I: Genes necessary for cuckoo survival. No, the question is about why the genes remain in the host's gene pool. The cuckoo's survival isn't directly tied to the host's genes in a way that would select for them.

So, circling back. The main idea is that the host's behavior is advantageous in normal circumstances, even though it can be exploited. So option B seems to be the best fit. The host's instinctive response helps them efficiently rear their own young by responding to hunger cues, which outweighs the cost of occasionally being tricked by a cuckoo.

The question asks why the genes that make host birds susceptible to brood parasitism by cuckoos remain in the population. The key lies in understanding that the host birds' behavior of responding to loud begging cues is advantageous in normal circumstances, as it allows them to efficiently rear their own young by feeding only those who indicate hunger. While this behavior can be exploited by cuckoos, the benefits it provides in typical situations outweigh the costs of occasional parasitism. This explains why these genes persist in the gene pool.

- **Option A** is incorrect because learning to avoid parasitism is not a genetic mechanism and does not explain the persistence of these genes.  
- **Option B** is correct because the host birds' response to begging cues is adaptive for rearing their own offspring efficiently.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because cuckoos and host birds are different species and do not share genes in a way that would explain the persistence of these genes.  
- **Option D** is incorrect because brood parasitism does not contribute to genetic diversity in the host population.  
- **Option E** is incorrect because raising a cuckoo chick can compromise the host's fitness by reducing the survival of their own offspring.  
- **Option F** is irrelevant because the question focuses on the host's genes, not the cuckoo's fitness.  
- **Option G** is incorrect because rearing a chick requires significant energy, and this cost does not explain the persistence of these genes.  
- **Option H** is incorrect because there is no evidence that cuckoo chicks protect the nest from predators.  
- **Option I** is incorrect because the question is about the host's genes, not the cuckoo's survival.  

Thus, the best explanation is that the host birds' response to begging cues is adaptive for their own reproductive success, which is why these genes remain in the gene pool.
