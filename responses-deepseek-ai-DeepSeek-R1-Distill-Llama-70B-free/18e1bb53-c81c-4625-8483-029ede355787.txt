Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a collision between two masses. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that when objects collide and stick together, it's called an inelastic collision. Right, and in such cases, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy isn't. So the key here is to use the conservation of momentum.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives me the velocities of both masses before the collision. Oh, but wait, I should check the directions because momentum is a vector quantity. Oh yeah, m1 is moving in the +x direction, and m2 is moving in the +y direction. So their momenta are in perpendicular directions. That must mean that the total momentum is the vector sum of the individual momenta.

Right, momentum is mass times velocity, so I should calculate each object's momentum separately and then add them as vectors. Let me jot this down.

Mass m1 is 5 kg, moving at 2 m/s in x. So its momentum is 5 * 2 = 10 kg·m/s in the x-direction. Mass m2 is 10 kg, moving at 4 m/s in y. So its momentum is 10 *4 =40 kg·m/s in y.

So the total momentum before collision is a vector with x-component 10 and y-component 40. After the collision, the combined mass is m1 + m2 = 15 kg. Let me call the final velocity v, which will be the same for both masses since they stick together.

The momentum after collision is (m1 + m2) * v, which is 15 kg multiplied by the vector v, which has components vx and vy.

So according to conservation of momentum, the initial total momentum equals the final total momentum.

So:

Initial momentum in x: 10 kg·m/s

Initial momentum in y: 40 kg·m/s

Final momentum in x: 15 * vx =10 → vx =10/15 = 2/3 ≈0.6667 m/s

Final momentum in y: 15 * vy =40 → vy=40/15=8/3 ≈2.6667 m/s

So the final velocity v is the vector (2/3, 8/3) m/s.

Wait, but I need to find the magnitude of this velocity. Oh right, because the options are given as scalar values. So I'll calculate the magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem.

v = sqrt( (2/3)^2 + (8/3)^2 )

Calculating each term:

(2/3)^2 =4/9

(8/3)^2=64/9

Sum is (4 +64)/9 =68/9

So v = sqrt(68/9) = sqrt(68)/3

Wait, what's sqrt(68)? Let me think. 68 is 4*17, so sqrt is 2*sqrt(17). So sqrt(68)=2√17.

So v = (2√17)/3.

Let me compute this numerically. √17 is approximately 4.123. So 2*4.123≈8.246. Divide by 3: about 2.749 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.750 m/sec. So that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. Since the two masses stick together, their final velocity is the same.

### Step 1: Calculate initial momenta
- Mass \( m_1 = 5 \, \text{kg} \) moves in the \( +x \)-direction with \( u_1 = 2 \, \text{m/s} \). Its momentum is:
  \[
  p_{1x} = m_1 u_1 = 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
  \]
- Mass \( m_2 = 10 \, \text{kg} \) moves in the \( +y \)-direction with \( u_2 = 4 \, \text{m/s} \). Its momentum is:
  \[
  p_{2y} = m_2 u_2 = 10 \cdot 4 = 40 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
  \]

### Step 2: Total momentum before collision
The total momentum is the vector sum of the individual momenta:
\[
\vec{p}_{\text{total}} = (10 \, \text{kg·m/s}) \, \hat{x} + (40 \, \text{kg·m/s}) \, \hat{y}.
\]

### Step 3: Momentum after collision
After the collision, the two masses stick together, so their combined mass is:
\[
m_{\text{total}} = m_1 + m_2 = 5 + 10 = 15 \, \text{kg}.
\]
Let the final velocity be \( \vec{v} = v_x \hat{x} + v_y \hat{y} \). The momentum after the collision is:
\[
\vec{p}_{\text{final}} = m_{\text{total}} \vec{v} = 15 \cdot (v_x \hat{x} + v_y \hat{y}).
\]

### Step 4: Conservation of momentum
Equating the total momentum before and after the collision:
\[
15 v_x = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 15 v_y = 40.
\]
Solving for \( v_x \) and \( v_y \):
\[
v_x = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{m/s}, \quad v_y = \frac{40}{15} = \frac{8}{3} \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Magnitude of the final velocity
The magnitude of the final velocity is:
\[
v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^2}.
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}, \quad \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{64}{9}.
\]
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{4}{9} + \frac{64}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{68}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{68}}{3}.
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
\sqrt{68} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 17} = 2\sqrt{17}, \quad v = \frac{2\sqrt{17}}{3}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{17} \approx 4.123 \):
\[
v \approx \frac{2 \cdot 4.123}{3} \approx \frac{8.246}{3} \approx 2.749 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Final Answer
The final velocity is approximately \( 2.750 \, \text{m/s} \), which corresponds to **option A**.
