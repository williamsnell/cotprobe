Okay, so I have this determinant problem to solve. The question is evaluating the determinant of a matrix, and I need to find out which option is correct. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the given matrices. The problem is written as Δ = |1 -4 -5| and |123|, |-31 -2|. Wait, maybe I'm getting the notation wrong. Oh, right, sometimes determinants are written with vertical bars, but I think each set of bars represents a matrix. So maybe it's two separate determinants multiplied together?

Wait, the question actually shows Δ equals the product of two determinants. So Δ = |1  -4  -5| multiplied by |123| and |-31 -2|. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me parse this again.

Oh wait, perhaps the first part is a 3x3 matrix and the second is a 2x2. Let me check the notation. The first part is written as |1-4-5|, but that's three elements in a row. So maybe it's a 3x3 matrix:

First matrix:
1  -4  -5
1  2   3
-3 -1  -2

Wait, no, the problem seems to be written as |1 -4 -5| and then another part: |123| and |-31 -2|. Maybe it's two separate determinants being multiplied.

Wait, maybe the first determinant is a 3x3 matrix and the second is a 2x2. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says Δ equals the determinant of the first matrix times the determinant of the second. So I have two matrices. Let me write them out.

First matrix:
The first determinant is |1 -4 -5|
But wait, that's three elements in a row. So perhaps it's a 3x3 matrix with rows [1, -4, -5], [1, 2, 3], [-3, -1, -2]? Or maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the first part is a 3x3 matrix arranged as:

Row 1: 1, -4, -5
Row 2: 1, 2, 3
Row 3: -3, -1, -2

And the second determinant is a 2x2 matrix:

First row: 1, 2, 3
Second row: -3, -1, -2

Wait, that doesn't make sense because a 2x2 matrix only has two elements per row. Oh, wait, no, the second determinant is written as |123| and |-31 -2|. Oh wait, perhaps the second matrix is:

First row: 1, 2, 3
Second row: -3, -1, -2

Wait, but that's a 2x3 matrix, which can't have a determinant. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe the notation is that the first matrix is 3x3 and the second is 2x2. So let me try to reconstruct them.

First matrix (3x3):

Row 1: 1, -4, -5
Row 2: 1, 2, 3
Row 3: -3, -1, -2

Wait, that can't be right because I don't see 1, 2, 3 in the problem. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first matrix is arranged as:

Row 1: 1, -4, -5
Row 2: 1, 2, 3
Row 3: -3, -1, -2

Wait, but the problem's first determinant is written as |1-4-5| and the second as |123| and |-31-2|. Oh wait, perhaps the first matrix is:

Row 1: 1, -4, -5
Row 2: 1, 2, 3
Row 3: -3, -1, -2

And the second matrix is:

Row 1: 1, 2, 3
Row 2: -3, -1, -2

But that would make the second matrix 2x3, which can't have a determinant. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, maybe the second matrix is 2x2, with rows [1,2,3] and [-3,-1,-2], but that would be 2x3 as well. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second determinant is a 2x2 matrix, so maybe the rows are [1,2] and [-3,-1], but that doesn't fit the given. Alternatively, perhaps the second matrix is:

Row 1: 1, 2, 3
Row 2: -3, -1, -2

But that's 2x3. So that can't be. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the first determinant is a 3x3 matrix, and the second is a 2x2, but I'm not sure how the second matrix is structured. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is combining a 3x3 and a 2x2 determinant in some way.

Wait, perhaps the notation is that the first matrix is:

|1  -4  -5|
|1   2   3|
|-3 -1  -2|

And the second determinant is a 2x2 matrix:

|1 2|
|-3 -1|

Wait, that would make sense because the second part is written as |123| and |-31-2|. Wait, no, the problem says |123| and |-31 -2|. Hmm, maybe the second matrix is:

|1 2|
|-3 -1|

So let me clarify:

Δ = det(A) * det(B), where A is the 3x3 matrix and B is the 2x2 matrix.

So first, compute det(A), then compute det(B), multiply them.

Let's compute det(A) first.

Matrix A:
Row 1: 1, -4, -5
Row 2: 1, 2, 3
Row 3: -3, -1, -2

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me use expansion by minors along the first row.

det(A) = 1 * det( [2,3; -1,-2] ) - (-4) * det( [1,3; -3,-2] ) + (-5) * det( [1,2; -3,-1] )

Let me compute each minor:

First minor: det( [2,3; -1,-2] ) = (2*(-2)) - (3*(-1)) = (-4) +3 = -1

Second minor: det( [1,3; -3,-2] ) = (1*(-2)) - (3*(-3)) = (-2) +9 =7

Third minor: det( [1,2; -3,-1] ) = (1*(-1)) - (2*(-3)) = (-1) +6=5

Putting it all together:

det(A) = 1*(-1) +4*(7) -5*(5) 
= (-1) +28 -25 
= (-1 +28) is 27, 27-25=2.

Wait, that gives det(A)=2.

Now, compute det(B), where B is the 2x2 matrix:

|1 2|
|-3 -1|

det(B) = (1*(-1)) - (2*(-3)) = (-1) +6 =5.

So Δ = det(A) * det(B) = 2 *5=10.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 10. So the answer would be F.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Let me recalculate det(A):

Compute each minor again.

First minor: [2,3; -1,-2] determinant: 2*(-2) -3*(-1) =-4 +3= -1. Correct.

Second minor: [1,3; -3,-2]: 1*(-2) -3*(-3)= -2+9=7. Correct.

Third minor: [1,2; -3,-1]: 1*(-1) -2*(-3)= -1 +6=5. Correct.

So det(A) =1*(-1) +4*(7) + (-5)*(5). Wait, no: the formula is a11*M11 -a12*M12 +a13*M13.

Wait, wait— the expansion is along the first row: a11, a12, a13.

The cofactors are:

a11: +det(M11)
a12: -det(M12)
a13: +det(M13)

So det(A)= 1*(det M11) - (-4)*(det M12) + (-5)*(det M13).

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Let me correct that.

det(A) = 1*(-1) - (-4)*(7) + (-5)*(5)

= (-1) +4*(7) -5*(5)

= -1 +28 -25 = 2. So same result.

det(B)=5, so 2*5=10.

Looking back at the options, option F is 10. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but I just noticed that the problem might be written differently. Looking again, the original problem is written as:

Δ = |1 -4 -5| |123| |-31 -2|

Wait, perhaps the first determinant is a 3x3 matrix, and the second is a 2x2 matrix. So:

First matrix (3x3):

1  -4  -5
1   2   3
-3 -1  -2

Second matrix (2x2):

1  2
-3 -1

Yes, that's what I did earlier. So yes, the answer is 10, which is option F.

The problem involves evaluating the product of two determinants, Δ = det(A) * det(B), where:

- Matrix **A** is a 3x3 matrix:
  \[
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -4 & -5 \\
  1 & 2 & 3 \\
  -3 & -1 & -2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- Matrix **B** is a 2x2 matrix:
  \[
  B = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  -3 & -1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

### Step 1: Compute det(A)
The determinant of a 3x3 matrix is calculated using expansion by minors. Expanding along the first row:

\[
\text{det}(A) = 1 \cdot \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -1 & -2 \end{bmatrix} - (-4) \cdot \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 \end{bmatrix} + (-5) \cdot \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Compute each minor:
1. \(\text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -1 & -2 \end{bmatrix} = (2 \cdot -2) - (3 \cdot -1) = -4 + 3 = -1\)
2. \(\text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 \end{bmatrix} = (1 \cdot -2) - (3 \cdot -3) = -2 + 9 = 7\)
3. \(\text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = (1 \cdot -1) - (2 \cdot -3) = -1 + 6 = 5\)

Substitute back:
\[
\text{det}(A) = 1 \cdot (-1) - (-4) \cdot 7 + (-5) \cdot 5 = -1 + 28 - 25 = 2
\]

### Step 2: Compute det(B)
The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated as:
\[
\text{det}(B) = (1 \cdot -1) - (2 \cdot -3) = -1 + 6 = 5
\]

### Step 3: Compute Δ
\[
\Delta = \text{det}(A) \cdot \text{det}(B) = 2 \cdot 5 = 10
\]

### Final Answer
The value of Δ is **10**, which corresponds to option **F**.

F
