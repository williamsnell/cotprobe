Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Hume's attack on natural law. The question is asking which argument Hume uses. The options are A through D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I'll try to remember what I know about David Hume and his philosophical views, especially regarding natural law. I remember that Hume was a Scottish philosopher known for his empiricist and skeptical approaches. He wrote a lot about metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.

Natural law theory typically posits that there's a moral law inherent in nature, discoverable through reason, and it's often associated with thinkers like Thomas Aquinas. Natural law is seen as providing a basis for moral and legal principles that are universal and objective.

Now, Hume is known for his critique of certain metaphysical and ethical theories. One of his famous arguments is the "is-ought problem," which he discusses in his Treatise on Human Nature. In that, he points out that many writers make an unjustified leap from describing how things are (facts) to prescribing how they ought to be (values). He argues that just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it should be that way morally.

Hume's critique of natural law might relate to this. If natural law is supposed to derive moral obligations from observations about human nature or the natural world, Hume would argue that this is a faulty move because it tries to derive an "ought" from an "is." So, he might say that natural law can't provide a solid foundation for morality because it's trying to move from facts to values without proper justification.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong." This sounds more like a moral subjectivist or relativist position. Hume did have skeptical views about objective morality, but I'm not sure if this is the basis of his attack on natural law specifically. His main point might be more about the logical leap rather than the impossibility of objective knowledge.

Option B: "Natural law is backward-looking." I'm not too familiar with this term in this context. Maybe it refers to natural law being based on past observations or traditions? Not sure, but I don't recall Hume making this point specifically.

Option C: "There is no such thing as a social contract." This seems more related to Hume's critique of the social contract theory, which he did argue against. He believed that political obligation isn't based on an explicit or tacit contract, but rather on interests and utility. But the question is about natural law, not social contract.

Option D: "Natural law fails to protect the state against attacks." This sounds more like a pragmatic or political argument about effectiveness, which doesn't ring a bell with Hume's main critiques. He was more focused on the philosophical underpinnings than practical applications like state protection.

So, based on this, the main issue Hume had with natural law is the attempt to derive moral conclusions from factual premises, which is the is-ought problem. None of the options explicitly mention the is-ought problem, so I need to match it to the closest option.

Wait, but the options don't directly reference the is-ought problem. So perhaps I need to think differently. Hume's attack on natural law might also involve the idea that natural law theories assume certain things about human nature that aren't necessarily universal or objective.

Another angle: Hume was critical of the idea that reason can determine moral laws. He believed that morality is based on sentiment rather than reason. So, natural law, which often claims that reason can discover moral truths, would be flawed in Hume's view because it's trying to use reason where sentiment is the actual basis.

Looking again at the options, none directly state this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about Hume's argument against natural law. I've read that Hume argued against the notion that there's a rational basis for morality, which natural law theories assert. So Hume would say that natural law can't be objective because it's based on human sentiments, which vary.

So, option A says "We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong." This aligns with the idea that Hume thinks morality isn't objective, which undermines natural law's claims to provide objective moral principles.

Alternatively, option C is about social contract, which I think is a separate issue.

So, putting it together, Hume's attack on natural law is that it can't provide objective moral knowledge because it's based on sentiments, so the correct answer would be A.

Hume's attack on natural law is rooted in his philosophical skepticism, particularly his argument that morality cannot be derived from reason or objective facts. He famously critiqued the idea that moral conclusions can be logically inferred from factual premises, known as the "is-ought problem." Natural law theories, which often claim that moral principles can be discovered through reason and are universally applicable, are vulnerable to this critique. Hume argued that morality is based on sentiment rather than reason, implying that natural law cannot provide an objective foundation for morality.

Among the options provided:

- **Option A** aligns with Hume's skepticism about objective moral knowledge, which undermines natural law's claims to provide universal moral principles.
- **Option B** is unclear in this context and does not directly relate to Hume's critique.
- **Option C** pertains to Hume's views on the social contract, which is a separate issue from his critique of natural law.
- **Option D** focuses on the practical effectiveness of natural law, which is not Hume's primary concern.

Thus, the most accurate answer is **A**, as it reflects Hume's argument that objective moral knowledge, as claimed by natural law, is not possible.

Answer: A
