Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the energy required to transfer an electron from sodium to chlorine. Hmm, let's think about what I know.

I remember that ionization potential is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. Sodium has an ionization potential of 5.1 eV. So that's the energy needed to take an electron from Na. But wait, when an atom loses an electron, it becomes a positive ion, right? So sodium would become Na+.

On the other hand, electron affinity is the energy released when an atom gains an electron. Chlorine's electron affinity is 3.6 eV. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait a secondâ€”when an atom gains an electron, does it release energy or require energy? Oh right, electron affinity is the energy change when an electron is added. If it's positive, energy is released. So when chlorine gains an electron, it releases 3.6 eV. But in this case, we're talking about transferring an electron from Na to Cl, so the Cl gains an electron, so that part releases energy.

So the total energy required would be the sum of the energy needed to remove the electron from Na and the energy change when Cl accepts it. Wait, no. Because Na losing an electron requires energy (the ionization potential), and Cl gaining it releases energy (so it's a negative in terms of energy required). So the total energy change is ionization potential of Na minus the electron affinity of Cl.

Wait, not exactly. Let me think. The process is: Na loses an electron (costs 5.1 eV), and Cl gains it (releases 3.6 eV). So the net energy required is 5.1 eV (because you have to spend that to ionize Na) minus 3.6 eV (because Cl gives back some energy when it accepts the electron).

So 5.1 minus 3.6 is 1.5 eV. But wait, is that the case? Or do I need to sum them because both processes are happening together?

Wait, no, because the ionization is an energy cost, and the electron affinity is an energy gain. So the overall energy change for the process is the sum of the cost minus the gain.

So the total energy required would be 5.1 eV (energy needed to remove the electron from Na) plus the electron affinity (but wait, no, because the affinity is the energy released when adding the electron). So the net is 5.1 (cost) minus 3.6 (gain) = 1.5 eV.

So the amount of energy required is 1.5 eV. Looking at the options, option H is 1.5 eV.

Wait a second, but sometimes I get confused whether it's the reverse. Wait, the ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron, so that's a cost. The electron affinity is the energy released when an electron is added, which in this case would be a gain for the system, so it's subtracted from the cost.

So yes, 5.1 - 3.6 = 1.5. So the answer should be H.

To calculate the energy required to transfer one electron from an isolated sodium (Na) atom to an isolated chlorine (Cl) atom, we consider the ionization potential of sodium and the electron affinity of chlorine.

1. **Ionization Potential of Sodium (Na):** This is the energy required to remove an electron from a sodium atom, given as 5.1 eV. This is an energy cost.

2. **Electron Affinity of Chlorine (Cl):** This is the energy released when chlorine gains an electron, given as 3.6 eV. This is an energy gain.

The net energy required for the electron transfer is the energy cost to ionize sodium minus the energy gain from chlorine accepting the electron:

\[
\text{Net Energy Required} = \text{Ionization Potential of Na} - \text{Electron Affinity of Cl}
\]

\[
\text{Net Energy Required} = 5.1 \, \text{eV} - 3.6 \, \text{eV} = 1.5 \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy required to transfer one electron from sodium to chlorine is 1.5 eV. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 1.5 eV**

Answer: H
