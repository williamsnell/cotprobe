The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Suppose Q is a measure of output, K is a measure of capital stock in use, and L is a measure of the size of the employed labor force. Q =AK^\betaL^\gamma is a much used form of production function. When \beta + \gamma = 1, it is known as a Cobb-Douglas production function. This function has many convenient properties: Marginal products of both labor and capital are positive if \beta and \gamma are. If \beta + \gamma = 1, the function has constant returns to scale. That is, if both inputs are increased in like proportion, output will increase in that same proportion. A doubling of both inputs, for example, will result in doubled output. Discuss how the concept of linear regression might be applied to estimate \beta and \gamma .

Options:

A: Polynomial regression
B: Linear progression
C: Quantile regression
D: Ridge regression
E: Logistic regression
F: Exponential regression
G: Lasso regression
H: Multiple regression
I: Single regression
J: Non-linear regression

Okay, so I've got this question about production functions and regression analysis. Hmm, let's see. The question is about using linear regression to estimate beta and gamma in a Cobb-Douglas production function. 

The production function is given as Q = A K^β L^γ. Oh right, when beta plus gamma equals one, it's the Cobb-Douglas type with constant returns to scale. But the question is about estimating these parameters using linear regression.

Wait, how do you apply linear regression here? Because the equation isn't linear in its current form. Q equals A times K to the power beta times L to the power gamma. That's a multiplicative model, not linear. 

So I remember that to linearize such models, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides. Taking logs turns products into sums, which is easier to handle with linear regression. Let me try that.

Taking ln on both sides: ln Q = ln A + β ln K + γ ln L. Oh, right, because ln(a^b) is b ln a. So this transforms the equation into a linear form where the dependent variable is ln Q, and the independent variables are ln K and ln L. The coefficient beta would be the coefficient for ln K, and gamma for ln L. And the intercept term would be ln A.

So in linear regression terms, we can set up the model as ln Q = intercept + β ln K + γ ln L. Then, using data on Q, K, and L, we can run a multiple regression where we have two predictors: ln K and ln L. The intercept would give us ln A, and the coefficients on the variables would give us beta and gamma.

Looking at the answer options, the question is about how to apply linear regression. The correct approach would be multiple regression because we have two independent variables (ln K and ln L). So the answer would be H: Multiple regression.

Wait, but could it be another form? Like, if the model was non-linear, but we linearize it, then using multiple regression applies. So yes, the method is multiple regression. The other options don't fit: single regression would only have one variable, which isn't the case here. Polynomial or others don't apply because after linearization, it's a standard linear model with multiple variables.

To estimate the parameters β and γ in the Cobb-Douglas production function \( Q = A K^\beta L^\gamma \) using linear regression, the equation must first be linearized. By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we transform the multiplicative model into a linear form:

\[
\ln Q = \ln A + \beta \ln K + \gamma \ln L
\]

Here, the dependent variable is \(\ln Q\), and the independent variables are \(\ln K\) and \(\ln L\). The intercept term corresponds to \(\ln A\), while the coefficients for \(\ln K\) and \(\ln L\) represent \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\), respectively. This setup allows us to apply **multiple regression**, as we have two independent variables (\(\ln K\) and \(\ln L\)).

Among the answer choices, "Multiple regression" (H) is the correct approach because it accommodates the two independent variables in the linearized model. Other options, such as "Single regression" (I), would only apply if there were one independent variable, which is not the case here. Similarly, other methods like polynomial or logistic regression are not relevant to this context.
