Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Malus' law and polarized light. Hmm, I remember Malus' law is I = I0 * cos²(theta), right? So the problem says that unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, then another at 30 degrees, and then another at 50 degrees to the second. I need to find the percentage of the original intensity after the third polarizer.

Wait, wait, let's break this down step by step. Unpolarized light first goes through a polarizer. I remember that when unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, the intensity becomes half because only the polarized part gets through. So after the first polarizer, the intensity is I1 = I0 / 2.

Then, the next polarizer is at 30 degrees to the first. So the angle between them is 30 degrees. Applying Malus' law again, the intensity after the second polarizer would be I2 = I1 * cos²(30). Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, so cos squared is 3/4. So I2 = (I0/2) * (3/4) = (3 I0)/8.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the angle for the third polarizer. Because the third polarizer is at 50 degrees to the second. So the angle between the second and third is 50 degrees. So for the third step, the light's angle relative to the third polarizer is 50 degrees.

So the third polarizer: I3 = I2 * cos²(50). Let me calculate that.

So putting it all together:

I1 = I0/2.

I2 = I1 * cos²(30) = (I0/2) * ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = (I0/2) * (3/4) = (3 I0)/8.

I3 = I2 * cos²(50) = (3 I0/8) * cos²(50 degrees).

Wait, but wait, what's the value of cos(50 degrees)? Let me think. I know that cos(60) is 0.5, cos(45) is about 0.707, and cos(30) is about 0.866. So cos(50) is somewhere around 0.6428? Let me confirm: yes, 50 degrees is approximately 0.6428 radians? Wait no, wait. Wait 50 degrees is about 0.6428 in terms of the cosine value. Wait, actually, cos(50°) is approximately 0.6428? Or wait, wait, no, wait: 50 degrees is in degrees, not radians. Oh wait no, in terms of the value, cos(50°) is approximately 0.6428. Wait no, wait. Wait, 60 degrees is 0.5, 45 is around 0.707, 30 is 0.866. So 50 is between 45 and 60, so the cosine should be between 0.5 and 0.707. So 0.6428 is correct for 50 degrees. Because 50 degrees is 10 degrees above 40, so maybe the exact value isn't crucial, but perhaps it's better to use exact terms.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to calculate it in terms of exact expressions and see if it aligns with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is such that when applying the three steps, the product of the cos squared terms leads to a certain percentage.

Wait, let me compute each step numerically. I0 is the initial intensity, which is 100% of the original. After the first polarizer: 50% remains.

Then, 30 degrees. Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Squared is 3/4 ≈ 0.75. So 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.375, which is 37.5%.

Then, the next angle is 50 degrees. Cos(50) is approximately 0.6428. Squared is about (0.6428)^2. Let me compute that: 0.6428 * 0.6428. 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36, 0.0428*0.6 is about 0.02568, and 0.6 * 0.0428 is another 0.02568, and 0.0428^2 is negligible. So perhaps around 0.4132. Wait, actually, better to compute it more accurately. 0.6428 squared: 0.6428 * 0.6428.

Let me compute 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36. 0.6 * 0.0428 = 0.02568. 0.0428 * 0.6 = same as above. Then 0.0428 * 0.0428 is about 0.00183. So adding it all:

(0.6 + 0.0428)^2 = 0.6^2 + 2*(0.6)(0.0428) + 0.0428^2 = 0.36 + 0.05136 + 0.00183 ≈ 0.41319. So approximately 0.4132.

So I3 = I2 * 0.4132. I2 was 0.375 I0, so 0.375 * 0.4132 = let's compute that.

0.375 * 0.4 is 0.15. 0.375 * 0.0132 is approximately 0.00495. So total is approximately 0.15495. So about 15.5% of the original intensity.

Wait, but let me check the steps again. Wait, the first step is I1 = I0/2, correct. Second step is I2 = I1 * cos²(30°) = (I0/2) * (3/4) = 3 I0/8 = 0.375 I0. Third step is I3 = I2 * cos²(50°) = 0.375 I0 * (approx 0.4132) = 0.375 * 0.4132 ≈ 0.15495 I0.

So that's about 15.5% of the original intensity. Now, looking at the options, option G is 15.0, and option F is 12.5, option H is 25.

Wait, but wait, am I making a mistake in the angles? Because the second polarizer is at 30 degrees to the first, which would make the angle between the light and the second polarizer 30 degrees. Then the third polarizer is at 50 degrees to the second, so the angle between the light and the third polarizer is 50 degrees. Wait, but wait, how is the light polarized after the second polarizer? Because after the second polarizer, the light is polarized along that second polarizer's axis. So when the third polarizer is placed at 50 degrees relative to the second, the angle theta in Malus' law is 50 degrees. So that part was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle should be cumulative. Wait, let me think. If the first polarizer is at 0 degrees, the second is at 30 degrees, so the angle between the light (after second polarizer) and the third polarizer is 50 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, the third is at 50 degrees relative to the second. So the total angle of the third relative to the first would be 30 + 50 = 80 degrees. But that's not relevant because the light's polarization is along the second polarizer's axis. So the angle between the light's polarization and the third polarizer is 50 degrees. So yes, theta is 50 degrees.

So I think the calculation is correct, giving approximately 15.5%. The options don't have exactly 15.5, but option G is 15.0, which is the closest. So I think the answer is G, 15.0.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute cos(50 degrees) exactly as a calculator would.

Wait, I don't have a calculator here, but I can remember that cos(50°) is approximately 0.6427876097. Squaring that gives (0.6427876097)^2 ≈ 0.4131759112.

So I3 = (3/8) * 0.4131759112 I0.

3/8 is 0.375. So 0.375 * 0.4131759112 ≈ 0.154951587 I0.

So 15.495% approximately. So about 15.5%, which rounds to 15.5%. Looking at the options, the closest is G:15.0.

Wait, but let's see. Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Maybe the angle for the third polarizer is not 50 degrees but 50 degrees added to the previous 30, making it 80 degrees. Wait, no, wait. When you have polarizers arranged in sequence, each is at an angle relative to the previous one. So the third is 50 degrees relative to the second. So the angle between the second and third is 50 degrees. So the light's polarization is along the second's axis, so the angle theta for the third polarizer is 50 degrees. So that part was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go through each step again.

First, the initial intensity is I0, but it's unpolarized. So after the first polarizer, I1 = I0 * (1/2) = I0/2.

Then, the second polarizer is at 30 degrees relative to the first. So the angle theta is 30 degrees. So I2 = I1 * cos²(30) = (I0/2) * (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (I0/2) * 3/4 = 3 I0 / 8.

The third polarizer is at 50 degrees relative to the second. So the angle theta is 50 degrees. So I3 = I2 * cos²(50) = (3 I0 /8 ) * (cos(50))².

So I3 = (3/8) * (approx 0.6428)^2 * I0.

As computed earlier, that's approximately 0.15495 I0, which is ~15.5%.

So the percentage is approximately 15.5%. The options don't have exactly 15.5, but option G is 15.0 and option F is 12.5. So the closest is 15.0, so the answer would be G.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first step isn't 50%. Because when unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, yes, it's I0/2. Then, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the angles in a different way. Let me think: after the first polarizer, the light is polarized at 0 degrees. The second polarizer is at 30 degrees, so the angle between the light's polarization (0) and the second polarizer's axis (30) is 30 degrees. So I2 = I1 * cos²(30) = (I0/2) * (3/4) = 3I0/8.

Then, the third polarizer is at 50 degrees relative to the second, which is at 30 degrees. So the third polarizer is at 30 + 50 = 80 degrees from the first polarizer. But the light after the second is polarized along the second's axis (30 degrees). So the angle between the light's polarization (30 degrees) and the third polarizer (80 degrees) is 80 - 30 = 50 degrees. So yes, theta is 50 degrees.

So the calculation is correct. So the answer is approximately 15.5%, which is closest to option G:15.0.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A:40.0, B:45, C:55, D:60, E:50, F:12.5, G:15, H:25, I:70, J:31.

So 15.5% is closest to 15.0% (G). So the correct answer is G.

But wait, wait another thing. What if the third polarizer's angle is 50 degrees relative to the second polarizer, making the angle between the light and the third polarizer 50 degrees. So everything is correct. So yes, the answer is G:15.0.

To solve the problem, we use Malus' law: 

\[
I = I_0 \cos^2(\theta),
\]

where \( I \) is the intensity of polarized light after passing through a polarizer, \( I_0 \) is the intensity before the polarizer, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the light's polarization direction and the polarizer's axis.

### Step 1: First Polarizer
Unpolarized light passes through the first polarizer. Since unpolarized light has no preferred polarization direction, only half of the intensity passes through. Thus, after the first polarizer:

\[
I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2}.
\]

### Step 2: Second Polarizer
The second polarizer is at an angle of \( 30^\circ \) relative to the first. Using Malus' law:

\[
I_2 = I_1 \cos^2(30^\circ).
\]

Since \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), we have:

\[
\cos^2(30^\circ) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Substituting \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \):

\[
I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3I_0}{8}.
\]

### Step 3: Third Polarizer
The third polarizer is at an angle of \( 50^\circ \) relative to the second. Using Malus' law again:

\[
I_3 = I_2 \cos^2(50^\circ).
\]

The value of \( \cos(50^\circ) \) is approximately \( 0.6428 \), so:

\[
\cos^2(50^\circ) \approx (0.6428)^2 \approx 0.4132.
\]

Substituting \( I_2 = \frac{3I_0}{8} \):

\[
I_3 = \frac{3I_0}{8} \cdot 0.4132 \approx 0.15495I_0.
\]

### Final Percentage
The intensity after the third polarizer is approximately \( 15.5\% \) of the original intensity. Among the given options, the closest value is \( 15.0\% \).

### Answer
G: 15.0

The final answer is:

**G**
