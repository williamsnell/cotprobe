Question:

A retiree owned a building in a city. Several years ago, an artist, in a signed writing, entered a three- year lease agreement with the retiree. The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?

Options:

A: Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.
B: Sue the artist for damages due to the infestation of rats.
C: Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.
D: Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.
E: Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.
F: Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years.
G: Require the artist to pay for the extermination of the rats.
H: Terminate the lease agreement without any further obligations.
I: Recovery of triple the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about landlord-tenant law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by reading through the question carefully.

The scenario is about a retiree who owns a building and leased the third-floor apartment to an artist. The lease was for three years, and both parties signed a written agreement. The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly. Now, the three-year term has expired, but the artist kept paying rent, and the retiree accepted it. Then, a restaurant opened next door, leading to a rat infestation. The artist couldn't handle the rats and served notice that he's moving out, and now the retiree is looking for a remedy.

The question is asking what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial three-year lease ended. So, the key here is understanding what happens when a lease expires but the tenant continues to occupy the property with the landlord's consent.

I remember that when a lease ends, if the tenant stays and the landlord accepts rent, it usually creates a new tenancy. But what type? I think it's either a tenancy at will or a year-to-year tenancy, depending on the jurisdiction. At common law, I believe it's typically a year-to-year tenancy. That means the lease renews for another year, and either party can terminate it with proper notice, usually a year's notice.

So, in this case, after the three years, the artist stayed, and the retiree accepted rent. That would create a year-to-year tenancy. Now, the artist gave notice that he's moving out. But wait, in a year-to-year tenancy, if the tenant leaves before the year is up, they might be liable for the remaining rent unless the landlord can re-let the property. But the question is about what remedy the landlord had before accepting the first payment after the lease ended.

Wait, before accepting the first payment, the lease had already expired. So before that, the landlord could have chosen to either accept the rent, creating a new tenancy, or to terminate the tenancy. But since the landlord accepted the rent, that's creating a new year-to-year tenancy.

But the question is about the remedy available before she accepted that first payment. So before she accepted any rent beyond the three years, the lease was over. So the tenant was technically a holdover tenant, right? Because the lease had ended, and they were still there without a new agreement.

Holdover tenancyâ€”so the tenant is remaining in possession after the lease ends. At common law, the landlord could treat this as a new tenancy or as a tenancy at will. But if the landlord accepts rent, that usually creates a new tenancy. However, before accepting any rent, the landlord could take action.

Wait, the question is specifically about before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial term. So, before she took any rent after the three years, what could she do?

In that situation, the tenant is a holdover. The landlord can either:

1. Treat the tenant as a trespasser and evict them, or
2. Accept their stay as a new tenancy (which would typically be year-to-year).

If the landlord doesn't accept rent, they can proceed with eviction. But once they accept rent, they're creating a new tenancy, making eviction more complicated because they now have a tenant with a new term.

So, the possible remedies for the landlord before accepting the rent would include eviction. Because the lease had ended, the tenant was holding over without permission. So the landlord could choose to evict for holding over.

Looking at the options:

Option D says "Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent." Wait, but in this case, the artist was paying rent. So non-payment isn't the issue. So D might not be correct.

Option E says "Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent." That doesn't sound right because the initial lease was three years, and it's over. So maybe that's not applicable.

Option C is about recovery of the difference between lease price and market value for a year. That sounds like it's about damages for breaking a lease, but in this case, the lease had ended, so the artist wasn't breaking it.

Option H says "Terminate the lease without any obligations." Well, the lease had already ended, so termination isn't the issue. It's more about the holdover.

Wait, but if the landlord hasn't accepted any rent beyond the term, the tenant is a holdover tenant. The landlord can choose to evict them. So the available remedy would be eviction.

But looking back, the options don't have a straightforward eviction for holdover. Let me check the options again.

Option D is eviction for non-payment. But the artist was paying rent, so that's not the case. So D isn't correct.

Wait, maybe another angle. At common law, when a tenant holds over, the landlord can elect to treat them as a trespasser and evict, or treat them as a new tenant. Since the question is about before accepting any rent, the landlord can choose to evict for the holdover without accepting any rent beyond the term.

So the correct remedy would be eviction for being a holdover tenant. But looking at the options, none directly say that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Let me re-read it. Option E says "Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent." That seems like it's implying that the tenant is bound for another three years, which would be a new lease, but that's only if the landlord chooses to accept the rent. But the question is about before accepting any rent, so the landlord could require the tenant to leave, perhaps under the holdover.

Alternatively, maybe the landlord could treat the holdover as a new lease. If the landlord does nothing, and the tenant continues, upon accepting rent, it becomes a year-to-year. But before accepting rent, the landlord could evict.

Wait, but the options don't seem to directly address this. Let me think again. The options are:

A: Double rent prorated monthly beyond three years.

B: Sue for damages due to rats.

C: Recovery of difference for a year.

D: Evict for non-payment.

E: Artist must move or pay for three years.

F: Court order to continue lease.

G: Pay for extermination.

H: Terminate lease.

I: Triple rent.

So, considering the situation, before accepting any rent, the landlord could evict the tenant for holding over. But none of the options directly say eviction for holdover. Option D talks about eviction, but it's for non-payment, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps another angle. At common law, when a tenant holds over, the landlord can recover possession (evict) without forfeiture since the lease has ended. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E because it's about the landlord requiring the tenant to leave or be responsible for another three years. But that would be if the landlord decides to treat the holdover as a new lease. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the landlord accepts the rent, it's a year-to-year tenancy. But before accepting, the landlord could choose to evict. So the available remedy before accepting rent would be eviction, which is option D, but D is for non-payment. Since the artist was paying, D isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the remedy available before she accepted the first payment after the initial term. So before she took any rent beyond the three years, the lease had ended, and the artist was holding over.

At common law, the landlord could choose to treat the tenant as a trespasser and evict them, or treat them as a new tenant. So the available remedy would be eviction.

Looking at the options, the closest is D, but it's for non-payment. So perhaps none of the options fit perfectly. Alternatively, maybe option E is the right one because if the tenant holds over, the landlord can elect to have them as a tenant for another term (like another year or three years?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to recall the common law rules. Upon expiration of a lease, if the tenant remains and the landlord accepts rent, it's a new tenancy. But if the landlord doesn't accept rent, they can evict for trespass.

So before accepting any rent, the landlord could evict. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is E because the landlord can require the tenant to leave or be bound for another term. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because if the lease was for three years, and the artist stayed beyond, the landlord could recover the difference between the lease price and market value for the additional period. But that would be if the artist breached the lease, but here the lease had ended.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the concept of a holdover tenant. When a lease ends, and the tenant stays, they become a holdover. The landlord can choose to evict them, treating them as trespassers, or do nothing and create a new tenancy (usually month-to-month or year-to-year, depending on the law). But before the landlord accepts any rent beyond the lease term, they can evict.

So the available remedy before accepting the first payment would be to evict the tenant for being a holdover. But looking at the options, the only eviction option is D, which is for non-payment, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because if the artist is holding over, the landlord can treat them as a new tenant for the same term as the original lease, which was three years. So the artist would be liable for another three years' rent if they leave early. So the landlord could require the artist to either move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.

That makes sense because under common law, a holdover can be treated as a new lease for the same term. So the landlord could choose to have the tenant on a new three-year lease. So the artist would be bound for another three years unless they leave immediately.

So the correct answer would be E.

The question revolves around the remedies available to a landlord when a tenant holds over after the expiration of a lease. In this scenario, the artist's three-year lease had ended, but the artist continued to occupy the premises and pay rent, which the retiree (landlord) accepted. The key issue is determining the remedy available to the landlord before she accepted the first rental payment after the lease term expired.

At common law, when a lease ends and the tenant remains in possession without a new agreement, the tenant becomes a holdover tenant. The landlord has two main options: (1) treat the tenant as a trespasser and evict them, or (2) accept the tenant's continued occupancy, which typically creates a new tenancy (often year-to-year). However, the question specifically asks about the remedy available before the landlord accepted the first rental payment after the lease expired.

Before accepting any rent beyond the initial three-year term, the landlord could choose to evict the artist for being a holdover tenant. However, none of the options explicitly mention eviction for holdover. The closest option is **E**, which states: "Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent." This aligns with the common law principle that a landlord can treat a holdover tenant as being on a new lease for the same term as the original lease (in this case, three years). If the tenant refuses to leave, they could be held liable for the entire three years' rent if they vacate early.

Other options are less applicable:  
- **D** (eviction for non-payment) is incorrect because the artist was paying rent.  
- **C** (recovery of the difference between the lease price and market value) is irrelevant because the lease had already expired.  
- **B**, **F**, **G**, **H**, and **I** do not address the specific remedy available before accepting rent after the lease term ended.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as it reflects the landlord's ability to treat the holdover tenant as bound for another three years unless the tenant vacates immediately.

**Answer: E**
