Question:

in-come elasticity of imports and interest elasticity of in-vestments?

Options:

A: Income elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of imports to a change in the price level, and interest elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of investment to changes in savings rates
B: Both income elasticity of imports and interest elasticity of investments measure the responsiveness of imports to a change in income
C: Both income elasticity of imports and interest elasticity of investments measure the responsiveness of exports to changes in income
D: Income elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of imports to a change in income, and interest elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of investment to a change in the interest rate
E: Income elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of imports to a change in exchange rates, and interest elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of investment to a change in inflation rates
F: Both income elasticity of imports and interest elasticity of investments measure the responsiveness of investment to a change in the interest rate
G: Income elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of imports to a change in interest rate, and interest elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of investment to a change in income
H: Interest elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of imports to a change in income, and income elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of investment to a change in the interest rate
I: Income elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of imports to changes in consumer confidence, and interest elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of investment to a change in government spending
J: Income elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of investment to a change in income, and interest elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of imports to a change in the interest rate

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about economics, specifically about income elasticity of imports and interest elasticity of investments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the correct definitions of these two economic measures. The options are from A to J, so I'll need to go through each one carefully.

First, I need to remember what income elasticity of imports means. From what I recall, elasticity in economics refers to how responsive one variable is to a change in another. Income elasticity, then, would be how imports change when income changes. So if income goes up, do imports go up a lot or a little? That makes sense because when people have more income, they might buy more goods, including imported ones.

Now, interest elasticity of investments. I think investments are influenced by interest rates. When interest rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, so businesses might invest less. So this elasticity measures how much investment changes when the interest rate changes. So if the interest rate goes up, investment might decrease.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Income elasticity of imports is about price level changes, which doesn't sound right. I thought it's about income, not prices. So probably A is wrong.

Option B: Both measure imports' responsiveness to income. Wait, no, because the second part is about interest elasticity of investments, not imports. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Both about exports and income. No, the question is about imports and investments, so C is out.

Option D: Income elasticity of imports responds to income changes; interest elasticity of investments responds to interest rate changes. That matches what I was thinking. Sounds correct.

Option E: Imports to exchange rates, investments to inflation. Not sure, but I thought exchange rates affect imports, but the term 'income elasticity' is about income, not exchange rates. So E might be incorrect.

Option F: Both about investments and interest rates. Doesn't fit because the first part is about imports.

Option G: Imports respond to interest rate, investments to income. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought. Income elasticity of imports is about income, not interest rates. So G is wrong.

Option H: It swaps the terms, talking about interest elasticity of imports. The question is about income elasticity of imports, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Imports related to consumer confidence, investments to government spending. Not matching, so I is wrong.

Option J: It flips imports and investments. Income elasticity of imports is about imports, not investments. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be D. It correctly states that income elasticity of imports is about income changes, and interest elasticity of investments is about interest rate changes.

The correct answer is:

D: Income elasticity of imports measures the responsiveness of imports to a change in income, and interest elasticity of investments measures the responsiveness of investment to a change in the interest rate.

Answer: D
