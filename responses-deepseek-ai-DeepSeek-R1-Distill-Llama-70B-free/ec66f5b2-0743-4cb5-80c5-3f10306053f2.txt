Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a dentist using a concave mirror. Hmm, I remember concave mirrors can be used for magnification. Let me think about what I know regarding mirrors and lenses in optics.

The question says the mirror has a radius of curvature of 4 cm. Wait, the radius of curvature R is twice the focal length, right? So R = 2f. That means the focal length f is R/2, which would be 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm. So f is 2 cm.

The dentist holds the mirror at a distance of 1.5 cm from the filling. So the object distance, which I think is denoted as u (or sometimes do in some textbooks), is 1.5 cm. Wait, but wait—wait, actually, in optics, the object distance is usually the distance from the object to the mirror. So if it's 1.5 cm, that's u.

I remember the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where v is the image distance. But wait, concave mirrors have focal lengths that are positive when the mirror is real, right? Or wait, no—wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get this straight.

In the case of mirrors, the sign conventions can be a bit tricky. For concave mirrors, the focal length is positive. So f is positive. The object distance u is positive if the object is in front of the mirror, which it is here because the dentist is using it to look at the tooth.

So plugging into the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

We know f is 2 cm, u is 1.5 cm. So let's plug in:

1/2 = 1/1.5 + 1/v.

Wait, wait, solving for 1/v:

1/v = (1/2) - (1/1.5).

Let me compute that. 1/1.5 is the same as 2/3, since 1.5 is 3/2, so reciprocal is 2/3. So 1/2 is 0.5, 2/3 is approximately 0.6667. So 1/2 minus 2/3 is 0.5 - 0.6667 = -0.1667. So 1/v = -1/6, so v = -6 cm.

Wait, negative image distance. In mirrors, the image distance being negative indicates that the image is virtual, right? Because for mirrors, if the image is behind the mirror, it's virtual, and the distance is negative. So that makes sense because the dentist's mirror is creating a virtual image.

Now, the magnification m is given by m = -v/u. So v is -6 cm, u is 1.5 cm.

So m = -(-6)/1.5 = 6/1.5 = 4. So the magnification is 4 times the object's size.

Wait, but wait! I'm a bit confused because concave mirrors can sometimes act as magnifying glasses. Oh wait, when the object is placed between the focal point and the mirror, the image is virtual and erect, and larger than the object. So in this case, since the object is at 1.5 cm, which is less than the focal length of 2 cm, that's exactly the case. So the image is virtual, upright, and magnified.

So the magnification is 4x. Looking at the options, option A is 4 times. So the answer should be A.

The problem involves a dentist using a concave mirror with a radius of curvature \( R = 4 \, \text{cm} \). The radius of curvature is related to the focal length \( f \) by \( R = 2f \), so \( f = \frac{R}{2} = 2 \, \text{cm} \). The object distance \( u \) is given as \( 1.5 \, \text{cm} \).

Using the mirror formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v},
\]

we substitute \( f = 2 \, \text{cm} \) and \( u = 1.5 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{1.5} + \frac{1}{v}.
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{1.5} = \frac{2}{3} \), we solve for \( \frac{1}{v} \):

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{4}{6} = -\frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, \( v = -6 \, \text{cm} \). The negative sign indicates that the image is virtual and located behind the mirror.

The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}.
\]

Substituting \( v = -6 \, \text{cm} \) and \( u = 1.5 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
m = -\frac{-6}{1.5} = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4.
\]

The magnification is 4 times the size of the object. Since the object is placed between the focal point and the mirror, the image is virtual, upright, and magnified, consistent with the result.

From the options, the correct answer is:

**A: 4 times the size of the object.**
