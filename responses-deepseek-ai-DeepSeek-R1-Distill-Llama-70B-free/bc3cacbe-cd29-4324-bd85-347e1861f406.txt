Question:

Circle Electronics can produce and sell x number of calculators a month. If it costs x^2 dollars to produce x number of calculators and each calculator is sold wholesale at $100, how many calculators should Circle Electronics produce monthly to maximize its profit?

B: 75
C: 80
D: 30
E: 25
F: 40
G: 100
H: 50

Okay, so I've got this problem about Circle Electronics and their calculator production. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that producing x calculators costs x squared dollars each month. So the cost function is C(x) = x². And each calculator is sold wholesale for $100, so the revenue from selling x calculators would be R(x) = 100x. 

Wait, right, profit is revenue minus cost. So Profit P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 100x - x². 

Now, to find the maximum profit, I remember from my basic calculus that I need to find the maximum point of this function. That means taking the derivative of P with respect to x and setting it to zero. 

Let me compute the derivative. The derivative of 100x is 100, and the derivative of x squared is 2x. So P'(x) = 100 - 2x. 

Setting P'(x) to zero gives 0 = 100 - 2x. Solving for x: 2x = 100 → x = 50. So the maximum profit occurs at x=50 calculators per month.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The profit function is a quadratic equation opening downward because the x² term is negative. So the vertex should give the maximum point. The vertex of a parabola ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a is -1 and b is 100. So x = -100/(2*(-1)) = 50. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be option H, which is 50. Let me check the options again to make sure. 

Options: A:110, B:75, C:80, D:30, E:25, F:40, G:100, H:50, I:60, J:90. Yep, H is 50. So I think that's the right choice.

To determine how many calculators Circle Electronics should produce monthly to maximize profit, we start by defining the profit function. The cost to produce \( x \) calculators is \( C(x) = x^2 \), and the revenue from selling \( x \) calculators at $100 each is \( R(x) = 100x \). Therefore, the profit function is:

\[
P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 100x - x^2
\]

To maximize profit, we take the derivative of \( P(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:

\[
P'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(100x - x^2) = 100 - 2x
\]

Setting \( P'(x) = 0 \):

\[
100 - 2x = 0 \implies 2x = 100 \implies x = 50
\]

This calculation shows that the maximum profit occurs when \( x = 50 \). Additionally, since the profit function \( P(x) = 100x - x^2 \) is a downward-opening parabola, the vertex confirms the maximum point. The vertex of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 100 \), so:

\[
x = -\frac{100}{2(-1)} = 50
\]

Thus, Circle Electronics should produce 50 calculators monthly to maximize its profit. The correct answer is:

H: 50

Answer: H
