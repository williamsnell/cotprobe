Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the melting point of ice under a pressure of 50 bar. Hmm, I remember that pressure affects the melting point of ice. I think it's related to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation or something like that. Wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used to determine the slope of the phase coexistence line in the P-T diagram, right? So for the melting of ice, which is a solid-liquid transition.

The equation I think is dP/dT = (L_fus) / (T (V_l - V_s)), where L_fus is the latent heat of fusion. Oh wait, but wait. No, the formula I remember is dP/dT = (S_l - S_s)/(V_l - V_s), since for a phase transition, the entropy change is delta S = Q/T. Oh right, because the latent heat L is T times delta S. So dP/dT is (delta S)/(delta V), where delta S is entropy change (which for fusion is L_fus/T) and delta V is the change in volume upon melting.

Wait, the problem gives me densities. So I can find the volume change. Let me note down the given data. The density of ice is 0.92 g/cm³, and water is 1.00 g/cm³. So since density is mass/volume, the volume for a given mass would be inversely proportional to density.

So for 1 gram, ice has volume 1/0.92 cm³, and water has 1/1.00 cm³. So the volume change when ice melts is V_water - V_ice. Wait, wait, no: when ice melts, it's going from solid to liquid. So delta V is V_liquid - V_solid. So if ice is less dense, then delta V is negative because V_liquid is smaller than V_solid. Wait, let me think. Ice is less dense, so for the same mass, its volume is larger. So when ice melts into water, the volume decreases. So delta V = V_water - V_ice. Since V_water is less than V_ice, delta V is negative.

So, for 1 gram of water, V_ice = 1/0.92 cm³ ≈ 1.087 cm³. V_water = 1 cm³. So delta V = 1 - 1.087 = -0.087 cm³/g. But wait, the units need to be consistent. I think the formula uses molar quantities, but maybe I can work with specific volumes (per gram) and then scale.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the molar volumes. Let me think. The molar mass of water is about 18.015 g/mol. So for 1 mole, ice's volume would be (1/0.92) * 18.015 cm³? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 gram is 1/18.015 moles. So for 1 mole, the volume would be (1 g / 0.92 g/cm³) * 18.015 g/mol = (18.015 / 0.92) cm³/mol ≈ 19.58 cm³/mol. Similarly, for water, it's (1 g / 1.00 g/cm³) * 18.015 g/mol = 18.015 cm³/mol.

So delta V is V_water - V_ice = 18.015 - 19.58 = -1.565 cm³/mol. Hmm, but wait, in the formula, I think delta V is V_liquid - V_solid, which is negative here because the liquid is denser.

Wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is (dP/dT) = (delta S)/(delta V). But delta S for melting (fusion) is positive because entropy increases when going from solid to liquid. So delta S is positive, delta V is negative, so dP/dT is negative. That would imply that as pressure increases, the melting temperature decreases, which I think is correct because ice melts under pressure, leading to a lower melting point.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the melting point at a higher pressure than 1 atm. So I need to calculate how much the melting point changes when pressure increases.

Wait, another approach: the Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be approximated as (dP)/(dT) = (L_fus)/(T (V_l - V_s)). But wait, I think the exact form is (dP/dT) = [ (S_l - S_s) ] / (V_l - V_s) ). Since for the process of melting at T, Q = T delta S = L_fus, so delta S = L_fus / T.

So, the equation becomes dP/dT = (L_fus / T) / (V_l - V_s).

Wait, then if I rearrange this, dT/dP = T (V_l - V_s) / L_fus.

Wait, but if I'm considering a change from P0 to P, and T from T0 to T, assuming that L_fus and delta V are constant, which is an approximation. So integrating both sides:

Integral from T0 to T of dT = Integral from P0 to P of [ T (V_l - V_s) / L_fus ] dP

Wait, but since T is involved on the right, this integral isn't straightforward. Hmm, perhaps I can make an approximation if the change in T is small. Or, alternatively, use the approximation that T is roughly constant (like T0) over the small pressure change. Because 50 bar is a significant change, but perhaps this approach is acceptable for an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

ΔT = (T0 * (V_l - V_s) / (L_fus)) * ΔP

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check the formula. Another version of the equation is:

ln(T) = (V_l - V_s)/L_fus * P + const

Wait, perhaps it's better to use an approximate linear relation, especially since the change in pressure is not extremely high. 50 bar is 50 times atmospheric pressure (1 bar is about 1 atm, so 50 bar is 50 atm). Hmm, but ice can have a significant change in melting point under pressure.

Wait, but I think the standard approach is to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the form:

dP/dT = (L_fus)/(T (V_l - V_s)).

Assuming that L_fus, V_l, V_s are approximately constant over the temperature and pressure ranges considered, we can rearrange and integrate.

So integrating from P0, T0 to P, T:

∫_{P0}^{P} dP = ∫_{T0}^{T} [L_fus / (T' (V_l - V_s))] dT'

Which gives:

(P - P0) = [L_fus / (V_l - V_s)] * ∫_{T0}^{T} (1/T') dT'

So:

(P - P0) = [L_fus / (V_l - V_s)] * ln(T / T0)

We can solve for T:

ln(T / T0) = (P - P0) * (V_l - V_s) / L_fus

So:

T = T0 * exp( (P - P0) * (V_l - V_s) / (L_fus) )

Wait, but wait, (V_l - V_s) is negative, as we found earlier. So, (P - P0) is positive (since we're going from P0=1 atm to P=50 bar, which is much higher), so the exponent would be negative, leading to a lower T than T0. That makes sense because higher pressure lowers the melting point of ice.

But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's collect all the necessary data.

First, P0 is 1 atm, which is 1 bar (since 1 atm ≈ 1.01325 bar, but for this problem, maybe they're approximating 1 atm as 1 bar). P is 50 bar. So ΔP is 49 bar.

Wait, no, if P0 is 1 bar (standard pressure), then P is 50 bar, so ΔP is 49 bar? Or wait, no, P is the final pressure, which is 50 bar, so the change is 50 - 1 = 49 bar? Or do I just take ΔP as 50 bar? Hmm, perhaps the equation should use the gauge pressure, the change from P0 to P, so ΔP is 49 bar.

Wait, no, the equation is (P - P0), which is 50 - 1 = 49 bar. But wait, another thought: the standard melting point is at P0 = 1 atm (or 1 bar). So when you increase pressure beyond that, the melting point decreases. So in the equation, (P - P0) is 49 bar.

Now, let's find the latent heat of fusion for ice. I remember that L_fus for water is about 333.55 J/g, or 334 J/g. Since molar mass is 18.015 g/mol, so per mole it's 334 * 18.015 ≈ 6010 J/mol. Alternatively, 6010 J/mol is about 6.01 kJ/mol.

Wait, let me check. Yes, the molar heat of fusion for ice is approximately 6.01 kJ/mol.

So L_fus = 6010 J/mol.

Next, the change in volume upon melting: V_l - V_s. Wait, V_l is the molar volume of liquid water, V_s is that of ice.

Earlier, I calculated V_ice as approximately 19.58 cm³/mol, V_water as 18.015 cm³/mol. So delta V is 18.015 - 19.58 = -1.565 cm³/mol.

Convert that to m³: 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so delta V = -1.565e-6 m³/mol.

Wait, but in the equation, the denominator is (V_l - V_s), which is negative, as we have here.

So putting it all together:

ΔP is 49 bar. But wait, in the equation, pressure should be in Pascals because the other terms are in SI units.

1 bar is 1e5 Pascals. So ΔP = 49 bar * 1e5 Pa/bar = 4.9e6 Pa.

So let's plug in the numbers:

ln(T/T0) = (ΔP) * (V_l - V_s) / (L_fus)

Wait, T0 is the normal melting point, which is 273.15 K (0°C).

So:

ln(T/273.15) = (4.9e6 Pa) * (-1.565e-6 m³/mol) / (6010 J/mol)

Compute the numerator:

4.9e6 * (-1.565e-6) = 4.9 * (-1.565) * 1e6 * 1e-6 = 4.9*(-1.565) = let's compute that.

4.9 * 1.565: 4 * 1.565=6.26, 0.9*1.565=1.4085; total 7.6685. But since one is negative, it's -7.6685.

Denominator: 6010 J/mol.

So:

-7.6685 / 6010 ≈ -0.001276.

So ln(T/273.15) ≈ -0.001276.

Exponentiating both sides:

T/273.15 = exp(-0.001276) ≈ 0.998725.

So T ≈ 273.15 * 0.998725 ≈ let's calculate.

273.15 * 0.998725. Hmm, 273.15 * 1 is 273.15. Subtract 273.15 * (1 - 0.998725) = 273.15 * 0.001275.

0.001275 of 273.15 is approximately 0.3486 K. So T ≈ 273.15 - 0.3486 ≈ 272.80 K.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, ln(T/T0) = (P - P0)*(V_l - V_s)/L_fus.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers.

Compute numerator: (P-P0)=49 bar =49e5 Pa.

Wait, no, earlier I thought 1 bar is 1e5 Pa, so 49 bar is 49e5 Pa, which is 4.9e6 Pa. Correct.

V_l - V_s = -1.565e-6 m³/mol.

So (P-P0)*(V_l - V_s) = 4.9e6 * (-1.565e-6) = 4.9*(-1.565) = let's compute that accurately.

4.9 * 1.565:

1.565 * 4 = 6.26.

1.565 * 0.9 = 1.4085.

Total 6.26 + 1.4085 = 7.6685. So 4.9 *1.565=7.6685.

But with the negative sign, it's -7.6685.

So then (P-P0)(V_l - V_s) = -7.6685 (unit: (Pa)(m³/mol) = J/mol, since 1 Pa m³ = 1 J).

So the numerator is -7.6685 J/mol.

Denominator is L_fus =6010 J/mol.

So the entire fraction is (-7.6685)/(6010) ≈ -0.001276.

So ln(T/T0) = -0.001276.

Exponentiating both sides:

T/T0 = e^(-0.001276) ≈ 1 - 0.001276 + ... since for small x, e^x ≈1+x. So e^-0.001276≈0.998725.

So T= T0 * 0.998725 = 273.15 * 0.998725.

273.15 * 0.998725 = ?

Compute 273.15 * 0.998725.

Let me compute 273.15 * 0.998725:

= 273.15 * (1 - 0.001275) = 273.15 - 273.15 * 0.001275.

Compute 273.15 * 0.001275:

Compute 0.001 *273.15=0.27315.

0.000275 *273.15 ≈ (0.0002 *273.15) + (0.000075 *273.15)

0.0002 *273.15 = 0.05463.

0.000075 *273.15≈0.02046125.

Total ≈0.05463 +0.02046125 = 0.07509125.

So 0.001275 *273.15 ≈0.27315 +0.075091 ≈0.348241.

So T≈273.15 -0.348241 ≈272.801759 K.

Looking at the options, option C is 272.8 K, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check all steps.

1. Compute delta V:

V_ice = 1/(0.92 g/cm³) = 1.087 cm³/g.

V_water = 1/(1.00 g/cm³) =1 cm³/g.

Molar mass 18.015 g/mol.

So V_ice per mole: 1.087 cm³/g * 18.015 g/mol ≈19.58 cm³/mol.

V_water: 1 cm³/g *18.015 g/mol=18.015 cm³/mol.

Delta V = 18.015 -19.58= -1.565 cm³/mol.

Convert to m³: 1 cm³=1e-6 m³, so delta V=-1.565e-6 m³/mol.

2. L_fus is 6010 J/mol. Correct.

3. dP =50 bar -1 bar=49 bar=49e5 Pa=4.9e6 Pa.

Wait, wait, no, 1 bar is 1e5 Pa, so 50 bar is 5e7 Pa? No, wait 1 bar=1e5 Pa, so 50 bar =50e5 Pa=5e6 Pa. Wait wait wait, no, that's a mistake.

Wait, 1 bar is 100,000 Pa (1e5 Pa). So 50 bar is 50 * 1e5 =5e6 Pa. So P-P0 is 5e6 -1e5 =4.9e6 Pa. Wait, no, because P0 is 1 bar (1e5 Pa), and P is 50 bar (5e6 Pa). So delta P is 5e6 -1e5 =4.9e6 Pa. Correct.

So (P-P0)*delta V = 4.9e6 Pa * (-1.565e-6 m³/mol) = 4.9e6 * (-1.565e-6) = (4.9 * (-1.565)) * (1e6 * 1e-6) = (-7.6685) *1= -7.6685 J/mol.

Divide by L_fus: -7.6685 /6010 ≈-0.001276.

So ln(T/T0)= -0.001276 → T≈273.15 * 0.998725≈272.8 K.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option C: 272.8 K.
