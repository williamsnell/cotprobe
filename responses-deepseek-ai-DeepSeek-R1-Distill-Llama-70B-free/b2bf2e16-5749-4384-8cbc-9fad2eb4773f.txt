Question:

A 36-year-old man comes to the office because of headaches that began 2 weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Refer him for consultation with an ophthalmologist
B: Begin a trial of a Î²-blocking medication
C: Begin a trial of an anti-inflammatory medication
D: Refer him for consultation with a psychiatrist
E: Prescribe over-the-counter analgesics for long term use
F: Refer him for consultation with a neurologist
G: Order CT scan of the head
H: Advise him to reduce stress and monitor symptoms

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's read through it carefully.

The patient is a 36-year-old man who's been having headaches for two weeks. The headaches are moderately severe and happen when he wakes up. They get better with over-the-counter pain meds. He has no history of headaches before. Oh, and he got promoted 8 months ago, which made him move. On physical exam, nothing's abnormal except the optic discs are blurred bilaterally.

Hmm, the blurred optic disc margins make me think of something with increased intracranial pressure. Like, papilledema maybe? Because when the pressure inside the skull goes up, it can cause the optic discs to swell. So what causes increased intracranial pressure?

Well, possible things include tumors, pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension), or other conditions. But wait, the patient is a 36-year-old man. Pseudotumor is more common in younger women, especially obese ones. So if he's male and 36, maybe it's something else.

His headaches started two weeks ago. They're worse in the morning, which is a classic sign of increased intracranial pressure because lying down for a long time can increase pressure. Also, the fact that they're relieved by OTC meds might not point towards a specific cause, but the key is the optic disc findings.

So, considering the possible causes, the most concerning is a space-occupying lesion, like a brain tumor. Or maybe aneurysm, but that usually presents with sudden severe headache.

He has a history of stress from a promotion and relocation. Stress can cause tension headaches, but those usually don't cause papilledema. So the presence of optic disc blurring suggests something more serious.

What about other symptoms? Not mentioned, but if there's increased ICP, he might have nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances, but those aren't noted here. Still, the physical finding is enough to warrant further investigation.

So the next step. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Refer to ophthalmologist. Well, maybe, but the issue is more neurological. The ophthalmologist might not be the first step unless we suspect an eye condition causing increased pressure.

Option B: Beta-blockers. Those are used for migraines or glaucoma. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option C: Anti-inflammatory. Maybe for something like sinusitis, but that usually comes with other symptoms like fever or congestion.

Option D: Psychiatrist. Maybe if it's stress or anxiety, but again, the optic disc finding suggests a physical cause.

Option E: More OTC meds. That's probably not the answer because the patient already uses them, and the concern is the physical finding.

Option F: Neurologist. That makes sense, but wait, before that, maybe imaging is needed.

Option G: CT scan of the head. Yeah, because if there's increased ICP, a CT would show possible causes like a tumor, hydrocephalus, etc. Although, sometimes an MRI is better, but CT is more immediate.

Option H: Reduce stress. Again, without addressing the physical signs, this might not be the best next step.

So, the key is the optic disc changes. Those could indicate a serious condition. So the next appropriate step is probably imaging. So the answer would be G: Order CT scan of the head.

Alternatively, maybe a referral to a neurologist (F) would come first, but often in such cases, the primary care doc might order imaging first. Also, if it's an emergency, like a tumor, you don't want to wait for a specialist.

Wait, but in some cases, the presence of papilledema would prompt an urgent evaluation. So maybe a CT scan is needed before anything else.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The patient is a 36-year-old man with a two-week history of moderately severe morning headaches relieved by over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches but experienced a recent promotion and relocation, which could contribute to stress. Physical examination reveals blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally, suggestive of papilledema, which is often associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This finding raises concern for serious conditions such as a brain tumor, pseudotumor cerebri, or other space-occupying lesions.

The presence of papilledema indicates the need for further investigation to rule out these potentially life-threatening conditions. While referral to a neurologist (Option F) may be appropriate, the immediate next step should be imaging to evaluate for increased ICP or structural abnormalities. A CT scan of the head (Option G) is a reasonable initial imaging choice due to its availability and ability to detect conditions like tumors or hydrocephalus.

Other options, such as referring to an ophthalmologist (Option A) or managing stress (Option H), do not address the urgent need to investigate the cause of increased ICP. Similarly, starting medications like beta-blockers (Option B) or anti-inflammatory agents (Option C) would not be appropriate without further diagnostic clarification. Prescribing long-term over-the-counter analgesics (Option E) is also insufficient given the concerning physical findings.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to order a CT scan of the head to evaluate for potential causes of increased intracranial pressure.
