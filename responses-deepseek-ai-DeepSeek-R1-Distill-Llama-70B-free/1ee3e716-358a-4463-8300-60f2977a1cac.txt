Question:

Four years ago the owner of a shopping center leased a store in the center for a 10-year term to a pharmacistfor use as a drugstore. The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it. The pharmacist brought an appropriate action to enjoin the new lease to the discount drugstore as a violationof the covenant in the pharmacist's lease. If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?

Options:

A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.
B: The owner's purchase and integration of the adjacent parcel of land effectively nullifies the existing covenant.
C: The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.
D: The discount drugstore on the adjacent parcel is not considered a 'new' lease, but a continuation of an existing one.
E: A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.
F: The owner has the right to lease any part of his property to any business, regardless of existing leases.
G: The pharmacist did not adequately express his concerns to the owner before initiating legal action.
H: A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.
I: The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shoppingcenter premises.
J: The covenant is not applicable as the shopping centers were considered separate entities at the time of the lease agreement.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a covenant in a lease. Let's read through it carefully.

So, four years ago, a shopping center owner leased a store to a pharmacist for 10 years. The lease says the owner won't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. The lease also describes the shopping center's boundaries, common areas, etc.

Then, last year, the owner bought an adjacent parcel. This parcel had a building with a supermarket and a discount drugstore. The prior owner's leases were assigned to the new owner. The owner then integrated both shopping centers, making them appear as one larger development.

Now, the pharmacist found out that the discount drugstore's lease is expiring, and the owner plans to renew it. The pharmacist is protesting, saying this violates the covenant. The court found for the owner, so I need to find why.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The covenant doesn't apply because the owner bought a property with an existing lease. But the covenant was about not leasing to another drugstore, so maybe the owner is still bound if they're re-leasing.

Option B: Integration nullifies the covenant. I don't think just integrating changes the covenant's terms unless the lease said something about modifications.

Option C: The drugstore was there when the pharmacist leased. Wait, noâ€”the pharmacist's lease was four years ago, and the owner bought the adjacent land last year. So the existing drugstore was already there when the owner bought it, but the pharmacist's lease was four years old. So when the owner took over, the drugstore was already present. Hmm.

Option D: It's a continuation, not a new lease. If the lease is expiring and the owner is entering a new lease, then it's a new lease, not a continuation. Unless they're just renewing under the same terms.

Option E: Covenant can't restrict land not owned by the covenantor. The covenant was in the pharmacist's lease, so the covenantor is the owner. The owner now owns both parcels, but the covenant was about the shopping center as described. The adjacent land was bought later, so maybe the covenant doesn't apply to it.

Option F: Owner can lease as they wish. But leases can have restrictions, so this seems too broad.

Option G: Pharmacist didn't express concerns. Not relevant to the covenant's enforceability.

Option H: Covenants restricting competition are invalid. Some covenants are enforceable, like in leases for nearby properties. I'm not sure if competition is against public policy here.

Option I: Covenant applies only to the original premises. The lease described the shopping center, which might not include the new parcel. So the covenant might only cover the original center, not the new part.

Option J: Shopping centers were separate at the time. So the covenant didn't cover the new parcel, which was separate then.

Wait, the lease described the shopping center by metes and bounds, which probably refers to the original center. When the owner bought the adjacent land, that was a separate parcel, so the covenant in the pharmacist's lease wouldn't cover it. So when the owner renews the lease for the discount store, it's in a different parcel, so the covenant doesn't apply.

So looking back, which option aligns with this? Option I says the covenant applies only to the original premises. Option J says they were separate entities at the time of the lease.

Wait, the lease's covenant was about "any part of the shopping center". The shopping center as described in the lease was the original one. The adjacent parcel was a separate shopping center at the time, so the covenant wouldn't cover it.

So the court would likely hold that the covenant doesn't apply to the new parcel because it wasn't part of the original shopping center described in the lease. So the correct answer would be option I or J.

Option I: The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as applying only to the original shopping center. That makes sense because the lease described a specific area, not the adjacent land which was later acquired.

Alternatively, option J says the centers were separate at the time, so the covenant doesn't apply. But the lease's description is key. Since the adjacent parcel wasn't part of the original lease's shopping center, the covenant doesn't cover it.

So I think the answer is either I or J. Between them, option I is about the covenant's application to the original premises, which fits because the new parcel wasn't part of the original description.

Alternatively, perhaps the covenant is interpreted to only apply to the original shopping center, so the owner can lease the adjacent parcel as it's a separate area.

So the most likely answer is I.

The correct answer is:

I: The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shopping center premises.

The lease described the shopping center by metes and bounds, which referred to the original premises. The adjacent parcel, purchased later, was not part of the original shopping center described in the lease. Therefore, the covenant does not apply to the new parcel, allowing the owner to lease it to the discount drugstore without violating the covenant.

Answer: I
