Question:

A department store at a large mall claims that over 60 percent of the mall’s visitors shop at that store. Let p = the proportion of the mall’s visitors who shop at the store. Which of the following pairs of hypotheses should be used to support this claim?

Options:

A: H0: p ≠ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60
B: H0: p < 0.60 and Ha: p = 0.60
C: H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p 0.60
D: H0: p > 0.60 and Ha: p 0.60
E: H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p = 0.60
F: H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p ≠ 0.60
G: H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60
H: H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p < 0.60
I: H0: p < 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60
J: H0: p > 0.60 and Ha: p < 0.60

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about setting up the correct pair of hypotheses to test a claim. The scenario is that a department store claims over 60% of the mall's visitors shop there. They define p as the proportion of visitors who shop at the store. 

So, the main thing is that the store's claim is that p is greater than 60%. I remember that in hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis (H0) is the default assumption, often representing the status quo or what's expected if there's no effect. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is what the researcher is trying to prove, usually the opposite of H0.

Wait, but how do I structure this? I think the null should usually be a statement of equality or less than/equal to. Because in most tests, we're trying to find evidence to reject H0. So if the claim is that p is more than 60%, then H0 should be that p is less than or equal to 60%, and Ha would be that p is greater than 60%. 

Looking at the options, let me go through each one quickly.

Option A: H0: p ≠ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60. Hmm, I don't think so because H0 is not a simple statement. Usually, H0 is a specific value or an inequality. Also, two-tailed tests have H0: p = something and Ha: p ≠, but this is a one-tailed test, so A might not be the right form.

Option B: H0: p < 0.60 and Ha: p = 0.60. No, because Ha here is a specific value, which doesn't make sense. Ha should be the opposite of H0. If H0 is p <, then Ha should be p ≥.

Option C: H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p 0.60. Wait, that's incomplete. Looks like a typo, maybe? So probably not the right choice.

Option D: H0: p > 0.60 and Ha: p 0.60. Also seems like a typo, and the structure is opposite of what we want. H0 should be the opposite of the claim.

Option E: H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p = 0.60. No, Ha should be p > 0.60, not a specific value. Because the claim is that p is more than 60%, not exactly 60%.

Option F: H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p ≠ 0.60. That's a two-tailed test, but the claim is one-tailed (specific direction), so F isn't right.

Option G: H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60. Oh, this looks correct! Because the store claims p is over 60%, so Ha is p > 0.60, and H0 is the opposite situation, p being less than or equal.

Option H: H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p < 0.60. That's the opposite of the claim, so no.

Option I: H0: p < 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60. Wait, this is similar to G. Oh, wait, I think I might have mixed up. H0 is p ≤, and Ha is p >. So G is H0: p ≤, Ha: p >. I is H0: p <, Ha: p >. Hmm, but usually, H0 includes equality. Like, in testing p > 0.6, H0 is p ≤ 0.6. So G is correct.

Options J: H0: p > 0.60 and Ha: p < 0.60. No, that reverses the claim.

So the correct pair should be H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60. Looking back, that's option G.

To test the claim that over 60% of the mall’s visitors shop at the department store, the hypotheses must be structured appropriately. The null hypothesis (H0) represents the default assumption, often the status quo or the opposite of the claim, while the alternative hypothesis (Ha) represents the claim being tested. Since the claim is that the proportion (p) is greater than 60%, H0 should be p ≤ 0.60, and Ha should be p > 0.60.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect because H0 is not a standard form (p ≠ 0.60) and Ha is p > 0.60.
- **B**: Incorrect because Ha is p = 0.60, which does not align with the claim of p > 0.60.
- **C**: Incomplete due to a typo, so not valid.
- **D**: Incorrect due to a typo and improper structure.
- **E**: Incorrect because Ha is p = 0.60, which does not match the claim.
- **F**: Represents a two-tailed test, which is not appropriate for this one-tailed claim.
- **G**: Correct, as H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60 align with the claim.
- **H**: Incorrect because it tests the opposite of the claim.
- **I**: Incorrect because H0 is p < 0.60, which does not include equality.
- **J**: Incorrect because it reverses the claim.

The correct answer is **G**: H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60.

Answer: G
