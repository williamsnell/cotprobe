Question:

A married couple sued a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract in failing to live up to promises he made regarding the couple's purchase of a residence. They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn't pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is admissible  even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.
B: The testimony is admissible because the agent's statement is considered a present sense impression.
C: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered hearsay within hearsay.
D: The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.
E: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by the broker's employee during the course and within the scope of employment.
F: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is not an exception to the hearsay rule.
G: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by a co-conspirator during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.
I: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.
J: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered a past recollection recorded.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The situation is a married couple suing a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract. They claim the broker promised them a $15,000 rebate at closing if they bought the home immediately. But at closing, the sellers didn't pay, saying they knew nothing about it. Now, in the trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents. This agent testified that he was in a meeting where he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected, saying it's hearsay.

The question is whether the court will admit this testimony. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall the hearsay rule and its exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, if the agent is testifying about what the broker said, that's an out-of-court statement the couple is using to prove the broker made the promise. That's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Now, the key is to figure out which exception, if any, applies here. The agent is the broker's employee, and he's testifying about what the broker said in a meeting with the buyers. 

I remember that statements made by a party's agent or employee concerning matters within the scope of their employment and during the employment can be admissible as a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2). This is an exception because admissions by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay.

So, in this case, the broker is the defendant. The agent is his employee. The statement was made during a meeting with the buyers, which seems to be within the scope of his employment as a real estate agent. Therefore, the broker's statement, as testified by the agent, would qualify as a party admission. 

Looking at the options, option D says it's admissible because it's a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment. That fits. 

Other options: Option E says it's admissible because it's a statement during employment. That's similar, but E doesn't cite the party admission rule specifically. Option B is about present sense impression, which requires the statement to be made contemporaneously with the event. I don't think that's the case here; it's more about a statement the broker made in a business meeting. 

Option H says it's inadmissible as hearsay, but if there's an exception, that wouldn't apply. So the correct answer should be D.

The court will most likely decide that the testimony is admissible because it qualifies as a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2). The broker's statement, as testified by his agent, was made during the course of employment and concerns a matter within the agent's scope, fitting the exception for admissions by a party-opponent.

Answer: D
