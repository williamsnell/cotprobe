Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the mass of an electron using results from Millikan and J.J. Thomson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says to combine Millikan's determination of the electron charge q and Thomson's measurement of q/m. Wait, so Millikan found the charge of an electron, right? And Thomson measured the charge-to-mass ratio. Oh right! Because Thomson did those cathode ray tube experiments.

So, the basic idea is that if I have the charge q and the ratio q/m, then I can find m by dividing q by (q/m). Wait, no, let's clarify. If q/m is known, then m would be q divided by (q/m). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me write this down.

Let me denote Millikan's charge as q, which is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. Thomson measured q/m (charge to mass ratio) as something else. So, if q is known and q/m is known, then mass m = q / (q/m ratio). Wait, no, wait. Wait, if I have q/m = some value, say r, then m = q/(r). Oh right, because if r = q/m, then m = q/r.

Wait, that makes sense. So mass m equals charge q divided by the charge-to-mass ratio (q/m). So m = q / (q/m) → m = (q) * (m/q) ) → which is m. Right.

But wait, what are the actual values here? I think Millikan's oil drop experiment gave the charge of the electron as approximately 1.6e-19 coulombs. And Thomson's experiment, I think he found the charge-to-mass ratio, which I remember is about 1.76e11 C/kg or something like that.

Wait, let me get the numbers right. Thomson's charge to mass ratio was around 1.76 × 10^11 C/kg. So using those two, we can compute m.

So m = q / (q/m). So substituting the numbers:

q is 1.6e-19 C.

q/m is 1.76e11 C/kg.

So m = (1.6e-19 C) / (1.76e11 C/kg) → let's compute that.

Calculating the exponents first: 1e-19 divided by 1e11 is 1e-30.

Then the coefficients: 1.6 / 1.76 is approximately 0.909 or so.

So 0.909e-30 kg. Wait, but 0.909 times 1e-30 is 9.09e-31 kg.

Wait, but wait, the exact numbers might be different. Let me think again. Did I get the charge right? Oh right, the elementary charge is 1.602176634e-19 C, but I think for the purpose of this problem, it's approximated as 1.6e-19.

And Thomson's ratio: I think the commonly accepted value from his experiments was about 1.7e11 C/kg. So if I plug in those numbers:

m = (1.6e-19) / (1.7e11) → let's compute numerator and denominator.

1.6 / 1.7 is approximately 0.941, and 10^-19 / 10^11 is 10^(-30), so 0.941e-30 kg. Which is 9.41e-31 kg.

Wait, but let me actually calculate it more accurately.

1.6 / 1.76 = let's compute that. 1.76 is 1.76, 1.6 divided by 1.76.

1.6 ÷ 1.76: 1.76 goes into 1.6 zero times. Let me write it as 16 ÷ 17.6. Hmm. 17.6 goes into 160 about 9 times (17.6 *9 = 158.4), so 0.909 approximately. So 0.909e-30 kg, which is 9.09e-31 kg.

Wait, so that's about 9.1e-31 kg.

Looking at the options, option I is 9.1 × 10^-31 kg, which would match this.

Wait, but wait, the actual accepted value for the electron mass is about 9.109e-31 kg, so this must be option I.

So the correct answer should be I.

To calculate the mass of the electron, we combine Millikan's determination of the electron charge \( q \) and J.J. Thomson's measurement of the charge-to-mass ratio \( q/m \). The charge of the electron \( q \) is approximately \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and Thomson's charge-to-mass ratio \( q/m \) is approximately \( 1.76 \times 10^{11} \, \text{C/kg} \).

The mass \( m \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
m = \frac{q}{q/m}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
m = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{1.76 \times 10^{11}}
\]

First, divide the coefficients: \( 1.6 / 1.76 \approx 0.909 \). Then, handle the powers of 10: \( 10^{-19} / 10^{11} = 10^{-30} \). Combining these results:

\[
m \approx 0.909 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg} = 9.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}
\]

This is consistent with the accepted value of the electron mass, which is approximately \( 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**I: \( 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: \( 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)**.
