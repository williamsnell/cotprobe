Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an elevator and figuring out the tension in the cables. Hmm, I remember from class that when dealing with elevators, tension is related to forces acting on the elevator. Let me think about what I know.

Elevators move because of the tension in the cables. When the elevator is moving up, the tension must be greater than the weight of the elevator. Oh right, Newton's laws come into play here. The basic idea is that the sum of the forces equals mass times acceleration.

So the forces involved are the tension pulling up and the weight pulling down. The equation should be T - mg = ma. So T equals m(g + a). Wait, but wait, is that right? Oh yeah, because if the elevator is accelerating upward, the net force is upward, so tension must support both the weight and provide the force for acceleration.

Now the question is asking which values we need to know. So, looking at the equation T = m(g + a), what variables do I need? I need the mass of the elevator (m), the acceleration (a), and of course, g, which is the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, the options don't list g as a variable, so I guess it's a known constant, so I don't need to know it as a given value for the problem. So in the options, they're asking which values of the elevator are needed. So I think the elevator's mass and acceleration would be necessary.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is mass and acceleration. That seems right. Let me double-check. Tension depends on the mass and how fast it's accelerating. Velocity, though, isn't part of the equation. Because whether it's moving at a certain speed or not doesn't affect the tension as long as the acceleration is the same. So velocity isn't needed.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Mass, velocity, and acceleration. Hmm, velocity is in there but I don't think it's needed. So probably not A.

Option G: Mass and acceleration. That's exactly what I need. So the correct answer should be G.

To determine the tension in the cables pulling an elevator, we use the equation derived from Newton's second law:  

\[
T - mg = ma \quad \text{or} \quad T = m(g + a)
\]

Here, \(T\) is the tension, \(m\) is the mass of the elevator, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity (a known constant), and \(a\) is the acceleration of the elevator. From this equation, it is clear that the values required are the mass (\(m\)) and the acceleration (\(a\)) of the elevator.  

Velocity (\(v\)) and height (\(h\)) are not directly relevant to calculating tension in this context, as tension depends only on the forces acting on the elevator, which are determined by its mass and acceleration. Friction is also not mentioned in the problem, so it is not a factor here.  

Among the options provided, the correct choice is **G: Mass and acceleration**, as these are the only values needed to calculate the tension in the cables.  

**Answer: G**
