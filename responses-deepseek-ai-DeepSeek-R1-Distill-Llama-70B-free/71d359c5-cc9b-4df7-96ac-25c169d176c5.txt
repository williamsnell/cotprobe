Question:

A chef owned a summer cottage on the lake. In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that

Options:

A: the neighbor's sand business constitutes a misuse of the easement.
B: the chef's improvements to the roadbed grant him additional rights to the easement.
C: the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could "tack on" their successive use periods.
D: an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.
E: the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.
F: because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.
G: the assistant has a legal right to improve the easement for his own use.
H: the assistant is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the neighbor's sand business.
I: the assistant can claim ownership of the easement due to his long-term use of the property.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about easements in property law. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is about a chef who owns a summer cottage and gets an easement from a neighbor. The easement is a right-of-way over a strip of land. The chef then improves the road by having it asphalted without telling the neighbor. Years later, the neighbor starts a sand business that damages the asphalt. Then, the chef sells the property to his assistant, and the neighbor blocks the road with barriers. The assistant is suing to remove the barriers, and we need to find his strongest argument.

First, I need to recall what an easement is. An easement is a right to use another's land for a specific purpose. It can be appurtenant (benefits a particular piece of land) or in gross (benefits a person or entity). Here, it's appurtenant because it's for access to the chef's property.

So the key points here are:

1. The easement was granted in writing, so it's an express easement, not implied or prescriptive.
2. The chef improved the road without the neighbor's consent. Does that affect the easement? I think the holder of an easement can make improvements, but maybe not if it's beyond the scope of the easement. But asphalting might just be maintaining or improving the road, which is within the right to use it.
3. The neighbor's sand business caused damage. Heavy hauling destroyed the asphalt. So, did the neighbor misuse the easement? Wait, the neighbor is the one who owns the servient estate (the land with the burden). The easement is for the chef (and now the assistant) to use. But the neighbor's use is on his own land. So maybe the neighbor's actions are a problem if they interfere with the easement.
4. The chef sold to the assistant. So the easement should transfer with the property. The assistant, as the new owner of the dominant estate, should have the same easement rights.

The neighbor erected barriers, blocking access. So the assistant is suing to remove them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The neighbor's sand business misuses the easement. Wait, the neighbor is the servient estate owner. The easement gives the chef (and assistant) the right to use the road. The neighbor's use of his own land (heavy hauling) might interfere with the easement. But the misuse would be if the neighbor was using the easement improperly. Wait, no, the neighbor isn't using the easement; he's using his own land, which has the easement burden. So perhaps the misuse is by the servient estate owner? Or maybe the neighbor's actions damaged the easement, but is that a misuse?

Alternatively, if the neighbor's actions interfere with the easement, that's a problem. But the question is about the assistant's argument against the neighbor blocking access, not about the damage from the sand business.

Option B: Chef's improvements grant additional rights. I don't think so. Making improvements doesn't expand the easement beyond what was granted. So probably not the strongest argument.

Option C: Privity of estate and tacking. Tacking is about adding periods of use for adverse possession or prescriptive easements. But this easement is express, so tacking isn't relevant here. So probably not.

Option D: Easement appurtenant is alienable, so conveyance passes the easement. Yes, because when the chef sold the property, the easement would automatically transfer to the assistant. So the assistant holds the easement now. This seems like a strong point.

Option E: Assistant is a bona fide purchaser protected even if unrecorded. Wait, the easement was created in writing, so I assume it was recorded. But if it wasn't, as a bona fide purchaser, the assistant would still be protected. But the question says the neighbor granted it in writing, but it doesn't say if it was recorded. However, the issue here is obstruction, not whether the easement exists. So if the easement is valid and transferred, the neighbor can't block it, regardless of recording. But I'm not sure if E is the strongest argument.

Option F: Easement created by implication, so prior use gives prescriptive. No, because the easement was created by an express grant in writing. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Assistant can improve the easement. While easement holders can make improvements, the issue is the neighbor blocking access, not the improvement. So G is about a different issue.

Option H: Compensation for damage from sand business. That's a separate issue, but the question is about removing the barriers, not compensation for damage.

Option I: Ownership of easement due to long use. No, because the easement was already granted; the assistant's use is under the existing easement, not acquiring ownership through use.

So focusing back, the main issue is that the neighbor is obstructing the easement. The assistant's strongest argument is that he holds the easement as the new owner of the dominant estate. So the easement is appurtenant and was transferred with the property.

Looking at the options, D says that an easement appurtenant is alienable, meaning it transfers with the dominant estate. So the assistant, as the new owner, has the easement.

Alternatively, option E might be relevant if the easement wasn't recorded, but the question says it was in writing, implying it was properly created, so recording might not be the issue. But the assistant's strongest argument is that the easement was properly transferred, making D the correct choice.

Wait, but another point: the assistant's claim is that the neighbor is obstructing the easement. The neighbor's argument might be that the easement was only for the chef, not the assistant. But since easements appurtenant transfer with the land, the assistant should have it. So D seems correct.

So the answer should be D.

The question revolves around an easement dispute between a chef, his assistant, and a neighbor. The chef obtained a written easement from the neighbor for a right-of-way, which was later transferred to the assistant when the chef sold the property. The neighbor obstructed the easement, and the assistant is now seeking to remove the barriers. The strongest argument for the assistant lies in the nature of easements appurtenant, which automatically transfer with the dominant estate when it is sold.

Key points:
1. The easement was granted in writing, making it an express easement appurtenant.
2. Easements appurtenant are alienable, meaning they transfer with the dominant estate when it is sold. Thus, when the chef sold the property to the assistant, the easement rights automatically passed to the assistant.
3. The neighbor's obstruction of the easement violates the assistant's rights as the new holder of the easement.

Analysis of the options:
- **A**: The neighbor's sand business causing damage is a separate issue and does not directly address the obstruction.
- **B**: Improvements by the chef do not grant additional rights beyond the easement.
- **C**: Tacking is irrelevant here because the easement is express, not prescriptive.
- **D**: Correct. Easements appurtenant are alienable and transfer with the dominant estate, giving the assistant the right to use the easement.
- **E**: While bona fide purchaser protections are relevant if the easement was unrecorded, the question implies the easement was properly created in writing.
- **F**: The easement was express, not implied, so this is incorrect.
- **G**: Improvement rights are not the central issue here.
- **H**: Compensation for damage is a separate claim and does not address the obstruction.
- **I**: The assistant does not claim ownership through use but through the transfer of the easement.

The strongest argument is that the easement appurtenant is alienable and transferred with the property, making **D** the correct answer.

Answer: D
