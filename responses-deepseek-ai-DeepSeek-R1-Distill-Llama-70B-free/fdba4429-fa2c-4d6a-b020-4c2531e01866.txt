Alright, so I've got this problem here about finding the inverse of a group element in Z_7. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I remember that in modular arithmetic, the inverse of an element a is a number b such that (a*b) mod n equals 1. 

Wait, but the problem gives me a pair of numbers, (3,5) and (4,6). Oh wait, no, maybe that's a matrix? Because in group theory, especially in the context of inverses, matrices are common. So perhaps this is a 2x2 matrix where the first row is [3,5] and the second row is [4,6]. And we're working in Z_7, which means all operations are modulo 7.

So the task is to find the inverse of this matrix in the general linear group GL(2,Z_7). The inverse matrix M should satisfy M * original matrix ≡ identity matrix mod 7. The question specifically asks for M[0][1], which is the element in the first row and second column of the inverse matrix.

First, I need to recall how to find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix modulo a prime. The formula for the inverse of a matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is (1/det) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]], where det is the determinant. But all operations are modulo 7, so I need to compute the determinant first, find its inverse modulo 7, and then apply the formula.

Let me compute the determinant. The determinant of the matrix [[3,5],[4,6]] is (3*6) - (5*4) = 18 - 20 = -2. But wait, in Z_7, -2 is equivalent to 5 because 7-2=5. So det ≡5 mod7.

Now, I need the inverse of 5 mod7. So I'm looking for a number x such that 5x ≡1 mod7. Let's try x=3: 5*3=15→15 mod7 is 1. Yes, so the inverse of 5 is 3 in Z_7.

So the inverse matrix is (1/5)*[[6, -5], [-4, 3]]. Since 1/5 is 3 in Z_7, each element gets multiplied by 3.

Let me compute each element:

First, the inverse matrix before scaling by 3 is [[6, -5], [-4, 3]].

Scaling each element by 3:

First row:
6*3 = 18 mod7. 18 divided by7 is 2*7=14, 18-14=4 → 4 mod7.
-5*3 = -15 mod7. Let's find what -15 mod7 is. 7*2=14, 15-14=1 → -15 mod7 is same as -1 mod7, which is 6.

Second row:
-4*3 = -12 mod7. 12 mod7 is 5, so -12 mod7 is 7-5=2.
3*3=9 mod7 is 2.

So putting it all together, the inverse matrix is:

[4,6]
[2,2]

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because I might have made a mistake in scaling.

Wait, the inverse matrix formula is (1/det) multiplied by [[d, -b], [-c, a]]. So the determinant inverse is 3, so each element in the matrix [[6, -5], [-4, 3]] is multiplied by 3.

So let's compute each element again:

First row, first element: 6 *3 =18 mod7=4.

First row, second element: (-5)*3= -15 mod7. 15/7 is 2, remainder 1. So 15 mod7 is 1, so -15 mod7 is -1, which is 6 in Z7.

Second row, first element: (-4)*3= -12 mod7. 12 mod7 is 5, so -12 mod7 is -5 mod7, which is 2 (since 7-5=2).

Second row, second element: 3*3=9 mod7=2.

So the inverse matrix M is:

[4, 6]
[2, 2]

Wait, but the question is asking for M[0][1], which is the element in the first row and second column. So that's 6.

Looking at the options, option J is 6. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up rows and columns. Oh wait, in the inverse matrix, the [0][1] is indeed the first row, second column, which is 6. So yeah, that's correct.

To find the inverse of the matrix \((\begin{smallmatrix}3 & 5 \\ 4 & 6\end{smallmatrix})\) in \(Z_7\), we use the formula for the inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix:

\[
M^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(M)} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix},
\]

where \(\det(M) = ad - bc\). For the given matrix:

1. Compute the determinant:
   \[
   \det(M) = (3 \cdot 6) - (5 \cdot 4) = 18 - 20 = -2.
   \]
   In \(Z_7\), \(-2 \equiv 5\).

2. Find the inverse of \(\det(M)\) in \(Z_7\). The inverse of \(5\) modulo \(7\) is \(3\), since \(5 \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

3. Apply the inverse formula:
   \[
   M^{-1} = 3 \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 6 & -5 \\ -4 & 3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. Scale each element of the matrix by \(3\) modulo \(7\):
   - First row: \(6 \cdot 3 = 18 \equiv 4 \mod 7\), \(-5 \cdot 3 = -15 \equiv 6 \mod 7\).
   - Second row: \(-4 \cdot 3 = -12 \equiv 2 \mod 7\), \(3 \cdot 3 = 9 \equiv 2 \mod 7\).

Thus, the inverse matrix is:

\[
M^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The question asks for \(M[0][1]\), which is the element in the first row and second column of \(M^{-1}\). This value is \(6\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 6**
