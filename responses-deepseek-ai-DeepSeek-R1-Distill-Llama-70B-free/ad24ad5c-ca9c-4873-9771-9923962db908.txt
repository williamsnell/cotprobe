Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy question about the temperature of the universe and how galaxy distances have changed. Let me break it down.

The question says the current temperature of the universe's microwave background is about 3 K. And it's asking what the situation was like when the temperature was 12 K. The options are about how distant galaxies were back then compared to now.

Hmm, I remember that the universe has been expanding, so as it expands, it cools down. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature is a key indicator here. The CMB temperature is inversely related to the scale factor of the universe. The scale factor tells us the relative size of the universe over time.

So the scale factor a(t) relates to the universe's size at a given time t compared to now (a0). Temperature and scale factor are inversely proportional because as the universe expands, the photons' wavelengths stretch, making the temperature drop. The formula I think is T ∝ 1/a.

Right now, T is 3 K. So when the universe was hotter, like 12 K, it was smaller. How does the scale factor relate the two temperatures?

Let me calculate the ratio. Current T is 3 K, past T is 12 K. So the ratio T_past / T_present is 12/3 = 4. Since T is inversely proportional to a, a_past = a_present / 4. Wait, no, because T ∝ 1/a, so a ∝ 1/T. So a_past = a_present * (T_present / T_past) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If T1 is 3 K now (a1 is scale factor now, which we can consider as a1 = 1), and T2 is 12 K in the past, then the scale factor a2 when T was 12 K would be a2 = T1 / T2 * a1. So a2 = (3 K) / (12 K) ) * 1 = 0.25. So a2 is 0.25 times a1, meaning the universe was a quarter of its current size.

But how does the scale factor relate to the distance between objects? I think the scale factor is proportional to the distance. So if the universe was a quarter the size, the distances between galaxies would have been a quarter of what they are today, right?

Wait, but wait another thing. Are we talking about the distance at that time or the light travel distance now? I'm a bit confused. The scale factor a(t) relates to the size at time t. So when the universe was hotter, a(t) was smaller. So galaxies were closer together because the universe was smaller.

The question is asking about the typical objects in the universe, like galaxies, when the temperature was 12 K. So if a(t) was 0.25 of today's, then galaxies were a quarter as distant as they are today. Because the universe has expanded, so their separation would be proportionally smaller.

Looking at the options, option C says "one-quarter as distant as they are today." That seems to fit.

But wait, another thought: the universe's expansion isn't linear. But in terms of the scale factor, it's a direct proportion. So if a is 0.25, distances were 0.25 times current. So galaxies were a quarter as far apart as they are now.

Wait, but let me think again. If the scale factor is a, then at a certain time, the physical distance is a times the comoving distance. So when a was 0.25, the physical distance was 0.25 times the comoving distance. So for the same comoving distance today, that would mean the object was closer in the past.

So yes, when the temperature was 12 K, galaxies were a quarter as distant as they are today. So the answer should be option C.

But let me check. Another approach: the temperature of the CMB is inversely proportional to the scale factor (T ∝ 1/a). So when T was 4 times higher (12 K vs 3 K), the scale factor a was 1/4 of today's. So the universe was 1/4 in size. So the distances between objects were 1/4 as much as they are now.

Yes, that's consistent. So the correct answer is C.

The temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to its scale factor, as described by the relationship \( T \propto \frac{1}{a} \). Currently, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is 3 K, while in the past, when the temperature was 12 K, the universe was smaller. To determine the scale factor at that time, we calculate the ratio of temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{past}}}{T_{\text{present}}} = \frac{12}{3} = 4.
\]

Since \( T \propto \frac{1}{a} \), the scale factor at the time when the temperature was 12 K is:

\[
a_{\text{past}} = \frac{a_{\text{present}}}{4}.
\]

This means the universe was one-quarter of its current size, and the distances between galaxies were correspondingly one-quarter of what they are today. Therefore, typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were one-quarter as distant as they are today.

The correct answer is **C: one-quarter as distant as they are today**.
