Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the free energy change for compressing mercury. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me the molar volume of mercury at P=0 and T=273 K, which is 14.72 cm³/mol. Wait, I need to convert that into m³/mol because the units for pressure and compressibility are in meters and Newtons. Oh right, 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 14.72 cm³ is 14.72e-6 m³/mol. Got it.

The compressibility beta is given as 3.88e-11 m²/N. And it's assumed to be constant over the pressure range. So, the formula I remember for free energy change when a substance is compressed is something like ΔG = (volume change) * pressure, but wait, that's probably not exactly right. Oh wait, in thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy change for a process under constant temperature and pressure is given by ΔG = VΔP when the volume is constant, but that's probably not the case here because we're compressing the material, so volume changes.

Wait, no, another approach. I remember that for solids and liquids, the volume change with pressure can be approximated using the compressibility. The formula for the change in volume when pressure is applied is ΔV = -V0 * beta * P, where V0 is the molar volume at zero pressure, beta is the compressibility, and P is the applied pressure. But wait, the free energy change is the work done during compression, which in this case would be the integral of P dV from initial to final state. Alternatively, since beta is small, maybe we can use an approximation.

Wait, let me think again. The work done on the system when you compress it is the integral from P=0 to P of P dV. But since V changes with P, it's not straightforward. However, for small changes, maybe we can model it using the definition of compressibility. The compressibility beta is defined as -(1/V)(dV/dP) at constant temperature. So, dV = -V beta dP.

Wait, so the integral for work would be the integral from 0 to P of P dV. Substituting dV = -V beta dP, so the integral becomes the integral from 0 to P of P * (-V beta) dP. But wait, V is also a function of P. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can make an approximation. Since beta is very small, the change in volume is small, so V is approximately V0. So, V ≈ V0 over the pressure range. That would simplify the integral.

So, the work done (which is the free energy change ΔG at constant temperature and assuming reversible process) would be approximately the integral from 0 to P of P * (-V0 beta) dP. Let's see:

ΔG = integral from 0 to P of V dP, but wait, no, because in the work done on the system, it's P dV. But for expansion, work is P_ext dV, but for compression, it's negative. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, another approach: For a solid or liquid, the approximate expression for ΔG when compressed is ΔG ≈ V0 * beta * P² / 2. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think about the expansion.

Wait, the change in volume is ΔV = V0 - V = V0 beta P (since ΔV = -V0 beta P, because at higher pressure, volume decreases). So, the work done on the system during compression is the integral of P dV from V0 to V.

But since dV = -V0 beta dP (from beta = - (1/V)(dV/dP)), so:

ΔG = integral from 0 to P of P dV = integral (0 to P) P (-V0 beta) dP.

So that's:

ΔG = - V0 beta ∫ P dP from 0 to P.

Which would be:

ΔG = - V0 beta [ (P^2)/2 ] evaluated from 0 to P.

So, ΔG = - V0 beta (P²/2 - 0) ) = - V0 beta P² / 2.

Wait, but work done on the system is positive, so maybe I should take the absolute value. Or perhaps I messed up the sign. Because when you compress a substance, the system is doing work on the surroundings, or the surroundings are doing work on the system? Wait, when you compress, the system's volume decreases, so the surroundings are doing work on the system. So, the work done by the system is negative, and the work done on the system is positive.

Wait, but in the integral, when we compute ∫ P dV from V0 to V (V < V0), the integral is negative because dV is negative. So the work done by the system is negative, implying work is done on the system, so ΔG is positive.

But wait, let me clarify. The Gibbs free energy change at constant temperature and pressure is given by ΔG = VΔP when volume is constant, but that's only an approximation. Alternatively, for small changes, we can model it as ΔG ≈ V0 ΔP, but that might not be accurate here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

ΔG = (1/2) V0 beta P^2.

Wait, that would be dimensionally correct? Let's see: beta has units of m²/N, P is in N/m², so beta*P^2 would be (m²/N)*(N²/m^4) )= N/m². Then V0 in m³/mol, so V0 * beta * P² would have units m³/mol * (N/m²) )= (m³ * N) / (mol * m²) )= (N·m)/(mol), which is joules per mole. So that makes sense.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me ΔG = - (V0 beta P^2)/2. But that would be negative, which doesn't make sense because compressing the system should require work, so ΔG should be positive. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in signs.

Let me go back. The compressibility beta is defined as beta = - (1/V) (dV/dP) at constant T. So, dV = - V beta dP. So when pressure increases, volume decreases, which makes sense.

So, when we compute the work done on the system, which is the integral from 0 to P of P dV.

Wait, but dV is negative because as P increases, V decreases. So the integral would be negative, implying that the work done by the system is negative, which means work is done on the system, so the free energy change is positive.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the work as W = ∫ (from V0 to V) P dV.

But since V decreases, V < V0, so the limits would be from V0 to V, and dV is negative. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express in terms of pressure.

We have:

ΔV = V0 - V = V0 β P.

So, V ≈ V0 (1 - β P). But for small β P, this is approximately true.

Wait, the work done on the system during compression is the integral of P dV from V0 to V.

But dV = - V0 β dP, so:

W = ∫ (from P=0 to P) P * dV = ∫ P (- V0 β dP) = - V0 β ∫ P dP from 0 to P.

So that's:

W = - V0 β (P²/2) 

Wait, so the work done on the system is negative? That can't be. Because when you compress something, you're doing work on it, so the work should be positive.

Ah, perhaps I'm getting the sign wrong. Let me think. When the system is compressed, its volume decreases, so dV is negative. So the work done by the system is P_ext * dV, which would be negative. But the work done on the system would be negative of that, so positive.

Wait, perhaps I should define W as the work done on the system, so:

W = ∫ (from V0 to V) P_ext dV.

But P_ext is equal to the pressure P (assuming it's a reversible process). So:

W = ∫ P dV.

But dV is negative, so the integral is negative. But that would imply that the system is doing work on the surroundings, which isn't correct because we're compressing the system, doing work on it.

Wait, maybe I messed up the sign in the definition of work. Let me check: Work done by the system is ∫ P dV. When the system expands (dV positive), it does positive work. When it's compressed (dV negative), it does negative work, meaning work is done on the system, which is positive. So, W (work done on the system) would be negative of the integral of P dV, because the system is doing negative work.

Wait, perhaps it's better to define W as the work done on the system as:

W = - ∫ P dV.

Because when the system's volume decreases (dV negative), the integral P dV is negative, so W becomes positive.

So, W = - ∫ (V0 to V) P dV.

But I don't have an expression for P in terms of V yet. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of P.

So, from beta = - (1/V) (dV/dP), rearranged:

dV = - V beta dP.

But V is changing with P, so if we assume V ≈ V0 (since beta is small), then dV ≈ - V0 beta dP.

So, the integral becomes:

W = - ∫ (V0 to V) P dV = - ∫ (0 to P) P (- V0 beta dP) )

Wait, that would be:

W = V0 beta ∫ (0 to P) P dP = V0 beta * (P²/2).

Which is positive, as expected.

So, the work done on the system (and thus the free energy change, assuming ΔG = W) is:

ΔG = (V0 beta P²) / 2.

Wait, but wait, isn't the formula for the work done when you have a varying P? Or is this an approximation?

Alternatively, I might be confusing this with the expression for energy. Let me make sure.

From thermodynamics, the work done on the system during a compression is the integral of P dV, but since P is the external pressure, for a reversible process, P is equal to the internal pressure. So, for the work done on the system:

W = - ∫ (from V0 to V) P dV.

But since we can express P as a function of V, but that might not be straightforward. However, using the relation dV = - V0 beta dP (assuming V ≈ V0), we can write:

W = - ∫ (V0 to V) P dV = - ∫ (0 to P) P (- V0 beta dP) ) 

Which simplifies to:

W = V0 beta ∫ (0 to P) P dP = V0 beta (P²/2)

So, yes, that would make ΔG = V0 beta P² / 2.

Wait, but wait, the units. Let me check again.

V0 is in m³/mol, beta in m²/N, and P in N/m².

So, (m³/mol) * (m²/N) * (N²/m⁴) )= (m^5 * N) / (mol * N * m^4) )= m/(mol), which is N·m/mol. So, the units are correct, giving energy per mole.

So, plugging in the values:

V0 = 14.72 cm³/mol = 14.72e-6 m³/mol.

Beta = 3.88e-11 m²/N.

P is given as 3000 kg/cm². Wait, I need to convert that into Pascals (N/m²).

1 kg/cm² is equal to 98,063.8 Pa (since 1 kg-f = 9.80638 N, and 1 cm² = 1e-4 m², so 9.80638 N / 1e-4 m² = 98063.8 N/m²).

So 3000 kg/cm² = 3000 * 98063.8 Pa ≈ 2.941e7 Pa.

Wait, let me calculate that accurately. 3000 * 98,063.8:

3000 * 98,063.8 = 294,191,400 Pa, which is approximately 2.941914e8 Pa? Wait, no, wait 98,063.8 * 3000.

Wait, 98,063.8 * 3 = 294,191.4, so 3000 kg/cm² is 294,191,400 Pa, which is 2.941914e8 Pa.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1 kg/cm² = 9.80638e4 Pa (since 1 atm is about 101325 Pa, and 1 atm ≈ 10^5 Pa, and 1 kg/cm² is about 0.9806 atm, but exact value is 1 kg/cm² = 98063.8 Pa).

So 3000 kg/cm² = 3000 * 98063.8 = 294,191,400 Pa = 2.941914e8 Pa.

So P = 2.941914e8 N/m².

Putting it all together:

ΔG = (V0 * beta * P²) / 2.

Plugging in the numbers:

V0 = 14.72e-6 m³/mol.

Beta = 3.88e-11 m²/N.

P = 2.941914e8 N/m².

So, compute each part step by step.

First, calculate P squared:

P² = (2.941914e8)^2 = approx (2.94e8)^2 = 8.6436e16 (N²/m^4).

Then, V0 * beta = 14.72e-6 m³/mol * 3.88e-11 m²/N.

Multiply them: 14.72e-6 * 3.88e-11 = let's compute that.

14.72 * 3.88 ≈ 57.0816. Then the exponent is 1e-6 * 1e-11 = 1e-17.

So, 57.0816e-17 m^5/(N·mol).

Wait, m³ * m² = m^5. So the product is 57.0816e-17 m^5/(N·mol).

Now multiply by P² which is 8.6436e16 N²/m^4:

So,

57.0816e-17 m^5/(N·mol) * 8.6436e16 N²/m^4 = 

Multiply the coefficients: 57.0816 * 8.6436 ≈ let's compute that.

57 * 8 is 456, 57 * 0.6436 ≈ 57 * 0.6 is 34.2, 57 * 0.0436≈2.48, so total ≈34.2 +2.48≈36.68. So total ≈456 +36.68≈492.68. But wait, more accurately:

57.0816 * 8.6436: Let's compute 57 * 8 = 456, 57 * 0.6436 ≈ 57*(0.6 + 0.0436) = 34.2 + 2.4852 = 36.6852. Then 0.0816 * 8.6436 ≈ approx 0.703. So total is 456 + 36.6852 + 0.703 ≈ 493.388.

Exponents: 1e-17 * 1e16 = 1e-1.

So the product is 493.388e-1 m^(5-4) N^(2-1) / mol.

Wait, m^5 * N^2 / m^4 = m^(5-4) * N^(2-1) = m * N.

Wait, N is kg·m/s², so m*N is kg·m²/s², which is energy. So the units are correct (energy per mole).

So, 493.388e-1 = 49.3388 m·N/mol = 49.3388 N·m/mol = 49.3388 J/mol.

Wait, but wait, this is before dividing by 2, right? Because the formula is (V0 beta P²)/2.

So, 49.3388 J/mol divided by 2 is approximately 24.6694 J/mol.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options are all in the thousands of Nm/mol, which is kJ/mol. Oh wait, wait, I must have made a mistake in calculation. Because the numbers are way off. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the numbers. Let's compute each part carefully.

V0 =14.72 cm³/mol =14.72e-6 m³/mol.

Beta=3.88e-11 m²/N.

P=3000 kg/cm² = 3000 * 98063.8 Pa = 2.9419e8 Pa.

Compute V0 * beta: 14.72e-6 *3.88e-11.

14.72e-6 is 1.472e-5.

3.88e-11 is 3.88e-11.

Multiply 1.472e-5 * 3.88e-11 = (1.472 *3.88) * 1e-16.

1.472 *3.88: Let's compute 1.4 *3.88=5.432, 0.072*3.88≈0.27936. Total≈5.71136.

So, 5.71136e-16 m^5/(N·mol).

Now multiply by P^2: (2.9419e8)^2 = ?

2.9419e8 squared: Let me compute 2.9419e8 * 2.9419e8.

(2.94e8)^2 = (2.94)^2 *1e16 = 8.6436e16.

So, P^2=8.643
