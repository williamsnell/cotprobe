Okay, so I have this question about Paul Revere's father's original name. I'm a bit fuzzy on American history, but I'll try to think it through.

Paul Revere is a famous figure from the American Revolution. I remember he was an artist and a patriot, known for his midnight ride. But the question is about his father's name. The options are A through J.

I think Paul Revere's father might have been an immigrant. Maybe from France? Because Paul Revere's last name sounds French. I've heard that some Huguenots came to America, and they might have changed their names upon arrival.

Looking at the options, E is Pierre Revere. Pierre is French for Peter. So maybe the father was originally Pierre, and then it got anglicized to Peter or Paul? Wait, no, Paul is English. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. I remember that some names were changed at Ellis Island or upon immigration. But wait, the Revere family was in America before Ellis Island, which was later. So maybe the name was changed upon arrival in the colonies.

I've heard that Apollos Rivoire came to America and changed his name to Revere. So Rivoire is a French name. Let me see the options. Option I is Apollos Rivoire. That sounds right because Rivoire is a French surname, and Apollos is a given name.

So if the father's original name was Apollos Rivoire, then he probably changed it to Paul Revere Sr. But wait, no, Paul Revere was the son. So the father would have been Apollos Rivoire before changing his name to Revere. So the original name was Apollos Rivoire.

Looking at the options, option I is Apollos Rivoire, which matches what I'm thinking.
