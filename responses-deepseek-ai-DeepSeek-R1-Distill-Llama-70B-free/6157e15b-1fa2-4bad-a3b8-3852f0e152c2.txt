Answer:
    <think>


To solve the expression \(-\dfrac{1}{-3} \cdot \cfrac{1}{~\frac{1}{-3}~}\), let's break it down step by step.

First, simplify each part of the expression:

1. The term \(-\dfrac{1}{-3}\) simplifies as follows:
   \[
   -\dfrac{1}{-3} = \dfrac{-1}{-3} = \dfrac{1}{3}
   \]

2. The term \(\cfrac{1}{~\frac{1}{-3}~}\) simplifies as follows:
   \[
   \cfrac{1}{~\frac{1}{-3}~} = -3
   \]

Now, multiply the simplified terms:
\[
\dfrac{1}{3} \cdot (-3) = -1
\]

Thus, the final answer is \(-1\).

The correct option is **H**.
