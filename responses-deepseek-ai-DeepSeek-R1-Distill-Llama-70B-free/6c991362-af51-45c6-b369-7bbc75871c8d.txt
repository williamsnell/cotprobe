Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about a man and a woman who are partners in an automobile leasing agency. The man has been embezzling money, and the woman gets suspicious. She tells him she wants to audit the books, which would likely expose his embezzlement. Panicking, the man hires a professional killer to murder her for $10,000. The woman dies in a car crash arranged by the killer.

The question is asking, in addition to embezzlement, what other crimes could the man be convicted of. The options are A through J, each listing different combinations of crimes.

First, let me list out the possible crimes that might apply here. The man's actions include embezzlement, which is already established. Then he hires someone to kill his partner. So, what crimes are involved in that?

I remember that when someone hires another person to commit a crime, like murder, they can be charged with conspiracy. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and some overt act in furtherance of that agreement. Here, the man and the killer agreed to commit murder, and they took steps (hiring, arranging the crash) which would satisfy the overt act.

Then there's solicitation. Solicitation is when someone asks or encourages another to commit a crime, with the intent that the crime be committed. So when the man approached the killer and offered him money to kill the woman, that's solicitation to commit murder.

Additionally, the woman's death occurred, so murder is another charge. But wait, is the man guilty of murder? I think under the law, if you hire someone to kill another person, you're guilty of murder as well, possibly under the theory of vicarious liability or as a co-conspirator. So that's another charge.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. That seems to cover all the points. But wait, I thought the man is already guilty of embezzlement, but the question is asking what additional crimes beyond that. So the answer would include conspiracy, solicitation, and murder.

But wait, let me think again. The question says "in addition to embezzlement," so embezzlement is already a given, and we're looking for the others.

So, the options are:

A: Conspiracy and solicitation.

B: Solicitation and conspiracy.

C: Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

D: Embezzlement and solicitation.

E: Murder.

F: No additional crimes, only embezzlement.

G: Solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

H: Conspiracy, embezzlement, and murder.

I: Conspiracy and murder.

So, the man's actions include:

1. Embezzlement â€“ already established.

2. Solicitation to commit murder.

3. Conspiracy to commit murder.

4. Murder itself.

So, the additional crimes beyond embezzlement would be solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.

Looking at the options, option C includes all four, but the question is about additional crimes beyond embezzlement. So option C would include embezzlement along with the others, but the question is phrased as "in addition to embezzlement," so the answer should not include embezzlement again. Wait, no: the question says "in addition to embezzlement, of what crime or crimes may the man properly be convicted?" So the embezzlement is a given, and they're asking what else.

Therefore, the correct answer would include solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.

Looking again at the options, option C includes all four, but since the question is about additional crimes, perhaps the intended answer is to include all except embezzlement. Wait, no, option C includes embezzlement as one of the choices. But in the question, the man is already guilty of embezzlement, so the additional crimes would be the other three. So the correct answer would be the option that includes conspiracy, solicitation, and murder.

Looking at the options again:

Option C says Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. So that would include all four, but the question is about in addition to embezzlement, so the other three. So the correct answer would be an option that includes conspiracy, solicitation, and murder. Let me check the options:

Looking at the options, option C includes all four, but the question is about additional crimes beyond embezzlement. So perhaps option C is the intended answer because it's the only one that includes all the applicable crimes. Alternatively, maybe I should reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the man can be convicted of murder as well because he's the one who orchestrated it. So the three additional crimes would be conspiracy, solicitation, and murder.

Looking again:

Option C is "Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder." So that's all four, but the question is about additional crimes beyond embezzlement. So the correct answer would be an option that includes conspiracy, solicitation, and murder, without including embezzlement again.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have an option that includes just those three. Let me check all options:

Option A: Conspiracy and solicitation. So missing murder.

Option B: Same as A, just the order swapped.

Option C: All four.

Option E: Only murder.

Option G: Solicitation, embezzlement, murder. So missing conspiracy.

Option H: Conspiracy, embezzlement, murder. Missing solicitation.

Option I: Conspiracy and murder. Missing solicitation.

So the only option that includes all three additional crimes (solicitation, conspiracy, murder) is option C, which includes embezzlement as well. But the question is about "in addition to embezzlement," so maybe the correct answer is option C, because it's the only one that includes all the applicable crimes, including embezzlement. But the question is asking, in addition to embezzlement, what else, so perhaps option C is the correct answer because it lists all the crimes he can be convicted of, including the additional ones beyond embezzlement.

Alternatively, perhaps the man can't be convicted of conspiracy because he was the one who approached the killer, and perhaps the conspiracy is with the killer. But I think that's correct; the man and the killer entered into a conspiracy to commit murder.

Therefore, the man could be convicted of conspiracy, solicitation, and murder, in addition to embezzlement. So the correct option would be C: Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

Wait, but the question says "in addition to embezzlement," so the answer should include the other three. But looking again, option C includes all four, so perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the man can be convicted of murder, conspiracy, and solicitation, in addition to embezzlement. So the correct answer would be C.

I think that's the case. So the answer should be option C.

The scenario involves a man who embezzled money from his automobile leasing agency. When his partner, a woman, suspected foul play and suggested an audit, the man panicked and hired a professional killer to murder her for $10,000. The woman subsequently died in a car crash arranged by the killer. The question asks what additional crimes, beyond embezzlement, the man may be convicted of.

To analyze the potential crimes:

1. **Embezzlement**: This is already established and not in dispute.
2. **Solicitation**: The man solicited the killer to commit murder, which satisfies the legal definition of solicitation.
3. **Conspiracy**: The man and the killer formed an agreement to commit murder, and overt acts (like hiring the killer and arranging the car crash) were taken in furtherance of that agreement, satisfying the elements of conspiracy.
4. **Murder**: The man is guilty of murder as the mastermind behind the killing, even though he did not directly commit it.

Given these points, the man could be convicted of solicitation, conspiracy, and murder, in addition to embezzlement. Among the options provided, only **Option C** includes all these crimes: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

Answer: C
