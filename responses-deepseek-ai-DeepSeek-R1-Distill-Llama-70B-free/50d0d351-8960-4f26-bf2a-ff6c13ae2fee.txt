Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is about what shifts the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the demand for a currency, like the Mexican peso, is influenced by a few key factors. These factors are usually related to trade and investment. So, when people or businesses want to buy things from Mexico, like goods or services, they need pesos. That increases the demand for pesos. On the flip side, if demand for Mexican stuff decreases, fewer people need pesos, so the demand curve for pesos would shift left.

Looking at the options:

Option A: An increase in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles. If more people want Mexican textiles, they'll need more pesos to buy them. So that would increase demand, shifting the curve to the right, not left. So this isn't the answer.

Option B: Speculation that the peso will increase in value. If people think the peso is going to get stronger, they might buy more now because they expect it to be worth more later. That would increase demand, shifting the curve right. So B is probably not it.

Option C: A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles. If fewer people are buying Mexican textiles, they need fewer pesos. So demand for pesos drops, shifting the curve left. This looks like a possible correct answer.

Option D: An increase in the international demand for Mexican tourism. More tourists would come to Mexico, needing pesos to spend. That would increase demand for the peso, shifting the curve right. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: A stable rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries. Stable inflation might mean that the peso's value remains steady, but I'm not sure how that affects demand. If Mexico's inflation is lower than others, their goods are cheaper, which could increase demand for pesos. But if it's stable, maybe it doesn't have much effect. So E might not cause a left shift.

Option F: A lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries. Lower inflation means Mexican goods are more competitively priced. So more people would buy them, needing more pesos. That would shift the demand curve right, so F isn't the answer.

Option G: An increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries. Higher interest rates attract investors because they can earn more. Investors would need to buy pesos to invest in Mexico, increasing demand. So G would shift the curve right, not left.

Wait, so the only option that leads to a decrease in the demand for pesos is when the international demand for Mexican goods (like textiles) decreases. That's option C. So when people buy less Mexican stuff, they need fewer pesos, so the demand curve for the peso shifts left.

I think that's it. So the answer should be C.

To determine which factor shifts the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left, we analyze how each option affects the demand for pesos. The demand for a currency decreases when there is less need for it, such as when international demand for the country's goods or services declines.

- **Option A**: Increased demand for Mexican textiles would raise the demand for pesos, shifting the curve right.  
- **Option B**: Speculation that the peso will strengthen encourages buying pesos now, increasing demand and shifting the curve right.  
- **Option C**: Decreased demand for Mexican textiles reduces the need for pesos, shifting the curve left.  
- **Option D**: Increased tourism demand requires more pesos, shifting the curve right.  
- **Option E**: Stable inflation relative to other countries does not significantly impact demand for pesos.  
- **Option F**: Lower inflation makes Mexican goods more competitive, increasing demand for pesos and shifting the curve right.  
- **Option G**: Higher interest rates attract investors, increasing demand for pesos and shifting the curve right.  

The only option that decreases demand for pesos is **Option C**, as reduced demand for Mexican textiles leads to a leftward shift in the demand curve.  

Answer: C
