Okay, so I've got this problem here about a college graduate who borrows $8,000 to buy a car. The lender is charging an annual interest rate of 10%, and the question is asking what the monthly payment rate needs to be to pay off the loan in 3 years. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but I remember that this is a typical fixed-rate loan problem. I think the formula used here is the Present Value of an Annuity formula, which calculates the monthly payment needed to pay off a loan given the principal, interest rate, and number of payments.

Wait, right, the formula is M = P * (r(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n -1), where:
- M is the monthly payment,
- P is the principal loan amount,
- r is the monthly interest rate,
- n is the number of payments.

So in this case, P is $8,000. The annual interest rate is 10%, so the monthly rate r would be 10% divided by 12, which is approximately 0.0083333. The loan is for 3 years, so n is 3 years multiplied by 12 months, giving 36 payments.

Plugging the numbers in: M = 8000 * (0.0083333*(1+0.0083333)^36) / ((1+0.0083333)^36 -1).

Wait, let me double-check that. Yeah, the numerator is r times (1+r) to the power of n, and the denominator is (1+r)^n minus 1.

Calculating (1 + 0.0083333)^36 first. Let's see, 0.0083333 is 1/120, so 1 + 1/120 is 121/120. Raising that to 36th power. I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can approximate it.

Alternatively, I can use the formula step by step. Let me compute each part.

First, compute r: 0.10 / 12 = 0.008333.

n = 36.

Now, (1 + r)^n = (1.0083333)^36.

Hmm, I might need to use a calculator for this, but wait, maybe I can compute it using the rule of 72 or some approximation? No, that's for doubling time. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.

Wait, 1.0083333^36. Let's see, 36 months is 3 years. So 1.0083333^36. I can take natural logs to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute it numerically. Let me think:

Using logarithms: ln(1.0083333) is approximately 0.008273 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x when x is small). So ln(1.0083333) ≈ 0.008333 - 0.000033 (since (x^2)/2 for x=0.008333 is about 0.0000345). So approximately 0.0082995.

Multiply by 36: 0.0082995 * 36 ≈ 0.29879.

Exponentiate: e^0.29879 ≈ 1.3478 (since e^0.3 is about 1.34986, so close to that).

So (1.0083333)^36 ≈ 1.3478.

Now, the numerator in the formula is r*(1+r)^n, which is 0.0083333 * 1.3478 ≈ 0.011236.

The denominator is (1.0083333)^36 -1, which is 1.3478 -1 = 0.3478.

So now, the fraction is 0.011236 / 0.3478 ≈ 0.0323.

So M = 8000 * 0.0323 ≈ 8000 * 0.0323.

Wait, 0.0323 times 8000: 0.03 *8000 is 240, and 0.0023 *8000 is 18.4, so total is approximately 258.4.

Looking at the options, option C is $258.14, which is close to what I got. So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.

First, r = 10% per annum, so 0.10 / 12 = 0.00833333333.

n = 36.

Compute (1 + r)^n.

Using a calculator, 1.00833333333^36.

Let me compute step by step:

1.0083333^1 = 1.0083333

^2 = 1.0083333 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.0167366

^3 ≈ 1.025069

^4 ≈ 1.03319

^5 ≈ 1.041075

^6 ≈ 1.048728

Wait, but this is tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better method.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for compound interest, but I think the initial approximation is sufficient for this purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value factor.

The present value factor for an ordinary annuity is [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

Wait, no, the formula I used earlier was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (1.0083333)^36 more accurately.

Using a calculator:

Let me compute it:

r = 0.00833333333

n = 36

(1 + r)^n = (1.00833333333)^36.

I can compute this using logarithms.

ln(1.00833333333) ≈ 0.0082735 (using a calculator: ln(1.00833333333) is approximately 0.0082735).

Multiply by 36: 0.0082735 * 36 ≈ 0.297834.

Exponentiate: e^0.297834 ≈ 1.34785 (since e^0.3 is about 1.34986, so this is accurate).

So (1.0083333)^36 ≈ 1.34785.

Now, numerator: r*(1 + r)^n = 0.00833333333 * 1.34785 ≈ 0.011236.

Denominator: (1 + r)^n - 1 = 1.34785 - 1 = 0.34785.

So M = 8000 * (0.011236 / 0.34785) ≈ 8000 * 0.0323 ≈ 258.4.

Which matches option C of $258.14. Wait, but why is it $258.14? Did I make a rounding error?

Wait, perhaps my approximation of (1.0083333)^36 is a bit off. Let me compute it more precisely.

Wait, perhaps using the formula more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator if I had one. But since I can't, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 1.347848. Let's use that.

So numerator: 0.00833333333 * 1.347848 ≈ 0.011236.

Denominator: 0.347848.

So 0.011236 / 0.347848 ≈ 0.03229.

So M = 8000 * 0.03229 = 258.32, which is approximately $258.32.

Looking at the options, option C is $258.14, which is very close. So perhaps the slight discrepancy is due to more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation yields 258.14. Let me think about how to compute it more accurately without a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (1.0083333)^36 using a binomial expansion or more precise method.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to accept that the correct calculation leads to approximately $258.14, which is option C.

To determine the monthly payment required to pay off an $8,000 loan with an annual interest rate of 10% over 3 years, we use the formula for the monthly payment on a fixed-rate loan:

\[
M = P \cdot \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 8000 \) (loan principal),
- \( r = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333 \) (monthly interest rate),
- \( n = 3 \cdot 12 = 36 \) (number of monthly payments).

### Step 1: Calculate \( (1+r)^n \)
\[
(1 + 0.008333)^{36} \approx 1.34785
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator
\[
r \cdot (1+r)^n = 0.008333 \cdot 1.34785 \approx 0.011236
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the denominator
\[
(1+r)^n - 1 = 1.34785 - 1 = 0.34785
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the fraction
\[
\frac{0.011236}{0.34785} \approx 0.03229
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the monthly payment
\[
M = 8000 \cdot 0.03229 \approx 258.32
\]

The calculated monthly payment is approximately $258.32, which is closest to option **C: $258.14**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding during intermediate calculations.

Answer: **C**
