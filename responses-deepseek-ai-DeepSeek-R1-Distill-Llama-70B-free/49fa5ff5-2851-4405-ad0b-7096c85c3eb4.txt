Question:

A homeowner resides downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She has sued both the owner of the facility and the supplier of a solvent used at the facility. She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?

Options:

A: No, because the solvent supplier should have taken precautions to prevent spills.
B: No, because the solvent supplier is directly responsible for the contamination.
C: Yes, because the solvent supplier can't be held accountable for the negligence of the facility owner.
D: Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.
E: Yes, because the negligence of the facility owner is the primary cause of contamination.
F: No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.
G: Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.
H: Yes, because the homeowner does not have substantial proof of contamination.
I: No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.
J: No, because the solvent supplier and the facility owner are both responsible for the contamination, regardless of the amount each contributed.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The situation is about a homeowner suing two parties: the owner of a metal fabrication facility and the supplier of a solvent used there. The homeowner claims that contaminants, mostly the solvent, were released at the facility and have migrated to her property, causing contamination in the soil, groundwater, and her well. She's alleging negligence by both parties.

The facility owner is accused of releasing contaminants due to their negligence, and the solvent supplier's employees are said to have spilled solvent while filling a rooftop tank, which also contributed to the contamination. Now, the solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was contamination, both the facility owner and the supplier might have contributed, but it's impossible to determine how much each is responsible for. They say the homeowner can't prove the exact damage each caused, so they shouldn't be held liable. Also, there's no evidence that the two defendants acted together or in concert.

So the question is whether the court should grant the solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment.

Hmm. I remember that in tort law, when multiple parties cause harm, there's the concept of joint and several liability, especially when the harm is indivisible. If the damage can't be apportioned between the defendants, each can be held fully responsible for the entire harm. But wait, I think that applies when the defendants are acting in concert or as part of a concerted action, or when their actions combine to cause a single harm where it's impossible to distinguish their individual contributions.

In this case, the homeowner is suing both the facility owner and the supplier. The supplier's argument is that the contamination could have come from either of them, and there's no way to tell how much each contributed. They say that without evidence of their joint action, the homeowner can't hold them liable because the damage can't be allocated.

So, what's the rule here? I think about the concept of concurrent tortfeasors. Concurrent tortfeasors are two or more tortfeasors whose acts combine to cause an indivisible injury. In such cases, each can be held jointly and severally liable for the entire harm. The key point is whether the harm is indivisible. If the damage can't be divided between the two, then each is fully liable.

But wait, the supplier is arguing that the homeowner can't show how much each contributed, so the damages can't be allocated. So, without that ability, can the court hold them liable?

I think the homeowner's position is that both defendants' negligence contributed to the same harm, and the harm is such that it's impossible to separate their contributions. Therefore, they are both liable for the entire damage. This is the principle of joint and several liability.

So, the solvent supplier is moving for summary judgment, saying that without proof of their proportionate liability, they shouldn't be held liable. But if the homeowner can show that both parties' actions contributed to the same harm in a way that can't be apportioned, then the supplier can't escape liability just because the exact amount isn't known.

Looking at the answer options, I need to see which one aligns with this reasoning.

Option I says: No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.

That sounds right. If the homeowner can establish that the harm is indivisible and that both parties are concurrent tortfeasors, then the supplier can't avoid liability by arguing that the damages can't be allocated.

Other options: Option D says yes because there's no basis for allocating damages. But if it's an indivisible injury, allocation isn't necessary; joint liability applies regardless.

Option G says yes because there's no evidence they acted in concert. But concurrent tortfeasors don't need to act in concert; their independent acts can still combine to cause harm.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

The correct answer is I. 

The court should not grant the solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment because, under the principle of joint and several liability, concurrent tortfeasors are held fully responsible for an indivisible injury when their actions combine to cause harm, even if their individual contributions cannot be apportioned. The homeowner's claim that both parties' negligence resulted in indivisible contamination means the supplier cannot escape liability merely because the exact damage each caused is unknown.
