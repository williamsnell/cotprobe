Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Pauline should buy the stereo in New Jersey or New York. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the New Jersey stereo costs $698.50. That's straightforward, no taxes mentioned, so I guess that's the total price she'd pay there.

Now, the New York option is a bit more complicated. The price there is $684.75, but there are two taxes: a 4% state tax and a 2% city tax. I need to calculate the total cost including these taxes to compare it to New Jersey's price.

Wait, how do the taxes work? Are they applied one after the other, or is it a combined rate? I think each tax is applied sequentially. So first, the state tax is applied to the price, and then the city tax is applied to the new amount after state tax.

Let me calculate that. Let's start with the base price: $684.75.

First, apply the 4% state tax. So 4% of 684.75 is 0.04 * 684.75. Let me do that math. 0.04 * 600 is 24, and 0.04 * 84.75 is 3.39. So total state tax is 24 + 3.39 = $27.39. Adding that to the base price gives 684.75 + 27.39 = $712.14.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no: if the state tax is 4%, then it's 684.75 * 1.04. Let me calculate that correctly. 684.75 * 1.04. Let me break it down: 684.75 + (684.75 * 0.04). The 0.04 part is 27.39, so adding that gives 712.14. Okay, so after state tax, it's $712.14.

Now, the city tax is 2% on that new amount. So 2% of 712.14 is 0.02 * 712.14. Let me compute that: 700 * 0.02 is 14, and 12.14 * 0.02 is 0.2428. So total city tax is 14.2428, which is approximately $14.24.

Adding that to the $712.14 gives a total of 712.14 + 14.24 = $726.38.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm applying the taxes correctly. Another way to think about it is to multiply the base price by 1.04 and then by 1.02. So 684.75 * 1.04 * 1.02.

Let me calculate that. First, 684.75 * 1.04. Let me do that step by step. 684.75 * 1 is 684.75, 684.75 * 0.04 is 27.39, so together it's 712.14, as before. Now, multiply 712.14 by 1.02. So 712.14 * 1 is 712.14, and 712.14 * 0.02 is 14.2428. Adding those gives 726.3828, which is approximately $726.38.

So the total cost in New York would be about $726.38.

Comparing that to New Jersey's $698.50, New York is more expensive. So Pauline should buy the stereo in New Jersey because it's cheaper.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when dealing with percentages, it's easy to slip up.

Alternative approach: Calculate the total tax rate. The total tax would be 4% + 2% plus the cross product. Wait, no, because they're applied one after another. So the combined tax factor is (1 + 0.04) * (1 + 0.02) = 1.04 * 1.02 = 1.0608, which is a 6.08% increase over the base price.

So 684.75 * 1.0608 = ?

Let me compute that: 684.75 * 1.0608.

First, 684.75 * 1 = 684.75.

684.75 * 0.06 = 41.085.

684.75 * 0.0008 = approximately 0.5478.

Adding those together: 684.75 + 41.085 = 725.835 + 0.5478 â‰ˆ 726.3828, which matches what I got earlier.

So yes, New York's total is about $726.38, which is higher than New Jersey's $698.50.

Therefore, Pauline should buy the stereo in New Jersey because it's cheaper after considering the taxes in New York.

Looking at the options, option D says "The New Jersey stereo," which would be the correct choice based on this calculation.

To determine where Pauline should buy the stereo, we compare the total costs in New Jersey and New York.

- **New Jersey**: The stereo costs $698.50, with no additional taxes mentioned.
- **New York**: The base price is $684.75, but it is subject to a 4% state tax and a 2% city tax. 

To calculate the total cost in New York:
1. Apply the 4% state tax:  
   \[
   684.75 \times 1.04 = 712.14
   \]
2. Apply the 2% city tax to the new amount:  
   \[
   712.14 \times 1.02 = 726.38
   \]

Thus, the total cost in New York is approximately $726.38, which is higher than the $698.50 price in New Jersey. 

Therefore, Pauline should buy the stereo in New Jersey because it is cheaper after accounting for the taxes in New York.
