Okay, so I've got this problem here about a glass vase that sells for $25.00. The question is asking for the gross profit on the vase, and there are some given percentages: net profit is 7%, and operating expenses are 39%. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what all these terms mean. I remember that in business, profit calculations can be a bit tricky because there are different types like gross profit, operating profit, and net profit. Gross profit is usually the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold (COGS). Operating profit would then subtract the operating expenses, and net profit is what's left after all other expenses, including things like taxes and interest.

Wait, but in this problem, they're talking about operating expenses being 39%. I think that's the operating expense ratio, which is operating expenses divided by sales. So if operating expenses are 39% of the selling price, then the operating profit would be sales minus COGS minus operating expenses. But wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me clarify.

Let me try to write down the relationships. The selling price is $25.00. Let me denote the cost of goods sold as COGS, and the operating expenses as OE. The gross profit would be Sales - COGS. The operating profit would be Gross Profit - Operating Expenses. And the net profit would be Operating Profit minus other expenses, but in this case, maybe the given net profit is after operating expenses. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the net profit margin.

Wait, the question says the net profit is 7%, and operating expenses are 39%. So, the net profit is 7% of sales. So, Net Profit = 7% of $25, which is 0.07 * 25 = $1.75. So the net profit is $1.75.

Now, how do we get from there to the gross profit? Well, I think the operating expenses are 39% of sales, which is 0.39 * 25 = $9.75. So the operating expenses are $9.75.

If I think about the net profit, it's after all expenses except maybe taxes. But perhaps in this context, the net profit is calculated as Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses. So:

Net Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

We know Net Profit is $1.75, and Operating Expenses are $9.75. So:

$1.75 = Gross Profit - $9.75

So, solving for Gross Profit would be $1.75 + $9.75 = $11.50. Hmm, that seems like it's $11.50. Let me check the options. Option E is $11.50. So is that the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. Sometimes, the net profit margin is calculated based on sales. So Net Profit = (Sales - COGS - Operating Expenses) = Net Income. So in that case, Net Profit is 7% of sales, which is $1.75, as we calculated.

Alternatively, sometimes people define net profit as (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses), which would be the same as Operating Profit, but I think more accurately, the net profit is after all expenses, including operating, taxes, etc. But in this problem, maybe they're simplifying it so that operating expenses are the main expenses, and the net profit is after that.

So if Sales = $25, then:

Gross Profit = Sales - COGS

Operating Profit (which might also be called EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes) = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

Net Profit = Operating Profit - (other expenses like taxes, interest). But in this problem, perhaps the Net Profit is given as 7% of sales, implying that it's after operating expenses.

So, let me try another approach. Let me denote:

Let me define COGS as the cost of goods sold, which is what the vase cost the company to produce or purchase.

Selling price (SP) is $25.

Gross Profit (GP) = SP - COGS.

Operating Expenses (OE) = 39% of SP = 0.39 * 25 = $9.75.

Net Profit (NP) = GP - OE = 7% of SP = 0.07 * 25 = $1.75.

So, substituting, we have:

GP - OE = NP

GP - $9.75 = $1.75

So, GP = $1.75 + $9.75 = $11.50.

So the gross profit is $11.50, which is option E.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to approach this is to break down the selling price into components. Let me think in terms of percentages.

The selling price is made up of COGS plus Gross Profit. The gross profit is then used to cover operating expenses and leave a net profit.

Wait, but maybe if I think about the components:

SP = COGS + Gross Profit.

Gross Profit = SP - COGS.

Then, the operating expenses are 39% of SP, which is $9.75.

So, from Gross Profit, subtract operating expenses to get net profit.

So, Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = Net Profit.

Which is the same as before: GP - 9.75 = 1.75, so GP = 11.50.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of ratios.

If the operating expenses are 39% of sales, then the sum of COGS and Gross Profit is 100%, and operating expenses are 39% of that. But perhaps that's complicating it.

Wait, another approach: Let me represent the selling price as 100 units. So, SP = $25.00.

Operating Expenses (OE) = 39% of SP = 0.39 * 25 = $9.75.

Net Profit (NP) = 7% of SP = 0.07 *25 = $1.75.

So, the amount left for COGS and Gross Profit would be SP - OE - NP, but that doesn't sound right because OE and NP are both calculated from SP.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the total of COGS, Gross Profit, Operating Expenses, and Net Profit equals the SP. Wait no, that's not correct because Gross Profit is SP - COGS, and then operating expenses are subtracted from Gross Profit to get operating income, and then net profit is after that. Wait, no, perhaps the correct equation is:

SP = COGS + Gross Profit.

Gross Profit = Operating Expenses + Net Profit + any other expenses? Or maybe Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = Net Profit.

Yes, that's correct. So:

Gross Profit = COGS + Gross Profit, but wait, that's circular. Let me correct that.

Wait, SP = COGS + Gross Profit.

Then, from Gross Profit, we subtract Operating Expenses to get Net Profit.

So, Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = Net Profit.

So, Gross Profit = Net Profit + Operating Expenses.

Which is what I did earlier: $1.75 + $9.75 = $11.50.

Therefore, the gross profit is $11.50, which is option E.

To determine the gross profit on the vase, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Selling Price (SP):** $25.00  
2. **Net Profit:** 7% of SP = $1.75  
3. **Operating Expenses (OE):** 39% of SP = $9.75  

The relationship between these components is:  
\[
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Net Profit} + \text{Operating Expenses}
\]

Substituting the known values:  
\[
\text{Gross Profit} = \$1.75 + \$9.75 = \$11.50
\]

Thus, the gross profit on the vase is **$11.50**, which corresponds to option **E**.
