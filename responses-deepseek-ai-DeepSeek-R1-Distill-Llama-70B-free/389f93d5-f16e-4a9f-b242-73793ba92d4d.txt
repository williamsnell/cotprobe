Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Boston Red Sox's home runs over eight consecutive games. The numbers are 2, 3, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0. I need to find the mean, median, and mode. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, part (a) is the mean. Mean is the average, right? So I need to add up all these numbers and then divide by how many games there are. Let's see, the numbers are 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0.

Adding them up: 2 + 3 is 5, plus 0 is 5, plus 3 makes 8, plus 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13, plus 3 is 16, and the last 0 makes 16 total. Wait, 2+3=5, plus 0 is 5, plus 3 is 8, plus4 is 12, plus1 is13, plus3 is16, plus0 is16. So total is 16. There are 8 games, so 16 divided by 8 is 2. So the mean is 2.

Wait, let me double-check the addition. 2+3=5, +0=5, +3=8, +4=12, +1=13, +3=16, +0=16. Yep, that's correct. So mean is 2.

Next, part (b) is the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are 8 numbers, which is even, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th numbers.

So first, I should arrange the data in order. Let's sort them: 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4.

Wait, let me make sure. The original data: 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4. Yes, that's correct.

So the 4th number is 2, and the 5th is 3. The average of 2 and 3 is (2+3)/2 = 2.5. So the median is 2.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a median of 2.5 in all the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options given are from A to J. Let me look at the options. Option J has median 2.5, mode 3, mean 2. Option F has median 2 and mode 3. Hmm, wait maybe I made a mistake in the median calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the sorting. The data is 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4. Positions 1 to 8. So for even number of terms, the median is average of 4th and 5th terms. The 4th term is 2, 5th is 3. So (2+3)/2 = 2.5. So median is 2.5.

Then, part (c) is the mode. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the sorted data: 0 appears twice, 1 once, 2 once, 3 appears three times, and 4 once. So the mode is 3.

So putting it all together, mean is 2, median is 2.5, mode is 3.

Now, looking at the options, which one matches? Let's go through them:

Option A: Mean 3, median 3, mode 3. No, mean is 2.

Option B: Mean 2.5, median 3, mode 0. No.

Option C: Mean 3, median 2, mode 1. No.

Option D: Mean 1, median 2, mode 4. No.

Option E: Mean 2.16, median 2, mode 3. Mean is 2, not 2.16.

Option F: Mean 2.5, median 2, mode 3. Mean is 2, so no.

Option G: Mean 2, median 3, mode 0. Median is 2.5, mode is 3. So no.

Option H: Mean 1.5, median 2, mode 3. Mean is wrong.

Option I: Mean 2, median 1.5, mode 2. Mode is wrong, and median is 2.5.

Option J: Mean 2, Median 2.5, Mode 3. Yes, this matches what I calculated.

So the correct answer should be option J.

The problem involves calculating the mean, median, and mode of the number of home runs hit by the Boston Red Sox in eight consecutive games, with the data provided as: 2, 3, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0.

### Calculations:
1. **Mean**:  
   The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of games.  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{2 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 0}{8} = \frac{16}{8} = 2
   \]

2. **Median**:  
   The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Since there are 8 values (even number), the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values.  
   Ordering the data: 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4.  
   The 4th value is 2, and the 5th value is 3.  
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5
   \]

3. **Mode**:  
   The mode is the value that appears most frequently. In the data, the value 3 appears three times, which is more than any other value.  
   \[
   \text{Mode} = 3
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: Mean: 3, Median: 3, Mode: 3 → Incorrect (Mean is 2).  
- **Option B**: Mean: 2.5, Median: 3, Mode: 0 → Incorrect (Mean is 2, Median is 2.5, Mode is 3).  
- **Option C**: Mean: 3, Median: 2, Mode: 1 → Incorrect (Mean is 2, Median is 2.5, Mode is 3).  
- **Option D**: Mean: 1, Median: 2, Mode: 4 → Incorrect (Mean is 2, Median is 2.5, Mode is 3).  
- **Option E**: Mean: 2.16, Median: 2, Mode: 3 → Incorrect (Mean is 2, Median is 2.5).  
- **Option F**: Mean: 2.5, Median: 2, Mode: 3 → Incorrect (Mean is 2, Median is 2.5).  
- **Option G**: Mean: 2, Median: 3, Mode: 0 → Incorrect (Median is 2.5, Mode is 3).  
- **Option H**: Mean: 1.5, Median: 2, Mode: 3 → Incorrect (Mean is 2, Median is 2.5).  
- **Option I**: Mean: 2, Median: 1.5, Mode: 2 → Incorrect (Median is 2.5, Mode is 3).  
- **Option J**: Mean: 2, Median: 2.5, Mode: 3 → Correct.

### Final Answer:
J
