Question:

A lumber mill contracted to deliver one thousand8-foot sheets of plywood to a home improvement store on the first of each month for 10 consecutive months starting June 1. The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?

Options:

A: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.
B: Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.
C: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.
D: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.
E: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.
F: Judgment for the mill, because they had informed the store about the issue in advance.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation is about a lumber mill that contracted to deliver plywood sheets to a home improvement store. The contract is for 1,000 8-foot sheets each month for 10 months starting June 1. So June, July, August deliveries were on time and paid for. Then on August 16, the mill tells the store they can't meet the September 1 delivery because their lumber reserve was destroyed by a forest fire. They ask to be excused from further performance, but the store refuses and demands the remaining shipments. When September's shipment doesn't arrive, the store sues for breach.

The question is, how would the court hold? The options are from A to F.

Hmm, I remember that contract law has several doctrines that can discharge a party's obligations. The main ones I can think of are impossibility, impracticability, frustration of purpose, and act of God.

Impossibility of performance is when it's literally impossible to perform due to unforeseen circumstances. But I think the modern approach under the UCC (since this is a sale of goods) is the doctrine of impracticability, which is a bit broader. Also, frustration of purpose is when the purpose of the contract is frustrated, making performance pointless.

In this case, the mill's lumber was destroyed by a forest fire. So the mill can't deliver because they don't have the materials. Is this an impossibility or impracticability situation?

Wait, under the UCC, for a seller, if the goods are destroyed and they are not at fault, they might be excused. Specifically, UCC §2-615 talks about excuse by failure of presupposed conditions. It includes cases where the goods are destroyed without fault of the seller, as long as the destruction is unforeseeable.

So here, the forest fire destroyed the lumber reserve. Was this unforeseeable? I mean, forest fires can happen, but maybe it's not something the mill could reasonably anticipate. So if the lumber was specifically for this contract, and it's destroyed without their fault, they might be excused.

But wait, the contract is for 10 months, starting June. Deliveries were made June, July, August. Then on August 16, they inform the store about the September shipment. So the September delivery is the fourth one, right? And the mill is saying they can't perform because of the fire.

So the issue is whether the destruction of their lumber supply, which is an unforeseen event beyond their control, makes their performance impossible or impracticable.

In UCC terms, if the goods are destroyed without the seller's fault, and this was a basic assumption of the contract, then the seller is excused from performing. But this is subject to certain conditions. For example, the seller must not have contracted against such a risk, and the destruction must not be due to their own negligence.

In this case, the mill didn't cause the fire, so it's not their fault. The fire destroyed their reserve, making it impossible to deliver the plywood. So under UCC 2-615, the mill's obligation would be excused because the failure is due to an unforeseen contingency which the contract assumes will not occur.

Wait, but the contract was for 10 months. The first three months were fulfilled. So the goods here are probably not specific or existing at the time of the contract. If the lumber was destroyed after the contract was made, but before performance, the mill might have an obligation to procure substitute materials unless that's commercially impracticable.

Wait, no. Wait, if the goods are destroyed before the risk of loss passes, which for a sale is typically when the goods are received by the buyer. But in this case, the destruction is of the mill's own materials before delivery. So under UCC 2-613, when goods are destroyed after the contract is made but before they are delivered, the risk of loss may fall on the seller unless they can show that the loss was not due to their fault.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

UCC 2-615 deals with excuse by failure of presupposed conditions, like when the seller's performance becomes impracticable due to an unforeseen event. So, the mill's source of supply is destroyed by a fire, which is an act of God and beyond their control. This would make their performance impracticable, allowing them to be excused, provided they didn't assume the risk of such an event.

So the question is, does the destruction of the lumber count as an event that makes performance impracticable? I think yes. Forest fires can be considered unforeseen events unless the area is prone to frequent fires, but the question doesn't say that. So it's an unforeseen hindrance.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Judgment for the mill, because performance discharged by impossibility.

Option E: Mill because act of God beyond control.

Option C: Mill because unforeseeable hindrance.

Option B: Store, because duties not excused.

Option D: Frustration of purpose.

Option F: Mill, because informed in advance.

Wait, so which doctrine applies here? Impossibility, impracticability, or frustration?

Frustration of purpose is when the purpose of the contract is defeated, but the performance is still possible. Like, if you rent a space for a concert and the performer cancels, but the space is still there—so you don't have to pay because the purpose is frustrated. But here, the mill can't perform because the materials are gone, which is more about impossibility/impracticability than frustration.

So the correct doctrine here is impracticability under UCC 2-615.

Looking at the options, A says impossibility. Impracticability is a broader concept. So A might not be correct because it's not necessarily impossible, just impracticable.

E says it's an act of God beyond their control. Act of God is a type of unforeseen event, but the term is more of a common law concept. In UCC, it's more about impracticability.

So under UCC 2-615, the mill would be excused because the forest fire made their performance impracticable.

So looking at the options, option E says it's an act of God beyond their control. But I think the correct reasoning is under impracticability, which is option C: unforeseeable hindrance.

Wait, no. Option C says "unforeseeable hindrance in performance." Option E says "act of God."

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The options are:

A: Impossibility.

B: Not excused.

C: Unforeseeable hindrance.

D: Frustration.

E: Act of God.

F: Informed in advance.

So, under UCC 2-615, the elements are: the event must make performance impracticable; the event must be unforeseen; and the non-occurrence of the event must have been a basic assumption of the contract.

A forest fire destroying the lumber supply would qualify as an unforeseen event beyond the mill's control, making performance impracticable. So the mill is excused.

So the court would hold for the mill, meaning options A, C, D, E, F are possibilities.

Option A: Impossibility. Impracticability is a better fit because it's not that it's impossible, but it's just very difficult.

Option C: Unforeseeable hindrance. That sounds like impracticability.

Option E: Act of God. Well, a forest fire is an act of God, but the UCC terms it under impracticability.

So the options are either A, C, or E.

But in the UCC, the doctrine is impracticability, which is an unforeseen hindrance. So option C says "unforeseeable hindrance in performance," which aligns with 2-615.

Wait, but I think the UCC uses the term "impracticability," not hindrance. But the option is phrased as hindrance, which might be a close enough term.

Alternatively, option E is about act of God, which is a factor in determining impracticability.

Wait, but the answer might be option B: judgment for the store because duties not excused. Wait, no, that can't be right because the mill has a valid excuse.

Wait, but I'm thinking the correct answer is either A, C, or E.

Another angle: the contract is for future deliveries, so the lumber needed for future deliveries might not have existed at the time of contracting. So when the lumber is destroyed, perhaps the mill can't perform because the goods no longer exist. So that would be impossibility.

Wait, but the mill had a reserve that was destroyed. The reserve was their source for the plywood. So if the plywood for the future deliveries was part of that reserve, and it's gone, then they can't perform. So that could make the performance impossible.

But wait, the UCC doesn't use "impossibility" as much as "impracticability." So, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the performance is impossible now.

Wait, but in the common law, impossibility requires the performance to be literally impossible. If the goods are destroyed, and the seller can't reasonably obtain substitute materials, it's impossible.

Alternatively, under UCC, it's impracticable, but for the bar exam, sometimes they equate the terms.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says discharged by impossibility.

If the lumber is destroyed, and they can't get more, then the mill can't perform. So that's impossibility.

But wait, could the mill obtain plywood from another source? If it's impracticable to do so, then it's excusable. So if the cost is too high, or it's unavailable, then they're excused.

But the question says the lumber reserve was destroyed, making them unable to meet the September delivery. It doesn't specify that they can't get more lumber elsewhere. So perhaps the court would not find impossibility, but impracticability, because the mill could perhaps buy from another source but it's just difficult.

Wait, but the mill's reserve was destroyed. If they don't have the materials, and can't get them elsewhere, then it's impossible. But if they can get them, but it's more expensive, then it's impracticable.

In this case, the question doesn't say whether the mill can get more materials elsewhere. It just says their reserve was destroyed. So perhaps the court would see it as impossible.

Alternatively, the mill might be required to use reasonable efforts to mitigate. If they can't find any plywood, then it's impossible.

I'm a bit stuck between A and C.

Wait, let me think of the UCC 2-615 factors. It requires that the event make performance impracticable, which includes situations where the seller's supply is disrupted. So if the mill can't get plywood because their reserve was destroyed, and they can't get more, that would make it impracticable.

So perhaps the correct answer is C: unforeseeable hindrance.

Alternatively, if the plywood is a staple commodity that the mill could buy elsewhere, then they might be expected to do so, making their failure inexcusable.

Wait, but the question says the lumber reserve was destroyed. So perhaps the plywood was to be made from that reserve. If the reserve is gone, and they can't make more plywood because the materials are destroyed, then it's impossible.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the mill should have had a backup source, but the question doesn't indicate that. So maybe the court would rule that the mill is excused.

In that case, among the options, A would be impossibility, C would be impracticability.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of some examples. If a farmer's crop is destroyed by a storm, and they can't deliver, that's impracticability. So the farmer would be excused.

Similarly, here, the lumber is destroyed, making the mill unable to perform. So the court would likely hold that the mill is excused, so options A, C, or E.

Wait, another thought: The contract is for 10 months. The first three shipments were made. The problem arises with the fourth. If the lumber destroyed was specifically for the future shipments, then the mill can't perform, making it impossible.

But under UCC, the seller can be excused if their sources are destroyed. So I think the court would find for the mill.

So looking back at the options:

A: Impossibility.

B: Store wins.

C: Unforeseeable hindrance.

E: Act of God.

I think the correct answer is A: Impossibility.

Wait, no. Because UCC uses impracticability more than impossibility. So the better fit is C: unforeseeable hindrance.

Alternatively, in common law, this would be impossibility, but since it's a sale of goods, UCC applies, so impracticability is the key.

So the answer would be that the mill is excused because of impracticability, which is an unforeseeable hindrance. So option C.

Wait, but option C says "unforeseeable hindrance in performance." That's similar to impracticability, which is covered under UCC 2-615.

So I think the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, but the UCC doesn't require impossibility, just impracticability. So the correct answer would be C.

But I'm a bit shaky on this.

Alternatively, some sources might treat this as impossibility. For example, if the specific goods are destroyed, it's impossible to perform.

But under UCC, specific goods are identified to the contract, and their destruction would discharge the contract under 2-613.

Wait, wait, I think I've confused two sections. UCC 2-613 deals with the risk of loss when goods are destroyed after the contract is made but before delivery. If the goods were not received by the buyer and were destroyed, the seller would be excused if they were not at fault.

But in this case, the goods to be delivered in September were not yet delivered. So if the plywood for September's shipment was part of the destroyed reserve, then the seller would be excused under 2-613 if they can show that the loss was not their fault.

So under 2-613, the seller would not be liable because the goods were destroyed without their fault.

In that case, the correct reason is impossibility of performance because the specific goods no longer exist.

So then option A would be correct.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to recap.

The contract is for the sale of goods (plywood). The lumber (the material to make plywood) was destroyed by a fire. So the plywood to be delivered in September can't be made because the materials are gone.

Under UCC 2-613, when goods identified to the contract are destroyed before the risk of loss has passed to the buyer, and the seller is not at fault, the contract is discharged.

So the seller doesn't have to perform because the specific goods are destroyed, making performance impossible.

Therefore, the court would hold that the mill is excused due to impossibility, so option A is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's about impracticability. Now I'm thinking it's about destruction of specific goods.

So the key here is whether the plywood for the September shipment was already identified or not. The problem says the lumber reserve was destroyed. So if the plywood for the September shipment was part of that reserve, then it's specific goods, and under 2-613, the seller is excused.

But if the plywood wasn't yet manufactured and the lumber was just the raw material, it's a bit different. Because the plywood wasn't yet produced, so they're not specific goods. Then the doctrine of impracticability would apply under 2-615.

So if the lumber was the raw material needed to make the plywood, and the plywood wasn't yet made, then the mill can't make the plywood because the raw materials are gone. So that's impracticable, not impossible.

But in that case, the court would apply 2-615, making option C the correct answer.

Wait, but the contract was for sheets of plywood, not lumber. So the lumber is the raw material the mill uses to make plywood. So the plywood for the September shipment hasn't been made yet. So the mill's inability to deliver is due to lack of raw materials, not the destruction of the specific plywood sheets.

So in that case, the correct doctrine is impracticability under 2-615, because the mill can't make the plywood due to the raw material shortage.

Thus, the answer would be C: unforeseeable hindrance.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: Forest fire is an act of God, which is an unforeseen event beyond the mill's control, making performance impossible. So option E might be tempting, but I think the UCC terminology is more about impracticability.

So I think the correct answer is C: unforeseeable hindrance, making option C the choice.

But I'm a bit torn between A and C. Because if the plywood sheets were already made and part of the reserve, then destruction would make it impossible (A). If not, then impracticable (C).

The question says the lumber reserve was destroyed. Lumber is the raw material, not the finished plywood. So the plywood for September hasn't been made yet. So the mill can't make it because they have no lumber. So this is impracticable.

Thus, the correct answer is C: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C: "because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance." That sounds right.

Option E: "because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control." That's also a correct statement, but in UCC terms, it's covered under impracticability.

So I think C is the better answer.

Wait, but some might argue that option E is correct because it's an act of God, but I think the specific legal doctrine is impracticability.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question revolves around a lumber mill's inability to deliver plywood sheets due to a forest fire destroying its lumber reserve. The mill argues that this unforeseen event excuses its performance under the contract. The legal issue hinges on whether the mill's performance is excused due to impossibility, impracticability, or another doctrine.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically §2-615, a seller may be excused from performing if an unforeseen event renders performance impracticable. Impracticability is broader than impossibility and applies when performance becomes unreasonably difficult or costly due to circumstances beyond the seller's control. Here, the forest fire destroyed the mill's lumber reserve, which was necessary to manufacture the plywood. This event was unforeseen and beyond the mill's control, making it impracticable for the mill to fulfill the contract.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (Impossibility):** While the destruction of the lumber reserve makes performance difficult, it is not necessarily "impossible" if the mill could theoretically obtain lumber from another source. Thus, impr
