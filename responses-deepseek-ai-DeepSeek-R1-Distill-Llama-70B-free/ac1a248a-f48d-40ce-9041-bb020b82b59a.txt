Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says: If a couple has had three sons and the woman is pregnant with their fourth child, what's the probability that child four will also be male? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, okay, so the couple already has three sons, and now they're expecting a fourth. I need to find the probability that this fourth child is a boy. I remember that for each child, the probability of being male or female is usually considered independent, right? Like, each time it's a 50-50 chance, assuming no other factors.

Wait, but wait. Is it that simple? Sometimes I get confused with probability questions. Like, if each birth is an independent event, the gender of the fourth child shouldn't depend on the previous ones. So even though they've had three boys, the chance for the next one being a boy is still 50%? 

But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. I've heard about the concept of conditional probability, where the probability changes based on previous events. But in this case, I don't think it applies because each birth is independent. Like, the gender of each child doesn't affect the next one. So even if they have three boys, the fourth has the same chance as before.

Let me think of it this way: each child has two possibilities, male or female, each with a probability of 1/2. Since each is independent, the previous three sons don't influence the fourth. So the probability is just 1/2 for a boy and 1/2 for a girl.

Looking at the options, the choices are various fractions. The option I is 1/2, which would be the answer I'm thinking. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up this with any similar problems. Oh, right, sometimes people get confused with problems where you have a certain number of boys and girls and calculate probabilities based on combinations. But that's different, like if you were asked the probability that all four are boys given that at least one is a boy, that would be a different calculation. But this question is straightforward: given the previous three are boys, what's the chance the next is a boy?

No, that's not right. Wait, no, because each birth is independent, so the previous three have no effect. So it's the same as flipping a coin four times: each flip is independent, so the outcome of the fourth doesn't depend on the first three.

So I think I'm confident that the answer is 1/2. So the correct option is I.

The probability that the fourth child is male is determined by the fact that each birth is an independent event with a 50% chance of being male and 50% chance of being female. The gender of the previous three children does not influence the outcome of the fourth. Therefore, the probability remains 1/2.
