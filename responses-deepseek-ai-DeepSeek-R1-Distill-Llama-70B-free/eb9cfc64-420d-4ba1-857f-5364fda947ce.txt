Question:

A state law provides for an award of damages against anyone who publishes the name of a rape victim. Pursuant to that law, a woman sued a local newspaper in state court after the newspaper identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected the claim, holding that the state law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The state supreme court affirmed, holding specifically: "We think that this well-intentioned law very likely violates the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. We need not, however, decide that issue, because the law assuredly violates our state constitution, which provides even greater protection to the right of the press to report the news." The woman petitioned for review in the U.S. Supreme Court. Is the U.S. Supreme Court likely to review the state supreme court judgment?

Options:

A: No, because the woman already had the opportunity to present her case in the state courts.
B: No, because the First Amendment prohibits the imposition of liability for the publication of truthful information.
C: Yes, because the state supreme court made a constitutional error in its judgment.
D: No, because the U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review cases involving state laws.
E: No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.
F: Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to review decisions of state supreme courts.
G: No, because the state supreme court's judgment was based on its interpretation of its own state's constitution.
H: Yes, because the First Amendment rights of the press are at stake.
I: Yes, because the supremacy clause does not permit a state to create rights greater than those conferred by the federal Constitution.
J: Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to cases arising under federal law.

Okay, let's try to figure out this multiple-choice question. Hmm, so the question is about whether the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to review a state supreme court judgment. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's a state law that allows damages against anyone who publishes a rape victim's name. A woman sued a newspaper under this law because they identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected her claim, saying the law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment. The state supreme court affirmed, but specifically said that while the law might violate the First Amendment, it definitely violates the state constitution, which gives more protection to press freedom. Now, the woman is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for review. The question is whether the Supreme Court is likely to take the case.

The options are from A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the U.S. Supreme Court has discretionary review, meaning they choose which cases to take. They typically take cases where there's a federal question, especially if there's a possible error in handling federal law issues. Also, I recall something about adequate and independent state grounds. If a state court decision is based on state law that's independent and adequate, the Supreme Court won't review it because they can't change the state law interpretation.

In this case, the state supreme court said the law violates the state constitution, which provides greater protection than the First Amendment. They mentioned they didn't need to decide the federal issue because the state issue was enough. So the judgment rests on state law grounds.

The woman is the petitioner, so she's probably arguing that the state supreme court erred in interpreting the First Amendment. But since the state court didn't definitively decide the federal issue, only the state one, the Supreme Court might decline review.

Looking at the options. Option E says no because the judgment rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground. That sounds right. The state court based their decision on the state constitution, which is an independent ground. So under Supreme Court precedent, like in Michigan v. Long, if the state decision is supported by adequate and independent state grounds, the Court won't review it.

Option B suggests the First Amendment prohibits liability for publishing truthful info. But that's not necessarily the case here because the decision was based on state law, so the federal issue wasn't fully addressed.

Options F and J talk about the Court's power. While technically the Court can review state court decisions, they usually don't when there's an independent state ground.

Option G says no because it's based on state constitution interpretation. That's similar to E but maybe not the exact standard. The key is whether it's an adequate and independent ground, which E mentions.

So the answer should be E. The Court won't review because the state's decision is based on state law, so it's an adequate and independent ground.

The U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to review the state supreme court's judgment because the decision rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground. The state supreme court based its ruling on the state constitution, which provides greater protection to press freedom than the First Amendment. Since the judgment is supported by an independent state-law ground, the Supreme Court will typically decline review under the doctrine established in cases like *Michigan v. Long*. 

The correct answer is E.

E
