Okay, so I have this physics problem here about prisms and their mean deviations and dispersions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about a crown prism and a flint prism. Both have an apex angle of 10 degrees. The indices of refraction are given: crown is 1.508 and flint is 1.620. Also, the dispersive powers are provided—crown has .018 and flint .031.

I remember that the mean deviation (or the angle of deviation) for a prism depends on the refractive index and the apex angle. The formula for the mean deviation is something like (n-1) multiplied by the apex angle. Oh wait, right! The formula is mean deviation δ = (n - 1) * α, where α is the apex angle. So both prisms have the same α, so the one with a higher n should have a higher mean deviation.

Looking at the indices, flint glass is 1.620 and crown is 1.508. So flint's mean deviation should be higher than crown's. Let me calculate that.

For flint: (1.620 - 1) * 10 = 0.620 * 10 = 6.20 degrees.
For crown: (1.508 - 1) *10 = 0.508 *10 = 5.08 degrees.

Wait no, wait—does that formula give the angle in degrees? Yeah, I think so because the apex angle is in degrees. So flint has 6.20°, crown has 5.08°.

Now, the dispersion. Dispersion is the spread of the light, the difference between the deviations for different wavelengths—like how much the colors spread. The formula for dispersion (Δδ) is given by the dispersive power (ω) multiplied by the apex angle. So Δδ = ω * α.

The dispersive powers are given as crown .018 and flint .031.

So for flint: Δδ = 0.031 *10 = 0.31? Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the dispersions are in degrees, but the given ω is unitless. So if I multiply 0.031 by 10°, I get 0.31°. But looking at the options, I don't see 0.31. Let me check the options again.

Wait, let me read the options. Option F says for flint, dispersion 0.031. Hmm, wait no, let me look. Option I says flint has dispersion 0.091°, which is 0.091. Wait, where am I getting this.

Oh wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Because the dispersive power ω is defined as (n_F - n_C), where F and C are the Fraunhofer lines. So the formula for dispersion (Δδ) is ω * α. So for each prism, the dispersion is their respective ω multiplied by 10 degrees.

So for crown: 0.018 *10 = 0.18°, and flint: 0.031*10=0.31°. Wait, but looking at the options, none have 0.31. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check.

Crown: 0.018 *10 = 0.18°, so 0.18 degrees.
Flint: 0.031 *10 = 0.31 degrees.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option F: Flint dispersion 0.031°, which is 0.031. But that would only be if α is 1°, but no, the apex is 10°. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the dispersion is in arcminutes or something else? Or perhaps the formula uses a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the angular dispersion as (ω) * (apex angle in degrees). So that's what I did, but let's see if any options match.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Flint dispersion 0.192°, Crown 0.091°. That doesn't match.

Option F: Flint dispersion 0.031°, Crown 0.018°. That would be if the apex was 1°, but it's 10°, so no.

Option I: Flint dispersion 0.091°, Crown 0.192°. No, opposite.

Option E: Flint dispersion 0.200°, Crown 0.080°. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean deviation. Let me recheck.

Mean deviation for flint: (1.62 - 1) *10 = 0.62 *10 = 6.2°, that's correct. Crown is 1.508-1=0.508 →5.08°. So flint mean deviation is higher, 6.2°, crown is 5.08°.

Now, the dispersions: 0.18° for crown, 0.31° for flint. But none of the options seem to have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dispersive power as ω = (nF - nC), which is correct. So the dispersion would be ω * α, which is what I did.

So looking for an option where:

Flint: mean deviation 6.2°, dispersion 0.31°.

Crown: mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.18°.

But looking through the options, I don't see that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let's look at the options again.

Option F: Flint: mean deviation 6.50°, dispersion 0.031°. Crown: 5.00°, 0.018°. So that's not matching my numbers.

Option I: Flint mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.091°. Crown 6.20°, 0.192°. No, that swaps the mean deviations.

Wait, perhaps I got the dispersive power and refractive index mixed. Oh wait, dispersive power is given as crown 0.018, flint 0.031. So flint has higher dispersion, which matches.

Looking at the options:

Option I: Flint has dispersion 0.091°, which is 0.031* (approx 3). Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps the units are different. Maybe the dispersive power is in another unit, like per radian or something. No, I think it's just a relative measure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (n -1 ) * α for mean deviation, which I did. So I'm confident that the mean deviations are 6.2 and 5.08.

Looking for an option where flint has 6.2°, and crown 5.08°, and dispersion for flint is higher.

Looking again, option I: Flint has mean deviation 5.08°, which isn't right. Option B: Flint mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.192°. That's possible because 0.192 is 0.192°, which would be ω=0.0192 per degree. Wait, but flint's ω is 0.031. So 0.031 *10=0.31, which is not 0.192.

So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait another thought: Maybe the formula for mean deviation uses the average of the two refractive indices for each glass, but no, the mean deviation is calculated using the average refractive index. But wait, no, the mean deviation is given by (n -1) * α, where n is the refractive index for the mean wavelength (like sodium D line). So the given n for crown and flint are presumably for that line, so my initial calculation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the dispersive power is (n_F - n_C), but their values are given as 0.018 and 0.031. So for each prism, the dispersion is ω * α.

Wait, 0.018 *10 = 0.18°, and 0.031*10=0.31°. Now, looking for an option where:

Flint: mean deviation 6.2°, dispersion 0.31°.

Crown: 5.08°, 0.18°.

But none of the options match exactly. Let me check all options again.

Option F: Flint: mean deviation 6.50°, dispersion 0.031°. Hmm, that's the ω value, not multiplied by apex. So if apex is 10, 0.031*10=0.31. So 0.031 would be for a 1° prism.

Option I: Flint mean deviation 5.08°, which is lower than my calculation. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean deviation formula. Maybe it's (n-1) multiplied by the apex angle divided by 2, because the prism extends over two faces?

Wait no, the formula for deviation for a prism is δ = (n-1)*α, when the light enters and exits normally. So that's correct.

Hmmm. Let me look at the options again.

Option I: Flint mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.091°. Crown: 6.20°, 0.192°. So that would imply the mean deviations are swapped.

Option B: Flint: 6.20°, dispersion 0.192°; Crown:5.08°, 0.091°. So that matches the mean deviations I calculated. But the dispersion from the calculation is crown 0.18°, flint 0.31°. But in option B, the crown's dispersion is 0.091°, which is lower than what I calculated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up which glass has which dispersive power. Let me double-check the question. The dispersive powers are given as crown: 0.018, flint: 0.031. So, yes, flint has higher dispersion.

So for flint, dispersion is 0.31°, and for crown 0.18°.

Looking at the options, none of the options match these exactly. But let's see the closest ones.

Option F: Flint: mean deviation 6.50°, dispersion 0.031°. Crown:5.00°, 0.018°. So that can't be—dispersions are too low.

Option I: Flint:5.08°, 0.091°. Crown:6.20°, 0.192°. So the dispersions here are 0.091 and 0.192. But according to our calculation, flint's dispersion should be higher than crown's. So 0.192 (crown) is higher than 0.091 (flint) in option I. But that's opposite, because flint has higher ω.

Wait, perhaps I have the dispersive power backwards. Oh wait, the question says dispersive powers for crown and flint are 0.018 and 0.031, respectively. So crown is lower in ω than flint. So flint's dispersion should be higher than crown's.

Looking again at the options—option B has flint dispersion 0.192°, which is higher than crown's 0.091°. So that's correct in terms of flint higher than crown.

But according to our calculation, flint's dispersion should be 0.31°, which is 0.31. But in option B, it's 0.192°. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the dispersive power is given as (n_d - 1) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about angular dispersion in radians? No, the options are in degrees.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the mean deviation is in a different way. Another approach: the formula for the deviation of a prism when the light is incident perpendicularly is δ = (n-1) * α. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the dispersive power is (n_F - n_C), which is given, so the angular dispersion is (n_F - n_C) * α. So for crown, (n_F -n_C) is 0.018, so 0.018 *10=0.18°. For flint, 0.031*10=0.31°.

So looking for an option where:

Flint: mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.31°.

Crown: mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.18°.

Looking through the options, none of them have exactly 0.18 and 0.31.

Wait, perhaps the options present the dispersions as (n_F -n_C) without multiplying by the apex angle? But that doesn't make sense because the question says "mean deviations and dispersions produced by a prism of apex angle 10°", so the dispersions should be in degrees, which is the product.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I has flint with 0.091°, which is 0.031 * 3, but that's not matching 10. Maybe the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

Mean deviation for flint: (1.620-1) *10 = 6.20°.

Dispersion for flint: 0.031 *10=0.31°.

So I need an option where flint has mean deviation 6.2° and dispersion 0.31°. But I don't see any option like that.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B, which has flint:6.20°, dispersion 0.192°.

Wait, 0.192 is 0.192°, which is 0.192. 0.192 divided by 10 is 0.0192. But flint's ω is 0.031, so that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something about the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mean deviation formula is (n -1) * (α/2), because the apex angle is the sum of the base angles, and the deviation is calculated as (n-1)* (each base angle), which would sum to (n-1)*α.

Wait no, wait. The apex angle is the angle at the vertex, and the deviation is (n-1)*α. So that's correct. So for 10°, it's (n-1)*10.

Wait, perhaps the dispersive power is given as (n_d -n_F), but that doesn't change the calculation since both are higher in flint.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for (n-1) multiplied by the apex angle for mean deviation, and the dispersive power itself is the dispersion, but that doesn't make sense because the dispersive power is a material property and the dispersion would depend on the prism's angle.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me look for an option where flint's mean deviation is higher than crown's, and flint's dispersion is higher.

Looking at option F: Flint mean deviation 6.50°, which is higher than crown's 5.00°, but dispersion is 0.031°, which is lower than crown's. So that can't be right because flint has higher ω.

Option I: Flint has lower mean deviation (5.08) than crown (6.20), which is opposite, so that's wrong.

Option B: Flint:6.20°, dispersion 0.192°; Crown:5.08°, 0.091°. So both deviations and dispersions are higher for flint, which matches. But according to my calculations, the dispersions should be 0.31 and 0.18. But the option B has 0.192 and 0.091, which are smaller.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the numbers. Let me recheck.

Wait, the dispersive power for crown is 0.018 and flint 0.031.

So, for crown: 0.018*10=0.18°.

Flint:0.031*10=0.31°.

Looking for flint:0.31°, crown:0.18°.

So the options don't have exactly that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mean deviation.

Wait, maybe the mean deviation is calculated differently. Another thought: perhaps the formula is (n-1) * (α/2), but that would give half the angle. But I don't think that's correct. Because the apex angle is the total angle, and the deviation is (n-1)*α. So the initial calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the given dispersive powers are not to be multiplied by the apex angle. But that doesn't make sense because the dispersion depends on the prism's angle.

Hmm... Maybe the problem is that the options are using a different formula, such as for minimum deviation when the prism is used in a different setup. But I think the question is straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the angular dispersion as a fraction of the apex angle, but that doesn't fit the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers in the options are approximate.

Wait, let me look for an option where flint has a mean deviation near 6.2° and dispersion near 0.31. But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps the closest is option I, but that has the mean deviations swapped.

Wait, looking back, option F: Flint:6.50°, dispersion 0.031°. Crown:5.00°, 0.018°. So the dispersion is just the dispersive power, not multiplied by apex. But that would mean the apex is 1°, which it isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the dispersive power (ω) itself, not the actual dispersion. But the question says 'dispersion produced by a prism', which would imply the actual angular spread, which should be ω * alpha.

Wait, looking at option F again: flint's dispersion is 0.031°, which is the same as the dispersive power given (0.031). So perhaps someone forgot to multiply by the apex angle. But then, that would be incorrect.

Another approach: perhaps the answer's mean deviations and dispersions are for some other setup, but I think I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the mean deviation is in minutes of arc, but the options are in degrees. But no, the options clearly say 0.091°, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean deviation calculation. Let me recheck:

Flint: n=1.620 → (1.62-1)=0.62. 0.62 *10=6.2°. Correct. Crown:1.508-1=0.508 →5.08°.

So the mean deviations are correct.

Now, the disp
