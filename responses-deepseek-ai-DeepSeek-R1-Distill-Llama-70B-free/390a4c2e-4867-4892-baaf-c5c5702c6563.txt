Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty in the L_z component of a hydrogen atom's stationary state, specifically the 2p_z state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through this.

Alright, the question is asking for the uncertainty ΔL_z. From what I remember, in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle applies here. Oh wait, right, the angular momentum uncertainty. So for the z-component of angular momentum, L_z, the uncertainty is related to the possible values it can take.

The state given is 2p_z. Wait, p_z probably refers to the magnetic quantum number m_l. Or is it the orbital? Oh, right, in the notation, the letters like s, p, d correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. So s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, etc. So 2p would mean n=2 (principal quantum number), and l=1.

So the state is 2p_z. Wait, actually, the subscript z might indicate the direction of the angular momentum vector. So in the p_z state, the angular momentum is quantized along the z-axis, which means that the m_l value is specific.

Wait, no, wait. The magnetic quantum number m_l can take values from -l to +l in integer steps. For l=1, m_l can be -1, 0, +1. So the p orbital has three states: m_l = -1, 0, +1. Oh, but when we say 2p_z, perhaps that refers to the state where m_l is +1? Or is it aligned along z, meaning maximum m_l?

Wait, I think that when the state is labeled as p_z, it's the state with m_l = +1. Because, for the p orbitals, the m_l values are -1, 0, +1. The p_z orbital is the one where the angular momentum is aligned along the z-axis, so m_l is +1. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the state is in a definite m_l state, like m_l=1.

So if the state is 2p_z, then the quantum numbers are n=2, l=1, m_l=1. Because the z subscript usually refers to the orientation, meaning maximum m_l.

Wait, but wait a second. The uncertainty principle for angular momentum says that the uncertainties in different components are related. For L_z, the uncertainty ΔL_z is given by the standard deviation when you measure L_z in that state.

If the state is an eigenstate of L_z, then the uncertainty would be zero, right? Because if the state is an eigenstate, every measurement would yield the same value, so the uncertainty is zero. But wait, wait—what's the state here?

Wait, the 2p_z state. So, is this state an eigenstate of L_z? Let me think. In the hydrogen atom, the stationary states are eigenstates of L² and L_z. So the state is |n, l, m_l> = |2,1,1>. Therefore, L_z acting on this state would give m_l ħ times the state. So yes, it's an eigenstate of L_z. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔL_z is zero.

Wait, but wait again. The uncertainty is calculated using the expectation values. The formula for uncertainty is sqrt(<L_z²> - <L_z>²). Since the state is an eigenstate, <L_z> is m_l ħ, and <L_z²> is (m_l ħ)^2, because L_z |m> = mħ |m>, so L_z² |m> = m² ħ² |m>. Therefore, <L_z²> = m² ħ², so the uncertainty is sqrt(m² ħ² - (m ħ)^2) which is zero. So ΔL_z is zero.

Therefore, the correct answer should be G, which is 0. Let me check the options: G is 0.

Wait, but am I mixing things up? Let me think again. Oh wait, no, in the p_z state, the state is an eigenstate of L_z, so the uncertainty is zero. So the answer is G.

The problem asks for the uncertainty in the z-component of angular momentum, $\Delta L_z$, for the hydrogen-atom stationary state $2p_z$. In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates to the standard deviation of measurements of an observable. For $L_z$, the uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta L_z = \sqrt{\langle L_z^2 \rangle - \langle L_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The state $2p_z$ corresponds to the quantum numbers $n=2$, $l=1$, and $m_l=1$. This state is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator, meaning that $L_z$ acting on this state yields a definite value: $L_z |2,1,1\rangle = m_l \hbar |2,1,1\rangle = \hbar |2,1,1\rangle$. Therefore, $\langle L_z \rangle = \hbar$ and $\langle L_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2$. Substituting these into the formula for $\Delta L_z$:

\[
\Delta L_z = \sqrt{\hbar^2 - (\hbar)^2} = 0.
\]

Since the state $2p_z$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$, the uncertainty in $L_z$ is zero. Thus, the correct answer is:

G: 0.
