Okay, so I have this problem here about a map scale, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: "A certain map uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles. How many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map?" And there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, alright, so I'm a bit rusty on map scales, but I remember that scale tells you how much real distance is represented by a certain distance on the map. So here, 1 inch on the map stands for 25 miles in real life.

The question is asking for 5 inches. So I think I need to set up a proportion or maybe just a simple multiplication. Let me think. If 1 inch is 25 miles, then 5 inches would be 5 times that, right?

So 1 inch = 25 miles. Therefore, 5 inches would be 5 * 25 miles. Let me calculate that. 25 multiplied by 5 is 125. So that would be 125 miles.

Looking at the options, option H is 125. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Sometimes scales can be tricky. Oh wait, no, this seems straightforward. It's a direct proportion. Each inch adds another 25 miles. So 5 inches would just be 5 times more. Yeah, I'm confident it's 125 miles.

The map scale indicates that 1 inch represents 25 miles. To find the distance represented by 5 inches, multiply 25 miles by 5, resulting in 125 miles.

Answer: H
