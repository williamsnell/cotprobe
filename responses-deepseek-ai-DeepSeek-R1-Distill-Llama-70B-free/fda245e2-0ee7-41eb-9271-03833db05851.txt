Okay, so I have this physics problem here about ultrasonic transducers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says the transducer oscillates at 6.7 MHz, and we need to find out how long each oscillation takes and the angular frequency. The options are given as letters A to J with various numbers. The units for the angular frequency are in 10^7 rad/s.

Wait, right. So the first part is about the period of each oscillation, and the second part is about angular frequency. I remember that frequency and period are related inversely. The formula that comes to mind is T = 1/f. Oh, right, because frequency is how many cycles per second, so the period is one over that.

But wait, the given frequency is in MHz. So 6.7 MHz is 6.7 million hertz. Converting that to Hz would be 6,700,000 Hz, because mega is 10^6. So 6.7e6 Hz.

So the period T is 1 divided by 6.7e6. Let me calculate that. 1 / 6.7e6 = approximately 1.4925e-7 seconds. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 6.7 million is 6,700,000. 1 divided by 6.7 million. Yeah, that's about 1.49e-7 seconds. But wait, the options here are numbers without units. Oh, wait the question says the unit for angular frequency is 1e7 rad/s, but for the period, it's just in seconds, I think.

Wait the question asks how long each oscillation takes, which is the period T. So T is 1.49e-7 seconds. But looking at the options, I don't see anything like that. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to express it in a different unit? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait another thought: Maybe the answer is presented as the period in terms of microseconds or something else? Because 1.49e-7 seconds is 149 nanoseconds, or 0.149 microseconds. But the options don't have numbers that small. Wait, looking at the options, the numbers are like 5.3, 1.5, 4.2, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the angular frequency first. Angular frequency ω is 2π times the frequency f. So ω = 2πf.

Given f is 6.7 MHz, which is 6.7e6 Hz. So ω = 2 * π * 6.7e6. Let me compute that. 2 * 3.1416 is approximately 6.2832. So 6.2832 * 6.7e6 equals... let's see. 6.2832 * 6.7 is about 42.03, so 42.03e6 rad/s. Because 6.7e6 times 6.2832 is 42.03e6.

Wait, but the question says the unit is 10^7 rad/s. So 42.03e6 rad/s is equal to 4.203e7 rad/s. Because 1e7 is 10^7. So 42.03e6 is 4.203 * 10^7. Which is 4.203 in terms of 10^7.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.2, which is close to 4.203. So that would be the angular frequency part.

But wait, the question also asks for the time of each oscillation. So the first part is the period T. So T is 1/(6.7e6) ≈ 1.4925e-7 seconds. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the options are in different units. Wait, the question says the unit for angular frequency is 1e7 rad/s. So the second part is 4.2e7 rad/s, which would correspond to option C: 4.2.

Wait, but the question says "how long does each oscillation take, and what is the angular frequency?" So it's asking for two values. But the options are single letters, each with a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, perhaps the answer expects two values, but the options are only for the angular frequency? Or perhaps the options pair the period and the angular frequency.

Wait looking again, the options are labeled A through J, each with a single number. The question says to select from A to J, so each option corresponds to a single number. But the question has two parts: the period and the angular frequency. So perhaps the options are only for one of them, but the question requires both.

Wait, the user instruction says "selecting from the answer A through to J." So perhaps each option is a possible answer for the pair of values, but that doesn't make sense because each option is a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the angular frequency, but the wording says both.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the period in a specific unit. Let me double-check. The problem states the unit for angular frequency is 1e7 rad/s. So the angular frequency is to be expressed in terms of 1e7 rad/s.

Wait, let's go back. The given frequency is 6.7 MHz, which is 6.7e6 Hz. So:

Period T = 1/f = 1/(6.7e6) ≈ 1.4925e-7 seconds. If I convert this into nanoseconds, it's about 149.25 nanoseconds, which is 0.149 microseconds. But none of the options match this.

Alternatively, maybe the period is expressed in terms of 1e-7 seconds (1e-7 s is 0.1 microseconds). So 1.4925e-7 s is approximately 1.49 x 1e-7 s. But the options are like 5.3, 1.5, etc. I don't see 1.49 as an option. Unless perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate T.

f = 6.7 MHz = 6.7e6 Hz.

T = 1/f = 1 / 6.7e6 = approximately 0.14925e-6 seconds. Because 1e6 /6.7 is about 0.149.

Wait, 0.149e-6 seconds is 149e-9 seconds, so 149 nanoseconds. But again, the options don't have anything close.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the units again. The problem says the unit for angular frequency is 1e7 rad/s. So when I calculated ω, I got approximately 4.2e7 rad/s, which is 4.2 when expressed in 1e7 rad/s units. So the angular frequency is 4.2, which is option C.

But what about the period? The options don't seem to have 1.49e-7. Maybe the question is only asking for the angular frequency, and the period is a distractor. Or perhaps I need to reconsider the units for the period.

Wait, perhaps the period is being asked in terms of microseconds. Let's see: 1.49e-7 seconds is 0.149 microseconds, which is 149 nanoseconds. Hmm, 0.149 is about 0.15, but looking at the options, the closest is B:1.5, but that's 1.5. Alternatively, maybe it's expressed as 149 ns, which is 1.49 x 1e-7 s. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the problem is only giving one correct answer, and I'm supposed to pick which one fits. So T is 1.49e-7 s, which is about 1.5e-7 s. Looking at the options, option B is 1.5. So perhaps that's the answer for the period. Then the angular frequency would be about 4.2, which is option C.

Wait wait, but the question says "how long does each oscillation take, and what is the angular frequency?" So two answers. But the options are single letters. Unless the options are for the angular frequency only, and the period is extra info. Or perhaps the problem is structured so that the first part (period) is in the options, but the second part (angular frequency) is another option. But the options are given as A through J, each with a single number. So perhaps the question is only asking for the angular frequency.

Wait, looking again, the question is phrased as: "How long does each oscillation take, and what is the angular frequency?" So it's two questions. But the options are single numbers. So I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended only one of them, but the problem states both.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the angular frequency, and the T is extra. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for the product of T and ω. Because T is 1.49e-7 s, ω is 4.2e7 rad/s. Multiplying them would give approximately 6.228, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the period in terms of 1e-7 seconds. Let's see, T=1.49e-7 s is 1.49 x 1e-7 s. So in terms of 1e-7, it's 1.49. The closest option is A:5.3, which doesn't fit. Or perhaps option B is 1.5, which is close to 1.49.

Wait, option B is 1.5. So perhaps for the period, the answer is 1.5e-7 s, which is 1.5 x 1e-7 s. But my calculation gave 1.49e-7, which is approximately 1.5e-7. So option B for the period.

The angular frequency is about 4.2e7 rad/s, which is 4.2 in terms of 1e7. So option C.

But the options are single letters, so perhaps the correct answer is C for the angular frequency, and B for the period. But since the question asks for both, but the options are single letters, perhaps the problem expects one of them, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for two answers but the user's instruction is to select one option. Therefore, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is only asking for the angular frequency, and the period is a red herring. Or perhaps the question is structured so that the correct answers for both are among the options, and the correct letter has both parts.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem as giving the period in terms of 1e-7 seconds. So T = 1.49e-7 s is 1.49 units of 1e-7 s. So in terms of 1e-7, that's approximately 1.5.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.5. So perhaps the period is 1.5 x1e-7 s, which is option B.

The angular frequency is 4.2 x1e7 rad/s, which is option C.

So the two answers would be B and C. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the correct answer is B and C. However, the options are presented as individual letters, so maybe the question is only asking for one of them.

Wait, the question says "how long does each oscillation take, and what is the angular frequency?" So perhaps the correct answer combines both. But the options are single numbers, so perhaps the intended answer is the angular frequency, which is option C:4.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the angular frequency, and the period is a distractor. So I think the angular frequency is 4.2e7 rad/s, so option C.

But I'm a bit confused because the question seems to ask for both, but the options are single letters. Maybe the intended answer is option C for the angular frequency.

The problem involves an ultrasonic transducer oscillating at 6.7 MHz. To determine the period \( T \) and angular frequency \( \omega \), the following calculations are performed:

1. **Frequency Conversion**: The given frequency is \( f = 6.7 \, \text{MHz} = 6.7 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \).

2. **Period Calculation**: The period \( T \) is the reciprocal of the frequency:
   \[
   T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{6.7 \times 10^6} \approx 1.4925 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
   \]
   In terms of \( 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \), \( T \approx 1.49 \), which is closest to option **B: 1.5**.

3. **Angular Frequency Calculation**: The angular frequency \( \omega \) is given by:
   \[
   \omega = 2 \pi f = 2 \pi (6.7 \times 10^6) \approx 42.03 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad/s}.
   \]
   In terms of \( 10^7 \, \text{rad/s} \), \( \omega \approx 4.2 \), which corresponds to option **C: 4.2**.

The question asks for both the period and the angular frequency, but the options are single values. Since the angular frequency is explicitly requested in the unit \( 10^7 \, \text{rad/s} \), the most relevant answer is **C: 4.2**.

Answer: C
