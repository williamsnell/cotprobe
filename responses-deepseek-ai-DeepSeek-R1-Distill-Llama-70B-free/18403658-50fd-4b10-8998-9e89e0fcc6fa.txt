Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about bystander intervention. The question is asking about the number of bystanders present that makes it most likely someone in an emergency will receive help. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember learning about the bystander effect in psychology. From what I recall, the bystander effect suggests that the more people present, the less likely any individual is to help. This is because when there are more people around, each person assumes someone else will take responsibility, so they don't feel personally responsible.

Wait, but the question here is the opposite. It's asking when a person is most likely to get help. So if the bystander effect says that more people lead to less help, then the opposite would be when there are fewer people. So maybe the smaller the number of bystanders, the higher the chance of help.

I think the classic example is Kitty Genovese's murder, where many people heard her scream but didn't help, possibly because each thought someone else would. That case is often cited to explain the bystander effect.

So in experiments, I think the findings were that help is more likely when there are fewer bystanders. Like, if someone is alone, they're more likely to help. But wait, what's the exact number? The question gives options, and the numbers go up to ten.

I remember reading that when there's only one bystander, the likelihood of help is highest. But let me think deeper. The question is about the most likely scenario. So if only one person is present, they can't diffuse responsibility, so they're more likely to act.

Wait, but the options include one (option E). So the correct answer should be E: one. Because with just one bystander, that person feels fully responsible and thus more likely to help.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, in some situations, having a couple of people might help because they can discuss or encourage each other. But I think that's more about the diffusion of responsibility being less when there are fewer people. So with one person, the responsibility is all on them, so they act.

Yes, I think the correct answer is E: one.

The bystander effect suggests that the likelihood of an individual receiving help in an emergency decreases as the number of bystanders increases. This is due to diffusion of responsibility, where each person assumes someone else will take action. Conversely, when there are fewer bystanders, the sense of personal responsibility increases, making help more likely. Research indicates that the highest likelihood of help occurs when there is only one bystander, as they cannot diffuse responsibility and are more likely to act. 

Answer: E
