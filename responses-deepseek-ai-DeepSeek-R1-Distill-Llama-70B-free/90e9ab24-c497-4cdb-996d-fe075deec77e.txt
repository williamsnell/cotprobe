Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer between two pieces of copper. Hmm, I remember that when two objects are in contact, the heat flows from the hotter to the cooler until they reach the same temperature. Right, that's thermal equilibrium.

Alright, let me read the question again. There are two 50 kg pieces of copper. One is at 175°C, and the other is at 40°C. They come into contact, and we need to find the final temperature and the amount of heat transferred. The formula given is q = m*C_p*ΔT, where C_p is 385 J/kg·K.

Wait, okay, so both pieces are copper, so they have the same specific heat capacity. That should make things easier. Since they're in contact, the heat lost by the hotter one should equal the heat gained by the cooler one. But wait, actually, when you have two objects, the heat lost by the hotter is equal to the heat gained by the cooler. So, the total heat transfer is the amount that brings them to the same temperature.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's denote the final temperature as T_f. So, the hot piece (175°C) will lose heat, and its temperature will drop to T_f. The cold piece (40°C) will gain heat, and its temperature will rise to T_f.

So for the hot piece, the change in temperature is (175 - T_f). For the cold piece, it's (T_f - 40). Since they have the same mass and specific heat, the heat lost by the hot should equal the heat gained by the cold. So:

m * C_p * (175 - T_f) = m * C_p * (T_f - 40)

Wait, but since the masses are the same, and C_p is the same, they can actually cancel out. So 175 - T_f = T_f - 40. Let me solve for T_f.

175 +40 = 2*T_f → 215 = 2T_f → T_f = 107.5°C. Oh wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option H is 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ. So that's looking promising for the temperature.

Now, the next part is the heat transferred. Let's compute the heat for one of the pieces. Let's take the hot one. The heat lost is m*C_p*(175 - T_f).

So plugging in the numbers: mass is 50 kg, C_p is 385 J/kg·K. The change in T is 175 - 107.5 = 67.5°C.

Calculating q: 50 kg * 385 J/kg·K * 67.5 K. Let me compute that. 50 * 385 = 19,250. 19,250 * 67.5.

Wait, 19,250 multiplied by 67.5. Let me break it down. 19,250 * 60 = 1,155,000. 19,250 *7.5 = 144,375. So total is 1,155,000 + 144,375 = 1,299,375 J. Which is 1,299.375 kJ. Oh wait, that's about 1299.4 kJ.

But wait, the formula q = mC_p ΔT would give the heat lost by the hot object, which is positive. But the question says "the amount of heat transferred between the two pieces." Hmm, in thermodynamics, heat lost is considered negative and heat gained is positive. But when considering the heat flow from one to the other, the total would be the same in magnitude but opposite in sign. Alternatively, depending on which perspective you take.

Wait, in the options, the heat is given as a negative number. So for example, option H is -1299.4 kJ. So that would make sense because the heat is leaving the hot piece, so q would be negative for the hot piece. But wait, when considering the system of both pieces, the total heat is zero. But the question is about the heat transferred between them, so perhaps they take the perspective of one piece.

But the question says, "the amount of heat transferred between the two pieces of copper." So for each piece, the heat is +/- 1299.375 kJ. So the magnitude is 1299.375 kJ, but the direction depends on which piece you're looking at. But the options have negative values. So I think the correct answer should have q as negative, perhaps from the hot to the cold.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H has -1299.4 kJ. So that would be for the hot piece losing that amount. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the heat transferred as the amount lost by the hot piece, which would be a negative value.

So putting it all together, the final temperature is 107.5°C, and the heat transferred is -1299.4 kJ. So the correct option is H.

To solve the problem, we analyze the heat transfer between two 50 kg pieces of copper, one initially at 175°C and the other at 40°C, until they reach thermal equilibrium. The heat flow is governed by the formula:

\[
q = mC_p\Delta T
\]

where \( m = 50 \, \text{kg} \), \( C_p = 385 \, \text{J/kg·K} \), and \( \Delta T \) is the temperature change. Since the two pieces of copper have the same mass and specific heat capacity, the heat lost by the hotter piece equals the heat gained by the cooler piece:

\[
mC_p(175 - T_f) = mC_p(T_f - 40)
\]

Canceling \( mC_p \) from both sides:

\[
175 - T_f = T_f - 40
\]

Solving for \( T_f \):

\[
175 + 40 = 2T_f \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_f = 107.5^\circ \text{C}
\]

Next, we calculate the heat transferred. Using the hotter piece (175°C to 107.5°C):

\[
q = mC_p\Delta T = 50 \cdot 385 \cdot (175 - 107.5)
\]

\[
\Delta T = 67.5 \, \text{K}, \quad q = 50 \cdot 385 \cdot 67.5 = 1,299,375 \, \text{J} = 1,299.4 \, \text{kJ}
\]

Since the question specifies the heat transferred between the two pieces, the negative sign indicates heat lost by the hotter piece. Thus, the final temperature is \( 107.5^\circ \text{C} \), and the heat transferred is \( -1,299.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**H: 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ**
