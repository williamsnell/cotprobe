To solve the problem, we need to find the probability \( P\left(0 < x < \frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{3} < y < 2\right) \) given the joint density function \( f(x, y) = 6x^2y \) for \( 0 < x < 1 \) and \( 0 < y < 1 \), and zero elsewhere.

### Step 1: Understand the Limits
Since the joint density function is defined for \( 0 < x < 1 \) and \( 0 < y < 1 \), we need to adjust the given limits to stay within these bounds:
- For \( y \), the upper limit \( y = 2 \) exceeds the defined range, so we cap it at \( y = 1 \).
- The lower limit for \( y \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \), which is within the defined range.

Thus, the probability becomes:
\[
P\left(0 < x < \frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{3} < y < 1\right)
\]

### Step 2: Set Up the Double Integral
The probability is calculated by integrating the joint density function over the specified region:
\[
P = \int_{x=0}^{x=\frac{3}{4}} \int_{y=\frac{1}{3}}^{y=1} 6x^2y \, dy \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Inner Integral (with respect to \( y \))
First, integrate with respect to \( y \):
\[
\int_{\frac{1}{3}}^{1} 6x^2y \, dy = 6x^2 \int_{\frac{1}{3}}^{1} y \, dy = 6x^2 \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_{\frac{1}{3}}^{1}
\]
\[
= 6x^2 \left( \frac{1^2}{2} - \frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2}{2} \right) = 6x^2 \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{18} \right) = 6x^2 \left( \frac{9}{18} - \frac{1}{18} \right) = 6x^2 \cdot \frac{8}{18} = 6x^2 \cdot \frac{4}{9} = \frac{24x^2}{9} = \frac{8x^2}{3}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the Outer Integral (with respect to \( x \))
Now, integrate with respect to \( x \):
\[
P = \int_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}} \frac{8x^2}{3} \, dx = \frac{8}{3} \int_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}} x^2 \, dx = \frac{8}{3} \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}}
\]
\[
= \frac{8}{3} \left( \frac{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3}{3} - 0 \right) = \frac{8}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{64 \cdot 3} = \frac{8}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{192} = \frac{8 \cdot 27}{3 \cdot 192} = \frac{216}{576} = \frac{3}{8}
\]

### Final Answer
The probability is \( \frac{3}{8} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
