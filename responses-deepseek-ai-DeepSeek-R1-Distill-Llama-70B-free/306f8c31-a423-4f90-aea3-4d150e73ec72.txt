Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring a loop of 5 vertices with 3 colors, and I need to make sure that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Hmm, interesting. I remember that these kinds of problems are related to graph theory, specifically graph coloring. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the loop means it's a cycle, right? So it's a cycle graph with 5 nodes, C5. And I need to count the number of valid colorings using 3 colors where adjacent nodes are different. Oh right, this is a classic problem, and I think there's a formula for the number of colorings in a cycle.

I remember something about recurrence relations for linear chains and then adjusting for cycles. Let me try to recall. For a linear chain, like a path graph with n vertices, the number of colorings is 3 * 2^(n-1), because the first vertex can be colored in 3 ways, and each next one in 2 ways to avoid matching the previous.

But wait, for a cycle, it's a bit trickier because the first and last vertices are adjacent. So the formula must subtract the cases where the first and last are the same color. Alternatively, I think the formula for the number of proper colorings of a cycle graph Cn with k colors is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Let me check that.

Wait, maybe I should approach it using the concept of recurrence relations. For a cycle with n vertices, the number of colorings is equal to the number of colorings for a path of n vertices minus the number of colorings where the first and last vertices are the same. 

So, for a path of 5 vertices, it's 3 * 2^4 = 48. But for the cycle, we need to subtract the cases where the first and fifth are the same. How do we calculate that?

Alternatively, I think the formula for the number of proper colorings of a cycle graph is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So plugging in k=3 and n=5:

(3-1)^5 + (-1)^5*(3-1) = 2^5 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30. Oh wait, that would give me 30. But wait, let me make sure I got the formula right.

Another way I remember is using the chromatic polynomial. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph Cn is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for k=3, n=5:

(2)^5 + (-1)^5 * 2 = 32 -2 =30. So that would be 30 colorings. Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, but another approach is using recurrence. Let me think: for a cycle graph, the number of colorings is equal to the number of colorings for a path where the first and last are different. So for a path of n, it's 3 * 2^(n-1). But for a cycle, it's (number of colorings for path) minus (number where first and last are same).

So for the path with 5 vertices, it's 3 * 2^4 =48. Now, the number of colorings where the first and last are the same: the first is colored in 3, the last must match it. But since it's a loop, the last is adjacent to the fourth and first. So perhaps we can model this as a recurrence.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle. For a cycle, the total is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Since n=5 is odd, it would be (2)^5 -2 =30. So that would give 30, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. I've also heard about using the formula for the number of proper colorings for a cycle, which is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for even n, it's (k-1)^n + (k-1), and for odd n, it's (k-1)^n - (k-1). Let me plug in n=5, k=3:

(2)^5 - 2 =32-2=30. So yes, 30.

Looking back at the options, option C is 30. So the answer should be C.

To determine the number of ways to color a loop of 5 vertices (a cycle graph \( C_5 \)) with 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we use the formula for the number of proper colorings of a cycle graph. The formula is:

\[
(k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1)
\]

Here, \( k = 3 \) (the number of colors) and \( n = 5 \) (the number of vertices). Plugging in these values:

\[
(3-1)^5 + (-1)^5 (3-1) = 2^5 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of valid colorings is 30. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

C: 30
