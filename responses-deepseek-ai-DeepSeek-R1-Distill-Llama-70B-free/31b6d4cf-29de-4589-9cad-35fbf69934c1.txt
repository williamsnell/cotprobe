Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Earth's internal energy source. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about this in my geography or earth science class. The question is asking for the principal source, which means the main one.

The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A is solar radiation. Wait, solar radiation is what the Earth receives from the Sun, right? Like the sun's rays hitting the Earth. That's more about external energy, not internal. So probably not A.

Option B is electric currents. I'm not too sure about that. I don't recall electric currents being a main source of Earth's internal heat. Maybe it's something related to the Earth's magnetic field, but I don't think that's the primary source.

Option C is wind energy. Wind is caused by the sun heating the atmosphere unevenly, so again, that's an external factor. Not internal.

Option D is magnetic fields. I know the Earth has a magnetic field, but how does that generate internal energy? I think the magnetic field is more about protecting from solar wind and such, not so much generating heat inside the Earth.

Option E is thermal conduction. Thermal conduction is the transfer of heat, but that's a process, not a source. So it's not generating energy, just moving it around.

Option F is gravitational pressure. Gravity does work on the Earth, like how the planet's mass compresses the core. I've heard that during the Earth's formation, gravitational energy was stored, especially in the core. When the heavy elements like iron sank to the center, that process released a lot of energy. So this might contribute to internal heat.

Option G is tidal friction. Tidal forces from the Moon cause friction, which generates some heat. But I think this is a minor source compared to others. The main effect of tidal friction is slowing down the Earth's rotation, not being a major internal energy source.

Option H is geothermal heat. Wait, geothermal refers to the heat from the Earth. But isn't that the result, not the source? Like, the Earth's heat is what geothermal energy comes from, but the question is asking what's the source of that heat.

Option I is radioactivity. Oh right! I remember something about radioactive decay in the Earth's core and mantle. Elements like uranium and thorium have isotopes that decay, releasing heat over time. This process has been going on since the Earth formed and is a significant source of internal heat.

Option J is hydroelectric power. That's energy from moving water, which again is driven by external factors like precipitation and gravity, not an internal source.

So putting it all together, the main sources I'm considering are F (gravitational pressure) and I (radioactivity). I think gravitational energy was more important early on when the Earth was forming, like during accretion and differentiation. But now, a lot of the Earth's internal heat comes from radioactive decay. Because as time passes, the initial gravitational energy (like from the core formation) would have been released, but radioactive decay is an ongoing process that continues to generate heat.

Wait, but the question is about the principal source now, or in general? I think the Earth's current internal heat budget is mainly due to radioactive decay in the mantle and core. So the answer would be I.

Another point: I remember that without radioactivity, the Earth's heat would have been lost long ago, but because of radioactivity, it's still generating heat internally. So that's probably why the answer is I.

The principal source of Earth’s internal energy is determined by analyzing the given options:

- **A: Solar radiation** is an external energy source and not internal.
- **B: Electric currents** and **D: Magnetic fields** are not primary sources of internal heat.
- **C: Wind energy** and **J: Hydroelectric power** are driven by external factors like solar radiation and precipitation.
- **E: Thermal conduction** is a process of heat transfer, not a source.
- **F: Gravitational pressure** was significant during Earth's formation but is less so now.
- **G: Tidal friction** is a minor contributor compared to others.
- **H: Geothermal heat** is the result of internal energy, not the source.
- **I: Radioactivity** from elements like uranium and thorium is a continuous and significant source of internal heat.

Radioactive decay is the main ongoing process generating the Earth's internal heat, making it the principal source.

Answer: I
