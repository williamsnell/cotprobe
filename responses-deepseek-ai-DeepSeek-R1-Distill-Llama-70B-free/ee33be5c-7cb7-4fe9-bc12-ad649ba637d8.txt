Okay, so I need to find the median of this dataset: $79.88, $21.88, $29.88, $19.88, $17.88. Hmm, I remember that the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Let me think about the steps I should take.

First, I should probably list the numbers in order from smallest to largest. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right. The numbers are 79.88, 21.88, 29.88, 19.88, and 17.88. Wait, that's five numbers, so when I sort them, the third one should be the median since there are an odd number of data points.

Let me sort them. Starting with the smallest, I see 17.88 is the smallest. Then comes 19.88. Next would be 21.88. After that, 29.88. And the largest is 79.88. So the sorted list is: 17.88, 19.88, 21.88, 29.88, 79.88.

Now, since there are five numbers, the median is the third one. Counting them: first is 17.88, second is 19.88, third is 21.88. So the median should be $21.88.

Looking at the options, option H is $21.88. So the answer must be H.

The median is found by sorting the data and selecting the middle value. After sorting the given data, the third value is $21.88, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
