Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the cost of lumber. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the cost is $140 per 1,000 board feet. I need to find the charge for 300 pieces of lumber with specific dimensions. 

Wait, what's board feet? Oh right, board feet is a measure of volume. One board foot is 1 inch thick, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot long. Or wait, no, more accurately, it's the volume of a piece that's 1 ft by 1 ft by 1 inch, I think. Because 12 inches make a foot, so an inch is 1/12 of a foot.

So each piece of lumber here is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long. Oh, but wait, I should probably convert all measurements to feet to calculate the board feet correctly. Because the board foot is based on feet.

Let me break this down. Each piece's dimensions in feet would be:

Thickness: 2 inches is 2/12 feet, which simplifies to 1/6 feet.

Width: 6 inches is 6/12 feet, which is 0.5 feet or 1/2 feet.

Length: 12 feet stays as 12 feet.

So the volume of one piece is thickness * width * length. So that's (1/6) * (1/2) * 12.

Let me compute that. 1/6 times 1/2 is (1/12). Multiply by 12, the 12s cancel out, so 1. So each piece is 1 board foot.

Wait that can't be right. Wait, 2" is 1/6 ft, 6" is 0.5 ft, length 12 ft. So (2/12) * (6/12) * 12.

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step. 

(2 inches) is 2/12 = 1/6 ft.

(6 inches) is 6/12 = 1/2 ft.

Length is 12 ft.

Volume is (1/6) * (1/2) * 12. Let's compute that.

Multiplying 1/6 and 1/2 gives 1/12. Then 1/12 * 12 is 1. So each piece is 1 board foot. Oh, okay, so each of the 300 pieces is 1 board foot each. So total board feet is 300 * 1 = 300 board feet.

Wait, but the price is $140 per 1,000 board feet. So I need to find how much 300 board feet cost.

So 300 is 0.3 times 1,000. So 140 * 0.3 = $42. Because 140 * 0.3 is 42.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Let me think again. 300 board feet is 300/1000 = 0.3 of the 1,000 board feet unit. So the cost would be 140 * (300/1000) = 140 * 0.3 = 42 dollars.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see $42. Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating the board feet per piece.

Let me recheck the calculations. Maybe I messed up the dimensions.

Each piece is 2 inches thick, which is 2/12 = 1/6 ft. 6 inches wide is 6/12 = 1/2 ft. Length 12 ft.

So volume per piece: (1/6) * (1/2) * 12 = (1/12) * 12 = 1. So each is 1 board foot. So 300 pieces would be 300 board feet.

So 300/1000 is 0.3, times $140 is $42. But the options don't have $42. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the board feet. Let's recalculate.

Wait another approach: Board feet is calculated as (thickness in inches) * (width in inches) * (length in feet) divided by 12. Because 12 inches in a foot. So the formula is (t * w * l) / 12.

So for each piece: t=2, w=6, l=12. So (2*6*12)/12 = (144)/12 = 12. So each piece is 12 board feet.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because the formula is (t in inches) * (w in inches) * (length in feet) / 12. So for each piece, that's 2*6*12 = 144. Divided by 12 gives 12 board feet per piece.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So which one is correct?

I think I must have confused the initial approach. Let me clarify.

Board foot is a unit of volume, equal to 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 inch. So to compute the volume in board feet, you can take the dimensions in inches for thickness and width, but length in feet. So the formula is (t * w * l) / 12.

So for example, if a board is 1x1x1 inches, that's 1/12 of a board foot. So the formula (1 *1 * (1/12)) ) gives 1/12, but wait, no, because the length is in feet. So maybe I should convert the length to inches, then compute in cubic inches, and then convert to board feet.

Alternative approach:

Each board foot is 144 cubic inches (since 12"x12"x1" = 144 inÂ³).

So for each piece of lumber, compute its volume in cubic inches, then divide by 144 to get board feet.

Each piece's dimensions: 2" thick, 6" wide, 12 feet long. Wait, the length is 12 feet, which is 144 inches.

So volume is 2 *6 * 144 = let's compute that.

2*6 is 12, 12 *144 is 1728 cubic inches per piece.

Now, board feet is 144 cubic inches, so 1728 /144 = 12 board feet per piece.

Oh, so each piece is 12 board feet. Then 300 pieces would be 300 *12= 3600 board feet.

Wait, that's a lot. Now, the cost is $140 per 1000 board feet. So for 3600, how much would that be?

Total cost = (3600 / 1000) * 140 = 3.6 *140 = let's compute that.

3 *140 is 420, 0.6*140 is 84, so 420+84=504.

So the total cost is $504. Looking at the options, option C is $504. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but earlier I thought each piece was 1 board foot, but now I get 12 per piece. Where did I go wrong before?

Ah, I see. In the first approach, I converted all dimensions to feet. So thickness was 1/6 ft, width 1/2 ft, length 12 ft. So 1/6 *1/2 = 1/12, 1/12 *12 =1. So that gives 1 board foot per piece. But that must be wrong because when I use the cubic inches approach, it's 12 board feet.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the first method.

In the first approach, using feet:

Thickness: 2 inches = 2/12 = 1/6 ft.

Width: 6 inches = 6/12 = 1/2 ft.

Length: 12 ft.

Volume in cubic feet: (1/6) * (1/2) *12 = (1/12)*12 = 1 cubic foot.

But wait, 1 cubic foot is equal to 12 board feet because one board foot is 1 ft x1 ft x1 inch, which is 1/12 cubic foot. So 1 cubic foot equals 12 board feet.

Ah, that's the confusion. So 1 cubic foot is 12 board feet. So in the first approach, each piece is 1 cubic foot, which is 12 board feet. So both methods agree.

So each piece is 12 board feet. 300 pieces would be 300 *12=3600 board feet.

At $140 per 1000, that's 3600/1000 = 3.6 *140= $504. So the correct answer is option C: $504.

To calculate the cost of lumber, we start by determining the volume of one piece of lumber in board feet. The dimensions of each piece are:

- **Thickness**: 2 inches = \( \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \, \text{ft} \)
- **Width**: 6 inches = \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{ft} \)
- **Length**: 12 feet

The volume of one piece in cubic feet is:

\[
\text{Volume (cubic feet)} = \text{Thickness} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 1 \, \text{cubic foot}.
\]

Since 1 cubic foot is equivalent to 12 board feet, each piece of lumber is:

\[
1 \, \text{cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{board feet}.
\]

For 300 pieces of lumber, the total volume in board feet is:

\[
300 \times 12 = 3600 \, \text{board feet}.
\]

The cost of lumber is $140 per 1,000 board feet. Therefore, the cost for 3,600 board feet is:

\[
\text{Cost} = \frac{3600}{1000} \times 140 = 3.6 \times 140 = 504.
\]

Thus, the total cost for 300 pieces of lumber is **$504**. The correct answer is:

**C: $504**
