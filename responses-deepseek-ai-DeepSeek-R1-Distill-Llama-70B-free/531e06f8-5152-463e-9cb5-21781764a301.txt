Question:

A chemist wants to dilute 50 ml of 3.50 M H_2SO_4 to 2.00 M H_2SO_4. To what volume must it be diluted?

Options:

B: 50 ml
C: 150 ml
D: 175 ml
E: 100 ml
F: 110 ml
G: 75 ml
H: 62.5 ml
I: 200 ml
J: 87.5 ml

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about diluting sulfuric acid. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that dilution problems usually involve the concentration and volume before and after. Oh right, the formula is M1V1 = M2V2. Yeah, that's it.

So the problem says I have 50 ml of 3.50 M H2SO4, and I need to dilute it to 2.00 M. I need to find the final volume after dilution. Wait, waitâ€”wait, no. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, when you dilute a solution, you're adding more solvent, so the volume increases. So the initial volume is 50 ml, and the initial concentration is higher than the final. So the final volume must be larger than 50 ml.

Right, so using M1V1 = M2V2. Let me plug in the numbers. M1 is 3.50 M, V1 is 50 ml. M2 is 2.00 M, and V2 is what we're solving for.

So 3.50 * 50 = 2.00 * V2. Let me calculate the left side. 3.5 times 50 is 175. So 175 = 2 * V2. Then V2 is 175 / 2, which is 87.5 ml. Wait, but wait. Wait, wait a minute. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Because when you dilute, you're adding more volume, so the final volume should be larger than the initial. But 87.5 is larger than 50, right? Wait, no, 87.5 is larger than 50? Wait, 50 ml to 87.5 is an increase. Oh right, because 87.5 is 1.75 times 50. So that makes sense. So the diluted volume is 87.5 ml.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking back, the options are A to J. Let me see: option J is 87.5 ml. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about dilution, sometimes people get confused between whether they're adding water or something else. Wait, but in this case, the formula M1V1 = M2V2 should handle it correctly. Because M1 is the initial concentration, V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume after adding the solvent. So the calculation should be correct.

So the answer should be J, 87.5 ml.

To solve the problem, we use the dilution formula: 

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2
\]

Where:  
- \( M_1 = 3.50 \, \text{M} \) (initial concentration)  
- \( V_1 = 50 \, \text{ml} \) (initial volume)  
- \( M_2 = 2.00 \, \text{M} \) (final concentration)  
- \( V_2 \) is the final volume to be determined.  

Substituting the values:  

\[
3.50 \times 50 = 2.00 \times V_2
\]

\[
175 = 2.00 \times V_2
\]

\[
V_2 = \frac{175}{2.00} = 87.5 \, \text{ml}
\]

Thus, the final volume after dilution is **87.5 ml**, which corresponds to option **J**.
