Question:

Which of the following statements is false?

Options:

A: The t-distributions have more area under the tails than the normal distribution.
B: The t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, and so are more spread out than the normal distribution.
C: Like the normal distribution, the t-distributions are symmetric.
D: The t-distributions are the same as the normal distribution when the sample size is large.
E: The greater the df, the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution.
F: The 68-95-99.7 Rule does not apply to t-models.
G: The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models.
H: The t-distributions are only applicable when the data is normally distributed.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about t-distributions and the normal distribution. The question asks which statement is false. Let me go through each option one by one to figure it out. 

First, I'll try to remember what I know about t-distributions. I think t-distributions are used when the population standard deviation is unknown, and we're dealing with small sample sizes. They look similar to the normal distribution but have fatter tails, especially when the degrees of freedom (df) are small.

Option A says that t-distributions have more area under the tails than the normal distribution. Hmm, I remember that t-distributions have heavier tails, which means more area in the tails compared to a normal distribution. So A sounds true, not false. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B: t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, making them more spread out. Since they have heavier tails, yes, the peak at the mean is lower, and the tails are higher. This makes them more spread out than a normal distribution. So B is true. Not the false statement.

Option C: Like the normal distribution, t-distributions are symmetric. I think that's correct. Both are symmetric around the mean. So C is true, not the answer.

Option D: The t-distributions are the same as the normal distribution when the sample size is large. Oh right, as the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. So when df is large (which comes with large samples), they look the same. So D is true, not false.

Option E: The greater the df, the closer the t-distribution is to the normal. Yes, that's what I just thought. Higher df makes t-distribution approximate normal. So E is true. Not the answer.

Option F: The 68-95-99.7 Rule doesn't apply to t-models. Wait, the 68-95-99.7 rule is the empirical rule for normal distributions. Since t-distributions have fatter tails, the percentages wouldn't hold exactly. So for t-distributions, especially with low df, this rule doesn't apply as well. So F is true. Not the false statement.

Option G: The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models. Wait, no. Because smaller df means fatter tails, so the rule (which expects a certain percentage in each tail) wouldn't work as well. So the smaller the df, the worse the rule works. So G is false. Because if df is smaller, the rule is less applicable, not better. So G is the false statement.

Option H: The t-distributions are only applicable when the data is normally distributed. Hmm. I think t-distributions are used when the data is normally distributed, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, actually, the t-test assumes that the sample is from a normal distribution. So statement H says they're only applicable when data is normally distributed, which is correct. So H is true. So the false statement isn't H.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check option G. The 68-95-99.7 rule applies to the normal distribution, not the t. So for t-models, especially with small df, the percentages are different. So if someone uses this rule on t-models, it would be less accurate. So if the df is smaller, the rule works worse. So G says the smaller df makes the rule work better, which is false. So G is the false statement.

So the question asks which is false. So the false option is G. Therefore, the answer should be G.

The question asks which statement about t-distributions is false. To determine this, each option is analyzed:

- **A**: True. T-distributions have heavier tails than the normal distribution, meaning more area under the tails.
- **B**: True. T-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, making them more spread out.
- **C**: True. T-distributions, like the normal distribution, are symmetric.
- **D**: True. As sample size increases, t-distributions approach the normal distribution.
- **E**: True. Higher degrees of freedom (df) make t-distributions closer to the normal distribution.
- **F**: True. The 68-95-99.7 rule applies to normal distributions, not t-distributions, especially with small df.
- **G**: False. Smaller df means fatter tails, making the 68-95-99.7 rule less applicable, not better.
- **H**: True. T-distributions assume the data is normally distributed.

The false statement is **G**, as smaller df makes the 68-95-99.7 rule work worse, not better.
