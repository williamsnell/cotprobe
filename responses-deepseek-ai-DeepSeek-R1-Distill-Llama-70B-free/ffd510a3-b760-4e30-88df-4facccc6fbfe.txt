Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about selecting a manager. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking what selection procedures one would use to select a manager. The options are A through D, each listing different criteria.

First, I need to understand what makes a good manager. Managers need a variety of skills, right? They should be able to lead, communicate well, make decisions, and handle responsibilities. So the selection process should evaluate these qualities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Marital status, place of birth, favorite color. Hmm, these don't seem relevant. Marital status and place of birth are personal and not indicative of managerial skills. Favorite color is just irrelevant. So A is probably not the right choice.

Option B: Personality test results, social media presence, volunteer work history. Personality tests can be useful to assess traits like leadership and teamwork. Volunteer work might show initiative and community involvement, which could be positive. Social media presence is a bit tricky; while it might show how someone presents themselves publicly, it's not a direct measure of managerial ability. So B has some relevant points but maybe not the best fit overall.

Option C: Social maturity and breadth, intelligence, motivation and drive for achievement, human relations development, leadership style. This sounds comprehensive. Social maturity suggests emotional stability and interpersonal skills. Intelligence is crucial for problem-solving and strategy. Motivation and drive are essential for achieving goals. Human relations development implies good communication and teamwork abilities. Leadership style directly ties into how they'd manage others. This seems like a well-rounded approach.

Option D: Height, weight, zodiac sign, shoe size. These are all physical attributes or unrelated factors. None of these relate to managerial competencies, so D is definitely out.

So the best option is C because it covers key areas relevant to managerial effectiveness: social skills, intelligence, motivation, human relations, and leadership style. These factors are directly tied to what a manager needs to succeed.
