Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about how the presence of others affects an individual's performance. I remember learning a bit about this in my psychology class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question is asking about the effect of social presence on performance. I think this relates to something called social facilitation. From what I recall, social facilitation is when having others around either helps or hinders performance.

Wait, so I remember that for simple tasks, people tend to perform better when others are around. But for more complex or difficult tasks, the presence of others might actually make performance worse. So it's like, when the task is easy, being around others gives you a boost, but when it's hard, it might cause anxiety or something, making you do worse.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one that says that. Let's go through them.

Option A: No significant effect. I don't think that's right because studies do show an effect.

Option B: Facilitate both easy and difficult. Hmm, I thought difficult tasks are hindered, so B might not be correct.

Option C: Hinder all tasks. No, that's the opposite for easy tasks.

Option D: Hinder difficult tasks. That sounds right for the hard ones, but what about easy? So D alone doesn't cover the whole picture.

Option E: Hinder easy tasks. No, that's wrong because easy tasks are usually facilitated.

Option F: Increase difficult, decrease easy. Wait, no, I thought it's the other way around. So F says difficult tasks are increased, which I don't think is correct.

Option G: Increase novel (which I guess are new or unfamiliar) tasks but decrease difficult. Not sure about novel. I think the main distinction is between easy and difficult.

Option H: Facilitate easy tasks. That's partially correct, but what about difficult? Since the question is about the overall effect, maybe H is correct if the question is considering only the easy part. But the question is about the effect on tasks in general.

Wait, the question says, "the effect ... is to..." So it's looking for the general trend. So the correct answer should address both easy and difficult.

So the correct pattern is: easy tasks are facilitated (performance improves), difficult tasks are hindered (performance worsens). So the answer should reflect that, but looking at the options, I need to find which one matches.

Looking again:

Option D says hinder difficult, but doesn't mention easy. Option H says facilitate easy, but doesn't mention difficult. The question is about the overall effect on performance—so perhaps the correct answer combines both.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says both. Let me check again.

Wait, option B says facilitate both, which is incorrect because difficult are hindered. Option D only mentions difficult. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts. Let me think again. Social facilitation: presence of others increases performance on well-learned tasks but impairs performance on new or difficult ones.

So if the task is easy or well-learned, others help; if it's difficult or new, others hurt.

So the effect is: presence of others facilitates easy tasks and hinders difficult ones.

Looking at the options, the correct one should say that.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option that directly states this. Let me check each option again.

Option D: Hinder difficult. So this is correct for difficult tasks but doesn't say what happens with easy.

Option H: Facilitate easy. Correct for easy, but what about difficult?

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as the overall effect, but the options don't capture both. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H and D, but since the options are separate, maybe the question is focusing on the general effect.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the mere presence of others can either facilitate or hinder, depending on the task. So perhaps the correct answer is that others facilitate easy tasks but hinder difficult ones. But looking at the options, none of them directly state this combination.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Option D: Hinder the performance of difficult tasks.

Option H: Facilitate the performance of easy tasks.

But the question is phrased as, what is the effect? So perhaps the correct answer would be that the presence of others facilitates easy tasks and hinders difficult ones. But since the options don't have a choice that combines both, perhaps the answer is either H or D, but the question is about the overall effect.

Wait, the question says, "the effect of the presence of others on an individual's performance is to..." So it's a general statement. So the correct answer would be that it can either facilitate or hinder, depending on the task. But looking at the options, which one captures this?

Wait, let me read the options again carefully.

Option D: Hinder the performance of difficult tasks. So this is correct for difficult tasks.

Option H: Facilitate the performance of easy tasks. Correct for easy.

But the question is about the overall effect. Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is that it facilitates easy tasks and hinders difficult ones. But none of the options state both.

Wait, looking again, option G says "increase novel, decrease difficult". Novel might be similar to difficult, but I'm not sure. Or option F says increase difficult, decrease easy, which is the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The classic finding is that the presence of others (co-action or audience) improves performance on simple tasks but worsens it on complex tasks.

So, in the options, the correct answer should state that difficult tasks are hindered and easy facilitated. But since none of the options combine both, perhaps the intended answer is H and D. But the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the general idea that the presence of others can either help or hurt. But in the options, the closest is H and D. However, the options don't have a combined choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D and H, but since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is H. Or maybe the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the overall effect on all tasks, but the effect varies. Alternatively, I might have to pick the best fit.

Wait, perhaps looking for the answer that says that the presence of others facilitates easy tasks. So option H would be correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Wait, no—because the presence of others does have a positive effect on some tasks.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H and D, but since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the correct answer to this type of question is that the presence of others hinders difficult tasks and facilitates easy ones. But none of the options combine both. So perhaps the correct answer is either H or D, depending on the question's focus.

Wait, the question is phrased as: the effect is to... So perhaps the correct answer is that it facilitates easy tasks. So option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option D: Hinder the performance of difficult tasks.

Option H: Facilitate the performance of easy tasks.

So both D and H are correct aspects, but the question is asking for the effect in general. So perhaps the answer is both, but the options don't provide that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H because it's about facilitating, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the more accurate answer is that the presence of others can either facilitate or hinder, depending on task difficulty. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is H.

Wait, looking for the answer in my notes. Oh, right, the correct answer is that the presence of others facilitates performance on easy tasks and hinders on difficult ones. So the correct option would mention easy tasks being facilitated.

Looking at the options, option H says "facilitate the performance of easy tasks," which fits. Option D says "hinder difficult," which also fits.

But the question is about the overall effect. Hmm. Wait, the question is phrased as, "the effect... is to..." So perhaps the correct answer is that it can do both, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is either H or D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is referring to the overall effect, and the correct answer is that it hinders difficult tasks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm a bit conflicted.

Wait, I think I remember that the correct answer is H: facilitate the performance of easy tasks. Because the presence of others generally helps with tasks you're good at but makes difficult tasks harder.

So, I think the correct answer is H.

The question asks about the effect of the presence of others on an individual's performance. This relates to the concept of social facilitation, which suggests that the presence of others can either enhance or hinder performance depending on the task's difficulty. Specifically, for easy or well-learned tasks, the presence of others tends to improve performance, while for difficult or complex tasks, it often worsens performance.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as studies show the presence of others does have a significant effect.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the presence of others does not facilitate performance for both easy and difficult tasks; it hinders difficult tasks.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as the presence of others does not hinder all tasks.
- **Option D**: Partially correct, as it accurately states that the presence of others hinders the performance of difficult tasks, but it does not address easy tasks.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as the presence of others does not hinder the performance of easy tasks.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it reverses the effect: difficult tasks are hindered, not facilitated, and easy tasks are facilitated, not hindered.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it mentions "novel tasks," which is not the focus of the question.
- **Option H**: Partially correct, as it accurately states that the presence of others facilitates the performance of easy tasks, but it does not address difficult tasks.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as the presence of others does not increase performance for all tasks.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as it mentions "novel tasks," which is not the focus of the question.

The question asks for the overall effect of the presence of others on performance. Since the options do not combine both aspects (facilitating easy tasks and hindering difficult tasks), the best answer is **Option H**, as it correctly identifies the facilitation of easy tasks, which is a key part of the social facilitation phenomenon.

Answer: H
