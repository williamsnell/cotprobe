Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter for causing a vehicular homicide. A grand jury was convened, and various witnesses were subpoenaed. At the grand jury, a witness was asked the following question by the prosecuting attorney: "Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?" He answered, "Yes. "The defendant was also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. The defendant was represented by counsel at the grand jury hearing. During questioning he was shown the witness's statement from his testimony. No objection was made to the introduction of the witness's statement. At the defendant's trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce into evidence the witness's statement from the deposition taken at the grand jury hearing. The defendant's attorney objects to this proffer of evidence. The objection at trial will be

Options:

A: denied, because the statement was made during a formal legal proceeding and is therefore admissible.
B: granted, because the questioning of the witness was leading.
C: granted, because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: granted, because the witness's statement could prejudice the jury against the defendant.
E: granted, because the statement was not made under oath.
F: denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the questioning of the witness was leading.
G: denied, because the defendant's attorney did not properly cross-examine the witness at the grand jury hearing.
H: denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the witness's testimony was hearsay.
I: denied, because the defendant was given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the grand jury hearing.
J: granted, because the witness's statement is irrelevant to the case.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions and grand jury proceedings. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant charged with involuntary manslaughter due to a vehicular homicide. A grand jury was convened, and a witness was subpoenaed. During the grand jury hearing, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness a leading question: "Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?" The witness answered yes.

Then, the defendant was also subpoenaed and appeared before the grand jury with counsel. During his questioning, he was shown the witness's statement from the testimony, but no objection was made about introducing that statement. Now, at the defendant's trial, the prosecutor wants to introduce the witness's statement from the grand jury deposition, and the defense attorney objects. The question is about whether this objection will be granted or denied and why.

I need to figure out the correct answer from the options A to J.

First, I should recall the rules of evidence, particularly regarding hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

In this case, the witness's statement at the grand jury is being offered at trial. So, the statement was made during a prior proceeding (the grand jury hearing) and is now being used at trial. I remember that prior testimony can sometimes be admissible under certain conditions, like if it was given under oath and subject to cross-examination.

Wait, but the grand jury proceeding is a bit different. I think in some jurisdictions, grand jury testimony can be used at trial under specific circumstances, but there are limitations. For example, the defendant's right to confront witnesses comes into play.

Also, the defendant was present at the grand jury with counsel and had the opportunity to cross-examine. But I think there's a rule that prior testimony from a grand jury isn't automatically admissible at trial unless it meets certain exceptions.

Wait, but the witness's statement here was made during the grand jury. So when the prosecutor tries to introduce it at trial, it's hearsay unless an exception applies. Is there an exception for prior testimony?

I think the key here is whether the prior testimony was given in a proceeding where the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine. But wait, grand jury proceedings are not the same as a trial. At a grand jury, it's the prosecutor presenting evidence to the grand jury, and the defendant's attorney can ask questions, but the defendant isn't the same as the trier of fact (the grand jury decides indictment, not guilt). 

Wait, but if the defendant was present and had counsel, maybe that affects admissibility. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is hearsay and not covered by any exception.

Another angle: The witness's statement was given at the grand jury, which is a judicial proceeding. So, under the hearsay exception for prior sworn testimony (like FRE 804(b)(1) or similar), the statement could be admissible if the witness is unavailable, but in this case, there's no indication the witness is unavailable. So that exception wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible under the rule against hearsay because it's a prior inconsistent statement, but wait, in this scenario, the statement is consistent with the prior statement to the police. So that might not apply.

Wait, the question is about the admissibility of the grand jury testimony at trial. The defendant's attorney didn't object when the statement was introduced at the grand jury. But now, at trial, the attorney is objecting to its admission.

So, when the prosecutor seeks to introduce the witness's prior statement from the grand jury, the defense objects. The issue is whether this statement is hearsay and if any exception applies.

If the statement is hearsay, and no exception is available, then the objection should be granted. So looking at the options, option C says it's hearsay not within any exception. That could be the case.

But wait, another consideration: the defendant was present at the grand jury and had the opportunity to cross-examine. Does that make the statement admissible under the 'prior testimony' exception? Or is that only applicable when the testimony was at a trial or other proceeding where the opposing party had a chance to cross.

Wait, under FRE 804(b)(1), the prior testimony exception requires that the testimony was given under oath, and that the party against whom it is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to examine the witness. So if the defendant had the opportunity to cross at the grand jury, maybe that applies.

Wait, but does the grand jury count as a 'proceeding' for this purpose? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think that in some jurisdictions, grand jury testimony can be used at trial, but perhaps only under certain conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the defendant's presence and representation at the grand jury allows the testimony to be admissible as prior testimony. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: The grand jury is an investigatory body, not a trial. So the prior testimony there might not meet the standard for admissibility. Because in a trial, the prior testimony would have been in a similar adversarial setting, but the grand jury is more one-sided.

Wait, but the defendant was represented and could have cross-examined, so maybe that's enough. If the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine, then the prior testimony could be admissible under the exception.

But wait, in this scenario, when the prosecutor introduced the witness's statement during the grand jury, the defendant's attorney didn't object. Does that matter? Or is it about whether the statement is hearsay now at trial.

Hmm. Wait, the issue is not about whether the questioning was leading, but whether the statement is hearsay. So option B (questioning was leading) is probably not the reason the objection is granted.

Option E says the statement wasn't made under oath. But in the scenario, the grand jury testimony is presumably under oath, as that's standard.

Option C is about hearsay without an exception. If the prior testimony doesn't fall into an exception, then it's inadmissible.

Wait, but according to the Federal Rules, when a witness's prior statement is used, if it's from a deposition or other proceeding, and the party had a chance to cross, it can be admissible as non-hearsay, or under the exception for prior testimony.

Wait, no, wait: The prior statement in this case is being offered by the prosecution. The witness made a statement at the grand jury, then the same statement is being offered at trial. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

The prior testimony exception (FRE 804(b)(1)) says that if the witness is unavailable, then prior testimony under oath, with opportunity for cross, is admissible. But here, the witness is available (since he testified at the grand jury, presumably he can testify at trial). So the exception wouldn't apply because the witness isn't unavailable.

Alternatively, is there another exception? Like the statement against interest, or excited utterance? Probably not in this case.

So since the statement is hearsay and no exception applies, the objection would be granted. So the correct answer would be C: granted because it's hearsay with no exception.

Looking at the other options:

A: Denied because formal proceeding. But that doesn't automatically make it admissible; it's still hearsay.

B: Questioning was leading. The objection at trial is about hearsay, not about leading questions. So B isn't the reason.

D: Prejudice. That's more about relevance or whether the evidence is more prejudicial than probative, but the issue here is hearsay.

E: Not under oath. Unlikely, as grand jury testimony is under oath.

F: No objection at grand jury. But the objection at trial is about hearsay, so F is about leading questions, not hearsay.

G: Not cross-examining. Doesn't matter because the issue is hearsay.

H: No objection to hearsay at grand jury. But at trial, the defense can still object; the prior failure to object doesn't waive the hearsay objection.

I: Opportunity to cross. This might relate to the prior testimony exception, but as discussed, the witness is available, so the exception doesn't apply.

J: Irrelevant. The statement is about the defendant running a red light, which is relevant to the manslaughter charge.

So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's statement made during a grand jury hearing when it is later introduced at trial. The defendant's attorney objects to the statement being used as evidence, and the issue is whether this objection will be granted or denied.

The key legal issue is whether the witness's statement from the grand jury hearing qualifies as hearsay and whether any exceptions to the hearsay rule apply. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

In this case, the witness's statement was made during a grand jury proceeding, which is a formal legal proceeding. However, the admissibility of the statement at trial depends on whether it meets the criteria for an exception to the hearsay rule. One potential exception is for prior testimony, but this exception typically requires that the witness be unavailable at trial. Here, there is no indication that the witness is unavailable, so this exception does not apply.

Other potential exceptions, such as statements against interest or excited utterances, are not relevant to the facts of this case. The statement is therefore hearsay, and no recognized exception applies. Additionally, while the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the grand jury hearing, this does not automatically make the statement admissible at trial under the hearsay rule.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While the statement was made during a formal proceeding, this does not automatically make it admissible; it is still hearsay.
- **B**: Incorrect. The objection at trial is about hearsay, not about the questioning being leading.
- **C**: Correct. The statement is hearsay, and no recognized exception applies.
- **D**: Incorrect. The issue is hearsay, not prejudice.
- **E**: Incorrect. Grand jury testimony is typically under oath, so this is not a valid reason for exclusion.
- **F**: Incorrect. The objection at trial is about hearsay, not the failure to object to leading questions at the grand jury hearing.
- **G**: Incorrect. The failure to cross-examine at the grand jury hearing does not waive the hearsay objection at trial.
- **H**: Incorrect. The defense can still object to hearsay at trial, even if no objection was made at the grand jury hearing.
- **I**: Incorrect. While the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine, this does not make the statement admissible under the hearsay rule.
- **J**: Incorrect. The statement is relevant to the case, as it pertains to the defendant's alleged actions.

The correct answer is **C**: granted, because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception.

Answer: C
