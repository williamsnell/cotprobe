Question:

In Canada in 2014, the average wholesale price of soybeans was $0.24 per pound. In 2015, the average wholesale price of soybeans was $0.16 per pound. If a retailer purchased 20,000 pounds of soybeans in 2014 and in 2015, what was the percent change in the retailer’s expenses from 2014 to 2015?

C: –33%
D: –8%
E: 16%
F: 8%
G: –20%
H: –50%
I: 25%
J: 0%

Okay, so I have this problem about soybeans prices in Canada, and I need to figure out the percent change in a retailer's expenses from 2014 to 2015. Let's see. 

First, the question gives me the average wholesale prices for both years. In 2014, it was $0.24 per pound, and in 2015, it dropped to $0.16 per pound. The retailer bought 20,000 pounds each year. I need to calculate how the expenses changed in percentage.

Alright, step by step. Expenses would be price per pound multiplied by the number of pounds. So for 2014, the expense is 0.24 * 20,000. Let me calculate that. 0.24 times 20,000... 0.24 * 20k. Hmm, 0.24 * 20 is 4.8, so 4.8 * 1,000 is $4,800. So 2014 expense is $4,800.

Then 2015: 0.16 * 20,000. 0.16 * 20 is 3.2, so 3.2 * 1,000 is $3,200. So the expense in 2015 is $3,200.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.16 dollars per pound times 20,000 pounds. Let me compute that again. 20,000 * 0.16 = 3,200 dollars. Yes, that's right.

Now, to find the percent change. I remember the formula for percent change is [(New Value - Original Value)/Original Value] * 100. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? Because sometimes I get confused whether it's (Old - New) or (New - Old). 

Wait, the formula is (New - Original) / Original * 100. So in this case, the original is 2014's expense, which is 4,800, and the new is 3,200.

So plugging in the numbers: (3,200 - 4,800) / 4,800 *100. Let's compute the numerator first. 3,200 - 4,800 is -1,600. So that's -1,600 divided by 4,800. 

Wait, -1600/4800. Let me simplify this. Both numbers are divisible by 800. 1600 divided by 800 is 2, 4800 divided by 800 is 6. So -2/6, which reduces to -1/3. 

What's -1/3 as a percentage? Well, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333, so negative would be -0.3333, which is -33.33%. So the percent change is approximately -33.33%.

Looking at the options, option C is -33%, which should be the correct answer. Let me just double-check the calculations to be sure.

2014: 0.24 * 20,000 = 4,800. Correct.
2015: 0.16 * 20,000 = 3,200. Correct.
Change: 3,200 - 4,800 = -1,600. Divided by 4,800 is -0.3333. So that's a 33.33% decrease. So the percent change is -33.33%, which is approximately -33%. So option C is correct.

To determine the percent change in the retailer’s expenses from 2014 to 2015, we start by calculating the total expenses for each year. 

- In 2014, the price per pound was $0.24, and the retailer purchased 20,000 pounds. The total expense for 2014 is:
  \[
  0.24 \times 20,000 = \$4,800
  \]

- In 2015, the price per pound was $0.16, and the retailer purchased the same amount, 20,000 pounds. The total expense for 2015 is:
  \[
  0.16 \times 20,000 = \$3,200
  \]

The percent change in expenses is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Percent Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100
\]
Here, the "Original Value" is the 2014 expense (\$4,800), and the "New Value" is the 2015 expense (\$3,200). Substituting these values:
\[
\text{Percent Change} = \frac{3,200 - 4,800}{4,800} \times 100 = \frac{-1,600}{4,800} \times 100 = -33.33\%
\]

This represents a 33.33% decrease in expenses. Among the provided options, the closest match is **-33%**, which corresponds to option C.

**Answer: C**
