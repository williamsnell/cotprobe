Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the internal energy of a system of particles. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says we've got N particles, each can be in either of two energy levels: +ε or -ε. The probability of occupying an energy level at temperature T is given by P_E = e^(-E/(KT)), where E is the energy of the level, K is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Alright, so first, I need to find the internal energy of the system. Internal energy is the total energy of all the particles, right? So I guess each particle contributes either +ε or -ε, and I need to find the average energy per particle and then multiply by N.

Wait, but how do I find the average energy? I think I should calculate the expectation value of the energy. The expectation value would be the sum of each possible energy multiplied by its probability.

So let me list the energy levels and their probabilities.

The two energy levels are ε and -ε. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the problem says each particle can be in +ε or -ε. So the possible energies for a single particle are +ε and -ε.

Wait, but the probability equation given is P_E = e^(-E/(KT)). Hmm, but that seems a bit off because usually the Boltzmann distribution is P(E) proportional to e^{-E/(kT)}, but here it's given as P_E = e^{-E/(KT)}. So maybe it's correct as given, but I should just use it as is.

So for each particle, the probability of being in energy level +ε is P(ε) = e^{-ε/(KT)}, and the probability of being in -ε is P(-ε) = e^{ε/(KT)}? Wait, wait no, because E is the energy of the level. So for E = +ε, P = e^{- (+ε)/(KT)}. And for E = -ε, P = e^{- (-ε)/(KT)} which is e^{+ε/(KT)}.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean that the probabilities are e^{-ε/(KT)} for +ε and e^{ε/(KT)} for -ε. But that can't be right because probabilities must sum to 1. Let me check.

Wait, the sum of probabilities should be 1. So P(+ε) + P(-ε) = e^{-ε/(KT)} + e^{ε/(KT)} = 1. That can't be correct because e^{-x} + e^{x} is 2 cosh(x), which is greater than 1 for any x except x=0, where it's 2. So that would make the probabilities sum to more than 1, which isn't possible.

Ah, I see. I think I'm misunderstanding the formula. Oh wait, right! The correct formula should include normalization. The probabilities are proportional to e^{-E/(KT)}, so for two levels E1 and E2, their probabilities are P1 = [e^{-E1/(KT)}]/Z and P2 = [e^{-E2/(KT)}]/Z, where Z is the partition function, Z = e^{-E1/(KT)} + e^{-E2/(KT)}.

So in this case, E1 is +ε, E2 is -ε. So Z = e^{-ε/(KT)} + e^{ε/(KT)}. So the probabilities become:

P(+ε) = e^{-ε/(KT)} / Z

P(-ε) = e^{ε/(KT)} / Z

Wait, that makes more sense because now P(+ε) + P(-ε) = (e^{-x} + e^{x}) / Z, where x = ε/(KT). But since Z = e^{-x} + e^{x}, this sum is 1. So that's correct.

Now, the average energy per particle would be:

⟨E⟩ = (+ε) * P(+ε) + (-ε) * P(-ε)

Substituting the probabilities:

⟨E⟩ = ε * [e^{-x} / Z] + (-ε) * [e^{x} / Z]

Where x = ε/(KT). Let's factor out ε/Z:

⟨E⟩ = (ε/Z) [e^{-x} - e^{x}]

Hmm, e^{-x} - e^{x} is equal to -2 sinh(x), because sinh(x) is (e^x - e^{-x}) / 2. So:

⟨E⟩ = (ε / Z) * (-2 sinh(x)).

Now, let's compute Z, which is e^{-x} + e^{x} = 2 cosh(x). So substituting Z:

⟨E⟩ = (ε / (2 cosh(x))) ) * (-2 sinh(x)) )

Simplify:

The 2 in the denominator and the 2 factor in the numerator (-2) would cancel. So:

⟨E⟩ = ε * (- sinh(x)) / cosh(x) )

Because cosh(x) is the denominator and sinh(x) is in the numerator.

Wait, sinh(x)/cosh(x) is tanh(x). So:

⟨E⟩ = -ε * tanh(x)

And since x = ε/(KT), this becomes:

⟨E⟩ = -ε tanh( ε/(KT) )

So the average energy per particle is -ε tanh( ε/(KT) )

Therefore, the total internal energy U is N times this:

U = N * ⟨E⟩ = N * (-ε tanh( ε/(KT) )) = -N ε tanh( ε/(KT) )

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option C is -ε N tanh(ε/KT). Wait, but the way it's written is -epsilon N tanh(epsilon/(KT)), which is what I have. So that would correspond to option C.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the average energy per particle is:

⟨E⟩ = (ε e^{-x} - ε e^{x}) / (e^{-x} + e^{x}) )

Which is [ε (e^{-x} - e^{x}) ] / (e^{-x} + e^{x}) )

= ε [ (e^{-x} - e^{x}) / (e^{-x} + e^{x}) ) ]

Let me factor out e^{-x} in numerator and denominator:

Numerator: e^{-x} (1 - e^{2x} )

Denominator: e^{-x} (1 + e^{2x} )

So the e^{-x} cancels:

⟨E⟩ = ε (1 - e^{2x}) / (1 + e^{2x}) )

Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of hyperbolic functions.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute (e^{-x} - e^{x})/(e^{-x} + e^{x}) )

That's equal to - (e^{x} - e^{-x}) / (e^{x} + e^{-x}) )

Which is - ( (2 sinh x) ) / (2 cosh x) )

Which is - tanh x, same as before.

So yes, the average is -ε tanh x, where x = ε/(KT).

So U = N * (-ε tanh x) = -N ε tanh( ε/(KT) )

Looking back at the options:

Option C: -epsilon N tanh(epsilon / (KT) )

That's exactly what I have.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C says "-epsilon N tanh(epsilon/KT)", which is the same as -N ε tanh( ε/(KT) ), so yes, correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Checking the other options:

Option H is epsilon N tanh(...), which would be positive, but our calculation gives a negative internal energy.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the energy levels are +ε and -ε, so the average could be negative. Let me think again.

Because the particles can have lower energy (-ε) or higher (+ε). At higher temperatures, more particles would be in higher energy states. Wait, but when T approaches infinity, the probabilities become equal, so tanh(ε/(KT)) approaches zero, so U approaches zero.

Wait, but if T is very low, approaching zero, then ε/(KT) becomes very large, so tanh approaches 1, so U approaches -N ε. Which makes sense because at low temperatures, particles would prefer the lower energy state, which is -ε.

Wait, but let me think about the signs again. The energy levels are +ε and -ε. So the average energy is (sum E_i P_i ). So when T is zero, all particles are in the lower energy state (-ε), so average energy per particle is -ε. So our calculation gives U = -N ε tanh(...), which when T approaches 0, becomes -N epsilon * 1 = -N epsilon. That matches.

So the answer is option C.

To calculate the internal energy of a system of \( N \) particles, each of which can occupy one of two energy levels, \( +\epsilon \) and \( -\epsilon \), we use the given probability distribution \( P_E = e^{-E/KT} \). However, this probability must be normalized, so the probabilities for the two energy levels are:

\[
P(+\epsilon) = \frac{e^{-\epsilon/KT}}{Z}, \quad P(-\epsilon) = \frac{e^{\epsilon/KT}}{Z},
\]

where \( Z = e^{-\epsilon/KT} + e^{\epsilon/KT} \) is the partition function.

The average energy per particle is given by:

\[
\langle E \rangle = (+\epsilon)P(+\epsilon) + (-\epsilon)P(-\epsilon).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle E \rangle = \epsilon \frac{e^{-\epsilon/KT}}{Z} - \epsilon \frac{e^{\epsilon/KT}}{Z}.
\]

Factoring out \( \epsilon/Z \):

\[
\langle E \rangle = \frac{\epsilon}{Z} \left(e^{-\epsilon/KT} - e^{\epsilon/KT}\right).
\]

Using \( Z = e^{-\epsilon/KT} + e^{\epsilon/KT} = 2\cosh(\epsilon/KT) \), we simplify:

\[
\langle E \rangle = \frac{\epsilon}{2\cosh(\epsilon/KT)} \left(-2\sinh(\epsilon/KT)\right),
\]

where \( \sinh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2 \). This simplifies further to:

\[
\langle E \rangle = -\epsilon \tanh(\epsilon/KT),
\]

since \( \tanh(x) = \sinh(x)/\cosh(x) \).

The total internal energy of the system is then:

\[
U = N \langle E \rangle = -N\epsilon \tanh(\epsilon/KT).
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: \(-\epsilon N \tanh(\epsilon/KT)\)**.

This matches the derived expression for the internal energy.
