Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about the decomposition of KCLO3 when heat is added. I remember that when KCLO3 is heated, it breaks down into KCl and oxygen gas. The reaction is something like 2 KCLO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. Yeah, I think that's right because potassium is +1, chlorine in KCLO3 is +5, and oxygen is -2. So the products would be KCl where Cl is -1, and O2 as oxygen gas.

So the question states that upon adding heat to an unknown amount of KCLO3, 0.96 grams of oxygen were liberated. We need to find out how much KCLO3 was present initially. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay, so I think stoichiometry is involved here. I'll need to find the moles of O2 produced and then relate that to the moles of KCLO3 that decomposed.

First, let's note down the molar masses. I'll need the molar mass of O2 and KCLO3.

Molar mass of O2 is 2 * 16 g/mol = 32 g/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Oxygen is O2, so each molecule has 2 oxygen atoms. Each O is 16 g/mol, so O2 is 32 g/mol. Right.

For KCLO3, let's calculate its molar mass:

K is about 39.1 g/mol,
Cl is about 35.5 g/mol,
O is 16 g/mol each. There are 3 O's, so 3*16 =48.

So 39.1 + 35.5 + 48 = let's add them up. 39.1 +35.5 is 74.6, plus 48 gives 122.6 g/mol. Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that because sometimes I make mistakes in quick calculations.

39.1 (K) + 35.45 (Cl) is approximately 74.55. Then 3*16 is 48, so 74.55 +48 = 122.55 g/mol. Let's say 122.55 g/mol for KCLO3.

Now, the reaction is 2 KCLO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2.

So from the balanced equation, 2 moles of KCLO3 produce 3 moles of O2. That means the mole ratio of KCLO3 to O2 is 2:3 or (2/3) KCLO3 per mole of O2.

Wait, no, wait. The ratio is 2 moles KCLO3 gives 3 moles O2. So for each mole of O2, there are 2/3 moles of KCLO3. Or, per mole of KCLO3, how much O2 is produced? Let me think.

Alternatively, for every 2 moles of KCLO3 that decompose, 3 moles of O2 are produced. So the moles of KCLO3 would be (2/3) times the moles of O2 produced.

Wait, no, wait. If 2 moles of KCLO3 produce 3 moles O2, then 1 mole of KCLO3 would produce 3/2 moles O2. So moles of KCLO3 = (moles of O2 produced) * (2/3).

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as:

moles KCLO3 = (moles O2) * (2/3). Because 2 KCLO3 gives 3 O2. So for each mole of O2, you have (2/3) moles of KCLO3.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's say you have x moles of KCLO3 decomposing. According to the reaction, 2 moles KCLO3 → 3 moles O2. So moles of O2 = (3/2) x. Or, solving for x, x = (2/3) * moles O2.

Yes, that makes sense. So if I have y moles of O2, then moles of KCLO3 decomposed is (2/3) y.

So first, I need to find the moles of O2 produced. The mass of O2 is 0.96 grams. Moles of O2 = mass / molar mass = 0.96 g / 32 g/mol.

Let me calculate that. 0.96 /32 = 0.03 moles of O2.

Wait, 32 goes into 0.96 how many times? 32 * 0.03 is 0.96, yes. So moles O2 = 0.03 mol.

Then, moles of KCLO3 is (2/3) * 0.03 = 0.02 moles.

Wait, no, wait: 2/3 of 0.03 is 0.02? Let me calculate that.

0.03 * 2 = 0.06, then 0.06 /3 = 0.02. Yes, correct.

So moles of KCLO3 is 0.02 moles.

Now, the mass of KCLO3 is moles * molar mass.

Molar mass of KCLO3 is 122.55 g/mol, as calculated earlier.

So mass = 0.02 mol * 122.55 g/mol = ?

Let me calculate that. 0.02 * 122.55.

0.02 is 2 cents, so 122.55 * 0.02 is 2.451 grams.

Wait, 122.55 *0.02: 122.55 * 2 is 245.1, so 0.02 is 2.451 grams.

Wait, but none of the options seem to match 2.451 grams. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:4.5, B:2.2, C:4.0, D:2.0, E:2.5, F:1.0, G:1.8, H:1.5, I:3.0, J:3.5.

Hmm, 2.45 is closest to option E:2.5 g or option B:2.2 g.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.

First, calculate moles of O2: 0.96 g /32 g/mol = 0.03 mol. That's correct.

Then, the reaction ratio: 2 KCLO3 → 3 O2. So moles KCLO3 = (2/3)* moles O2.

So 0.03 moles O2 * (2/3) = 0.02 moles KCLO3. That seems right.

Molar mass of KCLO3: K is 39.1, Cl is 35.45, O3 is 16*3=48. So 39.1 +35.45 =74.55 +48=122.55 g/mol. Correct.

Mass = 0.02 *122.55 = 2.451 grams, which is approximately 2.45 g.

Looking at the options, E is 2.5 g, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass.

Wait, perhaps the molar mass calculation is wrong. Let me double-check:

K: atomic weight is about 39.10 g/mol.

Cl: about 35.45 g/mol.

O: 16.00 g/mol each, three of them, so 48.00 g/mol.

So adding: 39.10 +35.45 =74.55, plus 48 gives 122.55 g/mol. That's correct.

Hmm, so 2.451 grams isn't exactly an option, but E is 2.5 and B is 2.2. Wait, maybe I did a miscalculation in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should check if I inverted the ratio. Let's see.

The balanced equation is 2 KCLO3 → 3 O2.

So 2 moles KCLO3 produce 3 moles O2.

So moles of KCLO3 = (2/3) * moles O2.

Moles O2 is 0.03, so 2/3 *0.03 = 0.02 moles KCLO3. That's correct.

So 0.02 moles *122.55 g/mol = 2.451 grams.

Looking at the options, E is 2.5 g. So perhaps the answer is E.

But wait, why isn't it exact? Maybe because I rounded the molar masses. Let me check with more precise numbers.

Wait, K is 39.10, Cl is 35.45, O is 16.00.

So 39.10 +35.45 = 74.55, plus 3*(16.00)=48. So total is 122.55 g/mol.

Hmm, perhaps it's precise. So 0.02 *122.55 is 2.451.

Wait, the options don't have 2.45. The closest is E:2.5 and B:2.2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometric ratio. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction is 2 KCLO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2.

So 2 moles KCLO3 → 3 moles O2.

So per mole of KCLO3, it produces 3/2 moles O2.

Wait, so moles of O2 = (3/2) * moles KCLO3.

So if I have moles of O2 = 0.03, then:

0.03 = (3/2) * moles KCLO3 → moles KCLO3 = (0.03 *2)/3 = 0.02.

That's correct. So that's right.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the mass of KCLO3 that was present before heating, which is the same as the mass that decomposed because all of it is decomposing? Or is it possible that not all KCLO3 decomposed?

Wait, the question says "upon the addition of heat to an unknown amount of KCLO3, 0.96g of oxygen was liberated." So I think it's assuming that the KCLO3 decomposed completely, but perhaps not all of it. Wait, no, no, the amount of O2 released is based on the amount of KCLO3 that decomposed. So the moles of KCLO3 that reacted is what we calculated, which is 0.02 moles.

So the mass is 0.02 *122.55 = 2.451g.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly 2.45. So perhaps the answer is supposed to be E:2.5g.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me recalculate.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use exact molar masses.

K: 39.10 g/mol

Cl: 35.45 g/mol

O: 16.00 g/mol ×3 =48.00 g/mol

So molar mass of KCLO3 is 39.10 +35.45 +48.00 =122.55 g/mol.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use approximate molar masses, like O as 16, K as 39, Cl as 35.5. So 39 +35.5 is 74.5 +48=122.5.

Same result.

So 0.02 mol ×122.5 g/mol =2.45g.

So the closest option is E:2.5g.

Wait, but wait, let me check if I did the stoichiometry correctly.

Another way: moles O2 = 0.96 /32 =0.03.

The balanced equation is 2 KCLO3 → 3 O2.

So moles KCLO3 = moles O2 × (2/3) =0.03 ×2/3=0.02.

Mass KCLO3= 0.02 ×122.55=2.451g.

So the answer should be 2.45g, which isn't one of the options, but option E is 2.5g, which is the closest.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I have the balanced equation right. Let me write it again.

The decomposition of KCLO3 when heated produces KCl and O2.

The correct balanced equation is 2 KCLO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2.

Yes, because on the left, 2 K, 2 Cl, 6 O.

On the right, 2 KCl gives 2 K and 2 Cl. O2 is 3×2=6 O. So it's balanced.

Thus, I think the answer is 2.45g, which is closest to E:2.5g.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have miscalculated.

Wait, 0.02 ×122.55 = ?

Let me compute 0.02 ×122.55.

0.02 ×122 is 2.44, and 0.02 ×0.55 is 0.011, so total is 2.44 +0.011=2.451g.

Yes, correct.

So the answer should be 2.45g, but the options don't have that exact value. So perhaps the intended answer is E:2.5g, or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used more precise molar masses.

Wait, maybe the molar mass of KCLO3 is 122.5 g/mol, so 0.02 ×122.5 is 2.45g. So perhaps the correct answer is 2.45g, but since it's not an option, the closest is E:2.5g.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I inverted the ratio of KCLO3 to O2.

Wait, another approach: let's think in terms of mass.

The reaction is 2 moles KCLO3 →3 moles O2.

The molar masses are:

KCLO3:122.55 g/mol

O2:32 g/mol

So the mass ratio is:

(2×122.55) / (3×32) = (245.1) /96 = approximately 2.551 moles of KCLO3 per mole of O2.

Wait, no, that's the mass ratio. Wait, maybe I can think in terms of grams.

For every 3 moles of O2 (which is 96 g), 2 moles of KCLO3 (245.1g) are needed.

So the mass of KCLO3 required is (2/3) × (mass of O2) × (122.55/32).

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should set it up as a proportion.

Let me try to compute it as (mass of KCLO3) / (mass of O2) = (2×122.55) / (3×32).

So, mass of KCLO3 = (2×122.55)/(3×32) × mass of O2.

So, (245.1)/(96) ×0.96 g.

Compute 245.1/96 = approximately 2.551.

Then, 2.551 ×0.96 = ?

Let me calculate that.

2 ×0.96=1.92; 0.551×0.96= approx 0.52896.

So total is 1.92 +0.52896 ≈2.44896g, which is approximately 2.45g.

Again, same result. So the answer is 2.45g, which isn't an exact option, but the closest is E:2.5g.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check once more.

Wait, maybe the balanced equation is different. Let me see.

Wait, another way to write the decomposition is:

2 KCLO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2.

Yes, that's correct.

So moles of KCLO3 = (2/3) × moles of O2.

So 0.03 ×2/3=0.02 moles.

Mass KCLO3=0.02 ×122.55=2.451g.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 2.45g, which is closest to option E:2.5g. But let me check the options again.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see:

Wait, another possibility is that the problem uses different molar masses, perhaps rounded values. For example, maybe K is 39, Cl is 35.5, O is 16.

So 39 +35.5 =74.5 + 48=122.5 g/mol.

So same result.

Hmm. So I'm confident my calculation leads to 2.45g, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is E:2.5g.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the theoretical yield based on complete decomposition, but that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of O2.

Wait, 0.96g O2 has a molar mass of 32 g/mol.

So 0.96 /32=0.03 mol. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate again using exact numbers.

0.96 /32 = 0.03 exactly.

Then, moles of KCLO3 = (2/3)*0.03=0.02.

Mass =0.02 ×122.55=2.451g.

So I'm stuck with 2.45g, which is closest to option E:2.5g.

Wait, but perhaps I should look at the options again to see if I missed one.

Wait, looking at the options:

A:4.5

B:2.2

C:4.0

D:2.0

E:2.5

F:1.0

G:1.8

H:1.5

I:3.0

J:3.5

So E is 2.5, which is the closest to 2.45.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the molar masses. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the molar mass of KCLO3 is 122.5 g/mol, so 0.02 ×122.5=2.45g.

So the answer is 2.45g, which is not listed, but the closest is E:2.5g.

Alternatively, perhaps I
