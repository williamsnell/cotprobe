Okay, so I have this biology question here about giraffes and natural selection. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question says that in a population of giraffes, an environmental change happens that favors the tallest individuals. Because of this, more of the tall giraffes survive and pass on their genes. I need to figure out which type of selection this is.

Wait, I remember that natural selection can take different forms. There's stabilizing, directional, and disruptive selection. Let me recall what each of these means. 

Stabilizing selection is when the environment favors individuals with average or middle-range traits. So like, if being too big or too small is bad, and being average is best. That doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about tall giraffes being favored, not the average.

Disruptive selection is the opposite, I think. It's when extreme traits are favored over the average. So if both very tall and very short giraffes have an advantage, that would be disruptive. But in the question, it's only the tallest that are favored, not both extremes.

Then there's directional selection. That's when one extreme of a trait is favored, leading the population to shift in that direction over time. Like, if being taller becomes better, the average height increases. Yeah, that sounds exactly like what's happening here. The environmental change makes tall giraffes have a survival advantage, so they pass on their genes, making the population taller on average.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing this with sexual selection. Sexual selection is when traits are favored because they help in attracting mates, like peacocks' tails. But this question is about environmental factors affecting survival, not mating success. So it's not sexual selection.

Another option is intrasexual selection, which is a type of sexual selection where competition among the same sex for mates drives trait development. But again, the scenario here is about survival based on height, not competition for mates. So that's probably not it either.

Artificial selection is when humans intentionally breed for certain traits, like in agriculture. But this is a natural environmental change, so it's not artificial. Founder effect and bottleneck effect are about population dynamics and genetic drift, which don't directly apply here. Those have to do with random changes in allele frequencies due to small population sizes, not selection pressures.

Kin selection is about helping relatives, which isn't relevant here. Genetic drift is random changes, not selection. So the options narrow down to J: directional selection. Yeah, I think that's the correct answer. The environment is selecting for a trait (tallness) in a way that shifts the population's average in one direction.

The question describes a scenario where an environmental change favors taller giraffes, leading to their increased survival and ability to pass on their genetic information. This is a clear example of **directional selection**, where one extreme of a trait (in this case, tallness) is favored, causing the population's average trait to shift in that direction over time.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Artificial selection** involves human intervention, which is not the case here.  
- **B: Founder effect** and **H: Bottleneck effect** pertain to genetic drift due to population size changes, not selection.  
- **C: Stabilizing selection** favors average traits, which does not apply since tallness is the favored extreme.  
- **D: Intrasexual selection** and **E: Sexual selection** involve mate choice, not survival based on environmental factors.  
- **F: Kin selection** refers to helping relatives, which is irrelevant here.  
- **G: Genetic drift** involves random changes in allele frequencies, not selection.  
- **I: Disruptive selection** favors both extremes of a trait, but only tallness is favored in this scenario.  

Thus, the correct answer is **J: Directional selection**, as the environment selects for taller giraffes, driving the population's shift toward this trait.

Answer: J
