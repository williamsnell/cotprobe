Okay, so I have this problem about a modulated carrier signal and I need to find the power dissipated by m(t). Hmm, let's break it down.

The carrier is given by m(t) = n(t) * cos(ω₀t + θ). I remember that amplitude modulation involves multiplying the carrier by some varying signal, which in this case is n(t). Oh wait, no, wait! Wait, I think I might have that mixed up. Oh right, usually the carrier is a high-frequency sinusoid, and the modulating signal is n(t). So here, n(t) is the modulating signal, and the carrier is cos(ω₀t + θ). But wait, no, wait—the problem says it's amplitude modulated by the noise n(t), so m(t) is the modulated signal.

So m(t) is the product of n(t) and a cosine function. The cosine has a random phase θ, which is a random variable. The probability density function of θ is uniform between -π and π because f(θ) is 1/(2π) in that interval and zero elsewhere.

Wait, I also see that E[n²(t)] is given as σ². And θ and n(t) are independent. So I think I need to find the expected value of m(t) squared, because power is the expectation of the square of the signal, assuming it's a mean-square sense.

So the power dissipated by m(t) would be E[m(t)²]. Let's compute that.

m(t) = n(t) * cos(ω₀t + θ)

So m(t) squared is n(t)^2 * cos²(ω₀t + θ).

Taking expectation of m(t)^2:

E[m(t)²] = E[ n(t)^2 * cos²(ω₀t + θ) ]

Since θ and n(t) are independent, the expectation can be factored into the product of expectations.

So that's E[n(t)^2] * E[ cos²(ω₀t + θ) ]

Wait, but wait: wait, E[AB] when A and B are independent is E[A]E[B]. So yes, that holds.

Now, E[n(t)^2] is given as σ².

So I need to compute E[ cos²(ω₀t + θ) ].

Let me make that substitution. Let me let φ = ω₀t + θ. So the expectation becomes E[ cos²φ ].

But since θ is a random variable uniformly distributed over [-π, π], and t is time, but since θ is random, the expectation over θ would average over all possible phases.

Wait, but wait, t is a variable here. Hmm, but wait, when computing the expectation, are we considering the statistical expectation over θ and n(t)? Since θ is a random phase, and we're taking expectation over θ, the dependence on t might vanish because of the uniform distribution.

Let me think: cos²(φ) can be written using the double-angle identity. So cos²φ = (1 + cos(2φ))/2. So E[cos²φ] = E[ (1 + cos(2φ))/2 ] = 1/2 + (1/2) E[cos(2φ)].

Now, φ is ω₀t + θ, so 2φ is 2ω₀t + 2θ.

So E[cos(2φ)] = E[ cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ].

But θ is a uniform random variable over [-π, π], so 2θ is over [-2π, 2π]. But wait, the expectation of cos(2θ) when θ is uniform over [-π, π]—what's that?

Wait, the expectation of cos(kθ) when θ is uniform over [-π, π] is zero if k is any non-zero integer. Because over a full period, the average of cos is zero. Wait, but wait—it's not for any integer k, it's for any non-zero integer. Because for k=0, cos(0)=1, so the average is 1.

Wait, wait: in this case, the term is cos(2ω₀t + 2θ). Let me write this as cos(2θ + 2ω₀t) = cos(2θ)cos(2ω₀t) - sin(2θ)sin(2ω₀t). But when taking the expectation, because θ is uniform, E[cos(2θ)] is zero, and E[sin(2θ)] is zero as well. Because over a full period, the average of sine and cosine functions is zero. So E[cos(2φ)] = E[cos(2ω₀t + 2θ)] = cos(2ω₀t) E[cos(2θ)] - sin(2ω₀t) E[sin(2θ)].

But both E[cos(2θ)] and E[sin(2θ)] are zero because θ is uniformly distributed.

Wait, let me check that. Let me compute E[cos(2θ)] where θ is uniform between -π and π. The expectation is (1/(2π)) ∫_{-π}^{π} cos(2θ) dθ.

The integral of cos(2θ) over a full period: ∫ cos(2θ) dθ from -π to π is [ (sin(2θ))/2 ] from -π to π. sin(2π) is 0, sin(-2π) is 0. So the integral is 0. So E[cos(2θ)] = 0.

Similarly, E[sin(2θ)] is zero, because the integral of sin over a full period is zero. So cos(2φ) has expectation zero.

So E[cos²φ] = 1/2 + (1/2)*0 = 1/2.

Wait, that's for any value of t, because the expectation over θ makes the cosine terms go away.

So putting it all together: E[m(t)^2] = E[n(t)^2] * E[cos²(ω₀t + θ)] = σ² * (1/2) = σ²/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is (1/2)σ². Option J is σ². Hmm, but wait, is there any mistake here?

Wait, let me recheck my steps.

1. m(t) = n(t) cos(ω₀t + θ). So m(t)^2 = n(t)^2 cos²(ω₀t + θ).

2. E[m(t)^2] = E[n(t)^2 cos²(...)].

3. Since n(t) and θ are independent, this becomes E[n(t)^2] * E[cos²(...)].

4. E[n(t)^2] is σ².

5. E[cos²(ω₀t + θ)] over θ's distribution. As computed, this is 1/2.

So E[m(t)^2] = σ² * 1/2 = (1/2)σ², which is option I.

But wait, let me think again. Is the formula for power correct? Because sometimes, for random signals, the average power is the expectation of the square, yes. So yes.

Wait another thing: sometimes, when dealing with modulated signals, if the modulating signal has a certain power, the total power includes the unmodulated carrier and the sidebands. But wait, in this case, the carrier is being modulated by a noise, so the power would depend on the expectation.

Wait, but in this case, m(t) is the modulated signal, so its power is just the expectation of m(t) squared. We did that correctly.

Alternatively, could it be that the power is E[m(t)] squared plus the variance? No, because for power, it's E[m(t)^2], not (E[m(t)])^2. Because m(t) is a random process, its average power is the expectation of the square. So that would be correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the expectation of cos squared. Let me recompute E[cos²(φ)].

Wait, φ is ω₀t + θ. The expectation is over θ, which is uniform. So E[cos²(φ)] = average of cos²(θ + ω₀t) over θ from -π to π.

Because θ is uniform, the average over θ would be the same regardless of the value of ω₀t, as adding a constant (ω₀t) just shifts θ, but since θ is over a full period, the average remains the same. So E[cos²(φ)] is the same as E[cos²(θ + anything)] which would still be 1/2.

So yes, that part is correct.

Thus, the power is (1/2) σ², which is option I.

To determine the power dissipated by the modulated signal \( m(t) = n(t) \cdot \cos(\omega_0 t + \theta) \), we need to compute the expected value of \( m(t)^2 \), as power is defined as \( E[m(t)^2] \).

### Step 1: Express \( m(t)^2 \)
The modulated signal is given by:
\[
m(t) = n(t) \cdot \cos(\omega_0 t + \theta),
\]
so:
\[
m(t)^2 = n(t)^2 \cdot \cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta).
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( E[m(t)^2] \)
The expectation of \( m(t)^2 \) is:
\[
E[m(t)^2] = E\big[n(t)^2 \cdot \cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)\big].
\]
Since \( n(t) \) and \( \theta \) are independent, the expectation can be factored:
\[
E[m(t)^2] = E[n(t)^2] \cdot E\big[\cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)\big].
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate \( E[n(t)^2] \)
The problem states that \( E[n(t)^2] = \sigma^2 \).

### Step 4: Evaluate \( E\big[\cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)\big] \)
Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(x) = \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2} \), we can write:
\[
E\big[\cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)\big] = E\big[\frac{1 + \cos(2(\omega_0 t + \theta))}{2}\big].
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
E\big[\cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)\big] = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}E\big[\cos(2(\omega_0 t + \theta))\big].
\]

The term \( \cos(2(\omega_0 t + \theta)) \) can be expanded as:
\[
\cos(2(\omega_0 t + \theta)) = \cos(2\omega_0 t + 2\theta).
\]
Taking the expectation over \( \theta \), which is uniformly distributed between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\), we note that:
\[
E\big[\cos(2\theta)\big] = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad E\big[\sin(2\theta)\big] = 0,
\]
because the sine and cosine functions average to zero over a full period. Thus:
\[
E\big[\cos(2(\omega_0 t + \theta))\big] = 0.
\]

Therefore:
\[
E\big[\cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)\big] = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combine results
Substituting back, we find:
\[
E[m(t)^2] = E[n(t)^2] \cdot E\big[\cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)\big] = \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{2}.
\]

### Final Answer
The power dissipated by \( m(t) \) is \( \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \), which corresponds to **option I**.
