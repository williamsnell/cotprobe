Question:

In the design of a modern steel bridge, provisions must obviously be made for expansion. How much does this amount to in the case of a bridge two miles long which is subjected to temperatures ranging from - 40°F to + 110°F, assuming an average expansion coefficient of .000012/°C?

Options:

A: .003 miles
B: .001 miles
C: .008 miles
D: .0005 miles
E: .005 miles
F: .009 miles
G: .006 miles
H: .002 miles
I: .004 miles
J: .007 miles

Okay, so I have this problem about a steel bridge and thermal expansion. Hmm, I remember that when materials are heated, they expand, and when they cool, they contract. The problem is asking how much the bridge will expand over two miles when the temperature changes from -40°F to 110°F. The coefficient given is 0.000012 per degree Celsius. Wait, but the temperatures here are in Fahrenheit, so I think I need to convert that temperature range to Celsius first.

Wait, how do I convert Fahrenheit to Celsius? Oh right, the formula is (F - 32) * 5/9 = C. So let me calculate the temperature change in Celsius. The temperature goes from -40°F to 110°F. Let me find out what those are in Celsius.

First, for -40°F: (-40 -32) is -72. Multiply by 5/9, which is (-72 *5)= -360, divided by 9 is -40°C. Oh, interesting, -40°F is the same as -40°C. So that makes it easier.

Now for 110°F. Subtract 32 gives 78. Multiply by 5/9: 78 *5 is 390, divided by 9 is about 43.333°C. So the temperature change is from -40°C to 43.333°C. The total change in temperature is the difference between these two. So 43.333 - (-40) = 83.333°C. So a change of 83.333 degrees Celsius.

Wait, but wait: the coefficient is given per degree Celsius, so that's fine. Now, the formula for linear expansion is delta L = alpha * L0 * delta T. Where alpha is the coefficient, L0 is original length, delta T is the change in temperature.

So plugging in the numbers: alpha is 0.000012 per °C, L0 is two miles. Wait, two miles is the original length. So delta L = 0.000012 * 2 * 83.333.

Let me calculate that. First, 0.000012 times 2 is 0.000024. Then multiplied by 83.333. Hmm, 83.333 is approximately 250/3, wait 83.333 is 250/3? Wait, 250 divided by 3 is approximately 83.333. Let me check: 3 times 83 is 249, plus 1 is 250, so yes, 83.333 is 250/3. So 0.000024 * (250/3).

0.000024 is 24e-6. So 24e-6 * (250/3) = (24 * 250) / (3 * 1e6) ) = (6000) / (3e6) ) = 2000 / 1e6 = 2e-3, which is 0.002 miles.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure. Let me compute 0.000012 * 2 = 0.000024. Then 0.000024 * 83.333. Let's compute 0.000024 * 80 = 0.00192, and 0.000024 * 3.333 is approximately 0.00008. So total is 0.00192 + 0.00008 = 0.002. So yes, 0.002 miles.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.002 miles. So the answer should be H.

To determine the thermal expansion of a two-mile-long steel bridge subjected to a temperature range of -40°F to 110°F, we first convert the temperature range to Celsius. Using the formula \( T_C = (T_F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \), we find:

- \( -40^\circ \text{F} = -40^\circ \text{C} \),
- \( 110^\circ \text{F} \approx 43.333^\circ \text{C} \).

The total temperature change is \( \Delta T = 43.333 - (-40) = 83.333^\circ \text{C} \).

The formula for linear expansion is:

\[
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L_0 \cdot \Delta T
\]

where:
- \( \alpha = 0.000012 \, ^\circ \text{C}^{-1} \),
- \( L_0 = 2 \, \text{miles} \),
- \( \Delta T = 83.333^\circ \text{C} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta L = 0.000012 \cdot 2 \cdot 83.333
\]

First, calculate \( 0.000012 \cdot 2 = 0.000024 \). Then, \( 0.000024 \cdot 83.333 \approx 0.002 \, \text{miles} \).

Thus, the expansion of the bridge is approximately \( 0.002 \, \text{miles} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
