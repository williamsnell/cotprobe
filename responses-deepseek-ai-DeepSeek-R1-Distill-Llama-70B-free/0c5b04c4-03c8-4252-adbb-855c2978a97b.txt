Okay, so I have this physics problem here about X-ray absorption, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the mass absorption coefficients for the K_alpha and K_beta radiations of silver are given as 13.6 cm²/g and 58.0 cm²/g respectively when palladium is used as the absorber. The question is in two parts: first, to find the thickness of palladium foil needed to reduce the intensity of the K_alpha radiation to one-tenth of its incident value. Second, to find the percentage reduction in the intensity of the K_beta radiation with that same thickness.

Hmm. I remember that X-ray absorption follows the Beer-Lambert law, which is I = I₀ * exp(-μ * ρ * x), where μ is the mass absorption coefficient, ρ is the density, and x is the thickness. Wait, wait, no, I think it's written as I = I₀ * e^(-μρx), sometimes the mass absorption coefficient is μ/ρ, so maybe it's μ (the linear absorption coefficient) equals μ_mass * density. Let me make sure.

Wait, the mass absorption coefficient is μ_m = μ / ρ, where μ is the linear absorption coefficient. So the formula is I = I₀ exp(-μ_m * ρ * x). Because μ = μ_m * ρ, so when you multiply μ_m by density, you get μ, the linear coefficient.

So, for the first part, we have I = I₀ / 10, because we want the intensity to reduce to one-tenth. So I/I₀ is 0.1. We'll set up the equation:

0.1 = e^(-μ_m1 * ρ * x)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.1) = -μ_m1 * ρ * x

So, x = -ln(0.1) / (μ_m1 * ρ)

Given μ_m1 for K_alpha is 13.6 cm²/g. The density ρ is 11.4 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, μ_m is in cm²/g, so when multiplied by ρ (g/cm³), the units become cm²/g * g/cm³ = 1/cm. So x will be in cm, which is correct.

So let's compute this. ln(0.1) is approximately -2.302585. So:

x = (2.302585) / (13.6 * 11.4)

Wait, let me calculate the denominator: 13.6 * 11.4.

13.6 * 10 is 136, 13.6 * 1.4 is 19.04. So total is 136 + 19.04 = 155.04. So 13.6 * 11.4 = 155.04.

So x = 2.302585 / 155.04 ≈ let's calculate that.

2.302585 divided by 155.04 is approximately 0.01486 cm. But wait, the options are in the order of 10^2 cm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I mixed up the units. Let me check the units again.

Wait, μ_m is in cm²/g. ρ is in g/cm³. So μ_m * ρ is (cm²/g) * (g/cm³) = cm²/(cm³) ) = 1/cm. So μ_m * ρ is 13.6 * 11.4 = 155.04 cm^-1.

Wait, but wait, 13.6 cm²/g times 11.4 g/cm³ is indeed 155.04 cm^-1.

Then x is (ln(10))/ (155.04) ) because ln(1/10) is -ln(10), so we have positive 2.302585.

So x ≈ 2.302585 / 155.04 ≈ 0.01486 cm. That's 1.486e-2 cm. Wait, but that's 0.01486 cm, which is 0.1486 mm. But the options are all in the range of 10^2 cm, which is like meters or more, which doesn't make sense. Either I'm doing something wrong, or maybe I have the formula backwards.

Wait a minute. Maybe I should use the formula I = I₀ exp(- (μ/ρ) * ρ x ), which simplifies to exp(-μ x), but wait, in that case, μ would have units of cm^-1. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the mass absorption coefficient with the linear absorption coefficient.

Wait, let me think again. The mass absorption coefficient is μ_m = μ / ρ. So μ = μ_m * ρ. So the equation is I/I₀ = exp(-μ x) = exp(-μ_m * ρ x).

Wait, that's what I used earlier. So 0.1 = exp(- (13.6 cm²/g) * (11.4 g/cm³) * x )

Wait, but 13.6 cm²/g * 11.4 g/cm³ = 155.04 cm^{-1}.

So x = ln(10) / 155.04 ≈ 2.3026 / 155.04 ≈ 0.01486 cm. Wait, that's 0.01486 cm, which is 1.486 mm. But looking at the options, the first part is in the order of 1e2 cm, which is about 1 meter, which is way larger.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 13.6 * 11.4: 13 * 11 is 143, 13*0.4=5.2, 0.6*11=6.6, 0.6*0.4=0.24. Wait, no, that's not the way to calculate. Let me compute it directly.

13.6 * 11.4:

= (10 + 3.6) * (10 + 1.4)

= 10*10 + 10*1.4 + 3.6*10 + 3.6*1.4

= 100 + 14 + 36 + 5.04

= 100 +14=114; 114+36=150; 150+5.04=155.04. So that's correct.

So 13.6 * 11.4 =155.04 cm^{-1}.

Then ln(10) is about 2.3026. So 2.3026 / 155.04 ≈ 0.01486 cm, which is 0.01486 cm. But the options have values like 1.75e2 cm (175 cm), which is way bigger than 0.01486 cm.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong? Maybe I mixed up something. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the Beer-Lambert law for X-rays is:

I = I₀ exp(-μ x), where μ is the linear absorption coefficient (in cm⁻¹), and x is the thickness in cm.

But μ can be written as μ = μ_m * ρ, where μ_m is the mass absorption coefficient (cm²/g) and ρ is density (g/cm³).

So, yes, the equation is correct.

Wait, but 0.01486 cm is about 0.1486 mm. But the options are way larger, like 1e2 cm which is 1 meter. That's a big discrepancy. Maybe I have the mass absorption coefficient units wrong?

Wait, the problem says the mass absorption coefficients are 13.6 cm²/g and 58.0 cm²/g. So that's correct. So why am I getting such a small x?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula I/I₀ = e^(-μ_m * t), where t is the mass thickness (g/cm²). Wait, mass thickness would be t = ρ x. So in that case, the equation would be I/I₀ = e^(-μ_m * t), and t is in g/cm².

Wait, let's try that approach. So, I/I₀ = e^(-μ_m * t), where t is the mass per area (g/cm²). So t = ρ x. So x = t / ρ.

So if I use that approach, then for I/I₀ = 0.1:

0.1 = e^(-μ_m * t)

Take ln: ln(0.1) = -μ_m * t → t = -ln(0.1)/μ_m = ln(10)/μ_m.

So t = (2.3026) / 13.6 ≈ 0.1693 g/cm².

Wait, then x = t / ρ = 0.1693 / 11.4 ≈ 0.01485 cm, same as before. So same result. So that can't be.

Hmm, but the options are way larger. What am I doing wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula I/I₀ = e^(-μ x), but without considering that μ is in cm⁻¹. Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. So I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the question says "What thickness of palladium foil of density 11.4 g/cm³ reduces the intensity of the K_alpha radiation to one-tenth of its incident value?"

Wait, the numbers I've calculated give x ≈ 0.01486 cm, which is 1.486 mm. But none of the options are near that. The options are in the 1e2 cm range, which is 100 cm = 1 meter. So why is there such a big discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check another approach. Maybe it's using the formula without the density, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the mass absorption coefficient with the linear coefficient. Let me think again. The mass absorption coefficient μ_m is in cm²/g. And the linear absorption coefficient μ is μ_m * density (g/cm³), giving cm⁻¹.

So, μ = μ_m * ρ = 13.6 cm²/g * 11.4 g/cm³ = 155.04 cm⁻¹.

So the equation is I = I₀ e^{-μ x} = I₀ e^{-155.04 x}.

We set I/I₀ = 0.1 = e^{-155.04 x}.

So ln(0.1) = -155.04 x → x = ln(10)/155.04 ≈ 2.3026/155.04 ≈ 0.01486 cm.

So that's correct. But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, let's read the problem again. Oh wait, the mass absorption coefficients are given for silver, but the absorber is palladium. Wait, wait, wait! No, the problem says: "the mass absorption coefficients for the K_alpha and K_beta radiations of silver are 13.6 cm²/g and 58.0 cm²/g when palladium is used as an absorber."

Wait, wait, no. The wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse that.

"The mass absorption coefficients for the K_alpha and K_beta radiations of silver are 13.6 cm²/g and 58.0 cm²/g when palladium is used as an absorber."

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which material's properties are being used. Are the μ_m values for silver when palladium is the absorber? That doesn't make sense. Typically, the mass absorption coefficient depends on the absorber material, not the source. So perhaps the μ_m values are for palladium, not silver. Maybe the problem is miswritten, but the way it's phrased is that the coefficients are for silver's K radiations when using palladium as the absorber. Hmm, but that would imply that the absorber's properties are being considered, which would make sense, so μ_m is for palladium.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me think: when using palladium as the absorber, the mass absorption coefficients for silver's K_alpha and K_beta are 13.6 and 58.0 cm²/g. So that would mean that the palladium is absorbing the silver's X-rays, so the mass absorption coefficient is that of palladium for those particular X-rays.

So that's correct. So in that case, my calculation is correct. But then the x I got is 0.01486 cm, which is 1.486 mm, but none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 13.6 * 11.4 = let's compute that again.

13.6 * 10 = 136, 13.6 * 1.4 = 19.04. So 136 + 19.04 = 155.04 cm⁻¹.

So μ = 155.04 cm⁻¹.

So the equation is 0.1 = e^{-155.04 x}.

Take natural log: ln(0.1) = -155.04 x → x = ln(10)/155.04 ≈ 2.302585 / 155.04 ≈ 0.01486 cm. Which is 1.486 mm.

But the options are about 1e2 cm, which is 100 cm, 1 meter. So 100 times larger than my calculation. That suggests I made a mistake in unit conversion somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I used cm instead of meters somewhere. Wait, the units in the problem are cm²/g for μ_m and g/cm³ for density. So when I multiply them, I get (cm²/g) * (g/cm³) = cm²/(cm³) = 1/cm. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using μ in m²/kg or something else. But I don't think so. Let me think about possible alternative interpretations.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written differently. Maybe the formula uses the mass thickness t = ρ x, and the equation is I/I₀ = e^{-μ_m t}, so t = mass per area, in g/cm².

In that case, for I/I₀ = 0.1, t = (ln(10))/μ_m = 2.302585 / 13.6 ≈ 0.1693 g/cm².

Then, the thickness x is t / ρ = 0.1693 / 11.4 ≈ 0.01486 cm, same as before.

Hmm. So I'm getting the same result, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is using the wrong value for density? No, the problem states the density is 11.4 g/cm³.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the second part to find which option fits. Let's proceed.

Once I have x, I can compute the reduction for K_beta. So for K_beta, μ_m2 is 58.0 cm²/g. So the same approach applies.

First, calculate the intensity reduction for K_beta after passing through x thickness of palladium.

I2/I0 = e^{-μ_m2 * ρ * x}.

We have x from first part, 0.01486 cm.

So compute exponent: μ_m2 * ρ * x = 58.0 * 11.4 * 0.01486.

Let me compute 58 * 11.4 first. 58 * 10 = 580, 58 * 1.4 = 81.2. So 580 + 81.2 = 661.2. Then multiply by 0.01486.

So 661.2 * 0.01486 ≈ let's calculate 661.2 * 0.01 = 6.612; 661.2 * 0.00486 ≈ 3.213 (approx). So total ≈ 6.612 + 3.213 ≈ 9.825.

So the exponent is -9.825. So I2/I0 = e^{-9.825}.

Compute e^-9.825. Let me recall that e^-10 is about 4.5e-5. So e^-9.825 is slightly larger than that. Let's compute it.

Using calculator: e^9.825 ≈ e^9 * e^0.825.

e^9 ≈ 8103.08, e^0.825 ≈ 2.282. So 8103 * 2.282 ≈ 18,500. So e^9.825 ≈ 18,500. So e^-9.825 ≈ 1/18500 ≈ 5.4e-5.

So I2/I0 ≈ 5.4e-5, which is 0.0054%. So the percentage reduction is 100% - 0.0054% ≈ 99.9946%.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones have a percentage reduction near 99.99% or so.

Looking at the options:

Option H: 1.49e2 cm, 99.995%.
Option I: 1.6e2 cm, 98.5%
Option F: 2.0e2 cm, 99.0%
Option J: 1.3e2 cm, 95.5%
Option B: 2.5e2 cm, 89.995%
Option C: 1.0e2 cm, 92.0%

So the second part is about 99.99% reduction, which matches option H's 99.995%. But the x in option H is 1.49e2 cm, which is 149 cm, much larger than my calculated x of 0.01486 cm. So that can't be.

Wait, this suggests that my initial calculation is wrong. Because if I use option H's x of 149 cm, let's compute the first part.

Compute for K_alpha, with x = 1.49e2 cm = 149 cm.

μ = μ_m1 * ρ = 13.6 * 11.4 = 155.04 cm⁻¹.

Exponent: μ x = 155.04 * 149 ≈ 155 * 150 = 23250. But 149 is 1 less than 150, so 155.04 * 149 = 155.04*(150-1) = 23256 - 155.04 = 23100.96.

So the exponent is -23100.96. e^-23100 is an extremely small number, practically zero. So I/I0 would be zero, which is way less than 0.1. So that can't be.

Wait, that suggests that
