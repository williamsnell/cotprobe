Question:

You have just redesigned your kitchen. The new floor dimensions are 7'6" × 11'8". Now you want to cover the floor with linoleum, which sells for $1.79 per running foot in 6' width, what is the best way to cover the floor? How much will it cost?

Options:

A: $48.60
B: $26.85
C: $30.99
D: $42.56
E: $29.99
F: $38.40
G: $31.50
H: $23.94
I: $20.12
J: $35.70

Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the cost of linoleum for a kitchen floor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on area calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to find the area of the kitchen floor. The dimensions given are 7 feet 6 inches by 11 feet 8 inches. Oh wait, I should convert those mixed numbers into either all feet or all inches to make the multiplication easier. Let me convert them to feet because the final calculation is in feet for the linoleum.

Wait, 7 feet 6 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is 0.5 feet. So that's 7.5 feet. Similarly, 11 feet 8 inches. 8 inches is 8/12, which is 2/3 of a foot, approximately 0.6667 feet. So 11.6667 feet.

Now, the area is length times width. So 7.5 ft multiplied by 11.6667 ft. Let me calculate that. 7.5 * 11 is 82.5, and 7.5 * 0.6667 is about 5. So total area is approximately 87.5 square feet. Wait, let me be more precise. 7.5 * 11.6667 = ?

Hmm, 7 * 11.6667 is 81.6669, and 0.5 * 11.6667 is 5.83335. Adding those gives 81.6669 + 5.83335 = 87.50025 square feet. So approximately 87.5 sq ft.

But wait, linoleum is sold by the running foot in 6-foot width. So each running foot is a 6ft wide by 1ft long strip, right? So the area per running foot is 6 sq ft (since 6ft * 1ft=6 sq ft). 

So to find out how many running feet I need, I divide the total area by the area per running foot. That would be 87.5 / 6. Let me compute that. 6 goes into 87 fourteen times (14*6=84), with a remainder of 3.5. So 14.5833 running feet. Since you can't buy a fraction of a foot, I'd have to round up to the next whole number. So 15 running feet.

Wait, but let me think again. If each running foot is 6ft wide, then each foot covers 6 sq ft. So 87.5 /6 = 14.5833. So I need 14.5833 running feet. But you can't buy a fraction, so you round up to 15. So 15 running feet.

Now, the cost is $1.79 per running foot. So total cost is 15 * 1.79. Let me calculate that. 10 *1.79 is $17.90, and 5*1.79 is $8.95. Adding them gives 17.90 +8.95 = 26.85. So the total cost would be $26.85.

Looking at the options, option B is $26.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe I should double-check the area calculation. Let me compute 7.5 * 11.6667 again. 7 * 11 is 77, 7 * 0.6667 is about 4.6669, 0.5 *11 is 5.5, 0.5 *0.6667 is 0.3333. So adding all: 77 +4.6669=81.6669, 5.5+0.3333=5.8333. 81.6669 + 5.8333= 87.5002. Yep, that's correct.

Another thing to consider: when you buy linoleum, sometimes you have to account for waste or cutting, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think we can ignore it. So 15 running feet at $1.79 each is indeed $26.85. So option B.

To determine the cost of covering the kitchen floor with linoleum, we first calculate the area of the floor. The dimensions are given as 7'6" × 11'8". Converting these to feet:

- 7'6" = 7.5 feet (since 6 inches = 0.5 feet).  
- 11'8" = 11.6667 feet (since 8 inches = 0.6667 feet).  

The area is then:  
\[
\text{Area} = 7.5 \, \text{ft} \times 11.6667 \, \text{ft} = 87.5 \, \text{square feet}.
\]

Linoleum is sold by the running foot, with each running foot covering 6 square feet (6 feet wide × 1 foot long). To find the number of running feet needed, divide the total area by the area per running foot:  
\[
\text{Running Feet Needed} = \frac{87.5}{6} \approx 14.5833.
\]  
Since you cannot purchase a fraction of a foot, round up to the next whole number:  
\[
\text{Running Feet to Buy} = 15.
\]

The cost of linoleum is $1.79 per running foot. Therefore, the total cost is:  
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 15 \times 1.79 = 26.85.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: $26.85**.
