Question:

I nsulin , interferon, and growth hormone have been successfully manufactured in large quantities by the pharmaceutical industries. Explain the importance of genetic engineering in this process.

Options:

A: Genetic engineering facilitates the mass production of these proteins by enhancing the animals' ability to produce them in their milk.
B: Genetic engineering assists in the development of new pharmaceutical drugs.
C: Genetic engineering is primarily used for cloning organisms, which increases the yield of insulin, interferon, and growth hormone.
D: Genetic engineering enables the creation of completely synthetic substitutes for insulin, interferon, and growth hormone that do not rely on biological processes.
E: Genetic engineering improves the nutritional value of food which indirectly helps in the production of these proteins.
F: Genetic engineering allows for the direct extraction of insulin, interferon, and growth hormone from genetically modified plants.
G: Genetic engineering is used to modify the human genome to produce insulin, interferon, and growth hormone naturally in the body.
H: Genetic engineering allows for the large scale production of proteins such as insulin, interferon, and growth hormone through recombinant DNA techniques, lowering their prices and making them more accessible.
I: Genetic engineering helps in understanding the genetic basis of diseases.
J: Genetic engineering aids in the diagnosis of diseases.

Okay, so I have this question about genetic engineering and its role in producing insulin, interferon, and growth hormone. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

Hmm, I remember that before genetic engineering, getting these proteins was tough. Like, insulin used to be extracted from animals, right? But that had issues like limited supply and purity problems. Then genetic engineering came into play. Oh wait, they use recombinant DNA technology. That's where they take the gene from one organism and put it into another, like bacteria, to produce the protein.

So the question is asking why genetic engineering is important for manufacturing these proteins in large quantities. Let's look at the options.

Option A says it's about enhancing animals' ability to produce proteins in their milk. Wait, that's like transgenic animals, maybe? But isn't that just one method? I think the broader approach is using microorganisms like E. coli. So maybe A isn't the best answer.

Option B is about developing new drugs. Well, genetic engineering does help create new drugs, but the question is specifically about manufacturing existing proteins like insulin. So B might not be the right fit here.

Option C talks about cloning organisms to increase yield. Cloning might be part of it, but I think it's more about the recombinant DNA part. Plus, cloning would be more about reproducing organisms, not directly producing proteins in large amounts.

Option D says it creates synthetic substitutes. No, genetic engineering isn't about making synthetic substitutes. It's about using biological systems to produce the actual proteins.

Option E is about improving food's nutritional value. I don't see the connection here. The question is about producing medical proteins, not food quality.

Option F suggests extracting from modified plants. Oh, like using plants as bioreactors. That's a method, but I think the main method is using bacteria or yeast. Plus, the question is about why genetic engineering is important in general, not specific to plants.

Option G talks about modifying the human genome. No, that's gene therapy, and it's not what's done for producing these proteins. They're made outside the human body.

Option H says it allows large-scale production using recombinant DNA, lowering costs and making them accessible. That sounds right. Recombinant DNA techniques let bacteria produce human proteins, which can be done on a large scale. This makes the proteins cheaper and more available.

Option I is about understanding disease genetics. That's more about research, not production.

Option J is about disease diagnosis. Also not related to manufacturing proteins.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is H because it directly addresses the use of recombinant DNA for large-scale production, which lowers costs and increases accessibility.

The correct answer is H. Genetic engineering is important for the large-scale production of proteins like insulin, interferon, and growth hormone through recombinant DNA techniques. This method allows bacteria or other organisms to produce human proteins efficiently, reducing costs and making these essential proteins more accessible.

Answer: H
