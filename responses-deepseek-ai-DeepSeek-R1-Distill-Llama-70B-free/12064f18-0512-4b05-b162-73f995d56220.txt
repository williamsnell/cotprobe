Okay, so I have this logarithm problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a try. The question is asking me to find log base 10 of 12, given that log10(3) is 0.4771 and log10(4) is 0.6021. Hmm, I remember that logarithms have some properties that let us break them down, so maybe I can use those to find the answer.

Wait, let me think about the number 12. Oh right, 12 can be factored into prime factors. So 12 is 3 times 4, right? Because 3*4 is 12. So that means log10(12) is the same as log10(3*4). 

From what I remember, there's a logarithm rule that says log_b(m*n) equals log_b m plus log_b n. So applying that here, log10(12) should be log10(3) plus log10(4). 

So I can just add the two given values. Log10(3) is 0.4771 and log10(4) is 0.6021. Adding them together, 0.4771 + 0.6021. Let me do that addition. 

0.4771 plus 0.6021. Let's add the decimals: 0.4 + 0.6 is 1.0, 0.07 + 0.00 is 0.07, 0.007 + 0.002 is 0.009, and 0.0001 + 0.0001 is 0.0002. Wait, maybe I should just add them straight.

Adding 0.4771 and 0.6021: 
The thousandths place: 1 +1 is 2.
Hundredths: 7 + 0 is 7.
Tenths: 7 + 0 is 7.
Units: 4 + 6 is 10, but wait, since it's decimal, it's 10 in the tenths place. So that would be 1.0792? Wait, wait, no. Let me do it properly.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me write them aligned:

 0.4771
+0.6021
---------
Adding each column:

Ones place: 0 +0=0
Tenths: 4 +6=10 → put 0, carry 1.
Hundredths:7+0=7 plus the carry 1 makes 8.
Thousandths:7+2=9.
Ten-thousandths: 1+1=2.
Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, 0.4771 is 0.4771, which is four tenths, seven hundredths, seven thousandths, one ten-thousandth. Similarly, 0.6021 is six tenths, zero hundredths, two thousandths, one ten-thousandth.

So adding each place:

Tenths: 4 +6 =10 → write 0, carry 1.
Hundredths:7 +0=7 +1 (carry) =8.
Thousandths:7 +2=9.
Ten-thousandths:1 +1=2.

So the sum is 1.0792. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 3*4=12, and 10^1 is 10, so log10(12) should be a little more than 1, like 1.079... which makes sense. 

But looking at the options, I don't see 1.0792, but the options are all in terms of sums. So the question is asking which option correctly represents the sum of log10(3) and log10(4). 

Looking at the options, option D is .4771 + .6021, which is exactly what I did. So that's the correct choice. 

Let me double-check the other options just to be sure. Option A is .3771 + .6021, which would be if log10(3) were 0.3771, but that's not the case. Option B has .4770 instead of .4771, which is a tiny difference but not correct. Option C is .4771 + .6011, but log10(4) is .6021, so that's wrong. Option E adds .7021, which is way off. The others have different numbers, so D is the correct one.

To find \( \log_{10} 12 \), we start by expressing 12 as the product of its prime factors: \( 12 = 3 \times 4 \). Using the logarithm property \( \log_b(m \cdot n) = \log_b m + \log_b n \), we can write:

\[
\log_{10} 12 = \log_{10} (3 \cdot 4) = \log_{10} 3 + \log_{10} 4
\]

From the given values, \( \log_{10} 3 = 0.4771 \) and \( \log_{10} 4 = 0.6021 \). Adding these together:

\[
\log_{10} 12 = 0.4771 + 0.6021
\]

This matches option D. Verifying the other options:

- **A**: \( 0.3771 + 0.6021 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 3 \) is not \( 0.3771 \).
- **B**: \( 0.4770 + 0.6021 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 3 \) is \( 0.4771 \), not \( 0.4770 \).
- **C**: \( 0.4771 + 0.6011 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 4 \) is \( 0.6021 \), not \( 0.6011 \).
- **E**: \( 0.4771 + 0.7021 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 4 \) is not \( 0.7021 \).
- **F**: \( 0.5771 + 0.5021 \) is incorrect as it does not match the given values.
- **G**: \( 0.4772 + 0.6021 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 3 \) is \( 0.4771 \), not \( 0.4772 \).
- **H**: \( 0.4771 + 0.6020 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 4 \) is \( 0.6021 \), not \( 0.6020 \).
- **I**: \( 0.8771 + 0.6021 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 3 \) is not \( 0.8771 \).
- **J**: \( 0.4771 + 0.5021 \) is incorrect because \( \log_{10} 4 \) is not \( 0.5021 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
