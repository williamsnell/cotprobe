Question:

Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar to open a hardware store. Ted's only interest in the business was the repayment of his 5-year unsecured loan. Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as "partners" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is

Options:

Okay, so I've got this question about business entities and liability. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

So, the situation is Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar to start a hardware store. Ted's only interest was getting repaid over five years, and it's an unsecured loan. Bob named the business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware." He bought signs and ads with this name, and on the stationery, he listed both Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as "partners." When Ted found out, he was flattered and reduced the interest rate. Later, Pete Smith sold goods to the store, thinking both were partners. Now Pete can't collect and wants advice.

Hmm. The question is about who is liable for Pete's goods. So, the options are about whether the business entity is liable, or Bob, Ted, both, etc.

I think the key here is whether Ted and Bob are considered partners. Because if they are, then both could be liable for the business debts. But Ted didn't really act as a partner; he was just a lender. So maybe it's about apparent partnership or something like that.

Wait, so Bob held them out as partners. By putting their names on the stationery and signs, he might have created an apparent partnership. So, under the principles of partnership law, if someone holds themselves out as a partner, they can be liable to third parties who rely on that representation.

So, Ted didn't agree to be a partner. But Bob's actions might have made Pete believe that Ted was a partner, and Pete relied on that. So, the question is whether Ted can be held liable for the debts incurred by the business when Pete dealt with them thinking Ted was a partner.

In partnership law, there's the concept of "apparent partnership" or "ostensible partnership." If a person (here, Ted) allows another to hold him out as a partner, or if he does something that makes others believe he's a partner, he might be estopped from denying it if a third party relies on that to their detriment.

So, in this case, Ted didn't agree to be a partner, but Bob listed him as a partner on stationery and signs. When Ted found out, he didn't stop it; instead, he reduced the interest rate. Wait, but reducing the interest rate doesn't necessarily mean he agreed to become a partner. It might just be a friendly gesture.

But the key is whether the third party (Pete) was led to believe that Ted was a partner. If so, then Ted could be liable under the theory of apparent authority or estoppel.

So, the general rule is that if a person is held out as a partner, and a third party relies on that, the person can be held liable as an apparent partner. So, Bob is definitely liable as the actual owner, but Ted might also be liable because Pete thought he was a partner.

But wait, Ted's only involvement was as a lender. He didn't take part in the management or share profits. So, is Ted liable?

I think under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), if a person is not a partner but allows another to represent them as a partner, they can be liable to third parties who rely on that representation. So, Bob represented Ted as a partner, and Pete relied on that.

Therefore, Ted could be held liable for the debts of the business as an apparent partner. So, both Bob and Ted would be jointly liable.

Wait, but let me think again. Bob named the business as a partnership, which might lead people to believe it's a partnership. But Ted's role was just a lender. So, is Bob a sole proprietor who just happened to have a loan from Ted, and Ted's name is used in the business name?

Alternatively, maybe it's a de facto partnership or a de jure partnership. De jure means the legal partnership, while de facto is an actual partnership. But in this case, they don't have a partnership agreement, so it's not a de jure partnership. But Bob is holding out Ted as a partner, so it's more about apparent partnership.

So, the question is whether Ted is liable as an apparent partner. If so, then both could be liable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says both are liable jointly. Option E says Bob is liable for the entire amount, Ted only if Bob can't pay. Option H says both are independently liable. Wait, what's the difference between jointly and independently?

In partnership liability, partners are jointly and severally liable. So, a creditor can go after either partner for the full amount. So, if both are partners, they're both on the hook for the entire debt, but each can be sued for the full amount.

In this case, if Ted is an apparent partner, then he's liable as a partner would be. So, Pete can go after either Bob or Ted for the full amount.

Wait, but the options don't exactly say that. Let me look again.

Option C: Bob and Ted are liable jointly. So, maybe that's correct because they're both liable together. Option E says Bob is liable for the entire amount, Ted only if Bob can't pay. That sounds more like the situation where Ted is only a surety or guarantor, but in this case, Ted might be an apparent partner, so he's equally liable.

So, the correct option would be C, where both are jointly liable.

But wait, another angle: Bob is the borrower and the business is his, so is the business a sole proprietorship? If so, the business's debts are Bob's personal liability. But if Ted is held out as a partner, then Ted might also be personally liable.

Wait, but the business entity itself, if it's a sole proprietorship, there's no separate entity. So, the debts are Bob's. But if Ted is an apparent partner, then Ted is also liable.

So, the question is whether Pete can hold Ted liable. So, the advice would be that Pete can go after both Bob and Ted because they appear to be partners.

So, looking at the options, option C says they are liable jointly. Option E says Bob is liable for the entire amount, Ted only if Bob can't pay. That might not be correct because if Ted is an apparent partner, he is equally liable as Bob.

Therefore, the correct answer would be C: Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.

Wait, but another thought: if Ted is not a partner, but the business is a sole proprietorship, then Bob is solely liable. But the fact that Bob held Ted out as a partner might make Ted liable as well.

So, perhaps the correct option is C.

Alternatively, does the business entity (if it's a partnership) have liability? No, because in a general partnership, the partners are liable, not the partnership entity itself.

Wait, but the business isn't a separate entity here. Because Bob and Ted didn't form a partnership. So, if it's just a sole proprietorship, the business is Bob. But by representing that Ted is a partner, Bob may have made Ted liable as an apparent partner.

In that case, both Bob and Ted would be liable for the debts incurred when the creditor (Pete) relied on that representation.

So, the advice to Pete would be that both Bob and Ted are liable jointly. So, option C.

The question revolves around determining the liability for debts incurred by "Wilson and Lamar Hardware" after Pete Smith sold goods to the business and was unable to collect payment. The key issue is whether Ted Lamar, who loaned Bob Wilson $20,000 to start the business, can be held liable for the debts despite not being an actual partner.

Bob Wilson named the business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware" and represented both himself and Ted Lamar as "partners" on stationery and signs. This created an apparent partnership, as third parties like Pete Smith could reasonably believe that Ted Lamar was a partner. Under partnership law, when a person allows themselves to be held out as a partner, they can be held liable to third parties who rely on that representation to their detriment.

Although Ted Lamar's only involvement was as a lender, his failure to correct the representation of being a partner, combined with his voluntary reduction of the loan's interest rate, could reinforce the perception that he was involved in the business. Therefore, Ted Lamar may be liable under the doctrine of apparent partnership or estoppel.

Given this analysis, both Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are jointly liable for the debts incurred by the business, as Pete Smith relied on the representation that both were partners. This makes option C the correct answer.

**Answer: C**
