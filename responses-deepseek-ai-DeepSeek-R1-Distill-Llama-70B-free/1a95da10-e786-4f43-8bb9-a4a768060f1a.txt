Question:

A defendant was prosecuted for murder. At trial, the prosecutor called a police detective to testify. The detective, who questioned the defendant at the station house after his arrest, testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence. The detective further testified that when given the opportunity to take a lie detector test, the defendant refused. The defendant's attorney did not object to the detective's testimony. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to prison. The defendant, who is now represented by a new attorney, appeals, claiming that it was error to admit the detective's testimony. The appellate court should find

Options:

A: plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.
B: no error, because the defendant refused the lie detector test, implying guilt
C: harmless error, because the defendant's statements were admissions.
D: harmless error, because the defendant's refusal to take the lie detector test was relevant information for the jury.
E: harmless error, because the defendant was given the opportunity to defend his statements
F: harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.
G: plain error, because the detective's testimony was hearsay
H: plain error, because the defendant was not read his rights prior to the questioning
I: no error, because the detective's testimony was valid evidence
J: plain error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law and criminal procedure, I think. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a defendant being prosecuted for murder. At the trial, the prosecutor called a police detective who testified about two things: first, that the defendant initially declared his innocence when questioned after arrest, and second, that the defendant refused a lie detector test when given the opportunity.

The defendant's attorney didn't object to this testimony. Now, the defendant appeals, saying it was error to admit that testimony. The question is what the appellate court should find.

The options are A through J, each presenting a different legal conclusion.

Let me break this down. First, the key issues here are about the admissibility of the detective's testimony. The two points are the defendant's declaration of innocence and his refusal to take a lie detector test.

I remember that statements made by a defendant can sometimes be admissible, but there are rules about them. Also, lie detector tests—polygraphs—have specific rules around their admissibility.

So, the first part: the defendant declared his innocence. That sounds like an exculpatory statement. Generally, the prosecution can use a defendant's statements against them, but under certain conditions. I think if the defendant makes a statement that's exculpatory, like "I didn't do it," that might be admissible as an admission. But wait, isn't that hearsay? Because the detective is testifying about what the defendant said, which is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter. Unless it falls under an exception, it's hearsay.

But wait, statements by a party opponent are not hearsay. Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or the party himself. So the defendant's own statement would be admissible as a party admission. So that part might be okay. But I'm not entirely sure if the declaration of innocence is considered an admission or if it's exculpatory and thus inadmissible. Hmm.

Wait, no, because an admission is a statement that's offered against the party, and it doesn't have to be a confession. So the defendant saying he's innocent could be an admission, but wait, that doesn't make sense because it's exculpatory. Oh wait no, perhaps it's treated differently. Because if the defendant makes a statement that's self-serving, like "I didn't do it," that's not necessarily an admission of a fact; it's more of a denial. So maybe that's not an admission under the rules. So perhaps the detective's testimony about the defendant's denial is hearsay and inadmissible unless another exception applies.

Alternatively, maybe it's admissible under the statement against interest exception, but that usually applies when the statement is against the declarant's interest and the declarant is unavailable. Here, the defendant is available, so that might not apply.

Wait, but when a defendant makes a statement to the police, the prosecutor can use it as an admission. So I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the declaration of innocence isn't an admission because it's not acknowledging any fact that's relevant. It's more of a denial.

Alternatively, maybe it's allowed under the rule that prior inconsistent statements can be used, but that's when the statement is made under oath. I'm a bit fuzzy on this point.

But perhaps the bigger issue here is the second part: the refusal to take the lie detector test. I remember that in some cases, a defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test is inadmissible because it's considered that the results are not reliable, and thus the refusal doesn't necessarily imply guilt. But is the refusal itself admissible?

I think that under the Supreme Court case of United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171 (1975), the use of a defendant's post-Miranda silence (including refusal to take a polygraph) can't be used against him because it might infringe on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Wait, but in this case, the defendant was already under arrest and had been read his Miranda rights, I assume. So when he refused the polygraph, that's after being in custody.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether Miranda warnings were given. Oh, but the defendant was arrested and questioned at the station house, so I think Miranda applies here. So when the defendant refused the polygraph, that's a post-Miranda silence. But wait, in Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976), the Court held that using a defendant's post-Miranda silence against them violates the Due Process Clause. So if the defendant remained silent after being given Miranda warnings, the prosecution can't use that silence against him.

But in this case, the defendant didn't remain silent; he declared his innocence. So maybe that's different. But the refusal to take the polygraph—does that count as an adoptive admission or something else?

Wait, another angle: the admissibility of polygraph results. I know that polygraph results are generally inadmissible because they're not reliable. But what about the refusal? I think that under some cases, the refusal can be admitted as evidence of consciousness of guilt. But other cases say that it's inadmissible because it's not reliable evidence of guilt.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about it differently. The issue is whether the detective's testimony about the refusal is admissible. If the refusal is being used to imply guilt, then it's problematic.

In the case of Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231 (1980), the Supreme Court held that a defendant's pre-arrest silence could be used for impeachment purposes, but I'm not sure about the refusal of a polygraph.

Alternatively, I think that under the Federal Rules, evidence of a polygraph test is inadmissible, but the refusal might be considered under a different rule.

Wait, another point: the defendant's attorney didn't object to the testimony, so the issue might not have been preserved unless it's plain error. So the appellate court would review for plain error if the attorney didn't object.

So the options A and G mention plain error. Option A says it's plain error because the court should have struck the reference on its own. Option G says it's plain error because the testimony was hearsay.

Wait, but if the testimony was hearsay, then it's inadmissible. So the detective testifying about what the defendant said is hearsay unless an exception applies.

Earlier, I thought that the defendant's statement of innocence might be admissible as a party admission, but maybe it's not. Because the statement is exculpatory, so perhaps it's not an admission under 801(d)(2)(A), which refers to admissions by a party-opponent. But I think that any statement made by the party can be an admission, regardless of whether it's inculpatory or exculpatory. Wait, no, because an admission is typically something that amounts to a prior acknowledgment by the party of one of the relevant facts. So if the defendant says "I didn't do it," that's a denial, not an admission of a fact. So it might not qualify as an admission under the hearsay exception.

Thus, the detective's testimony about the defendant's statement would be hearsay, and unless another exception applies, it's inadmissible. So that would mean the testimony was erroneously admitted, making option G a possibility (plain error because it's hearsay). But wait, I'm not sure if the statement is hearsay or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible under the rule that allows the prosecution to use a defendant's statements as admissions. But if the statement is exculpatory, maybe it's not an admission. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the defendant's statement of innocence is not hearsay because it's not offered to prove the truth of the matter. Wait, no. The prosecution is offering it to show that the defendant made the statement, but that might not be the case. Wait, no—if the detective is testifying that the defendant said he was innocent, the prosecution might be offering it to show that the defendant was lying, implying guilt. So the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter—that the defendant claimed innocence—but that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

So without an exception, it's inadmissible. So the testimony about the defendant's statement would be hearsay, making option G a possibility (plain error because it's hearsay). But the other part is about the refusal of the lie detector test.

Wait, the other part is the refusal. Is that hearsay? The detective testifies that the defendant refused the test. That's not hearsay because it's not a statement being offered for the truth of the matter. It's an action—refusal—which is non-hearsay. So the issue with the refusal is whether it's admissible as evidence of guilt.

But as I thought earlier, using a defendant's post-Miranda refusal to take a polygraph might be problematic under Doyle, but I'm not entirely sure. Because Doyle was about using post-Miranda silence, not about polygraph refusals. But perhaps the same principle applies—using the defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent (or in this case, to refuse the polygraph) against him would violate due process.

Alternatively, the refusal to take a polygraph could be considered as evidence of consciousness of guilt, but I'm not sure if that's permissible.

Wait, I think that under the Federal Rules, evidence of a defendant's refusal to take a polygraph is generally inadmissible because polygraph results are not reliable, and the refusal doesn't necessarily indicate guilt. But I'm not certain about the exact rule.

Alternatively, the admissibility of the refusal would depend on whether it's being used as substantive evidence. If the prosecution is using it as evidence of guilt, then it might be inadmissible. But if it's being used for some other purpose, maybe it's okay.

But in any case, the main issue is that the defendant's attorney didn't object. So the appellate court would review for plain error if the error is clear and affects substantial rights.

So looking at the options:

Option A: plain error because the court should have struck the reference on its own. So this is about the lie detector refusal.

Option G: plain error because the testimony was hearsay.

Which of these is correct?

If the testimony about the defendant's statement is hearsay and inadmissible, then G would be correct. But if it's admissible under a hearsay exception, then G isn't correct.

Alternatively, the refusal to take the polygraph is inadmissible, but the statement about innocence is admissible, making part of the testimony okay and part not.

Wait, but the question is about the entire testimony. The detective testified about both the declaration and the refusal. So both parts might be problematic.

But focusing on the hearsay aspect: the declaration of innocence is hearsay unless an exception applies. If it's not an admission, then it's inadmissible. So the detective's testimony about the defendant's statement would be hearsay. Thus, it's plain error for the court to allow it without an objection, as the error is clear.

So option G says plain error because it's hearsay. That would make sense.

But wait, another possibility is that the refusal to take the polygraph is inadmissible, but the declaration of innocence is admissible. So which part is causing the error?

Wait, the question is about the entire testimony. So if either part is inadmissible, then the testimony as a whole might be problematic.

But the options don't break it down; they address the overall situation.

So, considering that both parts may have issues, but the hearsay issue is more straightforward.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the correct answer is likely to be.

I remember that a defendant's refusal to take a polygraph test is generally inadmissible as evidence of guilt because it's considered that the refusal doesn't reliably indicate guilt. So the detective's testimony about the refusal would be inadmissible, and that's a clear error.

But wait, the option that says that is option A: plain error because the court should have struck the reference to the lie detector test.

Alternatively, option D says it's harmless error because the refusal was relevant. But I don't think it's harmless; if it's inadmissible, then it's an error.

Wait, but the other part of the detective's testimony was about the defendant's declaration of innocence. If that's admissible, then perhaps the error is only as to the refusal part. But the question is about the entire testimony.

Wait, the question is whether the appellate court should find error in admitting the detective's testimony. So if part of it is inadmissible and part is admissible, the overall effect would depend on whether the error was preserved and whether it's harmless.

But since the attorney didn't object, the appellate court can only reverse if it's plain error.

So if the detective's testimony about the refusal is inadmissible, that's an error. But is it plain error?

I think that the admissibility of a refusal to take a polygraph is a well-established rule. So if the court allowed it, that's plain error.

So looking at the options, option A suggests plain error because the lie detector reference should have been stricken. So that would fit.

Alternatively, option D says it's harmless error because the refusal was relevant. But I don't think it's harmless because the refusal could imply guilt, which is prejudicial.

Wait, but another angle: the defendant's declaration of innocence. If that's admissible, perhaps as an admission, then the only problem is the refusal part. But if the refusal is inadmissible, then the testimony about it should have been excluded.

So the appellate court should find that it was plain error to admit the testimony about the refusal, because it's inadmissible. So the error is the admission of the refusal part.

Looking at the options, option A is about the lie detector reference, so that would be the correct choice.

But I'm a bit confused because option G is about hearsay. If the declaration of innocence is hearsay and inadmissible, then option G would be correct.

Wait, so which is the correct analysis?

The declaration of innocence is a statement by the defendant. Is that hearsay? If the prosecution is offering it to prove that the defendant is guilty because he initially lied, then it's being offered for the truth of the matter, which would make it hearsay unless an exception applies.

But I think that under the rule, a defendant's own statement is an admission by a party-opponent, so it's not hearsay. So FRE 801(d)(2)(A) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party or their agent. So the defendant's statement is admissible as a party admission.

Therefore, the testimony about the declaration of innocence is admissible, so no error there.

The problem is the refusal to take the polygraph. So the detective's testimony about that is inadmissible. So the error is in admitting that part.

So the overall testimony had an error regarding the refusal part, but the declaration part was okay.

So the appellate court should find that the refusal part was error. Since the attorney didn't object, it's reviewed under plain error.

Therefore, option A is correct: plain error because the court should have struck the lie detector reference.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.

Yes, that matches.

Alternatively, option D says it's harmless error because the refusal was relevant. But I don't think it's harmless because the refusal could have influenced the jury.

So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the declaration was admissible as a party admission, so the only error is the lie detector part. Thus, the court should have struck that part, making option A correct.

But I'm still a bit unsure about whether the declaration is hearsay. Because if it's a party admission, then it's not hearsay. So the only error is the refusal part, making option A the correct choice.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a police detective's testimony at trial, specifically regarding two statements: the defendant's declaration of innocence and his refusal to take a lie detector test. The defendant's attorney did not object to this testimony, and the defendant now appeals, claiming error in its admission. The appellate court must determine whether the testimony was admissible or whether its admission constitutes error.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Declaration of Innocence**:
   - The detective testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence. This statement is a denial and not an admission of guilt. However, under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 801(d)(2)(A)), a statement made by a party-opponent (here, the defendant) is not considered hearsay and is admissible as a party admission. Therefore, the testimony about the defendant's declaration of innocence is admissible.

2. **Refusal to Take a Lie Detector Test**:
   - The detective also testified that the defendant refused to take a lie detector test. This part of the testimony is problematic. Polygraph results are generally inadmissible due to their unreliability, and a defendant's refusal to take a polygraph test is also inadmissible as evidence of guilt. Using such refusal to imply guilt violates the defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as established by cases like *United States v. Hale* and *Doyle v. Ohio*. Thus, the testimony about the refusal should have been excluded.

3. **Plain Error Review**:
   - Since the defendant's attorney did not object to the testimony, the appellate court reviews for plain error. Plain error occurs when the error is clear, affects substantial rights, and seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The admission of the refusal to take the lie detector test constitutes plain error because it is a well-established rule that such evidence is inadmissible.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The trial court should have acted on its own motion to strike the reference to the lie detector test, as its admission was plain error.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The refusal to take a lie detector test does not necessarily imply guilt and is inadmissible as evidence of guilt.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The defendant's statements were not admissions in the legal sense, as they were exculpatory.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The refusal to take the lie detector test is not harmless error because it could prejudice the jury by implying guilt.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The defendant's opportunity to defend his statements does not cure the error in admitting the refusal to take the lie detector test.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While the trial attorney's failure to object means the issue is reviewed for plain error, this does not negate the fact that the admission of the refusal was error.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The testimony about the declaration of innocence is admissible as a party admission and not hearsay.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. There is no indication that the defendant's rights were violated prior to the questioning
