Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. It says that there's an oscillator with a frequency of 2.3 × 10^8 Hz near a plane metal reflector. The distance between adjacent nodes in the standing waves is 65 cm. I need to compute the velocity of light from this data.

Hmm, I remember that standing waves are formed due to interference between two waves, like when a wave reflects off a surface. In this case, the oscillator is probably emitting waves that reflect off the metal, creating a standing wave pattern.

The distance between adjacent nodes is given as 65 cm. Wait, nodes are points where the amplitude is zero, right? And in a standing wave, the distance between two consecutive nodes is half the wavelength. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. The nodes occur at intervals of half a wavelength (λ/2) because the wave must interfere destructively. For a standing wave, like in a string fixed at both ends, the nodes are at every λ/2 distance.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the distance between adjacent nodes is λ/2. Because the first node is at λ/2 from the antinode, then another at λ, which is two nodes apart, but wait, wait. Let me clarify. For a standing wave pattern, the nodes are spaced by λ/2. So if the distance between two adjacent nodes is 65 cm, that would mean λ/2 = 65 cm. So the full wavelength λ would be 130 cm. Is that right?

Yes, because if nodes are at every half wavelength, then the distance between two nodes is half a wavelength. So if the distance is 65 cm, then λ/2 is 65 cm, so λ is 130 cm. Got it.

Now, the oscillator's frequency is given as 2.3 × 10^8 Hz. But wait, what kind of wave is this? The question is about the velocity of light, so maybe these are electromagnetic waves. So the speed of the wave is the speed of light, which is what we're trying to find.

Wait, but wait, in physics, the velocity of a wave is given by v = f * λ. So if I can find the wavelength and the frequency, I can compute the velocity.

Wait, but the frequency is given, but is that the frequency in the medium? Oh, but the problem doesn't mention any medium other than vacuum, so I guess we're assuming it's in vacuum. So the velocity should be the speed of light in vacuum, approximately 3 × 10^10 cm/s, but let me see.

Wait, the oscillator's frequency is 2.3e8 Hz. So f is 2.3e8 Hz. The wavelength λ is 130 cm, as I calculated. So velocity v = f * λ.

Wait, but wait: units! Let's make sure the units are consistent. The frequency is in Hz, which is s^-1. The wavelength is in cm. So when I multiply f (Hz) by λ (cm), the units become cm/s, which is correct for velocity.

So calculating v = (2.3 × 10^8 s^-1) * (130 cm) = ?

Let me compute that. 2.3e8 * 130 = ?

2.3 * 130 is 299. So 2.3e8 * 130 = 299e8 cm/s.

Wait, 2.3 ×10^8 multiplied by 130 is 2.3e8 * 1.3e2 = (2.3 * 1.3) × 10^(8+2) = 2.99 × 10^10 cm/s.

Oh, that's interesting. So the velocity v is 2.99 × 10^10 cm/s. Looking at the options, option A is 2.99e10 cm/s, option C is 2.99e9.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me double-check my calculation. 2.3 × 10^8 Hz multiplied by 130 cm.

2.3e8 *130 = 2.3 *1.3e2 * 1e8 = (2.99) *1e10 = 2.99e10 cm/s.

Yes, that seems correct. So the speed is 2.99e10 cm/s. Which corresponds to option A.

Wait, but wait, what's the standard speed of light? I thought it was approximately 3e8 m/s, which is 3e10 cm/s. So 2.99e10 cm/s is just about right. So yes, the correct answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the standing wave pattern formed by the oscillator and the plane metal reflector. The distance between adjacent nodes in the standing wave is given as 65 cm. In a standing wave, the nodes are spaced by half the wavelength, i.e., the distance between two adjacent nodes is \( \lambda/2 \). Therefore, the full wavelength is:

\[
\lambda = 2 \times 65 \, \text{cm} = 130 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The frequency of the oscillator is given as \( f = 2.3 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz} \). The velocity of the wave is related to the frequency and wavelength by the formula:

\[
v = f \cdot \lambda.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
v = (2.3 \times 10^8 \, \text{s}^{-1}) \cdot (130 \, \text{cm}) = 2.3 \cdot 130 \cdot 10^8 \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v = 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

This matches the speed of light in vacuum, which is approximately \( 3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: \( 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/sec} \).**
