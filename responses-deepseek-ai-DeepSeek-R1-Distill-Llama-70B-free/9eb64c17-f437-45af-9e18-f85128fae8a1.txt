Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a plane wave incident on a copper sheet, and I need to find the average power absorbed per square meter. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when electromagnetic waves hit a conductor, some of the energy is reflected and some is absorbed. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas.

Alright, the problem states it's a 1-GHz wave in air with a peak electric field of 1 V/m. The wave is normally incident on a large copper sheet. I think the key here is to find the power absorbed, which probably relates to the skin depth or the conductivity of copper.

Wait, copper is a good conductor, so the wave should penetrate very little. The skin depth formula comes into play. Skin depth δ is the depth at which the electric field drops by 1/e. The formula is δ = sqrt(1/(π*f*μ*σ)), where f is frequency, μ is permeability, and σ is conductivity.

But wait, I might need to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients. Oh, right, for a perfect conductor, the reflection coefficient is 1, meaning all the wave is reflected. But if it's a real conductor like copper, some of the wave is absorbed.

Wait, no, when a wave hits a conductor, the electric and magnetic fields inside are such that the wave is evanescent, decaying exponentially. The power absorbed is due to the currents induced in the conductor, which causes ohmic losses.

The average power absorbed per unit area should be the power of the wave that's transmitted into the conductor, minus what's reflected. But wait, since it's a conductor, maybe the reflection is high, but the transmitted part is what gets absorbed.

Wait, the Poynting vector represents the power flow. The incident wave's Poynting vector gives the power density. For a plane wave in air, the average Poynting vector is (E^2)/(2*η), where η is the impedance of free space, about 377 ohms.

So the incident power per square meter is S_inc = (E^2)/(2η). With E peak at 1 V/m, that's E_rms = 1/sqrt(2) V/m. So the average power is ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 ) / (2*377) ) = (1/2)/(754) )= 1/(1508) ≈ 6.63e-4 W/m². Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

But wait, copper's conductivity is high, so maybe the reflection is almost perfect. Oh, wait, the reflection coefficient for a wave going from air to a conductor is (η2 - η1)/(η2 + η1). But for a conductor, the intrinsic impedance η2 is much smaller than η1 (air's η is 377 ohms). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (η2 - η1)/(η2 + η1). If η2 is much less than η1, then (η2-η1) is negative, and magnitude is (η1 - η2) / (η1 + η2). If η2 is very small, then it's ( -η1 ) / (2η1 ), so reflection coefficient is about -0.5. So the reflected power is |reflection coefficient|^2 times the incident power. So |Γ|^2 is 0.25, so 25% of the power is reflected, meaning 75% is transmitted into the conductor. Wait, but wait, no, because for a conductor, the intrinsic impedance is complex and the wave is evanescent, so the transmission into the conductor is such that the power is absorbed as heat.

Wait, but the problem is about the average power absorbed by the sheet. So the incident power minus the reflected power gives the power absorbed. Because the transmitted power is entirely absorbed (assuming it's a thick conductor, which it is, being a large sheet).

So S_incident = E²/(2η₀). Since E is peak, E_rms is E_peak / sqrt(2). Wait, no, because for a sinusoidal wave, the average power is (E_rms * H_rms), where H_rms is E_rms / η₀. So S_avg = (E_rms)^2 / η₀.

Wait, the peak electric field is 1 V/m. So E_rms = 1 / sqrt(2) ≈ 0.707 V/m.

So S_incident = (0.707)^2 / 377 = (0.5)/377 ≈ 0.001326 W/m², which is about 1.326e-3 W/m².

But wait, then what's the reflection? The reflection coefficient Γ is (η2 - η0)/(η2 + η0). Now, η2 for copper. Copper has a high conductivity, so its intrinsic impedance is approximately η = sqrt(ωμ/σ). Since copper is non-magnetic, μ ≈ μ₀.

So f is 1 GHz. Let me compute ω = 2πf = 2π*1e9 ≈ 6.283e9 rad/s.

The permeability μ₀ is 4πe-7 H/m.

The conductivity σ for copper is about 5.96e7 S/m, I think.

So η = sqrt( ωμ₀ / σ )

Compute the numerator: ωμ₀ = 6.283e9 * 4πe-7 ≈ 6.283e9 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 7.902e4 (since 6.28e9 *1e-6 is 6.28e3, times 1.2566 gives about 7.9e3. Wait, wait, 6.283e9 *4πe-7 = 6.283e9 * 1.2566e-6 = 6.283e3 * 1.2566 ≈ approx 7.9e3. Let me compute more accurately.

6.283e9 *4e-7 = 6.283e2 *4 = 2513.2, approximately. Then 6.283e9 * 0.2566e-6 = 6.283e3 * 0.2566 = approx 1.611e3. So total is about 2513 + 1611 = 4124. So ωμ₀ ≈ 4124.

Then η = sqrt(4124 / 5.96e7) → 4124 /5.96e7 ≈ 6.92e-5. The square root of that is about 0.00832 ohms.

So η2 ≈ 0.00832 ohms.

Now, the reflection coefficient Γ = (η2 - η0)/(η2 + η0) = (0.00832 - 377)/(0.00832 + 377) ≈ (-376.9917)/377.00832 ≈ approx -0.999978.

So the magnitude of Γ is about 0.999978. Therefore, the reflected power is |Γ|^2 ≈ 0.999956, so about 99.996% reflection.

Wait, but that means the transmitted power is (1 - |Γ|^2) ≈ 0.000044, or 0.0044% of the incident power.

Wait, but that's a very small amount. So the incident power is S_inc ≈ 0.001326 W/m². The transmitted power is S_transmitted = S_inc * (1 - |Γ|^2 ) ≈ 0.001326 * 0.000044 ≈ 5.84e-8 W/m².

But wait, that's the power transmitted into the conductor. Since the conductor is thick, all of this is absorbed, right? So the average power absorbed per square meter is approximately 5.84e-8 W/m², which is 58.4 pico W/m². But wait, that seems really low. But looking at the answer options given, they are all in the 40nW to 200nW range. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Another approach: the power absorbed by a conductor when an electromagnetic wave is incident is given by the surface resistance. The surface resistance R_s is given by the real part of the intrinsic impedance η. Since for a conductor, at high frequencies, η is approximately R_s = (1/σ) * sqrt(ωμ/σ). Wait, no, the surface resistance R_s is equal to η times the real part, but for good conductors, η is approximately R_s = sqrt(ωμ/(2σ)).

Wait, let me double-check. The surface resistance R_s is given by R_s = (1/σ) * sqrt( (ωμ)/(2) ) ). Or wait, another formula: R_s = η / (2 * sqrt(ωμσ)) )? Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the skin depth approach.

The skin depth δ is sqrt( 1/(π f μ σ) ). Let me calculate that.

Given f=1 GHz, μ=μ0=4πe-7 H/m, σ=5.96e7 S/m.

Compute denominator: π *1e9 *4πe-7 *5.96e7.

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step.

π *1e9 = 3.1416e9.

3.1416e9 *4πe-7 = 3.1416e9 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ (3.1416 * 1.2566) * 1e3 ≈ 3.948 * 1e3 ≈ 3948.

Then 3948 * 5.96e7 = 3948 *5.96e7 = let's see, 3948 *5.96 = approx 3948 *6=23,688, minus 3948 *0.04=157.92 → ~23,688 - 158 = 23,530. So 23,530e7 → 2.353e12.

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is pi * f * mu * sigma.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate:

pi = 3.1416,

f=1e9 Hz,

mu=4pi*1e-7,

sigma=5.96e7.

So denominator = pi * f * mu * sigma = 3.1416 * 1e9 * (4 *3.1416e-7) *5.96e7.

Let me compute each part:

Compute mu * sigma: (4pi*1e-7) *5.96e7 =4pi*(1e-7 *5.96e7) =4pi*(5.96) ≈4 *3.1416 *5.96 ≈ 12.5664 *5.96 ≈ 74.8.

Then, pi * f: 3.1416 *1e9 =3.1416e9.

Multiply by the mu*sigma result: 3.1416e9 *74.8 ≈ 3.1416e9 *7.48e1 = 3.1416 *7.48e10 ≈ approx 23.5e10, so 2.35e11.

Wait, so denominator is 2.35e11, so skin depth delta is 1/sqrt(denominator) = 1/sqrt(2.35e11) → sqrt(2.35e11) is approx 4.85e5. So 1/4.85e5 ≈ 2.06e-6 meters, which is about 2 microns.

Now, the skin depth is very thin, so the wave doesn't penetrate much.

The power loss in the conductor is due to the current induced in the skin depth. The average power dissipated per unit area is given by (J * E_avg), but J is sigma * E_avg.

Wait, the time-average power dissipated per unit volume is J · E, which is sigma * |E|^2. But since the field decays exponentially, the dissipated power per unit area is the integral from 0 to delta of sigma E^2 dz.

Wait, but E in the conductor is E = E0 e^{-z/delta}.

So the power per unit area P_avg is (sigma * E0^2 / 2) * delta / 2. Because the average of E^2 is E0^2 /2, and the integral over z from 0 to infinity is (sigma E0^2 / 2) * (delta/2).

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. The instantaneous Poynting vector in the conductor would be E × H. But for a conductor, H is related to E through the intrinsic impedance.

Alternatively, the average power dissipated per unit area is (1/2) Re( E0 × H0^* ). But H0 is E0 / η. So the average power is (1/2) * |E0|^2 * Re(1/η^* ).

Wait, η for a conductor has both real and imaginary parts. But at high frequencies, η is dominated by the real part, which is small.

Wait, for a good conductor, η ≈ R_s, which is real. So Re(1/η) = 1/R_s.

So P_avg = (1/2) * E0^2 * (1/R_s).

Wait, but E0 here is the peak electric field in the conductor. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the incident electric field is E_inc, and the transmitted field is E_trans = E_inc * (2 η2)/(η1 + η2).

Wait, because for normal incidence from medium 1 to medium 2, the transmission coefficient is T = (2 η2)/(η1 + η2). Since η2 is very small, T ≈ 2 η2 / η1.

So E_trans ≈ (2 η2 / η1) * E_inc.

But E_inc is the peak value of 1 V/m, so E_trans_peak ≈ (2 * 0.00832) / 377 * 1 V/m ≈ (0.01664)/377 ≈ 4.415e-5 V/m.

Then, the average power dissipated would be (1/2) * (E_trans_rms)^2 / R_s.

E_trans_rms = E_trans_peak / sqrt(2) ≈ 4.415e-5 / 1.414 ≈ 3.12e-5 V/m.

So P_avg = (1/2) * (3.12e-5)^2 / R_s.

Wait, but R_s is the surface resistance, which is equal to η2. So R_s = η2 ≈ 0.00832 ohms.

So P_avg = 0.5 * ( (3.12e-5)^2 ) / 0.00832.

Compute numerator: (3.12e-5)^2 ≈ 9.73e-10.

Multiply by 0.5: 4.865e-10.

Divide by 0.00832: 4.865e-10 / 8.32e-3 ≈ 5.846e-8 W/m².

Again, I get approximately 5.85e-8 W/m², which is 58.5 picoWatts per square meter. But looking at the options, they are all in nanoWatts. So 58.5 pW is 0.0585 nW. But the options are 40n, 45n, etc. Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the wave impedance and the reflection differently. Another approach: the power absorbed is the incident power minus the reflected power. So S_absorbed = S_inc (1 - |Γ|^2).

Compute S_inc: E is 1 V/m (peak), so E_rms = 1/sqrt(2) ≈ 0.707 V/m.

S_inc = (E_rms)^2 / η0 = (0.707)^2 / 377 ≈ 0.5 / 377 ≈ 0.001326 W/m².

Now, compute |Γ|^2. Earlier, I found Γ ≈ -0.999978, so |Γ|^2 ≈ (0.999978)^2 ≈ 0.999956. So 1 - |Γ|^2 ≈ 0.000044.

So S_absorbed ≈ 0.001326 * 0.000044 ≈ 5.84e-8 W/m², as before.

This is 58.4 pW/m², which is 0.0584 nW/m². But none of the options are this low. The closest is option H at 45nW, but that's much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reflection coefficient. Let me recalculate Γ.

Γ = (η2 - η1)/(η2 + η1).

η1 is η0, 377 ohms.

η2 for copper is sqrt( (jωμ)/(σ + jωε) ). But for copper, ε is that of free space, but at high frequencies, the term jωε is negligible compared to σ. So η2 ≈ sqrt( (jωμ)/σ ). Since jωμ/σ is a purely imaginary number, the square root is also imaginary. So η2 = sqrt(ωμ/(σ)) * (1 + j)/sqrt(2) ), but wait, no, because (jωμ)/(σ) is j*(ωμ/σ), so sqrt(j) is (1 + j)/sqrt(2). So η2 has a real and imaginary part.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should compute η2 correctly.

The intrinsic impedance of a conductor is given by η = sqrt( (jωμ)/(σ + jωε) ). At high frequencies, σ >> ωε, so this simplifies to η ≈ sqrt( jωμ / σ ). So jωμ/σ = j*(ωμ/σ). The square root of j is (1 + j)/sqrt(2), so η ≈ sqrt(ωμ/σ) * (1 + j)/sqrt(2).

So η has a real part and an imaginary part. But when calculating the reflection coefficient Γ, which is (η2 - η1)/(η2 + η1), if η2 is complex, the calculation becomes more involved.

But for copper at 1 GHz, the conductivity is so high that the imaginary part is negligible, and η2 is approximately real and small. So perhaps I can approximate η2 as real, R_s = sqrt(ωμ/(2σ)).

Wait, I think I need to correct my earlier calculation of η2. Let me re-do it correctly.

η = sqrt( (jωμ) / (σ + jωε) )

But since σ >> ωε, we can ignore the jωε term. So,

η ≈ sqrt( j ω μ / σ )

= sqrt( j
