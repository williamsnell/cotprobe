Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about fluid dynamics, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that diethylaniline is flowing through a horizontal smooth pipe. The given parameters are the density (rho) as 0.935 g/cm³, viscosity (mu) as 1.95 centipoise, and the volumetric flow rate is 66 liters per minute. The pipe has an inside diameter of 3 cm, and I need to find the pressure gradient in mm of Hg per cm length.

Hmm, okay. I remember that pressure gradient in pipe flow is related to the flow rate, viscosity, and pipe dimensions. The formula I think I should use is the one from Poiseuille's Law because the pipe is smooth and horizontal, so it's probably laminar flow.

Wait, right, Poiseuille's Law is for laminar flow, and it's given by the equation (dp/dx) = (8 * mu * Q) / (pi * r^4). Or wait, maybe another version. Let me think. Oh right, sometimes it's written in terms of diameter, so maybe I should use diameter instead of radius.

Wait, radius is half the diameter. So if the diameter is D, the radius r is D/2. So substituting that into the equation, the denominator becomes (pi*(D/2)^4) which is pi D^4 / 16. So then the equation becomes (dp/dx) = (8 mu Q * 16) ) / (pi D^4) ), which simplifies to (128 mu Q) / (pi D^4). Or wait, maybe I've messed up the substitution.

Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as (dp/dx) = (32 mu Q) / (pi D^4) * something. Wait no, let's get it right.

Wait, let me recall: Poiseuille's law is usually written as the flow rate Q = (pi r^4 ΔP) / (8 mu L), where ΔP is the pressure drop over a length L. So rearranging that, the pressure gradient dp/dx (which is ΔP / L) would be (dp/dx) = (8 mu Q) / (pi r^4).

But since r = D/2, substituting that in gives (8 mu Q) / (pi (D/2)^4) ) = (8 mu Q) / (pi D^4 / 16) ) = (8 * 16 mu Q) / (pi D^4) ) = 128 mu Q / (pi D^4). So the pressure gradient is (128 mu Q) divided by (pi times D^4).

Wait, but wait, the units might matter here. Let me check the units of each variable. The flow rate Q is given in liters per minute, which I'll need to convert into cm³ per second because the other units are in cgs units.

So first, let me convert the flow rate. 66 liters per minute. Since 1 liter is 1000 cm³, 66 liters is 66,000 cm³. Per minute, so to get per second, divide by 60. So 66,000 / 60 = 1100 cm³/s. So Q = 1100 cm³/s.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 66 liters is 66 * 1000 = 66,000 cm³ per minute. One minute is 60 seconds, so 66,000 / 60 = 1100 cm³/s. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, the diameter D is 3 cm, so D = 3 cm. The viscosity mu is given as 1.95 centipoise. Wait, centipoise is the same as 0.01 poise, and 1 poise is 1 dyne·s/cm². So 1.95 centipoise is 0.0195 poise, or 0.0195 dyne·s/cm². But I think in the formula, we can keep it in poise, but need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, but in the formula, mu is in poise (dyne·s/cm²), Q is in cm³/s, D in cm. So let me plug the numbers into the formula.

So, dp/dx = (128 * mu * Q) / (pi * D^4).

Let me plug in the numbers:

mu = 1.95 centipoise = 0.0195 poise? Wait no, wait. Wait, 1 centipoise is 0.01 poise. So 1.95 centipoise = 0.0195 poise. But wait, in some contexts, centipoise is the standard unit, so perhaps the formula uses centipoise directly. Wait, let me think again about the units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert everything into cgs units.

Let me list the variables in cgs:

mu = 1.95 centipoise = 1.95 * 0.01 poise = 0.0195 poise.

But 1 poise is 1 dyne·s/cm², so 0.0195 poise is 0.0195 dyne·s/cm².

Q = 1100 cm³/s.

D = 3 cm.

So putting it all into the formula:

dp/dx = (128 * mu * Q) / (pi * D^4).

Plugging in the numbers:

128 * 0.0195 dyne·s/cm² * 1100 cm³/s divided by (pi * (3 cm)^4).

Let's compute numerator and denominator step by step.

First, 128 * 0.0195 = ?

128 * 0.02 = 2.56, but since it's 0.0195, it's 0.0005 less than 0.02. So 128 * 0.0195 = 128*(0.02 - 0.0005) = (128 * 0.02) - (128 * 0.0005) ) = 2.56 - 0.064 = 2.496.

Wait, 128 * 0.0195 = let's compute manually:

0.0195 = 195e-4.

128 * 195e-4 = (128 * 195) * 1e-4.

128 * 195: let's compute 128 * 200 = 25600. Then subtract 128 *5 = 640. So 25600 - 640 = 24960.

So 24960 * 1e-4 = 2.496.

So 128 * 0.0195 = 2.496.

Now multiply by Q, which is 1100 cm³/s:

2.496 * 1100 = let's compute 2 * 1100 = 2200, 0.496 * 1100 = 545.6. So total is 2200 + 545.6 = 2745.6.

So numerator is 2745.6 (dyne·s/cm² * cm³/s) = dyne/cm² per cm, because s cancels, cm³ is cm²·cm, so dyne·s/cm² * cm³/s = (dyne·cm)/cm² * 1/s * s → dyne/cm²·cm. Wait, not sure, but let's proceed.

Denominator: pi * D^4 = pi * (3 cm)^4 = pi * 81 cm^4 = 81 pi cm^4.

So now, dp/dx = 2745.6 / (81 pi) in units of dyne/cm² per cm.

Let me compute 2745.6 / (81 pi):

First compute 2745.6 /81 ≈ 33.913. Then divide by pi ≈ 3.1416.

33.913 / 3.1416 ≈ 10.79.

So dp/dx ≈ 10.79 dyne/cm² per cm.

Wait, but wait, 10.79 dyne/cm² per cm is the pressure gradient. Now, the question asks for the pressure gradient in mm of Hg per cm length.

So I need to convert dyne/cm² per cm into mm Hg per cm.

I remember that 1 atm is 760 mm Hg, and 1 atm is approximately 1.01325e6 dyne/cm².

So first, let's find how much 1 mm Hg is in dyne/cm².

Since 760 mm Hg = 1 atm = 1.01325e6 dyne/cm², so 1 mm Hg = (1.01325e6) / 760 ≈ 1333.22 dyne/cm².

So 1 dyne/cm² = 1 / 1333.22 mm Hg ≈ 0.00075006 mm Hg.

So now, our pressure gradient is 10.79 dyne/cm² per cm. So in terms of mm Hg per cm:

10.79 dyne/cm²/cm * (0.00075006 mm Hg / dyne/cm²) ) = ?

Let me compute 10.79 * 0.00075006.

10 * 0.00075006 is 0.0075006.

0.79 * 0.00075006 ≈ approx 0.0005925.

Adding them: 0.0075006 + 0.0005925 ≈ 0.0080931 mm Hg/cm.

So approximately 0.008093 mm Hg per cm.

Looking at the options:

Option E is 0.071 mm Hg/cm, which is much bigger. Option B is 0.055, no. Option C is 0.048. Option J is 0.062. Hmm, wait, wait. Did I do something wrong? Because my calculation is suggesting about 0.00809, but none of the options are that low.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for pressure gradient in pipe flow: is it (dp/dx) = (8 mu Q) / (pi r^4) ), which is correct for laminar flow.

Wait, but wait, let's re-express the formula correctly.

Alternatively, another form is (dp/dx) = (32 mu Q) / (pi D^4) * (1/2) or something? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which states that the flow rate Q is equal to (pi DeltaP D^4) / (128 mu L), where DeltaP is the pressure drop over length L.

So rearranging, DeltaP / L = (128 mu Q) / (pi D^4).

Yes, that's the same as what I had before.

So the pressure gradient is (128 mu Q) / (pi D^4).

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

mu = 1.95 centipoise = 0.0195 poise.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, 1 centipoise is 0.01 poise, so yes, 1.95 centipoise is 0.0195 poise.

But wait, let me make sure about the units. Because 1 poise is 1 dyne·s/cm², so 0.0195 poise is 0.0195 dyne·s/cm².

So, mu = 0.0195 dyne·s/cm².

Q = 1100 cm³/s.

Diameter D = 3 cm.

So plugging into (128 * mu * Q) / (pi * D^4):

128 * 0.0195 = 2.496.

2.496 * 1100 = 2745.6.

Denominator: pi * 3^4 = pi *81 = 254.469 (since pi is approximately 3.1416, 3.1416 *81 = 254.469).

So 2745.6 / 254.469 ≈ 10.79 dyne/cm² per cm.

Wait, but let me compute 2745.6 /254.469 accurately.

Let me compute 254.469 * 10 = 2544.69.

So 2745.6 -2544.69 = 200.91.

So 200.91 / 254.469 ≈ 0.79.

So total is 10.79, as before.

So 10.79 dyne/cm² per cm.

Now, to convert dyne/cm² to mm Hg.

As 1 mm Hg = 1333.22 dyne/cm², so 1 dyne/cm² is 1/1333.22 mm Hg ≈ 0.00075006 mm Hg.

So 10.79 dyne/cm²/cm → 10.79 * 0.00075006 ≈ 0.008093 mm Hg/cm.

But none of the options are close to 0.008. Wait, the options start at 0.048 and go up. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the flow rate. Let me check again.

The flow rate is given as 66 liters per minute. 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 66 liters is 66,000 cm³. Per minute, so per second is 66,000 /60 = 1100 cm³/s. That seems correct.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula uses Q in terms of m^3/s and other SI units, but I used cgs units. Let me try converting everything to SI units and see.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pressure gradient. Let me try to recompute.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula (dp/dx) = (8 mu Q) / (pi r^4 ), using r instead of D. Let me try that.

r = D/2 = 1.5 cm.

So, (8 * mu * Q) / (pi * (1.5)^4 )

So 8 * 0.0195 = 0.156.

0.156 * 1100 = 171.6.

Denominator: pi * (1.5)^4.

1.5^4 = (3/2)^4 = 81/16 = 5.0625.

So denominator = pi * 5.0625 ≈ 15.905.

So 171.6 / 15.905 ≈ 10.79, same as before. So same result.

So the pressure gradient is about 0.008093 mm Hg/cm. But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, let me recheck the conversion from dyne/cm² to mm Hg.

1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 1.01325e6 dyne/cm². So 1 mm Hg = 1.01325e6 /760 = approx 1333.22 dyne/cm².

So 1 dyne/cm² = 1 /1333.22 mm Hg = approx 0.00075006 mm Hg.

So 10.79 dyne/cm² is 10.79 * 0.00075006 ≈ 0.008093 mm Hg per cm.

But, wait, the options are in the range of 0.048 to 0.133. So I'm off by a factor of about 6.

Hmm, where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the flow rate. Let me double-check.

Wait, 66 liters per minute to cm³/s.

66 L/min = 66 * 1000 cm³/min = 66,000 cm³/min.

Divide by 60 to get per second: 66,000 /60 = 1100 cm³/s. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the pipe is horizontal? No, the formula applies regardless as it's about pressure gradient due to viscosity, not gravity.

Hmm, maybe I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the flow is turbulent, but the pipe is smooth, and with these parameters, maybe the flow is laminar. Let me check the Reynolds number to see.

Reynolds number Re = (rho * v * D) / mu.

But wait, to find Re, I need the velocity v.

v = Q / (pi r²) = Q / (pi (D/2)^2 ) = (4 Q) / (pi D²).

So Q is 1100 cm³/s, D=3 cm.

v = (4 * 1100) / (pi * 9) ) = 4400 / (28.274) ≈ 4400 / 28.274 ≈ 155.5 cm/s.

So Re = (rho * v * D) / mu.

rho is 0.935 g/cm³ → 0.935 g/cm³ = 935 kg/m³? Wait, no, 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³. So 0.935 g/cm³ = 935 kg/m³.

Wait, no, wait. 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³ because 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³, and 1 g is 0.001 kg. So 1 g/cm³ = 1e3 kg/m³.

So 0.935 g/cm³ = 935 kg/m³.

Wait, but wait, in cgs units, rho is in g/cm³, mu is in poise (dyne·s/cm²), D in cm, v in cm/s.

So the Reynolds number formula in cgs units is Re = (rho * v * D) / mu.

So rho = 0.935 g/cm³.

v = 155.5 cm/s.

D = 3 cm.

mu = 0.0195 dyne·s/cm².

So Re = (0.935 * 155.5 * 3) / 0.0195.

Compute numerator: 0.935 * 155.5 ≈ let's compute 0.935 * 150 = 140.25, 0.935 * 5.5 = 5.1425, so total ≈ 140.25 +5.1425 = 145.3925.

Multiply by 3: 145.3925 *3 ≈ 436.1775.

Denominator: 0.0195.

So Re ≈ 436.1775 / 0.0195 ≈ let's compute 436.1775 / 0.02 ≈ 21800, but since it's 0.0195, slightly less. Let's compute:

0.0195 = 0.02 * 0.975.

So 436.177
