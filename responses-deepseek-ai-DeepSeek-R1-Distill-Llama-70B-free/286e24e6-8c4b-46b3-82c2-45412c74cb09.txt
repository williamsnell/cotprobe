Question:

If tickets to a baseball game generally cost between $10 and $30, a season has about 150 games, and each game is attended by 50,000-75,000 people, which of the following is a good estimate for ticket sales revenue for the 150 games combined?

Options:

A: $1,000,000,000
B: $20,000,000
C: $10,000,000,000
D: $200,000,000
E: $2,000,000
F: $500,000,000
G: $100,000,000
H: $20,000,000,000
I: $2,000,000,000
J: $30,000,000,000

Okay, so I have this problem here about estimating ticket sales revenue for a baseball season. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that each ticket costs between $10 and $30. Hmm, I think I should take the average of these two to make an estimate. So, $10 plus $30 is $40, divided by 2 gives $20 per ticket on average. That seems reasonable.

Next, the season has about 150 games. Each game is attended by 50,000 to 75,000 people. Again, I think I should average these numbers to get an approximate attendance per game. 50k plus 75k is 125k, divided by 2 gives 62,500 people per game. Okay, so average attendance is 62,500.

Now, to find the total revenue, I need to multiply the average ticket price by the average attendance per game, and then multiply by the number of games. Let me write that out:

Revenue per game = average ticket price * average attendance
Revenue per game = $20 * 62,500

Wait, let me calculate that. 20 times 60,000 is 1,200,000, and 20 times 2,500 is 50,000, so total is 1,250,000 per game. Or maybe I should just do 20 * 62,500 directly. 62,500 times 20 is indeed 1,250,000. So each game brings in $1.25 million.

Now, for 150 games, the total would be 1.25 million multiplied by 150. Let me compute that. 1 million times 150 is 150 million, and 0.25 million times 150 is 37.5 million. So total is 150 + 37.5 = 187.5 million. Hmm, that's $187,500,000.

Looking at the options, option D is $200 million, which is close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations in case I missed something.

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of averaging, I should use the midpoints. Oh wait, I did that already. Alternatively, perhaps using the lower and upper bounds to find a range.

Let me see: lower bound would be $10 per ticket and 50k attendance. So per game: 10*50k = $500,000. For 150 games, that's 500k *150= $75,000,000.

Upper bound would be $30 per ticket and 75k attendance. So per game: 30*75k= $2,250,000. For 150 games, that's 2.25 million *150 = $337.5 million.

So the total revenue should be between $75 million and $337.5 million. My earlier estimate of $187.5 million falls within this range.

Looking at the options again: let's list the options numerically.

A: 1e9
B: 20e6
C: 1e10
D: 200e6
E: 2e6
F: 500e6
G:100e6
H:20e9
I:2e9
J:30e9.

Wait, my estimate was 187.5e6, which is closest to D:200e6. But let me check if perhaps I should consider another approach.

Wait, another way: Maybe the problem expects me to take the average of the lower and upper bounds for each variable. So average ticket price is $20, average attendance is 62,500. Then 20 * 62,500 = 1.25e6 per game. 1.25e6 *150 = 187.5e6, which is 187.5 million. So D is 200 million, which is the closest.

Alternatively, maybe some people might take the midpoint as 12.5 when it's actually 62.5k. Wait, no, 50k to 75k is 125k total, divided by 2 is 62.5k.

Wait, another thought: Is the average ticket price correctly calculated? Well, it's between $10 and $30. If tickets are sold at varying prices, but the average is $20. That's correct.

So I think my initial calculation is right, and the closest option is D: $200 million.

To estimate the ticket sales revenue for the 150-game season, we start by calculating the average ticket price and average attendance per game:

1. **Average Ticket Price**:  
   The ticket price ranges from $10 to $30. Taking the midpoint:  
   \[
   \text{Average Ticket Price} = \frac{10 + 30}{2} = 20 \, \text{dollars}.
   \]

2. **Average Attendance Per Game**:  
   Attendance ranges from 50,000 to 75,000. Taking the midpoint:  
   \[
   \text{Average Attendance} = \frac{50,000 + 75,000}{2} = 62,500 \, \text{people}.
   \]

3. **Revenue Per Game**:  
   Multiply the average ticket price by the average attendance:  
   \[
   \text{Revenue Per Game} = 20 \times 62,500 = 1,250,000 \, \text{dollars}.
   \]

4. **Total Revenue for the Season**:  
   Multiply the revenue per game by the number of games (150):  
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 1,250,000 \times 150 = 187,500,000 \, \text{dollars}.
   \]

Thus, the estimated total revenue for the season is approximately **$187.5 million**. Comparing this to the given options, the closest value is **$200 million**.

**Critical Analysis of Options**:  
- **A ($1,000,000,000)** and **C ($10,000,000,000)** are far too high.  
- **E ($2,000,000)**, **B ($20,000,000)**, and **G ($100,000,000)** are far too low.  
- **H ($20,000,000,000)** and **J ($30,000,000,000)** are unrealistic for a single season.  
- **F ($500,000,000)** and **I ($2,000,000,000)** are also too high compared to the estimate.  
- **D ($200,000,000)** is the closest to the calculated value of $187.5 million.

**Final Answer**:  
\boxed{D}
