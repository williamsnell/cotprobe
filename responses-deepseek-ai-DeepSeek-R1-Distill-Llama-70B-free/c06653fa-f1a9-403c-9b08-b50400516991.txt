Okay, so I have this question about the first commercial radio station and where it was located. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right city. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that radio history started in the early 20th century. I think the first commercial stations were in the US. Let me recall some key points. I remember something about KDKA being a significant station. Wait, KDKA is in Pittsburgh, right? Because I've heard that it was the first commercial radio station, licensed in 1920. 

So, the options given are: A: New York, B: Cleveland, C: Austin, D: San Francisco, E: Los Angeles, F: Dallas, G: Miami, H: Boston, I: Chicago, J: Pittsburgh. So J is Pittsburgh. That must be the answer.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing things up. Was there another city that claims the first radio station? I think sometimes people mention Detroit or other cities, but I'm pretty sure KDKA in Pittsburgh was the first with a commercial license. It was owned by Westinghouse, and it started broadcasting in 1920, I believe.

So yeah, the answer should be J: Pittsburgh.

The first commercial radio station was KDKA in Pittsburgh, which began broadcasting in 1920.
