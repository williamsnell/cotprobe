Question:

While undergoing a routine plastic surgery procedure, a patient died on the operating table. The patient's husband is suing the plastic surgeon alleging malpractice. Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met the highest standards for medical care. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death. The witness stated that "the expert told me the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. "On objection to this testimony, defendant's attorney seeks a ruling on the admissibility of this question and answer. The trial judge should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.
B: sustain the objection, because the testimony is hearsay.
C: sustain the objection, because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.
D: overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.
E: overrule the objection, because the statement supports the expert witness's credibility.
F: sustain the objection, because the statement is speculation and not based on factual evidence.
G: sustain the objection, because the statement is prejudicial and may unfairly influence the jury.
H: overrule the objection, because the statement was made immediately after the incident, making it a present sense impression and therefore not hearsay.
I: sustain the objection, because the witness's statement is unrelated to the case at hand.
J: overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is an exception to the hearsay rule as it was made in the course of his professional duty.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The situation is a trial where a patient died during plastic surgery, and the husband is suing for malpractice. The defense called an expert witness who testified that the surgeon met the highest standards and the death was a freak accident. Then, on cross-examination, it came out that the expert and the surgeon are about to become business partners, which suggests a potential bias. 

Now, the defendant calls another surgeon who testifies about a conversation he had with the expert right after the patient's death. The witness says the expert told him it was a textbook freak accident and nothing could've been done. The plaintiff objects to this testimony, and the judge has to decide if it's admissible.

The question is about the admissibility of this statement. So, the key issue here is whether this testimony is hearsay or falls under any exception.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the expert's prior statement to the other surgeon is being offered to show that the death was indeed a freak accident, which is the truth of the matter. That makes it hearsay on its face.

But wait, the defendant's attorney is offering this to rebut the implication that the expert's testimony was biased because of the upcoming partnership. They might be trying to show that the expert's opinion was consistent before any potential bias arose. So, maybe it's about prior consistent statements.

I recall that prior consistent statements can be used to rehabilitate a witness's credibility if the witness was impeached. But there's a rule about this. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior consistent statement can be used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication, but it's still hearsay unless it falls under an exception.

Wait, so if the expert's credibility was attacked by suggesting bias (because of the partnership), the defense could offer a prior consistent statement to show the expert's opinion was consistent before any possible bias. But is that allowed?

I think the rule is that prior consistent statements are not admissible as substantive evidence unless they fall under a hearsay exception. However, they can be used for rehabilitation purposes, but only if they're not being offered for the truth. Wait, no—actually, under FRE 801(d)(1)(B), a prior consistent statement is not hearsay if it's offered to rebut a charge that the witness is biased or has an improper motive. So, it's an exception.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. FRE 801(d)(1)(B) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's a prior statement that is consistent with the witness's testimony and is offered to rebut a charge of bias or motive to lie. So, in this case, the expert's prior statement to the other surgeon, made before the partnership was agreed upon, could be admissible under this rule to show that the expert's testimony wasn't motivated by the desire to protect his future partner.

So, the defense is offering the prior statement to show that the expert's opinion was consistent before any potential bias arose. Therefore, it's admissible under FRE 801(d)(1)(B) as a prior consistent statement to rebut the charge of bias, and thus it's not hearsay.

Wait, but wait another thing. The prior statement was made a week before the trial, right? No, wait, the conversation happened immediately after the patient's death, which was two years before the trial. Oh, no, the expert and surgeon signed the partnership agreement one week before the trial. So the prior statement was made two years ago, before any potential bias existed. So, the expert's prior statement supports that his opinion was genuine, not influenced by the upcoming partnership.

So, the statement is being offered to show that the expert's testimony wasn't biased, which means it's a prior consistent statement used to rebut the charge of bias. Therefore, it's admissible under 801(d)(1)(B), which means it's not hearsay. So the objection should be overruled.

Looking at the options, option H says the statement is a present sense impression and not hearsay. Wait, but present sense impression is under FRE 803(1), which requires the statement to be made while perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. Here, the statement was made immediately after the patient's death, so maybe it qualifies. But the primary issue is whether it's being used for the truth or just for credibility.

Alternatively, option A says the objection is overruled because veracity can be rehabilitated with a prior consistent statement. But under the rules, prior consistent statements can be used for rehabilitation but only if they meet the criteria. So, if it's allowed under 801(d)(1)(B), then it's admissible.

Wait, but the options are about whether the judge should overrule or sustain the objection. If the statement is admissible under 801(d)(1)(B), then the objection should be overruled. So which option corresponds to that?

Looking at the options:

Option A: overrule, prior consistent statement for rehabilitation.

Option H: overrule, present sense impression.

Option J: overrule, exception as professional duty.

Option E: overrule, supports credibility.

Wait, FRE 801(d)(1)(B) makes the statement admissible as non-hearsay when it's a prior consistent statement offered to rebut bias. So, the statement is not hearsay, so the objection (which I assume is on hearsay grounds) would be overruled.

So the correct ruling is to overrule the objection because the statement is not hearsay under 801(d)(1)(B). But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Let's check each option.

Option A: overrule because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement. That's correct in general, but the statement is admissible substantively under the exception, not just for credibility. But I think the option is correct in the result, even if the reasoning is a bit off.

Option H: overrule because it's a present sense impression. That's another possibility. The statement was made immediately after the incident, so it could qualify as a present sense impression under 803(1), which is a hearsay exception. So the statement would be admissible as an exception, making it non-hearsay.

So, which applies here? The defense is offering the statement to prove the truth—that the death was an accident. So if it's a present sense impression, it's admissible. Alternatively, if it's a prior consistent statement under 801(d)(1)(B), it's also admissible.

Wait, but the statement's purpose is to show that the expert's opinion was consistent before any potential bias, so it's more about credibility and rebutting the bias charge. So perhaps the better fit is 801(d)(1)(B), making it non-hearsay.

But looking at the options, H says it's a present sense impression, so overruled. A says prior consistent statement for rehabilitation. Both are correct, but which applies?

Wait, the prior statement was made two years ago, immediately after the death. So, it's a statement describing an event made while perceiving it or immediately thereafter. So it's a present sense impression, which is an exception under 803(1). Therefore, it's not hearsay, so the objection (on hearsay grounds) would be overruled. So option H would be correct.

But wait, the expert's statement to the other surgeon was about his opinion regarding the accident. Was it made while perceiving the event or immediately after? The expert wasn't present at the surgery, I think. Because the expert is testifying, and the other surgeon had a conversation with him after the patient's death. So perhaps the expert wasn't a percipient witness to the surgery. Therefore, the statement might not qualify as a present sense impression.

Alternatively, the expert could have been involved in the case, but the question doesn't specify. So maybe the present sense impression doesn't apply here.

If that's the case, then the statement would be hearsay unless it falls under another exception. But the other exception would be 801(d)(1)(B), prior consistent statement to rebut bias.

So, the statement is being offered to show that the expert's testimony wasn't biased because he had the same opinion before the partnership. Therefore, it's a prior consistent statement admissible under 801(d)(1)(B), making it non-hearsay. Thus, the objection should be overruled.

Looking back at the options, option A says overrule because prior consistent statement for veracity. That's correct. But option H is about present sense impression. If the statement doesn't qualify under that, then A is the better choice.

Wait, but the expert's prior statement was made immediately after the patient's death. If the expert was part of the treatment or involved in reviewing the case, it's possible that the statement was made in the course of medical review. But without that context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, the key is that the prior statement was consistent and used to rebut bias, so 801(d)(1)(B) applies. Therefore, the answer would be A: overrule because prior consistent statement to rehabilitate.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option H could also be correct if it's a present sense impression. But I think the more applicable rule here is 801(d)(1)(B). So the answer is A.

Wait no, let me clarify. FRE 801(d)(1)(B) says that a prior consistent statement is not hearsay if it's offered to rebut a charge of bias or motive. So in this case, the defense is offering it to show that the expert's opinion was the same before he had a motive to lie (before the partnership), so it's admissible under this rule. Therefore, the statement is not hearsay, so the objection is overruled.

Looking at the options, option A says this: overrule because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement. That's exactly the situation here. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another possibility is option H, which is about present sense impression. But I think that applies when the statement is made while the event is happening or immediately after. If the expert made the statement right after the patient's death, it might qualify. But the expert wasn't necessarily a participant or witness to the surgery, so maybe not.

So I'm leaning towards option A being the correct answer.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a prior statement made by an expert witness in a medical malpractice trial. The expert testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon met the highest standards of care. On cross-examination, it was revealed that the expert and the surgeon were about to become business partners, suggesting potential bias. The defense then called another surgeon who testified about a conversation with the expert immediately after the patient's death, where the expert made similar statements about the accident. The plaintiff objected to this testimony, and the court must decide its admissibility.

The key issue is whether the expert's prior statement qualifies as hearsay or falls under a hearsay exception. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the prior statement is being offered to rebut the suggestion of bias and to show that the expert's opinion was consistent before any potential bias arose due to the partnership. 

Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(1)(B), a prior consistent statement is not considered hearsay if it is offered to rebut a charge of bias or improper motive. In this case, the expert's prior statement, made two years before the trial and before the partnership was agreed upon, fits this criteria. It is being used to show that the expert's testimony was not influenced by the upcoming partnership, thereby rebutting the charge of bias. Therefore, the statement is admissible under this rule.

While the statement could also potentially qualify as a present sense impression under FRE 803(1), the more applicable rule here is FRE 801(d)(1)(B), as the primary purpose of the statement is to rebut bias. Thus, the objection should be overruled because the statement is not hearsay under this exception.

The correct answer is:

**A: overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.**

Answer: A
