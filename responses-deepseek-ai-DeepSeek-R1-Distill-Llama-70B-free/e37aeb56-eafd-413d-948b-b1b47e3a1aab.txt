Question:

A homeowner gave his friend a mortgage on his property to secure a loan from the friend to the homeowner in the amount of $100,000. The homeowner then gives an investor a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the investor to the homeowner in the amount of $80,000. The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property. In a foreclosure proceeding in which the friend, the investor, and the bank were parties, the property sold for $160,000. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. "What dollar amount, if any, should go to the friend?

Okay, so I need to figure out this mortgage foreclosure question. Let me read through the problem again and try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a homeowner who has taken out three mortgages on his property. The key here is understanding the order of events and how the recording statute affects the priorities of the mortgages.

First, the homeowner gives his friend a mortgage to secure a $100,000 loan. Then, he gives an investor a mortgage for $80,000. Next, the friend records his mortgage. After that, the homeowner gives a bank a mortgage for $50,000. Then the investor records, followed by the bank recording.

So, the order of events is:

1. Friend's mortgage (not recorded yet)
2. Investor's mortgage (not recorded yet)
3. Friend records
4. Bank's mortgage (not recorded yet)
5. Investor records
6. Bank records

Now, the homeowner defaults, and the property is sold in foreclosure for $160,000. The question is about how much the friend gets.

The recording statute here says that unless an instrument is recorded, it's void as against subsequent purchasers who paid value and had no notice. So this is a notice or race-notice type of statute, I think. Because it's void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. So, the key is determining the priority based on when each mortgage was recorded and whether subsequent mortgages were taken with or without notice.

Let me list out the mortgages with their recording dates:

- Friend: Recorded after giving the mortgage, but before the investor and bank.
- Investor: Recorded after the bank's mortgage was given but before the bank recorded.
- Bank: Recorded last.

Wait, let me think about the timing.

The order is:

1. Friend gives mortgage (unrecorded)
2. Investor gives mortgage (unrecorded)
3. Friend records
4. Bank gives mortgage (unrecorded)
5. Investor records
6. Bank records

So, when the bank took its mortgage, the friend's mortgage was already recorded. The investor's mortgage was given before the bank's, but wasn't recorded until after the bank's mortgage was given.

Hmm. So, the priorities depend on when each was recorded and whether a subsequent mortgagee had notice of prior unrecorded interests.

Under the recording statute, any instrument not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser who (1) paid value and (2) had no notice (actual or constructive).

So, let's consider each mortgage in the order they were recorded.

First, the friend records. At the time of recording, the friend's mortgage is first in time and first to record.

Next, the investor records after the bank's mortgage was given. Wait, let's see the exact timeline:

- Friend records before the bank's mortgage is given. So when the bank takes its mortgage, the friend's mortgage is already recorded. So the bank would have constructive notice of the friend's mortgage because it's recorded. But what about the investor's mortgage at that point? The investor's mortgage was given after the friend's but before the bank's. But the investor hadn't recorded yet when the bank took its mortgage.

So, when the bank took its mortgage, the friend's mortgage was recorded, so the bank is on notice of the friend's interest. The investor's mortgage, however, was not recorded at that time. So, the bank's mortgage would be junior to the friend's, but what about the investor?

Wait, the investor's mortgage was given after the friend's, but before the bank's. The investor didn't record until after the bank's mortgage was given.

So when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is already in place. But the bank's mortgage was taken without notice of the investor's mortgage because the investor hadn't recorded yet. So, the bank would have priority over the investor because the bank is a subsequent purchaser without notice when the investor's mortgage was unrecorded.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to map this out.

Let's list the mortgages in the order of recording:

1. Friend: recorded first, so has priority unless someone comes after who is a subsequent purchaser without notice.

But the problem is how the subsequent mortgages affect each other.

The rule is that a subsequent purchaser who pays value and has no notice of a prior unrecorded mortgage will have priority over that prior unrecorded mortgage.

So, when the investor gave the mortgage, it was after the friend's. But the friend then recorded before the investor did. So when the investor records, does that affect the priority?

Wait, let's think about each step.

- Friend's mortgage: created first, recorded third (after investor's creation but before investor's recording? No, wait: the order is friend records after the investor's mortgage is given but before the bank's. Then the bank's mortgage is given, then the investor records, then the bank records.

Wait, let's make a timeline:

1. Homeowner gives friend a mortgage for $100k (unrecorded).
2. Homeowner gives investor a mortgage for $80k (unrecorded).
3. Friend records the mortgage.
4. Homeowner gives bank a mortgage for $50k (unrecorded).
5. Investor records the mortgage.
6. Bank records the mortgage.

So, when the bank's mortgage was given (step 4), the friend's mortgage was already recorded (step 3). So, the bank, when taking its mortgage, would have constructive notice of the friend's mortgage because it's recorded. Therefore, the bank's mortgage is junior to the friend's.

But what about the investor's mortgage, which was given before the bank's mortgage but recorded after the bank's mortgage was given. So when the investor records (step 5), the bank's mortgage was already given but not yet recorded. So when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is still unrecorded. But does the bank's mortgage affect the investor's priority?

Hmm.

The recording statute says that an unrecorded instrument is void against a subsequent purchaser who paid value and had no notice.

So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage was unrecorded at that time. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would take priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage, right? Because the bank was a subsequent purchaser (their mortgage was given after the investor's) and they had no notice of the investor's mortgage because it wasn't recorded yet.

Wait, no. Wait, the bank's mortgage was given before the investor recorded. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage was already in existence but unrecorded. So, the investor, by recording, would take priority over the bank's mortgage because the bank's was unrecorded when the investor recorded. Because the bank would be a subsequent purchaser who had no notice (since the investor's wasn't recorded when the bank's mortgage was taken), but the investor's mortgage was unrecorded at the time the bank took their mortgage.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's think about each party's rights.

The order of recording is: Friend records first, then investor, then bank.

But the order of mortgages being given is: Friend, investor, bank.

But the friend recorded before the bank's mortgage was given, so the bank's mortgage is after the friend's and is subject to the friend's because the bank had constructive notice when they took their mortgage.

As for the investor and the bank: the investor's mortgage was given before the bank's, but the investor didn't record until after the bank's mortgage was given. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage was already in place but unrecorded. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would take priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage because the bank was a subsequent purchaser without notice of the investor's mortgage when the bank took their mortgage.

Wait, but the bank took their mortgage before the investor recorded. So, at the time the bank took their mortgage, the investor's mortgage was unrecorded. Therefore, the bank had no notice (actual or constructive) of the investor's mortgage. So, under the recording statute, the bank's mortgage, when recorded, would take priority over the investor's unrecorded mortgage. But wait, the investor then records after the bank's mortgage was given but before the bank records.

So, the order of recording is friend (1), investor (2), bank (3).

So, the priority should be based on the recording dates, but taking into account whether subsequent purchasers had notice.

Wait, another approach: in a race-notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who records first will have priority if they paid value and had no notice of prior unrecorded interests.

Wait, no, race-notice is when a subsequent purchaser without notice who records first has priority. But the exact wording here is "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice."

So, it's a notice statute. Because it's void as to subsequent purchasers without notice who paid value.

In notice jurisdictions, a subsequent purchaser who (1) pays value, (2) has no notice (actual or constructive), and (3) records first, will have priority over a prior unrecorded interest.

Wait, no. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser without notice of a prior unrecorded interest will have priority, regardless of recording order, as long as they record before the prior is recorded.

Wait, perhaps I should outline the priority of each mortgage:

1. Friend's mortgage: recorded first. So, anyone after that who didn't have notice would be subject to it.

2. Investor's mortgage: created second, recorded second.

3. Bank's mortgage: created third, recorded third.

But when the investor records (after the bank's mortgage was given), does that affect the bank's mortgage? Because when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is unrecorded. So, the investor's mortgage, now recorded, would be prior to the bank's unrecorded mortgage.

Wait, but the bank's mortgage was given before the investor recorded. So, at the time the bank took their mortgage, the investor's mortgage was unrecorded. So, the bank had no notice of the investor's mortgage. Therefore, under the recording statute, the bank's mortgage would take priority over the investor's because the bank was a subsequent purchaser without notice.

Wait, but the investor then records before the bank does. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is unrecorded. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would take priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage because the bank's mortgage is subsequent and unrecorded, but the bank had no notice of the investor's mortgage when they took theirs.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify.

The key is to determine the priority among the three mortgages after all have been recorded.

The order of recording is:

1. Friend
2. Investor
3. Bank

But the order of creation is:

1. Friend
2. Investor
3. Bank

Under a notice statute, the priority is determined by who was first in time, but if a subsequent purchaser had no notice (actual or constructive) of a prior unrecorded mortgage, they can take priority.

So, let's see each step:

- Friend creates and records first. So, from that point on, anyone who takes a mortgage after that date (whether investor or bank) would have constructive notice of the friend's mortgage because it's recorded. So, their mortgages would be junior to the friend's.

Wait, but the investor's mortgage was created before the friend recorded. Wait no, correction: the friend recorded after the investor's mortgage was created. So, the timeline is:

- Friend gives mortgage (unrecorded)
- Investor gives mortgage (unrecorded)
- Friend records (now, the friend's mortgage is recorded)
- Bank gives mortgage (unrecorded, but now, the friend's mortgage is recorded, so the bank has constructive notice of the friend's mortgage, making the bank's mortgage junior to the friend's)
- Investor records (now, the investor's mortgage is recorded)
- Bank records (bank's mortgage is recorded, but it's junior to the friend's and possibly the investor's)

Wait, but the investor's mortgage was created before the bank's. So, when the investor records, does that mean the investor's mortgage is prior to the bank's?

But the bank, when taking their mortgage, didn't have notice of the investor's mortgage because it was unrecorded at that time. So, under the recording statute, the bank's mortgage would take priority over the investor's unrecorded mortgage, because the bank was a subsequent purchaser without notice.

But then the investor records after the bank's mortgage is given but before the bank records. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is still unrecorded. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would take priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to outline each mortgage's priority:

1. Friend's mortgage: recorded first. So, it has priority over any subsequent mortgages, unless a subsequent mortgagee had no notice and recorded first.

2. Investor's mortgage: created after friend, recorded after bank's creation. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is unrecorded. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would have priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage, because the bank would be a subsequent purchaser without notice.

Wait, no. Because the bank's mortgage was created before the investor recorded. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is still unrecorded, but the bank's mortgage was created after the investor's.

So, the investor's mortgage was created before the bank's. But the investor didn't record until after the bank's mortgage was created. So, the bank, when taking their mortgage, didn't have notice of the investor's mortgage because it wasn't recorded yet. So, the bank's mortgage would take priority over the investor's, even though the investor's was created earlier, because the bank was a subsequent purchaser without notice.

But then, the investor records before the bank. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is still unrecorded. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would have priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage. Because the bank's mortgage was subsequent and unrecorded when the investor recorded.

Wait, maybe the priorities are as follows:

- Friend: first in time and first to record. So, highest priority.

- Investor: second in time, but third to record. However, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage was unrecorded, so the investor's recorded mortgage would be next.

Wait, but the bank's mortgage was taken without notice of the investor's, so the bank would have priority over the investor.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it differently.

In a notice jurisdiction, the rule is:

A subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) for value without notice of a prior unrecorded interest will take free of that interest, even if they record later.

So, let's apply that.

Friend's mortgage: recorded first. So, any BFP after that without notice of prior unrecorded interests will have priority.

Investor's mortgage: created before the bank's, but after the friend's. The investor didn't record until after the bank's mortgage was created.

When the bank took their mortgage, the friend's was already recorded, so the bank has constructive notice of the friend's mortgage. Therefore, the bank's mortgage is junior to the friend's.

But the investor's mortgage was unrecorded when the bank took their mortgage, so the bank had no notice of the investor's mortgage. Therefore, the bank's mortgage would take priority over the investor's, because the bank is a subsequent BFP without notice.

But then, the investor records before the bank. So, when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is still unrecorded. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would take priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage, because the bank's was unrecorded at the time the investor recorded.

Wait, but the bank had already taken their mortgage without notice of the investor's. So, the bank's mortgage would have priority over the investor's, even though the investor later recorded.

This is tricky. Maybe I should think about the order of priority.

The order of recording is:

1. Friend
2. Investor
3. Bank

But the order of creation is:

1. Friend
2. Investor
3. Bank

In a notice jurisdiction, the priority is determined by whether a subsequent purchaser had notice.

Friend's mortgage is first in time and first to record. So, it's valid against any subsequent purchasers with notice.

Investor's mortgage is next. When the investor took their mortgage, the friend's was unrecorded. But then the friend recorded before the investor did. So, the investor's mortgage, when recorded, would be subject to the friend's because the friend recorded first. But what about the bank?

The bank took their mortgage after the friend had recorded, so they have constructive notice of the friend's mortgage. Therefore, the bank's mortgage is junior to the friend's. But the bank took their mortgage before the investor recorded. At that time, the investor's mortgage was unrecorded, so the bank had no notice of it. Therefore, the bank's mortgage would have priority over the investor's.

Wait, that can't be right because the investor's mortgage was created before the bank's. But the bank didn't have notice of it when they took their mortgage, so the bank's mortgage would take priority under the recording statute.

So, the priority order would be:

1. Friend (recorded first)
2. Bank (subsequent purchaser without notice of investor's mortgage)
3. Investor (recorded after bank's mortgage was given, but bank had no notice)

Wait, no, because the investor recorded before the bank. So when the investor records, the bank's mortgage is unrecorded. So, the investor's recorded mortgage would take priority over the bank's unrecorded mortgage, right?

But the bank was a BFP without notice when they took their mortgage. So, their mortgage should have priority over the investor's, even if the investor later records.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for a different approach.

Another way: the recording statute says that an unrecorded instrument is void against a subsequent purchaser who paid value and had no notice.

So, for each mortgage, we check if any subsequent mortgages are protected by the statute.

Friend's mortgage: recorded first. So, any subsequent mortgages (investor and bank) are subject to the friend's unless they are protected by the statute.

Investor's mortgage: created after the friend's. When the investor took their mortgage, the friend's was unrecorded. Then the friend records. So, the investor's mortgage would be void against the friend's mortgage because the friend recorded before the investor. Wait, no, because the friend was first in time, and recorded first, so the investor's mortgage is junior.

Wait, no. The investor's mortgage was created after the friend's. But the friend didn't record until after the investor's mortgage was created. So, when the friend records, does that make the friend's mortgage prior to the investor's?

Yes, because the friend was first in time and recorded first. So, the investor's mortgage is junior to the friend's.

Now, the bank's mortgage: created after the friend's was recorded. So, the bank has constructive notice of the friend's mortgage. Therefore, the bank
