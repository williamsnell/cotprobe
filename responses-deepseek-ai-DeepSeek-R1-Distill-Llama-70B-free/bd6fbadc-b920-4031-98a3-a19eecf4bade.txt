Okay, so I have this question about what "Svetambara" means. I'm a bit rusty on my terms, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that Svetambara is a term related to Jainism. I think it's one of the two main sects. Oh right, the other one is Digambara. The names probably have something to do with their clothing practices.

Let me break down the word. "Sveta" sounds familiar. In Sanskrit, "sveta" means white. So the first part is "white". Now the second part, "ambara". I'm pretty sure "ambara" relates to clothing or garments. Like, maybe it's a type of robe or something they wear.

So putting it together, "Svetambara" would mean "white-clad". That makes sense because I remember that Svetambara monks wear white robes, whereas Digambara monks are sky-clad, meaning they don't wear clothes.

Looking at the options, option J is "White-clad". That seems to fit. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing anything up. 

Option D is "Sky-clad", which I think is Digambara. Option F is "Naked", which might be another way to describe Digambara. Option G is "Light-clad", which could be misleading but doesn't directly translate. 

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is J: White-clad.

The term "Svetambara" is derived from the Sanskrit words "sveta," meaning white, and "ambara," meaning clothed. It refers to a sect of Jainism where monks wear white robes. Among the given options, "White-clad" accurately describes this practice.
