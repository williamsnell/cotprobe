Okay, so I need to find the partial-fraction expansion of F(s) which is (8s + 2) divided by (s² + 3s + 2). Hmm, I remember that partial fractions are used when you have a rational function, and you want to break it down into simpler fractions. 

First, I should factor the denominator. The denominator is s² + 3s + 2. Let me see, what two numbers multiply to 2 and add up to 3? Oh right, 1 and 2. So the denominator factors into (s + 1)(s + 2). So F(s) becomes (8s + 2)/[(s + 1)(s + 2)].

Now, the next step is to express this as the sum of two fractions: A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 2). So I can write (8s + 2) = A(s + 2) + B(s + 1). 

To find A and B, I can use the method of equating coefficients or plug in suitable values for s. Let me try plugging in s = -1 and s = -2 because that will make one of the terms zero each time.

When s = -1:
Left side: 8*(-1) + 2 = -8 + 2 = -6.
Right side: A(-1 + 2) + B(0) → A(1) + 0 → A.
So A = -6.

When s = -2:
Left side: 8*(-2) + 2 = -16 + 2 = -14.
Right side: A(0) + B(-2 + 1) → 0 + B(-1) → -B.
So -B = -14 → B =14.

Wait, so A is -6 and B is 14. That means the partial fractions are (-6)/(s +1) + 14/(s +2).

Looking at the options, let me check each one. 

Option H says [(-6)/(s+1)] + [14/(s+2)], which matches what I got. Option G has the same numbers but in the reverse order, but no, the denominators are (s+2) and (s+1), so no, H is correct.

Wait another thought, let me verify by another method. Let me compute the numerator by combining the fractions.

So, (-6)(s+2) +14(s+1) = -6s -12 +14s +14. Combine like terms: (-6s +14s) =8s, and (-12 +14)=2. So 8s +2, which matches the original numerator. So yeah, that's correct.

So the correct option should be H.

To find the partial-fraction expansion of \( F(s) = \frac{8s + 2}{s^2 + 3s + 2} \), we first factor the denominator:

\[
s^2 + 3s + 2 = (s + 1)(s + 2).
\]

Thus, we express \( F(s) \) as:

\[
F(s) = \frac{8s + 2}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{A}{s + 1} + \frac{B}{s + 2}.
\]

To determine \( A \) and \( B \), we write:

\[
8s + 2 = A(s + 2) + B(s + 1).
\]

Expanding and equating coefficients:

- For \( s = -1 \):  
  \[
  8(-1) + 2 = -8 + 2 = -6 = A(-1 + 2) \implies A = -6.
  \]

- For \( s = -2 \):  
  \[
  8(-2) + 2 = -16 + 2 = -14 = B(-2 + 1) \implies B = 14.
  \]

Thus, the partial-fraction expansion is:

\[
F(s) = \frac{-6}{s + 1} + \frac{14}{s + 2}.
\]

Comparing with the options, this matches **Option H**.

Answer: H
