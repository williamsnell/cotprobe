Okay, so I've got this combinatorics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says that there's a group of 10 people, and they're being split into three different committees. The committees have 3, 4, and 3 people respectively. I need to find out in how many ways this can be done.

Hmm, so the first thing I think is that this involves combinations because the order in which we select people doesn't matter. But wait, since the committees are different, maybe I need to consider the order as well, or at least account for the different groupings.

Let me break it down. So, total people are 10. We need to split them into three groups: one of size 3, another of size 4, and the third of size 3 again. Oh wait, wait, two committees of size 3 and one of size 4. So the sizes are 3,4,3. 

Wait, but the committees are different. Oh, but the two committees of size 3 are different because they're separate committees. So does that mean that the order in which we select the 3-person groups matters? Like, Committee A has 3, Committee B has 4, Committee C has 3. So they're distinct committees, so the order in which we form them matters.

So perhaps I should think of this as a multi-step selection process. First, choose 3 people out of 10 for the first committee. Then, from the remaining 7, choose 4 for the second committee. Then, the remaining 3 automatically form the third committee.

Wait, but let me think about that. The formula for combinations is n choose k is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So first step: 10 choose 3, which is 120. Then, from the remaining 7, choose 4: 7 choose 4 is 35. Then, the remaining 3 go to the last committee, which would be 1 way, since 3 choose 3 is 1.

So the total number of ways would be 120 * 35 * 1. Let me calculate that. 120*35 is 4200. Hmm, 4200. Let me check the options. Option H is 4200. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. What if the two committees of size 3 are indistinct? Because if the committees are different, like named as Committee 1 and Committee 3, then the order matters. But if they're just two committees of same size, and the problem doesn't specify they're different, maybe I need to divide by something to account for that.

Wait, the problem says "3 different committees", so each has its own identity. So the order in which I select the committees matters. For example, first selecting Committee A (3 people) and then Committee C (3 people) is different from selecting Committee C first and then Committee A. So in that case, the initial approach of 10C3 *7C4 *3C3 would be correct. Because the committees are distinct, so the order in which we pick them matters.

Wait, but in this case, the committees are of size 3,4,3. So if I first choose 3, then 4, then 3, the product would be 10C3 *7C4 *3C3. Which is 120 *35 *1=4200. That's option H.

But wait another thought. Alternatively, perhaps the problem could be approached using multinomial coefficients. The multinomial coefficient generalizes combinations when you're dividing into groups of specified sizes. So the formula is n! divided by the product of (k1! k2! ... km!), where the k's are the sizes of each group.

In this case, the groups are 3,4,3, and 10. So the multinomial coefficient is 10!/(3!4!3!). Let me calculate that.

10! is 3628800.

3! is 6, so 6*6 is 36, and 4! is 24. So 3!4!3! = 6 *24 *6 = 864. So 3628800 divided by 864. Let me compute that.

3628800 / 864. Hmm, let's see. 864 * 4200 = ? Let me compute 864 * 4200. 864 *4000 is 3,456,000. 864 * 200=172,800. So 3,456,000 + 172,800=3,628,800. Oh wait, that's exactly 10! So 3628800 / 864 = 4200. So that gives the same result as the first method. So that's 4200, so option H.

But wait, in the multinomial approach, when the groups are of the same size, you have to account for whether they're distinguishable or not. Because if the two groups of 3 are indistinct, you would divide by 2! to correct for overcounting.

Wait, but in this problem, the committees are different, meaning they are distinguishable. So perhaps in the multinomial approach, the groups are considered distinguishable, so we don't need to divide by anything else. So 10!/(3!4!3!) = 4200.

So that matches both methods. So the correct answer should be 4200, which is option H.

I don't see any other factors here. So I think the answer is H.

To determine the number of ways to split a group of 10 people into three different committees of sizes 3, 4, and 3, we can use the concept of combinations and the multinomial coefficient. Since the committees are distinct, the order in which we select the groups matters.

### Step 1: Using Combinations
1. First, choose 3 people out of 10 for the first committee:
   \[
   \binom{10}{3} = 120
   \]
2. Next, choose 4 people out of the remaining 7 for the second committee:
   \[
   \binom{7}{4} = 35
   \]
3. Finally, the remaining 3 people automatically form the third committee:
   \[
   \binom{3}{3} = 1
   \]
4. Multiply these results together to get the total number of ways:
   \[
   120 \times 35 \times 1 = 4200
   \]

### Step 2: Using the Multinomial Coefficient
The multinomial coefficient for dividing \(n\) items into groups of sizes \(k_1, k_2, \dots, k_m\) is given by:
\[
\frac{n!}{k_1! \cdot k_2! \cdot \dots \cdot k_m!}
\]
Here, \(n = 10\) and the group sizes are \(3, 4, 3\). Thus:
\[
\frac{10!}{3! \cdot 4! \cdot 3!} = \frac{3628800}{6 \cdot 24 \cdot 6} = \frac{3628800}{864} = 4200
\]

### Conclusion
Both methods confirm that the total number of ways to form the committees is **4200**. Since the committees are distinct, there is no need to adjust for indistinguishability. The correct answer is:

**H: 4200**
