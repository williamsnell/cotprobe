Okay, so I've got this question about the number of electrons, neutrons, and protons in a Chromium atom, specifically 52Cr. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the atomic number of an element gives the number of protons (and usually electrons in a neutral atom). Chromium has an atomic number of 24, right? So that means in a neutral Chromium atom, there are 24 protons and 24 electrons.

Wait, but the question is about 52Cr. Oh, right, the number after the element symbol is the mass number, which is the sum of protons and neutrons. So the mass number here is 52. If protons are 24, then the neutrons would be 52 minus 24. Let me calculate that: 52 - 24 equals 28. So there are 28 neutrons.

Putting it all together: 24 protons, 24 electrons (since it's neutral), and 28 neutrons.

Now looking at the options:

Option H says 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. That matches what I just calculated. Let me double-check the other options quickly to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: 28 electrons, which would mean the atom is charged because 28 electrons and 27 protons would make it -1. But the question says "an atom of 52Cr," which I assume is neutral, so A is probably wrong.

Option B: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 27 neutrons. Wait, that gives a mass number of 24+27=51, but our isotope is 52. So B doesn't fit.

Option C: 24 each, but that's mass 48, which is much lower than 52. So no.

Option D: 24 electrons, 28 protons? Wait, that can't be right because Chromium's atomic number is 24. So protons can't be 28. So D is out.

Option E: 28 electrons, 24 protons. So charge would be +4? But the question doesn't mention ions, so E is probably not correct.

Option F: 24 electrons, 28 protons? Again, that would be a different element, maybe nickel, which has atomic number 28. So F is wrong.

Option G: 27 electrons, 24 protons would mean it's a -1 charge. Unless it's an ion, but the question is about an atom, so I think G is incorrect.

Option I: 28 electrons and protons. That would be nickel again, not Chromium. So I isn't right.

Option J: 27 protons? No, Chromium is 24, so J is wrong.

So the only option that matches 24 electrons, 24 protons, and 28 neutrons is option H.

To determine the number of electrons, neutrons, and protons in an atom of \(^{52}\text{Cr}\), we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Atomic Number**: The atomic number of Chromium (Cr) is 24. This means the atom has 24 protons and, in its neutral state, 24 electrons.
2. **Mass Number**: The mass number of \(^{52}\text{Cr}\) is 52, which is the sum of protons and neutrons. Since the number of protons is 24, the number of neutrons can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Neutrons} = \text{Mass Number} - \text{Protons} = 52 - 24 = 28
   \]

Thus, \(^{52}\text{Cr}\) has **24 protons**, **24 electrons**, and **28 neutrons**.

Now, evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It lists 28 electrons, which would imply a charged atom, but the question specifies a neutral atom.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It lists 27 neutrons, which does not match the calculated 28 neutrons.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It lists 24 neutrons, which is inconsistent with the mass number of 52.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It lists 28 protons, which is incorrect because Chromium has an atomic number of 24.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It lists 28 electrons, which would imply a charged atom.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It lists 28 protons, which is inconsistent with Chromium's atomic number.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. It lists 27 electrons, which would imply a charged atom.
- **Option H**: Correct. It lists 24 electrons, 24 protons, and 28 neutrons, which matches the calculations.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It lists 28 protons and electrons, which corresponds to a different element.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. It lists 27 protons, which is inconsistent with Chromium's atomic number.

The correct answer is **Option H**.
