Question:

The local high school football team won the state championship. After the game the high school held a victory rally at the high school gym. As the team was being honored, the star quarterback of the football team approached one of the cheerleaders and asked her out for a date. The cheerleader, who had a crush on the quarterback, said she'd love to go out with him. The quarterback told her, "Great, I'll pick you up at eight. "Later that evening, the quarterback was getting ready to drive to the cheerleader's home when his car wouldn't start. The quarterback then called his next-door neighbor and asked him if he could borrow his car. The neighbor agreed, but told him, "Okay, but make sure you return it by 2:00 a. m. " The quarterback assented and then drove to the cheerleader's house. After picking her up, they drove to an all-night coffee shop where they spent the night talking and catching up over coffee and waffles. Losing track of time, the quarterback and the cheerleader did not leave the coffee shop until 3:00 a. m. After returning home around 4:00 a. m. , the quarterback decided that it was too late to return the car, so he parked it in his driveway. He intended to return the car to the neighbor in the morning. A short while later, a thief stole the neighbor's car from outside the quarterback's home. The police found the car three months later, undamaged. The neighbor, however, refused to accept the car and brought a claim against the quarterback for conversion. In his claim, the neighbor will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the quarterback was not responsible for the theft.
B: not succeed, because the quarterback had no control over the actions of the thief.
C: succeed, because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car.
D: succeed, because the quarterback left the car in his driveway, and it was stolen.
E: not succeed, because the car was returned undamaged.
F: not succeed, because the criminal act of the thief was unforeseeable.
G: succeed, because the quarterback could have returned the car and failed to do so.
H: succeed, because the quarterback failed to follow the neighbor's condition to return it by 2:00 a.m.
I: not succeed, because the quarterback intended to return the identical property he borrowed in an undamaged condition.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically conversion. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario. The quarterback borrows his neighbor's car to go on a date. The neighbor agrees but sets a condition: return it by 2 a.m. But the quarterback and the cheerleader lose track of time and don't leave the coffee shop until 3 a.m. Then, when he gets home around 4 a.m., he decides it's too late to return the car, so he parks it in his driveway. Later, a thief steals the car from there. The car is found three months later undamaged, but the neighbor refuses to take it back and sues the quarterback for conversion.

The question is whether the neighbor's claim for conversion will succeed. The options are A to J, but let's focus on the key points.

Conversion is when someone significantly interferes with someone else's personal property, effectively depriving them of it. For conversion to apply, the defendant's actions must be substantial and intentional, showing a disregard for the plaintiff's rights.

In this case, the quarterback borrowed the car with permission, so initially, it's not conversion. However, he failed to return it by the agreed time. But here's the thing: he didn't intend to steal the car or keep it. He just didn't return it on time, planning to do so the next morning. Then, while it's in his driveway, a thief steals it.

So the key issue is whether the quarterback's failure to return the car on time constitutes conversion. Alternatively, whether the theft by a third party makes him liable.

I remember that borrowing something with permission (like a bailee in a bailment situation) creates a duty to return it. If the borrower fails to return it, that could be conversion. But wait, the quarterback intended to return it, just not at the agreed time. So maybe he's in breach of contract or negligence, but not conversion.

Conversion requires more than just failing to return; it's an intentional act. If he kept the car beyond the time, but intended to return it, that's more like a breach of the bailment terms, perhaps leading to liability for any damages, but not conversion.

Alternatively, if he had used the car beyond the scope of the permission, that's conversion. But here, he used it for the agreed purpose—driving to the date—and just kept it longer. So, maybe that's a problem.

But the car was stolen while in his possession. The neighbor is suing him for conversion, not for negligence that led to theft. So the issue is whether the quarterback's actions in keeping the car longer than agreed amount to conversion.

Another point: when the neighbor told him to return by 2 a.m., and he didn't, at what point does the permission end? After 2 a.m., the quarterback is no longer authorized to possess the car. So, from 2 a.m. onwards, he's in unlawful possession. So, the car was in his possession without consent beyond that time.

But then, the theft happens while he's possessing it unlawfully. So, perhaps the neighbor can argue that the quarterback's unlawful retention led to the loss.

Wait, but conversion is about the defendant's intentional act. If the quarterback didn't intend to steal the car, but just failed to return it, does that count as conversion?

I think that if someone retains possession beyond the allowed time without intent to steal, it's not conversion. Conversion requires an act that is a significant interference, like selling it, keeping it, etc. Mere failure to return on time is more about breach of bailment, possibly leading to liability for damages if the property is lost, but not conversion.

So, in this case, the quarterback didn't commit conversion. The theft was by a third party, and the quarterback didn't cause it. His only wrongdoing was keeping the car past the agreed time, but without intent to deprive the neighbor permanently.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the neighbor will succeed because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car. That relates more to negligence, not conversion. So C might not be the right reason.

Option G says he could have returned the car and failed to do so. But again, that's about failing to return, not conversion.

Option H says he failed to follow the neighbor's condition to return by 2 a.m. That's about breach, but does that equate to conversion? I'm not sure.

Option A and B suggest the claim won't succeed because the QB wasn't responsible for the theft or had no control over the thief. But the issue isn't about the theft, but the QB's actions.

Option I says the QB intended to return the identical property undamaged. That would negate conversion, as conversion requires an intent to interfere substantially.

So, I think the correct answer is that the neighbor will not succeed because the QB didn't commit conversion. The QB's failure to return on time might be a breach of contract or bailment, but not conversion.

Wait, but if the QB was supposed to return it by 2 a.m., and he didn't, then after 2 a.m., he's holding onto it without permission. At that point, the neighbor could argue that the QB has converted the car by retaining it beyond the agreed time. But conversion also requires that the defendant's actions were inconsistent with the owner's rights. So, if the QB was just keeping it longer but intended to return it, maybe he hasn't committed conversion.

In some jurisdictions, retaining property beyond the bailment period without intent to steal can still be conversion. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be considered a continuing trespass, but again, that's more about trespass to chattels than conversion.

Wait, another angle: conversion can occur when the bailee uses the property in a way that's beyond the scope of the bailment. But in this case, the QB used it for the intended purpose—driving. He just kept it longer. So perhaps that's not beyond the scope.

So, the key here is whether the QB's conduct constitutes conversion. I think it doesn't because he didn't intend to deprive the neighbor of the car; he just didn't return it on time. Therefore, the neighbor's claim for conversion would not succeed.

Looking back at the options, option A says the neighbor won't succeed because the QB wasn't responsible for the theft. But the claim is about conversion, not about negligence leading to theft. So maybe that's not the right reasoning.

Option I says the QB intended to return the identical property undamaged. If that's the case, then it's not conversion because there's no intent to interfere with the owner's rights. Conversion requires an intent to exercise control over the property in a way that's inconsistent with the owner's rights.

So, the QB's actions, although wrong in not returning on time, don't rise to the level of conversion because he intended to return it. Therefore, the neighbor's claim for conversion won't succeed.

So the correct answer would be option I.

The question revolves around whether the neighbor's claim for conversion against the quarterback will succeed. Conversion requires a substantial interference with the owner's personal property, demonstrating a disregard for their rights. In this case, the quarterback borrowed the car with permission but failed to return it by the agreed-upon time of 2:00 a.m. Instead, he kept it until 4:00 a.m. and parked it in his driveway, where it was later stolen. The car was eventually recovered undamaged, but the neighbor refused to accept it and sued for conversion.

Key points to consider:

1. **Conversion Definition**: Conversion involves an intentional act that significantly interferes with the owner's property rights, such as stealing, selling, or destroying the property. It requires an intent to deprive the owner of their property or to exercise control over it in a way inconsistent with the owner's rights.

2. **Borrowing and Bailment**: The quarterback borrowed the car with the neighbor's permission, creating a bailment relationship. The quarterback had a duty to return the car by the agreed time. While failing to return the car on time constitutes a breach of this duty, it does not automatically amount to conversion unless there is an intent to deprive the owner of the property.

3. **Intent to Return**: The quarterback intended to return the car the next morning, even though he missed the agreed deadline. This intent to return the property undermines the claim of conversion, as conversion requires an intent to interfere with the owner's rights, not merely a temporary retention.

4. **Theft by a Third Party**: The car was stolen while in the quarterback's possession. However, the claim is not about the theft itself but whether the quarterback's actions constitute conversion. The quarterback's failure to return the car on time does not directly cause the theft, and the car was ultimately recovered undamaged.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The issue is not whether the quarterback was responsible for the theft but whether his actions constituted conversion.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The quarterback's lack of control over the thief is irrelevant to the conversion claim.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The obligation to protect the car relates to negligence, not conversion.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The car being stolen does not automatically make the quarterback liable for conversion.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The car being returned undamaged does not negate the conversion claim if the quarterback's actions otherwise qualify.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The foreseeability of the theft is irrelevant to the conversion claim.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The failure to return the car by 2:00 a.m. does not, by itself, constitute conversion.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Failing to meet the return condition is a breach of the agreement but not necessarily conversion.
   - **Option I**: Correct. The quarterback intended to return the car in the same condition, which negates the intent required for conversion.

**Conclusion**: The neighbor's claim for conversion will not succeed because the quarterback intended to return the car and did not act with the intent required to commit conversion.
