Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the convolution of two functions f(t) and g(t). The functions given are f(t) = t and g(t) = t². Hmm, I remember convolution involves some kind of integral, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think about how convolution works.

Convolution of two functions f and g is defined as (f * g)(t) which equals the integral from 0 to t of f(τ) * g(t - τ) dτ. Oh right, τ is a dummy variable here. So I need to set up the integral for this specific case.

So f(τ) is τ, and g(t - τ) would be (t - τ) squared. Let me write that out: (t - τ)^2. So the integrand becomes τ * (t - τ)^2.

Expanding (t - τ)^2, I get t² - 2tτ + τ². So now the integrand is τ times each term. Let's multiply it out:

τ * t² = t² τ
τ * (-2tτ) = -2t τ²
τ * τ² = τ³

So putting it all together, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to t of [t² τ - 2t τ² + τ³] dτ.

Now, I can split this integral into three separate terms:

Integral of t² τ dτ minus integral of 2t τ² dτ plus integral of τ³ dτ, all evaluated from 0 to t.

Let me compute each integral one by one. 

First integral: ∫ t² τ dτ. Since t² is a constant with respect to τ, this is t² multiplied by ∫ τ dτ from 0 to t. The integral of τ dτ is (1/2)τ². Evaluated from 0 to t, this becomes (1/2)t². So the first term is t² * (1/2 t²) = (1/2) t⁴.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the integral is t² multiplied by ∫τ dτ from 0 to t. Let me recheck. No, wait: the integrand is t² τ, so the integral is t² * [τ²/2] from 0 to t. So that would be t² * (t²/2 - 0) ) = (t^4)/2.

Second term: -2t ∫ τ² dτ from 0 to t. The integral of τ² is τ³/3. Evaluated from 0 to t, it's t³/3. So this term is -2t * (t³/3) = - (2t^4)/3.

Third term: ∫ τ³ dτ from 0 to t. The integral is τ^4/4. Evaluated, it's t^4/4. So the third term is + t^4/4.

Now, combining all three terms together:

First term: t^4/2
Second term: - (2t^4)/3
Third term: + t^4/4

So adding them up: (t^4/2) - (2t^4/3) + (t^4/4).

To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, denominators are 2, 3, 4. The least common denominator is 12.

Convert each term:

t^4/2 = 6 t^4 / 12
2t^4/3 = 8 t^4 /12 (but with a negative sign)
t^4/4 = 3 t^4 /12

So putting them together: (6/12 - 8/12 + 3/12) t^4.

6 -8 +3 = 1. So 1/12 t^4.

Wait, that gives (1/12) t^4. So the convolution is (t^4)/12.

Looking back at the options, option B is (t^4 /12). So the answer should be B.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the signs? Let me double-check.

Wait, the second term is -2t * (t^3/3) = - (2/3) t^4.

So when I add the three terms:

( (1/2) - (2/3) + (1/4) ) t^4.

Let me compute 1/2 - 2/3 + 1/4.

Find a common denominator, which is 12.

1/2 = 6/12, 2/3 = 8/12, 1/4=3/12.

So 6/12 -8/12 +3/12 = (6-8+3)/12 = 1/12. Yep, that's correct.

So the convolution is t^4 /12, which is option B.

To find the convolution \( f(t) * g(t) \), where \( f(t) = t \) and \( g(t) = t^2 \), we use the definition of convolution:

\[
(f * g)(t) = \int_0^t f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau.
\]

Substituting \( f(\tau) = \tau \) and \( g(t - \tau) = (t - \tau)^2 \), the integrand becomes:

\[
\tau \cdot (t - \tau)^2 = \tau \cdot (t^2 - 2t\tau + \tau^2) = t^2\tau - 2t\tau^2 + \tau^3.
\]

Thus, the convolution integral is:

\[
(f * g)(t) = \int_0^t \left( t^2\tau - 2t\tau^2 + \tau^3 \right) \, d\tau.
\]

This can be split into three separate integrals:

\[
(f * g)(t) = t^2 \int_0^t \tau \, d\tau - 2t \int_0^t \tau^2 \, d\tau + \int_0^t \tau^3 \, d\tau.
\]

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   t^2 \int_0^t \tau \, d\tau = t^2 \cdot \frac{\tau^2}{2} \Big|_0^t = t^2 \cdot \frac{t^2}{2} = \frac{t^4}{2}.
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   -2t \int_0^t \tau^2 \, d\tau = -2t \cdot \frac{\tau^3}{3} \Big|_0^t = -2t \cdot \frac{t^3}{3} = -\frac{2t^4}{3}.
   \]

3. **Third term**:  
   \[
   \int_0^t \tau^3 \, d\tau = \frac{\tau^4}{4} \Big|_0^t = \frac{t^4}{4}.
   \]

Combining all three terms:

\[
(f * g)(t) = \frac{t^4}{2} - \frac{2t^4}{3} + \frac{t^4}{4}.
\]

To add these fractions, we find a common denominator (12):

\[
\frac{t^4}{2} = \frac{6t^4}{12}, \quad -\frac{2t^4}{3} = -\frac{8t^4}{12}, \quad \frac{t^4}{4} = \frac{3t^4}{12}.
\]

Adding them together:

\[
\frac{6t^4}{12} - \frac{8t^4}{12} + \frac{3t^4}{12} = \frac{t^4}{12}.
\]

Thus, the convolution is:

\[
(f * g)(t) = \frac{t^4}{12}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: \( \frac{t^4}{12} \)**.
