Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about nominal income, real income, and the price level. Hmm, I remember that nominal income is the actual money you have, and real income is how much that money can buy, adjusted for inflation. So, if prices go up, your real income might go down even if your nominal income increases.

The question says that my nominal income rises by 4 percent and my real income falls by 1 percent. I need to find out how the price level changed. I think the formula connecting these is something like real income equals nominal income divided by the price level. Oh wait, maybe it's an index. So, real income = nominal income / price level, or perhaps using percentage changes.

Wait, percentage changes might be easier here. I remember that the percentage change in real income is approximately equal to the percentage change in nominal income minus the percentage change in the price level. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If your nominal income goes up by 4% and prices go up, say, 5%, then your real income would decrease because the purchasing power is less. So, the formula should be real income change = nominal change - price change. Or wait, maybe it's (nominal income change - inflation rate) equals real income change. Because inflation reduces purchasing power.

So, if I denote:

Real Income Change = Nominal Income Change - Inflation Rate

In this case, real income falls by 1%, so that's a -1% change. Nominal income rises by 4%, so that's +4%. So plugging in:

-1% = 4% - Inflation Rate

Wait, that would mean Inflation Rate is 4% - (-1%)? No, wait, let me rearrange the equation. If Real = Nominal - Inflation, then Inflation = Nominal - Real.

So, Inflation Rate = 4% - (-1%) = 5%? Because 4 minus (-1) is 5. So the price level increased by 5%?

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose my nominal income increases by 4%, but prices increase by 5%. Then my real income would be 4% -5% = -1%, which matches the question. So the price level went up by 5%, which means the inflation rate is 5%.

Looking at the options, option E is a 5% increase. So the answer should be E.

To determine the change in the price level, we use the relationship between nominal income, real income, and inflation. The formula is:

\[
\text{Real Income Change} = \text{Nominal Income Change} - \text{Inflation Rate}
\]

Given in the question:
- Nominal income rises by 4% (\(+4\%\)).
- Real income falls by 1% (\(-1\%\)).

Rearranging the formula to solve for the inflation rate:

\[
\text{Inflation Rate} = \text{Nominal Income Change} - \text{Real Income Change}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Inflation Rate} = 4\% - (-1\%) = 5\%
\]

This means the price level increased by 5%. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **E: 5 percent increase**.
