The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A doctor who was licensed to practice medicine in a particular state was convicted in state court of improperly distributing specified drugs by writing prescriptions for fictitious persons. Under state law, such an abuse of the prescription-writing privilege requires revocation of a doctor's license. After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing. The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license. The doctor does not deny the conviction or the factual basis for it. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the state medical board?

Options:

A: The doctor's conviction in state court is enough evidence of his guilt, and a hearing before the board would be redundant and unnecessary.
B: The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.
C: The board's decision to revoke the doctor's license without a hearing is justified because of the severe nature of the doctor's crime.
D: The licensing board was required to summarily revoke the doctor's license because Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the licensing board to give full faith and credit to the doctor's criminal conviction.
E: The medical board was merely following state law, which requires revocation of a doctor's license in such cases.
F: Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding.
G: The medical board has an obligation to protect the public from doctors who abuse their prescription-writing privileges, and a hearing would delay necessary action.
H: The doctor has already had a fair trial in a court of law, and the board's hearing would not change the outcome of that trial.
I: The doctor's admission of the conviction and its factual basis eliminates the need for a hearing before the board.
J: A doctor's license to practice is a privilege, not a right, and therefore is not property within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about due process and medical licensing. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a doctor was convicted in state court for improperly distributing drugs by writing prescriptions for fictitious people. State law says that this kind of abuse requires the revocation of the doctor's license. After the state medical board got official notice of the conviction, they revoked his license without giving him a hearing. Now, the doctor is suing, claiming he was deprived of property without due process because there was no hearing before the revocation.

The question is asking which argument is the strongest in support of the state medical board. So, I need to figure out which of the options A through J is the best defense for the board's actions.

First, I recall that due process under the Fourteenth Amendment requires that before the government deprives someone of life, liberty, or property, they must have notice and an opportunity to be heard. But sometimes, especially in administrative settings, the process can be more streamlined, especially if certain factors are present.

In this case, the doctor's license was revoked without a hearing. The doctor doesn't deny the conviction or the facts, which means the issue is really about whether a hearing was necessary.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the conviction is enough evidence, so a hearing is redundant. Hmm, but even if the conviction is final, the licensing board might need to determine if the crime relates to the doctor's ability to practice. Though in this case, state law automatically requires revocation upon such a conviction, so perhaps the facts are already established.

Option B mentions adjudicative facts were determined in the criminal trial, so no further hearing is needed. Adjudicative facts are the specific facts of the case, as opposed to legislative facts which are more general. Since the conviction already decided those facts, maybe the board can rely on that without a new hearing.

Option C argues the severe nature of the crime justifies no hearing. But due process usually requires some form of hearing, regardless of the severity, unless there's an emergency or imminent danger, which isn't indicated here.

Option D talks about full faith and credit under Article IV. That's the constitutional clause requiring states to recognize each other's laws and judgments. But the issue here is state law, not another state's, so I don't think this applies.

Option E says the board followed state law requiring revocation. If state law mandates revocation upon conviction, then the board had no choice but to revoke the license. But does that negate the need for a hearing? It might depend on whether the law allows for any exceptions or discretion.

Option F mentions balancing interests under due process. The state's interest in public safety versus the doctor's interest in a hearing. Mathews v. Eldridge comes to mind, where the court balances the private interest, risk of error, and government's interest. But the question is whether any hearing is needed, not the type or extent.

Option G says the board protects the public and a hearing would delay action. That's more of a policy argument, but due process might still require some form of hearing, even if expedited.

Option H states the doctor had a fair trial in court, so no need for another hearing. But a criminal trial and a licensing hearing serve different purposes. The criminal trial determines guilt, while the administrative hearing might assess the impact on the doctor's license. Although, if the conviction is final and the law ties the revocation directly to the conviction, maybe they can rely on that.

Option I says the doctor admitted the conviction, so no hearing needed. If the facts are stipulated, perhaps a hearing isn't necessary, but the process might still require some formality.

Option J claims a license is a privilege, not a property right. Wait, I thought that's an older view. Under current law, a professional license is considered a property interest protected by due process. So this argument might be outdated. Like, in cases where a license is revoked, due process applies because it's a property interest. So J is probably incorrect.

So, considering all these, the strongest arguments would be either B or E. Let me think deeper.

If the state law requires revocation upon conviction, then the board is just following the law. But does that eliminate the need for a hearing? Usually, even if the conclusion is mandatory, the individual might be entitled to a hearing to present mitigating factors or challenge the basis, but if the law is clear and the conviction is final, perhaps the board can act without a hearing.

Wait, in some cases, when a statute mandates automatic revocation upon conviction, it's possible that due process is satisfied by the criminal trial because it's a judicial determination. So the administrative body doesn't need to hold another hearing because the facts were already litigated.

In that case, Option B seems strong because the adjudicative facts (that he committed the crime) were determined in the criminal trial, so the board doesn't need to redo that. The doctor had his chance to contest the facts in the criminal case. Since he doesn't deny the conviction, the board can rely on that.

Alternatively, Option E says the board was following state law. That's true, but the issue is whether following the law without a hearing violates due process. Even if the law requires revocation, the method of revocation must comply with due process, which might require a hearing unless an exception applies.

So Option B seems better because it speaks to the prior adjudication of the necessary facts, making a new hearing unnecessary. 

Wait, but in the case where the conviction is a final judgment, the board might be able to rely on that without a hearing. That's similar to how a state can revoke a driver's license upon a DUI conviction without another hearing, because the conviction itself provides the necessary due process.

Therefore, the strongest argument is that the adjudicative facts were already determined in the criminal trial, so no further hearing is needed. So the answer would be B.

The strongest argument in support of the state medical board is that the adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore, due process does not require any further trial-type hearing. Since the doctor does not deny the conviction or the factual basis for it, the board can rely on the criminal trial's determination of guilt, making a separate administrative hearing redundant. This approach aligns with the principle that due process is satisfied when the essential facts have already been adjudicated in a prior judicial proceeding.

**Answer: B**
