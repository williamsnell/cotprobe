Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"But you, my dear Pangloss," said Candide, "how can it be that I behold you again?"
"It is true," said Pangloss, "that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us."
"Well, my dear Pangloss," said Candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"
"I am still of my first opinion," answered Pangloss, "for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."
Voltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759

Okay, so I've got this question about Voltaire's Candide, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the passage and the question again.

The passage is from Candide, where Pangloss is telling his story of being hanged, dissected, and ending up in the galleys. Candide asks him if, after all that suffering, he still believes that everything happens for the best. Pangloss says yes, sticking to his philosophical views about pre-established harmony and Leibniz's ideas.

The question is about the "concatenation of universal events" that brought the characters together on the ship. It's asking what 18th-century fondness this illustrates. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in the 18th century, especially during the Enlightenment, there were various philosophical ideas. Voltaire was a key figure and used satire a lot. Candide, in particular, is a critique of the optimism that says everything is for the best, which was associated with Leibniz.

So, the phrase "concatenation of universal events" sounds like a fancy way of saying a chain of causes and effects or a series of connected events. In the context of the story, it's bringing Candide and Pangloss together, but it's presented in a way that might be poking fun at philosophical ideas.

Looking at the options:

A: Unpredictability and randomness. Maybe, but the term used is "concatenation," which implies a chain or sequence, not randomness.

B: Divine plan or destiny. That's more of a religious view, and Voltaire was critiquing that kind of thinking, especially the optimism of Leibniz.

C: Using complex language to hide harsh realities. That's possible, but the question is about what the phrase illustrates, not the language's purpose.

D: Maritime metaphor for human existence. The galley is a setting, but the question is about the concatenation, not the setting itself.

E: Satire to critique social and religious institutions. This sounds relevant because Voltaire uses satire throughout Candide to mock the excesses of the church and optimistic philosophy.

F: Cause-effect to systematize human behavior. The phrase does suggest a chain of events, but the question is about 18th-century fondness. I'm not sure if systematizing behavior was the focus here.

G: High social status with big words. That might be a byproduct, but the main point is elsewhere.

H: Mocking philosophical theories through absurdity. Yes, because Pangloss's story is absurd and he sticks to his optimistic views despite suffering, which is a critique of those theories.

I: Naval power and European nation-states. The galley is a naval setting, but the question isn't about naval power.

J: Drawing universal conclusions from data. That's more about scientific methods, maybe, but not directly related here.

So, the phrase "concatenation of universal events" is used in a way that seems to mock the idea that everything is part of a grand, rational plan. Pangloss keeps believing in the best despite all the suffering, which is absurd. This is Voltaire using satire to critique the philosophical optimism of his time.

Therefore, the correct answer would be H: mocking the philosophical theories of the time through absurd scenarios. Or perhaps E, which is about satire critiquing social and religious institutions. Wait, E is broader, including satire in general, while H is more specific about the philosophical theories.

The question refers to the illustration of 18th-century fondness. The fondness here is for discussing philosophical ideas and using satire to critique them. So, the answer is H.

The phrase "concatenation of universal events" in the passage is used to highlight the absurdity of Pangloss's unwavering belief in philosophical optimism, despite the series of horrific and illogical events he endures. Voltaire employs satire to mock the philosophical theories of his time, particularly the optimism associated with Leibniz, by presenting absurd and unjust scenarios that undermine the idea of a preordained, harmonious universe. This illustrates the 18th-century fondness for critiquing such philosophical notions through absurdity.

Answer: H
