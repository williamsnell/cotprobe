Okay, so I've got this math problem here about ABC Publications buying paper and calculating the amount paid with discounts. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with discounts and all that, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says they bought 50 reams of paper at $2.76 each. So first, I think I need to find the total cost before any discounts. Oh right, that's just the number of reams multiplied by the price per ream. So 50 times 2.76. Let me calculate that. 50 times 2 is 100, 50 times 0.76 is 38, so total is 138. So $138 before any discounts.

Next, there's a 50-10% discount. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, I remember that a 50-10% discount is a trade discount where you subtract 10% from the list price, but only if you buy 50 or more. So they bought 50 reams, so they qualify. So the discount is 10% off each ream? Or is it 10% off the total? I think it's 10% off the total. So 10% of $138 is 13.8. So subtracting that, the total becomes 138 minus 13.8, which is $124.20.

Wait, wait. Or is the discount applied per ream? Because the way it's written, "50-10%", sometimes that can mean that if you buy 50, you get 10% off. So the initial total is 50 * 2.76 = $138. Then, the discount is 10% of that. So 10% of 138 is 13.8, so 138 -13.8 = 124.2. So that's correct.

Now, there's an additional 1% discount if payment is made within 10 days. So this is like a cash discount. So we take the amount after the trade discount, which is $124.20, and apply 1% off. So 1% of 124.20 is... let me calculate that. 124.20 times 0.01 is 1.242. So subtracting that, 124.20 - 1.242 = 122.958. Hmm, but wait, money is usually to two decimal places, so that would be $122.96.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $122.96. Let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I applied the discounts in the wrong order. Oh! No, because the cash discount is applied after the trade discount. So first the 10%, then the 1%. So that part seems right.

Wait another thought: when applying multiple discounts, we do them sequentially. So 10% off first, then 1% off the resulting amount. That's correct.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers to make sure.

Total before any discount: 50 * 2.76 = 138. Correct.

10% discount: 138 * 0.10 = 13.8. So new total is 138 -13.8 = 124.2.

Then 1% discount on 124.2: 124.2 * 0.01 = 1.242. So subtract 1.242 from 124.2 to get 122.958, which is 122.96 when rounded.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A:65.55, B:61.48, C:124.20, D:58.34, E:138, F:66.99, G:69, H:62.10, I:72.80, J:131.10.

Wait, none of these match 122.96. So maybe I did something wrong. Hmm, did I misread the discounts?

Oh wait, perhaps the discounts are applied differently. Let me read the problem again.

"A further discount of 1% is given if payment is received within 10 days." So that's a cash discount, so yes, applied after the 10% discount.

Wait, but 50-10% discount is a trade discount, which is 10% off the total. So that part is correct. So 10% of 138 is 13.8, so 138-13.8=124.2. Then 1% of 124.2 is 1.242, so 124.2-1.242=122.958, which is approximately 122.96.

But none of the options match. So maybe I messed up the initial calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the 50-10% discount is applied differently. Oh wait, maybe it's a chain discount, like the 50 is the list price, and 10% off, but perhaps the 50 is the quantity, so the discount is 10% for buying 50. No, that's what I did before.

Wait, maybe the trade discount is applied per item, so 2.76 * 0.90 = 2.484 per ream. Then 50 reams would be 50 *2.484 = 124.2. Then the 1% discount is applied on that. 124.2 *0.99 =122.958, which is 122.96.

But again, no option matches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial total is 50 * 2.76 = $138. Then 10% discount gives $124.20. Then the 1% discount is applied, so 124.20 *0.99. Let me compute that again. 124.20 * 0.99.

Hmm, 124.20 minus 1% is 124.20 - (124.20 *0.01)=124.20-1.242=122.958, which is 122.96. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem. Let me read it again.

"A further discount of 1% is given if payment is received within 10 days from the date of purchase."

Wait, perhaps the discounts are calculated differently. Maybe the 10% discount is a trade discount, and then the 1% is a cash discount on the original amount, not the discounted amount. No, that doesn't make sense because cash discounts are typically applied after trade discounts.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1% is a flat rate, but I don't think so. No, I think the approach is correct.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is 131.10. Oh wait, 138 -10% is 124.2, and 124.2-1% is 122.96, which isn't present. But option J is 131.10. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 50*2.76.

Wait, 50 * 2.76. Let me compute that again. 2.76 *50: 2*50=100, 0.76*50=38. So total is 138. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the 50-10% discount is not a percentage but a chain discount, where 50 is the list price, and 10% is the discount. But that would be the same as what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounts are applied as a series. Wait, maybe the discounts are 50% and 10%, but that can't be because 50-10% is the standard way of representing a trade discount of 10% for 50 items.

Wait, maybe the first discount is 50% off? No, that would make the price way lower. 50 reams at 2.76 each: 50*2.76=138. 50% discount would be 69, then 1% off would be 68.31. But option G is 69, but that's without the 1% discount. So that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the 50-10% is a series discount, meaning 50% and then 10%. No, that doesn't make sense because 50-10% usually means a single discount of 10% when buying 50.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:65.55
B:61.48
C:124.20
D:58.34
E:138.00
F:66.99
G:69.00
H:62.10
I:72.80
J:131.10

Wait, option C is 124.20, which is the amount after the 10% discount but before the 1% cash discount. So if the payment wasn't made within 10 days, they would pay 124.20, but since they did, they get an additional 1% off. So 124.20 *0.99=122.958, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the initial discount is 50%, and then 10%, but that would be 50 reams, 50% discount, then 10%? No, that would be a 55% discount. 138 *0.45 is 62.1, which is option H. Then 1% off that would be 61.389, which is around 61.39, which is close to option B, 61.48. Wait, but that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the 50-10 refers to a 10% discount, so 10% off, so 138-13.8=124.2, then 1% off, which is 122.958. But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the 10% discount is applied as a trade discount, but then the cash discount is applied on the original amount, not the discounted amount. So 138 -13.8=124.2, and then 1% of 138 is 1.38, so 124.2 -1.38=122.82. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the trade discount is applied first, leading to 124.2. Then, perhaps the cash discount isn't applied on the discounted amount but on the original. But that's not standard practice. Cash discounts are usually applied after trade discounts.

Wait, maybe the 1% is a discount on the total after trade discount, so 124.2 *0.99=122.958. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the 50-10% discount is per ream. So each ream's price is reduced by 10%, so 2.76 *0.90=2.484 per ream. Then 50 reams would be 50 *2.484=124.2, same as before. Then 1% discount on 124.2 is 122.958.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the cash discount to be calculated differently. Maybe it's applied after adding tax or something else, but the problem doesn't mention tax.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating 1% of 124.2. Let me compute that again: 124.2 * 0.01 is 1.242. So subtract 1.242 to get 122.958, which is 122.96.

But the options don't have 122.96, so maybe I'm wrong. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the trade discount is 50%, not 10%. Oh wait, 50-10% discount. No, that's 10% discount when buying 50.

Wait, perhaps the 50 is the number of reams, and the 10% is the discount. So 50 reams, 10% off. So 50 *2.76=138, 10% discount is 13.8, so 124.2. Then 1% cash discount: 124.2 *0.99=122.958. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the 1% discount is applied before the 10%? Let me try that. Total is 138. 1% discount first: 138 *0.99=136.62. Then 10% discount: 136.62 *0.90=123.  136.62 -13.662=122.958 again. Same result. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the discounts are 10% and 1%, but compounded. So total discount is 10.1%? Let me calculate that. 138 *0.891=122.958, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to round to the nearest cent after each discount. Let me check: 50*2.76=138. 10% discount: 138 *0.10=13.8. So 138-13.8=124.20 (exact). Then 1% of 124.20 is 1.242, which is $1.24 when rounded to the nearest cent. So 124.20-1.24=122.96. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial purchase price. 50 reams at $2.76 each: 50 *2.76=138. Correct. Then 10% discount gives 124.2, correct.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option J is 131.10. Hmm, 138- (138*0.10)=124.2. 124.2 is option C. Then, applying 1% discount, 124.2*0.99=122.958, which is not an option. So perhaps the question is asking for the amount after only the 10% discount, but that's option C, 124.20. But the question says that the cash discount was taken, so that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the discounts are applied in a different way. Let me consider that the 50-10% is a series discount, where first you take 50% off, then 10% off. So first, 138 *0.50=69. Then 69 *0.90=62.1. Then the 1% discount: 62.1 *0.99=61.449, which rounds to 61.45, which is close to option B, 61.48. Wait, that's interesting. But does 50-10% mean 50% followed by 10%? I thought it was a single 10% discount for buying 50.

Ah, maybe I was wrong about the 50-10% meaning a 10% discount. Perhaps it's two successive discounts: 50% and then 10%. So total discount is 50% +10% - (50%*10%)=55% total discount. So 138*(1 -0.55)=138*0.45=62.1. Then 1% discount: 62.1*0.99=61.449, which is approximately 61.45, which is close to option B, 61.48. But why is 61.48 an option?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 50-10% is a net price after two successive discounts. So first, a 50% discount, then a 10% discount on the reduced price. So 138 *0.50=69. Then 69 *0.90=62.1. Then, 1% discount: 62.1 *0.99=61.449. Rounded to two decimal places, that's $61.45. But the option is B:61.48, which is a bit off. Maybe due to rounding during intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial discounts are applied differently. Let me compute 138 with 50% discount: 138 *0.50=69. Then 10% discount on 69: 69 *0.10=6.9, so 69-6.9=62.1. Then 1% discount on 62.1: 62.1 *0.99=61.449, which is 61.45 when rounded to the nearest cent. But the option is 61.48, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps the problem uses more precise rounding, like banker's rounding.

Wait, 0.449 rounds to 0.45, so 61.45. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but maybe I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let's see, the correct answer after both discounts should be 122.96, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the 50-10% discount is applied differently. Maybe it's a single 10% discount, giving 124.2, and then no further 1% because perhaps the cash discount is optional, but the question says it was taken. So maybe the problem expects the 1% to be applied on the original amount before the trade discount. Let me try that.

138 total. 1% cash discount first: 138 *0.99=136.62. Then 10% trade discount: 136.62 *0.90=123. 136.62 -13.662=122.958, same as before. So 122.96, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement again. Wait, the problem says "a 50-10% discount". Now I'm thinking, perhaps that's a typo, and it's meant to be a 10% discount, and then another 50% discount? No, that's unlikely. Or perhaps 50 reams get a 10% discount, and 50-10 would be two discounts: 50% and 10%. But that doesn't make sense because 50 is the quantity.

Wait, maybe the "50-10%" is a misprint, and it's actually two separate discounts: 5% and 10%, which would make it 13.8 total discount, but that's adding up. No, that's not standard.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 50-10% is a chain discount, where you subtract 10% first, then another 50%. No, that's not usual. Or perhaps it's 50% then 10%. Wait, but that would be 50% off, then 10% off the reduced price. Let me calculate that.

138 *0.50=69. Then 69 *0.90=62.1. Then 1% discount:62.1*0.99=61.449, which is 61.45. Closest option is B:61.48. But I thought 50-10% refers to a single 10% discount, not two discounts. Maybe the question meant 50% and 10% discounts, but that's not standard terminology.

Alternatively, maybe the trade discount is
