Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about executory contracts. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking which statement is least correct regarding these contracts. I remember that executory contracts have to do with the status of performance between the parties involved.

First, I need to understand the definitions of each term. I think an executory contract is one where the parties haven't completed their obligations yet. So, it's still in the process of being performed. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says a fully executory contract is when both parties have completed their performance. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If both have completed, then the contract should be executed, not executory. Because executory means still to be done. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: A partially executed contract means both have begun but not completed. That makes sense. Partially executed implies some performance has started, but not finished.

Option C: An executory contract is when one has performed and the other hasn't started. Wait, if one has performed, doesn't that mean the contract is at least partially executed? Because the other hasn't started, so maybe this is an executory contract? Or maybe it's partially executed. I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: An executed contract exists when both have fully performed. Yes, that's correct. Executed means it's done, so no obligations left.

Option E: Partially executed when at least one has begun. That sounds correct. Because partial means some, not all.

Option F: Partially executory when one has begun and the other has completed. Hmm, if one is done and the other started, is it partially executory? Or maybe partially executed? Because if one party is done, the contract isn't fully executory anymore. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: Fully executed when neither has obligations. That's correct, same as D.

Option H: Partially executed when one has completed and the other only promised. Yes, that seems right. Like, one did their part, the other hasn't started.

Option I: Wholly executory when only promises exchanged. Yes, that's correct. Both haven't done anything yet.

Option J: Executory when both haven't begun. That makes sense. So J is correct.

So the question is which is least correct. Let me go back to the options.

Option A says a fully executory contract is when both have completed. That's wrong because when both are done, it's fully executed, not executory. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Executory when one has performed and the other hasn't started. Wait, if one has performed, then it's at least partially executed. So C is saying it's executory, which would be incorrect. Because if one party has performed, it's not entirely executory anymore.

So both A and C are candidates. Let me think again.

Wait, the definitions:

- Fully executory: both parties have not started performance yet. So J is correct.

- Partially executed: one party has performed, or both have started but not finished.

So for Option C, if one has performed and the other hasn't started, that's partially executed, not executory. So C is incorrect because it's labeling that situation as executory.

Option A is also incorrect because it's confusing fully executed with fully executory.

Wait, the question is which is least correct. So I need to find the wrong statement.

So looking at the options:

A: Fully executory when both completed. No, that's executed, not executory. So A is wrong.

C: Executory when one performed, one hasn't started. That's incorrect because it's partially executed. So C is wrong.

Which option is worse? The question asks which is least correct, so perhaps the most incorrect statement.

Option A mislabels a situation where both have completed as fully executory, which is wrong because that's when it's executed.

So the incorrect options are A and C.

Wait, the question is about executory contracts, which are those where performance is still pending. So options A and C are incorrect.

But looking at the answer choices, I have to pick the least correct one.

Wait, another approach: Let's list what each option says.

- A: Fully executory when both completed. No, that's when the contract is fully executed. So A is wrong.

- B: Partially executed when both have begun but not finished. Correct.

- C: Executory when one has performed and the other hasn't. That would mean the contract is partially executed, so C is incorrect.

- D: Executed when both done. Correct.

- E: Partially executed when at least one has begun. Correct.

- F: Partially executory when one begun, one done. Hmm, if one is done, the contract isn't fully executory. Maybe partially executed. So F is incorrect.

- G: Fully executed when no obligations. Correct.

- H: Partially executed when one done, other only promised. Correct.

- I: Wholly executory when no performance. Correct.

- J: Executory when both haven't begun. Correct.

So the incorrect options are A, C, F.

But the question is which is least correct.

Wait, the question asks for the least correct statement. So the wrongest one.

Option A is wrong because it says fully executory is when both have completed. That's the opposite; it's fully executed.

Option C is wrong because when one has performed, it's not executory anymore; it's partially executed.

Option F says partially executory when one has begun and the other has completed. That seems incorrect because if one has completed, then the other's obligation is either fulfilled or not. So if one has completed, the contract is either executed or the other's obligation remains. So perhaps F is incorrect.

But I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about what each term means.

An executory contract is one where both parties still have obligations to perform. So when both haven't done anything, it's wholly executory. When one has done something, it's partially executed. When both have done everything, it's executed.

So looking at each option:

Option A: Fully executory when both have completed. No, that's when it's executed. So A is wrong.

Option C: Executory when one has performed and the other hasn't. No, that's partially executed. So C is wrong.

Option F: Partially executory when one has begun and the other done. Wait, if one has completed, then the other's obligation may be fulfilled. So perhaps it's no longer executory. So F is incorrect.

So which one is the least correct? The question is which is the least correct.

Looking back, the options:

The question is about executory contracts, which are contracts that are still to be performed. So the incorrect statement would be one that misrepresents what an executory or executed contract is.

Option A is the most glaringly wrong. Because it says a fully executory contract is when both have completed. That's not true. When both have completed, it's a fully executed contract.

So the least correct would be Option A.

Another way: The options which are incorrect are A, C, F.

But the question is about which is the least correct. So which one is the wrongest.

Option A: Fully executory when both done. That's wrong because that's when it's executed, not executory.

Option C: Executory when one done, other not started. That's wrong because it's partially executed.

Option F: Partially executory when one begun, other done. That's wrong because if one is done, the contract is either executed or the other's obligation remains.

Wait, but if one has completed, then perhaps the other's obligation is still pending, so it's partially executed but not fully. So F is saying it's partially executory, which is confusing.

But I think the most incorrect statement is A because it's mixing up fully executory with fully executed.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine the least correct statement regarding executory contracts, it is essential to understand the definitions:

- **Fully Executory Contract**: Both parties have not yet begun performance, and all obligations remain.
- **Partially Executed Contract**: At least one party has started or completed performance, but not all obligations are fulfilled.
- **Fully Executed Contract**: Both parties have completed their obligations, and no further performance is required.

Analyzing each option:

- **Option A**: States that a "fully executory contract is when both parties have completed their performance." This is incorrect because when both parties have completed performance, the contract is **fully executed**, not executory. This misrepresents the term "executory."
  
- **Option B**: A "partially executed contract means that both parties have begun but not completed performance." This is correct, as partial execution implies some performance has occurred but not all.

- **Option C**: An "executory contract is when one party has performed and the other has not yet begun performance." This is incorrect because if one party has performed, the contract is at least **partially executed**, not executory.

- **Option D**: An "executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain." This is correct, as it aligns with the definition of a fully executed contract.

- **Option E**: A "partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance." This is correct, as partial execution can involve one or both parties starting performance.

- **Option F**: A "partially executory contract is when one party has begun performance and the other has completed performance." This is incorrect because if one party has completed performance, the contract is no longer executory; it is at least partially executed.

- **Option G**: A "fully executed contract exists when neither party has any remaining obligations." This is correct, as it matches the definition of a fully executed contract.

- **Option H**: A "partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised." This is correct, as it describes a scenario where performance is partially completed.

- **Option I**: A "wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party." This is correct, as it aligns with the definition of a wholly executory contract.

- **Option J**: An "executory contract is when both parties have yet to begin performance." This is correct, as it matches the definition of a fully executory contract.

Among the incorrect options (A, C, and F), **Option A** is the least correct because it fundamentally confuses the concept of "fully executory" with "fully executed." This misrepresentation makes it the most egregious error.

**Answer: A**
