Okay, so I have this problem about the freezing point of mercury under pressure. Hmm, I remember that pressure can affect the freezing point. Let me think about how.

Wait, mercury is a liquid at room temperature, but when we apply pressure, maybe its freezing point changes. Oh right, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation! That's used for phase transitions under different pressures. The equation is dP/dT = (ΔS)/(ΔV), right?

Wait, but wait. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually written as dP/dT = (ΔH_fus)/(TΔV). Because ΔS is ΔH_fus over T, right? So yeah, I'll go with that form.

So the problem says that the enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fus) is 2.292 kJ/mol. Oh wait, but when mercury melts, the molar volume change is +0.517 cm³/mol. So ΔV is positive because volume increases when it melts. Because when you go from solid to liquid, mercury expands. So that makes sense.

The normal freezing point is 234.3 K. Now, we have a column of mercury that's 10.0 meters high. The pressure at the bottom of this column will be higher than atmospheric pressure. Because the weight of the mercury creates pressure.

So the question is, what's the new freezing point when the pressure is higher? I remember that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation can relate the change in pressure to the change in temperature.

Wait, but I need to find the new temperature where it will freeze under this pressure. Let me think. So if the pressure increases, whether the freezing point increases or decreases depends on the sign of ΔV.

Since ΔV is positive (melting increases volume), then according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation: if dP is positive (pressure increase), then dT would be positive if (ΔH_fus / TΔV) is positive. Wait, let's see.

Wait, the equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus)/(TΔV). Hmm, but I'm trying to find how T changes with P. Maybe I should rearrange it. So dT/dP = (TΔV)/ΔH_fus. Since ΔH is positive (heat is absorbed when melting), and ΔV is positive, dT/dP is positive. So if pressure increases (dP positive), then dT is positive. So the melting point increases.

Wait wait, but the question is about freezing. Oh wait, freezing is the reverse of melting. So if pressure increases, and melting point increases, then the freezing point also increases. So at higher pressures, mercury will freeze at a higher temperature.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation for solid-liquid equilibrium: dP/dT = (ΔH_fus)/(TΔV). So if ΔV is positive (V_liquid > V_solid), then for an increase in pressure (dP positive), dT is positive, so T increases. So melting point increases with pressure. So the substance melts at a higher temperature when pressure is higher. So the freezing point would also be higher, because freezing is the reverse.

Wait, but what if the substance contracts when freezing? No, in this case, when mercury freezes, since the molar volume change upon melting is +0.517 cm³/mol, that means the liquid has higher volume than the solid. So when it freezes, the volume decreases. So the solid is denser. So if pressure is higher, the solid is favored because it's denser. So higher pressure would lower the melting point? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think I got it wrong earlier. Let's think again. When you apply pressure, which direction does the phase transition shift?

In the case where the substance expands upon melting (so V_liq > V_sol), then increasing pressure would favor the solid, because the solid occupies less volume. So the melting point increases. Because you need higher temperatures to overcome the pressure and allow the substance to expand into the liquid phase.

Wait, but let's think about water. Water expands when it freezes. So when you apply pressure, the melting point decreases. Because ice takes up more volume. So in that case, the equation gives us that dP/dT is negative because ΔV is negative (since V_liq < V_sol for water). So for water, increasing pressure would cause the melting point to decrease.

So back to mercury. Mercury expands upon melting. So V_liq > V_sol. So ΔV is positive. So dP/dT is positive (ΔH_fus is positive). So if the pressure increases, the temperature at which melting occurs (the melting point) increases. So the normal freezing point is 234.3 K. At higher pressures, the freezing point would be higher.

But wait, the question is about the bottom of a column of mercury. So the pressure there is higher than atmospheric. So the freezing point of mercury at that higher pressure will be higher than 234.3 K. So the mercury should freeze at a higher temperature than normal.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the mercury column. So the pressure due to the column of mercury. How do I calculate that?

The pressure P is equal to density (rho) times gravity (g) times height (h). So P = rho * g * h.

Wait, the density is 13.6 g/cm³. Let me convert that to kg/m³. Because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 13.6 g/cm³ is 13.6 * 1000 kg/m³ = 13600 kg/m³.

Gravity is 9.81 m/s².

Height is 10.0 meters.

So P = 13600 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² *10 m.

Wait, let's compute that.

13600 * 9.81 = let's see. 13600 * 10 is 136000, minus 13600 * 0.19.

Wait, 13600 * 0.19 = approx 2584. So 136000 - 2584 = 133416. Then multiply by 10 m?

Wait, no, the equation is P = rho * g * h. So 13600 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 10 m.

So 13600 * 9.81 = let's compute.

Compute 13600 * 9 = 122400.

13600 * 0.81 = let's see, 13600 * 0.8 = 10880, 13600 * 0.01=136. So 10880+136=11016.

So 122400 + 11016 = 133416 (in units of kg/(m² s²) ), which is Pascals, since Pa = kg/(m s²). So 133416 Pa.

Wait, but 1 bar is about 10^5 Pa. So this is about 1.3 * 10^5 Pa. Hmm, but for the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, I might need to convert pressure into the same units as the equation expects. Or the equation can handle it as long as the units are consistent.

Wait, the equation I'm using is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / (T ΔV). But wait, I think the form I should use is the integrated Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_fus/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (assuming ΔH doesn't change with T and P).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to approximate using a linear form, since the pressure change isn't too large. So, dT = (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) dP.

But wait, the units must be compatible. Let's see. Let me check the units.

ΔV is given in cm³/mol, but I need it in m³. 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 0.517 cm³/mol is 0.517e-6 m³/mol.

ΔH_fus is 2292 kJ/mol, which is 2292e3 J/mol.

T is in Kelvin, which is the same as the normal freezing point, 234.3 K.

dP is in Pascals (Pa), which is N/m² = kg/(m s²).

So, putting it all together:

dT = (T * ΔV * dP) / ΔH_fus.

Wait, because dT = (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) * dP.

Wait, yes, because dT/dP = (T ΔV) / (ΔH_fus).

So dT = (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) * dP.

But wait, because pressure increases, and as per earlier, for mercury, the freezing point increases. So dT is positive.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

T is 234.3 K.

ΔV is 0.517e-6 m³/mol.

ΔH_fus is 2292e3 J/mol.

dP is 133416 Pa.

So compute (T * ΔV) / ΔH_fus.

So numerator: 234.3 K * 0.517e-6 m³/mol = let's compute that.

234.3 * 0.517e-6 = 234.3 * 5.17e-7.

Compute 234 * 5e-7 = 1.17e-4.

0.3 *5.17e-7 = 1.551e-7.

So total is approx 1.17e-4 + 1.55e-7 = about 1.1755e-4.

Wait, more accurately:

0.517 * 234.3 = let's compute 500 * 234.3 = 117150, but wait, no, 0.517 is 517e-3.

So 234.3 * 0.517 = let's compute step by step.

234 * 0.5 = 117.

234 * 0.017 = approx 3.978.

So 117 +3.978= 120.978. Then 0.3 *0.517=0.1551. So total is 120.978 +0.1551= 121.1331. So 121.1331e-3 K·m³/mol.

Wait, wait, 234.3 K * 0.517e-6 m³/mol = 234.3 * 0.517 * 1e-6 = (let me compute 234.3 * 0.517) *1e-6.

234.3 *0.5 = 117.15, 234.3 * 0.017 = 3.98, so total 117.15+3.98=121.13.

So 121.13e-6 K m³/mol.

Then divide by ΔH_fus: 2292e3 J/mol.

2292e3 J is 2292,000 J.

So (121.13e-6 K m³/mol) / (2292e3 J/mol) ) = (121.13e-6 / 2292e3) K·m³/(J).

Wait, J is kg m²/s², and m³ is 1e-3 m in each dimension, so m³ is (1e-3)^3 = 1e-9 m³= 1 liter? Wait, no, but the units here: m³/(J) would be m³/(kg m²/s²) )= s²/(kg).

Wait, perhaps better to just compute the numerical value.

So 121.13e-6 = 1.2113e-4.

2292e3 = 2.292e6.

So 1.2113e-4 / 2.292e6 = approximately (1.2e-4)/(2.3e6)= (1.2/2.3) * 1e-10 = approx 0.5217 * 1e-10 = 5.217e-11.

So 5.217e-11 (K·s²)/(kg) )

Wait, but dP is 133416 Pa, which is 133416 kg/(m s²).

So dT = (5.217e-11) * 133416.

Compute that: 5.217e-11 * 1.3e5 = 5.217 *1.3 * 1e-6.

5.217 *1.3 = approx 6.7821.

So 6.7821e-6 K.

So dT is approximately 6.78e-6 K, which is about 0.00000678 K. So that's a very small change.

Wait, but wait a minute—did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, the initial dT calculation was giving me about 6.78e-6 K. But the options are on the scale of tenths of a Kelvin. So this can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the form:

ΔT = (T * ΔV * ΔP) / (ΔH_fus).

Wait, maybe I should be using the approximation:

(T2 - T1) ≈ (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) * (P2 - P1)

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but let's recalculate the numbers more carefully.

Compute T ΔV: 234.3 K * 0.517e-6 m³/mol.

0.517e-6 m³ = 5.17e-7 m³.

234.3 * 5.17e-7 = let's compute 234 *5.17e-7.

234 *5e-7 = 1.17e-4.

234 *0.17e-7 = 39.78e-7 = 3.978e-5.

Wait, no, wait: 5.17e-7 is 5e-7 + 0.17e-7.

So 234 *5e-7 = 234 * 5 * 1e-7 = 1170 * 1e-7 = 1.17e-4.

234 * 0.17e-7 = 234 * 1.7e-8 = let's compute that.

234 * 1.7 = 397.8 → 397.8e-8 = 3.978e-6.

So total TΔV = 1.17e-4 + 3.978e-6 = 1.17e-4 + 0.003978e-4 → (1.17 + 0.003978)e-4 = 1.173978e-4 K·m³/mol.

Now, ΔH_fus is 2292e3 J/mol = 2.292e6 J/mol.

So TΔV / ΔH_fus = (1.173978e-4) / (2.292e6) = approx 5.128e-11 K·m³/(J).

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so m³·J = m^5·kg/s². Hmm, perhaps the units are getting too complicated.

But in any case, the factor is 5.128e-11 K per (Pa) because dP is in Pa. So when you multiply by the pressure change in Pa, you get dT in K.

So dP is 133416 Pa.

So dT = 5.128e-11 * 133416.

Compute 5.128e-11 * 1.33416e5.

Multiply 5.128 by 1.33416 = approx 6.84.

Then, 1e-11 * 1e5 = 1e-6.

So 6.84e-6 K → 0.00000684 K.

Wait, that's about 6.84e-6 K, which is 0.00000684. So the temperature change is about 0.00000684 K. That's minuscule, so the freezing point would change by that tiny amount. But the answer options are in tenths of a degree, not millionths. So this can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the pressure. Let me recalculate P.

P = rho * g * h.

rho is 13.6 g/cm³ = 13.6 * 1000 kg/m³ = 13600 kg/m³.

g is 9.81 m/s².

h is 10 m.

So P = 13600 * 9.81 * 10.

Compute 13600 * 9.81 first.

13600 * 9 = 122400.

13600 * 0.81 = 13600 * 0.8 = 10880, 13600*0.01=136. So 10880 +136=11016.

Total: 122400 + 11016 = 133416 Pa. So that part was correct.

So back to dT = (T ΔV / ΔH) * dP.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me write the formula correctly.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / (T ΔV).

So dT = (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) * dP.

Wait, but another approach is to use the equation:

ln(T2/T1) = (ΔV/ΔH) (P2 - P1) 

But that's the integrated form assuming ΔH and ΔV are constant. But this might not be as accurate for small changes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation:

ΔT = (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) * ΔP.

But that's what I did, and it gave me a negligible change.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the molar volume change is per mole, but perhaps I need to find the volume change per kilogram or something. Wait, no, because all the quantities are molar, so it should be fine.

Wait, the units for ΔV are cm³/mol, which I converted to m³/mol correctly.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of (T ΔV) / ΔH_fus.

T = 234.3 K.

ΔV = 0.517e-6 m³/mol (since 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³).

So T ΔV = 234.3 * 0.517e-6 = let's compute that.

234.3 * 0.517 = let me compute 234 * 0.5 = 117, 234 *
