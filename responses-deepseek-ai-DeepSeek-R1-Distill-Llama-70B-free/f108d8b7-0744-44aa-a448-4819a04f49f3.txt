Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about strong electrolytes. Hmm, I remember that electrolytes are substances that can conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Strong electrolytes are those that completely dissociate into ions in solution.

The question gives me several options, from A to I. I need to figure out which one is a strong electrolyte.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: CH3COOH. That's acetic acid. I think acetic acid is a weak electrolyte because it doesn't completely ionize in water. It only partially dissociates, right? So it's not a strong one.

Option B: CO2. Carbon dioxide. I recall that CO2 doesn't dissolve well in water and doesn't ionize. So it's probably a non-electrolyte. Not the answer.

Option C: O2. Oxygen gas. It's not an electrolyte at all. Doesn't dissociate, so no.

Option D: H2O. Water. Hmm, water is a polar molecule but it's a very weak electrolyte. It autoionizes a little, but not enough to be considered a strong electrolyte. So D isn't the right choice.

Option E: NH3. Ammonia. It dissolves in water and reacts a bit to form NH4+ and OH- ions, but it's a weak base, so it's a weak electrolyte. Not strong.

Option F: CH4. Methane. It's a covalent gas; doesn't dissolve much or ionize. So no electrolyte properties here.

Option G: HC2H3O2. Wait, that's the formula for acetic acid as well, right? Oh wait, no. Wait, HC2H3O2 is acetic acid. Oh wait, same as option A. So same reasoning appliesâ€”it's a weak acid, so weak electrolyte.

Option H: HBr. Hydrobromic acid. Oh, I remember that HBr is a strong acid. Strong acids like HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, H2SO4, HClO4 completely dissociate in water. So HBr should be a strong electrolyte. This seems like a possible correct answer.

Option I: C6H12O6. That's glucose. Glucose is a nonelectrolyte because it doesn't ionize in water. So no.

Wait, let me double-check the options. So the strong electrolytes are typically strong acids, strong bases, and salts. So HBr is a strong acid, so when it dissolves in water, it should dissociate completely into H+ and Br- ions. So HBr is a strong electrolyte.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine which molecule is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water, we analyze each option:

- **A: CH3COOH (acetic acid)**: This is a weak acid that partially dissociates in water, making it a weak electrolyte.  
- **B: CO2 (carbon dioxide)**: CO2 does not significantly ionize in water and is not an electrolyte.  
- **C: O2 (oxygen gas)**: O2 does not dissociate in water and is not an electrolyte.  
- **D: H2O (water)**: Water is a very weak electrolyte due to its slight autoionization, but it is not a strong electrolyte.  
- **E: NH3 (ammonia)**: NH3 reacts with water to form a small amount of ions, but it is a weak base and thus a weak electrolyte.  
- **F: CH4 (methane)**: CH4 does not ionize in water and is not an electrolyte.  
- **G: HC2H3O2 (acetic acid)**: This is the same as option A, a weak acid and weak electrolyte.  
- **H: HBr (hydrobromic acid)**: HBr is a strong acid that completely dissociates into H+ and Br- ions in water, making it a strong electrolyte.  
- **I: C6H12O6 (glucose)**: Glucose does not ionize in water and is not an electrolyte.  

The only molecule that is a strong electrolyte is **HBr (option H)**, as it completely dissociates in water.  

Answer: H
