Okay, let's try to figure out this psychology ethics question. So the scenario is that a psychologist gets a call on Friday afternoon from a client who says they've taken an overdose of pills in a suicide attempt. The psychologist tells the client to call a physician immediately and come in Monday for a session. The psychologist doesn't do anything else, and the client dies that evening without seeking further help.

Hmm, I remember that psychologists have a duty to protect their clients, especially in emergencies. I think this relates to the concept of duty to protect or duty to warn. Wait, the Tarasoff rule comes into play here, right? That's when a therapist has to take steps to protect someone if the client is an imminent danger to themselves or others.

So in this case, the client is clearly at risk of self-harm. The psychologist's response was to tell the client to call a physician and come in on Monday. But the client died before Monday. So the psychologist didn't take immediate action.

I think the ethical guidelines require the psychologist to ensure the client's safety. That might mean contacting emergency services, calling a hospital, or making sure the client is with someone who can help. Just telling the client to call a doctor might not be enough, especially if the client is in a state where they might not follow through.

Looking at the options, option D says it's unethical because the psychologist didn't take necessary steps to ensure safety. That sounds right. Other options: Option A says the psychologist should have made sure the client wasn't alone. That's part of ensuring safety, but D is broader.

Option E suggests the psychologist should have called a physician directly. That could be part of the necessary steps, but maybe the key is that the psychologist didn't take any action beyond advising the client.

Option G says the psychologist should have called emergency services immediately. That's another possible step, but I'm not sure if that's the only thing. The main issue is that the psychologist didn't do enough to ensure the client's safety, not just whether they called 911.

So the correct answer is probably D. Other options either don't go far enough or misstate the issue.

The psychologist's behavior was clearly unethical because they failed to take necessary steps to ensure the client's safety after the client expressed an imminent risk of self-harm. Ethical guidelines require immediate action in such emergencies, such as contacting emergency services or ensuring the client receives prompt help. Simply advising the client to call a physician and scheduling a future appointment was insufficient. 

Answer: D
