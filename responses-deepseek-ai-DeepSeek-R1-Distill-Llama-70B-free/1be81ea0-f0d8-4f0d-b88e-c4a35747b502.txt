Okay, so I need to find the final speed of an electron accelerated through a potential difference of 100 kV. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is accelerated through a potential difference, it gains kinetic energy. Since the electron starts from rest, all the energy it gains is kinetic. 

The potential difference is 100 kV, which is 100,000 volts. The charge of an electron is e, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So the kinetic energy (KE) gained by the electron should be e times delta phi. 

Wait, the question says the energy is eΔφ, which makes sense because KE = e * Δφ. So KE = (1.602e-19 C) * (1e5 V). Oh wait, volts are joules per coulomb, so multiplying by e gives joules. Let me calculate that: 1.602e-19 * 1e5 = 1.602e-14 J. So KE is 1.602e-14 J.

Now, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². The mass of an electron is 9.109e-31 kg. So I can set up the equation:

(1/2)mv² = 1.602e-14 J

I need to solve for v. Let's rearrange the equation:

v = sqrt( (2 * KE) / m )

Plugging in the numbers:

KE is 1.602e-14 J, so 2*KE is 3.204e-14 J.

Divide that by the mass of the electron, 9.109e-31 kg:

(3.204e-14) / (9.109e-31) = let's compute that. 

3.204e-14 divided by 9.109e-31 is approximately (3.204 / 9.109) * 1e17. 3.204 /9.109 is about 0.3516. So 0.3516e17, which is 3.516e16.

Wait wait, no, wait. Let me compute 3.204e-14 / 9.109e-31. Let's write it as (3.204 / 9.109) * 1e(-14 - (-31)) )= (0.3516) * 1e17 = 3.516e16 m²/s².

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(3.516e16) m/s.

The square root of 3.516e16 is sqrt(3.516) * 1e8. Because sqrt(1e16) is 1e8.

What's sqrt(3.516)? Let's see. 1.87 squared is 3.4969, and 1.88 squared is about 3.5344. So sqrt(3.516) is approximately between 1.875 and 1.88. Let's calculate 1.875^2: 3.5156. Oh wait, that's almost exactly 3.5156. So 1.875^2 is about 3.5156, so our value is 3.516e16, so the square root is approximately 1.875e8 m/s.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Because 1.875^2 is (1.8^2) + ... Let me compute 1.875 * 1.875.

1.8 * 1.8 is 3.24. 0.075 * 1.8 is 0.135, and 0.075 *0.075 is 0.005625. So adding up: 3.24 + 0.135 + 0.135 + 0.005625? Wait, no, maybe a better approach is to compute 1.875^2.

(1.875)^2: 1.8^2 = 3.24. 2*(1.8)*(0.075) = 2*0.135 = 0.27. (0.075)^2 = 0.005625. So total is 3.24 + 0.27 + 0.005625 = 3.515625. So yes, exactly. So 1.875^2 is 3.515625, which is very close to our 3.516. So the square root is approximately 1.875e8 m/s. 

Wait, but wait. Because our number was 3.516e16, the square root is 1.875e8 m/s. So that's 1.875 x 10^8 m/s. Looking at the options, option H is 1.88e8, which is about 1.88. So that's very close. But wait, let me check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate (2*K)/m more accurately.

K is 1.602e-14 J. So 2*K is 3.204e-14 J.

m is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So 3.204e-14 / 9.10938356e-31 = let's compute that.

First, 3.204 / 9.10938356 ≈ 0.3516.

Then, 1e-14 / 1e-31 is 1e17.

So 0.3516 * 1e17 = 3.516e16.

Wait, so the velocity squared is 3.516e16, so velocity is sqrt(3.516e16) m/s.

Which is sqrt(3.516) * 1e8. Let me compute sqrt(3.516) more accurately.

I know that 1.87^2 is 3.4969, 1.88^2 is 3.5344.

So 3.516 is between 1.87 and 1.88. Let's compute the exact value.

3.516 - 3.4969 = 0.0191.

The difference between 3.5344 and 3.4969 is approximately 0.0375. So 0.0191/0.0375 ≈ 0.51. So the square root is approximately 1.87 + 0.51*(0.01) = 1.87 + 0.0051 = 1.8751.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The difference between 1.87^2 (3.4969) and 1.88^2 (3.5344) is 0.0375. Our target is 3.516, which is 0.0191 above 3.4969. So the fraction is 0.0191 / 0.0375 ≈ 0.51. So 1.87 + 0.51*(0.01) ? No, wait, 0.01 is the difference between 1.87 and 1.88 (which is 0.01 in the x-axis, but the y-axis difference is 0.0375). So the linear approximation would give x ≈ 1.87 + (0.51)*(0.01) )= 1.8751. So sqrt(3.516) ≈ 1.8751.

So velocity is approximately 1.875e8 m/s, which is 1.875 x 10^8 m/s. Looking at the options, option H is 1.88e8, which is 1.88 x 1e8, so 1.88e8 m/s. That's very close.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me do a better approximation.

Let me compute (1.875)^2 = 3.515625, as before. The difference between 3.516 and 3.515625 is 0.000375. So how much more than 1.875 do we need to add?

Let’s take x = 1.875 + δ. Then x² = (1.875)² + 2*(1.875)*δ + δ² ≈ 3.515625 + 3.75 δ (since δ is small, δ² is negligible).

We set x² = 3.516.

So 3.515625 + 3.75 δ = 3.516 → 3.75 δ = 3.516 -3.515625=0.000375 → δ = 0.000375 / 3.75 = 0.0001.

So x = 1.875 + 0.0001 = 1.8751. So v ≈ 1.8751e8 m/s. That's 1.8751 x 10^8 m/s, which is approximately 1.88e8 m/s when rounded to three significant figures. Wait, 1.8751e8 is 1.8751 x 1e8, which is 187,510,000 m/s. So when rounded to three sig figs, it's 1.88e8 m/s, which matches option H.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for any possible mistakes. Did I correctly compute the kinetic energy? Let's see.

Δφ is 100 kV, which is 1e5 volts. KE is e * Δφ = (1.6e-19 C) * (1e5 V) = 1.6e-14 J. So yes.

Then, (1/2)mv² = 1.6e-14 J → v² = (2 * 1.6e-14) / (9.109e-31) → 3.2e-14 / 9.109e-31 = (3.2 /9.109 )e17 → approximately 0.351e17 → 3.51e16. So v is sqrt(3.51e16) ≈ 1.875e8 m/s.

So the closest option is H: 1.88e8 m/s.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps using relativistic effects? Because electrons at high speeds (like a significant fraction of light speed) might require considering special relativity. Hmm, but the potential is 100 kV. Let me think about the speed.

Wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. 1.88e8 is about 0.627c, which is 62.7% the speed of light. At such speeds, relativistic effects become significant. So does the non-relativistic calculation still hold, or should I use the relativistic kinetic energy?

Oh, right! Because when dealing with such high speeds, the non-relativistic kinetic energy (KE = ½ mv²) isn't accurate anymore. So perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The question states that the electron acquires an energy of eΔφ, which I think refers to the kinetic energy in the non-relativistic sense. Or does it? Hmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous. But in the context of electron microscopes, they usually operate with electrons at high speeds, so relativistic effects can't be ignored. So maybe I should have used the relativistic equation.

Oh no, this could change the answer. Let me think again.

The relativistic kinetic energy is given by KE = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the kinetic energy here is eΔφ = 1e5 eV. Wait, wait, 100 kV is 100,000 volts, so the energy is 100 keV. The electron's rest mass is about 511 keV, so 100 keV is about 20% of the rest mass energy. So relativistic effects are indeed significant, but perhaps not dominant. But to calculate accurately, I should use the relativistic formula.

So let me proceed with the relativistic approach.

We have:

eΔφ = (γ - 1) mc²

We can rearrange this to find γ:

γ = 1 + (eΔφ)/(mc²)

Compute each term:

eΔφ = (1.602e-19 C)(1e5 V) = 1.602e-14 J.

mc² for an electron is (9.109e-31 kg)(3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.109e-31 *9e16 = 8.198e-14 J. Wait, let me compute that accurately.

mc² = 9.10938356e-31 kg * (2.99792e8 m/s)^2.

(2.99792e8)^2 = approx (3e8)^2 = 9e16, but more precisely, (2.99792e8)^2 = (approx) 8.9875e16 m²/s².

So mc² = 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.9875e16 m²/s² = let's compute this:

9.10938356e-31 * 8.9875e16 = (9.10938356 * 8.9875) * 1e(-31+16) ) = approximately, 9 *9=81, but let me calculate exact.

9.10938356 * 8.9875 ≈ let's compute:

9 *8.9875 =80.8875

0.10938 *8.9875≈≈ 0.9828.

So total approximately 80.8875 + 0.9828 =81.8703.

So mc² ≈81.8703e-15 J → which is 8.18703e-14 J.

So mc² ≈ 8.187e-14 J.

So eΔφ =1.602e-14 J.

So γ =1 + (1.602e-14)/(8.187e-14) = 1 + (0.1956) = 1.1956.

Now, γ = 1.1956.

We need to find v. So γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Let me take reciprocal: 1/γ = sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Square both sides: 1/γ² = 1 - v²/c² → v²/c² = 1 -1/γ² → v = c * sqrt(1 -1/γ² )

Compute 1/γ²: (1/1.1956)^2 ≈ (0.8367)^2 ≈ 0.7005.

So 1 - 0.7005 = 0.2995. So sqrt(0.2995) ≈ 0.5473.

So v = 0.5473 * c ≈ 0.5473 * 3e8 m/s = approx 1.6419e8 m/s.

Wait, that's about 1.64e8 m/s. But looking at the options, none of them are exactly close to that. Wait, what did I calculate earlier non-relativistically? 1.88e8 m/s. But relativistically, it's about 1.64e8 m/s. So which approach is correct?

Wait, but wait, the question says the electron "acquires an energy of eΔφ." So if it's using the non-relativistic kinetic energy, then the speed would be higher. But if it's using relativistic, it's lower. So the problem statement is ambiguous.

Wait, looking back at the question: "acquires an energy of eΔφ". So the energy is eΔφ, which is the kinetic energy in the non-relativistic case. But in reality, when speeds are relativistic, the kinetic energy is higher than (1/2 mv²). So in this case, using the non-relativistic approach would give a higher speed than the actual speed.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "acquires an energy of eΔφ", which I think refers to the kinetic energy being equal to eΔφ. So if we use non-relativistic, KE = (1/2) mv² = eΔφ. So that would give the speed as 1.88e8 m/s, which is option H.

But in reality, for an electron accelerated through 100 kV, the speed is lower because a part of the energy goes into the relativistic increase of mass. So perhaps the correct approach is relativistic. But the question may not require that, expecting the non-relativistic solution.

Hmm, looking at the answer options, option H is 1.88e8 m/s, which is the non-relativistic result. But if I use the relativistic, I get around 1.64e8 m/s, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the question expects the non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the relativistic approach.

Wait, let me recheck the relativistic calculation.

eΔφ = 1e5 V * e = 1e5 * 1.6e-19 C*V = 1.6e-14 J.

mc² = 8.187e-14 J.

So (eΔφ)/(mc²) = (1.6e-14)/(8.187e-14) ≈ 0.1956.

So γ = 1 + 0.1956 = 1.1956.

So 1/γ² is 1/(1.1956)^2 = 1/(1.43) ≈ 0.6993.

So 1 - 0.6993 = 0.3007.

sqrt(0.3007) ≈ 0.5486.

c is 3e8 m/s.

v = 0.5486 * 3e8 = approx 1.6458e8 m/s.

So about 1.65e8 m/s. But none of the options are close to that except maybe option D, which is 1.95e8, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the kinetic energy is (γ-1) mc².

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't consider relativity and expects the classical solution, which gives 1.88e8 m/s, option H.

Given the options, I think the intended approach is non-relativistic because option H is present and is the result of that calculation.

So the answer is H: 1.88e8 m/s.

To determine the final speed of an electron accelerated through a potential difference of $\Delta \phi = 100 \, \mathrm{kV}$, we start by noting that the electron gains kinetic energy equal to $e \Delta \phi$. The charge of an electron is $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}$, and the potential difference is $\Delta \phi = 1 \times 10^5
