Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about an air compressor. Hmm, let's see. The question gives some specific details about the air being compressed and then asks for the amount of heat transferred. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to understand the problem. The air compressor takes in air at a certain condition and compresses it. The data given includes the specific volume at intake and discharge, the pressures, and some values related to internal energy and work done. Oh right, I remember from my classes that this probably involves the first law of thermodynamics, which relates work, heat, and internal energy change.

Let me write down the given data to get it clear:

- Intake (inlet) conditions: specific volume v1 = 2 ft³/lb, pressure P1 = 15 psia.
- Discharge conditions: specific volume v2 = 0.5 ft³/lb, pressure P2 = 110 psia.
- Increase in internal energy (Δu) = 40 Btu/lb.
- Work done (w) = 70 Btu/lb.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. I need to make sure about the sign conventions here. In thermodynamics, the first law is usually written as Δu = q - w, where q is the heat added to the system and w is the work done by the system. But sometimes, different textbooks or sources might use different sign conventions. So I need to be careful here.

Alternatively, another version is Δu = q + w, where w is the work done on the system (like in some engineering contexts where work done by the system is negative). Oh, this is confusing. Let me think. Oh right, the first law can be written as:

Δu = q + w, where w is the work done on the system.

Or sometimes, Δu = q - w, where w is the work done by the system. So I need to clarify which convention is being used here.

Wait, the question says the work done is 70 Btu/lb. Does that mean work done by the system (the compressor) or done on the system? Hmm. In the context of a compressor, work is done on the system (the compressor compresses the air, so it's receiving work from the outside). So in that case, the work would be positive.

Wait, but in the first law equation, if work done by the system is considered positive, then when the system receives work (like compression), the work is negative. Or wait, no, wait: the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the compressor is doing work on the gas (compression), that would mean work is done on the system, so W (work done by system) is negative. So in that case, W would be negative.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula. Let me get this straight.

The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system is:

ΔU = Q - W

Where:
- ΔU is the change in internal energy (given as 40 Btu/lb here)
- Q is the heat added to the system
- W is the work done by the system.

In this case, the compressor is doing work on the gas, so the gas is having work done on it. That would mean that the system (the gas) is receiving work, so W (work done by the system) would be negative.

Wait, but the question says the work done is 70 Btu/lb. So the value of W (work done by the system) would be negative, since the system isn't doing the work but having it done upon it.

Wait, no. Alternatively, sometimes in engineering contexts, the work done on the system is taken as positive. So perhaps the equation is written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system.

I think I might need to clarify this because getting the sign wrong will mess up the entire calculation. Let's try to think about it. Let's say the system is the gas being compressed. The compressor does work on the gas, so the work is done on the system. So in the first law, if W is the work done on the system, then W is positive.

So the equation would be:

ΔU = Q + W

Wait, no, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the system is the gas, and someone is doing work on it (compressor), then W (work done by the gas) would be negative because the gas is not doing work but rather work is being done on it.

Alternatively, if we define W as the work done on the system, then the equation would be ΔU = Q - (-W) = Q + W.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think of it this way: in the equation ΔU = Q - W, W is the work done by the system. So, in this case, the system (gas) is being compressed, so the work is done on the system, meaning that the system does negative work. So W (work done by system) is negative, and therefore, the equation becomes ΔU = Q - (-W_on) = Q + W_on, where W_on is the work done on the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is giving the work done on the system as positive. So the question says the work done is 70 Btu/lb. If we take that as the work done on the system (W_on = 70), then we can plug into the equation.

Wait, but the question says, "the work done is 70 Btu/lb." Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear, but in the context of a compressor, the compressor does work on the gas, so the work is done on the system. So W (work done by the system) would be negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the compressor's perspective, where it does work on the gas, so the work is positive. I'm a bit confused here, so perhaps I should proceed carefully.

Let me try both approaches to see which one makes sense.

Approach 1: Using ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system.

In this case, the work done by the system (gas) is negative because work is done on the gas.

So W = -70 Btu/lb (because the system isn't doing work, work is being done on it).

Then, the equation would be:

ΔU = Q - W

We know ΔU = 40, W = -70.

So,

40 = Q - (-70)
40 = Q +70
Q = 40 -70 = -30 Btu/lb.

Wait, that's one possibility. But let me check another approach.

Approach 2: Using ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system.

In this case, W is positive because work is done on the system (the gas).

So,

ΔU = Q + W
40 = Q +70
Q = 40 -70 = -30 Btu/lb.

Same result as approach 1. So regardless of the convention, the heat Q comes out to be -30 Btu/lb.

But wait, let me make sure. Because in approach 1, W was -70, so the calculation was Q = 40 - (-70) = 110? No wait, no.

Wait, no. Let me redo approach 1.

Wait, approach 1: ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system.

Given that work is done on the system, W (by system) is negative 70.

So,

40 = Q - (-70)
40 = Q +70
Q = 40 -70 = -30.

Yes, same as approach 2.

So either way, Q is -30 Btu/lb.

But wait, the options don't have -30. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:10

B:-15.37

C:-35.37

D:20.37

E:-20.37

F:-30.37

G:30.37

H:-40.37

I:-25.37

J:25.37

Hmm, option F is -30.37, which is close to -30, but not exactly. So perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I missed something in the problem. Let me read again.

Wait, the problem says the increase in internal energy is 40 Btu/lb. So Δu is 40.

The work done is 70 Btu/lb. So according to approach, Q would be -30, but that's not exactly an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires considering the enthalpy change or something else. Because the data given includes specific volumes and pressures. So maybe I should calculate the work using P-V diagrams or something else?

Wait, perhaps the 70 Btu/lb is the work done by the compressor, but in the system's perspective, the work done on the gas is 70, so perhaps I should use that in the first law equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done is calculated using the area under the P-V curve, which for an ideal compressor might involve using specific volumes and pressures.

Wait, the problem gives v1 and v2, maybe we can compute the work using the integral of P dv, but I don't know P2 and v2. Wait, no, the process is compression from state 1 to state 2. But without knowing the process path (like is it isentropic or polytropic), maybe the data given is all we have.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the work done is the flow work or something else. Hmm, perhaps I should use the steady flow energy equation instead of the closed system first law.

Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says it's an air compressor. So it's a steady flow device, right? So the first law for a control volume (steady flow process) would be appropriate.

In that case, the first law is:

q + h1 + (V1²)/2 + gz1 = h2 + (V2²)/2 + gz2 + w

But assuming that kinetic and potential energy changes are negligible (since the problem doesn't mention velocities or heights), the equation simplifies to:

q + h1 = h2 + w

Wait, but wait. In a compressor, work is done on the system, so in the steady flow equation, the work would be negative if it's work done by the system. Or wait, the sign conventions can be tricky.

Wait, the standard steady flow equation is:

Q - W = (h2 + (V2²)/2 + g z2) - (h1 + (V1²)/2 + g z1) + (PE_in - PE_out) )

But maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the change in enthalpy (h2 - h1) equals the heat added plus the work done on the system per unit mass.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of specific variables. The first law for a control volume in steady flow is:

Δh + Δ(KE) + Δ(PE) = q + w

Where w is the work done on the system per unit mass.

But since KE and PE changes are negligible, it simplifies to:

h2 - h1 = q + w

But wait, in the case of a compressor, the work is done on the system, so w would be positive. So if the work done by the compressor is 70 Btu/lb, then in the equation, it's positive.

Wait, but the problem says the work done is 70 Btu/lb. So, if we take that as the work done on the system (the gas), then w is positive 70.

So, h2 - h1 = q + w

But wait, I don't have h2 and h1 values. The problem gives internal energy change, not enthalpy.

But I know that enthalpy h = u + Pv. So, the change in enthalpy Δh = Δu + Δ(Pv).

Hmm, because h2 - h1 = (u2 + P2 v2) - (u1 + P1 v1) ) = (u2 - u1) + P2 v2 - P1 v1.

So, Δh = Δu + (P2 v2 - P1 v1).

Wait, let me compute that.

Given:

Δu = 40 Btu/lb.

P1 = 15 psia, v1 = 2 ft³/lb.

P2 = 110 psia, v2 = 0.5 ft³/lb.

So,

P2 v2 = 110 * 0.5 = 55 ft³·psia/lb.

P1 v1 = 15 * 2 = 30 ft³·psia/lb.

So,

Δh = 40 + (55 - 30) = 40 + 25 = 65 Btu/lb.

Wait, so Δh is 65.

Now, back to the first law equation for the control volume:

Δh = q + w.

We have Δh =65, w=70.

So,

65 = q +70

So,

q =65 -70 = -5 Btu/lb.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I got the sign of w wrong. Let me think again. In the steady flow equation, the work done on the system is positive. But in the problem, is the work done 70 Btu/lb done on the system or by the system?

Wait, the question says "the work done is 70 Btu/lb." In a compressor, work is done on the system (the gas), so w is positive.

So, the equation Δh = q + w would give q = Δh - w = 65 -70 = -5.

But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm wrong somewhere.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the work given is actually the work done by the system, so in that case, w would be negative.

Wait, if the work done is 70 Btu/lb, and if that's the work done by the system (unlikely, since compressor does work on the gas), then w would be -70.

So,

Δh = q + w => 65 = q + (-70) => q =65 +70=135. That's not any of the options either.

Hmm, perhaps I should instead use the internal energy approach, considering it's a closed system, but I thought compressors are control volumes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a closed system, but that's unlikely because compressors typically involve flow.

Wait, but the question gives specific volumes, which are volume per unit mass, so maybe it's a steady flow process.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the first law in the form Δu = q + w, where w is the work done on the system.

So, given:

Δu =40 = q +70.

So, q=40-70= -30.

Which would be option F: -30.37. Hmm, but that's not exactly -30. So why the 0.37?

Wait, perhaps I need to be more precise. Maybe the units involve converting from ft³·psi to Btu. Because in my earlier calculation, I considered P2 v2 and P1 v1 as 55 and 30, but perhaps I should convert units to get the correct value.

Wait, because when calculating Δh, which is Δu + (P2 v2 - P1 v1), each term needs to be in the same units. The problem gives data in ft³·lb and psi, but the answer is in Btu/lb.

So, let me compute P2 v2 and P1 v2 in Btu/lb.

Wait, 1 Btu is approximately 778 ft·lbf. So, to convert from ft³·psi to Btu, I need to consider the unit conversions.

Because 1 ft³·psi = 1 ft·lbf (since 1 psi = 1 lbf per square inch, and 1 ft³ = 12^3 cubic inches, so ft³·psi = (12^3) in³·lbf/in²) = 12^3 ft·lbf. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, 1 psi = 1 pound-force per square inch (lbf/in²).

1 cubic foot is 12 inches, so 1 cubic foot = 12^3 cubic inches = 1728 cubic inches.

So, 1 ft³·psi = 1728 in³·lbf/in² = 1728 lbf·in.

But 1 Btu is 778 ft·lbf, and 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 ft·lbf = 12 in·lbf.

So, 1 Btu = 778 * 12 in·lbf = 9336 in·lbf.

So, 1 ft³·psi = 1728 in·lbf.

So, to convert ft³·psi to Btu, divide by 9336 in·lbf/Btu.

So,

1 ft³·psi = 1728 / 9336 Btu ≈ 0.185 Btu.

Wait, let me compute that:

1728 ÷ 9336.

9336 ÷ 1728 ≈ 5.4.

So, 1 / 5.4 ≈ 0.185.

So, 1 ft³·psi ≈ 0.185 Btu.

So, now, let's recompute Δh:

P2 v2 = 110 psia * 0.5 ft³/lb = 55 ft³·psia/lb.

Similarly, P1 v1 = 15 * 2 = 30 ft³·psia/lb.

So,

Δ(Pv) = (55 - 30) = 25 ft³·psia/lb.

Convert that to Btu/lb:

25 ft³·psia/lb * 0.185 Btu/(ft³·psia) ≈ 4.625 Btu/lb.

So, Δh = Δu + Δ(Pv) = 40 + 4.625 ≈44.625 Btu/lb.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation where I didn't convert units and just added 25. So this is a crucial step I missed earlier.

So, now, using the correct unit conversion, Δh is approximately 44.625 Btu/lb.

Now, applying the first law for a control volume (steady flow):

Δh = q + w

We have Δh =44.625, w =70 (assuming work done on the system is positive).

So,

44.625 = q +70

q =44.625 -70 = -25.375 ≈-25.375 Btu/lb.

Looking at the options, option I is -25.37, which is very close to this value.

So the correct answer
