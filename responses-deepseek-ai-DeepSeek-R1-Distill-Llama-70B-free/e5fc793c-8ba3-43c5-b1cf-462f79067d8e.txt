Question:

Bill, a single man, owned pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant. He also owned a condominium in Miami, which he held for investment. In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?

Options:

A: Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.
B: Julie receives the condominium due to her father's original will, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie.
C: Kathy gets the condominium due to the deed, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split evenly between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
D: Kathy, as the surviving spouse, gets the entire estate regardless of the prenuptial agreement.
E: Tommy and Julie split all assets equally, as the prenuptial agreement nullifies any changes made after the marriage.
F: Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.
G: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.
H: Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie, as Kathy signed a prenuptial agreement.
I: Tommy gets the pasture land, Kathy gets the condominium due to her husband's last wish, and the remaining estate is split between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
J: Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about estate distribution after someone dies. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about Bill, who owns two properties: pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, and a condominium in Miami. He's a single man when he makes his will. In the will, he leaves the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condo to his daughter Julie. The rest of his assets are split equally between them.

Then, Bill marries Kathy after she signs a prenuptial agreement. This agreement says she gives up any rights she might have otherwise had by marrying Bill. So, Kathy can't claim a share of Bill's estate unless specified otherwise.

After the marriage, Bill and Kathy go on a honeymoon in Miami. While there, Kathy expresses her love for the condo, and Bill, being happy, decides to deed the condo to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety. He also plans to live there once the tenant leaves. But Bill dies the next day.

The question is about how the assets are distributed now. Let's look at the key points:

1. **Prenuptial Agreement**: Kathy gave up her rights to Bill's estate. So, she can't take against the will unless something else overrides this.

2. **Deed to Condominium**: Bill conveyed the condo to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety. In Florida, when a married couple owns property as tenants by the entirety, the survivor automatically gets the entire property when the other dies. So, if Bill dies, Kathy would get the condo regardless of the will because of the tenancy by the entirety.

3. **Bill's Will**: In the will, the condo was left to Julie. But after the marriage, Bill changed the ownership. The will might not affect the condo anymore because he transferred it during his lifetime. So, Julie's interest in the condo might be void now.

4. **Pasture Land**: The will says the pasture land goes to Tommy. Since Bill didn't change that, Tommy should still get it.

5. **Other Assets**: The will says the rest of the estate is split equally between Tommy and Julie. But wait, after the marriage, does Kathy have any claim to the rest? Normally, a spouse has certain rights, like an elective share, unless the prenup covers that. But in this case, the prenup says she relinquishes all rights, so she can't take anything else besides what she gets through the deed.

So, putting it all together:

- **Condominium**: Goes to Kathy because of the tenancy by the entirety. The will's provision to Julie is superseded because Bill transferred it during his life.

- **Pasture Land**: To Tommy as per the will.

- **Remaining Assets**: Split equally between Tommy and Julie, since Kathy has no claim due to the prenup.

Looking at the options:

Option G says Kathy gets the condo, Tommy the pasture, and the rest split between Tommy and Julie. That fits.

Option H says Julie gets the condo, but no, because Bill deeded it to Kathy. So H is incorrect.

Option B says Julie gets the condo, which is wrong because the deed takes precedence.

Option A suggests Kathy gets the condo, but the rest is split equally between Tommy and Julie, which matches, but I don't see an option that exactly fits that. Wait, looking again, option G says the rest is split between Tommy and Julie, which is correct.

Another point: The prenuptial agreement might prevent Kathy from getting anything else, but the deed is a separate transfer, so she gets the condo regardless of the prenup.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct distribution of Bill's assets is determined by analyzing the legal implications of the events leading up to his death. Bill owned two key properties: pasture land and a condominium. In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie, with the remainder of his estate to be split equally between them. However, Bill later married Kathy, who signed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing her rights to his estate. Subsequently, Bill conveyed the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety, which ensures that Kathy inherits the property upon Bill's death.

Key points:

1. **Condominium**: The deed conveying the property as tenants by the entirety takes precedence over the will. Therefore, Kathy inherits the condominium outright, and Julie's interest in it is superseded.

2. **Pasture Land**: The will explicitly devises the pasture land to Tommy, and there is no indication that Bill altered this disposition. Thus, Tommy inherits the pasture land.

3. **Remaining Assets**: The prenuptial agreement prevents Kathy from claiming any share of the remaining estate. As a result, the rest of Bill's assets are split equally between Tommy and Julie, as originally stipulated in the will.

Option G correctly reflects this distribution: Kathy receives the condominium, Tommy receives the pasture land, and the remainder of the estate is split equally between Tommy and Julie.

Answer: G
