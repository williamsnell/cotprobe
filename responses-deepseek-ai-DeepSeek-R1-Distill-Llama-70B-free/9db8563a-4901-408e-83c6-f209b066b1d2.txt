Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the UK Constitution, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about the UK Constitution.

I remember that the UK doesn't have a single, written constitution like the United States. Instead, it's made up of various documents, laws, and conventions. So, it's uncodified. That means it's not all in one place, right? So looking at the options, I can probably eliminate some choices right away.

Option B says the UK Constitution is codified and in a single document. That's definitely wrong because I know it's uncodified. So B is out. Option H says it's uncodified and found in multiple sources. That sounds right so far.

Option A says it's a direct copy of the US Constitution. No, the US has a written constitution with a separation of powers, while the UK's is unwritten and based on conventions and statutes. So A is wrong.

Option C: Can the Constitution be changed by a simple majority in Parliament? Well, the UK Parliament is sovereign, so theoretically, they can change the constitution by passing laws with a simple majority. But wait, some parts might require special procedures. I'm not entirely sure, but I think in general, yes. But I'll come back to that.

Option D says the judiciary can overturn acts of Parliament. No, in the UK, the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament is the highest authority, and courts can't overturn laws. Unless it's about EU law, but since Brexit, maybe that's changed. But traditionally, judges can't strike down Acts of Parliament. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Based on a Bill of Rights. The UK does have a Bill of Rights from 1689, but it's not the sole basis of the constitution. Also, the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights, but again, the constitution is broader. So E isn't the best description.

Option F: Power derived solely from Parliament. Hmm, I think the UK's constitution also includes conventions and the monarchy. So it's not solely from Parliament. Plus, the rule of law and judiciary play a role, but Parliament is supreme. So F might be partially correct, but I'm not sure if it's the best answer.

Option G: Based entirely on EU law. No, that's not true. Even before Brexit, EU law was a source but not the entire constitution. So G is wrong.

Option I: Power only from the sovereign. No, the monarch's role is ceremonial now. The real power comes from Parliament, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Based solely on common law. No, because it includes statutes and conventions as well. So J is wrong.

So, back to the options. The question is which statement best describes the UK Constitution. So H says it's uncodified and found in multiple sources, which matches what I remember. So H is a strong candidate.

Looking again at option C: Can it be changed by a simple majority? For most laws, yes. But some constitutional changes might require more, like referendums or specific majorities. But generally, Parliament can make changes with a simple majority. So C could be a possible answer, but I'm not sure if it's the best description of the constitution as a whole. The question is about the best description, not about how it's changed.

So H is better because it's a fundamental characteristic of the UK Constitution. So I think the correct answer is H.

The UK Constitution is best described as uncodified and found in a variety of sources, including statutes, conventions, and legal precedents. It is not contained in a single document and is distinct from the constitutions of other countries like the US. While Parliament can typically change the Constitution through a simple majority, this is not its defining feature. The judiciary cannot overturn Acts of Parliament, and the Constitution is not solely based on the EU law, a Bill of Rights, or common law.

Answer: H
