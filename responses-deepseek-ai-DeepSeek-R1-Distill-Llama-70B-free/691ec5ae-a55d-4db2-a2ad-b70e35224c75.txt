Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about externalities in economics. Hmm, I remember that externalities are when the production or consumption of a good affects third parties without compensation. Like pollution from a factory affecting nearby residentsâ€”that's a negative externality. Or maybe something like a positive externality, such as a neighbor's beautiful garden increasing your property's value.

The question is asking which option correctly describes an externality. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says an externality results in a deficit of goods. Wait, I don't think so. Externalities don't directly cause deficits or surpluses; they affect the market outcomes relative to the socially optimal ones. So A might not be right.

Option B is about a surplus. Similar to A, I don't recall externalities causing surplus or deficit directly. They might cause the market to have a different quantity than the social optimum.

Option C claims that an externality exists when equilibrium price equals market price. I'm a bit confused here. The equilibrium price is the market price where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. Externalities cause the market outcome to diverge from the social optimum, so maybe this isn't correct. Actually, when there's an externality, the market equilibrium isn't socially optimal, so C doesn't sound right.

Option D says externalities prevent markets from reaching equilibrium. No, markets can still reach equilibrium even with externalities; it's just that the equilibrium isn't efficient. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: causes equilibrium price to be artificially low. Wait, that might depend on the type of externality. For example, if there's a negative externality in production, like pollution, supply doesn't include the external cost. So the supply curve is higher than the social cost. This would mean the market equilibrium price is lower than the socially optimal price because producers don't bear all costs. So yes, E could be correct, but I need to think through the other options.

Option F: causes equilibrium price to be artificially high. That might be the opposite scenario. Maybe if there's a positive externality? Wait, no. Positive externality would mean that the market equilibrium is below the social optimum. For example, a vaccine: when you get vaccinated, you protect others. So the demand curve is lower than the social benefit. So the equilibrium quantity is less than optimal. So the price would be lower than what it should, right? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up a bit. Let me clarify.

Wait, negative externality in production means that the marginal social cost is higher than the marginal private cost. So the supply curve (which is MPC) is below the MSC. So at equilibrium, the quantity is higher than the socially optimal level because firms don't pay for the externality. So the market equilibrium has a higher quantity and lower price than the social optimum. So in that case, the price is lower than it should be, making E correct. Alternatively, for a positive externality in consumption, the marginal social benefit is higher than the marginal private benefit. So demand (MPB) is lower than MSB. So the equilibrium quantity is less than optimal, leading to a lower price than optimal. So in that case, the price is lower as well. Wait, so both negative and positive externalities could result in prices being lower than optimal? Or does it vary?

Wait, no. Let me think again. In a negative externality, the supply is higher (because producers don't account for the cost), so the equilibrium price is lower because supply shifts right, increasing quantity and lowering price. In a positive externality, demand is lower because consumers don't capture all benefits, so equilibrium price is lower than optimal. So E seems correct in both cases. But I'm not sure if this is the right way to interpret it.

Option G says an externality results in an equilibrium that doesn't maximize total benefit. Oh, that's about economic efficiency. Yes, externalities cause market failure, so the equilibrium isn't Pareto efficient. So G sounds correct. For example, in the case of pollution, the market produces more than the socially optimal quantity, leading to a loss of social welfare.

Option H causes the demand curve to shift left. I don't think that's necessarily the case. It depends on the type of externality. For positive externality, maybe demand would shift left because the perceived benefit is less. But it's not a direct shift; it's more about the divergence between private and social curves.

Option I says the equilibrium quantity exceeds the market quantity. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Market quantity is what equilibrium is. Oh, wait, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps it's referring to something else. Not sure, but I don't think I is correct.

Option J causes the supply curve to shift right. That would be the case for negative externalities, like when producing a good that pollutes. The supply curve is based on private costs, which are lower, so it's as if supply is higher. So J could be correct, but only in specific cases. But the question is about what an externality does in general.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back. The question is, which option best describes an externality.

Option G is about not maximizing total benefit. That's definitely true because externalities lead to market outcomes that aren't socially optimal. So G is a correct statement.

Option E says price is artificially low. That depends on the type of externality. For negative, yes, but for positive, maybe the price is lower than optimal as well. So E could be correct, but not all cases.

Wait, when there's a positive externality, the market equilibrium is below the social optimum. So the price is lower than the optimal, so E would also apply. So in both cases, the price is lower than it should be.

So E and G seem correct. But the question is which one is the correct answer.

Looking at the options, only one can be correct. So which one is the best fit.

The question is, which option describes an externality. So the definition.

An externality exists when the cost or benefit isn't fully borne by the producer/consumer, leading to a market equilibrium that's not efficient. So G is correct because it says "results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society." That's exactly what an externality does.

So the answer should be G.
</think>

An externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good affects third parties without compensation, leading to market outcomes that diverge from the socially optimal level. This results in market failure, where the equilibrium does not maximize the total benefit to society. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** and **B**: Externalities do not directly cause deficits or surpluses; they affect the market's efficiency relative to the social optimum. These are incorrect.
- **C**: Externalities cause the market equilibrium to diverge from the socially optimal price, so this is incorrect.
- **D**: Markets can still reach equilibrium with externalities; however, the equilibrium is inefficient. This is incorrect.
- **E**: While externalities can cause prices to be artificially low (e.g., negative externalities in production), this is not universally true for all externalities. It is not the best answer.
- **F**: This is incorrect because externalities do not universally cause prices to be artificially high.
- **G**: This is correct because externalities lead to market outcomes that do not maximize total social welfare, resulting in inefficiency.
- **H**, **I**, and **J**: These describe specific shifts or outcomes that may occur in certain cases but do not universally define an externality.

The best answer is **G**, as it accurately describes the fundamental impact of an externality: causing an equilibrium that does not maximize total benefit to society.

Answer: G
