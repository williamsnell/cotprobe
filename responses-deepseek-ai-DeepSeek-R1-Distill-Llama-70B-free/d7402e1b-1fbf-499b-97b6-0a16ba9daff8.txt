Okay, so I've got this question here about human chromosomes. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is asking how many chromosomes are in all human somatic cells. Hmm, I remember that somatic cells are the regular body cells, not the reproductive ones like sperm or egg cells. Right, those are called gametes.

Wait, human cells... I think humans have a certain number of chromosomes. Oh yeah, I remember the number 46 coming up a lot. But wait, how is that divided? Oh right, humans are diploid, meaning we have two sets of chromosomes. So that's 46 in total, right? And these are arranged in 23 pairs. So each pair has two chromosomes, one from each parent.

Wait, but the question is about somatic cells. Somatic cells are diploid, so they have 46 chromosomes. That makes sense because they undergo mitosis, which produces identical diploid cells. So each cell would have 46 chromosomes.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 46. But wait, let me double-check. The options are A to J, so I is 46. So the answer should be I.

Wait, another thought: are there any exceptions? Like, do any human cells have a different number? Well, the question specifies all somatic cells, so the only exception I can think of is the sex cells, but those aren't somatic. So yeah, all somatic cells have 46 chromosomes.

So I'm confident the answer is I.

The question asks how many chromosomes are present in all human somatic cells. Human somatic cells are diploid, meaning they contain two complete sets of chromosomes, totaling 46. This is consistent across all somatic cells, as they undergo mitosis and retain the same diploid number. Among the provided options, the correct answer is 46, which corresponds to option I.
