Okay, so I have this problem about calculating tips in a restaurant and figuring out by how much one method exceeds the standard tip. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question says that the standard tip is 15% of the bill before tax. Then, in California, people find the tip by doubling the sales tax, which is 8.25%. I need to find out how many cents this method exceeds the standard tip on a $60 bill before tax.

Alright, let's break it down. The bill before tax is $60. So first, I'll calculate the standard tip, which is 15% of 60. Then I'll calculate the tip by doubling the sales tax and see how much that is. The difference between these two should give me the answer.

Starting with the standard tip. 15% of 60. To calculate percentage, I can convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100. So 15% is 0.15. Then multiply that by 60.

0.15 * 60 = let me do the math. 0.1 *60 is 6, and 0.05*60 is 3, so 6+3=9. So the standard tip is $9.

Now, the California method is doubling the sales tax. The sales tax is 8.25%, so first I need to find 8.25% of 60 and then double that.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says they find the tip by doubling the sales tax. So does that mean tip = 2 * sales tax amount?

Because the sales tax is 8.25% of the bill. So the tax would be 8.25% of 60. Let me calculate that.

8.25% as a decimal is 0.0825. So 0.0825 *60. Let me compute that. Let's see, 60 times 0.08 is 4.8, and 60 times 0.0025 is 0.15. So adding those together, 4.8 + 0.15 = 4.95. So the sales tax is $4.95.

Then, doubling that for the tip. So 4.95 * 2 = 9.90. So the tip in this method would be $9.90.

Wait, but the standard tip is $9.00. So the difference is 9.90 - 9.00 = 0.90, which is 90 cents. So the California method gives a tip that's 90 cents higher than the standard tip.

So looking at the options, option B is 90 cents. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Standard tip: 15% of 60. 0.15*60=9. Correct.

Sales tax: 8.25% of 60. 0.0825*60=4.95. Correct.

Doubling the sales tax gives 9.90. Correct.

Difference is 9.90-9.00=0.90, which is 90 cents. So yes, option B is 90, which is the correct answer.

The standard tip is calculated as 15% of the bill before tax. For a $60 bill, this is:

\[
0.15 \times 60 = \$9.00
\]

In California, the tip is determined by doubling the sales tax, which is 8.25% of the bill. First, calculate the sales tax:

\[
0.0825 \times 60 = \$4.95
\]

Doubling the sales tax gives the tip:

\[
2 \times 4.95 = \$9.90
\]

The difference between the California tip and the standard tip is:

\[
9.90 - 9.00 = \$0.90
\]

Thus, the California method exceeds the standard tip by 90 cents. The correct answer is:

B: 90

Answer: B
