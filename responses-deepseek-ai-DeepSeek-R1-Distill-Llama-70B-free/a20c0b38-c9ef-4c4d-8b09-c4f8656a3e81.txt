Okay, so I've got this problem about a screened telephone cable, and I need to find the characteristic impedance, phase constant, and attenuation constant. Hmm, I remember from my classes that these are important parameters for transmission lines. Let me think about how to approach this.

The given parameters are at 10 kHz. So the frequency f is 10 kHz, which is 10^4 Hz. The parameters are:
- Inductance L = 0.7 × 10^-3 H/Km. Wait, that's 0.0007 H/Km.
- Capacitance C = 0.05 × 10^-6 F/Km. So 0.05e-6 is 5e-8 F/Km.
- Resistance R = 28 ohms/Km.
- Conductance G = 1 × 10^-6 mho/Km. Oh right, mho is siemens, so G is 1e-6 S/Km.

I remember that for transmission lines, especially when dealing with telephones or coaxial cables, we often use the concepts of characteristic impedance, attenuation, and phase constants. 

The characteristic impedance (Z) is given by the square root of (R + jωL)/(G + jωC). But wait, when the frequency is such that the line is not in the distortionless condition, this formula applies. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for Z0 in the complex form.

But wait, I might need to consider if this is a lossy line, which it is since R and G are non-zero. So the general approach would be to compute the propagation constant and then find the characteristic impedance.

The propagation constant γ is sqrt( (R + jωL) * (G + jωC) ). But wait, no, the correct formula is γ = sqrt( (R + jωL)(G + jωC) ). Wait, no, that's the product inside the square root. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is γ = sqrt( (R + jωL)(G + jωC) ). But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, the propagation constant is α + jβ, where α is the attenuation constant and β is the phase constant.

The characteristic impedance Z0 is sqrt( (R + jωL) / (G + jωC) ). Right, that's the formula I should use.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate ω, the angular frequency. ω = 2πf. f is 1e4 Hz, so ω = 2 * π * 1e4 ≈ 6.2832e4 rad/s.

Let's compute the numerator and denominator for Z0.

Numerator: R + jωL. R is 28 ohms per km. jωL is j * 6.2832e4 * 0.7e-3. Let me compute that.

0.7e-3 is 0.0007 H/Km. So 6.2832e4 * 0.0007 = approx 6.2832 * 7e1 * 1e-4? Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

6.2832e4 is 62832. Multiply by 0.0007: 62832 * 0.0007 = 43.  62832 * 0.0007 = let's see, 62,832 * 7 is 439,824. Then times 1e-4 is 43.9824. So jωL is j43.9824 ohms.

So the numerator R + jωL is 28 + j43.9824. 

Now the denominator: G + jωC. G is 1e-6 S/Km. jωC is j * 6.2832e4 * 0.05e-6 F. Let's compute that.

0.05e-6 is 5e-8 F. So 6.2832e4 *5e-8 = 6.2832 * 5e-4 = 0.0031416. So jωC is j0.0031416 S.

Wait, G is 1e-6 S, so G + jωC is 1e-6 + j0.0031416. 

Wait, 1e-6 is 0.000001, which is much smaller than 0.0031416, so the denominator is approximately j0.0031416. 

Now, to compute the characteristic impedance Z0, which is sqrt( (28 + j43.9824) / (G + jωC) ). Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the denominator. Because G is in mhos (S), so to compute the denominator correctly, I should think in terms of conductance. But perhaps it's better to compute the denominator as a complex number.

Wait, the denominator is (G + jωC) S, but to compute the ratio (R + jωL)/(G + jωC), perhaps I should take the reciprocal because S is Siemens, which is 1/Ohm. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of impedance.

Wait, no, the formula for Z0 is sqrt( (R + jωL) / (G + jωC) ), but R and G are per unit length. So both numerator and denominator are complex numbers.

So let me compute the numerator and denominator as complex numbers.

Numerator: R + jωL = 28 + j43.9824 ≈ 28 + j43.9824.

Denominator: G + jωC = 1e-6 + j(6.2832e4 * 0.05e-6). Let me compute that:

6.2832e4 = 62832. Multiply by 0.05e-6: 62832 * 0.05e-6 = 62832 * 5e-8 = (62832 *5 )e-8. 62832 *5 is 314160. So 314160e-8 = 3.1416e-3, so 0.0031416. So denominator is 1e-6 + j0.0031416.

So the denominator is approximately 0 + j0.0031416, since 1e-6 is negligible compared to 0.003.

So the ratio (R + jωL)/(G + jωC) is (28 + j43.9824) / (j0.0031416).

Hmm, dividing complex numbers. Let me compute this.

Let me represent this as (28 + j43.9824) / (j0.0031416). Let me write j0.0031416 as 0 + j0.0031416.

Dividing two complex numbers: (a + jb)/(c + jd) = [(a + jb)(c - jd)] / (c² + d²). But in this case, denominator is (0 + j0.0031416), so c=0, d=0.0031416.

So the denominator becomes (0)^2 + (0.0031416)^2 = (0.0031416)^2.

The numerator becomes (28 + j43.9824)(0 - j0.0031416) = 28*(-j0.0031416) + j43.9824*(-j0.0031416).

Compute each term:

28 * (-j0.0031416) = -j0.088046.

j43.9824 * (-j0.0031416) = -j^2 * 43.9824 * 0.0031416. Since j^2 = -1, this becomes + (43.9824 * 0.0031416).

Compute 43.9824 * 0.0031416. Let me approximate:

43 * 0.003 is 0.129. 43.98 is about 44, 0.0031416 is about 0.00314. So 44*0.00314 = 0.13816.

So the second term is +0.13816.

So the numerator is (-j0.088046) + 0.13816.

So the entire ratio becomes [0.13816 - j0.088046] / (0.0031416)^2.

Compute denominator: (0.0031416)^2 = approx (0.00314)^2 = 9.86e-6.

So 0.13816 / 9.86e-6. Let's compute that.

0.13816 / 9.86e-6 ≈ (0.13816 / 9.86) * 1e6. 0.13816 / ~10 is ~0.0138, which is 1.38e4. Wait, 9.86e-6 is 0.00000986.

Wait, 0.13816 / 0.00000986 = approximately 0.13816 / 9.86e-6 ≈ (0.13816 / 9.86) * 1e6.

Wait, 0.13816 divided by 9.86 is approximately 0.014. So 0.014 * 1e6 = 14,000 ohms? That can't be right, because looking at the answer choices, the characteristic impedance is around 120 ohms or so. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the characteristic impedance is Z0 = sqrt( (R + jωL) / (G + jωC) ). So perhaps I should compute (R + jωL) and (G + jωC), then take their ratio, then take the square root.

Wait, but when I compute (R + jωL)/(G + jωC), maybe it's easier to compute the magnitude and phase, then take the square root.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitude of Z0 first, then the phase.

Wait, let me think numerically.

(R + jωL) = 28 + j43.9824. The magnitude is sqrt(28^2 + (43.98)^2) ≈ sqrt(784 + 1934) = sqrt(2718) ≈ 52.14 ohms.

(G + jωC) = 1e-6 + j0.0031416. The magnitude is sqrt( (1e-6)^2 + (0.0031416)^2 ) ≈ 0.0031416, since 1e-6 is negligible.

So the magnitude of the ratio is 52.14 / 0.0031416 ≈ 52.14 / 0.0031416 ≈ let's compute this.

52.14 / 0.0031416 ≈ 52.14 * (1/0.0031416) ≈ 52.14 * 318.31 ≈ 52 * 300 is 15,600, but let's compute more accurately.

0.0031416 is approximately 1/318.31, so 52.14 * 318.31 ≈ 52 * 300 = 15,600, plus 52*18.31 ≈ 952, so total around 16,552. So the magnitude is sqrt of that, wait no, wait: the ratio is (R+jωL)/(G+jωC), which has a magnitude of 52.14 / 0.0031416 ≈ 16,580. So the magnitude of Z0 is sqrt(16,580) ≈ sqrt(16,580) ≈ 128.8 ohms. Hmm, looking at the options, some have around 120, 123, 127, etc. So 128 would be in the ballpark.

But wait, let me double-check that calculation because I might have messed up the ratio.

Wait, 52.14 divided by 0.0031416 is 52.14 / 0.0031416. Let me compute this:

52.14 / 0.0031416 ≈ 52.14 * (1/0.0031416) ≈ 52.14 * 318.309 ≈ let's compute 52 * 318 = 16,536, plus 0.14 * 318 ≈ 44.52, so total approx 16,580. So sqrt(16,580) is sqrt(16,580) = approx 128.8 ohms. Hmm.

But wait, maybe I should consider the exact value. Let me compute (R + jωL)/(G + jωC) as a complex number.

Wait, let me compute the exact division:

(R + jωL) = 28 + j43.9824.

(G + jωC) = 1e-6 + j0.0031416.

So to compute (28 + j43.9824)/(1e-6 + j0.0031416), let's multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.

Denominator's conjugate is 1e-6 - j0.0031416.

So the numerator becomes (28 + j43.9824)(1e-6 - j0.0031416).

Denominator becomes (1e-6)^2 + (0.0031416)^2.

Let me compute denominator first:

(1e-6)^2 = 1e-12, negligible.

(0.0031416)^2 ≈ 9.8696e-6.

So denominator ≈ 9.8696e-6.

Now numerator:

(28)(1e-6) = 2.8e-5.

28*(-j0.0031416) = -j0.088046.

j43.9824*(1e-6) = j4.39824e-5.

j43.9824*(-j0.0031416) = -j^2 * 43.9824 * 0.0031416 = + (43.9824 * 0.0031416).

Compute 43.9824 * 0.0031416:

Approx 44 * 0.00314 = 0.13816.

So adding all the terms:

Real parts: 2.8e-5 (from 28*1e-6) and 0.13816 (from j43.98 * -j term).

Imaginary parts: -j0.088046 and j4.39824e-5.

So real parts sum: 0.13816 + 0.000028 ≈ 0.138188.

Imaginary parts sum: (-0.088046 + 0.00004398) j ≈ (-0.088002) j.

So numerator is approximately 0.138188 - j0.088002.

Divide by denominator 9.8696e-6:

(0.138188 / 9.8696e-6) ≈ 0.138188 / 0.0000098696 ≈ approx 14,000.

Wait, 0.138188 / 0.0000098696 = let's compute:

0.0000098696 is 9.8696e-6. 0.138188 / 9.8696e-6 ≈ (0.138188 / 9.8696) * 1e6.

0.138188 / 9.8696 ≈ 0.014.

0.014 * 1e6 = 14,000. So the real part is 14,000.

The imaginary part is (-0.088002) / 9.8696e-6 ≈ (-0.088002) / 0.0000098696 ≈ -0.088 / 0.00000987 ≈ -8,920.

So the ratio (R + jωL)/(G + jωC) ≈ 14,000 - j8,920.

Wait, that can't be right because the square of that would be way too big, leading to a huge Z0. But earlier approximation suggested about 128 ohms for Z0. So clearly, I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recheck the numerator.

Wait, (28 + j43.9824) multiplied by (1e-6 - j0.0031416):

Let me compute each term step by step.

28 * 1e-6 = 2.8e-5.

28 * (-j0.0031416) = -j0.08804608.

j43.9824 * 1e-6 = j0.0000439824.

j43.9824 * (-j0.0031416) = (-j^2)(43.9824 * 0.0031416) = (43.9824 * 0.0031416) because j^2 = -1.

Compute 43.9824 * 0.0031416:

43.9824 * 0.003 = 0.1317464.

43.9824 * 0.0001416 ≈ approx 0.00623.

Adding together gives 0.1317464 + 0.00623 ≈ 0.1379764.

So the j * (-j) term becomes +0.1379764.

Now, sum all the terms:

Real parts: 2.8e-5 (from 28 * 1e-6) and 0.1379764 (from j43.98 * -j term) → total 0.138, approximately.

Imaginary parts: -j0.08804608 (from 28 * -j term) and j0.0000439824 (from j43.98 * 1e-6 term) → sum to approximately -j0.0880021.

So the numerator is (0.138) - j0.0880021.

Denominator: (1e-6)^2 + (0.0031416)^2 ≈ 0 + 0.0000098696 ≈ 0.0000098696.

So the ratio is (0.138 - j0.088)/(0.0000098696) ≈ (0.138/0.0000098696) - j (0.088/0.0000098696).

Compute each division:

0.138 / 0.0000098696 ≈ 14,000.

0.088 / 0.0000098696 ≈ 8,920.

So the ratio is approximately 14,000 - j8,920.

Wait, that would mean Z0 is sqrt(14,000 - j8,920). Wait, but that's a complex number inside the sqrt, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the division.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Z0 is sqrt( (R + jωL) / (G + jωC) ), but I think I might have the reciprocal. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Z0 = sqrt( (R + jωL
