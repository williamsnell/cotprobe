Question:

One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the father did not retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege.
B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.
C: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.
D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.
E: admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public.
F: admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father was.
G: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.
H: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.
I: inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship.
J: inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with attorney-client privilege. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the scenario is a bit detailed, so I'll try to break it down. There's a pilot whose plane ran out of gas, and during an emergency landing, a 9-year-old boy was injured by something that might have fallen from the plane. The father is suing the pilot for negligence in federal court.

The boy and his father went to an attorney for preliminary discussions but didn't hire him. Instead, they hired another lawyer. Now, at trial, the pilot's attorney is calling this consulting attorney to testify about what the boy said regarding his physical condition during that initial consultation.

The question is whether the attorney's testimony is admissible, with options from A to J.

So, I remember that attorney-client privilege covers confidential communications between a client and their attorney made during legal consultation. But there are exceptions and certain conditions where the privilege might not apply.

First, the key points here: the boy and father consulted an attorney but didn't retain him. They hired someone else. So, was the initial consultation privileged?

I think that even preliminary consultations are protected under attorney-client privilege, as the purpose is to seek legal advice. So, any communications made during that time should be confidential. The fact that the attorney wasn't hired afterward doesn't matter because the privilege is about the communication during the consultation, not the ongoing relationship.

Wait, but who was the client? The father brought the son to the attorney. So, was the client the father, the son, or both? Since the son is a minor, his father would typically have the authority to waive privilege on his behalf, but in this case, the father didn't retain the attorney. 

Another angle: when the consulting attorney spoke with the boy and the father, the presence of the father during the consultation. Does having a third party present affect the privilege? Normally, if a third party is present (who isn't necessary for the consultation, like a translator or something), it can waive the privilege because it's no longer confidential. But here, the father is the parent, so perhaps his presence is allowed without breaking confidentiality. Or maybe because the father is the one bringing the case, the son's statements in front of him are still privileged.

Wait, but the boy is the one who was injured. So, when he spoke to the attorney, was he the client? Or was the father the client? Because the father is suing on behalf of the son, perhaps the son is the client, but minors can't really form attorney-client relationships on their own. So the father would be acting on his behalf.

But regardless, the communication was made during a legal consultation, so it's protected. Even if the attorney wasn't retained, the initial consultation is still privileged. So the attorney can't testify about what was said.

Looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege. Option D says the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired. Option F says admissible because the boy wasn't the client, only the father was.

Wait, if the father was the client, then the boy's statements made in the father's presence might still be privileged because they were part of the legal consultation between the father and the attorney. So the attorney can't disclose those communications.

So, looking at option F: admissible because the boy wasn't the attorney's client, only the father was. But even if the boy wasn't the client, his statements were made during a privileged conversation between the attorney and the father. So the attorney can't testify about them.

Another thought: if the father didn't retain the attorney, does that mean the attorney wasn't his attorney? But for the purposes of privilege, the key is whether the communication was made in the context of seeking legal advice. So even if not retained, the initial consultation is protected.

So, the consulting attorney can't disclose what the boy said, so the testimony is inadmissible. So options C, D, I, J, etc.

Wait, option C is about attorney-client privilege preventing the testimony. Option D says the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired. Which is true because the privilege isn't about the representation, it's about the communication.

Option G says admissible because someone else was present. But the father's presence might not break the privilege because he's the client's representative, perhaps.

Hmm, wait, but the presence of a third party can sometimes waive privilege. But in this case, the third party is the father, who is acting on behalf of the minor. So perhaps the presence doesn't affect the privilege.

So, the attorney can't testify, making the testimony inadmissible. So looking at the options, which ones say it's inadmissible.

Option C says it's inadmissible due to attorney-client privilege. Option D says inadmissible because the privilege remains even with another attorney. So both C and D are possible.

But wait, the boy was present with his father. If the father is the client, then the boy's statements in front of the father might still be protected, as the communication was between the attorney and the father, and the boy's statements were part of that.

Wait, but the statement is about the boy's physical condition. The boy's statement might be considered a party opponent statement or something else, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, the statement could be admissible under an exception, but I don't recall an exception that would apply here.

So, the attorney's testimony about what the boy said during the consultation is covered by attorney-client privilege and thus inadmissible. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but option F says it's admissible because the boy wasn't the client. But if the father was the client, the boy's statement made in the presence of the father during the consultation would still be privileged because it's part of the communication between the attorney and the father.

Wait, but if the boy is the one suing, or the plaintiff, then perhaps his statements are not privileged. But in this case, the father is the one suing on behalf of the son. So the son's statements to the attorney during the consultation with the father are part of the privileged communication between the father and the attorney.

So, the consulting attorney can't disclose those statements, so the testimony is inadmissible. Therefore, the answer would be C or D.

Wait, option D says it's inadmissible because the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired. That's correct because the privilege isn't dependent on the attorney being retained; it's about the communication during the legal consultation.

So, perhaps the answer is D. But I'm a bit confused because C and D both seem to relate to the same issue.

Alternatively, another option: option G says it's admissible because someone else was present. But as we thought earlier, the presence of the father doesn't negate the privilege because he's the client's representative.

So, the correct reasoning is that the communication was privileged, so the testimony is inadmissible. Looking at the options, the best fit is either C or D.

Wait, the question is about whether the attorney's testimony is admissible. The consulting attorney had a preliminary discussion with the boy and his father but wasn't retained. Does the fact that the father didn't retain him affect the privilege?

I think the key is that the communication was made for the purpose of seeking legal advice, regardless of whether representation occurred. So, the privilege still applies. Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege.

So, the options would be either C or D.

Option C: inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege preventing breach.

Option D: inadmissible because the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired.

Wait, but in this case, the consulting attorney wasn't the one hired, but the communication was still protected.

So, the correct answer is either C or D. But I think D specifically addresses the situation where the attorney isn't retained, but the privilege remains.

Hmm, but I think both C and D are correct in their reasoning, but the options are presented as separate choices.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's more specific about the situation where another attorney is hired. So, even if another attorney is hired, the privilege remains for the initial consultation.

Alternatively, C is more general, stating that the attorney-client privilege prevents the breach.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again: the attorney's testimony is about what the boy said during the consultation. The consultation was with the father and son, but the attorney wasn't hired. So, any communication during that consultation is still privileged.

Thus, the testimony is inadmissible. So, the options are C, D, or perhaps F.

Wait, option F says admissible because the boy wasn't the client. But the father was the client, and the boy's statements were made in the presence of the father during the consultation. So, the boy's statements are part of the privileged communication between the father and the attorney.

So, the attorney can't testify, making the testimony inadmissible.

So, I think the correct answer is D: inadmissible because the privilege remains even if a different attorney is hired.

Alternatively, if the court decides that because the attorney wasn't retained, there's no privilege, then it would be admissible. But I don't think that's the case. The initial consultation is protected regardless of retention.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the Federal Rules. Under FRE 501, the common law applies, and the attorney-client privilege covers confidential communications made during the legal consultation, regardless of whether the attorney is subsequently retained.

So, the fact that the father didn't retain the attorney doesn't matter. The communication is still privileged.

So, the testimony is inadmissible because of the privilege. So, options C, D, etc.

Option C says it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege preventing breach. Option D says it's inadmissible because the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired.

I think both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps D is more accurate because it specifically addresses the situation where a different attorney is hired. But in reality, the key is that the communication was during a legal consultation, regardless of whether the attorney was hired.

Wait, but the father didn't retain the consulting attorney, so the consulting attorney wasn't his attorney. But the initial consultation is still privileged.

So, the consulting attorney can't testify about the boy's statements because they were made during a legal consultation, even though the attorney wasn't retained. So, the privilege applies.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: inadmissible because the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired.

Alternatively, if the attorney wasn't retained, perhaps there's no privilege. But I don't think that's the case. The initial consultation is protected.

Wait, but I think the general rule is that even if the attorney isn't hired, the initial consultation is still protected by privilege. So, the communication is confidential.

So, the testimony is inadmissible, and the correct answer is either C or D.

Looking back at the options, option F says admissible because the boy wasn't the client. But the boy was present with the father, and the father was the client. So, the boy's statements were part of the privileged communication.

So, I think the answer is D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.

Wait, no, because the consulting attorney wasn't hired, but the communication is still protected. So, the presence of the father, as the client, makes the boy's statement privileged.

Yes, so the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether the testimony of a consulting attorney, who was not retained, about statements made by a 9-year-old boy during a preliminary consultation, is admissible in court. The key issue is whether these statements are protected under attorney-client privilege.

Attorney-client privilege applies to confidential communications made during legal consultations, regardless of whether the attorney is subsequently retained. In this case, the boy and his father consulted with the attorney for preliminary discussions, which constitutes a legal consultation. Even though the attorney was not hired, the communications made during this consultation are still protected under privilege. The presence of the father, who was acting on behalf of the minor, does not negate the privilege, as the communication was part of the legal consultation.

The correct reasoning is that the privilege remains intact even if a different attorney is hired, as the protection is based on the nature of the communication during the consultation, not the outcome of the representation. Therefore, the consulting attorney cannot testify about the boy's statements, making the testimony inadmissible.

Option D correctly captures this reasoning: "inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired."
