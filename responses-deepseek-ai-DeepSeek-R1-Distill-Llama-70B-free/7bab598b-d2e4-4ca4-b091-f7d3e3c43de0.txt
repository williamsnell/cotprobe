Question:

A supplier of ink for printers sent the following letter to all of its customers:"Closeout special! We have decided to no longer stock green ink cartridges. We have on hand a limited supply of green ink cartridges for all printers; when they're gone, they're gone! Please submit your orders as soon as possible to make sure your order can be filled. "One of the regular customers of the supplier sent the following reply by fax:"Sorry to hear that you will no longer carry green ink cartridges, since that is one of our favorite colors. Please ship 100 green ink cartridges to our office as soon as possible. "The supplier faxed an acknowledgement of the order to the customer with a promise that the cartridges would be shipped out in one week. The next day, the supplier received the following e-mail from the customer:"Please cancel our order. We just discovered that we already have plenty of green ink cartridges in inventory. " The supplier proceeded to sell its entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price to other customers. In an action for breach of contract by the supplier against the customer, what is the maximum amount of damages that the supplier should be entitled to recover?

Options:

A: Consequential damages, since the green ink cartridges were unique because they were the last of their kind to be offered for sale by the supplier.
B: The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the potential sale to other customers.
C: $10,000, which is double the asking price of the cartridges, as a penalty for the customer's late cancellation.
D: Only incidental damages, if any, that the supplier has incurred in preparing the green ink cartridges for shipment to the customer before receiving the customer's e-mail.
E: The cost of the ink cartridges plus the cost of shipping, as the supplier had already promised to ship them out.
F: $5,000, which was the asking price for the 100 green ink cartridges ordered.
G: The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the sale to other customers, since the supplier had to sell the cartridges at a lower price.
H: The full cost of the cartridges plus any additional costs incurred in the sale to other customers.
I: Nothing.
J: Any additional costs incurred by the supplier in obtaining replacement cartridges to fulfill the customer's order.

Okay, so I've got this contract question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the situation is about a supplier of ink cartridges and one of their regular customers. The supplier sent a letter saying they're discontinuing green ink cartridges and have a limited stock. They urged customers to order quickly before they're gone.

The customer replied by fax, ordering 100 green cartridges. The supplier acknowledged the order and promised to ship them in a week. But the next day, the customer emailed to cancel the order because they found they already had plenty in stock. The supplier then sold all their stock to other customers at their asking price.

Now, the supplier is suing the customer for breach of contract, and we need to determine the maximum damages the supplier can recover.

Hmm, so I remember that in contract law, when a buyer breaches, the seller can recover damages. The main idea is to put the seller in the position they would have been in if the contract had been fulfilled.

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) applies here because we're dealing with the sale of goods. Under UCC §2-708, which deals with seller's remedies, there are a few possible measures of damages.

First, if the seller is a lost volume seller, they might be able to recover lost profits. A lost volume seller is someone who would have made an additional profit from both the original sale and the resale. So if the supplier could have sold those 100 cartridges to both this customer and another, then losing this sale means a loss in volume.

In this case, the supplier had a limited stock, but they ended up selling their entire stock to other customers at the same asking price. So when the customer canceled, the supplier didn't lose a sale because they resold all their stock. Wait, but that might not matter. Let me think.

If the supplier had enough stock to fulfill both the original customer and the subsequent customers, then maybe they're a lost volume seller. But if the stock was limited, and the supplier could only sell each cartridge once, then perhaps the loss is not as much.

Wait, the question says the supplier sold their entire stock to other customers at their asking price. So, the supplier didn't lose any sales because they found other buyers. So, the supplier didn't suffer any loss in revenue or profit because they were able to sell all their stock.

So, the measure of damages for breach of contract is typically the difference between the contract price and the market price, but if the seller resells the goods, it's the difference between the resale price and the contract price, plus any incidental damages, minus any expenses saved.

But in this case, the resale price was the same as the contract price because the supplier sold them at the same asking price. So the difference would be zero. Therefore, the supplier didn't lose any money on the sale.

Wait, but what about the cost the supplier incurred in processing the original order? Like, maybe they had already prepared the cartridges for shipment or incurred some costs before the cancellation.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the supplier is entitled to nothing. That would be the case if they didn't suffer any loss. Because they sold all their stock at the same price, so no loss in profit. Also, if the cost of the cartridges is their cost, but they sold them, so their cost is covered.

Option F is $5,000, the asking price. But that would make sense if the supplier had to resell at a lower price, but here they sold at the same price.

Option B is the cost plus loss in profit to other customers. But if they sold all, no loss in profit.

Option D says only incidental damages if any. Incidental damages are costs like handling the return or resale, but since they just sold them, maybe no incidental costs. Or perhaps the cost of processing the order and then having to process a cancellation.

Wait, the customer sent a fax order, the supplier acknowledged, and then the customer canceled the next day. The supplier had to process the cancellation and maybe adjust their shipping plans. So maybe the supplier incurred some incidental costs, like administrative costs in handling the cancellation and reallocating the stock.

But under UCC §2-708(1), the measure is the difference between market price and contract price, but if there's no loss, then nothing. Alternatively, under §2-708(2), which is for lost profits if the seller is a lost volume seller.

But here, the supplier sold all the stock, so the lost volume argument might not apply because the supplier didn't lose a sale overall—they just shifted the sale from this customer to others. So if the supplier could have sold those 100 to both this customer and another, then they would be a lost volume seller. But in this case, the total stock was limited, so each sale was a unique one. So perhaps the supplier isn't a lost volume seller because the total stock was fixed.

Wait, but the initial letter says they have a limited supply, and when they're gone, they're gone. So the supplier can't produce more. So when the customer cancels, the supplier can sell those 100 to someone else. So the supplier didn't lose any profit because they could resell them. Therefore, the supplier's loss is zero.

So the answer would be I: Nothing.

Wait, but what about the cost incurred in processing the order? Did the supplier have any costs when preparing the shipment? The customer canceled the next day after the supplier acknowledged. The supplier had promised to ship in a week. So maybe the supplier incurred some costs in preparing the order, like handling, packaging, etc.

But under UCC §2-708(1), the measure is the difference between market and contract price. If market price equals contract price, then no loss. But if the supplier incurred costs in processing the order, can they recover those as incidental damages under §2-710?

Wait, §2-710 deals with incidental damages when the seller resells the goods. It says that the seller can recover incidental damages under §2-710, which are costs related to the resale, but if the resale is at the same price, the difference is zero, so the only recovery is incidental damages.

But in this case, the resale was successful at the same price, so the difference is zero. So the supplier can only recover any incidental damages, like the cost of reselling, but since they sold all their stock, perhaps they didn't incur extra costs beyond what they normally would.

Wait, but the customer's cancellation caused the supplier to have to process a cancellation and maybe adjust their shipping. So maybe the supplier can recover the costs of handling the cancellation as incidental damages.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Only incidental damages, if any, that the supplier has incurred in preparing the green ink cartridges for shipment to the customer before receiving the customer's e-mail.

So, if the supplier had started preparing the shipment (like packaging, etc.) before the cancellation, they could recover those costs as incidental damages.

But the question states that the supplier acknowledged the order and promised shipping in a week. The next day, the customer canceled, and the supplier then sold the stock to others. So perhaps the supplier hadn't yet started preparing the shipment. They had a week to ship, so the next day, they just had to adjust their shipping schedule.

In that case, maybe the supplier didn't incur any incidental costs. So the answer would be I: Nothing.

Alternatively, if the supplier had already incurred some costs in preparing for shipment, then D could be correct. But the question doesn't specify that the supplier had started preparing the shipment yet. So it's possible they didn't incur any costs beyond processing the order and cancellation.

So the maximum damages would be nothing because the supplier didn't suffer any loss—they sold all the cartridges at the same price. So the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around a contract dispute between a supplier of green ink cartridges and a customer. The supplier announced it would no longer stock green cartridges and urged customers to order quickly. A customer faxed an order for 100 cartridges, which the supplier acknowledged and promised to ship in a week. The next day, the customer emailed to cancel the order, and the supplier subsequently sold its entire stock of green cartridges to other customers at the same asking price.

To determine the maximum damages the supplier can recover, we analyze the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) §2-708, which governs seller remedies for breach of contract. The key issue is whether the supplier suffered any loss due to the customer's cancellation. Since the supplier sold all its stock at the same asking price, it did not lose revenue or profit. The UCC allows recovery for the difference between the contract price and market price, but here, the resale price equaled the contract price, resulting in no loss. Additionally, the supplier does not qualify as a "lost volume seller" because it did not miss out on an additional sale—it simply reallocated the cartridges to other customers.

The question also considers incidental damages under UCC §2-710, which might include costs incurred in preparing the shipment or processing the cancellation. However, the facts do not indicate that the supplier had already started preparing the shipment or incurred additional costs beyond processing the order and cancellation. Therefore, no incidental damages are recoverable.

Given that the supplier did not suffer any financial loss or incur additional costs, the maximum damages it can recover are nothing.
