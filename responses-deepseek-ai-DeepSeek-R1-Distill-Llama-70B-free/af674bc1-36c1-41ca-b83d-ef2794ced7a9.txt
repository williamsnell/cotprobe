Okay, so I've got this problem here about collecting oxygen gas over water and figuring out its volume at STP. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that 100 ml of oxygen is collected over water. I remember that when you collect a gas over water, the gas is saturated with water vapor. So the total pressure is the sum of the pressure of the dry gas and the water vapor. Oh right, that's Dalton's law of partial pressures. So the pressure of the dry oxygen would be the total pressure minus the water vapor pressure at that temperature.

The given conditions: pressure is 700 torr, temperature is 20°C. Wait, I need to convert that temperature to Kelvin because gas laws require absolute temperature. So 20°C is 293.15 K, right? Let me double-check that—yes, since 273 + 20 = 293 K.

Now, what's the vapor pressure of water at 20°C? I think it's around 17.5 mmHg or torr. Wait, wait, let me be precise. I recall a table where at 20°C, water's vapor pressure is approximately 17.5 torr. So the pressure of the dry oxygen would be 700 torr minus 17.5 torr. Let me calculate that: 700 - 17.5 = 682.5 torr. So that's the partial pressure of the oxygen gas.

Now, I need to find the volume of this dry oxygen at STP. STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C (273 K) and 1 atm pressure. But wait, I should check the units because the given pressure is in torr. Let me make sure all the units are compatible.

So, the initial state is:
P1 = 682.5 torr,
V1 = 100 ml,
T1 = 293.15 K.

The final state is STP:
P2 = 1 atm,
T2 = 273 K.

But wait, since we're dealing with pressure in torr and volume in ml, maybe it's easier to use the combined gas law in terms of torr. Because the units for pressure should match on both sides.

The combined gas law is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the pressures are in the same units. Since P1 is in torr, I should convert P2 (which is 1 atm) into torr. I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr. So P2 is 760 torr.

Plugging in the numbers:

(682.5 torr * 100 ml) / 293.15 K = (760 torr * V2) / 273 K.

I can rearrange this to solve for V2. Let me write that:

V2 = (682.5 * 100 * 273) / (760 * 293.15).

Hmm, let's compute this step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: 682.5 * 100 = 68250. Multiply by 273: 68250 * 273. Let me see, 68250 * 200 is 13,650,000. 68250 * 73 is ... well, 68250 *70=4,777,500 and 68250*3=204,750. So total 4,777,500 +204,750=4,982,250. So 13,650,000 +4,982,250 = 18,632,250.

Wait, wait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute 68250 * 273.

Wait, actually, 68250 multiplied by 273:

Let me break it down:

68250 * 200 = 13,650,000
68250 * 70 = 4,777,500
68250 * 3 = 204,750

Adding those together: 13,650,000 + 4,777,500 = 18,427,500; plus 204,750 gives 18,632,250. So numerator is 18,632,250.

Denominator is 760 * 293.15. Let me compute that:

760 * 293.15 = ?

Well, 700 * 293.15 = 205,205.

60 * 293.15 = 17,589.

So total is 205,205 +17,589 = 222,794.

So V2 = 18,632,250 / 222,794.

Let me compute that division.

Approximately, let's see:

222,794 * 83.7 = ?

Wait, maybe approximate first.

222,794 * 80 = 17,823,520.

17,823,520 is less than 18,632,250. The difference is 18,632,250 -17,823,520 = 808,730.

Now, 222,794 * 3.7 = ?

222,794 *3 = 668,382.

222,794 * 0.7 = 155,855.8.

So 668,382 + 155,855.8 = 824,237.8.

So 222,794 * 83.7 = 17,823,520 + 824,237.8 = 18,647,757.8.

Wait, but our numerator is 18,632,250, which is slightly less than 18,647,757.8.

So 83.7 would give us a value a bit higher than our numerator. So perhaps around 83.6 instead.

Alternatively, perhaps I should do a more precise division.

Let me compute 18,632,250 ÷ 222,794.

Let me see how many times 222,794 fits into 18,632,250.

Dividing 18,632,250 by 222,794.

I can approximate this:

Well, 222,794 *83 = ?

Calculate 222,794 *80 =17,823,520.

222,794 *3 = 668,382.

So 17,823,520 +668,382 = 18,491,902.

Now, 83 * 222,794 = 18,491,902.

Subtract this from the numerator: 18,632,250 -18,491,902 = 140,348.

Now, how much is 222,794 *0.632?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 140,348 /222,794.

140348 ÷222794 ≈ 0.63.

So total would be 83 +0.63 = 83.63.

So V2 is approximately 83.63 ml.

Looking at the options, option D is 83.7 ml, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Another approach: Let's compute V2 using the formula.

V2 = (682.5 * 100 * 273) / (760 * 293.15)

Compute each part:

682.5 *100 =68250.

68250 *273 = let's compute 68250*273.

Wait 68250 * 273: 

68250 * 200 =13,650,000.

68250 *70 =4,777,500.

68250 *3 =204,750.

Total 13,650,000 +4,777,500 =18,427,500 + 204,750 =18,632,250.

Denominator:760 *293.15 =760*(293 +0.15)=760*293 +760*0.15.

760 *293: Let's compute 700*293=205,100, 60*293=17,580. So 205,100+17,580=222,680.

760 *0.15=114. So denominator is 222,680 +114=222,794.

So 18,632,250 /222,794 = approx 83.63 ml, which is about 83.6 ml, very close to option D:83.7 ml.

Hmm, perhaps in the calculation, I should carry more precise numbers. Let me try calculating 682.5 /760 first, then apply the temperature adjustment.

Wait, another approach: Using the ideal gas law, since n is constant.

n = P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2.

So V2 = (P1 V1 T2) / (P2 T1).

Plugging in:

P1 =682.5 torr, V1=100 ml, T2=273 K, P2=760 torr, T1=293.15 K.

So V2 = (682.5 *100 *273) / (760 *293.15).

Which is the same as before.

Calculating step by step:

682.5 *100 =68250.

68250 *273 =18,632,250.

760 *293.15=760*(293 +0.15)=760*293=222,680, 760*0.15=114 → 222,794.

So 18,632,250 /222,794 = ?

Let me compute 18,632,250 ÷ 222,794.

Well, 222,794 *83 = 222,794 *80=17,823,520 + 222,794*3=668,382 → total 18,491,902.

Subtract that from 18,632,250 → 18,632,250 -18,491,902 =140,348.

Now, 140,348 /222,794 = approx 0.63.

So 83 +0.63 =83.63, so approximately 83.6 ml.

Looking at the options, D is 83.7, which is the closest. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the volume of dry oxygen gas at STP, we start by noting that the gas was collected over water, meaning the total pressure includes the partial pressure of water vapor. Using Dalton's law of partial pressures, the partial pressure of dry oxygen is:

\[
P_{\text{oxygen}} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{water vapor}} = 700 \, \text{torr} - 17.5 \, \text{torr} = 682.5 \, \text{torr}.
\]

The initial conditions are:
- \( P_1 = 682.5 \, \text{torr} \),
- \( V_1 = 100 \, \text{ml} \),
- \( T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K} \).

The final conditions at STP are:
- \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{torr} \),
- \( T_2 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273 \, \text{K} \).

Using the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2},
\]

we solve for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = \frac{682.5 \times 100 \times 273}{760 \times 293.15}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
682.5 \times 100 = 68250, \quad 68250 \times 273 = 18,632,250.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
760 \times 293.15 = 222,794.
\]

Now divide:

\[
V_2 = \frac{18,632,250}{222,794} \approx 83.63 \, \text{ml}.
\]

This value is closest to option **D: 83.7 ml**.

Answer: D
