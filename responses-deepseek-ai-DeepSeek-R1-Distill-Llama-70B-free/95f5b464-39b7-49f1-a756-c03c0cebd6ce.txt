Okay, so I've got this transmission line problem to solve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the efficiency of a parallel-wire transmission line. The efficiency is the ratio of the power delivered to the load over the power supplied to the input terminals.

Alright, the given parameters are:
- Frequency (f) = 4000 kilocycles, which is 4 MHz.
- R = 0.025 ohm/m
- L = 2 microhenry/m (so 2e-6 H/m)
- G = 0, so no conductance, which probably means we can ignore some losses.
- C = 5.56 microfarads/m (5.56e-6 F/m)
- Length of the line (l) = 100 meters.
- Terminated in a resistance (RL) of 300 ohms.

Efficiency is P_load / P_supplied. So I need to find both the power delivered to the load and the power supplied at the input.

Wait, but I remember that in transmission lines, the key is the characteristic impedance and whether the line is matched or not. If it's matched, then there's no reflection, and maximum power is transferred. But if it's not matched, some power is reflected, and the efficiency would be less than 100%.

So first, I should calculate the characteristic impedance (Z0) of the line. The formula for Z0 is sqrt(L/C), because for a lossless line, Z0 = sqrt((L/jωC)), but since ω is in there and R and G are zero, maybe in this case the line is lossless. Wait, but R is given as 0.025 ohm/m. Oh wait, but in the problem, G is zero. So we have some series resistance but no shunt conductance. So maybe it's a lossy line, but perhaps for simplicity, we can consider the lossless case first? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for the phase velocity is 1/sqrt(LC), but maybe I need that for something else. Let's focus on the characteristic impedance first.

Z0 = sqrt( (R + jωL) / (G + jωC) )

But since G is zero, and R is given, but wait, when the line is not lossless, the Z0 becomes sqrt( (R + jωL) / (jωC) ). That complicates things a bit. But for most cases, when R is much smaller than ωL, which is often true, we can approximate Z0 as sqrt(L/C), which would be a real number. Let me check if R is negligible compared to ωL.

So ω is 2πf. f is 4e6 Hz. So ω = 2π * 4e6 ≈ 25.13e6 rad/s.

L is 2e-6 H/m, so ωL per meter is 25.13e6 * 2e-6 = 50.26 ohms/m.

R is 0.025 ohm/m. So 0.025 vs 50, R is much smaller. So the approximation Z0 ≈ sqrt(L/C) is valid.

So compute Z0: sqrt( (2e-6) / (5.56e-6) ) = sqrt( (2)/(5.56) ) ≈ sqrt(0.36) = 0.6 ohms. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 2e-6 divided by 5.56e-6 is 2/5.56 = approximately 0.36. The square root of 0.36 is 0.6, so Z0 is 0.6 ohms. That seems quite low, but okay.

Now, the line is 100 meters long. So the total inductance would be L_total = 2e-6 * 100 = 2e-4 H. Similarly for R_total = 0.025 * 100 = 2.5 ohms.

But wait, what about the line being terminated in RL=300 ohms. So the load is RL=300. But the Z0 is 0.6 ohms. That's a big mismatch because RL >> Z0. So that would cause a lot of reflection, right? So the standing wave ratio would be high, meaning that a lot of the power is reflected back, and the efficiency would be low. But wait, that depends on the characteristic impedance and the load.

But wait, efficiency is defined as the ratio of power delivered to the load over the power supplied. So when there's a mismatch, some power is reflected, and thus the efficiency is less than 1.

Wait, but how do I calculate the power delivered to the load and the power supplied?

Alternatively, I remember that the efficiency can be calculated using the formula: η = (4 R_L Z0) / ( (R_L + Z0)^2 + (R_L Z0 (γ)^2) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the reflection coefficient.

Wait, the reflection coefficient Γ is (RL - Z0)/(RL + Z0). So Γ = (300 - 0.6)/(300 + 0.6) ≈ (299.4)/(300.6) ≈ 0.9956. So that's a high reflection coefficient, meaning most of the power is reflected.

But wait, how does that translate to power? The incident power is the power supplied by the source, but some is reflected, and some is transmitted into the load. The power delivered to the load is the transmitted power.

In terms of voltage reflection, the reflection coefficient is Γ, so the reflected voltage is Γ times the incident voltage. But power is related to the square of the voltage, so the reflected power is |Γ|^2 times the incident power.

Wait, let's think about it. Let me denote the incident power as P_inc, the reflected power as P_ref, and the transmitted (delivered) as P_trans.

In a lossless line, P_inc = P_ref + P_trans. But since the line has some R, there are losses as well. But wait, in this problem, the line has R, but G=0. So the line has series resistance but no shunt conductance. So the line is lossy, but I'm not sure how that affects the overall calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the line as lossless because R is small, but that might not be the case. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem gives R as 0.025 ohm/m, L as 2 microhenry/m, C as 5.56 microfarad/m, and the line is 100 meters long. So perhaps we need to compute the propagation constant γ, which is sqrt( (R + jωL)(G + jωC) ). But since G=0, it's sqrt( (R + jωL)(jωC) ). Let's compute that.

Wait, γ = α + jβ, where α is the attenuation constant and β is the phase constant.

But maybe I should compute the input impedance Zin of the line, and then find the power supplied and the power delivered.

Wait, the input impedance of a transmission line is Zin = Z0 * (ZL + Z0 tanh(γ l)) / (Z0 + ZL tanh(γ l)) ). But when the line is lossy, the hyperbolic functions come into play.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe we can treat the line as lossless (since R is small compared to ωL) and compute the efficiency based on the reflection.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the standing wave ratio (SWR) and then find the efficiency based on that.

Wait, SWR is S = (1 + |Γ|)/(1 - |Γ|). Here, Γ is about 0.9956, so S ≈ (1 + 0.9956)/(1 - 0.9956) ) = (1.9956)/(0.0044) ≈ 453. That's a very high SWR, meaning a very mismatched load.

But how does SWR relate to efficiency? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to find the power loss due to the mismatch.

Wait, when a line is mismatched, some of the power is reflected, but in a lossless line, the reflected power is just sent back, so the power delivered to the load is P_inc * (1 - |Γ|^2). Wait, because the reflected power is P_ref = |Γ|^2 * P_inc, so the transmitted power is P_trans = P_inc (1 - |Γ|^2). So the efficiency in that case would be (1 - |Γ|^2) times any losses in the line.

But wait, if the line is lossless (R=0), then the efficiency would just be (1 - |Γ|^2). But in this case, the line has R, so there's attenuation along the line, i.e., the signal loses some power as it travels along the line.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Compute the characteristic impedance Z0.
2. Compute the reflection coefficient Γ.
3. Compute the input impedance Zin, considering the length of the line and the termination.
4. Find the power supplied at the input, which would involve the source voltage and Zin.
5. Find the power delivered to the load, which would be the power transmitted through the line without reflection.
6. The efficiency is (P_load) / (P_supplied).

But perhaps there's a simpler way using the reflection coefficient and the loss in the line.

Wait, another approach: For a transmission line with a given Z0 and a load RL, the power delivered to the load can be found using the formula:

P_load = (V^2 / RL) * (4 Z0 RL) / ( (Z0 + RL)^2 + (Z0 RL (γ)^2) )) 

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for maximum power transfer. Wait, maximum power occurs when RL equals Z0, but in this case, RL is 300, Z0 is 0.6, so it's way off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the input impedance Zin, then find the power supplied as (V^2)/(2 Zin), and the power delivered as (V_load^2)/(2 RL). But to find V_load, I need to consider the voltage drop along the line.

Alternatively, the voltage at the load end is V_load = V_inc * e^{-γ l} * (1 + Γ), where Γ is the reflection coefficient. Hmm, but I'm not confident about that approach.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the attenuation constant α and phase constant β. Let's compute γ first.

γ = sqrt( (R + jωL) * (G + jωC) )

Since G=0,

γ = sqrt( (R + jωL) * jωC )

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute (R + jωL) = 0.025 + j*(25.13e6)*(2e-6) = 0.025 + j*(0.05026) ≈ 0.025 + j0.05026.

Multiply this by jωC: (0.025 + j0.05026) * j * 25.13e6 * 5.56e-6.

Wait, let me compute jωC first. ωC = 25.13e6 * 5.56e-6 = approx 25.13 * 5.56 = around 140 (because 25 *5 is 125, and 25*0.56=14, so about 139. So 139 rad/s per farad? Wait, no, ωC is in rad/s * F. But since C is per meter, and we have 100 meters, perhaps the total C is 5.56e-6 *100=5.56e-4 F. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute γ numerically.

Let me compute each part:

(R + jωL) = 0.025 + j * (2π*4e6) * 2e-6.

Wait, f =4e6 Hz, so ω=2π*4e6 ≈25.1327e6 rad/s.

So R =0.025 ohm/m.

ωL = 25.1327e6 * 2e-6 = 50.2654 ohm/m.

So R + jωL = 0.025 + j50.2654.

Now, G + jωC = jωC, since G=0.

So jωC = j *25.1327e6 *5.56e-6 = j * (25.1327e6 *5.56e-6) 

Calculating 25.1327e6 *5.56e-6: 25.1327 *5.56 = let's compute 25 *5=125, 25*0.56=14, so 25*5.56=139. Then 0.1327*5.56 ≈ 0.737, so total about 139.737. So 139.737, so jωC = j * 139.737 ≈ j139.737.

So now, the product (R + jωL)(G + jωC) is (0.025 + j50.2654) * (j139.737).

Let me compute this multiplication.

Multiply 0.025 by j139.737: 0.025 * j139.737 ≈ j3.4934.

Then j50.2654 * j139.737 = j^2 *50.2654*139.737 = (-1)* (50.2654 *139.737 ). Let's compute 50 *140 =7000, so approximately 50.2654*139.737≈ ~7025. So this term is -7025.

So overall, the product is (-7025) + j3.4934.

Now, γ is the square root of this. So sqrt(-7025 + j3.4934). Hmm, that's a complex number, so the square root will give us a complex γ = α + jβ.

But calculating the square root of a complex number is a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate, considering that the real part is much larger in magnitude than the imaginary part.

Wait, the product (R + jωL)(G + jωC) is (-7025 + j3.4934). So when taking the square root, since the real part is negative and much larger in magnitude than the imaginary part, the square root will be a complex number with a large real part (attenuation) and a small imaginary part (phase).

But perhaps the line is electrically long, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this approach is getting too complicated, and perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, another thought: Since the line has R, L, C, but G=0, and the frequency is high, perhaps the line is operating in the distortionless condition, where the attenuation per unit length is the same for all frequencies. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the line's loss can be considered as the sum of the series resistance and shunt conductance, but since G=0, perhaps the loss is only due to R.

Wait, but how would that affect the efficiency? Efficiency is the ratio of power delivered to the load over the power supplied. So:

η = (P_load) / (P_supplied).

But P_supplied is the power at the input, which is the sum of the power lost in the line plus the power delivered to the load, assuming no reflection. Wait, no, because with reflection, some power is sent back, so that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the line as having a certain attenuation, and the reflection causes additional loss.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the attenuation constant α and the phase constant β. Since γ = α + jβ, and the line's loss is determined by α.

Wait, but let's get back to computing γ. We've got γ^2 = (R + jωL)(jωC). We found that (R + jωL)(jωC) ≈ -7025 + j3.4934.

So γ = sqrt(-7025 + j3.4934). Let me compute this.

Let me represent this complex number in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(7025^2 + 3.4934^2) ≈ sqrt(7025^2 + ~12.19) ≈ 7025.0017. The angle θ is arctangent(3.4934 / (-7025)) which is approximately arctan( -0.000497). So θ is approximately -0.000497 radians, very close to π radians (180 degrees), because the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive (but very small).

So the square root of a complex number with magnitude ~7025 and angle ~π is a complex number with magnitude sqrt(7025) ≈ 83.8 and angle ~π/2, because sqrt(r e^{jθ}) = sqrt(r) e^{jθ/2}.

So θ/2 would be approximately π/2, so the square root is approximately 83.8 e^{jπ/2} = 83.8 (cos(π/2) + j sin(π/2)) ) = 83.8 j.

So γ ≈ 83.8 j. Wait, but that would imply that the attenuation constant α is zero, and β is 83.8 rad/m. That can't be right because we have R present, so there should be some attenuation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computation.

Wait, because (R + jωL)(jωC) is a complex number with real part negative and a small positive imaginary part. So when taking the square root, the result would have a real part and an imaginary part, both positive or negative depending on the quadrant.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me use the formula for square root of a complex number.

For a complex number z = a + jb, where a < 0 and b > 0 (second quadrant), the square root is given by:

sqrt(z) = sqrt( (|z| + a)/2 ) * ( b / sqrt( (|z| + a)/2 ) + j )

Wait, more accurately, the square root of a complex number z can be expressed as:

sqrt(z) = ± [ sqrt( (|z| + Re(z))/2 ) + sign(Im(z)) sqrt( (|z| - Re(z))/2 ) j ]

In this case, Re(z) is negative and Im(z) is positive, so the angle is in the second quadrant. So the square root would be in the second quadrant as well, meaning negative real part and positive
