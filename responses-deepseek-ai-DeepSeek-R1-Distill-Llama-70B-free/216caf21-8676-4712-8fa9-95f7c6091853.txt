Question:

A salesman for the Filler Brush Company is compensated for his auto costs at a rate of 8\textcent a mile. His fixed costs are $500 and he has a variable cost of 5\textcent a mile. How many miles would he have to travel in order to break even (cover expenses), yet still earn no profit over fixed costs?

Options:

A: 30,000 miles
B: 18,000 miles
C: 14,000 miles
D: 15,000 miles
E: 12,500 miles
F: 16,667 miles
G: 20,000 miles
H: 25,000 miles
I: 17,500 miles
J: 22,000 miles

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a salesman who gets compensated for his auto costs at 8 cents a mile. He has some fixed and variable costs, and we need to find out how many miles he needs to travel to break even, meaning cover his expenses without making a profit.

First, I should probably list out all the given information. The compensation rate is 8 cents per mile. His fixed costs are $500, which I assume are monthly or some period, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it doesn't matter. The variable cost is 5 cents a mile. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the salesman is being reimbursed 8 cents for every mile he drives. But he also has his own costs, which are variable at 5 cents per mile. So, his net gain per mile would be the compensation minus his variable cost. Because for each mile he drives, he gets 8 cents but spends 5 cents, so he makes 3 cents per mile. 

But wait, is that correct? Let me think. The company pays him 8 cents per mile, which I think is his revenue. His costs are fixed at $500 and variable at 5 cents per mile. So, the total cost is fixed + variable per mile multiplied by miles. 

The total revenue would be 8 cents per mile times miles. To break even, total revenue must equal total costs. So, the equation would be:

Revenue = Total Costs
(0.08 * miles) = 500 + (0.05 * miles)

Hmm, that makes sense. So, let me write that out:

0.08m = 500 + 0.05m

Where m is the number of miles. Now, I can subtract 0.05m from both sides to get:

0.03m = 500

Then, to find m, divide both sides by 0.03:

m = 500 / 0.03

Calculating that, 500 divided by 0.03. Let's see, 0.03 times 16,666 is 500, because 0.03 * 16,666.666... is approximately 500. So, m is approximately 16,666.67 miles. Since you can't drive a fraction of a mile, you'd round up, but in the options, I see F is 16,667 miles, which matches.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 500 divided by 0.03.

0.03 goes into 500 how many times? 0.03 times 10,000 is 300. 0.03 times 15,000 is 450. 0.03 times 16,666 is 500 because 16,666 * 0.03 = 500 (exactly, because 16,666.666... is 50,000/3). So yes, 16,666.666..., which is 16,666 and two-thirds miles. So the closest option is F:16,667 miles.

So the answer should be F.

To determine how many miles the salesman must travel to break even, we set up the equation where total revenue equals total costs. The revenue is 8 cents per mile, and the total costs include fixed costs ($500) plus variable costs (5 cents per mile). 

The equation is:
\[
0.08m = 500 + 0.05m
\]
Subtracting \(0.05m\) from both sides:
\[
0.03m = 500
\]
Solving for \(m\):
\[
m = \frac{500}{0.03} \approx 16,666.67
\]
Rounding up, the salesman must travel approximately 16,667 miles. The closest option is F: 16,667 miles.

Answer: F
