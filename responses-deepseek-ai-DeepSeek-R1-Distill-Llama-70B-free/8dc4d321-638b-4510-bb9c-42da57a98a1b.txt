Question:

A woman needed to have her microwave repaired. She contacted the local handyman, who said he could repair the microwave for $100. The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if the handyman does not pay the repair bill.
B: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman and the repair store, but only if the repair is not completed on time.
C: The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.
D: The woman has no cause of action as she agreed to the repair without a specific completion date.
E: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if they knew she was the true owner of the microwave.
F: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.
G: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman, but only if the microwave is not repaired.
H: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.
I: The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.
J: The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman, but only if the handyman fails to pay the repair bill.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, I think. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the scenario.

A woman needs her microwave repaired. She contacts a handyman who quotes her $100 and says he'll have it ready in two weeks. She agrees and gives him the microwave. Then, a week later, the handyman realizes he's too busy, so he takes it to a repair store. The repair store agrees to fix it for $80 and within a week. The store owner didn't know the woman owns the microwave. Now, the question is, if the repair store fails to repair it, what's the situation legally?

The options are A to J, each giving a different scenario about who the woman can sue. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I think about the contracts involved. The woman contracted directly with the handyman. So there's a contract between them. The handyman then contracts with the repair store. So the repair store is a subcontractor, I suppose, but the woman isn't a party to that second contract.

If the repair store fails, who is liable? Well, the handyman is the one who took the microwave and agreed to fix it. So the primary contract is between the woman and the handyman. The handyman is responsible for the repair. If the repair store doesn't do their job, does that affect the handyman's responsibility?

Wait, the handyman is the one who took on the obligation to the woman. So if the repair store fails, the handyman is still on the hook because he's the one who agreed to fix it. The woman's rights are against the handyman, not the repair store, unless maybe the repair store did something wrong that directly affects her.

But the repair store didn't contract with the woman, so she can't sue them for breach of contract. Unless there's some other basis, like negligence or something else. But the question is about a cause of action, so I'm focusing on contract law here.

Alternatively, maybe the repair store's failure could be a breach of their contract with the handyman, but the woman isn't a party to that. So the handyman could sue the repair store, but the woman can't. So her cause of action would be against the handyman for not fulfilling his contract with her.

Looking at the options, option H says the woman has a cause of action against the handyman only. That makes sense because the handyman is the one who owes her the duty to repair. The repair store's obligation is to the handyman, not her.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the repair store fails to repair, so the handyman can't deliver. The handyman is in breach of contract with the woman. So the woman can sue the handyman. But does she have any claim against the repair store?

I don't think so. The repair store didn't contract with her, so unless there's a third-party beneficiary situation, which I don't think applies here. The handyman might have a claim against the repair store, but the woman doesn't.

So the answer should be that she can sue the handyman only. Looking at the options, option H says that.

The woman contracted directly with the handyman for the repair of her microwave. The handyman, in turn, subcontracted the repair to the repair store. The woman's contractual rights are solely against the handyman, as he is the party who undertook the obligation to repair the microwave. The repair store's obligation is to the handyman, not the woman, and she is not a party to that contract. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, the handyman is still responsible for fulfilling his contract with the woman. The woman does not have a cause of action against the repair store because there is no direct contractual relationship between them. Therefore, the woman's only recourse is against the handyman for breach of contract.

The correct answer is:

H: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.

Answer: H
