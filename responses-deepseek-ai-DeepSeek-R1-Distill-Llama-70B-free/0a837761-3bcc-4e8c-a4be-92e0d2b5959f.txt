Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the economic definition of "labor." Let me start by recalling what I know about economics. I remember that in economics, the factors of production are land, labor, capital, and sometimes entrepreneurship. So labor must be one of these key components.

The question is asking for the definition, and the options are A through J. I'll go through each option one by one to see which fits best.

Option A says activities related to hiring and managing employees only. Hmm, that sounds more like human resources or management, not the actual labor itself. So probably not A.

Option B is the capital invested in businesses for production. Wait, capital is another factor of production, so B isn't labor. Capital refers to money or resources invested, so B is out.

Option C is the use of machinery and technology exclusively. That sounds more like capital goods or technology, which is part of capital, not labor. So C isn't right.

Option D says only physical work. I think labor includes both physical and mental work. Like, a teacher does mental work but is still part of the labor force. So D is too narrow.

Option E is only mental work. Similarly, this is also too narrow because labor includes both physical and mental efforts. So E isn't correct either.

Option F states all human abilities or talents used in producing goods or services. That sounds right. Labor would encompass any human effort, whether physical or mental, that contributes to production. So F seems like a strong candidate.

Option G is the process of developing and executing business strategies without direct human involvement. That doesn't sound right. It's more about management or maybe technology, but not labor as a factor of production. So G is probably not correct.

Option H is work by entrepreneurs only. Entrepreneurs are a specific group, and labor includes all workers, not just entrepreneurs. So H is too limited.

Option I says the exchange of services between businesses without involving human effort. That doesn't make sense because labor inherently involves human effort. So I is incorrect.

Option J is natural resources exploited for production. Natural resources fall under land, another factor of production, not labor. So J is out.

Putting it all together, the correct answer must be F because it includes all human abilities, both physical and mental, used in production.

The economic definition of labor encompasses all human efforts, both physical and mental, that contribute to the production of goods and services. It is one of the key factors of production and is not limited to specific types of work or individuals. 

Option F correctly captures this definition by stating that labor involves all human abilities or talents used in production.

Answer: F
