Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about which culture was known as the temple-mound builders and based their subsistence primarily on maize and squash agriculture. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question mentions "temple-mound builders." I remember that in North American archaeology, several cultures are known for building mounds, but the term "temple-mound" specifically might refer to a certain group. I think the Mississippian culture is often associated with large earthen pyramid mounds, which were used for ceremonial and political purposes. So that's a point towards option E.

Next, the question asks about their subsistence being primarily maize and squash. Maize, or corn, was a staple crop in many pre-Columbian societies. The Mississippian culture was indeed known for their agriculture, relying heavily on maize, beans, and squash. These were the "Three Sisters" that many Eastern Woodlands cultures grew. So that aligns with the subsistence part.

Now, I should consider the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Let's go through them:

A: Hohokam - They were in the Southwest, known for irrigation and red-on-buff pottery. Their main crops might have included maize but I'm not sure if they're the temple-mound builders in question.

B: Folsom - I think Folsom is associated with Paleoindian cultures, known for their spear points. They were hunter-gatherers, not agriculturalists.

C: Adena - Adena built mounds too, but I believe they were earlier, part of the Eastern Woodlands, and perhaps more focused on burial mounds rather than temples. Their economy might have been more mixed, with some agriculture but not as reliant as Mississippian.

D: Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) - They're in the Southwest, known for cliff dwellings and maize, but they didn't build the large temple mounds like the Mississippian.

E: Mississippian - As I thought earlier, this fits. They built the big mounds, like at Cahokia, and their economy was based on maize agriculture.

F: Clovis - Another Paleoindian group, known for big game hunting, not agriculture.

G: Moundville - I think Moundville is actually a Mississippian site, so it's part of the same culture as option E. So G might be a trick option here.

H: Poverty Point - This is an earlier culture, known for building large earthworks, but I think they were more of a hunter-gatherer society, not primarily agricultural.

I: Fremont - They were in the Great Basin region, known for maize but also had a mixed economy. Not sure about the mounds.

J: Hopewell - Another Eastern Woodlands culture, known for their earthworks and trade networks. They might have had some agriculture but perhaps not as central as Mississippian.

So putting it all together, the Mississippian culture (option E) fits because they built temple mounds and relied on maize and squash agriculture. I think that's the correct answer.

The culture known as the temple-mound builders, which based their subsistence primarily on maize and squash agriculture, is the Mississippian culture. They are famous for constructing large earthen mounds, such as those found at Cahokia, which served ceremonial and political purposes. Their economy heavily relied on the "Three Sisters": maize, beans, and squash. Other options, like Adena or Hopewell, were associated with mounds but not primarily focused on maize agriculture to the same extent. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: Mississippian

Answer: E
