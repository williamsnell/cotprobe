Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about polarized light and intensity reduction. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question involves a polarizer and an analyzer, which are Nicol prisms. When light passes through them, the intensity depends on the angle between their principal planes. The formula I remember for the transmitted intensity after the analyzer is I = I0 * cos²(theta), where theta is the angle between the polarizer and analyzer.

Wait, but wait. In this problem, the analyzer is rotated through 10 degrees in both cases. So for each part, the initial angle is given, and then the angle increases by 10 degrees. So I need to calculate the intensity before and after the rotation, and then find the percentage reduction.

Let me break it down. The initial intensity, I_initial, is when the angle is theta_initial. After rotation, the angle becomes theta_final = theta_initial + 10 degrees. The transmitted intensity after rotation, I_final, is I0 * cos²(theta_final). The percentage reduction would be [(I_initial - I_final) / I_initial] * 100%.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait a second. Because the initial setup is before rotation, so the initial intensity is I_initial = I0 cos²(theta_initial). After rotating, the angle is theta_initial + 10 degrees, so I_final = I0 cos²(theta_initial + 10). The reduction is (I_initial - I_final) / I_initial * 100% = [1 - (cos(theta_final)/cos(theta_initial))^2 ] * 100%. Or wait, no, the I_initial is I0 cos²(theta_initial), and I_final is I0 cos²(theta_final). So the ratio is [I_final / I_initial] = [cos²(theta_final) / cos²(theta_initial)].

Wait, no, actually, the question is about the percentage reduction, so it's (I_initial - I_final) / I_initial * 100%. So that's [ (I_initial - I_final) / I_initial ] * 100 = (1 - (I_final/I_initial)) * 100.

But I_final = I_initial * [cos(theta_final)/cos(theta_initial)]², because I_initial is I0 cos²(theta_initial), I_final is I0 cos²(theta_final). So I_final/I_initial = [cos(theta_final)/cos(theta_initial)]².

So the percentage reduction is [1 - (cos(theta_final)^2 / cos(theta_initial)^2)] * 100.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because I_initial is I0 cos²(theta_initial), and I_final is I0 cos²(theta_final). So the ratio I_final/I_initial is [cos(theta_final)/cos(theta_initial)]². So the reduction is 1 - [cos(theta_final)/cos(theta_initial)]², multiplied by 100 to get percentage.

Ok, so for each case, I need to compute that.

Let me do part a first.

a) Initially, the principal planes are at 20 degrees apart. Then the analyzer is rotated 10 degrees, so the angle becomes 30 degrees.

So theta_initial =20°, theta_final=30°.

Compute the ratio [cos(30)/cos(20)]².

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the cos values.

cos(20°) ≈ 0.9397

cos(30°) ≈ 0.8660

So [0.8660 / 0.9397]^2 ≈ (0.921)² ≈ 0.848.

So I_final/I_initial is approximately 0.848. So the reduction is 1 - 0.848 = 0.152, which is 15.2% reduction. Hmm, but looking at the options, that's not matching any exactly. The options are A:25,75; B:20,80; C:17,50; etc. Wait, option I is 15%, 74.2% for a and b. So maybe my calculation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the cos values.

Let me compute more accurately.

cos(20 degrees) is approx 0.9396926

cos(30 degrees) is approx 0.8660254

So 0.8660254 / 0.9396926 = approx 0.92106.

Squaring that gives (0.92106)^2 = approx 0.8479.

So 1-0.8479=0.1521, so 15.21% reduction. So about 15% for part a.

But looking at the options, option I for part a is 15% and part b 74.2%, which matches one of the options.

Wait, part b is when the initial angle is 70 degrees, then rotated to 80 degrees.

So for part b, theta_initial=70°, theta_final=80°.

Compute [cos(80)/cos(70)]².

cos(70) is approx 0.3420, cos(80) approx 0.1736.

So the ratio is (0.1736 / 0.3420) = 0.5075.

Square that: 0.2576.

So I_final/I_initial is about 0.2576, so the reduction is 1-0.2576=0.7424, which is 74.24%. So that's approximately 74.2% reduction.

So part a is about 15% reduction, part b about 74.2% reduction.

Looking at the options, option I says a) 15%, b) 74.2%. So option I is the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the way the angle increases is from the initial.

Wait, the question says: "the angle is increased after rotation." So initial is 20°, then rotated 10°, making it 30°. So that's correct.

Another check: for a), 20° to 30°, so the formula is [cos(30)/cos(20)]².

As I did before, that gives ~15% reduction.

So the answer is option I.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the transmitted intensity after passing through a polarizer and analyzer: 

\[
I = I_0 \cos^2(\theta),
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the principal planes of the polarizer and analyzer. The percentage reduction in intensity when the analyzer is rotated is given by:

\[
\text{Percentage Reduction} = \left[ 1 - \frac{\cos^2(\theta_{\text{final}})}{\cos^2(\theta_{\text{initial}})} \right] \times 100.
\]

### Part (a): Initial angle = \(20^\circ\), Final angle = \(30^\circ\)
1. Compute \(\cos(20^\circ) \approx 0.9397\) and \(\cos(30^\circ) \approx 0.8660\).
2. Calculate the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{\cos(30^\circ)}{\cos(20^\circ)} = \frac{0.8660}{0.9397} \approx 0.921.
   \]
3. Square the ratio:
   \[
   \left( 0.921 \right)^2 \approx 0.8479.
   \]
4. Compute the percentage reduction:
   \[
   1 - 0.8479 = 0.1521 \implies 15.21\%.
   \]

### Part (b): Initial angle = \(70^\circ\), Final angle = \(80^\circ\)
1. Compute \(\cos(70^\circ) \approx 0.3420\) and \(\cos(80^\circ) \approx 0.1736\).
2. Calculate the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{\cos(80^\circ)}{\cos(70^\circ)} = \frac{0.1736}{0.3420} \approx 0.5075.
   \]
3. Square the ratio:
   \[
   \left( 0.5075 \right)^2 \approx 0.2576.
   \]
4. Compute the percentage reduction:
   \[
   1 - 0.2576 = 0.7424 \implies 74.24\%.
   \]

### Final Answer
For part (a), the percentage reduction is approximately \(15\%\), and for part (b), it is approximately \(74.2\%\). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**I: 15%, 74.2%**
