The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Immediately after a shooting incident, the police chased one of the shooters into an apartment where he was apprehended and arrested. While in the apartment, a detective noticed some antique furniture that seemed of collectors' quality and was out of place in the squalidly furnished quarters. He moved and turned over the pieces to look for markings and insignia. He called headquarters, and was told that items with those markings and descriptions were stolen from a museum six months earlier. He seized the items and arrested another occupant, who claimed he owned the items, on charges of burglary. That suspect filed a motion to suppress based on there being a warrantless search without probable cause. The police relied on the plain view doctrine. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?

Options:

A: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the officer did not immediately recognize the items as stolen property.
B: No, the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate it further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances.
C: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the items were stolen.
D: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the officer was in a place where he was legally allowed to be when he observed the antique furniture.
E: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply to items that are not immediately identifiable as contraband or evidence of a crime.
F: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the police had no warrant to search the apartment for additional evidence.
G: No, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.
H: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe that the observed item was contraband.
I: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the police can never search a personal residence or seize any unrelated items after entering for exigent circumstances dealing with something else.
J: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the plain view doctrine allows an officer to seize any item that he or she believes is evidence of a crime.

Okay, so I've got this question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the plain view doctrine. Hmm, I remember that the plain view doctrine allows police to seize evidence without a warrant if certain conditions are met. Let me think through this step by step.

So the scenario is that after a shooting, police chase a shooter into an apartment and arrest him. While there, a detective notices some antique furniture that looks out of place. He moves the pieces to look for markings, calls HQ, and finds out they were stolen from a museum. He seizes the items and arrests another occupant who claims ownership. The suspect is challenging the seizure, arguing it was an unlawful warrantless search without probable cause. The police are relying on the plain view doctrine.

The question is whether the court will suppress the evidence. The options are from A to J.

Let me recall the elements of the plain view doctrine. From what I remember, for the plain view doctrine to apply, three main conditions must be satisfied:

1. The officer must be lawfully present at the place where the evidence is in plain view. So, the officer needs to be where he has a right to be.

2. The officer must have a lawful right of access to the object itself. This might relate to whether moving the object or looking at it closely requires a warrant, but I'm a bit fuzzy here.

3. The incriminating nature of the object must be immediately apparent. The officer must have probable cause to believe the object is contraband or evidence of a crime without needing further investigation.

In this case, the officer was lawfully in the apartment because he was chasing a suspect under exigent circumstances (the shooting and chase). So condition 1 is satisfied.

Condition 2: The officer moved the furniture to look for markings. Wait, does moving the furniture count as a search? If the furniture was in plain view, maybe just looking at it is okay, but moving it might be crossing a line. I'm not sure. Also, the officer called HQ and only then learned the items were stolen. So at the time of moving, did he have probable cause?

Condition 3: The incriminating nature must be immediately apparent. At the moment the officer saw the furniture, he thought it looked out of place but didn't know it was stolen. It was after he moved them and checked the markings that he discovered they were stolen. So when he moved them, he didn't yet have probable cause. That might be a problem.

Wait, but in some cases, if an officer has a reasonable suspicion, they might be allowed to conduct a limited search. Or does the plain view doctrine require immediate recognition without further investigation?

I think the key here is that the officer didn't immediately recognize the items as stolen. He had to move them and check, and even call for more information. So when he moved the furniture, he didn't have probable cause yet. Therefore, moving the furniture might have been an unlawful search because the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, evidence suppressed because officer didn't immediately recognize items as stolen. This aligns with the idea that the plain view requires immediate recognition.

Option B: No, because officer had right to investigate further. But if he wasn't lawfully present or didn't have probable cause, this might not hold.

Option C: No, because reasonable suspicion. But plain view needs probable cause, not just reasonable suspicion.

Option D: No, because officer was legally present. But being present doesn't automatically allow seizure without probable cause.

Option E: Yes, because plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable. This seems correct because the officer didn't know they were stolen until after investigating.

Option F: Yes, because no warrant. But the plain view doesn't require a warrant if the conditions are met, so this is incorrect reasoning.

Option G: No, because plain view and reasonable suspicion. Again, plain view needs probable cause, not just suspicion.

Option H: Yes, because no probable cause. Because the officer didn't have probable cause until after the fact, this could be correct.

Option I: Yes, because can't search personal residence after exigent circumstances. That's too broad; exigent circumstances allow some searches.

Option J: No, because plain view allows seizure if believed to be evidence. But this is too broad because the belief must be based on immediate recognition.

So the main issue is whether the incriminating nature was immediately apparent. Since the officer had to move the furniture and check, it wasn't immediately apparent. Therefore, the seizure would be invalid under the plain view doctrine.

Looking at the options, both A and E and H discuss this. Let me read them again.

Option A: Evidence suppressed because officer didn't immediately recognize. That's correct.

Option E: Plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable. Also correct.

Option H: Plain view doesn't apply without probable cause. Also correct.

Wait, but the elements: the incriminating nature must be immediately apparent, which requires probable cause.

So, the officer didn't have probable cause at the time of seizure because he didn't know they were stolen until after. So the seizure was without probable cause, violating the Fourth Amendment.

So the correct answer would be that the evidence is suppressed because the plain view doctrine wasn't applicableâ€”either because the items weren't immediately identifiable (Option E) or because there was no probable cause (Option H or A).

Wait, looking back, in the scenario, the officer called headquarters and was told the items were stolen. So he had probable cause after that call. But when he moved the furniture, he didn't yet have that info. So moving the furniture to find markings might have been a search that required probable cause.

Wait, but can the officer's action of moving the furniture to check for markings be considered a search? If so, then without probable cause, it's an unlawful search.

Alternatively, if the furniture was in plain view, perhaps he could look, but not move it. So moving it might have been a trespass beyond the plain view.

Alternatively, if the furniture was in plain view, moving it to inspect for markings may require probable cause. Because under the plain view doctrine, the officer can seize the item without a warrant if the three conditions are met. But moving the item to find evidence might be a search if it's not in plain sight.

Wait, another point: the officer was in the apartment legally because of exigent circumstances. So he can observe things in plain view. But moving the furniture might be a search unless it's necessary for officer safety or part of an inventory.

But in this case, the officer moved the furniture to look for markings. That might be a search because it's an intrusion into the item. So without probable cause, that might be a problem.

Wait, but in the case where an officer is lawfully present and sees something suspicious, can he touch or move it to check for markings? I think that moving the item might constitute a search, which would require probable cause. So if he didn't have probable cause at the time he moved it, then that's an unlawful search.

So the officer didn't have probable cause until after he moved the furniture and got the info. So moving the furniture was a search without probable cause.

Alternatively, under the plain view doctrine, the incriminating nature must be immediately apparent. Since he needed to move it to find the markings, the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent.

Therefore, the plain view doctrine doesn't apply, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options, option E says the plain view doctrine doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable as contraband. Option A says because the officer didn't immediately recognize them as stolen. Both seem correct.

Option H says the doctrine doesn't apply where officer had no probable cause to believe the item was contraband. That's also correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The Supreme Court case I remember is Horton v. California, which held that if an officer is lawfully present and an object is in plain view, the officer may seize it if he has probable cause to believe it's contraband. So the key elements are lawful presence, probable cause, and plain view.

In this case, the officer was lawfully present. But did he have probable cause when he seized the items? He had probable cause only after checking with headquarters. So when he moved the furniture, he didn't have probable cause yet. Therefore, moving the furniture to find the markings was a search without probable cause, making the seizure invalid.

So the plain view doctrine doesn't apply because the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent. Therefore, the evidence would be suppressed.

So looking at the options again, the correct answer would be either A, E, or H.

Option E states that the plain view doctrine doesn't apply because the items weren't immediately identifiable. That's correct.

Option H says the doctrine doesn't apply because the officer had no probable cause. But the officer did obtain probable cause after the call, but the seizure happened after that. Wait, when did he seize the items? The scenario says he moved the pieces, called HQ, then seized them after being told they were stolen. So the seizure happened after he had probable cause.

Wait, so the movement to check for markings was done before he had probable cause. So was moving the furniture a search? If moving the furniture was a search, then without probable cause, it's unlawful. But if moving was part of the plain view, then perhaps it's allowed.

Alternatively, once he saw the furniture, he had a reasonable suspicion that it might be stolen because it looked out of place. But reasonable suspicion allows for a Terry stop, not a full search.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to break it down:

1. Officer lawfully present in the apartment due to exigent circumstances.

2. Sees furniture that looks out of place (antique, collector's quality in a squalid apartment). So he has a reason to suspect it's stolen.

3. He moves the furniture to look for markings, which requires some handling. Is this a search?

If moving the furniture to look for markings is a search, then without probable cause, it's invalid. Because he only had reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, at that point.

But the plain view doctrine requires that the incriminating nature be immediately apparent without the need for further search. So if the officer needs to manipulate the object to discover its contraband nature, then the plain view doctrine doesn't apply.

So in this case, the officer had to move the furniture to find the markings. Therefore, the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent, so plain view doesn't apply. Thus, the evidence should be suppressed.

So the correct answer would be E or H.

Option E says the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable as contraband. That fits.

Option H says because the officer had no probable cause to believe the observed item was contraband. At the time he moved the furniture, he didn't have probable cause, so that's correct.

Wait, but after moving and checking, he did get probable cause. So the seizure happened after he had probable cause, but the initial moving was a search without probable cause, which might have tainted the evidence.

Hmm, but does the initial moving constitute an unlawful search? If so, then any evidence obtained from that search (the markings) would be tainted, making the seizure unlawful.

Alternatively, if the officer's movement of the furniture was a minimal intrusion and based on reasonable suspicion, maybe it's permissible. But I think the case law requires probable cause for the seizure under plain view, and the incriminating nature must be immediately apparent without further search.

So the correct reasoning is that the plain view doctrine doesn't apply because the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent. Therefore, the evidence would be suppressed.

Looking back, option E says exactly that. So the answer should be E.
</think>

The plain view doctrine allows police to seize evidence without a warrant if three conditions are met: (1) the officer is lawfully present, (2) the object is in plain view, and (3) its incriminating nature is immediately apparent. In this case, the officer was lawfully in the apartment due to exigent circumstances, satisfying the first condition. However, the incriminating nature of the antique furniture was not immediately apparent. The officer had to move the furniture to look for markings and later called headquarters to confirm it was stolen. This indicates that the incriminating nature was not obvious at first glance, violating the third condition of the plain view doctrine. 

Without immediate recognition of the items as contraband or evidence of a crime, the officer's actions in moving the furniture constituted a search that required probable cause. Since the officer did not have probable cause at the time of the search, the evidence obtained as a result is tainted and should be suppressed. 

Option E correctly states that the plain view doctrine does not apply to items that are not immediately identifiable as contraband or evidence of a crime, making it the correct answer.

Answer: E
