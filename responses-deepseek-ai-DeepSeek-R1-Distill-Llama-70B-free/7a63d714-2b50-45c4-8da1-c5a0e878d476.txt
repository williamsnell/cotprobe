Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the reflectance of light at a water-glass boundary. Hmm, I remember that reflectance has to do with how much light is reflected when it hits a surface. Oh right, I think it's related to the refractive indices of the two materials involved.

The question is asking specifically for when light is moving from water into two types of glass: crown glass with n=1.523 and flint glass with n=1.62. So I guess I need to calculate the reflectance for each case.

Wait, I recall there's a formula for reflectance when light is at normal incidence. I think it's R equals (n2 - n1)^2 divided by (n2 + n1)^2, all multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Or was it the other way around? Oh wait, no, I think I got that right. It's (n2 - n1) squared over (n2 + n1) squared. So R = [(n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1)]² times 100.

Wait no, wait. Wait, actually, the formula is R = [(n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1)]². But wait, does this apply when going from medium 1 to medium 2? Because in this case, the light is going from water into glass. So medium 1 is water, and medium 2 is glass.

So n1 is the refractive index of water, and n2 is that of the glass. What's the refractive index of water? I think it's around 1.33. Oh yeah, water has n≈1.33.

So for part (a), crown glass n=1.523. So n1=1.33, n2=1.523.

Plugging into the formula: (1.523 - 1.33) / (1.523 + 1.33) = (0.193) / (2.853) approximately. Let me calculate that. 0.193 divided by 2.853. Let's see, 0.193 / 2.853. Hmm, maybe approximately 0.0677 or so.

Then square that: (0.0677)^2 is about 0.00459. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.459%. Looking at the options, I don't see that exactly. Wait, let me check my calculations again because maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let's compute (1.523 - 1.33) = 0.193. Then (1.523 + 1.33) = 2.853. So 0.193 / 2.853 = let's compute it step by step.

0.193 divided by 2.853. Let me approximate this division. 2.853 goes into 0.193... Well, 2.853 * 0.067 is approximately 0.192. So yes, about 0.0677.

Squaring that: 0.0677^2. 0.0677 * 0.0677. 0.06^2 is 0.0036. 0.0077^2 is about 0.000059. The cross terms: 2*(0.06)(0.0077) = 0.000924. So total is approximately 0.0036 + 0.000924 + 0.000059 = 0.004583. So about 0.4583%, which is approximately 0.46%. Wait, none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are A to J. Let's see:

Option B says 0.56% for crown and 1.04% for flint.

Option F: 0.48% and 0.98%.

Option E: 0.40% and 0.90%.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait another thought: Oh wait, the formula is when the light is going from medium 1 to medium 2. So if the light is going from water (n=1.33) to glass (n=1.523), then the reflectance is [(n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1)]². So that's correct as I did before.

Alternatively, if the light were going from air (n=1) into water, the formula would be different. But in this case, it's water to glass.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Reflectance R is given by:

R = [(n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1)]^2 when moving from medium 1 to 2. So yes, correct.

So for part (a), the calculation is 0.46%, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute (1.523-1.33)=0.193. (1.523+1.33)=2.853.

Compute 0.193 / 2.853:

Let me do this division more accurately.

2.853 * 0.067 = 0.191371.

0.193 - 0.191371 = 0.001629.

So 0.067 + (0.001629 / 2.853) = 0.067 + approx 0.00057= 0.06757.

So 0.06757 squared is:

0.06757 * 0.06757.

Calculate 0.06 * 0.06 = 0.0036.

0.06 * 0.00757 = 0.0004542.

0.00757 * 0.06 = same as above.

0.00757 * 0.00757 = approx 0.0000573.

So adding all together: 0.0036 + 0.0004542 + 0.0004542 + 0.0000573 = 0.0036 + 0.0009084 + 0.0000573 = 0.0045657.

Multiply by 100 gives 0.45657%, so about 0.457%. So approximately 0.46%.

Looking at the options, the closest I see is option F: 0.48% and 0.98%. Hmm, but that's a bit off. Option B is 0.56% for crown. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the refractive indices. Wait, wait, no, the glass is denser than water, so n2 is larger than n1, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.523-1.33)=0.193. 0.193 / 2.853. Let me compute 0.193 ÷ 2.853.

Using a calculator approach:

2.853 goes into 0.193 how many times?

2.853 * 0.06 = 0.17118.

0.193 - 0.17118 = 0.02182.

2.853 goes into 0.02182 about 0.00767 times because 2.853 *0.00767 ≈ 0.02187.

So total would be 0.06767.

So 0.06767 squared is approximately 0.00458, which is 0.458% as before.

So 0.458% is about 0.46%. So looking at the options:

Option F: (a) 0.48% (b) 0.98%.

Option B: (a) 0.56% (b) 1.04%.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong because sometimes the formula is written as (n1 - n2)/(n1 +n2) when light is going from medium 1 to medium 2, but if n2 is the second medium, then perhaps I should have (n2 - n1). Wait, but that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = ( (n2/n1) - 1 ) / ( (n2/n1) + 1 ) ) squared. No, that's another approach. Let me see.

Wait, another approach is to compute the reflection coefficient r = (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1). Then R is r squared.

So for (a), n2=1.523, n1=1.33.

r = (1.523-1.33)/(1.523+1.33) = 0.193/2.853 ≈ 0.06767.

So R = (0.06767)^2 ≈ 0.00458, which is 0.458% as before.

So 0.458% is approximately 0.46%, but none of the options have that. Looking back at the options:

Option F is (a) 0.48%, which is 0.48. Close to 0.458, but a bit higher.

Option B: 0.56% for (a), which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to use the reverse, i.e., light going from glass to water? No, the question says it's a water-glass boundary, so normal incidence at that boundary. So if light is going from water into glass, then n1 is 1.33, n2 is glass.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about n for water is wrong. Maybe it's taken as 1.33 exactly, but perhaps the formula is applied as (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1) squared.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it with more precise numbers.

Let me compute 1.523 - 1.33 = 0.193.

Sum is 1.523 + 1.33 = 2.853.

0.193 / 2.853 = ?

Let me compute this division more accurately.

2.853 × 0.067 = ?

2.853 × 0.06 = 0.17118.

2.853 × 0.007 = 0.019971.

Adding them: 0.17118 + 0.019971 = 0.191151.

So 2.853 × 0.067 = 0.191151.

The numerator is 0.193, so 0.193 - 0.191151 = 0.001849.

So 0.001849 / 2.853 = approximately 0.0006476.

So total is 0.067 + 0.0006476 ≈ 0.0676476.

So (0.0676476)^2 = let's compute.

0.0676 * 0.0676. Let's calculate:

0.06 * 0.06 = 0.0036.

0.06 * 0.0076 = 0.000456.

0.0076 * 0.06 = same as above.

0.0076 * 0.0076 = 0.00005776.

Adding all up:

0.0036 + 0.000456 + 0.000456 + 0.00005776 ≈ 0.00457.

So 0.457% as before.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't exactly in the options, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option F: (a) 0.48%, (b) 0.98%.

Option B: (a) 0.56%, (b) 1.04%.

Wait, perhaps I should compute for the flint glass case as well, then see which option matches both.

For part (b), flint glass has n=1.62.

So n1=1.33, n2=1.62.

So (1.62-1.33)=0.29.

Sum: 1.62 +1.33=2.95.

So 0.29 /2.95 ≈ 0.0983.

Then R = (0.0983)^2 ≈ 0.00966, which is 0.966%.

Wait, that's 0.966%, approximately 0.97%.

Looking at the options:

Option B for (b) is 1.04%, which is higher than 0.97%.

Option F for (b) is 0.98%, which is close to 0.97%.

Hmm, so for crown glass, we have approximately 0.457%, and for flint, approximately 0.966%.

Looking at the options:

Option F: (a) 0.48%, (b) 0.98%. That's very close.

Option B: (a) 0.56%, (b) 1.04%.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate part (a) again to see if I can get a higher number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for (a). Let me recompute.

n2=1.523, n1=1.33.

1.523-1.33=0.193.

1.523+1.33=2.853.

0.193/2.853 = ?

Let me try a different approach. 2.853 into 0.193.

We can write 0.193 as 193 ×1e-3.

We can approximate 2.853 × 0.067 as 0.191, as before.

So 0.067 × 2.853 = 0.191.

The remainder is 0.193 -0.191=0.002.

So 0.002/2.853 ≈ 0.0007015.

So total is 0.067 + 0.0007015 ≈ 0.0677015.

Then, (0.0677015)^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.0677 * 0.0677.

Compute 677 * 677:

600^2 = 360000.

(600+77)^2 = 600² + 2*600*77 +77² = 360000 + 2*46200 + 5929 = 360000 + 92400 = 452400 + 5929=458,329.

So 677^2=458,329. So 0.0677^2= (677e-4)^2= (458329e-8)=0.00458329.

So 0.4583%, which is approximately 0.458%.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: I've heard that sometimes the formula is written as R = [(n1 - n2)/(n1 + n2)]². But if n2 > n1, that would give a negative numerator, but when squared, it's the same as [(n2 -n1)/(n2 +n1)]². So same result.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the light is going from air to water to glass. But no, the question is about the water-glass boundary, so the incident medium is water, and the transmitting medium is glass.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the formula R = ( (n2 - n1) / (n2 + n1) )^2 * 100.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, let me compute more accurately for (a):

n2=1.523, n1=1.33.

n2 -n1=0.193.

n2 +n1=2.853.

So (0.193/2.853) = ?

Let me compute 0.193 ÷ 2.853.

Using a calculator approach:

2.853 * 0.06 = 0.17118.

Subtract from 0.193: 0.193 - 0.17118 = 0.02182.

2.853 * 0.007 = 0.019971.

Subtract: 0.02182 - 0.019971 = 0.001849.

2.853 * 0.0006 = 0.0017118.

Subtract: 0.001849 - 0.0017118=0.0001372.

2.853 * 0.000048 ≈ 0.0001369.

So total is 0.06 + 0.007 + 0.0006 + 0.000048 = 0.067648.

So (0.067648)^2 = 0.00458 → 0.458%.

So about 0.458% for crown.

Now for flint glass (n=1.62):

n2=1.62, n1=1.33.

n2-n1=0.29.

n2 +n1=2.95.

0.29/2.95 = ?

Compute 2.95 × 0.098 = ?

0.098 × 3 = 0.294, but 2.95 is 0.05 less than 3.

So 0.098 × 2.95 = 0.294 - (0.098 × 0.05) = 0.294 - 0.0049 = 0.2891.

So 2.95 × 0.098=0.2891.

But the numerator is 0.29, which is 0.0009 more than 0.2891.

So 0.29 = 0.2891 + 0.0009.

So 0.29/2.95 = 0.098 + (0.0009)/(2.95) ≈ 0.098 + 0.000305 ≈ 0.098305.

So (0.098305)^2 = ?

0.0983^2 = 0.00966 → 0.966%.

So approximately 0.966% for flint.

Looking at the options, which option is closest to (a) 0.458% and (b) 0.966%?

Looking at the options:

Option F: (a) 0.48% (b) 0.98%.

That's very close to our calculations. So 0.458 is approximately 0.48, and 0.966 is approximately 0.98.

Looking at other options:

Option B: (a) 0.56% (b) 1.04%. So 0.56 is a bit higher than 0.458, but 1.04 is higher than 0.966.

Option J: (a) 0.44% (b) 0.94%. So (a) 0.44 is lower than 0.458, (b) 0.94 is lower than 0.966.

Option F is the closest match.

So the correct answer should be option F: 0.48% for crown and 0.98% for flint.

To determine the reflectance for light of normal incidence at a water-glass boundary, we use the formula for reflectance:

\[
R = \left( \frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_2 + n_1} \right
