Okay, so I've got this physics question here about a cannonball being fired from a cannon. The question is asking what both the cannonball and the cannon experience equally. The options are A to J, each with different possibilities like displacement, accelerations, momentum, etc.

Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when two objects interact, like when the cannon fires the cannonball, they exert forces on each other. Newton's third law comes into play here. Oh wait, Newton's third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So the forces they exert on each other are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, the question isn't directly asking about force. It's giving options about various quantities. Let me think about each option.

Option A: displacements. Well, the cannonball travels a certain distance, say forward, while the cannon recoils backward. But the displacements are in opposite directions, and their magnitudes are probably different because the masses are different. The cannon is much more massive, so its displacement is smaller. So I don't think they have equal displacements. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: Both. Hmm, I don't know yet. Let me check other options.

Option C: Neither. Maybe, but I think some quantities are equal.

Option D: accelerations. Acceleration is force divided by mass. Since the force exerted on each is the same (from Newton's third law), but their masses are different. So the acceleration of the cannonball would be F/m1 and the cannon's acceleration would be F/m2. Since m1 (cannonball) is much less than m2 (cannon), the cannonball's acceleration is much higher. So their accelerations aren't equal. So D isn't correct.

Option E: amounts of momentum. Oh, wait, momentum is mass times velocity. But when the cannon fires, the total momentum should be conserved, assuming no external forces. So if the system is isolated, the momentum gained by the cannonball is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum gained by the cannon. So the magnitude of their momenta would be equal. So E could be correct. Let me think more.

Option F: amounts of potential energy. Potential energy usually relates to position or configuration. When the cannon fires, the cannonball might gain some potential energy if it's fired upwards, but the cannon itself? Unless it's elevated, but I don't think that's the case. So F is probably not correct.

Option G: amounts of kinetic energy. Kinetic energy depends on mass and velocity squared. Since the masses are different and velocities are different, their kinetic energies won't be equal. The cannon, being much heavier, has a smaller velocity, so its KE is (1/2)Mv². The cannonball's is (1/2)mV². Since M >> m and V >> v, but because of the square, the KE of the cannonball is much larger, so G isn't correct.

Option H: velocities. The velocities are different because of the different masses. So H is out.

Option I: amounts of force. From Newton's third law, the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So each experiences the same amount of force. But wait, the question is about what they "experience". So the forces are equal. I thought that initially. So I is about force, which is equal. But let me see: the question says "experience equal". So the forces are equal. But wait, the question might be a bit tricky because the actual forces are internal to the system, but maybe according to each object, they feel the same magnitude of force.

So wait, I'm a bit confused between E and I. Because both could be correct depending on how the question is phrased.

Wait, the options are E: amounts of momentum and I: amounts of force. Let me think again.

When the cannon fires, the explosive force causes both the cannon and cannonball to move. The force on the cannonball is equal and opposite to the force on the cannon. So the forces are equal in magnitude. So I might be correct. Alternatively, the changes in momentum are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so E would be correct in terms of the magnitude.

But the question is phrased as "experience equal". Experience usually refers to what each feels. So, the force experienced by each is the same in magnitude but opposite direction. So I would think I is correct.

Wait, but the options are each about "amounts of..." So E is talking about "amounts of momentum", which would be the magnitude. So the momentum gained by each is the same in magnitude, opposite in direction. So E is correct in that sense.

Wait, so which is it? Let me think about conservation of momentum. The total momentum before firing is zero (assuming the system is at rest). After firing, the total momentum is still zero. So the momentum of the cannonball is equal in magnitude but opposite to the momentum of the cannon. So their momenta are equal in magnitude. So E says "amounts of momentum" which refers to the magnitude. So E is correct.

But what about the forces? Each experiences the same force magnitude, but in opposite directions. So I says "amounts of force", which would be the same. So both E and I would be correct, but looking at the options, maybe the correct answer is E, because the forces are equal and opposite, but the question is about what they "experience". Wait, but each object experiences a force, but the force experienced is the same magnitude. So I would be correct.

Wait, but the question is about what they "experience equal". So force is equal, momentum change is equal. So the options could have both E and I correct, but the options given are single letters.

Looking back, the question is a multiple-choice question with one correct answer from A to J. So which one is correct?

Wait, the options are:

E: amounts of momentum

I: amounts of force

So which one is correct?

From physics, when two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other (Newton's third law). So the forces are equal in magnitude. So each experiences the same amount of force. So the answer would be I.

But wait, the change in momentum for each is equal and opposite. Momentum is force times time (impulse). So if the forces are equal and the time is the same, the changes in momentum are equal. So both E and I would be correct in terms of their magnitudes.

Wait, but the question is about what they experience, not the change. The question says, "experience equal". Force is experienced during the explosion, so I is correct. Momentum is a property after the force has been applied. So during the firing, the forces are equal, so I is correct.

Alternatively, the question could be referring to the changes in momentum. But in that case, the magnitude of the momentum is the same, so E would be correct.

So which is correct?

Hmm. The question is: when fired, both experience equal... So during the firing, the force each experiences is equal in magnitude. So I is correct.

But wait, also, the total momentum change (delta p) for each is equal in magnitude. So E is correct.

Wait, but the options are singular. So the options are either E or I.

Wait, looking back at the options, the question is about what they experience. So experience refers to force, which is I. Momentum is a result of the force over time. So the correct answer would be I.

Alternatively, if the question is about the outcome, like the momentum gained, then E is correct.

Wait, but the question states "experience equal". So it's about their experiences during the firing, which would be the forces. So I think the correct answer is I.

But wait, another thought: the momentum each gains is equal in magnitude. So delta p for each is the same. So E would be correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of an example. Suppose the cannon applies a force F on the cannonball, and the cannonball applies a force -F on the cannon. So each experiences a force of magnitude F, so I is correct.

The change in momentum for each is F*t, so same magnitude. So E is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what they experience. So the forces are experienced, so I is correct.

Alternatively, if the question was about the results, like momentum gained, then E is correct.

So the question is about what they "experience", which are the forces. So the answer should be I.

But wait, looking at the options, E is "amounts of momentum" and I is "amounts of force". So both are correct. But the options don't have both, so perhaps I need to pick between them.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused because both force and momentum changes are equal in magnitude. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is phrased as, "experience equal". So the forces are experienced, the momentum is a result. So the correct answer is I: amounts of force.

But wait, the options may not have I as the correct choice. Let me recall, the original question.

Wait, the question is when a cannonball is fired, both the cannon and cannonball experience equal what?

I think the correct answer is E: amounts of momentum. Because the law of conservation of momentum says that the total momentum is zero before and after (assuming no external forces), so their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite. So E is correct.

Alternatively, Newton's third law says the forces are equal. So I is correct.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me think about the exact wording.

The question is about when the cannon fires, what do both experience equally. So during the explosion, the force on each is equal (Newton's third law). So the forces are equal. So the answer is I.

But then, considering momentum, each gains momentum equal in magnitude. So E is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is both E and I, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: displacements

B: Both

C: Neither

D: accelerations

E: amounts of momentum

F: amounts of potential energy

G: amounts of kinetic energy

H: velocities

I: amounts of force

J: amounts of heat energy

So the options are single letters. So only one option is correct.

Wait, the key point is that in the interaction, the forces are equal (Newton's third law), so I is correct. Momentum changes are equal, so E is correct. So both I and E are correct. But the options don't have an option that combines E and I.

Wait, but the question may be referring to the fact that they experience the same force. So the correct answer is I.

Alternatively, if we're considering the system, the momentum is conserved, so the changes are equal, but the question is about what they experience, which is the force.

I think I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is E. Because when the cannon fires, the total momentum of the system is conserved, so the momentum of the cannonball equals that of the cannon but opposite.

Wait, but when the question says "experience", it's more about the force during the firing. So the answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because the question is about the 'amounts' which refers to magnitude, and since momentum changes are equal, E is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the force and momentum.

The force experienced by each is equal in magnitude, per Newton's third law. Momentum is force times time, so the change in momentum (delta p) is F*t, which is same for both, so delta p is same magnitude.

So both I and E are correct in terms of magnitude.

But the options don't have both, so perhaps the intended answer is E because the question is about what they "experience" after the firing, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the fact that the momentum transferred is the same. So E is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what they experience, which during the firing is force. So I think the answer is I.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: Let me look for similar problems. In a gun and bullet problem, the bullet and gun experience equal and opposite forces, so the forces are equal in magnitude. So I is correct. Also, their momentum changes are equal in magnitude, so E is correct.

But the question is phrased as what do they "experience" equal. So perhaps the answer is I, because experiencing refers to the forces during the firing.

Alternatively, the question is phrased as "experience equal", and the options include "amounts of momentum". So perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but the question is more about the interaction. So the force is what they experience, so I is correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is E: amounts of momentum. Because when the cannon fires, the total momentum is conserved. So the magnitude of momentum of the cannonball equals that of the cannon.

Alternatively, the forces are equal, so I is correct.

Wait, I think I remember that the correct answer is E. Because the momentum changes are equal. But I'm not 100% sure. Hmm.

Wait, another way to think about it: the question says "experience". Force is something that's experienced during the interaction. Momentum is a result. So the correct answer is I: amounts of force.

But I'm getting stuck between E and I.

Wait, looking up, the correct answer is E. Because the total momentum is conserved, so each gains equal and opposite momentum. So the amounts are equal.

Alternatively, during the firing, the forces are equal, so I is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because the question is about the end result, not the interaction.

I think I'll go with E: amounts of momentum.

When a cannonball is fired from a cannon, the interaction between the two is governed by Newton's third law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means the forces exerted by the cannon on the cannonball and by the cannonball on the cannon are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. However, the question specifically asks what the cannon and cannonball "experience" equally.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (displacements):** The displacements of the cannonball and the cannon are not equal because their masses are different, leading to different accelerations and displacements.  
- **Option B (Both):** This is not applicable since only one correct answer is required.  
- **Option C (Neither):** This is incorrect because some quantities, like force and momentum, are equal in magnitude.  
- **Option D (accelerations):** The accelerations are not equal because the masses of the cannon and cannonball are different, even though the forces are equal.  
- **Option E (amounts of momentum):** The total momentum of the system is conserved. Before firing, the total momentum is zero. After firing, the momentum gained by the cannonball is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum gained by the cannon. Thus, the amounts of momentum are equal.  
- **Option F (amounts of potential energy):** Potential energy is not relevant here unless the cannon or cannonball is elevated, which is not specified.  
- **Option G (amounts of kinetic energy):** The kinetic energies are not equal because the masses and velocities of the cannon and cannonball are different.  
- **Option H (velocities):** The velocities are not equal because the masses are different, leading to different accelerations and velocities.  
- **Option I (amounts of force):** The forces experienced by the cannon and cannonball are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, as per Newton's third law.  
- **Option J (amounts of heat energy):** Heat energy is not relevant to this scenario.

The question asks what the cannon and cannonball "experience" equally. While the forces experienced during the firing are equal in magnitude, the more appropriate interpretation of the question is about the outcome of the interaction. The conservation of momentum ensures that the amounts of momentum gained by the cannon and cannonball are equal in magnitude. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: amounts of momentum**

Answer: E
