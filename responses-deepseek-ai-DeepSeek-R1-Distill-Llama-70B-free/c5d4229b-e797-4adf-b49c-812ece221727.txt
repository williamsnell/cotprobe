Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the interest rate for purchasing a desk on an installment plan. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the desk is valued at $125. The payment plan requires a down payment of $16.25 and then 16 monthly payments of $7.50 each. I need to find the interest rate involved. 

Wait, I remember that when something is bought on installments, it's similar to a loan situation. The total amount paid includes the principal plus interest. So I think I should model this as a loan where the present value is the amount the buyer receives, and the payments are the installments paid back.

So, the present value (PV) would be the price minus the down payment, right? Because the down payment is made immediately, so the loan amount is $125 - $16.25 = $108.75. 

Then, there are 16 monthly payments of $7.50 each. So the payment (PMT) is $7.50 each month. The number of periods (n) is 16 months. 

I think the formula to use here is the present value of an ordinary annuity, which is PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]. Rearranging this to solve for r, which is the interest rate per period. But solving this equation for r can't be done algebraically easily, so I might have to use an iterative approach or a financial calculator.

Wait, but in the context of a multiple-choice question, maybe I can use approximation methods or see which rate, when plugged into the formula, gives a present value close to $108.75.

Alternatively, I could use the TVM (time value of money) formula. Let me set up the equation correctly. 

The present value is $108.75. Each payment is $7.50 made at the end of each month (since it's an installment plan, I assume it's ordinary annuity). So the equation is:

PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Plugging in the numbers:

108.75 = 7.50 × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Hmm, I can simplify this to:

108.75 / 7.50 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Calculating 108.75 /7.50: Let's see, 7.5 times 14 is 105, so 108.75 is 14.5 times 7.5. So 14.5 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Wait, wait, 7.5 multiplied by 14.5 equals 108.75, yes. So the equation becomes 14.5 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Now I need to find r such that (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r = 14.5.

Hmm, this seems tricky. I think I can use trial and error with the given options to see which rate works.

The options are percentages, so I'll have to consider them as decimal rates. Let's list the options in decimal form:

A: 16.3% → 0.163
B:17.8%→0.178
C:19.9%→0.199
D:14.6%→0.146
E:11.7%→0.117
F:13.5%→0.135
G:15.2%→0.152
H:20.6%→0.206
I:18.5%→0.185
J:12.4%→0.124

So I need to find r (in decimal) where (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ≈14.5.

Let me try each option one by one.

Starting with option I: 18.5% → 0.185 per period.

Plugging into the equation:

(1 - (1.185)^-16 ) / 0.185.

First, calculate (1.185)^16. That's going to be a large number, so (1.185)^16 ≈ let's see, each month it's multiplied by 1.185. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (1.185)^-16.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate method or a financial calculator, but since I don't have one, maybe I can make educated guesses.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the present value factor for each rate and see which one gets close to 14.5.

The present value factor is [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

Let me compute for each option:

Option I: r=0.185, n=16.

Compute (1 + 0.185)^-16.

Wait, 1.185^16 ≈ ?

Wait, 1.185^1 = 1.185

1.185^2 ≈ 1.185 * 1.185 ≈ 1.404

1.185^4 = (1.404)^2 ≈ 1.970

1.185^8 = (1.970)^2 ≈ 3.881

1.185^16 = (3.881)^2 ≈ 15.07

So (1.185)^-16 = 1/15.07 ≈ 0.0664.

So 1 - 0.0664 = 0.9336.

Now, 0.9336 / 0.185 ≈ 5.05.

Wait, but our target is 14.5, so 5 is way too low. So option I is way off. So option I isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because 1.185^16 seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I should compute 1.185 to the 16th power more accurately.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each step:

n=16, r=0.185.

But perhaps using logarithm? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 to estimate how long it takes for a number to grow, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try another option. Let's try option C: 19.9% → 0.199.

Compute (1.199)^16. Hmm, that's going to be even larger. So (1.199)^16 would be way bigger than 1.185^16, meaning (1.199)^-16 is smaller, so the numerator would be 1 - a smaller number, perhaps around 0.93, but when divided by 0.199, it would be 0.93/0.199≈4.67. Still way below 14.5.

Hmm, so higher rates give lower factors, so perhaps I need a lower rate.

Wait, let me try a lower rate, say option G: 15.2% → 0.152.

Compute (1.152)^16.

Let me compute step by step:

1.152^2 = 1.152 *1.152 ≈ 1.328.

1.152^4 = (1.328)^2 ≈ 1.763.

1.152^8 = (1.763)^2 ≈ 3.108.

1.152^16 = (3.108)^2 ≈ 9.663.

So, (1.152)^16 ≈9.663 → (1.152)^-16 ≈1/9.663≈0.1035.

1 - 0.1035 = 0.8965.

0.8965 / 0.152 ≈5.89.

Hmm, still too low. We need 14.5.

Wait, perhaps I should try a much lower rate. Let's try option E:11.7%→0.117.

Compute (1.117)^16.

1.117^2 ≈1.25.

1.117^4≈(1.25)^2=1.5625.

1.117^8≈(1.5625)^2≈2.441.

1.117^16≈(2.441)^2≈5.96.

So (1.117)^-16≈1/5.96≈0.1676.

1 -0.1676=0.8324.

0.8324/0.117≈7.12. Still lower than 14.5.

Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try another approach. Perhaps I should use a rate that when calculating the present value factor, it gives 14.5.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation formula for the interest rate. I recall that for an approximate estimate, when n is large, the rate can be approximated. But n=16 isn't that big. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value factor.

Wait, another approach: the present value of the payments is 16 * 7.50 = $120. But that's the total payments, but the present value is $108.75, which is less than $120. So the interest rate must be such that the present value of these 16 monthly payments is $108.75.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the total interest paid. The total amount paid is 16*7.50 = $120. Down payment is $16.25, so total paid is $16.25 + $120 = $136.25. The desk's value is $125, so the interest paid is $136.25 - $125= $11.25. But wait, that's total interest, but I'm not sure if that's useful because it's not considering the time value of money. So the interest rate isn't simply 11.25/108.75, which would be about 10.34%, but that's not considering the timing of payments.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the effective interest rate using the internal rate of return method, which is what the present value formula is about.

Let me think again. The correct formula is the present value of an ordinary annuity:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV =108.75, PMT=7.50, n=16. Solve for r.

Rearranged:

108.75 =7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Divide both sides by 7.50:

14.5 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

So, (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r =14.5.

Hmm, trial and error with the options. Let's try a lower rate. Maybe option J:12.4% →0.124.

Compute (1.124)^16.

Calculate step by step:

1.124^2 ≈1.267.

1.124^4≈ (1.267)^2≈1.605.

1.124^8≈(1.605)^2≈2.576.

1.124^16≈(2.576)^2≈6.635.

So (1.124)^16≈6.635 → (1.124)^-16≈1/6.635≈0.1507.

1 - 0.1507=0.8493.

0.8493/0.124≈6.85. Hmm, still too low.

Wait, target is 14.5, so this is way lower. So I need a rate that brings this ratio up to 14.5.

Wait, perhaps I need a lower interest rate. Let me try option E:11.7% which I did earlier and got ratio 7.12, which is still lower than 14.5. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me think again: when the interest rate is lower, the present value factor [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] increases. So to get a higher factor, I need a lower rate.

Wait, but when I tried 12.4%, I got 6.85, which is lower than 14.5, so I need an even lower rate.

Wait, but looking at the options, the lowest rate is E:11.7%, J:12.4%, then F:13.5%, etc.

Wait, but when I tried J:12.4%, I got 6.85. Let me try a lower rate, say 10% (not in options), just to see.

At 10%, (1.10)^16≈4.455, so (1.1)^-16≈0.224.

1-0.224=0.776.

0.776/0.10≈7.76. So still, even at 10%, the factor is 7.76, which is less than 14.5.

Wait, but the options don't go below 11.7%. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Wait, the present value of the annuity formula is correct, but perhaps I'm confusing the payment with something else.

Wait, another approach: The problem is an installment plan, so the amount financed is $125 - $16.25 = $108.75. The monthly payment is $7.50 for 16 months. So, the rate per month is r, and the total number of periods is 16.

Wait, perhaps I should use the PMT function in Excel, but since I can't do that, I'll have to proceed with calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (1 + r)^n. Let me try option G again, which is 15.2% (0.152).

Compute (1.152)^16.

Wait, perhaps using logarithm for better approximation.

The natural logarithm of 1.152 is approximately 0.1418.

Multiply by 16: 0.1418 *16≈2.269.

Exponentiate: e^2.269 ≈9.66.

So (1.152)^16≈9.66 → so (1.152)^-16≈0.1035.

1 - 0.1035 =0.8965.

0.8965 / 0.152 ≈5.89, which is lower than 14.5.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about what the present value factor represents. It's the factor by which each payment is multiplied to get the present value. So higher factor means lower interest rate.

Wait, so for a factor of 14.5, which is quite high, the interest rate should be low. But when I tried 10%, the factor was 7.76. So maybe the correct rate is lower than 10%? But the options don't go that low. The lowest option is E:11.7%. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

The problem states that the desk is valued at $125, and the plan is a down payment of $16.25 and 16 monthly payments of $7.50. So the amount financed is $125 - $16.25 = $108.75. Each payment is $7.50.

Wait, perhaps the payments include both principal and interest. So each $7.50 payment includes interest and principal. Therefore, the total amount paid is 16 *7.50 = $120, plus the down payment of $16.25, making total payments $136.25. The cost of the desk is $125, so total interest is $11.25.

But that's the total interest over the 16 months. But to find the interest rate per month, I'd have to calculate it based on the declining balance.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the effective interest rate using the formula for the interest rate on a loan, which is the same as the internal rate of return on the cash flows.

So, the initial outflow is the amount financed, $108.75. Then, each month, there's an inflow of $7.50 for 16 months. The IRR of this cash flow would be the monthly interest rate.

So, setting up the equation:

$108.75 = $7.50/(1 + r) + $7.50/(1 + r)^2 + ... + $7.50/(1 + r)^16.

This is the same as the present value of an ordinary annuity formula.

So, the equation is:

108.75 = 7.50 * [1/(1+r) + 1/(1+r)^2 + ... + 1/(1+r)^16 ].

The sum in the brackets is the present value factor for an ordinary annuity, which is [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ].

So, 108.75 =7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ].

Divide both sides by 7.50:

14.5 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ].

So, I'm back to the same equation. Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using the rule of 78 or something else, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I can use the approximation method for finding r.

The formula is:

r ≈ (2 * PMT) / (PV * (1 + n/2)) ) - 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use Newton-Raphson method for approximation, but that might be too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for lower rates, the present value factor increases. Since 14.5 is a high factor, the rate must be low.

Wait, let me try option E:11.7% again.

r=0.117, n=16.

Compute (1.117)^16.

Let me compute step by step:

1.117^1 =1.117.

1.117^2 =1.117 *1.117 ≈1.250.

1.117^4 = (1.250)^2≈1.5625.

1.117^8 = (1.5625)^2≈2.441.

1.117^16 = (2.441)^2≈5.958.

So, (1.117)^16≈5.958 → (1.117)^-16≈1/5.958≈0.1678.

1 - 0.1678=0.8322.

0.8322 /0.117≈7.12.

Hmm, that's lower than 14.5. So, a lower rate would give a higher factor, but even at 10%, the factor was 7.76, which is still lower than 14.5.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Let me
