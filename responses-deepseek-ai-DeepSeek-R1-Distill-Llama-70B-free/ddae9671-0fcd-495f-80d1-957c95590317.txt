Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about calculating a town's tax rate. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the question says the town needs $465,000 to meet its financial obligations for the year. The assessed valuation of the property is $10,000,000. I need to find the tax rate. Hmm, I remember that tax rates are usually calculated by dividing the amount needed by the assessed value and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

Wait, let me think. The formula I recall is tax rate equals (tax amount divided by assessed valuation) times 100. So in this case, it's 465,000 divided by 10,000,000. Let me write that down: 465000 / 10,000,000.

Let me compute that. 465000 divided by 10 million. Well, 10 million is 10,000,000. So 465000 divided by 10,000,000. Let me simplify that. Both numbers can be divided by 1000, so that becomes 465 / 10,000.

Wait, 465 divided by 10,000. Let's see, 10,000 goes into 465 how many times? 0.0465 times. Because 465/10000 is 0.0465. Then, to get the percentage, I multiply by 100. So 0.0465 times 100 is 4.65%. 

Looking at the options, option H is 4.65%. So that should be the answer. Let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

So 465,000 divided by 10,000,000 is indeed 0.0465, which is 4.65%. Yep, that makes sense. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The formula seems right, and the steps check out. So I'm confident that the correct answer is H.

The town's tax rate is calculated by dividing the required funds ($465,000) by the assessed valuation ($10,000,000) and then multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage. 

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{465,000}{10,000,000} \right) \times 100 = 4.65\%
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **H: 4.65%**.
