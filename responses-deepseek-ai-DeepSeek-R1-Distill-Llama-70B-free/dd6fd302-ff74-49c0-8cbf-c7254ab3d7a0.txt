Okay, so I have this physics problem about lenses, and I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a thin plano-convex lens. Hmm, I remember that plano-convex means one side is flat (plano) and the other is convex, like a curve. So the lens has two surfaces: one flat and one curved. The lens is made of glass with a refractive index of 1.5. The refractive power is given as 20 diopters. I need to find the radius of curvature of the curved surface.

Wait, right, the formula for the power of a lens. I think the formula involves the refractive indices and the radii of curvature. Oh yeah, it's something like (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but I might be mixing up the signs. Let me think again.

The lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2), where f is the focal length. And since power is 1/f in diopters, that makes sense. But wait, diopters are the reciprocal of meters, so when the power is 20 diopters, the focal length is 1/20 meters, which is 0.05 meters or 5 cm. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. If power D is 1/f, then f = 1/D. So when D is 20, f is 1/20 m, which is 0.05 m, which is 5 cm. Wait, 1/20 meters is 5 centimeters? Because 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1/20 m is 5 cm. Oh wait, no, wait: 1 m is 100 cm, so 1/20 m is 5 cm? No, wait: 1 m is 100 cm, so 1/20 m is 5 cm. Oh yes, right. 20 diopters is a focal length of 0.05 m (5 cm).

Wait, no, wait a second. 1 diopter is 1/m, so 20 diopters is 20 per meter, so 1/20 meters, which is 0.05 meters, which is 5 cm. Got it. So f is 5 cm.

But wait, the lens is plano-convex. So which surface is which in terms of curvature? Plano means one face is flat, so radius is infinite. Let me think: for a plano-convex lens, one surface is flat (radius R2 is infinite) and the other is convex (R1 is positive, I think). Wait, the sign conventions can be tricky here.

So the lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ) ]? Or is it (1/R1 - 1/R2)? Wait, I need to get this right.

Wait, I think the standard formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but the signs depend on the surface. For a plano-convex lens, one of the surfaces is flat, so R would be infinite. Let me think about the two surfaces. The first surface (say, the left side) is convex when the lens is plano-convex. So the first radius R1 is positive, and the second radius R2 is infinite because it's flat. Wait, but in the formula, when the surface is convex towards the incoming light (which is the case for the first surface if it's plano-convex), R is positive. And for a plano surface, the radius is infinite, so 1/R2 becomes zero.

So substituting into the formula: 1/f = (n-1) (1/R1 - 1/R2). Since R2 is infinite, 1/R2 is zero. So 1/f = (n-1) (1/R1). So R1 would be (n-1) times f. Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let me define the surfaces properly. For a plano-convex lens, the first surface is convex (so R1 is positive), and the second surface is flat (so R2 is infinite). Wait, but when the lens is plano-convex, it's usually that the convex surface is on one side, and the flat on the other. So the lens is like a bump on one side and flat on the other.

Wait, in the lensmaker's formula, the signs of R1 and R2 depend on whether the surface is convex or concave when viewed from the incoming light. For a double convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive. For a plano-convex, R1 is positive and R2 is infinite (so 1/R2 is zero). So when substituting into the formula, 1/f equals (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2) becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1), because 1/R2 is zero.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. Let's say the lens is plano-convex, so the first surface (left) is convex when looking at the lens from the left. So in the lensmaker's formula, R1 is positive. The second surface (right) is flat, so R2 is infinite, making 1/R2 zero. So the equation becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1).

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might have the formula inverted. Oh wait, no, the formula is 1/f = (n-1)[(1/R1) - (1/R2)], but R2 is the radius of the second surface. So if the second surface is flat, R2 is infinity, so 1/R2 is zero.

So substituting, 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1).

We have f = 0.05 meters, which is 5 cm. And n is 1.5, so n-1 is 0.5.

So putting in the numbers: 1/(5 cm) = 0.5 * (1/R1). Let's solve for R1.

Multiply both sides by R1: R1/(5 cm) = 0.5.

Then R1 = 0.5 * 5 cm = 2.5 cm. Wait, 0.5 times 5 is 2.5. So R1 would be 2.5 cm. But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1/f is 20 diopters, so f is 0.05 m, which is 5 cm. Then 1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1), since R2 is infinite.

So 1/(5 cm) = 0.5 * (1/R1) => 1/R1 = (1/(5 cm)) / 0.5 = (1/5 cm) * (2/1) = 2/(5 cm) = 0.4 per cm. So R1 is 1 / 0.4 cm⁻¹ = 2.5 cm. So R1 is 2.5 cm. So the radius of the curved surface is 2.5 cm.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.5 cm. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip R1 and R2. Sometimes, depending on the source, the lensmaker's formula can have different sign conventions. Let me think again.

The lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where R1 is the radius of the first surface, R2 the radius of the second. The signs of R1 and R2 depend on whether the surface is convex or concave towards the incoming light. For a plano-convex lens, the first surface (left) is convex, so R1 is positive. The second surface is flat, so R2 is infinite. So 1/R2 is zero. So equation is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1).

Yes, that's correct. So with f =5 cm, n=1.5, so 1/(5) = 0.5 * (1/R1) → R1=2.5 cm.

Yes, so the correct answer is C, 2.5 cm.

To solve the problem, we use the lensmaker's equation for a thin lens:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right),
\]

where:
- \( f \) is the focal length in meters,
- \( n \) is the refractive index of the lens material,
- \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces.

### Key Information:
1. The lens is **plano-convex**, meaning one surface is flat (plano) and the other is convex.
2. The refractive power of the lens is \( 20 \, \text{diopters} \), so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = 20 \, \text{diopters} \implies f = \frac{1}{20} \, \text{m} = 0.05 \, \text{m} = 5 \, \text{cm}.
   \]
3. The refractive index of the glass is \( n = 1.5 \).
4. For a plano-convex lens:
   - The flat surface has an infinite radius (\( R_2 = \infty \)), so \( \frac{1}{R_2} = 0 \).
   - The convex surface has a finite radius (\( R_1 \)).

Substituting these into the lensmaker's equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right),
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \frac{1}{R_1}.
\]

Rearranging for \( R_1 \):

\[
R_1 = (n-1) f.
\]

### Substituting Values:
- \( n-1 = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 \),
- \( f = 5 \, \text{cm} \).

\[
R_1 = 0.5 \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The radius of curvature of the curved surface is \( 2.5 \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
