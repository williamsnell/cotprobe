Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says a programmer earns $6.50 an hour. His take-home pay is 81% of his gross pay. I need to find a function for determining his take-home pay and then figure out how many hours he must work to take home $200. The options are given from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I'll tackle the function part because that's the first thing the question asks for.

So, the programmer's gross pay is the amount he earns before any deductions, right? That would be his hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours he works. Let's call the number of hours he works 'h'. So his gross pay would be 6.50 * h.

Now, the take-home pay is 81% of the gross pay. To find 81% of something, I multiply by 0.81. So the take-home pay function, let's call it T(h), would be T(h) = 0.81 * (6.50 * h). 

Wait, maybe I can simplify that. 0.81 times 6.50. Let me calculate that. 0.81 * 6.50... Let me do the math. 6 times 0.81 is 4.86, and 0.5 times 0.81 is 0.405. Adding them together gives 4.86 + 0.405 = 5.265. So T(h) = 5.265 * h. That's the function.

But maybe I should keep it in terms of 6.50 and 0.81 for clarity. Oh well, either way is correct, but perhaps the problem expects the function in terms of the given rate and percentage. So I think T(h) = 0.81 * 6.50 * h is acceptable, which simplifies to T(h) = 5.265h.

Now, the second part is figuring out how many hours he needs to work to take home $200. So we set T(h) equal to 200 and solve for h.

So, 5.265h = 200.

To find h, I'll divide both sides by 5.265. So h = 200 / 5.265.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 200 divided by 5.265. I'm not great at division without a calculator, so maybe I can approximate it.

Alternatively, I can write this as h = 200 / (6.50 * 0.81). Let's compute the denominator first. 6.50 * 0.81. As I did earlier, that's 5.265. So h = 200 / 5.265.

Wait, maybe I can compute this division more accurately. Let's see:

200 ÷ 5.265.

I can multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 200,000 ÷ 5265.

Hmm, maybe using long division. Let me try:

How many times does 5265 go into 200,000?

Well, 5265 * 38 = ?

Let me compute 5265 * 30 = 157,950.

5265 * 8 = 42,120.

Adding them together: 157,950 + 42,120 = 200,070.

Oh, that's just a bit over 200,000. So 38 times gives 200,070, which is 70 more than 200,000.

So maybe 38 hours would give just a bit more than $200. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, 5265 * 38 = 200,070, which is 70 more than 200,000. So 38 hours gives $200.07, which is just over $200. So perhaps 37.9 hours would give exactly $200. But since you can't work a fraction of an hour in reality, maybe he needs to work 38 hours to reach at least $200.

Wait, but the options are in whole numbers. Let me check the options again. The options are A:40, B:36, C:34, D:38, E:30, F:45, G:32, H:48, I:42, J:50.

So option D is 38 hours, which is what I'm getting. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute 200 divided by 5.265 more accurately.

5.265 times 38 is 5.265 * 38. Let me compute that:

5 * 38 = 190

0.265 * 38: 

0.2 *38=7.6, 0.06*38=2.28, 0.005*38=0.19. So 7.6 + 2.28 = 9.88 + 0.19 = 10.07.

So 5.265 *38 = 190 +10.07 = 200.07.

So yeah, 38 hours gives $200.07, which is just over $200. So he needs to work 38 hours to take home at least $200. So the answer should be D:38 hours.

Wait, but let me think again. Because sometimes in these problems, they might expect you to round down if it's not exact. But in this case, 200 is the target, and 38 hours gets him to 200.07, which is above 200. So 38 hours is the correct number of hours needed.

So the function is T(h) = 5.265h, and solving 5.265h = 200 gives h ≈ 37.96 hours, which we round up to 38 hours. So the answer is D.
</think>

The programmer earns $6.50 per hour, and his take-home pay is 81% of his gross pay. The function for take-home pay, \( T(h) \), can be expressed as:

\[
T(h) = 0.81 \times 6.50 \times h = 5.265h
\]

To determine how many hours he must work to take home $200, we set \( T(h) = 200 \) and solve for \( h \):

\[
5.265h = 200
\]

\[
h = \frac{200}{5.265} \approx 38 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the programmer must work **38 hours** to take home $200. The correct answer is:

D: 38 hours
