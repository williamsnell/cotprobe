Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the number of university graduates in certain countries at the time of their independence. The question is asking me to fill in the blanks with the correct pair of countries from the options provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is: At the time of independence, there were already hundreds of thousands of university graduates in ____, but hardly any at all in ____.

The options are A through J, each pairing two countries. I need to figure out which pair fits the statement correctly.

First, I should think about the historical context of each country's independence and their educational systems around that time. The key here is to determine which country had a significant number of university graduates at independence and which had very few.

Let me list the countries mentioned in the options to get a clearer picture: India, Congo, Australia, South Korea.

I'll start by recalling the independence timelines. India gained independence in 1947. The Congo, which is the Democratic Republic of the Congo, gained independence from Belgium in 1960. Australia is a bit different because it's part of the Commonwealth and its independence was a gradual process, but it's often considered to have effectively become independent with the Statute of Westminster in 1931, though it wasn't fully adopted until 1942. South Korea's independence is a bit more complex because it was under Japanese rule until 1945, after which it was split into North and South, with the Republic of Korea (South Korea) established in 1948.

Now, considering the educational systems at the time of independence:

1. **India (1947):** By the time India gained independence, the country had a well-established system of higher education. There were several universities, such as the University of Calcutta (founded in 1857), University of Bombay (1857), and University of Madras (1857). These had been producing graduates for nearly a century before independence. So India would have had hundreds of thousands of university graduates by 1947.

2. **Congo (1960):** The Congo was a Belgian colony, and the Belgians didn't invest much in higher education for the Congolese. In fact, until the mid-20th century, there were very few opportunities for higher education in the Congo. At the time of independence in 1960, it's reported that there were only a handful of Congolese who had university degrees. So the Congo would have hardly any university graduates at independence.

3. **Australia**: By the time Australia's effective independence started (say, early 20th century), it already had established universities. For example, the University of Sydney was founded in 1850, and the University of Melbourne in 1853. So by the mid-20th century, Australia would have had a significant number of university graduates.

4. **South Korea (1948):** After the end of Japanese rule in 1945, South Korea started building its educational system. However, in the immediate post-independence period, the country was still recovering from the aftermath of Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War (1950-1953). It's possible that higher education wasn't as widespread yet, but I'm not entirely sure. South Korea's rapid development, especially in education, began more prominently in the decades following the war.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct pair is likely to involve India and Congo because India had a lot of graduates in 1947, and Congo had very few in 1960. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: India, Congo → This would mean India had hundreds of thousands, Congo hardly any. That fits with what I know.

B: India, Australia → No, because Australia had many graduates by the mid-20th century.

C: Congo, Australia → No, because both had independence around different times, but I don't think Congo had more graduates.

D: Australia, Congo → Australia had many, so this doesn't fit.

E: South Korea, Congo → South Korea's independence was 1948, but I'm not sure about their graduates yet. Maybe not as many as India.

F: South Korea, India → No, because India had more.

G: Congo, South Korea → No, because Congo had fewer.

H: Congo, India → No, because the first blank should be the country with more graduates.

I: South Korea, Australia → Unlikely.

J: India, South Korea → South Korea may have had fewer, but I think Congo had even fewer.

So the correct answer should be A: India, Congo.

Wait, but let me double-check. I recall that at the time of independence, India had a substantial number of educated elites, many of whom played roles in the independence movement and governance. On the other hand, the Congo, as a Belgian colony, had very limited access to higher education. The Belgians focused more on primary education, but even that was limited. So at independence in 1960, the Congo had almost no university graduates, which led to significant challenges in governance and development.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct pairing is India and Congo, which is option A.

The correct answer is based on the historical context of each country's independence and their educational systems at the time. India, which gained independence in 1947, had a well-established system of higher education with universities dating back to the 19th century, producing hundreds of thousands of graduates by independence. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which gained independence in 1960, had very few university graduates due to limited investment in higher education by Belgian colonial authorities. Thus, the pair that fits the statement is India and Congo.
