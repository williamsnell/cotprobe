Okay, so I've got this problem here about air being pumped into a tank, and I need to figure out the volume that must be pumped in to reach a certain pressure. Hmm, let's see. I remember that this has to do with gas laws, probably the combined gas law or something like that.

Alright, the problem states that the initial pressure is 1.47 lb/in². Wait, but when dealing with gas laws, I think we need to use absolute pressure, not gage pressure. Oh right, because gage pressure is the pressure above atmospheric. So I should convert that to absolute pressure by adding atmospheric pressure.

What's the atmospheric pressure in lb/in²? I think it's about 14.7 lb/in² at sea level. So the initial absolute pressure would be 1.47 + 14.7 = 16.17 lb/in². Got that.

The volume of the tank is given as 42.5 ft³. I think that's the fixed volume since it's the tank's volume. So the volume doesn't change during this process.

The question is asking, what volume of air must be pumped in to make the gage read 55.3 lb/in². Wait, but wait again. So the final pressure is 55.3 lb/in² gage. So the absolute pressure would be 55.3 + 14.7 = 70 lb/in². Oh, that's a nice round number, maybe that helps with the calculations.

The temperature is changing from 70°F to 80°F. Oh, right, temperature needs to be in absolute terms for gas laws, so I should convert these to Rankine. How do I do that? I remember the formula: °R = °F + 459.67. So initial temperature T1 is 70 + 459.67 = 529.67 °R. Final temperature T2 is 80 + 459.67 = 539.67 °R.

Wait, but wait another thing. The gas law equation is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. But in this scenario, the volume of the tank V is constant, right? So V1 and V2 are the same, because the tank's volume doesn't change. So the equation simplifies to P1/T1 = P2/T2.

Wait no, that's only if the amount of gas doesn't change. Oh wait, but in this case, we're adding more gas. So maybe I'm thinking of the wrong approach here. Because adding more gas increases the pressure, so perhaps we should consider the initial amount of gas and the amount after adding more.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of moles of gas. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Since the volume V is constant, the equation becomes P1 * V = n1 * R * T1, and P2 * V = (n1 + n_added) * R * T2.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the volume of air pumped in. So maybe we can model this as the initial amount plus the added amount equals the final amount. Let me think.

So initial state: P1_abs = 16.17 lb/in², T1 = 529.67 °R, V = 42.5 ft³. So initial moles n1 = (P1_abs * V) / (R T1).

Final state: P2_abs = 70 lb/in², T2 = 539.67 °R, same V. So final moles n2 = (P2_abs * V) / (R T2).

The change in moles, which is the moles added, is n_added = n2 - n1.

But wait, R is the gas constant. What value should I use for R? I think in these units, it's 53.35 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R) or something like that. Let me confirm. Yeah, R for air is approximately 53.35 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R).

So let's calculate n1 and n2.

n1 = (16.17 lb/in² * 42.5 ft³) / (53.35 * 529.67 °R).

Wait, but wait a second. The pressure is in lb/in² and volume in ft³. I need to make sure the units are compatible. Because 1 ft³ is 1728 in³. Hmm, but when using R in certain units, perhaps the pressure and volume units are already accounted for.

Wait, maybe I should convert the pressure to lb/ft². Because 1 lb/in² is 144 lb/ft² (since 1 ft² is 144 in²). So 16.17 lb/in² is 16.17 * 144 lb/ft².

Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different value of R that's in lb/in² units.

Wait, another approach: use the combined gas law, but in terms of the initial and final states, considering that the volume is constant.

Wait, but the volume of the tank is fixed, so when you pump more air into it, the total moles increase. So maybe the ideal gas law applies as P1V = n1RT1 and P2V = (n1 + n)RT2, where n is the moles added.

Wait, but the question is about the volume of air pumped in. So perhaps I'm supposed to find the volume at the initial conditions that corresponds to the moles added.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the moles of air to add can be found, and then converted to volume under initial conditions (since that's when the air is being pumped in, so at initial pressure and temperature).

So let's outline the steps.

1. Calculate initial absolute pressure P1_abs = 1.47 + 14.7 = 16.17 psi.

2. Calculate final absolute pressure P2_abs = 55.3 + 14.7 = 70 psi.

3. Initial temperature T1 = 70°F = 529.67 °R.

4. Final temperature T2 = 80°F = 539.67 °R.

The tank's volume V is 42.5 ft³.

We can write the ideal gas equations for the initial and final states.

Initial: P1_abs * V = n1 * R * T1.

Final: P2_abs * V = (n1 + n) * R * T2.

Subtracting initial from final gives P2V - P1V = n R (T2 - T1 / T1? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, subtracting,

P2 V = (n1 + n) R T2.

P1 V = n1 R T1.

Subtracting: (P2 V - P1 V) = (n1 R T2 + n R T2) - n1 R T1.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to write the two equations and subtract.

P2 V = (n1 + n) R T2.

P1 V = n1 R T1.

Subtract the second equation from the first:

P2 V - P1 V = (n1 R T2 + n R T2) - n1 R T1.

Hmm, maybe factor terms.

Alternatively, solving for n1 from the first equation: n1 = (P1 V)/(R T1).

Similarly, n1 + n = (P2 V)/(R T2).

So subtracting, n = (P2 V)/(R T2) - (P1 V)/(R T1).

Factor out V/(R):

n = V/(R) [ P2 / T2 - P1 / T1 ].

That looks better.

So,

n = (42.5 ft³) / (53.35 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R)) ) * [ (70 lb/in²)/(539.67 °R) - (16.17 lb/in²)/(529.67 °R) ) ].

Wait, but there's a unit issue here because P is in lb/in² and V is in ft³. Because 1 ft³ is 1728 in³. So I need to convert the pressure to lb/ft² to make the units compatible.

Alternatively, convert the pressure to lb/ft² by multiplying by 144 (since 1 ft² = 144 in²).

So,

P1_abs = 16.17 lb/in² * 144 lb/ft² per lb/in² = let's calculate that.

16.17 * 144: 16 * 144 = 2304, 0.17 *144=24.48. So 2304 +24.48=2328.48 lb/ft².

Similarly, P2_abs =70 lb/in² *144= 70*144=10080 lb/ft².

So substituting these into the equation for n:

n = (42.5) / (53.35) * [ (10080 / 539.67) - (2328.48 / 529.67) ) ].

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute 10080 /539.67:

10080 ÷ 539.67 ≈ let's see. 539.67 * 18 = approx 9714. So 18.6 *539.67= 18*539.67=9714.06; 0.6 *539.67≈323.8; total ≈ 9714.06 +323.8=10037.86. Close to 10080. So 18.6 gives us about 10037.86, so 18.65 would give 10080.

Wait let me compute exactly: 539.67 * 18.65.

18 * 539.67 = 9714.06.

0.65 *539.67 = 350.2755.

Total: 9714.06 +350.2755 ≈ 10064.3355. Hmm, that's a bit under 10080. So maybe 18.7.

18.7 *539.67:

18*539.67=9714.06.

0.7 *539.67=377.769.

Total: 9714.06 +377.769 = 10091.829.

Wait, but we have 10080 as the numerator. So 539.67 * x =10080 → x=10080/539.67 ≈18.68 (exact value).

Similarly, let me compute 2328.48 /529.67.

Calculate 2328.48 ÷529.67.

529.67 *4 =2118.68. 2328.48-2118.68=209.8.

So 4 + 209.8/529.67 ≈4 +0.3956≈4.3956.

So approximately 4.396.

So the term in brackets is [18.68 -4.396] ≈14.284.

So now, n = (42.5 /53.35) *14.284.

Compute 42.5 /53.35 → approximately 0.8.

0.8 *14.284≈11.427.

So n ≈11.427 lb·mol.

Wait, but wait: let me double-check these calculations because it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term more accurately.

Compute P2/T2: P2=10080 lb/ft², T2=539.67 °R.

10080 / 539.67 = Let me compute this division.

539.67 *18 = 9714.06.

10080 -9714.06=365.94.

365.94 /539.67≈0.678.

So 18 + 0.678=18.678.

Similarly, P1/T1=2328.48 lb/ft² / 529.67 °R.

2328.48 /529.67: 529.67 *4=2118.68. 2328.48-2118.68=209.8.

209.8 /529.67≈0.3956.

So 4.3956.

So the difference is 18.678 -4.3956≈14.2824.

So 14.2824.

Now, 42.5 /53.35 → let me compute that.

53.35 *0.8 =42.68. Oh wait, 53.35 times 0.8 is 42.68. But 42.5 is less than that. So 0.8 - (0.18/53.35) → 0.8 - 0.00337≈0.7966.

Wait, 53.35 *0.7966 ≈42.5.

So 42.5 /53.35 ≈0.7966.

So 0.7966 *14.2824 = Let's compute that.

14 *0.7966 =11.1524.

0.2824 *0.7966 ≈0.2249.

So total ≈11.1524 +0.2249=11.3773 lb·mol.

So n≈11.377 lb·mol.

Wait, but wait, this is the moles of gas that need to be added. Now, the question is, what's the volume of this added air at the initial conditions (before being compressed into the tank). Because the air is pumped in, so the volume would be at the initial pressure and temperature.

So to find the volume, we use the ideal gas law again: V = n R T / P.

But wait, n here is the moles added, which is 11.377 lb·mol.

Initial conditions: P_initial is 1.47 lb/in² gage, which is 16.17 lb/in² absolute, and T_initial is 70°F =529.67 °R.

Wait, but wait, what units for R? Because if we're using R=53.35 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R), then P needs to be in lb/ft² and V will be in ft³.

So let me convert P_initial_abs to lb/ft²: 16.17 lb/in² *144 lb/ft² per lb/in² = 2328.48 lb/ft².

So using the ideal gas law for the added n:

V_added = n R T / P.

n=11.377 lb·mol.

R=53.35 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R).

T=529.67 °R.

P=2328.48 lb/ft².

So V_added = (11.377 *53.35 *529.67) /2328.48.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator step by step.

First, 11.377 *53.35 = let's see:

11 *53.35 =587.85.

0.377 *53.35 → approx 0.3 *53.35=16.005; 0.077 *53.35≈4.106. So total 16.005+4.106=20.111.

So total 587.85 +20.111=607.961.

Then multiply by 529.67 → 607.961 *529.67.

Hmm, that's a big number. Let me approximate.

607.961 *500 =303,980.5.

607.961 *29.67 ≈ let's calculate 607.961 *30 =18,238.83, minus 607.961 *0.33≈200.628. So 18,238.83 -200.628≈18,038.202.

So total numerator ≈303,980.5 +18,038.202≈322,018.7 lb·ft²/(mol·°R) * °R → lb·ft².

Wait, no, the numerator is n*R*T → units: (lb·mol) * (ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R)) * °R → ft·lb.

Denominator is P in lb/ft². So V_added = (ft·lb) / (lb/ft²) )= ft³.

So numerator is 322,018.7 ft·lb.

Denominator is 2328.48 lb/ft².

So V_added = 322,018.7 / 2328.48 → let's compute that.

Divide 322,018.7 by 2328.48.

Well, 2328.48 * 100 =232,848.

322,018.7 -232,848 =89,170.7.

2328.48 * 38 = let's see: 2328.48 *30=69,854.4; 2328.48 *8=18,627.84 → total 88,482.24.

So 38 → 88,482.24, which is less than 89,170.7.

Subtract: 89,170.7 -88,482.24=688.46.

Now, 2328.48 * 0.295 ≈688.46.

Approximately, 2328.48 *0.295 = let's compute 2328.48 *0.3 =698.544. That's a bit higher than 688.46. So perhaps about 0.294.

So total is 100 +38 +0.294 =138.294.

So V_added ≈138.29 ft³.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is 175, 170, etc. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options given. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere.

Wait, let me retrace the steps.

Wait, the problem says the air is pumped into the tank, so the volume of the air pumped is the volume at the initial conditions, which are pressure 1.47 psi (absolute 16.17 psi) and temperature 70°F. But when we calculate the moles, we found that n≈11.377 lb·mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversions. Let me double-check.

When I computed V_added, I used P_initial_abs =16.17 psi, which is 2328.48 lb/ft². And R=53.35 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R). So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation for n.

Wait, let me recalculate n.

n = (V_tank / R) * (P2_abs / T2 - P1_abs / T1 )

Wait, no, no, n = V/(R) [ P2_abs / T2 - P1_abs / T1 ]

Wait, but P2_abs and P1_abs are in lb/ft², yes?

Wait, no, in the equation n = V/(R) [ (P2/T2) - (P1/T1) ], P1 and P2 are in lb/ft².

Wait, let me recheck that.

Yes, because the initial and final pressures are in absolute terms, and in the same units.

Wait, perhaps a miscalc
