C: Burglary, because he entered the subway car with the intention of committing a theft.
D: Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.
E: Robbery, because he used force to take possession of the purse.
F: Robbery, because he used force to remove the woman from the purse's vicinity.
G: Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.
H: Assault, because he pushed the woman out of the way.
I: Larceny, because he made no threat to use force.
J: Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence.

Okay, so I've got this question here about criminal law, specifically regarding different offenses like larceny, robbery, burglary, etc. Hmm, let's see what the scenario is.

So, a woman is on a subway, and she puts her purse on the seat next to her. Then a man comes from behind, grabs the purse, pushes her out of the way, and runs off with it. He gets caught on the platform with the purse. The question is asking what crime he can be convicted of under common law.

Alright, I remember that in criminal law, the key is to look at the elements of each offense. Let's break down what happened step by step.

First, he took the purse without her consent. That sounds like theft. Now, theft at common law is usually larceny. Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive. So he took the purse, which she owned, with the intent to keep it. So that's larceny.

But wait, there's more. He pushed the woman out of the way. So force was used. Now, under common law, robbery is defined as larceny plus the use of force or fear. So the key is whether the force was used in the course of taking the property.

In this case, he grabbed the purse and then pushed her. So did the force happen contemporaneously with the taking? Or was it after?

Wait, he approached from behind, grabbed the purse, and then pushed her. So the taking of the purse was done by grabbing it, and then he pushed her to get away. So the force was used after the taking. But under common law, I think robbery requires the use of force at the time of the taking. So if he used force after taking the purse, maybe it's still robbery because it's part of the same act.

Alternatively, larceny is the taking without consent, and robbery is when force is used to take it. So if the force is used to take possession, that's robbery. But if the force is used after the taking to escape, maybe it's just larceny plus another offense like assault.

Wait, but in this case, the man took the purse and then pushed her. So the initial taking was without force, but the force was used to get away. So does that count as part of the robbery?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the elements again.

Robbery is larceny (trespassory taking) plus the use of force or fear. The force must be used in order to take the property or to retain it. So if the force is used to escape, does that count?

Wait, no. Because the force must be contemporaneous with the taking. So if he took the purse without force, then used force to push her away, that might not be robbery. Because the force wasn't used to take the property, it was used after. So that would be larceny plus assault, but not robbery.

But wait, some jurisdictions might consider that the force was part of the same transaction. So when he took the purse and then pushed her, maybe that's enough for robbery. Because the force was used in the course of committing the theft.

Alternatively, perhaps the taking was without force, but the force was used to prevent her from retrieving the purse. So in that case, the force was used to complete the theft, which might make it robbery.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B says larceny because he took without permission. So that's possible.

Options E, F, D, etc., are about robbery.

Option E says robbery because he used force to take possession. Wait, in the scenario, he took the purse, then used force. So the force wasn't used to take possession, but after.

Option F says robbery because he used force to remove her from the vicinity. So that's about moving her away, which he did by pushing.

Option D says robbery because force was used in leaving with the purse.

Option J: robbery because he physically took the purse from her presence. Wait, but he took it from the seat, not directly from her person. So maybe that's a point.

Wait, in common law, larceny can be from the person or not. If it's taken directly from the person, it's considered a more serious form of larceny, sometimes called "larceny from the person." But robbery includes both the taking and the force.

Wait, but in this case, the purse was on the seat, not in her hand. So she wasn't holding it when he took it. So it's not larceny from the person.

But he did use force against her. So the question is whether that force was part of the taking.

Alternatively, perhaps the force was used to effectuate the taking. So when he grabbed the purse and then pushed her, maybe that's considered using force to take the property.

Wait, but he didn't need to push her to take the purse. He took it, and then pushed her to get away. So the force wasn't necessary to take the purse but was used to facilitate escape.

In that case, under common law, robbery requires force at the time of the taking. If the force is used after, then it might not meet the robbery criteria.

So then the offense would be larceny and assault, but not robbery. But looking at the options, some are about larceny, others about robbery.

Wait, but let me make sure. The force doesn't have to be used before the taking, but during the taking. So if he pushed her as he was taking the purse, that's part of the act. But in this case, he took it and then pushed her. So the force was after the taking.

So perhaps it's larceny, not robbery.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: Larceny because he took without permission. That's correct as a basic larceny.

Option G: Larceny because force was used after taking the purse. So that's possible.

Wait, option G says, "Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse." So that would mean it's larceny, not robbery.

But some options are about robbery. So which is correct?

Wait, another angle: under common law, robbery requires the use of force or fear at the time of the taking. So if the force is used after, it's not robbery. So the crime would be larceny plus assault, but not robbery.

But the options given are single crimes, not multiple. So the question is, of the options, which is the proper conviction.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: Robbery, because he used force to take possession. But in this case, he took possession without force, then used force.

Option D: Robbery because he used force in leaving. So that's about escaping.

Hmm. Common law robbery requires the force to be used in the course of the theft, either to take the property or to prevent the victim from recovering it. So if the force was used to get away, maybe that's sufficient.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the case law. In some jurisdictions, the force used to effectuate escape after the taking can still be part of the robbery. Because the robbery isn't just the taking, but the entire transaction until the robber escapes.

Alternatively, at common law, robbery is a continuing act, so force used in fleeing the scene can still make it robbery.

Wait, but no, I think traditionally, the force has to be at the time of the taking or immediately surrounding it. So if the force is used after the taking to escape, it's not considered part of the robbery.

So in this case, the man took the purse without force, then used force to push her away as he ran off. So the force wasn't used to take the purse, but to facilitate escape. Therefore, it's larceny, not robbery.

So the correct answer would be larceny. Looking at the options, option B says larceny because he took without permission. Option G says larceny because force was used after taking.

Wait, but option B is more general, and G is more specific. So the correct reasoning would be G.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If force was used after the taking, it's larceny. If force was used during the taking, it's robbery.

So the question is, was the force used during the taking?

In the scenario, he grabbed the purse and then pushed her. So the taking was done by grabbing, which is a form of force, but perhaps not enough. Or is grabbing the purse considered force?

Wait, no. Taking the purse from the seat is trespassory, but not necessarily using force against the person. So if he just grabs the purse without touching her, then runs and pushes her, perhaps that's larceny plus assault.

But if in grabbing the purse, he used force against her person, then that's robbery.

Wait, but in this case, she was standing in the aisle, and he approached from behind. He grabbed the purse off the seat, then pushed her. So the grabbing of the purse was from the seat, not from her person. So he didn't use force against her to take the purse; he took it and then pushed her.

So the initial taking was trespassory but without force against her. Then he used force against her to get away.

So under common law, that would be larceny, because the force wasn't used to take the property, but after. So the answer would be larceny.

Looking at the options, option B is larceny because he took without permission, which is correct. Option G says larceny because force was used after, which is more specific and accurate.

So between B and G, which is better.

The question is about what crime he can be convicted of. So if the force was after, it's larceny, not robbery. So option G would be correct.

But wait, another thought: under common law, does the use of force after the taking count as part of the robbery? Because the man used force in the course of committing the theft, even if it's after the initial taking.

I think the traditional view is that the force must be used at the time of the taking, not after. So if the force is used to escape, it's not robbery.

So the correct answer would be larceny, and the option that states that force was used after is option G.

So looking back at the options:

Option G: Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.

Yes, that fits.

Wait, but option B is also about larceny. So why not B?

Because B is correct but less specific. The question asks for the proper conviction, considering the force. So the presence of force might make it robbery or not. Since force was used after, it's not robbery, so it's larceny, and the reason is that the force was after.

So option G is more precise.

Wait, but let me think again. If he took the purse without force, then used force to push her away, that's larceny plus assault. But the question is about a single offense. So in terms of the offenses given, robbery requires force during the taking. So he can't be convicted of robbery, only larceny and assault. But the options don't include assault as a standalone; option H is assault, but the question is which crime can he be properly convicted of.

So the possible crimes are larceny or robbery. Since the force wasn't used during the taking, it's larceny, so option G.

Alternatively, maybe the act of pushing her while taking the purse is part of the taking. But in the scenario, he took the purse, then pushed her.

Wait, the exact sequence is: he grabbed the purse off the seat, then pushed her out of the way.

So the taking was done without force against her; the force was used after the taking to get away.

So the force wasn't used to take the purse, so it's larceny, not robbery.

So the answer should be option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because some sources might consider any force used during the entire transaction as part of robbery. But traditionally, common law requires force at the time of the taking.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around determining the appropriate crime for which the man can be convicted under common law. The scenario involves a man taking a purse from a subway seat and then using force to push the woman away as he flees. The key is to analyze the elements of the offenses provided in the options and apply them to the facts.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Larceny**: Under common law, larceny is defined as the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive. Here, the man took the purse without the woman's consent, which satisfies the elements of larceny.

2. **Robbery**: Robbery at common law is larceny plus the use of force or fear. The force must be used at the time of the taking or contemporaneously with it. In this case, the man took the purse first and then used force to push the woman away. Since the force was used after the taking, it does not meet the requirement for robbery under common law.

3. **Force Timing**: The critical distinction lies in when the force was applied. The man did not use force to take the purse; instead, the force was used to facilitate his escape. Under common law, this sequence does not constitute robbery, as the force was not contemporaneous with the taking.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option B**: "Larceny, because he took the purse without the woman's permission." This is correct but general.
   - **Option G**: "Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse." This is more precise, as it highlights the timing of the force, which is key to distinguishing larceny from robbery.

### Conclusion:
The man committed larceny because the force was used after the taking of the purse, not during the act itself. Therefore, the most accurate answer is **Option G**, as it specifically addresses the timing of the force, which is critical in this scenario.
