Question:

In a cohort study of elderly women, the relative risk ratio for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly is 1.2 (95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8). Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture?

Options:

A: Statistically significant overall increase in risk
B: Statistically insignificant change in risk for those who exercise regularly
C: Statistically significant overall decrease in risk
D: Statistically nonsignificant decrease in risk
E: Statistically significant decrease in risk only for those over 80
F: Statistically significant overall decrease in risk for those who exercise regularly
G: Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk
H: Statistically significant increase in risk only for those under 70
I: No statistically significant change in risk
J: Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a cohort study on elderly women and the risk of hip fractures related to regular exercise. The question is asking me to determine the most appropriate conclusion based on the given relative risk ratio and confidence interval.

Alright, let me break this down. I remember that in epidemiology, relative risk (RR) is a measure that compares the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group versus the non-exposed group. So in this case, the exposed group is the women who exercise regularly, and the event is hip fractures.

The given RR is 1.2, which means that exercising women have 1.2 times the risk of hip fractures compared to those who don't exercise. Wait, but wait, I thought exercise usually helps prevent fractures because it strengthens bones and muscles. So this seems a bit counterintuitive. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

But let's focus on the statistics. The 95% confidence interval (CI) is 1.1 to 1.8. I remember that if the CI doesn't include 1, the result is statistically significant. Because 1 is the null value where there's no effect. So here, the CI starts at 1.1 and goes up to 1.8, both above 1. So this means that the lower bound is 1.1, which is higher than 1, so the entire CI is above 1. Therefore, the result is statistically significant.

So a RR of 1.2 with a CI of 1.1-1.8 suggests that exercising increases the risk, and this increase is statistically significant. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought regular exercise would decrease fractures. Maybe this study found the opposite, or perhaps there's a different factor at play.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the correct conclusion. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Statistically significant overall increase in risk. Yes, because the RR is above 1 and the CI doesn't include 1. So this seems correct.

Option B: Statistically insignificant change. No, because the CI doesn't include 1, so it's significant.

Option C: Significant overall decrease. No, because RR is 1.2, which is an increase, not a decrease.

Option D: Nonsignificant decrease. No, same reason as C and because it's not a decrease.

Option E: Significant decrease only for those over 80. Not supported by the data given, which is overall, not specific to age groups.

Option F: Significant overall decrease for exercisers. No, because the RR is 1.2, which is an increase.

Option G: Nonsignificant overall decrease. No, because it's an increase and significant.

Option H: Significant increase only for under 70. Again, the data doesn't specify age subgroups.

Option I: No significant change. No, because the CI excludes 1.

Option J: Nonsignificant increase. No, because it's significant.

So the correct conclusion is that there's a statistically significant overall increase in risk. So the answer should be A.

The relative risk (RR) of 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.1 to 1.8 indicates that women who exercise regularly have a 1.2-fold increased risk of hip fractures compared to those who do not exercise. Since the CI does not include 1, the result is statistically significant. This suggests an overall increase in risk, contrary to the common expectation that exercise might reduce fracture risk. Among the options, only Option A correctly reflects this conclusion.

Answer: A
