Okay, so I've got this question about Macedo's duties that societies have towards nonmembers. The question is asking which option is not mentioned by Macedo. The options are A through D, each listing different types of duties. 

First, I need to remember what Macedo's main points are. From what I recall, Macedo discusses several categories of duties beyond borders. I think he talks about things like humanitarian duties, which would be things like preventing human rights violations. So option D, which mentions preventing systematic violations, would be something he includes. 

Then there's duties of fair dealing, like not exploiting others. That sounds familiar too, so option A is probably one he mentions. 

Duties of rectification and redress—those are about making amends for past wrongs, like oppression. I think Macedo does include those, so option C is something he covers. 

Wait, what about option B? Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties—like ensuring everyone has equal wealth. I'm not sure about this one. I remember Macedo being more into a pluralist approach, where he doesn't advocate for global equality of wealth but rather focuses on other aspects like human rights and fair dealings. Cosmopolitan egalitarianism, which pushes for equal wealth worldwide, might be a more extreme view that Macedo doesn't subscribe to. 

So putting it together, Macedo mentions A, C, D, but not B. So the answer should be option B.

The question asks which duty is not mentioned by Macedo as owed by societies to nonmembers. Macedo discusses humanitarian duties (D), fair dealing (A), and rectification (C), but not cosmopolitan egalitarian duties (B), which involve equal wealth globally. 

Answer: B
