Okay, so I've got this question about determining the humidity of the air when the wet-bulb temperature is 70°F and the dry-bulb temperature is 90°F. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with psychrometric charts or maybe some formulas related to humidity.

Wait, I think the wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures are used to find the relative humidity or the humidity ratio. Oh right, the humidity ratio is the amount of water vapor per pound of dry air. I think the formula involves the saturation pressures at both temperatures.

So, the formula for humidity ratio (w) is something like w = (0.622 * P_w) / P, where P_w is the partial pressure of water vapor, and P is the atmospheric pressure, usually assumed to be 29.92 in Hg or around 14.7 psia. But wait, I might be mixing up formulas here.

Alternatively, there's another approach using the wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. I think the psychrometric chart would be useful here. Since I don't have the chart in front of me, I'll have to recall the process.

The wet-bulb temperature is lower than the dry-bulb because of evaporative cooling. The difference between them is used to determine the humidity. I think the humidity can be found using the equation:

w = ( (P_s_wb * 0.622) ) / (P_atm - P_s_wb )

Where P_s_wb is the saturation pressure at the wet-bulb temperature, and P_atm is atmospheric pressure (like 29.92 in Hg).

So first, I need to find the saturation pressure at 70°F. Let me recall the vapor pressure table. At 70°F, the saturation pressure is about 0.363 psia. Wait, is that right? Because I remember that at 70°F, it's around 0.36 something. Let me think: water boils at 212°F which is 14.7 psia. At 60°F it's about 0.25 psia, 70°F maybe around 0.36, 80°F around 0.51, 90°F about 0.70. So yeah, 0.363 psia sounds right for 70°F.

The atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia. So substituting into the formula:

w = (0.622 * 0.363) / (14.7 - 0.363)

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check that formula. Or maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Oh! Maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

I think the correct formula for humidity ratio is w = (0.622 * P_w) / P_atm, where P_w is the partial pressure of water vapor. But wait, no, that would be if P_w is in psia. Alternatively, if using barometric pressure in mm Hg, the formula might differ.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

w = 0.622 * (P_w / (P_atm - P_w))

Wait no, that can't be right because P_atm minus P_w is the partial pressure of dry air. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is w = (0.622 * P_w) / (P_atm - P_w), where P_atm is the total pressure.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, I think the humidity ratio can be calculated using the formula:

w = (0.622 * (P_s_wb)) / (P_atm - P_s_wb)

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The humidity ratio is the mass of water vapor per mass of dry air. The partial pressure of water vapor is P_w, and the partial pressure of dry air is P_atm - P_w.

Using the ideal gas law, the mass ratio would be (m_water)/(m_air) = (M_water/M_air) * (P_water/P_air), where M_water is 18.015 g/mol and M_air is 28.97 g/mol. So m_water/m_air = (18.015/28.97) * (P_water/(P_atm - P_water)).

So that's approximately (0.622) * (P_water/(P_atm - P_water)).

So yes, that's where the formula comes from. So the humidity ratio w is (0.622 * P_water) / (P_atm - P_water).

So given that P_water is the saturation pressure at the wet-bulb temperature, which is 70°F, which I think is 0.363 psia.

So substituting:

w = (0.622 * 0.363) / (14.7 - 0.363)

Calculating denominator: 14.7 - 0.363 = 14.337 psia.

Numerator: 0.622 * 0.363 ≈ 0.2257.

So w ≈ 0.2257 / 14.337 ≈ 0.01573 lb water per lb dry air.

Wait, that's about 0.0157, which is close to option G: 0.015 lb/lb. But looking at the options, option G is 0.015. But wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the value of P_s_wb. Let me double-check the saturation pressure at 70°F. Oh wait, no, I think it's actually lower. Wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers. Let me think: at 70°F, saturation pressure is about 0.363 psia? Or is that at a higher temp?

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should be using the saturation pressure at the wet-bulb temperature, which is 70°F. But wait, alternatively, I might have mixed up wet bulb and dry bulb. Because the wet bulb is the temperature that water would evaporate until it reaches equilibrium, so the partial pressure of water is determined by the wet bulb.

So yes, P_water is the saturation pressure at 70°F, which is 0.363 psia.

Wait, but when I calculated w, I got approximately 0.0157 lb/lb, which is close to option G: 0.015. But wait, looking at the options, option I is 0.026, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use different units. Wait, perhaps I should use the barometric pressure in inches of mercury, because sometimes these calculations are done that way.

Wait, atmospheric pressure is 29.92 inches Hg at sea level. So maybe I should convert the saturation pressure to inches Hg as well.

Wait, no, because in the formula, both P_water and P_atm should be in the same units. So if I'm using psia, that's fine. Alternatively, perhaps using in Hg units.

Wait, let's try that. Let me convert 0.363 psia to inches Hg.

Because 1 psia is approximately 2.0366 inches Hg. So 0.363 psia * 2.0366 ≈ 0.363 * 2.0366 ≈ 0.738 inches Hg.

But wait, maybe it's easier to use in Hg for P_s_wb. So what's the saturation pressure at 70°F in inches Hg?

I think at 70°F, the saturation pressure is about 28.37 mm Hg. Wait, mm Hg to inches: 1 inch Hg is 25.4 mm Hg. So 28.37 mm Hg is 28.37 / 25.4 ≈ 1.116 inches Hg.

Wait, that's different from the psia. So perhaps I should approach this using inches of mercury.

So, P_water = 1.116 inches Hg.

Atmospheric pressure is 29.92 inches Hg.

So the formula again is w = 0.622 * (P_water / (P_atm - P_water)).

Wait, but in this case, P_water is in inches Hg. Let me plug in the numbers.

P_water = 1.116 in Hg.

P_atm = 29.92 in Hg.

So P_atm - P_water = 29.92 - 1.116 = 28.804 in Hg.

Then, w = (0.622 * 1.116) / 28.804.

Calculating numerator: 0.622 * 1.116 ≈ 0.694.

Denominator: 28.804.

So 0.694 / 28.804 ≈ 0.0241 lb/lb.

Wait, that's approximately 0.024, which is close to option C: 0.025, or option I: 0.026.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy between the two methods? Because in the first approach (using psia), I got 0.0157, and in the second (inches Hg), I got 0.024. That's a big difference. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me check the saturation pressure at 70°F again.

Wait, maybe the saturation pressure in psia at 70°F is indeed around 0.363 psia. But when converting to inches Hg, 0.363 psia is approximately 0.363 * 2.0366 ≈ 0.738 inches Hg.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 70°F saturation is about 28.37 mm Hg, which is 1.116 inches Hg. So which is correct? Because that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact value. Let me think: the saturation pressure of water at 70°F. I recall that at 60°F, it's about 0.25 psia, 70°F is around 0.36, 80°F around 0.51, 90°F about 0.70. So 70°F is 0.363 psia, which is approximately 0.738 inches Hg.

Wait, but in the other approach, I recalled that 70°F is 28.37 mm Hg, which is about 1.116 inches Hg. That's conflicting. So which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Let me think again: 1 atmosphere is 14.7 psia, which is 29.92 inches Hg. So 1 psia is 2.0366 inches Hg.

So if 70°F is 0.363 psia, then in inches Hg, it's 0.363 * 2.0366 ≈ 0.738 inches Hg.

Wait, but perhaps I was correct the first time, and the 28.37 mm Hg is at a different temperature. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up Celsius and Fahrenheit. Let me think: 70°F is about 21.1°C. At 20°C, the saturation pressure is about 17.04 mm Hg, which is approximately 0.669 inches Hg. Wait, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. Let me think of the Antoine equation, which is used to calculate vapor pressure.

The Antoine equation is log10(P) = A - (B/(T + C)), where T is in °C.

For water, the constants are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So at T=21.1°C (70°F), P = 10^(8.14019 - 1810.94/(21.1 + 244.485)).

Calculating denominator: 21.1 + 244.485 = 265.585. So 1810.94 / 265.585 ≈ 6.818.

So 8.14019 - 6.818 ≈ 1.322. So 10^1.322 ≈ 21.07 mm Hg.

Wait, that's about 21.07 mm Hg at 70°F, which is approximately 0.83 inches Hg (since 21.07 / 25.4 ≈ 0.83 inches Hg).

Hmm, so earlier I thought 70°F is 28.37 mm Hg, but according to the Antoine equation, it's around 21.07 mm Hg. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

So 70°F gives P_s_wb ≈ 0.83 inches Hg.

So using that, let's recalculate.

P_water = 0.83 inches Hg.

P_atm = 29.92 inches Hg.

So:

w = 0.622 * (0.83) / (29.92 - 0.83) 

Denominator: 29.92 - 0.83 = 29.09.

Numerator: 0.622 * 0.83 ≈ 0.516.

So w ≈ 0.516 / 29.09 ≈ 0.0177 lb/lb.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.0177, which is close to option F: 0.018 or option B: 0.022.

Wait, but earlier when I used psia, with P_water=0.363 psia, I got 0.0157 lb/lb, which would be near option G: 0.015.

But now with corrected P_water=0.83 inches Hg, I get w≈0.0177, which is near 0.018, option F.

But this is confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the psychrometric chart. Since I don't have it, I'll try to recall how to read it.

At a dry-bulb temperature of 90°F and a wet-bulb of 70°F, the humidity ratio (w) is the ordinate (vertical scale) where these two lines intersect.

Alternatively, I remember that the humidity ratio can be found using the formula involving the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures.

Another formula I came across is:

w = ( (2501 - 2.326 T_wb + (1.443 * 10^-3) T_wb^2) ) / (2371.5 - 1.237 T_db) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula from the psychrometric chart equations.

Wait, another approach is the formula for humidity ratio from wet and dry bulb temperatures:

w = ( (P_s_wb * 0.622) ) / (P_atm - P_s_wb )

But I think I've been going in circles. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for relative humidity, but that's not what's being asked here. The question is about the humidity ratio, which is the mass of water per mass of dry air.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

w = (0.622 * P_w) / (P_atm - P_w)

Where P_w is the vapor pressure, which is the saturation pressure at the wet-bulb temperature.

So if I have P_w as 0.363 psia (70°F), then:

w = (0.622 * 0.363) / (14.7 - 0.363) = (0.2257) / (14.337) ≈ 0.0157 lb/lb.

That's approximately 0.0157 lb water per lb dry air, which would be closest to option G: 0.015.

But earlier, when I used the Antoine equation, I got a different value. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, Antoine equation for water in the range of 1°C to 100°C uses the formula:

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T + 244.485)

Where P is in mm Hg and T is in °C.

So at T=21.1°C (70°F), the calculation is:

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(21.1 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - (1810.94/265.585) ≈ 8.14019 - 6.8183 ≈ 1.3219.

So P = 10^1.3219 ≈ 21 mm Hg. So 21 mm Hg is approximately 0.83 inches Hg.

So P_w = 0.83 inches Hg.

So now, using the formula with inches Hg:

w = 0.622 * (0.83) / (29.92 - 0.83).

Wait, 29.92 is atmospheric pressure in inches Hg.

So denominator is 29.92 - 0.83 = 29.09.

Numerator: 0.622 * 0.83 = 0.516.

So w = 0.516 / 29.09 ≈ 0.0177 lb/lb.

Hmm, that's 0.0177, which is close to option F: 0.018.

But earlier, when using psia, I got 0.0157, which is option G. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from using different units. The correct formula should be unit-consistent.

Wait, let's try another approach. Maybe the formula is:

w = ( (0.622 * P_s_wb ) ) / ( P_atm - P_s_wb )

Where P_s_wb is in psia, and P_atm is 14.7 psia.

So P_s_wb at 70°F is 0.363 psia.

So w = (0.622 * 0.363) / (14.7 - 0.363) = 0.2257 / 14.337 ≈ 0.0157 lb/lb.

So that's about 0.0157, which is option G: 0.015.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use P_atm as 29.92 in Hg, but then I must convert P_s_wb to in Hg as well.

P_s_wb at 70°F is 0.363 psia. Since 1 psia = 2.0366 in Hg, P_s_wb = 0.363 * 2.0366 ≈ 0.738 in Hg.

Then, using the formula:

w = (0.622 * 0.738) / (29.92 - 0.738) = (0.458) / 29.182 ≈ 0.0157 lb/lb.

Wait, that's the same as before, 0.0157 lb/lb. So that's consistent.

Wait, but earlier when I used P_s_wb as 0.83 in Hg, I got 0.0177 lb/lb. That must have been because of a miscalculation in the Antoine equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine equation
