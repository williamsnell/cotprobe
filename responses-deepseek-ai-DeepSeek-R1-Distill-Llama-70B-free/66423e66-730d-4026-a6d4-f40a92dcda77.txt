Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a nursery rhyme related to Columbus. Hmm, I remember learning a rhyme about Columbus when I was a kid. Let me think... Oh right, it's something like "In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue." Oh wait, so the rhyme says "ocean blue." So the question is asking what type of ocean he sailed in 1492 according to the rhyme. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the options, option G is "blue." That must be the answer because the rhyme specifically mentions "ocean blue." Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. The rhyme doesn't mention anything about the ocean being calm, stormy, dangerous, vast, etc. It's just "blue." So yeah, G is definitely the right choice.
