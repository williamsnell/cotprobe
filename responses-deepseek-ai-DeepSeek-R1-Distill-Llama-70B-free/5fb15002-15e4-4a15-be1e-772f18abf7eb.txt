Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment."
Brown v. Board of Education, 1954

Options:

A: The New Deal
B: The Fair Deal
C: The New Frontier
D: Reconstruction
E: The Square Deal
F: The Great Society
G: The Progressive Era

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the desegregation of schools and which initiative it was a response to. Let me try to break this down.

The question mentions Brown v. Board of Education, which I remember was a landmark Supreme Court case in 1954. It declared that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal," so segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. That led to the desegregation of schools in the United States.

The question is asking what initiative the desegregation was responding to, specifically because of unfulfilled promises. The options are A through J, each representing different historical initiatives.

First, I need to understand each option to see which one fits best. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The New Deal. That was a series of programs and policies implemented by Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, mainly in the 1930s. It focused on relief, recovery, and reform for economic issues. While it did a lot for the economy, I don't recall it being directly tied to civil rights or desegregation promises.

Option B: The Fair Deal. That was Harry Truman's program after WWII, continuing some New Deal ideas. It included civil rights initiatives, actually. Truman did take some steps towards civil rights, like ending segregation in the military. But the Fair Deal was more about domestic policies post-war. I'm not sure if desegregation of schools was a direct response to unfulfilled promises from the Fair Deal.

Option C: The New Frontier. That's John F. Kennedy's program. It was in the early 1960s, after Brown v. Board. So Brown was in 1954, which is before the New Frontier. I don't think this is the right answer because the timing is off. The desegregation was a response to something before Kennedy's time.

Option D: Reconstruction. That's the period right after the Civil War, from 1865 to 1877. During Reconstruction, there were amendments like the 13th, 14th, and 15th, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship, and gave voting rights to African American men. However, after Reconstruction, many of the promises, like true equality and land redistribution (the "40 acres and a mule"), weren't fulfilled. This led to Jim Crow laws and segregation. So Brown v. Board was addressing the failure of Reconstruction's promises, I think.

Option E: The Square Deal. That was Theodore Roosevelt's policy, which focused on trust-busting, consumer protection, and conservation. Not related to civil rights or desegregation.

Option F: The Great Society. That's Lyndon B. Johnson's initiative in the mid-1960s, which included a lot of social programs and civil rights legislation. Brown v. Board was about a decade before this, so I don't think it's the answer.

Option G: The Progressive Era. This was in the early 20th century, from about 1890 to 1920. Progressives worked on various reforms, including some social issues, but civil rights for African Americans wasn't a major focus. In fact, many Progressives either ignored or even supported segregation in some cases. So this doesn't seem right.

Option H: The War on Poverty. Another Johnson-era initiative, part of the Great Society. It came after Brown, so probably not.

Option I: The Emancipation Proclamation. Issued by Lincoln in 1863, it freed slaves in Confederate states. But it didn't address education or equality beyond freedom. The promises here were about ending slavery, not specifically about desegregation which came much later.

Option J: The Civil Rights Act. Wait, the Civil Rights Act was in 1964, which was after Brown. So Brown was a response to something before that. Plus, the Civil Rights Act was more of a response to the civil rights movement that followed Brown, I think.

Putting it all together, the key is that Brown v. Board addressed the failure of Reconstruction's promises. Reconstruction had amendments that should have provided equality, but in reality, segregation and Jim Crow laws persisted. So when the question says desegregation was a response to unfulfilled promises, it's pointing back to the failures of Reconstruction era initiatives.

So the answer should be D: Reconstruction.

The question asks which initiative desegregation of schools was responding to, due to unfulfilled promises. The Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954 ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, leading to desegregation. To determine the correct answer, each option must be analyzed:

- **A: The New Deal**: Focused on economic recovery during the Great Depression and did not address civil rights or desegregation.
- **B: The Fair Deal**: Included some civil rights initiatives but was not directly tied to the desegregation of schools.
- **C: The New Frontier**: Occurred after Brown v. Board, so timing is off.
- **D: Reconstruction**: The period after the Civil War when the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were passed, promising equality. However, these promises were unfulfilled, leading to segregation and Jim Crow laws, which Brown v. Board addressed.
- **E: The Square Deal**: Focused on trust-busting and conservation, unrelated to civil rights.
- **F: The Great Society**: Occurred after Brown v. Board and was a response to the civil rights movement.
- **G: The Progressive Era**: Did not prioritize civil rights for African Americans.
- **H: The War on Poverty**: Part of the Great Society and occurred after Brown.
- **I: The Emancipation Proclamation**: Freed slaves but did not address education or equality.
- **J: The Civil Rights Act**: Came after Brown and was a response to the civil rights movement.

The desegregation of schools was a response to the unfulfilled promises of Reconstruction, which failed to achieve true equality despite the 14th Amendment's guarantees. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
