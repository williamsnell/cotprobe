Okay, so I've got this question here about the percentage of adults aged 18 or older who were overweight as of 2016. The options are A through J, with various percentages. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

First, I should probably remember some general facts about obesity rates. I think obesity has been a growing issue in many countries, especially in places like the United States. But wait, the question is about being overweight, not just obese. So I need to consider both.

I recall that the World Health Organization (WHO) has some data on this. From what I remember, more than half of the adult population in many countries is overweight. But I'm not sure of the exact percentage. Let me think about the numbers I've heard before.

I think in the US, the CDC reported that around 70% of adults are overweight or obese. But wait, that's for the US specifically. The question doesn't specify a country, so maybe it's a global average. Or perhaps it's referring to a specific region like the Americas or Europe.

Wait, the question says "as of 2016," so I should think about data from around that time. I remember that globally, the prevalence of overweight adults was significant. I think the WHO had estimates that about two-thirds of the world's population lives in countries where more people die from being overweight than underweight. But that's not exactly the same as the percentage of adults who are overweight.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up data. Let me try to break it down. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or higher. Obesity is BMI 30 or higher. So the percentage of adults who are overweight would include both those who are overweight and those who are obese.

I think in developed countries, the percentage is higher. For example, in the US, it's around 70% as I thought earlier. But globally, maybe it's lower because some regions have lower rates. But wait, the question doesn't specify a region, so maybe it's referring to the entire world population.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to a specific region. Wait, the way it's phrased, "about what percentage of adults aged 18 years or older were overweight?" without any country specified. Maybe it's a global average. But I'm not sure what the global average was in 2016.

Wait, another angle: I remember that the World Health Organization's data from 2016 showed that globally, 39% of adults were overweight, and 13% were obese. So that would make the total percentage of adults overweight or obese around 52%. But wait, the question is asking just for overweight, not including obese? Or is it including both?

Wait, no, the term "overweight" sometimes includes both overweight and obesity. Or sometimes, it's used to mean BMI ≥25, which includes both. So perhaps the 39% is just overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and 13% is obese (BMI ≥30). So total would be 52% overweight or obese.

But the question is asking specifically about overweight, not including obese? Or is it using "overweight" to include both? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I think in some contexts, "overweight" is used to mean the same as "overweight or obese." So if the WHO says that 39% were overweight and 13% obese, the total would be 52%. But if the question is asking just for overweight, it's 39%. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the options given are 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. So if the global average is about 39% overweight (BMI 25+), then that's close to 40%, which is option B. But if it's considering overweight as including both overweight and obese, then 52% would be around 50%, which is option C.

But I'm a bit torn here. Another approach: think about the US data. In the US, as I said, about 70% of adults are overweight or obese. So that's option E. But if the question is global, it's lower. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific region like Europe.

Wait, I think the question is from a general knowledge perspective, possibly referring to global data. So if in 2016, about 39% of adults worldwide were overweight (BMI ≥25), that's closest to 40%, option B. But if the question is using "overweight" to include both categories, then it's about 52%, which is closest to 50%, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Americas. In the Americas, the percentage is higher. For example, in the US, it's around 70%, but that's just one country. Maybe the question is assuming a more developed country context.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify a region. So I'm a bit stuck. Let's think again. The options are A (100%) which seems too high, B (40%), C (50%), D (20%), E (70%), F (30%), G (60%), H (90%), I (80%), J (10%).

If the correct figure is around 39% globally, then 40% (B) would be the answer. But if the question is referring to the US, then it's 70% (E). But without knowing the region, I'm not certain.

Wait, the question says "as of 2016," so perhaps I should recall specific data points. I think the WHO's World Health Statistics 2016 report stated that in 2014, 39% of adults worldwide were overweight. So that would align with option B, 40%.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the percentage in developed countries. In that case, the number would be higher. But again, without the region specified, it's a bit tricky.

Another thought: sometimes "overweight" is used to mean all individuals with BMI over 25, including those who are obese. So if the WHO says 39% were overweight (BMI ≥25), that's 39%, so the closest option is B, 40%.

I think that's the most reasonable choice unless the question is referring to a specific country with higher rates. But since the question doesn't specify, I'll go with the global average which is around 40%, so option B.

The question asks about the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight as of 2016. To determine this, it's important to consider the definition of "overweight," which typically includes individuals with a BMI of 25 or higher. This category encompasses both those who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and those who are obese (BMI 30 or higher).

Global data from the World Health Organization (WHO) around 2016 indicates that approximately 39% of adults worldwide were overweight (BMI ≥25). This figure aligns closely with the option of 40%. While some regions, such as the United States, reported higher percentages (around 70%), the question does not specify a particular country or region, suggesting a global context. Therefore, the most reasonable answer, based on global averages, is 40%.

Answer: B
