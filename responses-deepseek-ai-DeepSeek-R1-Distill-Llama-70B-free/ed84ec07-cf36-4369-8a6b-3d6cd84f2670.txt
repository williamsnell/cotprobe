Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the specific volume and density of steam at a certain pressure and temperature. The given data includes a table with various gases, their properties, and some options to choose from. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that specific volume is the volume per unit mass of a substance, and density is mass per unit volume. For an ideal gas, the equation PV = nRT should be applicable. But wait, since we're dealing with specific volume, maybe it's better to use the specific form of the ideal gas equation.

Looking at the table, I see that for steam (H2O), the molecular weight is 18.016, and its gas constant R is 85.81 ft·lb/lbm. Oh right, the specific gas constant R is given per pound mass, so that should be useful here.

The problem gives the pressure as 90 lb/in² and the temperature as 650°F. I think I need to convert these into absolute units because the ideal gas law requires absolute pressure and temperature.

So, pressure: 90 lb/in². To convert to lb/ft², since 1 ft is 12 inches, 1 ft² is (12)^2 = 144 in². So, 90 lb/in² is 90 * 144 lb/ft². Let me calculate that. 90 * 144 is 12960 lb/ft².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the gas constant R is in ft·lb/lbm, so the units should match. The pressure should be in lb/ft², and temperature in absolute degrees. So, the pressure is 90 psi, which is 90 lb/in² to lb/ft².

Alternatively, I remember that 1 atm is about 14.7 psi, which is 14.7 lb/in². But I'm not sure if that helps here. Oh wait, another approach: to convert psi to lb/ft², since 1 psi is 144 lb/ft². Because 1 psi is 1 lb per square inch, and 1 ft² is 144 in², so 1 psi is 144 lb/ft². So 90 psi is 90 * 144 lb/ft². Let me compute that: 90 * 144. 90*100=9000, 90*44=3960, so 9000+3960=12960 lb/ft².

Next, temperature needs to be in absolute units. Fahrenheit to Rankine. The formula is T(R) = T(F) + 459.67. So 650°F is 650 + 459.67 = 1109.67 R.

Now, the specific volume v is given by the ideal gas equation. Since we're dealing with specific volume, the equation is Pv = R T. Wait, no, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, but in specific terms, where n is moles, and specific volume is V/m (volume per mass), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of specific variables.

Wait, for specific volume v, which is volume per mass, the equation can be written as P * v = R * T. Wait, let me make sure. Because in the ideal gas equation, PV = nRT, and n is moles, which is mass (m) divided by molecular weight (M). So, PV = (m/M) R T. So, solving for v (which is V/m), we get v = (R T)/(P M). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, PV = nRT => P V = (m/M) R T. Then, since v = V/m, V = m v. Substitute into PV = (m/M) R T:

P (m v) = (m/M) R T. The mass m cancels out, so P v = (R T) / M. Wait, no, wait: let me re-express.

Wait, if PV = (m/M) RT, then v = V/m = (RT)/(P M). So, v = (R T) / (P M).

Wait, but looking at the units, R is in ft·lb/lbm. So, the units would be (ft·lb/lbm) * (R) / (lb/ft² * lbm). Hmm, that might get a bit messy, but perhaps I'll just proceed with the numbers.

So, R for steam is 85.81 ft·lb/lbm.

So, v = (R T) / (P M). Wait no, wait again. Let me get this right. Wait, maybe I should be using the specific gas equation in terms of v.

Wait, another approach: the ideal gas equation can be written as v = R T / (P), where R is the specific gas constant. Wait, but R is given as per lbm, so that should work.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up units. Because the R here is in ft·lb/lbm, and the pressure is in lb/ft², and temperature in R.

So, let me write the equation correctly.

The ideal gas law is Pv = R T. Wait, no: the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But n is m/M, so PV = (m/M) R T.

Then, v = V/m = (R T) / (P M).

Wait, that makes sense. So v = (R T) / (P M).

Wait, let me check the units:

R is in ft·lb/lbm

T is in R (which is °F + 459.67)

P is in lb/ft²

M is in lbm/lbmol.

So, substituting, v would have units:

(ft·lb/lbm) * R / ( (lb/ft²) * (lbm/lbmol) )

Wait, that doesn't look right. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation in terms of specific volume correctly.

Another approach: The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT.

So, for specific volume v = V/m, where m is mass, we can write n = m/M, where M is molecular weight.

So, PV = (m/M) RT.

Divide both sides by m:

P v = (R T)/M.

So, v = (R T) / (P M).

Wait, that seems correct.

So, R is 85.81 ft·lb/lbm, T is 1109.67 R, P is 12960 lb/ft², M is 18.016 lbm/lbmol.

So, plug in the numbers:

v = (85.81 * 1109.67) / (12960 * 18.016)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

First, compute 85.81 * 1109.67.

Let me approximate:

85 * 1100 = 93,500.

But more accurately:

85.81 * 1109.67

Let me calculate 85.81 * 1100 = 85.81 * 1000 = 85,810; 85.81 * 100 = 8,581 → total 94,391.

Then, 85.81 * 9.67 ≈ 85.81 * 10 = 858.1, minus 85.81 * 0.33 ≈ 28.3. So approx 858.1 - 28.3 = 829.8.

So total numerator is approximately 94,391 + 829.8 ≈ 95,220.8 ft·lb/lbm * R.

Denominator: 12960 lb/ft² * 18.016 lbm/lbmol.

12960 * 18 = 232,680. 12960 * 0.016 is 207.36. So total denominator is 232,680 + 207.36 = 232,887.36 lb/(ft²·lbmol).

So v ≈ 95,220.8 / 232,887.36.

Let me compute this division. Let's see:

Approx, 95,220 / 232,887 → Let's see, 232,887 is about 2.32887e5.

95,220 is about 9.522e4.

So 9.522e4 / 2.32887e5 ≈ 0.409.

So v ≈ 0.409 ft³/lbm.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the specific volumes are all around 6-8 ft³/lbm. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm. Let me double-check the equation. Oh wait, I think I might have miscalculated the denominator. Wait, let's re-express the equation.

Wait, v = (R*T)/(P * M).

But wait, R is 85.81 ft·lb/lbm.

T is 1109.67 R.

P is 12960 lb/ft².

M is 18.016 lbm/lbmol.

So, the units: (ft·lb/lbm) * (R) / ( (lb/ft²) * (lbm/lbmol) )

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Maybe I should have converted units earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used absolute pressure in psia, but wait, 90 lb/in² is 90 psi. So maybe it's easier to work in psi units instead of lb/ft². Let's try that approach.

Wait, because 1 atm is 14.7 psi, but perhaps if I use R in terms that can handle psi, then I can get the units right.

Alternatively, to avoid confusion, perhaps I should use the form of the ideal gas equation that uses specific volume.

Wait, specific volume v is in ft³/lbm. So, let's think again.

The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT.

But n = m/M, so PV = (m/M) RT → P V = (m R T)/M.

So, V = (m R T) / (P M).

Since v = V/m, then v = (R T) / (P M).

Wait, that's the same as before.

So, substituting the numbers:

R = 85.81 ft·lb/lbm

T = 1109.67 R

P = 90 psi (but earlier converted to 12960 lb/ft²)

Wait, perhaps I should convert P into psia. Because 90 lb/in² is 90 psi, but standard atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi, so absolute pressure is 90 psi + 14.7 psi? Wait no, wait: in gas equations, when using psi, you need to add atmospheric pressure if the given pressure is gauge. But wait, in the problem statement, is the pressure given as absolute or gauge? It just says 90 lb/in², so I think that's gauge pressure, so I have to add atmospheric pressure to get absolute pressure.

Wait, but wait, in the table, the R is given as 85.81 ft·lb/lbm. I might have to check if that R is based on lb absolute or gauge. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the pressure to absolute pressure in lb/ft².

Wait, 90 psi gauge is 90 psi above atmospheric. So, atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, so absolute pressure is 90 + 14.7 = 104.7 psi absolute.

But wait, 1 psi is 144 lb/ft², so 104.7 psi is 104.7 * 144 lb/ft².

Wait, but earlier I thought 90 psi was 90 * 144 = 12960 lb/ft². Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because 90 psi is 90 pounds per square inch, which is 90 * 144 lb/ft², yes. But if it's gauge pressure, then the absolute pressure is 90 psi + 14.7 psi = 104.7 psi. So absolute pressure is 104.7 psi, which is 104.7 * 144 lb/ft².

Wait, but wait, the problem gives the pressure as 90 lb/in². But that's 90 psi, which is an absolute pressure, not gauge. Or is it? Because in engineering contexts, pressure given without specification is often absolute, but sometimes gauge. Hmm. Wait, but in this case, the table gives R as 85.81 ft·lb/lbm, which I think is for absolute pressure. So perhaps I should have used absolute pressure.

Wait, to clarify, when using the ideal gas law, you must use absolute pressure. So if the given pressure is 90 psi gauge, then absolute pressure would be 90 + 14.7 = 104.7 psia. But if it's 90 psia, then no addition is needed. The question doesn't specify, so this is a bit ambiguous. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "a pressure of 90 lb/in²" — so that's 90 psi. But in engineering, sometimes "pressure" is given as absolute, but sometimes as gauge. Hmm. Wait, but in thermodynamics, when the pressure is given without any qualifiers, it's usually taken as absolute. So perhaps I shouldn't add 14.7 psi.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 90 psi was 90 lb/in², which is 12960 lb/ft². So, in that case, P is 12960 lb/ft² absolute.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting approaches here. Let me try to proceed with the initial calculation where P is 12960 lb/ft².

So v = (85.81 * 1109.67) / (12960 * 18.016)

Compute numerator: 85.81 * 1109.67 ≈ let's compute it more accurately.

85.81 * 1100 = 85.81 * 1000 + 85.81 * 100 = 85,810 + 8,581 = 94,391.

Then, 85.81 * 9.67 = ?

Compute 85.81 * 9 = 772.29

85.81 * 0.67 ≈ 57.54

So total 772.29 +57.54 ≈ 829.83.

So total numerator is 94,391 + 829.83 ≈ 95,220.83 ft·lb/lbm * R.

Denominator: 12,960 lb/ft² * 18.016 lbm/lbmol = ?

12,960 * 18 = 232,  12,960 * 0.016 = 207.36.

So 232,680 + 207.36 = 232,887.36 (lb/ft² * lbm/lbmol).

So v = 95,220.83 / 232,887.36 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 95.22083 / 232.88736 ≈ 0.409 ft³/lbm.

Wait, that's specific volume. But looking at the options, all the specific volumes are around 6-8 ft³/lbm. So 0.4 is way too low. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the units for R. Because in the table, R is given as 85.81 ft·lb/lbm. But when using the ideal gas equation, the units have to be consistent. So maybe I should check if that R is per mole or per pound mass.

Wait, the table says "Gas constant ft-lb/lb R", so that's per pound mass. So that should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert temperature to Rankine correctly. 650°F is indeed 650 + 459.67 = 1109.67 R. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have used the molecular weight in lbm/lbmol, which is correct as 18.016.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the division. Let me compute 95,220.83 / 232,887.36.

Let me do this division more accurately. Let's see:

232,887.36 × 0.4 = 93,154.944

Subtract that from 95,220.83 → 95,220.83 -93,154.944=2,065.886.

So the remainder is 2,065.886. Now, 232,887.36 × 0.0088 ≈ 2,048. Let's see: 232,887.36 * 0.008 = 1,863.09888, and 232,887.36 *0.0008=186.309888. So 0.0088 is approx 1,863.1 + 186.3 ≈ 2,049.4.

So 0.4 + 0.0088 = 0.4088, with a small remainder. So v ≈ 0.4088 ft³/lbm.

But that's way lower than the options. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe it's v = (R T) / (P), but without dividing by M? Because that would make more sense given the options.

Wait, let me think again. The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT. Since n is moles, which is mass divided by molecular weight (n = m/M), then PV = (m/M) RT. So, V = (m R T) / (P M). Then, specific volume v is V/m = (R T) / (P M).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the R value is per mole, not per pound mass. Because sometimes, R is given as R = R_universal / M, where R_universal is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). So perhaps I should be using that approach instead.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let me compute using the universal gas constant.

The universal gas constant R_u is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

So, for steam, M = 18.016 lbm/lbmol.

So the specific gas constant R would be R = R_u / M = 10.7316 / 18.016 ≈ 0.5957 psi·ft³/(lbm·R).

Wait, but the R in the table is given as 85.81 ft·lb/lbm. So perhaps that's another unit form.

Wait, maybe I should use R_u in different units. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert R_u into the same units as given in the table.

Wait, R_u in ft·lb/lbm·R. Let me compute that.

Since 1 psi is 1 lb/in², and 1 ft is 12 in, so 1 psi = 1
