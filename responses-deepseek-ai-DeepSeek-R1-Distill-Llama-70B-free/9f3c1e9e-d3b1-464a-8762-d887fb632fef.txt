Okay, so I have this problem about estimating the maximum error in the area of a rectangle using differentials. Hmm, I remember that differentials can be used to approximate errors in calculations. Let me think about how this works.

The rectangle has a length of 30 cm and a width of 24 cm. The error in each measurement is at most 0.1 cm. I need to find the maximum error in the area.

Wait, the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, right? So normally, the area would be 30 cm * 24 cm = 720 cm². But the question is about the error in this area, not the area itself.

I think I should use differentials for error estimation. So, if a function depends on variables x and y, the differential of the function is given by the partial derivatives multiplied by the errors in x and y, added together.

The formula I remember is: dA = (∂A/∂x)dx + (∂A/∂y)dy.

Where A is the area (x*y), dx is the error in x (length), and dy is the error in y (width).

Let me compute each part. The partial derivative of A with respect to x is y, and with respect to y is x. So:

dA = (y)dx + (x)dy.

Given that x is 30 cm, y is 24 cm, dx is 0.1 cm, and dy is also 0.1 cm.

Plugging in the numbers:

dA = (24)(0.1) + (30)(0.1) = 2.4 + 3.0 = 5.4 cm².

Wait, but I'm being asked for the maximum error. Oh, but wait, when using differentials, is this the maximum possible error? I think so, because differentials give an approximation of the error, assuming the errors are small. And since the maximum error in each measurement is 0.1, this should give the maximum error in area.

So looking at the options, option B is 5.4 cm². That looks right.

But wait, I should double-check. Let me think again. The area is x*y. The maximum error in x is ±0.1, same for y. But how do these errors affect the area? The maximum error would occur when both x and y are overestimated, right? Because if both are larger, the area error would be larger than if one is larger and the other smaller.

Wait, but in differentials, are we considering the worst case? The differential gives a linear approximation, but the actual maximum error could be a bit different. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the maximum possible area considering the maximum errors.

Wait, the true area when x is 30.1 and y is 24.1 would be 30.1 *24.1. Let me compute that.

30 *24 is 720. 30*0.1 is 3, 0.1*24 is 2.4, and 0.1*0.1 is 0.01. So 720 +3 +2.4 +0.01 = 725.41 cm². So the difference from 720 is 5.41 cm². Which is approximately 5.4 cm², matching the earlier value.

Wait, but wait, the maximum error could also occur if one is at max positive and the other at max negative. No, because that would actually give a smaller area. Like, x is 30.1 and y is 23.9. The area would be 30.1*23.9. Let's see: 30*23.9 is 717, 0.1*23.9 is 2.39. So 717+2.39=719.39. So difference is 719.39 -720 = -0.61. So the error is 0.61 in that case, which is much less than 5.4. So the maximum error is when both are overestimated.

So the maximum possible area is 30.1 *24.1 = 725.41, so the error is 5.41, which is about 5.4 cm². So option B is correct.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the maximum error in area is when both length and width are at their maximum possible errors. So using differentials, the calculation gives 5.4, which matches. So I think I'm confident that the answer is B:5.4 cm².

To estimate the maximum error in the calculated area of the rectangle using differentials, we start with the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[
A = x \cdot y
\]

where \( x \) is the length and \( y \) is the width. The differential approximation for the error in the area is given by:

\[
dA = \frac{\partial A}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial A}{\partial y} dy
\]

Here, \( dx \) and \( dy \) represent the maximum errors in the measurements of \( x \) and \( y \), respectively. From the problem, \( x = 30 \, \mathrm{cm} \), \( y = 24 \, \mathrm{cm} \), \( dx = 0.1 \, \mathrm{cm} \), and \( dy = 0.1 \, \mathrm{cm} \). The partial derivatives are:

\[
\frac{\partial A}{\partial x} = y, \quad \frac{\partial A}{\partial y} = x
\]

Substituting these values into the differential formula:

\[
dA = (24)(0.1) + (30)(0.1) = 2.4 + 3.0 = 5.4 \, \mathrm{cm}^2
\]

This calculation shows that the maximum error in the area is approximately \( 5.4 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \). To confirm, we can compute the area when both \( x \) and \( y \) are at their maximum measured values (\( x = 30.1 \, \mathrm{cm} \), \( y = 24.1 \, \mathrm{cm} \)):

\[
A_{\text{max}} = 30.1 \cdot 24.1 = 725.41 \, \mathrm{cm}^2
\]

The error is then:

\[
\Delta A = A_{\text{max}} - A = 725.41 - 720 = 5.41 \, \mathrm{cm}^2
\]

This matches the result from the differential approximation. Therefore, the maximum error in the calculated area is \( 5.4 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \), corresponding to option **B**.
