Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Calculate the work needed for a 65 kg person to climb through 4.0 meters on the surface of the Earth. And there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I think this is more of a basic physics problem related to work and gravitational potential energy. Let me think about what I remember.

Work done against gravity when you lift something is equal to the change in gravitational potential energy. The formula for gravitational potential energy (U) is U = mgh, where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height climbed.

So, the work done (W) should be equal to mgh. That makes sense because when you do work against gravity, you're increasing the potential energy of the object (in this case, the person).

Let's break down the given values. The mass (m) is 65 kg. The height (h) is 4.0 meters. What's the value of g? I remember that on Earth's surface, g is approximately 9.8 m/s².

So plugging in the numbers: W = 65 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 4.0 m.

Wait, let me do the multiplication step by step. First, 65 kg multiplied by 9.8 m/s². 65 times 9 is 585, and 65 times 0.8 is 52. So 585 +52 =637. So 65*9.8=637. N, because kg·m/s² is a Newton.

Then multiply that by 4 meters. So 637 N *4 m = 2548 Joules. Because work is in Joules, which is N·m.

Hmm, looking at the options, they are all in the 1.2e3 to 3.8e3 range. So 2548 J is approximately 2.5e3 J. Let me check the options again.

Options: 

A: 1.5e3 J

B:3.5e3

C:1.8e3

D:2.4e3

E:3.8e3

F:2.8e3

G:2.6e3

H:3.2e3

I:1.2e3

J:2.0e3

Wait, the closest to 2548 is 2.5e3, but none of the options have that. The options go D:2.4, G:2.6, F:2.8, J:2.0.

So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 65 kg times 9.8 m/s² is indeed 637 N. 637 times 4 is 2548 J.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.5e3. Let me see if I miscalculated something.

Oh wait, maybe I should round it differently. Let me compute 65*9.8 more accurately. 65 *9 is 585, 65*0.8=52, so 585+52=637. So that's correct.

Then 637 *4 = 2548 J. So approximately 2.5e3 J. Looking at the options, the closest ones are D (2.4e3), G (2.6e3), and J is 2.0e3. So none of these exactly match. Hmm. Did I miss a step?

Wait, perhaps the question is about work done, but sometimes in thermodynamics, signs matter. But in this context, work done by the person is positive, and work done against gravity is positive as well. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should use g as 10 m/s² for an approximate calculation, but the question didn't state that. The question says to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise, but that part doesn't apply here because it's a mechanics problem, not thermodynamics. So g should be 9.8 m/s², not 10.

Wait, perhaps the person's weight is considered, but no, the formula is correct. Wait, maybe the height is 4.0 meters, or is it 4.0 meters vertically? Oh, the question says "climb through 4.0 m on the surface of the Earth." So it's a vertical climb, so h is 4.0 meters.

Hmm. So the correct answer should be 2548 J, which is approximately 2.5e3 J. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: maybe the question is asking for work done, but in physics, work done by the person would be positive, but work done on the person by gravity is negative. But in the context of the question, when someone climbs, the work they do is against gravity, so the work is positive. So my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects g to be 9.81 m/s². Let me try that.

So 65 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 638.65 N. Multiply by 4 m: 638.65 *4 = 2554.6 J. Still about 2555 J, which is 2.555e3 J. So approximately 2.56e3 J, which is 2.6e3 J, which is option G.

Ah, maybe I should have used 9.81 instead of 9.8. Let's see:

With 9.81:

65 *9.81 = let's calculate: 60*9.81=588.6, 5*9.81=49.05. So 588.6 +49.05 = 637.65. Then times 4 gives 637.65 *4 = 2550.6 J, which is 2.55e3, so 2.55 is closer to G (2.6e3) than D (2.4e3). So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, but maybe the question expects using g=9.8 m/s², so 2548 J, which is 2.548e3, which is approximately 2.5e3. But the options don't have that. So the closest is either 2.4e3 (D) or 2.6e3 (G). So perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion somewhere, but the units all seem correct: kg, meters, seconds.

Wait, maybe the question expects the use of g=10 m/s² for simplicity, which would make the calculation 65*10*4=2600 J, which is 2.6e3 J, matching option G.

That's probably it. The problem might be using g=10 for an approximate calculation. Let me check that.

If g=10, then 65*10 =650 N. 650 *4=2600 J. So that's 2.6e3 J, which is option G.

But wait, the question didn't specify to use g=10. It said to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise, but nothing about g. Hmm, but in many introductory physics problems, g is taken as 10 m/s² for simplicity unless stated otherwise.

So perhaps in this question, they expect us to use g=10. Then the answer would be 2600 J, option G.

Alternatively, if using 9.8, the answer isn't listed, which is confusing. So perhaps the intended approach is to approximate g=10, making the answer G.

So among the options, G is 2.6e3, which would be the correct choice.

To calculate the work needed for a 65 kg person to climb 4.0 m on the surface of the Earth, we use the formula for gravitational potential energy, which is equivalent to the work done against gravity:

\[
W = mgh
\]

Here:
- \( m = 65 \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the person),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( h = 4.0 \, \mathrm{m} \) (height climbed).

First, calculate the weight of the person:

\[
65 \times 9.8 = 637 \, \mathrm{N}
\]

Then, calculate the work done:

\[
637 \times 4.0 = 2548 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

This result, \( 2548 \, \mathrm{J} \), is approximately \( 2.5 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \). However, none of the provided options exactly match this value. The closest options are:

- \( 2.4 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \) (option D),
- \( 2.6 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \) (option G).

If we approximate \( g = 10 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \) for simplicity, as is common in introductory physics problems, the calculation becomes:

\[
65 \times 10 \times 4.0 = 2600 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

This gives \( 2.6 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \), which matches option G. Given that the question does not explicitly state the value of \( g \), it is reasonable to assume \( g = 10 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \) for this problem.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: \( 2.6 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \)**

Answer: G
