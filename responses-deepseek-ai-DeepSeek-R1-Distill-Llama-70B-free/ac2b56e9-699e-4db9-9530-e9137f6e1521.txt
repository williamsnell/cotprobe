Question:

A defendant, a nurse at a nursing home, is charged with murdering a resident at the home by adding an allegedly lethal substance to the resident's food. At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?

Options:

A: Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.
B: No, because the treatise must be confirmed by an expert in the field before being admissible.
C: Yes, because the treatise is a public document and therefore exempt from the hearsay rule.
D: No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.
E: Yes, because the prosecutor is allowed to introduce evidence without calling witnesses.
F: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.
G: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.
H: Yes, because the prosecution is merely providing evidence that supports their claim.
I: No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.
J: No, because the substance's lethal nature is not relevant to the case.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence admissibility in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a defendant, who's a nurse at a nursing home, is charged with murdering a resident by adding a lethal substance to their food. At trial, the prosecutor wants to prove that the substance could cause death. Instead of calling a witness, the prosecutor offers to read several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the claim that the substance is lethal.

The question is whether this evidence is admissible. The options are from A to J.

I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the prosecutor is offering a treatise, which is a written statement, to prove the substance is lethal. That sounds like hearsay because it's a statement from another source (the treatise authors) being used for its truth.

But wait, I also recall that there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is the learned treatise exception. I think this applies when a witness, usually an expert, refers to a treatise during their testimony to support their opinion. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 803(18) covers this. It says that if the treatise is called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert during direct examination, and it's established as reliable, then the court may admit it.

In this case, the prosecutor isn't calling an expert. They're just reading from the treatise without any witness testimony. So, I'm wondering if the treatise can be admitted on its own or if it needs to be tied to an expert's testimony.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because it's about the defendant's state of mind. I don't think that's directly relevant here. The treatise is about the lethal nature, not the defendant's intent.

Option B says no because the treatise must be confirmed by an expert. That aligns with what I was thinking. Without an expert, it might not qualify under the exception.

Option C says yes because it's a public document. Public documents are covered under a different hearsay exception, but I think that's for documents like official records, not treatises written by experts.

Option D says no because the treatise must be an exhibit. I don't think the form matters as much as whether it's hearsay and qualifies for an exception.

Option E says yes because prosecutors can introduce evidence without witnesses. That's not correct. Evidence usually needs a proper foundation, which might require a witness, especially for hearsay exceptions.

Option F says no because it's hearsay without an exception. That's possible, but I thought there's an exception for learned treatises when used with an expert.

Option G says yes under the learned treatise exception. But I thought the exception requires that the treatise be used in conjunction with an expert's testimony. Here, no expert is called, so maybe it doesn't apply.

Option H says yes because it supports the claim. That's too vague and doesn't address the hearsay issue.

Option I says no because it wasn't offered during an expert's examination. That makes sense because the treatise needs to be connected to an expert's testimony to use the exception.

Option J says no because relevance. But the substance's lethal nature is definitely relevant to the murder charge, so J is incorrect.

So, putting it together: The treatise is hearsay. The learned treatise exception (FRE 803(18)) allows it if it's used by an expert. Since the prosecutor isn't calling an expert and just reading it, the exception doesn't apply. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible because it's hearsay without an applicable exception.

Looking back at the options, F says it's hearsay without exception. I says it's not offered during expert's testimony. Both seem relevant, but I think the key point is that without an expert, the exception isn't available. So the treatise would be barred as hearsay.

Wait, but does the learned treatise exception require the treatise to be introduced through an expert? Yes, because the expert relies on it or it's called to their attention during testimony. If no expert is testifying, the prosecutor can't just read from the treatise as substantive evidence. So the prosecutor's attempt to read it without a witness would be hearsay, and none of the exceptions would apply because the treatise isn't being used in conjunction with an expert's testimony.

So the correct answer would be either F or I. Option I specifically states that it wasn't offered during the expert's examination, which directly ties into why the exception isn't applicable. Option F is broader, stating it's hearsay without exception.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. FRE 803(18) says that the treatise can be read into evidence if it's called to the expert's attention. But if there's no expert, then the prosecutor can't use it. So in this case, without an expert witness, the treatise is hearsay and not within any exception. So the evidence is inadmissible.

So the answer would be F: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.

Wait, but another thought: There's also the possibility that the treatise could be a public record under FRE 803(8), but I don't think medical treatises qualify as public records. Public records are usually government documents or other official records, not privately published treatises.

So, no, the treatise is hearsay, and without an expert, the exception isn't available. So F is correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence where the prosecutor seeks to read excerpts from a medical treatise to prove the lethal nature of a substance. This raises issues under the hearsay rule and its exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and the treatise qualifies as hearsay because it is a written statement by another party being used for its truth.

The learned treatise exception under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 803(18) allows the admission of a treatise if it is used in conjunction with an expert witness's testimony. Specifically, the treatise must be called to the attention of an expert during cross-examination or relied upon by the expert during direct examination, and it must be established as reliable. In this case, the prosecutor is not calling an expert witness and is instead attempting to read the treatise directly into evidence. Without an expert witness to provide the necessary foundation, the learned treatise exception does not apply.

Other options, such as treating the treatise as a public document or introducing it as an exhibit, are irrelevant because the issue is whether the treatise qualifies under a hearsay exception. Since the treatise is being offered as substantive evidence without the required connection to an expert's testimony, it remains inadmissible hearsay.

Thus, the evidence is inadmissible because the treatise excerpts are hearsay and do not qualify for an exception in the absence of an expert witness.
