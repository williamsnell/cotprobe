Okay, so I've got this problem here. I need to find the smallest positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says: the number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 2 when divided by 3, 3 when divided by 4, and 4 when divided by 5. Hmm. So I'm looking for a number N such that:

N ≡ 1 mod 2
N ≡ 2 mod 3
N ≡ 3 mod 4
N ≡ 4 mod 5

Wait, I notice a pattern here. Each remainder is exactly one less than the divisor. Like, when divided by 2, the remainder is 1 (which is 2-1), divided by 3 leaves 2 (3-1), etc. So that suggests that N + 1 is exactly divisible by all these divisors. Because if N mod d = d-1, then N +1 mod d = 0. So N +1 must be a multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Oh wait, that makes sense. So N +1 is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let me calculate that LCM.

The LCM of 2,3,4,5. Let's see: prime factors.

2 is 2^1
3 is 3^1
4 is 2^2
5 is 5^1

So the LCM takes the highest powers: 2^2, 3^1, 5^1. So 4 *3=12, 12*5=60. So LCM is 60. Therefore, N +1 = 60. So N would be 59.

Wait, but wait—is 59 the smallest such number, or could there be a smaller one? Let me check if 59 satisfies all the conditions.

Check N=59:

59 divided by 2: 29*2=58, so remainder is 1. Good.
59 divided by 3: 3*19=57, remainder 2. Good.
59 divided by 4: 4*14=56, remainder 3. Correct.
59 divided by 5: 5*11=55, remainder 4. Correct.

So yes, 59 works. Now, looking at the options provided: option A is 59. So that's the answer.

But wait, just to make sure. Let me think if there's a smaller number than 59 that also fits. Since 60 is the LCM, the next smallest would be 60 -1 = 59. But wait, what about numbers before that? Because sometimes the moduli aren't all coprime.

Wait, the moduli here are 2, 3, 4, 5. 2 and 4 are not coprime. So maybe the LCM approach is correct, but could there be a smaller number that works?

Wait, let's see. Let's try to find the smallest N such that N+1 is a multiple of 2,3,4,5. So the smallest such N+1 is 60. Hence, N is 59.

So I think 59 is the smallest possible. Let me check the options again. Yes, option A is 59. So I think that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) that satisfies the following conditions:

\[
\begin{align*}
N &\equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
N &\equiv 2 \pmod{3}, \\
N &\equiv 3 \pmod{4}, \\
N &\equiv 4 \pmod{5}.
\end{align*}
\]

Observing the pattern, each remainder is one less than the divisor. This implies that \( N + 1 \) must be divisible by all the divisors: 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, \( N + 1 \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

The prime factorizations are:
- \( 2 = 2^1 \),
- \( 3 = 3^1 \),
- \( 4 = 2^2 \),
- \( 5 = 5^1 \).

The LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 60.
\]

Thus, \( N + 1 = 60 \), so \( N = 60 - 1 = 59 \).

To verify, we check if 59 satisfies all the conditions:
- \( 59 \div 2 = 29 \) with a remainder of 1,
- \( 59 \div 3 = 19 \) with a remainder of 2,
- \( 59 \div 4 = 14 \) with a remainder of 3,
- \( 59 \div 5 = 11 \) with a remainder of 4.

All conditions are satisfied, confirming that 59 is the correct answer. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A: 59**
