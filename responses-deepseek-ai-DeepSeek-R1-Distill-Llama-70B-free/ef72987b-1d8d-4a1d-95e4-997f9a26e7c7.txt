Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question says the decay constant for radium is 1.36 × 10^-11 per second. I need to find how many disintegrations per second occur in 100 grams of radium. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but maybe that's not directly needed here. Oh wait, the formula for the activity (which is the number of disintegrations per second) is A = λN, where N is the number of atoms present.

Right, so I need to find N, the number of radium atoms in 100 grams. How do I do that? Oh yeah, I should calculate the number of moles first and then use Avogadro's number.

What's the atomic mass of radium? I think it's around 226 g/mol. Let me confirm that. Yeah, radium has an atomic weight of about 226. So, moles = mass / molar mass. The mass here is 100 grams.

So moles = 100 g / 226 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 226 is approximately 0.4425 moles. Wait, more accurately, 100/226 ≈ 0.44247 mol.

Now, Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10^23 atoms/mol. So N = moles × Avogadro's number. Let's compute that: 0.44247 mol × 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

0.44247 * 6.022e23. Let me compute 0.44247 multiplied by 6.022. 0.44247 *6 is about 2.6548, and 0.44247 *0.022 is approximately 0.00973. Adding those together gives about 2.6645. So N ≈ 2.6645 × 10^23 atoms.

Wait wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me do 0.44247 × 6.022. Hmm, 0.4 *6.022 is 2.4088, 0.04 *6.022 is 0.2409, 0.00247 *6.022≈0.01487. So adding those: 2.4088 +0.2409=2.6497 +0.01487=2.66457. So yeah, about 2.6646 ×10^23 atoms.

Now, the activity A is λ * N. λ is given as 1.36e-11 per second. So A = 1.36e-11 * 2.6646e23.

Let me compute that. 1.36 multiplied by 2.6646. Let's see: 1 *2.6646 is 2.6646, 0.36 *2.6646. 0.3*2.6646 is 0.79938, 0.06*2.6646≈0.1598. So total 0.79938+0.1598≈0.95918. So 2.6646 +0.95918≈3.6238. So 1.36 * 2.6646e23 = 3.6238e12.

Wait wait, because 1e-11 multiplied by 1e23 is 1e12. So the exponents: 1e-11 * 2.6646e23 = 2.6646e12 *1.36. So 3.6238e12 disintegrations per second.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 3.62 ×10^12 dis/sec. That matches what I got.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Let me recalculate 1.36 * 2.6646.

1.36 * 2.6646: 1 times 2.6646 is 2.6646, 0.36 times 2.6646. Let's compute 0.36 * 2.6646.

0.3 *2.6646 = 0.79938, 0.06 *2.6646 = 0.159876. Sum is 0.959256. So 2.6646 +0.959256= 3.623856.

So 3.623856e12, which is approximately 3.62e12, matching option B.

I think that's it. So the answer should be B.

To determine the number of disintegrations per second in 100 g of radium, we use the formula for activity:

\[
A = \lambda N
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant (\( 1.36 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)),
- \( N \) is the number of radium atoms in 100 g.

First, calculate \( N \), the number of atoms. The atomic mass of radium is approximately \( 226 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles in 100 g of radium is:

\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{100}{226} \approx 0.44247 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \)), the number of atoms is:

\[
N = \text{Moles} \times \text{Avogadro's Number} = 0.44247 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.6646 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms}.
\]

Now, calculate the activity \( A \):

\[
A = \lambda N = (1.36 \times 10^{-11}) \times (2.6646 \times 10^{23}).
\]

Multiply the coefficients and add the exponents:

\[
A = 1.36 \times 2.6646 \times 10^{-11 + 23} = 3.6238 \times 10^{12} \, \text{disintegrations/second}.
\]

This value rounds to \( 3.62 \times 10^{12} \, \text{dis/sec} \), which matches option B.
