Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about distinguishing between prejudice and discrimination. Hmm, I remember these terms are related but have different meanings. Let me think through this.

Prejudice, as far as I recall, is more about the feelings or attitudes someone has towards a group. Like, if someone has a negative opinion about a particular race or gender without knowing the individuals, that's prejudice. It's not necessarily about actions; it's more about the mindset.

Discrimination, on the other hand, is about the actions that result from those prejudiced attitudes. So if someone acts on their prejudice and treats others unfairly because of it, that's discrimination. It's the behavior that follows the prejudiced thinking.

Looking at the options now. Option C says prejudice is an attitude, negative, toward a group, and discrimination is the action resulting from it. That sounds right. Let me check the others to make sure.

Option A talks about policies and economic outcomes. Doesn't seem right because that's more about systemic issues rather than the direct definitions. Option B mentions legal systems and individual choices, which also doesn't fit. Option D reverses the concepts, saying prejudice is behavior and discrimination an attitude, which I think is incorrect because it's the other way around.

Option E says discrimination is any action, positive or negative, and prejudice is the belief. Wait, that's a bit confusing. I thought discrimination was specifically negative actions based on prejudice. But maybe the option is trying to capture that discrimination is action. But I'm not sure if it's the best choice.

Option F talks about learned behavior and natural tendencies. I don't think that's accurate. Both can be learned and unlearned, I believe. Option G says they're the same, which is wrong. Option H talks about making distinctions and age, which is too narrow. Prejudice isn't just about age.

Option I says prejudice is positive, which doesn't make sense because prejudice is usually negative. Option J mentions subconscious bias and conscious choice, but I think prejudice can be both conscious and subconscious, and discrimination is the action, whether conscious or not.

So, going back, Option C seems to correctly state that prejudice is an attitude and discrimination is the action that follows. So I'll go with option C.

The correct answer is option C, as it accurately distinguishes prejudice as a negative attitude toward a group and discrimination as the resulting actions from such prejudice.

Answer: C
