Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about behavior and psychology. Let me think it through step by step. The question is asking about a behavior that's automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that there are different types of responsesâ€”some are learned and others are automatic.

Wait, the key term here is "automatically." So I'm thinking about behaviors that don't require learning. Oh right, reflexes are automatic responses. Like when you pull your hand away from something hot without thinking. That's a reflex action.

Looking at the options, option F is "reflex." That makes sense because reflexes are immediate reactions to stimuli. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with other terms. There's also conditioned response and unconditioned response. Conditioned responses are learned through associations, like Pavlov's dogs salivating when they hear a bell. But conditioned responses aren't automatic in the same way as reflexes; they're learned.

So the question is about an automatic behavior, which points to a reflex. Another option is "conditioned response," which is learned, so that's not it. "Learned response" would be B, but that's too broad and not specific to automatic ones.

Wait, what about unconditioned response? Oh, right, that's part of classical conditioning. An unconditioned response is an unlearned, naturally occurring reaction. Like salivating when food is present. So maybe the correct answer could also be an unconditioned response, but looking at the options, I don't see that listed. The options are A to J, and I don't recall seeing "unconditioned response" as one of them. Let me check the options again.

Options are A: aversive stimulus, B: learned response, C: conditioned response, D: negative reinforcement, E: cognitive response, F: reflex, G: condition, H: unconditioned stimulus, I: reinforcement, J: operant behavior.

Oh wait, option H is "unconditioned stimulus." No, that's the stimulus, not the response. So the response would be the reaction. So H is a stimulus, not the behavior. Therefore, the behavior that's automatic is a reflex, which is option F.

Another angle: operant behavior is learned through reinforcement, so J is out. Aversive stimulus is something unpleasant, so A isn't a behavior. Negative reinforcement (D) is a concept related to increasing behavior by removing something negative.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is F: reflex.

The question asks about a behavior that is automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus. The key term here is "automatically," which points to behaviors that do not require learning. Reflexes are automatic responses to stimuli, such as pulling one's hand away from something hot. This is distinct from conditioned responses, which are learned through associations. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Aversive stimulus** refers to an unpleasant stimulus, not a behavior.
- **B: Learned response** is too broad and not specific to automatic behaviors.
- **C: Conditioned response** is learned, not automatic.
- **D: Negative reinforcement** relates to increasing behavior by removing something negative.
- **E: Cognitive response** involves thinking, not an automatic reaction.
- **F: Reflex** is the correct answer, as it is an automatic, unlearned response.
- **G: Condition** is not relevant to the question.
- **H: Unconditioned stimulus** refers to a stimulus, not a behavior.
- **I: Reinforcement** is a concept related to learning, not automatic behavior.
- **J: Operant behavior** is learned through reinforcement.

Thus, the correct answer is **F: reflex**.

Answer: F
