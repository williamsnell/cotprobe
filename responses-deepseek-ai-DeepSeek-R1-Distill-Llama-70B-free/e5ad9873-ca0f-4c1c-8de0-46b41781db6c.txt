Question:

Let's assume that the 10-year annual return for the S&P 500 (market portfolio) is 10%, while the average annual return on Treasury bills (a good proxy for the risk-free rate) is 5%. Whats the market Treynor Ratio? Return the numeric value between 0 and 1.

Options:

A: 0.08
B: 0.25
C: 0.15
D: 0.5
E: 0.4
F: 0.1
G: 0.2
H: 0.05
I: 0.3
J: 0.6

Okay, so I've got this question here about the Treynor Ratio. Hmm, I remember the Treynor Ratio is some kind of financial metric, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

The question says that the S&P 500 has a 10-year annual return of 10%, and the risk-free rate is 5% as given by Treasury bills. I need to find the market's Treynor Ratio, which should be a number between 0 and 1.

Wait, what's the Treynor Ratio again? Oh right, I think it's a measure of risk-adjusted return. It's calculated by taking the excess return of an investment over the risk-free rate and dividing it by the beta of that investment. The formula, if I remember correctly, is (Return of Portfolio - Risk-Free Rate) divided by Beta.

But wait, the question is about the market's Treynor Ratio. The market as a wholeâ€”so the market portfolio is the S&P 500 in this case. So for the market, what's its beta? Oh, right, the beta of the market is 1 because beta measures volatility relative to the market. So by definition, the market's beta is 1. That makes sense.

So plugging the numbers in. The market's return is 10%, the risk-free rate is 5%. So the excess return is 10% -5% =5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. Then, since beta is 1, the Treynor Ratio is 0.05 / 1 = 0.05.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.05. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. There's also the Sharpe Ratio, which is similar but uses standard deviation instead of beta. The Sharpe Ratio would have been (10%-5%)/standard deviation. But no, the question specifically asks for the Treynor Ratio, which uses beta. And since the market's beta is 1, the calculation is straightforward.

Yeah, I'm confident now. The answer is H.

The Treynor Ratio is calculated as the excess return of a portfolio over the risk-free rate, divided by its beta. For the market portfolio (S&P 500 in this case), the beta is 1 by definition. Given a market return of 10% and a risk-free rate of 5%, the excess return is \(10\% - 5\% = 5\%\). Dividing this by the market's beta (1) gives a Treynor Ratio of 0.05.

Option H corresponds to 0.05, which is the correct answer.

H
