Question:

A defendant is on trial for bribing a government procurement officer by providing the officer with free vacation facilities. When the defendant was approached by an FBI investigator, the defendant stated that her invitation to the procurement officer to spend his vacation in the defendant's mountain cabin was a favor to a friend, unrelated to his government office. The defendant also said to the investigator that she would reveal some "hot" information on a large-scale fraud in exchange for the investigator's promise to "stop worrying about a little vacation." a little vacation." Is the investigator's testimony about the defendant's offer to give information admissible?

Options:

A: No, because the defendant's statement was made under duress.
B: No, because the defendant was not under oath at the time of the statement.
C: No, because the defendant made the offer in a negotiation for settlement of a criminal investigation.
D: Yes, as a statement of a party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment.
E: Yes, because the statement was made voluntarily and without coercion.
F: No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
G: Yes, as a statement of an opposing party.
H: Yes, as a matter observed and reported by the investigator pursuant to a duty imposed by law.
I: Yes, as a statement against penal interest.
J: No, because the investigator violated the defendant's right to counsel.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. 

The scenario is about a defendant on trial for bribing a government procurement officer. The defendant provided the officer with free vacation facilities. When approached by an FBI investigator, the defendant made two statements. First, she said the invitation was just a favor to a friend, unrelated to his government job. Second, she offered to reveal some "hot" information on a large-scale fraud in exchange for the investigator's promise to "stop worrying about a little vacation."

The question is about whether the investigator's testimony regarding the defendant's offer to give information is admissible. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, first, I need to recall the rules of evidence regarding hearsay and exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

So, the defendant's offer to provide information in exchange for dropping the investigation. Let's break down the possible issues.

The defendant made this statement to the investigator. The statement she made is being offered as evidence against her. So, the question is whether this statement is admissible or not.

I think the key here is whether the statement is hearsay and whether any exception applies. Alternatively, perhaps it's an admission by a party-opponent under FRE 801(d)(2).

Wait, under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed. But in this case, the defendant is the party, and she's making the statement herself. So, another part of 801(d)(2) is that a statement is not hearsay if it's the opposing party's statement. So, the defendant's own statement would fall under that.

Wait, FRE 801(d)(2)(A) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship. But the defendant is the party here, and she's making the statement. So 801(d)(2)(A) doesn't apply because she's not an agent or employee of the opposing party.

Wait, no—wait, the defendant is the party, so her own statements are admissions by a party-opponent. So, under 801(d)(2)(A), it's an admission, so it's non-hearsay.

So, the statement the defendant made offering to exchange information for leniency is an admission by a party-opponent, so it's not hearsay. Therefore, it's admissible.

But wait, is there any other reason it might be inadmissible? Maybe under some other rule, like if it was a plea bargaining statement or something like that.

Wait, I remember that under FRE 410, which deals with plea agreements and related statements. It says that evidence of any plea, offer to plead, or any statement made in the course of plea discussions is inadmissible against the defendant. So, if the defendant's offer was part of a plea negotiation, then it would be inadmissible under 410.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant is making a statement to the investigator, offering information in exchange for stopping the investigation of the vacation issue. Is that a plea negotiation? Or is it more of a proffer of information for leniency?

Plea bargaining typically involves negotiations with the prosecutor about the charges, but in this case, she's talking to an investigator. I'm not entirely sure if that falls under the same protections as plea discussions under 410. Alternatively, maybe it's considered a statement made in the course of plea negotiations, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is not hearsay because it's an admission. So, if the statement is non-hearsay under 801(d)(2), then it's admissible unless another rule excludes it.

But wait, option C says, "No, because the defendant made the offer in a negotiation for settlement of a criminal investigation." So, if this was part of settlement negotiations, perhaps under FRE 408, which deals with compromises and offers to compromise. But FRE 408 says that evidence of a compromise or offer to compromise a disputed claim is inadmissible to prove liability. However, this is a criminal case, so I think 408 doesn't apply because it's mainly for civil cases. Also, 408 does have exceptions for criminal cases, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, let me think again. The defendant offered to provide information in exchange for the investigator stopping the investigation. That sounds a bit like a plea bargain, where she's offering cooperation in exchange for leniency. So, under 410, statements made in the course of plea discussions are inadmissible against the defendant. But here, the defendant is making the statement to an investigator, not necessarily in a formal plea negotiation with the prosecutor.

I might be mixing up the rules here. But I think that in some cases, statements made to law enforcement officers in the course of an investigation might not fall under the plea negotiation protections unless the defendant is represented by counsel and in a structured plea negotiation setting.

Alternatively, if the defendant is offering to cooperate in exchange for leniency, that might be considered a statement made in the course of seeking a plea agreement, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, another angle: the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, which is that she bribed the officer. So, her statement offering to provide information in exchange for leniency includes an implicit admission that she did something wrong. So, the statement might be an admission by a party-opponent.

But if the statement is part of a plea negotiation, then under 410, it's inadmissible. So, which applies here?

Let me check the options. Option C says it's inadmissible because it was made in a negotiation for settlement of a criminal investigation. If that's the case, then under 410, the statement would be inadmissible. But wait, 410 also allows for some exceptions, like if the statement is used for perjury or if it's a statement of any party's counsel.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's approach this differently.

The defendant's statement is an offer to provide information in exchange for the investigator dropping the matter. That's a quid pro quo. Now, in a criminal case, when a defendant offers to cooperate in exchange for leniency, is that statement admissible?

I recall that under the Federal Rules, statements made in the course of plea bargaining are inadmissible against the defendant. So, if this was a plea negotiation, it's protected. But if it's just a statement made to an investigator without any formal plea agreement being discussed, maybe it's not protected.

Alternatively, the statement could be considered an admission under 801(d)(2)(A), making it non-hearsay and admissible, unless another rule like 410 excludes it.

So the key here is whether this statement was made during plea negotiations. If yes, then 410 would make it inadmissible. If no, then it's admissible as a party admission.

In this scenario, the defendant is talking directly to the investigator, not in a plea bargain setting with a prosecutor. So maybe it's not covered by 410. So the statement would be admissible as a party admission.

Wait, but another thought: some cases hold that any statement made by the defendant to law enforcement can be used as an admission, regardless of the context, unless it's part of a plea negotiation.

So, if the defendant is offering information in exchange for leniency, that's a statement that could be seen as an admission, and thus admissible.

Looking at the options, option G says "Yes, as a statement of an opposing party." So that would align with 801(d)(2)(A), making it non-hearsay and admissible.

Option C says it's inadmissible because it's part of a negotiation for settlement. But I'm not sure if this situation qualifies as such under 410, especially since it's the defendant approaching the investigator, not part of formal plea discussions.

So, perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm a bit torn because if it's part of a negotiation, 410 might apply. But given the scenario, it's more likely that it's admissible as an admission.

Wait, but I'm mixing up the options. Let me look again.

Option C: No, because the defendant made the offer in a negotiation for settlement of a criminal investigation.

Option G: Yes, as a statement of an opposing party.

So, if the statement is part of settlement negotiations, then 410 applies, making it inadmissible. But if it's not, then it's admissible as an admission.

In this case, the defendant is offering information in exchange for the investigator stopping the investigation. That sounds like a form of settlement or plea negotiation, but it's a bit unclear.

If the court considers this a plea negotiation, then under 410, it's inadmissible, so the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if the court treats it as a regular statement, then it's an admission and admissible, so G would be correct.

I think the key is whether the defendant's offer to exchange information for leniency is part of a plea negotiation. Since she's approaching the investigator, perhaps it's not a formal plea negotiation, so 410 doesn't apply. Therefore, the statement is admissible as an admission.

So, the answer would be G: Yes, as a statement of an opposing party.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is to consider whether the statement is hearsay. The defendant's offer to exchange information is being offered for the truth—that she engaged in bribery. So, it's hearsay. Unless it's an admission under 801(d)(2)(A), which it would be because it's a statement by the party-opponent. So, it's not hearsay and thus admissible.

So, the answer would be G.

Alternatively, if the statement is part of a settlement negotiation, but I think that's less likely here.

So, among the options, G seems correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the defendant's statement offering to provide information in exchange for leniency. The key issue is whether this statement is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically addressing hearsay and its exceptions, as well as potential exclusions under rules like FRE 410.

The defendant's statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted—that she engaged in bribery. Under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it is an admission by a party-opponent. Here, the defendant's offer to exchange information for leniency can be interpreted as an implicit admission of wrongdoing, making it admissible as a non-hearsay statement under this rule.

However, the analysis must also consider whether the statement falls under FRE 410, which protects statements made during plea negotiations from being admitted against the defendant. In this case, the defendant made the statement directly to an FBI investigator, not in a formal plea negotiation setting with a prosecutor. Therefore, it is less likely that FRE 410 applies, as the context does not clearly indicate a structured plea bargaining scenario.

Given this, the statement is admissible as a statement of an opposing party under FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

G: Yes, as a statement of an opposing party.

Answer: G
