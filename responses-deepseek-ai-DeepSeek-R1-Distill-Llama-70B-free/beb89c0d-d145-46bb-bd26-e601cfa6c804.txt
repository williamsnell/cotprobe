Okay, so I've got this question about bodhisattvas and their roles, especially regarding souls of dead children. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Buddhist deities, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which bodhisattva is known for conducting the souls of dead children to salvation. The options are A through J, each representing different bodhisattvas or Buddhist figures.

Let me start by recalling what I know about each option. 

Option A is Kannon. I remember that Kannon is the Japanese form of Avalokiteshvara, who is a bodhisattva of compassion. Kannon is often depicted with multiple arms and is known for helping beings attain enlightenment. But I'm not sure if this specifically includes souls of children.

Option B is Shakyamuni, who I believe is the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama. He's the founder, not a bodhisattva in the same sense as the others, so probably not the answer.

Option C is Manjusri, known as the bodhisattva of wisdom. He's often depicted with a sword of wisdom, cutting through ignorance. Doesn't seem related to guiding souls of children.

Option D is Guan-yin. Wait, Guan-yin is the Chinese version of Avalokiteshvara, right? So similar to Kannon. Guan-yin is also a bodhisattva of compassion, often depicted as female in Chinese art. I think Guan-yin is associated with mercy and saving beings from suffering, but again, not sure about children specifically.

Option E is Tara. She's a female bodhisattva in Tibetan Buddhism, known for compassion and protection. There are different forms of Tara, like Green Tara and White Tara. She's often invoked for protection and guidance, but I'm not certain about her role with children's souls.

Option F is Avalokiteshvara. That's the Sanskrit name for the bodhisattva of compassion, which is the same as Kannon and Guan-yin. So this is the same figure as A and D. So if any of those are correct, F could be the answer, but I need to see the specifics.

Option G is Vajrapani, who I think is associated with power and is often depicted as a strong figure, sometimes with a vajra (thunderbolt). He's more about breaking through obstacles, so probably not related to guiding souls.

Option H is Ojizo-sama. I'm not as familiar with this name. Wait, Ojizo-sama sounds Japanese. I think Ojizo is another name for a bodhisattva, but I'm not exactly sure which one. Maybe it's a specific manifestation or a local deity. I recall that in Japanese Buddhism, there's a figure called Jizo Bosatsu, which is the Japanese form of Kshitigarbha. Jizo is known for helping beings in hell and is often associated with protecting children and aborted fetuses. Oh, wait, that sounds relevant! Because Jizo is sometimes said to guide the souls of children to the afterlife or help them attain salvation. So Ojizo-sama might be another name for Jizo.

Option I is Amitabha, who is a Buddha, not a bodhisattva. Amitabha is associated with the Pure Land school and is the Buddha of infinite light and life. He's the one people call upon to be reborn in the Pure Land, but I don't think he's specifically about guiding children's souls.

Option J is Maitreya, the future Buddha who is yet to come. He's more about the future and bringing enlightenment to all beings, but not specifically about souls of dead children.

So, putting it together. The question is about a bodhisattva who conducts souls of dead children to salvation. From what I remember, Jizo Bosatsu (Ojizo-sama) is the one associated with children's souls. He's often depicted as a monk and is a protector of children, especially in Japanese Buddhism. People leave offerings like red bibs and toys at Jizo statues to help their deceased children's spirits.

But wait, let me double-check. Kannon and Guan-yin are forms of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, but their main role is general compassion, not specifically children. However, I'm not entirely sure if any of them have a specific role with children. On the other hand, Jizo (Ojizo) is definitely linked with children and their salvation.

Looking at the options, H is Ojizo-sama, which would be Jizo. So the correct answer should be H.

The question asks which bodhisattva is known for conducting the souls of dead children to salvation. To determine the correct answer, it's important to analyze the roles of the bodhisattvas listed in the options:

- **A: Kannon** and **D: Guan-yin** are both forms of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, but their roles are more general and not specifically focused on children's souls.  
- **B: Shakyamuni** is the historical Buddha, not a bodhisattva, and thus not relevant here.  
- **C: Manjusri** is associated with wisdom, not salvation of children.  
- **E: Tara** is a female bodhisattva of compassion and protection but not specifically linked to guiding children's souls.  
- **F: Avalokiteshvara** is the Sanskrit name for Kannon and Guan-yin, so it shares the same general role of compassion without a specific focus on children.  
- **G: Vajrapani** is associated with power and breaking obstacles, unrelated to this context.  
- **H: Ojizo-sama** refers to Jizo Bosatsu, the Japanese form of Kshitigarbha, who is specifically known for protecting children and guiding their souls to salvation.  
- **I: Amitabha** is a Buddha associated with the Pure Land school, not a bodhisattva, and not specifically linked to children's souls.  
- **J: Maitreya** is the future Buddha, focused on enlightenment in the future, not on guiding souls of children.  

Based on this analysis, **Ojizo-sama (H)**, also known as Jizo Bosatsu, is the bodhisattva specifically associated with protecting children and guiding their souls to salvation. 

Answer: H
