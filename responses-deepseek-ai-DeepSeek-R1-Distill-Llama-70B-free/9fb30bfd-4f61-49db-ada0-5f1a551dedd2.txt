Question:

A man was charged with tax fraud. He wished to offer evidence, on his behalf, of his honesty while running for mayor. During his political campaign, he refused to lie about a psychiatric problem in his past, and his honesty cost him the election. The man was quoted as saying, "If I lied, I'd be mayor today, but that's no way to win an election. "The BEST argument of the objector to such evidence in the tax fraud case would be which of the following?

Options:

A: The defendant's honesty during his political campaign has no bearing on his honesty in financial matters.
B: The evidence is biased as it is coming from the defendant himself.
C: The man's honesty in one situation doesn't necessarily apply to all situations.
D: Character evidence is not admissible in such cases.
E: One incident doesn't prove character.
F: The evidence could sway the jury's opinion unfairly.
G: This is an impermissible way to prove character.
H: The tax fraud case and the political campaign are two separate incidents.
I: The incident is too far in the past to be relevant.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with character evidence in a tax fraud case. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is about a man charged with tax fraud who wants to present evidence of his honesty during a mayoral campaign. He was open about a psychiatric issue which cost him the election, and he made a statement about not lying to win. The issue is about the best argument the objector would make against admitting this evidence.

First, I remember that in criminal cases, character evidence is generally not admissible unless it's for specific exceptions, like when the defendant's character is a key element of the charge, such as in a case involving honesty. But wait, I think for the defense, they can offer evidence of their good character, but it's subject to certain rules. Oh wait, but wait, isn't there a rule about specific instances of conduct not being admissible to prove character? Like, under FRE 405, when character evidence is allowed, it's usually through reputation or opinion testimony, not specific acts. Because specific acts are considered too prejudicial or misleading.

So in this case, the defendant wants to use a specific instance (his honesty in the campaign) to show he's honest in general, which would be relevant to the tax fraud charge. But the objector would argue that this is improper because specific acts aren't allowed for proving character. So the best argument would be that this is an impermissible way to prove character.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one.

Option A says the honesty in the campaign doesn't relate to financial honesty. That's a possible argument, but maybe not the best. Relevance could be a factor, but I think the more precise objection is about the method of proving character.

Option B claims the evidence is biased because it's from the defendant. That's about self-serving testimony, but the issue isn't just bias; it's about the form of evidence.

Option C states that honesty in one situation doesn't apply to all. That's a general truth, but again, the objection would be more about the method of proving character, not the applicability.

Option D says character evidence isn't admissible. Wait, no, because in some cases, like when the defendant offers it, it's admissible. So D might not be correct because it's too broad.

Option E argues one incident doesn't prove character. That's true, but the objection would be more about the method, not the sufficiency.

Option F suggests the evidence could sway the jury unfairly. That's a possible concern, but again, the specific legal objection is about the improper method of proving character.

Option G says it's an impermissible way to prove character. That aligns with what I was thinking earlierâ€”specific acts aren't allowed under FRE 405.

Option H mentions the two incidents being separate. That's more about relevance, similar to A, but not the main issue.

Option I talks about the incident being too old. The question doesn't mention the timing, so I don't think this is the point.

So putting it all together, the best argument is that using specific instances to prove character isn't allowed. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.

The best argument of the objector is that the evidence is an impermissible way to prove character. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically FRE 405, when character evidence is admissible, it must be presented through reputation or opinion testimony, not through specific instances of conduct. The defendant's attempt to use a specific act of honesty during his political campaign to prove his general honesty is impermissible because it violates this rule. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: This is an impermissible way to prove character.

Answer: G
