Okay, so I have this problem here about nitrogen gas collected over water, and I need to find the volume of dry nitrogen at STP. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but let's try to think this through.

First, the problem says that 40 liters of N2 are collected at 22°C over water under a pressure of 0.957 atm. I remember that when a gas is collected over water, the total pressure is the sum of the gas's pressure and the water vapor pressure. So I think I need to account for the water vapor in the mixture.

Wait, right, Dalton's Law says P_total = P_gas + P_water_vapor. So the pressure of just the nitrogen would be the total pressure minus the water vapor pressure at that temperature.

I think at 22°C, the water vapor pressure is around 23.8 mmHg, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, maybe it's 19.8 mmHg? Or was that at a different temperature? Hmm, this is a point where I might get stuck. I should probably look this up or recall from memory. I think at 20°C it's about 17.5 mmHg. So 22°C would be a bit higher. Let me guess 21.0 mmHg? Or maybe 23.8 mmHg is correct for 25°C. Maybe 22°C is around 19.8 mmHg. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the vapor pressure of water at 22°C is approximately 19.8 mmHg. Yeah, I think that's right. So if the total pressure is 0.957 atm, I need to convert that to mmHg to subtract the vapor pressure.

Wait, 1 atm is 760 mmHg. So 0.957 atm is 0.957 * 760 mmHg. Let me calculate that. 0.957 * 760, let's see, 0.9*760 is 684, 0.05*760=38, 0.007*760=5.32. So 684 +38=722, +5.32=727.32 mmHg. So the total pressure is 727.32 mmHg. The water vapor is 19.8 mmHg. So the pressure of just N2 is 727.32 - 19.8 = 707.52 mmHg.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct vapor pressure. If I'm wrong here, my whole calculation will be off. Let's just proceed with this for now.

Now, I have the volume of the wet nitrogen as 40 liters at 22°C (which is 295.15 K) and a pressure of 0.957 atm. But the actual pressure of the N2 is 707.52 mmHg. Wait, but when using the ideal gas law, we usually work in atmospheres, so maybe I should convert that pressure back to atm.

707.52 mmHg divided by 760 mmHg/atm equals approximately 0.9305 atm. So P = 0.9305 atm.

Now, I need to find the volume of the dry N2 at STP. STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm pressure.

So I think I can use the combined gas law: P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2.

But wait, the initial conditions are for the wet N2, but we corrected the pressure for the water vapor, so the n (moles) of N2 remains the same when moving to STP, assuming it's dry.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the moles of N2 first, and then find the volume at STP.

So using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

n = (P V) / (R T).

But wait, the P here is the partial pressure of N2, which is 0.9305 atm. V is 40 L, T is 295.15 K.

Once I find n, I can then find V at STP.

So, let me compute n first.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So n = (0.9305 atm * 40 L) / (0.0821 * 295.15).

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.0821 * 295.15 ≈ 0.0821 * 295 ≈ 24.2295.

So n ≈ (0.9305 * 40) / 24.2295.

0.9305 *40 = 37.22.

So 37.22 /24.2295 ≈ 1.536 moles.

Now, at STP, P=1 atm, T=273.15 K.

We can find V using PV = nRT.

V = (n R T)/ P.

n is 1.536, R=0.0821, T=273.15, P=1.

Compute numerator: 1.536 * 0.0821 *273.15.

Let me compute 0.0821 *273.15 first.

0.0821 *273 ≈ 22.41.

So 1.536 *22.41 ≈ ?

1.5 *22.41 =33.615, 0.036 *22.41≈0.806, total ≈34.421.

So V≈34.421 liters.

Looking at the options, option B is 34.4 liters, which is very close. So I think the answer is B.

Wait a second, but did I use the correct water vapor pressure? Because if the vapor pressure was actually higher, that would lower the partial pressure of N2, leading to fewer moles and thus a smaller volume.

Let me double-check the vapor pressure at 22°C. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recall: at 20°C, it's 17.5 mmHg, at 25°C, 23.8 mmHg. So 22°C should be around 19.8 to 20 mmHg perhaps.

Wait, another approach: using a table. The vapor pressure of water at 22°C is approximately 19.83 mmHg. So my initial calculation was correct.

So the pressure of N2 is 0.957 atm total pressure minus the vapor pressure.

Wait, no, the total pressure is 0.957 atm, which includes both the N2 and the water vapor. So when I converted 0.957 atm to mmHg, I had 727.32 mmHg, subtract the vapor pressure of 19.83 mmHg, giving 707.49 mmHg, which is 707.49 /760 = 0.9309 atm.

So earlier I used 0.9305, which is close enough.

So n ≈ (0.9309 *40)/(0.0821 *295.15) ≈ (37.236)/(24.25)≈1.535 moles.

Then at STP, V=1.535 *0.0821 *273.15 /1.

Calculating 0.0821 *273.15 = approx 22.411.

1.535 *22.411 = Let's compute 1.5 *22.411 is 33.6165, 0.035 *22.411≈0.783, total≈34.4, which is option B.

So I think the correct answer is B: 34.4 liters.

To determine the volume of dry nitrogen gas at STP, we start by analyzing the given conditions: 40 liters of wet nitrogen gas collected at 22°C over water under a total pressure of 0.957 atm. The water vapor contributes to the total pressure, so we must account for it using Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{N}_2} + P_{\text{water vapor}}
\]

At 22°C, the water vapor pressure is approximately **19.83 mmHg**. Converting the total pressure to mmHg:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = 0.957 \, \text{atm} \times 760 \, \text{mmHg/atm} = 727.32 \, \text{mmHg}
\]

The partial pressure of nitrogen is:

\[
P_{\text{N}_2} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{water vapor}} = 727.32 \, \text{mmHg} - 19.83 \, \text{mmHg} = 707.49 \, \text{mmHg}
\]

Converting this back to atm:

\[
P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{707.49 \, \text{mmHg}}{760 \, \text{mmHg/atm}} \approx 0.9309 \, \text{atm}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of moles of nitrogen using the ideal gas law:

\[
n = \frac{P_{\text{N}_2} V}{RT}
\]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{N}_2} = 0.9309 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( V = 40 \, \text{L} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K} \),
- \( T = 22°C = 295.15 \, \text{K} \).

\[
n = \frac{(0.9309)(40)}{(0.0821)(295.15)} \approx \frac{37.236}{24.2295} \approx 1.535 \, \text{mol}
\]

At STP (\( P = 1 \, \text{atm}, T = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)), the volume of dry nitrogen can be calculated using:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

Substituting:
- \( n = 1.535 \, \text{mol} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K} \),
- \( T = 273.15 \, \text{K} \),
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \).

\[
V = \frac{(1.535)(0.0821)(273.15)}{1} \approx 1.535 \times 22.411 \approx 34.4 \, \text{L}
\]

Thus, the volume of dry nitrogen gas at STP is approximately **34.4 liters**.
