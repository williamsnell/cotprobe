Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve. The equation is t y' minus 2 y equals t^5 sin(2t) minus t^3 plus 4 t^4. And the initial condition is y(pi) = 3 pi^4 over 2. I need to find y(t) when t is pi/2. Hmm, alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that this is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The standard form for such equations is y' plus some function of t times y equals another function of t. So I should probably rewrite the given equation into that form.

The equation given is t y' - 2 y = t^5 sin(2t) - t^3 + 4 t^4. Let me divide every term by t to get it into the standard form. So that would make it y' - (2/t) y = t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 + 4 t^3. Right, because I divided each term by t:

- t y' / t is y'
- -2y/t becomes - (2/t) y
- The right side becomes t^5/t sin(2t) which is t^4 sin(2t)
- Similarly, -t^3/t is -t^2 and 4t^4/t is 4t^3.

So now the equation is y' + P(t) y = Q(t), where P(t) is -2/t and Q(t) is t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 + 4 t^3.

I think the next step is to find an integrating factor. The integrating factor mu(t) is usually e raised to the integral of P(t) dt. So in this case, P(t) is -2/t, so the integral of that would be -2 ln|t|, which means the integrating factor is e^(-2 ln t) or something. Wait, let me compute that correctly.

The integrating factor mu(t) is exp( integral of P(t) dt ). So P(t) is -2/t. The integral of -2/t dt is -2 ln|t| + C. Since the constant of integration doesn't matter for the integrating factor, we can write it as e^(-2 ln t) which simplifies to t^(-2), because e^{ln(a)} is a, and e^{ln(t^k)} is t^k. So e^{-2 ln t} = e^{ln(t^{-2})} = t^{-2}.

So the integrating factor is 1/t². Now, I should multiply both sides of the standard form equation by this integrating factor to make the left side a perfect derivative.

Multiplying through by 1/t²:

(1/t²) y' - (2/t³) y = (t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 + 4 t^3) / t².

Simplify the right-hand side:

t^4 / t² is t², so term by term:

t^4 sin(2t)/t² = t² sin(2t)
-t^2/t² = -1
4t^3/t² = 4t.

So the right side becomes t² sin(2t) - 1 + 4 t.

Now, the left side should be the derivative of (mu(t) y), which is d/dt ( (1/t²) y ). So:

d/dt [ (1/t²) y ] = t² sin(2t) - 1 + 4 t.

Now, I need to integrate both sides with respect to t to find (1/t²) y.

So, integrating the left side is straightforward; it's just (1/t²) y. The right side integral is the integral of [t² sin(2t) -1 +4t] dt.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, integral of t² sin(2t) dt. Hmm, integration by parts. Let me let u = t², dv = sin(2t) dt. Then du = 2t dt, v = - (1/2) cos(2t). So integration by parts gives:

u v - integral v du = - (t²)(1/2) cos(2t) + (1/2) integral of 2t cos(2t) dt.

Simplify that: - (t²/2) cos(2t) + integral of t cos(2t) dt.

Now, the integral of t cos(2t) dt. Again, integration by parts. Let u = t, dv = cos(2t) dt. Then du = dt, v = (1/2) sin(2t).

So integral becomes t*(1/2) sin(2t) - integral (1/2) sin(2t) dt.

That's (t/2) sin(2t) - (1/2) * (-1/(2)) cos(2t) + C.

Putting it all together:

Integral of t² sin(2t) dt = - (t²/2) cos(2t) + [ (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, wait, let me check:

Wait, the first integration by parts gives:

- (t²/2) cos(2t) + (1/2) * the integral of 2t cos(2t) dt.

Wait, the second integral is ∫2t cos(2t) dt. Let me adjust. So when I set u = 2t, then du = 2 dt, and dv = cos(2t) dt, v= (1/2) sin(2t).

Wait, perhaps I should re-do the second integration by parts correctly.

Wait, no, in the first step, after the first integration by parts, the remaining integral is ∫ t cos(2t) dt. So I set u = t, dv = cos(2t) dt. Then du = dt, v= (1/2) sin(2t).

So ∫ t cos(2t) dt = (t)(1/2) sin(2t) - ∫ (1/2) sin(2t) dt.

That becomes (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/(4)) cos(2t) + C.

Wait, because the integral of sin(2t) is - (1/2) cos(2t), so:

= (t/2) sin(2t) - (1/2) * [ (-1/2) cos(2t) ) ] + C.

Which is (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + C.

So going back to the first integration by parts:

Integral of t² sin(2t) dt = - (t²/2) cos(2t) + (1/2) [ (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ) ] + C.

Simplify that:

= - (t²/2) cos(2t) + (t/4) sin(2t) + (1/8) cos(2t) + C.

Wait, let me compute the coefficients correctly.

Wait, the first term is - (t²/2) cos(2t).

Then, from the first integration by parts, we have (1/2) times the integral, which is (1/2) [ (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ) ].

So that's (t/4) sin(2t) + (1/8) cos(2t).

So the entire integral for t² sin(2t) is:

- (t²/2) cos(2t) + (t/4) sin(2t) + (1/8) cos(2t) + C.

Now, the other terms in the integrand are -1 and 4t. Their integrals are straightforward:

Integral of -1 dt is -t.

Integral of 4t dt is 2 t².

Putting it all together, the integral of the entire right-hand side is:

[ - (t²/2) cos(2t) + (t/4) sin(2t) + (1/8) cos(2t) ] - t + 2 t² + C.

So, (1/t²) y = [ all that ] + C.

Wait, no, because the integral of the right side is all that, so (1/t²) y equals that integral plus a constant. So:

(1/t²) y = [ - (t²/2) cos(2t) + (t/4) sin(2t) + (1/8) cos(2t) ] - t + 2 t² + C.

Now, to solve for y, multiply both sides by t²:

y = t² [ - (t²/2) cos(2t) + (t/4) sin(2t) + (1/8) cos(2t) - t + 2 t² ] + C t².

Let me expand this:

y = t² [ - (t²/2) cos(2t) ] + t² [ (t/4) sin(2t) ] + t² [ (1/8) cos(2t) ] + t² [ -t ] + t² [ 2 t² ] + C t².

Simplify each term:

First term: - (t^4 / 2) cos(2t)

Second term: (t^3 /4) sin(2t)

Third term: (t^2 /8) cos(2t)

Fourth term: - t^3

Fifth term: 2 t^4

And the constant term: C t².

So combining all terms:

y = - (t^4/2) cos(2t) + (t^3/4) sin(2t) + (t²/8) cos(2t) - t^3 + 2 t^4 + C t².

Hmm, maybe we can combine like terms. Let's see:

Looking for terms with t^4 cos(2t): only the first term, which is - (t^4/2) cos(2t).

Then, t^3 sin(2t): (t^3/4) sin(2t).

Then, t^2 cos(2t): (t^2/8) cos(2t).

Now, the polynomial terms: - t^3 and 2 t^4, and C t^2.

So perhaps we can write y as:

y = 2 t^4 - t^3 + C t^2 + [ - (t^4/2) cos(2t) + (t^3/4) sin(2t) + (t^2/8) cos(2t) ].

But wait, the terms involving cos(2t) and sin(2t) are part of the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution. Hmm, maybe that's not the best way to think about it. Anyway, moving on.

Now, the next step is to apply the initial condition. Wait, the initial condition is at t = pi, y(pi) = 3 pi^4 / 2.

So, we can plug t = pi into the expression for y and set it equal to 3 pi^4 / 2, then solve for C.

So let's compute each term at t=pi:

First term: 2 pi^4.

Second term: - pi^3.

Third term: C pi^2.

Fourth term: - (pi^4/2) cos(2 pi) + (pi^3/4) sin(2 pi) + (pi^2/8) cos(2 pi).

Compute each part:

cos(2 pi) is 1, sin(2 pi) is 0.

So the fourth term becomes:

- (pi^4/2)(1) + (pi^3/4)(0) + (pi^2/8)(1) = - pi^4 / 2 + 0 + pi^2/8.

Putting it all together, the expression for y at t=pi is:

y(pi) = 2 pi^4 - pi^3 + C pi^2 - pi^4/2 + pi^2/8.

Simplify:

Combine the 2 pi^4 and - pi^4/2: 2 pi^4 is (4/2) pi^4, so 4/2 -1/2 = 3/2 pi^4.

So 3/2 pi^4 - pi^3 + C pi^2 + pi^2/8.

Wait, because the other terms are - pi^3 and + pi^2/8.

So:

y(pi) = (3/2) pi^4 - pi^3 + (C + 1/8) pi^2.

But according to the initial condition, y(pi) = (3 pi^4)/2.

So:

(3/2) pi^4 - pi^3 + (C + 1/8) pi^2 = (3/2) pi^4.

Subtract (3/2) pi^4 from both sides:

- pi^3 + (C + 1/8) pi^2 = 0.

Factor out pi^2:

pi^2 ( - pi + (C + 1/8) ) = 0.

Since pi^2 isn't zero, the term in the brackets must be zero:

- pi + C + 1/8 = 0.

Solve for C:

C = pi - 1/8.

So, the general solution is:

y = 2 t^4 - t^3 + (pi - 1/8) t^2 + [ - (t^4/2) cos(2t) + (t^3/4) sin(2t) + (t^2/8) cos(2t) ].

Wait, perhaps I should write this as:

y = 2 t^4 - t^3 + (pi - 1/8) t^2 - (t^4/2) cos(2t) + (t^3/4) sin(2t) + (t^2/8) cos(2t).

Alternatively, group like terms:

The t^4 terms: 2 t^4 - (t^4/2) cos(2t).

The t^3 terms: -t^3 + (t^3/4) sin(2t).

The t^2 terms: (pi - 1/8) t^2 + (t^2/8) cos(2t).

But perhaps it's better to leave it as is for substitution into t=pi/2.

Now, the question is to find y(pi/2). So plug t=pi/2 into the expression.

Compute each term step by step.

First, compute each part:

Compute 2 t^4: 2*(pi/2)^4. Let's compute (pi/2)^4:

(pi/2)^4 = (pi^4)/(2^4) = pi^4 / 16.

So 2 * (pi^4/16) = pi^4 / 8.

Second term: -t^3 = - (pi/2)^3. (pi/2)^3 = pi^3 / 8. So this term is - pi^3 / 8.

Third term: (pi - 1/8) t^2. t^2 is (pi/2)^2 = pi² /4. So (pi - 1/8) * (pi²/4) = (pi * pi²)/4 - (1/8 * pi²)/4 = (pi^3)/4 - (pi²)/(32).

Fourth term: -(t^4/2) cos(2t). t=pi/2, so 2t=pi. cos(pi)= -1.

So -( ( (pi/2)^4 ) / 2 ) * (-1) = - (pi^4/(16*2)) * (-1) = - (pi^4/32) * (-1) = pi^4 /32.

Fifth term: (t^3/4) sin(2t). t=pi/2, 2t=pi, sin(pi)=0. So this term is zero.

Sixth term: (t^2/8) cos(2t). Again, cos(pi) = -1. So ( (pi/2)^2 /8 ) * (-1) = ( (pi²/4) /8 ) * (-1) = (pi²/(32)) * (-1) = - pi²/32.

So putting all together:

y(pi/2) = [pi^4/8] + [ - pi^3/8 ] + [ (pi^3)/4 - (pi²)/(32) ] + [ pi^4/32 ] + [0] + [ - pi²/32 ].

Hmm, let's compute each part step by step.

Compute term by term:

Term 1: pi^4 /8.

Term 2: - pi^3 /8.

Term 3: (pi^3)/4 - pi^2/32.

Term 4: pi^4 /32.

Term 5: 0.

Term 6: - pi^2/32.

So let's sum all the terms.

First, collect the pi^4 terms:

Term 1: pi^4/8 = (4 pi^4)/32.

Term 4: pi^4/32.

Adding them: (4 +1)/32 pi^4 = 5 pi^4 /32.

Next, the pi^3 terms:

Term 2: - pi^3/8.

Term 3: pi^3/4 = 2 pi^3/8.

So adding: (-1 +2)/8 pi^3 = (1/8) pi^3.

Pi^2 terms:

Term 3: - pi^2/32.

Term 6: - pi^2/32.

Adding: (-1 -1)/32 pi^2 = -2 pi^2 /32 = - pi^2 /16.

So now, putting it all together:

y(pi/2) = (5 pi^4)/32 + (pi^3)/8 - (pi^2)/16.

Hmm, wait, that's the expression. Now, I need to compute this numerically to get a value, then match it to the options given.

Let me compute each term using the approximate value of pi as 3.1415926536.

Compute each term:

First term: (5 pi^4)/32.
