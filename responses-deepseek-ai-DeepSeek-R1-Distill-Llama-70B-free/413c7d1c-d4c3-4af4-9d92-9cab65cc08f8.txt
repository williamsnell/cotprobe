Okay, so I have this physics problem here about wave velocities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states: A 1-Mc/sec plane wave is traveling in a normally dispersive, lossless medium. The phase velocity at this frequency is 3e8 meters per second. The phase velocity as a function of wavelength is given by v equals k times the square root of lambda, where k is a constant. I need to find the group velocity.

Wait, let me make sure I understand all the terms here. Phase velocity is the speed at which a particular phase of the wave (like the peak) travels. Group velocity is the speed at which the energy or the envelope of the wave propagates, which is usually what we mean by the speed of the wave.

The medium is normally dispersive, so the phase velocity increases with frequency. Oh right, in normal dispersion, higher frequencies have higher phase velocities. But for group velocity, I think v_group is usually less than v_phase in such cases, but wait, that might depend on the specific dispersion relation.

The frequency given is 1 Mc/sec, which I think is megacycles per second, so 1 MHz. That's 1e6 Hz. The wavelength is 300 meters because the speed of light in vacuum is about 3e8 m/s, so v = fλ. Wait, wait, wait, the phase velocity here is 3e8 m/s at this frequency. So v_phase = f * lambda. So 3e8 = 1e6 * lambda. Solving for lambda gives 3e8 / 1e6 = 300 meters. That matches the given wavelength, so that's consistent.

The phase velocity is given by v = k * sqrt(lambda), where k is a constant. So phase velocity v_p = k * sqrt(lambda). But I remember that phase velocity v_p is also equal to c / n, where n is the refractive index. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. Alternatively, another relation comes to mind: phase velocity is related to frequency and the wave number: v_p = ω / k, where ω is angular frequency and k is the wave number (2π/lambda).

Wait, but in the problem, the phase velocity as a function of wavelength is given as v_p = k * sqrt(lambda). Hmm, so substituting in terms of frequency. Let me think.

So given that v_p = k * sqrt(lambda), and we know that for a wave, v_p = f * lambda. Wait, no. Wait, no. No, because normally, phase velocity is f multiplied by the wavelength. So v_p = f * lambda. But here, the problem says v_p = k * sqrt(lambda). So setting these equal: f * lambda = k * sqrt(lambda). So f * lambda = k * lambda^(1/2), which implies f = k / lambda^(1/2). So f = k / sqrt(lambda). So that's a relation between frequency and wavelength.

But wait, in any medium, the phase velocity is also given by v_p = ω / k, where ω is 2πf and k is the wave number (2π/lambda). So v_p = (2πf) / (2π/lambda)) ) = f * lambda. So that's consistent with the earlier relation.

But now the phase velocity is expressed as v_p = k * sqrt(lambda). So substituting, f * lambda = k * sqrt(lambda). So f = (k * sqrt(lambda)) ) / lambda = k / sqrt(lambda). Hmm, so f is proportional to 1/sqrt(lambda). So, as lambda decreases (wavelength decreases, frequency increases), which is normal dispersion because higher frequencies have higher phase velocities. Because if lambda is smaller, then sqrt(lambda) is smaller, so v_p = k sqrt(lambda) would be smaller? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, no, because as lambda decreases, sqrt(lambda) decreases. So v_p would decrease with lambda, but that would imply lower frequencies have higher phase velocities, which would be anomalous dispersion. But the problem says it's a normally dispersive medium, so higher frequencies should have higher phase velocities. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If v_p = k sqrt(lambda), then as lambda increases, v_p increases. Because sqrt(lambda) increases with lambda. So if lambda increases, v_p increases. Since lambda is c/v_p in vacuum, but in a medium, lambda = lambda_0 / n, where n is the refractive index. Hmm, but perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, in a normally dispersive medium, the refractive index n increases with frequency. Since v_p = c/n. So if n increases with f, then v_p decreases with f. Wait, no, in normal dispersion, n increases with f, which would make v_p = c/n decrease with f. That's opposite of what I thought earlier. So, higher frequencies have lower phase velocities in normal dispersion? Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, no, in normal dispersion, the refractive index n increases as frequency increases. So since v_p = c/n, higher n gives lower v_p. So phase velocity decreases with increasing frequency. Wait, that can't be right. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. Let me think of the standard example: in glass, higher frequencies (like blue) have higher refractive indices than lower frequencies (red). So n increases with frequency, causing the phase velocity v_p = c/n to decrease with frequency. So higher frequencies have lower phase velocities. But wait, that would mean that phase velocity decreases as frequency increases, which would be opposite of normal dispersion. Or wait, is that correct?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up group and phase velocities. Let me try to clarify.

In a normally dispersive medium, the group velocity increases with frequency. Wait, no. Let me think of the relation between group velocity and phase velocity. The group velocity v_g is the derivative of omega with respect to k, where k is the wave number. And in a medium, the dispersion relation is omega = v_p * k, but v_p may depend on k.

Wait, but for normal dispersion, the phase velocity v_p increases with frequency. Or does it decrease? Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact behavior. Oh wait, I can't look things up, so I need to think it through.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the given relation and the necessary equations to find the group velocity.

We know that the group velocity v_g is given by d omega / dk, where omega is angular frequency and k is the wave number (2pi/lambda).

Given that v_p = omega / k, and v_p = k * sqrt(lambda), perhaps I can express omega in terms of k and then take the derivative to find v_g.

Wait, let's try that.

Given that v_p = k * sqrt(lambda), but lambda is 2pi c / omega? No, wait, lambda in the medium is lambda = lambda_0 / n, but maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, let's express everything in terms of k.

Since v_p = omega / k, and v_p is also equal to k * sqrt(lambda). So from v_p = k * sqrt(lambda) and v_p = omega / k, we can write:

omega / k = k * sqrt(lambda) → omega = k^2 * sqrt(lambda).

But lambda is 2pi / k, because lambda = 2pi / k (since k = 2pi/lambda). So substituting lambda = 2pi/k into the equation:

omega = k^2 * sqrt(2pi/k) ) = k^2 * (2pi)^(1/2) * k^(-1/2) ) = (2pi)^(1/2) * k^(3/2).

So omega = (2pi)^(1/2) * k^(3/2).

Now, group velocity v_g is d omega / dk. So let's compute that derivative.

d omega/dk = (2pi)^(1/2) * (3/2) * k^(1/2) ) = (3/2) * sqrt(2pi) * sqrt(k).

But group velocity is v_g = d omega/dk.

Wait, so v_g = (3/2) * sqrt(2pi) * sqrt(k).

Alternatively, let's express this in terms of the given variables.

Wait, but maybe I can find k in terms of the given values.

Wait, the problem gives that at frequency f = 1e6 Hz, the phase velocity v_p is 3e8 m/s, and the wavelength is 300 meters.

So, at f = 1e6 Hz, lambda is 300 m.

So, the wave number k is 2pi / lambda = 2pi/(300) ≈ 0.02094 radians per meter.

But perhaps I can use the given relation v_p = k * sqrt(lambda). At this specific frequency and lambda of 300 m, v_p is 3e8 m/s.

So, plugging into v_p = k * sqrt(lambda):

3e8 = k * sqrt(300).

So, solving for k: k = 3e8 / sqrt(300) ≈ 3e8 / 17.3205 ≈ 1.732e7 (approximately).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Let me think again. Because in the expression v_p = k * sqrt(lambda), k is a constant, not the wave number. Oh wait! No, in the problem statement, the phase velocity is given by v = k * sqrt(lambda), where k is a constant. So in this equation, k is just a constant of proportionality, not the wave number. So perhaps I should avoid confusion by using a different symbol for the constant. Let's say, v_p = C * sqrt(lambda), where C is a constant.

So, given that, at lambda = 300 m, v_p =3e8 m/s.

So, 3e8 = C * sqrt(300). Solving for C: C = 3e8 / sqrt(300) ≈ 3e8 / 17.3205 ≈ 1.732e7 (approximately).

Now, the phase velocity as a function of lambda is v_p = C * sqrt(lambda). But phase velocity is also equal to f * lambda, because v_p = f lambda.

So, we have f lambda = C sqrt(lambda) → f = (C sqrt(lambda)) ) / lambda = C / sqrt(lambda).

So f is proportional to 1/sqrt(lambda). So, as lambda decreases (higher frequency), f increases, which is consistent with the medium being normally dispersive.

Now, to find the group velocity, which is v_g = d omega / dk.

But omega is 2 pi f, and k is 2 pi / lambda.

So, let's express omega in terms of lambda.

From f = C / sqrt(lambda), omega = 2 pi f = 2 pi C / sqrt(lambda).

Now, k = 2 pi / lambda, so lambda = 2 pi / k.

Substituting into omega: omega = 2 pi C / sqrt(2 pi / k) ) = 2 pi C / ( (2 pi)^(1/2) ) * k^(1/4) ) → let me compute this step by step.

Wait, sqrt(2 pi / k) is (2 pi /k )^(1/2) = (2 pi)^(1/2) * k^(-1/2).

So, 1/sqrt(2 pi /k) = (2 pi)^(-1/2) * k^(1/2).

So, omega = 2 pi C * (2 pi)^(-1/2) * k^(1/2) ) = C * (2 pi)^(1/2) ) * k^(1/2).

Wait, let me compute that:

omega = 2 pi C * [ (2 pi/k )^(-1/2) ) ]

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach would be better. Let me express omega in terms of k.

We have:

v_p = C sqrt(lambda).

But lambda = 2 pi /k, so v_p = C sqrt(2 pi /k) = C * (2 pi)^(1/2) * k^(-1/2).

But v_p is also equal to omega/k, because v_p = omega/k.

So, omega/k = C * (2 pi)^(1/2) * k^(-1/2).

Multiplying both sides by k gives omega = C (2 pi)^(1/2) k^(1/2).

So, omega = C (2 pi)^(1/2) k^(1/2).

Now, group velocity v_g is d omega/dk.

So, d omega/dk = C (2 pi)^(1/2) * (1/2) k^(-1/2) ) = [ C (2 pi)^(1/2) ] / (2 sqrt(k) ) ).

But wait, perhaps I can write this in terms of the known variables. Let's compute this expression.

We can express C in terms of the given data. Earlier, we found that C = 3e8 / sqrt(300).

So, substituting C:

v_g = [ (3e8 / sqrt(300)) * (2 pi)^(1/2) ) / (2 sqrt(k)) ) ].

But we also can express k in terms of lambda. At the given frequency, lambda is 300 m, so k = 2 pi / 300 ≈ 0.02094 rad/m. But perhaps I can express sqrt(k) in terms of lambda.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since we have an expression for v_p in terms of lambda, and v_g can be expressed in terms of v_p and the derivative of v_p with respect to lambda.

I recall that in some cases, group velocity can be found as v_g = v_p * (1 + (v_p / lambda) * (d lambda / d v_p) )^{-1} ), but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, another formula that might be useful is:

v_g = v_p - lambda (dv_p/d lambda).

Wait, yes, I think that's correct. Because group velocity is the derivative of omega with respect to k, and using the chain rule, it can be expressed in terms of the derivative of v_p with respect to lambda.

Wait, let's derive this. Since v_p = omega/k = (2 pi f)/(2 pi / lambda) ) = f lambda.

So, v_p = f lambda.

Group velocity v_g = d omega/dk.

But omega = 2 pi f, and k = 2 pi / lambda.

So, d omega/dk = d(2 pi f)/d(2 pi / lambda) = (d f/d (1/lambda)) * lambda^2? Hmm, maybe it's better to write f as a function of lambda and take the derivative.

Alternatively, let's express f in terms of lambda. From earlier, f = C / sqrt(lambda).

So, f = C lambda^(-1/2).

Then, v_p = f lambda = C lambda^(-1/2) * lambda = C lambda^(1/2). Which matches the given v_p = C sqrt(lambda).

So, v_p = C sqrt(lambda).

Now, group velocity v_g is d omega/dk. But omega = 2 pi f = 2 pi C lambda^(-1/2).

And k = 2 pi / lambda.

So, let's express omega as a function of lambda: omega = 2 pi C lambda^(-1/2).

We can write lambda in terms of k: lambda = 2 pi /k → k = 2 pi / lambda.

So, omega = 2 pi C (lambda)^(-1/2) = 2 pi C ( (2 pi /k) )^(-1/2 ) = 2 pi C (k/(2 pi))^(1/2) ) = 2 pi C * (k)^(1/2) / (2 pi)^(1/2) ) = C (2 pi)^(1/2) * k^(1/2).

So, omega = C (2 pi)^(1/2) k^(1/2).

Now, take the derivative of omega with respect to k:

d omega/dk = C (2 pi)^(1/2) * (1/2) k^(-1/2) = [ C (2 pi)^(1/2) ] / (2 sqrt(k) ) ).

But what's sqrt(k)? k = 2 pi / lambda. So sqrt(k) = sqrt(2 pi / lambda).

So, substituting back:

v_g = [ C (2 pi)^(1/2) ] / [ 2 * sqrt(2 pi / lambda) ) ].

Let me simplify this expression.

The denominator inside the square root is (2 pi / lambda), so sqrt(2 pi / lambda) = sqrt(2 pi) / sqrt(lambda).

So, substituting:

v_g = [ C (2 pi)^(1/2) ] / [ 2 * ( sqrt(2 pi) / sqrt(lambda) ) ) ] = [ C (2 pi)^(1/2) * sqrt(lambda) ) ] / [ 2 sqrt(2 pi) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The (2 pi)^(1/2) in numerator and denominator will cancel out, leaving:

[ C * sqrt(lambda) ] / 2.

So, v_g = (C * sqrt(lambda)) / 2.

But wait, v_p = C * sqrt(lambda), so v_g = v_p / 2.

Wait, that's a neat result. So group velocity is half of phase velocity.

At the given phase velocity of 3e8 m/s, the group velocity would be 3e8 / 2 = 1.5e8 m/s, which is 1.5 × 10^8 m/s.

Looking back at the options, option H is 1.5 × 10^8 m/s.

Wait, but wait a minute, is this correct? Because in a normally dispersive medium, I thought group velocity is usually less than phase velocity, which is what we have here. But let me double-check.

Wait, wait, in the derivation, I ended up with v_g = (C * sqrt(lambda))/2. Since v_p = C sqrt(lambda), that gives v_g = v_p / 2, so yes, group velocity is half of phase velocity.

So, if phase velocity is 3e8 m/s, group velocity is 1.5e8 m/s, which is option H.
