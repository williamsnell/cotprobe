Okay, so I have this question about eosinophilic esophagitis, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me start by recalling what I know about this condition.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is an inflammatory condition of the esophagus. I remember that it's associated with eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell, accumulating in the esophageal lining. This usually happens in response to an allergen or some kind of immune reaction. So it's often linked to allergies, maybe food allergies or something in the environment.

The symptoms can include difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and maybe chest pain. I think it can cause narrowing of the esophagus over time, which could lead to obstruction. Oh wait, obstruction is when something blocks the passage, so if the esophagus becomes narrow, that could definitely cause obstruction issues. That might relate to option B.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Leads to oesophageal diverticular. Diverticula are like pouches that form in the walls of the esophagus. I'm not too sure about this one. I think diverticula are more common in the lower esophagus and are often associated with conditions like diverticulitis, but I don't recall a direct link between eosinophilic esophagitis and diverticula. Maybe it's not a cause of diverticula.

Option B: May cause esophageal obstruction. That seems plausible because if the esophagus narrows due to chronic inflammation and scarring, it could obstruct the passage of food. So this option sounds correct.

Option C: Is not due to allergy. Wait, I thought eosinophilic esophagitis is often related to allergic reactions, especially food allergies. So option C saying it's not due to allergy would be incorrect. Maybe some cases aren't allergic, but many are, so this statement is false.

Option D: Benefits from antacid therapy. Antacids are used to neutralize stomach acid, typically for GERD or peptic ulcers. Eosinophilic esophagitis is an inflammatory condition, so I don't think antacids would help much. The treatment usually involves other approaches like steroids, dietary changes, or avoiding allergens.

So putting it all together: the correct answers should be either B or maybe another option. Let me double-check.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is indeed associated with esophageal narrowing (stricture) and can cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food impaction, which are signs of obstruction. So B makes sense.

Option C is incorrect because the condition is often due to allergies. Option A, I don't think is correct. Option D, no, because antacids aren't the treatment.

So the correct answer should be B: May cause esophageal obstruction.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is an inflammatory condition characterized by the accumulation of eosinophils in the esophageal lining, often due to allergic reactions, particularly food allergies. It can lead to symptoms such as difficulty swallowing and food impaction, which are indicative of esophageal narrowing or obstruction. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Eosinophilic esophagitis does not typically lead to oesophageal diverticula, which are pouches forming in the esophageal wall. This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: The condition can cause esophageal narrowing and obstruction due to chronic inflammation and scarring, making this correct.
- **Option C**: The statement that eosinophilic esophagitis is not due to allergy is false, as many cases are linked to allergic reactions.
- **Option D**: Antacid therapy is ineffective for this condition, as it is not caused by acid reflux but by inflammation. This is incorrect.

The correct answer is **B: May cause esophageal obstruction**.

Answer: B
