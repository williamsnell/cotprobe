Okay, so I have this group theory question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false.

Let me read the statements again.

Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.

Statement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.

Hmm. I remember that in group theory, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer m such that a^m = e, where e is the identity element. So the order of an element divides the order of the group, according to Lagrange's theorem.

Wait, but what determines the number of elements of a particular order in a group? I think it has to do with the group's structure. For example, in cyclic groups, the number of elements of a specific order is determined by the divisors of the group's order. But this isn't a cyclic group necessarily, right?

Let me think. For a cyclic group of order n, the number of elements of order d is φ(d), where φ is Euler's totient function, and d divides n. So if d=15, φ(15) = φ(3*5) = (3-1)(5-1)=2*4=8. So a cyclic group of order 15 would have exactly 8 elements of order 15. But wait, the question isn't about cyclic groups specifically. It's about any group.

So I think that in a general group, the number of elements of order d might not be exactly φ(d) as in cyclic groups. But there's something about the number of elements of a given order being a multiple of the order of the automorphism group or something... Or maybe it's related to conjugacy classes?

Wait, I remember that in a group, elements can be conjugate to each other, and elements in the same conjugacy class have the same order. But that might not directly apply here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible orders of elements and how they relate to the group's structure.

Another thought: if an element has order 15, then the cyclic subgroup it generates has order 15. The number of elements of order 15 in this subgroup would be φ(15)=8. So in this subgroup alone, there are 8 elements of order 15. But the entire group could have more elements of order 15 if there are multiple such subgroups. Or perhaps the group is abelian, which might affect the number.

Wait, but wait. If a group has one element of order 15, then it must contain at least as many elements of order 15 as are in the cyclic subgroup generated by that element, which is 8. So statement 1 seems to be true. Because the cyclic subgroup generated by that element would have 8 elements of order 15, so the group as a whole must have at least 8 elements of that order.

So I think statement 1 is true.

Now, statement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements.

Hmm. So if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, does that mean the number jumps to at least 16?

Wait, I'm trying to think if there's a group where the number of elements of order 15 is, say, 9 or 10. Let's think of the cyclic group of order 15: it has exactly 8 elements of order 15. If I take a direct product of two such cyclic groups, say C15 × C15, then the number of elements of order 15 might be higher. But wait, let me calculate.

In C15 × C15, each element is a pair (a,b) where a and b are in C15. The order of (a,b) is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b. So for (a,b) to have order 15, the orders of a and b must be such that their lcm is 15. So possible cases:

- a has order 15, b has order 1: Then the order is 15.
- a has order 1, b has order 15.
- a has order 15, b has order 3: Then lcm(15,3)=15.
- a has order 3, b has order 15.
- a has order 15, b has order 5.
- a has order 5, b has order 15.
- a has order 3, b has order 5: Then lcm(3,5)=15.
- a has order 5, b has order 3.

Wait, but in each case, the number of such elements would be combinations of the elements in each component.

So let's compute the number of elements of order 15 in C15 × C15.

In C15, the number of elements of order d (where d divides 15) is φ(d).

So for each possible pair (a,b):

Case 1: a has order 15 (φ(15)=8), b has order 1 (only the identity, φ(1)=1). So the number here is 8*1=8 elements.

Case 2: a has order 1, b has order 15: 1*8=8 elements.

But wait, some elements might be counted in both cases, but no—since a is in one component and b in another, these are distinct elements unless a is identity and b is identity, but that's just the identity element, which has order 1. So total from cases 1 and 2: 8+8=16 elements.

Wait, but let me think again. No, because when a is order 15 and b is order 1, that's 8 elements. When a is order 1 and b is order 15, that's another 8 elements. But what about other cases where the order is 15?

Wait, suppose a has order 3 and b has order 5. Then the order is lcm(3,5)=15. How many such elements are there?

In C15, the number of elements of order 3 is φ(3)=2, and order 5 is φ(5)=4. So the number of elements where a has order 3 and b has order 5 is 2*4=8. Similarly, when a has order 5 and b has order 3, that's 4*2=8. So adding these, that's 16 more elements. 

Wait, but wait. No, that's not correct because in the pair (a,b), if a has order 3 and b has order 5, that's a separate set of elements. So beyond the 16 elements in cases 1 and 2, there's another 8 + 8 = 16 elements here, making a total of 16 + 16 = 32 elements of order 15. But that can't be right because the group C15×C15 has 225 elements. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The total number of elements of order 15 in C15 × C15 would be the number of pairs (a,b) where lcm(ord(a), ord(b))=15.

So the possible ord(a) and ord(b) can be:

- (15,1), (1,15): each contributes 8 elements, so 16 total.
- (3,5), (5,3): each contributes 2*4=8 and 4*2=8, so 16 total.
Wait, but 3 and 5 are coprime, so their lcm is 15.

Wait, but in C15, the number of elements of order 3 is φ(3)=2, order 5 is φ(5)=4. So for a in order 3 and b in order 5, 2*4=8 elements. Similarly, a in order5 and b in order3, 4*2=8. So that's 8+8=16 elements.

So total elements of order 15 would be 16 (from cases 1 and 2) plus 16 (from cases 3 and 4), totaling 32 elements. So in this case, the group has 32 elements of order 15. But that's way more than 16.

Wait, but the question is: if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, does it necessarily have at least 16? So in this case, yes, because 32 is more than 16. But what if there's a group where more than 8 elements exist but less than 16? Like, say, 9 elements?

Wait, is that possible? Let me think. Suppose I have a group that's not abelian. For example, perhaps a non-abelian group where the number of elements of order 15 is 9. But I don't know any such group off the top of my head.

Wait, another approach. Suppose the group has a unique cyclic subgroup of order 15. Then, the number of elements of order 15 would be exactly 8, as in the cyclic group. But if there are multiple cyclic subgroups of order 15, perhaps the number increases. Each additional cyclic subgroup would contribute 8 elements, but perhaps some elements are shared between them. Wait, but in reality, two distinct cyclic subgroups of the same order in a group must intersect only at the identity, I think. So if a group has two distinct cyclic subgroups of order 15, each contributes 8 elements, but they share only the identity. So the total elements of order 15 would be 8 + 8 -1 (since identity is counted in both, but it's order 1). Wait, but the identity isn't order 15. So perhaps the total is 8 + 8 = 16 elements of order 15.

Wait, but then if a group has two distinct cyclic subgroups of order 15, then the number of elements of order 15 is 16. So if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16.

Wait, but what if a group has, say, 9 elements of order 15? Then according to this reasoning, that's impossible because any additional cyclic subgroup beyond the first would add 8 elements. So you can't have 9; you'd go from 8 to 16.

Wait, but that's only if the group is abelian. Because in non-abelian groups, the structure might be different. Let me think about a specific example.

Wait, let me consider the cyclic group of order 15. It has 8 elements of order 15. Now, suppose I take the direct product of this group with another group, say C2. Then the group would be C15 × C2. Now, what's the number of elements of order 15 in this group?

Well, in C15 × C2, an element (a, b) has order equal to the lcm of the orders of a and b. So for the order to be 15, b must have order 1 because C2 has elements of order 1 and 2. So if b has order 1, then the order of (a, b) is the same as the order of a. So the number of elements of order 15 would be the same as in C15, which is 8. But if b has order 2, then the order of (a, b) would be lcm(ord(a), 2). For this to be 15, ord(a) must be 15, since 15 is coprime with 2. So the order would be 15. So the number of such elements would be 8 (from a) * 1 (from b having order 2) = 8 elements. So total elements of order 15 would be 8 (when b is identity) + 8 (when b is order 2) = 16.

So in C15 × C2, there are 16 elements of order 15. So if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16. Because you can't have an intermediate number like 9, 10, etc. So statement 2 would be true.

Wait, but wait a minute. Suppose a group has a single cyclic subgroup of order 15. Then it has 8 elements. Now, if the group has, for some reason, another element of order 15 outside this cyclic subgroup, would that require another cyclic subgroup, thus adding 8 more elements (making 16 total)?

Wait, because if an element of order 15 exists outside a cyclic subgroup, then it must generate another cyclic subgroup of order 15. Because each element generates a cyclic subgroup. So if you have two distinct cyclic subgroups of order 15, then each contributes 8 elements, and since they intersect trivially (only identity), but identity isn't of order 15, so the total would be 16.

So in that case, yes, having more than 8 elements of order 15 would require at least 16.

Wait, but perhaps in some non-abelian groups, the number could be different. Let me think. For example, in the dihedral group of order 30, which is a non-abelian group. Wait, but does it have elements of order 15?

Wait, the dihedral group Dn has order 2n. So D15 has order 30. The elements in D15 are rotations and reflections. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 15. So in D15, the rotations include elements of order 15, and the number is φ(15)=8. The reflections have order 2. So D15 has 8 elements of order 15. So in this case, the group has exactly 8 elements of order 15. So if a group has more than 8, it must have more.

Wait, but wait. Are there any non-abelian groups with more than 8 elements of order 15 but less than 16? I don't think so. Because in any group, the cyclic subgroups of a given order are either unique or, if multiple exist, their elements are disjoint except the identity. So the number would be multiples of φ(15)=8.

Wait, so if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16. So statement 2 is also true.

Wait, that would mean both statements are true. So the answer would be option A: True, True.

But wait, earlier when I thought about statement 2, I thought that if you have more than 8, you must have at least 16. So statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now because earlier I thought statement 2 is true, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think of a group where the number of elements of order 15 is exactly 9. Is that possible?

Suppose a group G has an element a of order 15, so it generates a cyclic subgroup of order 15, contributing 8 elements. Now, suppose there's another element b of order 15 not in this subgroup. Then b would generate another cyclic subgroup of order 15, which would contribute another 8 elements. But wait, the intersection of these two cyclic subgroups would only be the identity, so the total elements of order 15 would be 8 + 8 = 16. So you can't have just 9, because adding another cyclic subgroup adds 8 elements, not just 1.

Therefore, it's impossible to have 9 elements of order 15. So if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16. So statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true, so the answer would be A: True, True.

Wait, but wait another thought: what about a group of order 15? Well, a group of order 15 is cyclic, so it has exactly 8 elements of order 15. So if a group has order 15, it can't have more than 8 elements of order 15. But the question is about groups that have elements of order 15, regardless of their overall size.

Wait, but what about a group that's a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 15? Like C15 × C15. As I thought earlier, that group would have 8 elements from each component when the other component is identity, and another 16 elements from combinations where orders are 3 and 5. So the total elements of order 15 would be 8 + 8 + 16 = 32? Or wait, maybe I'm overcounting.

Wait no, in C15 × C15, an element (a, b) has order 15 if the lcm of ord(a) and ord(b) is 15. So:

- ord(a)=15, ord(b)=1: 8 elements.
- ord(a)=1, ord(b)=15: 8 elements.
- ord(a)=3, ord(b)=5: 2 * 4 =8 elements.
- ord(a)=5, ord(b)=3: 4 * 2=8 elements.

So total is 8 + 8 + 8 +8 = 32 elements of order 15. So yes, 32 elements, which is more than 16.

So in any case, if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16. So statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true, so the answer is A: True, True.

Wait, but I'm now getting a bit confused because I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to think of any exceptions or cases where statement 2 might not hold.

Another approach: think about the number of elements of order d in a group, for d being a divisor of the group's order. In a group, the number of elements of order d is a multiple of φ(d), because each cyclic subgroup of order d contributes φ(d) elements, and these subgroups can't share elements of order d except the identity, which isn't of order d>1.

So if a group has more than φ(d) elements of order d, it must have at least 2φ(d) elements. Because each additional cyclic subgroup of order d adds φ(d) elements. So here, φ(15)=8, so if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16. So statement 2 is true.

Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are true.

To analyze the given statements, we need to consider the properties of group theory, particularly focusing on the number of elements of a specific order in a group.

### Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.

In group theory, if a group contains an element of order 15, that element generates a cyclic subgroup of order 15. Within this cyclic subgroup
