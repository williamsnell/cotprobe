Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about blood types and allele frequencies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the question is about the ABO blood group system. From what I remember, the ABO system involves three alleles: I^A, I^B, and I^O (which is often written as 'i'). So the phenotypes are A, B, AB, and O.

The data given is the number and frequency of each phenotype. Let's list them out:

- Phenotype A: 249 people, frequency 0.2075
- Phenotype B: 376, frequency 0.3133
- Phenotype AB: 77, 0.0642
- Phenotype O: 498, 0.4150

Wait, the total is 1,200 students, and the frequencies add up to 1. So that's correct.

The question asks for the frequencies of the three alleles: I^A (let's say 'p'), I^B ('q'), and I^O ('r'). And the population is in genetic equilibrium, so I can use Hardy-Weinberg equations.

Right, the Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. So the equations are:

p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + r^2 + ... Wait no, more accurately, the genotype frequencies are:

- Phenotype A: could be AA (I^A I^A) or AO (I^A I^O). So the frequency is p^2 + pr.
- Phenotype B: similarly, q^2 + qr.
- Phenotype AB: 2pq (since it's I^A I^B).
- Phenotype O: r^2 (I^O I^O).

Wait wait, no. Oh wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, in the ABO system, I think the O phenotype comes only from the OO genotype. But for A and B, they can come from homozygous (AA or BB) or heterozygous (AO or BO, but wait, no, AO would be A phenotype, BO would be B.)

Wait, no, no. Let's clarify:

In the ABO system, the possible genotypes and phenotypes are:

- I^A I^A → A
- I^A I^B → AB
- I^A I^O → A
- I^B I^B → B
- I^B I^O → B
- I^O I^O → O

So the phenotype frequencies can be written in terms of allele frequencies.

Let me think. Let p = frequency of I^A, q = I^B, r = I^O. And p + q + r = 1.

The phenotype frequencies are:

- A: includes I^A I^A, I^A I^O → p² + 2pr? Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the ABO system, the genotypes are:

Phenotype A: I^A I^A (frequency p²) and I^A I^O (frequency 2pr, but wait, no, because I^O is recessive. Wait, no. Wait, no, no. Wait, actually, in the ABO system, the I^O allele is recessive. So the A phenotype is when you have at least one I^A allele. So phenotype A is I^A I^A (frequency p²) and I^A I^O (frequency 2pr). Similarly, phenotype B is I^B I^B (q²) and I^B I^O (2qr). Phenotype AB is I^A I^B (2pq). Phenotype O is I^O I^O (r²).

Wait, but wait, no. Because the I^A and I^B are codominant. So someone who is I^A I^B would have AB blood. But for A and B phenotypes, you can have either two dominant alleles or one dominant and the recessive.

So, the frequencies are:

- P(A) = p² + 2pr → no, wait, wait. Because 2pr would be the frequency of the heterozygote I^A I^O. So the A phenotype is p² (homozygous AA) plus 2pr (heterozygous AO). Similarly, B phenotype is q² + 2qr (BO). O is r². AB is 2pq.

So, given the phenotype frequencies, we can set up equations:

Let me write down the observed frequencies:

Phenotype A: 0.2075 → P(A) = p² + 2pr = 0.2075
Phenotype B: 0.3133 → P(B) = q² + 2qr = 0.3133
Phenotype AB: 0.0642 → P(AB) = 2pq = 0.0642
Phenotype O: 0.4150 → P(O) = r² = 0.4150

Wait, but wait, since the sum of all allele frequencies must be p + q + r = 1.

Hmm. So let's think about what we can calculate. Let's start with what's easiest.

Looking at the O phenotype: r² = 0.415 → r = sqrt(0.415) ≈ 0.644, but wait, wait. Wait, 0.415 is the frequency of O, which is r squared. So r = sqrt(0.415) ≈ 0.644, but wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.415 is 0.415, so r^2=0.415 → r = sqrt(0.415) ≈ 0.644. Wait, but that would make r about 0.644. But p + q + r = 1, so p + q would be about 0.356. Hmm, but let's see if that makes sense.

Wait, but let's also look at the AB phenotype: 2pq = 0.0642. So pq = 0.0642 / 2 = 0.0321.

So if we can find p and q, given that p + q = 1 - r.

Wait, since r is about 0.644, p + q would be 1 - 0.644 = 0.356.

So p + q = 0.356, and pq = 0.0321.

We can set up equations to solve for p and q.

Let me denote s = p + q = 0.356, and t = pq = 0.0321.

We can use the quadratic equation. Since p and q are the roots of the equation x² - s x + t = 0.

So x² - 0.356 x + 0.0321 = 0.

Let me compute the discriminant: (0.356)^2 - 4 * 1 * 0.0321.

0.356^2 = approx 0.1267. 4*0.0321=0.1284.

So discriminant is 0.1267 - 0.1284 = -0.0017.

Wait, that's a negative discriminant, which would mean no real solutions. That can't be right. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, but that can't be. So perhaps I should re-examine my assumptions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of r.

Wait, the O phenotype is r². So if O's frequency is 0.415, then r is sqrt(0.415) ≈ 0.644? Let me compute this accurately.

Calculating sqrt(0.415):

Well, 0.6^2 is 0.36. 0.64^2 is 0.4096. 0.645^2 is 0.4160. Oh, so sqrt(0.415) is approximately 0.644.

Wait, 0.644 * 0.644 = (0.6)^2 + 2*0.6*0.044 + (0.044)^2 = 0.36 + 0.0528 + 0.001936 = 0.414736, which is about 0.4147. Close to 0.415, so r ≈ 0.644.

So that's correct. So p + q = 1 - 0.644 ≈ 0.356. And pq ≈ 0.0321.

But when I plug into the quadratic equation, I get a negative discriminant. That's impossible. So I must have messed up.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equations correctly.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the allele frequencies.

Each person has two alleles. The total alleles in the population would be 2 * 1200 = 2400.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate allele frequencies directly from the phenotype frequencies.

Wait, but in the ABO system, the I^A and I^B are codominant, and I^O is recessive.

Alternatively, let me think about the frequency of each allele.

The I^A allele occurs in the A and AB phenotypes. So the frequency of I^A is:

p = (number of A alleles + number of AB alleles) / (2 * total population)

Wait, more accurately, the frequency of the I^A allele (p) can be calculated as:

p = [2 * (number of AA individuals) + number of A in AO] + [number of A in AB] / (2 * total population).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to calculate p and q using the Hardy-Weinberg equations.

Wait, let me think again.

We have:

r^2 = 0.415 → r = sqrt(0.415) ≈ 0.644.

So r = 0.644, so p + q = 1 - 0.644 = 0.356.

We also have 2pq = 0.0642 → pq = 0.0321.

So, knowing that p + q = 0.356 and pq = 0.0321, let's create the quadratic equation.

Let x = p, then q = 0.356 - x.

So equation becomes x*(0.356 - x) = 0.0321.

Which is 0.356 x - x² = 0.0321 → x² - 0.356 x + 0.0321 = 0.

Now compute the discriminant D = (0.356)^2 - 4*1*0.0321.

(0.356)^2 = 0.356 * 0.356. Let's calculate:

0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09.

0.3 * 0.056 = 0.0168.

0.056 * 0.3 = 0.0168.

0.056 * 0.056 = approx 0.003136.

So 0.356^2 = (0.3 + 0.056)^2 = 0.3^2 + 2*(0.3)*(0.056) + 0.056^2 = 0.09 + 0.0336 + 0.003136 = 0.126736.

D = 0.126736 - (4*0.0321) → 4*0.0321 = 0.1284.

So D = 0.126736 - 0.1284 = -0.001664.

Hmm, negative discriminant. That's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I should calculate p and q via their contributions to the A and B phenotypes.

Wait, the A phenotype is A and AO. So the frequency of A is p² + 2pr = 0.2075.

Similarly, the B phenotype is q² + 2qr = 0.3133.

Wait, perhaps I can express p and q in terms of r, then solve.

We have r = sqrt(0.415) ≈ 0.644.

So let's plug r into the equations.

From A phenotype:

p² + 2pr = 0.2075 → p² + 2p*(0.644) = 0.2075.

Similarly, B phenotype:

q² + 2q*(0.644) = 0.3133.

And we know that p + q + r = 1 → p + q = 1 - 0.644 = 0.356.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe we can find p from the A equation and q from the B equation.

Alternatively, let me try to express p and q in terms of the observed phenotype frequencies.

Wait, another approach: the allele frequencies can be calculated as follows.

The frequency of I^A (p) is equal to (number of A alleles in the population) divided by the total number of alleles.

Similarly for I^B (q) and I^O (r).

So, the number of I^A alleles comes from:

- Each AA individual contributes 2 I^A alleles.

- Each AO individual contributes 1 I^A allele.

- Each AB individual contributes 1 I^A allele.

So total I^A alleles = 2*(number of AA) + 1*(number of AO) + 1*(number of AB).

Similarly, the total alleles in the population is 2*1200 = 2400.

But wait, perhaps I can calculate this.

But I don't have the counts for each genotype, only the phenotypes. So let's think:

- Phenotype A includes AA and AO. So number of A alleles from phenotype A is:

AA individuals: n_AA = p² * 1200 → but wait, I don't know p, that's what I'm trying to find.

Hmm, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of phenotype frequencies.

Wait, another formula: In the ABO system, the allele frequencies can be calculated as:

p = (2 * [frequency of A] + [frequency of AB]) / 2 → wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall that:

The frequency of I^A (p) is equal to (number of A phenotypes + AB phenotypes) / (2 * total population), but adjusted for the fact that AO individuals have only one I^A allele.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Another way: The I^A allele is present in:

- All AA individuals (homozygous): each contributes 2 I^A alleles.

- All AO individuals (heterozygous): each contributes 1 I^A.

- All AB individuals: each contributes 1 I^A.

Similarly, I^B is present in:

- All BB: 2 I^B.

- All BO: 1 I^B.

- All AB: 1 I^B.

I^O is present in:

- All OO: 2 I^O.

- All AO: 1 I^O.

- All BO: 1 I^O.

Wait, but since I don't have the genotype data, perhaps I can express the allele frequencies in terms of the phenotype frequencies.

Let me denote:

n_A = number of A phenotype = 249 → 0.2075.

n_B = 376 → 0.3133.

n_AB = 77 → 0.0642.

n_O = 498 → 0.415.

So, the total I^A alleles:

Each A phenotype contributes (assuming Hardy-Weinberg proportions) p^2 * 2 (from AA) + 2pr * 1 (from AO, since each AO has one I^A).

Wait, but I don't know p, so perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the total I^A alleles per person would be:

In phenotype A: Each A phenotype individual has either AA (2 I^A) or AO (1 I^A). The proportion of AA in A phenotype is p² / (p² + 2pr), and AO is 2pr / (p² + 2pr).

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the frequency of the I^A allele is equal to the sum of the frequencies of the A and AB phenotypes divided by 2.

Wait, no. Because each A phenotype individual has one or two I^A alleles, and each AB has one.

Similarly, each B phenotype has one or two I^B, and each AB has one.

Wait, maybe the correct way is:

p (I^A) = [2*(number of AA) + number of AO + number of AB] / (2*N)

Similarly,

q (I^B) = [2*(number of BB) + number of BO + number of AB] / (2*N)

r (I^O) = [2*(number of OO) + number of AO + number of BO] / (2*N)

But since we don't know the genotype numbers, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, but we can express the genotype counts in terms of allele frequencies.

Because the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can write:

Genotype AA: p² → count = p² * N.

Genotype AO: 2pr → count = 2pr * N.

Genotype AB: 2pq → count = 2pq * N.

Genotype BB: q² → count = q² * N.

Genotype BO: 2qr → count = 2qr * N.

Genotype OO: r² → count = r² * N.

So, for the I^A allele, the total number of I^A alleles is:

AA: 2*p²*N

AO: 1*2pr*N (since each AO has one I^A)

AB: 1*2pq*N (each AB has one I^A)

Similarly, the total I^A alleles = 2p² N + 2pr N + 2pq N.

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

Each AA individual has 2 I^A → total I^A from AA: 2 * (p² N).

Each AO individual has 1 I^A → total from AO: 1 * (2pr N) → 2pr N.

Each AB individual has 1 I^A → total from AB: 1 * (2pq N) → 2pq N.

So total I^A alleles = 2p² N + 2pr N + 2pq N.

Similarly, total alleles in the population is 2N.

So, the frequency p is:

p = [2p² N + 2pr N + 2pq
