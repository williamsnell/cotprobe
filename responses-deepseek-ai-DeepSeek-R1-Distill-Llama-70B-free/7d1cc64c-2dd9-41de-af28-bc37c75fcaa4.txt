Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the correct answer. Let me try to work through it step by step. The functions are f(x) = 3x, g(x) = 5x + 3, and h(x) = 1 – x². I need to compute f(g(h(x))). Hmm, that's function composition, right? So I think I should start from the inside and work my way out.

First, I'll find h(x). That's given as 1 minus x squared. So h(x) = 1 - x². Got that.

Next, I need to plug h(x) into g(x). So g(h(x)) would be g(1 - x²). Wait, what's g(x)? Oh right, g(x) is 5x + 3. So wherever there's an x in g(x), I replace it with h(x). So that becomes 5*(1 - x²) + 3. Let me compute that.

5*(1 - x²) is 5*1 minus 5*x², which is 5 - 5x². Then adding 3 gives 5 + 3 -5x², which is 8 -5x². So g(h(x)) equals 8 -5x². Got that down.

Now I need to plug this result into f(x). Because the composition is f(g(h(x))), right? So f takes the output of g(h(x)), which is 8 -5x². Since f(x) is 3x, I replace x with 8 -5x². So f(g(h(x))) becomes 3*(8 -5x²).

Let me compute that. 3*8 is 24, and 3*(-5x²) is -15x². So putting it together, that's 24 -15x². Or, rearranged, -15x² +24.

Wait, let me check the options. The options are A through J. Let me look:

Option A: –15x² +24. Oh that's exactly what I got.

Wait, let me double-check my steps in case I made a mistake. So h(x) is correct as 1 -x². Then g(h(x)) is 5*(1 -x²) +3. 5*1 is 5, 5*(-x²) is -5x², plus 3 equals 8-5x². Yes.

Then f of that is 3*(8 -5x²) =24 -15x². So that's -15x² +24, which matches option A.

Wait, but I see other options with some similar terms. Let me make sure I didn't misread the functions. Oh, wait, wait. Let me check the functions again.

f(x) is 3x, correct. g(x) is 5x +3, right. h(x) is 1 – x², yes.

So the steps are correct. So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we compute the composition \( f(g(h(x))) \) step by step:

1. **Compute \( h(x) \):**  
   Given \( h(x) = 1 - x^2 \).

2. **Compute \( g(h(x)) \):**  
   Substitute \( h(x) = 1 - x^2 \) into \( g(x) = 5x + 3 \):  
   \[
   g(h(x)) = 5(1 - x^2) + 3 = 5 - 5x^2 + 3 = 8 - 5x^2.
   \]

3. **Compute \( f(g(h(x))) \):**  
   Substitute \( g(h(x)) = 8 - 5x^2 \) into \( f(x) = 3x \):  
   \[
   f(g(h(x))) = 3(8 - 5x^2) = 24 - 15x^2 = -15x^2 + 24.
   \]

The result is \( -15x^2 + 24 \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
