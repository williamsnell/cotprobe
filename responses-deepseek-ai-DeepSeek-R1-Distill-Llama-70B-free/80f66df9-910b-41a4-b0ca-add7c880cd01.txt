Okay, so Debra wants to buy a used car worth $720, and she has two options to pay for it. She can either use an installment plan or borrow the money at an 8% interest rate. I need to figure out which option is more economical and by how much.

First, let me look at the installment plan. It says 10% down and then 12 monthly payments of $65. So, the down payment is 10% of $720. Let me calculate that: 10% of 720 is 0.10 * 720 = $72. So she pays $72 upfront.

Then there are 12 monthly payments of $65 each. So the total for the payments would be 12 * 65. Let me compute that: 12 * 60 is 720, and 12 *5 is 60, so total is 720 +60= $780. So the total cost with the installment plan is the down payment plus the monthly payments: $72 + $780 = $852.

Wait, but the car is worth $720. So in installment plan, she's paying $852 in total. So that's more than the car's value. Hmm, that's interesting. So the installment plan includes some interest or fees, I guess.

Now, the other option is to borrow $720 at 8% interest for 12 months. I need to calculate the total interest she would pay here. Since it's a 12-month period, and the interest rate is 8%, which is annual, so the interest for one year would be 8% of 720.

Calculating that: 0.08 * 720 = $57.60. So the total amount she would repay is the principal plus interest: $720 + $57.60 = $777.60.

Wait, so comparing the two options:

- Installment plan: $852 total cost.
- Loan: $777.60 total cost.

So the loan is cheaper, right? Because $777.60 is less than $852.

The difference between the two is $852 - $777.60 = $74.40. So by choosing the loan, she saves $74.40 compared to the installment plan.

Now looking at the options, option H says "Borrow the $720 at 8% interest with savings of $74.40." That matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Down payment calculation: 10% of 720 is 72. Correct.

Monthly payments: 12 *65=780. Correct. So total installment cost is 72+780=852. Correct.

Loan interest: 720 *0.08=57.60. Total repayment 720+57.60=777.60. Correct.

Difference: 852-777.60=74.40. So yes, H is correct.

To determine the more economical financing method for Debra Cole, we compare the total costs of the two options:

1. **Installment Plan**:  
   - Down payment: $720 * 10% = $72  
   - Monthly payments: 12 * $65 = $780  
   - Total cost: $72 + $780 = $852  

2. **Loan at 8% Interest**:  
   - Principal: $720  
   - Interest: $720 * 8% = $57.60  
   - Total cost: $720 + $57.60 = $777.60  

The difference in total cost between the two options is:  
$852 (installment plan) - $777.60 (loan) = $74.40  

Thus, borrowing the $720 at 8% interest saves Debra $74.40 compared to the installment plan. The correct answer is **H: Borrow the $720 at 8% interest with savings of $74.40**.
