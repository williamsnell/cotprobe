Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about blood sample concentrations after eating breakfast. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a 45-year-old man who broke his overnight fast by eating three slices of toast and a boiled egg. The key here is understanding how different substances in the blood change after eating versus before eating.

First, let's consider what happens when someone fasts overnight. Fasting usually means the body isn't taking in food, so it starts using stored energy. The primary sources of energy during fasting are glycogen and then fat. Glycogen is broken down into glucose, which is used by the cells. Once glycogen stores are depleted, the body starts breaking down fat, which produces ketone bodies as a byproduct.

Now, after eating, especially a meal like toast and an egg, several things happen. The toast is mainly carbohydrates, which will cause a rise in blood glucose. The egg contains protein and some fat. 

Looking at the options:

A: Cholesterol. Hmm, cholesterol levels might be influenced by diet, but I don't think a single meal would cause an immediate spike in blood cholesterol. That's more about long-term intake, so probably not higher after breakfast.

B: Lactate. Lactate levels can rise during intense exercise when muscles ferment glucose. But after a meal, I'm not sure lactate would be higher. Unless the meal caused some stress, but that's unlikely. Probably not the right answer.

C: Glucose. Yes! When you eat, especially after fasting, your blood glucose increases. The carbohydrates from the toast would be broken down into glucose, leading to higher blood glucose levels. So this is a strong candidate.

D: Ketone bodies. During fasting, when glucose is low, the body produces ketones. After eating, especially a meal with carbs, insulin is released, which inhibits ketone production. So ketones should be lower after breakfast. So D is probably lower, not higher.

E: Glycogen. Blood glycogen? Wait, glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles, not really circulating in the blood. So measuring glycogen in blood doesn't make much sense. So E is unlikely to be correct.

F: Pyruvate. Pyruvate is a product of glycolysis. When glucose is abundant, glycolysis happens more, so pyruvate might increase. But I'm not sure if this would be a significant change in blood concentration immediately after eating. Also, pyruvate is more of an intermediate and might be converted into other things. Maybe not the best choice.

G: Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). During fasting, fat breakdown releases NEFAs into the bloodstream. After eating, especially a meal with carbohydrates, insulin is released, which inhibits lipolysis (fat breakdown), so NEFAs decrease. So G would be lower after breakfast.

So the options that are higher after the meal are C (glucose), maybe F (pyruvate), and perhaps E but I think E is incorrect.

Wait, what about lactate (B). If you eat a meal high in carbs, does that affect lactate? I'm not too sure. Normally, lactate is produced during anaerobic respiration. After a meal, especially a high-carb one, blood glucose goes up, but I don't think that directly leads to higher lactate unless you're doing something like intense exercise. So probably B isn't the right choice.

So the most obvious is C: Glucose. After breaking the fast, blood glucose increases because the body absorbs the glucose from the toast. The boiled egg has some protein, which can also affect blood sugar but not as directly as the carbs.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question involves determining which blood component is at a higher concentration after a 45-year-old man breaks his overnight fast by eating three slices of toast and a boiled egg. The key is understanding the physiological changes that occur after eating versus fasting.

- **A: Cholesterol**: Cholesterol levels are influenced by long-term dietary habits rather than a single meal, so this is unlikely to increase immediately after breakfast.  
- **B: Lactate**: Lactate levels rise during intense exercise but are not directly affected by a meal like this one.  
- **C: Glucose**: After eating, especially a meal containing carbohydrates (e.g., toast), blood glucose increases due to the absorption of glucose from the digestive tract. This is a strong candidate.  
- **D: Ketone bodies**: Ketone production decreases after eating because insulin, released in response to the meal, inhibits ketogenesis. Thus, ketone bodies would be lower, not higher.  
- **E: Glycogen**: Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles, not circulated in the blood, so it is not measured in blood samples.  
- **F: Pyruvate**: While glycolysis increases with glucose intake, pyruvate is an intermediate metabolite and not typically measured in blood as a significant marker of postprandial changes.  
- **G: Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs)**: NEFAs decrease after eating because insulin inhibits lipolysis, the breakdown of fat for energy.

The most obvious and correct answer is **C: Glucose**, as blood glucose levels rise after consuming a meal containing carbohydrates. 

Answer: C
