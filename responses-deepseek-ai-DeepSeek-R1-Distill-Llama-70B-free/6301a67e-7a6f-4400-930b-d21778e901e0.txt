Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the Coulombic barrier when bombarding Bismuth-209 with alpha particles. Hmm, okay, I remember that the Coulomb barrier is the energy barrier that charged particles need to overcome to get close enough for a nuclear reaction to happen. It's related to the repulsion between the positively charged nuclei.

Wait, Bismuth-209 has an atomic number of 83, right? Because Bismuth is element 83. And an alpha particle is helium-4, so its atomic number is 2. So when an alpha particle hits a Bi-209 nucleus, their charges will repel each other.

The formula for the Coulomb barrier, I think, is something like (Z1 * Z2 * e^2) / (4 * π * ε0 * r), where Z1 and Z2 are the atomic numbers, e is the elementary charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and r is the distance between the centers of the two nuclei.

But wait, what's r here? I remember that r is approximately the sum of the radii of the two nuclei. The radius of a nucleus can be estimated using the formula R = R0 * A^(1/3), where R0 is about 1.2 femtometers (fm), and A is the mass number.

So for Bismuth-209, the radius R_bi is 1.2 * (209)^(1/3) fm. Let me calculate that exponent. 209 is between 6^3=216, so maybe around 5.9 or 6. So approximately 1.2 * 6 = 7.2 fm.

And the alpha particle is helium-4, so its radius R_alpha is 1.2 * (4)^(1/3). 4^(1/3) is about 1.587, so 1.2 * 1.587 ≈ 1.9 fm.

So the total distance r = R_bi + R_alpha = 7.2 + 1.9 = 9.1 fm. Wait, but units are important. I need to convert this to meters because the other constants are in SI units. 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, so 9.1 fm is 9.1e-15 m.

Now plug the numbers into the formula. Z1 is 83 for Bi, Z2 is 2 for He. So Z1*Z2 = 83 * 2 = 166.

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs. So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = about 2.566e-38 C².

ε0 is 8.854e-12 F/m (farads per meter).

So putting it all together:

Coulomb barrier energy (Ec) = (Z1*Z2 * e^2) / (4 * π * ε0 * r)

Plugging in the numbers:

Ec = (166 * 2.566e-38) / (4 * π * 8.854e-12 * 9.1e-15)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 166 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 166 * 2.566 ≈ 425. So 425e-38 = 4.25e-36 C²·something.

Denominator: 4 * π ≈ 12.566. 12.566 * 8.854e-12 = let's compute that. 12.566 * 8.854 ≈ 111. So 111e-12 = 1.11e-10. Then multiply by 9.1e-15 m: 1.11e-10 * 9.1e-15 = approx 1.01e-24.

So denominator is roughly 1.01e-24.

So Ec ≈ 4.25e-36 / 1.01e-24 = (4.25 / 1.01) * 1e-12 = approx 4.2 * 1e-12 eV? Wait, wait. No, because the units would be in joules. Because the denominator has the unit of meters in the denominator? Wait, no, the denominator is 4πε0 r, which has units of (F/m * m) → F is C²/(J·m), so I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should just proceed with the calculation in terms of eV.

Wait, another approach: sometimes the Coulomb barrier is approximated using a simplified formula. I think the approximate formula is Ec (MeV) ≈ 1.44 * Z1 * Z2 / (A1^(1/3) + A2^(1/3)) ), where A is the mass number.

Wait, let me check that. I might have heard of the formula as Ec ≈ (Z1 Z2) / (A1^(1/3) + A2^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some constant.

Alternatively, another formula I've seen is Ec = (Z1 Z2 e^2)/(4π ε0 (R1 + R2)), but perhaps using the radii in terms of A^(1/3).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard value for the Coulomb barrier for alpha particles on a heavy nucleus. For example, I recall that the typical Coulomb barrier for alpha particles is around 20-30 MeV.

Wait, let me try the first approach again. Let's compute the numerator and denominator more accurately.

Numerator: Z1 * Z2 = 83 * 2 = 166.

e^2 is (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So numerator = 166 * 2.566e-38 = 425.356e-38 = 4.25356e-36 C².

Denominator: 4 * π * ε0 * r.

Compute each part:

4 * π ≈ 12.566.

ε0 = 8.854e-12 F/m.

r = 9.1e-15 m.

So denominator = 12.566 * 8.854e-12 * 9.1e-15.

Let me compute step by step:

12.566 * 8.854e-12 = Let's compute 12 * 8.854 = 106.248, 0.566 *8.854≈5.018 → total ≈106.248 +5.018=111.266 → 111.266e-12.

Then multiply by 9.1e-15: 111.266e-12 *9.1e-15 = 111.266 *9.1 * 1e-27.

111.266 *9.1: 100 *9.1=910, 11.266 *9.1≈102.5 → total ≈1012.5 → so denominator ≈1012.5e-27 = 1.0125e-24.

So Ec = 4.25356e-36 / 1.0125e-24 = (4.25356 / 1.0125) * 1e-12.

4.25356 / 1.0125 ≈4.2 (since 1.0125 *4=4.05, 1.0125*4.2=4.2655, which is a bit higher than 4.25356, so about 4.2).

So 4.2 * 1e-12 J. Now, we need to convert that to MeV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV is 1.602e-13 J.

So Ec in MeV is (4.2e-12 J) / (1.602e-13 J/MeV) ) = 4.2e-12 / 1.602e-13 ≈ 26.2 MeV.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't go up to 26. The options are around 20-23 MeV.

Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the denominator. Let me recalculate it.

Denominator: 4 * π * ε0 * r.

Compute 4 * π: ~12.566.

Multiply by ε0 (8.854e-12 F/m): 12.566 * 8.854e-12 = (12 * 8.854) = 106.248e-12, 0.566 *8.854 is about 5.018e-12. So total 106.248e-12 +5.018e-12 = 111.266e-12 = 1.11266e-10 F·m⁻¹ * m → Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is (4π ε0 r), which has units of (F/m * m) ) → F · m⁻¹ * m = F. Farads are C²/(J), so not sure about the units, but the calculation remains.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator more accurately.

12.566 * 8.854e-12 → let me compute 12.566 * 8.854.

12 * 8.854 = 106.248.

0.566 *8.854: 0.5 *8.854=4.427, 0.066 *8.854≈0.585 → total 4.427 +0.585=5.012.

So 12.566 *8.854=106.248 +5.012=111.26.

So 111.26e-12 = 1.1126e-10.

Multiply by r=9.1e-15 m:

1.1126e-10 *9.1e-15 = (1.1126 *9.1) * 1e-25.

1.1126 *9.1: 1 *9.1=9.1, 0.1126 *9.1≈1.024 → total ≈10.124.

So denominator ≈10.124e-25 = 1.0124e-24.

So denominator is 1.0124e-24.

Numerator is 4.25356e-36.

So Ec = 4.25356e-36 / 1.0124e-24 ≈ 4.2e-12 J.

Wait, 4.2e-12 J. How much is that in MeV?

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.

So 4.2e-12 J / 1.602e-13 J/MeV = (4.2 / 0.1602) → 4.2 / 0.1602 ≈26.24 MeV. Hmm, but none of the options are near 26 MeV. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong radius for the alpha particle. Wait, the alpha is a helium nucleus, but does its radius really use A=4? Or is there another approach? Maybe I should use the reduced mass or something?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the charge in units of the elementary charge. Oh wait, yeah, I think I used the correct charge because Z1 and Z2 are the atomic numbers, which account for the number of protons, each with charge e.

Wait maybe I should use a different formula for the Coulomb barrier. Another approach is that the barrier height can be approximated as Ec = (Z1 Z2 e²)/(4πε0 (R1 + R2)).

Alternatively, I've heard that sometimes the radius is taken as R = 1.5 fm for the alpha particle. Wait, but earlier I calculated R_alpha as about 1.9 fm. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the distance r in terms of the sum of the radii, but perhaps using a different R0 value. I thought R0 is about 1.2 fm, but sometimes people use 1.4 fm for the radius formula.

Wait, let me try that. If R0 is 1.4 fm, then R_bi =1.4 * (209)^(1/3). 209^(1/3) is approximately 5.9, so R_bi ≈8.26 fm. R_alpha =1.4*(4)^(1/3)=1.4*1.587≈2.22 fm. So r=8.26 +2.22=10.48 fm =10.48e-15 m.

Then denominator becomes 4π ε0 r = 12.566 *8.854e-12 *10.48e-15.

Compute 12.566 *8.854e-12 = same as before, 111.26e-12.

Multiply by 10.48e-15: 111.26e-12 *10.48e-15 = 111.26 *10.48 *1e-27.

111.26 *10.48 → 100*10.48=1048, 11.26*10.48≈117.8 → total ≈1165.8 → 1165.8e-27 = 1.1658e-24.

So denominator is 1.1658e-24.

Numerator is same as before, 4.25356e-36.

So Ec =4.25356e-36 /1.1658e-24 = approx 3.65e-12 J.

Convert to MeV: 3.65e-12 J /1.602e-13 J/MeV = 3.65 /0.1602 ≈22.78 MeV.

Hmm, that's about 22.8 MeV. Looking at the options, option A is 22.1, B is 23.3. So perhaps this is closer to 23 MeV.

But wait, I'm not sure about the R0 value. Some sources use R0=1.2 fm, others might use 1.4. Also, in some cases, the Coulomb barrier is calculated using a different approach, perhaps considering the point where the kinetic energy equals the potential energy.

Alternatively, another formula I've come across is the Coulomb barrier for an alpha particle on a nucleus with atomic number Z is approximately Ec ≈ (0.218) * Z * sqrt(A) MeV, where A is the mass number of the target. Let me try that.

Wait, for Bi-209, A=209, Z=83.

sqrt(209)= approx 14.456.

So Ec≈0.218 *83 *14.456.

Compute 83 *14.456: 80*14.456≈1156.48, 3*14.456≈43.368 → total≈1199.85.

Then 0.218 *1199.85 ≈261 MeV. Wait, that can't be right because it's way too high. So perhaps that formula is incorrect or I misremembered it.

Alternatively, another approximation is Ec (MeV) ≈ 1.5 * Z / (A^(1/3)). So Z=83, A=209. A^(1/3)≈6.

So 1.5 *83 /6 ≈ (124.5)/6 ≈20.75 MeV. That's close to option D, which is 21.2. But earlier calculation gave me around 22.8 when using R0=1.4.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a standard formula or a table, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to work with what I have.

Wait, another approach is to use the equation for the Coulomb barrier in terms of the reduced mass and the charges, but I think that's more complicated and perhaps not necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is intended, but I'm making a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me try again with R0=1.2 fm.

R_bi=1.2*(209)^(1/3). Let's compute 209^(1/3) more accurately. 5^3=125, 6^3=216. So 209 is just before 6^3. So 5.95^3: 5.95^3 = (6 -0.05)^3 = 216 - 3*(6^2)*0.05 + 3*(6)*(0.05)^2 - (0.05)^3 → 216 - 3*36*0.05 + 3*6*0.0025 - 0.000125 → 216 -5.4 +0.045 -0.000125≈210.644. So 5.95^3≈210.644, which is a bit higher than 209, so maybe 5.94^3: Let's see, 5.94^3.

Well, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approximation. Let’s approximate 209^(1/3) as about 5.94.

So R_bi=1.2 *5.94≈7.128 fm.

R_alpha=1.2*(4)^(1/3)=1.2*1.5874≈1.905 fm.

So r=7.128 +1.905=9.033 fm =9.033e-15 m.

Now compute denominator:4πε0 r.

4π=12.566.

ε0=8.8541878128e-12 F/m (exact value).

So denominator=12.566 *8.8541878128e-12 *9.033e-15.

Compute 12.566 *8.8541878128e-12 → let me calculate that:

12 *8.8541878128e-12 = 106.2502517e-12.

0.566 *8.8541878128e-12 → 0.5 *8.8541878128e-12=4.4270939064e-12, 0.066 *8.8541878128e-12≈0.58541264e-12. So total 4.4270939e-12 +0.58541264e-12=5.0125065e-12.

So total denominator part: 106.2502517e-12 +5.0125065e-12=111.2627582e-12=1.112627582e-10 F·m⁻¹.

Now multiply by r=9.033e-15 m: 1.112627582e-10 *9.033e-15 = (1.112627582 *9.033) *1e-25.

Compute 1.112627582 *9.033:

1 *9.033=9.033.

0.112627582
