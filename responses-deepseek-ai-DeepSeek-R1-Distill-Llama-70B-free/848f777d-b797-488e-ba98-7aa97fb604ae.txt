Question:

Section 2022(a) of a state's medical licensing code provides:"For the purposes of this statute, only those persons who have graduated from an optometry school located in the state and accredited by the board of optometrists shall be licensed to conduct the practice of optometry within the state. "A doctor graduated from a school of optometry located in a neighboring state. The following month, the doctor was granted a license to practice optometry in that neighboring state by its board of optometrists. For approximately one year, the doctor was engaged in the practice of optometry in the neighboring state. Subsequently, the doctor decided to relocate his practice to the state for which Section 2022(a) applies. The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice. If the doctor challenges the constitutionality of Section 2022(a) of the medical licensing statute as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following, if factually true, is the WEAKEST defense that the state could offer?

Options:

A: The statute will help to increase the number of local optometrists who can handle emergencies.
B: The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.
C: The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.
D: The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.
E: The statute will help to ensure that only optometrists who are familiar with the state's unique vision-related health issues practice in the state.
F: The statute will help to provide job security for the state's board of optometrists.
G: The statute will help to maintain the reputation of the state's optometry board.
H: The statute will help to promote the state's optometry school.
I: The statute will help to ensure that the state's optometry school graduates have priority in getting licensed.
J: The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.

Okay, so I have this question about the Commerce Clause and a state licensing statute. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about a doctor who graduated from an optometry school in a neighboring state. He got licensed there and practiced for a year before moving to another state where he wants to practice. But the new state's law, Section 2022(a), says that only graduates from in-state accredited schools can get licensed. The doctor is challenging this law under the Commerce Clause, and the question is about which defense the state offers is the weakest.

First, I remember that the Commerce Clause generally prohibits states from passing legislation that unduly burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce. So if a state law favors in-state businesses or restricts out-of-state ones without a good reason, it might be unconstitutional.

The state is defending Section 2022(a). The weakest defense would be one that's not a strong justification and perhaps doesn't meet the standards set by courts. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Helps increase local optometrists for emergencies. Hmm, that sounds like a public health concern. States often justify licensing requirements on public health grounds. So this might be a stronger defense.

Option B: Ensures optometrists are subject to standards. Wait, but if the out-of-state optometrist is already licensed elsewhere, maybe the state could argue their standards are met. But if the state's standards are higher, that's a possible defense, though maybe not the weakest.

Option C: Only the most qualified practice. That's similar to B. If the state's schools are better, but that's hard to prove. It might be a weak argument if it's just an assumption.

Option D: Protects from competition. Oh, this seems bad. States can't just protect their own businesses from competition. That would likely be an unconstitutional protectionist measure. So this would be a weak defense because it's against the Commerce Clause principles.

Option E: Familiarity with state's unique health issues. This could be a valid reason, like if the state has specific vision problems that require specialized knowledge. But if it's just a made-up reason, then it's weak. But maybe it's a plausible defense.

Option F: Job security for the board members. That doesn't make sense. Licensing is about public protection, not jobs for board members. So this is a terrible defense.

Option G: Maintain the board's reputation. Maybe, but again, it's more about the board's image than public health. Not a strong reason.

Option H: Promote the state's optometry school. That sounds like protectionism. If the law is designed to favor the in-state school, it might be seen as unfair. So this is a weak defense.

Option I: Ensure state graduates get priority. Again, this is about giving preference to in-state, which could be seen as protectionist. 

Option J: Ensure a continuous number of optometrists. Maybe a public health argument, but if the doctor is qualified, why would they need to limit? It's a bit of a stretch.

So the question is, which is the weakest. The weakest defense would be one that's clearly not a valid government interest or is based on a flawed premise.

Option D is about protecting from competition. Courts usually don't accept that as a valid reason because it's against the Commerce Clause. So if the state says they're protecting their optometrists from competition, that's a weak defense.

Option F and H are also weak. F is about job security for the board, which is irrelevant. H is promoting the school, which seems protectionist. But I think D is even weaker because it's directly about protecting competition, which is a no-go.

So the weakest defense is D.

The weakest defense the state could offer is that Section 2022(a) protects optometrists in the state from competition outside the state. This reasoning is particularly flawed because the Commerce Clause prohibits states from enacting laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce or engage in protectionist practices. Protecting in-state professionals from competition is not a valid governmental interest and would likely be deemed unconstitutional. 

Answer: D
