Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: The virus uses a different enzyme to replicate its genetic material
B: The virus has a unique replication cycle that does not involve nucleic acids
C: The virus is immune to DNAase
D: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase
E: DNAase selectively only attacks bacterial DNA
F: The virus's genetic material is composed of proteins, not nucleic acids
G: The virus rapidly mutates to resist the effects of DNAase
H: The RNA in the virus is transformed into DNA
I: The virus has a protective shell against DNAase
J: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor proteins

Okay, so I have this question here about DNAase and its effect on bacterial cells versus RNA viruses. Hmm, I need to figure out why adding DNAase to a bacterial cell kills it, but when added to RNA viruses, they can still produce proteins. Let me think.

First, I remember that DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So if you add it to a bacterial cell, it would hydrolyze their DNA. Without DNA, the bacteria can't make proteins because DNA is necessary for transcription and translation. So the bacteria dies because it can't produce proteins anymore.

But RNA viruses are different. When DNAase is added to them, they continue to make proteins. Why is that? Well, RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic material, not DNA. Oh wait, DNAase specifically targets DNA, right? So if the virus's genetic material is RNA, then DNAase wouldn't affect it. That makes sense because DNAase can't break down RNA. So the virus's RNA remains intact, allowing it to produce proteins.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the virus uses a different enzyme to replicate. That might be true, but that's not why DNAase doesn't affect them. It's more about the type of genetic material.

Option B suggests the replication doesn't involve nucleic acids, which doesn't make sense because viruses rely on nucleic acids for their replication.

Option C claims the virus is immune. Well, it's not immune; it's just that DNAase doesn't act on RNA.

Option D states the virus contains RNA, so DNAase doesn't affect it. That aligns with what I was thinking. RNA isn't broken down by DNAase.

Option E says DNAase only attacks bacterial DNA. That's not the case. DNAase breaks down any DNA, but if the virus doesn't have DNA, it won't be affected.

Option F says the virus's genetic material is protein. No, viruses have either DNA or RNA, not proteins as genetic material.

Option G is about mutating to resist. That's unrelated because the question is about the immediate effect, not long-term adaptation.

Option H suggests RNA transforming into DNA. That's not relevant here. The virus has RNA, and DNAase doesn't affect it.

Option I says the virus has a protective shell. Well, maybe some viruses have capsids, but DNAase specifically targets DNA, so if the virus doesn't have DNA, the shell isn't the main reason here.

Option J says the virus has inhibitors for DNAase. That could be a possibility, but I don't think RNA viruses carry such inhibitors. Their defense is more about their genetic material type.

So the correct answer should be D. Because the virus contains RNA, DNAase doesn't affect its genetic material, allowing it to continue producing proteins.

The question asks why DNAase affects bacterial cells differently than RNA viruses. DNAase breaks down DNA, so when added to bacterial cells, it hydrolyzes their DNA, preventing protein synthesis and leading to cell death. RNA viruses, however, are unaffected because their genetic material is RNA, not DNA. DNAase specifically targets DNA and has no effect on RNA, allowing the virus to continue producing proteins. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because the virus's replication enzyme is irrelevant here; the key factor is the type of genetic material.
- **B** is incorrect because viral replication involves nucleic acids.
- **C** is incorrect because immunity is not the reason; RNA is simply unaffected by DNAase.
- **D** is correct because RNA viruses' genetic material is RNA, which DNAase cannot hydrolyze.
- **E** is incorrect because DNAase breaks down any DNA, not just bacterial DNA.
- **F** is incorrect because viral genetic material is nucleic acids, not proteins.
- **G** is incorrect because mutation is unrelated to the immediate effect of DNAase.
- **H** is incorrect because RNA transforming into DNA is not relevant.
- **I** is incorrect because the protective shell is not the main reason here.
- **J** is incorrect because RNA viruses do not typically produce DNAase inhibitors.

The correct answer is **D**, as RNA viruses are unaffected by DNAase due to their RNA genetic material.

Answer: D
