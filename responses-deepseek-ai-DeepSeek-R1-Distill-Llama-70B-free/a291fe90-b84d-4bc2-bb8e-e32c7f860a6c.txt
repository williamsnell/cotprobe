Question:

One day, while visiting a plastic surgery clinic for a routine Botox treatment, a patient received an excessive dose of Botox from a new medical assistant on the staff. Her face frozen in a grotesque grimace, she demanded to speak to the doctor. The doctor said, "Listen, why don't you go over to the emergency room and send the bills to me? I'll take care of your medical expenses. " The patient subsequently sued the doctor for negligent hiring of the medical assistant and for damages. At trial, she proposes to call the doctor's administrative assistant, who was present during her conversation with the doctor. The patient wants the administrative assistant to testify to the doctor's offer to pay her medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects. The trial judge should

Options:

A: sustain the objection, as the administrative assistant is not qualified to testify on medical matters.
B: sustain the objection as an offer to pay the medical bills.
C: sustain the objection, as the conversation between the doctor and patient should be kept confidential.
D: overrule the objection, as the patient has a right to call any witness to support her case.
E: overrule the objection, as the testimony could provide context to the incident.
F: overrule the objection, as the administrative assistant's testimony could shed light on the doctor's character and integrity.
G: overrule the objection, because an offer to pay medical bills is an inferential admission.
H: overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring.
I: sustain the objection, because the patient's medical records are the best evidence of the doctor's negligence.
J: sustain the objection, as the doctor's offer does not directly imply guilt or negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let's see. The scenario is about a patient suing a doctor for negligent hiring after a Botox mishap. The doctor offered to pay her medical bills, and now the patient wants the administrative assistant who was present to testify about that offer.

Hmm, the issue is whether the administrative assistant can testify about the doctor's offer to pay the medical bills. The doctor's attorney is objecting, and the trial judge has to decide.

I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, certain statements are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule. One such exception is for admissions by a party-opponent. An admission is a statement that would ordinarily be hearsay, but it's admissible if it's offered against the party who made it.

So the doctor's offer to pay medical bills could be considered an admission. Why? Because by offering to pay, the doctor might be implicitly admitting some fault. Admissions are non-hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2), so they don't get excluded on hearsay grounds.

Looking at the options:

A: Sustain because the assistant isn't qualified on medical matters. But the testimony is about the offer, not medical expertise. So this shouldn't matter. A is probably wrong.

B: Sustain because it's an offer to pay bills. Wait, offers to pay medical expenses are generally inadmissible to prove liability because of public policy encouraging settlement. FRE 409 says that evidence of offering to pay medical expenses isn't admissible to prove liability. So the doctor's offer can't be used as evidence of negligence. So B might be a reason to sustain.

C: Confidentiality. The conversation was between doctor and patient, but the offer to pay bills isn't protected by physician-patient privilege because it's about payment, not treatment. So C doesn't apply.

D: Overrule because the patient can call any witness. That's not correct because even if the witness is called, the evidence might be inadmissible for other reasons.

E: Testimony provides context. Maybe, but if it's barred by 409, then context doesn't matter.

F: Sheds light on character. Not really, because it's about the doctor's actions, not his character for liability.

G: Offer as inferential admission. Wait, under 801(d)(2), admissions are non-hearsay. But under 409, offers to pay medical bills are inadmissible. So G might say it's an admission, but 409 could override that.

H: Relevant to negligent hiring. Maybe so, but again, if 409 excludes it, then it's not admissible.

I: Best evidence rule. The issue is about what the doctor said, so the best evidence would be the testimony itself, not medical records. So I is irrelevant.

J: Offer doesn't imply guilt. That's a factual determination, but the rule under 409 is more about policy, not whether it implies guilt.

So putting it together. The doctor's offer to pay is an admission but is specifically made inadmissible by FRE 409. So the objection should be sustained because the evidence is barred.

Looking back at the options, option B says to sustain the objection as an offer to pay medical bills. That aligns with FRE 409.

Wait, but wait, under FRE 409, it's not just offers, but also payments. And it's inadmissible to prove liability. So the doctor's offer can't be used as evidence that he was negligent. Therefore, the administrative assistant's testimony about the offer should be excluded.

So the correct answer would be B: sustain the objection as an offer to pay the medical bills.

The question revolves around whether the administrative assistant can testify about the doctor's offer to pay the patient's medical bills. The key issue is the admissibility of this statement under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE).

The doctor's offer to pay medical bills could be considered an admission by a party-opponent under FRE 801(d)(2), which makes such statements admissible as non-hearsay. However, FRE 409 explicitly bars evidence of offering or paying medical expenses from being used to prove liability. This rule is based on public policy to encourage settlements without fear of such offers being used against the party in court.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because the testimony concerns the offer, not medical expertise.
- **B** is correct because FRE 409 prohibits using offers to pay medical bills as evidence of liability.
- **C** is incorrect because the conversation is not protected by physician-patient privilege.
- **D** is incorrect because the patient's right to call a witness does not override evidentiary rules.
- **E, F, G, H** are incorrect because they do not address the specific bar under FRE 409.
- **I** is irrelevant as the best evidence rule does not apply here.
- **J** is incorrect because the issue is not whether the offer implies guilt but whether it is admissible under FRE 409.

Thus, the trial judge should sustain the objection because the evidence is barred by FRE 409.
