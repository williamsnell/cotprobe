Okay, so Marguerite has been taking spelling tests, and her previous scores were all between 75 and 89. Now she got a 100 on her next test. The question is asking which of the given statements is true after this new score is added.

Hmm, let me think about each of the options one by one. The options are about how different statistical measures (median, mode, mean, range) change with the addition of this new score.

First, I remember that the mean is the average of all the numbers. If she adds a score higher than her previous ones, the average should go up. So the mean will increase. That would make option D correct. Wait, but I need to check all options to be sure.

What about the median? The median is the middle value when the numbers are ordered. If all previous tests were between 75-89, adding a 100 which is higher than all of them would probably affect the median. Let's say she had an odd number of tests before. Adding another makes it even. But since the new score is the highest, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. If those two were in the 75-89 range, the median might increase, but if previously the median was lower, it could go up. Wait, but if all previous were between 75-89, the median before must have been somewhere in that range. Adding a 100 would make the median maybe increase but not decrease. So option C says the median remains the same, which might be true only if the new data point doesn't change the middle value, but I'm not sure. I'll have to think more about that.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently. But she's only adding one more score, which is 100. If all her previous tests were different (each between 75-89), adding a 100 wouldn't create a new mode. So the mode might not change, or if there was no mode before, still no mode. So options B and H, which talk about the mode decreasing or increasing, probably aren't correct. So I can eliminate B and H.

The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores. Before, her lowest was 75, highest 89. So the range was 14 (89-75). Now, the highest is 100, so the range becomes 25 (100-75). That means the range increases, so option E, which says the range will decrease, is incorrect.

So, looking back:

Option D: The mean will increase. That seems correct because adding a higher score than before would pull the average up.

What about the median? Let's think in more detail. Suppose she had n tests before. Let's say she had 5 tests, all between 75 and 89. The median would be the third score. Adding a 6th test (100) would make the median the average of the third and fourth tests. If those two were both in the 75-89 range, their average would still be in that range, but higher than the previous median only if the third and fourth are above the previous median. Wait, actually, it depends on the original data. But without specific numbers, I can't be certain. But since the new score is higher, the median can't decrease, so option A is incorrect. Option C says the median remains the same. Hmm, maybe it's possible if the new data doesn't change the middle values. But I'm not entirely sure. However, the mean is definitely increasing, so D is correct. 

So the correct answer should be D: The mean will increase.

The addition of Marguerite's new score of 100 affects the statistical measures as follows:

- **Mean**: Since the new score (100) is higher than her previous scores (75-89), the mean will increase. This makes option D correct.
- **Median**: The median is the middle value of an ordered dataset. Adding a higher score (100) could potentially increase the median, but it might also remain the same depending on the original data distribution. However, it will not decrease, so option A is incorrect. Option C, which states the median remains the same, is uncertain without specific data but is less likely than the mean increasing.
- **Mode**: The mode is the most frequent score. Since Marguerite only added one score (100), it does not affect the mode. Thus, options B and H are incorrect.
- **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores. Previously, the range was 14 (89-75). With the new score of 100, the range increases to 25 (100-75). Therefore, option E, which claims the range will decrease, is incorrect.

The most definitive and correct statement is that the mean will increase.
