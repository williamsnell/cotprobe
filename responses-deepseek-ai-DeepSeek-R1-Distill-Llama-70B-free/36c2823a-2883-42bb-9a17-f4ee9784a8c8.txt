Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find out how many ways 3 students can be selected from a class of 20 to form a study group. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

First off, when the question is about selecting a group where the order doesn't matter, like a study group, I remember that's a combination problem. Because if it were about arranging them in order, like choosing a president, vice-president, and treasurer, that would be a permutation. But here, it's just a group, so combinations are the way to go.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number you're choosing. So in this case, n is 20 and k is 3.

Let me plug those numbers into the formula. So it's 20! divided by (3! times (20-3)! ), which simplifies to 20! / (3! * 17! ). Wait, but 20! is a huge number, but I remember that factorials can be simplified when they're in ratios like this.

Since 20! is 20 × 19 × 18 × 17! , the 17! in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out. So I'm left with (20 × 19 × 18) / (3! ). 3! is 3 × 2 × 1, which is 6.

So putting that together, it's (20 × 19 × 18) / 6. Let me calculate that step by step. 20 multiplied by 19 is 380, and 380 multiplied by 18 is... wait, 380 × 18. Let me compute that. 380 × 10 is 3800, 380 ×8 is 3040, so 3800+3040=6840. So 20×19×18 is 6840, and then divide by 6.

So 6840 divided by 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 6840 how many times? Well, 6 × 1000 is 6000, so 6840 minus 6000 is 840. 6 × 140 is 840, so total is 1000 + 140 = 1140. So 6840/6 is 1140.

So the number of ways is 1140. Looking at the options, option B is 1140. So the answer should be B.

To determine the number of ways to select 3 students from a class of 20, we use combinations since the order of selection does not matter. The formula for combinations is:

\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n - k)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 20 \) and \( k = 3 \). Substituting these values:

\[
C(20, 3) = \frac{20!}{3! \cdot (20 - 3)!} = \frac{20!}{3! \cdot 17!}
\]

Simplifying further, \( 20! = 20 \times 19 \times 18 \times 17! \), so the \( 17! \) terms cancel out:

\[
C(20, 3) = \frac{20 \times 19 \times 18}{3!}
\]

Since \( 3! = 6 \), we calculate:

\[
C(20, 3) = \frac{20 \times 19 \times 18}{6} = \frac{6840}{6} = 1140
\]

Thus, the number of ways to select 3 students from 20 is **1140**, which corresponds to option **B**.
