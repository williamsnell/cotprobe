Okay, so I've got this economics question about externalities, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about when a negative externality exists in the market for a good. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that externalities have to do with spillover effects that affect third parties. Negative externalities specifically involve costs that the producer doesn't have to pay for. Like when a factory pollutes, and the surrounding community suffers the consequences without compensation.

Wait, the question is about when a negative externality exists. So I need to think about what conditions define a negative externality.

In a market without externalities, the marginal social cost (MSC) equals the marginal private cost (MPC) because there are no spillovers. But when there's a negative externality, the producer doesn't bear all the costs. So the MSC is higher than the MPC because some costs are borne by others.

When a market has a negative externality, the supply curve (which is based on private costs) doesn't reflect the true social costs. This leads the market to produce more than the socially optimal quantity, right? Because the producer isn't accounting for all the costs, so they produce until the marginal private benefit equals the marginal private cost, which is lower than the marginal social cost.

So looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this scenario.

Option A: Spillover benefits. That's a positive externality, I think. So not this one.

Option B: Total welfare maximized. No, with a negative externality, welfare isn't maximized because the market equilibrium is at a quantity where MSC > MPC, so overproduction occurs. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost. That's the condition for allocative efficiency, which doesn't happen with an externality. So C is wrong.

Option D: Marginal private benefit equals marginal social cost. Hmm, normally the market equilibrium is where marginal private benefit (which is demand) equals marginal private cost. So if D says MPB equals MSC, that would imply that the market is accounting for the social costs, which isn't the case with a negative externality. So D isn't correct.

Option E: No spillover benefits or costs. That's when there's no externality at all. So E is wrong because the question is about when negative externalities exist.

Option F: Market overallocates resources. Yes, I think this is correct. Because negative externalities lead to overproduction. The market produces more than the socially optimal level. So F might be the right answer.

Option G: Total welfare is minimized. I don't think that's necessarily true. Welfare isn't zero, but it's not maximized. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Market underallocates resources. That's the opposite of what happens with negative externalities. Negative externalities cause overproduction, so H is wrong.

Option I: Spillover costs are absorbed by the producer. No, with negative externalities, the producer doesn't absorb these costs; instead, society does. So I is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. Negative externality means the producer's actions impose costs on others. So the producer doesn't pay for those costs, leading to a higher quantity produced than what's socially optimal. So the market overallocates resources because they don't factor in the extra costs. So F says the market overallocates, which fits.

So the correct answer should be F.

A negative externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good imposes costs on third parties who are not compensated for those costs. In such cases, the marginal social cost (MSC) exceeds the marginal private cost (MPC) because the producer does not bear the full cost of production. This leads to overproduction, as the market equilibrium is determined by the intersection of marginal private benefit (MPB) and MPC, while the socially optimal quantity would be where MPB equals MSC. Among the options provided:

- **A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I** do not correctly describe the conditions of a negative externality.
- **F** correctly identifies that the market overallocates resources to the production of the good when a negative externality exists.

Thus, the correct answer is **F**.

Answer: F
