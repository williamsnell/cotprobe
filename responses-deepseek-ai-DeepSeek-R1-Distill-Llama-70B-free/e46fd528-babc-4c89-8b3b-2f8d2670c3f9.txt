Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a worker on an assembly line who takes 7 hours to produce 22 parts. We need to find out how many parts she can make in 35 hours at the same rate.

Hmm, I think I should start by finding her production rate, like how many parts she makes per hour. Right, because if we know that, then we can just multiply by the total hours to get the total parts.

So, she makes 22 parts in 7 hours. To get the rate per hour, I guess I should divide the number of parts by the time. That makes sense. So 22 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 22 ÷ 7 is approximately 3.142857 parts per hour. Wait, that's a repeating decimal. Maybe I can keep it as a fraction. 22/7 is actually a well-known fraction, often used to approximate pi, but here it's exact. So her rate is 22/7 parts each hour.

Now, the question is asking for 35 hours of work. So I need to multiply her hourly rate by 35. That would be (22/7) * 35. Let me think about this calculation. 35 divided by 7 is 5, right? So 22 times 5. 22 * 5 is 110. Oh wait, that's much simpler. So she can produce 110 parts in 35 hours.

Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If 7 hours make 22 parts, then in one hour she makes 22/7. So in 35 hours, which is 5 times 7, she'd make 5 times 22, which is 110. Yep, that adds up.

Looking at the options, option A is 110 parts. That must be the correct answer.

The worker's production rate is calculated by dividing the number of parts by the time taken:  
22 parts ÷ 7 hours = 22/7 parts per hour.  

To find the total number of parts produced in 35 hours, multiply the hourly rate by 35:  
(22/7) × 35 = 22 × 5 = 110 parts.  

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 110 parts**.
