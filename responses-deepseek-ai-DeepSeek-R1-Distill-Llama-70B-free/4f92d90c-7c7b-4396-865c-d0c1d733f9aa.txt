Okay, so I have this question about E. coli cells and calculating the number of H+ ions in one cell. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem states that an E. coli cell is cylindrical. The dimensions are given: 1.0 micrometer in diameter and 2.0 micrometers long. So I need to find the volume of this cylinder, right? Oh wait, but wait, the cell is 80% water. Oh, that's important. So the volume of water inside the cell is 80% of the total volume.

Calculating the volume of a cylinder is straightforward. The formula is πr²h. The diameter is 1.0 μm, so the radius is half of that, which is 0.5 μm. The length (height) is 2.0 μm. Let me compute that.

Wait, but micrometers are 1e-6 meters, so I need to convert that to meters to get the volume in cubic meters, but wait, maybe it's easier to work in liters because pH calculations use molarity, which is moles per liter. Oh wait, 1 liter is 1 cubic decimeter, which is 1e3 cubic milliliters, and 1 milliliter is (1e-3 m)^3 which is 1e-9 m³. Alternatively, since 1 μm is 1e-6 meters, 1 μm³ is (1e-6)^3 = 1e-18 m³, which is 1e-18 liters? Wait, no. Wait, 1 liter is 1 dm³, which is (10 cm)^3 = 1e3 cm³. 1 cm is 1e-2 meters, so 1 cm³ is (1e-2)^3 = 1e-6 m³. So 1 liter is 1e3 cm³, which is 1e3 * 1e-6 m³ = 1e-3 m³. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to convert micrometers to meters.

Wait, let's compute the volume in μm³ first. The radius is 0.5 μm, so radius squared is 0.25 μm². Multiply by π, that's π*0.25, and then multiply by the height of 2 μm. So Volume = π * (0.5)^2 * 2 = π*(0.25)*2 = π * 0.5 ≈ 1.5708 μm³. But wait, wait, the cell is cylindrical, so the actual volume is the cylindrical volume. So that's correct, the volume is approximately 1.57 μm³.

But since the cell is 80% water, the volume of water is 0.8 * 1.57 ≈ 1.256 μm³. Okay, so the water volume is about 1.256 μm³.

Now, pH is given as 6.4. pH is the negative logarithm of the H+ concentration. So pH = -log[H+]. So [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-6.4). Let me compute that. 10^-6 is 1e-6, and 10^-0.4 is about 0.398. So 1e-6 * 0.398 is approximately 3.98e-7 M. Molarity is moles per liter.

So the H+ concentration is roughly 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Now, I need to find the number of H+ ions in the water volume of the cell. So I have the concentration in mol/L, and the volume in liters. Let me convert the water volume from μm³ to liters.

One μm is 1e-6 meters, so one μm³ is (1e-6 m)^3 = 1e-18 m³. Since 1 m³ is 1e3 liters (because 1 m³ = 1000 liters), so 1 μm³ is 1e-18 m³ * (1e3 L / 1 m³) ) = 1e-15 L.

So the water volume is 1.256 μm³ = 1.256e-15 L.

Now, the number of moles of H+ is [H+] * volume. So that's 3.98e-7 mol/L * 1.256e-15 L = let's compute that.

3.98e-7 * 1.256e-15 = (3.98 * 1.256) * 1e-22. Let's compute 3.98 * 1.256. 3 * 1.256 is 3.768, and 0.98 * 1.256 is about 1.230. So total is about 3.768 + 1.230 = 4.998. So approximately 5e-22 moles.

But wait, I need the number of ions. So moles to number of molecules is Avogadro's number, which is approx 6.022e23 molecules per mole. So number of H+ ions is 5e-22 moles * 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

That's 5 *6.022 *1e1 = 5 *6.022 *10 = 30.11 *10 = 301.1. Approximately 300 H+ ions.

Looking at the options, option E is 302 H+ ions, which is very close to my calculation. So I think E is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Volume calculation: cylinder volume correct? Yes, πr²h. r=0.5, h=2. So 0.25π * 2 = 0.5π ≈1.57 μm³. Correct.

2. Water volume: 80% of 1.57 is about 1.256 μm³. Correct.

3. pH to [H+]: pH 6.4 → [H+] = 1e-6.4 ≈ 3.98e-7. Correct.

4. Convert μm³ to liters: 1 μm³ is 1e-15 L. So 1.256e-15 L. Correct.

5. Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 * 1.256e-15 → approx 5e-22. Correct.

6. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 5e-22 *6e23 → 3e2 (300). Closest is option E:302.

So yes, the answer should be E.

To calculate the number of \( H^+ \) ions in a single E. coli cell, we proceed as follows:

1. **Volume of the cell**:  
   The cell is cylindrical with a diameter of \( 1.0 \, \mu m \) (radius \( r = 0.5 \, \mu m \)) and a length of \( 2.0 \, \mu m \). The volume of a cylinder is given by:  
   \[
   V_{\text{cell}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (0.5)^2 (2) = \pi (0.25)(2) = 0.5 \pi \, \mu m^3 \approx 1.57 \, \mu m^3
   \]

2. **Water volume**:  
   Since the cell is 80% water, the water volume is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{water}} = 0.8 \cdot V_{\text{cell}} = 0.8 \cdot 1.57 \, \mu m^3 \approx 1.256 \, \mu m^3
   \]

3. **Convert water volume to liters**:  
   \( 1 \, \mu m^3 = 10^{-15} \, L \), so:  
   \[
   V_{\text{water}} = 1.256 \, \mu m^3 = 1.256 \times 10^{-15} \, L
   \]

4. **Hydrogen ion concentration**:  
   The intracellular pH is 6.4. Using the formula \( [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} \):  
   \[
   [H^+] = 10^{-6.4} \approx 3.98 \times 10^{-7} \, M
   \]

5. **Moles of \( H^+ \) ions**:  
   The number of moles of \( H^+ \) ions is:  
   \[
   n_{H^+} = [H^+] \cdot V_{\text{water}} = (3.98 \times 10^{-7}) \cdot (1.256 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 5.00 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{mol}
   \]

6. **Number of \( H^+ \) ions**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \)):  
   \[
   N_{H^+} = n_{H^+} \cdot N_A = (5.00 \times 10^{-22}) \cdot (6.022 \times 10^{23}) \approx 301 \, \text{ions}
   \]

The closest option to the calculated value is **302 \( H^+ \) ions**.
