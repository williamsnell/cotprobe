Okay, so I have this problem to solve about finding the pH of a sodium cyanide solution. Hmm, I remember that sodium cyanide is a salt that comes from a weak acid. Let me think. Cyanide is the conjugate base of HCN, right? Because HCN is a weak acid, so when NaCN dissolves in water, it will dissociate into Na+ and CN^- ions. And since CN^- is a weak base, it will react with water to form HCn and OH^-.

Wait, but the question gives me the K_a for HCN. Oh right, because Kw is given as 1e-14, and K_a is 4e-10. So I need to find the pH of 1.0 M NaCN solution.

First, I remember that for a salt like NaCN which is the sodium salt of a weak acid, the solution will be basic. Because the CN^- ion will hydrolyze in water. So the pH should be greater than 7, maybe around 9-12 or so.

I think the steps involve finding the Kb for CN^- first. Oh wait, right, because I can use the relationship between K_a and K_b. The formula is K_a * K_b = K_w. So I can calculate Kb as Kw / Ka.

So let me plug in the numbers. K_w is 1e-14, and K_a is 4e-10. So Kb = (1e-14) / (4e-10) = 2.5e-5. Oh wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. 1e-14 divided by 4e-10 is (1/4) * 1e-14+10 = 0.25e-4, which is 2.5e-5. Yep, that's correct.

Now, knowing Kb, I can set up the hydrolysis equation for CN^- in water. The reaction is CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-. The initial concentration of CN^- is 1.0 M because NaCN is a strong electrolyte and it dissociates completely. So the initial concentrations are [CN^-] = 1.0 M, [HCN] = 0, [OH^-] = 0.

As the reaction proceeds, x amount of CN^- will react to form x of HCN and x of OH^-. So at equilibrium, the concentrations are [CN^-] = 1.0 - x, [HCN] = x, [OH^-] = x.

The Kb expression is (x^2)/(1.0 - x). So Kb = x²/(1 - x) = 2.5e-5.

Hmm, solving this equation for x. Since Kb is small, I can assume that x is much smaller than 1.0, so 1 - x ≈ 1. So the equation simplifies to x² ≈ 2.5e-5 * 1. So x² ≈ 2.5e-5, which means x is sqrt(2.5e-5). Let me compute that.

The square root of 2.5e-5: Well, sqrt(2.5) is about 1.581, and sqrt(1e-5) is 1e-2.5, which is 1e-2.5 = 3.16e-3. So 1.581 * 3.16e-3 ≈ 5e-3. Let me calculate it more accurately. 2.5e-5 is 25e-6. Square root of 25 is 5, square root of 1e-6 is 1e-3, so 5e-3. So x is 5e-3 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me actually compute sqrt(2.5e-5). 2.5e-5 is 0.000025. The square root of 0.000025 is 0.005, because 0.005 squared is 0.000025. Right, so x is 0.005 M. So [OH^-] is 0.005 M.

Now, to find the pOH, I take the negative log of [OH^-]. So pOH = -log(0.005). Hmm, 0.005 is 5e-3, which is 5 x 10^-3. The log of 5 is about 0.7, so log(5e-3) is 0.7 -3 = -2.3. So pOH is 2.3. Therefore, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 2.3 = 11.7.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake with logs. Let me compute log(0.005) more accurately. Let's think, 0.005 is 5 x 10^-3. Log(5)=0.69897. Log(5e-3)= log(5)+ log(1e-3)= 0.69897 -3= -2.30103. So pOH is 2.30103. pH is 14 - 2.30103 = 11.69897, which is approximately 11.70.

Looking at the options, option H is 11.70, so that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the assumption. I assumed that x is negligible compared to 1.0 M, which is valid because 0.005 is much less than 1. So the approximation holds.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let's make sure that the Kb calculation was correct. K_a is 4e-10, so Kb = 1e-14 / 4e-10. 1e-14 divided by 4e-10 is (1/4)*1e-4, which is 0.25e-4 or 2.5e-5. Yes, correct.

And the setup of the equation is correct. So the steps are right, and the answer should be H: 11.70.

To determine the pH of a 1.0 M NaCN solution, we start by recognizing that NaCN is the salt of a weak acid (HCN) and a strong base (NaOH). When dissolved in water, CN⁻, the conjugate base of HCN, hydrolyzes according to the reaction:

\[
\text{CN}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{HCN} + \text{OH}^-
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \( K_b \), which can be calculated using the relationship:

\[
K_a \cdot K_b = K_w
\]

Given \( K_a = 4.0 \times 10^{-10} \) and \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \), we find:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{4.0 \times 10^{-10}} = 2.5 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Next, we set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis of CN⁻:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[CN^-]}
\]

Let the initial concentration of CN⁻ be 1.0 M. At equilibrium, let \( x \) represent the concentration of OH⁻ produced. Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{1.0 - x}
\]

Since \( K_b \) is small, we assume \( x \ll 1.0 \), so \( 1.0 - x \approx 1.0 \). The equation simplifies to:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 1.0 = 2.5 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Solving for \( x \), we find:

\[
x = \sqrt{2.5 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the equilibrium concentration of OH⁻ is \( [OH^-] = 5.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \). The pOH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(5.0 \times 10^{-3}) = 2.30
\]

Finally, the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 2.30 = 11.70
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 11.70**
