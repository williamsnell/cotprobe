Question:

Law enforcement authorities had probable cause to suspect a man of murder. Without an arrest warrant, they went to his home to arrest him. They knocked and announced, and hearing no response, forcibly broke open the door and entered the house. They didn't find anyone but seized a handgun that was in plain view. The suspect was later arrested for murder; he filed for suppression of the gun. Will the suppression court throw out the gun?

Options:

A: Yes, the entry was a violation of the knock and announce rule.
B: No, the entry did not require an arrest warrant because the authorities already had established probable cause.
C: Yes, the police must obtain an arrest warrant to enter someone's home for an arrest.
D: No, the police did not need a warrant because the gun was in plain view.
E: Yes, the police needed both a search warrant for the gun and an arrest warrant for the suspect.
F: No, because the suspect was not home at the time of entry, no warrant was needed.
G: Yes, the police violated the suspect's right to privacy by forcibly entering his home.
H: Yes, the police needed a search warrant in addition to an arrest warrant to seize the gun.
I: No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.
J: No, the police were in the right because they announced their presence before entering.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about whether a court will suppress a handgun seized during an arrest. 

So the situation is: Law enforcement had probable cause to suspect a man of murder. They went to his home without an arrest warrant, knocked and announced, heard no response, then forced entry. They didn't find anyone but seized a gun in plain view. The suspect was later arrested and is now trying to suppress the gun as evidence.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, arrests in a home usually require an arrest warrant or exigent circumstances. There's also the knock-and-announce rule, which requires police to announce their presence and purpose before entering, but there are exceptions.

Wait, the police didn't have an arrest warrant here. They went to his home to arrest him. So the key issues are whether they needed an arrest warrant and whether the seizure of the gun was legal without one.

In general, to make a warrantless arrest in a home, there must be exigent circumstances. Payton v. New York established that an arrest warrant is usually required to enter a home to arrest someone. But if there are exigent circumstances, like fear of destruction of evidence or danger, then they can enter without a warrant.

In this case, the police had probable cause but no warrant. They knocked and announced, got no response, then forced entry. Once inside, they found no one but took the gun that was in plain view.

Wait, but the suspect wasn't home. So the police entered his home, didn't find him, but seized a gun. So the question is whether the entry was lawful without an arrest warrant and whether the gun can be seized.

So, without an arrest warrant, entering the home would typically require exigent circumstances. Did they have any here? The question doesn't say, so maybe I have to assume they didn't state any. But wait, maybe the fact that they were there to arrest a murder suspect creates exigency? Or maybe because the suspect could be dangerous, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the plain view doctrine applies. If an officer is lawfully present, they can seize evidence in plain view. But were they lawfully present in the home without a warrant?

So, if their entry was unlawful, then the plain view seizure wouldn't be valid. If the entry was lawful under exigent circumstances, then the seizure is okay.

But the question doesn't mention any exigent circumstances. So without an arrest warrant, the entry would be illegal unless there were such circumstances. So if they entered without a warrant and without exigency, the entry is illegal, making the seizure of the gun inadmissible.

Wait, but another angle: the police had probable cause for the arrest. But a warrantless arrest in a home requires both probable cause and exigent circumstances. So just having probable cause isn't enough.

In the scenario, after knocking and announcing and getting no response, they broke in. But if there's no one there, maybe they can't arrest anyone, so why did they enter? They were looking for the suspect but didn't find him. However, while inside, they saw the gun.

But since they didn't have a search warrant either, and they were there to arrest, can they seize the gun under the plain view doctrine?

Wait, the plain view doctrine requires that the officer is lawfully present, the incriminating nature is immediately apparent, and the officer has lawful access to the object itself.

So if their entry into the home was unlawful (because no warrant and no exigent circumstances), then their presence inside is unlawful, so the gun can't be seized under plain view. But if their entry was lawful, then the gun is admissible.

So the key is whether the entry was lawful. Since they didn't have an arrest warrant, and the question doesn't mention exigent circumstances, the entry was likely unlawful.

Wait, but the police announced themselves and got no response. Maybe they had a reasonable belief that the suspect was inside, which could create exigent circumstances? Or maybe the fact that the suspect was a murder suspect makes it exigent because of potential danger.

Alternatively, maybe the absence of the suspect means they didn't have exigent circumstances. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Yes, knock and announce was violated. But they did knock and announce, so this isn't correct.

Option B: No, because they had probable cause. But probable cause alone isn't enough; they need a warrant or exigent circumstances.

Option C: Yes, must have an arrest warrant. But if there were exigent circumstances, maybe not. Since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the default is that they need a warrant.

Option D: No, because the gun was in plain view. But plain view requires lawful presence, which they might not have had.

Option E: Yes, need both warrants. But police can sometimes seize evidence without a search warrant if it's in plain view during a lawful arrest.

Option F: No, because suspect wasn't home. So no warrant needed. But the issue is the entry into the home without a warrant, regardless of whether the suspect was there.

Option G: Yes, violated privacy by entering home. That might be the case if the entry was unlawful.

Option H: Yes, needed a search warrant. But plain view doesn't require a search warrant if they're lawfully present.

Option I: No, because of exigent circumstances and plain view. But unless the circumstances are given, we can't assume.

Option J: No, because they announced. But announcing doesn't solve the warrant issue.

Wait, in the case where the suspect isn't home, can the police enter without a warrant? Or does the warrantless entry require the suspect to be present?

I think that if they have probable cause and exigent circumstances, they can enter even if the suspect isn't there, but in this case, the question doesn't mention any such circumstances.

So, without an arrest warrant and without exigent circumstances, the entry was illegal. Therefore, the gun, which was in plain view, would be suppressed because the police were not lawfully present.

Wait, but the police had probable cause. But probable cause without a warrant isn't enough for entering a home to arrest. So the entry was illegal. Thus, the seizure of the gun is illegal.

So the suppression court would throw out the gun.

Looking at the options, which one says that the entry required an arrest warrant.

Option C says yes, police must obtain an arrest warrant. So the entry violated that, so the gun is suppressed. But wait, another angle: if the police were there to make an arrest, which requires a warrant unless exigent circumstances. They didn't have a warrant, so unless there were exigent circumstances, the entry was illegal, making the seizure invalid.

If the court finds the entry unlawful, the gun is suppressed.

Looking at the options, option C says the police must obtain an arrest warrant. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait another point: the police didn't find the suspect, but seized the gun. So maybe the issue is whether the seizure was proper under the plain view doctrine regardless of the arrest.

Alternatively, perhaps since the police entered unlawfully, any evidence found is inadmissible.

So I think the correct answer is C: Yes, the police must obtain an arrest warrant to enter someone's home for an arrest.

But wait, another option is option I: No, because of exigent circumstances. But the question doesn't state any. So I think option C is the right choice.

Wait, no, because option C is about needing an arrest warrant, and the entry was without one. So the court would throw out the gun, meaning the suppression is granted.

So the answer is C.

The question revolves around whether the suppression court will throw out the gun seized during a warrantless entry into the suspect's home. The police had probable cause to arrest the suspect for murder but did not obtain an arrest warrant. They knocked and announced, received no response, forcibly entered the home, and seized a handgun in plain view. The key issues are whether the entry was lawful and whether the seizure of the gun was valid under the plain view doctrine.

Under the Fourth Amendment, entering a home to make an arrest typically requires an arrest warrant or exigent circumstances. In this case, the police did not have an arrest warrant, and the question does not specify any exigent circumstances. Therefore, the entry into the home was likely unlawful. The plain view doctrine allows police to seize evidence if they are lawfully present, the incriminating nature of the evidence is immediately apparent, and they have lawful access to it. However, since the entry was unlawful, the police were not lawfully present, and the seizure of the gun would be invalid.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The knock-and-announce rule was followed, so this is not the issue.
- **B**: Incorrect. Probable cause alone does not justify a warrantless entry into a home; an arrest warrant or exigent circumstances is required.
- **C**: Correct. The police must obtain an arrest warrant to enter a home for an arrest, absent exigent circumstances. Since neither a warrant nor exigent circumstances were present, the entry was unlawful, and the gun should be suppressed.
- **D**: Incorrect. The plain view doctrine does not apply because the police were not lawfully present in the home.
- **E**: Incorrect. While an arrest warrant is required, the plain view doctrine does not necessitate a separate search warrant if the police are lawfully present.
- **F**: Incorrect. The absence of the suspect does not negate the requirement for a warrant to enter the home.
- **G**: Incorrect. While the entry may have violated the suspect's privacy, the specific issue is the lack of a warrant or exigent circumstances.
- **H**: Incorrect. A search warrant is not required for a plain view seizure if the police are lawfully present, which they were not.
- **I**: Incorrect. Exigent circumstances were not mentioned in the question, so they cannot be assumed.
- **J**: Incorrect. Knocking and announcing does not resolve the issue of the lack of a warrant.

The correct answer is **C**, as the police were required to obtain an arrest warrant to enter the home, and their failure to do so renders the seizure of the gun inadmissible.
