Question:

A defendant was going out to dinner, and she parked her car at a parking lot across the street from the restaurant. The parking attendant directed the defendant to leave her keys in the car, and he handed her a receipt as she left. Following dinner, the defendant went back to the parking lot and handed her receipt to the attendant who informed her that the parking charge would be $14. Visibly irate, she told the attendant that $14 was much too high for a two-hour parking fee. The parking attendant responded that unless she paid the $14, he could not return her car. She adamantly refused to pay the $14, and her friend, with whom she was having dinner, drove the defendant home in her car. Later that same night, the defendant decided to regain possession of her car with a spare set of keys. She returned to the lot and drove her car home. If the defendant is subsequently charged with larceny, she will most likely be found

Options:

A: not guilty, because she did not take possession of another person's property.
B: guilty, because she intentionally avoided paying the parking fee by using her spare keys.
C: guilty, because she acted with the intent to deprive the parking lot of its rightful fee.
D: guilty, because she was under a binding contractual obligation to pay the parking fee.
E: not guilty, because the parking attendant did not have a legal right to withhold her car.
F: not guilty, because the parking lot's charges were not agreed upon in advance.
G: not guilty, because the $14 charge was excessively high.
H: guilty, because she failed to pay the $14 before regaining possession of her car.
I: guilty, because she knowingly took her car without the consent of the parking attendant.
J: not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.

Okay, so I have this law question here about larceny, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.

So, the defendant parked her car in a lot across from a restaurant. The attendant told her to leave the keys and gave her a receipt. After dinner, she went back, gave the receipt, and was told the charge was $14. She thought it was too high and refused to pay. The attendant said he couldn't return her car unless she paid. Her friend then drove her home in her own car. Later, she used a spare key to take her car back.

Now, she's charged with larceny. I need to determine if she's guilty or not.

First, I remember that larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. So, the key elements are taking without consent, intent to deprive, and that the property belongs to another.

In this case, the defendant took her own car. So, is she taking someone else's property? Wait, the car is hers, but the parking lot had possession of it. But does that make the car the property of the parking lot? I don't think so. The parking lot probably has a possessory interest, but the ownership remains with her.

So, if she takes her own car, even without paying, does that constitute larceny? Because larceny requires taking someone else's property. If she's the owner, she can't steal her own property. So, that might be a defense.

Wait, but sometimes when you leave your property with someone else, like a bailee, the bailee has lawful possession. So, taking it back without permission might be trespass to chattel or something else, but not larceny because it's your own property.

Looking at the options:

Option J says not guilty because she can't be charged with larceny of her own car. That seems right. But let me check others.

Option A says she didn't take another's property. That's similar to J. But J is more specific.

Option E says the attendant didn't have the right to withhold her car. That might be about the legality of the parking lot's actions, but the question is about her taking the car.

Option I says guilty because she took without consent. But again, if it's her own car, consent isn't needed.

So, the main issue is whether she can commit larceny of her own property. I think the answer is no. Therefore, J is the correct choice.

The defendant cannot be guilty of larceny because she cannot steal her own property. Larceny requires the unlawful taking of another's property, and the car in question belongs to her. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.

Answer: J
