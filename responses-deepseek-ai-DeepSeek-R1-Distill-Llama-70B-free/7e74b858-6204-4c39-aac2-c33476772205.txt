Question:

A defendant is on trial for attempting to cash a forged check at a bank. A teller at the bank is called to testify. The teller testified that she was on duty when the defendant came to her station and handed her a check drawn on the account of another customer. She recognized the forgery because she knew the other customer's signature since he was one of her regulars. The teller further testified that after becoming suspicious, she placed the check down on the counter and turned to talk to her supervisor. As she did so, the defendant picked up the check and left the bank before she could say anything. The check that the defendant presented at the bank was not recovered by law enforcement authorities and was not offered as evidence. The teller's testimony regarding the forged signature on the check is

Options:

A: admissible, because the witness has the ability to recognize forged signatures.
B: inadmissible, because the witness is at fault in allowing the loss of the original by failing to secure the check.
C: admissible, because it is rationally related to the witness's perception.
D: inadmissible, because it is not possible for the jury to compare the signature on the check since it was not presented as evidence.
E: admissible, because the witness knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery.
F: admissible, because the witness was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting.
G: inadmissible, because the witness didn't directly see the defendant forging the signature.
H: inadmissible, because the witness did not see the defendant forge the signature.
I: inadmissible, because the defendant left the bank with the check before the witness could confront him.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about a trial where a defendant is accused of trying to cash a forged check. The teller is testifying about what happened. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the situation: the defendant goes to the bank and gives the teller a check. The teller recognizes it as forged because she knows the regular customer's signature. Then, when she becomes suspicious, she puts the check down and turns to talk to her supervisor. But while she's doing that, the defendant picks up the check and leaves. The check wasn't recovered and isn't presented as evidence. So the question is about whether the teller's testimony about the forged signature is admissible.

Hmm, so I need to think about the rules of evidence here. Specifically, the admissibility of testimony about a forged signature when the physical check isn't available. I remember that under the best evidence rule, which is FRE 1002, the original document is typically required to prove its contents. But there are exceptions. So, in this case, the check is the original, but it's not available. So the teller is testifying about the contents of the check, specifically the signature.

Wait, but wait. The best evidence rule applies when a party is trying to prove the content of a writing. So if the teller is testifying about the signature, which is part of the writing, does that fall under the best evidence rule? I think so, but maybe there's an exception because the original is lost or not available.

Looking at the options, option B says it's inadmissible because the witness is at fault for losing the check. I don't think that's right. The best evidence rule isn't about fault; it's about whether the original is available. If the original is lost or destroyed, there's an exception under FRE 1004, which allows secondary evidence. So if the teller can explain why the check isn't available, her testimony could be allowed.

Option D says it's inadmissible because the jury can't compare the signature without the check. But wait, the teller's testimony is about her own knowledge of the customer's signature. She's not testifying about what the signature looks like in comparison, but rather that she recognized it as a forgery because she knows the customer's signature. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply here because she's not testifying to the content but rather her recognition based on familiarity.

Wait, no. Her testimony about the forged signature would require her to relate what she saw on the check, which is the content. So under FRE 1002, she can't testify about the content unless the original is produced or falls under an exception. But in this case, the original was lost because the defendant took it. So under FRE 1004, the proponent can use secondary evidence if the original was lost or destroyed without fault of the proponent. Or maybe the original is in the possession of the defendant, which could be another exception.

But the teller's testimony is about the signature she saw. So she's testifying based on her perception of the check. Alternatively, maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply because she's testifying about a fact she observed (that the signature was forged), which doesn't require the original. Wait, but the content of the signature is the key point. So she's testifying about what she saw on the check, which is the content, so best evidence would require the check to be produced unless an exception applies.

But another angle: the teller's testimony about her recognition of the signature is based on her personal knowledge. She knows the customer's signature, so when she saw the check, she could tell it was a forgery. So her testimony is about her own perception and knowledge, not just the content of the check. So perhaps the best evidence rule doesn't apply because she's not trying to prove the content of the document, but rather her own knowledge and actions.

Wait, no. She's testifying about the content because she's saying the signature was forged, which is based on what she saw on the check. So to prove that the signature was forged, she needs to establish what the signature looked like. But without the check, it's hearsay or violates best evidence.

Alternatively, maybe it's allowed under the rule that allows testimony about the contents of a writing if the original is unavailable, provided certain conditions are met. So if the original is lost or destroyed, and the witness can testify about its content, then it's admissible.

But in this case, the original was taken by the defendant. So the prosecution might argue that the original is in the defendant's possession, which would be an exception under FRE 1004 (6), which says that if the original is in the possession of the opponent, secondary evidence is admissible. But wait, the defendant is the opponent, and the check is in their possession. So the prosecution can use secondary evidence.

Wait, but the witness's testimony is about the content, so that would be secondary evidence. So the teller's testimony about the signature is secondary evidence, which is allowed because the original is with the defendant.

Alternatively, perhaps the best evidence rule doesn't apply because the teller is testifying about what she saw, which is a fact she observed, not the content of the document. Wait, but the content is the signature, which she observed. So maybe the best evidence rule applies, but the exception for unavailability allows her testimony.

Alternatively, maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply because she's testifying to her own actions and recognition, not to prove the content of the writing. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the options:

Option E says it's admissible because the witness knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery. That sounds plausible because she's testifying based on her familiarity with the customer's signature, so her testimony is based on personal knowledge, not just the content of the check.

Option F is similar, saying it's admissible because she was familiar with the victim's handwriting. That also sounds correct, as she can testify based on that familiarity.

Option A says it's admissible because she can recognize forged signatures. That's a bit broader, maybe implying she's an expert, but she's just a teller who knows a regular customer's signature.

Option D says it's inadmissible because the jury can't compare without the check. That might be a problem, but if she's allowed to testify about her recognition, maybe the best evidence rule doesn't block it.

Wait, but the best evidence rule is about proving the content. So if the content is necessary, then the original is needed unless an exception applies. So in this case, the teller is testifying about the content (the signature), so the best evidence rule would require the check unless it's unavailable. Since the check is not available, and it's because the defendant took it, which would fall under FRE 1004(3) or (6), perhaps allowing secondary evidence.

So her testimony is admissible as secondary evidence because the original is unavailable. Wait, but the options don't directly address that. Let me look again.

Option E says it's admissible because she knew the customer and could identify the forgery. That goes to the basis of her knowledge, which is proper. So she can testify that she recognized the signature as forged because she knew the customer's signature.

Alternatively, maybe the best evidence rule isn't the issue here. Maybe it's about the foundation for her testimony. She can testify based on her personal knowledge, so her testimony is admissible.

So looking at the options, E and F both seem to focus on her familiarity with the customer's handwriting. F says "witness was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting," which is accurate. E says she knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery.

So both E and F seem correct in their reasoning. But the question is about admissibility. The best evidence rule may not apply because she's testifying about her own perception and knowledge, not just the content of the document. Or perhaps it does apply, but an exception allows her testimony.

Alternatively, maybe the best evidence rule applies, but because the original is not available through any fault of the defendant, secondary evidence is allowed. So her testimony is admissible.

Wait, but some options address the best evidence issue. Option D says inadmissible because the jury can't compare. But the teller's testimony doesn't require the jury to compare; they can take her word for it if she's credible. So D seems incorrect.

Option B says inadmissible because the witness is at fault. But the best evidence rule isn't about fault; it's about availability. So B seems incorrect.

Option G and H say inadmissible because she didn't see the defendant forge it. But that's not the issue—the issue is whether she can testify about the signature. So G and H are about a different point.

Option I says inadmissible because the defendant left with the check. But again, that's about the availability, but the rule allows for exceptions when the original is unavailable.

So putting it all together, the key issue is whether the teller can testify about the forged signature without the check being present. The best evidence rule requires the original unless an exception applies. Here, the original is with the defendant, so under FRE 1004(3) or (6), secondary evidence is permissible. Therefore, her testimony is admissible.

But wait, the options don't explicitly mention the best evidence rule exceptions. So looking at the options, E and F focus on her familiarity, which is a basis for her testimony, making it admissible. So the correct answer would be E or F.

Wait, the correct answer is probably E or F. But let me think again. The question is about the admissibility of her testimony regarding the forged signature. Her testimony is based on her knowledge of the customer's signature, which she can testify about. So E says it's admissible because she knew the customer and could identify the forgery. F says because she was familiar with the victim's handwriting.

So both E and F seem correct, but looking at the options, maybe the better answer is E because it's more specific about her knowing the customer, which is why she recognized the forgery.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. But wait, let me recall: under the best evidence rule, when a witness testifies about a writing, the original is preferred, but when the witness is testifying based on their own knowledge and not just to prove the content, it might be allowed.

Wait, but in this case, she's testifying about the content of the check—the signature. So best evidence applies, but an exception allows her testimony because the original is unavailable (with the defendant). So her testimony is admissible as secondary evidence.

But looking at the options, the options don't address the best evidence exception directly. So perhaps the answer is E because it's about her knowledge of the customer's signature, allowing her to testify about the forgery. So the testimony is admissible because she has personal knowledge, making option E correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that when the original is not available, a witness can testify about its contents if they have knowledge. So perhaps the answer is E or F.

Wait, another approach: the teller's testimony is about her perception of the signature, which she recognized as a forgery because she knows the customer. Therefore, her testimony is admissible as it's based on her personal knowledge, and the best evidence rule doesn't bar it when the original is unavailable. So the correct answer is E or F.

I think the correct answer is E. Because she knew the customer, she could identify the forgery, making her testimony admissible.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the teller's testimony regarding the forged signature on a check that was not recovered and presented as evidence. The key issue is whether the teller's testimony about the signature's forgery is admissible under the rules of evidence, particularly the best evidence rule (FRE 1002) and its exceptions.

The best evidence rule generally requires the original document to prove its contents. However, exceptions under FRE 1004 allow secondary evidence if the original is unavailable. In this case, the check was taken by the defendant, making it unavailable. This falls under an exception, as the original is in the possession of the opponent (the defendant), allowing secondary evidence.

The teller's testimony is based on her personal knowledge of the customer's signature, which she recognized as forged. Her testimony is not merely about the content of the check but also about her recognition of the forgery, which is within her personal knowledge. This makes her testimony admissible. While the best evidence rule applies to the content of the writing, the teller's ability to testify about her recognition of the forgery is rooted in her familiarity with the customer's signature, which is a valid basis for her testimony.

Options E and F both address the teller's familiarity with the customer's or alleged victim's handwriting. Option E is more specific, emphasizing that the teller knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery. This aligns with the reasoning that her testimony is admissible because it is based on her personal knowledge and recognition of the signature.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: admissible, because the witness knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery.
