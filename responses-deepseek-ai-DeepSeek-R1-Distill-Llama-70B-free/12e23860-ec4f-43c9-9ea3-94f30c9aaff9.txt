Okay, so I have this problem here about identifying a nuclide based on its magnetic moment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that the magnetic moment μI is 2.884 x 10^-27 J T^-1. And the nuclear spin is known to be 1. I need to pick the correct nuclide from the options given.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moment of a nucleus is related to its nuclear spin and other constants. The formula for the magnetic moment is μ = g * μ_N * I, where I is the nuclear spin, g is the gyromagnetic ratio, and μ_N is the nuclear magneton.

So, μ_N is a constant, right? Let me check its value. Oh yeah, μ_N is approximately 5.0507837 × 10^-27 J T^-1. So that's a known value.

The spin I is given as 1 for this nuclide. So, plug that in. Now, the formula becomes μ = g * μ_N * 1. So, μ = g * μ_N.

Wait, but the gyromagnetic ratio g varies depending on the nucleus. For protons, g is around 5.586, and for neutrons, it's about -3.826. But wait, when considering the magnetic moment of a nucleus with a certain spin, I think it's more about the nucleus's overall g-factor, which depends on its composition—like the number of protons and neutrons and their arrangement.

Wait, but maybe I should think differently. I remember that for certain nuclei, their magnetic moments are tabulated. For example, the proton (like in 1H) has a magnetic moment of about 2.793 μ_N, which is around 2.793 * 5.05e-27 J T^-1. Let me calculate that: 2.793 * 5.05e-27 ≈ 1.41e-26 J T^-1. But wait, the given μ here is 2.884e-27 J T^-1, which is smaller than that. So maybe it's not the proton.

Another thought: the magnetic moment for a nucleus with spin I is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * I, where g_I is the gyromagnetic ratio for that nucleus. Since I is 1, the formula simplifies to μ = g_I * μ_N.

So, solving for g_I, it would be μ / μ_N. Let me compute that: (2.884e-27) / (5.05078e-27) ≈ 0.571. So g_I is approximately 0.571.

Wait, that's an important point. So the gyromagnetic ratio g for the nucleus is about 0.571. Now I need to think which nucleus has a g-factor close to this value.

I remember that for certain nuclei, like 13C, the magnetic moment is known. Let me think. Carbon-13 has a nuclear spin I=1/2, but wait, no, wait. No, 13C has I=1/2. Wait, no, the given I here is 1. So maybe 13C is not the one. Wait, which of the options have I=1?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 14N: Nitrogen-14 has I=1. So that's a candidate.

Option B: 17O: Oxygen-17 has I=5/2? Or maybe 17O has I=5/2. Wait, I think 17O is spin 5/2. So that's not I=1, so probably not.

Option C: 1H: I=1/2.

Option D:13C: I=1/2.

Option E:16O: I=0, because it's a doubly magic number, so no spin.

Option F:19F: I=1/2.

Option G:23Na: Sodium-23 has I=3/2.

Option H:12C: I=0.

Option I:6Li: I=1? Wait, I think 6Li has I=1. Let me check. Yes, Lithium-6 has I=1, if I recall correctly.

Option J:2H: Deuterium has I=1.

Wait, so the problem states that the nuclear spin is known to be 1. So among the options, which have I=1?

Looking again:

14N: I=1 (option A)

6Li: I=1 (option I)

2H (Deuterium): I=1 (option J)

Wait, so our possible candidates are A, I, J.

Now, each of these has I=1, so the magnetic moments depend on their g-factors.

So for each of these, I should find their known magnetic moments.

Let me think:

1. 14N: Nitrogen-14 has I=1. Its magnetic moment is known. I think it's around μ = 0.403 μ_N. Wait, because when I=1, μ is g_I * μ_N. So if g_I is 0.403 / μ_N, no, wait, μ = g_I * I * μ_N. No, I=1, so μ = g_I * μ_N.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula is μ = g_I * μ_N * I. But since I=1, it's just μ = g_I * μ_N.

So, for 14N, what's g_I? I think Nitrogen-14 has a magnetic moment of about 0.403 μ_N. Because I remember that for 14N, μ is positive and about 0.4. So 0.403 * 5.05e-27 J T^-1 would be approximately 2.03e-27, but wait, the given μ is 2.884e-27, which is larger than that. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again. If μ = g_I * μ_N, and for 14N, μ is 0.403 * μ_N.

μ_N is 5.05e-27, so 0.403 * 5.05e-27 ≈ 2.03e-27, which is less than the given 2.884e-27. So perhaps not.

Next, 2H (Deuterium, option J). Its magnetic moment: I think the deuteron has a magnetic moment around 0.857 μ_N. So μ = 0.857 * 5.05e-27 ≈ 4.328e-27. That's higher than the given value of 2.884e-27. So that's not matching.

Wait, but wait: no, the given μ is 2.884e-27, which is about 0.571 times μ_N. Because 2.884e-27 / 5.05e-27 ≈ 0.571.

So looking for a nucleus with g_I ≈ 0.571.

What about 6Li? Let me think. I believe Lithium-6 has a magnetic moment around 0.822 μ_N. So 0.822 * 5.05e-27 is about 4.15e-27, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the magnetic moment is given as μ = μ_N * g_I * I, but since I=1, it's μ = g_I * μ_N.

So the given μ is 2.884e-27 J T^-1. So:

g_I = μ / μ_N = (2.884e-27) / (5.05078e-27) ≈ 0.571.

So g_I is approximately 0.571. Now, I need to find which of the options with I=1 has a g_I of about 0.57.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 14N (I=1)

Option I:6Li (I=1)

Option J:2H (I=1)

So let me look up (or recall) their g-factors.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moments of some common nuclei:

- Proton (1H): μ ≈ 2.793 μ_N → g_I ≈ 2.793 (since I=1/2, but wait, no. Wait, for the proton, I=1/2, so μ = g_I * μ_N * (1/2). So solving for g_I, it's (2.793 μ_N) * 2 / μ_N → g_I ≈5.586. Oh, that's the proton's g-factor.

Similarly, for the neutron, g_I is about -3.826.

But for composite nuclei like 14N, which is a spin-1 nucleus, the g-factor is determined by the combination of protons and neutrons. For 14N: it's Z=7 protons and N=7 neutrons.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the nuclear shell model. For a nucleus with spin I, the magnetic moment can be estimated based on the last unpaired nucleon. But perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I can recall the magnetic moments of specific isotopes.

Wait, I think that 14N has a magnetic moment of about 0.403 μ_N, as I thought earlier, which would correspond to a g_I of 0.403 * 2, because I=1. Wait, no. Wait, μ = g_I * μ_N * I.

Wait, for 14N, I=1, so μ = g_I * μ_N * 1. So if μ = 0.403 μ_N, then g_I = 0.403.

But wait, in our problem, g_I is 0.571, so this doesn't match 14N.

What about 6Li? Its magnetic moment is about 0.822 μ_N. So g_I = 0.822 (because I=1). So 0.822 is higher than 0.571, so that doesn't match.

Wait, what about 2H (Deuterium)? Its magnetic moment is about 0.857 μ_N. So g_I is 0.857. Again, higher than 0.571, so not matching.

Hmm, none of these match the required g_I of 0.571. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the given μ is 2.884e-27 J T^-1. Let's compute g_I again: 2.884e-27 / 5.05078e-27 ≈ 0.571.

So, g_I = 0.571. Which nucleus has a g_I around 0.57?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing g_I and μ. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the magnetic moment in nuclear magnetons is given as μ = μ_N * g_I * I. So for I=1, μ = g_I * μ_N.

So, in units of μ_N, the given μ is 0.571 μ_N.

So looking for a nucleus with μ ≈ 0.57 μ_N and I=1.

Wait, I think that 13C has I=1/2, so that's not applicable here. But wait, what about other isotopes.

Wait, another thought: maybe the nucleus is 17O? No, 17O has I=5/2, so that's not I=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a nucleus in the options. Let me list the options again and their I values:

A:14N → I=1 → μ=0.403 μ_N → g_I=0.403.

B:17O → I=5/2.

C:1H → I=1/2.

D:13C → I=1/2.

E:16O → I=0.

F:19F → I=1/2.

G:23Na → I=3/2.

H:12C → I=0.

I:6Li → I=1 → μ≈0.822 μ_N → g_I=0.822.

J:2H → I=1 → μ≈0.857 μ_N → g_I=0.857.

So among these, the given μ is 0.571 μ_N, which is about 0.57. But none of the options have μ around that value. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of g_I. Let me double-check.

Given μ = 2.884e-27 J T^-1.

μ_N = 5.0507837e-27 J T^-1.

So g_I = μ / (μ_N * I) → since I=1, g_I=2.884e-27 / 5.05078e-27 ≈ 0.571.

So g_I ≈ 0.571.

Looking for a nucleus with g_I=0.571 and I=1.

Wait, perhaps it's 19F? No, 19F has I=1/2. Or maybe 23Na? No, I=3/2.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of other possible nuclides. Wait, perhaps it's 9Be? No, that's not in the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 14N, but I thought its μ was 0.403 μ_N. But wait, maybe I'm wrong about that. Let me think again.

Wait, I might have the magnetic moments mixed up. Let me try to find the correct magnetic moments for these isotopes.

Upon checking (pretending I'm looking this up), I find:

- 14N: magnetic moment μ = +0.403 μ_N.

- 6Li: μ = +0.822 μ_N.

- 2H (Deuterium): μ = +0.857 μ_N.

Wait, but all of these have higher μ than 0.571 μ_N. But wait, in the problem, the μ is 0.571 μ_N.

Wait, am I confusing something? Because none of the options with I=1 have g_I=0.571. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of μ_N? Let me check: yes, μ_N is about 5.05e-27 J/T.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the magnetic moment in terms of the nuclear spin quantum number. Another approach: the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * I. Since I=1, μ = g_I * μ_N.

We have μ = 2.884e-27 J/T. So, g_I = 2.884e-27 / 5.05e-27 ≈ 0.571.

So I need a nucleus with g_I=0.571 and I=1.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J, 2H, but its g_I is 0.857, which doesn't match. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong g-factor. Perhaps the magnetic moment is given in terms of the Bohr magneton? No, wait, for nuclei, it's the nuclear magneton. So I think that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the magnetic moment can be negative? But the given value is positive, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe the spin is 1, but it's a different type of nucleus. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 14N, but I thought its magnetic moment is 0.403 μ_N, which would give μ = 0.403 * 5.05e-27 ≈ 2.033e-27, which is less than the given value. So that's not matching.

Wait, what if I made a calculation mistake earlier? Let me recalculate g_I.

Given μ = 2.884e-27 J/T.

μ_N = 5.0507837e-27 J/T.

So g_I = 2.884e-27 / 5.0507837e-27 = 2.884 / 5.05078 ≈ 0.571.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct nucleus is 14N, and I'm miscalculating the magnetic moment.

Wait, let's think again: 14N has I=1, and μ = 0.403 μ_N. So μ = 0.403 * 5.05e-27 ≈ 2.03e-27 J/T.

But the given μ is 2.884e-27, which is higher. So that's not matching.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 2H, option J. Let's compute its magnetic moment.

2H has I=1. Its magnetic moment is about 0.857 μ_N. So μ = 0.857 * 5.05e-27 ≈ 4.33e-27, which is much larger than the given value. So that's not it.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 6Li, option I. It has I=1, and μ=0.822 μ_N. So 0.822 *5.05e-27 ≈ 4.15e-27, which is again higher than the given value.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a nuclide. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 13C, which has I=1/2, so cannot be. Option G is 23Na, I=3/2. Option B, 17O, I=5/2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the quadrupole moment or something else, but no, the question is about magnetic moment and spin.

Wait, could the correct answer be 14N, but I'm miscalculating something? Because its μ is 0.403 μ_N, but in the problem, the μ is 0.571 μ_N. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think about another formula. The magnetic moment is also given by μ = √(I(I+1)) * μ_N * g_I. Wait, no, that's not correct. The magnetic dipole moment is more accurately given by μ = g_I * μ_N * m_I, where m_I is the magnetic quantum number, which ranges from -I to +I. But the maximum magnetic moment is when m_I = I, so the maximum μ is g_I * μ_N * I.

But usually, when we talk about the magnetic moment of a nucleus, we refer to the maximum value, which would be g_I * μ_N * I. So for a nucleus with I=1, the maximum μ is g_I * μ_N * 1.

So, in our case, the given μ must be the maximum, so it's equal to g
