Question:

A man decided to stop at a drive-through hamburger stand for a late snack. As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, "Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. " The manager retorted, "I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. "Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, "You can't do this to me. " When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head. In an action by the customer against the man for battery, the customer will be

Options:

A: successful, because the man caused harm with his actions, regardless of his intent.
B: unsuccessful, because the man was not aiming at the customer.
C: unsuccessful, because the manager could have prevented the situation by accepting the man's order.
D: successful, because the man was acting recklessly and created a dangerous situation.
E: unsuccessful, because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager.
F: unsuccessful, because the man was provoked by the manager's refusal to serve him.
G: unsuccessful, because the man did not intend to shoot the customer.
H: successful, because there was a "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.
I: successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager.
J: successful, because the bullet from the man's gun directly caused the customer's injury.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question about battery. Let me start by recalling what I know about battery. From what I remember, battery is an intentional tort, which means the person must have intended to cause harmful or offensive contact with another person. The contact has to be with the plaintiff, and it must be harmful or offensive. 

In this scenario, the man is angry because the manager wouldn't take his order. He ends up shooting at the manager but misses and hits another customer, wounding him in the head. The customer is suing the man for battery.

So, the key issue here is whether the man's action constitutes battery against the customer. Let me break it down.

First, did the man intend to shoot someone? It seems like he did. He aimed at the manager and fired. So, he had the intent to shoot. But he was aiming at the manager, not the customer. So, does that matter?

I think there's a legal principle here called "transferred intent." Transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to commit a tort against one person but actually affects another. For example, if someone throws a rock at person A but hits person B, the intent to harm A is transferred to B. So, in this case, the man intended to shoot the manager, but the bullet hit the customer. Under transferred intent, his intent to harm the manager could transfer to the customer, making him liable for battery against the customer.

Wait, but I'm not sure if transferred intent applies in all situations. I think it applies to intentional torts like battery and assault. So, in this case, yes, it should apply. So, even though he wasn't aiming at the customer, his intent to harm the manager transfers, making him liable to the customer.

Let me check the options now.

Option A: Successful because he caused harm regardless of intent. But battery requires intent, so this might not fit because it's about intent. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Unsuccessful because he wasn't aiming at the customer. But with transferred intent, this shouldn't matter. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Unsuccessful because manager could have prevented. That's irrelevant to the man's intent and action. So C is wrong.

Option D: Successful because he acted recklessly and created danger. Recklessness is more about negligence, but battery is about intent. So D might be about a different tort, not battery.

Option E: Unsuccessful because couldn't foresee. But transferred intent doesn't require foreseeability of the exact person, just intent to harm someone. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Unsuccessful because provoked. Provocation might reduce culpability in some crimes, but in torts, if the action is intentional, provocation doesn't usually negate liability. So F is wrong.

Option G: Unsuccessful because he didn't intend to shoot the customer. But transferred intent says the intent can transfer, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Successful because substantial certainty. This sounds like the doctrine where if the defendant's actions were substantially certain to cause contact, it's battery. But in this case, the man fired a gun, which is almost certainly going to hit someone. So H could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit here. But transferred intent might be more applicable.

Option I: Successful because he intended to shoot the manager. This aligns with transferred intent. So I is a possible correct answer.

Option J: Successful because the bullet directly caused injury. This is about causation, which is true, but the key is intent. So J is true but doesn't address the intent issue. The question is about whether the intent to harm the manager transfers to the customer.

Wait, so let me clarify. The man intended to shoot the manager, so under transferred intent, the intent is imputed to the customer. So the battery against the customer is established because the intent to harm exists, even though directed at someone else.

So looking back at the options, I think I is correct because it's about the intent to shoot the manager, and through transferred intent, the customer can sue.

Alternatively, H says "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit. But the man fired a gun in a place where people were present, so it's substantially certain someone would be hit, but did he intend that? Or was he just aiming at the manager. So H might be more about recklessness, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the doctrine of transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to commit a tort against A, and the tort affects B. So the intent is transferred from A to B. So the man intended to shoot the manager, but hit the customer. So the intent to commit battery against the manager transfers to the customer, making him liable for battery against the customer.

So in that case, option I says, "successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager." That's correct because transferred intent applies, so the customer can sue.

Wait, but option H says "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit. That's more about the intent to create a high risk of harm to someone, which might apply in cases like throwing a bomb where you don't intend to hurt a specific person but know someone will be hurt. That's sometimes called "purposely" causing harm.

In this case, the man intended to shoot the manager, so it's specific intent. So the transferred intent applies, making I the correct answer.

But I'm a bit confused because another angle is that when you intend to shoot someone, even if you miss, the intent transfers. So the customer can sue for battery because the intent was there, even though the target was someone else.

So looking at the options again, option I states that the man intended to shoot the manager, which, through transferred intent, makes the customer's case successful. So the answer should be I.

Alternatively, option H could be considered, but I think transferred intent is more directly applicable here. So I think the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the man's actions constitute battery against the customer he inadvertently shot. Battery is an intentional tort requiring the defendant to intend harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff. The key issue is whether the man's intent to shoot the manager can be transferred to the customer through the legal doctrine of transferred intent.

Transferred intent applies when a defendant intends to commit a tort against one person but instead harms another. In this case, the man aimed at the manager but hit the customer. Under transferred intent, his intent to harm the manager transfers to the customer, making him liable for battery against the customer.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect because battery requires intent, and this option ignores that requirement.
- **B**: Incorrect because transferred intent applies even if the man was not aiming at the customer.
- **C**: Incorrect because the manager's actions are irrelevant to the man's intent and liability.
- **D**: Incorrect because recklessness pertains to negligence, not the intentional tort of battery.
- **E**: Incorrect because transferred intent does not require foreseeability of the exact person harmed.
- **F**: Incorrect because provocation does not negate liability for intentional torts.
- **G**: Incorrect because transferred intent imputes the man's intent to the customer, despite not targeting them.
- **H**: While "substantial certainty" could apply, it is less specific than transferred intent in this context.
- **I**: Correct because the man intended to shoot the manager, and transferred intent applies to the customer.
- **J**: Incorrect because it focuses on causation without addressing the intent required for battery.

The correct answer is **I**, as the man's intent to shoot the manager transfers to the customer through transferred intent, establishing liability for battery.
