Okay, so I have this economics problem in front of me about the videotape-copying industry. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these perfect competition questions, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says the industry is perfectly competitive. So I remember that in perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they can't influence the market price. They produce where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, which in this case is the market price.

Each firm can copy five tapes per day at an average cost of $10 per tape. Wait, so each firm's daily capacity is five tapes, and each tape costs them $10 on average. So the average cost (AC) is $10 per tape. I'm guessing this includes all costs except maybe the royalty, which is separate.

Oh right, the royalty. Each firm must pay a royalty to film studios, and the royalty rate r is 0.002 times the total industry output Q. So r = 0.002*Q. That means the royalty per tape depends on the total number of tapes produced in the entire industry. So the more tapes everyone makes, the higher the royalty each firm has to pay per tape.

The demand is given by Q = D(P) = 1050 - 50P. So the market demand curve is a linear function where quantity demanded depends on price. When price goes up, quantity demanded goes down, which makes sense.

The industry is in long-run equilibrium, so I need to find the equilibrium price. In the long run, firms enter or exit until economic profits are zero. So the price should equal the minimum of the long-run average cost curve, but I'm not sure if that's the case here because of the royalty. Hmm.

Wait, in perfect competition, the long-run equilibrium condition is price equals marginal cost, but also price equals average cost (since profits are zero). But here, each firm has an average cost of $10, but there's also this royalty which depends on total output. So the total cost for each firm isn't just their production cost but also the royalty per tape.

So let me think about this. The total cost for a firm would be the production cost plus the royalty per tape times the number of tapes they produce. Let's denote a firm's output as q. Then, their total cost is AC * q + r * q. But wait, r is 0.002*Q, where Q is the total industry output. Since the industry is composed of many firms, each producing q, Q = n*q, where n is the number of firms. So r = 0.002*n*q.

So each firm's total cost is (10 + r)*q. But since r depends on Q, which is n*q, each firm's cost is also a function of the total number of firms. This complicates things a bit.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by considering the total cost for the industry. The royalty is a per-tape fee that each firm pays, so total royalty paid by the industry is r*Q. Since r is 0.002*Q, the total royalty is 0.002*Q^2. So the industry's total cost is the sum of production costs and royalties. Production cost is 10*Q, since each tape costs $10. So total cost for the industry is 10Q + 0.002 Q².

Wait, but in perfect competition, each firm takes the price as given. So each firm's marginal cost is the derivative of their total cost with respect to their output. But because the royalty depends on total output, each firm's marginal cost isn't just their own production cost but also includes the effect of their output on the royalty rate.

Wait, no. Each firm's own marginal cost is the cost of producing one more tape. Their production cost is $10 per tape. But when they produce an additional tape, that increases Q by one, which increases r by 0.002. So the royalty per tape increases by 0.002 for each additional tape produced by the entire industry.

But wait, each firm is small compared to the industry, so when a single firm increases its output by one tape, the industry output increases by one, so the royalty increases by 0.002. So for each additional tape a firm produces, the royalty per tape increases by 0.002, which affects all the tapes that firm produces. So the marginal cost for the firm isn't just $10 but also includes the additional royalty cost caused by increasing Q.

So the firm's marginal cost would be 10 (production) plus 0.002 times q, because each additional tape increases the royalty by 0.002, and the firm is producing q tapes. Wait, no. Because when the firm produces an additional tape, total Q increases by 1, so the royalty increases by 0.002 per tape. So each tape now costs an extra 0.002 in royalty. So the additional cost for the firm when producing one more tape is 10 (production) plus 0.002 times the number of tapes they produce (since each of their tapes now has a higher royalty). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the royalty per tape is r = 0.002 Q. So the total royalty cost for a firm is r * q. So the firm's total cost is (10 + r) * q. But since r = 0.002 Q = 0.002 (n q), then r = 0.002 n q. So substituting, total cost for the firm is (10 + 0.002 n q) * q = 10 q + 0.002 n q².

But each firm is taking n as given, I think, since there are many firms and they can't affect n much. So the marginal cost (MC) for the firm is derivative of total cost with respect to q. So d(TC)/dq = 10 + 0.004 n q.

Wait, but in perfect competition, each firm's MC should equal the market price. So in equilibrium, P = MC. But market price is also determined by the demand curve.

Wait, but in the long run, the number of firms can change. So n adjusts until profits are zero.

Hmm, perhaps I should set up the equations. Let me try.

In long-run equilibrium, each firm is producing where P = MC, and there are zero profits.

The demand curve is Q = 1050 - 50 P. So P = (1050 - Q)/50.

Each firm's MC is 10 + 0.004 n q. But since all firms are identical, each produces q = Q/n.

So substituting q = Q/n into MC:

MC = 10 + 0.004 n (Q/n) )= 10 + 0.004 Q.

So MC = 10 + 0.004 Q.

But in equilibrium, P = MC. So,

P = 10 + 0.004 Q.

But also, P is determined by demand: P = (1050 - Q)/50.

So set them equal:

(1050 - Q)/50 = 10 + 0.004 Q.

Let me solve for Q.

Multiply both sides by 50 to eliminate denominator:

1050 - Q = 500 + 0.2 Q.

Bring all terms to left:

1050 - 500 - Q - 0.2 Q = 0.

550 - 1.2 Q = 0.

1.2 Q = 550.

Q = 550 / 1.2 = 458.333...

So Q is approximately 458.33 tapes per day.

Now, substitute back into the demand equation to find P.

P = (1050 - Q)/50.

Plugging Q = 458.33:

P = (1050 - 458.33)/50 = (591.67)/50 = 11.8333.

Wait, that's about $11.83. But looking at the options, the closest is E: $11 or J: $12. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, when I set P = MC:

P = 10 + 0.004 Q.

And P = (1050 - Q)/50.

So,

(1050 - Q)/50 = 10 + 0.004 Q.

Multiply both sides by 50:

1050 - Q = 500 + 0.2 Q.

Bring terms together:

1050 - 500 = Q + 0.2 Q.

550 = 1.2 Q.

Q = 550 / 1.2 = 458.333...

Yes, that seems correct.

Then P = (1050 - 458.333)/50 = (591.666...)/50 = 11.8333.

Hmm, so approximately $11.83. The options given don't have this exact value. The closest options are E: $11, J: $12, or maybe G: $10. Wait, but I'm getting around 11.83, which isn't exactly any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating MC. Let me re-express.

Each firm's total cost is (10 + r) * q, where r = 0.002 Q.

So, r = 0.002 * Q.

Total cost for a firm: (10 + 0.002 Q) * q.

Marginal cost is derivative of total cost with respect to q. So that's 10 + 0.002 Q + 0.002 q * dq/dq? Wait, no. Wait, when taking the derivative of TC with respect to q, and remembering that Q is a function of q and n (number of firms), but each firm treats Q as a function of n and q.

Wait, perhaps I should model this differently. Since each firm's production q affects Q, which affects r. So when a firm produces an extra unit, Q increases by 1, so r increases by 0.002. So the cost of producing that extra unit is 10 (production cost) plus the increase in royalty on all units produced.

Wait, that's an important point. If a firm produces one more tape, the royalty per tape increases by 0.002, so for all the q tapes the firm produces, each now costs an additional 0.002 in royalty. So the marginal cost is 10 (production) plus 0.002 * q (additional royalty cost on all q tapes).

So MC = 10 + 0.002 q.

But q is the firm's output. Since in equilibrium, all firms produce the same amount, and Q = n q.

So, substituting q = Q/n, then MC = 10 + 0.002 (Q/n).

Wait, but that complicates things because now MC depends on n, the number of firms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the industry's marginal cost. The industry's MC is the derivative of total cost with respect to Q.

Earlier, I thought the industry's total cost is 10 Q + 0.002 Q².

So, the industry's MC is d(TC)/dQ = 10 + 0.004 Q.

Wait, that's the same as I had earlier. So when I set P = MC, I get (1050 - Q)/50 = 10 + 0.004 Q.

Which led me to Q=458.33, P≈11.83.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the marginal cost.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the royalty as an external cost. Each firm's production affects the royalty rate for everyone. So when a firm produces an extra tape, it increases the royalty that all firms have to pay per tape. But in perfect competition, each firm won't account for this externality, leading to overproduction. But wait, in long-run equilibrium, if firms are making zero profit, perhaps this externality is internalized somehow through the price.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to model the problem by considering each firm's cost, including the royalty, and find the equilibrium.

Wait, let me try again. The royalty per tape is r = 0.002 Q.

Each firm's cost per tape is 10 + r, so 10 + 0.002 Q.

But since Q is the total output, which is the number of firms n times the output per firm q, Q = n q.

So each firm's cost per tape is 10 + 0.002 n q.

But each firm chooses q to maximize profit, taking P as given. So the firm's total revenue is P q, and total cost is (10 + 0.002 n q) q.

So profit is P q - (10 + 0.002 n q) q.

But in perfect competition, firms enter until profits are zero. So in the long run, profit is zero.

So, P q = (10 + 0.002 n q) q.

But since in equilibrium, P is determined by demand: P = (1050 - Q)/50 = (1050 - n q)/50.

So substituting P into the zero-profit condition:

(1050 - n q)/50 * q = (10 + 0.002 n q) q.

We can cancel q from both sides (assuming q ≠ 0, which it isn't).

(1050 - n q)/50 = 10 + 0.002 n q.

Multiply both sides by 50:

1050 - n q = 500 + 0.1 n q.

Bring terms together:

1050 - 500 = n q + 0.1 n q.

550 = 1.1 n q.

So, n q = 550 / 1.1 ≈ 500.

Wait, but Q = n q ≈ 500.

So Q=500.

Now, plug Q=500 into the demand equation to find P.

P = (1050 - 500)/50 = 550 /50 = 11.

So P= $11, which is option E.

Wait, that's different from my earlier result. So where did I go wrong before?

In the first approach, I considered the industry's MC as 10 + 0.004 Q and set it equal to P. That gave me Q≈458.33 and P≈11.83.

In the second approach, considering each firm's cost and the zero-profit condition, I arrived at Q=500 and P=11.

So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because in the first approach, I treated the industry's MC as 10 + 0.004 Q, which might not account correctly for the per-firm costs and the number of firms.

Wait, in the second approach, I think I correctly modeled each firm's cost, which includes the royalty dependent on total output, and found that in equilibrium, Q=500 and P=11.

So that would make the answer E: $11.

But let me check the calculations again.

From the zero-profit condition:

(1050 - n q)/50 = 10 + 0.002 n q.

Multiply both sides by 50: 1050 - n q = 500 + 0.1 n q.

Bring like terms together: 1050 -500 = n q +0.1 n q → 550 = 1.1 n q → n q = 500.

So Q=500.

Then P = (1050 -500)/50 = 550/50=11.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the equilibrium price is $11, which is option E.
</think>

To determine the equilibrium price in the perfectly competitive videotape-copying industry, we analyze the market using the given demand function and cost structure. The demand is \( Q = 1050 - 50P \), and each firm has an average cost of $10 per tape. Additionally, a royalty rate \( r = 0.002Q \) is paid to film studios, where \( Q \) is the total industry output. The industry is in long-run equilibrium, meaning firms earn zero economic profits.

### Step 1: Total Cost and Marginal Cost
Each firm's total cost includes production costs and royalties. The royalty per tape is \( r = 0.002Q \), so the total cost for a firm producing \( q \) tapes is:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = (10 + 0.002Q)q
\]
The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of total cost with respect to \( q \), treating \( Q \) as a function of total industry output:
\[
MC = 10 + 0.002Q
\]

### Step 2: Equilibrium Condition
In long-run equilibrium, the market price \( P \) equals marginal cost. Substituting \( P \) from the demand function:
\[
P = \frac{1050 - Q}{50}
\]
Setting \( P = MC \):
\[
\frac{1050 - Q}{50} = 10 + 0.002Q
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( Q \)
Multiply through by 50 to eliminate the denominator:
\[
1050 - Q = 500 + 0.1Q
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
1050 - 500 = Q + 0.1Q
\]
\[
550 = 1.1Q
\]
\[
Q = \frac{550}{1.1} \approx 500
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( P \)
Substitute \( Q = 500 \) into the demand function:
\[
P = \frac{1050 - 500}{50} = \frac{550}{50} = 11
\]

### Conclusion
The equilibrium price of copied tapes is $11. This corresponds to option **E**.
