Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the work done by a system during a chemical reaction. Hmm, I remember that work done by the system is related to expansion against an external pressure. Let me think about the formula.

Wait, right! The formula for work done is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Oh wait, wait, I think it's actually the negative of the external pressure multiplied by the change in volume. So w equals negative P external times delta V. Right.

So the problem gives me the cross-sectional area of the container, which is 50 cm squared. Oh wait, cm squared. I should convert that to meters squared because the standard unit for pressure is in Pascals, which is N/m². So 50 cm² is 50 times (0.01 m)^2. Wait, 1 cm is 0.01 meters. So 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 0.0001 m². So 50 cm² is 50 * 0.0001 = 0.005 m².

Then the piston is pushed out through 15 cm. Oh, that's the distance, so in meters that's 0.15 meters. So the change in volume ΔV is area times distance. So 0.005 m² * 0.15 m = 0.00075 m³. Yeah, that makes sense.

The external pressure is 1.0 atm. Oh right, I need to convert that to Pascals because the standard unit for pressure in SI is Pascals. I remember that 1 atm is approximately 101325 Pascals. So P_ext is 101325 Pa.

Now putting it all together. Work done w is -P_ext * ΔV. So plugging in the numbers: -101325 Pa * 0.00075 m³. Let's calculate that.

Wait, 101325 multiplied by 0.00075. Let me compute that step by step. 100000 * 0.00075 is 75. And 1325 * 0.00075 is... 1325 * 0.0001 is 0.1325, times 7.5? Wait, wait, maybe better to compute as:

0.00075 is 7.5e-4. So 101325 * 7.5e-4 = ?

Let me compute 101325 * 7.5 first. 100,000 *7.5 is 750,000. 1325 *7.5 is 9937.5. So total is 750000 + 9937.5 = 759,937.5. Then multiply by 1e-4, so 759,937.5 * 1e-4 is 75.99375. So approximately 75.99 Joules.

But wait, the work done by the system is negative of that because the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So the work is negative 75.99 J, approximately -76 J.

Looking at the options, option D is -75 J. That's the closest. So the answer should be D.

Wait, did I make any mistake in the calculations? Let me double-check the units. Area in m², distance in m, giving volume in m³. Pressure in Pa (N/m²). So when multiplied, Pa * m³ = N*m = Joules. That's correct.

Yes, the calculation seems right. So the work done is approximately -75 J, so option D.
</think>

To calculate the work done by the system, we use the formula:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V
\]

### Step 1: Convert units
- The cross-sectional area is \( 50 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \). Converting to \(\mathrm{m}^2\):
  \[
  50 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 = 50 \times (0.01 \, \mathrm{m})^2 = 0.005 \, \mathrm{m}^2
  \]
- The distance the piston is pushed is \( 15 \, \mathrm{cm} \). Converting to \(\mathrm{m}\):
  \[
  15 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.15 \, \mathrm{m}
  \]
- The external pressure is \( 1.0 \, \mathrm{atm} \). Converting to Pascals:
  \[
  1 \, \mathrm{atm} = 101325 \, \mathrm{Pa}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the change in volume
The change in volume is given by:
\[
\Delta V = \text{Area} \cdot \text{Distance} = 0.005 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \cdot 0.15 \, \mathrm{m} = 0.00075 \, \mathrm{m}^3
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the work done
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V = -(101325 \, \mathrm{Pa}) \cdot (0.00075 \, \mathrm{m}^3)
\]
\[
w = -75.99 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated work is approximately \( -76 \, \mathrm{J} \), which is closest to option **D: -75 J**.
