Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the average surface conductance per unit length of a long rod. Hmm, let's see what they're asking. The rod's diameter is 0.33 inches, exposed to hot air blast at 110°F. The temperature of the rod went from 50°F to 70°F in 60 seconds. The material properties given are thermal conductivity k = 300 Btu/hr·ft·°F, density rho = 600 lbm/ft³, and specific heat Cp = 0.18 Btu/lbm·°F. The options are A to D, with different values.

Wait, surface conductance... Oh right, that's probably referring to the convective heat transfer coefficient, h. But wait, the problem says "surface conductance per unit length." Hmm, maybe it's the overall heat transfer coefficient or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the conduction in the rod?

Wait, no, the question is about the average surface conductance. Oh, surface conductance is h, which is the convective coefficient. But wait, the problem gives the thermal conductivity, which is a property of the material, so maybe it's not just convection but conduction as well.

Wait, maybe I should think about the heat transfer process. The rod is exposed to air, so heat is conducted through the rod and then convected away. But since it's a transient problem (temperature changing over time), I might need to use some transient heat transfer equations.

Wait, another thought: The problem gives the change in temperature over time. The rod's temperature goes from 50 to 70°F in 60 seconds. So maybe I can model this as a lumped capacitance problem, where the entire rod's temperature changes uniformly. That would make things simpler.

The lumped capacitance method assumes that the temperature is uniform within the object, which is valid when the Biot number is less than 0.1. Biot number is (hL)/k, where L is the characteristic length. For a cylinder, L is the volume over the surface area, so for a radius r, L = (πr²L)/ (2πrL) )= r/2. Wait, the diameter is 0.33 inches, which is 0.33/12 = 0.0275 feet. So radius r is 0.01375 ft. Then L for cylinder is r/2? Or wait, actually for a cylinder, the volume is πr² L, and surface area is 2πr L. So the characteristic length is (π r² L)/(2 π r L) )= r/2. So L is r/2 = 0.01375 / 2 = 0.006875 ft.

Wait, but if I'm using the lumped capacitance method, I can use the formula:

(T(t) - T_surr) / (T_initial - T_surr) = exp( - (h A) / (ρ V C_p) * t )

But wait, the problem is about the rod, so the volume and surface area are per unit length. Because the question is asking for the conductance per unit length, so I can assume a unit length.

So for a unit length (L=1 ft), volume V is πr² * 1 = π (0.01375)^2 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.01375 squared is 0.00018906, multiplied by π is approximately 0.0005945 ft³.

The surface area A is 2πr * 1 = 2π * 0.01375 ≈ 0.08658 ft².

Wait, but the problem gives the temperature as rising, not falling. The surrounding is at 110°F, and the rod is heating up from 50 to 70°F. So the temperature difference is (70 - 110) = -40°F, but the ratio would be (70-110)/(50-110) = (-40)/(-60) = 2/3. So (T - T_surr)/(T_initial - T_surr) is (70-110)/(50-110) = (-40)/(-60) = 2/3.

Wait, but the formula is (T(t) - T_surr)/(T_initial - T_surr) = exp( - (h A) / (ρ V C_p) * t )

So plugging in: (70-110)/(50-110) = exp( -h A t / (rho V C_p) )

Wait, 70-110 is -40, 50-110 is -60, so ratio is ( -40 ) / (-60 ) = 0.6667.

So 0.6667 = exp( -h * A * t / (rho * V * Cp) )

Take natural log of both sides: ln(0.6667) = - (h A t) / (rho V Cp )

So h = [ - ln(2/3) * rho V Cp ] / (A t )

Wait, let me compute each part.

First, compute ln(2/3) is ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055.

So -ln(2/3) is 0.4055.

Now, rho is 600 lbm/ft³, Cp is 0.18 Btu/lbm·°F, V is 0.0005945 ft³ (per unit length), A is 0.08658 ft², t is 60 seconds.

Wait, but the units must be consistent. Let me check the units. The formula uses time t, which is in seconds, but the other properties are in hr and ft, etc.

Wait, the units for h would be Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). So let's make sure all the units are in the right terms.

So:

rho is 600 lbm/ft³.

Cp is 0.18 Btu/(lbm·°F).

V is 0.0005945 ft³.

A is 0.08658 ft².

t is 60 seconds, which is 60 s = 60/3600 hr = 1/60 hr.

So let's compute the denominator: A t = 0.08658 ft² * (1/60) hr = 0.001443 ft²·hr.

Numerator: (-ln(2/3)) * rho * V * Cp = 0.4055 * 600 lbm/ft³ * 0.0005945 ft³ * 0.18 Btu/(lbm·°F).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 600 lbm/ft³ * 0.0005945 ft³ = 600 * 0.0005945 = 0.3567 lbm.

Then, 0.3567 lbm * 0.18 Btu/(lbm·°F) = 0.0642 Btu/°F.

Multiply by 0.4055: 0.4055 * 0.0642 = 0.02603 Btu/°F.

So numerator is 0.02603 Btu/°F.

Denominator is 0.001443 ft²·hr.

So h = 0.02603 / 0.001443 ≈ 18.04 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 18.06, which is very close. So probably that's the answer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, calculating V and A again. The diameter is 0.33 inches, so radius is 0.165 inches. Convert to feet: 0.165 /12 = 0.01375 ft.

So V = π r² L, with L=1 ft. So r² is (0.01375)^2 = 0.00018906. V = π * 0.00018906 ≈ 0.0005945 ft³. That's correct.

A is 2πr L = 2 * π * 0.01375 * 1 ≈ 0.08658 ft². Correct.

So the numbers look right.

Wait, the time conversion: 60 seconds is 1/60 hours. So when using t in the formula, it's 1/60 hours.

Wait, the term (h A t) would have units of (Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)) * ft² * hr → Btu/°F. The denominator (rho V Cp) is (lbm/ft³ * ft³ * Btu/(lbm·°F)) ) → Btu/°F. So the ratio is unitless, as expected.

So the calculation for h is correct, giving approximately 18.04, which would match option A (18.06). So I think the answer is A.

To determine the average surface conductance per unit length of the rod, we use the lumped capacitance method. The rod's temperature changes from 50°F to 70°F in 60 seconds, and the surrounding air is at 110°F. The material properties are: thermal conductivity \( k = 300 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft·°F} \), density \( \rho = 600 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3 \), and specific heat \( C_p = 0.18 \, \text{Btu/lbm·°F} \). The rod's diameter is \( 0.33 \, \text{in} \), which is \( 0.0275 \, \text{ft} \), giving a radius \( r = 0.01375 \, \text{ft} \).

### Step 1: Lumped Capacitance Formula
The lumped capacitance method assumes uniform temperature within the rod. The temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T(t) - T_{\text{surr}}}{T_{\text{initial}} - T_{\text{surr}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{h A t}{\rho V C_p}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( T(t) = 70 \, \text{°F} \), \( T_{\text{surr}} = 110 \, \text{°F} \), \( T_{\text{initial}} = 50 \, \text{°F} \)
- \( A \) is the surface area per unit length, \( V \) is the volume per unit length, and \( t = 60 \, \text{s} = \frac{1}{60} \, \text{hr} \).

### Step 2: Calculate Surface Area and Volume
For a unit length (\( L = 1 \, \text{ft} \)):
- \( V = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.01375)^2 \approx 0.0005945 \, \text{ft}^3 \)
- \( A = 2 \pi r = 2 \pi (0.01375) \approx 0.08658 \, \text{ft}^2 \)

### Step 3: Solve for \( h \)
Rearranging the formula for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{-\ln\left(\frac{T(t) - T_{\text{surr}}}{T_{\text{initial}} - T_{\text{surr}}}\right) \cdot \rho V C_p}{A t}
\]

Substitute values:
- \( \frac{T(t) - T_{\text{surr}}}{T_{\text{initial}} - T_{\text{surr}}} = \frac{70 - 110}{50 - 110} = \frac{-40}{-60} = 0.6667 \)
- \( \ln(0.6667) \approx -0.4055 \), so \( -\ln(0.6667) = 0.4055 \)
- \( \rho V C_p = 600 \cdot 0.0005945 \cdot 0.18 \approx 0.0642 \, \text{Btu/°F} \)
- \( A t = 0.08658 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \approx 0.001443 \, \text{ft}^2 \cdot \text{hr} \)

\[
h = \frac{0.4055 \cdot 0.0642}{0.001443} \approx 18.04 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2 \cdot \text{°F}
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The closest value to \( 18.04 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2 \cdot \text{°F} \) is \( 18.06 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2 \cdot \text{°F} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
