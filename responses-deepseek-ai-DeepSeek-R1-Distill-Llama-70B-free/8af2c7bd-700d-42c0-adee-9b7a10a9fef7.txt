Question:

A woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden. Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?

Options:

A: The distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages.
B: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.
C: Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.
D: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, and the woman cannot seek restitution.
E: The distributor's performance was excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution.
F: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.
G: Both parties are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.
H: Both parties are not excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and either can recover from the other.
I: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contracts question. Let me read through it carefully. 

Alright, so there's a woman who wants a specific type of cymbidium orchid from Japan for her garden. She contacts a distributor who has connections in Japan. They sign a contract where the distributor agrees to get the plant, ship it, and plant it in her garden for $5,000. She pays $1,000 upfront, and the rest $4,000 upon planting. 

Then, two weeks later, the government bans importing cymbidiums because of a beetle that attacks citrus plants. So the distributor can't get the plant anymore. Now, the question is about the legal relationship between them. 

I remember that contract law has several doctrines that can excuse performance, like impossibility, impracticability, or supervening illegality. So I need to figure out which applies here. 

Impossibility is when performance becomes impossible due to unforeseen circumstances. Like if the specific plant was destroyed, maybe. But here, the issue is a government ban, not the plant being destroyed. So maybe it's not impossibility but something else.

Supervening illegality is when a law is passed after the contract is made that makes performance illegal. That seems to fit here because the government banned the import after the contract was signed. But I also remember that contracts can be illegal only if the contract itself was illegal from the start. Wait, no, that's initial illegality. Supervening illegality is when a change in the law after the contract makes it illegal. 

So, if the contract was legal when made but later became illegal, then the supervening illegality doctrine might apply. But I think that this doctrine doesn't automatically excuse performance. I remember something about whether the parties could have reasonably foreseen the change in law. If it's a total ban, maybe they couldn't have.

Wait, but in contract law, supervening illegality can be a defense if the law makes performance illegal. So if the government now prohibits importing cymbidiums, the distributor can't legally fulfill the contract. 

So the question is, does this supervening illegality excuse the distributor's performance? Or is it considered an impossibility? 

I think that impossibility is more about physical or factual impossibility, like destruction of the subject matter. Here, the plant isn't destroyed; it's just illegal to import. So it might fall under supervening illegality. 

Now, what's the effect of supervening illegality on the contract? If the contract becomes illegal, then it's terminated, and both parties are excused from performing. But I also remember that if the contract is merely made impossible by law, but not necessarily criminal, maybe the parties can still claim something. 

Wait, but if the law prohibits importation, then the distributor can't perform without breaking the law. So performance is illegal, which would make the contract voidable or terminated. 

In such cases, the parties are excused from performing. So the distributor doesn't have to perform, and the woman doesn't have to pay the remaining $4,000. But what about the $1,000 she already paid? Can she get that back? 

Restitution comes into play when one party has partly performed or paid. Since the contract is now impossible to perform due to the law, the woman might be able to recover her $1,000 under the doctrine of restitution to prevent unjust enrichment. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the options. Let me look at the options again. 

Option C says both parties are excused because of supervening illegality, and neither can recover. So she can't get her $1,000 back. 

Option E says the distributor is excused because of supervening illegality, and she can seek restitution. 

Option D says excused by impossibility, and she can't seek restitution. 

Option F says excused by impossibility, but she can seek restitution. 

Wait, but if it's supervening illegality, then the basis is different from impossibility. So if the correct reason is supervening illegality, then the options would relate to that. 

I think that the supervening illegality would discharge the contract. So both parties are excused. But regarding restitution, the woman already paid $1,000. So under the doctrine of restitution, she might get that back because the contract can't be fulfilled. 

So looking at the options, option E says the distributor's performance is excused because of supervening illegality, and the woman can seek restitution. 

Wait, but I thought that when a contract is discharged due to supervening illegality, the parties are excused, and any payments must be returned. So the woman should be able to get her $1,000 back. 

So which option matches that? Option E says the distributor is excused because of supervening illegality, and she can seek restitution. 

Alternatively, option C says both are excused, and neither can recover. That would mean she can't get her money back, which doesn't seem right. 

Wait, I think that when a contract is rescinded due to impossibility or illegality, any payments made are recoverable. So she should be able to get her $1,000 back. 

So the correct answer would be E: The distributor's performance was excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution.

Wait, but another thought: is the supervening illegality a recognized doctrine? Or is it more about impossibility? Because sometimes, courts might treat a government prohibition as making performance impossible. 

But impossibility usually refers to physical impossibility. Here, it's a legal impossibility. So perhaps the correct doctrine is supervening illegality. 

So, to recap: The contract becomes illegal after formation. So, the contract is discharged by supervening illegality. Both parties are excused from performance, and any partial payments should be returned. 

So the woman can get her $1,000 back through restitution. 

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Both excused, neither can recover. So she can't get her money back. That doesn't fit because she should be able to.

Option E: Distributor excused due to supervening illegality; woman can seek restitution. That fits.

Wait, but some sources say that when a contract is illegal, it's unenforceable, and any money paid can be recovered under restitution. So yes, she can get her money back. 

So the correct answer would be E.

The question revolves around a contract between a woman and a plant distributor for the importation and planting of a specific cymbidium orchid. The contract became impossible to fulfill due to a government ban on importing cymbidiums caused by the discovery of a beetle that adapted to using them for nesting. The legal issue is whether the distributor's performance is excused and whether the woman can recover the $1,000 she already paid.

Key considerations include the doctrines of impossibility and supervening illegality. Impossibility typically refers to factual or physical impossibility, such as the destruction of the subject matter. Here, the impossibility arises from a legal ban, making it a case of supervening illegality. Supervening illegality occurs when a change in the law after the contract is formed renders performance illegal. This doctrine generally excuses both parties from performing the contract.

However, restitution is available to recover payments made under a contract that is subsequently discharged due to supervening illegality. The woman should be able to recover the $1,000 she paid upfront. Among the options provided:

- **Option C** states that both parties are excused, and neither can recover, which would deny the woman restitution. This is inconsistent with the principle that payments made under a discharged contract should be recoverable.
- **Option E** correctly states that the distributor's performance is excused due to supervening illegality, and the woman can seek restitution for the $1,000.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: The distributor's performance was excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution.**
