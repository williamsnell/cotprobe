Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer and condensation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the rate of condensation of steam per foot of a condenser tube. The parameters given are the cooling water's temperature, the tube's dimensions, the steam pressure, thermal conductivity, and the inside and outside convective heat transfer coefficients.

Wait, the condenser tube has an outer diameter of 1 inch and an inner diameter of 0.90 inches. Oh right, so the wall thickness would be the difference between the outer and inner radii. But wait, actually, since diameter is twice the radius, the thickness is (1 - 0.90)/2 = 0.05 inches, which is 0.05/12 feet because we need everything in consistent units. So that's 0.0041667 feet.

The steam is at 3 inches Hg absolute pressure. I remember that steam tables relate pressure to saturation temperature. I'll need to find the temperature of the steam at this pressure. I think at 3 in Hg, the saturation temperature is around 60°F? Wait, wait, isn't 3 in Hg absolute a bit low. Let me think: standard atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi, which is about 29.92 inches Hg. So 3 inches Hg absolute is much lower than atmospheric. Hmm, so the saturation temperature must be lower. Wait, the cooling water is at 60°F. If the steam is condensing, its temperature must be higher than the cooling water because heat flows from higher to lower temperature. So the steam's saturation temperature must be higher than 60°F.

Wait, I should probably look up the saturation temperature for steam at 3 in Hg absolute. I think it's around 70°F or so. Wait, no, maybe lower. Let me try to recall. At 1 atm (14.7 psi), saturation is 212°F. At lower pressures, it's lower. Let me think, 3 in Hg is about 0.125 atm because 14.7 psi is about 29.92 in Hg, so 3/29.92 is approximately 0.1 atm. So maybe the saturation temperature is around 100°F? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because at lower pressures, the saturation temp is lower. Wait, no, wait: 3 in Hg absolute is about 3/29.92 ≈ 0.10 atm. So looking up steam tables, at 0.1 atm (which is about 1.45 in Hg vacuum), the saturation temperature is about 98.3°F? Or wait, maybe higher. Alternatively, maybe 3 in Hg is 60°F? Wait, I might need to calculate it exactly, but I don't have the exact values memorized.

Wait, the problem is giving the steam at 3 in Hg absolute. Let me think: 3 in Hg absolute is 3 inches of mercury above vacuum. So the corresponding saturation temperature would be lower than 212°F. I think it's about 140°F? Or maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct saturation temperature. Since I don't have a steam table in front of me, maybe the problem expects me to know that the saturation temperature is, say, 120°F? Or perhaps it's given elsewhere. Wait, maybe the question provides that, but I don't think so. Hmm, this is a problem because without the correct saturation temperature, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the cooling water is at 60°F, and the steam is condensing, so the saturation temp (T_sat) must be higher than 60°F. Let me think, perhaps 3 in Hg absolute is about 60°F. Wait, no, that can't be because at 60°F, the vapor pressure of water is lower. Let me think: at 60°F, the vapor pressure is about 0.25 atm, which is about 7.4 in Hg. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, the vapor pressure at 60°F is about 0.25 atm, which is approximately 3.68 inches Hg (since 1 atm is ~29.92 in). So if the steam is at 3 in Hg absolute, that's a higher pressure than 0.25 atm. Wait, no, 3 in Hg is higher than 3.68 in Hg? No, wait, 3 is less than 3.68. Oh wait, no, 3 in Hg is less than 3.68 in Hg. So that would mean that the saturation temperature is lower than 60°F. But that can't be right because the cooling water is at 60°F and the steam must be at a higher temperature to condense. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. At 3 in Hg absolute, is the temperature higher or lower than 60°F? Let's think: 1 atm is 29.92 in Hg. So 3 in Hg is about 0.1 atm. The saturation temperature at 0.1 atm is approximately 99.97°F, I think. Wait, no, because when pressure decreases, saturation temperature decreases. Wait, but 3 in Hg is higher than the vapor pressure at 60°F. Let me try to calculate it properly.

Wait, the vapor pressure (P_sat) at 60°F is about 0.25 atm absolute, which is 0.25 * 29.92 ≈ 7.48 in Hg. So if the steam is at 3 in Hg absolute, that's higher than 7.48 in Hg? No, wait: 3 in Hg is lower than 7.48. So 3 in Hg is lower pressure than the vapor pressure at 60°F. Hmm, that can't be, because if the steam is at 3 in Hg, which is lower than 7.48, which is the vapor pressure at 60°F, that would imply that the steam's saturation temp is lower than 60°F, which would mean it can't condense when in contact with 60°F water because heat would flow the wrong way. That can’t be right. So perhaps I'm getting the pressures wrong.

Wait, maybe the steam is at 3 in Hg gauge pressure. Oh, wait the question says absolute. So 3 in Hg absolute is 3 in Hg above vacuum. So 3 in Hg absolute would be lower than atmospheric. So the saturation temperature must be lower than 100°F, but higher than 60°F? Or maybe lower? Wait, if the cooling water is at 60°F, the steam must be at a higher temperature to cause condensation. So the saturation temperature of the steam must be higher than 60°F. So perhaps T_sat is higher than 60°F.

Wait, but according to vapor pressure tables, at 60°F, the vapor pressure is about 0.25 atm, which is about 7.48 in Hg. So if the steam is at 3 in Hg absolute, that's 3 in Hg above vacuum, so the pressure is lower than 7.48 in Hg. That would imply T_sat is lower than 60°F. But that can't be, because then the steam would be colder than the cooling water, and condensation wouldn't occur. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the pressure.

Wait, perhaps the question actually means 3 in Hg gauge pressure. In that case, the absolute pressure would be 3 + 29.92 = 32.92 in Hg. But the question says 'absolute' so that's not it. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed without the exact T_sat and see if I can figure it out. Let me think about the formula for heat transfer in this scenario.

When steam condenses on the outside of a tube, the heat transfer is from the steam through the tube to the cooling water. The overall heat transfer coefficient (U) can be calculated considering the resistances in series: the convective resistance on the outside (steam side), the conduction through the tube wall, and the convective resistance on the inside (water side). 

So the formula is 1/U = 1/h_outer + (ln(OD/ID))/(2πkL) + 1/h_inner, but wait, no, correct formula: the overall heat transfer coefficient is based on the outside area. Wait, I think the correct formula is 1/(U_o) = 1/h_o + (ln(OD/ID))/(2πkL) + (ID/OD) * (1/h_i). Because when using the outside area as reference, the inside convective resistance is adjusted by the ratio of the diameters.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express the overall heat transfer coefficient based on the inside surface. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the overall U based on the outside surface area, which would affect the formula.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the thermal resistances. The heat transfer rate Q is given by Q = U * A * ΔT, where ΔT is the temperature difference. But to find U, I need to consider all the resistances.

The resistances in series are:

1. Convection on the outside (steam side): R1 = 1/(h_o * A_o)
2. Conduction through the tube wall: R2 = ln(OD/ID)/(2πkL)
3. Convection on the inside (water side): R3 = 1/(h_i * A_i)

But since these are in series, the total resistance R_total = R1 + R2 + R3.

Wait, but the areas A_o and A_i are different because the diameters are different. For a tube, the outside area is πD_o L, and the inside area is πD_i L.

So the overall heat transfer coefficient U is based on either the outside or inside area. Let's pick the outside area for U. Then,

1/U = (1/h_o) + (ln(D_o/D_i)/(2k)) * (1/(π D_o L)) )^{-1} ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the correct formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient when considering outside area is:

1/U_o = 1/h_o + (D_o ln(D_o/D_i))/(2k) + (D_o/D_i)(1/h_i)

Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me check the units. Each term should be in 1/(Btu/hr-ft²-°F). So:

- The first term, 1/h_o, is correct.
- The second term: (D_o ln(D_o/D_i))/(2k). D_o is in feet, ln is dimensionless, k is Btu/hr-ft-°F. So (ft * 1)/(Btu/hr-ft-°F) → ft²-°F/(Btu/hr). Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, the thermal resistance for conduction is (ln(D_o/D_i))/(2πkL). So R_cond = ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πkL). So if we're expressing U based on the outside area, which is π D_o L, then R_total = R_o + R_cond + R_i.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express each resistance per unit length (since the problem asks for per foot).

So, considering per foot length (L=1 ft):

- The outside surface area per foot is π D_o * 1 ft.
- The inside surface area per foot is π D_i * 1 ft.

But when calculating the overall U based on the outside area, the inside convective resistance must be adjusted by the ratio of the inside to outside areas.

So, the formula is:

1/U_o = 1/h_o + (ln(D_o/D_i))/(2k) + (D_i/D_o)(1/h_i)

Wait, that makes sense. Because the inside convective resistance is scaled by (D_i/D_o), which accounts for the different areas.

So let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

D_o = 1 inch = 1/12 ft = 0.08333 ft
D_i = 0.90 inches = 0.90/12 = 0.075 ft
h_o (steam side) = 1400 Btu/hr-ft²-°F
h_i (water side) = 250 Btu/hr-ft²-°F
k = 70 Btu/hr-ft-°F

Wait, but wait, is h_o the steam side correct? Because the problem states that the inside and outside convective heat transfer coefficients are 250 and 1400, respectively. Wait, inside is 250, which is the cooling water side, and outside is 1400, the steam side.

So h_o = 1400, h_i =250.

Now, calculate each term:

1/h_o = 1/1400 ≈ 0.0007143 hr-ft²-°F/Btu

ln(D_o/D_i) = ln(0.08333/0.075) = ln(1.1111) ≈ 0.10536

So (ln(D_o/D_i))/(2k) = 0.10536/(2*70) = 0.10536/140 ≈ 0.0007525 hr-ft²-°F/Btu

(D_i/D_o) * (1/h_i) = (0.075/0.08333) * (1/250) ≈ (0.9) * 0.004 → 0.0036. Wait, 0.075/0.08333 is 0.9 exactly. So 0.9 * (1/250) = 0.9/250 = 0.0036 hr-ft²-°F/Btu.

Wait, but wait, the term is (D_i/D_o)(1/h_i), which is (0.075/0.08333) * (1/250) = 0.9 * 0.004 = 0.0036.

So adding all three terms:

1/U_o = 0.0007143 + 0.0007525 + 0.0036 = 0.0050668 hr-ft²-°F/Btu

So U_o = 1 / 0.0050668 ≈ 197.43 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, but wait, isn't that a bit low? Because the individual h's are 1400 and 250, so the overall should be somewhere between them, but closer to the lower one. Hmm. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the terms:

1/h_o = 1/1400 ≈ 0.0007143

ln(D_o/D_i) = ln(1/0.9) → wait, D_o is 1 inch, D_i 0.9 inches, so D_o/D_i = 1.1111. So ln(1.1111)= approx 0.10536. Correct.

(ln(D_o/D_i))/(2k) → 0.10536/(2*70)=0.10536/140≈0.0007525.

(D_i/D_o)=0.9, so 0.9*(1/250)= 0.0036.

Adding: 0.0007143 + 0.0007525 = 0.0014668 + 0.0036 = 0.0050668. So 1/U_o is 0.0050668, so U_o ≈ 197.43 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. That seems correct.

Now, the heat transfer rate Q (per foot) is U_o * A_o * ΔT.

A_o is the outside surface area per foot: π * D_o * L. Since L=1 ft, A_o = π * (1/12) ft → approx 0.2618 ft².

Wait, D_o is 1 inch, which is 1/12 ft. So A_o = π * (1/12) * 1 ft ≈ 0.2618 ft².

ΔT is the temperature difference between the steam and the cooling water. But what's the steam's temperature? The problem says steam is at 3 in Hg absolute. I think I need to find the saturation temperature here.

Wait, earlier I thought that 3 in Hg absolute is lower than 60°F, but that can't be right because the cooling water is at 60°F and steam must be hotter. So perhaps I have a mistake in the pressure units.

Wait, maybe I should look up the saturation temperature for steam at 3 in Hg absolute. Let me think: 3 in Hg absolute is 3 inches of mercury above vacuum, which is 3/29.92 ≈ 0.1003 atm.

From steam tables, the saturation temperature at 0.1 atm is approximately 99.97°F, but wait, that's higher than 60°F, which makes sense. So T_steam = 100°F (approx), T_water =60°F, so ΔT =100-60=40°F.

Wait, but let me confirm: at 3 in Hg absolute, the saturation temp is about 100°F. So ΔT is 40°F.

So Q = U_o * A_o * ΔT = 197.43 * 0.2618 *40.

Calculate that:

197.43 * 0.2618 ≈ 197.43 * 0.26 ≈ 51.333, but more accurately: 197.43 * 0.2618 ≈ 197.43 *0.2=39.486, 197.43*0.06=11.846, 197.43*0.0018≈0.355. So total ≈ 39.486 +11.846=51.332 +0.355≈51.687 Btu/hr-ft.

Then Q=51.687 *40=2067.48 Btu/hr per foot.

But wait, that's the heat transfer rate. But the question asks for the rate of condensation of steam, which is the mass flow rate.

The latent heat of vaporization (h_fg) at 3 in Hg absolute (which is 100°F) is needed. From steam tables, at 100°F, h_fg is approximately 1037.8 Btu/lbm.

So the mass flow rate m = Q / h_fg.

So m = 2067.48 Btu/hr-ft / 1037.8 Btu/lbm → approx 1.992 lbm/hr-ft.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 2.0 exactly, but let's see. The options are:

A:2.78, B:3.28, C:2.58, D:2.88, E:2.38, F:3.08, G:2.98, H:3.18, I:2.48, J:2.68.

Hmm
