Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically regarding what a defendant charged with first-degree murder is entitled to concerning prospective jurors. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about when a defendant should be furnished with a list of names and addresses of all prospective jurors. The options are from A to J, each presenting a different condition or scenario.

First, I remember that in the United States, the legal system has certain rules about jury selection and the rights of the defendant. I think the general idea is that the defendant has a right to know who their jurors might be to ensure a fair trial, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, I recall that there's a case called Turner v. Louisiana, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Oh, right, the more relevant case might be the one where the Supreme Court held that the defendant doesn't have an automatic right to the list of prospective jurors unless certain conditions are met. I'm trying to remember... Oh, yes, it was in a case where the defendant was charged with a capital offense, like first-degree murder, and the Court said that the defendant should have access to the jury list upon request.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Another thought: the rule might be that the defendant is entitled to the list upon request without needing to show cause. Or is it that they have to show good cause? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let me try to break it down. I think that under the Federal Rules, the defendant can request the list of prospective jurors, but maybe there's a requirement to show good cause. Or perhaps it's more about the timingâ€”like when the defendant is required to be given the list.

Wait, another angle: I remember that in some states, the defendant is automatically provided with the list without needing to ask, but in others, they have to make a request. But the question is about the general rule, so probably federal.

Wait, there's a specific rule under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Let me try to recall: Rule 24 deals with the jury. Oh, right, Rule 24(b) allows the court to allow the defendant and the attorney to inspect the jury list, but I think it's upon request.

Wait, no, maybe it's upon request but not automatically. So the defendant would have to make a request to the court to get the list. Looking at the options, option H is "upon request," which would fit if that's the rule.

But wait, another point: in some cases, the court might require the defendant to show good cause before releasing the list. So maybe they can't just request it; they have to show why they need it. But I'm not sure how that applies in first-degree murder cases.

Wait, the Supreme Court case I'm trying to remember is probably Irvin v. Dowd, but that's about juror bias, not the list. Another case, I think, is Coppedge v. United States, but that might be about the right to challenge jurors.

Alternatively, maybe it's about pretrial publicity and the need for individual voir dire. Wait, that's a different issue.

Wait, I think the answer is that the defendant is entitled to the list upon request. So looking at the options, option H is "upon request." But then I recall that sometimes the court might require a showing of good cause, which would make option C the correct answer. Wait, which is it?

Wait, I think the rule is that the defendant is entitled to the list of prospective jurors upon request, without necessarily having to show cause. So the correct option would be H: upon request.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. Under the Federal Rules, the court may provide the list upon request, but I think it's not an absolute right. So maybe the court has discretion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct answer is H: upon request. Because I recall that in some cases, the court must provide the list when the defendant requests it, especially in serious cases like first-degree murder, to ensure the defendant can adequately prepare for jury selection.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C: upon request and showing of good cause. Because the court might require the defendant to show why they need the list, perhaps to prevent abuse or protect juror privacy.

Hmm, how do I decide between H and C? Let me try to recall a specific case or rule. I think in the case of first-degree murder, where the stakes are high, the defendant's right to a fair trial requires access to the jury list, so the court would allow it upon request.

Wait, but isn't the general rule that the defendant can request the list, and the court must provide it? So that would make H the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe it's not automatic, and the defendant has to show good cause. But I'm not sure which applies here.

Wait, I think in federal courts, under Rule 24(b), the court may permit the parties to inspect the jury list. So it's up to the court's discretion, but the defendant can request it. So perhaps the answer is H: upon request.

But wait, another thought: maybe the defendant is automatically furnished the list without having to request. But I don't think that's the case. I think the defendant has to make a request, but once they do, the court provides it.

Alternatively, some states have different rules. But the question doesn't specify state or federal, so I'll assume it's a general principle.

Wait, I'm getting stuck between H and C. Let me think again. If the correct answer is that the defendant can get the list upon request without needing to show cause, then H is correct. If they need to show cause, then C is correct.

I think in some jurisdictions, the list is provided upon request, but in others, a showing of good cause is required. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think in federal cases, the rule is that the defendant is entitled to the list upon request, so H would be correct. But maybe in state cases, it varies.

Since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is H. Alternatively, if the correct answer is that the court orders it, which would be option D.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach it differently. The question is about first-degree murder, which is a capital offense. In such cases, the defendant's rights are more stringently protected.

I think that in such cases, the defendant is entitled to the list upon request, without needing to show cause, to allow for effective voir dire and ensure an impartial jury. So the answer would be H: upon request.

Wait, but I also remember that in some cases, the court might require a showing of good cause, especially if there are concerns about juror safety or privacy. But in the absence of such concerns, the list is provided upon request.

So, perhaps the correct answer is H: upon request. Therefore, the answer is H.

The question concerns the entitlement of a defendant charged with first-degree murder to a list of names and addresses of prospective jurors. The analysis revolves around the legal rules governing this entitlement, particularly in the context of federal criminal procedure and relevant case law.

The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, specifically Rule 24(b), suggest that the court may permit the defendant to inspect the jury list. This implies that the defendant typically must make a request for the list. The key debate is whether the defendant can obtain the list simply upon request (option H) or if they must also show good cause (option C). 

While there are scenarios where courts might require a showing of good cause, particularly for privacy or safety concerns, the general rule in serious cases like first-degree murder tends to favor providing the list upon request. This ensures the defendant can prepare adequately for jury selection and uphold their right to a fair trial. 

Given this reasoning, the most appropriate answer is that the defendant is entitled to the list upon request.

Answer: H
