Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. A particle with a mass of 1.0 grams is released near Earth's surface. The acceleration due to gravity is given as 8.91 m/s². I need to find its kinetic energy after 1.0 second, ignoring air resistance. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that when an object is in free fall near Earth's surface, it accelerates downward at g. So the particle will be speeding up as time passes. Since it's released, the initial velocity is zero, and after 1 second, it should have some velocity which I can calculate.

The first thing I should find is the velocity after 1 second. Oh right, because velocity under constant acceleration is given by v = u + a*t. Here, u is initial velocity, which is 0. So v = a*t. So v = 8.91 m/s² * 1 s. That gives v = 8.91 m/s.

Wait, but wait. The mass is given in grams. Oh, right, I should convert that to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kg. 1.0 g is 0.001 kg. Oh yeah, important step. So m = 0.001 kg.

Now, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So plugging in the numbers: KE = 0.5 * 0.001 kg * (8.91)^2. Let me calculate that.

First, square 8.91. Let me think: 8 squared is 64, and 0.91 squared is about 0.8281. But wait, actually 8.91 is approximately 8.9. Let me compute 8.91 * 8.91. 

Wait, 8.91 * 8 is 71.28. 8.91 * 0.91 is approximately 8.11. Hmm, wait that might not be the right approach. Let me compute it more accurately.

8.91 * 8.91: 

Let me break it down. (8 + 0.91)^2. So that's 8^2 + 2*8*0.91 + 0.91^2. 

8^2 is 64. 2*8*0.91 is 16 * 0.91 = 14.56. 0.91^2 is 0.8281. Adding them up: 64 +14.56=78.56, plus 0.8281 gives 79.3881. So approximately 79.39 m²/s².

Wait, but wait, maybe I should just multiply. 8.91 times 8.91:

8.91 * 8 = 71.28

8.91 * 0.91: Let's compute 8 *0.91=7.28, 0.91*0.91=0.8281. So 7.28 +0.8281=8.1081. So 71.28 +8.1081 is 79.3881. Yes, same as before.

So (8.91)^2 = 79.3881.

So KE = 0.5 * 0.001 kg * 79.3881 (m²/s²). Let's compute that.

0.5 *0.001 is 0.0005. Multiply by 79.3881: 0.0005 *79.3881 = 0.03969405 J. Oh wait, because 1 Joule is 1 kg m²/s², so the units check out.

But wait, the options are in millijoules. Oh right! Because 1 mJ is 0.001 J. So 0.03969405 J equals 39.69405 mJ. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest I see is option A:36 mJ, B:30, C:54, etc. Wait, did I do the calculations correctly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me double-check.

So the velocity after 1 second is v = g*t = 8.91 m/s² *1 s = 8.91 m/s. That part is correct.

Then, KE is (1/2)mv². m is 0.001 kg.

So plugging in: (0.5) * (0.001) * (8.91)^2.

Wait, let me compute (8.91)^2 again just to be precise.

8.91 *8.91:

Let me compute 8.91 *8.91.

Calculate 8.91 multiplied by 8. Let's see, 8 *8 is 64, 8 *0.91 is 7.28, so 64 +7.28 =71.28.

Then 8.91 *0.91. Let me compute that separately.

Compute 8 *0.91 =7.28, and 0.91 *0.91=0.8281. So 7.28 +0.8281=8.1081.

So when you multiply 8.91 by 8.91, it's (8.91 *8) + (8.91 *0.91) =71.28 +8.1081=79.3881. So that's correct.

So KE is 0.5 *0.001 *79.3881 = (0.0005) *79.3881.

Calculating 79.3881 *0.0005.

Hmm, 79.3881 * 0.0005 is the same as 79.3881 divided by 2000.

Wait, 79.3881 /2000 equals approximately 0.03969405 J. Which is 39.694 mJ.

Looking at the options, I don't see 39.69 mJ. The closest are A:36, B:30, H:48, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the velocity. Oh, wait! Wait a second—wait, no. Because the acceleration is 8.91 m/s², so after 1 second, velocity is 8.91 m/s. That's correct.

So the KE is 0.5 *0.001 kg * (8.91)^2. Wait, maybe I can compute it differently.

Wait, 0.001 kg is 1 gram. So 1/2 *1g *v². Wait, but grams won't work with SI units. So I have to use kg.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the kinetic energy in another way.

Wait, another approach: since the object is in free fall, the kinetic energy after time t is (1/2) m (gt)^2.

Because v=gt, so KE = (1/2) m g² t².

So plugging in the numbers: m=0.001 kg, g=8.91 m/s², t=1 s.

So KE = 0.5 *0.001 * (8.91)^2 * (1)^2.

Which is same as before, 0.5 *0.001 *79.3881. So 0.03969 J, which is 39.69 mJ.

Hmm, so the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:36 mJ

B:30 mJ

C:54

D:24

E:18

F:72

G:9

H:48

I:60

J:12.

So none of the options match 39.69, which is approximately 40 mJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong value of g. Oh, wait, in the question, g is given as 8.91 m/s². Oh, that's correct. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong mass. The question states 1.0 grams, which is 0.001 kg. Correct.

Hmm. Let me re-calculate the KE.

0.5 *0.001 kg is 0.0005 kg.

Multiply by (8.91)^2: which is 79.3881.

So 0.0005 *79.3881 = 0.03969 J =39.69 mJ.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:36 mJ. But that's not very close. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the particle's velocity after one second is 9.8 m/s if we use g=9.8 m/s². But the question gives g as 8.91, so perhaps the intended calculation uses that exact value.

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation in the square.

Wait, 8.91 squared is indeed approximately 79.38, yes.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in different terms. Let me think about units again.

Wait, maybe I should compute the kinetic energy in another way, perhaps using the equation KE = mgh, but wait, that's when you have a height. Here, I don't know the height after 1 second, so that might not be applicable.

Wait, but I can compute the distance fallen in 1 second and then use mgh, but I think that would give the same result as the method I used earlier.

So, let me try that method. So, the height fallen under gravity after time t is given by h = 0.5 g t².

So h = 0.5 *8.91 * (1)^2 = 4.455 meters.

Then, KE = m g h.

So KE = 0.001 kg *8.91 m/s² *4.455 m.

Calculating that. 0.001 *8.91=0.00891. 0.00891 *4.455.

Let me compute that:

4.455 *0.00891.

4 *0.00891=0.03564.

0.455 *0.00891: Let's compute 0.4 *0.00891=0.003564, 0.055 *0.00891= approximately 0.000489.

So 0.003564 +0.000489=0.004053.

So total is 0.03564 +0.004053=0.039693 J, same as before. So KE is 39.693 mJ.

So again, same result. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Oh, velocity after 1 second is v=gt=8.91 m/s. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for something else, like momentum? No, the question is about kinetic energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered air resistance, but the question says to ignore it, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think: KE = (1/2)mv². Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the square of 8.91. Let me compute 8.91 *8.91 again.

Compute 8 *8 =64.

8 *0.91=7.28.

0.91*8=7.28.

0.91 *0.91=0.8281.

So (a+b)^2 = a² +2ab +b². a=8, b=0.91.

So 8² =64.

2ab=2*8*0.91=14.56.

b²=0.8281.

Adding them: 64 +14.56=78.56 +0.8281=79.3881.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. So I think the calculation is correct, but the options don't include 39.69 mJ. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the question says the mass is 1.0 grams, which is 0.001 kg. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy using the velocity after 1 second as 9.8 m/s, using the more standard g value, but the question gives g as 8.91, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the time is 1 second, but maybe I should consider the velocity is 9.8 m/s, but that doesn't align with the given g.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the square of 8.91. Let me compute 8.91 *8.91 using another method.

Let me compute 8.91 *8.91:

8.91
x8.91
--------

Multiply 8.91 by 1: 891.

Multiply 8.91 by 80 (since the second digit is 8 in the tens place): 8.91 *80=712.8.

Multiply 8.91 by 0.9 (since the third digit is 9 in the tenths place): 8.91*0.9=8.019.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 8.91 *8.91:

Compute 8*8=64, 8*0.91=7.28, 0.91*8=7.28, 0.91*0.91=0.8281. So adding all parts: 64 +7.28 +7.28 +0.8281 = 64+14.56=78.56 +0.8281=79.3881.

Yes, same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is 36 mJ, but why? Let me see. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Oh wait, 1 gram is 0.001 kg, but perhaps the question says 1.0 kg, but no, it says grams.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the KE in a different way. Let me try using the formula KE = (1/2) m v².

Wait, m=0.001 kg, v=8.91 m/s.

So (0.001 kg) * (8.91)^2 = 0.001 *79.3881 = 0.0793881 kg·m²/s².

Multiply by 0.5: 0.03969405 J, which is 39.694 mJ.

Hmm. So I'm getting approximately 39.7 mJ, but the options are A:36, which is 36. Maybe I should re-examine the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial velocity. Oh wait, no, initial velocity is zero because it's released, so v=gt is correct.

Wait, maybe the time is 1 second, but perhaps I should consider using the equation of motion for velocity, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should try using a different g value. Oh, the question specifies g=8.91 m/s², so I have to use that.

Wait, let me think again about the options. Maybe I did the calculation right, but perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is 1 kg, but the question says grams. Hmm, that would make KE much larger. For example, 1 kg * (8.91)^2 *0.5 = 0.5 *1 *79.3881 =39.694 J, which is 39694 mJ, which isn't even near the options. So that can't be.

Wait another thing: perhaps I'm using the wrong exponent. Let me see: 0.001 kg is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 0.5 *0.001. 0.5 *0.001 is 0.0005. So 0.0005 kg.

Multiply by 79.3881: 0.0005 *79.3881 = 0.03969405 J.

So 0.03969405 J is 39.69405 mJ.

Looking at the options, none is exactly 39.7, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try an alternative approach: perhaps using the equation KE = mgh.

So h is the height fallen in 1 second. h=0.5 *g *t². So h = 0.5 *8.91 *1 =4.455 m.

Then KE = mgh =0.001 kg *8.91 m/s² *4.455 m.

So 0.001 *8.91 =0.00891.

0.00891 *4.455: Let me compute that.

4 *0.00891 =0.03564.

0.455 *0.00891: Let's compute 0.4*0.00891=0.003564, 0.055 *0.00891=0.00049005.

Adding 0.003564 +0.00049005=0.00405405.

So total is 0.03564 +0.00405405=0.03969405 J, same as before.

So KE is 39.694 mJ.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the question. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says the mass is 1.0 grams, which is correct. It says g=8.91, which I used. Time is 1.0 seconds. So all correct.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the intended answer is A:36 mJ, but that would be if, perhaps, the square of g was taken as 81 instead of 79.3881.

Wait, wait, if someone mistakenly uses g=9 m/s², then v=9 m/s after 1 second. Then KE would be 0.5 *0.001 *81=0.0405 J, which is 40.5 mJ. Still not matching any option exactly, but closer to 40.5.

Wait, but none of the options have 40.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 0.5 *0.001 * (8.91)^2 again.

0.5 *0.001 =0.0005.

(8.91)^2=79.3881.

0.0005 *79.3881=0.03969405 J.

So 39.694 mJ.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is 36 mJ, but I don't see how that's possible unless I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use g=9.8 m/s², but even then, let me compute:

If g=9.8 m/s², then v=9.8 m/s after 1 second.

KE=0.5 *0.001 * (9.8)^2.

(9.8)^2
