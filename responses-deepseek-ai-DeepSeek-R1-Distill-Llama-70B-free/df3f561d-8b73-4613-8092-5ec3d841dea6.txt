Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these quadratic equations and their roots. 

The problem says: Let x₁ and x₂ be the roots of the equation x² + 3x + 1 = 0. I need to compute the expression (x₁/(x₂ + 1))² + (x₂/(x₁ + 1))². The options are given as A through J, and I need to select the correct answer.

First, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product is c/a. So in this case, the equation is x² +3x +1 =0, which means a=1, b=3, c=1.

So, sum of roots x₁ + x₂ = -b/a = -3/1 = -3.

Product of roots x₁x₂ = c/a = 1/1 = 1.

Alright, so x₁ + x₂ = -3 and x₁x₂ = 1. Got that down.

Now, the expression I need to compute is [(x₁)/(x₂ +1)]² + [(x₂)/(x₁ +1)]². Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about how to simplify this.

I think expanding each term might help. Let me write each term separately.

First term: (x₁/(x₂ +1))² = x₁² / (x₂ +1)².

Second term: (x₂/(x₁ +1))² = x₂² / (x₁ +1)².

So the sum is [x₁²/(x₂+1)^2] + [x₂²/(x₁+1)^2]. 

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this by combining the terms or finding a common denominator. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of x₁ + x₂ and x₁x₂, which I already know.

Another approach: Let me consider combining the two fractions. The denominators are (x₂+1)^2 and (x₁+1)^2. Not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe cross-multiplying to find a common denominator.

Alternatively, maybe I can write it as [x₁²(x₁ +1)^2 + x₂²(x₂ +1)^2 ] / [(x₂+1)^2 (x₁+1)^2]. That might be more complicated, but perhaps expanding the numerator will help.

Wait, maybe I can simplify each term before adding. Let me try manipulating each fraction.

Looking at x₁/(x₂ +1). Since x₂ is a root of the equation, x₂² +3x₂ +1=0. So x₂² = -3x₂ -1. Maybe I can use this to express higher powers of x in terms of lower ones. But not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write each denominator in terms of the other root. Let's see: the denominator is x₂ +1. Since x₁ + x₂ = -3, x₂ = -3 -x₁. So x₂ +1 = (-3 -x₁) +1 = -2 -x₁. So the denominator becomes (-2 -x₁). Similarly, x₁ +1 would be (-3 -x₂) +1, wait no, wait, x₁ = -3 -x₂.

Wait, maybe I can substitute x₂ in terms of x₁.

So denominator x₂ +1 = (-3 -x₁) +1 = -2 -x₁.

So the first term becomes x₁ / (-2 -x₁) squared. Similarly, the second term becomes x₂ / (-2 -x₂) squared.

Wait, but that might not be the best approach. Let me think differently.

Another idea: Let me compute the sum S = (x₁/(x₂ +1))² + (x₂/(x₁ +1))².

Maybe I can express this as (x₁² (x₁ +1)^2 + x₂² (x₂ +1)^2 ) / [ (x₂+1)^2 (x₁+1)^2 ) ].

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each fraction separately and then add.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express the entire expression in terms of symmetric sums of x₁ and x₂, which I can compute using the sum and product.

Let me think: Let me denote A = x₁/(x₂ +1), B = x₂/(x₁ +1). Then S = A² + B² = (A + B)^2 - 2AB.

So, S = (A + B)^2 - 2AB.

Maybe computing A + B and AB would be easier.

So, compute A + B = x₁/(x₂ +1) + x₂/(x₁ +1).

Let me compute A + B first.

A + B = [x₁(x₁ +1) + x₂(x₂ +1)] / [ (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) ]

Wait, no. To add the two fractions, the denominator is (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1), and the numerator is x₁(x₁ +1) + x₂(x₂ +1). Let me compute that.

Numerator: x₁(x₁ +1) + x₂(x₂ +1) = x₁² + x₁ + x₂² + x₂.

We can write this as (x₁² + x₂²) + (x₁ + x₂).

We know x₁ + x₂ = -3, so that part is easy.

What about x₁² + x₂²? I remember that x₁² + x₂² = (x₁ + x₂)^2 - 2x₁x₂.

So, (x₁ + x₂)^2 is (-3)^2 =9, subtract 2x₁x₂ which is 2*1=2. So x₁² + x₂² = 9 -2 =7.

So the numerator becomes 7 + (-3) =4.

Now the denominator is (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) = x₁x₂ + x₁ + x₂ +1.

We know x₁x₂=1, x₁ +x₂=-3. So substituting:

1 + (-3) +1 = (1 +1) + (-3) = 2 -3 = -1.

So denominator is -1.

So A + B = numerator / denominator = 4 / (-1) = -4.

Wait, wait, no: denominator is (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) = x₁x₂ +x₁ +x₂ +1.

Which is 1 + (-3) +1 = -1, correct. So (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) = -1.

Therefore, A + B = 4 / (-1) = -4.

Now, compute AB.

AB = [x₁/(x₂ +1)] * [x₂/(x₁ +1)] = (x₁x₂) / [ (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) ) ].

We already know x₁x₂=1, and denominator is (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) = -1 as computed earlier.

So AB = 1 / (-1 )= -1.

So now, S = (A + B)^2 - 2AB = (-4)^2 - 2*(-1) = 16 +2 = 18.

Wait, that gives 18, which is option D.

But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, A + B: numerator is x₁² +x₂² +x₁ +x₂.

x₁² +x₂² =7, x₁ +x₂=-3, so 7 -3=4. Denominator is (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) =1 + (-3) +1= -1. So 4/-1 =-4. Correct.

AB: (x₁x₂) / [(x₂ +1)(x₁ +1)] =1 / (-1 )= -1. Correct.

Then, S = (-4)^2 -2*(-1) = 16 +2 =18. So the answer is 18, which is option D.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0\) has roots \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). Using Vieta's formulas, we know:

- The sum of the roots: \(x_1 + x_2 = -3\),
- The product of the roots: \(x_1x_2 = 1\).

We are tasked with computing the expression:

\[
S = \left(\frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1}\right)^2.
\]

To simplify this, we use the identity \(S = (A + B)^2 - 2AB\), where \(A = \frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1}\) and \(B = \frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1}\).

### Step 1: Compute \(A + B\)
\[
A + B = \frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1} + \frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1}.
\]
To add these fractions, we find a common denominator:

\[
A + B = \frac{x_1(x_1 + 1) + x_2(x_2 + 1)}{(x_2 + 1)(x_1 + 1)}.
\]
Expanding the numerator:

\[
x_1(x_1 + 1) + x_2(x_2 + 1) = x_1^2 + x_1 + x_2^2 + x_2.
\]
Using the identity \(x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2\), we substitute:

\[
x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (-3)^2 - 2(1) = 9 - 2 = 7.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
7 + (-3) = 4.
\]
The denominator is:

\[
(x_2 + 1)(x_1 + 1) = x_1x_2 + x_1 + x_2 + 1 = 1 + (-3) + 1 = -1.
\]
Therefore:

\[
A + B = \frac{4}{-1} = -4.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(AB\)
\[
AB = \left(\frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1}\right)\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1}\right) = \frac{x_1x_2}{(x_2 + 1)(x_1 + 1)}.
\]
We already know \(x_1x_2 = 1\) and \((x_2 + 1)(x_1 + 1) = -1\), so:

\[
AB = \frac{1}{-1} = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(S\)
Using the identity \(S = (A + B)^2 - 2AB\), we substitute:

\[
S = (-4)^2 - 2(-1) = 16 + 2 = 18.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

**D: 18.0**

The last character of the response is **D**.
