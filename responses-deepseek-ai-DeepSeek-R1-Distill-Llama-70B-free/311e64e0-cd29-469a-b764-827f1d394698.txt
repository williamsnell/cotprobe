Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the net price of a reclining chair after a trade discount. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the list price is given as $635, and there's a trade discount of 16%. I think the trade discount is the percentage that's subtracted from the list price to get the net price. So, I need to calculate 16% of $635 and then subtract that from $635 to find the net price.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. Trade discounts are usually subtracted from the list price, right? So the formula should be Net Price = List Price × (1 - discount rate). Or, another way is List Price minus (List Price × discount rate). Both methods should give the same result.

So, let me compute the discount amount first. 16% of $635. Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this. To find 16% of 635, I can convert 16% to decimal, which is 0.16, and then multiply by 635.

Calculating that: 635 × 0.16. Let me do this step by step. 600 × 0.16 is 96, and 35 × 0.16 is 5.6. So adding those together, 96 +5.6 is 101.6. So the discount is $101.60.

Now, subtract that discount from the list price to get the net price. So, $635 - $101.60 equals... Let me subtract. 635 minus 100 is 535, and then subtract another 1.60, which gives $533.40.

Looking at the options, option E is $533.40, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. So 635 multiplied by 0.16 again. Let's break it down differently. 635 × 0.1 is 63.5, and 635 × 0.06 is 38.1. Adding those together: 63.5 +38.1 is 101.6. Yep, that's the same as before. So subtracting 101.6 from 635 gives 533.40. So yes, option E is correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward calculation once I remember the formula correctly.

The net price is calculated by subtracting the trade discount from the list price. The list price is $635, and the trade discount is 16%. 

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 635 \times 0.16 = 101.60
\]

Then, subtract the discount from the list price to find the net price:
\[
\text{Net Price} = 635 - 101.60 = 533.40
\]

The correct answer is **E: $533.40**.
