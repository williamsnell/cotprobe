Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about biocentrism, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by breaking down the question and the options.

The question is asking what biocentrism is. From what I remember, biocentrism is a philosophical view, specifically an ethical stance. It's related to how we consider the moral standing of different entities. So, biocentrism must have something to do with the value of life or living beings.

Looking at the options, they all talk about direct moral standing, which I think refers to the idea that something has intrinsic value and should be considered in moral decisions. For example, if something has direct moral standing, we have moral obligations towards it.

Option A says ecosystems are the primary bearers because of their functional integrity. That sounds more like ecocentrism, where the focus is on ecosystems rather than individual organisms.

Option B claims only humans have direct moral standing. That's anthropocentrism, right? Because it's centered on humans.

Option C suggests individual species are primary. I'm not too sure, but I think species might be more about biodiversity, maybe not the core of biocentrism.

Option D says only beings that feel pain have standing. That's more like the utilitarian view, where sentience or the ability to feel pain matters, but I don't think that's biocentrism.

Option E states all beings, because they exist, have standing. That seems broader, maybe more like a universal view, but I'm not certain if biocentrism includes non-living things.

Option F is about consciousness. Again, that feels more like a sentience-based approach rather than biocentrism.

Option G says only humans and animals. That might be a mix of anthropocentrism and zoocentrism, but not exactly biocentrism.

Option H mentions all and only sentient creatures. Sentient usually means capable of feeling, so again, this seems related to the ability to feel, not just being alive.

Option I says all living beings because they're living. This rings a bell. Biocentrism, as I recall, emphasizes that all life has inherent value. So it's not just about humans or animals, but every living thing.

Option J includes all beings, living or non-living. That's an even broader view, maybe like a deep ecology approach where everything in the environment has value, but I think biocentrism is more about living organisms specifically.

So putting it together, biocentrism's key point is that all living beings have moral standing because they are alive. Therefore, the correct answer should be option I.

The question asks about the definition of biocentrism, which is a philosophical view emphasizing the moral standing of living beings. Biocentrism posits that all living entities have intrinsic value simply because they are alive. 

- **Option A** refers to ecosystems, aligning more with ecocentrism.
- **Option B** focuses solely on humans, which is anthropocentrism.
- **Option C** emphasizes individual species, not the core of biocentrism.
- **Option D** and **Option F** focus on pain and consciousness, respectively, which are more related to sentience than biocentrism.
- **Option E** includes all beings but isn't limited to living ones.
- **Option G** combines humans and animals, not all living beings.
- **Option H** centers on sentient creatures, not necessarily all life.
- **Option I** correctly identifies biocentrism as valuing all living beings because they are alive.
- **Option J** extends to non-living entities, which is broader than biocentrism.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.

I
