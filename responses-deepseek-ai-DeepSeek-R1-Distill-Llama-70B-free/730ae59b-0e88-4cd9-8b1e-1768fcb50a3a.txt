Okay, so I've got this question about Max Weber and his theories on the spirit of capitalism. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that Weber wrote a book called "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism." So the question is asking what he traced the origins of the capitalist spirit back to. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A: Movement towards religious pluralism. Hmm, pluralism is about having many religions. I'm not sure how that ties directly to capitalism. Maybe not the main point.

Option B: Inspirational Protestant groups who revived religious ideas. Reviving ideas sounds relevant, but I'm trying to remember if Weber focused on specific Protestant groups or practices.

Option C: Fall of feudalism and rise of industrialism. That's more about economic systems changing, but Weber's focus was more on the cultural and religious factors influencing work ethic, I think.

Option D: Introduction of paper currency in Middle Ages. That's an economic factor, but again, Weber's argument was more about the Protestant work ethic, not just economic tools.

Option E: New religious movements rejecting traditional labor. I'm not sure which movements those would be. Maybe some groups, but not sure if this is what Weber pointed to.

Option F: Spread of secularism. Secularism is about moving away from religion, but Weber was talking about how religious beliefs influenced capitalism, so maybe the opposite.

Option G: Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation. Oh wait, Calvinism is a Protestant sect. Weber talked about the Protestant work ethic, and Calvinism's idea of predestination. People worked hard to show they were among the elect. So this sounds relevant.

Option H: Expansion of trade during Renaissance. Trade expansion is more about economics and commerce, which is part of capitalism, but Weber's angle was on the values and beliefs that supported it.

Option I: Development of scientific method during Enlightenment. Scientific method is about rationality, which ties into capitalism's rational organization of work, but I think Weber linked it more to religious attitudes than science.

Option J: Birth of democracy in ancient Greece. That's way too early and not related to the rise of capitalism in the West during the modern period.

Putting it together, Weber's argument was that the Protestant Reformation, especially Calvinism, influenced the development of capitalism. Calvinists believed in working hard and being frugal as a way to show they were saved. This work ethic and saving mentality (instead of conspicuous consumption) helped lay the groundwork for capitalist values.

So the correct option would be G: Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation.

The question asks about Max Weber's view on the origins of the 'spirit of capitalism.' Weber, in his work "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism," argued that this spirit could be traced back to the influence of Protestantism, particularly Calvinism. Calvinists believed in predestination and engaged in ascetic practices, such as hard work and frugality, as a way to demonstrate their salvation. This work ethic and mindset contributed to the development of capitalist values.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, E, F, J**: These options either focus on unrelated movements or factors not central to Weber's thesis.
- **C, D, H, I**: These focus on economic or scientific factors, which Weber did not emphasize as the primary source of the capitalist spirit.
- **G**: This directly aligns with Weber's argument about Calvinism and the Protestant work ethic.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation.**

Answer: G
