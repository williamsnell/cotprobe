Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these calculations.

The question is about the time it takes for light to travel a certain distance. Hmm, I remember that time is calculated by dividing distance by speed. Right, the formula is time = distance / speed.

But wait, let me make sure I've got the right numbers here. The problem says the velocity of light is 3 × 10^8 meters per second. Oh, and the distance is 30 cm. Oh wait, centimeters, right? I need to convert that to meters because the speed is in meters per second.

So, 30 cm is 0.3 meters. Because 1 meter is 100 cm, so 30 divided by 100 is 0.3. Got that part.

Now, plugging into the formula: time equals 0.3 meters divided by 3e8 m/s. Let me write that out numerically. 0.3 divided by 3 times 10^8. Hmm, 0.3 divided by 3 is 0.1, right? Because 3 times 0.1 is 0.3. So that gives me 0.1 times 10^-8 seconds.

Wait wait, no, because 3e8 is 3 times 10 to the eighth. So 0.3 / (3e8) is (0.3/3) * 10^-8. 0.3 divided by 3 is indeed 0.1, so 0.1e-8 seconds. Or, in scientific notation, that's 1e-9 seconds? Because 0.1e-8 is the same as 1e-9. Wait, no, 0.1 times 10^-8 is 1e-9? Let me think. 10^-8 is 0.00000001, so 0.1 times that would be 0.000000001, which is 1e-9. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the time is 1e-9 seconds, which is 1 nanosecond. Because a nanosecond is one billionth of a second, right? So 1e-9 is 1 nanosecond.

Looking back at the options, option J says 1 nanosecond. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the units. Oh wait, another way to think about it: 1 meter is about 3.3 nanoseconds for light. Because 1 meter is 1/(3e8) seconds. Let me compute that. 3e8 m/s is the speed, so time for 1 m is 1/(3e8) seconds. 3e8 is 3e8, so 1/3e8 is approximately 3.333...e-9 seconds, which is 3.333 nanoseconds. So 1 meter takes about 3.33 ns.

But the distance here is 0.3 meters, which is a third of a meter. So if 1m takes ~3.33ns, then 0.3m would take 1/3 of that, which is approximately 1.11ns. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, that's a problem. Because earlier I thought it was 1ns, but this way, I get about 1.11ns.

Wait, maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 3e8 meters per second is 3e8 m/s. So time t = 0.3 m / (3e8 m/s) = (0.3 /3) * 1e-8 s. 0.3 divided by 3 is 0.1, so 0.1e-8 s is 1e-9 s, which is 1ns. Wait that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the alternative approach. Let's compute 1/(3e8) again. 1 / 3e8 = (1/3) * 1e-8 = 0.333...e-8 = 3.333...e-9 s, which is 3.333 nanoseconds for 1 meter.

So for 0.3 meters, it's 0.3 * 3.333e-9 s. 0.3 times 3.333 is approximately 1, so 1e-9 s, which is 1ns. So both methods agree.

So the correct answer must be 1 nanosecond, which is option J.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option J is 1 nanosecond, so that's correct. So I think I was right the first time.

To determine the time it takes for light to travel 30 cm, we use the formula:

\[
\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}
\]

The speed of light is given as \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and the distance is \( 30 \, \text{cm} \), which must be converted to meters. Since \( 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm} \), the distance in meters is:

\[
30 \, \text{cm} = 0.3 \, \text{m}
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\text{time} = \frac{0.3}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}
\]

This is equivalent to \( 1 \, \text{nanosecond} \) (since \( 1 \, \text{ns} = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: 1 nanosecond**
