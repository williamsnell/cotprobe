Okay, so I've got this question about Hersey and Blanchard’s situational leadership model. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about when a leader should use a "participative" style. 

From what I remember, the situational leadership model categorizes leadership styles based on the followers' competence and commitment. The model suggests that leaders should adjust their style based on the situation, specifically the ability and motivation of their team members.

The four main leadership styles in this model are:

1. **Telling**: For when followers are low in both ability and motivation. The leader makes decisions and tells the subordinates what to do.

2. **Selling**: For when followers have some ability but may lack motivation. The leader provides guidance and support.

3. **Participating**: This is where I need to be careful. I think this style is used when the followers have high ability but maybe low motivation. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me try to recall the model structure. So the model has two axes: one for the leader's behavior (task vs. relationship) and the other for the follower's readiness (ability and willingness).

The four styles correspond to the four combinations:

- **Telling** (low ability, low willingness): Leader does a lot of directing.

- **Selling** (low ability, high willingness): Leader still directs but also explains decisions.

- **Participating** (high ability, low willingness): Leader focuses more on relationships, less on task direction. Because the subordinates have the ability but maybe lack the motivation, so the leader gets them involved in decisions to boost their willingness.

- **Delegating** (high ability, high willingness): Leader delegates tasks and lets the subordinates take charge.

So the question is about the "participative" style, which I think is the same as "participating" in the model. So, the correct scenario is when subordinates have high ability but low motivation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: high ability and high motivation. That would be delegating, not participating.

Option B: low ability and high motivation. That's the selling style.

Option C: low ability and moderate motivation. Hmm, I don't think the options include moderate. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: high ability and high motivation.

B: low ability and high motivation.

C: low ability and moderate motivation.

D: moderate ability and low motivation.

E: low ability and low motivation.

F: high ability and low motivation.

Wait, so the correct scenario for participating is high ability and low motivation, which is option F.

According to Hersey and Blanchard’s situational leadership model, the "participative" (or "participating") style is most appropriate for followers who have high ability but low motivation. This style focuses on building relationships and involving subordinates in decision-making to enhance their motivation while providing minimal task direction since they already possess the necessary skills.

The correct answer is **F: high ability and low motivation**.

Answer: F
