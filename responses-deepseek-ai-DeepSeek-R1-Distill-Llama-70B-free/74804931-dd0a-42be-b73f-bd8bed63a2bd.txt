Okay, so I've got this problem here about a car's mileage and how much gasoline it needs to travel a certain distance. Hmm, let me read it again.

The car gets 24 miles per gallon. So that's like the fuel efficiency, right? Miles per gallon means how many miles you can drive on one gallon of gas. So if I drive 24 miles, that's one gallon used.

The question is asking how many gallons the car would need to travel 144 miles. Oh, right, so I need to find out how many gallons are required for that distance.

I think I can set this up as a division problem. Because if the car can go 24 miles on one gallon, then for 144 miles, I divide 144 by 24 to get the number of gallons needed. Let me write that down.

So 144 miles divided by 24 mi/gal equals the gallons needed. Let me do the math. 144 divided by 24... Well, 24 times 6 is 144, right? Because 24 times 5 is 120, and 24 more is 144. So 24 * 6 = 144. So 144 /24 is 6.

So the car needs 6 gallons to travel 144 miles. Looking at the options, option J is 6 gallons. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check. If I have 6 gallons and each gallon gets me 24 miles, then 6 gallons would give me 6 *24 = 144 miles. Yep, that makes sense. So yeah, 6 gallons is correct.

To determine how many gallons of gasoline the car needs to travel 144 miles, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Total miles}}{\text{Miles per gallon}}
\]

Given that the car's fuel efficiency is 24 miles per gallon, we calculate:

\[
\text{Gallons needed} = \frac{144 \, \text{miles}}{24 \, \text{mi/gal}} = 6 \, \text{gallons}
\]

Thus, the car requires 6 gallons of gasoline to travel 144 miles. The correct answer is:

J: 6 gallons

Answer: J
