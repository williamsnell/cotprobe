Okay, so I have this question about economics, specifically regarding Marshall and Fisher's components of the demand for money. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the demand for money refers to why people hold money. I think there are different theories about this. Keynes had his motives, but the question is about Marshall and Fisher. I'm not entirely sure, but I think they might have a different approach than Keynes.

Wait, I recall that Marshall and Fisher are associated with the classical approach. They probably looked at the demand for money in terms of transactions. So, the transactions demand is about needing money for daily expenses, like buying things. But I think there's another component too.

Oh right, Fisher's equation is MV=PT, where M is money supply, V is velocity, P is price level, T is transactions. So maybe the demand for money relates to transactions and perhaps another factor. I'm trying to remember if it's just transactions or if there's more.

Wait, another thought: Keynes talked about three motives—transactions, precautionary, and speculative. But Marshall and Fisher might have a simpler model. I think in their model, the demand for money is for transactions and maybe also for holding other assets, or perhaps it's about the desire to hold money versus other assets.

Wait, another angle. I think the classical view, including Marshall and Fisher, considered the demand for money as being for transactions purposes and as a store of value. So transactions demand would be for conducting daily business, and asset demand would be holding money as an asset, which relates to wealth.

So the two components would be transactions demand and asset demand. Let me look at the options. Option B is "Transactions Demand and Asset Demand." That sounds right.

But wait, what about the other options? Option A is Investment and Consumption—that's more related to aggregate demand, not specifically money demand. Option C is Income and Expenditure, which might relate but isn't the direct components. Option D is Savings and Interest Rates—savings might be a part, but not exactly the two components.

Option E is Credit and Debit—doesn't seem right. Option F is Wealth and Expectations—wealth could be a factor, but expectations are more Keynesian. Option G is Supply and Demand, which is general economics, not specific to money demand. Option H is Exports and Imports, which relates to balance of payments. Option I is Price Level and Inflation Rate—those affect money demand but aren't the components. Option J is Liquidity and Time Preference—liquidity relates, but time preference is more about savings and investment.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be B: Transactions Demand and Asset Demand.

The demand for money, according to Marshall and Fisher, can be broken down into two primary components: Transactions Demand and Asset Demand. Transactions Demand refers to the need for money to facilitate daily purchases and economic activities, while Asset Demand relates to holding money as a store of value or for precautionary purposes. This aligns with the classical view, which emphasizes these two motives for holding money.

Option B correctly identifies these components, distinguishing them from other economic concepts like investment, consumption, or interest rates, which are not directly tied to the specific components of money demand as described by Marshall and Fisher.

Answer: B
