Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the surface temperature of Sirius using its blackbody spectrum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember something about blackbody radiation and a formula involving the wavelength.

Wait, right, there's Wien's Law. Oh right, Wien's displacement law. It states that the maximum wavelength emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is lambda max times temperature equals a constant. I think the constant is called Wien's displacement constant. 

So the formula would be lambda_max * T = b, where b is Wien's constant. I remember the value of b is approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K. But wait, the units are important here. The wavelength given is in nanometers, so I need to convert that to meters to make the units consistent.

The problem says lambda_max is 260 nm. Oh, right, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters. So 260 nm is 260e-9 meters, which is 2.6e-7 meters.

Wait, let me write that down. Lambda_max = 260 nm = 260 x 10^-9 m = 2.6 x 10^-7 m.

Now, using Wien's Law, T = b / lambda_max.

So plugging in the numbers: T = (2.898e-3 m·K) / (2.6e-7 m).

Let me calculate that. Let's see, 2.898e-3 divided by 2.6e-7. Hmm, let me compute this step by step.

First, 2.898e-3 is 0.002898. Divided by 2.6e-7, which is 0.00000026. 

Alternatively, in exponents: 2.898e-3 / 2.6e-7 = (2.898 / 2.6) * 1e4.

Wait, because 1e-3 divided by 1e-7 is 1e4. So 2.898 divided by 2.6 is approximately 1.114.

So 1.114 * 1e4 equals 11,140 K. So about 11,140 Kelvin.

Looking at the options, option D is 11,000 K. That's the closest. So the answer should be D.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.

So 2.898e-3 / 2.6e-7 = ?

Compute 2.898 / 2.6 first. Let's do that: 2.898 ÷ 2.6. 

2.6 goes into 2.898 how many times? Let's see: 2.6 * 1 is 2.6, subtract from 2.898, we get 0.298. Bring down a zero, making it 2.980.

Wait, actually, perhaps I should write it as 2898 ÷ 2600. Because 2.898e-3 is 0.002898, and 2.6e-7 is 0.00000026. So 0.002898 / 0.00000026. 

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 1e7 to eliminate the decimals. So that becomes 2898 / 26.

Wait 2898 divided by 26. Let's compute that. 26 times 100 is 2600. 2898 -2600=298. 26*11=286. So 11 more with 12 left over. So that's 111.53, approximately.

Wait wait, 26 times 111 is 2886. 2898 -2886 is 12. So 12/26 is 0.46. So about 111.46.

Wait, because 26 * 111 = 2886, then 2898 is 12 more, so 12/26 is 0.4615. So 111.4615. So about 11146 K. So approximately 11,146 K.

Which would round to 11,000 K, which is option D. So yes, that's the right choice.

Alternatively, let me just compute 2.898e-3 / 2.6e-7. So 2.898e-3 divided by 2.6e-7. Let's write it as (2.898 / 2.6) * (1e-3 / 1e-7) = (approx 1.114) * (1e4) = 1.114e4 = 11,140 K.

Yes, that matches. So the answer is D.

To estimate the surface temperature of Sirius, we use Wien's displacement law, which states:

\[
\lambda_{\max} \cdot T = b
\]

where:
- \( \lambda_{\max} \) is the wavelength of maximum emission,
- \( T \) is the temperature,
- \( b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m \cdot K} \) is Wien's displacement constant.

The problem gives \( \lambda_{\max} = 260 \, \mathrm{nm} \). Converting this to meters:

\[
\lambda_{\max} = 260 \, \mathrm{nm} = 260 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} = 2.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Rearranging Wien's law to solve for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{b}{\lambda_{\max}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}.
\]

First, divide \( 2.898 \) by \( 2.6 \):

\[
\frac{2.898}{2.6} \approx 1.114.
\]

Next, account for the powers of 10:

\[
T = 1.114 \times 10^{4} \, \mathrm{K} = 11,140 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 11,000 \, \mathrm{K} \), which corresponds to option D.
