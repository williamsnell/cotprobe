Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is about the Bohr radius and the frequency of a light wave that has the same wavelength as this radius. The Bohr radius is given as 0.5292 × 10^-8 cm. Hmm, I remember that the Bohr model is about the hydrogen atom, right? The radius being the size of the electron's orbit or something like that.

Wait, the question is about finding the frequency of light with the same wavelength as the Bohr radius. So I think I need to relate wavelength to frequency. Oh, right, the formula that connects them is c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency. So I can rearrange this to find ν = c / λ.

But wait, units are going to be important here. The Bohr radius is given in centimeters. I remember that the speed of light is usually in meters per second, so I might need to convert the units.

Let me jot down what I know:

Bohr radius, λ = 0.5292 × 10^-8 cm. I should convert this to meters because the speed of light is in m/s. Since 1 cm is 0.01 meters, I can multiply by 0.01 to convert cm to m.

Calculating that: 0.5292 × 10^-8 cm = 0.5292 × 10^-8 * 0.01 m. Wait, 0.01 is 10^-2. So 10^-8 multiplied by 10^-2 is 10^-10. So λ = 0.5292 × 10^-10 m. Or in scientific notation, that would be 5.292 × 10^-11 meters. Wait, wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait 0.5292e-8 cm is equal to 0.5292e-8 * 1e-2 m, because 1 cm is 1e-2 m. So 0.5292e-10 m. Wait, 0.5292e-10 is the same as 5.292e-11 m, yes.

So λ is 5.292e-11 meters.

Now, the speed of light c is approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s. So using the formula ν = c / λ.

Plugging in the numbers: ν = (3.0e8 m/s) / (5.292e-11 m).

Let me compute this division. 3e8 divided by 5.292e-11.

So doing the division: 3e8 / 5.292e-11 = (3 /5.292) * 1e19. Because 1e8 divided by 1e-11 is 1e19.

Wait, 3 divided by 5.292 is approximately 0.5665. Hmm, let me calculate that more accurately. 5.292 times 0.566 is about 3. So 3 /5.292 = 0.5665 approximately.

So 0.5665 * 1e19 = 5.665e18 Hz.

Wait, let me double-check. 5.292e-11 is the wavelength in meters. 3e8 divided by 5.292e-11 is (3e8)/(5.292e-11) = (3/(5.292)) * 1e19. Let me compute 3 /5.292. Let's see, 5.292 * 0.566 is 5.292 * 0.5 is 2.646, 5.292 *0.066 is approximately 0.349, so total around 2.995, which is about 3. So 0.566 is correct.

So the frequency is approximately 5.665e18 Hz. Wait, looking at the options given, I need to see which option matches this.

Looking back at the options:

Option I is 5.665 × 10^18 sec^-1.

So that would be the correct answer, right?

Wait, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Convert 0.5292e-8 cm to meters: 0.5292e-8 * 1e-2 = 0.5292e-10 m, which is 5.292e-11 m.

2. Speed of light, c = 3e8 m/s.

3. ν = c / λ = 3e8 / 5.292e-11 = (3/5.292) * 1e19.

Wait, 3e8 / 5.292e-11 = 3e8 / 5.292e-11 = (3/5.292) * 1e(8 +11) )= 1e19. So yes, 3/(5.292) is about 0.5665, so 0.5665e19 = 5.665e18.

So the frequency is 5.665e18 Hz, which is option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the exponent. Let me write it out:

3e8 / 5.292e-11 = (3 /5.292) * 10^(8 - (-11)) )= 3/5.292 * 10^19.

Yes, 8 - (-11) is 19. So 3/5.292 is about 0.5665, so 0.5665e19 is 5.665e18.

So the correct option is I.

To determine the frequency of a light wave whose wavelength is equal to the Bohr radius, we use the relationship between the speed of light, wavelength, and frequency:  

\[
c = \lambda \nu \quad \text{or} \quad \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}
\]

### Given:
- Bohr radius (\(\lambda\)) = \(0.5292 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}\)
- Speed of light (\(c\)) = \(3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)

### Step 1: Convert wavelength to meters
Since \(1 \, \text{cm} = 10^{-2} \, \text{m}\), we convert the Bohr radius to meters:  
\[
\lambda = 0.5292 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \times 10^{-2} = 0.5292 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 5.292 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the frequency
Using the formula \(\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}\):  
\[
\nu = \frac{3.0 \times 10^8}{5.292 \times 10^{-11}}.
\]

First, divide \(3.0\) by \(5.292\):  
\[
\frac{3.0}{5.292} \approx 0.5665.
\]

Next, calculate the powers of 10:  
\[
10^8 / 10^{-11} = 10^{8 + 11} = 10^{19}.
\]

Thus:  
\[
\nu \approx 0.5665 \times 10^{19} = 5.665 \times 10^{18} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated frequency is \(5.665 \times 10^{18} \, \text{Hz}\), which corresponds to **Option I**.
