Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about electrochemical cells. Hmm, the question gives me the standard emf of a cell at two different temperatures, 20°C and 30°C, and asks me to find the values of ΔG_m°, ΔH_m°, and ΔS_m° at 25°C. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, I remember that the emf of a cell is related to the Gibbs free energy change. The formula I know is ΔG° = -nFE°, where F is Faraday's constant. Since this is a standard cell, E° is given. But wait, the tricky part is that the cell’s emf changes with temperature, so I think I need to use the van 't Hoff equation or something related to the temperature dependence.

Wait, the van 't Hoff equation relates the change in the cell potential with temperature. Oh right, the equation is dE/dT = (nF)⁻¹ ΔS°, but sometimes it's written in terms of the slope. Alternatively, another form might be more useful here. Or maybe using the Gibbs equation: ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. But since E° varies with temperature, I might need to use the relation between E° and temperature to find ΔH° and ΔS°.

So, let me list what I know:

At 20°C (293 K), E = 0.2692 V.

At 30°C (303 K), E = 0.2660 V.

We need to find ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS° at 25°C (298 K, which is 25+273=298 K).

I think the approach here is to first calculate ΔG° at 25°C, and then use the van 't Hoff equation to find ΔH° and ΔS°.

Wait, but wait—ΔG° can be found directly if we know E° at 25°C. But we don't have E° at 25°C, so perhaps we can estimate it by interpolation or some method.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the values using the data from the two temperatures. Let me think about the equations.

The Gibbs free energy equation is ΔG° = -n F E°. So, knowing E° at a specific temperature allows us to find ΔG° at that temperature.

But since the problem gives E° at two temperatures, perhaps we can find the entropy change, ΔS°, using the relation between E° and temperature.

Another approach is to use the equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°.

But since we're dealing with two different temperatures, maybe we can set up two equations.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard cell potential is related to ΔG°, and the temperature dependence of the cell potential can be described using the van 't Hoff equation. The van 't Hoff equation in terms of cell potential is:

dE/dT = (ΔS°)/(nF).

Wait, but I think it's more accurate to say that the slope of E versus T gives us ΔS°/(nF). So, if I can find the slope, I can find ΔS°, provided I know n, the number of electrons transferred.

But wait, what's the cell reaction here? The cell is Hg | Hg2Cl2(s), HCl(aq) || H2, Pt.

So, on the anode side, mercury is reacting. Let me write the half-reactions.

The anode (oxidation): Hg(l) → Hg²⁺ + 2e⁻ ?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The cell is Hg | Hg2Cl2(s), HCl(aq) || H2, Pt.

Wait, the left side is the anode because in standard notation, the anode is on the left. So oxidation occurs on the left. The right is the cathode where reduction occurs.

So, the anode reaction: Hg(l) is being oxidized. The Hg2Cl2 is a calomel electrode. The reaction for calomel electrode is:

Hg2Cl2(s) + 2e⁻ → 2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻(aq).

But since it's the anode, the reverse is happening. So, the oxidation would be:

2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻(aq) → Hg2Cl2(s) + 2e⁻.

On the cathode side, which is H2 gas and Pt. The cathode reaction is:

2 H+ + 2e⁻ → H2(g).

So, combining the two half-reactions:

Anode: 2 Hg + 2 Cl⁻ → Hg2Cl2 + 2e⁻.

Cathode: 2 H+ + 2e⁻ → H2.

Adding them together, the overall reaction is:

2 Hg + 2 Cl⁻ + 2 H+ → Hg2Cl2 + H2.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me balance the equation again.

Wait, anode oxidation: 2 Hg → Hg2²+ + 2e⁻? Or perhaps Hg is going to Hg²+.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard calomel electrode. The calomel electrode's half-reaction is:

Hg2Cl2 (s) + 2e⁻ → 2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻(aq) E° = 0.241 V (I remember this value, but not sure if it's correct).

So, as an anode, the reverse would be:

2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻(aq) → Hg2Cl2(s) + 2e⁻. So this is oxidation (loss of electrons).

Cathode: H+ is being reduced to H2. So, 2 H+ + 2e⁻ → H2(g).

So the overall reaction is:

2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻(aq) + 2 H+ (aq) → Hg2Cl2(s) + H2(g).

Wait, but that doesn't seem to balance the charges. Let me check.

Wait, maybe the H+ comes from the HCl solution. So the reaction is:

2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻ → Hg2Cl2(s) + 2e⁻ (anode)

And at cathode: 2 H+ + 2e⁻ → H2(g).

So overall, combining:

2 Hg + 2 Cl⁻ + 2 H+ → Hg2Cl2 + H2.

Hmm, let's balance the atoms and charges.

On the left: 2 Hg, 2 Cl⁻, 2 H+.

On the right: Hg2Cl2 (so 2 Hg, 2 Cl), and H2 (2 H).

So, the Cl⁻ and H+ are on the left. On the right, Cl is in Hg2Cl2, and H is in H2.

Wait, but in the overall reaction, the Hg is balanced: 2 on left, 2 in Hg2Cl2.

Cl: 2 on left in Cl⁻, 2 in Hg2Cl2.

H: 2 from H+ on left, 2 in H2 on right. So that's balanced.

The charge on the left: 2 (-1) from Cl⁻ and 2 (+1) from H+ → total 0.

On the right: Hg2Cl2 is neutral, H2 is neutral. So overall, charge is balanced.

So the reaction is:

2 Hg(l) + 2 H+ + 2 Cl⁻ → Hg2Cl2(s) + H2(g).

Wait, but wait, in a standard cell, the activities are 1 for solids and pure liquids, so Hg(l) is activity 1, Hg2Cl2(s) is 1. H+ and Cl⁻ are at 1 M.

But in any case, the number of electrons transferred (n) is 2, because each Hg atom loses one electron (since 2 Hg atoms lose 2 electrons in total).

So n = 2.

So now, for each temperature, the E° is given, but wait, the problem says "at 20°C the standard emf is 0.2692 V", same at 30°C. So we can use these to find ΔG°, and then use the van 't Hoff equation to find ΔH° and ΔS°.

Wait, but the question asks for the values at 25°C. Hmm.

Wait, but the emf varies with temperature, so I need to find E° at 25°C first, perhaps by interpolation.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to use the van 't Hoff equation to find ΔH°, and then use the Gibbs equation to find ΔG° and ΔS° at 25°C.

Let me write down the equations.

At a given temperature T, the standard cell potential E° is related to ΔG° by:

ΔG° = -n F E°.

But E° changes with temperature, so we can model this change using the van 't Hoff equation. The van 't Hoff equation in terms of E° is:

dE/dT = (ΔS°)/(n F).

Alternatively, for small temperature changes, we can approximate:

( E2 - E1 ) / (T2 - T1 ) = ΔS° / (n F).

Wait, because the slope dE/dT is equal to ΔS°/(n F). So if I can compute (E2 - E1)/(T2 - T1), that would give me (ΔS°)/(n F), from which I can find ΔS° if I know n and F.

Yes, that's a good approach.

So let's compute the slope first.

Given:

At T1 = 293 K, E1 = 0.2692 V.

At T2 = 303 K, E2 = 0.2660 V.

So ΔE = E2 - E1 = 0.2660 - 0.2692 = -0.0032 V.

ΔT = T2 - T1 = 10 K.

So the slope dE/dT ≈ Δ E / Δ T = (-0.0032 V) / 10 K = -0.00032 V/K.

So, dE/dT = -0.00032 V/K.

And from the van 't Hoff relation, dE/dT = ΔS°/(n F).

We know n=2, F=96485 C/mol.

So, ΔS° = [dE/dT] * n F.

Plugging the numbers:

ΔS° = (-0.00032 V/K) * 2 * 96485 C/mol.

Wait, volts are J/C, so V = J/C → J = V*C.

So, ΔS° = (-0.00032 J/(C·K)) ) * 2 * 96485 C/mol.

The C units cancel out:

= (-0.00032 * 2 * 96485) J/(K·mol)

Compute that:

0.00032 * 2 = 0.00064.

0.00064 * 96485 ≈ let's calculate:

96485 * 0.00064.

Hmm, 96485 * 0.0006 = 57.891.

96485 * 0.00004 = 3.8594.

So total ≈ 57.891 + 3.8594 ≈ 61.7504.

So ΔS° ≈ -61.7504 J/(K·mol).

Wait, wait, but the options are in the range of -31 to 35 J/K·mol. So this can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, my calculation must be wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, 0.00032 * 2 *96485.

Wait, 0.00032 is the same as 3.2e-4.

So 3.2e-4 * 2 = 6.4e-4.

6.4e-4 * 96485 = let's compute 96485 * 6.4e-4.

Compute 96485 * 0.00064:

Well, 96485 * 0.0006 = 57.891.

96485 * 0.00004 = approx 3.8594.

So total is 57.891 + 3.8594 = 61.7504.

So yes, 61.75 J/(K·mol), but the sign is negative, so ΔS° = -61.75 J/(K·mol).

Wait, but the options have ΔS around -31 or 31. So I'm getting a value about double that. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the number of electrons transferred, n.

Wait, earlier I thought n=2 because each Hg atom loses one electron, and there are two Hg atoms. So total electrons lost are 2, so n=2.

But perhaps I was wrong. Let me re-examine the cell reaction.

The cell is Hg | Hg2Cl2(s), HCl(aq) || H2, Pt.

The anode is the Hg being oxidized. The reaction at the anode is:

Hg(l) → Hg²+ + 2e⁻ ?

Wait, no, because Hg2Cl2 is Hg(I) chloride. Each Hg is in +1 oxidation state.

So the reaction at the anode (oxidation) would be:

Hg(l) → Hg^+ + e⁻.

Wait, but since Hg2Cl2 is Hg(I) chloride, the calomel electrode's reaction is:

Hg2Cl2(s) + 2e⁻ → 2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻(aq).

So, during discharge, the anode is Hg(l) being oxidized. So, each Hg atom loses one electron, but since two Hg atoms are involved, the total electrons are 2.

So the anode reaction is:

2 Hg(l) + 2 Cl⁻ → Hg2Cl2(s) + 2e⁻.

So n=2, as I thought earlier.

Hmm, so why is the ΔS° I calculated (-61.75 J/K·mol) not matching any of the options? Because the options for ΔS are around ±31 or so. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the slope:

E1 = 0.2692 V at T1=293 K.

E2 = 0.2660 V at T2=303 K.

So ΔE = E2 - E1 = -0.0032 V.

ΔT = 10 K.

So dE/dT = -0.0032 / 10 = -0.00032 V/K.

Yes, that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used (E2 - E1)/(T2 - T1) as positive? No, because T2 is higher, E is lower, so it's negative.

So, using dE/dT = -0.00032 V/K.

n=2, F=96485 C/mol.

So ΔS° = (dE/dT) * n F = (-0.00032 V/K) * 2 * 96485 C/mol.

Wait, V is J/C, so:

= (-0.00032 J/(C·K)) ) * 2 * 96485 C/mol.

The Cs cancel, so:

= (-0.00032 * 2 * 96485) J/(K·mol).

Compute 0.00032 *2 = 0.00064.

0.00064 *96485 = ?

Let me compute 96485 * 0.00064.

Well, 96485 * 0.0006 = 57.891.

96485 * 0.00004 = 3.8594.

So 57.891 + 3.8594 = 61.7504.

So ΔS° = -61.7504 J/(K·mol).

Wait, but the options have ΔS around -31 or 31. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the cell reaction I wrote has n=1 instead of n=2. Let me think again.

Wait, in the overall reaction:

2 Hg(l) + 2 H+ + 2 Cl⁻ → Hg2Cl2(s) + H2(g).

So, 2 Hg atoms lose electrons. Each Hg atom loses one electron, so 2 electrons in total.

So n=2.

Hmm, that's correct. So why is the ΔS° I calculated about double what is in the options? Perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere?

Wait, wait, the van 't Hoff equation might have a different form. Another form is:

ln K = -ΔH°/(R T) + ΔS°/(R).

But in terms of cell potential, the Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT)/(nF) ln Q.

But perhaps the correct relation between E and temperature is:

ΔG° = -n F E°.

And ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS°.

So combining these, we get:

- n F E° = ΔH° - T ΔS°.

Rearranging, we get:

n F E° = -ΔH° + T ΔS°.

Which can be written as:

E° = [ -ΔH° + T ΔS° ] / (n F).

So, the equation is linear in T, with slope ΔS°/(n F), and intercept -ΔH°/(n F).

So, if I have E° at two different temperatures, I can set up two equations and solve for ΔH° and ΔS°.

Yes, that's another approach.

Let me try that.

Let me denote T1 = 293 K, E1 = 0.2692 V.

T2 = 303 K, E2 = 0.2660 V.

The equation is:

E° = [ -ΔH° + T ΔS° ] / (n F).

So, for each temperature:

At T1: E1 = [ -ΔH° + T1 ΔS° ] / (n F).

At T2: E2 = [ -ΔH° + T2 ΔS° ] / (n F).

We can write these as:

n F E1 = -ΔH° + T1 ΔS°.

n F E2 = -ΔH° + T2 ΔS°.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

n F (E2 - E1) = (T2 - T1) ΔS°
