Okay, so I've got this question about communication models, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about which model shows information flowing through various media channels to specific types of people, who others refer to for info and guidance.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are different models like one-step, two-step, and multi-step. Wait, the one-step model is where the sender communicates directly to the audience without any intermediaries, right? So that's probably not the one here because the question mentions going through media channels to particular people who others refer to.

The two-step model rings a bell. I think it was proposed by Paul Lazarsfeld. The idea is that mass media sends information to opinion leaders first, and then these leaders pass it on to others. Oh wait, so the media sends info to certain people, and those people are the ones others look up to. That fits the description in the question.

Wait, but what about the multi-step model? I think that's more about multiple layers of intermediaries, maybe more steps than just two. But the question seems to point to a two-step process: media to opinion leaders, then to the masses.

So the options are A: Three-step, B: One-step, C: Multi-step, D: Two-step. Oh, so the correct answer should be D: Two-step.

I think that makes sense. So the answer is D.

The correct answer is D: Two-step. This model describes information flowing from media to opinion leaders, who then influence others.

Answer: D
