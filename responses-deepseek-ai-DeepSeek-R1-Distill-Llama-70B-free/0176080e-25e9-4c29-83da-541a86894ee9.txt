Okay, so I've got this question about child language development. The question is asking about what changes in children's language learning ability during the latter part of their first year. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about this topic.

I recall that babies start with cooing and then move on to babbling. Babbling is when they make sounds that resemble the structure of language but aren't actual words. So, around 6 months or so, they start babbling with consonant-vowel combinations, like "ba ba ba" or "da da da". 

Wait, the question is about the latter part of the first year, so maybe around 9-12 months. At this point, I think children start saying their first words. Before that, they might not have real words, just babbling. So the change here is that they begin to utter their first real words.

Looking at the options, let me go through them:

Option A: Begin to utter words in an unsystematic and random manner. Hmm, I thought babbling is more random, but once they start using words, they might be more systematic. Not sure about this one.

Option B: Start to form full sentences. No, that's too advanced. First words come before sentences, so probably not this.

Option C: Begin producing more language than they comprehend. I think in early stages, comprehension is ahead of production. They understand more than they can say. So this might not be correct.

Option D: Begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling. Oh, this sounds right. So they start with babbling, and through reinforcement (like parents responding), certain sounds become their first words. So this is a systematic change, not random.

Option E: Lose the ability to understand their own language. No, that doesn't make sense. Language understanding improves, not declines.

Option F: Begin to be sensitive to rhythms in speech patterns. I think that sensitivity starts earlier. Infants are attuned to the rhythm and prosody of their native language from a young age, so maybe this isn't the change in the latter part of the first year.

Option G: Lose ability to perceive any sound distinctions. No, in fact, infants can perceive all sounds at first, but later they lose the ability to distinguish sounds not in their native language. Wait, that's more around after the first year, maybe.

Option H: Are able to perceive sound distinctions in multiple languages. That's actually true for very young infants, but as they start learning their native language, they lose this ability. So by the end of the first year, they might not have this anymore.

Option I: Become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language. Oh, right, so this is about the perceptual narrowing. Infants can tell all phonetic differences, but as they develop, they lose the ability to distinguish sounds that aren't part of their native language. So during the latter part of the first year, this starts to happen.

Wait, but the question is about language-learning ability changes. So, the options are about what they begin to do. So the correct change is either starting to utter first words (D) or changes in perception (I and H).

The question is about their language learning ability changing. So, maybe the shift is in their perception affecting language learning. So, between D and I.

So, the options D and I are both possible. Let's read the question again: "changes in that they..." So, the change is the emergence of first words, or the change in sound perception.

Wait, another angle: during the latter part of the first year, around 12 months, children typically say their first words. So D says they begin to utter their first words through selective reinforcement of babbling. That makes sense because parents might respond when the child babbles something that sounds like a word, reinforcing it.

Alternatively, option I is about perceiving sound distinctions. I think that the ability to perceive non-native sounds starts to decline around this time. So which of these is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is about their language learning ability. So the change in that ability could involve either the production aspect (like starting to form words) or the perceptual aspect (becoming less able to perceive certain sounds, which affects learning).

Looking back at the options:

The question is phrased as "changes in that they..." So what's the correct answer.

I remember that in the first year, children start with universal sound perception but then lose that ability. So by the end of the first year, they can't distinguish sounds not in their language as well as before. So option I says "become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language." So that's a change in their ability.

So the change is that their perception becomes specialized, making it harder to learn other languages later. So this is a significant change in their language ability.

Alternatively, option H says they can perceive in multiple languages, which is the opposite of what happens. So H is incorrect.

So the correct changes are either starting to speak (D) or losing sound distinctions (I).

The question is about the latter part of the first year, so both events happen around that time. But the options are different.

Wait, the question is about the language-learning ability changing. So if they start uttering first words, that's a production change. But if they lose the ability to perceive certain sounds, that affects their learning ability because they can't hear the differences, making it harder to learn those sounds later.

So which one is the correct answer?

Looking back, I think the answer might be H or I. Or D.

Wait, another point: the question says "language-learning ability changes in that they...". So it's about how their ability changes. If they lose the ability to perceive certain sounds, their language learning becomes more focused on their native language, which is a change.

Alternatively, the emergence of first words is a significant step, but is that about ability or just development.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of what each option is about.

Option D is about beginning to utter first words through selective reinforcement of babbling. So their babbling becomes more systematic as certain babbles are reinforced, leading to words.

Option I is about becoming less able to perceive certain sounds, which affects their learning ability because they can't pick up on sounds outside their language.

I think the key is that during this period, children start to show an understanding of sounds specific to their language, which is option I. Because prior to this, they could distinguish all sounds, but now they start to lose that. This affects their language learning.

So the correct answer would be either D or I.

Wait, the question is about the change in their language-learning ability. So if they lose the ability to perceive certain sounds, their learning becomes more specialized, which is a change in their ability.

Alternatively, starting to use words is a developmental milestone but perhaps not a change in ability per se, but a result of it.

So I'm leaning towards option I: become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language.
</think>

During the latter part of their first year, children undergo significant changes in their language-learning abilities. One key change is the emergence of their first words, which occurs as babbling becomes more systematic and certain sounds are selectively reinforced by caregivers. This marks a developmental milestone in production. However, another critical change is the perceptual narrowing of sound distinctions, where children begin to lose the ability to perceive sounds not present in their native language. This specialization affects their language-learning ability by making it more focused on their native language, which is a fundamental shift in how they process linguistic information.

Between the options, the question focuses on the change in language-learning ability. While beginning to utter first words (Option D) is a significant developmental step, the perceptual narrowing described in Option I represents a more direct change in their ability to learn language, as it shapes their capacity to distinguish and process sounds.
