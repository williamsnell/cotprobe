Okay, so I've got this problem here about Laplace transforms, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the response transform V_ab(s) is related to the source transform V(s) by the equation:

V_ab(s) = [3V(s) + 3s + 27] / (s² + 6s + 8)

And we're given that v(t) = 16e^(-3t)u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function. We need to find v_ab(t) from the given options.

Alright, so I remember that the Laplace transform of v(t) is V(s). The Laplace transform of 16e^(-3t)u(t) should be straightforward. The formula for L{e^(-at)u(t)} is 1/(s + a), so here, a is 3. So V(s) = 16/(s + 3).

Now, let's plug V(s) into the equation for V_ab(s):

V_ab(s) = [3*(16/(s+3)) + 3s + 27] / (s² + 6s + 8)

Let me compute the numerator first:

3*(16/(s+3)) = 48/(s+3)
So numerator = 48/(s+3) + 3s + 27

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can combine the terms by getting a common denominator. Let's see:

First, let's write the entire numerator over a common denominator. The denominator for the first term is (s+3), and the other terms are polynomials. So the common denominator would be (s+3). Let me rewrite each term:

48/(s+3) stays as it is.

3s can be written as 3s*(s+3)/(s+3) = (3s² + 9s)/(s+3)

27 can be written as 27*(s+3)/(s+3) = (27s + 81)/(s+3)

So now, combining all terms over (s+3):

[48 + 3s² + 9s + 27s + 81] / (s+3)

Combine like terms in the numerator:

3s² + (9s + 27s) + (48 + 81) = 3s² + 36s + 129

So the numerator becomes (3s² + 36s + 129)/(s+3)

So now, V_ab(s) = [ (3s² + 36s + 129)/(s+3) ] / (s² + 6s + 8)

Wait, division by (s² + 6s + 8) is the same as multiplying by 1/(s² + 6s + 8). So,

V_ab(s) = (3s² + 36s + 129) / [ (s+3)(s² + 6s + 8) ]

Now, I need to simplify this expression. Maybe factor the denominator further.

Looking at s² + 6s + 8, let's factor it. The roots can be found using quadratic formula:

s = [-6 ± sqrt(36 - 32)]/2 = [-6 ± 2]/2 → s = (-6+2)/2 = -2, and s = (-6-2)/2 = -4. So, s² + 6s +8 = (s+2)(s+4)

So the denominator becomes (s+3)(s+2)(s+4). So,

V_ab(s) = (3s² + 36s + 129) / [ (s+2)(s+3)(s+4) ]

Now, to find v_ab(t), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of V_ab(s). To do that, I'll probably need to express V_ab(s) in partial fractions.

Let me write V_ab(s) as:

V_ab(s) = A/(s+2) + B/(s+3) + C/(s+4)

Multiply both sides by (s+2)(s+3)(s+4) to get:

3s² + 36s + 129 = A(s+3)(s+4) + B(s+2)(s+4) + C(s+2)(s+3)

Now, let's find A, B, and C by plugging in suitable values of s.

First, let s = -2:

Left side: 3*(-2)^2 + 36*(-2) + 129 = 3*4 -72 + 129 = 12 -72 +129 = 69

Right side: A(1)(2) + B(0) + C(0) → 2A =69 → A = 34.5 or 69/2

Next, let s = -3:

Left side: 3*(-3)^2 + 36*(-3) + 129 = 27 -108 +129 = 48

Right side: A(0) + B(-1)(1) + C(0) → -B =48 → B = -48

Then, let s = -4:

Left side: 3*(-4)^2 + 36*(-4) + 129 = 48 -144 +129 = 33

Right side: A(0) + B(0) + C(-2)(-1) → 2C =33 → C=16.5 or 33/2

So now, we have:

V_ab(s) = (69/2)/(s+2) + (-48)/(s+3) + (33/2)/(s+4)

Now, take the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

L^{-1} { (69/2)/(s+2) } = (69/2) e^{-2t} u(t)

L^{-1} { (-48)/(s+3) } = -48 e^{-3t} u(t)

L^{-1} { (33/2)/(s+4) } = (33/2) e^{-4t} u(t)

So combining these:

v_ab(t) = (-48 e^{-3t}) + (69/2 e^{-2t}) + (33/2 e^{-4t})

Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option J: -48e^-3t + (69/2)e^-2t + (33/2)e^-4t

That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option J.

To solve the problem, we start with the given relationship between the transforms:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3V(s) + 3s + 27}{s^2 + 6s + 8}
\]

where \( v(t) = 16e^{-3t}u(t) \). The Laplace transform of \( v(t) \) is:

\[
V(s) = \frac{16}{s + 3}
\]

Substituting \( V(s) \) into the equation for \( V_{ab}(s) \):

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3\left(\frac{16}{s+3}\right) + 3s + 27}{s^2 + 6s + 8}
\]

First, simplify the numerator:

\[
3\left(\frac{16}{s+3}\right) = \frac{48}{s+3}, \quad \text{so } \text{numerator} = \frac{48}{s+3} + 3s + 27
\]

Combine terms over a common denominator \( s+3 \):

\[
\frac{48}{s+3} + \frac{3s^2 + 9s}{s+3} + \frac{27s + 81}{s+3} = \frac{3s^2 + 36s + 129}{s+3}
\]

Thus:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{\frac{3s^2 + 36s + 129}{s+3}}{s^2 + 6s + 8} = \frac{3s^2 + 36s + 129}{(s+3)(s^2 + 6s + 8)}
\]

Factor \( s^2 + 6s + 8 \) as \( (s+2)(s+4) \), so:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3s^2 + 36s + 129}{(s+2)(s+3)(s+4)}
\]

Next, decompose \( V_{ab}(s) \) into partial fractions:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{A}{s+2} + \frac{B}{s+3} + \frac{C}{s+4}
\]

Multiply through by \( (s+2)(s+3)(s+4) \) and solve for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) by substituting suitable values of \( s \):

- For \( s = -2 \): \( 3(-2)^2 + 36(-2) + 129 = 69 \), so \( 2A = 69 \) and \( A = \frac{69}{2} \).
- For \( s = -3 \): \( 3(-3)^2 + 36(-3) + 129 = 48 \), so \( -B = 48 \) and \( B = -48 \).
- For \( s = -4 \): \( 3(-4)^2 + 36(-4) + 129 = 33 \), so \( 2C = 33 \) and \( C = \frac{33}{2} \).

Thus:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{69/2}{s+2} + \frac{-48}{s+3} + \frac{33/2}{s+4}
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

\[
v_{ab}(t) = \frac{69}{2}e^{-2t} - 48e^{-3t} + \frac{33}{2}e^{-4t}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: \( -48e^{-3t} + \frac{69}{2}e^{-2t} + \frac{33}{2}e^{-4t} \)**

Answer: J
