Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a bullet being fired from a gun. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with conservation of momentum. Right, because when the bullet is fired, the gun recoils, and the total momentum should stay the same before and after the shot.

Let me read the question again. It says a 4.0-gram bullet is fired from a 5.0-kg gun at a speed of 600 m/sec. I need to find the recoil speed of the gun. The options are from A to J, all negative values. Oh wait, negative probably indicates the direction opposite to the bullet's motion, which makes sense.

Wait, the bullet's mass is 4.0 grams. Oh, I should convert that to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms. So 4 grams is 0.004 kg. And the gun's mass is 5.0 kg.

Momentum is mass times velocity. Before the bullet is fired, everything is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After firing, the bullet moves forward, and the gun moves backward. So the total momentum should still be zero.

So, the momentum of the bullet plus the momentum of the gun equals zero. Let me write that equation. 

m_bullet * v_bullet + m_gun * v_gun = 0

I can solve for v_gun, the speed of the gun. Rearranging:

m_gun * v_gun = - m_bullet * v_bullet

So v_gun = -(m_bullet * v_bullet) / m_gun

Plugging in the numbers, m_bullet is 0.004 kg, v_bullet is 600 m/s, m_gun is 5 kg.

Calculating the numerator: 0.004 kg * 600 m/s = 2.4 kgÂ·m/s.

So v_gun = -2.4 / 5 = -0.48 m/s.

Looking at the options, option F is -0.48 m/sec. So the answer should be F.

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check the units. Grams to kg: 4g is 0.004 kg, correct. Mass of gun is 5 kg. Speed is 600 m/s, correct. The calculation: 0.004*600=2.4, then 2.4/5 is 0.48. So yes, the gun's speed is -0.48 m/s. So option F.

To solve the problem, we apply the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the bullet is fired is zero since both the bullet and the gun are initially at rest. After firing, the momentum of the bullet and the gun must sum to zero. 

The equation for conservation of momentum is:

\[
m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{gun}} v_{\text{gun}} = 0
\]

Rearranging to solve for the recoil velocity of the gun (\(v_{\text{gun}}\)):

\[
v_{\text{gun}} = -\frac{m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{gun}}}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(m_{\text{bullet}} = 4.0 \, \text{g} = 0.004 \, \text{kg}\),
- \(v_{\text{bullet}} = 600 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(m_{\text{gun}} = 5.0 \, \text{kg}\),

we calculate:

\[
v_{\text{gun}} = -\frac{(0.004)(600)}{5.0} = -\frac{2.4}{5.0} = -0.48 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the gun recoils in the direction opposite to the bullet's motion. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: -0.48 m/sec**

Answer: F
