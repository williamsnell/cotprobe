Okay, so I've got this combinatorics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have a group of 10 people: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. We need to choose a committee of 4 people. There are two conditions:

1. A and B should not be chosen together.
2. A, C, F should not all be chosen together.

I need to find how many valid ways there are to form such a committee.

Hmm. So the total number of ways without any restrictions would be the combination of 10 choose 4, which is calculated as 10!/(4!6!) = 210. But of course, we have restrictions, so we need to subtract the cases that violate these conditions.

Wait, but I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let's break it down.

First, the total number of possible committees is 210. Now, I need to subtract the committees that violate either condition 1 or 2, but then add back any committees that were subtracted twice (those that violate both conditions), because I subtracted them once for each condition.

So, let's denote:

- Let S be the total number of committees without restrictions: S = 210.

- Let X be the number of committees where A and B are both present. These violate condition 1.

- Let Y be the number of committees where A, C, and F are all present. These violate condition 2.

We need to find S - (X + Y - Z), where Z is the number of committees that violate both conditions (i.e., committees that have both A and B, and also have A, C, F). Wait, but if a committee has A and B, and also includes C and F, then it's part of both X and Y, so Z would be the overlap.

So the formula becomes: Valid = S - X - Y + Z.

Wait, no. Wait, inclusion-exclusion says |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. So the number of invalid committees is X + Y - Z. So the valid committees would be S - (X + Y - Z).

Wait, let me make sure. The invalid committees are those that have A and B together (X), plus those that have A, C, F together (Y). But some committees are in both X and Y, so we subtract the overlap Z once because we've counted them twice in X+Y. So the total invalid is X + Y - Z. Thus, valid committees are S - (X + Y - Z) = S - X - Y + Z.

Alright, now I need to compute X, Y, and Z.

Let's compute X first: the number of committees where both A and B are present. If A and B are in the committee, that's 2 people. We need to choose 2 more from the remaining 8 people (since we started with 10 and already chose A and B). So X = C(8,2) = 28.

Wait, that's correct. Because when you have to include A and B, the remaining 2 spots are chosen from the other 8 people. So yes, 8 choose 2 is 28.

Now Y: the number of committees where A, C, and F are all present. So that's 3 people. We need to choose 1 more member from the remaining 7 people (since 10 -3 =7). So Y = C(7,1) =7.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait. Wait, the committee size is 4. So if A, C, F are all present, that's 3 spots. So we need one more from the remaining 7 people (since 10 total, minus A, C, F leaves 7). So yes, 7 ways. So Y=7.

Now Z is the number of committees that have both A and B, and also have A, C, F. So let's think: if a committee includes A, B, C, F, then that's 4 people already (A, B, C, F). So the committee is exactly these four, because the size is 4. Alternatively, could there be a fifth person? No, because the committee is size 4. So the only possible committee that satisfies both X and Y is the committee {A, B, C, F}. So Z is 1.

Wait, let me check. So if a committee includes A, B, C, and F, then it has A and B (so part of X), and it has A, C, F (so part of Y). So this committee is counted in both X and Y, so it's the only one in their intersection. So Z=1.

Wait, but another thought: could there be more than one committee that includes A, B, C, F, and someone else? No, because the committee is only 4 people. So if the committee is size 4, and includes A, B, C, F, then those four are all in, so no fifth person. So only one such committee exists.

So now, putting it all together:

Valid committees = S - X - Y + Z = 210 - 28 -7 +1.

Let's calculate that: 210 -28 is 182; 182 -7 is 175; 175 +1 is 176.

Wait, so the answer would be 176. Looking at the options, option F is 176.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Let me recheck each part.

Total S: 10C4 is indeed 210.

X is the number of committees including both A and B: 2 spots taken, so 8C2=28. Correct.

Y is the number of committees including A, C, F: 3 spots taken, so 7C1=7. Correct.

Z is the number of committees including A, B, C, F. Since committee size is 4, that's exactly one committee: A,B,C,F. So Z=1. Correct.

So 210 - 28 -7 +1 = 210 -35 +1 = 210 -34 = 176. So yes, 176.

Looking at the options, F is 176. So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of ways to choose a committee of 4 people from 10 without any restrictions, which is given by the combination formula:

\[
S = \binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

Next, we account for the restrictions:

1. **Condition 1**: A and B should not be chosen together. The number of committees where both A and B are included is calculated by choosing the remaining 2 members from the other 8 people:

\[
X = \binom{8}{2} = 28
\]

2. **Condition 2**: A, C, and F should not all be chosen together. The number of committees where A, C, and F are all included is calculated by choosing the remaining 1 member from the other 7 people:

\[
Y = \binom{7}{1} = 7
\]

3. **Overlap (Z)**: The number of committees that violate both conditions (i.e., committees that include A, B, C, and F) is exactly 1, as the committee size is 4 and no additional members can be included:

\[
Z = 1
\]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of invalid committees is:

\[
\text{Invalid} = X + Y - Z = 28 + 7 - 1 = 34
\]

Finally, the number of valid committees is:

\[
\text{Valid} = S - \text{Invalid} = 210 - 34 = 176
\]

Thus, the number of ways to choose the committee is **176**, which corresponds to option **F**.
