Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about electrolysis of water, and I need to figure out how much electricity is required to decompose 454 grams of water. Hmm, I remember that electrolysis uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction, in this case, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.

The reaction given is 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂. So, for every 2 moles of water decomposed, we get 2 moles of hydrogen and 1 mole of oxygen. But wait, the question is about the electricity required, so I think I need to relate this to Faraday's laws of electrolysis.

Faraday's laws say that the amount of substance that undergoes reaction at an electrode is proportional to the amount of electricity that passes through the electrolyte. One mole of electrons is called a Faraday (F), approximately 96,485 coulombs.

So, I need to find out how many moles of electrons are involved in this reaction. Let's break down the reaction. Each H₂ molecule has two H atoms. Each H⁺ gains one electron to become H₂. So for each H₂ molecule, 2 electrons are needed. Since there are 2 H₂ molecules, that's 2 * 2 = 4 electrons from hydrogen.

For oxygen, O₂ is produced from OH⁻ or O^− ions, depending on the electrolyte. Each O atom loses 4 electrons (since water is H₂O, oxygen is in -2 oxidation state; in O₂, it's 0, so each O loses 2 electrons. Since there are two O atoms in O₂, that's 4 electrons lost in total).

So total electrons involved: 4 (from H) + 4 (from O) = 8 electrons per reaction. Wait, let me think again. The overall reaction is 2 H₂O → 2 H₂ + O₂.

Breaking it down:

At the cathode (reduction): 2 H₂O + 2e⁻ → 2 OH⁻ + H₂ (but wait, that's per molecule. Alternatively, considering the decomposition, maybe each H₂O molecule contributes to H₂ and O₂.

Alternatively, I think each H₂ molecule requires 2 electrons (since each H⁺ gains one electron). So for 2 H₂, that's 4 electrons.

For O₂, each O atom goes from -2 in H₂O to 0 in O₂, so each O loses 2 electrons. There are two O atoms in O₂, so 4 electrons lost per O₂ molecule.

So total electrons per reaction: 4 (for H₂) + 4 (for O₂) = 8 electrons.

Wait, but wait: the overall reaction uses 2 moles of water. So for 2 moles of H₂O, we get 2 moles H₂ and 1 mole O₂.

So for each 2 moles H₂O decomposed, 8 moles of electrons are consumed (since 2 H₂ requires 4 moles e⁻, and O₂ requires 4, so total 8). So for each mole of reaction (which decomposes 2 moles H₂O), 8 moles of electrons are needed.

Wait, but in the reaction 2 H₂O → 2 H₂ + O₂, how many electrons are transferred? Let's calculate.

Each H₂ molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H comes from H⁺ (or H in H₂O). So each H requires one electron. So for 2 H₂, that's 2 * 2 = 4 electrons.

Each O in O₂ comes from OH⁻ or O^−. Each O in H₂O is at -2 oxidation state. In O₂, it's 0. So each O loses 2 electrons. Since there are two O atoms, that's 2 * 2 = 4 electrons lost.

So total electrons per reaction: 4 (for H) + 4 (for O) = 8 electrons.

But wait, electrons are gained (in reduction) and lost (in oxidation). So the total electrons transferred would be 8 per the reaction as written.

So each mole of reaction requires 8 moles of electrons.

Now, the question is about decomposing 454 grams of H₂O. So first, find the moles of H₂O.

Molar mass of H₂O is about 18 g/mol. So 454 g / 18 g/mol = approximately 25.222... moles.

Wait, let me calculate that. 18 times 25 is 450, so 454 is 25 and 4/18 = 25.222... So about 25.222 moles of H₂O.

The reaction uses 2 moles of H₂O, which requires 8 moles of electrons. So per mole of H₂O, how many electrons?

Wait, 2 moles H₂O → 8 moles e⁻. So per mole H₂O, it's 4 moles e⁻.

So for 25.222 moles H₂O, electrons needed are 25.222 * 4 = 100.888... moles of electrons.

Since 1 Faraday (F) is 1 mole of electrons, that would be approximately 100.888 F.

Looking at the options, option A is 100.8 faradays, which seems to match.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the stoichiometry.

In the reaction 2 H₂O → 2 H₂ + O₂:

Each H₂O molecule produces H₂ and O₂. Each H₂ molecule has 2 H, each requiring 1 e⁻ → so 2 e⁻ per H₂. With 2 H₂, that's 4 e⁻.

Each O in O₂ is from OH⁻ or O^−, which goes from -2 to 0, losing 2 e⁻ per O. So O₂ has 2 O atoms, so 4 e⁻ lost.

Total electrons per reaction: 4 (H) + 4 (O) = 8 e⁻.

So yes, for 2 moles H₂O, 8 moles e⁻ are needed. So per mole H₂O, 4 e⁻.

So for 25.222 moles H₂O, 25.222 *4 = 100.888 ≈ 100.9 faradays. So option A is 100.8, which is the closest.

So the answer should be A.

To determine how much electricity is required to decompose 454 g of water by electrolysis, we start with the reaction:

\[
2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2
\]

### Step 1: Molar mass of water
The molar mass of \( H_2O \) is approximately \( 18 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles of water is:

\[
\text{Moles of } H_2O = \frac{\text{Mass of } H_2O}{\text{Molar mass of } H_2O} = \frac{454}{18} \approx 25.222 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Electron requirement for the reaction
From the reaction, 2 moles of \( H_2O \) decompose to produce 2 moles of \( H_2 \) and 1 mole of \( O_2 \). Each \( H_2 \) molecule requires 2 electrons (1 electron per \( H \) atom), and each \( O_2 \) molecule involves 4 electrons (2 electrons per \( O \) atom). Thus, the total number of electrons required for the reaction is:

\[
\text{Electrons per reaction} = 4 \, (from \, H_2) + 4 \, (from \, O_2) = 8 \, \text{mol of electrons}.
\]

Since 2 moles of \( H_2O \) require 8 moles of electrons, the number of electrons per mole of \( H_2O \) is:

\[
\text{Electrons per mole of } H_2O = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \, \text{mol of electrons}.
\]

### Step 3: Total electrons required for 454 g of water
For 25.222 moles of \( H_2O \), the total number of electrons required is:

\[
\text{Total electrons} = 25.222 \times 4 = 100.888 \, \text{mol of electrons}.
\]

Since 1 Faraday (\( F \)) equals 1 mole of electrons, the total electricity required is approximately:

\[
100.888 \, F \approx 100.9 \, F.
\]

### Step 4: Matching the closest option
Among the given options, the closest value to \( 100.9 \, F \) is **100.8 faradays**.

### Final Answer:
