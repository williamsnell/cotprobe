Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about an ideal gas, and I need to find the number of moles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the gas is at 27°C and 380 torr. The volume is 492 cm³, and R is given as 0.082 liter·atm/(mole·K). I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, so I need to use that.

First, I should probably convert all the units to match the ones in R. So, let's see. Temperature is 27°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. To do that, I add 273.15. So 27 + 273.15 equals 300.15 K. I'll just round that to 300 K for simplicity, I think.

Next, pressure is given in torr. Oh right, 1 atm is 760 torr. So I need to convert 380 torr to atm. I'll divide 380 by 760. Let me calculate that: 380 divided by 760. Hmm, 380/760 is the same as 19/38, which simplifies to 0.5. Wait, no, 380 is half of 760, right? Oh wait, no, 760 is 1 atm, so 380 is exactly half an atm. So P is 0.5 atm.

Then the volume is 492 cm³. Oh, right, because R uses liters, I need to convert cm³ to liters. I know that 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 492 cm³ is 492/1000 liters. Let me do that calculation. 492 divided by 1000 is 0.492 liters.

So now I have P = 0.5 atm, V = 0.492 L, T = 300 K, and R = 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K). I need to find n. 

The formula is n = (P V) / (R T). Let me plug in the numbers.

First, multiply P and V. 0.5 atm times 0.492 L is... let's see. 0.5 times 0.492 is 0.246. So PV is 0.246 atm·L.

Then, R times T is 0.082 multiplied by 300. 0.082 times 300: 0.08 * 300 is 24, and 0.002*300 is 0.6, so 24.6. So RT is 24.6 atm·L/mol.

Now, divide PV by RT. That's 0.246 divided by 24.6. Hmm, 0.246 / 24.6. Let me calculate that. Well, 24.6 times 0.01 is 0.246. Oh wait, because 24.6 * 0.01 equals 0.246. So n is 0.01 moles? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait. Wait, 0.5 * 0.492 is indeed 0.246. And R*T is 0.082 * 300 = 24.6. So 0.246 / 24.6 = 0.01. Oh, so n is 0.01 moles. But looking at the options, option G is 0.0100 moles. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the unit conversions. The pressure conversion: 380 torr is half of 760 torr, so 0.5 atm. Volume is 492 cm³, which is 0.492 liters. Temperature is 300 K. R is correct as 0.082. So yeah, the calculation seems right.

So the number of moles is 0.01 moles, which is option G.

To determine the number of moles of the gas sample, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the given values to appropriate units
- **Temperature (T):** The temperature is given as \(27^\circ \text{C}\). Converting to Kelvin:
  \[
  T = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \approx 300 \, \text{K}.
  \]

- **Pressure (P):** The pressure is given as \(380 \, \text{torr}\). Converting to atm (since \(1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{torr}\)):
  \[
  P = \frac{380}{760} = 0.5 \, \text{atm}.
  \]

- **Volume (V):** The volume is given as \(492 \, \text{cm}^3\). Converting to liters (since \(1 \, \text{L} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3\)):
  \[
  V = \frac{492}{1000} = 0.492 \, \text{L}.
  \]

- **Gas constant (R):** The value of \(R\) is given as \(0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\).

### Step 2: Calculate the number of moles (n)
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}.
\]

- First, calculate \(PV\):
  \[
  PV = (0.5 \, \text{atm})(0.492 \, \text{L}) = 0.246 \, \text{L·atm}.
  \]

- Next, calculate \(RT\):
  \[
  RT = (0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(300 \, \text{K}) = 24.6 \, \text{L·atm/mol}.
  \]

- Now, divide \(PV\) by \(RT\):
  \[
  n = \frac{0.246}{24.6} = 0.01 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated number of moles is \(0.0100 \, \text{mol}\), which corresponds to **option G**.

Answer: G
