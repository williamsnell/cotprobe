Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrolytic cells in series. Hmm, I need to figure out how much copper was deposited when a certain amount of silver was deposited. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two electrolytic cells connected in series. One contains silver nitrate (AgNO3) and the other copper sulfate (CuSO4). Electricity is passed through them, and they deposit metals at the cathodes. I remember that in electrolysis, the amount of substance deposited depends on the current and time, following Faraday's laws.

Wait, so Faraday's first law says that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity used. But since the cells are in series, the same current flows through both. That means the same amount of charge goes through each cell. So whatever happens in one cell in terms of charge will be the same in the other.

The problem gives that 1.273 grams of silver were deposited. I need to find out how much copper was deposited in the same time. I think I should calculate the moles of silver first, then use that to find the moles of copper, and finally convert that to grams.

Silver's molar mass is about 108 g/mol, right? Or wait, no, wait. The atomic weight of silver is around 108. So 1.273 grams divided by 108 g/mol would give the moles of Ag deposited.

Let me calculate that. 1.273 / 108 ≈ 0.01179 moles of Ag. But wait, I recall that silver is deposited via the reaction Ag+ + e- → Ag. So each silver atom requires one electron. So the moles of electrons (charge) involved would be equal to the moles of Ag deposited.

Wait, yes. Faraday's law states that the moles of electrons (n) times Faraday's constant (F) times the charge, or Q = n F. So for Ag, each mole of Ag requires 1 mole of electrons because it's a +1 ion. So the total charge Q is F * moles of Ag.

Wait, but the same charge Q is passed through both cells. So the same Q is used in the copper cell. So for copper, which is Cu^2+ + 2e- → Cu, each mole of Cu requires 2 moles of electrons. So the moles of Cu deposited would be moles of electrons divided by 2.

So let me structure this:

1. Calculate moles of Ag: mass / molar mass Ag.
2. Moles of electrons for Ag: same as moles of Ag (since each Ag uses 1 e-).
3. Since the same electrons go into Cu, moles of Cu = moles of e- / 2.
4. Then, convert moles of Cu to grams using molar mass of Cu (about 63.55 g/mol).

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting this right. So for Ag:

Molar mass Ag is 107.87 g/mol, roughly 108. So 1.273 grams Ag is 1.273 / 107.87 ≈ 0.0118 moles Ag. That's correct.

Each mole of Ag requires 1 mole of electrons, so total electrons from Ag deposition is 0.0118 moles e-.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, the total charge Q is the same for both cells. So the same Q is used to calculate the deposition in both. So for Ag, n is 1 (because each Ag+ gains one electron). So Q = n * F * moles. So moles Ag = Q/(F * 1). For Cu, n is 2, so moles Cu = Q/(F * 2). So moles Cu = (moles Ag) * (1) / (2) = (1/2) * moles Ag.

Wait, that's a much simpler way to think about it. So the moles of Cu deposited would be half the moles of Ag deposited. Because Ag uses 1 e- per ion, Cu uses 2 e- per ion. So for each mole of Ag, you get 0.5 moles of Cu.

So moles Ag = 0.0118, so moles Cu = 0.0118 / 2 = 0.0059 moles. Then, mass of Cu is moles * molar mass. Molar mass of Cu is about 63.55 g/mol.

So 0.0059 * 63.55 ≈ 0.375 grams. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option G is 0.3749g. That's very close, so I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations more precisely. Maybe I approximated too much.

Let me recalculate the moles of Ag accurately.

Molar mass of Ag is 107.8682 g/mol. So 1.273 g / 107.8682 g/mol = approximately 0.0118 moles. Let's compute it exactly: 1.273 / 107.8682.

Hmm, 107.8682 * 0.0118 = approx 1.273. So that's correct.

So moles of Cu = 0.0118 / 2 = 0.0059. Molar mass of Cu is 63.546 g/mol.

So 0.0059 moles * 63.546 g/mol = let's compute that.

0.0059 * 63.546 = 0.3749 grams. So that's exactly option G: 0.3749g.

Wait, but another way to look at this is using the concept of equivalent weight. The equivalent weight is molar mass divided by valency. So for Ag, equivalent weight is 108 / 1 = 108 g/eq. For Cu, it's 63.55 / 2 = 31.775 g/eq.

Since the same current is passed through both, the amount of substance (in terms of equivalents) deposited would be the same. So the mass of Cu is (equivalent weight of Cu) times (mass of Ag / equivalent weight of Ag).

So mass of Cu = (31.775 g/eq) * (1.273 g / 108 g/eq) ) = (31.775 / 108 ) * 1.273.

Compute 31.775 / 108 = approximately 0.294. Then 0.294 * 1.273 ≈ 0.374 grams. So same as before.

Yes, that confirms it. So the correct answer should be G: 0.3749g.

To determine how much copper was deposited when 1.273 g of silver was deposited in two electrolytic cells in series, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Since the cells are in series, the same amount of charge flows through both cells, meaning the total moles of electrons used in silver deposition are the same as those used in copper deposition.

1. **Calculate moles of silver deposited**:  
   The molar mass of silver (Ag) is approximately 107.87 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ag} = \frac{\text{Mass of Ag}}{\text{Molar mass of Ag}} = \frac{1.273}{107.87} \approx 0.0118 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. **Determine moles of electrons used for silver deposition**:  
   Each silver ion (Ag⁺) requires 1 electron for reduction. Thus, the moles of electrons used are equal to the moles of Ag deposited:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of electrons} = 0.0118 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

3. **Calculate moles of copper deposited**:  
   For copper, each Cu²⁺ ion requires 2 electrons for reduction. Therefore, the moles of copper deposited are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Cu} = \frac{\text{Moles of electrons}}{2} = \frac{0.0118}{2} = 0.0059 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

4. **Convert moles of copper to grams**:  
   The molar mass of copper (Cu) is approximately 63.55 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Cu} = \text{Moles of Cu} \times \text{Molar mass of Cu} = 0.0059 \times 63.55 \approx 0.3749 \, \text{g}.
   \]

5. **Verify using equivalent weights**:  
   The equivalent weight of Ag is \( \frac{107.87}{1} = 107.87 \, \text{g/eq} \), and the equivalent weight of Cu is \( \frac{63.55}{2} = 31.775 \, \text{g/eq} \).  
   The mass of copper deposited is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Cu} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Ag}}{\text{Equivalent weight of Ag}} \right) \times \text{Equivalent weight of Cu}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Mass of Cu} = \left( \frac{1.273}{107.87} \right) \times 31.775 \approx 0.3749 \, \text{g}.
   \]

Both methods confirm that the mass of copper deposited is approximately **0.3749 g**, which corresponds to option **G**.
