Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how much money Sonia and Negin have left after they make their purchases. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

The problem says that Sonia and Negin together have $27.00. Then, Sonia buys a shirt for $12.35, and Negin buys a pair of sandals for $10.11. I need to find out how much money remains after these purchases.

Hmm, so first, I think I should add up the amounts they spent. Let me see, Sonia spent $12.35 and Negin spent $10.11. So together, they spent 12.35 + 10.11. Let me do that addition.

Wait, adding 12.35 and 10.11. Let me break it down. The dollars first: 12 + 10 is 22. Then the cents: 0.35 + 0.11. Oh, wait, 0.35 plus 0.11 is 0.46. So together, they spent $22.46.

Now, they started with $27.00. So the remaining money would be 27.00 minus 22.46. Let me calculate that. 

Subtracting 22.46 from 27.00. Maybe I can think of 27 as 22 + 5, so subtracting 22 leaves 5, and then subtract the 0.46 from that 5. So 5 minus 0.46 is 4.54. Wait, no, wait. Because 27 is 22 plus 5, but wait, that's not right. Wait, 22.46 subtracted from 27.

Alternatively, another way: 27.00 minus 22 is 5.00, and then I still need to subtract the 0.46. So 5.00 minus 0.46 is 4.54. So the remaining money should be $4.54.

Looking at the options, option C is $4.54. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So total spent is 12.35 + 10.11. Let's add them again:

12.35
+10.11
--------
22.46.

Yes, that's correct. Now, 27.00 minus 22.46. Let me write it out:

27.00
-22.46
--------
?

Starting from the cents: 0 minus 6. Can't do that, so borrow from the dollar. 10 minus 6 is 4. Then, the next digit: 9 (after borrowing) minus 4 is 5. Then, 6 (after borrowing) minus 2 is 4. So, 4.54. Yep, that's right.

So the remaining money is $4.54, which is option C.

The total amount Sonia and Negin spent is calculated by adding Sonia's $12.35 and Negin's $10.11, which equals $22.46. Subtracting this from their initial $27.00 leaves $4.54. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: $4.54

Answer: C
