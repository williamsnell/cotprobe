Question:

A toxicologist employed at the state crime laboratory testifies at a murder trial about the autopsy he performed on the victim. His testimony is that he detected traces of succinic acid and choline, the components of succinylcholine, in the victim's brain tissues. Over defense objections, he testified further that, in his opinion, the victim's cause of death was succinylcholine poisoning. On cross-examination, the toxicologist admitted that up until his findings, it had been universally accepted in the medical community that succinylcholine would be undetectable in the brain within a few minutes of its injection. He also admitted that his methods of detecting succinylcholine were experimental and that his results were not presently publishable because they were not complete enough. The defense attorney then makes a motion to strike the toxicologist's testimony regarding the cause of death. The court will most likely

Options:

A: deny the motion, because he was qualified to give an opinion on the ultimate issue of the case.
B: deny the motion, because the toxicologist's findings were based on his professional expertise.
C: deny the motion, because the toxicologist was qualified as an expert in medical matters.
D: deny the motion, because the court values the opinion of the state-employed expert.
E: grant the motion, because the toxicologist's opinion could not be substantiated.
F: deny the motion, because the toxicologist's opinion is the only evidence of the cause of death.
G: grant the motion, because the toxicologist was not properly qualified as an expert.
H: grant the motion, because the toxicologist admitted his findings contradicted accepted medical knowledge.
I: grant the motion, because the toxicologist's results were not complete enough to be published.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with expert testimony. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about a toxicologist testifying in a murder trial. He performed an autopsy and found traces of succinic acid and choline, which are components of succinylcholine. He then testified that, in his opinion, the cause of death was succinylcholine poisoning. The defense objected, but he was allowed to testify. On cross, he admitted a couple of things: first, that the medical community universally thought succinylcholine disappears from the brain within minutes, so it's undetectable. Second, his detection methods were experimental and his results weren't publishable yet because they're incomplete.

The defense moved to strike his testimony about the cause of death. The question is whether the court will grant or deny that motion.

So, the issue here is the admissibility of the toxicologist's expert opinion. Under evidence law, expert opinions must be based on reliable methods and principles. I remember that Frye v. United States sets the standard in some jurisdictions, requiring that the methodology be generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. Alternatively, under Daubert, the court acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that the expert's testimony is both reliable and relevant.

In this case, the toxicologist's methods are experimental and not yet published. Also, his findings contradict the established medical knowledgeâ€”since it's accepted that succinylcholine can't be detected after a few minutes. So, his opinion is based on methods that aren't widely accepted, which might make it inadmissible.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the court will deny the motion because he's qualified. But being qualified as an expert doesn't automatically make his opinion admissible; the basis of the opinion matters.

Option B: Deny because based on professional expertise. Similar issue; the reliability of the methodology is in question.

Option C: Deny because he's a medical expert. Again, his expertise doesn't override the need for reliable methods.

Option D: Deny because he's a state expert. That doesn't seem relevant; the court shouldn't favor state experts over others just because of their employer.

Option E: Grant because opinion can't be substantiated. If the methods aren't reliable, the opinion isn't substantiated, so this could make sense.

Option F: Deny because it's the only evidence. But even if it's the only evidence, if it's unreliable, it should be excluded.

Option G: Grant because not properly qualified. But the question says he's a toxicologist employed at the state crime lab, so he's likely qualified.

Option H: Grant because his findings contradict accepted knowledge. This seems relevant because if the method isn't accepted, the opinion is unreliable.

Option I: Grant because results not publishable. If the results are incomplete, that affects reliability. But the key issue is whether the methodology is accepted.

So, the main point is whether the expert's opinion meets the reliability standard. Since his methods are experimental and contradict established knowledge, his opinion on cause of death likely doesn't meet Frye or Daubert standards. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to strike that part of his testimony.

So, the correct options are either E, H, or I. But option H is about the contradiction, which directly relates to the reliability under Frye. Option I is about not being publishable, which is more about whether the methodology has been peer-reviewed, which is part of Daubert factors.

In this case, the toxicologist's methods are experimental and not accepted, so the court would likely exclude the opinion. So the best option is H: grant the motion because he admitted his findings contradict accepted medical knowledge.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a toxicologist's expert opinion regarding the cause of death in a murder trial. The toxicologist testified that succinylcholine poisoning was the cause of death, but admitted that his methods were experimental, his results were not publishable, and his findings contradicted the widely accepted medical understanding that succinylcholine becomes undetectable in the brain within minutes.

Under evidence law, expert opinions must be based on reliable methodologies. The Frye standard requires that scientific methods be generally accepted in the relevant community, while the Daubert standard emphasizes reliability and relevance. Here, the toxicologist's methods were experimental and not widely accepted, and his findings contradicted established medical knowledge. These factors undermine the reliability of his opinion, making it inadmissible.

Analyzing the options:

- **Options A, B, C, and D** focus on the toxicologist's qualifications or employment, which are irrelevant to the reliability of his methods.
- **Option E** suggests the opinion lacks substantiation, which is plausible but less specific than the contradiction of accepted knowledge.
- **Option F** argues the opinion is the only evidence, but even if so, unreliable evidence should still be excluded.
- **Option G** claims the toxicologist was not properly qualified, but his role as a state crime lab toxicologist suggests he was qualified.
- **Option H** highlights the contradiction of accepted medical knowledge, directly addressing the unreliability of his methods under Frye or Daubert.
- **Option I** focuses on the results not being publishable, which is relevant but secondary to the contradiction of established knowledge.

The most compelling reason to grant the motion is that the toxicologist's findings contradicted accepted medical knowledge, rendering his opinion unreliable.
