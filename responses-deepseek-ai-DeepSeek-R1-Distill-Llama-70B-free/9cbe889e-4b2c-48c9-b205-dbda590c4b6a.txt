Question:

Wolf claims that interpreting Kant’s ethics so that it consists of a finite set of constraints:

Options:

A: contradicts the basic principles of Kantian ethics.
B: simplifies the complexity of Kantian ethics.

D: makes it too lenient and flexible.
E: yields an unattractive picture of moral sainthood.
F: distorts the fundamental nature of the theory.
G: makes the theory too abstract and impractical.
H: implausibly places an “upper bound” on moral worthiness.
I: yields a theory that is too demanding.
J: results in a philosophical dilemma.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Kant's ethics. The question is asking what Wolf claims happens when you interpret Kant’s ethics as consisting of a finite set of constraints.

First, I need to understand what the question is about. From what I remember, Immanuel Kant's ethical theory is based on the concept of the categorical imperative, which is a moral principle that is universal and objective. His approach is deontological, focusing on duties and rules rather than consequences.

Now, the question mentions Wolf's critique. I'm not exactly sure who Wolf is, but I think she's a philosopher who has written about ethics, possibly in relation to Kant. From what I recall, Wolf might have argued against a strict, rigid interpretation of Kantian ethics, perhaps pointing out that it leads to an unattractive view of moral sainthood.

So, interpreting Kant's ethics as having a finite set of constraints would mean that there are specific, limited rules that must be followed. But if these constraints are too rigid or too few, it might lead to a situation where moral perfection is unattainable or where the moral ideal is too narrow. That could make the idea of moral sainthood seem unappealing because it's either impossible to achieve or it requires an unrealistic adherence to a limited set of rules.

Looking at the options, I see E says "yields an unattractive picture of moral sainthood." That seems to fit because if you have only a finite set of rules, maybe it makes the moral saint someone who is overly rigid or unrelatable. Alternatively, maybe it's too demanding because you have to follow all these rules strictly, which could be option I.

Wait, but I think Wolf's specific argument is about Kantian ethics leading to an unattractive moral sainthood. She might argue that the finite constraints make the moral ideal too strict or legalistic, which doesn't align well with human nature or more nuanced ethical situations.

Another angle is that if the constraints are finite, it might make the theory seem too simplistic, but that's option B. But the question is about Wolf's specific claim, which I think is more about the moral ideal being unappealing.

So I'm leaning towards option E: yields an unattractive picture of moral sainthood.

The question asks about Wolf's critique of interpreting Kant's ethics as consisting of a finite set of constraints. Kant's ethics, based on the categorical imperative, emphasizes universal moral principles. Wolf, a philosopher, critiques this interpretation, suggesting it leads to an unappealing view of moral sainthood due to its rigidity and narrowness.

E: yields an unattractive picture of moral sainthood.

Answer: E
