Okay, so I have this question about thin lenses and magnification. Hmm, I remember that magnification in optics relates to how much an image is enlarged or reduced compared to the object. Let me think about the formulas I learned.

The question gives a thin lens with a focal length of 50 mm. I need to find the magnification for three different object conjugates: 20 mm, -100 mm, and +100 mm. Wait, object conjugate usually refers to the object distance, right? So the object distance (u) is given, and I guess I'm supposed to find the image distance (v) each time and then compute the magnification.

I remember the lens formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is the focal length. Oh wait, but I should be careful with the signs. In optics, the sign conventions can be a bit tricky. Typically, for a converging lens (which I think this is since the focal length is positive), the object distance is positive when it's on the same side as the incoming light, which is usually the left side. So if the object is placed at u = 20 mm, that's positive because it's a real object. But wait, wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, no, the object distance u is positive when it's in front of the lens (real object) and negative when behind (virtual object). So for u = 20 mm, it's positive. For u = -100 mm, that would mean the object is 100 mm behind the lens, which I think is a virtual object. And u = +100 mm is a real object 100 mm in front.

So for each case, I'll calculate v using the lens formula, then find magnification m, which is -v/u, right? Because magnification m is the ratio of image height to object height, and it's given by m = -v/u. So the negative sign indicates whether the image is upright or inverted.

Let me tackle each case one by one.

First case: u = 20 mm. Since f is 50 mm, let's plug into the lens formula.

1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/50 = 1/20 + 1/v → Let me compute this. 1/20 is 0.05, 1/50 is 0.02. So 0.02 = 0.05 + 1/v → 1/v = 0.02 - 0.05 = -0.03 → v = -1/0.03 ≈ -33.333 mm. So the image is virtual and located 33.33 mm behind the lens (on the same side as the object). Now, the magnification m is -v/u. So u is 20, v is -33.33. So m = - (-33.33) / 20 = 33.33/20 = 1.666..., which is 5/3. Wait, 5/3 is approximately 1.666. Okay. So first magnification is 5/3.

Wait, but wait. The options don't have 5/3 in all cases. Let me check the options again. Option B has (5/3, 1/3, -1). Hmm, that's possible. Let me proceed.

Second case: u = -100 mm. So object is 100 mm behind the lens, which is a virtual object. Let's plug into the lens formula.

1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/50 = 1/(-100) + 1/v → 1/50 is 0.02, 1/-100 is -0.01. So 0.02 = -0.01 + 1/v → 1/v = 0.03 → v ≈ 33.333 mm. So image is real and 33.33 mm in front of the lens. Now magnification m is -v/u. u is -100, v is 33.33. So m = -(33.33)/(-100) = 0.3333, which is 1/3. So second magnification is 1/3.

Third case: u=+100 mm, so object is real and 100 mm in front. Using the lens formula again:

1/50 = 1/100 + 1/v → 0.02 = 0.01 + 1/v → 1/v = 0.01 → v=100 mm. So image is real and at 100 mm on the other side of the lens. Now magnification m is -v/u. u is 100, v is 100. So m = -100/100 = -1. So third magnification is -1.

Putting it all together, the magnifications are 5/3, 1/3, -1. Looking back at the options:

Option B: (5/3), (1/3), -1 → which matches what I got.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistake? Let me double-check each calculation.

First case: u=20, f=50.

1/50 = 1/20 + 1/v → 1/v = (1/50 - 1/20) = (4/100 -5/100) = -1/100 → v= -100 mm? Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait wait no, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me redo this.

Wait, 1/50 is 0.02, 1/20 is 0.05. So 0.02 = 0.05 + 1/v → 1/v = 0.02 - 0.05= -0.03 → v= -33.333 mm. Oh wait, no, 1/50=0.02, 1/20=0.05. So 1/v=0.02 -0.05= -0.03 → so v= -33.333 mm. So earlier calculation was correct. So m = -v/u → -( -33.333)/20 → 33.333/20=1.666=5/3. So yes, first is 5/3.

Second case: u=-100.

1/50=1/(-100) +1/v → 0.02 = -0.01 + 1/v → 1/v=0.03 → v=33.333 mm. So m = -v/u → -(33.333)/(-100) = 0.3333=1/3. So yes.

Third case: u=100.

1/50 =1/100 +1/v → 0.02=0.01 +1/v →1/v=0.01 →v=100. So m=-v/u= -100/100= -1.

So the three magnifications are 5/3, 1/3, -1. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the magnification for the given object distances, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

where \( f \) is the focal length, \( u \) is the object distance, and \( v \) is the image distance. The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}
\]

### Case 1: \( u = 20 \, \text{mm} \)
Using the lens formula:
\[
\frac{1}{50} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{v}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{50} - \frac{1}{20} = 0.02 - 0.05 = -0.03
\]
\[
v = -\frac{1}{0.03} \approx -33.33 \, \text{mm}
\]

The magnification is:
\[
m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{-33.33}{20} = \frac{33.33}{20} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

### Case 2: \( u = -100 \, \text{mm} \)
Using the lens formula:
\[
\frac{1}{50} = \frac{1}{-100} + \frac{1}{v}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{50} - \frac{1}{-100} = 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.03
\]
\[
v = \frac{1}{0.03} \approx 33.33 \, \text{mm}
\]

The magnification is:
\[
m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{33.33}{-100} = \frac{33.33}{100} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Case 3: \( u = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
Using the lens formula:
\[
\frac{1}{50} = \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{v}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{50} - \frac{1}{100} = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01
\]
\[
v = \frac{1}{0.01} = 100 \, \text{mm}
\]

The magnification is:
\[
m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{100}{100} = -1
\]

### Final Magnifications
The magnifications for the three cases are:
\[
\left( \frac{5}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, -1 \right)
\]

### Correct Option
The correct answer is **B**.
