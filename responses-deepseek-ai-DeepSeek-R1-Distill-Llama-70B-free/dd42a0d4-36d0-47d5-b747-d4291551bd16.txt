Question:

Consider the following three scenarios, which could be modeled using three data structures— dictionary/map, queue, and stack. Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance of the car wash, the driver gets out of the car. An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car. Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Scenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening. Which of the following shows the data structures that best model the scenarios? Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3

Options:

A: Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue
B: Queue | Stack | Dictionary/map
C: Stack | Stack | Queue
D: Stack | Queue | Dictionary/map
E: Stack | Dictionary/map | Queue
F: Queue | Queue | Stack
G: Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack
H: Dictionary/map | Dictionary/map | Stack
I: Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack
J: Dictionary/map | Queue | Queue

Okay, so I've got this question about data structures and scenarios. Hmm, I need to figure out which data structures correspond to each scenario. Let me read each scenario carefully.

Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance, the driver gets out, and an automatic pulley moves the car through. The driver walks to the exit to pay and pick up the car. Wait, so the cars are moving through in the order they arrived. The first car in the lane is the first one to be washed, right? So this sounds like a queue data structure because it's first in, first out. So Scenario 1 is a queue.

Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a talent show get a unique numeric ID when they register. So each contestant is assigned a number, and each ID is unique. I think this is like a dictionary or map. Because in a dictionary, each key is unique, and you can map it to a value. Here, the contestant's information is mapped by their unique ID. So Scenario 2 is a dictionary/map.

Scenario 3: Tennis balls in a cylindrical can. The can holds up to 3 balls. Each ball except the bottom one rests on the one below. They're placed one at a time through the top and removed the same way. Oh, that's a classic stack. Last in, first out. So the top ball is the first one to come out. So Scenario 3 is a stack.

Wait, let me double-check. 

Scenario 1: Queue makes sense because the first car in the queue is the first to be processed. So the structure is FIFO.

Scenario 2: Assigning unique IDs is definitely a mapping, so dictionary. Each contestant has a unique key (ID) associated with their data.

Scenario 3: Stack because the last ball placed is the first to be removed. So yes, stack.

Now, looking at the options, the order is Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3.

So Scenario 1 is Queue, Scenario 2 is Dictionary/Map, Scenario 3 is Stack.

Looking at the options:

Option G: Dictionary | Queue | Stack → No, because Scenario 1 should be Queue.

Wait, option G is Scenario1: Dictionary, which is wrong. Hmm.

Wait, let me check each option.

Option A: Dictionary | Stack | Queue → No, Scenario 2 is dictionary, so this would have Scenario1: Dictionary which is wrong.

Option B: Queue | Stack | Dictionary → No, because Scenario 3 would be dictionary but it should be stack.

Option C: Stack | Stack | Queue → No, scenario 1 is Queue.

Option D: Stack | Queue | Dictionary → No, scenario1 is Queue, not Stack.

Option E: Stack | Dictionary | Queue → No, scenario1 should be Queue.

Option F: Queue | Queue | Stack → Scenario2 is Queue, no, scenario2 is dictionary.

Option G: Dictionary | Queue | Stack → Scenario1 is Queue, but option G says scenario1 is Dictionary, which is wrong.

Option H: Dictionary | Dictionary | Stack → Scenario1 is Queue.

Option I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack → Oh wait, let me see. Scenario1 is Queue, Scenario2 is Dictionary, Scenario3 is Stack. So this matches I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack.

Wait, what's option I? Let me look again.

The options are labeled A to J. Let me list them:

A: Dictionary | Stack | Queue
B: Queue | Stack | Dictionary
C: Stack | Stack | Queue
D: Stack | Queue | Dictionary
E: Stack | Dictionary | Queue
F: Queue | Queue | Stack
G: Dictionary | Queue | Stack
H: Dictionary | Dictionary | Stack
I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack
J: Dictionary | Queue | Queue

So option I is Queue, Dictionary, Stack. Which matches our scenario assignments. So the correct answer should be option I.

Wait, but let me make sure. Scenario 1 is Queue (I's first is Queue), Scenario2 is Dictionary (I's second is Dictionary), Scenario3 is Stack (I's third is Stack). So yes, I is correct.

The question involves matching three scenarios to the appropriate data structures: dictionary/map, queue, and stack. Here's the analysis:

1. **Scenario 1**: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash, and the first car in the lane is the first one to be washed. This follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which is modeled by a **queue**.

2. **Scenario 2**: Contestants are assigned a unique numeric ID upon registration. This is a classic use case for a **dictionary/map**, where each unique ID (key) is associated with contestant data (value).

3. **Scenario 3**: Tennis balls are placed and removed from a cylindrical can one at a time through the same opening. The last ball placed is the first one removed, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which is modeled by a **stack**.

The correct data structure assignments are:
- Scenario 1: **Queue**
- Scenario 2: **Dictionary/Map**
- Scenario 3: **Stack**

Among the given options, **Option I** matches these assignments: **Queue | Dictionary | Stack**.
