Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a lunar landing craft needing to hover. Hmm, I remember that when something hovers, its engines are providing an upward thrust that balances the weight. Oh right, so thrust equals weight in that case.

Wait, the moon's gravity is given as g/6. Right, because the moon's surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's. So if Earth's g is around 9.8 m/s², then the moon's would be about 1.63 m/s².

The exhaust velocity is 2000 m/s. Oh, right, exhaust velocity is related to the rocket equation. I think the formula for the burn time or something like that comes into play here.

The fuel is 20% of the total mass. So if the total mass is M, the fuel mass is 0.2M. So the remaining mass after fuel is used would be 0.8M.

I remember that the rocket equation (or the equation for the vertical motion when thrust is involved) is something like the mass ratio. Oh wait, the formula is probably the one involving the natural logarithm of the mass ratio. 

Wait, the formula for the vertical velocity (like for a rocket) is Δv = ve * ln(M_initial / M_final). But wait, in this case, the craft isn't accelerating; it's just hovering. So maybe I'm mixing things up.

Hold on, when an object hovers, the thrust must equal its weight. Thrust is usually calculated as the exhaust velocity multiplied by the mass flow rate. So F = ve * (dm/dt), right? Because thrust is the exhaust velocity times the rate of mass expelled.

And the weight is mass times gravity. So, when hovering, F = m * g. So setting them equal: ve * (dm/dt) = m * g.

Wait, but here the mass m is the mass of the craft at any time t. Hmm, so this seems like a differential equation. Let me think. Let's denote the time as t, and the mass as a function of time.

So, ve * (dm/dt) = m(t) * g.

Wait, actually, wait. The force F is the thrust, which is ve * (dm/dt). Because dm/dt is the mass flow rate (dm/dt is negative, since mass is being expelled). So the thrust provides an upward force. The downward force is m(t) * g. So for equilibrium, ve * (dm/dt) = -m(t) * g.

Wait, but the signs can be tricky. Let me set up the equation correctly. Let's say that dm/dt is negative because the mass is decreasing. So:

Thrust: ve * (-dm/dt) (because dm/dt is negative, so -dm/dt is positive, giving upward force).

Downward force: m(t) * g (which is positive, since it's pulling the craft down).

So setting thrust equal to weight:

ve * (-dm/dt) = m(t) * g.

Wait, but let me rearrange that. Let's write it as:

dm/dt = - (m(t) * g) / ve.

This is a differential equation. It's a first-order linear DE. Solving this would give m(t), and then we can find the time when the fuel runs out.

The solution to dm/dt = -k m(t), where k is (g/ve), is an exponential decay. So m(t) = m_initial * exp(-kt).

Wait, but m_initial is the initial mass, and the fuel is 20% of that. So m_initial is the total mass, M, and the fuel is 0.2 M. So the remaining mass is M - 0.2 M = 0.8 M.

So the burn time occurs when m(t) = 0.8 M.

So plugging into m(t) = M exp(-kt), we get:

0.8 M = M exp(-kt).

Divide both sides by M:

0.8 = exp(-kt).

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(0.8) = -kt.

So t = - ln(0.8) / k.

But k is (g/ve), so t = - ln(0.8) * ve / g.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I have the variables right. Because g here is the moon's gravity, which is g_moon = g /6.

So substituting that in, t = - ve * ln(0.8) / (g_moon).

Putting in the numbers:

ve is 2000 m/s.

g_moon is (9.8 m/s²)/6 ≈ 1.633 m/s².

So let's compute this.

First, compute ln(0.8). Let's remember, ln(1) is zero. ln(e^(-x)) is -x. So ln(0.8) is a negative number.

Wait, 0.8 is 4/5, so ln(0.8) ≈ ln(4/5) = ln(4) - ln(5) ≈ 1.386 - 1.609 ≈ -0.223.

So ln(0.8) ≈ -0.2231.

So -ln(0.8) is 0.2231.

So t = 0.2231 * (2000) / ( (9.8)/6 )

Compute denominator: 9.8/6 ≈ 1.6333.

So 2000 / 1.6333 ≈ let's see: 2000 / 1.6333 ≈ 1224.4.

Multiply by 0.2231:

0.2231 * 1224.4 ≈ let's compute that.

0.2231 * 1200 = 267.72. 0.2231 * 24.4 ≈ approx 5.45. So total ≈ 273.17 seconds.

Hmm, looking at the options, option H is 273 s.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup. Because earlier I considered the fuel as 20% of the total mass, which is correct. So the initial mass is M, fuel is 0.2 M, and when it's all burned, mass is 0.8 M. So the burn time is when m(t)=0.8 M. So the equation should have m(t) = M exp(-kt). So when m(t) is 0.8 M, that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the rocket equation is written as delta v = ve ln(m_initial/m_final). So in this case, the delta v would be the velocity change, but since the craft is hovering, perhaps it's not moving, so delta v is zero. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward using the concept of specific impulse or something else.

Wait, but the approach I took earlier seems correct. Using differential equation for the mass loss and the thrust.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again. Let me compute 2000/(9.8/6) first.

9.8/6 is approximately 1.6333.

2000 / 1.6333 ≈ 1224.4 seconds^-1? Wait, no, because ve is 2000 m/s, and g is m/s², so the units would be (m/s) / (m/s²) )= s. So the denominator is 1.6333 m/s², so 2000 / (1.6333) is approximately 1224.4 s.

Wait, no, 2000 / 1.6333 is 1224.4.

Multiply by 0.2231: 0.2231 * 1224.4.

Let me calculate 0.2 * 1224.4 = 244.88, and 0.0231 * 1224.4 ≈ approx 28.25. So total is about 244.88 + 28.25 = 273.13 seconds. So approximately 273 seconds.

Looking back at the options, option H is 273 s, so that's the answer.

To determine how long the lunar landing craft can hover, we start by noting that the thrust must balance the weight of the craft. The thrust is given by \( F = v_e \cdot \frac{dm}{dt} \), where \( v_e \) is the exhaust velocity and \( \frac{dm}{dt} \) is the mass flow rate. The weight of the craft is \( F = m(t) \cdot g_{\text{moon}} \), where \( g_{\text{moon}} = \frac{g}{6} \) and \( g \approx 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \). Setting these equal gives:

\[
v_e \cdot \frac{dm}{dt} = -m(t) \cdot g_{\text{moon}}
\]

Rearranging, we obtain the differential equation:

\[
\frac{dm}{dt} = -\frac{m(t) \cdot g_{\text{moon}}}{v_e}
\]

This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its solution is:

\[
m(t) = m_{\text{initial}} \cdot e^{-\frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{v_e} t}
\]

The craft can hover until 20% of its total mass is expelled as fuel, leaving 80% of the initial mass. Thus, when \( m(t) = 0.8 \cdot m_{\text{initial}} \), we solve for \( t \):

\[
0.8 = e^{-\frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{v_e} t}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.8) = -\frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{v_e} t
\]

Rearranging for \( t \):

\[
t = -\frac{\ln(0.8) \cdot v_e}{g_{\text{moon}}}
\]

Substituting \( \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231 \), \( v_e = 2000 \, \mathrm{m/s} \), and \( g_{\text{moon}} = \frac{9.8}{6} \approx 1.633 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \):

\[
t = -\frac{-0.2231 \cdot 2000}{1.633} = \frac{0.2231 \cdot 2000}{1.633}
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{2000}{1.633} \approx 1224.4 \). Then:

\[
t \approx 0.2231 \cdot 1224.4 \approx 273 \, \mathrm{s}
\]

Thus, the craft can hover for approximately 273 seconds. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 273 s**
