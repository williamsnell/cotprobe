Okay, so I've got this question about vapor pressure of ethyl alcohol, and I'm a bit rusty on chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the vapor pressure of ethyl alcohol (C₂H₅OH) is 0.132 atm at 34.9°C and 0.526 atm at 63.5°C. They're asking what the vapor pressure would be at 19.0°C. The options are A to J, with various values.

Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure increases with temperature. So as temperature goes up, vapor pressure goes up too. That makes sense because higher temps give molecules more energy to escape into the gas phase. So at a lower temperature than the given points, the vapor pressure should be lower than both of those values.

Wait, the given temperatures are 34.9 and 63.5. 19 is lower than 34.9, so the vapor pressure should be lower than 0.132 atm. Looking at the options, I see that option C is 0.08, D is 0.025, E is 0.2, G is 0.0545, and F is 0.132. Wait, but 0.132 is the value at 34.9, so at 19 it should be less than that.

So the possible options are C, D, G. Let me think about how to estimate this. I think the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates vapor pressure and temperature. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). But wait, I don't have ΔHvap here. Maybe I can use the two given points to find it and then predict P at 19°C.

Let me jot down the given data. At T1 = 34.9°C, P1 = 0.132 atm. At T2 = 63.5°C, P2 = 0.526 atm. I need to find P3 at T3 = 19.0°C.

First, I'll convert the temperatures to Kelvin because the equation uses absolute temperature. So:

T1 = 34.9 + 273.15 = 308.05 K

T2 = 63.5 + 273.15 = 336.65 K

T3 = 19.0 + 273.15 = 292.15 K

Using the two points, I can calculate the slope of the ln(P) vs 1/T line. The equation in two-point form would be:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

I can rearrange this to solve for ΔHvap/R:

ΔHvap/R = [ ln(P2/P1) ] / [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Once I have that, I can use it to find P3 when T3 is 292.15 K.

Let me compute the values step by step.

Compute P2/P1: 0.526 / 0.132 ≈ 3.9848.

Take the natural log: ln(3.9848) ≈ 1.386.

Compute 1/T1 and 1/T2:

1/308.05 ≈ 0.003247 K⁻¹

1/336.65 ≈ 0.002971 K⁻¹

The difference: 0.003247 - 0.002971 = 0.000276 K⁻¹.

So ΔHvap/R = 1.386 / 0.000276 ≈ 5018.8 (unit would be 1/K, since R is in J/(mol·K), ΔH in J/mol, so ΔH/R is 1/K).

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but in the equation, it's (ΔHvap/R), so the unit is (J/mol)/(J/mol·K) = 1/K. So this value is about 5018.8 K.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.386 divided by 0.000276.

Wait, 0.000276 is 2.76e-4.

1.386 / 2.76e-4 = let's compute that.

Well, 1.386 / 0.000276 = approximately 5000. Because 0.000276 * 5000 = 1.38.

Yes, so 5018.8 K. Hmm.

Now, to find P3 at T3=292.15 K.

Using the equation again, but now between T1 and T3.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to use the two-point form again, using T3 and T1.

Wait, the general equation is ln(P) = - (ΔHvap/R)(1/T) + C, where C is a constant. Alternatively, using two points is better.

So using the first point (T1, P1) and the new point (T3, P3 unknown), the equation is:

ln(P3/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T3 )

Wait, no, let's get the formula right. The correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So for P3, it's ln(P3/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T3 )

We know ΔHvap/R is approximately 5018.8 K.

So let me compute 1/T1 = 1/308.05 ≈ 0.003247.

1/T3 = 1/292.15 ≈ 0.003424 K⁻¹.

So 1/T1 - 1/T3 = 0.003247 - 0.003424 = -0.000177 K⁻¹.

Multiply by ΔHvap/R (5018.8 K):

5018.8 * (-0.000177) ≈ -0.888.

So ln(P3/P1) ≈ -0.888.

Take exponentials on both sides:

P3/P1 = e^(-0.888) ≈ e^(-0.888).

What's e^-0.888? Let me think. e^-0.693 is 0.5, e^-1 is about 0.3679. So 0.888 is between 0.693 and 1.

Let me compute it more accurately. Maybe use a calculator approximation, but since I can't, I'll estimate.

We know that e^-0.8 is approximately?

Let me recall that e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.8 ≈ 0.4493, e^-0.9≈0.4066.

Wait, wait. Let me think. e^0.8 is about 2.2255, so e^-0.8 is 1/2.2255 ≈ 0.449.

Similarly, e^-0.88:

Let me think, maybe using a Taylor expansion or linear approximation around 0.8.

Alternatively, knowing that e^-0.88 = e^(-0.8 - 0.08) = e^-0.8 * e^-0.08.

e^-0.8 is approx 0.4493.

e^-0.08 is approximately 1 - 0.08 + (0.08)^2/2 ≈ 0.9231 (using Taylor series up to the second term).

Wait, more accurately, e^-x ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 for small x.

So x=0.08: 1 -0.08 + 0.0032= 0.9232. So e^-0.08 ≈ 0.9231.

So e^-0.88 ≈ 0.4493 * 0.9231 ≈ 0.415.

Wait, let me compute that: 0.4493 * 0.9231.

0.4493 * 0.9 = 0.40437.

0.4493 * 0.0231 ≈ 0.01038.

So total ≈ 0.41475.

So P3/P1 ≈ 0.41475.

P1 is 0.132 atm.

So P3 ≈ 0.132 atm * 0.41475 ≈ 0.0548 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.0545 atm, which is very close to 0.0548.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations because approximations can be tricky.

Alternatively, another approach: the Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be used with the given two points to extrapolate.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔHvap/R.

Wait, let's recalculate ΔHvap/R.

We had:

ln(P2/P1) = 1.386

1/T1 = 0.003247, 1/T2=0.002971. Their difference is 0.000276.

So 1.386 / 0.000276 = ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 0.000276 * 5000 = 1.38. So 1.386 is a bit more than 1.38.

So 1.386 / 0.000276 = 5000 + (0.006 / 0.000276).

Wait, 0.006 / 0.000276 = 6 / 0.276 ≈ 21.739.

So total is about 5021.739.

So approximately 5022 K.

Then, when computing ln(P3/P1) = (5022 K) * (1/T1 - 1/T3)

Wait, 1/T1 is 0.003247, 1/T3 is 0.003424. So 0.003247 - 0.003424 = -0.000177.

Multiply by 5022: 5022 * (-0.000177) = ?

5022 * 0.000177 = approximately 0.888.

So 5022 * (-0.000177)= -0.888.

So ln(P3/P1)= -0.888 → P3=0.132 * e^(-0.888) ≈ 0.132 * 0.414 ≈ 0.0547 atm.

Which is very close to option G (0.0545 atm). So that's probably the right choice.

Alternatively, perhaps using another approach to verify.

Another way is to assume that the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature is roughly exponential, so we can model it with two points and predict the third.

Alternatively, using linear approximation on a plot of ln(P) vs 1/T.

Since the data is limited, perhaps the calculation I did is sufficient.

So the answer should be G, 0.0545 atm.

To predict the vapor pressure of ethyl alcohol (C₂H₅OH) at 19.0°C, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- \( T_1 = 34.9^\circ\text{C} + 273.15 = 308.05 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 63.5^\circ\text{C} + 273.15 = 336.65 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_3 = 19.0^\circ\text{C} + 273.15 = 292.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Calculate \(\Delta H_{vap}/R\) using the two given data points
From the given data:
- \( P_1 = 0.132 \, \text{atm} \) at \( T_1 = 308.05 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_2 = 0.526 \, \text{atm} \) at \( T_2 = 336.65 \, \text{K} \)

First, compute \( \ln(P_2/P_1) \):
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{0.526}{0.132}\right) \approx \ln(3.9848) \approx 1.386
\]

Next, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \):
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{308.05} \approx 0.003247 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{336.65} \approx 0.002971 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.003247 - 0.002971 = 0.000276 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

Now, solve for \(\Delta H_{vap}/R\):
\[
\frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R} = \frac{\ln(P_2/P_1)}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}} = \frac{1.386}{0.000276} \approx 5018.8 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 3: Predict \(P_3\) at \(T_3 = 292.15 \, \text{K}\)
Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_3}\right)
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_3} \):
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = 0.003247 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_3} = \frac{1}{292.15} \approx 0.003424 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_3} = 0.003247 - 0.003424 = -0.000177 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

Substitute into the equation:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right) = 5018.8 \times (-0.000177) \approx -0.888
\]

Exponentiate to solve for \(P_3/P_1\):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = e^{-0.888} \approx 0.414
\]

Finally, solve for \(P_3\):
\[
P_3 = P_1 \times 0.414 = 0.132 \times 0.414 \approx 0.0548 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The closest value to \(0.0548 \, \text{atm}\) is \(0.0545 \, \text{atm}\), which corresponds to option **G**.
