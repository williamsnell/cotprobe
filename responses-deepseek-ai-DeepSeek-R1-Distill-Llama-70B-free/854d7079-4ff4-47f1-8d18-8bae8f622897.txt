Okay, so I have this question about what kind of goal money is. The options are A through G, each with different terms. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step.

First, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. I remember from some psychology classes that goals can be categorized as intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic goals are things you do for personal satisfaction, like hobbies or personal growth. Extrinsic goals are more about external rewards, like money or recognition.

So if I apply that here, money would be an extrinsic goal because it's something you work towards to get something else, not for the sake of doing it. But wait, the options include other terms too. Let me go through each option to make sure.

Option A: Extrinsic goal. That aligns with what I thought earlier. Money is a reward you get from outside, not something you do just because you enjoy it.

Option B: Ultimate goal. That sounds more like the end goal, the final purpose. Money isn't usually the end itself but a means to get other things.

Option C: Abstract goal. Abstract things are non-physical, like concepts. Money is more tangible, especially in the form of cash, so maybe not abstract.

Option D: Intrinsic goal. No, because intrinsic is about internal satisfaction, which money isn't directly.

Option E: Fundamental goal. That sounds like a basic or primary goal, but I'm not sure if that's the right term here.

Option F: Natural goal. Natural implies it's something inherent or from nature. Money is a human construct, so not natural.

Option G: Artificial goal. That makes sense because money is created by humans, not occurring naturally. So it's an artificial construct.

Wait, so now I'm a bit confused. Is money an extrinsic goal or an artificial goal? Both A and G seem possible.

Looking back, the question is asking what kind of a goal money is. Extrinsic refers to the motivation type, while artificial refers to the nature of the goal itself.

In the context of goals, I think extrinsic goals are about external rewards, which money certainly is. So the primary classification here would be extrinsic. But also, since money is something humans created, it's artificial. So which one is the correct answer?

I need to think about how these terms are typically used. The question is phrased as "what kind of a goal is money?" So it's about the type of goal, not whether it's natural or artificial.

In psychological terms, money is often cited as an extrinsic reward. So the answer would be A: Extrinsic goal.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up two different concepts. Let me clarify:

Extrinsic vs Intrinsic:
- Intrinsic: Doing something because it's enjoyable or fulfilling.
- Extrinsic: Doing something for external rewards, like money, grades, etc.

So money is definitely an extrinsic goal. That makes A correct.

But the option G is Artificial goal. Are they considering money as an artificial construct? Well, money is created by society, so it's an artificial thing, but as a goal, it's extrinsic.

So in this context, the question is about the category of the goal, so A is the right choice.

The question asks what kind of a goal money is, with options ranging from extrinsic to artificial. To determine the correct answer, it's important to analyze the definitions:

- **Extrinsic goal**: This refers to goals pursued for external rewards or benefits, such as money, recognition, or material possessions. Money fits this category because it is often sought for what it can provide, not for its inherent value.

- **Artificial goal**: This term suggests something created by humans rather than occurring naturally. While money is indeed an artificial construct, the question focuses on the type of goal rather than its nature.

Given the context of the question, the primary classification of money as a goal is best described as "extrinsic" because it serves as an external reward. While money is artificial, the more precise answer in this context is **A: Extrinsic goal**.

Answer: A
