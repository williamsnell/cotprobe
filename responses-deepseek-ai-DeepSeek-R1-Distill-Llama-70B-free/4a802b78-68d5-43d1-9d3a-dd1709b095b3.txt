Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the cost of on-the-job training per employee for the Judith Franklyn Corporation. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The company trained 1,240 employees and had several expenses related to the training. I need to find the cost per employee, which means I have to add up all the expenses and then divide by the number of employees.

Let me look at the expenses again. The categories are part-time instruction, janitorial services, books, supplies, and miscellaneous. Each has a specific amount. I should add all these together to get the total expense.

So, the part-time instruction is $114,770. Janitorial services are $6,080. Books cost $12,370. Supplies are $4,160, and miscellaneous is $6,150. I'll add these one by one.

Let me start adding. First, part-time instruction plus janitorial: 114,770 + 6,080. Let me calculate that. 114,770 + 6,080 is 120,850. 

Next, add the books: 120,850 + 12,370. Hmm, 120k plus 12k is 132k, and 850 + 370 is 1,220. So total becomes 133,120 + 1,220? Wait, no, 120,850 plus 12,370 is 133,220. Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully. 120,850 plus 10,000 is 130,850, then plus 2,370 is 133,220. Yeah, that's correct.

Now add the supplies: 133,220 + 4,160. Let's see, 133,220 + 4,000 is 137,220, plus 160 is 137,380.

Then the miscellaneous: 137,380 + 6,150. 137k plus 6k is 143k, and 380 + 150 is 530. So the total expense is $143,530. 

Wait, that makes the total cost $143,530. Now, I need to divide this by the number of employees, which is 1,240, to get the cost per employee.

So, 143,530 divided by 1,240. Let me do this division. Maybe I can simplify it. Let's see, 143,530 ÷ 1,240.

I can try to divide both numerator and denominator by 10 to make it easier: 14,353 ÷ 124.

Hmm, what's 124 times 100? That's 12,400. Subtract that from 14,353: 14,353 - 12,400 = 1,953.

So, 124 goes into 1,953 how many times? Let me see: 124 * 15 is 1,860. So 15 times. Subtract that from 1,953: 1,953 - 1,860 = 93.

So now, I have 100 + 15 = 115, with a remainder of 93. So that's 115 and 93/124.

Wait, 93/124 is approximately 0.75, because 124 * 0.75 is 93. So the total per employee is about $115.75.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $115.75. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when adding, it's easy to slip up.

Adding the expenses again step by step:

Part-time: 114,770
+ Janitorial: 6,080 → Total 120,850
+ Books: 12,370 → 133,220
+ Supplies: 4,160 → 137,380
+ Miscellaneous: 6,150 → 143,530. Yes, that's correct.

Then, 143,530 ÷ 1,240. Let me try another approach. Maybe convert 1,240 into 1.24 thousand, but perhaps it's easier to see as:

1,240 employees, so each employee's cost is total divided by 1,240.

Alternatively, 143,530 ÷ 1,240. Let me write this as:

143,530 ÷ 1,240 = ?

Well, 1,240 * 100 = 124,000. So 143,530 - 124,000 = 19,530. 

Now, 1,240 * 15 = 18,600. So 100 + 15 = 115, and 19,530 - 18,600 = 930.

So, 930 left. 1,240 goes into 930 how many times? Less than once, so 0.75 times because 1,240 * 0.75 = 930.

So total is 115.75. Yep, that confirms it.

So the correct answer should be I: $115.75.

To determine the cost of on-the-job training per employee, we first calculate the total expenses by summing all the given categories:

- **Part-time instruction**: $114,770  
- **Janitorial services**: $6,080  
- **Books**: $12,370  
- **Supplies**: $4,160  
- **Miscellaneous**: $6,150  

Adding these together:  
\[
114,770 + 6,080 = 120,850  
\]  
\[
120,850 + 12,370 = 133,220  
\]  
\[
133,220 + 4,160 = 137,380  
\]  
\[
137,380 + 6,150 = 143,530  
\]  

The total expense for the training is **$143,530**.  

Next, we divide the total expense by the number of employees (1,240) to find the cost per employee:  
\[
\frac{143,530}{1,240} = 115.75  
\]  

Thus, the cost of the on-the-job training per employee is **$115.75**.  

The correct answer is **I: $115.75**.
