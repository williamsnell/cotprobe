Question:

A company that produces facial tissues continually monitors tissue strength. If the mean strength from sample data drops below a specified level, the production process is halted and the machinery inspected. Which of the following would result from a Type I error?

Options:

A: Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is within specifications.
B: Halting the production process without any data on tissue strength.
C: Halting the production process when the machinery needs inspection.
D: Not halting the production process despite customer complaints.
E: Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is below specifications.
F: Halting the production process when the tissue strength is below specifications.
G: Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is above specifications.
H: Halting the production process when sufficient customer complaints are received.
I: Halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications.
J: Halting the production process when the tissue strength is above specifications.

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about Type I errors. Hmm, I remember that Type I errors are a concept from hypothesis testing. Let me think... A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis, but it's actually true. So, it's a false positive.

The question is about a company that makes facial tissues. They monitor the strength, and if the mean drops below a certain level, they stop production to inspect the machinery. So, the setup is probably a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the tissue strength is at or above the specified level. The alternative hypothesis would be that it's below that level.

So, the null hypothesis (H0) is: mean strength ≥ specified level. The alternative (H1) is: mean strength < specified level.

A Type I error would be incorrectly rejecting H0 when it's actually true. That means the company would stop production even though the strength is still okay. So, the error is halting production unnecessarily because the sample data made them think the strength is below when it's not.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Allowing production to continue when strength is within specs. That's correct behavior, not an error.

Option B: Halting without data. Not sure, but seems unrelated to the hypothesis setup.

Option C: Halting when machinery needs inspection. That's the correct action if strength is actually low, so it's not an error.

Option D: Not halting despite complaints. That's a Type II error, failing to detect a real problem.

Option E: Allowing production when strength is below. That's a Type II error because you're not stopping when you should.

Option F: Halting when strength is below. Correct action, not an error.

Option G: Allowing when strength is above. That's correct, as it's within specs.

Option H: Halting based on complaints, not data. Not directly related to the hypothesis test scenario.

Option I: Halting when strength is within specs. Oh wait, that fits the Type I error. Because the process is halted even though the strength is okay.

Option J: Halting when strength is above. That doesn't make sense; why stop if it's above? But the question is about stopping when it's not needed, so this could be a Type I error as well.

Wait, but Type I is about rejecting H0 which is strength >= level. So, if H0 is true (strength is okay), but you reject it (halt production), that's Type I.

So, which options involve halting when the strength is within specs?

Looking back, Option I says halting when within specs, which is exactly a Type I error.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

In this scenario, the company is monitoring tissue strength, and a Type I error occurs when the production process is halted even though the tissue strength is within specifications. This happens because the sample data incorrectly leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis (tissue strength ≥ specified level) when it is actually true.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** directly describes halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications, which aligns with the definition of a Type I error.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
