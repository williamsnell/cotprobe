Okay, so I've got this problem here about NFL players' weights and statistics. Hmm, let me read it again. The average weight is 248 pounds with a standard deviation of 47 pounds. They're talking about selecting four players at random, and the expected value for the total weight W is 992 pounds. But the question is about the standard deviation of W.

Wait, I remember that when you have the sum of independent random variables, the variance adds up. Oh right, because variance is additive for independent variables, regardless of whether they're identical or not. So for the standard deviation, it's the square root of the sum of variances.

So each player's weight has a standard deviation of 47. Since variance is the square of standard deviation, each has a variance of 47^2, which is 2209. Now, when you have four players, the total variance would be 4 times 2209 because each contributes their own variance. So 4 * 2209 is 8836. Then, the standard deviation is the square root of 8836.

Let me calculate that. The square of 94 is 8836 because 90^2 is 8100 and 4^2 is 16, but wait, 94^2 is (90+4)^2 = 90^2 + 2*90*4 +4^2 = 8100 + 720 +16= 8836. Oh right! So the standard deviation of W is 94 pounds.

Looking at the options, option A is 94 pounds. So the answer should be A.

The problem involves calculating the standard deviation of the total combined weight \( W \) of four NFL players, given that each player's weight has a mean of 248 pounds and a standard deviation of 47 pounds. 

For independent random variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances. The variance of a single player's weight is \( 47^2 = 2209 \). Since there are four players, the total variance of \( W \) is \( 4 \times 2209 = 8836 \). The standard deviation of \( W \) is the square root of this variance: 

\[
\sqrt{8836} = 94 \, \text{pounds}.
\]

Thus, the standard deviation of \( W \) is 94 pounds, which corresponds to option A.
