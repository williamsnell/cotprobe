Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find all c in Z_3 such that the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field. Hmm, I remember that for a ring of the form F[x]/(p(x)) to be a field, the polynomial p(x) must be irreducible over the field F. So in this case, F is Z_3, which is the field with three elements {0, 1, 2}.

First, I need to figure out for which values of c the polynomial x³ + x² + c is irreducible over Z_3. Since we're working in Z_3, c can be 0, 1, or 2. So I guess I'll check each possible value of c in Z_3 and see if the resulting polynomial is irreducible.

Wait, but the options go beyond 0, 1, 2. Oh wait, no, the options are labeled with numbers, but since we're in Z_3, each option corresponds to its equivalence class mod 3. So for example, option A is -2, which is equivalent to 1 mod 3 because -2 +3 =1. Similarly, option B is 2, which is 2 mod3. Option C is 1, D is -1 which is 2 mod3, E is -3 which is 0 mod3, F is 0, G is 3 which is 0 mod3, H is4 which is 1 mod3, I is6 which is 0 mod3, J is5 which is 2 mod3.

Wait, maybe I should just consider c in {0,1,2} and evaluate for each case whether the polynomial is irreducible. Then I can map the answer options accordingly.

So for each c in {0,1,2}, I'll check if x³ + x² + c can be factored into lower-degree polynomials over Z_3. If it can't be factored, then it's irreducible, and the quotient ring is a field.

Let me start with c=0. The polynomial becomes x³ + x². I can factor this as x²(x +1). So it factors into x² and (x+1), meaning it's reducible. So c=0 won't work.

Next, c=1. The polynomial is x³ +x² +1. I need to check if this factors. Since it's a cubic, it's irreducible over Z_3 if it has no roots in Z_3. So let's check for roots. Let's plug in x=0: 0+0+1=1≠0. x=1:1+1+1=3≡0 mod3. Oh, so x=1 is a root. That means (x-1) is a factor, so the polynomial factors as (x-1)(x² + ax + b). Let me perform the division to find a and b.

Dividing x³ +x² +1 by (x-1) in Z_3. Alternatively, since in Z_3, 1 is the same as -2, maybe using synthetic division.

Using synthetic division for root at x=1:

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 1 (x²), 0 (x), 1 (constant).

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 1: 1*1=1. Add to next coefficient:1+1=2.

Multiply by1: 2*1=2. Add to next coefficient:0+2=2.

Multiply by1:2*1=2. Add to last coefficient:1+2=3≡0.

So the quotient is x² + 2x + 2. Thus, x³ +x² +1 factors as (x-1)(x² + 2x +2) in Z_3. Therefore, it's reducible. So c=1 is not suitable.

Now, check c=2. The polynomial is x³ +x² +2. Let's see if it has any roots in Z_3.

x=0: 0 +0 +2=2≠0.

x=1:1 +1 +2=4≡1≠0 mod3.

x=2:8 +4 +2=14≡2≠0 mod3.

So no roots in Z_3, which suggests that it might be irreducible. But wait, since it's a cubic, even if it has no roots, it might still factor into a quadratic and a linear term, but in this case, the lack of roots implies that it's irreducible because if it had a quadratic factor, then the quadratic would have to have roots, but wait, no. Wait, for cubic polynomials, having no roots implies irreducibility over a field, right? Because any reducible cubic would have at least a linear factor, which would correspond to a root.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check by trying to factor it into a product of lower-degree polynomials. But since it has no roots, it can't have a linear factor, so if it's reducible, it would have to factor into a quadratic and a linear term, but without a linear term, so perhaps it's irreducible.

Wait, if a cubic polynomial over a field has no roots, then it's irreducible. Because any factorization would require a linear term, which would correspond to a root. So since x³ +x² +2 has no roots in Z_3, it's irreducible. Therefore, when c=2, the polynomial is irreducible, so the quotient ring is a field.

Wait, but I've got to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me try another approach. Perhaps try to see if it can be written as a product of a quadratic and a linear term, even though there's no root. But without a root, that's impossible, so it's indeed irreducible.

So the only c in Z_3 that makes the polynomial irreducible is c=2. Wait, but let me double-check for possible calculation errors.

Wait, c=2: x³ +x² +2.

Testing x=0: 0+0+2=2≠0.

x=1:1+1+2=4≡1≠0.

x=2:8+4+2=14≡2≠0. So no roots.

Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible when c=2.

Now, looking back at the options, c=2 is option B. So the answer should be B.

But wait, I should make sure that there aren't other possible c's. Let me double-check c= -1 mod3, which is 2 mod3. So that's the same as c=2. So yeah, only c=2 works.

Wait, but wait, option D is -1, which is 2 mod3, same as option B. So perhaps both options B and D are same as c=2. Oh wait, no. Let's check the options:

Options are:

A: -2 →1 mod3

B:2 →2 mod3

C:1→1

D:-1→2

E:-3→0

F:0

G:3→0

H:4→1

I:6→0

J:5→2

So both B (2) and D (-1) and J (5) are equivalent to 2 mod3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the question asks for c in Z_3, so each c is unique mod3. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering all possible c's. Wait, in Z_3, c can only be 0,1,2. So when the problem says "find all c in Z_3", the possible answers are only 0,1,2. So in the options, the correct c would be 2, which is option B, D, J. Wait, but the options are labeled as A through J, each with a specific number, but their equivalence mod3 is what determines c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for all integers c such that when taken mod3, the polynomial is irreducible. So the correct c's mod3 are 2. So the answer options that are ≡2 mod3 are B (2), D (-1), and J (5). So the possible answers would be B, D, J.

But wait, the question says "find all c in Z_3", so c must be 0,1,2. The correct c is 2. So the answer is c=2, which in the options is option B. But perhaps the way the options are given, multiple options correspond to c=2 mod3, like B, D, J. But the problem is presented as a multiple-choice with one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but maybe I should re-examine whether c=2 is the only solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for c=1. Let me check again.

When c=1, the polynomial is x³ +x² +1.

Testing x=0:0+0+1=1≠0.

x=1:1+1+1=3≡0. So x=1 is a root. Therefore, the polynomial factors as (x-1)(x² + 2x +2). So it's reducible. So c=1 is out.

c=0: polynomial is x³ +x²= x²(x+1), reducible.

c=2: no roots, so irreducible.

So only c=2 mod3 is acceptable.

Looking back at the options, option B is 2, which is correct. So the answer is B.

But the options given include other numbers. Wait, maybe the question is asking for all possible answers, but the way the options are presented, perhaps only one option is correct. Looking at the problem statement again, it says "find all c in Z_3", and the options are individual values, so perhaps the answer is c=2, which is option B. Alternatively, the options might have multiple correct answers, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check for another possible c. Let me see if I made a mistake when c= -1, which is 2 mod3. Oh, that's same as c=2, so same result.

Wait, another approach: over Z_3, the polynomial x³ +x² +c is irreducible iff it has no roots and cannot be factored into a product of lower-degree polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps the polynomial could be factored into three linear terms, but without a root, that's impossible. So if it has no roots, it's irreducible.

So only c=2 works.

So the answer is B.

To determine all \( c \in \mathbb{Z}_3 \) such that \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) is a field, we need to ensure that the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). A ring of the form \( F[x]/(p(x)) \) is a field if and only if \( p(x) \) is irreducible over the field \( F \).

### Analysis for Each \( c \in \mathbb{Z}_3 \):
1. **Case \( c = 0 \):**  
   The polynomial becomes \( x^3 + x^2 = x^2(x + 1) \). This is reducible, so \( c = 0 \) does not work.

2. **Case \( c = 1 \):**  
   The polynomial is \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \). Testing for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \):  
   - \( x = 0: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)  
   Thus, \( x = 1 \) is a root, and the polynomial factors as \( (x - 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2) \). This is reducible, so \( c = 1 \) does not work.

3. **Case \( c = 2 \):**  
   The polynomial is \( x^3 + x^2 + 2 \). Testing for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \):  
   - \( x = 0: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \equiv 1 \neq 0 \mod 3 \)  
   - \( x = 2: 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \equiv 2 \neq 0 \mod 3 \)  
   Since there are no roots, the polynomial cannot have a linear factor. A cubic polynomial over a field is irreducible if it has no roots, so \( x^3 + x^2 + 2 \) is irreducible. Thus, \( c = 2 \) works.

### Mapping to the Options:
The options are labeled with integers, but since we are working in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), we interpret each option modulo 3:  
- \( c = 2 \mod 3 \) corresponds to **Option B**.  
- Other options (e.g., \( -1 \mod 3 = 2 \), \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \)) also correspond to \( c = 2 \), but the problem asks for a single answer, so the correct choice is **Option B**.

### Final Answer:
B
