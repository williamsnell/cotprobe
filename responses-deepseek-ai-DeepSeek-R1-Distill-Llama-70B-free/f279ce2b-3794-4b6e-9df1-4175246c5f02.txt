Okay, so I've got this problem here where I have to find the mean, median, and mode of a series of numbers. The numbers given are: 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First off, I'm a bit rusty on these terms, but I remember that mean is the average, median is the middle value, and mode is the most frequent number. Let me tackle each one by one.

Starting with the mean. To find the mean, I need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Let's count them: 500, 600, 800, 800, then five 900s, 1000, 1100. Oh wait, that's 11 numbers in total. So I'll add them up.

Let me write them down to make sure I don't miss any:

500 + 600 = 1100.

Then 800 + 800 = 1600. So up to here, 1100 + 1600 = 2700.

Next are the 900s. There are five of them. So 900 * 5 = 4500. Adding that to 2700 gives 7200.

Then 1000 and 1100. 7200 + 1000 = 8200, plus 1100 is 9300.

So total sum is 9300, and there are 11 numbers. Mean is 9300 divided by 11. Let me calculate that: 9300 / 11. 11 times 845 is 9295 (since 845 * 10 is 8450, plus 845 is 9295). So 9300 - 9295 is 5. So 845 and 5/11, which is approximately 845.45. So the mean is 845.45.

Next up is the median. Median is the middle number when the data is ordered from smallest to largest. Since there are 11 numbers, which is odd, the median will be the 6th number. Let me list them in order again to be sure.

The numbers in order are: 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100.

Wait, that's correct. So the 6th number is the one right in the middle. Let's count: 1st is 500, 2nd 600, 3rd 800, 4th 800, 5th 900, 6th 900. So the median is 900.

Now the mode. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the list: 500 once, 600 once, 800 twice, 900 five times, 1000 once, 1100 once. So 900 appears the most, five times. So mode is 900.

So putting it all together: mean is approximately 845.45, median is 900, mode is 900.

Now I need to look at the options. Let me go through them.

Option A: Mean 900, median 800, mode 1000. No, because mean is 845, median 900, mode 900.

Option B: Mean 845.45, median 900, mode 900. That's exactly what I got. So B looks correct.

But wait, let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option C: Mean 845.45, median 900, mode 1000. Mode is wrong here.

Option D: Mean same, but median 800 and mode 800. Nope.

Option E: Mean 800, which is wrong.

Option F: Mean 1100, way off.

Option G: Mean 900, which is higher than calculated.

Option H: Median is 845, which is the mean actually. So no.

Option I: Mean 800, again no.

Option J: Mean 850, which is close but not exact. Also, mode is 800, which is wrong.

So the correct one is Option B: Mean 845.45, Median 900, Mode 900.

To determine the mean, median, and mode of the dataset: 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100:

1. **Mean**: The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.  
   - Sum = 500 + 600 + 800 + 800 + 900 + 900 + 900 + 900 + 900 + 1000 + 1100 = 9300  
   - Number of values = 11  
   - Mean = \( \frac{9300}{11} \approx 845.45 \).

2. **Median**: The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Since there are 11 values, the median is the 6th value.  
   - Ordered data: 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, **900**, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100  
   - Median = 900.

3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently.  
   - 500 appears once, 600 appears once, 800 appears twice, 900 appears five times, 1000 appears once, 1100 appears once.  
   - Mode = 900.

Thus, the mean is approximately 845.45, the median is 900, and the mode is 900. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**B: Mean: 845.45, Median: 900, Mode: 900.**
