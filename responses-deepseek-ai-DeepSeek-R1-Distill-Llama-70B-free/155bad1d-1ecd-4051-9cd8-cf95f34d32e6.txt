Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Hume's attack on natural law. Hmm, I remember that Hume was a philosopher, right? He was a bit of a skeptic, I think. Let me try to recall what I know about his views.

Natural law theories usually argue that there's a moral law inherent in nature, discoverable through reason. Thinkers like Locke believed in natural rights based on this. But Hume had some issues with that. Wait, wasn't Hume critical of the idea that we can derive "ought" from "is"? Like, he said that just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it ought to be that way. That's the is-ought problem, I think.

So, the question is asking about Hume's attack on natural law. The options are A to D. Let me go through them.

Option A: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong. That sounds a bit like moral subjectivism. But wait, Hume was more about morality being based on sentiment rather than reason. He didn't exactly say we can't know morality; he thought it's rooted in human emotions and experiences. So maybe this isn't the main point of his attack on natural law.

Option B: Natural law is backward-looking. Hmm, natural law is often seen as a set of principles derived from human nature, which is more about being universal and timeless. I'm not sure how being backward-looking ties into Hume's critique. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Option C: There is no such thing as a social contract. Oh, right! Hume was critical of the social contract theory. He argued that governments derive their authority from long-standing conventions and habits, not from a hypothetical contract. But wait, the question is about his attack on natural law, not directly on the social contract. Although natural law and social contract theories are related, as Locke connected them. So maybe this isn't the exact answer.

Option D: Natural law fails to protect the state against attacks. That doesn't ring a bell. I think Hume's critiques were more about the philosophical underpinnings rather than practical applications like state protection. So probably not D.

Wait, going back to Hume's is-ought problem. He argued that natural law theorists try to derive moral obligations from observations about nature, which isn't logically valid. So this would relate to the idea that we can't objectively know moral truths because they're not based on facts. Or wait, maybe it's more about the impossibility of deriving "ought" from "is," which would tie into option A because if you can't derive it, maybe we can't objectively know it.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Hume's main point was that you can't move from descriptive statements (is) to prescriptive ones (ought) without some non-logical step. So natural law, which tries to find moral laws in nature (which is an 'is'), can't logically lead to moral 'oughts.' Therefore, Hume is attacking the basis of natural law as being flawed in its reasoning.

So the attack is on the idea that we can know objective moral truths through reason from nature. Thus, option A would say we can't objectively know what's right or wrong, which aligns with Hume's skepticism about deriving morality from nature.

Wait, but option C is about the social contract. I think Hume did argue against the idea of an original contract, but the question is specifically about natural law. So maybe the answer is A.

Alternatively, another angle: Hume's critique of natural law might be that it's based on reason, but he believes morality is based on sentiment. So natural law's approach is wrong because it relies on reason to discover moral truths, which Hume rejects. But that would tie back to whether we can know objective moral truths, which is option A.

I'm leaning towards option A as the answer. But wait, another thought: Hume's essay "Of the Original Contract" critiques the social contract theory, which is separate from natural law. So maybe the correct answer is C, but I thought the question was about natural law.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up his different critiques. Hume attacked both natural law and social contract. But the question is about his attack on natural law specifically. So natural law is about objective moral truths based on reason. Hume's is-ought problem undermines that, suggesting that such derivation isn't possible, which would mean we can't objectively know moral truths from nature. So that would point to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

Hume's main issue with natural law is that it's based on the mistaken idea that we can derive moral obligations from facts about nature. So he argues that just because something is natural doesn't mean it's morally good. For instance, Hume would say that even if humans are social creatures by nature, it doesn't automatically follow that certain social structures are morally required. Therefore, natural law fails because it can't bridge the is-ought gap, which means we can't objectively determine moral truths through reason alone. That would support option A.

So putting it all together, I think the answer is A: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong.

Hume's attack on natural law is rooted in his philosophical skepticism, particularly his argument that it is impossible to derive moral obligations ("ought") from observations about nature ("is"). This is known as the is-ought problem. Natural law theories posit that moral truths can be discovered through reason by examining human nature and the natural order. However, Hume contends that this approach is fundamentally flawed because it attempts to move from descriptive statements about the world to prescriptive moral claims without a logical basis. This critique implies that we cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong based on natural law, as morality is instead rooted in human sentiment and experience rather than reason.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** aligns with Hume's argument that we cannot objectively know moral truths through natural law because it fails to bridge the is-ought gap.
- **Option B** is incorrect because natural law is not inherently backward-looking; it is often seen as universal and timeless.
- **Option C**, while relevant to Hume's broader critiques, pertains to his rejection of social contract theory, not specifically his attack on natural law.
- **Option D** is unrelated to Hume's philosophical arguments and focuses on practical applications, which is not the core of his critique.

Thus, the correct answer is **A: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong.**
