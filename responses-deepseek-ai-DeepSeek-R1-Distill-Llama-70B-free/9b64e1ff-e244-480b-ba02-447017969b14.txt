Question:

A common method for commercially peeling potatoes is to soakthem for 1 - 5 minutes in a 10 - 20% solution ofNaOH (molecularweight = 40.0 g/mole) at 60 - 88°C, and to spray offthe peel once the potatoes are removed from solution. As aneconomy measure, a manufacturer titrates theNaOH solutionwith standardized H_2SO_4 (molecular weight = 98.0 g/mole) at the end of each day to determine whether the solutionis still capable of peeling potatoes. If, at the end of oneday, he finds that it takes 64.0 ml of a 0.200 M solution ofH_2SO_4 to titrate a 10.0 ml sample ofNaOHsolution to neutrality, what concentration ofNaOHdid he find?

Options:

A: 2.56 M
B: 0.32 M
C: 0.16 M
D: 1.28 M
E: 5.12 M
F: 2.00 M
G: 4.00 M
H: 3.12 M
I: 1.92 M
J: 0.64 M

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating NaOH with H2SO4. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralization reactions. Let me think about what I know.

The problem says that a manufacturer uses NaOH solution for peeling potatoes. At the end of the day, they titrate the NaOH with standardized H2SO4 to check its concentration. The given data is that 64.0 mL of 0.200 M H2SO4 is used to titrate 10.0 mL of the NaOH solution. I need to find the concentration of NaOH.

Wait, right, the reaction between NaOH and H2SO4. I think the reaction is H2SO4 reacting with NaOH to form Na2SO4 and water. Let me write that out:

H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O

So, from the balanced equation, 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. That's important for the stoichiometry.

Now, I'll need to calculate the moles of H2SO4 used and then find out how many moles of NaOH reacted with it. 

First, moles of H2SO4. Molarity is moles per liter. So, the volume is 64.0 mL, which is 0.064 liters. Molarity is 0.200 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume.

Moles H2SO4 = 0.200 mol/L * 0.064 L = 0.0128 mol.

From the balanced equation, 1 mole H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles NaOH. So moles NaOH = 2 * moles H2SO4.

Moles NaOH = 2 * 0.0128 = 0.0256 mol.

Now, the volume of NaOH solution used is 10.0 mL, which is 0.010 L. To find the concentration (M) of NaOH, divide moles by volume in liters.

Molarity NaOH = 0.0256 mol / 0.010 L = 2.56 M.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. H2SO4: 0.2 * 0.064 = 0.0128. NaOH is twice that, so 0.0256. Divided by 0.01 gives 2.56. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.56 M. So the answer should be A.

To determine the concentration of the NaOH solution, we analyze the titration data provided. The reaction between NaOH and H₂SO₄ is:

\[
\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2 \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. 

1. **Calculate moles of H₂SO₄:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.200 \, \text{M} \times 0.0640 \, \text{L} = 0.0128 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Calculate moles of NaOH:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaOH} = 2 \times \text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = 2 \times 0.0128 = 0.0256 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate the concentration of NaOH:**
   \[
   \text{Molarity of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Volume of NaOH (L)}} = \frac{0.0256 \, \text{mol}}{0.0100 \, \text{L}} = 2.56 \, \text{M}
   \]

Thus, the concentration of the NaOH solution is **2.56 M**, which corresponds to option **A**.
