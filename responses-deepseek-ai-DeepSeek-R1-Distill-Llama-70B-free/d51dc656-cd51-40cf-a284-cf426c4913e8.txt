Okay, so I have this problem about finding the volume of a container needed to store ethane. Hmm, I've got to think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with gases, the ideal gas law is often used, but sometimes real gas behavior might come into play, especially at high pressures. Let's see what the given conditions are.

The problem states that we have 1500 lbm of ethane, C2H6. The temperature is 160°F, and the pressure is 1100 psig. I need to find the volume in cubic feet. The options are given from A to J, so I'll have to calculate it and pick the right one.

First, I should probably convert the temperature to absolute units because gas laws require that. Fahrenheit to Rankine. The formula is T(R) = T(°F) + 459.67. So 160 + 459.67 is about 619.67 °R.

Next, the pressure is given as 1100 psig. Psig is gage pressure, which means it's the pressure above atmospheric. So I need to add atmospheric pressure to get absolute pressure. Standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psia. So 1100 + 14.7 = 1114.7 psia. Wait, but wait, sometimes when using certain gas laws or equations, the pressure units need to be in absolute terms, like psia, which I think I've done here.

Now, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, ethane at high pressure might not behave ideally. So I might need the compressibility factor (Z) for ethane at these conditions. Alternatively, I could use the specific volume approach if I know the specific gravity or other properties.

Wait, the problem gives the mass in lbm. So I'll need to find the number of moles. Moles (n) are mass (m) divided by molar mass (M). The molar mass of ethane is (2*12.01) + (6*1.008) = 24.02 + 6.048 = 30.068 g/mol. Oh wait, but the mass is in lbm, so I need to convert that to pounds-mass first, or use the molar mass in lbm per lbmol.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The molar mass of ethane is about 30.07 g/mol. Since 1 lbm is 453.592 grams, so 30.07 g is 30.07 / 453.592 ≈ 0.0663 lbm per mol. So wait, no, I think I should express the molar mass in lbm per lbmol. So 30.07 g/mol is 30.07 / 453.592 lbm per lbmol. Let me calculate that: 30.07 / 453.592 ≈ 0.06628 lbm per lbmol.

So the number of moles n is mass (1500 lbm) divided by molar mass (0.06628 lbm per lbmol). So n = 1500 / 0.06628 ≈ let's see, 1500 / 0.06628 ≈ 22641.4 lbmol? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Moles are calculated as mass divided by molar mass. But when the mass is in lbm and molar mass is in lbm per lbmol, then n will be in lbmol. So let me do the calculation correctly.

Molar mass M = 30.07 g/mol = 30.07 / 453.59237 lbm per lbmol. Let me compute that. 30.07 divided by 453.592 is approximately 0.06628 lbm per lbmol.

So n = m / M = 1500 lbm / 0.06628 lbm/lbmol ≈ 1500 / 0.06628 ≈ 22641.4 lbmol. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but okay.

Now, using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

But wait, the gas constant R is 10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol·°R) when using these units. Let me confirm that. Yes, R is 10.7316 when P is in psia, V in ft³, n in lbmol, and T in °R.

So P is 1114.7 psia, T is 619.67 °R.

Wait, but in the ideal gas equation, P is absolute pressure, which I have as 1114.7 psia. So rearranging the equation to solve for V:

V = (nRT) / P.

So plug in the numbers:

n = 22641.4 lbmol,

R = 10.7316,

T = 619.67,

P = 1114.7.

So V = (22641.4 * 10.7316 * 619.67) / 1114.7.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, ethane at high pressure might not behave ideally. So using the ideal gas law might give a wrong answer. But since the problem doesn't specify using the compressibility factor, maybe I'm supposed to proceed with the ideal gas assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the real gas behavior by using Z, but without knowing Z at these conditions, I can't. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas law.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's compute the volume using ideal gas law first and see which option it's closest to.

So calculating V:

Compute numerator: n * R * T.

n = 22641.4,

R = 10.7316,

T ≈ 619.67.

So 22641.4 * 10.7316 = let's compute that.

22641.4 * 10 = 226414,

22641.4 * 0.7316 ≈ 22641.4 * 0.7 is about 15848.98, 22641.4 * 0.0316 ≈ 716. So total is approximately 226414 + 15849 + 716 ≈ 242,  (Wait, 226414 + 15848.98 is 242,262.98, then +716=243k maybe?)

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

22641.4 * 10.7316.

Let me compute it step by step.

22641.4 *10 = 226414.

22641.4 * 0.7 = 15,848.98.

22641.4 * 0.03 = 679.242.

22641.4 * 0.0016 = approximately 36.265.

So adding all together: 226414 + 15,848.98 = 242,262.98. Then +679.242 = 242,942.222. Then +36.265 = 242,978.487.

So n*R*T = 242,978.487 * T? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, nRT is (n*R)*T, so the previous calculation was n*R, which is 22641.4 * 10.7316 ≈ 242,978.487 lbmol·psia-ft³/(lbmol·°R) * °R? No, wait, the units: R has units psia·ft³/(lbmol·R), so n*R*T would be (lbmol) * (psia·ft³/(lbmol·R)) * R → psia·ft³. So correct.

So nRT is 242,978.487 lbmol*R*psia·ft³/(lbmol·R) → Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the units: when I multiply n (lbmol) by R (psia·ft³/(lbmol·R)), the lbmol units cancel out, and then multiplied by T (R), the R units cancel. So the result is psia·ft³.

Wait, but no, because V is in ft³. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

nRT = 22641.4 * 10.7316 * 619.67.

Wait, earlier I computed 22641.4 * 10.7316 as approximately 242,978.487.

Then multiply by T = 619.67:

242,978.487 * 619.67 ≈ Let's compute that.

Well, 242,978.487 * 600 = 145,787,092.

242,978.487 * 19.67 ≈ Let's compute 242,978.487 * 20 = 4,859,569.74, but subtract 242,978.487 * 0.33 ≈ 80,182.64.

So 4,859,569.74 - 80,182.64 ≈ 4,779,387.1.

So total nRT ≈ 145,787,092 + 4,779,387.1 = 150,566,479 psia·ft³.

Wait, wait, but that can't be right. Wait, 22641.4 * 10.7316 is about 242,978 lbmol*R units, and multiplied by 619.67 R gives 242,978 * 619.67 ≈ which is around 150 million? That seems way too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Maybe using a calculator approach here isn't feasible, so perhaps I should find a better way to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific volume approach. Specific volume is the volume per unit mass. Or find the molar volume and multiply by moles.

Wait, another approach: The specific gravity of ethane relative to air. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the ideal gas equation in terms of specific volume.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the molar volume at the given conditions.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the pressure is high enough that the ideal gas assumption is invalid. The pressure is 1100 psig, which is about 1114.7 psia. Ethane's critical pressure is about 709 psia, so at 1114 psia, the pressure is above the critical pressure. So the gas will not condense, but it's a real gas, so the ideal gas law won't hold well. But without the compressibility factor, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed with the ideal gas.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the compressibility factor, but I don't have data on that. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the van der Waals equation, but without knowing the constants, that might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the compressibility factor for ethane at these conditions. Alternatively, maybe use an approximation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the ideal gas and the answer is one of the options, but let me proceed.

So nRT = 22641.4 lbmol * 10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol·R) * 619.67 R.

Calculating that:

22641.4 * 10.7316 = Let's compute 22641 * 10 = 226410, 22641 * 0.7316 ≈ 22641 * 0.7 = 15,848.7, 22641 * 0.0316 ≈ 716. So 15,848.7 +716 ≈ 16,564.7. So total is 226410 + 16,564.7 ≈ 242,974.7.

Now multiply by T = 619.67 R: 242,974.7 * 619.67 ≈ Let me compute 242,974.7 * 600 = 145,784,820, and 242,974.7 * 19.67 ≈ ?

Compute 242,974.7 * 20 = 4,859,494, then subtract 242,974.7 * 0.33 ≈ 80,182. So 4,859,494 - 80,182 ≈ 4,779,312. So total nRT ≈ 145,784,820 + 4,779,312 ≈ 150,564,132 psia·ft³.

Then, V = nRT / P = 150,564,132 / 1114.7 ≈ Let's compute that.

1114.7 is approximately 1115. Let me compute 150,564,132 ÷ 1115.

So 1115 * 135,000 = 1115 * 100,000 = 115,500,000

1115 * 35,000 = 1115 * 30,000 = 33,450,000; 1115*5,000=5,575,000 → total 33,450k +5,575k=38,  I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 150,564,132 ÷ 1114.7.

Let me compute 1114.7 × 135,000 = ?

1114.7 * 100,000 = 111,470,000.

1114.7 * 35,000 = 1114.7 * 30,000 = 33,441,000 and 1114.7 *5,000=5,573,500 → total 33,441k +5,573.5k=38,  I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach here isn't working. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should use the specific form of the ideal gas law, using the specific volume. Specific volume (v) is the volume per unit mass. So v = V/m, where m is mass.

The ideal gas law can be written as Pv = mRT, where R is the specific gas constant. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of v = RT/P, where R is the specific gas constant based on mass units.

Wait, perhaps using the gas constant per unit mass. Let me think. The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol·R). But since I have the mass in lbm, I can find the specific gas constant for ethane.

The molar mass M of ethane is 30.07 g/mol, which is 0.06628 lbm per lbmol, as calculated earlier.

So the specific gas constant R_specific is R / M. So R_specific = 10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol·R) / 0.06628 lbm/lbmol → units would be psia-ft³/(lbm·R).

So R_specific = 10.7316 / 0.06628 ≈ let's compute that.

10.7316 ÷ 0.06628.

Let me compute 0.06628 * 160 = 10.6048 → which is close to 10.7316. So 0.06628 * 162 ≈ 10.7316 (since 0.06628*2=0.13256; 10.6048 + 0.13256 = 10.73736, which is a bit higher than 10.7316. So maybe 162 - (10.73736-10.7316)/(0.13256 per 1 unit) → but perhaps it's approximately 162.

Wait, 0.06628 * 162 = 10.73736. So 10.7316 is a bit less than that. So perhaps 162 - (10.73736 -10.7316)/0.06628 → but maybe it's easier to just compute 10.7316 / 0.06628.

Using a calculator approach:

0.06628 × 162 = 10.73736 → which is higher than 10.7316 by 0.00576.

So 162 - (0.00576 / 0.06628) → 0.00576 / 0.06628 ≈ 0.0869. So 162 - 0.0869 ≈ 161.9131.

So R_specific ≈ 161.9131 psia-ft³/(lbm·R).

Now, the specific volume v is given by v = (R_specific * T) / P.

So v = (161.9131 * 619.67) / 1114.7.

Compute numerator: 161.9131 * 619.67.

Let me compute 160 * 620 = 99,200.

But more accurately:

161.9131 * 600 = 97,147.86.

161.9131 * 19.67 ≈ 161.9131 * 20 = 3,238.262 → subtract 161.9131 * 0.33 ≈ 53.431. So 3,238.262 -53.431 ≈ 3,184.831.

Total numerator: 97,147.86 + 3,184.831 ≈ 100,332.691.

So v = 100,332.691 / 1114.7 ≈ let's compute that.

1114.7 × 90 = 100,323.

So 90 → 100,323. So 100,332.691 is about 90.0009. So v ≈ 90.0009 ft³/lbm.

Wait, that can't be right because 90 ft³/lbm would make the total volume 1500 lbm * 90 ft³/lbm = 135,000 ft³, which is way larger than any of the options given. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me double-check the specific gas constant calculation.

Wait, R_specific is R (10.7316 psia-ft³/(lbmol·R)) divided by M (0.06628 lbm/lbmol), so units would be (psia-ft³/(lbmol·R)) / (lbm/lbmol) → which is psia-ft³/(lbm·R). So correct.

Then, v = (R_specific * T) / P.

T is in Rankine (619.67), P in psia (1114.7).

So v = (161.9131 * 619.67) / 1114.7 → which I computed as approximately 90 ft³/lbm.

Then, total volume V = m * v = 1500 lbm * 90 ft³/lbm = 135,000 ft³. But that's not any of the options. The options are all around 100-180 ft³. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps because I used the ideal gas law, which isn't valid here. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the specific volume.

Wait, another approach: Let's use the compressibility factor. But without knowing Z, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps using the specific gravity method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general gas equation with Z included.

The equation would be PV = ZnRT
