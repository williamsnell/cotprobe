Options:

A: 2.00(25.00) = 50.00
B: 25.00 ÷ 4.00 = 6.25

D: 2.00(4.00) = 8.00
E: 27.70 – 25.00 = 2.70
F: 27.70 – 22.30 = 5.40
G: 27.70 + 22.30 = 50.00
H: 27.70 ÷ 22.30 = 1.24
I: 4.00^2 = 16.00

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about the interquartile range for a normally distributed random variable. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that variable X is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4. I need to find the approximate interquartile range (IQR) from the given options.

Wait, what's the IQR again? Oh right, the IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). So IQR = Q3 - Q1. For a normal distribution, I remember that the data is symmetric around the mean, which is 25 here.

I think in a normal distribution, the quartiles are spaced in a specific way from the mean. Oh yeah! The first quartile is at the 25th percentile, and the third at the 75th. Since the distribution is symmetric, the distance from the mean to each quartile should be the same, but on opposite sides.

Wait, how do I calculate the exact values of Q1 and Q3? I recall that for percentiles in a normal distribution, we use the z-score formula. The z-score for the pth percentile is given by z = (X - μ)/σ, where μ is the mean and σ the standard deviation.

But for quartiles, the percentiles are 25% and 75%. So the z-scores for these are known, right? I think the z-score for the 25th percentile is about -0.67 and for the 75th it's +0.67. Because those are the values where each side is about 25% of the data. Wait, is that correct? Or was it -1.96 and 1.96 for 95% confidence intervals? No, wait, that's different. The 25th and 75th percentiles are within one standard deviation, so z-scores around 0.67 maybe.

Let me think. The empirical rule says that 68% of data is within μ ± σ, 95% within μ ± 2σ, and 99.7% within μ ±3σ. But that's for the mean and standard deviation. How does that relate to quartiles?

Wait, the quartiles divide the data into four equal parts. So the 25th percentile is the point below which 25% of the data falls. For a normal distribution, the z-scores at these points are known. I think the 25th percentile has a z-score of approximately -0.6745, and the 75th is +0.6745. These are the quantiles for the standard normal distribution.

So, using that, I can calculate Q1 and Q3. The formula would be X = μ + z * σ. So for Q1, it's 25 + (-0.6745)*4. And for Q3, it's 25 + 0.6745*4.

Let me compute these. 

First, Q1: 25 + (-0.6745 *4) = 25 - 2.698 ≈ 22.302.

Q3: 25 + (0.6745 *4) = 25 + 2.698 ≈ 27.698.

So the IQR is Q3 - Q1 = 27.698 -22.302 = 5.396. So approximately 5.4.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one gives 5.4. Let's look through the options:

Option F: 27.70 – 22.30 = 5.40. That matches exactly what I got. 

Wait, but let me check the other options in case I made a mistake. Option A is 2*(25) =50, which is way too big. B is 25/4 =6.25, which is around 6.25. Hmm, but I got 5.4, so not this. Option C is 25+22.3=47.3, which seems irrelevant. D is 2*4=8, that's the range from mean-2σ to mean+2σ, but that's for 95%, not IQR. E is 27.70–25=2.7, which is the distance from mean to Q3, but IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1. So E is half the IQR. F is exactly 5.4. G is 27.7 + 22.3=50, which is the sum, irrelevant. H is their division, which is like 1.24, not relevant. I is 4^2=16, the variance maybe, but not IQR. J is 25-22.3=2.7, same as E but the other half.

So yes, the correct answer should be option F.

To determine the interquartile range (IQR) for a normally distributed random variable \( X \) with a mean (\( \mu \)) of 25 and a standard deviation (\( \sigma \)) of 4, we need to calculate the difference between the third quartile (\( Q_3 \)) and the first quartile (\( Q_1 \)). 

For a normal distribution, the 25th percentile (\( Q_1 \)) and the 75th percentile (\( Q_3 \)) correspond to z-scores of approximately \(-0.6745\) and \(+0.6745\), respectively. Using the formula \( X = \mu + z \cdot \sigma \), we calculate:

- \( Q_1 = 25 + (-0.6745)(4) = 25 - 2.698 = 22.302 \)
- \( Q_3 = 25 + (0.6745)(4) = 25 + 2.698 = 27.698 \)

The IQR is then:

\[
\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 = 27.698 - 22.302 = 5.396 \approx 5.40
\]

Among the given options, the one that matches this value is:

**F: \( 27.70 – 22.30 = 5.40 \)**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F**

The final answer is:

F
