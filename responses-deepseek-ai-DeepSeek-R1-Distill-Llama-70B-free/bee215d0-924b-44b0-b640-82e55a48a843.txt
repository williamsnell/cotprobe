Okay, so I've got this question about the Job Characteristics Model, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this model.

The Job Characteristics Model, also known as the Hackman and Oldham model, is all about job design. It focuses on making jobs more engaging and motivating for employees. From what I remember, the model identifies five core job characteristics that influence job satisfaction, motivation, and performance.

The five main characteristics are: 
1. **Skill Variety** – This refers to how many different skills an employee uses on the job. Jobs that require a range of skills are more engaging.
2. **Task Identity** – This is about whether an employee completes a whole piece of work from start to finish. Seeing a project through gives a sense of accomplishment.
3. **Task Significance** – How much impact does the job have on others? If the work affects people, it's more meaningful.
4. **Autonomy** – The freedom an employee has to make decisions and choices about their work.
5. **Feedback** – Getting information about how well one is doing, which can come from the job itself or from others.

Now, the question is asking which of the options is **not** a characteristic of this model. Let's look at the options:

A: Skill variety – That's one of the five, so it's a characteristic.

B: Job rotation – Hmm, I think job rotation is a method used in job enlargement or enrichment. It's about moving employees between different jobs to add variety, but I don't think it's one of the core characteristics in the model.

C: Task significance – Yes, that's another of the five.

D: Feedback – Also part of the five.

E: Reward – Wait, the model does talk about outcomes like satisfaction, but is reward one of the characteristics? Or is it an outcome influenced by the characteristics?

F: Task identity – Core characteristic.

G: Autonomy – Yes, included.

H: Job enrichment – I believe job enrichment is a strategy to improve job design by adding more motivating factors, but it's not a characteristic itself.

I: Job enlargement – This is about increasing the number of tasks, sometimes just adding more work without necessarily adding more challenge. It's a technique, not a characteristic.

So, the question is asking which is **not** a characteristic. The options B, H, and I are techniques or methods rather than core characteristics.

Looking at the options, the question lists them as A to I, and the options are about which is not a characteristic.

So, the model's core characteristics are A, C, D, F, G, and maybe E? Or is E part of the outcomes?

Wait, the original model includes five characteristics: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. So E: Reward isn't one of the five. But wait, I might be confusing this. Let me think again.

Rewards are more of an outcome or a separate factor. The model's characteristics don't include reward as one of the five. Therefore, looking at the options, E: Reward is not a characteristic.

But wait, the options include B: Job rotation, which I thought wasn't a characteristic. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the Job Characteristics Model includes the five I listed. So, looking at the options, E: Reward is not one of them. But wait, sometimes the model talks about knowledge of results as feedback, which is D. So E: Reward is not a characteristic.

But then, looking again, the options are A-I, and the question is which is not a characteristic. So, the correct answer is either E or B or H or I.

Wait, the model's five characteristics are A (Skill variety), C (Task significance), D (Feedback), F (Task identity), G (Autonomy). So the options not in this list are B, E, H, I.

The question is which is not a characteristic. So among the options, B is job rotation, which is a technique, not a characteristic. H is job enrichment, also a technique. I is job enlargement, another technique. E is reward, which is an outcome.

So the question is, which of the options is not a characteristic. So the options not part of the five are B, E, H, I.

The question is giving options A-I, and the five are A, C, D, F, G. So the one that's not a characteristic is B, E, H, or I.

The question is asking for which one is not a characteristic. So looking at the options, perhaps the answer is B: Job rotation.

Wait, but I thought job rotation is a method used to increase skill variety or task identity, not a characteristic itself. So it's not part of the model's characteristics.

Wait, the model's characteristics are the five: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback. So of the options, B is job rotation, which is not a characteristic. So the answer would be B: Job rotation.

Alternatively, E: Reward is also not a characteristic. Because reward is something that may come from the job, but it's not one of the five. So I'm getting a bit stuck between B and E.

Wait, the model's five are the ones I listed, so E isn't one of them. So the answer could be E.

Wait, let me clarify. The Job Characteristics Model includes the five core characteristics: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. So the other options are either techniques (like job rotation, job enlargement, job enrichment) or outcomes (like reward, job satisfaction).

So the question is, which one of the options is not a characteristic. So looking at the options, B is job rotation, which is a method, not a characteristic. Similarly, H is job enrichment, which is a method. I is job enlargement, another method. E is reward, which is an outcome.

So the answer should be either B, E, H, or I.

The question asks which is NOT a characteristic. So the correct answer is B: Job rotation, because it's a job design technique, not a characteristic.

Wait, but another possibility is that the answer is E: Reward. Because the model's characteristics don't include reward as one of the five.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question includes E as reward. So is reward a characteristic? I don't think so. The five are the ones I listed earlier. So E is not a characteristic.

So now I'm torn between B and E.

Hmm, I think I need to remember what each option refers to.

Let me think again. The five core characteristics are:

1. Skill Variety (A)
2. Task Identity (F)
3. Task Significance (C)
4. Autonomy (G)
5. Feedback (D)

So the options that are not characteristics are B, E, H, I.

The question is which one is NOT a characteristic, so the answer is one of these.

Now, looking at the options, the question is which is not a characteristic. The options are A-I, and the possible answers are B, E, H, I.

The question is multiple-choice, so the correct answer is one of these.

Wait, the other options: H is Job enrichment, which is a method, not a characteristic.

I think the answer is B: Job rotation, because it's a technique, not a characteristic.

But I'm a bit confused because I also thought that E: Reward isn't a characteristic. So perhaps I should consider that.

Wait, the model's outcomes include things like internal work motivation, satisfaction, etc. So Reward (E) might be an outcome, but it's not a characteristic.

So the options are:

A: Yes
B: No
C: Yes
D: Yes
E: No
F: Yes
G: Yes
H: No
I: No

So the question is, which is not a characteristic. So the correct answer could be B, E, H, or I.

The question is which one is not a characteristic. The options given are A to I, and the correct answer is the one that doesn't belong.

Wait, the question is "What one of the following is not a characteristic of the job characteristics model?"

So, looking at the options again, the correct answer is either B, E, H, or I.

I think the intended answer here is B: Job rotation, because job rotation is a technique used in job enlargement or enrichment, but not a core characteristic.

Alternatively, I remember that Job rotation is a method, not a characteristic. So B is the correct answer.

Wait, but another approach: the Job Characteristics Model includes five characteristics (A, C, D, F, G). The other options are either techniques (B, H, I) or outcomes (E). So the question is looking for which is not a characteristic, so any of B, E, H, I are correct.

But the question asks for one of them. So perhaps the answer is E: Reward, because it's not one of the five.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The five core characteristics are:

- Skill Variety (A)
- Task Identity (F)
- Task Significance (C)
- Autonomy (G)
- Feedback (D)

So the options that are not in this list are B, E, H, I.

The question is which one is not a characteristic. So the correct answer is one of these.

Now, the options are:

A: Skill variety – yes

B: Job rotation – no

C: Task significance – yes

D: Feedback – yes

E: Reward – no

F: Task identity – yes

G: Autonomy – yes

H: Job enrichment – no

I: Job enlargement – no

So the question is which is not a characteristic. The answer could be any of B, E, H, or I.

But the question gives ten options, but in the provided options, the options are A to I. Wait, the options given are A to I as listed: A is Skill variety, B is Job rotation, C is Task significance, D is Feedback, E is Reward, F is Task identity, G is Autonomy, H is Job enrichment, I is Job enlargement.

So the question is, which one is not a characteristic. So the correct answer is B, E, H, or I.

Wait, but the original model doesn't include any of these as characteristics except the five.

So the answer is either B, E, H, or I.

In the context of the question, the answer is likely B: Job rotation, because it's a method, not a characteristic.

Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Let me think about each option.

- Job rotation: A technique where employees are moved between different jobs to increase variety. Not a characteristic.

- Job enlargement: Adding more tasks to a job, perhaps increasing workload without necessarily increasing challenge. Not a characteristic.

- Job enrichment: Adding more challenging tasks to make the job more engaging. Also a technique, not a characteristic.

So the answer is either B, H, I, or E.

The question is about which is NOT a characteristic. So the correct answer is B: Job rotation.

Wait, but another thought: The model includes the five characteristics, and the other options are techniques or outcomes. So the one that's NOT a characteristic is B: Job rotation.

Therefore, the answer is B.

The Job Characteristics Model, developed by Hackman and Oldham, identifies five core job characteristics that influence job satisfaction, motivation, and performance. These characteristics are:

1. **Skill Variety**: The extent to which a job requires a range of different skills.
2. **Task Identity**: The degree to which an employee completes a whole piece of work from start to finish.
3. **Task Significance**: The impact of the job on others, whether inside or outside the organization.
4. **Autonomy**: The freedom an employee has to make decisions and choices about their work.
5. **Feedback**: The extent to which an employee receives information about their performance.

The question asks which of the given options is **not** a characteristic of the Job Characteristics Model. Analyzing the options:

- **A: Skill Variety** – This is one of the five core characteristics.
- **B: Job Rotation** – This is a technique used to increase job variety, not a core characteristic of the model.
- **C: Task Significance** – This is one of the five core characteristics.
- **D: Feedback** – This is one of the five core characteristics.
- **E: Reward** – While rewards may be an outcome influenced by the job characteristics, they are not one of the five core characteristics.
- **F: Task Identity** – This is one of the five core characteristics.
- **G: Autonomy** – This is one of the five core characteristics.
- **H: Job Enrichment** – This is a strategy to improve job design, not a core characteristic.
- **I: Job Enlargement** – This is a technique to expand job scope, not a core characteristic.

From this analysis, the options that are not characteristics of the Job Characteristics Model are **B, E, H, and I**. However, the question asks for one specific answer. Among these, **B: Job Rotation** is the most clear-cut choice, as it is explicitly a technique rather than a characteristic.
