Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the resultant force on a body with a given mass and acceleration. The mass is 48 kg, and the acceleration is 6 m/s². Hmm, I remember from my classes that force is related to mass and acceleration. Oh right, Newton's second law! The formula is F = m * a, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.

So I need to calculate the force by multiplying the mass by the acceleration. Let's plug in the numbers. The mass is 48 kg, and acceleration is 6 m/s². So 48 multiplied by 6... Let me do the math in my head. 40 times 6 is 240, and 8 times 6 is 48, so adding those together gives 288. So the force should be 288 newtons. 

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: 252 N
B: 264 N
C: 306 N
D: 288 N
E: 300 N
F: 324 N
G: 280 N
H: 312 N
I: 276 N
J: 294 N

The correct answer should be D: 288 newtons. That's the one that matches my calculation. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Force equals mass times acceleration, straightforward. No need to consider friction or other forces since the question is about the resultant force, which is the net force acting on the body. So yeah, D is the right choice.

The resultant force on a body can be calculated using Newton's second law, which states that force equals mass multiplied by acceleration (\(F = m \cdot a\)). Given the mass (\(m = 48 \, \text{kg}\)) and acceleration (\(a = 6 \, \text{m/s}^2\)), the force is:

\[
F = 48 \cdot 6 = 288 \, \text{N}.
\]

From the provided options, the correct answer is:

**D: 288 newtons.**
