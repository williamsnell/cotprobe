Okay, so I have this question about bonds and interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says Mr. Burke bought three bonds, each with a par value of $1,000. The bonds have an interest rate of 5 1/4 percent, and the interest is paid semiannually. I need to find out how much interest he'll receive.

Hmm, I remember that bond interest is usually calculated based on the par value and the coupon rate. Since it's paid semiannually, that means he gets interest twice a year. So the annual interest would be split into two payments.

Wait, the interest rate is 5 1/4 percent. Oh right, 5 and 1/4 percent is the same as 5.25%. So the annual interest for one bond should be 5.25% of $1000. Let me calculate that first.

5.25% of 1000 is... well, 5% is 50, and 0.25% is 2.5. So 50 + 2.5 = 52.5 dollars a year per bond. But since it's paid semiannually, he gets half of that each time. So each payment would be 52.5 divided by 2, which is 26.25 dollars per payment.

But wait, how many times a year does he get this? Twice. So for each bond, per year, it's 52.5 dollars. Since he has three bonds, that's 3 times 52.5. Let me compute that: 52.5 * 3 is 157.5 dollars per year.

Wait, but the question is asking how much interest he will receive. Does it specify a time period? Let me check the question again. It just asks how much interest, so I think it's asking annually. So the total interest per year would be $157.50.

Looking at the options, option H is $157.50. So that's probably the correct answer.

I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. Each bond pays 5.25% annually, split into two payments. Per bond, that's 52.50 per year. Three bonds make 157.50. Yep, that makes sense.

To determine how much interest Mr. Burke will receive, we start by calculating the annual interest for one bond. The bond has a par value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 5 1/4%, which is equivalent to 5.25%. The annual interest per bond is:

\[
5.25\% \times \$1,000 = \$52.50
\]

Since the interest is paid semiannually, each payment is half of the annual interest:

\[
\frac{\$52.50}{2} = \$26.25 \text{ per semiannual payment}
\]

However, the question asks for the total interest Mr. Burke will receive annually, not the amount per payment. Therefore, the annual interest per bond is \$52.50. For three bonds, the total annual interest is:

\[
3 \times \$52.50 = \$157.50
\]

Thus, the total interest Mr. Burke will receive annually is \$157.50, which corresponds to option H.
