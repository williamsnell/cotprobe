Question:

Which of the following statements is true of production possibility curves and trade between nations?

Options:

A: Domestic industries should be protected to ensure nations stay within their production possibility curve.
B: The flow of goods and services is based on the principle of absolute advantage.
C: Nations can consume at points beyond the production possibility curve by protecting domestic industries from free trade.
D: Trade between nations does not affect the production possibility curve.
E: Nations should only trade when they have a comparative advantage in production.
F: Free trade restricts nations to consume within their production possibility curve.
G: The principle of comparative advantage is irrelevant in the context of international trade.
H: Nations specialize and trade based on absolute advantage in production.
I: Production possibility curves demonstrate that trade always results in absolute disadvantage.
J: Free trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about production possibility curves and international trade. Hmm, I remember that production possibility curves (PPCs) show the maximum output combinations of two goods an economy can produce. They're usually used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, and the gains from trade.

The question is asking which statement is true regarding PPCs and trade between nations. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: Domestic industries should be protected to ensure nations stay within their production possibility curve. Wait, why would protectionism keep them within the PPC? Actually, protectionism might limit trade, which could prevent a nation from moving beyond its PPC. But I thought that without trade, a country can't go beyond its PPC. So maybe protecting industries isn't the way to go. Not sure yet.

Option B: The flow of goods and services is based on absolute advantage. Absolute advantage is when a country can produce a good more efficiently than another. But I remember that comparative advantage, not absolute, is the basis for trade. So this might be incorrect.

Option C: Nations can consume beyond their PPC by protecting domestic industries. No, that doesn't sound right. Protecting industries usually leads to less efficiency and might prevent trade. Trade allows consumption beyond PPC, not protection. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Trade doesn't affect the PPC. Wait, the PPC is about production possibilities. Trade affects what a country consumes, not necessarily its production. So the PPC itself isn't changed by trade; trade just allows for a different consumption point. So D might be correct, but I'm not certain yet.

Option E: Nations should only trade when they have a comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the main reason countries trade. If a country has a comparative advantage, it should specialize and trade. So E sounds correct, but I thought the question is about which statement is true, so maybe E is a contender.

Option F: Free trade restricts consumption within the PPC. No, that's the opposite. Without trade, you're limited to your PPC. With free trade, you can consume beyond it by exchanging goods. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Comparative advantage is irrelevant. Definitely not. Comparative advantage is a key concept in international trade theory, so G is wrong.

Option H: Nations specialize based on absolute advantage. Hmm, I think it's comparative, not absolute. Absolute advantage would mean each country produces what they're best at, but the theory of comparative advantage says they should specialize where they have lower opportunity cost. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: Trade results in absolute disadvantage. That doesnâ€™t make sense. Trade is supposed to benefit both countries by allowing them to consume more than they could produce alone. So I is wrong.

Option J: Free trade allows consumption beyond the PPC. Yes, that rings a bell. Without trade, a country can only consume what it produces, which is within the PPC. Trade lets them import goods, so they can consume beyond their own production possibilities. So J seems correct.

Wait, back to E and J. The question is about which statement is true. So E says nations should trade only when they have a comparative advantage. But in reality, even without a comparative advantage in anything (which is impossible if every country has at least one), countries can still benefit from trade based on comparative advantage. So E's statement might be too restrictive. Because even if a country is worse at everything (absolute disadvantage), it can still benefit by specializing in the area where it's relatively better (comparative advantage). So E's statement isn't necessarily true because nations should trade based on comparative advantage, not only when they have it, because every nation has some comparative advantage.

So J is correct because free trade allows consumption beyond PPC.

The correct answer is:

J: Free trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve.

**Explanation:**

Production possibility curves (PPCs) represent the maximum output combinations of goods an economy can produce. International trade allows countries to specialize in producing goods where they have a comparative advantage and import other goods. This specialization and trade enable countries to consume beyond their PPC by accessing goods they do not produce or producing more efficiently. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, F, G, H, I**: These are incorrect because they either misrepresent the role of trade, protectionism, or the principles of absolute and comparative advantage.
- **B**: Incorrect because trade is based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.
- **D**: Incorrect because trade affects consumption possibilities, not the PPC itself.
- **E**: Incorrect because nations should trade based on comparative advantage, and it is not necessary to have an absolute advantage.
- **J**: Correct because free trade allows nations to consume beyond their PPC by specializing and trading.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.
