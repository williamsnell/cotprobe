Okay, I need to figure out the primary research method used by developmental psychologists. Let me think about what each of these options entails and how they relate to developmental psychology.

First, the question is asking for the primary method, so the most commonly used one in the field. Developmental psychology studies human development across the lifespan, so the methods would likely involve observing changes over time.

Let me go through each option:

A: Psychoanalysis. That's more of a therapeutic approach, developed by Freud. It's not really a research method but a clinical technique. So probably not the primary method for research.

B: Self-report inventories. These are questionnaires where people report their own feelings or behaviors. They can be used, but I'm not sure if it's the primary method in developmental research.

C: Longitudinal research. This involves studying the same group of people over a long period, which makes sense for seeing developmental changes. Like tracking children into adulthood to see patterns.

D: Naturalistic observation. Observing behavior in natural settings. This is used, but again, I'm not sure if it's the main approach for developmental psychologists.

E: Experimental method. This involves manipulating variables and controlling for others. While experiments are used, longitudinal studies might be more central to developmental research which looks at age-related changes over time.

F: Experimentation. Similar to E, so same reasoning applies here.

G: Correlational research. This looks for relationships between variables but doesn't establish causation. It's useful, but not the primary approach when tracking development over time.

H: Survey research. Similar to self-reports, it's about collecting data through structured questions. Not the main method for developmental studies.

I: Cross-sectional research. This involves studying different age groups at the same time to compare them. It's faster than longitudinal but doesn't track the same individuals. So it's a common method, but is it the primary one?

J: Case study. In-depth study of a single individual. Useful for detailed insights but not the main approach for understanding broad developmental trends.

Now, considering that developmental psychology often examines changes over time, longitudinal research (C) makes sense because it allows researchers to see how individuals develop and change as they age. They can track the same people over years, which is crucial for understanding developmental stages and processes.

Cross-sectional (I) is also used but doesn't follow the same people, and longitudinal is more about long-term tracking. So the primary method would be longitudinal research.

Wait, but sometimes cross-sectional is used more because longitudinal is time-consuming and expensive. But the question is about the primary method, which is more about the approach that's central to the field. Longitudinal allows seeing true development in the same individuals, so it's more aligned with the goals of developmental psychology.

So I think the answer is C: longitudinal research.

The primary research method used by developmental psychologists is longitudinal research, as it involves studying the same group of individuals over an extended period to observe developmental changes and patterns across the lifespan.

Answer: C
