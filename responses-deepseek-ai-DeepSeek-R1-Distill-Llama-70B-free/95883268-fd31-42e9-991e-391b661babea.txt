Question:

Lizette and her family watch the sunset over the ocean. While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?

Options:

A: Lizette's eyes are adjusting to the darkness, hence she cannot distinguish the colors of objects.
B: Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.
C: The retina does not respond to changes in light intensity, therefore colors are not visible in dim light.
D: The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.
E: Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.
F: Rods and cones both require a high amount of light to be activated, hence color vision is not possible in dim light.
G: The cones, which are responsible for color vision, are deactivated in dim light.
H: The color vision is not possible in the dark because the photoreceptor cells in the retina require light to detect colors.
I: The colors are not visible in dim light because the rods, which detect colors, are deactivated.
J: Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about why Lizette can't see colors in the dark. Hmm, I remember that the human eye has two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Let me think about what each does.

I think cones are responsible for color vision. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light—like red, green, and blue. When light hits them, they help us see colors. On the other hand, rods are more numerous and are better at detecting low light levels. They help us see in black and white, especially in dim conditions.

So when it's dark, like when Lizette is walking home, her eyes probably switch to using rods more because they're better in low light. But since rods don't detect color, everything looks grayish. Cones need more light to function, so in the dark, they're not activated as much. That's why she can't distinguish colors—because the cones aren't working well, and rods are taking over but they don't do color.

Looking at the options:

Option B says cones require more light, and rods handle dim light. That sounds right. Option E seems to mix up rods and cones, saying cones handle black and white, which I don't think is correct. Option G says cones are deactivated, but I think they're just not active because the light is low, so they're not being used.

Option J also has rods and cones swapped in terms of color, so that's probably wrong. So the correct answer should be B.

The human eye has two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Cones are specialized for color vision and require more light to function, while rods are more sensitive to low light levels and produce images in black, white, and gray. In dim light, rods become the primary photoreceptors because they can function with less light, but they do not detect color. This explains why Lizette cannot distinguish colors in the dark. 

The correct answer is:

B: Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.

Answer: B
