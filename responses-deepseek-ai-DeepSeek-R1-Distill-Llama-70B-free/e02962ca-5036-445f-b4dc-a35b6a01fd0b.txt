Okay, so I've got this problem here about two flasks filled with nitrogen gas. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question says both flasks are of equal volume and are immersed in boiling water. When that happens, the pressure inside is 0.5 atm. Then, one flask is moved to an ice-water mixture, while the other stays in boiling water. I need to find the new pressure of the system.

Wait, I remember something about gas laws. Oh right, when the temperature changes, the pressure changes if the volume is constant, according to Gay-Lussac's law. But wait, since there are two flasks connected, maybe the volume isn't constant for each gas. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe the flasks are connected in a way that allows the gas to move between them, so the total volume is the sum of both.

Wait, the setup says "both are immersed in boiling water". So initially, each flask is filled with gas at the same temperature and pressure. Since they're equal in volume and same conditions, the pressure is 0.5 atm for the system. But I'm a bit confused about the setup. Are the two flasks connected, or are they separate but part of the same system?

Assuming they're connected, so the total volume is twice that of one flask. Then, when one is cooled and the other remains hot, the pressure will change based on the temperatures.

So, initially, both flasks are at the same temperature, T1, which is the boiling point of water, 100°C or 373 K. The pressure is 0.5 atm. So initially, for the combined system, the total moles would be n = (P1 * V_total) / (R T1), but since each is equal volume, V_total is 2V.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of partial pressures. Because when the temperatures change, each flask's contribution to the pressure will change.

Wait, but since the flasks are connected, the pressure in both will be the same. Because gases will move to equalize pressure. Oh wait no, no, wait. If the flasks are connected but each is at a different temperature, the pressure might not be the same in each. Oh, wait, maybe the system is such that each flask is sealed but connected in a way that allows pressure changes. No, perhaps the setup is that the flasks are connected, allowing the gas to move between them, but each is in a different temperature bath.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again. The problem states that both are immersed in boiling water, so same T. Then one is moved to ice-water (which is 0°C, 273 K) and the other stays in boiling. So each part (each flask) is at a different T, but the system's volume is the sum of the two, so V_total = 2V.

Wait, but if the flasks are connected, the gas can redistribute. But in this case, each flask is kept at a different temperature. Oh, wait, no, perhaps each flask is a separate part but part of the same closed system, so the total volume is the sum. But each portion is at a different temperature.

Hmm, perhaps each flask acts as a separate container but connected, so the pressure throughout is the same. But the temperatures are different. Oh wait, but that would complicate things because the ideal gas law applies to each part.

Wait, maybe I should model each flask as having its own pressure, but since they're connected, the pressure equalizes. But no, because each is in a different temperature. Wait, no. If they're connected, the pressure must be the same in both. But each part is at a different temperature. So the ideal gas law for each part would be P V = n R T for each, but since the volumes are same, n1 and n2 would vary with T.

Wait, but the total moles n_total = n1 + n2. Let me try to write the equations.

Let me denote:

Initially, both flasks are at T1 (373 K), pressure P1 = 0.5 atm, each of volume V.

So initial state:

n_total = (P1 * 2V) / (R T1) → because total volume is 2V.

After the change:

Flask A is at T2 = 273 K (ice water), Flask B remains at T1.

Each has volume V. Since the system is connected, the pressure P2 is same in both.

So for Flask A: P2 * V = n_A * R T2 → n_A = P2 V / (R T2)
Flask B: P2 * V = n_B * R T1 → n_B = P2 V / (R T1)

Total moles now: n_A + n_B = (P2 V)/(R T2) + (P2 V)/(R T1) ) → n_total = P2 V / R ( 1/T2 + 1/T1 )

But n_total remains the same because the system is closed, so initial n_total = final n_total.

So,

P1 * 2V/(R T1) = P2 V/(R) (1/T2 + 1/T1 )

Simplify. The R and V terms can be canceled out.

(2 P1) / T1 = P2 (1/T2 + 1/T1 )

So solving for P2:

P2 = (2 P1 / T1) / (1/T2 + 1/T1 )

Let me plug in the numbers:

P1 = 0.5 atm
T1 =373 K
T2=273 K

So,

P2 = (2*0.5 / 373) / (1/273 + 1/373 )

Calculate numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1) / 373 ≈ 0.00268122

Denominator: (1/273 + 1/373 ) = (0.003663 + 0.002681 ) ≈ 0.006344

So,

P2 ≈ (0.00268122) / 0.006344 ≈ 0.4226 atm

Looking at the options, option B is 0.423 atm. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the system using the ideal gas law and the fact that the total number of moles of gas remains constant since the system is closed. Initially, both flasks are at the same temperature \( T_1 = 373 \, \text{K} \) (boiling water) and pressure \( P_1 = 0.5 \, \text{atm} \), with equal volumes \( V \). The total volume of the system is \( 2V \).

The initial total number of moles in the system is given by:

\[
n_{\text{total}} = \frac{P_1 \cdot 2V}{R \cdot T_1}
\]

After one flask is cooled to \( T_2 = 273 \, \text{K} \) (ice-water mixture), the system reaches a new equilibrium pressure \( P_2 \). Since the flasks are connected, the pressure is the same in both, but the temperatures differ. Using the ideal gas law for each flask:

- For the flask at \( T_2 \): \( P_2 \cdot V = n_A \cdot R \cdot T_2 \)
- For the flask at \( T_1 \): \( P_2 \cdot V = n_B \cdot R \cdot T_1 \)

The total number of moles is:

\[
n_{\text{total}} = n_A + n_B = \frac{P_2 \cdot V}{R \cdot T_2} + \frac{P_2 \cdot V}{R \cdot T_1}
\]

Equating the initial and final total moles:

\[
\frac{P_1 \cdot 2V}{R \cdot T_1} = \frac{P_2 \cdot V}{R} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} + \frac{1}{T_1} \right)
\]

Simplifying by canceling \( R \) and \( V \):

\[
\frac{2P_1}{T_1} = P_2 \left( \frac{1}{T_2} + \frac{1}{T_1} \right)
\]

Solving for \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = \frac{\frac{2P_1}{T_1}}{\frac{1}{T_2} + \frac{1}{T_1}}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = 0.5 \, \text{atm} \), \( T_1 = 373 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_2 = 273 \, \text{K} \):

\[
P_2 = \frac{\frac{2 \cdot 0.5}{373}}{\frac{1}{273} + \frac{1}{373}}
\]

Calculating the numerator and denominator:

- Numerator: \( \frac{2 \cdot 0.5}{373} = \frac{1}{373} \approx 0.002681 \)
- Denominator: \( \frac{1}{273} + \frac{1}{373} \approx 0.003663 + 0.002681 = 0.006344 \)

\[
P_2 = \frac{0.002681}{0.006344} \approx 0.4226 \, \text{atm}
\]

Thus, the new pressure is approximately \( 0.423 \, \text{atm} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
