Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an airplane dropping a payload. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my kinematics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the airplane is moving due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s. It's parallel to the ground, so I guess that means it's moving horizontally, right? And it's dropping a payload. The question is asking about the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4 seconds after it's released. Oh wait, and air resistance is neglected, so we don't have to worry about that complicating things.

Wait, so when the payload is released, what happens? Well, from the perspective of someone on the ground, the payload would have an initial velocity of 100 m/s north because it was moving with the plane. But since the plane is moving at a constant speed and not accelerating, the payload should maintain that horizontal velocity, right? Because there's no air resistance, so no forces acting on it horizontally. So in the horizontal (north) direction, the payload's velocity should stay the same as the plane's.

But what about the vertical direction? Oh right, once the payload is released, gravity takes over. So it starts accelerating downward. The initial vertical velocity is zero because the plane was moving parallel to the ground, so no upward or downward component initially. So the payload will start to fall, and after 4 seconds, it will have gained some downward velocity.

Wait, so the velocity relative to the plane. The plane is moving at 100 m/s north. The payload, from the ground's frame, is moving at 100 m/s north plus whatever downward velocity it has gained. But relative to the plane, which is moving north at 100 m/s, the payload's northward velocity should be zero, right? Because both are moving at the same speed north. So relative to the plane, the payload's only movement is downward.

So I need to calculate the downward velocity after 4 seconds. Since the only acceleration is due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/sÂ² downward. The initial vertical velocity is zero, so the velocity after time t is a*t. So v = u + at. Here, u is 0, a is 9.8, t is 4. So v = 9.8 *4 = 39.2 m/s. Oh, wait, but the options are in 40 m/s, so probably rounded to 40.

So the velocity relative to the plane is just the downward component, which is about 40 m/s. So the answer should be 40 m/s down.

Wait, looking at the options, option G says 40 m/s down. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, sometimes I might get confused between relative velocities. So the plane's frame of reference is moving at 100 m/s north. The payload, without air resistance, has no horizontal forces, so its horizontal velocity remains 100 m/s north in the ground frame. But relative to the plane, which is also moving at 100 m/s north, the payload's horizontal velocity is zero. So relative to the plane, the only velocity component is downward due to gravity.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer must be G: 40 m/s down.

The airplane is moving due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s, and it releases a payload while traveling parallel to the ground. Neglecting air resistance, the payload's motion can be analyzed in two components: horizontal (north) and vertical (downward).

1. **Horizontal Motion**:  
   Since the airplane is moving at a constant speed of 100 m/s north and there is no air resistance, the payload retains its horizontal velocity of 100 m/s north relative to the ground. However, relative to the airplane, which is also moving at 100 m/s north, the payload's horizontal velocity is zero.

2. **Vertical Motion**:  
   At the moment of release, the payload has no initial vertical velocity. Under the influence of gravity, it accelerates downward with an acceleration of \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). After 4 seconds, the downward velocity of the payload can be calculated using the kinematic equation:  
   \[
   v = u + at
   \]  
   where \( u = 0 \), \( a = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( t = 4 \, \text{s} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   v = 0 + (9.8)(4) = 39.2 \, \text{m/s}
   \]  
   This is approximately \( 40 \, \text{m/s} \) downward.

3. **Relative Velocity**:  
   Relative to the airplane, the payload has no horizontal velocity (since both the payload and the airplane are moving north at the same speed). The only component of the payload's velocity relative to the airplane is the downward velocity of approximately \( 40 \, \text{m/s} \).

Thus, the velocity of the payload relative to the airplane 4 seconds after release is \( 40 \, \text{m/s} \) downward. The correct answer is:

**G: 40 m/s down**
