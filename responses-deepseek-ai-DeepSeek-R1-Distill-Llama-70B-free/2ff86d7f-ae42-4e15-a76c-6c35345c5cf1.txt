Question:

A scientist used his car to transport a large quantity of highly flammable petroleum derivatives that he needed for his scientific research. The petroleum derivatives were sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after putting the jugs in the back of his car, the scientist was driving along a city street. He was thinking about a difficult scientific question and not paying attention to his driving. As a result, he lost control of the car and drove up onto the sidewalk. The car flipped over. The glass jugs in the back of the car were broken, and the chemicals in them spilled out onto the sidewalk. Moments later, a doctor who witnessed the accident came running over to render medical assistance. As he approached the overturned car, however, the doctor slipped on the petroleum derivatives that had spilled onto the sidewalk. The doctor fell and fractured his ankle. If the doctor asserts a claim against the scientist based on strict liability, will the doctor prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the doctor should have been more careful around the accident site.
B: No, because the scientist was legally transporting the chemicals for his research.
C: Yes, because the scientist was not exercising reasonable care in driving and handling dangerous chemicals.
D: Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.
E: Yes, because the scientist should have warned the doctor about the chemicals.
F: No, because it was unforeseeable that the doctor's injury would result from the type of harm threatened.
G: Yes, because the scientist should have used a safer method to transport the chemicals.
H: No, because the chemicals were not the direct cause of the doctor's injury.
I: Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm.
J: No, because the doctor assumed the risk by voluntarily acting as a Good Samaritan.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically strict liability. Hmm, let me see. The scenario is a scientist transporting flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs in his car. He gets into an accident, the jugs break, chemicals spill, and a doctor slips on them, fracturing his ankle. The doctor is suing under strict liability.

I remember that strict liability applies in certain situations, like when dealing with abnormally dangerous activities. The key here is whether transporting these chemicals counts as such an activity.

So, the elements for strict liability usually involve an activity that's not of common usage, presents a high risk of harm, can't be made safe with ordinary care, and is something that the community doesn't consider acceptable without strict liability.

Wait, the chemicals are highly flammable. The scientist was using them for research, which might be a legitimate purpose. But he was transporting them in ordinary glass jugs, which could be dangerous if they break. So, maybe that's an issue.

The options are A through J. Let's go through them.

Option A says no because the doctor should have been careful. But strict liability doesn't depend on the plaintiff's care; it's about the defendant's activity. So A is probably wrong.

Option B claims the scientist was legally transporting them. But legal transport doesn't necessarily mean not abnormally dangerous. So B might not be the right reason.

Option C says the scientist wasn't exercising reasonable care. But strict liability doesn't require negligence; it's about the type of activity. So C is about negligence, not strict liability, so likely incorrect.

Option D says yes because transporting highly flammable chemicals is abnormally dangerous. That sounds right. The activity itself is dangerous, regardless of negligence.

Option E says the scientist should have warned the doctor. But the accident just happened, and the doctor was a bystander. The scientist might not have had the chance to warn anyone after the accident, so E might not apply.

Option F says it's unforeseeable. But slipping on spilled flammable liquids causing injury seems foreseeable, so F is probably incorrect.

Option G suggests using safer transport. That's more about negligence, not strict liability. So G is likely not the right reason.

Option H says chemicals weren't the direct cause. But the spill directly caused the doctor to slip, so H is wrong.

Option I says the transportation in glass jugs is highly risky. This seems similar to D, pointing out the dangerous activity. So I is a possible answer.

Option J talks about the doctor assuming risk as a Good Samaritan. I don't think that applies here; Good Samaritan laws usually protect the rescuer from liability, not the other way around. So J is incorrect.

Now, comparing D and I. D focuses on the activity being abnormally dangerous. I emphasizes the high risk due to transportation method. The question is whether the activity itself (transporting flammable chemicals) is abnormally dangerous, regardless of the container. Or is it because of using glass jugs?

In strict liability, the focus is on the activity, not the manner of performance. So even if the transport is done carefully, if it's an abnormally dangerous activity, strict liability applies. So using glass jugs might be part of the negligent conduct, but for strict liability, it's the nature of the activity.

Wait, but the activity here is transportation, which is common, but transporting dangerous goods might make it abnormally dangerous. So D says the activity is abnormally dangerous, which makes sense.

Alternatively, option I says the transportation in glass jugs is risky. So maybe the issue is the method (glass jugs) making it dangerous. But strict liability is about the activity, not the method. So I think D is the better answer.

Wait, but in some cases, transportation of hazardous materials is considered abnormally dangerous. So the scientist's action of transporting them would impose strict liability if that's the case.

So the correct answer would be D or I. Hmm. Let me think again.

The Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง520 lists factors for abnormally dangerous activities. One factor is whether the activity involves a high risk of harm. Transporting highly flammable chemicals likely qualifies. Another factor is whether the harm that results is likely to be severe. Yes, fire from flammable liquids can cause severe harm.

So even if the transportation is legal and for a good purpose (research), the activity itself is inherently dangerous. Therefore, the scientist can be held strictly liable.

So the correct answer is D: Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.

Wait, but option I says the transportation in glass jugs necessarily involves high risk. Maybe the choice is between D and I. D is about the activity being abnormally dangerous, while I is about the method. So I think D is the correct answer because it's the activity, not the container, that makes it abnormally dangerous.

The question revolves around whether the scientist can be held strictly liable for the doctor's injuries after transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs. Strict liability applies to abnormally dangerous activities, which are defined by factors such as high risk of harm, severity of potential harm, and the inability to make the activity safe through ordinary care. 

The scientist's transportation of flammable chemicals qualifies as an abnormally dangerous activity due to the inherent risks involved, regardless of whether the transportation was legal or for a legitimate purpose. The use of glass jugs, while potentially negligent, is not the determining factor for strict liability; rather, it is the nature of the activity itself that matters. 

Option D correctly identifies that the activity of transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives is abnormally dangerous, making the scientist strictly liable. Other options either misapply the criteria for strict liability or focus on irrelevant factors, such as the doctor's care or the method of transportation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.
