Question:

A television picture is composed of approximately 300,000 individual picture elements, each of which can attain ten different and distinguishable brightness levels (such as black and shades of gray) for proper contrast. If, for any picture element, the probability of occurrence of the ten brightness levels are equal, and 30 picture frames are being transmitted per second, determine the bandwidth of the T.V. video signal. Assume that the signal-to-noise ratio of 1000 (30 db) is required for proper reproduction of any picture.

Options:

A: 2.5MHz
B: 1.5MHz
C: 6MHz
D: 8MHz
E: 2MHz
F: 4MHz
G: 3MHz
H: 1MHz
I: 7MHz
J: 5MHz

Okay, so I've got this TV bandwidth problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about calculating the bandwidth of a TV video signal based on certain parameters. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that a TV picture has about 300,000 picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel can have ten different brightness levels. So each pixel's brightness is one of ten possible values, right? And the probability of each brightness level occurring is equal, meaning each has the same chance.

They're transmitting 30 frames per second. So that's 30 frames every second. I guess each frame is a complete picture, so the total number of pixels per second would be 300,000 multiplied by 30. Let me do that math. 300k times 30 is 9,000,000 pixels per second. So the data rate in terms of pixels is 9 million per second.

But wait, each pixel can have ten different levels, which I think relates to how much information each pixel carries. Information theory tells us that the amount of information per symbol is log base 2 of the number of possible symbols. So for ten levels, each pixel contributes log2(10) bits of information. Log base 2 of 10 is approximately 3.3219 bits. So each pixel is about 3.32 bits.

So the total information rate, in bits per second, would be the number of pixels per second multiplied by the bits per pixel. So that's 9,000,000 pixels/sec * 3.32 bits/pixel. Let me calculate that. 9 million times 3 is 27 million, and 0.32 times 9 million is 2.88 million. So total is about 29.88 million bits per second, roughly 30 million bits per second.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember something about the bandwidth being related to the bit rate and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Oh right, the formula for channel capacity, which is C = B * log2(1 + SNR), where C is the channel capacity in bits per second, B is the bandwidth in Hz, and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio.

The problem states that a SNR of 1000 (30 dB) is required. Oh wait, because 10^(SNR in dB /10) is the linear SNR. So 30 dB would be 10^(3) = 1000. Right, so SNR is 1000.

So I need to find the bandwidth B such that C = 30 Mbps equals B times log2(1 + 1000). Let me compute that logarithm. 1+1000 is 1001, so log2(1001) is approximately how much? Well, log2(1024) is 10, so 1001 is just a bit less than 1024. Maybe around 9.97? Let's see, 2^10 is 1024, so 2^9.97 is about 1001. Let's just approximate log2(1001) as 10 for simplicity. So then, C = B * 10.

Wait, but if I use 10, then B would be C/10. So 30 million bits per second divided by 10 is 3 million Hz, or 3 MHz. But wait, looking at the options, 3 MHz is option G. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the answer might not be exactly that. Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait another thing. The SNR is given as 1000, which is 30 dB. So the formula is C = B * log2(1 + SNR_linear). So SNR_linear is 1000, so 1 + 1000 is 1001. So log2(1001) is actually very close to 10, as I thought.

So plugging in, 30e6 = B * 10 → B = 3e6 Hz, which is 3 MHz. So the answer would be G: 3MHz.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Because sometimes, in TV systems, there's also factors like aspect ratios, interlacing, and other considerations, but in this problem, those factors aren't provided, so I think we can ignore them.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I calculated the bit rate is incorrect. Let me re-examine that.

Each pixel has 10 possible brightness levels. So the information per pixel is log2(10) ≈ 3.32 bits. So each frame has 300,000 pixels, so per frame, that's 300,000 * 3.32 ≈ 996,000 bits per frame. At 30 frames per second, that's 996,000 *30 ≈ 29,880,000 bits per second, roughly 30 million as I thought earlier.

So then, using the channel capacity formula, C = B * log2(1 + 1000) → 30e6 = B * ~10 → B=3e6 Hz=3 MHz.

Looking at the options, G is 3 MHz. So the answer should be G.

To determine the bandwidth of the TV video signal, we start by calculating the total data rate in bits per second. Each television frame contains 300,000 pixels, and each pixel can take on one of 10 brightness levels. The information per pixel is given by \( \log_2(10) \approx 3.32 \, \text{bits} \). 

For a single frame, the total information is:

\[
300,000 \, \text{pixels/frame} \times 3.32 \, \text{bits/pixel} \approx 996,000 \, \text{bits/frame}.
\]

Since 30 frames are transmitted per second, the total data rate is:

\[
996,000 \, \text{bits/frame} \times 30 \, \text{frames/second} \approx 29,880,000 \, \text{bits/second} \approx 30 \, \text{Mbps}.
\]

Next, we use the channel capacity formula:

\[
C = B \cdot \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}),
\]

where \( C \) is the channel capacity, \( B \) is the bandwidth, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is given as 1000 (or 30 dB). Substituting \( C = 30 \, \text{Mbps} \) and \( \text{SNR} = 1000 \), we calculate:

\[
\log_2(1 + 1000) = \log_2(1001) \approx 10.
\]

Thus, the formula becomes:

\[
30 \times 10^6 = B \cdot 10 \implies B = \frac{30 \times 10^6}{10} = 3 \, \text{MHz}.
\]

From the given options, the bandwidth of the TV video signal is **3 MHz**, which corresponds to option G.
