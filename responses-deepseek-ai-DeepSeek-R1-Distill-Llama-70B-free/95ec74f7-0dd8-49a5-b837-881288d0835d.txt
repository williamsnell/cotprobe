Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question is: Six 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers? The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, so first, I need to understand the problem. We roll six dice, each a standard 6-sided die. Each die has numbers from 1 to 6. We need the probability that exactly three show prime numbers and the other three show composite numbers.

Wait, but wait—hold on. What's the definition of prime and composite numbers on a die? Let me think. On a die, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So in 1-6, the primes are 2, 3, 5. That makes three prime numbers.

Composite numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are not prime, meaning they have divisors other than 1 and themselves. So in 1-6, the composites are 4 and 6. Wait, but what about 1? Is 1 considered prime or composite? Oh right, 1 is neither prime nor composite. So that complicates things.

So, the die has six numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Primes: 2,3,5 → three numbers.

Composite: 4,6 → two numbers.

But wait, that leaves 1. So when the question says "three show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers," does that mean that the other three must be composite? Because 1 is neither, so if any die shows 1, it doesn't fit either category. So the question must be assuming that all dice either show prime or composite. But that's not possible because 1 is neither.

Wait, perhaps the question is intended to have all six dice showing either prime or composite, but that's impossible because 1 isn't either. So maybe the question assumes that 1 is treated as composite? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, no, 1 is neither prime nor composite. So if a die shows 1, it's neither. So for the scenario where exactly three dice are prime and the other three are composite, the three non-primes must be composite. Which would mean that the other three dice must show either 4 or 6. Because 1 is not composite.

So to rephrase, each die must be either prime (2,3,5) or composite (4,6). So for each die, there are 3 primes and 2 composites (since 1 is excluded from both). But wait, no—because 1 is on the die, so each die has a possibility of landing on 1, which is neither. So the event we're interested in requires that all six dice must be either prime or composite, but that's only possible if none of them show 1. Because if any die shows a 1, it's neither, which would mean that the condition isn't met.

Wait, but the problem states that three show primes and the rest show composites. So that would require that all six dice are either prime or composite. So none of them can be 1. So each die must show 2,3,4,5, or 6. Because 1 is excluded.

Wait, but that's an important point. So the sample space is all possible rolls of six dice, each die having 6 possibilities. So the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6.

But in this case, we're considering only the cases where exactly three dice show primes (2,3,5) and the other three show composites (4,6). Also, in these cases, none of the dice can show 1, because if they do, then that die is neither, so it's not counted as either prime or composite. So for the scenario we're considering, all six dice must be in {2,3,4,5,6}, with three primes and three composites.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Suppose I roll a die and it shows 1. Then that die is neither prime nor composite. So for the condition to hold—exactly three primes and exactly three composites—the other three dice must be composite, but any die showing 1 would make it neither. So such cases would not satisfy the condition of three primes and three composites. Therefore, in our desired outcomes, all dice must either be prime or composite, meaning no dice show 1.

So, perhaps the setup is such that each die must be either prime or composite, i.e., not 1. So for each die, the probability of being prime is 3/6 = 1/2, and composite is 2/6 = 1/3. Wait no, that's not correct because 1 is neither, so the probabilities change.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a binomial-like distribution, but considering the correct probabilities.

Each die has three possible outcomes relevant to our condition: prime (2,3,5), composite (4,6), or neither (1). But in our desired scenario, we only want dice that are either prime or composite. So the probability that a single die is prime is 3/6 = 1/2, composite is 2/6 = 1/3, and neither is 1/6.

But in our problem, we need exactly three primes and three composites in six dice. So each of the six dice must be either prime or composite, and among those, exactly three are primes and three are composites.

Wait, but for that to happen, none of the dice can show 1. Because if any die shows 1, it's not part of the three primes or three composites. So the presence of a 1 would mean that the condition isn't met.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to have six dice, each showing either 2,3,4,5,6, with exactly three primes (2,3,5) and three composites (4,6). So each die must be in {2,3,4,5,6}, and exactly three are primes.

So first, I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes.

But perhaps it's better to approach this using combinatorics and probability.

Each die has 6 faces. The primes are 2,3,5 (three numbers), composites are 4,6 (two numbers), and 1 is neither.

We want exactly three primes and three composites in six rolls, with no 1s.

So the probability would be:

Number of ways to choose which three dice show primes, times the probability of those three being primes, times the probability of the other three being composites.

Wait, but each die must be either prime or composite, so the probability that a die is prime is 3/6 = 1/2, and composite is 2/6 = 1/3. But wait, that's the probability for a single die. But when considering all six, the probability would be (number of favorable)/(total possible).

Alternatively, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose three dice to be primes, and the other three to be composites, multiplied by the number of possibilities for each.

So let me break it down.

1. Choose which three of the six dice will show primes. The number of ways to choose is C(6,3) = 20.

2. For each of those three dice, they can show any of the three prime numbers (2,3,5). So each has 3 possibilities. So 3^3 = 27 possibilities.

3. For the remaining three dice, each must show a composite number (4 or 6), so each has 2 possibilities. So 2^3 = 8 possibilities.

So the total number of favorable outcomes is 20 * 27 * 8.

Wait, let me compute that: 20 * 27 = 540, 540 * 8 = 4320.

Wait, but wait—no, that's not correct because when I do it that way, I'm considering each die's possible outcomes. But the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice is 6^6. So the probability is (number of favorable) / (total possible).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability step by step.

Each die has a 1/2 chance of being prime, 1/3 chance of being composite, and 1/6 chance of being neither. But in this problem, we're only considering the cases where each die is either prime or composite, i.e., no 1s. So perhaps we can model it as a conditional probability.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to compute the probability as:

The probability that exactly three dice are prime, three are composite, and none are 1.

So for each die, the probability of being prime is 3/6 = 1/2, composite is 2/6 = 1/3, and neither is 1/6.

But to have exactly three primes and three composites, each die must be either prime or composite, so the probability for each die is (1/2 + 1/3) = 5/6. But we need exactly three primes and three composites in six trials.

So the probability can be calculated using the binomial coefficient multiplied by the probabilities.

Wait, but since each trial (die roll) can result in three outcomes, but we're looking for a specific count of two outcomes (prime and composite), perhaps the multinomial distribution applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as each die must be either prime or composite, with no 1s, and then within that, the probability of exactly three primes and three composites.

So first, the probability that a single die is either prime or composite is 5/6 (since 1 is excluded). Then, given that, the probability of being prime is (3/5) and composite is (2/5), because out of the 5 possible outcomes (2,3,4,5,6), 3 are prime and 2 are composite.

Wait, that's a good approach. So using conditional probability: the probability that, given a die is not 1, it is prime is 3/5, and composite is 2/5.

So now, the problem reduces to: in six trials, each with probability 3/5 of being a success (prime) and 2/5 of being a failure (composite), what is the probability of exactly three successes and three failures.

Wait no, actually, in this context, the successes would be primes, and failures composites. Wait, but in the problem, we need exactly three primes and three composites. So the number of ways is C(6,3), and then each way has (3/5)^3 * (2/5)^3.

So the probability would be C(6,3) * (3/5)^3 * (2/5)^3.

Wait, but wait a second—this seems like a binomial probability. The formula would be:

P = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

But in this case, the "success" is prime, with p = 3/5, and the "failure" is composite, with p = 2/5. But wait, in the binomial distribution, the two outcomes must be complementary, i.e., p + (1-p) = 1. But in this case, 3/5 + 2/5 = 1, so that's correct. So this approach is valid.

So applying this, the probability is C(6,3) * (3/5)^3 * (2/5)^3.

But wait, but this is the probability under the condition that all dice are either prime or composite. But the actual probability, without any conditions, would be this value multiplied by the probability that all dice are either prime or composite. Wait, no—the approach I took earlier was using conditional probability, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The initial approach considered that each die must not be 1, so the probability of that is (5/6)^6, but then within that, the probability of exactly three primes and three composites is C(6,3) * (3/5)^3 * (2/5)^3.

Wait, no—that's not correct. Because the (5/6) is the probability that a single die is not 1, but when rolling six dice, the probability that all six are not 1 is (5/6)^6. But in our problem, we are looking for exactly three primes and three composites among the six dice. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute the probability that exactly three are primes, three are composites, and none are 1s.

So the total number of favorable outcomes is C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3), as each prime die has 3 possibilities and each composite die has 2.

The total possible outcomes are 6^6.

So the probability is [C(6,3) * 3^3 * 2^3] / 6^6.

Let me compute this.

C(6,3) is 20.

3^3 is 27, 2^3 is 8. So 20 * 27 = 540, 540 * 8 = 4320.

6^6 is 6*6*6*6*6*6. Let me compute that: 6^2 = 36, 6^3=216, 6^4=1296, 6^5=7776, 6^6=46656.

So 4320 / 46656. Let me simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4320:

But perhaps it's easier to compute the GCD. Let me see:

4320 ÷ 48 = 90, 46656 ÷48 = 972.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: both are divisible by 48? Let me check:

Wait, 4320 divided by 48: 48 * 90 = 4320, yes. 46656 ÷48: 48 * 972 = 46656. So now the fraction is 90/972.

Simplify again: 90 and 972 are both divisible by 18. 90 ÷18=5, 972 ÷18=54. So 5/54.

Wait, 5/54 is option B. Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 4320 divided by 46656:

Let me compute 46656 ÷ 4320.

Well, 4320 * 10 = 43200, which is less than 46656. The difference is 3456. 4320 * 0.8 = 3456. So 10.8 times. So 4320 * 10.8 = 46656.

Which means 4320/46656 = 1/10.8. But 10.8 is 54/5, so 1/(54/5) = 5/54. So yes, 5/54. So the probability is 5/54.

Looking at the options, option B is 5/54.

But wait, earlier I thought of the conditional probability approach, but perhaps I made a mistake because in the conditional approach, I'd have to account for the fact that each die must not be 1, which complicates things. But in this calculation, I considered all possible outcomes, including those where some dice show 1, but in the numerator, I only count those outcomes where exactly three are primes, three are composites, and none are 1. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another way to think about it: each die has 3 primes, 2 composites, and 1 neither. The total possible rolls: 6^6.

Favorable: exactly three primes and three composites. So for each die, it's either prime (3 choices) or composite (2 choices), and exactly three of each across six dice. 

So the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,3) * (3^3) * (2^3) = 20 * 27 * 8 = 4320.

Total possible: 6^6 = 46656.

Simplify 4320/46656: 4320 ÷ 4320 = 1, 46656 ÷4320 = 10.8. So 1/10.8 = 5/54.

Yes, that's correct. So option B is correct. Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 5/55

B: 5/54

C: 125/7776

D:3/18

E:125/2916

F:5/36

G:5/16

H:10/54

I:1/6

J:125/3888

So yes, option B is 5/54. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

To determine the probability that three of the six rolled dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers, we first analyze the numbers on a 6-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

- **Prime numbers**: 2, 3, 5 (three primes).
- **Composite numbers**: 4, 6 (two composites).
- **Neither prime nor composite**: 1.

The problem requires that exactly three dice show primes and the other three show composites. This means none of the dice can show 1, as 1 is neither prime nor composite. 

### Step 1: Total number of possible outcomes
When rolling six dice, each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6^6 = 46656
\]

### Step 2: Number of favorable outcomes
We need to count the number of ways to roll three primes and three composites:
1. **Choose which three dice show primes**: The number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{6}{3} = 20
   \]
2. **Assign prime numbers to the three chosen dice**: Each of the three dice can show any of the three prime numbers (2, 3, 5), so there are:
   \[
   3^3 = 27
   \]
   possible outcomes for the primes.
3. **Assign composite numbers to the remaining three dice**: Each of the three dice can show either of the two composite numbers (4, 6), so there are:
   \[
   2^3 = 8
   \]
   possible outcomes for the composites.
