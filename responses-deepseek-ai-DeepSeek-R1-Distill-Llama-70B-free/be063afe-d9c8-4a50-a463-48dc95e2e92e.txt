What is the best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment?

C: Move for a new trial or in the alternative for remittitur to reduce the award in light of the shortened duration of the plaintiff's injuries.
D: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff misled the court about her condition.
E: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that there is newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent.
F: Request a retrial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that could alter the verdict.
G: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed a fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.
H: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief that the plaintiff's injuries would be permanent.
I: File an appeal with the appellate court alleging that the judgment was based on false information.
J: Move for relief from the judgment arguing that the jury's decision was influenced by emotional rather than factual reasoning.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure out the best answer. Let's break it down.

The situation is that a plaintiff sued a defendant in federal court for injuries from an accident. The plaintiff said she was permanently paralyzed in her legs and presented evidence at trial. The jury agreed and awarded her $5 million. Now, two months after the judgment, the defendant gets a video showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor. So the defendant wants to seek relief from the judgment. The question is, what's the best way for the defendant to do that?

The options are A through J. I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that after a judgment is entered, there are certain procedures to challenge it. I think one common method is a motion for a new trial or to set aside the judgment. There's also something about newly discovered evidence.

Looking at the options, many of them involve motions to set aside the judgment or for a new trial based on new evidence. So the key here is that the defendant has new evidence that contradicts the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff had claimed permanent paralysis, but the video shows her jogging, implying that her paralysis wasn't permanent after all.

So the defendant probably wants to argue that this new evidence shows that the plaintiff misled the court or that there was fraud. Because if the plaintiff's condition wasn't actually permanent, that would affect the damages awarded, especially if the jury based the $5 million on the belief that her injuries were permanent.

In federal courts, I think the rule related to this is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60. Rule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a judgment for several reasons, including mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; newly discovered evidence; fraud; etc.

Specifically, Rule 60(b)(3) deals with fraud by the opposing party. So if the plaintiff committed fraud, like exaggerating her injuries, the defendant can move for relief under this rule.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Move to set aside the verdict based on new evidence. That's possible, but I think it's more specific than that.

Option B: Moves for relief because the injuries weren't as severe. That's a bit vague. It doesn't specify fraud.

Option C: Asks for a new trial or remittitur because the injuries were shorter. Remittitur is when the court reduces the award, but I'm not sure if that's the primary approach here. The main issue is that the plaintiff misled the court about the permanence of her injuries.

Option D: Says the plaintiff misled the court. That's closer, but I think it's more about fraud.

Option E: Newly discovered evidence that injuries weren't permanent. That's under Rule 60(b)(2), which is for newly discovered evidence. But is that the best fit?

Option F: Requests a retrial on new evidence. That's a motion for a new trial, which is under Rule 59. But the time for that might have passed. The question says two months have passed, and typically, a motion for a new trial must be made within 28 days under Rule 59.

So if two months have passed, Rule 59 is probably too late. Then the defendant would have to use Rule 60, which allows up to one year for certain reasons, including fraud.

So between Rule 60(b)(2) and (b)(3). Rule 60(b)(2) is for newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered before. Rule 60(b)(3) is for fraud.

In this scenario, the defendant got the video two months after judgment. So the video is new evidence showing the plaintiff wasn't paralyzed. But more importantly, the plaintiff committed fraud by claiming permanent paralysis when she wasn't. So the ground would be fraud under Rule 60(b)(3).

Looking at the options again:

Option G: Move for relief on the ground that the plaintiff committed fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries. That fits because the plaintiff's fraud was in claiming permanent injuries.

Option D says the plaintiff misled the court, which is a bit more general. Option G is more specific about fraud.

So the best option is G.
</think>

The defendant seeks relief from a judgment where the plaintiff claimed permanent paralysis but was later seen jogging, indicating her injuries were not permanent. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) allows relief from a judgment under certain circumstances. Specifically, Rule 60(b)(3) addresses fraud by the opposing party. Here, the plaintiff's claim of permanent paralysis constitutes fraud, as it directly impacted the damages awarded. Among the options, the best choice is to move for relief under Rule 60(b)(3) due to the plaintiff's fraudulent representation of her condition.

G: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed a fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.

Answer: G
