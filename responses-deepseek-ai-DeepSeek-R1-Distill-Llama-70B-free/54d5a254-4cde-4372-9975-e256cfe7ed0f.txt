Question:

Each year the state provides a number of non- interest-bearing loans andlor scholarships to candidates for the degree of L. L. B or J. D. at the state's law school. The applicable state statute limits eligibility to citizens of the United States and aliens seeking U. S. citizenship. A candidate for a J. D. degree at the state law school applied for one of the non-interest-bearing loans. Since he did not intend to seek U. S. citizenship, he was refused the loan for ineligibility under the state statute. In a suit by the candidate challenging the constitutionality of the state statute, he will

Options:

A: lose, because the state has the right to limit eligibility for its programs.
B: lose, because the statute promotes a compelling state interest.
C: lose, because the statute is in accordance with the state's education policies.
D: lose, because alienage classifications are not, per Se, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.
E: win, because the statute infringes on the candidate's right to financial aid.
F: win, because classifications by a state that are based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.
G: lose, because classifications by a state based on citizenship status are constitutional.
H: win, because the statute is violative of the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
I: win, because the statute discriminates against those who choose not to pursue U.S. citizenship.
J: win, because the statute violates the candidate's right to equal treatment under the law.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with equal protection and state statutes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a state providing non-interest-bearing loans or scholarships to law students. The eligibility is limited to U.S. citizens or aliens seeking citizenship. A candidate for a J.D. applied but was denied because he didn't intend to seek citizenship. Now he's suing, claiming the statute is unconstitutional.

I remember that under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, states can't deny equal protection to any person within their jurisdiction. This includes both citizens and non-citizens, but there are exceptions when it comes to alienage.

Wait, I think there's a distinction between different types of classifications. For example, race is a suspect classification and gets strict scrutiny, while things like age might get a lower level of scrutiny. But what about citizenship or alienage?

I recall that in some cases, the Supreme Court has held that classifications based on alienage are subject to strict scrutiny, especially when they impinge on fundamental rights. But wait, isn't that only for state laws that classify people as citizens or non-citizens? Because the Court has sometimes treated alienage as a suspect classification.

Wait, but another angle: there's a case called Bernal v. Fainter, where Texas required notaries public to be U.S. citizens. The Court held that the law was unconstitutional because it imposed an invidious discrimination against aliens. So, strict scrutiny applies to state laws that use alienage as a classification.

But then again, I think there's an exception for certain state functions. Like, the state can limit some benefits to citizens if it's rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Hmm, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, no, I think that's more about the federal government. States have to be careful with alienage classifications. So, in cases where the state benefits are involved, like scholarships or loans, if they limit based on citizenship, that's subject to strict scrutiny.

In this question, the state is providing financial aid, which is a benefit. The statute excludes anyone who isn't a citizen or seeking citizenship. So, the plaintiff is an alien not seeking citizenship, so he's excluded.

So, does the state's interest in promoting citizenship justify the exclusion? Or is this a violation under equal protection?

I think the key here is that the state's classification is based on alienage, which is a suspect category. Therefore, the statute would be subject to strict scrutiny. The state would need a compelling interest and the law must be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.

But does the state's interest in encouraging individuals to become citizens qualify as a compelling interest? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the state's interest is in preserving limited resources for those who are more likely to remain in the state or contribute as citizens.

But wait, in the case of Plyler v. Doe, the Court struck down a Texas law that withheld state funds for the education of undocumented children. The Court said that the law created a classification based on alienage that couldn't withstand strict scrutiny, as the state's interests (saving money and discouraging illegal immigration) weren't compelling enough.

Similarly, in this scenario, the state is denying financial aid based on alienage. The candidate is legally present as an alien, I assume, since he's attending the state law school. So, the state's exclusion might not survive strict scrutiny.

But wait, another case: when the state limits certain professions to citizens, like in the case of notaries, it's been held unconstitutional. So, the state can't do that unless it's a government position that requires citizenship, like certain public offices.

So, applying this to the question, the state's statute is likely unconstitutional because it discriminates based on alienage, which is a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore, the candidate should win the case.

Looking at the options:

Option F says "win, because classifications by a state that are based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny." That sounds correct because strict scrutiny applies.

Option D says "lose, because alienage classifications are not, per se, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause." Wait, that's not right because some cases do treat alienage as a suspect classification, which would make the statute presumptively invalid unless the state meets strict scrutiny.

Option G says "lose, because classifications by a state based on citizenship status are constitutional." I don't think that's correct because such classifications are subject to strict scrutiny.

Option H mentions the privileges or immunities clause. The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is about state citizenship, not national citizenship. So, that might not apply here.

Option I and J deal with discrimination and equal treatment, but F is more specific about the level of scrutiny.

So, the correct answer should be F. The candidate will win because the statute's classification is inherently suspect.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a state statute that limits eligibility for non-interest-bearing loans and scholarships to U.S. citizens and aliens seeking citizenship. The plaintiff, a J.D. candidate who is an alien not seeking citizenship, was denied the loan and challenged the statute under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

The analysis focuses on whether classifications based on alienage are permissible. Under the Equal Protection Clause, certain classifications, such as race, are inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court has also treated alienage as a suspect classification in some cases, particularly when it impinges on fundamental rights. For example, in *Bernal v. Fainter*, the Court held that a state law requiring notaries public to be U.S. citizens was unconstitutional because it imposed invidious discrimination against aliens. Similarly, in *Plyler v. Doe*, the Court struck down a law denying education to undocumented children based on alienage, as the state's interests were not compelling enough to justify the classification.

In this case, the state's statute excludes aliens not seeking citizenship from receiving financial aid, which is a benefit. Since alienage is a suspect classification, the statute would be subject to strict scrutiny. The state would need to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. However, encouraging citizenship or preserving resources for citizens are not likely to meet the high bar of strict scrutiny.

Among the options provided, Option F correctly states that classifications based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny. This aligns with the principle that such classifications are presumptively invalid unless the state can meet the stringent requirements of strict scrutiny. Other options, such as D and G, are incorrect because they suggest that alienage classifications are not inherently suspect or are constitutional, which contradicts established precedent.

Thus, the candidate will win because the statute's classification based on alienage is inherently suspect and fails to meet constitutional standards.
