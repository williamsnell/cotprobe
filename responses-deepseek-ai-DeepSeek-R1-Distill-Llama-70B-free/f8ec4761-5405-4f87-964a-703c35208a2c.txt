Okay, so I've got this physics question here about steam engines and their maximum power. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says old-fashioned steam engines were powered by coal transferred from the tender to the engine by human stokers using a shovel. We need to find the maximum power such an engine could attain. The options are from A to J, each with different powers of ten multiplied by 6.

Hmm, power is measured in watts, which is joules per second. So I need to figure out the energy being transferred per second.

First, I remember that the power of a steam engine depends on how much coal is being burned and the energy released from that coal. But wait, human stokers shoveling coal—so this is about the rate at which the stokers can feed coal into the engine.

So, the maximum power would be limited by how fast the stokers can shovel. Let's think about a human's work rate. A person can maybe shovel a certain amount per second. But I'm not exactly sure about the numbers here.

Let me break it down. Let's say a stoker can shovel a certain mass of coal per second. The energy content of coal is something I should remember. Coal typically has an energy density around 24-30 megajoules per kilogram. Let's average that to about 27 MJ/kg.

So if I can find out how much coal a stoker can handle per second, I can multiply by the energy per kg to get power.

Wait, but what's a realistic shoveling rate? A human can maybe shovel a few kilograms per minute. Let me think. If a stoker is shoveling coal into the engine, perhaps they can manage about, say, 10 kg per minute? That seems a bit high, but maybe possible. Alternatively, maybe it's less, like 5 kg per minute. But wait, power plants have these calculations, but this is a steam engine, which is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units. Let's convert everything into per second.

If the stoker can shovel X kilograms per second, then the power would be energy per kg * X kg/s.

So if X is in kg/s, then power P = (energy per kg) * X.

But what's X? Let me think about a person shoveling. A shovel might hold, say, 10 kg of coal. How many times can a person shovel per minute? Maybe 10 times a minute? So that's 100 kg per minute, which is about 1.666 kg per second (since 100/60 ≈ 1.666).

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me think again. Maybe each shovel is 5 kg, and a person can do maybe 20 shovels per minute. So 5 kg *20 =100 kg per minute, same as before, about 1.666 kg/s. But that seems high for a person's sustained rate.

Alternatively, maybe it's more like 10 shovels per minute, each with 5 kg, so 50 kg per minute, which is ~0.833 kg/s.

But I'm not sure. I think in reality, a person can't sustain shoveling coal that quickly for long. Maybe more like 0.5 kg/s? Let's say the stoker can manage about 1 kg per second. That's perhaps a more manageable rate.

So if the energy per kg is about 27 MJ/kg, which is 27,000,000 J/kg.

So power P = 27e6 J/kg * 1 kg/s = 27e6 W, which is 27 megawatts.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one would be B:6e6 or F:6e7.

Wait, my calculation is 2.7e7 W. Hmm, that's 27 million watts, which is 27 MW. So 2.7e7 W.

Looking at the options:

B:6e6 W → 6,000,000 W → 6 MW.

F:6e7 →60,000,000 W →60 MW.

Wait, but my estimate was 27 MW, which isn't exactly in the options. So perhaps my initial assumptions are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the energy per kg of coal is different. Let me double-check. Coal's energy content varies, but I think average is about 24 MJ/kg. So let's use 24.

So 24e6 J/kg * 1 kg/s = 24e6 W →24 MW.

Still, none of the options match exactly. So perhaps the question is considering that a stoker can't shovel as much as 1 kg/s.

Wait, maybe the rate is lower. Let's say 0.25 kg/s. Then power would be 24e6 * 0.25 =6e6 W, which is option B.

But why 0.25 kg/s? That's 0.25 kg per second, which is 15 kg per minute. If a stoker is handling, say, 15 kg per minute, that's 0.25 kg/s. How many shovels would that be? If each shovel is 5 kg, that's 3 shovels per minute, which seems low. But perhaps each shovel is less, like 1 kg. Then 15 kg/min would be 15 shovels per minute. That's one every 4 seconds. Seems possible but perhaps on the lower side.

Alternatively, maybe the efficiency of the steam engine is considered. Because not all the energy in the coal is converted into mechanical work. Steam engines are typically around, say, 10% efficient. So the actual mechanical power would be a fraction of the thermal energy.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum power the engine could attain, which I think refers to the thermal power input, not the output. Or does it mean the mechanical output?

Hmm, the question says "maximum power such an engine could attain." So probably the power output, which would be less than the input due to inefficiency.

But if I calculate based on the input, I get higher numbers. Let's think. Suppose the stoker can shovel 0.25 kg/s, and coal is 24 MJ/kg. Then the thermal power input is 24e6 * 0.25 =6e6 W, which is 6 MW. If the engine is, say, 10% efficient, the output would be 0.6 MW. But the question is about the engine's power, which would be the output. So 0.6e6 W →600,000 W.

Looking at the options, option H is 6e3 W (6000), which is way lower. Option I is 6e4 (60,000), option B is 6e6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the power input, not the output. Because the output would be much lower, and 6e6 is an option.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stoker rate. Suppose the stoker can handle 2 kg/s, which is 120 kg per minute. That would be 24e6 * 2 =48e6 W input, which is 48 MW. Then, with 10% efficiency, output is 4.8 MW.

But none of the options are 4.8e6. The closest is F:6e7 (60 MW) but that's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the stoker's rate is higher. Wait, perhaps I'm underestimating the possible shoveling rate. Let me think. In old times, stokers on ships, like on the Titanic, had to shovel a lot. Maybe they could do 2-3 kg per second. Let's say 2 kg/s.

So 2 kg/s *24e6 J/kg =48e6 W →48 MW input. If the engine is, say, 10% efficient, output is 4.8 MW.

But the options don't have 4.8e6. So perhaps the question is just considering the input and not the efficiency, or perhaps it's assuming a higher efficiency.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not considering real-world efficiencies and just wants the maximum theoretical power, assuming all energy is converted. But that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle. Maybe the question is about the power in terms of the work the engine can perform, which would be based on the steam cycle. But without knowing the details of the engine, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible is determined by the energy content of the coal and the rate it can be fed. Let's think in terms of the maximum possible. What's the maximum a human can shovel?

I recall that a person can sustain about 100 watts of power output (like cycling). But shoveling is different; perhaps higher but not by much. Wait, but that's the person's power output, not the energy content of the coal.

Wait, if a stoker is doing work to shovel the coal, that's separate from the energy in the coal. The energy from the coal is what powers the engine. So the stoker's work is just to move the coal, but the engine's power comes from burning the coal.

So the maximum power of the engine would be determined by how fast the coal is burned, which depends on the shoveling rate.

So, perhaps the stoker can shovel, say, 1 kg every few seconds.

Let me think of another approach. What's the typical power of a steam locomotive? I think they usually range from about 500 kW to a few MW. So, for example, the Flying Scotsman might be around 1-2 MW.

If that's the case, then the options would need to be in the 1e6 range. Option B is 6e6 W, which is 6 MW. That seems plausible for a large engine.

So perhaps the correct answer is B:6e6 W.

But wait, earlier my calculation with 0.25 kg/s gave 6e6 W input, assuming 24 MJ/kg. So that lines up with option B.

But steam engines aren't 100% efficient. So if the input is 6e6 W, the output would be, say, 10% of that, which is 6e5 W. But the question is about the maximum power the engine could attain. So it's probably referring to the output.

Wait, but if the engine's maximum output is, say, 6e5 W, that would be 600 kW. But the options don't have that. Option G is 6e5, which is 600,000 W.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is: What is the maximum power such an engine could attain? So, it's the power output of the engine. But the engine's output depends on the energy input from the coal, minus losses.

So, the engine's output is (energy in coal per second) multiplied by efficiency.

If the energy in coal per second is P_thermal, then P_mechanical = efficiency * P_thermal.

So, let's say the stoker can supply coal at a rate of m kg/s, each with energy c MJ/kg. Then P_thermal = m * c.

Assuming c is about 24 MJ/kg, and m is, say, 0.25 kg/s, then P_thermal is 6e6 W (6 MW). If efficiency is 10%, P_mechanical is 0.6e6 W (600 kW). But 600 kW isn't one of the options except for option G (6e5 is 600,000 W). Wait, 6e5 is 600,000, which is 600 kW.

Wait, no, 6e5 is 600,000 W, which is 600 kW. So that's an option (G). But earlier, I thought the typical steam engine is about 1-2 MW. So which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the stoker can shovel more. Let me think, maybe 0.5 kg/s. Then P_thermal would be 24e6 *0.5=12e6 W →12 MW. With 10% efficiency, P_mechanical is 1.2e6 W →1.2 MW. But none of the options are exactly 1.2e6. The closest is B:6e6 or perhaps I:6e4.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is simplifying and just wants the calculation based on the stoker's rate without considering efficiency.

If the maximum power the engine can attain is the power from the coal, then using 0.25 kg/s gives 6e6 W, which is option B. Alternatively, if it's considering the output, then it's lower.

But the question says "maximum power such an engine could attain." So perhaps it's the maximum possible, which would be limited by the energy input, not the output. So in that case, the answer would be option B:6e6 W.

Alternatively, if the engine's efficiency is high, say 20%, then 6e6 *0.2=1.2e6 W. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the maximum power without considering real-world efficiencies. Maybe the question assumes all the energy is converted, which isn't realistic, but perhaps that's the approach expected here.

So, if the stoker can shovel 1 kg/s, then P=24e6 *1=24e6 W=24 MW. But the options don't have that. The closest is F:6e7 (60 MW) or E:6e11 (way too high).

Alternatively, perhaps the stoker can't shovel as much as 1 kg/s. Maybe 0.25 kg/s is more realistic, leading to 6e6 W. So option B.

I think I'm going to go with option B:6e6 W.

To determine the maximum power of an old-fashioned steam engine powered by coal shoveled by human stokers, we need to consider the energy content of coal and the rate at which coal can be shoveled into the engine. 

1. **Energy Content of Coal**: Coal typically has an energy density of approximately 24 MJ/kg. This value is used as the energy per kilogram of coal.

2. **Shoveling Rate**: The rate at which a human stoker can shovel coal is a critical factor. A realistic estimate for a sustained shoveling rate is about 0.25 kg/s (15 kg per minute). This assumes the stoker can maintain a moderate pace without exceeding human physical limits.

3. **Power Calculation**: The power input to the engine is calculated by multiplying the energy content of coal by the shoveling rate:
   \[
   P_{\text{thermal}} = \text{Energy per kg} \times \text{Shoveling Rate} = 24 \times 10^6 \, \text{J/kg} \times 0.25 \, \text{kg/s} = 6 \times 10^6 \, \text{W}.
   \]
   This gives a thermal power input of 6 MW.

4. **Efficiency Consideration**: While steam engines are not 100% efficient, the question asks for the maximum power the engine could attain. This is interpreted as the power input from the coal, not the mechanical output. Therefore, efficiency losses are not subtracted in this calculation.

5. **Comparison with Options**: Among the given options, the closest match to the calculated power input is \( 6 \times 10^6 \, \text{W} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Thus, the maximum power such an engine could attain is approximately \( 6 \times 10^6 \, \text{W} \).
