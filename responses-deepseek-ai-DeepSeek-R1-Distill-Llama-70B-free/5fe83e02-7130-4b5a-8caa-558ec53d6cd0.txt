Question:

After her husband died in a hospital, a widow directed the hospital to send her husband's body to a funeral home for burial. The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress. She has sued the hospital. Is the hospital likely to be held liable to the widow?

Options:

A: No, because the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm.
B: No, because the hospital's mistake was not intentional.
C: Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress. 
D: Yes, because the hospital was responsible for the correct identification and handling of the body.
E: Yes, because hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses.
F: No, because the widow did not suffer any physical harm.
G: No, because the widow did not witness the cremation.
H: No, because the widow was not physically present at the time of the incident.
I: Yes, because the hospital should have double-checked the identity of the body before sending it for cremation.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a widow suing a hospital after her husband's body was mistakenly cremated. Hmm, I need to figure out if the hospital is liable. Let me break this down.

First, the situation is that the widow directed the hospital to send her husband's body to a funeral home for burial. But the hospital made a mistake and sent the wrong body to be cremated. When she found out, she suffered serious emotional distress and is suing.

The question is about whether the hospital is likely to be held liable. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that in tort law, there's something about negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). For a plaintiff to recover, certain criteria must be met. I think one of the key elements is that the defendant's negligence caused the emotional distress, and that it was foreseeable.

Wait, but I also remember that some jurisdictions have specific rules about when emotional distress is actionable. Like, sometimes you need a physical injury or the plaintiff must have been in the zone of danger. But other times, if the situation is particularly egregious or in certain contexts, like handling a corpse, the rules might be different.

In this case, the hospital was handling the body, which is a sensitive situation. The widow didn't witness the cremation, and she didn't suffer any physical harm. So, some options might say no because she wasn't in danger or didn't have physical harm. But I think there's an exception when it comes to mishandling corpses.

I recall cases where mishandling of a corpse can lead to liability for emotional distress without the need for physical harm because it's considered especially likely to cause distress. So even if the widow wasn't present and didn't have physical harm, the negligent handling of the body could be enough.

Looking at the options, option C says yes because the negligent handling was especially likely to cause her serious emotional distress. That sounds familiar. Option D also says yes because the hospital was responsible, but I think the key here is the foreseeability and the nature of the act.

Option A says no because she wasn't in danger of bodily harm. But I think that's more about the zone of danger test, which may not apply here. Option B says no because the mistake wasn't intentional, but negligence can still be a basis for liability.

Option F says no because she didn't suffer physical harm. But again, in corpse mishandling cases, that's not always required. Option G and H are about witnessing or being present, which I don't think are necessary in this scenario.

Option I says yes because they should have double-checked, which is true, but the question is about liability for emotional distress, not just negligence.

So, putting it together, the correct answer is probably C because the handling of the body was negligent and that's the kind of situation that's especially foreseeable to cause emotional distress.

The question revolves around whether the hospital can be held liable for the widow's emotional distress caused by the negligent misidentification and cremation of her husband's body. The key issue is whether the hospital's negligence in handling the body constitutes a basis for liability under the doctrine of negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED).

In tort law, NIED requires that the defendant's negligence foreseeably causes the plaintiff's emotional distress. Mishandling a corpse is recognized in some jurisdictions as a situation where emotional distress is particularly foreseeable, even without physical harm or the plaintiff being in the "zone of danger." This exception often applies because handling corpses is inherently sensitive and likely to cause significant emotional harm to loved ones.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, F, G, H**: These options focus on factors like lack of physical harm, intent, witnessing the incident, or physical presence. However, these are not necessarily determinative in cases involving mishandling of corpses, where emotional distress is foreseeable without these elements.
- **D, I**: While these options address the hospital's responsibility and negligence, they do not specifically focus on the foreseeability of emotional distress, which is central to NIED.
- **C**: This option directly addresses the foreseeability of emotional distress due to the negligent handling of the body, aligning with the exception for corpse mishandling cases.

Thus, the hospital is likely to be held liable because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause the widow serious emotional distress.
