The security guard knew that the barber, an elderly man, had a history of significant heart problems. The security guard decided to play a joke on his friend. The security guard took out his gun, burst through the door of the barber shop, pointed the gun at the friend, and shouted, "Don't move or I'll shoot!" The barber, thinking that an armed intruder was about to shoot the friend, suffered a heart attack and collapsed. If the barber brings suit against the security guard for infliction of emotional distress and seeks recovery for damages arising from the heart attack, he should

A: prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present.
B: not prevail, because the security guard did not physically harm the barber.
C: not prevail, because the barber was not a member of the friend's immediate family.
D: not prevail, because the barber had a pre-existing health condition.
E: prevail, because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.
F: prevail, because the security guard assaulted the friend.
G: prevail, because the security guard's actions were negligent and reckless.
H: prevail, because the security guard's actions caused the barber severe emotional distress.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with intentional infliction of emotional distress. Let me try to break it down.

The situation is a security guard who's licensed to carry a concealed handgun. He sees his friend in a barber shop and decides to play a joke. He takes out his gun, bursts in, points it at his friend, and shouts, "Don't move or I'll shoot!" The barber, who has a history of heart problems, thinks an intruder is about to shoot his friend, so he has a heart attack and collapses. Now, the barber is suing the security guard for emotional distress and the heart attack damages.

Hmm, the question is whether the barber will prevail in his claim. So, the issue here is whether the guard's actions constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) towards the barber.

I remember that IIED has specific elements. The plaintiff must show that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, intentional or reckless, causing severe emotional distress which results in physical harm. So, the key elements are outrageous conduct, intent or recklessness, severe distress, and physical harm.

In this case, the guard's actions were intentionalâ€”he meant to play a joke. But the barber wasn't the target; the friend was. So, maybe the guard didn't intend to harm the barber directly. But wait, the guard knew the barber was present because he saw his friend inside. Also, the barber had a history of heart issues, but did the guard know that? The question doesn't say, so I can't assume that.

So, the guard pointed the gun at the friend, not the barber. The barber overheard the threat and got so scared that he had a heart attack. So, the guard's act was directed at the friend, but it caused distress to the barber. 

Wait, but IIED requires that the conduct be directed at the plaintiff. So, if the guard was aiming the gun at the friend, not the barber, can the barber claim IIED? Because the guard's actions were towards the friend, but the barber was a bystander.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of negligence rather than IIED. But the question is about infliction of emotional distress, so probably IIED.

Another angle: the guard's actions were reckless. He knew the barber was there, an elderly man with heart problems. If he knew about the heart condition, then perhaps he should have known that his actions could cause harm. But the question doesn't say he knew about the heart problems, only that the barber had them. So maybe the guard didn't know, but he knew the barber was present.

But IIED requires that the conduct be outrageous. Pointing a gun and threatening to shoot is definitely outrageous, even if it's a joke. The guard was licensed, but that doesn't excuse the behavior if it's a harmful prank.

So, the guard intended to cause some fright to his friend, but perhaps he didn't intend any harm to the barber. But the barber's presence was known. So, the guard could have foreseen that someone else present might be affected.

Wait, but IIED requires that the plaintiff was the intended target. Or does it? I think for IIED, the conduct must be directed at the plaintiff. Otherwise, it's a bystander case, which is more about negligent infliction of emotional distress, which has different rules.

Ah, right. So, if the guard was intentionally trying to frighten the friend, but the barber overheard and got distressed, that might not be enough for IIED because the conduct wasn't directed at the barber. Unless the guard intended to cause distress to the barber as well, but the facts don't indicate that. It was a joke on the friend.

So, maybe the barber can't claim IIED because he wasn't the target. Unless the guard's act was so outrageous that it would cause distress to a foreseeable bystander, and he acted recklessly with regard to that.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, if the defendant's actions are so extreme that they go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and they recklessly cause severe emotional distress to another person, even if that person isn't the direct target, could that still be IIED?

I'm not too sure. I think that typically, IIED requires that the conduct be intended to cause distress in the plaintiff. So, if the guard intended to scare the friend, but the barber was just a bystander who happened to get scared, that's more about negligent infliction, which requires that the defendant owed a duty, breached it, causing emotional distress which results in physical harm. But for negligent infliction, some jurisdictions require a physical impact or a close proximity to the event.

Wait, but the guard's action is intentional, not negligent. So, perhaps it's IIED, but only if the guard intended the barber to be distressed. Alternatively, maybe the guard's actions were so reckless as to the barber's presence that it amounts to recklessness as to causing emotional distress.

Let me think about the elements again. For IIED, the conduct must be intentional or reckless. So, if the guard knew the barber was there and could foresee that his actions would cause the barber distress, then maybe he acted recklessly towards the barber.

But the question says the guard knew the barber had a history of heart problems? Wait, no, the question says the guard knew the barber was present and had a history of heart problems? Let me check.

Wait, the question says, "The security guard knew that the barber, an elderly man, had a history of significant heart problems." Oh, okay, so the guard was aware of both the barber's presence and his heart condition. So, he knew that his actions could potentially cause the barber to have a heart attack.

So, if the guard knew the barber was there and had a heart condition, and he still went ahead with this prank, then his actions would be reckless towards the barber. Because he should have known that pointing a gun and shouting like that could cause the barber severe distress, leading to a heart attack.

So, in that case, the guard's conduct was intentional towards the friend, but he was reckless towards the barber. So, for IIED, the conduct is directed at the plaintiff. Wait, but IIED requires that the defendant's conduct was intended to cause emotional distress to the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff was in the zone of danger.

Alternatively, if the guard's actions were so outrageous and he acted recklessly with regard to the barber's well-being, knowing the barber's condition, then perhaps the barber can recover.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: prevail because guard knew barber was present. That's a possible point, but just presence isn't enough. It's more about the intent or recklessness.

Option E: prevail because actions were intentionally frightening and harmful. But the guard intended to frighten the friend, not the barber. So, maybe not.

Option G: prevail because actions were negligent and reckless. Wait, IIED is intentional tort, so not about negligence.

Option H: prevail because caused severe emotional distress. But again, the intent matters.

Option J: not prevail because guard didn't target the barber. That's possible, but the guard knew the barber was there and had a heart condition, so perhaps he should have considered the impact on him.

Wait, the guard's act was intentional towards the friend, but knowing the barber was there and had a heart condition, he might have acted recklessly towards the barber. So, IIED can be based on recklessness if the conduct is outrageous and the defendant knows that it's substantially certain to cause severe distress.

So, if the guard knew the barber had a heart condition and was present, then pointing a gun and threatening could be considered reckless as to the barber's emotional well-being. So, the guard's actions would constitute IIED towards the barber because he acted with reckless disregard towards the barber's known condition, leading to severe distress and heart attack.

So, the barber would prevail because the guard's actions were reckless and outrageous, knowing the barber's condition.

Looking back at the options:

Option E says prevail because actions were intentionally frightening and harmful. But the guard intended to frighten the friend, not the barber. So E might not be the best choice.

Option G says prevail because actions were negligent and reckless. But IIED is intentional, so this might not be correct.

Option H: prevail because caused severe emotional distress. But again, the intent is key.

Option A: prevail because guard knew barber was present. Presence alone isn't enough; the guard must have intended or been reckless towards the barber.

Wait, the correct reasoning is that the guard's actions were intentional towards the friend, but he knew the barber was there and had a heart condition, so he acted recklessly towards the barber, causing severe distress. Therefore, the guard is liable for IIED.

Looking at the options, which one matches this.

Option E is about intentional actions being frightening. But the guard didn't intend to frighten the barber.

Option H is about causing severe distress, but it's not about the guard's intent.

Option A is about knowing the barber was present, but that's only part of the story.

Wait, perhaps option J: not prevail because guard didn't target the barber. But if the guard's actions were reckless towards the barber, then J wouldn't apply. So, the correct answer would be that the barber prevails because the guard's actions were reckless, knowing the barber's condition.

Looking again, option G says "prevail because actions were negligent and reckless." But IIED is intentional, so maybe that's not the right option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the guard's actions were directed towards the friend, but he knew the barber was present and had a heart condition. So, his actions were reckless concerning the barber.

In that case, the barber can recover under IIED because the guard acted recklessly towards him.

So, which option states that? Let's see.

Option E: prevail because actions were intentionally frightening and harmful. No, because the intent was towards the friend.

Option G: prevail because actions were negligent and reckless. Again, IIED is intentional, so this might not fit.

Wait, maybe option H: prevail because caused severe emotional distress. But that's a result, not addressing the intent.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because the guard's actions were intentional and outrageous. Even though directed at the friend, the guard knew the barber was there and had a heart condition, making it reckless towards the barber.

Alternatively, option A: guard knew barber was present. That's a factor, but not the whole story.

Wait, maybe the answer is E. Because the guard's actions were intentional and harmful. Even if directed at the friend, the effect on the barber was foreseeable because the guard knew he had a heart condition. So, the guard's actions were intentional towards the friend but reckless towards the barber, leading to severe distress.

Wait, but IIED requires that the conduct was intended to cause distress to the plaintiff. If the guard didn't intend to cause distress to the barber, but knew he was present and had a heart condition, then his actions could be considered reckless as to the barber, which would satisfy the intent element for IIED because recklessness can sometimes be enough if the conduct is outrageous.

So, the guard's actions were outrageous (pointing a gun and threatening), done recklessly towards the barber, knowing he was present and had a heart condition. Therefore, the barber can recover.

Looking at the options, E says "prevail because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful." But the guard intended to frighten the friend, not the barber.

Wait, perhaps the better answer is A: prevail because the guard knew the barber was present. Because knowing the barber was there, the guard's actions could foreseeably cause distress to him, making the guard's conduct reckless towards the barber, thus satisfying the intent requirement for IIED.

Alternatively, another approach: the guard's actions were so outrageous that they go beyond all bounds of decency, and he acted recklessly towards the barber, knowing of his heart condition. Therefore, the barber can recover.

So, looking at the options, the correct one would be E or A.

Wait, another thought: in some jurisdictions, a bystander can recover for IIED if they were in the zone of danger. But I think that's more for negligent infliction. For IIED, the conduct must be directed at the plaintiff. So, if the guard's actions were directed at the friend, the barber can't recover unless he was also a target.

But in this case, the guard knew the barber was present and had a heart condition, so perhaps he should have known that his actions would cause the barber distress. So, the guard's actions were reckless as to the barber, making him liable for IIED.

So, the answer would be E: prevail because the actions were intentionally frightening and harmful. Wait, but the intent was towards the friend, not the barber.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: because the guard knew the barber was present, so he could foresee the harm, making his actions reckless.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think about the elements again.

The elements for IIED are:

1. Defendant acted intentionally or recklessly.

2. The conduct was extreme and outrageous.

3. The actions caused severe emotional distress.

4. The distress results in physical harm (which it did here).

So, the guard acted recklessly towards the barber because he knew the barber was present and had a heart condition. Therefore, his conduct was reckless, satisfying the first element. The conduct was certainly outrageous.

So, putting it together, the barber should prevail because the guard's actions were reckless and outrageous, causing severe distress. So which option matches that?

Looking back:

Option E: prevail, because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.

Wait, but the guard didn't intend to frighten the barber, only the friend. So, is it intentional or reckless?

In this case, the guard's intent was to frighten the friend, but he was reckless regarding the barber. So, perhaps the guard's actions were reckless as to the barber, which is sufficient for IIED.

So, the correct answer would be E if the actions were intentional towards the barber, but they weren't. So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, no, option E says "intentionally frightening and harmful." Since the guard intended to frighten the friend, but the action was harmful to the barber, perhaps E is correct because the guard's actions were intentional in a way that was harmful, even if not directed at the barber.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is J: not prevail because the guard didn't target the barber. But that can't be right because the guard's recklessness towards the barber should make him liable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me consider another angle. The guard's actions were directed at the friend, but the barber was a foreseeable bystander. So, in some cases, a bystander can recover for IIED if the defendant's actions were outrageous and reckless towards them.

So, in this scenario, because the guard knew the barber was present and had a heart condition, his actions could be considered reckless towards the barber, leading to IIED.

Therefore, the barber would prevail, and the correct option would be E or A.

Wait, looking at the options again:

E: prevail, because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.

Since the guard's actions were intentional towards the friend, but harmful to the barber, perhaps E is the right choice because the actions were intentionally done in a way that was harmful, even if the intent was towards the friend. Alternatively, maybe the guard's actions were so reckless towards the barber's known condition that it's considered intentional infliction.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A because the guard knew the barber was present, making his actions reckless.

I think the correct answer is E because the guard's actions were intentionally done in a manner that was harmful, regardless of the target. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: in the case of IIED, the plaintiff must be the intended target. Since the guard intended to frighten the friend, not the barber, the barber might not have a claim. Unless the guard's actions were so reckless that they were substantially certain to cause distress to the barber, in which case it's IIED.

So, perhaps E is correct because the guard's actions were intentional and harmful, even if directed at the friend. But the barber was a foreseeable victim.

I think I'm going to go with option E: prevail, because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.

The question revolves around whether the barber can recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) caused by the security guard's actions. The guard, aware of the barber's presence and his significant heart problems, pointed a gun at his friend and shouted a threatening statement. This caused the barber to suffer a heart attack. The key issue is whether the guard's actions meet the elements of IIED.

For IIED, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's conduct was intentional or reckless, extreme and outrageous, caused severe emotional distress, and resulted in physical harm. Here, the guard's actions were intentional toward the friend but had a foreseeable impact on the barber, given the guard's knowledge of the barber's heart condition. This makes the guard's actions reckless toward the barber.

While IIED typically requires that the conduct be directed at the plaintiff, the guard's recklessness toward the barber, knowing his condition, satisfies the intent requirement. The guard's actions were outrageous, and the resulting harm to the barber was foreseeable. Therefore, the barber should prevail because the guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful, even if directed at the friend.

The correct answer is:

**E: prevail, because the security guard's actions were intentionally frightening and harmful.**

Answer: E
