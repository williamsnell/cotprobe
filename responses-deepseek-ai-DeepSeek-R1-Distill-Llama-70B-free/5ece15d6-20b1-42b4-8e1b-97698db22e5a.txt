Okay, so I've got this problem here about Ike Waterman and Sean Cole investing in a fast food store. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Ike invested $20,000 and Sean invested $10,000. So their investments are in a 2:1 ratio. Each of them receives 6% of their investment as a share of the profit. Then, the remaining profit is split equally between them. The total profit last year was $10,400. I need to find out each partner's share and see which option matches.

Alright, let's break it down. 

Each partner gets 6% of their investment. So I should calculate 6% of each investment first. 

For Ike: 6% of $20,000. Let me calculate that. 6% is 0.06 in decimal. So 20,000 * 0.06 = $1,200. 

For Sean: 6% of $10,000. That's 10,000 * 0.06 = $600. 

So together, they've taken out $1,200 + $600 = $1,800 from the profit. 

The total profit was $10,400. So the remaining profit to be split equally is 10,400 - 1,800 = $8,600. 

Since this remaining amount is to be split equally, each gets half of it. So each partner gets 8,600 / 2 = $4,300. 

Now, let's find each partner's total share. 

Ike's total share is his 6% ($1,200) plus half of the remaining profit ($4,300). So 1,200 + 4,300 = $5,500. 

Sean's total share is his 6% ($600) plus the other half of the remaining profit ($4,300). So 600 + 4,300 = $4,900. 

So Ike gets $5,500 and Sean gets $4,900. 

Looking at the options, option E says Waterman's share was $5,500 and Cole's was $4,900. So the correct answer should be E. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

- Ike's 6%: 20,000 * 0.06 = 1,200. Correct.
- Sean's 6%: 10,000 * 0.06 = 600. Correct.
- Total taken out: 1,200 + 600 = 1,800. Subtract from 10,400 gives 8,600. Splitting that gives 4,300 each. 
- So Ike: 1,200 + 4,300 = 5,500. Sean: 600 + 4,300 = 4,900. Yep, that's right. 

So option E is the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is E: Waterman's share was $5,500 and Cole's share was $4,900.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate 6% of each partner's investment:**
   - Ike Waterman: \( 20,000 \times 0.06 = 1,200 \)
   - Sean Cole: \( 10,000 \times 0.06 = 600 \)

2. **Total profit allocated as 6% of investments:**
   - \( 1,200 + 600 = 1,800 \)

3. **Remaining profit to be split equally:**
   - Total profit: \( 10,400 \)
   - Remaining profit: \( 10,400 - 1,800 = 8,600 \)
   - Each partner's share of the remaining profit: \( \frac{8,600}{2} = 4,300 \)

4. **Total share for each partner:**
   - Ike: \( 1,200 + 4,300 = 5,500 \)
   - Sean: \( 600 + 4,300 = 4,900 \)

Thus, the correct option is **E**.
