Question:

A 25 g sample of a liquid was heated to 100 °C and then quickly transferred to an insulated container holding 100 g of water at 22 °C. The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 35 °C. Which of the following can be concluded?

Options:

A: The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.
B: The final temperature is greater than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water increased.
C: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.
D: The sample temperature changed less than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.
E: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.
F: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost less heat energy than the water gained.
G: The sample temperature changed less than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be less than the CP of the water.
H: The sample temperature did not change; therefore the sample did not lose any heat energy.
I: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.
J: The final temperature is the same as the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water remained the same.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer between a liquid sample and water. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

Alright, the setup: a 25 g sample of a liquid is heated to 100°C. Then it's quickly moved into an insulated container with 100 g of water at 22°C. After some time, the mixture's temperature is 35°C. I need to figure out what conclusion we can draw from this.

I remember that when two substances exchange heat, the heat lost by the hotter one equals the heat gained by the cooler one, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings because the container is insulated. So the formula is Q = mcΔT for each, right?

Wait, let me think. The sample is hotter than the water, so it will lose heat, and the water will gain heat. The final temperature is somewhere between 100 and 22. In this case, 35 is the final temp. So the sample cools from 100 to 35, a change of 65°C. The water warms from 22 to 35, which is a change of 13°C.

So the sample's temperature changed more. But how does that relate to heat energy? Well, the heat lost by the sample (Q_sample) should equal the heat gained by the water (Q_water), right? Because it's an insulated container, so no heat is lost.

Wait, no, actually, the container is insulated, so the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water. So Q_sample = Q_water. But let's think about the specific heat capacities. The formula is Q = m*c*p*ΔT. So for the sample, Q = m_s * c_s * (T_final - T_initial), but wait, wait, no. Because the sample is cooling, so actually, the change is T_initial - T_final. So Q_sample is m_s * c_s * (100 -35) = 25g * c_s *65. For the water, Q_water is 100g * c_water * (35-22) = 100* c_water *13.

Since Q_sample = Q_water, 25 * c_s *65 = 100 * c_water *13. Let me compute that. 25 *65 is 1625, and 100 *13 is 1300. So 1625 c_s = 1300 c_water. Hmm, so c_s = (1300/1625) c_water. Let's compute that: 1300/1625 is roughly 0.8. So c_s is about 0.8 times c_water. So the sample's specific heat capacity is less than that of water.

But wait, the question is about which conclusion is correct. Let's look at the options.

Option C says the sample's temp changed more, so its c_p is greater. But wait, if the sample's temp dropped more, but it has a smaller mass. So let's think: since the sample's temp change is bigger, but the mass is smaller, how does that affect the heat?

Wait, the sample is 25g, the water is 100g. The sample's temp change is 65, water's is 13. So the sample's heat is 25*65*c_s, water's is 100*13*c_water. Since these are equal, 25*65 c_s = 100*13 c_water → (25/100) * (65/13) c_s = c_water → (0.25)*(5) c_s = c_water → 1.25 c_s = c_water. Wait wait, no, I think I messed up the algebra earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 25 * 65 = 1625. 100 *13=1300. So 1625 c_s =1300 c_water → c_s = (1300/1625) c_water → 1300 ÷ 1625. Let's compute that: 1625 is 25*65, 1300 is 100*13. So 1300/1625 = (100/25)*(13/65) )= 4*(0.2) = 0.8. So c_s = 0.8 c_water. So the sample's c_p is less than water's.

So looking at the options, which ones talk about this. Option G says the sample's temp changed less than water's, so its c_p is less. No, wait, sample's temp change was more. So G isn't correct. Option C says sample's temp changed more, so c_p is greater. But our calculation shows c_p of sample is less than water's. So C is incorrect.

Hmm, then what about the heat exchange? Because the sample's temp changed more, but it's a smaller mass. So the heat lost by sample equals the heat gained by water.

So looking at the options:

Option D: Sample temp changed less than water's, which isn't true, because sample changed 65, water 13. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Sample temp changed more, so sample lost more heat. But no, because heat lost by sample equals heat gained by water. So E is wrong.

Option F: Sample temp changed more, so sample lost less heat than water gained. No, because they're equal. So F is wrong.

Option I: Sample temp changed more, but sample lost same as water gained. Which is correct. Because Q_sample = Q_water. Wait, but wait, no. Because the sample's heat is lost, and water's is gained, so they are equal in magnitude. So yes, I is correct.

Wait, but let's read option I: "The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained." That's correct because Q_sample lost is equal to Q_water gained.

So the correct answer would be I. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

I: The sample temp changed more than the water temp did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained. That's correct.

Wait, but what about option D? Option D says sample temp changed less than water's, but sample lost same as water gained. So that's wrong because sample's temp change was greater.

Other options: Option E says sample lost more, which is wrong. Option F says sample lost less, which is wrong. So I is correct.

To analyze the situation, we consider the heat transfer between the 25 g sample (cooled from 100°C to 35°C) and the 100 g of water (heated from 22°C to 35°C). The insulated container ensures that the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water, i.e., \( Q_{\text{sample}} = Q_{\text{water}} \).

Using the formula \( Q = mc\Delta T \), the heat lost by the sample is:

\[
Q_{\text{sample}} = m_{\text{sample}} \cdot c_{\text{sample}} \cdot (T_{\text{initial, sample}} - T_{\text{final}})
\]

The heat gained by the water is:

\[
Q_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial, water}})
\]

Since \( Q_{\text{sample}} = Q_{\text{water}} \), we equate:

\[
25 \cdot c_{\text{sample}} \cdot 65 = 100 \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot 13
\]

Simplifying:

\[
1625 \cdot c_{\text{sample}} = 1300 \cdot c_{\text{water}}
\]

\[
c_{\text{sample}} = \frac{1300}{1625} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \approx 0.8 \cdot c_{\text{water}}
\]

This shows that the specific heat capacity of the sample is less than that of water.

Next, we evaluate the temperature changes. The sample's temperature changes by \( 100 - 35 = 65 \, ^\circ \text{C} \), while the water's temperature changes by \( 35 - 22 = 13 \, ^\circ \text{C} \). Thus, the sample's temperature changes more than the water's temperature.

Finally, since the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water, the sample loses the same amount of heat energy as the water gains. This aligns with the principle of conservation of energy in an insulated system.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A, B, H, J**: Incorrect because they make false claims about energy conservation or the relationship between temperature changes and energy transfer.
- **C, G**: Incorrect because they misrelate temperature changes to specific heat capacities. The sample's temperature changes more, but its specific heat capacity is actually less than that of water.
- **D**: Incorrect because it claims the sample's temperature changes less than the water's, which is false.
- **E, F**: Incorrect because they misstate the relationship between heat energy and temperature changes. The heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water.
- **I**: Correct. The sample's temperature changes more than the water's, but the heat energy lost by the sample equals the heat energy gained by the water.

### Final Answer:
I
