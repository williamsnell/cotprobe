Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the sale of computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags. In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?

Options:

A: Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.
B: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue, but reverse the decision with respect to the state constitutional issue.
C: Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.
D: Refuse to review the case because the state Supreme Court's decision does not conflict with any federal law or constitutional provision.
E: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.
F: Reverse the decision because the law does not retroactively impair the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags.
G: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the federal constitutional issue.
H: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.
I: Reverse the decision on the grounds that the state law does not violate the contracts clause of the federal Constitution.
J: Reverse the decision because the state law is a reasonable regulation of commerce and does not violate the contracts clauses of the federal and state constitutions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contracts clause question. Let me start by breaking it down.

The state passed a law requiring ink cartridges to be sold in recyclable paper cartons instead of plastic bags. Before the law, 28% were in plastic bags, with 75% of those packaged out-of-state and 25% in-state. The paper industry lobbied hard for this, spending a lot. Environmentalists supported it too because paper is recyclable.

The state Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional under both federal and state contracts clauses. They said it retroactively impairs existing contracts for plastic bag packagers.

Now, the state AG is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review this. The question is how the USSC should rule.

I remember that the Contracts Clause in the Constitution prohibits states from passing laws that impair the obligation of contracts. This applies to both the federal and state levels, I think. But wait, the Contracts Clause in the federal Constitution mainly applies to state laws impairing contracts, and the state's own clause would apply similarly.

The state court held that the law violates both, so the USSC is being asked to review. The options involve whether to affirm, reverse, or refuse review on various grounds.

Option A says refuse review because of adequate and independent state ground. But the USSC can review if there's a federal question involved. Here, the state court's decision was based on both federal and state constitutional grounds. So under the adequate and independent state ground doctrine, if the state decision rests on an independent state ground, USSC can't review. But if the state court also decided a federal issue, then the USSC can review the federal part. In this case, the state court held it unconstitutional under both, but the USSC can still review the federal issue.

Option B: Affirm on federal, reverse state. That doesn't make sense because the state court's decision was based on both. If the USSC affirms on federal, the state issue might not matter. But I'm not sure.

Option C: Reverse on state because federal makes it unnecessary. Hmm, but the state decision was on both, so the USSC could address the federal issue, making the state issue moot. But I don't think that's how it works. The state can have stricter protections, but if the federal issue is decided, perhaps the state doesn't need to address theirs. Not sure.

Option D: Refuse because no conflict with federal law. But the state court's decision was based on federal constitutional grounds, so there's a federal issue to review.

Option E: Affirm on federal and abstain on state. The USSC usually doesn't have to decide state issues if the federal issue is sufficient. So if they affirm on the federal Contracts Clause, they might not need to address the state's. But I'm not certain.

Option F: Reverse because the law doesn't retroactively impair contracts. Wait, the state court said it does. But maybe the USSC would look at whether the law actually impairs existing contracts. If the law only applies prospectively, then it doesn't affect existing contracts. Did the law apply retroactively? The question says the court held it impairs the ability to honor existing contracts. So maybe the USSC would look at whether the law indeed does that. If the law bans the sale in plastic bags going forward, but doesn't affect existing contracts, then maybe it's not an impairment. But if the law immediately prohibits the sale, then companies with contracts to sell in plastic bags would have their contracts impaired. So the USSC would need to assess if the state law substantially impairs contracts and if it's reasonable and necessary.

Option G: Affirm on state, abstain on federal. But the USSC can review the federal issue, so they wouldn't need to abstain. Also, if the state's Contracts Clause is similar, the USSC's ruling on the federal issue would likely influence the state's.

Option H: Affirm on both because state must conform. No, states can have their own constitutions with different protections. So H doesn't seem right.

Option I: Reverse on federal, saying no violation. So the USSC would say the state law doesn't impair contracts under the federal clause.

Option J: Reverse because the law is a reasonable regulation. The Contracts Clause analysis involves whether the law is a reasonable adjustment and serves an important public purpose. If the state's interest in environmental protection is significant, and the means are reasonable, the law might be upheld. But the state court found it impaired contracts, so the USSC might agree or disagree.

Wait, the Contracts Clause isn't as strict as it used to be. The modern approach allows states to regulate contracts if it's a reasonable means to serve an important public purpose, even if it impairs contracts. So in this case, the law is aimed at environmental protection, which is an important public purpose. The question is whether the impairment is reasonable.

If the USSC determines that the state law does not substantially impair existing contracts, or that it's a reasonable regulation, they might reverse the state court's decision. Alternatively, if the law does impair contracts without sufficient justification, it would be struck down.

In the state court's decision, they found it unconstitutional because it impairs existing contracts. The USSC would review whether that's correct. If the law's effective date allows existing contracts to be honored, then no impairment. But if the law is immediate, then it might.

Assuming the law applies to all sales, including those under existing contracts, then it impairs them. So under the Contracts Clause, the state must show a significant and legitimate public purpose and that the means are reasonable.

Here, environmental protection is a significant purpose. The means—switching packaging—might be a reasonable adjustment. So maybe the USSC would find it doesn't violate the Contracts Clause, reversing the state court.

So looking at the options, option I says reverse because it doesn't violate the federal Contracts Clause. Option J says reverse because it's a reasonable regulation and doesn't violate either.

Wait, the question says the state court held it violates both. So the USSC could reverse on the federal ground, which would make the state ground moot. Alternatively, if they reverse on the federal, the state issue isn't necessary.

Alternatively, if the USSC finds that under the federal clause, it's not a violation, then the state's decision on its own clause would still stand unless compelled otherwise.

Wait, but the state's Contracts Clause is similar to the federal. So if the USSC reverses on the federal, the state court's decision on the state clause would also be incorrect, as the analysis is similar. So the USSC would likely reverse both.

Looking back at the options, option I is about reversing on federal. Option J says reverse because the law is a reasonable regulation and doesn't violate either.

Alternatively, considering that the Contracts Clause applies to state laws that impair private contracts, not the other way around. Wait, no, the Contracts Clause applies to the government's impairment, whether state or federal. So the state law can't impair contracts unless it's reasonable and necessary.

In this scenario, the USSC would likely examine whether the state's law has a legitimate public purpose and whether the impairment is reasonable.

Given that the law's purpose is environmental protection, which is a legitimate public purpose, and the means are switching to recyclable paper, which seems reasonable, the USSC might hold that the law does not violate the Contracts Clause. Therefore, the state court's decision was incorrect, and the USSC should reverse.

Looking at the options, option I and J are possibilities. Option I says reverse on federal, option J says reverse because it's a reasonable regulation and doesn't violate either.

Wait, option J says the law is a reasonable regulation and doesn't violate the contracts clauses of both. So the USSC would reverse the state court's decision on both federal and state grounds.

But does the USSC have jurisdiction to review the state constitutional issue? Because the USSC can only review federal issues. So when the state court's decision is based on both federal and state grounds, the USSC can review the federal but not the state. So if the USSC reverses on the federal ground, the state issue becomes moot because the state court's alternative holding (state constitution) would not stand if the federal issue is resolved.

Wait, no. If the state court held the law unconstitutional under both, and the USSC reverses on the federal ground, the state court's decision on the state ground would still stand unless compelled otherwise. But since the state's Contracts Clause is similar, the USSC's ruling on the federal would logically apply to the state's as well.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

When a state court's decision is based on both state and federal grounds, the USSC can review the federal issue. If they reverse on the federal, then the state court must reconsider the state issue in light of that. But if the USSC affirms on the federal, the state issue is independent.

In this case, the USSC is being asked to review. They can decide the federal issue, but not the state. So if they reverse on the federal, the state court's decision on the state issue would still stand unless the USSC's ruling somehow impacts it.

Wait, but the state's Contracts Clause is similar. So if the USSC says the law doesn't violate the federal, then the state court's decision on the state clause would need to be reevaluated because the analysis is the same.

But the USSC can't directly reverse the state court on the state issue. So perhaps the proper approach is for the USSC to reverse on the federal ground, and the state court would then have to revisit the state ground in light of that.

But looking at the options, option I says reverse on federal, but doesn't address the state. So in that case, the state's decision on the state clause would still stand, which would mean the law is still unconstitutional under state law. But that can't be right because the USSC's ruling on the federal issue would mean the state's reasoning on the state issue is flawed.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Another approach: the state court found the law unconstitutional under both. The USSC can only review the federal issue. So if the USSC reverses the federal holding, the state court's decision is no longer supported by the federal ground, but the state ground remains unless the USSC can address it. But they can't, so the state court's state ground would still make the law unconstitutional, so the USSC's reversal on federal wouldn't change the outcome.

But that doesn't make sense because the state's Contracts Clause is similar, so if the USSC says the federal clause isn't violated, the state's likely isn't either.

Alternatively, perhaps the USSC would find that the state law does not violate the federal Contracts Clause, and thus the state court erred in their decision on that point. As for the state constitutional issue, the USSC would typically abstain from deciding state law issues. So they would reverse the state court's decision on the federal issue, leaving the state issue for the state court to reconsider in light of the USSC's ruling.

Looking at the options, option I says reverse on federal, which would make the state court's federal holding wrong. But the state's own holding would still stand unless the state court revisits it.

Alternatively, option J says reverse because the law is a reasonable regulation under both. But the USSC can't decide the state issue. So the proper approach would be to reverse on the federal ground, and perhaps the state court would then follow suit on the state ground.

But the options don't have an option that says that. Option I is just about the federal. So in that case, the correct answer would be I: Reverse the decision on the grounds that the state law does not violate the federal Contracts Clause.

Wait, but the question says the state court's decision was based on both. So when the USSC reverses on the federal, the state court's alternative holding (state clause) would still make the law unconstitutional. So the USSC's reversal wouldn't change the outcome unless they also address the state issue, which they can't. So the correct path would be to reverse on the federal, but the state issue remains. Therefore, the USSC can only reverse on the federal, but the state's decision on the state clause would still stand, making the law unconstitutional on state grounds.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me think of it differently.

The Contracts Clause analysis: the state law must not substantially impair existing contracts unless it's reasonable and necessary for an important public purpose.

The state court found that the law retroactively impairs contracts, so it's unconstitutional. The USSC would examine this.

If the USSC decides that the law does not impair contracts, or that the impairment is justified, they would reverse the state court on the federal issue.

So the options are either I or J. Option I is about reversing on federal, J is about reversing on both.

But USSC can't rule on the state's constitution, only the federal. So the correct answer would be I: reverse because it doesn't violate the federal Contracts Clause.

But wait, the state's Contracts Clause is similar. So if the USSC rules it doesn't violate the federal, the state court's decision on the state clause would be incorrect as well, but the USSC can't tell the state court that. So the state law could still be unconstitutional under the state clause.

Hmm, but this seems like a trick. The USSC would reverse the state court on the federal issue, but the state court's decision on the state issue stands, making the law still unconstitutional. So the USSC's reversal wouldn't change the outcome, which would be an odd result.

Alternatively, perhaps the USSC's ruling on the federal issue would indirectly affect the state issue, but they can't force the state court to change their state ruling.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the USSC can only review the federal issue. So the correct answer is I: reverse because the law doesn't violate the federal Contracts Clause. The state issue isn't for the USSC to decide.

So the answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the U.S. Supreme Court (USSC) should reverse, affirm, or refuse to review a state Supreme Court decision that held a state law unconstitutional under both federal and state Contracts Clauses. The law in question prohibits the sale of computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags, requiring recyclable paper cartons instead. The state court found that the law retroactively impairs existing contracts for plastic bag packagers, violating both the federal and state Contracts Clauses.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Refuse review due to an adequate and independent state ground.  
   This is incorrect because the USSC can review federal constitutional issues even when a state court decision rests on both federal and state grounds. The federal question here is sufficient for USSC review.

2. **Option B**: Affirm on federal, reverse on state.  
   This is unlikely because the state court's decision was based on both federal and state grounds. If the USSC affirms on the federal issue, the state issue would remain as an independent ground for the decision.

3. **Option C**: Reverse on state because the federal holding makes it unnecessary.  
   This is incorrect because the USSC cannot directly reverse the state court's decision on state constitutional grounds. The USSC can only address the federal issue.

4. **Option D**: Refuse review due to no conflict with federal law.  
   This is incorrect because the state court's decision explicitly turned on federal constitutional grounds, creating a federal issue for the USSC to review.

5. **Option E**: Affirm on federal and abstain on state.  
   This is incorrect because the USSC can review the federal issue but does not need to abstain from it. The state issue is not before the USSC for decision.

6. **Option F**: Reverse because the law does not retroactively impair contracts.  
   This is incorrect because the state court found that the law does impair existing contracts. The USSC would need to assess whether the impairment is substantial and whether the law is a reasonable regulation.

7. **Option G**: Affirm on state and abstain on federal.  
   This is incorrect because the USSC cannot affirm or decide state constitutional issues. Its role is limited to reviewing federal issues.

8. **Option H**: Affirm on both because the state constitution must conform to the federal.  
   This is incorrect because state constitutions can provide greater protections than the federal Constitution. The USSC cannot compel state constitutions to conform to federal standards.

9. **Option I**: Reverse on federal because the law does not violate the federal Contracts Clause.  
   This is the correct answer. The USSC can review the federal issue and would likely find that the law does not violate the federal Contracts Clause. The law serves a legitimate public purpose (environmental protection) and the means (switching to recyclable paper) are reasonable. The USSC would reverse the state court's federal holding, leaving the state constitutional issue for the state court to reconsider in light of the USSC's ruling.

10. **Option J**: Reverse because the law is a reasonable regulation and does not violate either Contracts Clause.  
    This is incorrect because the USSC cannot directly address the state constitutional issue. It can only review the federal issue.

### Conclusion:
The USSC should reverse the state court's decision on the federal Contracts Clause grounds because the law does not violate the federal Constitution. The state constitutional issue is not within the USSC's jurisdiction to decide and would remain for the state court to reconsider.
