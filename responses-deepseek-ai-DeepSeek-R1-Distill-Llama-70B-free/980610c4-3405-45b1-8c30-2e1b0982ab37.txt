Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about resistors and power dissipation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says a resistor is dissipating energy at 1 W. Then the voltage across it is doubled, and I need to find the new power. The options are A to I, with G being 4 W. Wait, how does voltage relate to power in a resistor?

Oh right, power in a resistor is given by P = V²/R. So initially, the power is 1 W. Let's call that P1. When the voltage is doubled, the new voltage is 2V, and the new power P2 would be (2V)^2 / R.

Let me calculate that. (2V)^2 is 4V². So P2 is 4V²/R. But P1 was V²/R, which is 1 W. So P2 is 4 times P1, which was 1 W. So 4 * 1 W = 4 W. So the new power should be 4 W.

Wait, is there another formula I should consider? Like P=I²R or P=IV? Well, since the question is about changing voltage, maybe it's easier to stick with P = V²/R.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of current, using P=IV. If voltage doubles, current would also double (since I=V/R), so the new power would be (2I)*(2V) = 4IV. Since IV was the original power (1 W), yes, that's 4 times as much. So same result.

So the correct answer should be G: 4 W.

The power dissipated by a resistor is given by the formula \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), where \( V \) is the voltage across the resistor and \( R \) is its resistance. Initially, the power is \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{W} \). When the voltage is doubled, the new voltage becomes \( 2V \), and the new power becomes:

\[
P_2 = \frac{(2V)^2}{R} = \frac{4V^2}{R}.
\]

Since \( P_1 = \frac{V^2}{R} = 1 \, \text{W} \), it follows that \( P_2 = 4 \cdot P_1 = 4 \cdot 1 \, \text{W} = 4 \, \text{W} \).

Thus, the new rate of energy dissipation is \( 4 \, \text{W} \).
