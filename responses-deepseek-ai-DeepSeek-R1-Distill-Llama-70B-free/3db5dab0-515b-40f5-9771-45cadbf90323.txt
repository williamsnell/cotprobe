Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this auditing question. The question is about tests of details and specifically detecting the overstatement of sales. Hmm, I remember that tests of details are more substantive procedures, meaning they're looking for actual errors or fraud in the accounts.

The objective here is to find if sales are overstatement. So, overstatement of sales would mean that the company is reporting higher sales than they actually made. That could happen if, for example, they record sales that didn't happen or record them before they actually occurred.

I need to think about the audit procedures related to sales. Auditors often trace transactions through the accounting system to make sure everything is recorded properly. So the question is about the direction in which the auditor should trace the transactions.

Let me think about the flow of a sales transaction. A customer places an order (purchase order), the company ships the goods (shipping documents), which triggers the billing, and then the customer pays, which gets recorded in the cash receipts journal.

If the auditor wants to check for overstatement, they might want to see if all the sales recorded actually have a corresponding shipment. Because if a sale is recorded but nothing was shipped, that's a problem.

Wait, another angle: the auditor could start from the sales journal and see if each sale has a corresponding shipping document. Or maybe start from the shipping documents and see if they were recorded as sales.

Wait, overstatement could happen if sales are recorded without actual shipments. So the auditor might want to verify that every sale has a corresponding shipment. That makes sense because if a sale is recorded without a shipment, it's an overstatement.

So the process would be to take sales entries from the sales journal and make sure each one has a matching shipping document. That would prevent recording sales that didn't happen yet or that weren't actually shipped.

Alternatively, if they start from the shipping documents, they can check if all shipments have been recorded as sales. That could help detect understatement, but the question is about overstatement, so we're more concerned with sales that aren't backed by shipments.

Looking at the options:

A: Customer's purchase orders to the sales journal. That would check if orders are properly recorded as sales, but maybe not directly about shipment.

B: Shipping docs to cash receipts. That's about making sure shipments lead to cash, which is more about receivables and cash being accurate.

C: Cash receipts to shipping. That's verifying that cash received is for actual shipments, so that's about verifying cash against shipments, which might help detect if cash was received without a shipment (maybe fake sales), but not directly about overstatement.

D: Sales journal to cash receipts. That's checking if sales are matched with cash, ensuring that every sale has a payment. But if a sale is recorded without a shipment, the cash might not come, so this could find that. But maybe not the most direct approach.

E: Sales journal to shipping docs. So, for each sale in the journal, check if there's a shipping document. That makes sense because if a sale is recorded without a shipment, that's an overstatement.

F: Shipping to sales journal. That would check if all shipments are recorded as sales, which is more about understatement.

G: Purchase orders to cash receipts. Maybe checking the order to payment, but not directly about shipment.

H: Cash receipts to purchase orders. That's ensuring that payments are for actual orders, which is about verifying the cash but not directly the shipment.

I: Shipping to customer's orders. That makes sure shipments are based on actual orders, which is good, but again, maybe not directly about overstatement of sales.

J: Purchase orders to shipping. That would check if orders are shipped, which is about whether the company is filling orders, but not directly about sales being overstated.

So the best option seems to be E: Sales journal to shipping documents. Because if you start with the sales journal, you can verify each sale has a corresponding shipment, ensuring that the sale wasn't recorded without actually shipping the goods.

Wait, but another thought: when auditing for overstatement, another approach is to test for completeness and occurrence. So, occurrence means that the transaction actually occurred. For sales, occurrence would mean that the sale was realâ€”goods were shipped. So by tracing sales to shipping documents, the auditor can confirm that each sale was for a real shipment.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is E.

To detect the overstatement of sales, the auditor needs to verify that recorded sales are supported by actual shipments. Overstatement occurs when sales are recorded without corresponding shipments, and tracing transactions from the sales journal to the shipping documents ensures that each sale is backed by a valid shipment. This approach directly addresses the risk of overstatement by confirming that sales entries are genuine and not prematurely or fictitiously recorded.

- **Option A**: Tracing from customer purchase orders to the sales journal verifies that orders are properly recorded as sales but does not directly address shipment.
- **Option B**: Tracing from shipping documents to the cash receipts journal focuses on ensuring cash is received for shipments, which is more about receivables accuracy.
- **Option C**: Tracing from cash receipts to shipping documents verifies that cash received is for actual shipments, which helps detect unauthorized cash entries but not overstatement of sales.
- **Option D**: Tracing from the sales journal to cash receipts ensures sales are matched with payments, but this does not directly confirm that shipments occurred.
- **Option E**: Tracing from the sales journal to shipping documents directly verifies that each sale is supported by a shipment, effectively detecting overstatement.
- **Option F**: Tracing from shipping documents to the sales journal ensures all shipments are recorded as sales, which is more relevant for detecting understatement.
- **Option G**: Tracing from customer purchase orders to cash receipts focuses on verifying payments for orders, not shipment.
- **Option H**: Tracing from cash receipts to customer purchase orders ensures payments are for actual orders but does not address shipment.
- **Option I**: Tracing from shipping documents to customer purchase orders verifies shipments are based on orders but does not directly address overstatement of sales.
- **Option J**: Tracing from customer purchase orders to shipping documents checks if orders are fulfilled but does not directly verify sales accuracy.

The most appropriate approach is **Option E**, as it directly links sales entries to shipping documents, ensuring that sales are not overstated by recording transactions without actual shipments.
