Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Berkeley synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about calculating the percentage increase in the proton's mass due to relativistic effects. Right, so it's a relativity problem involving mass increase at high speeds.

Wait, the problem gives the kinetic energy as 5.4 × 10^-11 J and the speed as about 2 × 10^8 m/s. But wait, maybe I should just use the speed since calculating with kinetic energy might be more involved. Oh, but wait, the kinetic energy given might be the relativistic kinetic energy. Hmm, but the problem says that the relativistic mass increase is important, so I'll need to consider relativistic effects.

I remember that the relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The percentage increase in mass would be (gamma * m_rest - m_rest)/m_rest * 100%, which simplifies to (gamma - 1) * 100%.

So first, I need to find gamma using the given velocity. Let me jot down the numbers. The speed v is 2e8 m/s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 2e8 / 3e8 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Wait, let me compute v squared: (0.6667)^2 = 0.4444. Then, v²/c² is 0.4444. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556.

Taking the square root of 0.5556. Hmm, sqrt(0.5556)... Let me think. The square of 0.745 is about 0.555 because 0.7^2 is 0.49, 0.75^2 is 0.5625. Oh wait, 0.745^2 is (0.74)^2 is 0.5476, and 0.746^2 is 0.5569. So, sqrt(0.5556) is approximately 0.745.

So gamma is 1 divided by 0.745. Let's compute that. 1/0.7 is about 1.428, but since it's 0.745, which is a bit higher than 0.7, the result will be a bit less than 1.428. Let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 0.745 * 1.34 = Let's see: 0.7 * 1.34 is 0.938, 0.045 * 1.34 is about 0.0603, so total 0.938 + 0.0603 = 0.9983. So 0.745 * 1.34 ≈ 0.9983, which is close to 1. So 1/0.745 is approximately 1.34.

So gamma is about 1.34. Therefore, the mass increases by (gamma -1)*100% = (0.34)*100% = 34% increase.

Looking back at the options, option B is 34%, so the answer should be B.

To calculate the percentage increase in the proton's mass due to relativistic effects, we use the Lorentz factor, γ, which is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Here, the proton's speed \( v \) is \( 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and the speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). First, compute \( \frac{v}{c} \):

\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{2 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667
\]

Next, calculate \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.6667)^2 = 0.4444
\]

Now, compute \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{0.5556} \approx 0.745
\]

Thus, the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.745} \approx 1.34
\]

The percentage increase in mass is given by:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = (\gamma - 1) \times 100\%
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 1.34 \):

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = (1.34 - 1) \times 100\% = 0.34 \times 100\% = 34\%
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: 34%**.
