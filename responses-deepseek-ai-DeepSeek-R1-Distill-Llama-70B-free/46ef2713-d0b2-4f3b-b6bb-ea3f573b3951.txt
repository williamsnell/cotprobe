Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which art movement abandoned the idea of making traditional, saleable art objects. The question gives me ten options, from A to J, each representing a different art movement. Let me think through each one step by step.

First, I should probably recall what each movement was about. Let's start from the top.

Option A is Surrealists. Surrealism, if I remember correctly, focused on exploring the subconscious and the world of dreams. They used a lot of fantastical imagery. But did they stop making traditional art? I think they still created paintings, sculptures, etc., so maybe not the ones who abandoned saleable objects.

Option B: Futurists. Futurism was all about speed, technology, and the future. They often depicted movement and dynamism in their art. Again, they were creating art that was saleable, like paintings and sculptures, so probably not the answer here.

Option C: Cubists. Cubism, led by Picasso and Braque, broke objects into geometric shapes and multiple perspectives. Their works were still considered art objects and were sold, so I don't think they're the ones who abandoned this.

Option D: Pop artists. Pop art was about popular culture, consumerism. They used images from ads, comics, etc. But they made objects like prints, paintings, and sculptures that were definitely for sale, so not this one.

Option E: Realists. Realism focused on accurate and detailed depiction of life. They were making art for sale as well, so no.

Option F: Abstract Expressionists. This movement focused on the process of creating art, using techniques like dripping or splashing paint. Their works were still considered traditional art objects, like large canvases, so they were saleable. Not the answer.

Option G: Conceptual artists. Conceptual art emphasizes the idea or concept behind the work over the actual physical object. I think some conceptual artists moved away from creating traditional art objects, focusing more on the idea, maybe using language or other non-traditional forms. So this could be a possibility.

Option H: Impressionists. Impressionism was about capturing light and color in outdoor settings. They painted on canvases, so their works were traditional and saleable.

Option I: Dadaists. Dada was a reaction against traditional art and the chaos of war. They used found objects, made collages, and questioned what art is. Marcel Duchamp's readymades, like a urinal, come to mind. Dadaists definitely challenged the notion of traditional art objects, often creating works that were more about provocation than saleability.

Option J: Fauvists. Fauvism used bold colors and energetic brushstrokes. They still created paintings, so they were making traditional art objects.

Now, considering the options, both G (Conceptual) and I (Dada) seem possible. But the question is about abandoning the intention to make traditional, saleable art. Dadaists were more about rejecting traditional art forms and embracing the irrational, often creating non-traditional pieces. Conceptual art also moved away from the object, but perhaps more so focused on the idea. However, the question is about the intention to make saleable objects. Dada's aim was to challenge what art is, so they probably didn't care about making objects for sale. Conceptual artists too, but maybe more in the sense of valuing the idea over the object.

Wait, the question is about abandoning the intention. So which movement was more about that? I think Dadaists were the ones who really rejected traditional art and its commercial aspects. They wanted to break away from the art market and its conventions, so they didn't make art with the intention to sell. Similarly, conceptual artists might have, but maybe the more direct answer is Dada.

Alternatively, the question could be pointing towards Conceptual artists because they emphasized the concept over the object, which might mean they didn't intend to make saleable objects as much. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, another angle: the question says "the intention of making traditional, saleable art objects was abandoned." So which movement did not intend to create art that's traditional and saleable.

Dada and Conceptual both did that, but maybe Dada was the first to do so. Let me think about the timeline. Dada started around WWI, early 20th century. Conceptual art came later, in the 60s and 70s. So the question is about which movement abandoned that intention.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the intention... was abandoned by", so it's looking for the movement that decided not to make traditional, saleable objects anymore.

Dadaists used found objects and questioned what is art, so they didn't intend to make traditional art for sale. Conceptual artists focused on ideas, so their art might not be traditional objects either. But I'm not sure which is the better fit.

Wait, another thought: The Dada movement often created art that was anti-art, like Duchamp's "Fountain," which was a urinal submitted to an exhibition. They were making statements against the commercialization of art, so they definitely didn't have the intention to create saleable objects.

So, putting it together, I think the answer is either I: Dadaists or G: Conceptual artists. But the question is about who abandoned the intention. I'm leaning towards Dada because they were more about rejecting the art market and traditional objects, while Conceptual might have been more about the idea over the object, but perhaps still within the art market.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "abandoned the intention of making traditional, saleable art objects." So maybe it's Conceptual artists because they focused on the idea rather than the object, making the objects themselves less important or not necessary. So their intention was not to make traditional objects for sale.

Hmm. I'm a bit split here. But looking back, Dada was more about rejecting the art as a commodity, so they didn't intend to make saleable objects. Conceptual artists might have made non-saleable works, but perhaps they were still part of the art market in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G: Conceptual artists. Because in conceptual art, the art is the idea, and the physical object is secondary or unnecessary. So they abandoned the intention to make traditional objects for sale because the idea was more important.

Wait, but the question is about abandoning the intention to make saleable objects. So whether they made saleable objects or not might depend on whether they still produced physical works. Dadaists did make objects, but they were more about challenging the status quo. Conceptual artists sometimes didn't produce objects at all, or the objects were minimal.

I think the answer is I: Dadaists. Because they were the ones who rejected traditional art and its commercial aspects, so they didn't intend to make saleable objects. Conceptual artists came later and took it further, but the question is asking which movement abandoned that intention.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe both, but the options don't allow that. Let me try to think of key examples.

Dada: They made art that was provocative, like collages and ready-mades, not necessarily for sale. They were against the commercialization of art.

Conceptual: The emphasis was on the idea, so sometimes the art was just a document or a statement, not a physical object to be sold.

In that sense, both movements moved away from traditional saleable objects. But the question is about which one abandoned the intention.

I think the more correct answer is Dadaists because they were the first to challenge the notion of art as a commodity. Conceptual artists took it further, but perhaps the question is pointing to Dada.

The question asks which art movement abandoned the intention of making traditional, saleable art objects. To determine the answer, each option is analyzed based on its core principles and practices:

- **A: Surrealists**: Focused on exploring the subconscious and dreams, but still created traditional art like paintings and sculptures that were saleable.  
- **B: Futurists**: Celebrated speed, technology, and the future, producing dynamic art that was still saleable.  
- **C: Cubists**: Revolutionized art by breaking objects into geometric shapes, but their works were still traditional and saleable.  
- **D: Pop artists**: Explored consumer culture using images from advertising and comics, creating art that was highly saleable.  
- **E: Realists**: Focused on detailed depictions of life, producing art that was traditional and saleable.  
- **F: Abstract Expressionists**: Emphasized the process of art-making, but their large canvases were still traditional and saleable.  
- **G: Conceptual artists**: Prioritized the idea over the physical object, often minimizing or eliminating the traditional art object. This movement moved away from creating saleable objects, focusing instead on the conceptual.  
- **H: Impressionists**: Captured light and color in outdoor settings, producing traditional paintings that were saleable.  
- **I: Dadaists**: Rejected traditional art forms and the commercialization of art, creating provocative works like readymades (e.g., Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain") that challenged the notion of art as a commodity. They abandoned the intention to make traditional, saleable art objects.  
- **J: Fauvists**: Known for bold colors and energetic brushstrokes, but still produced traditional paintings that were saleable.  

Both **G: Conceptual artists** and **I: Dadaists** seem plausible because they challenged traditional notions of art and its commercial aspects. However, the Dadaists were the first to explicitly reject the idea of art as a saleable commodity, making them the more direct answer to the question. While Conceptual artists further developed this idea, the Dadaists are more closely associated with abandoning the intention to create traditional, saleable art objects.
