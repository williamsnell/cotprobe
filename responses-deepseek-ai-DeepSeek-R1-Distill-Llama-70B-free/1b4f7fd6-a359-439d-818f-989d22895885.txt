Okay, so I have this question about how many ribs a human has. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I remember learning about it in biology class. Let me think. I think the ribcage is part of the skeletal system, right? And ribs are those bones that protect the heart and lungs.

Wait, I recall that humans have a certain number of ribs, and I think it's in the twenties. Oh wait, wasn't there something about some people having an extra rib? Like a cervical rib or something? But I think that's not the usual case.

So normally, how many? I think it's 12 pairs, making 24 in total. Because each side of the chest has 12 ribs. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me double-check in my mind. The ribs are attached to the spine in the back and the sternum in the front. The first few are connected directly, and the rest are connected via cartilage.

Wait, but I also remember that sometimes people might have a variation, like an extra rib, but the standard answer is 24. So looking at the options, option B is 24. So the answer should be B.

Another way to think about it: the thoracic vertebrae are 12, and each has two ribs, so 12x2=24. Yeah, that makes sense. So I'm pretty confident it's 24 ribs in total.

The human body typically has 24 ribs, which are arranged into 12 pairs. Each pair corresponds to the 12 thoracic vertebrae, with one rib on each side of the spine. While some individuals may have an extra rib (a cervical rib), the standard number is 24. Among the given options, B: 24 is the correct answer.

Answer: B
