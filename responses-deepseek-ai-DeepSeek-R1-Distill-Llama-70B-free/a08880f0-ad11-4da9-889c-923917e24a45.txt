Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options is an example of devolution. I remember from my studies that devolution has to do with the transfer of power from a central government to a lower level, like states or local governments. So it's about decentralization, right? Let me think about each option carefully.

Option A says allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets. Hmm. So the federal government sets the target, but the states choose how to achieve it. That sounds like giving some power to the states, so maybe that's devolution. Because the federal government is letting states handle the implementation part.

Option B is the federal government setting a minimum wage that all states must meet. That sounds more like a centralized decision. The federal government is making a rule that the states have to follow without any flexibility. So this is probably not devolution.

Option C is a state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard that's more stringent than federal. Wait, that's the opposite of devolution. The federal government is stopping the state from doing something stricter, so the state has less power. That's more like preemption, where the federal government overrides state laws.

Option D talks about a race to the bottom where states compete by having fewer regulations. I'm not sure how this directly relates to devolution. I think a race to the bottom is more about competition and could happen without devolution, like if states lower standards on their own. Not sure if that's an example of devolution itself.

Option E is a state forced to comply with federal immigration policies. That's the federal government exerting its authority, so the state has less power. Not devolution.

Option F is the federal government setting nationwide educational standards. Again, that's centralizing control, like Common Core maybe. So this is the opposite of devolution.

Option G is a state implementing stricter gun control than federal laws. Wait, can states do that? I think they can if the federal law doesn't preempt them. So this is an example of state power beyond federal, but is that devolution? Because devolution is about transferring power from federal to state. So if the federal government allows states to set stricter laws, that could be devolution. But I'm not certain if this is an example of devolution or just state autonomy.

Option H is a state decriminalizing drug use against federal law. That's more about conflict between state and federal, but I don't think it's devolution. Devolution would involve the federal government giving power, not the state taking it unilaterally.

Option I is a state legalizing marijuana contrary to federal law. Similar to H, this is about state action against federal, but not necessarily devolution. Because devolution implies the federal government intentionally transferring authority.

Option J is the federal government overriding a state's decision on same-sex marriage. That's clearly not devolution; it's the opposite, central authority asserting control.

Going back to the options, A seems to fit because the federal government sets the target but allows states to decide how to meet it. So the implementation is devolved to the states. That makes sense. Another example I can think of is when the federal government gives block grants to states to handle certain programs, allowing them to decide how to spend the money.

Wait, but what about Option G? If the federal government has certain gun laws, and a state makes theirs stricter, is that devolution? Or is that just state authority? Because devolution is about the federal government giving power, not the state taking more. So if the federal government allows states to set higher standards, that's devolution. Like, for example, some environmental laws where states can have stricter rules. So in that case, Option G would be an example of devolution as well. Wait, but the question is which is an example, so maybe both A and G are possible.

Wait, but Option G says the state is choosing stricter laws than federal. So if the federal government doesn't set a floor but allows states to go beyond, that could be devolution. However, the question is about which option is an example of devolution. So perhaps both A and G are correct, but looking at the options, I need to choose the best answer. Wait, no, the options are singular.

Wait, the question is asking for an example of devolution. So which one fits better. Option A is about the federal government setting a target and letting states decide implementation. That's a clear transfer of authority from federal to state in terms of how to achieve the goal. Option G is more about states adding their own regulations beyond federal, which may or may not be an example of devolution depending on whether the federal government allows it or not. For example, in the US, states can have stricter laws than federal in some areas, but that's more about the absence of federal preemption rather than active devolution.

So between A and G, A seems more directly an example of devolution because the federal government is allowing states to decide the methods to meet a federal mandate. That's transferring the implementation authority to the states.

To determine which option is an example of devolution, it is important to understand that devolution involves the transfer of power or authority from a central government to a lower level, such as states or local governments. This typically allows states to have more autonomy in decision-making or implementation.

- **Option A**: Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets is a clear example of devolution. The federal government sets the overall goal, but the implementation details are left to the states, demonstrating a transfer of authority.
- **Option B**: The federal government setting a minimum wage that all states must meet is not devolution, as it centralizes control without granting states flexibility.
- **Option C**: A state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard stricter than federal standards is the opposite of devolution, as it involves the federal government limiting state authority.
- **Option D**: A "race to the bottom" describes competition among states to reduce regulations but does not directly exemplify devolution.
- **Option E**: A state being forced to comply with federal immigration policies is not devolution, as it involves the federal government asserting its authority over states.
- **Option F**: The federal government establishing nationwide educational standards is centralization, not devolution.
- **Option G**: A state implementing stricter gun control laws than federal mandates could involve state autonomy but is not necessarily an example of devolution unless the federal government explicitly allows states to set stricter standards.
- **Option H**: A state decriminalizing drug use contrary to federal law is an example of state action conflicting with federal law, not devolution.
- **Option I**: A state legalizing marijuana contrary to federal law is similar to Option H, involving state autonomy but not devolution.
- **Option J**: The federal government overriding a state's decision on same-sex marriage is the opposite of devolution.

The best example of devolution is **Option A**, as it directly involves the federal government transferring authority to states to decide how to meet a federal mandate.
