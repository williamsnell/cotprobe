Question:

During spring break, a private boarding school was deserted while students and teachers were away on vacation. A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.
B: denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.
C: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to test the substance.
D: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.
E: granted, because the student was not present during the search.
F: granted, because the student's room is considered private property.
G: denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.
H: denied, because the discovery of the substance was incidental to the counselor's actions.
I: denied, because the school has a policy allowing searches of student rooms.
J: denied, because the counselor had a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule. Hmm, let's break it down.

The scenario is about a boarding school where a guidance counselor is staying during spring break. He enters a student's room, looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he finds an expensive suitcase. Inside, there's an express mail envelope. He opens it and finds a white powder, which he thinks is heroin. He calls the police, who come and take the envelope to the station. They test it without a warrant, and it's heroin. The student is arrested, and now his attorney is trying to suppress the evidence.

The question is whether the motion to suppress will be granted or denied. The options are A through J.

So, the main issue here is whether the evidence (the heroin) was obtained legally. If the police violated the Fourth Amendment by seizing or searching without a warrant, then the evidence might be suppressed.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, the government generally needs a warrant to conduct a search or seizure, unless an exception applies. But here, the counselor is a private individual, not a government actor. The Fourth Amendment only protects against government action, not private searches. So if a private citizen finds something illegal and hands it over to the police, the police don't need a warrant because the private search isn't governed by the Fourth Amendment.

Wait, but in this case, the counselor is a school employee. Does that make him a state actor? Hmm, I'm not sure. But in some cases, school officials can be considered state actors, especially in the context of students. For example, in New Jersey v. T.L.O., school officials were treated as government actors when conducting searches. But here, the counselor wasn't acting in his official capacity; he was committing a crime (breaking and entering, theft). So perhaps his actions are considered private.

So, if the counselor was acting on his own, illegally, then the evidence he found might still be admissible because it's a private search. The police didn't participate in the search, so they don't need a warrant. The key here is the "private search" exception. The police can take evidence that a private citizen finds without a warrant, as long as the police didn't encourage or assist in the illegal search.

In this case, the counselor was rummaging through the room on his own. He found the envelope, opened it, saw the powder, and called the police. The officer then took the envelope to the station and tested it. Since the initial search was done by a private individual, the police didn't need a warrant to seize the envelope. They just took what was already found.

So the student's attorney is arguing that the evidence should be suppressed because the police didn't get a warrant. But if the police didn't need a warrant because it was a private search, then the motion to suppress would be denied.

Looking at the options:

Option G says: denied because the search was conducted by a private party.

That seems to fit. Because the counselor was a private individual, even if he was a school employee, since he was acting outside his official duties (stealing), his actions were private. So the police didn't need a warrant, and the evidence isn't suppressed.

Wait, but what about the officer opening the envelope at the station? They sent a sample to the lab. Does that require a warrant? Well, once the police have lawfully seized the envelope, they can open it if they have probable cause. Since the counselor told them it was heroin, that's probably enough for probable cause. So testing it wouldn't require a separate warrant.

So the main issue is the initial seizure. Since the counselor was a private party, the evidence isn't excluded.

So the answer should be G: denied because the search was conducted by a private party.

The motion to suppress the heroin will most likely be denied because the search was conducted by a private party. The guidance counselor, although a school employee, was acting outside his official duties and for personal gain, making his actions those of a private individual. Under the Fourth Amendment, evidence obtained by private searches is generally admissible because the amendment only protects against government action. The police did not need a warrant to seize the envelope since they were not involved in the initial search. Once in possession of the envelope, they had probable cause to test its contents. Therefore, the evidence is not subject to suppression.

Answer: G
