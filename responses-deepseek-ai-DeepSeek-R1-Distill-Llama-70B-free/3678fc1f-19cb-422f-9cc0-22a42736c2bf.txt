Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the average film heat transfer coefficient on the water side of a heat exchanger. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that water enters at 61.4°F and leaves at 69.9°F. The tube diameter is 0.902 inches, and the average velocity is 7 ft/sec. I need to find the film coefficient, h. The options are from A to J, all in Btu/hr-ft²-°F units.

Wait, I remember that the film coefficient can be found using the correlation for forced convection in tubes. Oh right, the Dittus-Boelter equation is commonly used for that. The equation is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33, where Nu is the Nusselt number, Re is the Reynolds number, and Pr is the Prandtl number.

But wait, I need to calculate Re and Pr for water at the given conditions. Let me think about the properties of water. Since the temperature of water is changing from about 61°F to 70°F, the average temperature would be around 65.6°F. I should probably use the properties at this average temperature.

So, first, I'll need the density, viscosity, specific heat, and thermal conductivity of water at 65.6°F. I don't remember the exact values, but I think I can approximate them. Let's see:

- Density (ρ) of water around 60°F is about 62.4 lbm/ft³. Wait, no, that's at 60°F. Let me check: at 70°F, it's around 62.3 lbm/ft³, so maybe 62.3 lbm/ft³ is a good average. Or perhaps I should interpolate between 60 and 70. Hmm, maybe I can just take it as approximately 62 lbm/ft³.

- Viscosity (μ) at 60°F is about 2.54 lbm/(ft·hr), and at 70°F it's around 2.05. So maybe around 2.3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, viscosity decreases with temperature. So at 60°F, it's higher than at 70°F. Let me think again. I think at 60°F, μ is about 2.55 centiPoise. Oh wait, centiPoise is 0.01 Poise. Wait, but in the unit system I'm using, I need to convert it correctly. One Poise is 1 dyne·s/cm². To convert to lbm/(ft·hr), I think 1 Poise is approximately 0.0672 lbm/(ft·hr). So centiPoise is 0.0672 / 100 = 0.000672 lbm/(ft·hr). So at 60°F, water's viscosity is about 2.55 cP, so 2.55 * 0.000672 = 0.001716 lbm/(ft·hr). Similarly, at 70°F, it's about 2.05 cP, so 2.05 * 0.000672 = 0.001378 lbm/(ft·hr). So the average might be around 0.00155 lbm/(ft·hr). Alternatively, perhaps I should take the value at the average temperature. Let's say 65.6°F is roughly 18°C, so maybe the viscosity is about 1.1 cP? Wait, no, that's lower than that. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Maybe I should look up the exact value, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed with an approximation. Let me take μ as 0.00135 lbm/(ft·hr) at around 65°F. That sounds reasonable.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the temperature of the water to find the properties. Since the water is flowing through the tube, the film temperature is probably the average of the inlet and outlet. So average temp T_avg = (61.4 + 69.9)/2 = 65.65°F, which is about 18.6°C. So, looking up water properties at 18.6°C:

- Density (ρ) is approximately 998 kg/m³, which is about 62.3 lbm/ft³ (since 1 kg/m³ ≈ 0.0624 lbm/ft³).

- Viscosity (μ) is about 1.12 mPa·s, which is 1.12 cP. So converting that, 1 cP is 0.000672 lbm/(ft·hr), so 1.12 * 0.000672 ≈ 0.00153 lbm/(ft·hr).

- Specific heat (c_p) is about 4.182 kJ/kg·K, which is 1 Btu/lbm·°F (since 1 kJ/kg·K ≈ 0.23885 Btu/lbm·°F, so 4.182 * 0.23885 ≈ 1.0 Btu/lbm·°F).

- Thermal conductivity (k) is about 0.606 W/m·K, which is 0.606 / 0.14422789 (since 1 W/m·K ≈ 0.14422789 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F)). So 0.606 / 0.14422789 ≈ 4.2 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, wait, let me check the conversion again. Alternatively, I remember that the thermal conductivity of water around 20°C is about 0.00194 cal/cm·s·°C, but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's about 0.379 W/m·K? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for exact values, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the numbers I have.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise approach. Let me tabulate the properties:

At 65.65°F = 18.6°C:

- Density ρ ≈ 62.3 lbm/ft³ (since 1 ft³ = 28,316.85 cm³, and 1 kg/m³ is 1 g/cm³, so 62.4 lbm/ft³ is correct for water).

- Viscosity μ ≈ 1.12 cP → 0.00112 * 0.000672 lbm/(ft·hr) → 0.000753 lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, wait, no: 1 cP is 0.01 Poise, and 1 Poise is 0.0672 lbm/(ft·hr). So 1 cP = 0.000672 lbm/(ft·hr). So 1.12 cP → 1.12 * 0.000672 = 0.00075264 lbm/(ft·hr).

- Specific heat c_p = 4.182 kJ/kg·K → convert to Btu/lbm·°F: 1 kJ/kg·K = 0.23885 Btu/lbm·°F, so 4.182 * 0.23885 ≈ 1.0 Btu/lbm·°F. So c_p ≈ 1.0 Btu/lbm·°F.

- Thermal conductivity k: I think at 20°C, it's about 0.597 W/m·K. To convert to Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F), I can use the conversion factor. Let's see: 1 W/m·K = 0.57782 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So 0.597 W/m·K → 0.597 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.345 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, but that seems low. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the value in Btu/hr·ft·°F per foot. Wait, maybe I'm getting the units wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the Dittus-Boelter equation and plug in the numbers.

Now, the Dittus-Boelter equation is:

Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33

Where:
- Nu = Nusselt number = (h * D) / k
- Re = Reynolds number = (D * v * ρ) / μ
- Pr = Prandtl number = (c_p * μ) / k

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exponents. The Dittus-Boelter equation sometimes uses Pr^0.3 when the fluid is heating, but since the water is being heated here (from 61.4 to 69.9°F), it's the same side as the heat transfer, so perhaps it's Pr^0.3. Alternatively, maybe it's Pr^0.33 regardless. I'll stick with the original equation I wrote: Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33.

So, first I need to calculate Re.

Re = (D * v * ρ) / μ

But wait, the units must be consistent. Let's make sure all units are in compatible units.

Given:
- D is 0.902 inches. I should convert that to feet because the velocity is in ft/s. So 0.902 inches = 0.902 / 12 = 0.0751667 ft.

- v is 7 ft/s.

- ρ is 62.3 lbm/ft³.

- μ is 0.00075264 lbm/(ft·hr).

Wait, but wait, the units for Re are:

Re = (ft * ft/s * lbm/ft³) / (lbm/(ft·hr)) ) → Let me check the units.

Breaking it down:

Numerator: D (ft) * v (ft/s) * ρ (lbm/ft³) → (ft) * (ft/s) * (lbm/ft³) = (ft²/s) * (lbm/ft³) = (lbm·ft²)/(ft³·s) ) = lbm/(ft·s).

Denominator: μ (lbm/(ft·hr)) → lbm/(ft·hr).

So Re's units become (lbm/(ft·s)) / (lbm/(ft·hr)) ) = (1/s) / (1/hr) ) = hr/s = 3600, since 1 hr = 3600 s. So the units would be dimensionless, as expected.

So, Re = (0.0751667 ft) * 7 ft/s * 62.3 lbm/ft³ / 0.00075264 lbm/(ft·hr)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute D*v: 0.0751667 * 7 = 0.5261669 ft²/s.

Then multiply by ρ: 0.5261669 * 62.3 ≈ 32.79 lbm/(ft·s).

Then divide by μ: 32.79 / 0.00075264 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 32.79 / 0.00075264 ≈ Let me compute 32.79 / 0.00075 ≈ 43,720 (since 0.00075 * 43,466 ≈ 32.7). So approximately 43,700. Let's say Re ≈ 43,700.

Hmm, that seems a bit high, but okay. Now, let's compute Pr = (c_p * μ) / k.

Wait, c_p is in Btu/lbm·°F, μ is lbm/(ft·hr), and k is in Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, let me check the units for Pr.

Pr = (c_p [Btu/lbm·°F] * μ [lbm/(ft·hr)]) ) / (k [Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F)] )

Let me see the units:

Numerator: Btu/(lbm·°F) * lbm/(ft·hr) ) → Btu/(ft·hr·°F)

Denominator: Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F) → Btu/(ft·hr·°F) * in/ft → since in/ft is 1/12.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the numbers.

So, Pr = (c_p * μ) / k.

c_p is 1.0 Btu/lbm·°F.

μ is 0.00075264 lbm/(ft·hr).

k is 0.345 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, no, earlier I thought k was 0.597 W/m·K, which converted to 0.345 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Hmm, but I'm not confident about that. Let me double-check the conversion.

Wait, 1 W/m·K = 0.57782 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So if k is 0.597 W/m·K, then in Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F) units, k = 0.597 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.345.

So, plugging in:

Pr = (1.0 * 0.00075264) / 0.345 → 0.00075264 / 0.345 ≈ 0.00218.

Wait, that can't be right. Prandtl number for water is usually around 7 or so at room temperature, but maybe at higher temps it's lower. Wait, no, wait, if the water is being heated, maybe it's higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it again.

Pr = (c_p * μ) / k → (1.0 Btu/lbm·°F * 0.00075264 lbm/(ft·hr)) ) / (0.345 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F)).

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor due to unit conversion. Let me think about the units again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the thermal conductivity in the same unit system as the other variables. Let me check: k is in W/m·K, but I need it in Btu/(hr·ft·°F) or something similar.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: use all properties in SI units, calculate Pr, then proceed.

Let me try that.

In SI units:

c_p = 4182 J/kg·K (since 1 Btu ≈ 1055.06 J, so 1 Btu/lbm·°F * 1055.06 J/Btu / 1000 lm·kg/L → wait, this might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the SI units for the properties.

Wait, perhaps I should convert all the properties to SI units:

- ρ = 998 kg/m³ (since 62.3 lbm/ft³ ≈ 998 kg/m³).

- μ = 1.12 mPa·s = 0.00112 Pa·s.

- c_p = 4182 J/kg·K.

- k = 0.597 W/m·K.

Now, compute Pr in SI units:

Pr = (c_p * μ) / k → (4182 J/kg·K * 0.00112 Pa·s) / 0.597 W/m·K.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², Pa is kg/(m·s²), so Pa·s is kg/(m·s²) * s = kg/(m·s).

So numerator: J/kg·K * Pa·s → (kg·m²/s²)/(kg·K) * (kg/(m·s)) ) → (m²/s²)/(K) * kg/(m·s) → m²/(s²·K) * kg/(m·s) → kg·m/(s³·K).

Denominator: W/m·K = (J/s)/m·K = (kg·m²/s³)/m·K → kg·m/(s³·K).

So Pr has units of (kg·m/(s³·K)) / (kg·m/(s³·K)) ) → dimensionless, which is correct.

Now, compute the value:

Pr = (4182 * 0.00112) / 0.597 → (4182 * 0.00112) = ?

4182 * 0.001 = 4.182, 4182 * 0.00012 = 0.50244 → total ≈ 4.182 + 0.50244 = 4.68444.

So Pr ≈ 4.68444 / 0.597 ≈ 7.85.

Ah, that makes more sense. So Pr ≈ 7.85.

Now, Re in SI units:

Re = (D * v * ρ) / μ.

But let me compute it in SI units.

D = 0.902 inches = 0.902 * 0.0254 m ≈ 0.0229 m.

v = 7 ft/s = 7 * 0.3048 m/s ≈ 2.1336 m/s.

ρ = 998 kg/m³.

μ = 0.00112 Pa·s.

So,

Re = (0.0229 m * 2.1336 m/s * 998 kg/m³) / 0.00112 Pa·s.

Compute numerator: 0.0229 * 2.1336 ≈ 0.0488, 0.0488 * 998 ≈ 48.77.

So numerator ≈ 48.77 kg/(m·s²) (since Pa = kg/(m·s²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each part:

Re = (D * v * ρ) / μ → (0.0229 m) * (2.1336 m/s) * (998 kg/m³) / 0.00112 Pa·s.

Compute numerator: 0.0229 * 2.1336 = 0.0488, 0.0488 * 998 ≈ 48.77.

So numerator is 48.77 (unit: m·m/s·kg/m³ → m²·kg/(s·m³) → kg/(m·s)).

Denominator: 0.00112 Pa·s = 0.00112 kg/(m·s²) * s = 0.00112 kg/(m·s).

So Re = (48.77 kg/(m·s)) / (0.00112 kg/(m·s)) ) ≈ 48.77
