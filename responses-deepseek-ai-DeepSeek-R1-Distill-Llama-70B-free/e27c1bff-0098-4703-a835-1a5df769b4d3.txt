Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, Lisa's business has some days with profits and some with losses, and I need to find the total profit or loss over these four days. Let's see... 

So, the days are Monday to Thursday. On Monday, there's a loss of $14. Loss means her business is in the negative, right? So that's like subtracting from the total. Then Tuesday, she made a profit of $18. That's a positive number, so that adds to the total. Wednesday, another loss of $6. And Thursday, a profit of $7.

Hmm, I think I need to add up all these amounts, treating losses as negative numbers. So let me list them out:

Monday: -$14
Tuesday: +$18
Wednesday: -$6
Thursday: +$7

Now, I'll add them together step by step. Starting with Monday, the total is -14. Then Tuesday's profit would add 18 to that. So -14 + 18 equals 4. Okay, so after Tuesday, she's up by $4.

Next is Wednesday's loss. So I subtract 6 from the current total of 4. That gives me 4 - 6 = -2. Hmm, so now she's at a loss of $2 after Wednesday.

Then comes Thursday's profit of 7. Adding that to -2, we get -2 +7 = 5. So the total is a profit of $5. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me add them all at once: (-14) +18 + (-6) +7. Let me compute that step by step.

First, -14 +18 is 4. Then, 4 + (-6) is -2. Then, -2 +7 is 5. Yep, that's correct. So the total is a $5 profit.

Looking at the options, option G is $5 profit. So the answer should be G.

The total profit or loss is calculated by summing the daily profits and losses:

- Monday: -$14  
- Tuesday: +$18  
- Wednesday: -$6  
- Thursday: +$7  

Adding these together:  
\[
-14 + 18 - 6 + 7 = 5
\]  

The total result is a **$5 profit**.  

**Answer: G**
