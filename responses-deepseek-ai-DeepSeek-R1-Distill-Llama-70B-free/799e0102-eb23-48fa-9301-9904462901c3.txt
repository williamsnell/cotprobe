Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the resistivity of copper. The given data is that a copper wire is 2500 cm long and has a diameter of 0.90 cm. The resistance is 0.67 ohms at 20°C. They're asking for the resistivity, and there are multiple choices provided.

Hmm, I remember that resistivity is a material property, and it's related to resistance, length, and cross-sectional area. Oh right, the formula is R = ρ * (L/A), where R is resistance, ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is the cross-sectional area.

So I need to rearrange this formula to solve for ρ. That would be ρ = R * A / L.

First, let's note down all the given values:
- Length (L) = 2500 cm. Oh wait, but in the formula, the units have to be consistent. Wait, resistivity is usually in ohm-meters, but since the other units are in cm, maybe I can work in cm and then convert later. Or maybe the answer is in ohm-cm, which is one of the options.

Wait, the options are in ohm-cm, so I might not need to convert units at all. Let me think.

The wire's diameter is 0.90 cm, so the radius is half of that, which is 0.45 cm.

The cross-sectional area A is πr². So A = π*(0.45 cm)^2.

Calculating that: 0.45 squared is 0.2025 cm², times π is approximately 0.6369 cm².

Wait, let's compute it accurately. 0.45^2 = 0.2025. Multiply by π (3.1416) gives about 0.2025 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.63612 cm². Let's just keep it as 0.636 cm² for now.

So R is given as 0.67 ohms. So plugging into the formula ρ = (R * A) / L.

So ρ = (0.67 ohms * 0.636 cm²) / 2500 cm.

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.67 * 0.636. Let's do 0.67 * 0.6 = 0.402, and 0.67 * 0.036 = 0.02412. So adding them gives 0.402 + 0.02412 = 0.42612 ohm·cm².

Wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, 0.67 * 0.636 is more accurately calculated as:

0.67 * 0.636 = ?

Let me compute 0.67 * 600 = 402, but wait 0.636 is 636 * 1e-3. So perhaps it's better to compute 0.67 * 0.636.

0.67 * 0.6 is 0.402. 0.67 * 0.03 is 0.0201. 0.67 * 0.006 is 0.00402. Adding those together: 0.402 + 0.0201 = 0.4221, plus 0.00402 gives 0.42612. So yes, 0.42612.

Now, divide that by 2500 cm. So 0.42612 / 2500 = ?

Let me compute that. 0.42612 / 2500 equals approximately 0.000170448 ohm·cm.

Wait, that's 1.70448e-4 ohm·cm, which can be written as 1.7 × 10^-4 ohm·cm.

But looking at the options, they're in the order of 1e-6. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Ah, wait a second. Oh no, I think I messed up the units. Because resistivity is usually expressed in ohm-meters, and 1 ohm-meter is 1e4 ohm-cm. Wait, let me think.

Wait, 1 ohm-meter is 1 ohm·m. Since 1 m is 100 cm, 1 ohm·m = 1 ohm * (100 cm)^2 / (100 cm) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of unit conversion.

The formula R = ρ L / A.

So the unit for ρ is R * A / L. R is in ohms, A is in cm², L in cm.

So ρ has units of ohm·cm² / cm = ohm·cm.

So 0.67 ohms * 0.636 cm² / 2500 cm gives 0.42612 / 2500 = 0.000170448 ohm·cm.

Wait, but the known resistivity of copper is around 1.7e-8 ohm·m. Let me convert that to ohm·cm to see.

1.7e-8 ohm·m equals 1.7e-8 * 100 ohm·cm (since 1 m=100 cm). So 1.7e-6 ohm·cm.

Ah! So 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So looking at the options, option E is 1.7e-6. But wait, my calculation gave 1.7e-4, which is higher.

Wait, that's a problem. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the area. Let me check that again.

Diameter is 0.90 cm, so radius is 0.45 cm.

Area A = πr² = π*(0.45)^2 = π*(0.2025) ≈ 0.63612 cm². That seems right.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is wrong. Wait, the formula is R = ρ L / A, so ρ = R A / L.

Wait, wait, no. Oh no! Wait, no, the formula is R = (ρ L) / A → ρ = (R A) / L.

So yes, that's correct.

So R is 0.67 ohms, A is 0.636 cm², L is 2500 cm.

So (0.67 * 0.636) = 0.42612. Dividing by 2500 → 0.42612 /2500 = 0.000170448 ohm·cm.

Wait, 0.000170448 is 1.70448e-4 ohm·cm, which is 1.7e-4, which is much higher than the known resistivity of copper (which is about 1.7e-8 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm). So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for length. Because in the formula, L is in meters when ρ is in ohm·meter, but in this case, all units are in cm. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the area.

Wait, let me re-calculate the area accurately. Let's compute A = π*(d/2)^2.

d = 0.90 cm, so r = 0.45 cm.

r squared is 0.2025 cm². Multiply by π: 0.2025 * π ≈ 0.2025 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.63612 cm².

Wait, maybe I should compute it with more precision.

3.1415926535 * 0.2025 = ?

Let me compute 0.2 * 3.1415926535 = 0.6283185.

0.0025 * 3.1415926535 = 0.00785398.

Adding together: 0.6283185 + 0.00785398 = 0.63617248 cm².

So A is approximately 0.63617 cm².

So R*A is 0.67 ohms * 0.63617 cm² = ?

0.67 * 0.63617 = Let's compute:

0.6 * 0.63617 = 0.381702.

0.07 * 0.63617 = 0.0445319.

Adding them: 0.381702 + 0.0445319 = 0.4262339.

So 0.4262339 ohm·cm².

Divide that by L, which is 2500 cm:

0.4262339 / 2500 = ?

Let me compute that. 0.4262339 divided by 2500.

0.4262339 / 2500 → well, 2500 is 2.5e3, so 0.4262339 / 2.5e3 = (0.4262339 / 2.5) * 1e-3.

0.4262339 / 2.5 = let's compute that.

2.5 goes into 4 once (2.5*1=2.5), subtract 4-2.5=1.5. Bring down 2: 15. 2.5 goes into 15 six times (2.5*6=15). So 0.4262339 /2.5 = 0.17049356.

So 0.17049356 * 1e-3 = 0.00017049356 ohm·cm.

Which is 1.7049356e-4 ohm·cm.

Wait, that's 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, but as I thought earlier, the known resistivity of copper is around 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. There's a discrepancy here. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula for resistivity. Oh wait! The formula is R = (ρ * L) / A → ρ = (R * A) / L. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the units are mixed. Oh wait, the length is given in cm, but in the formula, it should be in meters if we're using SI units. Or wait, no—because all units are in cm, so the ohm·cm unit would be correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the area should be in square meters. Let me try to compute everything in meters to see.

Length L = 2500 cm = 25 meters.

Diameter d = 0.90 cm = 0.009 m. So radius r = 0.0045 m.

Area A = π r² = π * (0.0045)^2 = π * 0.00002025 m² ≈ 6.3725e-5 m².

R is 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = (R * A) / L = (0.67 ohms * 6.3725e-5 m²) / 25 m.

Compute numerator: 0.67 * 6.3725e-5 = ?

0.67 * 6.3725e-5 = approximately 4.2698e-5 ohm·m².

Divide by 25 m: 4.2698e-5 /25 = 1.7079e-6 ohm·m.

Which is 1.708e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.708e-6 * 100 ohm·cm = 1.708e-4 ohm·cm.

Wait, but that brings me back to the same number, 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. But that's not matching the known resistivity of copper.

Wait, that's confusing. Because I'm getting 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, but I know copper's resistivity is around 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents when converting from cm to m. Let me try that again.

Wait, when computing in meters:

L is 25 m.

A is π*(0.0045)^2 = π*0.00002025 = 6.3725e-5 m².

So R=0.67 ohms.

ρ = (0.67 * 6.3725e-5) / 25.

Compute numerator: 0.67 * 6.3725e-5 = 0.0000426 ohm·m².

Wait, 0.67 *6.3725e-5 → let me compute it accurately.

6.3725e-5 = 0.000063725.

0.67 * 0.000063725 = 0.00004268625.

So numerator is 0.00004268625 ohm·m².

Divide by 25 m: 0.00004268625 /25 = 0.00000170745 ohm·m.

Which is 1.70745e-6 ohm·m.

Ah! Now this makes sense. Because 1.7e-6 ohm·m is the correct order of magnitude for copper's resistivity.

But wait, the question asks for the resistivity in ohm·cm. Since 1 ohm·m = 100 ohm·cm, so 1.7e-6 ohm·m equals 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. No, wait, wait. No, wait, 1 ohm·meter is 1 ohm·m = (1 ohm) * (1 m) / (1 m) )? Wait, no.

Wait, the unit conversion: 1 ohm·m = 1 ohm * m / m²? Wait, no. Let me think.

Oh wait, resistivity's SI unit is ohm·meter (Ω·m). So 1 ohm·meter is equal to 100 ohm·centimeters because 1 meter is 100 centimeters. So to convert from ohm·m to ohm·cm, you multiply by 100.

So 1.7e-6 ohm·m * 100 = 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. So that's 0.00017 ohm·cm.

But looking at the options, option E is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm, and option A is 1.9e-6, etc.

Wait, but in my calculation using meters, I get 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-4 ohm·cm.

But wait, the question asks for the resistivity in ohm·cm. So if my calculation in meters gives me 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, but the known resistivity is 1.7e-8 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the area again.

Wait, when L is 25 meters, and A is 6.3725e-5 m².

R is 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = (R * A) / L → 0.67 *6.3725e-5 /25.

0.67 *6.3725e-5 = 0.67 * 0.000063725 = 0.00004268625.

Divide by 25 → 0.00004268625 /25 = 0.00000170745 ohm·m.

Which is 1.70745e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which equals 1.7e-4 ohm·cm.

Wait, but that's 0.00017 ohm·cm, which is 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. But none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are in the 1e-6 range.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, R = (ρ L) / A → ρ = (R A) / L.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a resistivity of 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which is correct. But in ohm·cm, that's 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, which is 0.00017 ohm·cm. But the options don't have that. The options are like 1.7e-6.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let me compute A again.

r = 0.45 cm → 0.0045 m.

Area A = π (0.0045)^2 = π * 0.00002025 m².

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating the resistivity.

Wait, another approach: let's compute everything in cm.

L = 2500 cm.

r = 0.45 cm.

A = π*(0.45)^2 = 0.63612 cm².

R = 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = (R * A) / L → (0.67 * 0.63612) / 2500.

0.67 * 0.63612 = 0.42612.

0.42612 /2500 = 0.000170448 ohm·cm.

Which is 1.70448e-4 ohm·cm.

So that's 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, which is 0.00017 ohm·cm.

But the known resistivity of copper is about 1.7e-8 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So I'm getting a value 100 times larger than expected. That suggests I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a second! Oh no, wait. When I converted from ohm·m to ohm·cm, I think I messed up.

Wait, 1 ohm·meter is equal to 100 ohm·cm. Because 1 m = 100 cm. So 1 ohm·m = 1 ohm * (100 cm) / (1 cm^2/m^2? No, wait, perhaps better to think in terms of unit conversion.

Wait, the formula is ρ = R * A / L.

If I compute everything in cm, then the unit is ohm·cm.

Alternatively, computing everything in meters gives ohm·meters.

So in my earlier calculation,
