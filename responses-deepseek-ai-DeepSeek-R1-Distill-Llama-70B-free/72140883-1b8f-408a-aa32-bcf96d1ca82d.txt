Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Golden couple who need to borrow $18,000 for 20 years at 6% interest. I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but I think I remember something about the present value of an annuity or something like that. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to find the monthly payment they have to make. Hmm, I remember that the formula for the monthly payment (PMT) on a loan is based on the present value of an ordinary annuity. The formula is something like PMT = PV / [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where PV is the present value (the loan amount), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

Wait, let me make sure. The present value of an ordinary annuity formula is indeed PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]. But since we're solving for PMT, we rearrange it to PMT = PV * [r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)].

Right, so let's plug in the numbers. The PV here is $18,000. The interest rate is 6% annually, but since we're calculating monthly payments, I need to convert that to a monthly rate. So 6% divided by 12 months. 6 divided by 12 is 0.5%, or 0.005 in decimal.

The term is 20 years, so how many months is that? 20 times 12 is 240 months. So n is 240.

So plugging in the numbers:

PMT = 18,000 * [0.005 / (1 - (1 + 0.005)^-240)]

Wait, let's compute the denominator first. (1 + 0.005)^240 is the same as (1.005)^240. I think I need to calculate 1.005 raised to the 240th power. Hmm, I might need a calculator for that, but since I don't have one, maybe I can approximate or remember that (1 + r)^n can be calculated using the formula for compound interest.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 1 divided by (1.005)^240, because it's (1.005)^-240.

Wait, the denominator in the formula is (1 - (1.005)^-240). Let's compute (1.005)^240 first. 

I remember that (1.005)^240 is approximately e^(0.005*240) because for small r, (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn). But wait, 0.005 * 240 is 1.2, so e^1.2 is about 3.32. But wait, that's an approximation. The actual value of (1.005)^240 is about 3.262. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, I think I remember that (1.005)^240 is roughly 3.22 or something. Maybe I should use a more precise method.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the rule of 72 to estimate, but that might not be precise enough. Alternatively, I can think that after 20 years at 6%, the factor would be higher. Let me try to compute 1.005^240 step by step, but that's tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or something, but without a calculator, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a standard present value factor for 6% over 240 months. I think the present value factor (PVIFA) for 6% over 20 years (240 months) is a known value. I remember that the PVIFA can be calculated as [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r.

So in this case, PVIFA = [1 - (1.005)^-240] / 0.005.

If I can find this factor, then I can multiply it by the PV to get the PMT. Wait, no, wait. The formula is PMT = PV * [r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)], which is the same as PV / PVIFA.

So perhaps I should look up the PVIFA for 240 periods at 6%. Alternatively, maybe I can find an approximate value. I think the PVIFA for 6% over 20 years is around 97.24 or something. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

Wait, the present value interest factor of an annuity (PVIFA) for r=0.005 and n=240 is [1 - (1.005)^-240]/0.005.

Let me compute (1.005)^240. Let me try to compute it step by step. Let's compute ln(1.005) first. ln(1.005) is approximately 0.004975. Then multiply by 240: 0.004975 * 240 ≈ 1.194. So e^1.194 is approximately e^1.2, which is about 3.32. So (1.005)^240 ≈ e^1.194 ≈ 3.28. So 1/(1.005)^240 ≈ 1/3.28 ≈ 0.305.

So 1 - 0.305 is 0.695. Then, divide by 0.005: 0.695 / 0.005 = 139. So PVIFA is approximately 139.

Wait, that can't be right because when I look up PVIFA tables, for 6% over 20 years, the factor is about 98. So perhaps my approximation is off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's compute (1.005)^240 more accurately. Let's compute it as (1.005)^12 = 1.061678 (since (1.005)^12 is roughly 1.0617). Then, for 20 years, that's (1.0617)^20. Let me compute that.

We can compute (1.0617)^20. Let me take natural logs again. ln(1.0617) is approximately 0.0599. Multiply by 20: 0.0599 *20=1.198. So e^1.198 is about 3.31. So (1.0617)^20 ≈ 3.31. Wait, but that's (1.005)^240, which is the same as (1.005^12)^20 = (1.0617)^20 ≈3.31. So 1/(1.005)^240 is 1/3.31 ≈0.3024.

So 1 - 0.3024 = 0.6976. Then, 0.6976 / 0.005 = 139.52. So PVIFA is approximately 139.52.

Wait, but I think the actual PVIFA for 6% over 20 years is about 98. So perhaps my method is wrong. Oh wait, wait a minute, I think I'm confusing annual and monthly rates. Let me clarify.

Wait, the annual interest rate is 6%, so the monthly rate is 0.06/12 = 0.005, that's correct. The number of periods is 240, that's correct. So the PVIFA should be [1 - (1 + 0.005)^-240]/0.005.

If I calculate (1.005)^240 more accurately, perhaps I can find a better approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest to compute it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute (1.005)^240.

We can compute it as (1.005)^12 = 1.061678.

So (1.061678)^20.

Compute (1.061678)^10 first.

(1.061678)^2 ≈ 1.1268.

(1.1268)^2 ≈ 1.2702 (approx).

So (1.061678)^4 ≈1.2702.

Then, (1.2702)^2 ≈1.6157.

So (1.061678)^8 ≈1.6157.

Then, (1.6157)^2 ≈2.6103.

So (1.061678)^16 ≈2.6103.

Now, to compute (1.061678)^20, we have (1.061678)^16 * (1.061678)^4.

We have (1.061678)^16 ≈2.6103, and (1.061678)^4≈1.2702.

So 2.6103 * 1.2702 ≈ 3.319.

So (1.005)^240≈3.319.

Thus, (1.005)^-240≈1/3.319≈0.3012.

So 1 - 0.3012 =0.6988.

Divide by 0.005: 0.6988/0.005=139.76.

So the PVIFA is approximately 139.76.

So then, the monthly payment PMT is PV / PVIFA = 18,000 / 139.76 ≈ let's compute that.

18,000 divided by 140 is approximately 128.57. But since 139.76 is a bit less than 140, the result will be a bit higher than 128.57.

Let me compute 18,000 / 139.76.

Let's see: 139.76 * 128 = ?

139.76 * 100 =13,976.

139.76 * 28 = let's compute 139.76 *20=2,795.2, 139.76*8=1,118.08. So total 2,795.2+1,118.08=3,913.28.

So 100+28=128: 13,976 + 3,913.28=17,889.28.

So 139.76 *128=17,889.28, which is less than 18,000.

The difference is 18,000 -17,889.28=110.72.

So how many more dollars do we need to add to 128 to get to the correct PMT?

Each additional dollar adds 139.76 to the product. So 110.72 /139.76≈0.792.

So PMT≈128 + 0.792 ≈128.792, which is approximately $128.79.

Looking at the options, option B is $128.96, which is very close. So perhaps my approximation is a bit off, but the correct answer should be around $128.96.

Wait, maybe I should do a more precise calculation. Let me compute 18,000 divided by 139.76.

18,000 ÷ 139.76.

Let me write this as 18000 ÷ 139.76.

Let me compute 139.76 * 128 = 17,889.28 as before.

The remaining is 18,000 -17,889.28=110.72.

Now, 139.76 * x =110.72.

x=110.72 /139.76 ≈0.7916.

So total is 128.7916, which is approximately $128.79.

But the option B is $128.96, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps my approximation of (1.005)^240 was a bit off. Maybe the actual value is a bit higher, leading to a slightly lower PVIFA, thus a slightly higher PMT.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (1.005)^240 more accurately. Let me try using a better approximation method.

Let me compute (1.005)^240 using logarithms.

ln(1.005) = 0.004979.

So ln((1.005)^240) =240 * 0.004979=1.19416.

e^1.19416 = ?

We know that e^1=2.71828, e^1.1≈2.71828 * e^0.1≈2.71828 *1.10517≈3.004.

e^1.2≈3.3201.

So 1.19416 is 0.00584 less than 1.2.

So e^(1.2 -0.00584)= e^1.2 * e^(-0.00584).

e^1.2≈3.3201.

e^-0.00584≈1 -0.00584 + (0.00584)^2/2 ≈0.99416 + 0.000017≈0.994177.

So e^1.19416≈3.3201 * 0.994177≈3.3201 *0.994177.

Compute 3.3201 *0.994177:

3 *0.994177=2.98253.

0.3201 *0.994177≈0.3182.

So total≈2.98253 +0.3182≈3.3007.

So (1.005)^240≈3.3007.

Thus, (1.005)^-240≈1/3.3007≈0.3030.

So 1 -0.3030=0.6970.

Divide by 0.005: 0.6970/0.005=139.4.

So PVIFA≈139.4.

So PMT=18,000 /139.4≈?

18,000 ÷139.4.

Let me compute 139.4 *128=17,827.2.

18,000 -17,827.2=172.8.

172.8 ÷139.4≈1.24.

So PMT≈128 +1.24=129.24.

Hmm, but earlier I had 128.79. Now I'm getting around 129.24. The actual precise calculation would give a more accurate result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula with a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for monthly payments. The formula is:

PMT = (P * r * (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

Where P is the loan amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

So plugging in the numbers:

P = $18,000

r = 0.06/12 = 0.005

n = 20*12=240

So PMT = (18,000 * 0.005 * (1.005)^240) / ((1.005)^240 -1 )

We already computed (1.005)^240≈3.3007.

So numerator: 18,000 *0.005 *3.3007 =18,000 *0.0165035=18,000 *0.0165035.

Compute 18,000 *0.0165035:

0.0165035 *10,000=165.035

0.0165035*8,000=132.028

Wait, 18,000=10,000 +8,000.

So 165.035 +132.028=297.063.

So numerator is 297.063.

Denominator: 3.3007 -1=2.3007.

So PMT=297.063 /2.3007≈?

Compute 297.063 ÷2.3007.

Let me see: 2.3007 *129=?

2.3007 *100=230.07

2.3007 *20=46.014

2.3007 *9=20.7063

So 100+20+9=129.

So 230.07 +46.014=276.084 +20.7063=296.7903.

So 2.3007*129≈296.7903.

But numerator is 297.063.

So 297.063 -296.7903≈0.2727.

So 0.2727 /2.3007≈0.1184.

So total PMT≈129 +0.1184≈129.1184, so approximately $129.12.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option B: $128.96.

Wait, perhaps my approximation of (1.005)^240 as 3.3007 is a bit off. Let me check more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better method. Let me compute (1.005)^240:

We can compute it as (1.005)^12 = approx 1.0616778.

Then, (1.0616778)^20.

Compute (1.0616778)^10 first.

(1.0616778)^2 = approx 1.0616778 *1.0616778.

Let me compute that:

1.0616778 *1.0616778 = ?

1 *1 =1.

1 *0.0616778=0.0616778.

0.0616778 *1=0.0616778.

0.0616778 *0.0616778≈0.0038.

So adding up: 1 +0.0616778 +0.0616778 +0.0038≈1.1271556.

So (1.0616778)^2 ≈1.1271556.

Now, (1.1271556)^2 = approx 1.27023.

So (1.0616778)^4≈1.27023.

Then, (1.27023)^5=?

Well, let's compute (1.27023)^2= approx 1.61293.

Then, (1.61293)^2= approx 2.60435.

So (1.27023)^4≈2.60435.

Then, (1.27023)^5=2.60435 *1.27023≈3.309.

So (1.0616778)^10≈3.309.

Wait, but we're computing (1.0616778)^20, so square that: (3.309)^2≈10.947.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier we had (1.005)^240≈3.3, but this approach is giving (1.0616778)^20≈10.947, which would imply (1.005)^240≈10.947, which contradicts earlier calculations. Wait, no, because (1.0616778)^20 is (1.005)^240, so if (1.0616778)^20≈10.947, that would mean (1.005)^240≈10.947, which is way higher than the earlier estimate of ~3.3. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let's clarify: (1.005)^12 is 1.0616778, correct. So (1.0616778)^20 is (1.005)^(12*20)= (1.005)^240,
