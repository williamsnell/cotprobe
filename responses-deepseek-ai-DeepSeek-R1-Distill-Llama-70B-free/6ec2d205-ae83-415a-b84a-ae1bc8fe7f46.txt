Okay, so I have this problem about calculating partial pressures of gases in a compressed air tank. Hmm, I remember that partial pressure is related to the mole fraction and total pressure. Let me think about the details.

The question says that dry air is compressed to 10.0 atmospheres. The composition is 78.1% nitrogen, 20.9% oxygen, and 1% other gases. I need to find the partial pressures of each.

Wait, right, partial pressure is calculated by multiplying the mole fraction by the total pressure. Since it's by volume, I can assume ideal gas behavior, so mole fraction equals volume fraction.

So for nitrogen, the mole fraction is 0.781. Multiply that by the total pressure of 10 atm. Let's calculate that: 0.781 * 10 = 7.81 atm.

Oxygen's mole fraction is 0.209. So 0.209 *10 = 2.09 atm.

Other gases are 0.01, so 0.01 *10 = 0.1 atm.

Now I look at the options to see which matches these numbers. Let's see each option:

Option J says P_N2=7.81, P_O2=2.09, others 0.1. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, did I miss anything? Oh, the percentages should add up correctly. 78.1 + 20.9 +1=100, so yeah, the partial pressures should sum to 10 atm. Let me check with option J: 7.81 + 2.09 = 9.9, plus 0.1 makes exactly 10. Perfect.

So I'm confident the answer is J.

To calculate the partial pressures of nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and other gases in a tank of dry air compressed to 10.0 atmospheres, we use the formula:

\[
P_{\text{gas}} = \text{Mole Fraction} \times P_{\text{total}}
\]

The mole fractions are given as:
- \( \text{N}_2 = 0.781 \)
- \( \text{O}_2 = 0.209 \)
- Other gases \( = 0.001 \)

The total pressure is \( P_{\text{total}} = 10.0 \, \text{atm} \). Calculating each partial pressure:
- \( P_{\text{N}_2} = 0.781 \times 10.0 = 7.81 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{O}_2} = 0.209 \times 10.0 = 2.09 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{other gases}} = 0.001 \times 10.0 = 0.1 \, \text{atm} \)

The partial pressures sum to \( 7.81 + 2.09 + 0.1 = 10.0 \, \text{atm} \), confirming consistency. Comparing these values to the options, only **Option J** matches exactly:
- \( P_{\text{N}_2} = 7.81 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{O}_2} = 2.09 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{other gases}} = 0.1 \, \text{atm} \)

Thus, the correct answer is:

J
