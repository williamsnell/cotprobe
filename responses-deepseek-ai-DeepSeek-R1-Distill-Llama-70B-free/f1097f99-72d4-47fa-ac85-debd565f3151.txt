Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these indirect truth tables and determining argument validity. Let's take it step by step.

The argument given is:

1. (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W
2. ~W ⊃ X
3. ~Z ⊃ W
4. ~(X · Z) / T ⊃ U

Wait, maybe I should rewrite the last line correctly. Oh, right, the fourth premise is ~(X · Z) → (T → U). Or wait, perhaps it's written as ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U). Yeah, that's probably it. So the conclusion is T → U, but with the antecedent being ¬(X ∧ Z).

Wait, no, looking again, the fourth line is written as ~(X · Z) / T → U. Hmm, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh wait, in logic notation, the premises are each statement, and the conclusion is the last line. So the argument is:

Premise 1: (T ∧ ¬U) → ¬W
Premise 2: ¬W → X
Premise 3: ¬Z → W
Premise 4: ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U)

Wait, no, the last line is the conclusion. Oh right, the structure is:

Premises:
1. (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W
2. ~W ⊃ X
3. ~Z ⊃ W
Conclusion: ~(X · Z) / T ⊃ U

Wait, the conclusion is written as ~(X · Z) / T → U. Maybe it's better to represent it as ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U). Or perhaps it's (¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T) → U. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, in logic, the notation A / B → C would translate to (A ∧ B) → C, right? Or maybe it's A → (B → C). Wait, no, I think the notation is that A / B → C is the same as (A ∧ B) → C.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The conclusion is written as ~(X · Z) / T → U. So maybe it's (¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T) → U. Alternatively, it's ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U). Because in the notation, "A → B" is the same as "¬A ∨ B", so when you have something like (A/B) → C, it's (A ∧ B) → C, which is equivalent to ¬(A ∧ B) ∨ C.

But perhaps the conclusion is written as ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U). So the conclusion is "if not (X and Z), then T implies U." Alternatively, the conclusion could be read as "if not (X and Z) and T, then U." So the structure is a bit unclear, but I think the standard way is that the conclusion is ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U).

So the argument is:

1. (T ∧ ¬U) → ¬W
2. ¬W → X
3. ¬Z → W
4. Conclusion: ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U)

We need to determine if this argument is valid using indirect truth tables, which means we assume the conclusion is false and see if we can find a model where all premises are true, leading to the conclusion being false, which would make the argument invalid.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think about the contrapositive or use logical equivalences to simplify the argument.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the short cut method for indirect truth tables: assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and see if that's possible.

So, for the argument to be invalid, there must be a situation where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

The conclusion is ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U). For this conclusion to be false, ¬(X ∧ Z) must be true, and (T → U) must be false. 

So, ¬(X ∧ Z) is true when either X is false, Z is false, or both are false. But wait, ¬(X ∧ Z) is true in all cases except when both X and Z are true.

And (T → U) is false when T is true and U is false.

So, for the conclusion to be false: ¬(X ∧ Z) is true, and T → U is false. So:

¬(X ∧ Z) is true → at least one of X or Z is false.

T is true, and U is false.

So, in the scenario where the conclusion is false, we have T=true, U=false, and either X=false or Z=false.

Now, let's see if we can satisfy all the premises being true in such a scenario.

Let's go through each premise:

Premise 1: (T ∧ ¬U) → ¬W.

In our scenario, T is true and U is false, so T ∧ ¬U is true. So for the implication to hold, ¬W must be true. Therefore, W must be false.

So, from premise 1, W is false.

Premise 2: ¬W → X.

Since W is false, ¬W is true. So for this implication to be true, X must be true. So X is true.

So now, in our scenario, X is true.

Given that, let's look at our earlier point: for the conclusion to be false, either X is false or Z is false. But since X is now true, the only way for ¬(X ∧ Z) to be true is if Z is false.

So Z must be false.

Now, let's look at premise 3: ¬Z → W.

Z is false, so ¬Z is true. Therefore, the implication requires W to be true. But earlier, from premise 1, W must be false.

So here's a problem: premise 3 requires W to be true when Z is false, but premise 1 requires W to be false when T and ¬U are true. So we have W must be both true and false, which is impossible. So, this scenario leads to a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps there's no model where all premises are true and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is valid.

But wait, that's not possible because the options suggest that the argument is invalid and present counterexamples. So maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let's re-examine.

In our scenario where the conclusion is false:

- T = true
- U = false
- X = true (from premise 2, since W is false)
- Z must be false (to make ¬(X ∧ Z) true, since X is true)

Now, from premise 3: ¬Z → W.

Since Z is false, ¬Z is true. So for ¬Z → W to be true, W must be true.

But from premise 1: (T ∧ ¬U) → ¬W. T is true, ¬U is true, so ¬W must be true, which means W is false.

So W must be both true and false. Contradiction. Therefore, there's no possible scenario where all premises are true and the conclusion is false. So the argument is valid.

But wait, the options don't have 'A: Valid' as correct. Wait, looking back, option A says 'Valid', so if my reasoning is correct, the answer should be A: Valid.

But the options given are A to J, and the correct answer is one of them. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try again.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should consider the possibility that the conclusion is interpreted differently. Suppose the conclusion is (¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T) → U, which would mean that whenever ¬(X ∧ Z) and T are true, then U must be true.

In that case, for the conclusion to be false, we need ¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T to be true, and U to be false. So:

¬(X ∧ Z) is true → X is false or Z is false.

T is true.

U is false.

So, let's try again with this interpretation.

So, T=true, U=false.

From premise 1: (T ∧ ¬U) → ¬W. Since T is true and U is false, T ∧ ¬U is true, so ¬W must be true → W is false.

From premise 2: ¬W → X. ¬W is true, so X must be true.

So X is true.

From premise 3: ¬Z → W. Since W is false, ¬Z → W is equivalent to Z ∨ W. Since W is false, this simplifies to Z must be true for the implication to hold. Wait, no: ¬Z → W is equivalent to Z ∨ W. So if W is false, then ¬Z must be true for the implication to hold, meaning Z must be false.

Wait, no: If W is false, then for ¬Z → W to be true, whenever ¬Z is true, W must be true. But W is false, so ¬Z can't be true. Therefore, ¬Z must be false, meaning Z must be true.

Wait, no, let me clarify:

¬Z → W is equivalent to Z ∨ W.

If W is false, then Z must be true to make Z ∨ W true.

So from premise 3, since W is false, Z must be true.

So Z is true.

But now, in our scenario, X is true and Z is true, so X ∧ Z is true, making ¬(X ∧ Z) false. But in our scenario, we need ¬(X ∧ Z) to be true because the conclusion is (¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T) → U. Wait, no, in this interpretation, the conclusion is (¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T) → U. So for the conclusion to be false, (¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T) must be true, and U must be false.

But in this scenario, since X is true and Z is true, ¬(X ∧ Z) is false. So (¬(X ∧ Z) ∧ T) is false. Therefore, the conclusion (an implication with a false antecedent) is true, not false. So this doesn't satisfy the condition for the conclusion to be false.

Hmm, so perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by constructing an indirect truth table. Since the argument has variables T, U, W, X, Z, that's five variables, leading to 32 possible combinations. That's a lot, but perhaps manageable.

But since we're looking for a counterexample where all premises are true and the conclusion is false, perhaps we can find such a row.

Alternatively, perhaps using logical equivalences to simplify.

Wait, another approach: Let's derive the conclusion from the premises.

Premise 1: (T ∧ ¬U) → ¬W. Contrapositive is W → (¬T ∨ U), which is the same as W → (T → U).

Premise 2: ¬W → X.

Premise 3: ¬Z → W. Contrapositive: ¬W → Z.

Now, let's see what we can derive.

From premise 3, ¬W → Z.

From premise 2, ¬W → X.

So combining these, ¬W → (X ∧ Z).

Which is the same as ¬(X ∧ Z) → W.

Wait, no: ¬W → (X ∧ Z) is equivalent to its contrapositive: ¬(X ∧ Z) → W.

So from premises 2 and 3, we have ¬(X ∧ Z) → W.

But from premise 1, W → (T → U). So combining these:

¬(X ∧ Z) → W → (T → U).

So, ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U).

Which is the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, so the argument is valid.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options suggest it's invalid. So perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, let's see:

From premise 3: ¬Z → W.

From premise 2: ¬W → X.

So, combining these, if ¬Z is true, then W is true (from premise 3). But from premise 2, if W is false, then X is true. But if W is true, premise 2 doesn't give us any info about X.

Wait, perhaps I should use hypothetical syllogism or other rules.

Wait, from premises 2 and 3, can we get ¬(X ∧ Z) → W?

Wait, premise 2: ¬W → X.

Premise 3: ¬Z → W.

So, the contrapositive of premise 2 is W → X.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let me try to derive ¬(X ∧ Z) → W.

Assume ¬(X ∧ Z). That means either ¬X or ¬Z.

If ¬X, then from premise 2 (¬W → X), if X is false, then ¬W must be false, so W must be true.

If ¬Z, then from premise 3, ¬Z → W, so W is true.

So in either case, if ¬(X ∧ Z), then W is true.

Thus, ¬(X ∧ Z) → W.

But from premise 1, we have W → (T → U). So combining these, ¬(X ∧ Z) → (T → U), which is the conclusion.

Therefore, the conclusion follows from the premises, so the argument is valid. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Valid.

But wait, the options don't have A as correct. Let me check again the problem statement. Wait, the options are from A to J, with A being 'Valid' and others presenting counterexamples. But according to my reasoning, the argument is valid. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, from ¬(X ∧ Z), we have W. From W, we have T → U. So ¬(X ∧ Z) leads to W, which leads to T → U. So yes, the conclusion is derived.

Therefore, the argument is valid, so the answer is A.
</think>

To determine the validity of the argument, we analyze the premises and conclusion using logical equivalences and implications. The argument is as follows:

1. **Premise 1**: \( (T \land \neg U) \rightarrow \neg W \)  
   This can be rewritten as \( W \rightarrow (T \rightarrow U) \) using contraposition.

2. **Premise 2**: \( \neg W \rightarrow X \)  
   If \( W \) is false, then \( X \) must be true.

3. **Premise 3**: \( \neg Z \rightarrow W \)  
   This can be rewritten as \( \neg W \rightarrow Z \) using contraposition.

4. **Conclusion**: \( \neg (X \land Z) \rightarrow (T \rightarrow U) \)  
   This is the statement we need to validate.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- From **Premise 3**, \( \neg Z \rightarrow W \), we derive \( \neg W \rightarrow Z \) (contrapositive).
- From **Premise 2**, \( \neg W \rightarrow X \), we know that if \( W \) is false, \( X \) must be true.
- Combining these, \( \neg W \rightarrow (X \land Z) \), which is equivalent to \( \neg (X \land Z) \rightarrow W \) (contrapositive).
- From **Premise 1**, \( W \rightarrow (T \rightarrow U) \).
- Combining \( \neg (X \land Z) \rightarrow W \) with \( W \rightarrow (T \rightarrow U) \), we get \( \neg (X \land Z) \rightarrow (T \rightarrow U) \), which matches the conclusion.

### Conclusion:
The conclusion logically follows from the premises, meaning the argument is **valid**. Therefore, no counterexample exists, and the correct answer is:

**A: Valid**
