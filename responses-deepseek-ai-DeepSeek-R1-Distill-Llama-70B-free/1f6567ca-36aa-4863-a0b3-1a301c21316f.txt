Question:

After being passed over for a promotion, an aeronautic engineer became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony

Options:

A: admissible as former testimony.
B: inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception.
C: inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability.
D: admissible as a statement against interest.
E: admissible as a vicarious admission.
F: inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.
G: admissible as a dying declaration.
H: inadmissible because the engineer's deposition is biased.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible as a statement of personal or family history.

Okay, I need to figure out whether the engineer's deposition testimony is admissible in the pilot's case against the company. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: The engineer was fired after whistleblowing about false safety reports. He sued for wrongful termination, and during his deposition, he stated that the company submitted false reports to cover up structural defects. Now, the pilot, who was injured because of a crash, is suing under strict products liability and wants to use parts of the engineer's deposition.

The key issue here is whether the deposition can be admitted as evidence when the engineer is unavailable to testify at the pilot's trial. The company objects, so the court has to decide based on evidence rules.

I remember that depositions can be used as evidence under certain conditions. Specifically, Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a) says that if a witness is unavailable, certain hearsay exceptions can apply. One of those exceptions is Rule 804(b)(1), which covers former testimony. But wait, for former testimony to be admissible, the opposing party must have had a chance to cross-examine the witness during the prior proceeding. 

In this case, the deposition was taken in the engineer's wrongful termination case. The company's attorney deposed him then. Now, the pilot is a different party. So, in the pilot's trial, the company (as the defendant) didn't have the chance to cross-examine the engineer regarding the specific issues in the pilot's case. Because the deposition was in a different case, the company might not have examined him on the same topics relevant here, like the specific structural defects related to the crash.

Another exception to consider is Rule 801(d)(2), which allows for admissions by a party-opponent. But wait, the engineer wasn't a party in the pilot's case. He was an employee, but his statements are being offered against his employer. However, under the hearsay rule, statements by an employee concerning a matter within the scope of their employment, made during the employment, are not considered hearsay as admissions by a party-opponent under Rule 801(d)(2)(D). But wait, noâ€”Rule 801(d)(2)(D) says that a statement is admissible if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's employee on a matter within the scope of employment and made during employment. But here, the statement was made during the deposition, which was after the engineer was fired. So it's after employment, which might take it out of this exception.

Alternatively, could it be a statement against interest under Rule 804(b)(3)? For that, the statement must be such that a reasonable person would make it only if they believed it was true, and it must be against the engineer's interest. However, the engineer made the statement in his own lawsuit against the company for wrongful termination. His statement that the company submitted false reports could be seen as self-serving because it supports his own case. So it might not qualify as a statement against interest because he had a motive to lie or exaggerate.

Looking back at the former testimony exception, the key is whether the party against whom it's being offered had a chance to cross-examine. In the engineer's deposition, the company (through their attorney) did cross-examine him. But wait, the issue is whether the cross-examination was sufficient for the purpose of the current case. Because the deposition was in the wrongful termination case, the company's attorney would have focused on issues relevant to that case, not necessarily the specific product liability issues in the pilot's case. So the company might not have had the opportunity to cross-examine on the specific points now at issue, making the deposition inadmissible under the former testimony exception.

So the main problem is that the company didn't have the chance to cross-examine the engineer on the specific issues in the pilot's case. Therefore, the deposition testimony would be inadmissible because the company lacked the opportunity to cross on the liability issues now being raised. 

Looking at the options, option F says it's inadmissible because the company didn't have the opportunity to cross-examine on the liability issue now being offered. That fits. Alternatively, could it be hearsay without an exception? But the question is which exception applies. Since the main exception (former testimony) requires adequate cross, and that's not met, it's inadmissible.

Another option is I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But if former testimony is an exception, but the requirements aren't met, then I might not apply. Wait, former testimony is an exception under 804(b)(1). So if the requirements for that exception are not met, then yes, it's hearsay and inadmissible. But the main issue here is the cross-examination opportunity.

Wait, in the deposition, the company's attorney did cross-examine the engineer. But the cross-examination was in the context of the wrongful termination case, not the product liability case. So the company didn't have the chance to cross on the specific issues relevant to the pilot's case. Therefore, the deposition doesn't meet the requirements for admissibility under the former testimony exception because the cross wasn't on the same issues.

So the correct answer would be F: inadmissible because the company didn't have the opportunity to cross-examine on the liability issue now being offered.

The engineer's deposition testimony is sought to be admitted in the pilot's strict products liability case against the company. The engineer is unavailable, so the admissibility of the deposition hinges on whether it falls under a hearsay exception and whether the opposing party had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness on the relevant issues.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1), former testimony can be admitted if the opposing party had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the prior proceeding. However, in this case, the deposition was taken in the engineer's wrongful termination lawsuit, and the cross-examination focused on issues relevant to that case, not the specific liability issues in the pilot's product liability case. Since the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the specific issues now being raised (e.g., structural defects related to the crash), the deposition does not meet the requirements for admissibility under the former testimony exception.

Other potential exceptions, such as statement against interest or admissions by a party-opponent, do not apply here. The engineer's statements were made after his employment ended, and they were self-serving in the context of his own lawsuit, making them ineligible as statements against interest. Additionally, the statements were not admissions by a party-opponent since they were made after the engineer was no longer employed by the company.

Given these considerations, the deposition testimony is inadmissible because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issues now being offered.
