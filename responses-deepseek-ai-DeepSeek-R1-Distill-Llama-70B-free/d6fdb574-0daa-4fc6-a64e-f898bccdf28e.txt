Question:

Which of the following is true about dietary calcium:


Options:

A: Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day
B: Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium
C: There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures.
D: Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about dietary calcium, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's start by breaking down each option one by one.

The question asks which statement is true about dietary calcium. The options are A through D. I'll go through each to see which one makes sense based on what I remember about calcium and nutrition.

Option A says, "Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day." Wait, that seems really low. I remember that the recommended daily intake of calcium is much higher than that. Like, I think it's around 1,000 mg for adults, maybe more for certain groups like the elderly or adolescents. So 0.5 to 2.0 mg would be way too low. That can't be right. So I can probably eliminate option A.

Option B: "Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium." Hmm, I thought Vitamin D actually helps with calcium absorption. I remember that Vitamin D plays a role in the small intestine, enhancing the absorption of calcium. If it's activated, I guess it would increase absorption, not decrease. So option B seems incorrect as well.

Option C: "There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures." I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I know calcium is important for bone health, but does more calcium directly lead to fewer fractures? I think there's some debate about this. Some studies show that high calcium intake can help, but others suggest that very high levels might not add extra benefit, or could even have other health impacts. But the option says "clear evidence," which makes me question it. I'm not sure if it's as clear-cut as that. Maybe I should come back to this after looking at option D.

Option D: "Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low." This sounds familiar. I recall that the body absorbs calcium with varying efficiency based on how much is consumed. When intake is low, the body absorbs a higher percentage to meet its needs. Conversely, if you consume a lot, the absorption rate drops because the body can only use so much. So this statement makes sense. For example, if you take in 200 mg, you might absorb 50%, but if you take 2,000 mg, maybe only 20% gets absorbed. So option D seems correct.

Going back to option C, I think the evidence isn't entirely clear. Some studies might show a reduction in fracture risk with higher calcium, but it's probably not as definitive as option D. So I'll go with option D as the correct answer.

The correct answer is D.

D: Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low.

Answer: D
