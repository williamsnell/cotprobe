Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the average velocity of a ball thrown into the air during a specific time interval. Hmm, I remember that average velocity is different from average speed because velocity is a vector and has direction, while speed is scalar. But right now, I'm just focusing on the calculation part.

The problem states that the ball is thrown with a velocity of 40 ft/s. The height of the ball at any time t is given by the equation y = 40t - 16t². They're asking for the average velocity during the time period starting at t=2 seconds and lasting 0.5 seconds. So, that would be from t=2 to t=2.5 seconds. 

Wait, average velocity is calculated as the change in position over the change in time, right? So the formula should be (y(t2) - y(t1)) / (t2 - t1). That makes sense because it's the total displacement divided by the total time. 

Alright, so I need to find y at t=2.5 and subtract y at t=2, then divide by the time interval, which is 0.5 seconds. Let's compute each step carefully.

First, let's compute y at t=2. Plugging into the equation: y = 40*(2) -16*(2)^2. Let's calculate that. 40*2 is 80. 2 squared is 4, so 16*4 is 64. So y(2) is 80 - 64 = 16 feet. Okay, that's straightforward.

Next, y at t=2.5. So substituting t=2.5: y = 40*(2.5) -16*(2.5)^2. Let's compute each term. 40 times 2.5 is 100. 2.5 squared is 6.25. Then 16 times 6.25 is... let's see, 16 * 6 is 96 and 16 * 0.25 is 4, so 96 +4 =100. So y(2.5) is 100 - 100 = 0 feet. Wait, that can't be right. Did I do that correctly? Wait, 2.5 squared is 6.25, yes. 16 *6.25 is indeed 100. So 40*2.5 is 100, so 100 -100=0. So the ball is at 0 feet at t=2.5 seconds. Oh, wait, that makes sense if the ball is hitting the ground again at that time, but wait, when is it actually hitting the ground? Let me think. Maybe that's correct.

Wait a second, let me double-check the equation. The standard equation for projectile motion under gravity is y = v0*t - (1/2)g t². Here, g is 32 ft/s², so (1/2)g would be 16, which matches the equation given. So the equation is correct. So at t=2.5, the height is 0. Hmm, interesting. So the ball was thrown upwards and comes back down to the ground at t=2.5 seconds. So between t=2 and t=2.5, the ball is on its way down, passing through 16 feet at t=2, and then hitting the ground at t=2.5.

So now, the average velocity is (y(2.5) - y(2)) / (2.5 - 2). Let's plug in the numbers: (0 -16) / (0.5) = (-16)/(0.5) = -32 ft/s. Wait, that would give -32. But let me see the options. Option B is -32 ft/s. So is that the answer? Hmm. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, so y(2) is 16, y(2.5) is 0. So change in y is 0 -16 = -16 feet. The time change is 0.5 seconds. So average velocity is -16 / 0.5 = -32. That's correct. So the answer should be option B, which is -32 ft/s.

But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes average velocity can be tricky. Is there another way to approach this, maybe using calculus? Because if we think about velocity, it's the derivative of position with respect to time. The position is y =40t -16t², so the velocity at any time t is dy/dt=40 -32t. 

But wait, average velocity is different from instantaneous velocity. The question is about average velocity over a time interval, so we should stick to the (y2 - y1)/(t2 - t1) approach. Because average velocity is total displacement over total time, regardless of the instantaneous speeds.

So in this case, the displacement is -16 feet over 0.5 seconds, which gives -32 ft/s. So I'm confident the answer is B.

To determine the average velocity of the ball during the time interval from \( t = 2 \, \text{s} \) to \( t = 2.5 \, \text{s} \), we use the formula for average velocity:

\[
\text{Average Velocity} = \frac{y(t_2) - y(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}
\]

The height of the ball at any time \( t \) is given by \( y = 40t - 16t^2 \).

1. **Calculate \( y(2) \):**
   \[
   y(2) = 40(2) - 16(2)^2 = 80 - 64 = 16 \, \text{feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( y(2.5) \):**
   \[
   y(2.5) = 40(2.5) - 16(2.5)^2 = 100 - 100 = 0 \, \text{feet}
   \]

3. **Compute the average velocity:**
   \[
   \text{Average Velocity} = \frac{y(2.5) - y(2)}{2.5 - 2} = \frac{0 - 16}{0.5} = -32 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]

Thus, the average velocity of the ball during the specified time interval is \( -32 \, \text{ft/s} \). This matches option **B**.
