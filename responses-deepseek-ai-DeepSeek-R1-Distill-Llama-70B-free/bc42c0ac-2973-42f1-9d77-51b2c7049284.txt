Okay, so I have this bankruptcy question here, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Mr. Williams filed for bankruptcy. He has total assets of $2,240 and liabilities of $5,600. So, his debts are more than his assets, which makes sense why he's filing for bankruptcy. Now, the question is about how much a creditor, Mr. Johnson, can expect to receive. Mr. Johnson has a claim of $1,725.

Hmm, I remember that in bankruptcy, creditors get paid based on the assets available. But wait, how does that exactly work? I think it depends on whether it's a liquidation bankruptcy, like Chapter 7, where assets are sold to pay creditors. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe Mr. Williams is filing under Chapter 7, so his assets will be distributed among his creditors.

So, first, Mr. Williams has $2,240 in assets. His total liabilities are $5,600. That means the total amount owed to all creditors is $5,600, but the total assets available for distribution are only $2,240. So, the creditors won't get the full amount they're owed.

I think the process involves the trustee (the person handling the bankruptcy) selling the assets and distributing the funds to the creditors. But the distribution isn't necessarily equal; it depends on the priority of the debts. Wait, do all creditors get paid equally, or are some paid before others? I remember something about secured creditors having priority, but if all the creditors here are unsecured, then they get a pro rata share.

Assuming Mr. Johnson is an unsecured creditor, like if it's a credit card debt or a personal loan, then he would be in the same pool as other unsecured creditors. So, the total assets available for distribution to unsecured creditors would be $2,240, but we need to find out how much each creditor gets.

Wait, but the total liabilities are $5,600, which is more than the assets. So, the $2,240 will be divided among all the creditors. How much each gets depends on their proportion of the total debt.

So, the ratio would be total assets divided by total liabilities. That is $2,240 / $5,600. Let me calculate that. 2240 divided by 5600. Dividing numerator and denominator by 5600, let's see: 2240/5600 = 0.4. So 40% of each creditor's claim would be paid.

Wait, but wait a second, is that the case? Because maybe not all of the $5,600 is from unsecured creditors. Maybe some are secured, but the question doesn't specify. If there are secured creditors, they get paid first from the proceeds of the collateral. But since the question doesn't give any details about secured vs unsecured, I might have to assume that all the liabilities are unsecured. Or perhaps the $2,240 is the amount available after secured creditors are paid. But since the question doesn't specify, I think the simplest approach is to assume that the $2,240 is the total available for all unsecured creditors, including Mr. Johnson.

So, the total claims are $5,600, and the assets are $2,240. So each creditor gets (their claim / total liabilities) * total assets.

So, Mr. Johnson's claim is $1,725. So his share would be (1725 / 5600) * 2240.

Let me compute that. Let's compute 1725 divided by 5600 first. 1725 ÷ 5600. Let's see, 5600 times 0.3 is 1680. Then 1725-1680 is 45, so 0.308 approximately? Let me compute it more accurately.

1725 / 5600 = (1725 ÷ 25) / (5600 ÷ 25) = 69 / 224 ≈ 0.308.

Then multiply by 2240: 0.308 * 2240.

Let me compute 0.3 * 2240 = 672, and 0.008 * 2240 = 17.92. So total is 672 + 17.92 = 689.92, which is approximately $690.

Looking back at the options, option C is $690. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach: sometimes, when you have total assets and you're paying pro rata, each creditor gets a percentage. So the total assets are $2,240, and total liabilities are $5,600. The ratio is 2240/5600 = 0.4. So each creditor gets 40% of their claim.

So 40% of $1,725 is 0.4 * 1725 = $690. Yep, same result.

So the answer is C.

To determine how much Mr. Johnson can expect to receive, we analyze the bankruptcy scenario. Mr. Williams has total assets of $2,240 and total liabilities of $5,600. Since the assets are insufficient to cover all liabilities, the $2,240 will be distributed pro rata among the creditors based on their claims.

The proportion of assets available for distribution is calculated as:

\[
\text{Proportion} = \frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Total Liabilities}} = \frac{2,240}{5,600} = 0.4 \, \text{(or 40%)}.
\]

Each creditor, including Mr. Johnson, will receive 40% of their claim. Mr. Johnson's claim is $1,725, so the amount he can expect to receive is:

\[
\text{Payment} = 0.4 \times 1,725 = 690.
\]

Thus, Mr. Johnson can expect to receive **$690**. The correct answer is:

**C: $690**
