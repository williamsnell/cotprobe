Okay, so I've got this problem about fluid flowing through a circular pipe and heat transfer happening. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the fluid is flowing in a circular pipe with radius R. Heat is being transferred from the walls to the fluid at a constant rate q_w per unit area. They want an expression for the temperature distribution and the local heat transfer coefficient h_x. The flow is laminar and fully developed, and axial conduction is negligible compared to radial conduction. Also, the bulk mean temperature T_b1 is known at x=0.

Hmm, I remember that for laminar flow in a pipe with constant heat flux, the heat transfer coefficient can be found using some standard correlations. Oh wait, I think the Nusselt number comes into play here. The Nusselt number (Nu) is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer, right?

In a pipe with constant heat flux (which is what this problem is since q_w is constant), the Nusselt number is a known value for fully developed flow. I recall that for laminar flow (Re < 2300), the Nu is constant once the flow is fully developed.

Wait, for a circular tube with constant wall heat flux, the Nusselt number is 4.36? Or was it 3.66? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, I remember that for a constant wall temperature, the Nu is 3.66 for laminar flow, but when the wall has a constant heat flux, it's a different value. Maybe 4.36?

Oh wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the Nusselt number for fully developed flow in a tube with constant heat flux (uniform q") is higher than that with constant wall temperature. Because for constant wall temperature, the thermal boundary layer develops differently. So for constant heat flux, I think the Nu is around 4.36 or something like that.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For fully developed laminar flow in a circular tube:

- Constant wall temperature (T_w constant): Nu = 3.66
- Constant heat flux (q_w" constant): Nu = 4.36

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Or is that the other way around? Oh wait, no. Maybe I'm getting it wrong. Because for the constant heat flux case, the solution leads to a higher Nusselt number.

Alternatively, maybe I should derive it. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I can just remember the standard value.

Wait, another approach. The local heat transfer coefficient h_x is related to the Nusselt number by h_x = Nu * (k/D), where D is the diameter of the pipe, and k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.

So if for constant q_w (heat flux), the Nu is known. Wait, I think for a circular pipe with uniform heat flux, the Nusselt number is 4.36. So the answer would be h_x = 4.36 (k/D), which would be option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 4.36 (k/D). So that's probably the right one. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Wait, another thought. The problem states that axial conduction is negligible, which is an assumption that makes the problem a bit simpler. That would be correct for this scenario because in fully developed flow and for high Peclet numbers, axial conduction isn't significant.

Also, the bulk temperature is given at x=0, which would affect the temperature distribution, but since the flow is fully developed, the solution for h_x would be based on the local conditions, not the entrance effects.

So I think the correct Nusselt number is 4.36, which gives option G as the answer. But wait, I've heard of the Sieder-Tate correlation, which is for combined entry length, but that's for different conditions.

Alternatively, the value for fully developed, laminar flow with constant heat flux is 4.36. So that's the Nu, and so h would be 4.36 k/D.

Looking back at the options, yes option G is 4.36 (k/D). So that's the answer.
</think>

The problem involves laminar, fully developed flow in a circular pipe with a constant heat flux \( q_w \) applied at the wall. The goal is to determine the local heat transfer coefficient \( h_x \). For such a scenario, the Nusselt number (\( \text{Nu} \)) is a key parameter, defined as:

\[
\text{Nu} = \frac{h_x D}{k}
\]

where \( D \) is the pipe diameter and \( k \) is the fluid's thermal conductivity. For fully developed laminar flow with a constant heat flux boundary condition, the Nusselt number is known to be \( \text{Nu} = 4.36 \). This value is specific to the case where the heat flux is uniform and axial conduction is negligible, as stated in the problem.

Using the definition of the Nusselt number, the local heat transfer coefficient can be expressed as:

\[
h_x = \text{Nu} \cdot \frac{k}{D} = 4.36 \cdot \frac{k}{D}
\]

Among the given options, the correct match for \( h_x = 4.36 \cdot \frac{k}{D} \) is option G. This aligns with the standard result for fully developed laminar flow under constant heat flux conditions.
