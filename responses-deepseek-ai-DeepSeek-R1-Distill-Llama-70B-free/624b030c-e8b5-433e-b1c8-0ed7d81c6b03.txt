Read the the following poem to answer questions.
Take up the White Man's burden—
Send forth the best ye breed—
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild—
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.
...
Take up the White Man's burden—
The savage wars of peace—
Fill full the mouth of Famine
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought…
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to naught.
Rudyard Kipling, The White Man's Burden, 1899

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Kipling's poem "The White Man's Burden." I remember that this poem is often associated with the idea of imperialism, specifically the British Empire. The question is asking about Kipling's conception of the British imperial mission based on the poem.

First, I'll read the poem again to get the main themes. The poem starts with "Take up the White Man's burden—Send forth the best ye breed—Go bind your sons to exile." So it's talking about sending the best people to serve others, which suggests a sense of duty or responsibility. It mentions serving "captives' need" and waiting in "heavy harness," which implies that it's a tough and perhaps thankless task.

The next lines refer to "new-caught, sullen peoples, Half-devil and half-child." This part seems a bit derogatory, suggesting that the people being colonized are not fully civilized and need guidance. So Kipling is portraying the colonized as inferior and in need of help.

Then the second stanza talks about "savage wars of peace," filling the "mouth of Famine," and bidding "sickness cease." This indicates that the mission involves bringing order and solving problems like hunger and disease. However, it also warns that even when success seems near, "sloth and heathen Folly" can bring all hopes to nothing, which suggests that the task is difficult and perhaps prone to failure.

Looking at the options:

A: an attempt to bring civilization to uncivilized peoples. This seems to fit because the poem talks about guiding and serving others who are seen as less civilized.

B: a mission to educate and enlighten. While related, the poem doesn't explicitly mention education. It's more about taking on the burden and the difficulties involved.

C: a task that is doomed to fail. The poem does mention that hopes might come to naught, but I'm not sure if it's saying it's doomed or just difficult.

D: a glorious, religious responsibility. The poem doesn't seem to frame it as glorious or religious, more as a burden.

E: a profitable endeavor for the empire. The poem doesn't talk about profit; it's more about duty and helping others.

F: a difficult but necessary task. This seems to fit because the poem emphasizes the burden and the challenges, implying that it's necessary despite the hardships.

G: a necessary evil for the good of the empire. I'm not sure about the 'evil' part. The poem doesn't explicitly state that it's evil, just that it's a burden.

H: a ruthless exercise of power. The poem doesn't really suggest ruthlessness; it's more about the burden and duty.

I: a hopeless task with no purpose. The poem does say that hopes might be brought to naught, but it's more about the difficulty than being hopeless.

J: a burden that should be willingly undertaken. The poem's title is "The White Man's Burden," and it's urging people to take it up, so this fits as well.

Wait, so both F and J could fit. F says it's a difficult but necessary task, and J says it's a burden that should be willingly undertaken. The poem does portray it as a burden and something that needs to be taken up despite the challenges. So which is better?

Looking back at the question, it's about the conception of the mission. The poem is exhorting people to take up the burden, implying that it's necessary and should be done. So J could be the answer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, A is about bringing civilization, which is a common theme in imperialism. The poem talks about the "white man's burden" as bringing order and help to "half-devil and half-child" peoples. So A might also fit.

Wait, the question is about the best summary. The poem's main idea is that the white man has a duty to civilize others, even though it's a tough and thankless job. So A seems correct. But other options like F and J are also close.

Wait, looking at the answer options again:

F says it's a difficult but necessary task. That aligns with the poem's portrayal of the burden being hard but something that must be done.

J says it's a burden that should be willingly undertaken. The poem's title and repeated refrain of "Take up the burden" suggest that it's something that should be accepted.

So which is better? The question is about the conception of the mission. So it's not just about the burden but the purpose. The poem seems to present it as a necessary task, hence F. Alternatively, J is more about the willingness to take it on.

I think the best answer is A. Because the poem is about bringing civilization to others, viewing them as halfdevil and halfchild. So it's about civilizing the uncivilized.

But earlier I thought F was a good option too. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The poem's conception is that the mission is to bring civilization, even though it's a difficult task. So A is about the purpose, while F is about the nature of the task.

The question is asking for the best summary of Kipling's conception. So it's about what the mission is, not just its characteristics. So A would be the mission's purpose, which is to civilize others.

Alternatively, F is about it being a difficult but necessary task, which describes the mission's nature.

I think the answer is A, but I'm a bit confused because F also seems relevant.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: an attempt to bring civilization to uncivilized peoples

Yes, that's exactly what the poem is about. The white man's burden is to civilize the "half-devil and half-child" peoples.

So the correct answer is A.

The poem "The White Man's Burden" by Rudyard Kipling reflects the idea of imperialism, where the British Empire is portrayed as having a duty to civilize less developed peoples. The poem describes the colonized as "half-devil and half-child," implying they are inferior and in need of guidance. It emphasizes the challenges and hardships of this mission, referring to it as a "burden" that must be undertaken despite its difficulties. While the poem acknowledges the thankless nature of the task and the potential for failure, its central theme revolves around the idea of bringing civilization to those perceived as uncivilized. This aligns most closely with the option that describes the mission as an attempt to bring civilization to uncivilized peoples.

Answer: A
