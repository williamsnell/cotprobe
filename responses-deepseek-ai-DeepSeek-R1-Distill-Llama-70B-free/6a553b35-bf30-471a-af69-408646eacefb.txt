Okay, so I have this accounting question here about the equity method of accounting for investments. Hmm, I remember that the equity method is used when a company has a significant influence over another company, but not majority control. 

The question says that Goll Co. has a 25% interest in Rose Co. and an 18% interest in Jave Co. Neither of these investments gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence over either company's operating and financial policies. So the question is, which of these two investments should Goll account for using the equity method.

Wait, what's the criteria for using the equity method? I think it's when the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence, typically when the investment is 20% or more of the investee's voting stock. But if it's less than 20%, then it's usually considered a cost method investment unless there's some other reason to think there's significant influence.

In this case, Rose is 25%, which is above 20%, but the question says neither investment gives Goll significant influence. So does that mean they don't use the equity method for either? Or does the 25% automatically trigger it regardless of actual influence?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the 20% is a guideline, but the actual ability to influence is the key factor. So if Goll owns 25% but can't influence, then they wouldn't use equity method. Conversely, if they own less than 20% but have significant influence, they might still use equity method. But in this case, neither investment provides influence.

So looking at the options, the question is whether either Rose or Jave should be accounted for using equity method. Since Goll can't influence either, they shouldn't use equity method for either. So the answer would be that neither should be using the equity method.

Looking at the options, option E says "Neither Rose nor Jave." Option B says neither unless they acquire significant influence. Oh wait, because right now they can't influence either, so E would be correct. Because the question states that neither gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence.

Wait, but the 25% in Rose is above 20%, so under the equity method criteria, unless it's a situation where the investor can't influence, like if the investee is a foreign company or a subsidiary of another company. But the question doesn't mention any such exceptions. So in general, if you have 20% or more, you use equity method unless you can't influence. So here, Goll can't influence either, so neither should be accounted for using equity method.

So the correct answer would be option E.

The equity method of accounting is used when an investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee, typically indicated by owning 20% or more of the investee's voting stock. However, the actual ability to influence is the key factor, not just the ownership percentage. 

In this case, Goll Co. owns 25% of Rose Co. and 18% of Jave Co., but neither investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence. Since significant influence is absent for both investments, the equity method should not be applied to either. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is that neither Rose nor Jave should be accounted for using the equity method, as Goll lacks significant influence over both companies.
