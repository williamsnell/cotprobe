Question:

In 1985, a widow, the undisputed owner of a cottage, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when

Options:

A: the Boy Scouts of America discovered the gift in the will.
B: the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
C: the tenant first moved into the cottage.
D: the widow left no heirs.
E: the widow died.
F: the tenant initially signed the lease.
G: the widow first leased the cottage.
H: the Boy Scouts of America took legal action.
I: the tenant discontinued paying rent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

In 1985, a widow leased her cottage to a tenant for seven years. The rent was monthly, due on the first of each month. Then in 1986, the widow died without any heirs, and her will left everything to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage wasn't specifically mentioned, so I think under the law, it would go to the Boy Scouts as part of the residue.

The tenant learned about the widow's death a month later and decided to stay but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts didn't know about the gift until 2009 when their attorneys found out. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years in this jurisdiction.

So the question is, when did the tenant's period for adverse possession start?

I remember that adverse possession requires that the possession be open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, and continuous. The key point here is when the tenant's possession became hostile. Because as long as they were paying rent, they had the widow's permission. But once they stopped paying, that's when they might be considered trespassers.

Wait, but the lease was for seven years starting in 1985, so it would end in 1992. The widow died in 1986. So after her death, the tenant's lease would continue, but who would be the landlord? The widow's estate, which is now the Boy Scouts because she left everything to them.

But the tenant stopped paying rent a month after the widow died, so in 1986. So from that point on, they were occupying without paying. But did they have the landlord's permission? Because the lease was still in effect until 1992. Or does the lease terminate upon the widow's death?

Hmm, wait. A lease is binding on the estate. So when the widow died, her estate (now owned by Boy Scouts) took over the lease. So the tenant was still a tenant under the lease until it expired in 1992. So from 1986 to 1992, the tenant was in possession with the estate's permission, as the lease continued.

Wait, but the tenant stopped paying rent. So even though they had permission to be there under the lease, they weren't paying rent anymore. But does that affect the adverse possession? Because the lease is a contract, so the tenant's obligation is to pay rent, but the possession is still with permission until the lease ends.

So the tenant was a tenant until 1992. After that, if they stayed, they would be without permission, so that's when adverse possession could start.

But wait, the tenant might argue that once the widow died, the lease was no longer valid, but under the law, the lease would bind the estate. So the tenant's possession was still lawful until the lease ended in 1992.

So the adverse possession period couldn't start until the lease ended because until then, the tenant had legal possession. So in 1992, the lease ended. If the tenant remained beyond that without permission, that's when the adverse possession clock starts.

But wait, the options don't include 1992. Let's look at the options again.

The options are when the period began. The options given are:

A: Boy Scouts discovered the gift.

B: lease expired.

C: tenant moved in.

D: widow left no heirs.

E: widow died.

F: tenant signed lease.

G: widow leased.

H: Boy Scouts took legal action.

I: tenant stopped paying rent.

J: tenant believed no permission.

So according to this, B is when the lease expired.

So the period would start when the lease ended, which is 1992, and the tenant stayed without permission. But the question is, when did the period begin?

Wait, but the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986. But they still had the lease until 1992. So until 1992, their possession was lawful. So the adverse possession couldn't start until after the lease ended.

So the period would begin in 1992 when the lease ended, and the tenant continued to stay without permission.

Looking at the options, option B says when the lease expired, so that would be when the period starts.

Another angle: some states consider that if a tenant holds over after the lease ends, that's when adverse possession can begin. So in this case, the lease ends in 1992, so from 1992 onward, the tenant is trespassing.

So the statutory period starts then.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
</think>

The statutory period for adverse possession begins when the tenant's possession becomes hostile and without permission. In this scenario, the tenant had a valid lease until 1992, as the widow's death did not terminate the lease; it simply passed to her estate, which was bequeathed to the Boy Scouts of America. Until the lease expired in 1992, the tenant had legal permission to occupy the cottage, even though they stopped paying rent. Therefore, the period for adverse possession could not begin until after the lease expired in 1992, when the tenant's continued occupation became trespassory.

Option B correctly identifies that the statutory period for adverse possession began when the tenant's lease with the widow expired.

Answer: B
