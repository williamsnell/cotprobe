Question:

Upon graduation from high school, a student enrolled in a college close to where he lived. However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, "If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. " The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely

Options:

A: relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.
B: relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.
C: not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.
D: not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.

Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about contracts and suretyship. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the scenario is about a student who wants to buy a car. He doesn't have enough money, so his father makes a promise to the finance manager.

From what I remember, when someone agrees to pay the debt of another, they become a surety. But there are rules about sureties and when they can be held liable. I think the general rule is that the creditor has to first try to collect from the primary debtor before going after the surety. That's called the "right of subrogation," I think. So if the creditor doesn't sue the primary debtor first, the surety might not be liable.

In this case, the son was the primary debtor because he was buying the car. The father promised that if the son defaults, he would pay. So the father is a surety. But the car lot went straight to the father without suing the son first. Wait, does that matter?

I remember something about the "main purpose exception." That's when the surety's promise is made with the main purpose of benefiting the surety themselves, not just helping the primary debtor. For example, if a parent co-signs a loan for a child, the main purpose might be to help the child, so the main purpose exception wouldn't apply. But if the surety is also getting something out of the deal, like if it's a business loan where the surety benefits, then maybe the exception applies.

Wait, in this question, the father's promise was to help his son buy a car. That seems more like the main purpose is to help the son, not the father getting any direct benefit. So the main purpose exception wouldn't make the father primarily liable. Therefore, the creditor should first go after the son.

So the car lot should have sued the son first before going after the father. If they didn't, the father might not be liable because of the suretyship rules. But wait, some states have different rules about this. Like, in some places, the creditor can choose whom to sue first, but others require exhausting the primary debtor first.

Another thought: if the father is considered an accommodation party, meaning he's only helping the son without any direct benefit, then the creditor must first try to collect from the son. So the car lot's failure to do that would relieve the father of liability.

Looking at the options, option A says the court would relieve the father because the car lot didn't sue the son first. Option C says the court wouldn't relieve him because of the main purpose exception. But I thought the main purpose exception applies when the surety is the primary beneficiary, like in a business context. Here, the father is just helping his son, so the main purpose exception doesn't apply. Therefore, the car lot should have sued the son first. So the father shouldn't be liable, which would make option A correct.

Wait, but option C says it's because of the main purpose exception. Did I mix up the exceptions? Let me think again. The main purpose exception makes the surety primarily liable, meaning the creditor can sue the surety first without going after the primary debtor. But that's only when the surety's main purpose was to benefit themselves. Since the father's main purpose was to help his son, not himself, the exception doesn't apply. So the creditor must go after the son first. Therefore, the father isn't liable because the car lot didn't sue the son first. So the answer is A.

But wait, option C says the court would not relieve the father because of the main purpose exception. If the main purpose exception applies, then the father is primarily liable. But in this case, the main purpose was to help the son, so the exception doesn't apply. So option C isn't the right reason. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The scenario involves a father who acted as a surety for his son's car loan. The father promised to cover the debt if the son defaulted. When the son defaulted, the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. Under suretyship law, the general rule is that a creditor must first attempt to collect from the primary debtor (the son) before pursuing the surety (the father). This is known as the "right of subrogation."

The "main purpose exception" applies when the surety's primary motivation is to benefit themselves, which is not the case here. The father's main purpose was to help his son, not to derive personal benefit. Therefore, the main purpose exception does not apply, and the creditor should have sued the son first. The car lot's failure to do so means the father is not liable under these circumstances.

Option A correctly reflects this reasoning, as the court would relieve the father of liability because the car lot did not first sue the son. Option C is incorrect because the main purpose exception does not apply here.
