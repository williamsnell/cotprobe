Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about moving a spacecraft from a low Earth orbit to a synchronous orbit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on orbital mechanics, but let me think through this.

The spacecraft's mass is 10,000 kg, right? It's currently parked in a circular orbit 200 km above Earth's surface. I need to find the minimum energy required to move it into a synchronous orbit with a period of 24 hours. The options are from A to J, each with different values in joules.

Wait, I remember that when moving a satellite from one orbit to another, the minimum energy is involved. Oh right, Hohmann transfer! That's the most efficient way to change orbits—it uses an elliptical transfer orbit that touches both the initial and final circular orbits.

So, first, I need to find the radius of the initial and final orbits. The initial orbit is 200 km above Earth's surface. Earth's average radius is about 6,371 km, so the initial orbital radius r1 is 6371 + 200 = 6571 km. But wait, units are probably in meters for calculations, so 6,571,000 meters.

The final orbit is a synchronous one, which means it has a period of 24 hours. I remember the formula for the period of a circular orbit is T = 2π√(r³/(GM)). I'll need to find r for T=24 hours.

Let me jot down the constants I'll need. G is the gravitational constant, 6.674×10^-11 N(m/kg)^2. M is Earth's mass, about 5.972×10^24 kg.

So, T is 24 hours, which is 24*3600 seconds = 86,400 seconds.

Plugging into the formula:

T² = (4π²/GM) * r³

So solving for r³:

r³ = (T² * GM) / (4π²)

Let me compute that.

First, compute T squared: (86400)^2 = 7.46496e+9 s².

GM is 6.674e-11 * 5.972e24 = Let's calculate that. 6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = approximately 3.986e14 m³/s². Wait, that's the standard gravitational parameter for Earth, right? So I can just use 3.986e14.

So, numerator is 7.46496e9 * 3.986e14 = ?

Let me compute that: 7.46496e9 *3.986e14 = 7.46496 *3.986 = approx 29.75, and exponents 10^(9+14)=10^23. So 29.75e23 = 2.975e24.

Wait, wait, more accurately:

7.46496e9 * 3.986e14 = (7.46496 * 3.986) * 1e23.

7.46496 *3.986 ≈ 29.75 as before. So 29.75e23 = 2.975e24.

Denominator is 4π². π is about 3.1416, so π² is ~9.8696. Multiply by 4:  ~39.478.

So r³ = (2.975e24) / 39.478 ≈ (2.975 / 39.478) * 1e24.

2.975 / 39.478 ≈ 0.07535. So 0.07535e24 = 7.535e22 m³.

Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Let me recheck.

Wait, r³ = (T² * GM) / (4π²) → T is 86400 s, so T² is 7.46496e9 s². GM is 3.986e14 m³/s².

Multiply those: 7.46496e9 * 3.986e14 = 7.46496 *3.986 * 1e(9+14) = 29.75e23 → 2.975e24 m³/s² * s² → m³.

Then divide by 4π²: 39.478. So 2.975e24 / 39.478 ≈ (2.975 /39.478) *1e24 → 0.07535 *1e24 = 7.535e22 m³.

So cube root of 7.535e22 m³. Let me find the cube root.

Cube root of 7.535e22 m³ is (7.535e22)^(1/3).

Let me compute that. 1e22 is (1e(24/3))=1e8 m, but wait, 1e24 m³ is (1e8 m)^3. Hmm.

Wait, 1e24 m³ is (1e8 m)^3.

So 7.535e22 = 75.35e21 = 75.35 * (1e7 m)^3. Because (1e7 m)^3 is 1e21 m³.

So cube root of 75.35e21 m³ is (75.35)^(1/3) *1e7 m.

Cube root of 75 is approximately 4.217. So about 4.217e7 m, which is 42,170,000 meters or 42,170 km.

Wait, but wait, in radius, not diameter. So that's about 42,170 km from Earth's center. So the synchronous orbit radius is about 42,170 km. But I've heard that the geostationary orbit is around 42,164 km, so that makes sense.

So the initial radius r1 is 6,571 km, and the final r2 is about 42,170 km.

Now, the Hohmann transfer requires moving from r1 to r2. The energy required is the difference in mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) between the two orbits, but wait, no—since in Hohmann transfer, you only need to calculate the energy changes at perigee and apogee.

Wait, the energy required is the sum of the change from circular orbit at r1 to the transfer ellipse, and then from the transfer ellipse to the circular orbit at r2.

So the total energy required is the sum of two delta Vs, but wait, no—wait, the question is about the minimum energy required. Oh, right, it's the work done against the gravitational field, which is the difference in mechanical energy between the two orbits.

Wait, wait. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) for a circular orbit is known. The formula is E = -GMm/(2r).

So the initial mechanical energy E1 is -GMm/(2 r1), and the final E2 is -GMm/(2 r2). So the energy required is the difference E2 - E1, but wait, since E2 is more negative (because r2 > r1, so E2 is lower than E1), the energy required would be E1 - E2, because you're moving to a higher energy state. Wait, no, because E becomes less negative as you go to higher orbits. So E1 is more negative than E2.

Wait, no. For a higher orbit, the energy is higher (less negative). So E1 = - (GMm)/(2 r1), E2 = - (GMm)/(2 r2). Since r2 > r1, (1/r2) < (1/r1), so E2 is greater than E1 because it's less negative. So the change in energy ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So the energy required is E2 - E1.

But wait, wait, when you go from a lower orbit to a higher orbit, you have to input energy, so the system's energy increases, so the required energy is positive.

So ΔE = E2 - E1 = ( - GMm/(2 r2) ) - ( - GMm/(2 r1) ) ) = GMm (1/(2 r1) - 1/(2 r2) ) ) / 1.

So, let's compute that.

Given that G=6.674e-11, M=5.972e24 kg, m=1e4 kg.

So, let's compute each term.

First, 1/(2 r1) and 1/(2 r2).

r1 = 6,571 km = 6,571,000 m.

r2 = 42,170,000 m.

So 1/(2 r1) = 1/(2 * 6.571e6) = 1/(1.3142e7) ≈ 7.61e-8 1/m.

1/(2 r2) = 1/(2 * 4.217e7) = 1/(8.434e7) ≈ 1.186e-8 1/m.

So the difference is 7.61e-8 - 1.186e-8 = 6.424e-8 1/m.

Multiply by GMm:

ΔE = (6.674e-11) * (5.972e24) * (1e4) * (6.424e-8) 

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, compute GM: 6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = 3.986e14 m³/s². Yeah, that's the standard value.

So, GMm = 3.986e14 * 1e4 = 3.986e18 m³/s² * kg? Wait, no. Units-wise, GM has units m^3/s². m is kg, so GMm is (m^3/s²)*kg = kg m³/s²? Not sure, but the calculation will proceed.

Wait, the expression is (GMm) * (1/(2 r1) - 1/(2 r2)).

So, substituting numbers:

GMm = 3.986e14 * 1e4 = 3.986e18.

Multiply by (6.424e-8):

3.986e18 * 6.424e-8 = (3.986 * 6.424) * 1e(18-8) → 3.986 *6.424 ≈ let's compute that.

3.986 *6 = 23.916; 3.986 *0.424 ≈ 1.690. So total ≈25.606.

So 25.606e10 → 2.5606e11 joules.

Wait, so ΔE ≈ 2.56e11 J.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.57e11 J, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I made a rounding error in the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers more accurately.

Compute r3 for T=24h.

T^2 = (4π²/GM) * r³.

Compute T^2:

(86400)^2 = 7.46496e9 s².

Compute GM = 6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = let's compute:

6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = 6.674 *5.972 = approximately 39.860; 1e-11 *1e24 = 1e13. So GM=3.986e14 m³/s².

So, r³ = (7.46496e9 * 3.986e14) / (4π²).

Compute numerator: 7.46496e9 *3.986e14 = 7.46496 *3.986 = approx 29.75, so 29.75e23 = 2.975e24.

Denominator: 4π² ≈ 39.478.

So r³ = 2.975e24 /39.478 = approx 7.535e22 m³.

r = cube root of 7.535e22 m³.

Cube root of 7.535e22:

Express 7.535e22 as 7535e19 = 7535*(1e6.333...)³ ?

Wait, 1e6 is (10^2)^3=1e6, wait, perhaps better to compute logarithm.

Log10(7.535e22) = log10(7.535) +22 ≈ 0.877 +22 =22.877.

Divide by 3: 22.877 /3 ≈7.6257.

So 10^7.6257 meters.

10^0.6257 is approx 4.22 (since 10^0.6=3.98, 0.625 is about 4.17).

So 4.22e7 meters = 42,200,000 m, so 42,200 km. Close enough to the known 42,164 km, so r2 is accurate.

Now, computing 1/(2r1) - 1/(2r2):

r1 =6571e3 m → 6.571e6 m.

1/(2r1) = 1/(1.3142e7) ≈ 7.61e-8.

r2=4.217e7 m.

1/(2r2) = 1/(8.434e7) ≈1.186e-8.

Difference: 7.61e-8 -1.186e-8 =6.424e-8.

Now, compute ΔE = GMm * (difference).

GMm =3.986e14 *1e4 =3.986e18.

Multiply by 6.424e-8:

3.986e18 *6.424e-8 = let's compute 3.986 *6.424 first.

3.986 *6 =23.916; 3.986 *0.424= approx 1.690 (since 3.986 *0.4=1.594, and 3.986*0.024=0.0956; total ≈1.69).

So 23.916 +1.69 =25.606.

So 25.606e(18-8) → 25.606e10 =2.5606e11 J.

Which is approximately 2.56e11 J.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.57e11, which is very close. But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the cube root, because the exact value might differ a bit.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute r exactly.

Let me compute r³ = (T² * GM) / (4π²) precisely.

T=86400 s.

T²= 86400^2= 7,464,960,000 =7.46496e9 s².

GM =3.986004e14 m³/s².

So, numerator =7.46496e9 *3.986004e14 = Let me compute that more accurately.

7.46496e9 =7,464,960,000.

3.986004e14 = 398,600,400,000,000.

Multiplying 7,464,960,000 *398,600,400,000,000.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 7.46496 *3.986004 = let's do that.

7.46496 *3.986004:

7 *3.986004 = 27.902028.

0.46496 *3.986004 ≈ approx 1.852 (since 0.4*3.986=1.594; 0.06496*3.986≈0.2588; total ≈1.8528).

So total is 27.902 +1.8528 ≈29.7548.

So 29.7548e(9+14) =29.7548e23 =2.97548e24.

Denominator 4π² =39.4784176.

So r³=2.97548e24 / 39.4784176 = approx 7.534e22 m³.

r = (7.534e22)^(1/3).

Compute cube of 4.22e7: (4.22e7)^3 = (4.22)^3 * 1e21.

4.22^3= approx 4^3=64, 0.22^3=0.0106, but more accurately:

4.22 *4.22 =17.8084, then *4.22 ≈17.8084 *4=71.2336, 17.8084 *0.22≈3.9178. Total≈75.1514.

So (4.22e7)^3 =75.1514e21=7.51514e22 m³.

Which is very close to our r³=7.534e22.

So r=4.22e7 m is a good approximation. So r2=42,200,000 m.

So back to the energy calculation.

ΔE = GMm (1/(2r1) - 1/(2r2)).

Compute 1/(2r1) = 1/(2*6,571e3) =1/(13,142,000) ≈7.61e-8 m⁻¹.

1/(2r2)=1/(2*42,200,000)=1/84,400,000≈1.184e-8 m⁻¹.

Difference: 7.61e-8 -1.184e-8 =6.426e-8 m⁻¹.

Now, GMm=3.986e14 *1e4=3.986e18.

So 3.986e18 *6.426e-8 = ?

3.986 *6.426 = let's compute:

3 *6.426=19.278.

0.986 *6.426≈6.332.

Total ≈19.278 +6.332 =25.610.

So 25.610e(18-8)=25.61e10 =2.561e11 J.

So approximately 2.561e11 J.

Looking back at the options:

Option I is 2.57e11 J, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise calculations of the constants or rounding during intermediate steps.

Wait, but another thing: when moving to a higher orbit, the energy required is the difference between the final and initial energies. But wait, the initial mechanical energy is more negative than the final, so the energy needed is the difference E_final - E_initial. So that would be positive, which is what I computed.

Alternatively, I've heard that the formula for the energy required for a Hohmann transfer is the sum of the energy changes at perigee and apogee. Wait, but maybe I should approach it that way.

The Hohmann transfer involves two engine burns: first, an elliptical orbit with perigee at r
