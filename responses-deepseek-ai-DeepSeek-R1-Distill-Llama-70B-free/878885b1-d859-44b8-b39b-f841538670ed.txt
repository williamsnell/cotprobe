Okay, so I've got this question here about two statements related to neural networks, specifically VGGNets and AlexNet, and data initialization versus Batch Normalization. Hmm, I need to figure out if each statement is true, false, or not given.

Let me start by breaking down each statement one by one.

Statement 1 says that VGGNets have convolutional kernels of smaller width and height than AlexNet's first-layer kernels. I remember that AlexNet was one of the earlier big CNNs, and it used larger kernels, especially in the first layer. Like, I think AlexNet's first layer uses 11x11 kernels. VGGNets, on the other hand, are known for using smaller kernels, like 3x3, but they stack more layers. So yeah, the first layer of VGG probably has smaller kernels than AlexNet's. So Statement 1 should be True.

Now, Statement 2 claims that data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization. I recall that Batch Normalization was introduced by Ioffe and Szegedy in 2015. Before that, people were using various initialization methods. One common approach was Xavier initialization, which is data-dependent. Oh wait, and also Kaiming initialization, which I think came after or around the same time as Xavier. Wait, no, I think Xavier was earlier. So yes, data-dependent initializations like Xavier were around before Batch Norm. So Statement 2 is True as well.

Wait, but I should double-check. When was Xavier initialization introduced? I believe it was in a 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio. Yep, that's way before Batch Normalization. So Statement 2 is definitely True.

So both statements are True. Looking at the options, option C is "True, True." So the answer should be C.

Statement 1: VGGNets use smaller convolutional kernels compared to AlexNet's first-layer kernels. This is correct because AlexNet's first layer uses 11x11 kernels, while VGGNets typically use smaller 3x3 kernels.

Statement 2: Data-dependent weight initialization methods, such as Xavier initialization, were introduced before Batch Normalization. This is also correct, as Xavier initialization was introduced in 2010, while Batch Normalization came in 2015.

Both statements are true.

Answer: C
