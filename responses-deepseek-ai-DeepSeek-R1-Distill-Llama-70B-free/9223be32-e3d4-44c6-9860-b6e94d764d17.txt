Okay, so I have this problem here about gas volumes changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember something about gas laws from my chemistry class. Let me think. Oh right, Charles's Law! It says that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when the pressure is constant. So V1/T1 = V2/T2.

Wait, but wait. Oh yeah, the temperatures have to be in Kelvin, right? Because using Celsius might not work since it can go negative. So I need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.

The initial volume is 1200 cm³ at 27°C. So to get Kelvin, I add 273.15. Let me calculate that. 27 + 273.15 is 300.15 K. I'll just approximate it as 300 K for simplicity.

The final temperature is 127°C. Converting that to Kelvin: 127 + 273.15 is 400.15 K. Let's say 400 K.

Now, using Charles's Law. V1 is 1200 cm³, T1 is 300 K. V2 is what we're looking for, and T2 is 400 K. So the equation is:

V2 = V1 * (T2 / T1)

Plugging in the numbers: V2 = 1200 * (400 / 300). Let me compute that. 400 divided by 300 is 1.3333... So 1200 times 1.3333 is 1600 cm³. 

Let me check the options. Option H is 1600 cm³. So that's the answer. Wait, but wait a second—could I have made a mistake in the calculations? Let me double-check. 

Yes, 400 divided by 300 is indeed 4/3, so 1200 * 4/3 equals 1600. Yep, that's correct. So the volume should increase because the temperature is increasing, which makes sense because gases expand when heated at constant pressure.

To determine the volume of the gas at 127°C when the pressure is constant, we use Charles's Law, which states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature in Kelvin. The formula is:

\[
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \) (approximated as \( 300 \, \text{K} \)).
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = 127^\circ \text{C} = 127 + 273.15 = 400.15 \, \text{K} \) (approximated as \( 400 \, \text{K} \)).

### Step 2: Apply Charles's Law
Given \( V_1 = 1200 \, \text{cm}^3 \), \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_2 = 400 \, \text{K} \), we solve for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

\[
V_2 = 1200 \cdot \frac{400}{300} = 1200 \cdot 1.3333 = 1600 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 3: Verify the result
The calculation shows that the volume increases to \( 1600 \, \text{cm}^3 \) when the temperature rises from \( 27^\circ \text{C} \) to \( 127^\circ \text{C} \), which aligns with the expectation that gases expand with increasing temperature at constant pressure.

### Final Answer:
H: 1600 cm³
