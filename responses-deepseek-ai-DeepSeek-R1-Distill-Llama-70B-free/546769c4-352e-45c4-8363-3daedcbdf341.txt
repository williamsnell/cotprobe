Okay, so I have this question about Feinberg's claim on the best way to pursue happiness. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on philosophy, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to recall who Feinberg is. I think he's a philosopher who wrote about ethics and maybe some topics related to happiness and pleasure. Wait, wasn't there something about the paradox of hedonism? Oh right, I remember that concept. The idea is that if you directly pursue happiness, you might not find it, but if you focus on other things, happiness comes as a byproduct.

So, the question is asking what Feinberg claims is the best way to pursue happiness. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Strive for success. That sounds like it's focusing on achieving goals, but I'm not sure if Feinberg specifically ties success to happiness. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Pursue knowledge. Knowledge is more related to epistemology and maybe other philosophers like Aristotle, but not sure about Feinberg.

Option C: Pursue happiness. Wait, if the paradox of hedonism says that directly pursuing happiness doesn't work, then this might not be the right answer. Feinberg would probably say that pursuing happiness directly isn't effective.

Option D: Focus on material wealth. That seems more like Epicureanism, but I don't think Feinberg would say that material wealth is the key. Plus, materialism isn't typically the best route to genuine happiness.

Option E: None of the above. Hmm, maybe, but let's check the other options first.

Option F: Help others to be happy. Altruism can lead to happiness, but I'm not sure if Feinberg's main point is about helping others. The paradox is more about the approach to one's own happiness.

Option G: Forget about happiness. Oh, wait, that ties into the paradox. If you forget about seeking happiness and focus on other things, then happiness might come naturally. So this could be it.

Option H: Live in the moment. That's more of a mindfulness approach, which is great, but I'm not sure if Feinberg specifically advocates for that.

Option I: Avoid pain. That's a negative approach, and while avoiding pain can contribute to happiness, it's not the proactive pursuit method Feinberg might suggest.

Option J: Pursue pleasure. That's hedonism, which is the opposite of what the paradox suggests. Feinberg probably advises against this.

Putting it all together, Feinberg's argument is that directly pursuing happiness (option C) is counterproductive. So, instead, one should focus on other activities and let happiness come as a byproduct. The option that aligns with this is G: forget about happiness. Because if you stop trying so hard to be happy, you might actually achieve it.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the advice is to focus on things you enjoy rather than pursuing happiness itself. So maybe it's about not making happiness the goal. So option G makes sense because you're not directly chasing it.

Alternatively, maybe the best way is to pursue activities that bring intrinsic value, which would tie back to not directly pursuing happiness. So the answer would be G.

I think that's it. The correct answer should be G.

The question asks about Feinberg's claim on the best way to pursue happiness. Feinberg is associated with the paradox of hedonism, which suggests that directly pursuing happiness can be counterproductive. Instead, happiness often arises as a byproduct of focusing on other activities or goals. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, F, H, I, J** are not directly aligned with Feinberg's paradox of hedonism.
- **C** (pursue happiness) contradicts the paradox, as it advises against direct pursuit.
- **G** (forget about happiness) aligns with the paradox, as it suggests that focusing on other things rather than happiness itself can lead to happiness.

Thus, the best answer is **G: forget about happiness**.
