Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about producing chlorine from molten NaCl using electrolysis. Hmm, okay, I remember that electrolysis involves using electricity to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. The setup is probably something where NaCl is melted and then an electric current is passed through it. 

The question says the chemist uses a current of one amp for five minutes. I need to find out how many grams of chlorine could be produced. Let me think about the steps involved here.

First, I think I should recall Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Faraday's first law states that the amount of substance deposited at an electrode is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity used. The second law relates to the molar mass of the substances, where different substances are deposited with different efficiencies. 

So, the key here is to calculate the amount of charge passed, then use that to find moles of electrons, and from there find the moles of chlorine produced.

Right, the current is 1 amp, and time is 5 minutes. Wait, but time needs to be in seconds for the formula. Oh yeah, because 1 amp is 1 coulomb per second. So 5 minutes is 5 * 60 = 300 seconds.

So the charge Q is I * t. Q = 1 A * 300 s = 300 coulombs.

Next, Faraday's constant is about 96485 coulombs per mole of electrons. So the number of moles of electrons (n) is Q / F. n = 300 / 96485 ≈ 0.00311 moles of electrons.

Now, in the electrolysis of NaCl, the reaction at the anode (oxidation) is 2 Cl⁻ → Cl₂ ↑ + 2 e⁻. So for every mole of Cl₂ produced, 2 moles of electrons are released. Or wait, actually, it's the other way around. For each Cl₂ molecule, 2 electrons are needed. So moles of Cl₂ = moles of electrons / 2.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The reaction is 2 Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2 e⁻. So to produce one mole of Cl₂, two moles of electrons are lost (since each Cl⁻ loses one electron). So the number of moles of electrons needed per mole of Cl₂ is 2. So moles of Cl₂ = moles of electrons / 2.

Wait, but in this case, the electrons are being used in the reaction. So if I have moles of electrons, the moles of Cl₂ would be moles_e / 2.

So, moles of Cl₂ = 0.00311 / 2 ≈ 0.001555 moles.

Now, the molar mass of Cl₂ is 35.45 g/mol * 2 = 70.90 g/mol.

So mass = moles * molar mass = 0.001555 * 70.90 ≈ 0.1103 grams.

Looking at the options, E is 0.111g, which is very close. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but wait, I should check my calculations again to avoid mistakes. Let me go through each step.

Charge: 1 A * 300 s = 300 C. That's correct.

Moles of electrons: 300 / 96485 ≈ 0.00311. Correct.

Moles of Cl₂: 0.00311 / 2 = 0.001555 mol. Right.

Mass of Cl₂: 0.001555 *70.90= about 0.1103g, which is approximately 0.110g. The closest option is E: 0.111g. So yes, E must be the answer.

I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in the steps.

To determine how many grams of chlorine can be produced from molten NaCl using a current of 1 amp for 5 minutes, we apply Faraday's laws of electrolysis:

1. **Calculate the total charge (Q):**  
   Current (I) = 1 A, time (t) = 5 minutes = 300 seconds.  
   \[
   Q = I \cdot t = 1 \, \text{A} \cdot 300 \, \text{s} = 300 \, \text{C}
   \]

2. **Relate charge to moles of electrons:**  
   Faraday's constant (\(F\)) = 96485 C/mol of electrons.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of electrons} = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{300}{96485} \approx 0.00311 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Determine moles of chlorine (\(Cl_2\)):**  
   At the anode, the reaction is \(2Cl^- \to Cl_2 + 2e^-\). For every mole of \(Cl_2\) produced, 2 moles of electrons are required.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of } Cl_2 = \frac{\text{Moles of electrons}}{2} = \frac{0.00311}{2} \approx 0.001555 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Calculate the mass of chlorine:**  
   Molar mass of \(Cl_2\) = \(35.45 \, \text{g/mol} \cdot 2 = 70.90 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Mass of } Cl_2 = \text{Moles of } Cl_2 \cdot \text{Molar mass of } Cl_2 = 0.001555 \cdot 70.90 \approx 0.1103 \, \text{g}
   \]

5. **Compare with the options:**  
   The closest value to \(0.1103 \, \text{g}\) is \(0.111 \, \text{g}\), which corresponds to option **E**.

Thus, the chemist could produce approximately **0.111 g of chlorine** under the given conditions.
