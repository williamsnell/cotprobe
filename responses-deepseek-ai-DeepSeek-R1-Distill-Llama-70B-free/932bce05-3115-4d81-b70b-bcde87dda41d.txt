Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the heat of reaction for the combustion of methane. Hmm, I remember that the heat of reaction can be found using the heats of formation of the reactants and products. But wait, I need to make sure I get the signs right because I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.

The problem gives me the heats of formation for a few substances. Let me list them out:

1. C + 2H₂ → CH₄(g), ΔHf = 18,240 cal/g mol. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the way it's written, I think that's the formation reaction. So the heat of formation of CH4 is 18,240 cal/g·mol. Because that's the reaction forming CH4 from its elements, right? So ΔHf for CH4 is +18,240 cal/g·mol. Because the reaction is forming the compound, so it's endothermic if positive?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard heat of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So if the reaction is C + 2H2 → CH4, then the ΔHf is 18,240 cal/g·mol. So CH4's ΔHf is 18,240.

Next, C + O2 → CO2(g), ΔHf = 94,450 cal/g·mol. So CO2's heat of formation is 94,450.

Then, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O(l), ΔHf = 68,370. So H2O's heat of formation is (68,370 / 2) = 34,185 cal/g·mol? Because the reaction forms 2 moles, so per mole it's half.

Wait, no, no. Because the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O(l), so the ΔHf for H2O is 68,370 for 2 moles. So per mole, it's 34,185 cal/g·mol.

Wait, but actually, the way it's written, the ΔHf is given as 68,370 cal/g·mol for that reaction. So perhaps that's the total for two moles. So each mole of H2O has a ΔHf of 68,370 / 2 = 34,185 cal/g·mol. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, the question is the combustion of methane. Methane's combustion reaction is CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O. So I need to calculate the ΔH for this reaction.

The formula for ΔH of reaction is: sum of (ΔHf of products × their stoichiometric coefficients) minus sum of (ΔHf of reactants × their coefficients).

So, for each substance, I have to multiply their ΔHf by the number of moles in the reaction.

Wait, but wait: the reactants are CH4 and O2. O2 is in its standard state, right? So for elements in their standard state, their ΔHf is zero. Because that's the reference point. So O2(g) has ΔHf = 0.

So, let me write down the combustion reaction:

CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)

So the stoichiometric coefficients are 1 for CH4, 2 for O2, 1 for CO2, and 2 for H2O.

Now, the ΔH for the reaction is:

[ (1 mol × ΔHf of CO2) + (2 mol × ΔHf of H2O) ] - [ (1 mol × ΔHf of CH4) + (2 mol × ΔHf of O2) ]

But O2's ΔHf is zero, so the last term is zero.

So let's plug in the numbers.

ΔHf of CO2 is 94,450 cal/g·mol. So 1 × 94,450 = 94,450.

ΔHf of H2O is 34,185 cal/g·mol per mole, because earlier calculation. So 2 × 34,185 = 68,370.

So sum for products: 94,450 + 68,370 = let's add that. 94,450 + 68,370 = 162,820 cal.

Sum for reactants: 1 × 18,240 (CH4) + 2 × 0 (O2) = 18,240.

So ΔH_reaction = 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal.

Wait, but wait. Wait, because the combustion reaction is exothermic, right? So the ΔH should be negative. Because the system is releasing heat.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because in the calculation above, I have products minus reactants. So if that's positive, it's endothermic. But combustion is exothermic, so the ΔH should be negative.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is ΔH = sum(products) - sum(reactants). So if the products have a higher heat of formation than the reactants, it's endothermic. But in combustion, the products are more stable (lower energy), so their heat of formation is higher? Or wait, no.

Wait, the heat of formation is the heat absorbed when a compound is formed from elements. So for CH4, it's positive because you have to put in energy to form it from C and H2.

But when CH4 burns, it's forming CO2 and H2O, which have higher heats of formation. So their sum is higher than the reactants' sum. So products' sum is higher. So 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal. So the ΔH is positive, meaning the reaction is endothermic? That can't be right because combustion is exothermic.

Wait, I must have messed up the sign somewhere. Oh wait, no, I think I got it backwards. Because the formula is ΔH = sum(products) - sum(reactants). So in the case of combustion, the products have higher ΔHf, so the ΔH is positive, which would imply the reaction is endothermic. But that's not right.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The heat of formation is the heat change when a substance is formed from elements. So if you're decomposing something, it's the reverse.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it with the correct formula. The standard enthalpy change of reaction is given by:

ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) × moles - Σ ΔHf°(reactants) × moles.

So for the reaction CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O:

ΔH° = [ (1×ΔHf CO2) + (2×ΔHf H2O) ] - [ (1×ΔHf CH4) + (2×ΔHf O2) ]

O2 is zero, so it's [94,450 + 2×34,185] - [18,240 + 0]

Calculate 2×34,185 = 68,370.

So 94,450 + 68,370 = 162,820.

Subtract 18,240: 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal.

So that's positive. But that would mean the reaction is endothermic, which can't be right because combustion is exothermic.

Wait, what's wrong here. Oh wait, no. Wait, the heat of formation of CH4 is 18,240 cal/g·mol, which is the enthalpy change when methane is formed from C and H2. So when you form methane, you're putting energy into the system because it's positive.

But in the combustion reaction, you're breaking methane apart and forming CO2 and H2O. So the reaction is:

CH4 → C + 2H2; then C + O2 → CO2; 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O.

Wait, maybe I should write it as the reverse of the formation reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the heat of reaction for combustion is exothermic, so the value should be negative. But according to the calculation above, it's positive. So I'm probably making a mistake in the signs.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Let me check the formula again. The correct formula is:

ΔH° = sum (ΔHf° of products) - sum (ΔHf° of reactants).

So in this case, products are CO2 and H2O.

Reactants are CH4 and O2.

So, yes, the calculation is correct as 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal. So positive 144,580 cal, which would mean endothermic. But that contradicts what I know about combustion reactions.

Wait, wait, perhaps the given heat of formation for CH4 is negative? Because when methane is formed from its elements, is it exothermic or endothermic?

Wait, no. The heat of formation of methane is positive. Because it's the enthalpy change when it's formed from elements in their standard states. So if the reaction is C + 2H2 → CH4, and ΔHf is positive, that means it's endothermic. So forming methane requires energy input, which is unusual because typically forming bonds releases energy, so I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I got the reaction backward. Let me think: the standard heat of formation for CH4 is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of CH4 is formed from C(graphite) and H2(g) in their standard states.

So if the ΔHf is positive, that means it's endothermic. So it takes energy to form methane from graphite and H2. That seems odd because usually, forming a covalent bond releases energy, but maybe in this case, it's because graphite is a very stable form of carbon.

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the given ΔHf for CH4 is negative in reality. But according to the problem statement, it's 18,240 cal/g·mol, which is positive. So I have to proceed with that.

Wait, but then the ΔH for the combustion reaction is positive, which implies it's endothermic, but that can't be right. Combustion is exothermic.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me write the combustion reaction correctly.

Methane combustion is CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O(l).

So for each mole of CH4, we get 1 mole CO2 and 2 moles H2O.

So the products' ΔHf is (1×94,450) + (2×34,185) = 94,450 + 68,370 = 162,820.

The reactants are 1 mole CH4 (ΔHf=18,240) and 2 moles O2 (ΔHf=0 each). So sum for reactants: 18,240 + (2×0)=18,240.

So ΔH° = 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal. Which is positive, implying the reaction is endothermic, which is incorrect.

But wait, I must have made a mistake because combustion is exothermic, so ΔH should be negative. So perhaps I should reverse the calculation? Or perhaps the signs of the ΔHf are the other way.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The heat of reaction is the enthalpy change when the reaction occurs. If the products have lower enthalpy than the reactants, the reaction is exothermic.

So let me compute the sum of the products' ΔHf and the sum of the reactants' ΔHf.

Wait, the sum of products is higher, so the reaction is endothermic. But that contradicts what I know about combustion.

Wait, perhaps the given heat of formation for CH4 is negative? But no, the problem states it's 18,240 cal/g·mol, which is positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the heat of reaction as released, so the value would be negative of what I've calculated. So the ΔH would be -144,580 cal.

But wait, the options are all positive. So perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude, regardless of sign. So the heat of reaction is 144,580 cal per mole of CH4 combusted.

Looking at the options, option D is 144,580 cal/g·mol CH4.

So the correct answer is D.

To calculate the heat of reaction for the combustion of methane, we use the heats of formation provided for the reactants and products. The combustion reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

The formula for the standard enthalpy change of reaction is:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = \sum (\Delta H_f^\circ \text{ of products}) - \sum (\Delta H_f^\circ \text{ of reactants})
\]

### Step 1: Identify the heats of formation
- From the problem:
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CH}_4) = 18,240 \, \text{cal/g·mol}\)
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2) = 94,450 \, \text{cal/g·mol}\)
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = 34,185 \, \text{cal/g·mol}\) (calculated as \(\frac{68,370}{2}\))
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{O}_2) = 0 \, \text{cal/g·mol}\) (element in standard state)

### Step 2: Apply the formula
Using the stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced reaction:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = \left[ (1 \times \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2)) + (2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O})) \right] - \left[ (1 \times \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CH}_4)) + (2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{O}_2)) \right]
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = \left[ (1 \times 94,450) + (2 \times 34,185) \right] - \left[ (1 \times 18,240) + (2 \times 0) \right]
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculations
- Products:
  \[
  1 \times 94,450 = 94,450 \, \text{cal}
  \]
  \[
  2 \times 34,185 = 68,370 \, \text{cal}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total for products} = 94,450 + 68,370 = 162,820 \, \text{cal}
  \]

- Reactants:
  \[
  1 \times 18,240 = 18,240 \, \text{cal}
  \]
  \[
  2 \times 0 = 0 \, \text{cal}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total for reactants} = 18,240 + 0 = 18,240 \, \text{cal}
  \]

- Enthalpy change:
  \[
  \Delta H^\circ = 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 \, \text{cal}
  \]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The positive value indicates that the reaction is endothermic according to the calculation. However, combustion reactions are typically exothermic, so the negative of this value (\(-144,580 \, \text{cal}\)) represents the heat released. Since the question asks for the magnitude of the heat of reaction, the answer is:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = 144,580 \, \text{cal/g·mol CH}_4
\]

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**D: 144,580 cal/g·mol CH₄**

Answer: D
