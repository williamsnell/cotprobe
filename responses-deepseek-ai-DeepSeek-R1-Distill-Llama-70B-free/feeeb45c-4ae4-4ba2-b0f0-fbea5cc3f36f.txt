Question:

A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, "Study this, baby!" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

Options:

A: Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.
B: Attempted violation of the statute.
C: Both indecent exposure and attempted violation of the statute.
D: Both trespassing and attempted violation of the statute.
E: Both burglary and indecent exposure.
F: Trespassing only.
G: Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.
H: Indecent exposure only.
I: Both burglary and trespassing.

Okay, so I've got this question here about criminal law, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a student who's a prankster. He likes to do zany things, like walking around campus in a raincoat and boxers, and flashing people. He thinks he's committing a crime by doing this, but in this jurisdiction, it's a felony to expose oneself in the nude. The twist is that what he's doing isn't a crime because, I guess, he's not actually nude—just in his shorts. So maybe the law requires being completely naked or something.

One night, he breaks into a sorority house intending to flash the sisters. He's wearing his raincoat and shorts when he enters a sister's bedroom. The sister knows him and asks him what he's doing there. He takes off his raincoat, exposing his shorts, and says something like "Study this, baby!" Then he runs around the house in his shorts. The police come and arrest him.

The question is, what crime(s) is he guilty of, if any? The options are combinations of burglary, attempted violation of the statute, indecent exposure, trespassing, etc.

First, I need to consider the elements of each crime mentioned.

Starting with burglary. Burglary typically involves unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. So, the student broke into the sorority house. But what was his intent? His plan was to flash the sisters. But in this jurisdiction, flashing isn't a crime because he's not nude. So, the intended crime isn't actually a crime. Hmm, does that affect the burglary charge?

Wait, but burglary requires the intent to commit a felony at the time of entry. If the act he intended (flashing) isn't a felony, then maybe he didn't have the intent to commit a felony. So, perhaps he didn't commit burglary because the intended act isn't a crime. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Some jurisdictions might consider the intent to commit any crime, not necessarily a felony. Or maybe it depends on whether the intended act would be a crime, regardless of whether it actually is. Wait, no, because if the intended act isn't a crime, then the intent isn't to commit an unlawful act, so burglary wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, maybe the student thought he was committing a crime, but that's not relevant. Burglary is about the actual intent, not the defendant's belief. So if the intended act isn't a crime, then there's no burglary.

Next, attempted violation of the statute. The statute makes it a felony to expose oneself in the nude. But the student wasn't nude; he was in shorts. So, he didn't actually violate the statute. Did he attempt to? Attempt requires that he took a substantial step towards committing the crime, with the intent to do so.

But the crime here is flashing in the nude. He thought he was committing a crime by flashing in boxers, but actually, it's not. So when he took off his raincoat, he was in shorts. So, he didn't expose himself nude. Therefore, he didn't commit the crime, but did he attempt it?

Wait, but the statute requires exposure in the nude. He wasn't nude, so he didn't commit the crime. But did he think he was? His belief might not matter here. For attempt, the intent is to commit the crime as defined. So, if he intended to expose himself in the nude, but didn't actually do so, then he could be guilty of attempt. But in this case, he only exposed himself in shorts. So maybe he didn't take a substantial step towards the crime of nude exposure. Or perhaps his actions were towards a different act, not the actual crime.

Alternatively, maybe he only intended to expose himself in his boxers, which isn't a crime. So he didn't have the intent to commit the crime under the statute. Therefore, he didn't attempt it either.

Next, indecent exposure. The question is, does his action count as indecent exposure? But the jurisdiction's law makes it a felony to expose oneself in the nude. Since he wasn't nude, perhaps indecent exposure isn't applicable either. Unless there's a different law about indecent exposure that doesn't require being nude. But the question says that the statute is about exposing in the nude, so maybe indecent exposure in this scenario isn't a separate crime. Or perhaps the jurisdiction has a broader definition of indecent exposure. But the question doesn't specify that, so I think we have to go with what's given.

Then there's trespassing. The student broke into the sorority house, which is trespassing. Trespassing is generally entering someone else's property without permission. So, yes, he trespassed. But the options don't include just trespassing alone except option F, which is trespassing only. But we also have to consider if he committed other crimes.

Wait, the options include combinations. So, let's look at the options.

Option A: Neither burglary nor attempted violation. So if he didn't commit burglary and didn't attempt the statute violation, this could be possible. But we know he did trespass.

Option B: Attempted violation only.

Option C: Both indecent exposure and attempted violation. But if indecent exposure isn't a crime here, then no.

Option D: Both trespassing and attempted violation. If attempted violation applies, maybe. But earlier I thought attempted might not apply.

Option E: Both burglary and indecent exposure. But burglary may not apply because the intended crime wasn't a felony.

Option F: Trespassing only.

Option G: Both burglary and attempted violation. Again, if burglary doesn't apply, this is out.

Option H: Indecent exposure only. Unlikely, as per the statute.

Option I: Both burglary and trespassing. Burglary unlikely, so probably not.

So, let's reevaluate. The student broke into the house, so that's trespassing. But did he commit burglary? Burglary is usually breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. His intent was to flash, which isn't a crime, so no felony intent. Thus, no burglary. So, he's guilty of trespassing.

But wait, when he entered, he intended to flash, but that's not a crime, so no burglary. Then, once inside, he did expose himself in his shorts, but that's not indecent exposure under the statute, so no crime there. So, he only committed trespassing. So the answer would be F: Trespassing only.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me think about the elements again.

Burglary: unlawful entry with intent to commit a felony inside. The felony would have to be the flashing, but since that's not a crime, the intent isn't to commit a felony. So, no burglary.

Attempt: requires specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step. The crime is exposing in the nude. He didn't expose in the nude, so he didn't complete the crime. Did he take a step towards it? He went into the house intending to expose, but only exposed in shorts. So maybe he didn't take a step towards the actual crime of nude exposure. So, no attempt.

Trespassing: yes, he entered without permission.

So, the only crime is trespassing. So the answer is F: Trespassing only.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is "Trespassing only." Let me check if that's one of the options. Yes, option F.

So, the student is guilty of trespassing only.

The student in this scenario engaged in several actions that could potentially implicate various crimes. To determine the appropriate charges, each crime must be analyzed based on its legal elements and the facts provided.

1. **Burglary**: Burglary typically requires unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. The student broke into the sorority house, but his intent was to flash the sisters. However, flashing in this jurisdiction is only a crime if done in the nude, and the student was wearing shorts. Since his intended act (flashing in shorts) is not a crime, he did not have the intent to commit a felony. Therefore, burglary does not apply.

2. **Attempted Violation of the Statute**: Attempt requires the intent to commit a crime and a substantial step toward its commission. The statute criminalizes exposing oneself in the nude, but the student was not nude—he was wearing shorts. Thus, he did not take a substantial step toward committing the crime of nude exposure. As a result, attempted violation of the statute does not apply.

3. **Indecent Exposure**: The jurisdiction's statute specifically criminalizes exposure in the nude. Since the student was not nude, his actions do not meet the definition of indecent exposure under the given statute. Therefore, indecent exposure does not apply.

4. **Trespassing**: Trespassing involves unlawful entry onto someone else's property without permission. The student broke into the sorority house, which clearly constitutes trespassing. This is the only crime supported by the facts.

Given this analysis, the student is guilty of trespassing only. None of the other crimes—burglary, attempted violation of the statute, or indecent exposure—apply based on the facts and the legal definitions provided.
