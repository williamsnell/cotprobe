Okay, so I need to figure out the interest rate George Mason is paying on his grand piano purchase. Let me try to understand the problem first.

He bought a piano for $8,650. He made a down payment of $1,000, so the amount he financed is $8,650 minus $1,000, which is $7,650. He's paying this off in 20 equal monthly installments of $425 each. I need to find the interest rate he's paying, and round it to the nearest tenth of a percent.

Hmm, this sounds like an installment loan problem. I remember that these can be solved using the present value of an annuity formula. The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) on an installment loan is:

PMT = [ P * r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

Where:
PMT = monthly payment
P = principal (amount financed)
r = monthly interest rate (unknown)
n = number of payments

I can rearrange this formula to solve for r, but I don't remember the exact rearrangement. Alternatively, I can use trial and error by plugging in the options given and seeing which one comes closest to the monthly payment of $425.

Wait, the options are annual interest rates, so I'll need to convert them to monthly rates by dividing by 12 each time.

Let me list out the steps I'll take:

1. Determine the principal (P) which is $7,650.
2. The monthly payment (PMT) is $425.
3. The number of payments (n) is 20 months.
4. I need to find the interest rate (r) per month.

Let me try each option to see which gives a PMT closest to $425.

Starting with option A: 12.7% annual. So the monthly rate is 12.7% / 12 = 0.01058333.

Plugging into the PMT formula:

PMT = [7,650 * 0.01058333 * (1 + 0.01058333)^20 ] / [ (1 + 0.01058333)^20 - 1 ]

Wait, calculating (1 + 0.01058333)^20. Let me compute that. Let me approximate:

Each month r is about 1.058%. Let me see, (1.01058333)^20. Since 20 is a small exponent, maybe around 1.25 or so. Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the present value formula. The present value (PV) is P, which is 7,650. The PMT is 425. So the PV of the payments should equal 7,650.

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

So 7,650 = 425 * [1 - (1 + r)^-20 ] / r

I can rearrange this to solve for r, but it's tricky algebraically. So perhaps using trial and error with the given options is better.

Let me try option A: 12.7% annually. So r = 12.7/1200 ≈ 0.01058333 per month.

Compute denominator: [ (1 + r)^20 - 1 ]

Compute numerator: 7,650 * r.

Wait, the denominator in the PMT formula is the same as the denominator in the PV formula, which is [ (1+r)^20 -1 ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the denominator for each rate and see if the payment matches.

Alternatively, I can compute the present value of the payments for each rate and see which one equals 7,650.

Let me try this approach.

Option A: 12.7% annual. So monthly r = 0.01058333.

Compute the present value factor for 20 periods at this rate:

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

So n=20, r=0.01058333.

Calculate (1 + 0.01058333)^20.

Let me compute step by step:

Take r = 0.01058333.

(1 + r) = 1.01058333.

Raise to 20th power. Let me compute it approximately.

Using the formula (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) for small r, but maybe not accurate here. Alternatively, compute step by step.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach, but since I don't have one, I'll make an estimate.

But perhaps I can compute it as follows:

(1.01058333)^20 ≈ Let's compute it as (1.0105)^20.

I know that (1.01)^20 is approximately 1.22019. Since 0.0105 is a bit higher than 0.01, the result will be a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps 1.0105^20 ≈ about 1.24.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

But perhaps I should compute (1.01058333)^20:

Using the rule that ln(1.01058333) ≈ 0.01053 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x). So ln(PVIFA base) is 0.01053, multiplied by 20 gives 0.2106. Then e^0.2106 ≈ 1.234.

So (1.01058333)^20 ≈ 1.234. Therefore, (1.01058333)^20 ≈ 1.234.

So (1.01058333)^-20 ≈ 1/1.234 ≈ 0.810.

So the numerator in PVIFA is 1 - 0.810 = 0.190.

Divide by r: 0.190 / 0.01058333 ≈ 17.96.

So PVIFA ≈ 17.96.

Then the present value of payments is 425 * 17.96 ≈ 425 * 18 ≈ 7,650. Wait, 425 * 17.96 is approximately 7,636, which is close to 7,650. So the present value is about 7,636, which is a bit less than 7,650. So the interest rate might be a bit lower than 12.7% annually.

Wait, but wait a second. Because PV is 7,650, and with 12.7%, the present value is 7,636, which is 14 less. So maybe the rate is a bit lower than 12.7%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation of (1.01058333)^20.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me try option J: 11.2% annual. So monthly r is 0.00933333.

Calculate (1.00933333)^20.

Again, using ln(1.00933333) ≈ 0.00927 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + ...). So 0.00927 * 20 = 0.1854. e^0.1854 ≈ 1.203.

So (1.00933333)^20 ≈ 1.203. Therefore, (1.00933333)^-20 ≈ 0.832.

So the numerator in PVIFA is 1 - 0.832 = 0.168.

Divide by r: 0.168 / 0.00933333 ≈ 18.00.

So PVIFA is approximately 18. So present value of payments is 425 * 18 = 7,650. Exactly matching the principal.

Wait, that's perfect. So the present value is exactly 7,650 when using 11.2% annual rate, which would mean that's the correct rate.

Wait, but that would mean option J is correct. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems too straightforward.

Wait, if the monthly rate is 0.00933333 (11.2% /12 = 0.00933333), then:

Let me calculate (1.00933333)^20 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better estimation method.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for compound interest more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula in the PVIFA calculation.

Wait, let me think again.

The present value of the payments is $7,650, which is the same as the amount financed. So, using the PVIFA formula:

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

At 11.2% annual rate, r = 0.00933333 per month.

So let me compute (1 + 0.00933333)^20.

(1.00933333)^1 = 1.00933333

^2 = 1.00933333 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.01878

^4 ≈ (1.01878)^2 ≈ 1.0377

^8 ≈ (1.0377)^2 ≈ 1.0773

^16 ≈ (1.0773)^2 ≈ 1.1613

Now, since we need ^20, which is ^16 * ^4.

So 1.1613 * 1.0377 ≈ approx 1.1613 * 1.0377.

Compute 1.1613 * 1 = 1.1613.

1.1613 * 0.0377 ≈ approx 0.0438.

So total is approx 1.2051.

Wait, so (1.00933333)^20 ≈ 1.2051.

So (1.00933333)^-20 ≈ 1 / 1.2051 ≈ 0.8295.

So the numerator is 1 - 0.8295 = 0.1705.

Divide by r: 0.1705 / 0.00933333 ≈ 18.28.

So PVIFA ≈ 18.28.

Thus, PV of payments is 425 * 18.28 ≈ 425 * 18 = 7,650 plus 425 * 0.28 = 118.5, so total ≈7,768.5. Wait, that's way higher than 7,650. That can't be right.

Wait, that's not possible because 425 * 18.28 is more than 7,650. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.00933333)^20.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation.

Wait, let me compute (1.00933333)^20 more accurately using logarithms.

Take natural log: ln(1.00933333) ≈ 0.00927.

Multiply by 20: 0.1854.

Exponentiate: e^0.1854 ≈ 1.203.

So (1.00933333)^20 ≈ 1.203.

So (1.00933333)^-20 ≈ 0.832.

So 1 - 0.832 = 0.168.

Divide by 0.00933333: 0.168 / 0.00933333 ≈ 18.00.

So PVIFA = 18.00.

So PV of payments: 425 * 18 = 7,650, which matches exactly. So that would imply that option J (11.2%) is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier when I tried 12.7%, I got a present value of approximately 7,636, which is lower than 7,650. So the actual rate must be lower than 12.7%, which supports option J being correct.

But wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake in my approach. Because when I tried 11.2%, the present value of the payments equals exactly the principal, which would imply that there's no interest. But that can't be right.

Wait, no, because the PVIFA calculation includes the interest. If the present value of the payments equals the principal, that would mean that the interest rate used to discount the payments is correct. So, if the present value is exactly $7,650, that's the amount he needs to pay, so 11.2% would be the correct rate.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I tried 12.7%, I got a present value lower than 7,650, implying that the rate is lower than that. So perhaps 11.2% is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong because I'm using the wrong formula. Let me double-check the present value formula.

The formula is PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So, if PV is 7,650, PMT is 425, n=20, then solving for r.

Alternatively, let me try using a different approach. Let's compute the total amount paid and see the total interest, then compute the rate.

Total payments: 20 * 425 = 8,500.

Amount financed: 7,650.

Total interest: 8,500 - 7,650 = 850.

So he paid $850 in total interest over 20 months.

But to compute the interest rate, perhaps using the rule of 78 or simple interest, but I think it's more likely an installment loan with amortized payments.

Wait, but in an installment loan, each payment includes both principal and interest. So the interest isn't simply the total paid minus principal. So the total interest can't be directly calculated that way because each payment's interest portion decreases as principal is paid down.

So perhaps the better approach is to stick with the present value method.

Wait, earlier calculations with 11.2% gave me a PV of exactly 7,650, which matches the principal. So that suggests that 11.2% is the correct rate. But let me check another option to make sure.

For example, option G is 14.9% annually. So monthly r is 14.9/1200 = 0.012416667.

Compute (1 + 0.01241667)^20.

Let me compute this:

Using logarithms:

ln(1.01241667) ≈ 0.0123.

Multiply by 20: 0.246.

e^0.246 ≈ 1.278.

So (1.01241667)^20 ≈ 1.278.

Thus, (1.01241667)^-20 ≈ 0.782.

Numerator: 1 - 0.782 = 0.218.

Divide by r: 0.218 / 0.01241667 ≈ 17.57.

So PVIFA ≈ 17.57.

Then, PV of payments: 425 * 17.57 ≈ 425 * 17 = 7,225 plus 425 * 0.57 ≈ 242.25. Total ≈7,467.25, which is less than 7,650. So at 14.9%, the PV is 7,467, which is lower than needed. So the rate must be lower than 14.9%.

Similarly, let's check option A: 12.7%.

r = 0.01058333.

Compute (1.01058333)^20: as before, approximately 1.234.

So (1.01058333)^-20 ≈ 0.810.

Numerator: 1 - 0.810 = 0.190.

Divide by r: 0.190 / 0.01058333 ≈ 17.96.

PVIFA ≈17.96.

PV of payments: 425 *17.96 ≈7,636, which is close to 7,650. So at 12.7%, PV is ~7,636, which is less than 7,650. So the actual rate must be a little lower than 12.7%.

Wait, but earlier with 11.2%, the PV was exactly 7,650, which would suggest that 11.2% is correct. But I'm confused because the total interest would be lower, but I think that's how the math works.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation with 11.2%. Let me double-check.

At 11.2% annual, monthly rate is 0.00933333.

Compute (1.00933333)^20:

Using more accurate calculation:

Let me compute it step by step.

1.00933333^1 = 1.00933333

^2 = 1.00933333 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.01878

^3 ≈ 1.01878 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.02815

^4 ≈ 1.02815 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.03764

^5 ≈ 1.03764 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.0473

^6 ≈ 1.0473 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.05699

^7 ≈ 1.05699 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.06685

^8 ≈ 1.06685 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.07686

^9 ≈ 1.07686 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.08696

^10 ≈ 1.08696 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.09714

^11 ≈ 1.09714 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.1074

^12 ≈ 1.1074 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.11776

^13 ≈ 1.11776 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.12825

^14 ≈ 1.12825 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.13884

^15 ≈ 1.13884 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.14956

^16 ≈ 1.14956 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.16042

^17 ≈ 1.16042 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.17143

^18 ≈ 1.17143 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.18267

^19 ≈ 1.18267 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.19412

^20 ≈ 1.19412 * 1.00933333 ≈ 1.2056

So after 20 months, (1.00933333)^20 ≈ 1.2056.

Thus, (1.00933333)^-20 ≈ 1 / 1.2056 ≈ 0.8295.

So numerator is 1 - 0.8295 = 0.1705.

Divide by r: 0.1705 / 0.00933333 ≈ 18.28.

So PVIFA ≈18.28.

Then, PV of payments is 425 * 18.28 ≈ 7,768.

Wait, that's more than 7,650, which doesn't match. So earlier conclusion must have been wrong. So perhaps my initial calculation was wrong.

Wait, so perhaps 11.2% isn't correct. Let me try again.

Wait, when I calculated (
