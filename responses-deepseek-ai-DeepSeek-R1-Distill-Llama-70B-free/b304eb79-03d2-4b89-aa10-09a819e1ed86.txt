Question:

When it comes to STATISTICAL DECISION-MAKING, rejecting a false null is the goal of most researches. From your knowledge about TYPE I ERROR, which statement out of the following ones is about it?

Options:

A: null hypothesis is accepted, but it is false
B: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .01 or .05
C: graphically→ white is retention area and black is rejected area
D: probability of making a Beta Level error
E: null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true
F: null hypothesis is accepted, and it is true
G: null hypothesis is not rejected, but it is false
H: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .10 or .20
I: graphically→ black is retention area and white is rejected area

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about statistical decision-making and Type I errors. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is about Type I error. I remember that in hypothesis testing, there are two main types of errors: Type I and Type II. Type I is when you reject a null hypothesis that's actually true, right? So that's a false positive. Type II is the opposite, failing to reject a null when it's actually false, a false negative.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that describes Type I error. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Null hypothesis is accepted, but it's false. Wait, that sounds like a Type II error. Because Type II is when you fail to reject a false null. So A is not the right choice.

Option B: Level of significance set by researcher at .01 or .05. I think that's about alpha, the significance level, which is the probability of Type I error. So B is talking about alpha, not the error itself. So not the answer.

Option C: Graphically, white is retention area, black is rejected. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think the rejection area is where the test statistic leads us to reject the null. Usually, it's the tails. If the graph has black as rejected, maybe that's correct. But wait, the question is about Type I error, which is related to the rejection area because that's where Type I errors can occur. But does this option describe Type I error? I'm not sure. It's more about the graph than the error itself.

Option D: Probability of making a Beta Level error. Beta is the probability of Type II error, so this isn't Type I. Plus, the term 'Beta Level error' isn't something I'm familiar with. Maybe it's a typo and should be Type II error? Either way, D doesn't describe Type I.

Option E: Null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true. Oh, that sounds exactly like Type I error. Rejecting a true null. So E is a strong candidate.

Option F: Null is accepted and it's true. That's correct decision, not an error. So no.

Option G: Null is not rejected, but it's false. That's Type II error, so not E.

Option H: Significance level at .10 or .20. Again, this is about alpha, not the error itself. So not the answer.

Option I: Graphically, black is retention, white is rejected. Wait, in some graphs, the rejection region is usually a smaller area, like the tails. But I'm not certain about the colors. But again, this is about the graph, not the error definition.

So putting it all together, the correct statement about Type I error is Option E: Null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true. So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E. Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. This is a false positive and directly aligns with the definition of a Type I error.

Answer: E
