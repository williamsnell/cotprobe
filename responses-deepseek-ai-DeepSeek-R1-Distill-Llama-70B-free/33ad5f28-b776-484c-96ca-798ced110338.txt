Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I need to find the sample size n for a 90% confidence interval. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that we have two independent random samples, both of size n. Their means are X̄ and Ȳ. We want the interval X̄ - Ȳ ± 4 to be a 90% confidence interval for the difference in population means, μ_X - μ_Y. The standard deviations are given as σ_X = 15 and σ_Y = 25.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with confidence intervals for the difference of two means, especially when the population variances are known and samples are independent, we use a formula involving the z-score. Since the samples are large or the population is normally distributed, the Central Limit Theorem applies, right?

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the sample size as large, but since we're given standard deviations and probably using a z-interval, maybe we can proceed under the assumption that it's a large sample or the populations are normal. Anyway, the formula for the confidence interval for the difference in means should be:

(X̄ - Ȳ) ± z*(σ_X²/n + σ_Y²/n)^(1/2)

But wait, wait, wait. Oh, no, no, the standard error is sqrt(σ_X²/n + σ_Y²/n), right? Because it's the standard error of the difference in means.

The confidence interval is given as (X̄ - Ȳ) ± 4. So the margin of error (ME) is 4. The formula for ME is z * sqrt(σ_X²/n + σ_Y²/n). So I can set up the equation:

z * sqrt( (15² + 25²)/n ) = 4

Wait, because σ_X² is 225 and σ_Y² is 625. So adding them gives 850.

So sqrt(850/n) is the standard error part. Then multiply by z to get ME.

I need to find n. Let me rearrange this equation.

First, I need the z-score for a 90% confidence interval. Since it's a two-tailed test, the confidence level is 90%, so the alpha is 0.10. So each tail has 0.05. The z-score corresponding to 0.95 cumulative probability is about 1.645. Wait, no, wait. The standard z-table for 90% confidence: the critical value is 1.645 for one tail? Or wait, wait a second, no. Wait, for a 90% confidence interval, the total area in the tails is 10%, so 5% in each tail. So the z-score that leaves 5% in the upper tail is 1.645.

Wait, no, wait, let me think again. I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's 1.96 for 95% confidence. Oh wait, wait! 90% confidence is 1 - alpha = 0.90, so alpha is 0.10. So each tail is 0.05. So the z-score is 1.645. Because 95% of the data is within 1.645 standard deviations from the mean in each tail. Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me think: for the 90% confidence interval, the z-score is 1.645. Because, for example, 95% CI uses 1.96, 99% uses 2.576.

Yes, so z is 1.645.

So back to the equation:

ME = z * sqrt( (σ_X² + σ_Y²)/n )

We have ME = 4.

So,

4 = 1.645 * sqrt( (15² + 25²)/n )

Compute 15 squared: 225, 25 squared: 625. Sum is 850.

So,

4 = 1.645 * sqrt(850 / n )

I can square both sides to get rid of the square root.

4² = (1.645)² * (850 / n )

16 = (2.706) * (850 / n )

Wait, let me compute 1.645 squared. 1.645 * 1.645. Let me compute that:

1.6 *1.6 = 2.56, 0.045*1.6=0.072, 0.045^2=0.002. Alternatively, 1.645^2: 1.645 * 1.645.

Let me compute 1.645 * 1.645:

1.6 * 1.6 = 2.56.

1.6 * 0.045 = 0.072.

0.045 * 1.6 = 0.072.

0.045 * 0.045 = 0.002025.

So adding them: 2.56 + 0.072 + 0.072 + 0.002025.

Wait wait no, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute it more carefully.

(1.645)^2 = (1 + 0.645)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.645 + (0.645)^2.

Which is 1 + 1.29 + 0.416025 = 2.706025. So approximately 2.706.

So back to the equation:

16 = 2.706 * (850 / n )

I can rearrange to solve for n.

Divide both sides by 2.706:

16 / 2.706 = 850 / n

Compute 16 / 2.706.

Let me see: 2.706 * 5 = 13.53; 16-13.53=2.47.

2.706 * 0.9 = 2.4354. So 5.9 gives 13.53 + 2.4354 = 15.9654, which is close to 16.

Wait, 2.706 * 5.905 ≈16.

Let me compute 2.706 * 5.905: Let's see, 2.706 * 5 = 13.53, 2.706 *0.9=2.4354, 2.706 *0.005=0.01353. So total is approx 13.53 + 2.4354 = 15.9654 + 0.01353= 15.9789. Close to 16. So 16/2.706 ≈5.91.

So 5.91 ≈850 /n → n =850 /5.91 ≈ 143.95.

So n is approximately 144. Looking at the options, option B is 144.

To determine the sample size \( n \) for a 90% confidence interval where the margin of error (ME) is 4, we use the formula for the confidence interval of the difference in means:

\[
\text{ME} = z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2}{n}}
\]

Given:
- \( \sigma_X = 15 \), so \( \sigma_X^2 = 225 \)
- \( \sigma_Y = 25 \), so \( \sigma_Y^2 = 625 \)
- \( \text{ME} = 4 \)
- The z-score for a 90% confidence interval is \( z = 1.645 \) (since 5% is in each tail).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
4 = 1.645 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{225 + 625}{n}}
\]

Simplify \( \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 = 850 \):

\[
4 = 1.645 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{850}{n}}
\]

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
16 = (1.645)^2 \cdot \frac{850}{n}
\]

Compute \( (1.645)^2 \approx 2.706 \):

\[
16 = 2.706 \cdot \frac{850}{n}
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{2.706 \cdot 850}{16}
\]

Compute \( 2.706 \cdot 850 = 2299.1 \), then divide by 16:

\[
n \approx \frac{2299.1}{16} \approx 143.95
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number, giving \( n = 144 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is **B: 144**.
