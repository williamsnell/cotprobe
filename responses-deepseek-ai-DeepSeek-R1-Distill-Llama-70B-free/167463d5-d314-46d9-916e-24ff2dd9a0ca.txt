Okay, so I need to estimate the PEG ratio for this firm. Hmm, let me remember what PEG ratio is. Oh right, PEG stands for Price/Earnings to Growth ratio. It's calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate. So PEG = (P/E) / (Growth Rate).

Wait, but I think there's a specific way to calculate it, especially when there are two stages of growth involved. Oh right, this company has high growth for the first five years and then a stable growth phase after that. So I probably need to calculate the present value of the dividends and the terminal value, then find the price per share and the earnings per share to get the P/E ratio.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I need to find the expected earnings per share for the first five years and beyond. But wait, the problem doesn't give me the current earnings. Oh wait, maybe I can assume a hypothetical current EPS at time zero. Let's say E0 is $1. That might make the calculations easier because it's a relative ratio.

So E0 is $1. The growth rate in the first five years is 25%, so each year's EPS will grow by 25%. But wait, the payout ratio is 20% during the first five years. That means the firm pays out 20% of its earnings as dividends and retains 80%. Retained earnings would then fuel the growth, but wait, the growth rate is already given as 25%, so maybe we don't need to calculate that separately.

Wait, the growth rate is given, so we can directly use that to find future earnings. So for each of the first five years, EPS will be E0*(1+g)^t, where g is 25%, and t is the year number.

But since we're calculating the value of the firm, we need to find the dividends and the terminal value. The dividend in each year is payout ratio multiplied by EPS that year. So D1 = E0*(1+g)^1 * payout ratio. Similarly for D2 to D5.

After five years, the growth drops to 8% indefinitely. So from year 5 onwards, the growth is 8%, and the payout ratio is 50%. So for year 5, the EPS would be E0*(1.25)^5, and the dividend D5 is 50% of the EPS at that point, but wait no—wait, no, the payout ratio during the first five years is 20%, so D5 would be 20% of E5, but after that, the payout is 50% of the EPS in year 6 and beyond.

Wait, no, actually, the payout ratio changes after five years. So during the first five years, the payout is 20%, and after that, it's 50%. So for each of the first five years, D1 to D5, it's 20% of E1 to E5. Then, from year 6 onwards, it's 50% of each year's EPS, but since the growth is 8% indefinitely, we can use the Gordon Growth Model for the terminal value at year 5.

So the process is:

1. Find the dividends for each of the first five years.

2. Find the terminal value at year 5, which is the value of all dividends from year 6 onwards.

3. Calculate the present value of all these dividends and the terminal value.

4. The sum is the current price per share (assuming we started with E0 = $1).

5. Then, find the P/E ratio by dividing the price by E0 (which is $1, so P/E is just the price).

6. Then, compute the PEG ratio by dividing the P/E by the growth rate. But wait, which growth rate? The high growth rate or the stable rate?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. The PEG ratio is typically used for companies with high growth. So maybe the growth rate used is the high growth rate for the first five years, which is 25%. Because after that, the growth is lower.

Alternatively, I think in the PEG ratio calculation, the growth rate used is the expected long-term growth rate, but in this case, the high growth is just for five years. Hmm. Or perhaps it's the growth rate that the market expects, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the standard approach is to use the growth rate during the high growth phase. So for the PEG ratio, we'd use 25%.

Wait, but maybe it's better to calculate the earnings growth rate beyond the first five years. Let me think again. No, the PEG ratio is (P/E) / (growth rate), and the growth rate here is the one that's expected indefinitely, I think. So after five years, the growth is 8%. But wait, the PEG ratio is usually for the next year's expected growth, so maybe the 25%? Or perhaps it's the average or some sort of weighted average.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the calculations step by step.

First, let me outline the data:

- High growth period (first five years): 25% growth, payout 20%.

- After five years: 8% growth, payout 50%.

- Beta = 1.0, risk-free rate = 6%, market risk premium = 5.5%. So cost of equity is 6% + 1*5.5% = 11.5%.

So the discount rate is 11.5%.

Now, let's assume E0 = $1.

Then, the dividends for each year from 1 to 5 would be:

D1 = E0 * (1.25)^1 * 0.20 = 1*1.25*0.2 = $0.25

D2 = 1*(1.25)^2 *0.2 = 1.5625 *0.2 = 0.3125

D3 = 1*(1.25)^3 *0.2 = 1.953125 *0.2 = 0.390625

D4 = 1*(1.25)^4 *0.2 = 2.44140625 *0.2 = 0.48828125

D5 = 1*(1.25)^5 *0.2 = 3.0517578125 *0.2 = 0.6103515625

Wait, but wait, the payout ratio during the first five years is 20%, so the dividends are 20% of each year's earnings. Earnings each year are E0*(1.25)^t, so D1 to D5 are as above.

Now, the terminal value at year 5 is the value of all dividends from year 6 onwards. To calculate this, we can use the Gordon Growth Model, which is D6 / (r - g), where D6 is the dividend in year 6, r is the required return (11.5%), and g is the growth rate after year 5 (8%).

But wait, D6 is the dividend in year 6, which is based on the payout ratio of 50% times the earnings in year 6.

Earnings in year 6 would be E5 * (1 + 8%), since after year 5, the growth is 8%. E5 is E0*(1.25)^5 = 3.0517578125.

So E6 = 3.0517578125 * 1.08 = let's calculate that:

3.0517578125 * 1.08:

3 *1.08 = 3.24, 0.0517578125 *1.08 ≈ 0.0559. So total ≈ 3.24 + 0.0559 ≈ 3.2959.

Wait, more accurately, 3.0517578125 * 1.08:

3.0517578125 * 1.08 = 3.29585009765625.

So E6 ≈ 3.2958501.

Then, D6 = E6 * 50% = 3.2958501 * 0.5 ≈ 1.64792505.

So the terminal value at year 5 is D6 / (r - g) = 1.64792505 / (0.115 - 0.08) = 1.64792505 / 0.035.

Calculating that: 1.64792505 ÷ 0.035.

Well, 1.6479 / 0.035 ≈ let's see. 0.035 * 47 = 1.645. So approximately 47.0857.

Wait, 0.035 *47 = 1.645, which is 1.6479 - 1.645 = 0.0029 remaining. So 0.0029 / 0.035 ≈ 0.083. So total is 47.083.

So terminal value at year 5 is approximately 47.083.

Now, we need to find the present value of D1 to D5 and the terminal value.

So, the cash flows are:

Year 1: 0.25

Year 2: 0.3125

Year 3: 0.390625

Year 4: 0.48828125

Year 5: 0.6103515625 + 47.083 ≈ 47.69335156

We need to discount each of these cash flows at 11.5%.

Let me calculate each PV:

PV of D1: 0.25 / (1.115)^1

PV of D2: 0.3125 / (1.115)^2

PV of D3: 0.390625 / (1.115)^3

PV of D4: 0.48828125 / (1.115)^4

PV of D5 + terminal value: 47.69335156 / (1.115)^5

Let me compute each term:

First, compute the denominators:

1.115^1 = 1.115

1.115^2 = approx 1.115 * 1.115. Let's compute:

1.1 *1.1 = 1.21, 0.015*1.1=0.0165, 0.015*1.015=approx 0.015225. So total: 1.21 + 0.0165 + 0.015225 ≈ 1.2417.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.115^2:

1.115 * 1.115:

1 *1 =1, 1 *0.115=0.115, 0.115*1=0.115, 0.115*0.115=0.013225.

So 1 + 0.115 + 0.115 + 0.013225 = 1 + 0.23 + 0.013225 = 1.243225.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach:

1.115^2 = (1 + 0.115)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.115 + 0.115^2 = 1 + 0.23 + 0.013225 = 1.243225.

Similarly, 1.115^3 = 1.115^2 * 1.115 = 1.243225 * 1.115.

Let me compute that:

1.243225 * 1.115:

Let me break it down:

1 * 1.243225 = 1.243225

0.1 *1.243225 = 0.1243225

0.01 *1.243225 = 0.01243225

0.005 *1.243225 = 0.006216125

Adding these together: 1.243225 + 0.1243225 = 1.3675475; plus 0.01243225 = 1.379, plus 0.006216125 = 1.385216125.

Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Because 1.115 is 1 + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.005. So the multiplication would be:

1.243225 * 1.115 = 1.243225 * (1 + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.005) = 1.243225 + 0.1243225 + 0.01243225 + 0.006216125.

Adding:

1.243225 + 0.1243225 = 1.3675475

1.3675475 + 0.01243225 = 1.379, roughly.

1.379 + 0.006216125 ≈ 1.385216.

So 1.115^3 ≈ 1.385216.

Similarly, 1.115^4 = 1.385216 * 1.115.

Let me compute that:

1.385216 * 1.115:

Again, breaking down:

1 *1.385216 = 1.385216

0.1 *1.385216 = 0.1385216

0.01 *1.385216 = 0.01385216

0.005 *1.385216 = 0.00692608

Adding all together: 1.385216 + 0.1385216 = 1.5237376 + 0.01385216 = 1.53758976 + 0.00692608 ≈ 1.54451584.

So 1.115^4 ≈ 1.54451584.

1.115^5 = 1.54451584 * 1.115.

Calculate that:

1.54451584 * 1.115:

1 *1.54451584 = 1.54451584

0.1 *1.54451584 = 0.154451584

0.01 *1.54451584 = 0.0154451584

0.005 *1.54451584 = 0.0077225792

Adding them:

1.54451584 + 0.154451584 = 1.698967424

+ 0.0154451584 = 1.7144125824

+ 0.0077225792 ≈ 1.7221351616.

So 1.115^5 ≈ 1.722135.

Now, compute each PV:

PV(D1) = 0.25 / 1.115 ≈ 0.25 / 1.115 ≈ 0.2243 (approximately).

Wait, 1.115 * 0.2243 ≈ 0.25. Let me compute 0.25 / 1.115:

1.115 * 0.2243 ≈ 0.25, so yes, approx 0.2243.

PV(D2) = 0.3125 / 1.243225 ≈ let's compute 0.3125 / 1.243225.

Well, 1.243225 * 0.25 = 0.31080625, which is very close to 0.3125. So 0.25 + (0.3125 - 0.31080625)/(1.243225) ≈ 0.25 + 0.00169375 /1.243225 ≈ 0.25 + 0.00136 ≈ 0.25136. Hmm, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as 0.3125 / 1.243225 ≈ 0.2515.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.3125 ÷ 1.243225.

Alternatively, 1.243225 * 0.2515 ≈ ?

1.243225 * 0.25 = 0.31080625

1.243225 * 0.0015 ≈ 0.0018648375

So total ≈ 0.31080625 + 0.0018648375 ≈ 0.312671, which is a bit higher than 0.3125. So maybe 0.2515.

So PV(D2) ≈ 0.2515.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator approach, but for now, let's proceed.

PV(D3) = 0.390625 / 1.385216 ≈ let's see, 0.390625 ÷ 1.385216.

Well, 1.385216 * 0.28 = approx 0.3878. So 0.28 gives 0.3878, very close to 0.390625. So the PV is approximately 0.282.

Wait, 0.28 *1.385216 = 0.3878, which is less than 0.390625 by 0.002825. So let's find how much more is needed beyond 0.28.

0.002825 /1.385216 ≈ approx 0.00204, so total PV ≈ 0.28 + 0.00204 ≈ 0.28204.

So approx 0.2820.

PV(D4) = 0.48828125 / 1.54451584 ≈ let's compute 0.48828125 ÷ 1.54451584.

Well, 1.54451584 * 0.316 ≈ 0.488 (since 1.5445 * 0.316 ≈ 0.488). So PV(D4) ≈ 0.316.

PV(D5 + Terminal) = 47.69335156 / 1.722135 ≈ let's compute 47.69335156 ÷ 1.722135.

Well, 1.722135 * 27.7 ≈ approx?

1.722135 * 27 = 46.49765

1.722135 * 27.7 = 46.49765 + 1.722135 *0.7 ≈ 46.49765 + 1.2054945 ≈ 47.7031.

Which is very close to 47.69335. So 27.7 gives approx 47.7031, which is just a bit higher than 47.69335. So the PV is approximately 27.7 - a tiny bit less, maybe 27.69.

So adding up all the present values:

PV(D1) ≈ 0.2243

PV(D2) ≈ 0.2515

PV(D3) ≈ 0.2820

PV(D4) ≈ 0.316

PV(D5 + TV) ≈ 27.69

Total PV = 0.2243 + 0.2515 = 0.4758

+ 0.2820 → 0.7578

+ 0.316 → 1.0738

+ 27.69 → 28.7638.

So the total present value is approximately $28.7638. Since we assumed E0 = $1, the price per share is $28.7638, and the P/E ratio is 28.7638 / 1 = 28.7638.

Wait, no, wait
