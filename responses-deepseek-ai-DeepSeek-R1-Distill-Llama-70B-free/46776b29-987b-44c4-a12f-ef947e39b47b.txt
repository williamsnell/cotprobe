Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. The question is about a synthesis reaction that's supposed to produce n-butane, but it's not very efficient. I need to figure out why from the given options.

The reaction provided is: CH3CH2CH2Br + CH3Br + 2 Na → CH3(CH2)2CH3 + 2 NaBr. Hmm, I think I recognize this as a type of coupling reaction. Sodium is a metal, and when metals like Na or Mg react with alkyl halides, they often lead to elimination or coupling reactions. Wait, but in this case, it looks like a coupling because we're getting a longer chain.

So, the reactants are 1-bromopropane (or maybe that's 3-bromopropane, but wait, wait—CH3CH2CH2Br is 1-bromobutane? No, wait, butane is four carbons. Oh wait, CH3CH2CH2Br is actually 1-bromopropane because propane has three carbons. Wait, no, wait, butane is four carbons. So CH3CH2CH2Br is 1-bromobutane. No, wait, CH3CH2CH2Br has four carbons? Because CH3-CH2-CH2-Br is four carbons: the first is CH3, then two CH2, then Br. Oh wait no, no, CH3CH2CH2Br is three carbons. Because the formula is C3H7Br. So that would be 1-bromopropane.

Wait, but the product is CH3(CH2)2CH3, which is butane. But wait, butane is four carbons, so the product is n-butane. Oh wait, but the way it's written, it's CH3-(CH2)2-CH3, which is four carbons: the first CH3, then two CH2, then another CH3. So that's butane.

So the reaction is: 1-bromopropane + methyl bromide (CH3Br) plus sodium gives butane and NaBr.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me think. When sodium reacts with an alkyl halide, it's usually an elimination or a coupling reaction. In the case of Na or other metals, sometimes they cause the alkyl halides to couple. For example, in the formation of alkanes via the Wurtz reaction, which is when two alkyl halides react with sodium to form a longer chain alkane.

Wait, but the Wurtz reaction is when two molecules of the same or different alkyl halides couple. So, for example, 2 R-X + 2 Na → R-R + 2 NaX.

In this case, the two reactants are CH3CH2CH2Br and CH3Br. So one is a three-carbon alkyl bromide (1-bromopropane) and the other is methyl bromide. So when they react with sodium, what would happen?

If both are reacting via a coupling mechanism, the product would be a combination of the two alkyl groups. So, in this case, the butane is formed. Let me count the carbons. The 1-bromopropane has three carbons: CH3CH2CH2Br. The methyl bromide has one carbon: CH3Br. When they couple, the product would be CH3CH2CH2CH3, which is butane. That makes sense because 3 + 1 = 4 carbons.

But wait, the problem says that this projected synthesis is not very efficient. So why is that?

I remember that in the Wurtz reaction, you usually use two equivalents of the same alkyl halide, or two different ones. But when you mix two different alkyl halides, you can get a mixture of products. Because the sodium could react with any of the alkyl halides. So for example, if you have R-X and R'-X, you could get R-R, R-R', and R'-R' as products. But wait, in reality, the coupling would prefer the most stable product, but more importantly, when you have two different alkyl halides, the reaction isn't as straightforward.

Wait, in this case, the two alkyl halides are 1-bromopropane (three carbons) and methyl bromide (one carbon). So when they couple, you would get butane (3+1=4), but also other products. Because the 1-bromopropane could couple with another 1-bromopropane to make hexane (3+3=6 carbons), and methyl bromide could couple with itself to make ethane (1+1=2).

Wait, but in the equation given in the problem, only butane is shown as the product, but that's not what would actually happen. So the actual reaction would produce a mixture of products: butane (from 3+1), hexane (3+3), and ethane (1+1). So the desired product is n-butane, but in reality, you also get hexane and ethane as byproducts.

So the problem is that the reaction isn't efficient because it produces a mixture of products. The desired n-butane is not the only product; other alkanes are formed as well. So the yield of n-butane is lower than expected because other products are being formed.

Looking at the options, option B says: "Decrease in the production of n-butane due to formation of ethane and hexane." That fits because ethane would be from two methyl bromides coupling, and hexane from two 1-bromopropanes coupling.

Another option is A: Formation of only hexane. But that's not right because you get a mix. So the problem is the formation of multiple products, not just hexane.

Option F talks about bromoethane and tribromomethane, which doesn't make much sense here. The reaction is a coupling, so those products are unlikely.

Option D mentions butadiene, but that's an elimination product, not a coupling product. So that's probably not the case here.

So the correct answer should be B, because the reaction produces ethane, hexane, and n-butane as products, leading to lower efficiency in producing just n-butane.
</think>

The reaction provided is: 

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{Br} + \text{CH}_3\text{Br} + 2 \text{Na} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3(\text{CH}_2)_2\text{CH}_3 + 2 \text{NaBr}$$

This reaction involves the coupling of two alkyl halides (1-bromopropane and methyl bromide) in the presence of sodium, which is characteristic of the Wurtz reaction. The desired product is n-butane (CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_2$CH$_3$), but the reaction is not very efficient due to the formation of multiple products.

When sodium reacts with a mixture of two different alkyl halides, the coupling can occur in three possible ways:
1. Coupling of 1-bromopropane with itself to form hexane (3 + 3 carbons).
2. Coupling of methyl bromide with itself to form ethane (1 + 1 carbons).
3. Coupling of 1-bromopropane with methyl bromide to form n-butane (3 + 1 carbons).

As a result, the reaction produces a mixture of ethane, hexane, and n-butane. The formation of these byproducts reduces the efficiency of producing the desired n-butane. Therefore, the inefficiency of the reaction is due to the decrease in the production of n-butane caused by the formation of ethane and hexane.

Option B correctly identifies this issue: "Decrease in the production of n-butane due to formation of ethane and hexane."

Answer: B
