Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect and work functions. Hmm, I need to figure out which metals won't emit photoelectrons when visible light hits them. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the work function of a metal is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from its surface. The formula I think is involved here is the equation relating the work function (Φ) to the threshold wavelength (λ₀). Oh right, the equation is Φ = hc/λ₀, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. 

Wait, but I need to calculate the threshold wavelength for each metal, right? Because if the threshold wavelength is longer than the wavelengths of visible light, then those metals won't emit electrons when visible light shines on them.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the energy. Visible light has wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So the energy of visible light ranges from E = hc/λ. For each metal, if the work function Φ is greater than the energy of any visible light photon, then that metal won't emit electrons.

So the key is to find for each metal whether Φ is greater than the maximum energy of visible light. Wait, no, the maximum energy of visible light is for the shortest wavelength, which is higher energy. So if the work function is higher than the energy corresponding to 400 nm, then even the highest energy visible photons (violet) can't eject electrons.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the threshold wavelength is the maximum wavelength a photon can have and still eject electrons. So if the threshold wavelength is longer than the wavelength of visible light, then visible light photons have higher energy than needed. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the threshold wavelength λ₀ is the maximum wavelength of light that can cause ejection. So if the incoming light has a wavelength shorter than λ₀ (i.e., higher energy), it can eject electrons. So for a metal to not emit electrons under visible light, its threshold wavelength must be longer than the longest wavelength of visible light (700 nm). Because if λ₀ is longer than 700 nm, then visible light (which is 400-700 nm) has wavelengths shorter than λ₀, meaning higher energy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if λ₀ is the maximum, so if λ > λ₀, then the photon energy is too low. So if a metal's λ₀ is longer than 700 nm, then visible light (which has λ down to 400 nm) includes photons with λ less than 700 nm. Wait, no, let me get this straight.

Oh wait, let's think about it. For example, if a metal has a threshold wavelength of 600 nm. That means that light with wavelength 600 nm or longer (lower energy) cannot eject electrons. So any photon with λ < 600 nm (i.e., higher energy) will eject electrons. So for visible light, which is up to 700 nm, if a metal's λ₀ is less than 700 nm, then higher energy visible photons (like 400 nm) can eject electrons. But if the metal's λ₀ is longer than 700 nm, then even the longest visible wavelength (700 nm) won't have enough energy. So in that case, visible light can't eject electrons.

So the metals whose threshold wavelength is greater than 700 nm won't emit photoelectrons under visible light.

So my approach should be: calculate λ₀ for each metal, and see if any are above 700 nm.

The work function Φ is given in Joules for each metal. So let's compute λ₀ = hc / Φ.

I need the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.

Let me compute λ₀ for each metal:

Wait, but the metals given are W, Cs, Cu, K, Zn. Wait, the initial data is:

Wait, looking back, the question lists the metals with their work functions in Joules.

Wait, the question says:

The photoelectric work functions for several metals are listed below. Calculate the threshold wavelengths for each metal. Which metals will not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light? 

The data given is:

W- (Joules)
Cs: 3.2 × 10^-19 J
Cu:6.4 ×10^-19 J
K:3.6 ×10^-19 J
Zn:5.8 ×10^-19 J

Wait, but what about W? Oh, the first line says "W- (Joules)", but no value is given. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps the work function for W isn't provided. So maybe the metals in the options don't include W, except option E, F, J. Hmm, but the question asks which metals will not emit when illuminated with visible light, so perhaps W isn't part of the data.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, original data:

W- (Joules) Cs 3.2 ×10^-19 J

Cu 6.4 ×10^-19 J

K 3.6 ×10^-19 J

Zn 5.8 ×10^-19 J

Ah, maybe W is the first one, but its work function isn't provided. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo in the question. Maybe the data is:

Metal: Work Function (J)

Cs: 3.2e-19

Cu:6.4e-19

K:3.6e-19

Zn:5.8e-19

Wait, then perhaps W isn't involved. Or maybe W is one of the metals in the list, but its work function is missing. Hmm, but the options include W in some cases. So I'm a bit confused. Let me proceed with the given values.

Wait, perhaps that was a typo, and the line is:

The photoelectric work functions for several metals are listed below:

W: (some value)
Cs: 3.2e-19 J
Cu:6.4e-19 J
K:3.6e-19 J
Zn:5.8e-19 J

But the first line is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the first line is just indicating units, so the metals are Cs, Cu, K, Zn. Wait, but the options include W as well. Hmm, perhaps the initial line is a mistake, and W is not part of the metals here. Alternatively, perhaps the data for W is missing, but the options include it, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without W, assuming the metals are Cs, Cu, K, Zn. But let me check the options. The options are combinations like A: K and Cu, B: Cs and Cu, etc. So perhaps the metals are Cs, Cu, K, Zn, and W is not part of the data.

Wait, perhaps the initial line was a typo and the work functions are for W, Cs, etc. But without the value for W, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps W is not part of the data. But the options include W. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the given data, which includes Cs, Cu, K, Zn. Let's see.

Compute for each metal:

λ₀ = hc / Φ

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3.0e8 m/s

So compute λ₀ in meters.

Let me calculate each:

1. Cs: Φ = 3.2e-19 J

λ₀ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.2e-19) 

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 3.2e-19 J: (1.9878e-25) / (3.2e-19) = approx (1.9878 / 3.2) * 1e-6 meters

1.9878 /3.2 ≈ 0.621, so 0.621e-6 m = 621 nm.

So λ₀ for Cs is about 621 nm.

2. Cu: Φ=6.4e-19 J

λ₀ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) /6.4e-19

Numerator same as before: 1.9878e-25

Divide by 6.4e-19: 1.9878e-25 /6.4e-19 = (1.9878/6.4)*1e-6 = approx 0.3106e-6 m = 310.6 nm.

3. K: Φ=3.6e-19 J

λ₀ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) /3.6e-19

1.9878e-25 /3.6e-19 = (1.9878/3.6)*1e-6 ≈ 0.5522e-6 m =552.2 nm.

4. Zn: Φ=5.8e-19 J

λ₀= (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(5.8e-19) =1.9878e-25 /5.8e-19 = (1.9878/5.8)*1e-6 ≈ 0.3428e-6 m =342.8 nm.

Wait, so let me summarize:

Cs: 621 nm

Cu:310.6 nm

K:552 nm

Zn:342.8 nm

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because higher work function should correspond to lower threshold wavelength. Because higher Φ requires higher energy photons, so lower wavelength (since E=hc/λ). So Φ and λ₀ should be inversely related.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Let me recompute:

For Cs, Φ=3.2e-19.

λ₀ = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/3.2e-19

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 3.2e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 /3.2e-19 = (1.9878 /3.2 ) * 1e(-25 - (-19)) )= 0.621 *1e-6 = 621e-9 m = 621 nm.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, K has Φ=3.6e-19, which is higher than Cs's 3.2e-19. So its λ₀ should be shorter than Cs's. Wait, but I calculated K's λ₀ as 552 nm, which is longer than Cs's 621? No, wait, 552 is shorter than 621. Oh, right, 552 is less than 621, so for K, λ₀ is 552 nm, which is shorter than Cs's 621. That makes sense because K has a higher Φ than Cs, so it needs higher energy photons, so shorter λ.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, K's λ₀ came out to 552 nm, which is longer than Zn's 342 nm. Zn has Φ=5.8e-19, which is higher than K's 3.6e-19. So Zn's λ₀ is 342 nm, which is shorter than K's 552. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait, in the calculation for K:

(6.626e-34 *3e8) =1.9878e-25

Divide by 3.6e-19: 1.9878e-25 /3.6e-19 = (1.9878 /3.6) *1e(-25 +19) )= 0.552 * 1e-6 m =552e-9 m =552 nm. Yes, correct.

Now, so each metal's threshold wavelength is:

Cs:621 nm

Cu: 310.6 nm

K:552 nm

Zn:342.8 nm

Now, visible light's range is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So any metal with a threshold wavelength longer than 700 nm would require photons with λ < 700 nm to have enough energy. Wait, but if λ₀ is the maximum wavelength that can cause ejection, then if λ₀ is longer than 700 nm, then the incoming light must have λ < λ₀ to have enough energy. So if λ₀ >700 nm, then visible light (up to 700 nm) can't provide photons of sufficient energy.

Wait, so when is visible light (λ in 400-700 nm) insufficient? When λ₀ >700 nm. Because then even the longest wavelength (700 nm) in visible light is shorter than λ₀, meaning its energy is higher than needed (since E=hc/λ). Wait, no, that's the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think carefully.

λ₀ is the maximum wavelength that can cause ejection. So if a photon's wavelength is less than λ₀, it has higher energy (since E=hc/λ, so smaller λ means larger E), and thus can cause ejection. So if the threshold wavelength is 600 nm, then any photon with λ <600 nm (i.e., higher energy) can cause ejection. So photons with λ=500 nm (green) would cause ejection, because 500 <600.

But if the threshold wavelength is 800 nm, then photons with λ=700 nm (red) have λ <800 nm, so they have higher energy than required. So they would cause ejection. Wait, but that would mean that a metal with λ₀=800 nm would emit electrons when red light (700 nm) shines on it.

Wait, but that's impossible because red light has lower energy than the work function. Because Φ = hc/λ₀, so if λ₀=800 nm, Φ= hc/(800e-9 m). If a photon has λ=700 nm (which is less than 800), then its energy is E=hc/(700e-9), which is higher than Φ. So yes, it can eject electrons.

Wait, but that would mean that any metal with λ₀ >700 nm would allow visible light (which includes λ <700 nm) to cause ejection. So the only way a metal won't emit under visible light is if λ₀ > the maximum visible wavelength, which is 700 nm. Because then photons with λ=700 nm (red) have E= hc/(700e-9) < Φ (since Φ= hc/(λ₀), and λ₀>700, so Φ> hc/700e-9).

Wait, so for a metal to not emit electrons when illuminated with visible light, its λ₀ must be greater than 700 nm. Because then even the highest wavelength visible light (700 nm) has energy less than Φ.

So let's look at the computed λ₀ values:

Cs:621 nm → less than 700 → So visible light can eject electrons. Because λ₀ is 621, so any photon with λ<621 (which includes the entire visible range up to 700?) Wait no, wait. Wait, wait no: if λ₀ is 621, then any photon with λ <621 can eject electrons. But visible light goes up to 700 nm, which is longer than 621. So for photons with λ between 621 and 700 nm (red to orange), their energy would be lower than Φ, so they wouldn't eject electrons. But photons with λ <621 (green, blue, violet) would have higher energy and would eject electrons.

Wait, so the metal would emit electrons when illuminated with light of wavelength less than 621 nm. So if you shine white light (which includes all visible wavelengths), some parts (like violet, blue) would cause ejection, while red would not.

But the question is asking which metals will not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light. So if any part of visible light can cause ejection, the metal will emit. Only if no part of visible light can cause ejection, then the metal won't emit.

Wait, but that's only possible if the threshold wavelength is longer than the maximum wavelength of visible light, 700 nm. Because then, any photon in visible light (400-700 nm) has λ <700 nm, which would be longer than λ₀. Wait no, no, wait: Let me think again.

Wait, λ₀ is the maximum wavelength that can cause ejection. So if λ₀ is 800 nm, then any photon with λ ≤800 nm can cause ejection. But visible light's maximum λ is 700 nm, which is ≤800, so those photons can cause ejection.

Wait, that can't be right because higher λ has lower energy. So, if λ₀ is 800 nm, then Φ = hc/800e-9. Photons with λ=700 nm have E= hc/700e-9, which is higher than Φ. So yes, they can cause ejection.

But if λ₀ is 800 nm, then any photon with λ ≤800 can cause ejection. So in that case, all visible light (λ=400-700) can cause ejection, because 700 <800.

Wait, no, that's not correct. λ₀ is the maximum wavelength that can cause ejection. So photons with λ > λ₀ can't cause ejection because their energy is too low. Photons with λ ≤ λ₀ can cause ejection.

So, if a metal's λ₀ is longer than 700 nm (e.g., 800 nm), then visible light's maximum λ is 700 nm, which is ≤800, so all visible light can cause ejection.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think of it this way: For a given metal, if the longest wavelength (lowest energy) of visible light (700 nm) has energy E= hc/700e-9. If this E is greater than or equal to Φ, then that metal will emit electrons under red light. If E < Φ, then even red light can't cause emission.

So to find if a metal won't emit under any visible light, we need that the energy of the highest wavelength (lowest energy) visible light is less than Φ. Because if even the highest λ (700 nm) doesn't have enough energy, then no visible photon can eject electrons.

So the condition is Φ > hc/(700e-9 m)

Let me compute hc/(700e-9 m):

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

700e-9 m = 7e-7 m

So hc/λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/7e-7 = let's compute this.

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25

Divide by 7e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /7e-7 = (1.987
