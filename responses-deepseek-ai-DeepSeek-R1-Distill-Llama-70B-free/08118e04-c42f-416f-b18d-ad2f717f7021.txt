Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking which ratio can form a proportion with 3 over 8. The options are A through D, each with different fractions. Hmm, I remember that proportions are like equal ratios, so I need to find which of these options is equivalent to 3/8.

Let me start by recalling what it means for two ratios to be in proportion. If ratio A is equal to ratio B, then their cross products should be equal. So for example, if I have a ratio a/b and another c/d, they form a proportion if a*d = b*c. But wait, in this case, the question is just asking which single ratio is equivalent to 3/8. So I think I need to check which of the options simplifies to 3/8 when reduced.

So I'll go through each option one by one. Let's see:

Option A: 24 over 64. Hmm, I can simplify this. Both 24 and 64 are divisible by 8. 24 divided by 8 is 3, and 64 divided by 8 is 8. So 24/64 simplifies to 3/8. Oh, that's exactly the same as the given ratio. So option A is a possible correct answer.

But wait, maybe I should check the others just to be sure. Let's look at option B: 15 over 48. Okay, can I simplify this? Both 15 and 48 are divisible by 3. 15 divided by 3 is 5, and 48 divided by 3 is 16. So 15/48 reduces to 5/16. That's different from 3/8, so B isn't correct.

Option C: 18 over 56. Let me see if this can be reduced. Both 18 and 56 are divisible by 2. 18/2 is 9, and 56/2 is 28. So that's 9/28. Does 9/28 simplify further? 9 and 28 have no common factors besides 1, so that's the simplest form. 9/28 is not the same as 3/8, so C is out.

Option D: 18 over 40. Let's simplify this. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 18/2 is 9, 40/2 is 20. So 9/20. That's not equal to 3/8. So D isn't correct either.

So looking back, only option A simplifies to 3/8. So the answer must be A. But wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in simplifying, let me double-check each option again.

Option A: 24/64. Dividing numerator and denominator by 8 gives 3/8. Correct.

Option B: 15/48. 15 divided by 3 is 5, 48 divided by 3 is 16. 5/16. Not 3/8.

Option C: 18/56 reduces to 9/28. Not matching.

Option D: 18/40 is 9/20. Nope.

Yep, so A is definitely the right choice.

To determine which ratio can form a proportion with 3/8, we need to identify which option simplifies to 3/8.

- **Option A: 24/64**  
  Dividing both numerator and denominator by 8 gives 24 ÷ 8 = 3 and 64 ÷ 8 = 8, so 24/64 simplifies to 3/8. This matches the given ratio.

- **Option B: 15/48**  
  Dividing both numerator and denominator by 3 gives 15 ÷ 3 = 5 and 48 ÷ 3 = 16, so 15/48 simplifies to 5/16. This does not match 3/8.

- **Option C: 18/56**  
  Dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 gives 18 ÷ 2 = 9 and 56 ÷ 2 = 28, so 18/56 simplifies to 9/28. This does not match 3/8.

- **Option D: 18/40**  
  Dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 gives 18 ÷ 2 = 9 and 40 ÷ 2 = 20, so 18/40 simplifies to 9/20. This does not match 3/8.

Only **Option A** simplifies to 3/8, making it the correct answer.
