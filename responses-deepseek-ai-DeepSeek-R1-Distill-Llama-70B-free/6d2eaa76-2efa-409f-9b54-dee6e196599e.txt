Question:

A woman was the fee simple owner of a 20-acre tract of land. When the woman moved to another state, a man took possession of the tract. The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?

Options:

A: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional seven years, or until the son reaches the age of 25.
B: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.
C: The man has acquired title by adverse possession.
D: The man will acquire title by adverse possession only if the son does not claim the land before he turns 18.
E: The man has not acquired title by adverse possession because the woman was not aware of his possession at the time of her death.
F: The man has not acquired title by adverse possession because the son was a minor at the time of the woman's death.
G: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.
H: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12years, or nine years after the son attains the ageof 18.
I: The man will acquire title by adverse possession only if he continues in possession for a total of 30 years.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about adverse possession and property law. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it out.

The question is about a woman who owned a 20-acre tract. She moved away, and a man took possession. His possession met all the requirements of the adverse possession statute. Now, after 12 years, the woman died intestate, leaving a six-year-old son as her only heir. Nine years after her death, the son's guardian found out about the man's possession. The statutory period is 20 years, and the age of majority is 18.

So, the key points are:

- The woman (let's call her W) was the fee simple owner.
- Man (M) took possession under adverse conditions, meeting all the statute's requirements.
- After 12 years, W dies. At her death, her son is 6 years old.
- Nine years after W's death, the son is 15. So, from W's death, 9 years have passed. The guardian just found out about M's possession at that point.

The question is about the state of title to the tract.

I remember that adverse possession requires certain elements: open, notorious, exclusive, hostile (or adverse), and continuous possession for the statutory period. Also, the statutory period can be tolled in certain situations, like when the owner is a minor or under a disability.

So, when W died, her son inherited the property as her only heir. At that time, the son was 6, so a minor. The issue is whether the time M was in possession counts towards the statutory period, especially considering that the son is a minor.

In many jurisdictions, the time for adverse possession can be tolled when the owner is a minor or has some other disability. So, if the owner is a minor, the statutory period doesn't start running until they reach the age of majority.

Wait, but in this case, W was the owner until she died. So, when W was alive, she was the owner. M's adverse possession would have been against her. But she died after 12 years of M's possession.

Wait, so M started possession, and for 12 years, W was alive. Then W died, and the son inherited. So, from that point, M's possession would now be adverse against the son, who was a minor.

So, the total time M has been in possession is 12 years (while W was alive) plus 9 years after W's death, totaling 21 years. But the statutory period is 20 years. But wait, the son was a minor until he turned 18. So when the guardian discovered M's possession when the son was 15, so three years until the son turns 18.

So, does the time during the son's minority count towards the adverse possession?

I think that during the minority of the owner, the time doesn't count towards the adverse possession period. So, the clock stops until the minor reaches majority.

So, let's break it down:

- W was the owner for the first 12 years of M's possession. So, M had 12 years of adverse possession against W. But the statutory period is 20 years, so W's death occurs before M completes the 20 years.

- Upon W's death, the son becomes the owner, but he's a minor. So, the time during which the son is a minor (from W's death until the son turns 18) would not count towards M's adverse possession period because the owner is a minor, and the statute is tolled.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about when the tolling occurs. Does the tolling happen only if the owner is a minor at the time the adverse possession begins, or does it apply to any time the owner is a minor during the period?

I think that if the owner is a minor during any part of the adverse possession period, the time is tolled for the duration of the minority. So, in this case, when W died, the son was 6. M had already been in possession for 12 years. So, from W's death until the son turns 18, which is 12 years (since 6 + 12 = 18), that's 12 years where the time is tolled.

So, M's total time in possession is 12 years under W, plus 9 years after W's death (from when she died until the guardian found out). But of those 9 years, the son was a minor for the first 9 years? Wait, no. Wait, from W's death, the son was 6, and the guardian found out 9 years later, when the son was 15. So, from W's death to that point is 9 years. The son will reach 18 in 3 more years (since 15 +3 =18).

So, in those 9 years after W's death, the son was a minor for the entire time. So, the time during which the son is a minor (from W's death until he turns 18) would be 12 years. But in this case, only 9 years have passed since W's death, so the son is still a minor, 15.

So, the time from W's death to the son's 18th birthday would be 12 years, but only 9 have passed. So, the time during which the son is a minor is 9 years (so far), but the tolling applies during that time.

So, M's total adverse possession time would be:

12 years under W (but W's ownership didn't result in M getting title because he needed 20 years). Then, when the son inherits, M's possession continues, but the time is tolled because the son is a minor.

So, the 9 years after W's death don't count towards the 20 years because the son is a minor. So, M has only 12 years of adverse possession, which is less than the 20 required.

Wait, but the question is, what's the state of the title now? The options suggest varying possibilities.

Option C says the man has acquired title by adverse possession. But M only has 12 years under W, which isn't enough, and then 9 years under the son, which may or may not count.

Wait, but if the time is tolled during the son's minority, then M's possession during those 9 years doesn't count. So, M has 12 years, which is less than the 20 needed. So, he hasn't acquired title yet.

But wait, I thought that once W died, M's possession would continue against the new owner, the son. But because the son is a minor, the time wouldn't count. So, M needs to continue possession until the son's minority ends, and then continue for the remaining time.

So, when W died, the son was 6. M had already been in possession for 12 years. The statutory period is 20, so M needs 8 more years after W's death, but during the son's minority, the time doesn't count. So, M would have to wait until the son turns 18, and then continue for 8 more years to reach the 20 total.

Wait, let me calculate.

Total needed: 20 years.

Time under W: 12 years. So, remaining time: 8 years.

But after W's death, the son is a minor. So, the time during minority doesn't count. So, M has to wait until the son turns 18, which is in 3 years (since the son is 15 when the guardian found out). So, for those 3 years, the time is tolled. Then, M would need to possess the land for the remaining 8 years after the son turns 18.

So, from the time the guardian found out (when the son is 15), M needs to continue for 3 years until the son is 18, and then 8 more years. So, 3 +8 =11 more years. But wait, I'm not sure if that's how it's calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the 20-year period stops when the son is a minor and resumes when he's no longer a minor.

So, M started with 12 years. Then, when the son became owner, the clock stops. It starts again when the son turns 18. So, from that point, M needs 8 more years to reach 20.

So, the total time M has to possess after the son turns 18 is 8 years.

So, in the current situation, the son is 15, so 3 years until he's 18. So, M has to continue possession for those 3 years, and then 8 more. So, 11 years more.

But looking at the options, I'm trying to see which one matches.

Option B says he needs to continue for an additional three years, or until the son reaches 18. Hmm, that would bring the total to 15 years (12 +3). But that's only 15, which is less than 20. So that doesn't make sense.

Option H says he needs 12 more years, or nine years after the son turns 18. So, 12 more years from now. If the son is 15, nine years after he turns 18 would be when he's 27. That seems excessive.

Option A says an additional seven years, or until the son is 25. Wait, that doesn't align with the 20-year requirement.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

At the time the woman died, the son was 6. M had 12 years of adverse possession against her. So, under W's ownership, M had 12 years. The statutory period is 20, so he needed 8 more years, but W died before that.

Upon W's death, the son inherits, and M's possession continues, but now against the son, who is a minor. So, the time during the son's minority doesn't count towards the 20 years.

So, M's 12 years are under W. Then, from W's death to the son's 18th birthday is 12 years (since the son was 6). But only 9 years have passed when the guardian found out, so the son is 15.

So, the time that counts after W's death is from when the son turns 18. So, M's possession during the son's minority (from death to 18) doesn't count. So, M would have to continue possessing the land for the remaining 8 years after the son turns 18.

So, from the point when the guardian found out (son is 15), M needs to wait 3 years until the son is 18, and then 8 more years. So, 11 years total.

But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let's check each option.

Option B: man must continue for additional 3 years (until son is 18) or until son is 18. But that doesn't add up to 20.

Wait, perhaps the initial 12 years under W are valid, and then the remaining 8 years must be after the son is no longer under a disability.

So, the total time after the son is 18 must be 8 years.

So, the man has already been in possession for 12 (under W) + 9 (under son's ownership, but not counting) = 21 years total, but only 12 count. So, he needs 8 more years after the son turns 18.

So, from the time the guardian found out, which is when the son is 15, the son will be 18 in 3 years. Then, M needs 8 more years. So, from that point, it's 3 +8=11 years.

But the question is, what's the state now? The options are about what's needed for the man to acquire title.

Option B says the man must continue for an additional 3 years, or until the son is 18. So, that would give him 12 +3=15 years, which isn't enough. So that doesn't make sense.

Option H says he must continue for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son is 18. Wait, 12 more years from now (son is 15), which would be when the son is 27. That's more than needed.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the adverse possession period was interrupted by the son's minority. So, M had 12 years under W, and then when the son became owner, the clock stops. It starts again when the son reaches majority.

So, M needs to have 20 years in total. He has 12, so he needs 8 more after the son turns 18.

So, in the current situation, the son is 15, so M needs to wait until the son is 18 (3 years) and then possess for 8 more years. So, 11 years total from now.

But looking at the options, none directly state that. Let's check option B again: additional 3 years or until son is 18. That would only give 15 years total, which is insufficient.

Option H: additional 12 years, or nine years after son turns 18. Wait, 12 years from now would be when the son is 15 +12=27. Or nine years after the son turns 18 would be when he's 27 as well. So, that would give 12 (from W) + 9 (after majority) =21 years. But the statutory period is 20, so that's more than enough.

Wait, but the man only needs 8 more years after the son turns 18. So, why would option H require nine years after? That doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the son's disability (being a minor) tolls the statute, so the 20-year period starts after he reaches majority. So, M needs 20 years from when the son turns 18. But that can't be right because M already had 12 years under W.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The adverse possession is against the current owner. So, when W was alive, M had 12 years. When W died, the son became owner, but M's possession continued. However, because the son is a minor, the time doesn't count. So, M's possession during the son's minority (from W's death until the son is 18) doesn't count towards the 20 years.

So, the 12 years under W count, and then M needs 8 more years after the son turns 18.

So, from the time the guardian found out (son is 15), M needs to wait 3 years until the son is 18, then 8 more years. So, 11 more years in total.

But none of the options directly say that. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.

That would mean he could get title in 3 more years, but that would only add to 15 years (12 under W + 3). But he needs 20. So that doesn't make sense.

Option H: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son attains the age of 18.

So, 12 more years from now would be when the son is 15 +12=27. Or nine years after the son turns 18 (son is 15 now, so in 3 years he's 18, then 9 more years to 27). So, both options in H end at the same time, 27. But M only needs 8 more years after the son is 18. So why 9?

Wait, perhaps the calculation is that from the time the guardian found out (son is 15), M needs to wait until the son is 18 (3 years) and then 8 more years, making it 11 years. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial 12 years under W are not counted because W's death interrupted the adverse possession, and now M has to start over against the son. But that doesn't seem right because adverse possession can continue against a new owner.

Wait, perhaps when W died, M's adverse possession against her stopped, and now he has to begin adverse possession against the son. But that can't be right because M's possession is continuous.

So, M's possession is continuous from the start, but the period during which the son is a minor doesn't count towards the 20 years.

So, M has 12 years (against W) plus any time after the son turns 18.

He needs 20 total, so 8 more after the son is 18.

So, from when the guardian found out (son is 15), M needs to wait 3 years until the son is 18, then 8 more years.

So, 3 +8 =11 years from that point.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: ...additional three years, or until son is 18. So, that's only 3 more years, making it 15 total. Not enough.

Option H: ...additional 12 years, or nine years after son is 18. So, 12 more years from now (son is 15) would be 27. Alternatively, nine years after son is 18 (when he's 27). So, in both cases, that gives M 12 (from W) +12 (after W's death) =24 years? Wait, no:

Wait, if M continues for 12 more years from now, that would be 12 (from W) +9 (already passed after W's death) +12 (additional) = 33 years, which is way over.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the total time M has been in possession and how much counts.

So, M has been in possession for 12 years under W. That counts. Then, after W's death, he's been in possession for 9 years, but that doesn't count because the son is a minor. So, total counted time: 12 years.

He needs 20, so he needs 8 more years after the son is no longer a minor.

So, the son will turn 18 in 3 years. So, M needs to possess the land for 8 more years after that.

Thus, from the current point (son is 15), M needs to wait 3 years and then 8 more years, totaling 11 years.

So, the man will acquire title only if he continues possession for 8 years after the son turns 18. So, the earliest he can get title is when the son is 18 +8 =26 years old.

Looking at the options, I don't see this scenario. Let me check the options again.

Option B: needs 3 more years or until son is 18. That's not enough.

Option H: needs 12 more years or nine years after son is 18. Nine years after son is 18 would be when he's 27. M would have 12
