Okay, so I have this question about group theory, specifically about 2x2 matrices with integer entries. Hmm, I remember that a group has to satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. Let me think about each statement one by one.

Statement 1 says that the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication. Wait, nonzero determinant means they're invertible, right? Because a matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is non-zero. But wait, does that mean they form a group?

So for a group, all elements must have inverses within the set. The inverse of a matrix with integer entries might not have integer entries. For example, if I have a matrix A with integer entries and determinant det(A) != 0, its inverse is (1/det(A)) * adjugate(A). The adjugate matrix has integer entries, but when I divide by determinant, which is an integer, the entries might become fractions. So the inverse would not necessarily have integer entries. That means the inverse might not be in the set. So Statement 1 can't be a group because it lacks inverses.

Wait, but wait, the set in Statement 1 includes all integer matrices with non-zero determinant. So does closure hold? For matrix multiplication, if I multiply two such matrices, the determinant of the product is the product of the determinants. Since determinants are non-zero integers, their product is non-zero, so the product matrix is also in the set. So closure holds. But the issue is with inverses. Because even though each matrix is invertible in the real numbers, the inverse might not be in the set (since it's not integer). So Statement 1's set doesn't satisfy the inverse property, so it's not a group.

Then Statement 2: the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1. Is this a group? Well, determinant 1 implies that the inverse will have determinant 1 as well because det(A^{-1}) = 1/det(A). So if det(A)=1, then det(A^{-1})=1. So the inverse of such a matrix would have determinant 1. Also, when you multiply two matrices with determinant 1, the product's determinant is 1*1=1. So closure holds.

But wait, the entries of the inverse are still a concern. The inverse of an integer matrix with determinant 1 will have integer entries? Let me think. The adjugate matrix has integer entries. Since determinant is 1, multiplying by 1/det(A) is just multiplying by 1, so the inverse will have integer entries. So yes, the inverse exists in the set. Therefore, Statement 2's set satisfies all group properties: closure, associativity (matrix multiplication is associative), identity (the identity matrix has determinant 1), and inverses (as we just discussed). So Statement 2 is true.

So Statement 1 is false because inverses may not exist in the set. Statement 2 is true. So looking at the options, D says False, True. So the correct choice is D.

Statement 1: The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is not a group under matrix multiplication. While closure under multiplication holds (the product of two such matrices has a nonzero determinant), the inverse of a matrix with integer entries may not have integer entries. Specifically, the inverse of a matrix \( A \) is \( \frac{1}{\det(A)} \cdot \text{adj}(A) \), and dividing by \( \det(A) \) (a nonzero integer) can result in non-integer entries. Thus, inverses are not guaranteed to exist within the set, violating the group axioms.

Statement 2: The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication. This set satisfies all group properties: closure (the product of two such matrices has determinant 1), associativity (matrix multiplication is associative), identity (the identity matrix has determinant 1), and inverses (the inverse of a matrix with integer entries and determinant 1 also has integer entries and determinant 1). Therefore, this set forms a group.

Based on this analysis, Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true. The correct answer is:

D: False, True
