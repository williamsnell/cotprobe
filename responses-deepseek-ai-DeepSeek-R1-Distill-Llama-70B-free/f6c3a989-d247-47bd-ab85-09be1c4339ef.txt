Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about photon energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question says that light with a wavelength of 400 nm is incident upon lithium, and the work function phi is given as 2.93 eV. They want the photon energy in eV. Wait, but wait, the question is just asking for the photon energy, right? Oh wait, no, the work function is provided, but maybe that's a distraction because the question is only asking for the photon's energy. Or perhaps it's a trick to include the work function when it's not needed here.

So, I remember that the energy of a photon is calculated using the formula E = hc/λ. Right, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. I need to make sure the units are compatible. Oh, right, because the wavelength here is given in nanometers, and I should convert that to meters for consistency with the standard units of h and c.

Wait, what are the values of h and c again? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. And the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since the answer needs to be in eV, maybe there's a shortcut.

Alternatively, I remember that there's a direct conversion factor from nanometers to eV for photon energy. Let me think, I think the formula can be rewritten in terms of eV and nanometers. Oh right, because 1 eV is equal to about 1.6 x 10^-19 joules. So perhaps I can find the energy in joules and then convert to eV.

So the wavelength λ is 400 nm. To convert that to meters, I multiply by 1e-9. So 400 nm is 400e-9 meters, which is 4e-7 meters.

Now plug into E=hc/λ: (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (4e-7 m). Let me compute that.

Calculate numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 4e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4e-7 = approximately 4.9695e-19 J.

Now, convert joules to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, I'll divide the energy in J by 1.602e-19 to get eV.

So 4.9695e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.1 eV. Wait, that gives me about 3.1 eV.

But looking at the options, option G is 3.1, but it's labeled as just 3.1 without units, which is a bit odd. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps. Maybe I made a calculation mistake.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (400e-9) 

Compute numerator: 6.626 *3 = 19.878, so 19.878e-26 (since 1e-34 * 1e8 is 1e-26). So 19.878e-26 / 400e-9 = 19.878e-26 / 4e-7.

Let me compute 19.878e-26 divided by 4e-7. That's the same as (19.878 /4 ) * (1e-26 / 1e-7) )

19.878 /4 is approximately 4.9695. 1e-26 / 1e-7 is 1e-19. So 4.9695e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.9695e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = roughly 3.1 eV.

So the photon energy is about 3.1 eV. Now looking at the options, option G is 3.1, but without the unit. Wait, looking back, the options are a mix. Option A is 1.9 eV, B is 4.0, C is 2.7, etc. So option G is 3.1, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem gives the work function of lithium as 2.93 eV. But the question is only asking for the photon's energy, not anything about the photoelectric effect. Like, maybe it's a distraction. Because the photon's energy is independent of the material's properties unless it's about the photoelectric effect (like whether electrons are emitted).

So in this case, I think the correct approach is just to compute the photon's energy using E = hc/λ, which gives around 3.1 eV, so option G.

So the answer should be G.

To calculate the photon energy, we use the formula:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} = 400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength in meters).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
h \cdot c = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Next, divide by the wavelength:

\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{400 \times 10^{-9}} = 4.9695 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert the energy from joules to electron volts (eV), using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
E = \frac{4.9695 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the photon energy is approximately \( 3.1 \, \text{eV} \). The work function of lithium (\( \phi = 2.93 \, \text{eV} \)) is provided but is not relevant to this calculation, as the question only asks for the photon energy.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{G}
\]
