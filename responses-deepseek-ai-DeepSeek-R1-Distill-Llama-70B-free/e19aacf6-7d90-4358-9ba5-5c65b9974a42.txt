Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which type of employee the "in-basket" technique is most likely used for in personnel selection. Hmm, I remember that the in-basket technique is a type of assessment method. I think it's a simulation where the candidate is given a set of tasks or problems that they might face on the job and they have to prioritize and respond to them.

Wait, so it's like a mock-up of the kind of decisions and tasks someone in a particular role would handle. I guess it's used to evaluate how well someone can manage their workload, make decisions, and handle typical challenges of the position.

Now, thinking about the options given: Financial, Customer Service, Technical, Sales, Marketing, Manufacturing, Managerial, Secretarial, Clerical, Human Resources.

I think in-basket is often used for higher-level positions because it tests organizational and decision-making skills. Managerial roles would definitely require handling multiple tasks, prioritizing, and making strategic decisions. So maybe the answer is G: Managerial.

But wait, could it also be used for other roles? Like maybe secretarial or clerical, since they handle a lot of tasks and organize things. But I think in-basket is more about the strategic aspect, not just organizing. Secretaries might use more of a typing test or something.

Customer service roles might use role-playing exercises instead. Technical roles might have more practical tests. Sales could have simulations too, but I'm not sure if in-basket is specific to that.

Managerial positions make the most sense because they need to handle a variety of issues, delegate, and make important decisions, which the in-basket test can assess.

The in-basket technique is primarily used to assess a candidate's ability to manage tasks, prioritize, and make decisions, which are crucial for managerial roles. It involves simulating the types of problems and tasks a manager might face, making it the most appropriate choice for evaluating managerial candidates.
