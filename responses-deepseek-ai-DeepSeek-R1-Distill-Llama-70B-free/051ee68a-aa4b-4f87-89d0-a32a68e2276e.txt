Okay, so I've got this problem here about using the van der Waals equation to find the pressure of ethane gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we've got 10.0 moles of ethane (C2H6) in a volume of 4.860 dm³ at 27°C. I remember that the van der Waals equation is an equation of state that accounts for the non-ideal behavior of gases, so it's better than the ideal gas law here, especially under these conditions.

Wait, the van der Waals equation is (P + (n²a/V²))(V/n - b) = RT. Right. So I need to find the pressure P. But I don't know the values of a and b for ethane. Oh wait, I think I can look them up. Let me try to remember. Oh right, the van der Waals constants a and b are specific to each gas. For ethane, a is something like 5.4 (units?) and b is around 0.063... Wait, no, maybe I should check more carefully.

Let me think, the units for a should be L²·bar/mol² or something like that. Or wait, maybe in terms of dm³ since the volume is given in dm³. Oh wait, the units for the constants vary based on the source. Maybe I should clarify. Alternatively, perhaps the a and b values are in terms of (dm³)^2 bar / mol² and dm³/mol? Or maybe in terms of L units. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe I can find a table of van der Waals constants. Oh right, for ethane, a is about 5.4 dm⁶·bar/mol² and b is around 0.063 dm³/mol. Let me make sure. Yeah, I think that's correct. So a = 5.4 dm^6 bar/mol², and b = 0.063 dm³/mol.

Wait, but I should double-check. Because if I get a and b wrong, the answer will be way off. Let me try to recall. Oh, right, another approach: sometimes, a is in units of (atm·L²)/mol², so I might need to convert units. But let's see the given data's units. The volume is in dm³, which is the same as liters. So maybe a and b are in dm³ units.

Alternatively, maybe I should convert everything into SI units. Let me think. Let's check the constants. I think for ethane, a is 5.4 (dm³)^2 bar/mol² and b is 0.063 dm³/mol. So, that's what I'll go with for now.

So the variables I have are:

n = 10.0 mol

V =4.860 dm³ → which is 0.00486 m³, but maybe better to keep in dm³.

T is 27°C, which is 300 K. Because 27 + 273.15 = 300.15, approximately 300 K.

Wait, but the van der Waals equation uses temperature in Kelvin, so that's correct.

So substituting into the equation:

P = [nRT/(V - nb)] - [n²a / V²]

Wait, no, the van der Waals equation is:

[P + (n² a)/V²] [V/n - b] = RT

So solving for P:

P = (nRT)/(V - nb) - (n² a)/V²

Yes, that's the formula I should use.

Now plugging in the numbers.

First, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute nRT first. But wait, R is the gas constant. Oh, right, which value of R to use? Since a is in dm³ and bar, and I want the pressure in atm, I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, let's see. R is 0.08314 L·bar/(mol·K), if I'm using bar as the pressure unit. Alternatively, if I want pressure in atm, then R is 0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K). Hmm.

But in this case, since the a is given in dm³ and bar, maybe it's easier to compute P in bar and then convert to atm? Or perhaps let's stick with L, atm, etc.

Wait, let me adjust the units correctly to get P in atm.

So, let me see.

n = 10.0 mol

V =4.860 dm³ = 4.860 L

T =300 K

R is 0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K) if we're using atm.

a =5.4 (dm³)^2 bar/mol² → Wait, but dm³ is 1 L, so a in L² bar/mol² is 5.4 L² bar/mol².

Hmm, but if I'm using R in L·atm/(mol·K), then the units for a should be in L² atm/mol² as well, otherwise the units won't match. So perhaps I need to convert a from bar to atm.

Because 1 bar is approximately 0.9869 atm. So a in L² atm/mol² would be 5.4 * (bar) * (1 atm/0.9869 bar) → wait no, because 1 bar = 0.9869 atm, so 1 L² bar/mol² = 0.9869 L² atm/mol².

So a =5.4 dm³² bar/mol² → since 1 dm³ is 1 L, then 5.4 L² bar/mol² → convert bar to atm: 5.4 *0.9869 ≈5.34 L² atm/mol².

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 5.4 * 0.9869 = let's see:

5 * 0.9869 =4.9345

0.4 *0.9869=0.39476

Adding up: 4.9345 + 0.39476=5.32926 ≈5.329 L² atm/mol².

So a ≈5.329 (L² atm)/(mol²).

And b is 0.063 dm³/mol → which is 0.063 L/mol.

So, plugging into the equation.

First, compute the term (V - n b):

V =4.860 L

n b =10.0 mol * 0.063 L/mol =0.63 L

So V - n b =4.860 -0.63 =4.23 L

Then, compute RT: R is 0.08206 L atm/mol K, T=300 K.

RT=0.08206 *300 =24.618 L atm/mol.

So nRT =10.0 *24.618=246.18 L atm.

So the first term is nRT/(V -nb) =246.18 /4.23 ≈58.24 atm.

Wait, let me compute that. 4.23 times 58 is 245.34; 4.23*58.24= Let me just divide 246.18 /4.23.

4.23 goes into 246.18 how many times? 4.23 *58=245.34, so 58 times with 0.84 left over. 0.84/4.23≈0.198 → so approximately 58.20 atm.

So the first term is about 58.20 atm.

Now compute the second term: (n² a)/V².

n=10 →n²=100.

a=5.329 L² atm/mol².

V=4.860 L → V²= (4.860)^2 =23.6196 L².

So (n² a)/V² = (100 *5.329)/23.6196 → (532.9)/23.6196≈22.56 atm.

So the second term is approximately 22.56 atm.

Now, the pressure P is the first term minus the second term: 58.20 -22.56=35.64 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact value. Let's check the options:

A:32.7 atm

B:28.6

C:42.3

D:45.1

E:30.9

F:37.8

G:40.5

H:35.2

I:25.4

J:33.5

So 35.64 is close to option H:35.2 atm. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I made some miscalculations. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, let me recalculate nRT/(V - nb):

nRT =10 *0.08206 *300 =10 *24.618=246.18.

V - nb =4.860 - (10 *0.063) =4.860 -0.63=4.23 L.

So 246.18 /4.23 → let's compute that more accurately.

4.23 *58 = 245.34 → the difference is 246.18-245.34=0.84.

0.84 /4.23 = approx 0.1985.

So total is 58.1985 ≈58.20 atm.

Then the second term, (n² a)/V².

n²=100, a=5.329 (L² atm/mol²)

V²=4.860²=23.6196 L².

So (100 *5.329)/23.6196 → 532.9 /23.6196.

Let me compute this accurately.

532.9 ÷ 23.6196.

23.6196 ×22=519.6352 → subtract from 532.9 → 532.9 -519.6352=13.2648.

Now, 13.2648 /23.6196 ≈0.561 → so total is 22.561.

So the second term is approx 22.561 atm.

So P=58.20 -22.561=35.639 atm.

So approximately 35.64 atm. The closest option is H:35.2 atm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the a value or unit conversion.

Wait, earlier I converted a from bar to atm, but maybe I should have kept a in bar and R in bar units. Because that might affect the calculation. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: keep a in dm³² bar/mol², and R in dm³ bar/(mol K).

Because 1 dm³ =1 L, and 1 bar is about 0.9869 atm.

Wait, but the answer needs to be in atm. So perhaps it's better to compute P in bar first, then convert to atm.

Let me try this approach.

So, R in dm³·bar/(mol·K) is 0.08314 × (because the usual R is 0.08314 L·bar/mol·K, since 1 L=1 dm³.)

So R =0.08314 dm³ bar/(mol K).

Now, a is 5.4 (dm³)^2 bar/mol².

b is 0.063 dm³/mol.

So, let's recompute with these values.

So,

n=10.0 mol

V=4.860 dm³

T=300 K

R=0.08314 dm³ bar/mol K.

Compute each term.

First term: (nRT)/(V -n b).

nRT=10.0 *0.08314 *300 → 10 *24.942=249.42 dm³ bar.

V-nb=4.860 - (10 *0.063)=4.860 -0.63=4.23 dm³.

So first term:249.42 /4.23 ≈58.96 bar.

Second term: (n² a)/V².

n²=100.

a=5.4 (dm³)^2 bar/mol².

V²=4.860²=23.6196 dm³².

So (100 *5.4)/23.6196 →540/23.6196≈22.85 bar.

So P=58.96 -22.85=36.11 bar.

Now, convert bar to atm: 1 bar ≈0.9869 atm.

So 36.11 bar *0.9869 atm/bar ≈35.64 atm.

Same result as before. So about 35.64 atm.

Looking back at the options, the closest is H:35.2 atm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in a or b values. Let me check more accurate a and b values for ethane.

Wait, maybe the a and b I used were approximate. Let me double-check the correct van der Waals constants for ethane.

Upon checking (I think), the correct a and b for ethane are:

a = 5.4 (dm³)^2 bar/mol²

b = 0.063 dm³/mol

So that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly 35.6. Wait, option H is 35.2, which is close. But perhaps I should check the calculations again for any possible error.

Wait, perhaps when I computed (nRT)/(V-nb), maybe I made a mistake.

nRT=10 *0.08314 *300 =10 *24.942 =249.42 dm³ bar.

V-nb=4.23 dm³.

249.42 /4.23 = let me compute this more accurately.

4.23 goes into 249.42.

Compute 4.23 *58=?

4 *58=232, 0.23*58=13.34 → 232+13.34=245.34.

So 58 times gives 245.34, subtract from 249.42: 249.42-245.34=4.08.

4.08 /4.23 = approx 0.965.

So total is 58.965 bar.

So 58.965 bar.

Second term: (100 *5.4)/23.6196 →540 /23.6196.

23.6196 *22=519.6332. 540-519.6332=20.3668.

20.3668 /23.6196 ≈0.862 → so total is 22.862 bar.

So P=58.965 -22.862 =36.103 bar.

Convert to atm: 36.103 *0.9869 ≈35.64 atm.

Wait, but the options don't have 35.64. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should try computing more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the a and b values are different. Let me confirm.

Wait, I found a source that says for ethane, a = 5.4 (dm³)^2 bar/mol² and b=0.063 dm³/mol. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the van der Waals equation.

Wait, another thought: the van der Waals equation is [P + (n² a)/V²] [V/n - b] = RT.

So when solving for P, it's P = [nRT/(V - nb)] - [n² a / V²]

Wait, let me re-calculate the first term correctly.

Because sometimes when you expand, you might have to factor in the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term with precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try using different units for R, like in terms of dm³ and bar.

Wait, let me try another approach.

Compute each part using exact numbers:

Compute V - nb:

V =4.860 dm³

nb=10 *0.063=0.63 dm³

V - nb=4.860 -0.63=4.23 dm³.

Compute nRT:

n=10, R=0.08314 dm³ bar/mol K, T=300 K.

nRT=10 *0.08314 *300 =10 *24.942=249.42 dm³ bar.

So the first term is 249.42 /4.23 =58.965 bar.

Compute the second term:

n² a =100 *5.4 =540 (dm³)^2 bar/mol².

V²= (4.860)^2 =23.6196 dm³².

So (n² a)/V²=540 /23.6196=22.862 bar.

So P=58.965 -22.862=36.103 bar.

Now, 36.103 bar * (1 atm /0.9869 bar)=approx 36.103 *1.01325≈36.56 atm.

Wait, wait, no: 1 bar =0.9869 atm → so to get atm, multiply bar by 0.9869.

So 36.103 bar *0.9869 = let me compute that.

36 *0.9869=35.5484.

0.103 *0.9869≈0.1017.

So total is 35.5484 +0.1017=35.6501 atm ≈35.65 atm.

So about 35.65 atm, which is approximately 35.6 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:35.2 atm. But wait, option H is 35.2, and my calculation is 35.65, which is a bit higher. None of the options exactly match, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the van der Waals equation again.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should have used the critical constants or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in converting a from bar to atm.

Wait, let me try keeping a in bar and R in bar units, then see.

So:

nRT=10 *0.08314 *300=249.42 dm³ bar.

V-nb=4.23 dm³.

So term1=249.42/4.23=58.965 bar.

n² a=100 *5.4=540 dm³² bar/mol².

V²=23.6196 dm³².

term2=540/23.6196=22.862 bar.

So P=58.965 -22.862=36.103 bar.

Convert to atm: 36.103 *0.9869≈35.65 atm.

Hmm. No option matches exactly, but the closest is H:35.2, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations with more precise steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in V-nb calculation.

Wait, V=4.860 dm³, nb=10 *0.063=0.63 dm³ → V-nb=4.23 dm³. That seems correct.

nRT=10 *0.08314 *300=10*24.942=249.42.

term1=249.42/4.23=
