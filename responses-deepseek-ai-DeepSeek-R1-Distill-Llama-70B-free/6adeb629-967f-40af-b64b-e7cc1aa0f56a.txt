Okay, I need to figure out what catharsis means and how catharsis theorists say aggression can be controlled. I remember that catharsis is a concept from psychology, probably related to releasing emotions. Let me think about what I learned in my classes.

Catharsis, I think, comes from the Greek word for purification or cleansing. In psychology, I believe it's about releasing pent-up emotions, especially negative ones like anger or aggression. So, the idea is that if you have a lot of aggressive energy inside, you can get rid of it by expressing it in some way.

Now, the question is about controlling aggression through catharsis. So, the theory would suggest that by letting out this aggression, you reduce the likelihood of it causing problems. Like, if someone is angry, they might punch a pillow or play a sport to get that aggression out. That way, they don't act out in harmful ways.

Looking at the options now. Option A says catharsis is releasing aggressive energy and controlling it by channeling into productive or neutral outlets. That sounds right because it's about redirecting the energy. Option B says it increases aggression, which doesn't make sense because catharsis is supposed to reduce it. Option C mentions competitive sports but without emotional release, which contradicts because catharsis is about release. Option I talks about transforming into creative expression, which could be a form of catharsis but isn't the general definition.

Option D suggests isolating individuals, which doesn't fit because catharsis is about expressing, not avoiding. E is avoiding triggers, which is a different approach. F says aggression dissipates on its own, which isn't catharsis. G is redirecting without control, which might not be healthy. H is reinforcing aggression, which is the opposite. J is suppressing, not releasing.

So the best answer seems to be A. It correctly describes catharsis as releasing aggressive energy and controlling it through productive outlets.

Catharsis refers to the process of releasing pent-up aggressive energy, and theorists suggest that this can help control aggression by redirecting it into more productive or neutral activities. This approach allows individuals to express their emotions in a way that prevents harmful behavior.
