Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question. The question is about a performance formula: Performance = Expectation × Value. I need to match this to the correct theorist and their school of thought from the given options.

Let me start by breaking down the formula. It's Performance equals Expectation multiplied by Value. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I remember that in psychology, especially in motivation theories, there's something called Expectancy Theory or something similar. Oh right, there's the Expectancy-Value Theory which suggests that a person's motivation to perform a task is influenced by their expectation of success and the value they place on the outcome.

Wait, but which theorist is associated with that? I think it's Edward Tolman. He was a behavioral psychologist, right? And he talked about how behavior is driven by purposes and cognitions, not just stimuli and responses. So he proposed that behavior is goal-oriented and that the expectation of achieving a goal and the value placed on that goal are key factors.

Looking at the options, option C is Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory. That fits because the formula directly relates to expectations and values. So I think that's the right choice.

Other options don't seem to fit. For example, Clark Hull's Reinforcement Theory (option F) was more about drive reduction and reinforcement. Abraham Maslow (option B) is about the hierarchy of needs, which is a different model. Skinner (option I) is operant conditioning, which is about reinforcement and punishment, not exactly about expectation and value in this way.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is C.

The formula Performance = Expectation × Value is associated with Edward Tolman and the Expectancy-Value Theory. This theory posits that motivation is influenced by the expectation of achieving a goal and the value placed on that goal. Among the options provided, option C correctly identifies Edward Tolman and the Expectancy-Value Theory as the source of this formula.

Answer: C
