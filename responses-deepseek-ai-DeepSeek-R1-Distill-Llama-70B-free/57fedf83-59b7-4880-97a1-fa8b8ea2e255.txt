Question:

Which of the following is NOT true about the difference between traditional research and program evaluation?

Options:

A: Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.
B: Traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.
C: Both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data in order to address their aims.
D: Program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a program’s staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research.

Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about the differences between traditional research and program evaluation. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is NOT true. Let me break this down step by step.

So, the question is asking which option is incorrect regarding their differences. The options are A through D. I'll go through each one.

Option A says that program evaluation uses unique methodologies different from traditional research. Wait, I remember that program evaluation might use similar methods, like both quantitative and qualitative approaches. They might not be entirely unique. So maybe A is the incorrect statement. But I'm not sure yet, I'll keep this in mind.

Option B states that traditional research aims to test theories and find generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation is for timely decision-making. That sounds right. Research is more about theory and broad applications, whereas evaluations are often to assess a specific program's effectiveness for decision-makers. So B seems correct.

Option C: Both use rigorous and systematic data collection. Yes, both methods are systematic. Research requires rigor for validity, and evaluations do too to ensure their findings are reliable for decisions. So C is true, not the answer.

Option D: Evaluation questions come from program staff and stakeholders, while research questions come from existing research. That makes sense. Evaluations are often driven by the needs of the people running the program, whereas researchers might base their questions on previous studies. So D is correct.

Going back to Option A. Do program evaluations use unique methods? I thought that both fields use similar methodologies—like surveys, interviews, observations. The difference is more in their purpose and application, not the methods themselves. So A is likely the incorrect statement because it's not true that evaluation uses unique methods different from research. They might use the same methods but for different aims.

So the answer should be A.

The question asks which statement is NOT true about the differences between traditional research and program evaluation. 

- **Option A** claims that program evaluation uses unique methodologies distinct from traditional research. This is incorrect because both often use similar methods (e.g., surveys, interviews) but apply them for different purposes.
- **Option B** correctly states that traditional research aims to test theories and generate generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation focuses on decision-making.
- **Option C** is true, as both approaches use rigorous and systematic data collection.
- **Option D** is correct, as evaluation questions often stem from program stakeholders, whereas research questions are frequently based on existing studies.

Thus, the incorrect statement is **Option A**.

Answer: A
