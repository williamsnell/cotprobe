Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about types of non-random samples. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about sampling methods.

Okay, I remember that in statistics, samples can be categorized into random (or probability) and non-random (or non-probability) samples. The question is asking about non-random samples, so I need to identify which of the options are examples of that.

Let me list out the different sampling methods I can think of. There's random sampling, which includes methods like simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing things up. Because some sources say that stratified, cluster, and systematic are all types of random sampling. Or are they?

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. Stratified sampling is when you divide the population into subgroups (strata) and then randomly select from each. So that's a random method. Similarly, cluster sampling involves selecting clusters randomly. Systematic sampling is where you select every nth individual, which is also a random method. So these would all be probability sampling methods.

Then what's non-probability? I remember that non-probability samples are methods where not every individual has an equal chance of being selected. So examples would include convenience sampling, where you take whoever is easy to reach. Quota sampling, where you select people based on certain criteria to match a quota. Then there's purposive sampling, snowball sampling, etc.

So the question is about non-random (non-probability) samples. The options given are various pairs, and I need to pick which pair includes non-random types.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Random and quota samples. Well, random is a probability method, so this can't be right because the question is about non-random.

Option B: Cluster and systematic. Both of these are random methods, so this is probability sampling, not non-random.

Option C: Stratified and random. Both are random, so no.

Option D: Random and systematic. Again, both are random.

Option E: Random and cluster. Same issue.

Option F: Systematic and quota. Wait, systematic is random, but quota is non-random. So this pair includes one random and one non-random. The question is about non-random types, so this might not be the correct option unless both are non-random.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, is systematic sampling considered non-random? Or is it a random method? I think systematic is a type of random sampling because it uses a system (like every nth) but starts with a random pick. So systematic is random, which makes F not correct.

Option G: Stratified and quota. Stratified is random, quota is non-random. So again, one of each. Not a pair of non-random.

Option H: Convenience and quota. Both are non-random. Because convenience is when you take whoever is available, and quota is selecting based on certain characteristics without random selection. So both are non-probability.

Option I: Stratified and convenience. Stratified is random, convenience is non-random. So again, a mix.

So the correct answer should be H: Convenience and quota samples, both being non-random.

The question asks about types of non-random (non-probability) samples. Non-random samples are methods where not every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. Examples include convenience sampling and quota sampling. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, G, I**: These options include at least one random sampling method (e.g., stratified, cluster, systematic, or random), so they are not correct since the question focuses on non-random samples.  
- **F**: Systematic sampling is a random method, so this option is incorrect.  
- **H**: Convenience and quota sampling are both non-random methods, making this the correct choice.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: Convenience and quota samples**.
