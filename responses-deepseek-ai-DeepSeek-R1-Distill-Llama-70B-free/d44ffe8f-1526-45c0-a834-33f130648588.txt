Okay, so I have this question about defining emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Hmm, I need to pick the correct option from A to J. Let me think about what each part means.

Emotion is a complex topic, but I remember that it involves multiple components. Feelings are the subjective experiences, like feeling happy or sad. Responses could be both physiological, like a racing heart, and behavioral, like crying or smiling. Motivation refers to how emotions drive us to act in certain ways, such as seeking happiness or avoiding fear.

Looking at the options:

Option A says emotion is a state of anger. That's too narrow because emotions include many more states like happiness, fear, etc.

Option B talks about behavioral displays without internal feelings. That doesn't sound right because emotions definitely involve internal feelings and motivations.

Option C mentions the conscious experience of affect, but limits it to pleasure or pain. Emotions are more varied than just those two.

Option D is about happiness. Again, too narrow.

Option E says emotion is a complex state with heightened arousal, defined by feelings, responses, and motivation. That sounds comprehensive and fits what I was thinking.

Option F describes an involuntary reaction without feelings or motivation. That doesn't seem right because emotions do involve feelings and often motivate actions.

Option G refers to long-lasting moods without clear causes. Emotions are usually shorter-term and have specific triggers.

Option H focuses on physiological responses to cognitive judgments. While cognition can influence emotions, this option might not cover all aspects like feelings and motivational drives.

Option I says emotions are transient social constructs varying across cultures. While cultural differences exist, emotions are more universal and biological, not just social constructs.

Option J is about sadness, again too narrow.

So the best fit seems to be option E. It captures the complexity, including feelings, responses (both physical and behavioral), and motivation, all tied together with heightened arousal.

The correct answer is E: Emotion is a complex state characterized by heightened arousal level, defined in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation.
