Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the specific gravity of a rectangular iron bar. Hmm, specific gravity is something I remember from science class. I think it's the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of water. Right, water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter at standard conditions, so specific gravity is basically the density of the object divided by 1 g/cm³, which makes it a unitless quantity.

The problem gives me the mass of the iron bar as 320 grams. And the dimensions are 2 cm by 2 cm by 10 cm. So I guess I need to calculate the volume first. Volume for a rectangular shape is length times width times height. Let me plug in the numbers: 2 * 2 * 10. That should be 40 cubic centimeters. Oh wait, 2 times 2 is 4, and 4 times 10 is 40. Yep, so volume is 40 cm³.

Now, density is mass divided by volume. The mass is 320 grams, so density is 320 g / 40 cm³. Let me do that division. 320 divided by 40 is 8. So the density of the iron bar is 8 grams per cubic centimeter.

Since specific gravity is the density of the substance divided by the density of water, and water is 1 g/cm³, then specific gravity would just be 8 divided by 1, which is 8. So the specific gravity here is 8.

Looking at the options, option H is 8. So the correct answer should be H.

The specific gravity is calculated by dividing the density of the iron bar by the density of water. The volume of the bar is 2 × 2 × 10 = 40 cm³. The density is mass divided by volume: 320 g / 40 cm³ = 8 g/cm³. Since water's density is 1 g/cm³, the specific gravity is 8 / 1 = 8. 

The correct answer is H.
