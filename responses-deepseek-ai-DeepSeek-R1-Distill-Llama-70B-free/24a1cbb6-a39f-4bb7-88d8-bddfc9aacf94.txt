Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Okada and his property taxes. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem says Mr. Okada's home is worth $28,750. But the town assesses homes at 38% of their market value. I think that means the assessed value is 38% of $28,750. So I need to calculate that first.

Let me do the math: 38% of 28,750. Hmm, 28,750 multiplied by 0.38. Let's see, 28,750 * 0.3 is 8,625. And 28,750 * 0.08 is 2,300. Adding those together gives 8,625 + 2,300 = 10,925. So the assessed value is $10,925.

Next, the property tax rate is $8.42 per $100 of assessed value. So I need to find out how much tax Mr. Okada pays. That sounds like (assessed value / 100) * tax rate. So 10,925 divided by 100 is 109.25. Multiply that by 8.42.

Calculating 109.25 * 8.42. Let me break it down. 100 * 8.42 is 842. 9.25 * 8.42 is ... Hmm, 9 * 8.42 is 75.78, and 0.25 *8.42 is 2.105. Adding those gives 75.78 + 2.105 = 77.885. So total tax is 842 +77.885 = 919.885, which I'll round to about $919.89.

Now, 47% of that tax goes to education. So I need to find 47% of 919.89. Let's calculate that: 919.89 * 0.47. 

Breaking it down: 900 *0.47 is 423. 19.89 *0.47 is approximately 9.35. So adding those gives 423 +9.35 = 432.35. So the amount that goes to education is $432.35.

Looking at the options, option D is $432.35. So the answer should be D.

To determine how much of Mr. Okada's property taxes goes toward education, we proceed as follows:

1. **Assessed Value Calculation**:  
   The home is worth $28,750 and is assessed at 38% of its market value.  
   \[
   \text{Assessed Value} = 28,750 \times 0.38 = 10,925
   \]

2. **Property Tax Calculation**:  
   The tax rate is $8.42 per $100 of assessed value.  
   \[
   \text{Property Tax} = \left(\frac{10,925}{100}\right) \times 8.42 = 919.89
   \]

3. **Education Portion of Taxes**:  
   47% of the property taxes are allocated to education.  
   \[
   \text{Education Portion} = 919.89 \times 0.47 = 432.35
   \]

Thus, the amount of taxes that goes toward education is **$432.35**.

Answer: D
