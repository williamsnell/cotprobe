Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about writing a Fortran function for the Poisson distribution. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

The Poisson distribution formula is given as P(X) = e^(-m) * m^X / X! Right? So I need to translate that into a Fortran function.

Looking at the options, they all seem to be function definitions. Each starts with FUNCTION P(X,M) and has some variable declarations. The variables X and M are integers as per the question's conditions.

Wait, in Fortran, when you're doing exponentials, you use the EXP function. So for e^(-m), that's EXP(-M), but wait M is an integer variable. Oh, right, but in the functions, some of them cast M into a real using FLOAT(M). Like in option B, M is an integer, but when calculating EXP(-M), since M is an integer, EXP might not like that. Or does Fortran implicitly convert it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But maybe it's better to explicitly convert M to a real first. Like Y = FLOAT(M), then use Y in the exponent.

Looking at each option:

Option B: P = EXP(-M) * M**X / FACT(X). Wait, M is an integer, but when you do -M, does that cause any issues? Also, in Fortran, the exponentiation is **, which is correct. But if M is large, converting it to real might help avoid integer overflow or any calculation issues. So maybe using Y = FLOAT(M) is better.

Option D: Y is FLOAT(M). Then P = EXP(-Y) * M^X / FACT(X). Wait, but M is an integer, Y is a real. So M^X would be integer raised to an integer power. But when X is large, this might get big, but the question says variables are small enough to avoid overflow. However, using M here might not be the best. Shouldn't it be Y instead? Because Y is the real version of M. So using Y^X would make more sense, especially for non-integer X, but wait X is an integer in the question. Oh, but in Fortran, M**X where M is integer and X is integer is fine, but when M is cast to real and used as Y, perhaps it's better to use Y**X for consistency, especially if Y is a real.

Wait but the formula is m^X, so whether it's M or Y doesn't matter as long as it's m. Since Y is FLOAT(M), Y is m as a real. So in option B, M**X is correct since M is integer. But in option D, it's M^X, which is same as option B. Wait no, in D, Y is FLOAT(M), but they're using M in M ** X. That seems a bit odd. Why not use Y?

Wait, m in the formula is a real number, but in this question, m is an integer. So perhaps it's better to compute it as a real. So maybe the correct approach is to compute EXP(-Y) where Y is FLOAT(M), then multiply by Y^X, then divide by FACT(X).

Wait, looking at option I: It has Y=FLOAT(M), and P is EXP(-Y) divided by (M^X * FACT(X)). Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. Option I says P = EXP(-Y) / (M ** X * FACT(X)). Wait, that would be e^(-m)/(m^X * X!) which is correct. So that fits the formula.

But wait, why is M used instead of Y in M ** X? Because M is integer. Oh wait, in option I, M is the integer, but maybe it's better to use Y for exponentiation since Y is real. Because if someone passes a large M, M**X might cause integer overflow, but since the question states that variables are small enough, it's acceptable. But using Y might be better practice.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option B: It's P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X). So M is integer; EXP needs a real. Does Fortran automatically convert it? I think it does. So EXP(-M) is e^(-M), but since M is an integer, it's okay. Then M^X is m^X, and divided by X! So that fits the formula. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. In option B, the variables X and M are declared as integers, which is correct. So the function looks okay.

But let me check other options. Option I, for example, uses Y=FLOAT(M), then computes EXP(-Y), which is correct, but then divides by (M ** X * FACT(X)), which is same as option B's denominator. So option I and B are similar, but I uses Y in the exponent.

Wait, let me compute both. Option B: e^(-M) * M^X / X! Which is correct. Option I: e^(-Y) / (M^X * X! ), which is same as option B, because Y is M. So both options B and I seem to compute the same value. But wait, in option I, it's EXP(-Y) divided by (M^X * X!), whereas option B is EXP(-M) * M^X / X!.

Wait, no, because option I is e^(-Y)/(M^X * X!) ) = e^(-m) / (m^X X! ), which is the same as option B's e^(-m) * m^X / X! No, wait wait, no. Option B is (e^-m) * (m^X) / (X!) ), which is correct. Option I is (e^-m) / (m^X * X! ), which is incorrect. Oh! That's a mistake. So option I has the denominator as m^X * X! Which would make the formula e^-m divided by (m^X X!), which is not the Poisson formula. So option I is wrong.

Wait no, wait. Let me compute the formula correctly. Poisson is e^(-m) * (m^x) / x! So the correct expression is e^(-m) multiplied by m^x, divided by x!.

So in option B, it's correct: EXP(-M) * M**X / FACT(X).

Option I is EXP(-Y) / (M ** X * FACT(X)) → which is e^(-m)/(m^x x!) → which is incorrect. So option I is wrong.

So the correct function is option B. Because it correctly computes e^-m * m^x / x!.

Wait but wait, looking again. Option D: Y = FLOAT(M), then EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X). So that's e^(-m) * m^x / x! So that's the same as option B. So what's the difference between B and D?

Option B doesn't use Y; it uses M directly. So in B, m is an integer, but EXP(-M) is e^-m correctly. So both B and D compute the same thing. But why would they have different options?

Wait, but in option D, M is an integer, so M ** X is integer exponentiation. While in option B, it's the same. But in Fortran, the result of M ** X when M is integer and X is integer is an integer. But when you multiply by EXP(-M), which is a real, the overall result becomes real, I think. So both options B and D compute the same value.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in option B, the calculation is done using M as integer, but in D, Y is FLOAT(M). So in D, M is still integer when doing M ** X. So why make Y = FLOAT(M) if you're not using it in the exponent?

So looking at D, the code is:

Y = FLOAT(M)

P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X)

So it computes e^(-Y) where Y is real, but then M is integer. So M^X is same as Y^X since Y is M converted to real. Wait, but M is integer, so when you do M^X, it's integer exponentiation. But X is also an integer, so that's okay. However, if M is a large number, M^X could cause integer overflow, but the question says variables are small enough.

So the difference between B and D is in how they handle the exponent. In option B, EXP(-M) is e^(-M), M is integer. In D, EXP(-Y) is e^(-M) since Y is FLOAT(M).

But in Fortran, if you pass an integer to EXP, it's converted to real automatically. So both should give same results. So why are there two options that seem correct?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Option B: function P(X, M) integer X, M. So P is a function returning real? Or is it implicitly typed? In Fortran, the function's type is determined by the FUNCTION statement. Since P is assigned a real value (like EXP which returns real), the function returns real. So that's correct.

Option D: Y is FLOAT(M), but M is integer. So Y is real. So EXP(-Y) is correct. But then M ** X is integer exponentiation. So P would be e^(-m) * (m^x as integer) / (X! as integer). So when you divide two integers, you get a real? Or does Fortran do integer division? Wait, no, when you do division with a real numerator, the result is real.

Wait, let me think about Fortran's data types. If you have a real multiplied by an integer divided by another integer, the overall result is real. So in option D, M ** X is integer, but when multiplied by a real (EXP(-Y)), the result is real. So option D is correct.

Wait, but then both option B and D seem to be correct. That can't be right because the question is multiple choice with a single answer.

Hmm, what's the difference between them. Let me look again.

Option B:

P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X)

Option D:

Y = FLOAT(M)
P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X)

Wait, but in option B, EXP(-M). Since M is integer, does that cause any issues? Probably not, as Fortran can handle converting integer to real for the EXP function.

Wait, but in option B, it's possible that M is negative? No, because Poisson's m is a positive real usually. But since M is an integer variable, it can't be negative in this context, I think. So both options B and D are correct? Or am I missing something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order of operations. Let's compute each step.

In option B:

- EXP(-M): computes e^(-M) correctly as M is integer.

- M ** X: computes m^x as integer.

- Then multiplies by e^(-m), so e^(-m) * m^x as integer.

Then divides by FACT(X), which is X! as integer.

So the result is (e^(-m) * m^x ) / x! which is correct.

In option D:

Y is FLOAT(M), so Y = m as real.

EXP(-Y) computes e^(-m) correctly.

M ** X is m^x as integer.

So same as option B, because M is integer, Y is same as M. So same value.

Wait, but wait a minute. What about when M is a large integer? For example, M=100, X=50. M ** X is a huge number, which might exceed the maximum integer size. But the question says that variables are small enough, so it's acceptable.

So both options B and D compute the same result. So why are there two options?

Looking again, perhaps I'm missing a detail. Oh, wait! In option B, it's M ** X. Since M is integer and X is integer, M ** X is integer. But when you multiply by a real (EXP(-M) is real), the result is real. So the entire expression is correct.

Similarly, in D, M is integer, so same as above.

Wait, but perhaps in option B, the calculation is done as:

( EXP(-M) ) * ( M ** X ) / FACT(X)

Which is correct.

But wait, let's check the syntax of the Fortran functions.

Looking at option B: It's written as

FUNCTION P(X,M) INTEGER X, M

P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X)

RETURN

END

Yes, that's correct.

Option D is:

Y = FLOAT(M)

P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X)

So same as B, but with Y in the exponent.

Wait, but why? Because perhaps for very large M, converting to real helps in EXP.

Wait, but in option B, since M is an integer, when you do EXP(-M), it's converted to real. So same result as option D.

Wait, but perhaps in some Fortran compilers, using a real in the exponent is better. But logically, both options B and D should compute the same value.

But looking back at the question, the options are mutually exclusive. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other errors. For example, in option B, the order of operations. Let me compute e^-m * (m^x) / x! . Option B does that.

Option I: P = EXP(-Y) / (M ** X * FACT(X)), which would be e^(-m)/(m^x x! ), which is wrong.

So option I is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula again. Poisson formula is e^(-m) * (m^x) / x! So numerator is e^(-m) * m^x, denominator is x!.

So in Fortran, it's EXP(-m) * (m ** x) / FACT(x)

So option B does exactly that.

Option D also does that, except it converts m to a real before taking the exponential.

But wait, in option D, the M in M ** X is integer. If M is a large integer, M ** X could cause integer overflow, but the question says variables are small enough. So both are correct.

Wait no, wait another thing. In option D, M is integer, X is integer, so M ** X is integer. If M is, say, 10 and X is 5, M^X is 1e5 which is 100000. But if M is big, say 20 and X is 100, M^X is 20^100 which is way larger than the maximum integer size. But the question says variables are small enough so that no term will exceed the permitted real variable size. Wait, but M ** X is an integer here. So if it's too big, it would cause an integer overflow. So perhaps better to compute Y ** X, where Y is a real.

But in option D, it's M ** X, which is integer. So that's a problem. Because if M and X are small, it's okay, but in general, using M ** X as integer could cause overflow.

But the question states that "X and m are small enough that no term will exceed the size permitted for a real variable in your computer". So perhaps it's acceptable even if M ** X is computed as integer.

Hmm, maybe both B and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only option B is correct. Or perhaps I'm missing another point.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is:

P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X)

Option D is:

P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X)

Which is the same as option B, except EXP(-Y) instead of EXP(-M). But since Y is FLOAT(M), both are same. So both options compute the same value.

Wait, that can't be. Unless there's a typo in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B because it's simpler. Or maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking at option B again, it's computing e^(-M) correctly, multiplying by M^X, then dividing by X! So it fits the formula.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait, looking at option B and D again, perhaps I should think about the order of operations. For example, in option B, the calculation is (EXP(-M) * M ** X ) / FACT(X). Which is correct.

But in option D, it's the same calculation, except that Y is used in the exponent. So both are correct.

But the question says to choose the correct one. So perhaps I'm missing something about Fortran syntax.

Wait, in Fortran, when you have integer variables in the exponent, is that allowed? For example, M is integer, and X is integer. So in option B, M ** X is correct as it's integer exponentiation.

Wait, but in Fortran, the exponent can be an integer or a real? I think the base can be any numeric type, and the exponent can be any numeric type as well. So M ** X is allowed because both are integers, but the result is integer. However, when you multiply by a real (EXP(-M)), the result becomes real.

So both options B and D should produce the same result.

Wait, but there's another option to check. Let's look at option I again.

Option I: Y = FLOAT(M), P = EXP(-Y) / (M ** X * FACT(X)).

Wait, that's e^(-m) divided by (m^x * x! ), which is wrong. So option I is incorrect.

So now, let me reevaluate. Since both B and D compute the same thing, perhaps I'm missing something else in the options.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I should check for the correct syntax. For example, in Fortran, the function must have the correct parameter types.

In option B, the function is declared as FUNCTION P(X,M) INTEGER X, M. Then, P is assigned a real value, which is correct.

Wait, but in Fortran, the function's return type is implied by the statements. Since the right-hand side is real, P will be real. So that's correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but why is option D an option? Maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I. No, because I's formula is wrong.

Wait, another approach: think about evaluating each option with sample values.

Let's take m=2, x=1.

Poisson formula: e^(-2) * 2^1 / 1! = (0.1353) * 2 / 1 ≈ 0.2707.
