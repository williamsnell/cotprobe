Question:

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens to the preRNA during RNA processing?

Options:

A: Point mutations are repaired, introns are removed, and both a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail are added after the preRNA leaves the nucleus.
B: Point mutations are repaired, exons are removed, and both a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.
C: Exons are removed in the nucleus. A 5′ cap and the poly-A tail are added after the preRNA leaves the nucleus.
D: Exons are removed and a 5′ cap is added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, the poly-A tail is added.
E: Introns are removed and a poly-A tail is added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, the 5′ cap is added.
F: Introns are removed in the nucleus. A 5′ cap and the poly-A tail are added after the preRNA leaves the nucleus.
G: Introns are removed and both a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.
H: Both a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, introns are removed.
I: Introns are removed, exons are added, and both a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.
J: Introns are removed and a 5′ cap is added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, the poly-A tail is added.

Okay, so I've got this RNA processing question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through what I remember about RNA processing. I remember that preRNA is the precursor mRNA, right? And processing involves a few main steps: adding a 5' cap, adding a poly-A tail, and removing introns.

Wait, the question is about what happens to the preRNA during processing. So, I think preRNA is in the nucleus. The processing occurs there before it's exported to the cytoplasm.

So, the steps I remember are: first, the 5' cap is added almost immediately after transcription begins. Then, the introns are spliced out, meaning they're removed, and the exons are joined together. After that, the poly-A tail is added to the 3' end. And all of this happens in the nucleus before the mRNA is sent out to the cytoplasm for translation.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Point mutations repaired, introns removed, cap and poly-A added after leaving nucleus. Hmm, wait, I don't think point mutations are repaired during RNA processing. That's more like DNA repair mechanisms. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Point mutations repaired again, exons removed? No, exons are kept, introns removed. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Exons removed in nucleus? No, introns are removed. So C is wrong.

Option D: Exons removed? No, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Introns removed, poly-A added before leaving. Then 5' cap added after. No, I thought the cap is added before, in the nucleus. So E is wrong.

Option F: Introns removed in nucleus; cap and tail added after. No, cap and tail are added before, I believe. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Introns removed and both cap and tail added before leaving nucleus. That sounds right. Because preRNA processing includes capping, splicing, and poly-A addition, all before export.

Option H: Cap and tail before, introns removed after. No, introns are removed before leaving the nucleus. So H is wrong.

Option I: Introns removed, exons added—wait, exons are already present. They're just joined. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Introns removed, cap added before leaving; tail added after. No, I think the poly-A tail is added before leaving.

So the correct answer must be option G. Let me double-check. In the nucleus, preRNA is processed: 5' cap added early, then splicing (introns removed), then poly-A tail added. All before the mRNA leaves the nucleus. So yes, option G is correct.

During RNA processing, preRNA undergoes several modifications in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm. These include the addition of a 5′ cap shortly after transcription begins, the removal of introns (splicing), and the addition of a poly-A tail at the 3′ end. All these steps occur while the preRNA is still in the nucleus. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, E, F, H, I, J**: These options either incorrectly describe the order of events, the location of modifications, or include irrelevant processes like repairing point mutations or removing exons. 
- **C**: Incorrectly states that exons are removed, which is not true since exons are retained.
- **G**: Correctly describes that introns are removed and both a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G
