Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a hiker caught in a thunderstorm who's losing heat because her clothes are wet. She has emergency rations that release 35 kJ of heat per gram when metabolized. The question is asking how much of these rations she needs to consume to avoid a 2.5 K drop in body temperature. They also mention that the heat capacity of the body is the same as water, and she weighs 51 kg.

Hmm, right. So body temperature is related to heat loss. Heat loss can be calculated using the heat capacity formula, which I think is Q = mcΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Wait, but wait. She's losing heat, and the rations release heat when metabolized. So the heat from the rations needs to balance the heat loss from her body. Oh, right, because if the heat she generates equals the heat she's losing, her temperature won't drop.

So the heat required to prevent the temperature drop is the same as the heat released by the rations. So, I can set up two equations:

1. The heat loss from her body: Q_body = m_body * c_water * ΔT
2. The heat from the rations: Q_rations = m_rations * heat_per_gram

Since Q_body must equal Q_rations to prevent temperature change, we can set them equal.

Let me jot down the numbers:

- m_body = 51 kg. Wait, but specific heat capacity is usually in kg, right? Oh wait, no, the problem says to assume the heat capacity of the body is that of water. So c is 4186 J/kg·K, right? Because water's specific heat is around 4186 J per kg per Kelvin.

Wait, but wait, the problem states the rations release 35 kJ per gram. Oh right, that's 35,000 J per gram. Because 1 kJ is 1000 J.

So, putting it all together:

Q_body = m_body * c_water * ΔT
Q_rations = m_rations * (35,000 J/g)

Setting Q_body = Q_rations:

m_body * c_water * ΔT = m_rations * 35,000

We need to solve for m_rations.

Wait, but units. Let's make sure all the units are compatible.

m_body is in kg, c_water is J/(kg·K), ΔT is K, so Q_body is J.

m_rations is in grams, so I need to convert that to kg if needed, but wait, 35,000 J per gram is J/g. So actually, we should probably handle the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert m_rations to kg, but maybe grams are okay. Let me think.

Wait, the equation is:

51 kg * 4186 J/(kg·K) * 2.5 K = m_rations (g) * 35,000 J/g

Wait, but wait, kg and grams. Wait, 51 kg is 51,000 grams. But in this equation, m_rations is in grams, and 35,000 J/g is per gram.

Wait, no, let me clarify. Let me write down the equation with proper units.

Left side (Q_body): 51 kg * 4186 J/(kg·K) * 2.5 K
Right side (Q_rations): m_rations (g) * 35,000 J/g

Wait, but the kg and g units must be consistent. Wait, no, because the left side is in J, and the right side is in J as well. Because m_rations is in grams, multiplied by J per gram, gives J. Similarly, the left side is kg * (J/(kg·K)) * K → J.

So the equation is correct as is.

Let me compute the left side first.

51 kg * 4186 J/(kg·K) * 2.5 K.

Let me calculate that:

First, 51 * 4186 = let me compute that step by step.

Well, 50 * 4186 = 209,300, and 1 *4186=4,186, so total is 209,300 +4,186=213,486 J/K.

Wait no, wait, 4186 J/(kg·K) multiplied by 51 kg gives 51 *4186 J/K. Then multiplied by 2.5 K.

Wait, 51 *4186 = let me compute that accurately.

4186 *50 is 209,300. 4186 *1 is 4,186. So 209,300 +4,186 = 213,486 J/K.

Then multiply by 2.5 K: 213,486 *2.5.

Hmm, 213,486 * 2 = 426,972. 213,486 *0.5 = 106,743. So total is 426,972 +106,743 = 533,715 J.

So Q_body is approximately 533,715 Joules.

Now, Q_rations = m_rations (g) *35,000 J/g → so 35,000 * m_rations.

Set equal to 533,715 J:

35,000 * m_rations = 533,715 → m_rations = 533,715 /35,000.

Let me compute that.

35,000 is 3.5e4.

533,715 divided by 35,000.

Let me compute 35,000 *15 = 525,000. So 35,000 *15=525,000.

533,715 -525,000=8,715.

So 8,715 /35,000 = 0.249.

So m_rations is approximately 15.249 grams.

Wait, that's about 15.25 grams. Looking at the options, option G is 15g, option H is 25g, option E is 20g, etc.

Wait, wait, but wait—am I sure about the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, 51 kg → correct.

c_water is 4186 J/kg·K → correct.

ΔT is 2.5 K → correct.

So 51 *4186 = let me compute again.

4186 *50 is 209,300. 4186 *1 is 4,186. So 209,300 +4,186 = 213,486 J/K.

Multiply by 2.5 K → 213,486 *2.5.

As before, that's 533,715 J.

So Q_body is 533,715 J.

Now, the heat from rations is 35,000 J per gram. So m_rations = 533,715 /35,000.

Let me compute this division accurately.

35,000 *15 = 525,000 → 533,715 -525,000=8,715.

So 8,715 /35,000 = 0.249 → approximately 0.249 grams.

Wait no, no! Wait, 35,000 is per gram. So 35,000 * m_rations = 533,715 → m_rations=533,715 /35,000.

So 533,715 ÷ 35,000 → let me compute that as a decimal.

35,000 goes into 533,715 how many times?

35,000 *15 = 525,000 → 533,715-525,000=8,715.

35,000 goes into 8,715 0.249 times.

So 15.249 grams.

So approximately 15.25 grams.

Looking at the options, option G is 15g. So the closest is 15g.

But wait, the options are in whole numbers, so 15g is option G.

Wait, but wait, let me just confirm once more.

Wait, 51 kg *4186 J/kg·K *2.5 K = 51 *4186 *2.5 → let me compute 51*2.5 first.

51 *2.5 = 127.5.

Then 127.5 *4186 = ?

Hmm, let me compute 127 *4186 and 0.5*4186, then sum.

127 *4186: Let's compute 100*4186=418,600.

27 *4186: 20*4186=83,720; 7*4186=29,302 → 83,720+29,302=113,022.

So 418,600 +113,022 = 531,622.

Then 0.5*4186 =2,093.

So 531,622 +2,093 =533,715 J. Yep.

So Q_body is 533,715 J.

Q_rations: m *35,000 J/g → m =533,715/35,000 → 15.249 g.

So 15.25g. The options have 15g as option G, 20g as E, 25g as H.

So the closest is 15g.

Wait, but perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, maybe the question is using specific heat of body as that of water, but maybe in the problem, the hiker's mass is 51 kg. So, the formula is correct as Q = mcΔT.

Wait, but the calories from food are in kJ per gram, which is 35,000 J/g.

So yes, the approach seems correct.

So the answer is approximately 15.25 grams, so the correct option is G:15g.

To determine how much rations the hiker must consume to avoid a reduction in body temperature of $2.5 \mathrm{~K}$, we equate the heat released by the rations to the heat loss from her body. The heat loss from the body is calculated using the formula:

\[
Q_{\text{body}} = m_{\text{body}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T
\]

where:
- $m_{\text{body}} = 51 \mathrm{~kg}$ (the hiker's mass),
- $c_{\text{water}} = 4186 \mathrm{~J/(kg \cdot K)}$ (specific heat capacity of water),
- $\Delta T = 2.5 \mathrm{~K}$ (temperature change).

Substituting the values:

\[
Q_{\text{body}} = 51 \cdot 4186 \cdot 2.5 = 533,715 \mathrm{~J}
\]

The heat released by the rations is given by:

\[
Q_{\text{rations}} = m_{\text{rations}} \cdot 35,000 \mathrm{~J/g}
\]

To prevent a temperature drop, $Q_{\text{body}} = Q_{\text{rations}}$. Solving for $m_{\text{rations}}$:

\[
m_{\text{rations}} = \frac{Q_{\text{body}}}{35,000} = \frac{533,715}{35,000} \approx 15.25 \mathrm{~g}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is **15 g**, which corresponds to option **G**.
