Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this reflex arc question. I remember reflex arcs are the pathways that impulses take in response to a stimulus. Let me think about the steps involved.

So, a reflex arc starts with a receptor, right? The receptor is like the part that detects the stimulus. Then, the signal goes to a sensory neuron. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait! The sensory neuron is the afferent neuron. Because afferent means going towards the central nervous system. So the receptor sends the signal to the afferent neuron.

After the afferent neuron, the signal goes to the spinal cord or brain, where interneurons are. Interneurons process the information, maybe decide if it's a reflex or something that needs higher processing. Then, the interneurons connect to the efferent neurons. Efferent means going away from the CNS, towards the effector.

The effector is the muscle or gland that responds. So putting it all together, the order is receptor → afferent neuron → interneuron → efferent neuron → effector.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this sequence.

Option J says: receptor, afferent, interneuron, efferent, effector. That seems right. Let me check the other options quickly.

Option A starts with interneuron, which can't be right because the first step is the receptor. Option C starts with sensory, which might be a trick since sensory is afferent, but the first should be receptor. Option D has receptor, afferent, then interneuron, efferent, but ends with receptor again? No, that doesn't make sense. Option E starts with receptor but then goes to efferent, which skips steps. G starts with receptor, afferent, efferent, which skips interneuron. H has efferent early on, which is wrong.

So yeah, option J is the correct path.

The correct path of an impulse over a reflex arc begins with the receptor detecting the stimulus. The signal then travels along the afferent neuron (sensory neuron) toward the central nervous system. Here, interneurons process the information before transmitting it to the efferent neuron, which carries the impulse to the effector (a muscle or gland) to elicit a response. 

Analyzing the options, only option J accurately represents this sequence: receptor → afferent neuron → interneuron → efferent neuron → effector. Other options either misplace components or omit critical steps.

Answer: J
