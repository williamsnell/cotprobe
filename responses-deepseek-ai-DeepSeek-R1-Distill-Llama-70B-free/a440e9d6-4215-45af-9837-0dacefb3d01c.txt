Question:

A woman is the fee simple owner of a 1,000-acre tract of land. Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it would be land fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber and has clearings where someone could build a home and live. The woman conveyed the tract to her brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother then proceeded to clear some timber on the tract and used it in repairing fences, buildings, equipment, and the like on the property. In an action by the woman to permanently enjoin the brother from cutting any more timber on the swampland section of the tract and to account for profits received in the sale of the timber, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: succeed, because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no such prior use had been made.
B: not succeed, because a life tenant has a right to make reasonable use of the land.
C: succeed, because the life tenant has not obtained explicit permission to cut timber.
D: succeed, because a life tenant may not clear timber from swampland.
E: not succeed, because the life tenant is allowed to make necessary repairs on the property.
F: not succeed, because a life tenant is not liable for permissive waste.
G: not succeed, because a life tenant is allowed to exploit natural resources for personal use.
H: not succeed, because a life tenant has the right to clear land for cultivation.
I: succeed, because a life tenant may not make changes that alter the value of the land.
J: succeed, because a life tenant must account for permissive waste to the reversioner or remainderman.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me start by breaking down the facts. 

The woman owns 1000 acres. Half is swampland, which can't be farmed but has valuable hardwood. The other half is also timbered but is suitable for farming once cleared. She conveys the tract to her brother for life. So he's a life tenant.

Now, the brother does a few things. He clears 40 acres of the tillable half and uses that timber for repairs on the property. He also cuts 60 acres from the swampland, which hasn't been used for timber before. The woman is suing to stop him from cutting more on the swampland and to make him account for the profits from selling that timber.

I remember that life tenants have certain rights and responsibilities. They can use the property but must avoid committing waste. There are different types of waste—permissive and voluntary. Permissive waste is when the tenant doesn't take care of the property, like letting it fall into disrepair. Voluntary waste is actively doing something harmful, like cutting down timber without permission when it's not necessary.

Wait, but life tenants are allowed to make reasonable use of the property. I think the rule is that they can use the land in a way that's consistent with its intended use, but they can't commit waste. For example, a life tenant can cut timber if it's for repairs or if it's part of the normal use of the land, but they can't over-exploit it, especially if it's a natural resource that would deplete the value for future interests.

In this case, the brother used some of the timber from the tillable land for repairs, which sounds permissible. But for the swampland, he cut 60 acres where no prior use for timber had been made. So this might be considered exploiting a resource that wasn't previously used. 

I'm trying to recall the rules about natural resources. There's something about open mines, where if a mine was already being worked, the life tenant can continue, but if it's a new exploit, they can't. Similarly, if the swampland's timber was never used before, maybe the brother can't start now because that's exploiting a new resource, which counts as waste.

So the question is whether cutting timber from previously unused swampland is permissible. I think the rule is that a life tenant can't open a new mine or start exploiting a new resource if it's beyond the ordinary use. So if the swampland wasn't used for timber before, he might be committing waste by starting now.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the woman will succeed because a life tenant can't exploit new resources where there's been no prior use. That aligns with what I'm thinking.

Option B says she won't succeed because the brother made reasonable use. But I think starting a new exploit isn't reasonable.

Option D says she'll succeed because you can't clear from swampland. But I don't think it's about the type of land; it's about prior use.

Option J talks about accounting for permissive waste. But in this case, it's more about the brother actively exploiting a new resource, which is voluntary waste, not permissive.

So the best answer seems to be A: succeed because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no prior use was made.

The question revolves around the rights and responsibilities of a life tenant regarding the use of the property and the potential commission of waste. The woman conveyed the property to her brother for life, making him a life tenant. The brother used the property in two ways: he cleared 40 acres of timber on the tillable half for repairs and cut 60 acres of timber on the swampland, which had never been previously used for timber production. The woman is seeking to enjoin further cutting on the swampland and to have the brother account for the profits from the timber sale.

Under property law, a life tenant is allowed to make reasonable use of the property but must avoid committing waste. Voluntary waste occurs when the tenant actively exploits a resource in a way that depletes the property's value for future interests. A key principle is that a life tenant cannot exploit natural resources, such as timber, if there was no prior use of that resource. This is particularly relevant to the swampland, as it had never been used for timber production before the brother's actions.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. A life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no prior use had been made. This aligns with the principle that opening a new resource for exploitation constitutes voluntary waste.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While a life tenant can make reasonable use of the land, exploiting a previously unused resource like the swampland's timber is not considered reasonable.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The issue is not about clearing timber from swampland specifically but about the lack of prior use of the swampland for timber production.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The brother's actions constitute voluntary waste, not permissive waste, as he actively exploited a new resource.

Thus, the woman will most likely succeed because the brother’s actions on the swampland constitute voluntary waste by exploiting a previously unused resource.
