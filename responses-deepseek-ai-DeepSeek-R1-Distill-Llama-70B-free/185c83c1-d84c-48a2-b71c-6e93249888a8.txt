Question:

A woman was the owner of a farm in fee simple. Thewoman left the farm in 1986 to move to the city. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. The man's nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it during his uncle's absence. When the man returned from his mother's home in 1999, he continued in possession until 2010 when the womanbrought an ejectment action. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. The court would most likely hold that

Options:

A: the woman was the rightful owner and thus entitled to possess the farm.
B: the man's nephew was entitled to possession, as he was the one who took care of the farm during the man's absence.
C: the man was entitled to possession, because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.
D: the man was not entitled to possession, as he left the property for a year.
E: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man had not paid any property taxes.
F: the man was entitled to possession, because he had lived on the farm for over 20 years.
G: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's absence for a year interrupted the continuity of his possession.
H: the man was entitled to possession, because the woman had abandoned the farm.
I: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.
J: the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about adverse possession, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A woman owns a farm in fee simple, which means she has absolute ownership. She left the farm in 1986 to move to the city. Then, a man took possession in 1987 as an adverse possessor. He stayed on the land from 1987 to 1997, which is 10 years. Then he left for a year to care for his sick mother, returning in 1999. His nephew took care of the farm during that year. When he came back in 1999, he stayed until 2010, when the woman sued to eject him. The statutory period for adverse possession in the state is 20 years.

The question is about whether the man can claim adverse possession and thus be entitled to possession, or if the woman still has the rights.

I remember that for adverse possession, the possession must be open, notorious, continuous, and hostile (against the true owner's rights) for the statutory period. So here, the statutory period is 20 years.

Let's timeline this:

- 1987 to 1997: the man is there for 10 years.
- 1997-1998: he's away for a year, but his nephew is taking care of the place.
- 1999-2010: he's back, so that's 11 years.

So total time? From 1987 to 2010 is 23 years. But he wasn't there the entire time. He took a one-year break.

Wait, but when he left for a year, his nephew stayed. Does that count as continuous possession? I think that's a key point. In adverse possession, the possession needs to be continuous and uninterrupted. If the nephew was there during his uncle's absence, it might count because the nephew was acting on behalf of the uncle, maintaining possession.

So from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years. Then, 1997-1998, the nephew is there. Then 1999-2010 is 11 years. So total of 22 years. But wait, the statutory period is 20 years. So he has more than enough time if the period is considered continuous.

But wait, the man left for a year. Did that break the continuity? Or does the nephew's presence during that year count as part of the man's possession?

I think if the nephew was acting as the man's agent or with his permission, then the possession remains continuous. Because the nephew's presence shows that the man didn't abandon the property; someone was there on his behalf. So the adverse possession doesn't get interrupted.

So the total time from 1987 to 2010 is 23 years, but the nephew's year would make the possession continuous. Therefore, the man has met the 20-year requirement.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the man is entitled because of privity with his nephew, aiding him in fulfilling the period. But I think it's not about privity (which is more about transferring interest) but rather that the nephew's possession is treated as the man's.

Option J says the man's possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required. So if the nephew's time counts, then the possession was continuous. So J could be correct.

Option G says the woman is entitled because the man's absence for a year interrupted continuity. But if the nephew's presence counts, then the continuity wasn't broken. So G would be incorrect.

Option D says the man isn't entitled because he left for a year. But again, the nephew's presence might negate that.

Option F says the man is entitled because he lived there over 20 years, but actually, he didn't live there the entire time; he left for a year.

So the key is whether the nephew's time counts as part of the man's possession. If yes, then the man's total adverse possession time is enough.

So the correct answer would be J, because all the elements (open, notorious, continuous, hostile) are met, with the nephew's time ensuring continuity.

The question revolves around whether the man can establish adverse possession of the farm. For adverse possession, the possession must be open, notorious, continuous, and hostile for the statutory period, which in this case is 20 years. 

The man took possession in 1987 and stayed until 1997 (10 years). He then left for a year (1997-1998) but arranged for his nephew to care for the farm during his absence. He returned in 1999 and stayed until 2010, adding another 11 years to his possession. The critical issue is whether the nephew's presence during the man's one-year absence maintained the continuity of possession.

If the nephew acted on the man's behalf or with his permission, the possession would not be considered interrupted. The nephew's presence would likely be treated as continuous possession by the man, satisfying the statutory requirement. Thus, the man's total possession from 1987 to 2010 (23 years) exceeds the 20-year requirement, and the continuity of possession is maintained.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The man has likely acquired title through adverse possession, so the woman is not the rightful owner.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The nephew's role was to care for the farm during the man's absence, not to acquire possession for himself.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The issue is not about privity but whether the nephew's presence maintained continuity.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The man's absence for a year did not interrupt continuity if the nephew's presence is deemed continuous.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The payment of property taxes is not relevant to adverse possession in this context.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The man did not live on the farm continuously for 20 years; his nephew's presence during his absence is what maintains continuity.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The man's absence for a year did not interrupt continuity because the nephew maintained possession.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The woman's absence does not constitute abandonment if she retained ownership and later brought an action to recover the property.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The man's possession, aided by his nephew, was sufficient to meet the statutory period.
- **Option J**: Correct. The man's possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile, fulfilling the requirements for adverse possession.

The correct answer is:

**J**
