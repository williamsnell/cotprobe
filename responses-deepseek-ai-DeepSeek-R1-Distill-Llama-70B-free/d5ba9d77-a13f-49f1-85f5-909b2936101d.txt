Okay, so I have this tax question to solve, and I'm going to try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, Decker is a 62-year-old single individual who sold his principal residence. He got $500,000 after all selling expenses. He bought the house 15 years ago and lived there until selling it. The cost basis of the house on the sale date was $200,000. Then, within six months, he bought a new house for $600,000. The question is asking how much gain he should recognize from the sale.

Hmm, I remember that when you sell your primary residence, there's an exclusion from taxable gain. I think the rules are something like up to $250,000 for a single person and $500,000 for married couples filing jointly. But wait, I need to make sure I remember the exact figures and the conditions.

So the exclusion applies if the house was your main home for at least two of the five years leading up to the sale. Decker lived there for 15 years, so that part is definitely satisfied.

The gain would be the selling price minus the cost basis. His selling price after expenses is $500,000, and the cost basis is $200,000. So the gain is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.

But since he's single, the exclusion is $250,000. So the taxable gain would be $300,000 minus $250,000, which is $50,000. Wait, but wait a second. I also remember something about using the proceeds to buy another home, maybe for a rollover or something like that. Oh right, the like-kind exchange? Or maybe it's about the home sale exclusion and whether purchasing another home affects it.

Wait, no. The home sale exclusion allows you to exclude gain up to $250k/$500k without needing to buy another home. But if you do buy another home, there's a rule about the exclusion being prorated based on the time between sales. Or wait, maybe that's when the exclusion applies to the gain not covered by the $250k.

Alternatively, I think the purchase of a new home doesn't affect the exclusion unless you're using some kind of deferral, like a 1031 exchange, but that's for investment properties, right? Because in a 1031 exchange, you have to reinvest the proceeds into a like-kind property to defer the gain. But for personal residences, the exclusion is separate.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the two. The home sale exclusion under section 121 allows you to exclude up to $250k (single) or $500k (married) of gain without any need to purchase another home. So regardless of whether you buy a new home, as long as you meet the eligibility criteria, you can exclude that amount.

So in this case, Decker's gain is $300k. He's single, so he can exclude $250k. So the taxable gain is $50k.

Wait, but I also recall that if you buy a new principal residence within a certain timeframe, part of the exclusion might be based on the new home's cost. Or is that only when the exclusion is more than the allowed amount, and you have to use some of the new basis for the exclusion?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me think again. The sale of a principal residence allows for an exclusion of up to $250k (single) without needing to reinvest. So even if you don't buy another home, you can exclude that amount. If you do buy another home, but the gain is less than or equal to $250k, then you don't have any taxable gain, and the new home's basis is the cost minus the excluded gain.

Wait, but if the gain is more than $250k, then the excess would be taxable. But in this case, the gain is $300k, so $50k would be taxable.

Wait, but I think I might have missed something about the timing. Because Decker bought the new house within six months of selling. Does that affect anything? I think the purchase of a new home doesn't affect the exclusion under section 121. The exclusion is based on how long the home was your primary residence, not on whether you buy another.

Wait, unless he's using the "rollover" provision. Oh, wait, the "rollover" of gain by purchasing a new primary residence. I think this applies when the gain exceeds the exclusion. So if you buy a new home, you can reduce the taxable gain by the amount of the cost of the new home, but only up to the amount of the gain. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, there's a rule where if you sell your primary residence and buy another within a certain time, you can exclude gain up to the limit, but if you don't use all of it, the remainder is added to the basis of the new home. Let me try to recall.

Section 121(b)(3) says that the exclusion applies if, during the 5-year period ending on the date of sale, the property was owned and used as the principal residence for at least 2 years. So Decker qualifies.

The amount of gain excluded is the lesser of (i) $250k ($500k for joint filers) or (ii) the total gain. So if the gain is $300k, he can exclude $250k, leaving $50k taxable.

But wait, does the purchase of a new home affect this? I think not directly. The exclusion is based on the sale, not the purchase. The purchase of a new home might affect the basis of the new home, but not the taxable gain on the sale.

Wait, another angle: If the sale and purchase are both of primary residences, and the purchase occurs within a certain time frame (like 2 years before or after the sale), then under some rules, the basis of the new home is adjusted. But I don't think that affects the gain on the sale.

So in this scenario, Decker's gain is $300k. He can exclude $250k, so he must recognize $50k of gain.

Looking back at the options, option A is $50k. Option G is $100k, but that's probably if the exclusion were $200k, which it's not. So the correct answer should be $50k, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. I think in some cases, when you buy a new home, the exclusion is calculated differently. Let me think. If the new home costs more than the old one, the entire exclusion applies. If it's less, then part of the gain might be deferred.

Wait, no, I think that's for a different rule, maybe the old "rollover" rule that applied before 1997. Now, with the current law, the exclusion is per the $250k/$500k limits, regardless of purchasing a new home.

So the correct answer would be $50k, which is option A.

To determine the amount of gain Decker should recognize from the sale of his principal residence, we analyze the situation under the tax rules for the sale of a primary home. 

Decker sold his principal residence for $500,000 after expenses, with a cost basis of $200,000, resulting in a total gain of $300,000 ($500,000 - $200,000). Under Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code, a single individual may exclude up to $250,000 of gain from taxable income if the property was used as their principal residence for at least two of the five years leading up to the sale. Decker meets this condition, as he lived in the house for 15 years.

The exclusion applies regardless of whether Decker purchases a new home. The fact that he bought a new house for $600,000 within six months does not affect the exclusion. Therefore, Decker can exclude $250,000 of the $300,000 gain, leaving $50,000 of taxable gain.

Thus, the amount of gain Decker should recognize is $50,000.
