Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sampling methods, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a town with one high school that buses students from urban, suburban, and rural communities. The study is on attitudes toward tracking students in honors, regular, or below-grade classes. The options are different types of samples, and I need to pick the recommended one.

Hmm, I remember that different sampling methods are used in different scenarios. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Stratified sample. I think stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics, then randomly selecting from each stratum. For example, if a population has urban, suburban, and rural groups, each would be a stratum. This ensures that each subgroup is adequately represented. That makes sense because the school draws from these different areas, and their attitudes might vary based on where they're from.

Option B is Snowball sample. I recall that's a non-probability method where existing participants recruit others, often used when the population is hard to reach, like in some social studies. Doesn't seem relevant here because tracking attitudes in different communities doesn't necessarily require that approach.

Option C is Simple Random Sample (SRS). That's where each individual has an equal chance of being selected, usually using a random number system. It's straightforward, but it might not ensure that all subgroups (urban, suburban, rural) are represented proportionally. If the school has a varied population, SRS might miss certain groups if the sample size is small.

Option D is Voluntary response sample. That's when participants volunteer, like through a survey they choose to take. This can introduce bias because only those with strong opinions might respond. Probably not the best choice for this study.

Option E is Convenience sample. That's selecting participants based on ease of access, like asking people in a mall. It's quick but not reliable for generalizing to the population. Not suitable for this scenario since the sample needs to represent different communities.

Option F is Cluster sample. This involves dividing the population into clusters (like schools) and randomly selecting some clusters. All individuals in the selected clusters are studied. But since the high school is the only one, and they're already part of the same cluster, this might not be necessary. Plus, the question is about different communities within the school, so cluster might not target the stratification needed.

Option G is Systematic sample. This is where you select every nth individual from a list. It's systematic but doesn't necessarily account for subgroups. If the list isn't ordered in a way that reflects the urban, suburban, rural distribution, it might not help in this case.

Option H is Purposive sample. That's selecting participants based on specific criteria relevant to the study. It's more qualitative and might not provide a representative sample for attitude analysis across different groups.

Option I is Multistage sample. I think this involves selecting in stages, like first selecting regions, then schools within regions, etc. But again, since the school is the only one, and the focus is on different communities within it, this might not be the best fit.

Option J is Quota sample. This is similar to stratified, where you set quotas for subgroups but the selection within those is non-random. It's less precise than stratified and doesn't use random sampling, so it might introduce bias.

Putting it all together, the study wants to look at attitudes across urban, suburban, and rural students. Stratified sampling (A) would ensure that each group is proportionally represented, allowing for accurate comparisons. The other methods either don't ensure subgroup representation or introduce other issues. So I think the answer is A.

The study aims to examine attitudes toward tracking students in honors, regular, and below-grade classes across urban, suburban, and rural communities. To ensure that each subgroup is adequately represented and to allow for accurate comparisons, a stratified sample is the most appropriate method. This approach divides the population into distinct strata based on geographic origin (urban, suburban, rural) and randomly selects participants from each stratum, ensuring proportional representation.

Other sampling methods are less suitable for this scenario:
- **Snowball, Voluntary response, and Convenience samples** introduce bias or lack representativeness.
- **Simple Random Sample (SRS)** does not guarantee proportional representation of subgroups.
- **Cluster, Systematic, and Multistage samples** are not necessary given the single high school setting and the focus on subgroup analysis.
- **Purposive and Quota samples** are less precise or introduce non-random selection.

Thus, the recommended method is **Stratified sample**.

Answer: A
