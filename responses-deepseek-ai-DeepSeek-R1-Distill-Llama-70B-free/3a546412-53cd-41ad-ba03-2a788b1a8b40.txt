Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in China who reported being in a physical fight at school one or more times in the past 12 months as of 2015. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

I'm not exactly sure about the exact statistic, but I remember that China has been working on school safety and reducing violence. I think violence in schools isn't as high as in some other countries, but I'm not certain. Let me think about similar statistics I've heard before.

I recall that in some countries, like the United States, the percentages can vary, but for China, I think it's lower than say, 20%. Wait, no, maybe around 10-30%? But I'm not sure which exact figure it is.

Wait, I think I've heard something about a study or a report from around that time. Maybe it's the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) that collects such data. They ask about physical fights, among other things.

Let me try to remember. The GSHS for China in 2015... I think the percentage was in the teens. So maybe 19%? That would be option E. But wait, I might be mixing it up with another country's data.

Alternatively, sometimes the numbers can be higher. If I'm not mistaken, some studies show that around 29% of students in that age group in China reported being in a physical fight. So that would be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think China's rate is actually lower than some other regions. So perhaps it's around 9%? That would be option B. But I'm not very confident about that.

I should also consider the context. The question is about 13-15-year-olds, which is early adolescence. At that age, physical fights might be more common than in later teens, but I'm not sure how it compares across different countries.

Another angle: I remember that in some Asian countries, the rates are lower due to stricter school environments and cultural factors. So maybe China's percentage is on the lower side, like 9% or 19%.

Wait, but I think the correct figure is around 29%. I've heard that before in some reports. So option C would be 29%. Alternatively, maybe it's 39%, which is option F. No, I'm not sure.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. If the options are A:89, B:9, C:29, D:69, E:19, F:39, G:59, H:49, I:79, J:99.

I think the figure is lower than 30%, so maybe 19% or 29%. Or perhaps it's 9%, but that seems low. I'm trying to recall any specific data points. I think 29% sounds familiar. So I'm leaning towards option C:29%.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes these statistics can vary based on the survey's sample size and methodology. If the sample is larger and more representative, the numbers might be a bit higher. So maybe it's 29% or 39%. Hmm.

I'm not entirely certain, but I'll go with what I think I remember. I'll choose option C:29%.

The correct answer is C:29%.
