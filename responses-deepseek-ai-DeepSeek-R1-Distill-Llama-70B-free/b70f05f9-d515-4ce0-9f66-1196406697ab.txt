Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about perfectly competitive markets. Hmm, I remember from class that in perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they can't influence the market price. The equilibrium is where the supply equals demand. 

So the question gives me 100 identical firms, each with a specific short-run total cost function: C(q) = (1/300)q³ + 0.2q² +4q +10. And the market demand is Q = -200P + 8000. I need to find the short-run equilibrium price.

Wait, right, in the short run, firms will produce where marginal cost equals the market price. Since it's a perfectly competitive market, the price is determined by the intersection of market demand and supply.

But how do I find supply? Oh right, each firm's supply curve is their marginal cost curve. So I need to find the marginal cost function for each firm and then, since there are 100 firms, multiply by 100 to get the market supply.

Let me compute the marginal cost. The total cost is C(q) = (1/300)q³ + 0.2q² +4q +10. The marginal cost is the derivative of C with respect to q. 

So, dC/dq = (3*(1/300))q² + 2*(0.2)q + 4. Let me compute that:

3*(1/300) is 1/100, so 0.01 q². 
2*0.2 is 0.4, so 0.4 q. 
Plus the 4.

So MC(q) = 0.01 q² + 0.4 q +4.

Now, each firm's supply curve is where P = MC. But wait, in equilibrium, the price is the same across all firms. So each firm will produce where their MC equals P.

So the total quantity supplied by all firms is 100 times the quantity each firm produces at that price. Let me denote each firm's quantity as q, so total Q = 100q.

Now, the market demand is Q = -200P + 8000. So, setting Q equal to total supply:

100q = -200P + 8000.

But wait, each firm's q is determined by their MC. So for each firm, P = 0.01 q² + 0.4 q +4.

Since all firms are identical, they all produce the same q. So I can write:

P = 0.01 q² + 0.4 q +4.

And Q = 100 q. But from demand, Q is also -200 P +8000. So substituting Q:

100 q = -200 P +8000.

But wait, since each firm's q is (Q)/100, perhaps I can substitute P from the MC equation into the demand equation.

Alternatively, substitute q from the MC equation into the market equilibrium.

Hmm, let me try substituting. Let's express q in terms of P from the MC equation.

Wait, from the firm's perspective, P = 0.01 q² +0.4 q +4.

I can rearrange this for q in terms of P, but that's a quadratic equation. Maybe it's easier to express q as a function of P and then plug into the market Q.

So, for each firm, q = (some function of P). But since the equation is quadratic, solving for q might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can express q from the MC equation and substitute into the market equilibrium condition.

Let me try that. From P = 0.01 q² +0.4 q +4, I can write 0.01 q² +0.4 q +4 - P = 0. That's a quadratic equation in terms of q. Solving for q would give two possible solutions, but we can take the positive one since q can't be negative.

But maybe another approach is better. Let's think about the market supply. The market supply is the sum of each firm's supply. Each firm's supply is the MC curve, so the market supply is the sum of 100 MC(q_i), but since all firms are identical, each produces the same q, so market supply is 100 * MC(q), where q is each firm's quantity.

Wait no, that's not quite right. Each firm's supply curve is their MC, so the market supply curve is the sum of each firm's MC. But when firms are identical, each will produce the same q at a given P. So the market supply is 100 * q, where q is found by setting P = MC(q).

So, the market supply curve is Q = 100 * q, where q is from P = 0.01 q² +0.4 q +4.

So, substituting q from the MC equation into the supply.

Wait, maybe it's better to set up the equation where market demand equals market supply, substituting q from MC.

So, market demand is Q = -200 P +8000.

Market supply is Q = 100 q.

And q is found from P = 0.01 q² +0.4 q +4.

So substituting q, the supply equation becomes Q =100 q, but q is (from P=MC) a function of P. Let's write q in terms of P.

Wait, from P = 0.01 q² +0.4 q +4.

We can rearrange this to 0.01 q² +0.4 q + (4 - P) = 0.

This is a quadratic in q: a=0.01, b=0.4, c=(4-P).

Using quadratic formula: q = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Compute discriminant: b² -4ac = (0.4)^2 -4*(0.01)*(4 - P).

So 0.16 -0.04*(4-P) = 0.16 -0.16 +0.04 P = 0.04 P.

So q = [ -0.4 ± sqrt(0.04 P) ]/(2*0.01).

Since q must be positive, we take the positive root.

sqrt(0.04 P) is 0.2 sqrt(P).

So q = [ -0.4 + 0.2 sqrt(P) ] / 0.02.

Wait, denominator is 0.02, so dividing by 0.02 is multiplying by 50.

So:

q = [ (-0.4 + 0.2 sqrt(P)) ] *50.

Simplify:

-0.4 *50 = -20.

0.2 *50 =10.

So q= (-20 +10 sqrt(P)).

Wait, but q must be positive. So, -20 +10 sqrt(P) >0 => 10 sqrt(P) >20 => sqrt(P) >2 => P>4.

Which makes sense, since if P is too low, firms won't produce.

So, each firm's q is (10 sqrt(P) -20).

So total market supply Q is 100 * q = 100*(10 sqrt(P) -20) = 1000 sqrt(P) -2000.

So the market supply equation is Q = 1000 sqrt(P) -2000.

Now, set market supply equal to market demand.

Market demand is Q = -200 P +8000.

So:

1000 sqrt(P) -2000 = -200 P +8000.

Bring all terms to one side:

1000 sqrt(P) -2000 +200 P -8000 =0.

Simplify:

200 P +1000 sqrt(P) -10000 =0.

Wait, let me check:

Wait, 1000 sqrt(P) -2000 = -200 P +8000.

So 1000 sqrt(P) = -200 P +8000 +2000.

Which is 1000 sqrt(P) = -200 P +10000.

Divide both sides by 100 to simplify:

10 sqrt(P) = -2 P +100.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write as:

10 sqrt(P) +2 P = 100.

Alternatively, let me rearrange:

10 sqrt(P) = -2 P +100.

Divide both sides by 2:

5 sqrt(P) = -P +50.

Hmm, maybe square both sides to eliminate the square root. But I have to be careful because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.

So:

5 sqrt(P) = -P +50.

Square both sides:

25 P = ( -P +50 )².

Expand the right side:

( -P +50 )² = P² -100 P +2500.

So:

25 P = P² -100 P +2500.

Bring all terms to one side:

P² -100 P +2500 -25 P =0.

Combine like terms:

P² -125 P +2500 =0.

Now, solve for P using quadratic formula. a=1, b=-125, c=2500.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (125)^2 -4*1*2500.

125^2 is 15625. 4*2500=10000.

So D=15625-10000=5625.

sqrt(5625)=75.

So solutions:

P = [125 ±75 ] / 2.

So two possible solutions:

(125 +75)/2=200/2=100.

(125-75)/2=50/2=25.

So P=100 or P=25.

But let's think about this. Earlier, we had the condition that P must be greater than 4, which both satisfy. But we need to check which one is valid in the original equation because sometimes squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.

Let me plug back into 5 sqrt(P) = -P +50.

First, P=25.

Left side:5*sqrt(25)=5*5=25.

Right side: -25 +50=25. So 25=25. Valid.

P=100.

Left:5*sqrt(100)=5*10=50.

Right: -100 +50= -50.

50 is not equal to -50. So P=100 is invalid.

So the solution is P=25.

Wait, wait a second. That would imply that the equilibrium price is 25. Looking back at the options, option A is 25. But I'm a bit confused because when I compute the MC, if P=25, then each firm's q is 10*sqrt(25) -20=10*5-20=50-20=30. So each firm produces 30 units. So total Q=100*30=3000.

Wait, let me check the demand at P=25. Q = -200*25 +8000 = -5000 +8000=3000. So yes, that matches. So the equilibrium is at P=25, Q=3000.

Wait, but I thought the options had 25 as option A. So the answer should be A:25.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Let me go back step by step.

1. Compute MC: correct, 0.01 q² +0.4 q +4.

2. Market supply is Q=100q, where q is per firm.

3. For each firm, q is determined by P=MC, so q= [ -0.4 + sqrt(0.04P) ]/(2*0.01) ?

Wait, wait, earlier when I solved P =0.01 q² +0.4 q +4, I rearranged to 0.01 q² +0.4 q + (4-P)=0.

Then using quadratic formula, q = [-0.4 ± sqrt(0.16 -4*0.01*(4-P))]/(2*0.01).

Wait, earlier I computed discriminant as 0.04 P, but let me recheck:

Discriminant: b² -4ac = (0.4)^2 -4*(0.01)*(4-P).

Which is 0.16 -0.04*(4-P).

0.16 -0.16 +0.04P=0.04P. Correct.

So sqrt(0.04P)=0.2 sqrt(P). So,

q = [ -0.4 + 0.2 sqrt(P) ]/(0.02).

Because we're taking the positive root, as quantity can't be negative.

Then, 0.02 is 2 hundredths, so dividing by 0.02 is multiplying by 50.

So,

q= [ -0.4 + 0.2 sqrt(P) ] *50.

Which becomes:

-0.4 *50 = -20.

0.2 *50=10.

So q=10 sqrt(P) -20.

Yes, correct.

So market supply Q=100*(10 sqrt(P)-20)=1000 sqrt(P) -2000.

Market demand Q=-200 P +8000.

Set equal:

1000 sqrt(P) -2000 = -200 P +8000.

Bring all terms to left:

1000 sqrt(P) +200 P -10000=0.

Wait, earlier I think I might have miscalculated when moving terms. Let me redo:

1000 sqrt(P) -2000 = -200 P +8000.

Adding 200 P to both sides: 200 P +1000 sqrt(P) -2000 =8000.

Then, subtract 8000: 200 P +1000 sqrt(P) -10000=0.

Yes, same as before.

Divide by 100: 2 P +10 sqrt(P) -100=0.

Wait, earlier I had 10 sqrt(P) +2 P =100. Yes.

Then, 5 sqrt(P) = -P +50.

Wait, no, when I divided by 5, it's 2P +10 sqrt(P) -100=0. So 2P +10 sqrt(P) =100.

Divide both sides by 2: P +5 sqrt(P) =50.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me see.

Wait, no, when I divided by 100 earlier, I had 10 sqrt(P) +2 P =100.

Wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me correct this.

Wait, the equation is 200 P +1000 sqrt(P) -10000=0.

Divide both sides by 100: 2 P +10 sqrt(P) -100=0.

So 2 P +10 sqrt(P) =100.

Divide both sides by 2: P +5 sqrt(P) =50.

Hmm, perhaps that's easier to handle.

Let me set x= sqrt(P), so x² = P.

So equation becomes x² +5x -50=0.

Wait, wait, substituting:

P = x².

So equation: x² +5 x =50.

x² +5x -50=0.

Solving for x:

x = [ -5 ± sqrt(25 +200) ] /2.

Because discriminant D=25 + 200=225.

sqrt(225)=15.

So x= [ -5 +15 ] /2 =10/2=5, or x= [ -5 -15 ]/2=-10, which is negative, so discard.

So x=5, so sqrt(P)=5, so P=25.

That's correct. So P=25.

So the equilibrium price is 25, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. The answer in the options is A:25. But I'm a bit confused because when I think about the MC and demand, sometimes the MC might have a higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the market supply.

Let me try another approach. Instead of expressing q in terms of P and substituting, perhaps I can find the industry supply curve correctly.

Each firm's supply is where P=MC. So for each firm, q is determined by P=0.01 q² +0.4 q +4.

So, for each firm, q as a function of P is q = [ -0.4 + sqrt(0.16 -4*0.01*(4-P)) ]/(2*0.01).

Wait, I think I missed a negative sign. Let me re-calculate:

The quadratic equation is 0.01 q² +0.4 q + (4-P) =0.

So a=0.01, b=0.4, c=4-P.

Discriminant D= (0.4)^2 -4*(0.01)*(4-P) =0.16 -0.04*(4-P)=0.16 -0.16 +0.04P=0.04P.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(0.04P)=0.2 sqrt(P).

Thus, q = [ -0.4 ±0.2 sqrt(P) ]/(2*0.01)= [ -0.4 ±0.2 sqrt(P) ]/0.02.

Since q must be positive, we take the positive root:

q = [ -0.4 +0.2 sqrt(P) ] /0.02.

Which is as before: q= ( -20 +10 sqrt(P) ).

So each firm produces q=10 sqrt(P) -20.

Thus, total Q=100*(10 sqrt(P)-20)=1000 sqrt(P)-2000.

Set equal to demand:

1000 sqrt(P) -2000 = -200 P +8000.

Bring all terms to left:

1000 sqrt(P) +200 P -10000=0.

Divide by 100:

10 sqrt(P) +2 P -100=0.

So 2P +10 sqrt(P) =100.

Divide by 2: P +5 sqrt(P) =50.

Let x= sqrt(P), so x² +5x -50=0.

Solutions: x=( -5 ±sqrt(25 +200) )/2 = (-5±15)/2.

Positive solution: (10)/2=5. So x=5, P=25.

Thus, the equilibrium price is 25.

So the correct answer should be A:25.
</think>

To determine the short-run equilibrium price in a perfectly competitive market, we start by analyzing the given total cost function and market demand. The total cost function for each firm is:

\[
C(q) = \frac{1}{300}q^3 + 0.2q^2 + 4q + 10
\]

The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the total cost function:

\[
MC(q) = \frac{dC}{dq} = 0.01q^2 + 0.4q + 4
\]

In perfect competition, firms produce where \( P = MC \). Thus, for each firm, the supply curve is \( P = 0.01q^2 + 0.4q + 4 \). Rearranging this equation to express \( q \) in terms of \( P \), we solve the
