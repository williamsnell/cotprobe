Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about hydrogen peroxide solution. Hmm, I remember that molarity is moles per liter. Let me think about what I need to do.

The problem says that 5.0 grams of hydrogen peroxide is mixed per 100 ml of solution. Oh wait, right, and the molecular weight is 34 g/mol. So I need to calculate the molarity.

First, I think I should find out how many moles of H2O2 are in 5.0 grams. Moles are calculated by mass divided by molar mass. So that's 5.0 g divided by 34 g/mol. Let me do that math... 5 divided by 34 is approximately 0.147 moles, right?

Wait, but wait, the solution is 100 ml. Oh right, molarity is per liter, so I need to convert that. 100 ml is 0.1 liters. So the molarity would be moles divided by liters. So 0.147 moles divided by 0.1 liters is... that's 1.47 M, approximately.

Looking at the options, I don't see 1.47. Let me check the options again. The options are A through J. Let's see: option H is 1.0, E is 1.5. Hmm, so 1.47 is closer to 1.5, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake.

Wait, did I do the calculation right? Let me double-check. 5 grams divided by 34 g/mol is 5/34. Let me calculate that more accurately. 34 times 0.147 is around 5, yes. But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

5.0 divided by 34: 34 into 5. So 34 * 0.147 is 5. So yes, 0.1470588... approximately 0.1471 moles.

Now, the volume is 100 ml, which is 0.1 L. So moles per liter would be 0.1471 / 0.1, which equals 1.471 M. So approximately 1.47 M.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.5 M, which is close. But wait, maybe I made an error in the initial calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used more precise values.

Wait, 34 g/mol for H2O2 is correct. So 5g /34g/mol = 0.147 moles. Then 0.147 moles in 0.1 L gives 1.47 M.

But the options don't have 1.47. The closest is E)1.5 and H)1.0. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, no, the solution is 100 ml. Oh wait, is that the total volume after mixing? I think so. So 5g in 100ml solution.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have considered the density of the solution to find the actual volume, but the problem doesn't mention density, so I think that's unnecessary. The question simply gives the volume as 100ml, so I can use that directly.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for molarity in terms of moles per liter, and perhaps I should have converted 100 ml to 0.1 L correctly. So 0.147 moles in 0.1 L is 1.47 M.

But none of the options exactly match. Wait, the options are A:0.2, B:3, C:2.5, D:0.75, E:1.5, F:0.5, G:2.0, H:1.0, I:1.2, J:4.0.

So 1.47 is closest to 1.5, which is option E. But wait, perhaps the problem expects an exact calculation.

Alternatively, let me compute 5/34 more precisely. Let's do it with more decimals.

34 times 0.147 is 5. So 5.0 /34 = 0.1470588 moles.

Divide by 0.1 L: 1.470588 M.

Rounding to two decimal places, that's 1.47 M. So the closest option is E:1.5 M. But wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given data: 5.0 g (two sig figs), 34 g/mol (two sig figs), 100 ml is probably two sig figs, so the result should be two sig figs.

So 1.47 rounds to 1.5, which has two sig figs. So the correct answer would be E:1.5 M.

But wait, another thought: did I consider the correct volume? Because when you mix a solid into a solution, sometimes the volume changes, but in such problems, it's usually assumed that the volume is as given. So I think my approach is correct.

To calculate the molarity of the hydrogen peroxide solution, we start by determining the number of moles of H₂O₂ in 5.0 g. The molecular weight of H₂O₂ is 34 g/mol, so:

\[
\text{Moles of } H_2O_2 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{5.0 \, \text{g}}{34 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.147 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Next, the solution volume is given as 100 mL, which is equivalent to 0.1 L. Molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution, so:

\[
\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Moles of } H_2O_2}{\text{Volume of Solution in Liters}} = \frac{0.147 \, \text{moles}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} \approx 1.47 \, \text{M}.
\]

The closest option to this calculated value is **1.5 M**. Considering significant figures, the given data (5.0 g, 34 g/mol, and 100 mL) suggests two significant figures, so rounding 1.47 to two significant figures gives 1.5 M.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: 1.5 M**
