Okay, so I've got this problem here about Thomas Long buying some bonds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, Thomas bought two $1,000 bonds. Each bond is worth $1,000. The interest is 6%, and it's payable on January 1 and July 1. He bought them on October 17 at 98. There's a brokerage fee of $5 per bond. The question is asking for his total cost and the net proceeds to the seller. And then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I need to understand is what it means when a bond is bought at 98. I think that refers to the price as a percentage of its face value. So 98 would mean 98% of $1,000, right? So each bond costs $980. But wait, bonds are usually quoted without the decimal, so 98 is like 98 dollars per 100, so yeah, 98% of $1000.

But wait, when you buy a bond, you pay the price plus any accrued interest. Because bonds pay interest periodically, so if you buy it mid-period, you have to pay the seller for the interest that's accrued since the last payment.

The bonds here pay interest on January 1 and July 1. So each payment is semi-annual. So the interest is paid every six months. So each payment would be 6% of $1000 divided by 2, which is $30 per payment. Wait, no, 6% annually, so each semi-annual payment is 3% of $1000, which is $30.

Wait, no, 6% per year, so each semi-annual payment is 3%, so yes, $30 each time. So each bond pays $30 every six months.

Now, the purchase date is October 17. Let me think about when the last interest payment was made. The interest is paid on January 1 and July 1. So the last payment before October 17 would have been on July 1. The next payment will be on January 1 of next year.

Wait, so from July 1 to October 17 is how many days? Let's see. July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31 is 30 days (since July 1 is the payment date, the next day is July 2). Then August has 31, September 30, October 17. Let me count the days:

July: 31 -1 =30 days (from July 2 to July 31)
August: 31
September:30
October:17

Total days from July 1 to Oct 17: 30 +31+30+17= 108 days.

Since the interest is semi-annual, the total period between payments is 180 days (6 months). So the accrued interest is (108/180)*$30. Let me calculate that.

108 divided by 180 is 0.6. So 0.6 *30 is $18. So each bond has accrued $18 in interest since the last payment on July 1.

So when Thomas buys each bond on October 17, the price he pays is the quoted price (98% of $1000) plus the accrued interest.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, when you buy a bond, you pay the market price plus the accrued interest. Because the seller is entitled to the interest up until the sale date.

So the quoted price is 98% of the face value, which is $980 per bond. Then, the accrued interest is $18 per bond. So the total cost per bond is 980 +18 = $998. But wait, there's also a brokerage fee of $5 per bond.

So the cost per bond is 998 +5 = $1003. But wait, no. Wait, is the brokerage fee added to the cost? I think so. Because brokerage is what you pay to buy the bond.

Wait, so each bond costs 98 (which is $980) plus accrued interest $18, plus brokerage $5. So per bond: 980 +18 +5 = $1003. But wait, that's per bond. Since he buys two bonds, it's 2 * 1003 = $2006.

So his total cost is $2006. So looking at the options, let's see which ones have 2006 as the first number.

Looking at the options:

Option A: $2006 and $1996
Option C: $2015 and $1995
Option D: $2006 and $1986
Option E: $2020 and 2000
Option F: $2010 and 1980
Option H: $2000 and 1970.

So options A, D, and others. So the total cost is $2006.

Now, the second part is the net proceeds to the seller. So the seller receives the market price plus the accrued interest, but minus any brokerage fees or other costs? Or wait, no. Because the brokerage fee is paid by the buyer, right? So when the seller sells the bond, they receive the market price plus accrued interest, but the brokerage fee is a separate cost borne by the buyer.

Wait, I need to clarify this part. The net proceeds to the seller would be the selling price (which is 98% of face value) plus the accrued interest. Because the seller doesn't pay the brokerage fee; the buyer does. So the seller gets the selling price plus the interest that's accrued up to the point of sale.

So per bond, the seller gets 980 (98% of 1000) plus 18 (accrued interest) = $998.

But wait, is the brokerage fee taken from the seller's proceeds? Or is it an additional fee paid by the buyer? I think the brokerage fee is a separate cost to the buyer. So for the seller, it's just the selling price plus accrued interest, and the brokerage fee is paid by the buyer. So the seller's net proceeds per bond would be 980 +18 = 998.

Wait, but would the seller have to pay any fees? Hmm, perhaps the brokerage fee is split or something else, but the question says it's a brokerage fee of $5 per bond, but it's not clear who pays. But in most cases, the buyer pays the brokerage fee when purchasing, so the seller doesn't have that cost.

So for each bond, the seller receives $980 + $18 = $998. So two bonds would be 2 * 998 = $1996.

Wait, let me double-check. So the seller's proceeds are the selling price plus accrued interest. The buyer's cost is that plus brokerage.

So for each bond:

Buyer's cost = 980 (price) +18 (accrued) +5 (brokerage) = 1003.

Seller's proceeds per bond = 980 +18 = 998.

So two bonds would be 1996.

So the two numbers are $2006 (buyer's total cost) and $1996 (seller's net proceeds). So looking at the options, option A is 2006 and 1996. So option A.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.

Another way to think: the total cost for Thomas is (price + accrued interest + brokerage) per bond times two.

Price per bond: 98 â†’ $980.

Accrued interest per bond: $18.

Brokerage per bond: $5.

So per bond cost: 980 + 18 +5 = $1003.

Total for two bonds: 2 * 1003 = $2006.

Seller's proceeds: per bond, 980 +18 = $998. So two bonds: 1996.

So the correct answer is option A: $2006 and $1996.

To determine Thomas Long's total cost and the net proceeds to the seller, we analyze the given information:

1. **Bond Details**:  
   - Face value of each bond: $1,000.  
   - Interest rate: 6% annually, paid semi-annually (January 1 and July 1).  
   - Purchase price: 98% of face value ($980 per bond).  
   - Purchase date: October 17.  
   - Brokerage fee: $5 per bond.  

2. **Accrued Interest Calculation**:  
   The last interest payment was on July 1, and the next payment is on January 1. The period from July 1 to October 17 is 108 days. Since interest is semi-annual (180 days), the accrued interest is:  
   \[
   \text{Accrued Interest per bond} = \frac{108}{180} \times \$30 = \$18.
   \]

3. **Total Cost to Buyer (Thomas Long)**:  
   The total cost per bond includes the purchase price, accrued interest, and brokerage fee:  
   \[
   \text{Cost per bond} = \$980 + \$18 + \$5 = \$1,003.
   \]  
   For two bonds:  
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \times \$1,003 = \$2,006.
   \]

4. **Net Proceeds to Seller**:  
   The seller receives the purchase price plus accrued interest, but the brokerage fee is paid by the buyer and does not affect the seller's proceeds:  
   \[
   \text{Proceeds per bond} = \$980 + \$18 = \$998.
   \]  
   For two bonds:  
   \[
   \text{Total proceeds} = 2 \times \$998 = \$1,996.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   The total cost to the buyer is \$2,006, and the net proceeds to the seller are \$1,996. This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
