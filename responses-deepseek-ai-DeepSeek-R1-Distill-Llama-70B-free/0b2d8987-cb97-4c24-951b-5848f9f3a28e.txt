Okay, I'm trying to solve this integral problem. Let's see what the question says. We have this double integral I(R) over the region x² + y² ≤ R². The integrand is a bit complicated: (1 + 2x²)/(1 + x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴) minus (1 + y²)/(2 + x⁴ + y⁴). And we need to find the limit as R approaches infinity.

Hmm, so first, I should probably think about whether this integral converges as R goes to infinity. That is, does I(R) approach a finite value as R becomes very large? If it does, that's our answer. If not, maybe it diverges, but looking at the options, they all seem like finite numbers, except maybe some negative ones, but I guess the answer is a finite number.

Looking at the integrand, it's a difference of two fractions. Maybe I can simplify each part or find a way to combine them. Let's look at each term separately.

First term: (1 + 2x²)/(1 + x⁴ + 6x²y² + y⁴). Let's see the denominator: x⁴ + y^4 +6x²y². Wait, x⁴ + y^4 plus 6x²y². Hmm, maybe that can be rewritten. Let me think: x^4 + y^4 + 6x²y² = (x² + y²)^2 + 4x²y². Because (x² + y²)^2 = x^4 + 2x²y² + y^4. So adding 4x²y² makes it x^4 +6x²y² + y^4. So denominator is (x² + y²)^2 + (2xy)^2. Wait, 2xy squared is 4x²y². So yeah, denominator is (x² + y²)^2 + (2xy)^2.

Hmm, that looks a bit like a^2 + b^2, which might suggest using polar coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So x² + y² = r².

Let me try substituting. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then the denominator becomes (r²)^2 + (2 r² cosθ sinθ)^2. Wait, 2xy is 2 r² cosθ sinθ, so (2xy)^2 is 4 r^4 cos²θ sin²θ.

So denominator is r^4 + 4 r^4 cos²θ sin²θ. Which can be factored as r^4 [1 + 4 cos²θ sin²θ].

Similarly, the numerator is 1 + 2x². In polar coordinates, x² is r² cos²θ. So numerator is 1 + 2 r² cos²θ.

So putting it together, the first term becomes [1 + 2 r² cos²θ] / [r^4 (1 + 4 cos²θ sin²θ)].

Wait, but this is in the integrand. So the entire integrand is this first term minus the second term. Let's look at the second term.

Second term: (1 + y²)/(2 + x⁴ + y⁴). Again, let's express in polar coordinates. Denominator is 2 + x⁴ + y^4. Let's see, x^4 + y^4 can be written as (x²)^2 + (y²)^2. Hmm, but in polar coordinates, x^4 = r^4 cos^4θ, y^4 = r^4 sin^4θ. So denominator is 2 + r^4 (cos^4θ + sin^4θ).

The numerator is 1 + y², which is 1 + r² sin²θ.

So the second term becomes [1 + r² sin²θ] / [2 + r^4 (cos^4θ + sin^4θ)].

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way than directly computing the integral.

Wait, perhaps considering symmetry or looking for an odd function in some variables. Alternatively, maybe the integrand simplifies when expressed in polar coordinates.

Another thought: as R approaches infinity, the region of integration becomes the entire plane. So we're essentially integrating over all of R². So the question is whether the integral of this function over the entire plane converges.

Let me check the behavior of the integrand as r approaches infinity. For large r, we can approximate the integrand.

First term: [1 + 2x²]/[denominator]. For large r, 1 is negligible compared to 2x², which is 2r² cos²θ. Similarly, denominator is dominated by r^4 terms. So numerator ~ 2 r² cos²θ.

Denominator: r^4 [1 + 4 cos²θ sin²θ] ≈ r^4, since 4 cos²θ sin²θ is of order 1 compared to r^4.

So the first term ~ [2 r² cos²θ] / r^4 = 2 cos²θ / r².

Similarly, the second term: [1 + y²]/[2 + x⁴ + y⁴]. Again, for large r, 1 is negligible compared to y² = r² sin²θ. Denominator: 2 + x^4 + y^4 ≈ r^4 (cos^4θ + sin^4θ). So numerator ~ r² sin²θ.

Thus, the second term ~ [r² sin²θ] / [r^4 (cos^4θ + sin^4θ)] = sin²θ / [r² (cos^4θ + sin^4θ)].

So the integrand (first term minus second term) for large r is approximately [2 cos²θ / r²] - [sin²θ / (r² (cos^4θ + sin^4θ))].

So putting it all together, the integrand behaves like [2 cos²θ - sin²θ/(cos^4θ + sin^4θ)] / r².

Now, considering the integral in polar coordinates: dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So for large R, the integral from 0 to R becomes approximately the integral from 0 to infinity of (integrand) * r dr dθ.

Wait, but the integrand is O(1/r²), so when multiplied by r, it becomes O(1/r). So each radial integral would be ∫ (something) * (1/r) dr from 0 to ∞, which is divergent unless the something integrates to zero over θ. Wait, that can't be right, because the integral would then diverge. But the options are finite. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral converges because of cancellation between the two terms.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the integrand is an odd function in some way, leading to cancellation over the entire plane. For instance, if the integrand is odd in x or y, integrating over symmetric limits would give zero.

Looking at the original integrand: let's see if it's an odd function in x or y.

First term: (1 + 2x²)/(denominator). Let's substitute x → -x. The numerator becomes 1 + 2x², which is the same. Denominator is 1 + x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴ → same as before. So the first term is even in x.

Second term: (1 + y²)/(2 + x⁴ + y⁴). Substituting x→-x, same as before. So the second term is even in x as well.

So the entire integrand is even in x and y. So no odd function behavior here; that approach might not work.

Alternative idea: Maybe the integrand can be expressed as a divergence of some vector field, leading to evaluating the integral over a contour at infinity. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the integral can be split into two separate integrals, each of which can be evaluated, and then subtracted.

Let me write I(R) as the integral over the disk of [f(x,y) - g(x,y)] dx dy, where f is the first term and g is the second.

So I(R) = ∬_{x²+y² ≤ R²} [f - g] dx dy.

Maybe each integral ∬ f and ∬ g can be evaluated or estimated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that the integrand simplifies in some way that the two terms cancel each other except for a finite part.

Wait, perhaps I can write the integrand as [f - g] = [something that's a total derivative], making the integral easier.

Another thought: Let's see if the two terms can be combined into a single fraction.

Compute f - g = [ (1+2x²)(2 + x⁴ + y⁴) - (1 + y²)(1 +x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴) ] / [denominator1 * denominator2].

Wait, that might be complicated, but let's try.

Compute numerator:

(1 + 2x²)(2 + x⁴ + y⁴) - (1 + y²)(1 +x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴)

Let me expand each term:

First term: (1)(2 + x⁴ + y⁴) + 2x²(2 + x⁴ + y⁴)
= 2 + x⁴ + y⁴ + 4x² + 2x^6 + 2x² y⁴

Second term: (1)(1 +x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴) + y²(1 +x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴)
= 1 + x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴ + y² + x^4 y² +6x² y^4 + y^6

So subtracting the second term from the first:

[2 + x⁴ + y⁴ +4x² +2x^6 +2x² y^4] - [1 +x⁴ +6x²y² +y⁴ +y² +x^4 y^2 +6x² y^4 +y^6]

Simplify term by term:

2 -1 =1

x⁴ - x⁴ = 0

y⁴ - y⁴ =0

4x² remains.

2x^6 remains.

2x² y^4 - [6x² y^4 + x^4 y^2 +6x² y^4] → let's see:

Wait, in the first part, it's +2x² y^4. In the second part, it's subtracting (6x² y^4 + x^4 y^2 +6x² y^4) → total subtracted is 12x² y^4 + x^4 y^2.

So 2x² y^4 -12x² y^4 = -10x² y^4.

And then the other terms: - y² -6x² y² - y^6.

So putting it all together:

1 +4x² +2x^6 -10x² y^4 - y² -6x² y² - y^6 -x^4 y^2.

Hmm, that seems messy. I'm not sure if this approach is helpful. Maybe there's another way.

Let me think about polar coordinates again. Maybe the angular integrals can be evaluated, and the radial part can be handled.

Expressed in polar coordinates, let's write the integrand as:

[ (1 + 2x²) / (1 + x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴) ) ] - [ (1 + y²) / (2 + x⁴ + y⁴) ) ]

Substituting x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ.

Denominator1 = 1 + x⁴ +6x²y² + y⁴ = 1 + r^4 (cos^4θ + 6 cos²θ sin²θ + sin^4θ) = 1 + r^4 [ (cos²θ + sin²θ)^2 + 4 cos²θ sin²θ ] → Wait, cos^4θ + sin^4θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ)^2 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ = 1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ. So denominator1 = 1 + r^4 [ (1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ) + 6 cos²θ sin²θ ] = 1 + r^4 [1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ ].

Similarly, denominator2 = 2 + x⁴ + y⁴ = 2 + r^4 (cos^4θ + sin^4θ) = 2 + r^4 [1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ].

So the first term in polar becomes:

[1 + 2 r² cos²θ ] / [1 + r^4 (1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ) ].

The second term is:

[1 + r² sin²θ ] / [2 + r^4 (1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ) ].

Hmm, perhaps for large r, we can approximate these fractions.

For the first term's denominator, when r is large, 1 is negligible, so denominator1 ≈ r^4 (1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ).

So first term ≈ [2 r² cos²θ ] / [ r^4 (1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ) ) ] = [2 cos²θ ] / [r² (1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ) ].

Similarly, denominator2 for the second term is ≈ r^4 (1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ), so the second term is [ r² sin²θ ] / [ r^4 (1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ) ] = [ sin²θ ] / [ r² (1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ) ].

So the integrand becomes approximately [2 cos²θ / (1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ ) - sin²θ / (1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ) ] / r².

Wait, but when you multiply by the Jacobian r, the integrand becomes approximately [ ... ] / r² * r = [ ... ] / r.

So each radial integral would be ∫ [something] / r dr from 0 to R. But this integral would diverge unless the something is zero.

Wait, but if the angular integral of [2 cos²θ / (1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ ) - sin²θ / (1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ) ] equals zero, then the integral would be zero.

Hmm, perhaps the angular integral cancels out. Let me check.

Let me denote the angular part as:

A(θ) = [2 cos²θ ] / [1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ ] - [ sin²θ ] / [1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ].

I need to compute ∫₀^{2π} A(θ) dθ and see if it's zero.

Wait, let's make a substitution. Let u = θ, but maybe it's easier to note if A(θ) is an odd function over some interval.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution like t = tanθ or something else.

Wait, another idea: Let's express everything in terms of cos(2θ), since sin²θ and cos²θ can be written in terms of cos(2θ).

Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, sin²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/2, and sinθ cosθ = (sin2θ)/2.

Let me rewrite A(θ):

First term: 2 cos²θ / [1 +4 cos²θ sin²θ ].

= 2*(1 + cos2θ)/2 / [1 +4*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 )*( (1 - cos2θ)/2 ) ]

Simplify numerator: (1 + cos2θ).

Denominator: 1 + 4 * [ (1 - cos²2θ)/4 ] = 1 + (1 - cos²2θ) = 2 - cos²2θ.

So first term becomes (1 + cos2θ) / (2 - cos²2θ).

Second term: sin²θ / [1 - 2 cos²θ sin²θ ]

= [ (1 - cos2θ)/2 ] / [1 - 2*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 )*( (1 - cos2θ)/2 ) ]

Denominator inside: 1 - 2*(1 - cos²2θ)/4 = 1 - (1 - cos²2θ)/2 = [2 - (1 - cos²2θ)] / 2 = [1 + cos²2θ]/2.

So the second term becomes [ (1 - cos2θ)/2 ] / [ (1 + cos²2θ)/2 ] = (1 - cos2θ) / (1 + cos²2θ).

So now A(θ) is:

[ (1 + cos2θ) / (2 - cos²2θ) ) ] - [ (1 - cos2θ) / (1 + cos²2θ) ) ].

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me compute this:

Let’s denote u = 2θ. Then the integral over θ from 0 to 2π becomes u from 0 to 4π, but since functions are periodic with period 2π, it's same as integrating from 0 to 2π.

But perhaps it's easier to just proceed with the substitution.

So A(u) = [ (1 + cosu) / (2 - cos²u) ) ] - [ (1 - cosu) / (1 + cos²u) ) ].

Let me compute this function and see if it's symmetric or if the integral cancels out.

Compute A(u):

= [ (1 + cosu)(1 + cos²u) - (1 - cosu)(2 - cos²u) ] / [ (2 - cos²u)(1 + cos²u) ) ].

Let me expand the numerator:

(1 + cosu)(1 + cos²u) = 1*(1 + cos²u) + cosu*(1 + cos²u) = 1 + cos²u + cosu + cos^3 u.

(1 - cosu)(2 - cos²u) = 1*(2 - cos²u) - cosu*(2 - cos²
