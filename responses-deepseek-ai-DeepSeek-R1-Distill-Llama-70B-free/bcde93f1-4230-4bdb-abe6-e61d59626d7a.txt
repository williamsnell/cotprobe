Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about conflicts between a congressional act and a valid treaty. Hmm, I need to figure out how such a conflict is resolved. Let's see, I remember from my studies that the Constitution has something about treaties and laws.

Okay, the question is: If a congressional act and a valid treaty conflict, how is it resolved? The options are from A to J.

Wait, I think the Supremacy Clause comes into play here. The Supremacy Clause is in Article VI of the Constitution. It says that the Constitution, laws made by Congress, and treaties are the supreme law of the land. But what happens when a law and a treaty clash?

I remember learning that when there's a conflict between a federal statute and a treaty, the one that was enacted later in time takes precedence. So the later law overrides the earlier one. It's like the "last in time" rule. So if Congress passes a law after a treaty is made, and they conflict, the law would prevail because it's later. Similarly, if a treaty is made after a law, the treaty would take precedence.

Looking at the options, option H says "The last in time prevails," which seems to match what I was thinking. But wait, let me make sure. There's also the idea that treaties are part of the "law of the land" under the Supremacy Clause, so they have equal footing with federal statutes. So when they conflict, the one that came later is the one that's enforced.

Another point: the Supreme Court would have the authority to decide this if it comes up in a case. So option C says the Supreme Court decides, which is true in the sense that the judiciary resolves the conflict, but the rule applied would be the "last in time" principle. So the answer would be H, because that's the rule applied, not just who decides it.

Wait, but the question is about how the conflict is resolved, which could be interpreted as which entity resolves it. But I think the question is more about the rule that governs which one takes precedence. So the answer would be H.

So, looking at the options again:

H: The last in time prevails.

Yes, that's the principle. So the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is based on the "last in time" rule, which dictates that when a congressional act and a valid treaty conflict, the one enacted later takes precedence. This principle is derived from the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution, which places both treaties and federal laws as part of the supreme law of the land. Therefore, the conflict is resolved by determining which was most recently enacted.

H: The last in time prevails.

Answer: H
