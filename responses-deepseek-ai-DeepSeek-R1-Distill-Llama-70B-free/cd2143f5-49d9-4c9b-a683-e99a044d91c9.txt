Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer from a plate to air, and I need to calculate the heat transferred in different regions and the error from an assumption. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on convection and boundary layers, but let's try to think this through.

The plate is 2 feet long, and it's initially at 500°F. The ambient air is 100°F, which means there's a temperature difference of 400°F. The air flow rate is 150 ft/s, and the width is 1 ft. So the area involved for each part (laminar and turbulent) would depend on where the transition happens.

I remember that the boundary layer starts laminar and then becomes turbulent after a certain point, called the critical length. The critical Reynolds number is around 5e5, I think. So first, I need to find out where along the plate the flow transitions from laminar to turbulent.

The Reynolds number (Re) is calculated as (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity. But wait, I need the kinematic viscosity of air. I think at around 100°F, which is about 38°C, the kinematic viscosity (ν) for air is approximately 0.0000167 ft²/s. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should double-check that value. Alternatively, maybe it's around 0.017 ft²/s or something similar. Oh, right, kinematic viscosity for air at 100°F (about 38°C) is about 0.0172 ft²/s. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So the critical Reynolds number is 5e5. So the critical length (x_c) is where Re = 5e5. So x_c = Re * ν / velocity.

Plugging in the numbers: x_c = (5e5) * (0.0172 ft²/s) / 150 ft/s.

Calculating that: 5e5 is 500,000. Multiply by 0.0172 gives 8,600. Then divide by 150: 8,600 / 150 ≈ 57.33 feet. Wait, that can't be right because the plate is only 2 feet long. So if the critical length is 57 feet, which is way longer than the plate, then the entire boundary layer on the plate is laminar, right? Because the flow hasn't reached the critical Reynolds number yet. But that can't be, because at 150 ft/s, over 2 ft, Re would be (150 * 2) / 0.0172 ≈ 17,441.77. Which is way below 500,000, so the flow is entirely laminar. Wait, but that would mean the boundary layer is all laminar, so part (b) about turbulent region wouldn't apply. Hmm, but the question is asking for the heat transferred from each region, implying that part of the plate is laminar and part is turbulent.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the critical length. Oh wait, perhaps I got the kinematic viscosity wrong. Maybe for air at 100°F, ν is actually around 0.0000172 ft²/s, which would be 1.72e-5 ft²/s. Let me compute that again.

Re_c = 5e5, so x_c = (5e5) * (1.72e-5) / (150). Let's compute:

5e5 * 1.72e-5 = (5 * 1.72) * 1e5 * 1e-5 → 8.6 * 1e0 → 8.6. Then 8.6 / 150 ≈ 0.0573 feet, which is about 0.686 inches. So the transition from laminar to turbulent happens at around 0.0573 feet along the plate. Therefore, the laminar region is 0.0573 ft, and the remaining (2 - 0.0573) = 1.9427 ft is turbulent.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the plate is 2 ft long, so the first 0.0573 ft is laminar, and the rest is turbulent.

Now, for each region, I need to calculate the heat transfer.

The formula for heat transfer in convection is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

So for each region, I'll compute h using the appropriate correlation.

For the laminar region (x ≤ x_c), the average Nusselt number (Nu) is given by Nu = 0.664 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3). But wait, I think for laminar flow over a flat plate, the local Nu is 0.332 Re^(1/2) Pr^(1/3), but the average over the length would be higher. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the formulas. Let me double-check.

Wait, the average Nusselt number for laminar flow over a plate of length L is given by:

Nu_avg = (2/3) * Nu_local at x = L.

And for local Nu, it's 0.332 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3).

Alternatively, the average Nu can be calculated as 0.664 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3), which is twice the local value at the end of the laminar region.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the average Nusselt number for the entire laminar region. So, for a laminar boundary layer, the average Nu is 0.664 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3). But wait, Re here is Re_x, which is the Reynolds number at the end of the laminar region, which is Re_c (5e5).

Wait, no, in this case, the laminar region is only up to x_c. So Re for the laminar region is Re_c = 5e5.

So for the laminar region, the average Nu is 0.664 * (Re_c)^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3).

I need the Prandtl number (Pr) for air. At around 100°F, I think Pr is about 0.7. Let me confirm: yes, for air at these temperatures, Pr is approximately 0.7.

So, let's compute h for the laminar region first.

Compute Nu_avg = 0.664 * (5e5)^(0.5) * (0.7)^(1/3).

First, sqrt(5e5) is sqrt(500,000) ≈ 707.1.

So, 0.664 * 707.1 ≈ 0.664 * 700 ≈ 464.8. But more accurately: 0.664 * 707.1 = let's compute 700 * 0.664 = 464.8, and 7.1 * 0.664 ≈ 4.72, so total around 469.52.

Then multiply by (0.7)^(1/3). The cube root of 0.7 is approximately 0.887.

So, 469.52 * 0.887 ≈ 469.52 * 0.9 = 422.68, but a bit less. Let's compute 469.52 * 0.8 = 375.62, 469.52 * 0.08 = 37.56, so 0.887 is 0.8 + 0.08 + 0.007 → 375.62 +37.56=413.18 + (469.52 *0.007)= ~3.28 → 413.18+3.28=416.46.

So Nu_avg ≈ 416.46.

Then, h = Nu_avg * k / x_c, where k is the thermal conductivity of air.

Wait, what's the thermal conductivity of air at 100°F? I think it's around 0.017 W/m·K, but wait, no, because we're working in imperial units. Let me think in terms of BTU units.

Wait, I might get confused with units here. Let me make sure I have the right units for each variable.

The units for h are BTU/(hr·ft²·°F). Thermal conductivity k is in BTU/(hr·ft·°F). So, for air at 100°F, k is approximately 0.014 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the value. Let me think: yes, for air at around 100°F, k ≈ 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on exact values. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation and then adjust.

So, h_laminar = (Nu_avg * k) / x_c.

We have Nu_avg ≈ 416.46.

k = 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

x_c = 0.0573 ft.

So h_laminar = (416.46 * 0.015) / 0.0573.

Compute numerator: 416.46 * 0.015 ≈ 6.247.

Then, 6.247 / 0.0573 ≈ 109.1 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, the area for the laminar region is the area of the plate from x=0 to x=x_c. Since it's a flat plate with width 1 ft and length x_c, the area A_laminar = 1 ft * x_c = 0.0573 ft².

Then, Q_laminar = h_laminar * A_laminar * ΔT.

ΔT is 500 - 100 = 400°F.

So Q_laminar = 109.1 * 0.0573 * 400.

Compute 109.1 * 0.0573 ≈ 109 * 0.05 = 5.45; 109 * 0.0073 ≈ 0.7957. So total ≈ 6.2457. Then multiply by 400: 6.2457 * 400 ≈ 2498.28 BTU/hr.

Looking at the options, option E has (a) 2,663.3, which is higher. Hmm, maybe my calculations were a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the Prandtl number or in the thermal conductivity.

Wait, let me check the Pr again. Air at around 100°F has Pr ≈ 0.7, that's correct.

Alternative approach: maybe using the formula for average heat transfer coefficient for the laminar region.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct formula for average Nu in laminar flow is 0.664 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3). So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I miscalculated the value. Let me redo the Nu_avg calculation.

Re_c = 5e5.

So sqrt(Re_c) = sqrt(5e5) = sqrt(500,000) = approx 707.10678.

Then, 0.664 * 707.10678 ≈ 0.664 * 700 = 464.8; 0.664 * 7.10678 ≈ ~4.72. So total around 469.52.

Pr^(1/3) for Pr=0.7: 0.7^(1/3) ≈ 0.887.

So 469.52 * 0.887 ≈ 416.46.

So that part seems right.

Now, k = 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

x_c = 0.0573 ft.

h = (416.46 * 0.015) / 0.0573.

Let me compute 416.46 * 0.015: 400*0.015=6, 16.46*0.015≈0.247, so total ≈6.247.

Divide by 0.0573: 6.247 / 0.0573 ≈ 109.1 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Area A = 1 * 0.0573 = 0.0573 ft².

Q_laminar = 109.1 * 0.0573 * 400.

Compute 109.1 * 0.0573 first:

109.1 * 0.05 = 5.455

109.1 * 0.0073 ≈ approx 109 * 0.0073 ≈ 0.7957

So total ≈5.455 + 0.7957 ≈6.2507.

Then multiply by 400: 6.2507 * 400 = 2500.28 BTU/hr.

So around 2500 BTU/hr for part (a). Looking at the options, option (a) in E is 2663.3, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for k. Let me double-check. Thermal conductivity of air at 100°F is about 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). Alternatively, maybe it's 0.016. Let me check: I think at higher temperatures, k increases. So maybe 0.016 would be more accurate. Let me try that.

k = 0.016.

Then, h = (416.46 * 0.016)/0.0573.

Compute numerator: 416.46 * 0.016 ≈ 6.663.

Divide by 0.0573: 6.663 / 0.0573 ≈ 116.3.

Then Q = 116.3 * 0.0573 * 400.

Compute 116.3 * 0.0573 ≈ approx 6.663.

6.663 * 400 = 2665.2 BTU/hr. That's very close to option E's (a) 2663.3. So that's probably correct. So part (a) is approximately 2663.3.

Now for the turbulent region, which is from x_c to x=2 ft. So the length is 2 - 0.0573 = 1.9427 ft.

For the turbulent region, the average Nusselt number is calculated differently. The formula for the average Nu for turbulent flow over a flat plate from x_c to L is given by:

Nu_avg = ( (Re_L^(0.8) - Re_c^(0.8)) / ( (0.8) * (ν/(u_inf)) )) ) * Pr^(1/3) * 0.036

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the formula for local Nu in turbulent flow and integrate, but maybe there's a simpler approach.

Wait, the average Nu for turbulent flow can be expressed as:

Nu_avg = 0.036 * Pr^(1/3) * (Re_L - Re_c)^(0.8) / ( (Re_L^(0.2) - Re_c^(0.2)) )

Wait, no, I think another approach is to use the formula for the average Nusselt number from x = x_c to x = L as:

Nu_avg = (0.036 / 0.8) * (Re_L^(0.8) - Re_c^(0.8)) * Pr^(1/3) / ( (Re_L^(0.2) - Re_c^(0.2)) )

Or perhaps using the formula for the average as:

Nu_avg = (0.036 * Re_L^0.8 * Pr^(1/3)) - (0.036 * Re_c^0.8 * Pr^(1/3)) ) * (1/(L - x_c)) * (x_c^(0.2) / (0.2)) )

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the average Nusselt number for the entire turbulent region using the formula:

Nu_avg = (0.036 * Re_L^0.8 * Pr^(1/3)) - (0.036 * Re_c^0.8 * Pr^(1/3)) ) * (1/(Re_L - Re_c)) ?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the average Nusselt number for turbulent flow as:

Nu_avg = 0.036 * (Re_L^(0.8) - Re_c^(0.8)) * Pr^(1/3) / (0.8 * (Re_L^(0.2) - Re_c^(0.2)) )

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the average Nusselt number for the entire plate, considering both laminar and turbulent regions, but I'm specifically looking for the turbulent region's contribution.

Wait, another approach: The local Nusselt number in the turbulent region is given by Nu = 0.036 * Re_x^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3).

But to find the average for the turbulent region, I need to integrate Nu from x_c to L and then divide by (L - x_c).

So, the average Nu for the turbulent region would be:

Nu_avg = (1/(L - x_c)) * ∫ (0.036 * (u_inf * x / ν)^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3)) ) dx from x_c to L.

Let me make substitution: let Re_x = u_inf * x / ν = (150 * x) / ν. Wait, but Re_c is 5e5, and Re_L is (150 * 2) / ν.

Wait, let's compute Re_L first.

Re_L = (150 ft/s * 2 ft) / ν.

ν = 1.72e-5 ft²/s.

So Re_L = (300) / (1.72e-5) ≈ 300 / 0.0000172 ≈ 17,441,860. So Re_L ≈ 1.744e7.

Which is way above Re_c.

So, the integral becomes:

∫ (0.036 * (Re_x)^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3)) dx from x=x_c to x=L.

But Re_x = (u_inf * x)/ν.

So, substituting Re_x = (u_inf / ν) * x → x = (Re_x * ν) / u_inf.

So, dx = (ν / u_inf) * dRe_x.

So, the integral becomes:

0.036 * Pr^(1/3) * (ν / u_inf) ∫ Re_x^(0.8) dRe_x from Re_x=Re_c to Re_x=Re_L.

The integral of Re_x^0.8 dRe_x is (Re_x^(1.8))/(1.8).

So, putting it all together:

Average Nu for turbulent region = [0.036 * Pr^(1/3) * (ν / u_inf) * (Re_L^(1.8) - Re_c^(1.8)) /
