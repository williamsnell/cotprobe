Question:

A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin
B: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
C: Pelvic ultrasonography
D: CT scan of the abdomen with contrast

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the next step in diagnosing this patient. Let me start by going through the details provided.

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a week-long history of low-grade fever and abdominal cramps, especially worse with bowel movements. She started on amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole two days ago but hasn't gotten better. She's had constipation for 12 years, which is probably why they gave her those antibiotics. She doesn't have nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. Her past medical history includes hypertension, and she had a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy five years ago because of uterine fibroids.

Her physical exam shows a BMI of 32, so she's obese. Her temp is 38.1°C, which is a low-grade fever. Blood pressure is a bit high, but that's probably her hypertension. Abdomen is soft, tender in the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Stool is brown, no occult blood. Labs show elevated leukocytes at 15k, which indicates some infection or inflammation. Her hemoglobin and platelets are normal.

So, considering her symptoms: abdominal cramps worse with bowel movements, low-grade fever, and elevated WBC. She started antibiotics but didn't improve. The initial thought might be infectious causes like C. diff, especially since she was on antibiotics recently. But she's been on them for only two days, which might be a bit short for C. diff, but possible. Or maybe it's something else.

The location of tenderness is the left lower quadrant. That makes me think of diverticulitis, especially sigmoid diverticulitis because it's on the left. Diverticulitis can present with abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Also, she's a bit older, and being female, diverticulitis is common in that demographic, especially if she's had a high-fiber diet or not, but her constipation might be a factor.

Another possibility is inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn's or UC, but she's had constipation for 12 years, which is more typical of IBS, perhaps. But the acute presentation with fever and elevated WBC is more suggestive of an infection or inflammation rather than IBS.

She didn't have any urinary symptoms, so maybe a urinary issue like kidney stones or UTI is less likely. Also, her urinalysis was normal.

She's had a hysterectomy, so gynecological causes are less likely, but maybe ovarian issues? But she had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, so her ovaries are gone, making ovarian torsion or other ovarian pathologies unlikely.

Considering the antibiotics she's on: amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole. Those are commonly used for diverticulitis. But she hasn't responded yet. Maybe she needs imaging to confirm.

So, the next step would be imaging. What's the best option? CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is the gold standard for diagnosing diverticulitis. It can show the inflammation, any abscess, or complications. Alternatively, ultrasound could be considered, but in an obese patient, abdominal ultrasound might be less effective due to limited visualization. Pelvic ultrasound might help if there were gynecological issues, but that's less likely here.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used for biliary and pancreatic duct issues, like stones or strictures, which doesn't fit her symptoms. So ERCP is probably not the next step.

Testing stool for C. diff toxin is important if she has diarrhea, but her primary issue is abdominal pain and she's constipated. Also, she hasn't been on antibiotics for a long time; C. diff typically occurs after longer courses, but it's possible. However, her lack of diarrhea makes this less likely.

So, the most appropriate next step is likely a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast to evaluate for diverticulitis or other structural issues.

The patient is a 52-year-old woman presenting with a 1-week history of low-grade fever and abdominal cramps worsened by bowel movements. She has not responded to a 2-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole. Her past medical history includes hypertension and a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She has a BMI of 32, placing her in the obese category, and her physical exam reveals tenderness in the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Her labs show leukocytosis (15,000/mm³) but no other abnormalities.

The differential diagnosis includes diverticulitis, given her age, symptoms, and left lower quadrant tenderness. While Clostridium difficile infection is a consideration due to recent antibiotic use, the absence of diarrhea makes this less likely. Inflammatory bowel disease is less probable given her long history of constipation. Gynecological causes are unlikely due to her surgical history, and urinary symptoms are absent.

Imaging is the next step, with CT scan of the abdomen with contrast being the gold standard for diagnosing diverticulitis. It provides detailed visualization of the abdomen, even in obese patients, and can identify complications such as abscesses. Other options, such as pelvic ultrasonography or stool testing for C. difficile toxin, are less appropriate given the clinical context.
