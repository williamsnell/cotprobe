Question:

A 51-year-old man comes to the office because of a 6-month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating; he also has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss during this period. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?

Options:

A: Parotid
B: Retropharyngeal
C: Subclavian
D: Submental
E: Supraclavicular
F: Popliteal
G: Inferior deep cervical
H: Preauricular
I: Axillary
J: Inguinal

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient with a lump on his tongue, and I need to figure out which lymph nodes to check first for metastasis. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The patient is a 51-year-old man with a 6-month history of a tongue lump. It's affecting his speech and eating, and he's had a significant weight loss—about 15 pounds. That makes me think this could be something serious, like cancer. His history includes smoking a pack a day and drinking beer on weekends for 30 years. Smoking especially is a big risk factor for oral cancers, so that lines up.

The physical exam shows a 1.5 cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation confirms squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell is the most common type of oral cancer, so that fits.

Now the question is about evaluating lymph nodes for metastasis. I remember that the lymphatic drainage of the tongue is important here. The tongue has a rich lymphatic supply, and the drainage patterns vary depending on where the tumor is located.

The apex, or tip, of the tongue is involved here. I think the drainage from the tip of the tongue goes to the submental lymph nodes first. Let me recall: the oral cavity's lymphatic drainage typically starts in the submental or submandibular nodes before moving to deeper cervical nodes.

Wait, but wait—squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue can metastasize to the cervical lymph nodes. So the initial nodes to check would be the ones closest to the tumor site. The apex is in the anterior part of the tongue, so the lymphatic drainage would be to the submental nodes, which are located under the chin.

Let me visualize the neck lymph nodes. The submental nodes are in the submental triangle, under the chin. From there, they can drain to the submandibular nodes, and then to the deep cervical nodes. So the first station for metastasis from the tip of the tongue would be the submental nodes.

Looking at the options, option D is Submental. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the regions. There's also the sublingual nodes, but I think the submental is the main one for the apex. Or maybe it's the submandibular? Wait, no, the submandibular nodes are a bit more lateral. The submental is more midline.

Another thought: sometimes, if the cancer is on the lateral tongue, it might drain to the submandibular or cervical nodes, but the apex is more central, so submental first.

So yes, I'm confident the answer is D: Submental.

The patient is a 51-year-old man with a 6-month history of a lump on the apex of his tongue, which has been confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma. Given the tumor's location at the tip of the tongue, the lymphatic drainage pattern is critical for determining the first lymph nodes to evaluate for metastasis. The apex of the tongue primarily drains to the submental lymph nodes, which are located under the chin. These nodes are the initial site for lymphatic spread from this region before progressing to deeper cervical nodes. Therefore, the most appropriate lymph nodes to evaluate first for evidence of metastasis in this patient are the submental nodes.

Answer: D
