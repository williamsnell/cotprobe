Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the more economical option for carpeting a room. The room is 14 feet 6 inches by 11 feet 3 inches, and the price is $11.95 per square yard. The available widths are 15 feet and 12 feet. Hmm, I need to decide which width is cheaper and calculate the total cost.

Alright, first, I think I should calculate the area of the room in square yards because the price is per square yard. Wait, but the room's dimensions are in feet and inches. I remember that 1 yard is 3 feet, but wait, maybe I should convert everything to yards first.

Let me convert the room's dimensions to yards. So, the room is 14'6" by 11'3". Let's convert each dimension.

For the first dimension, 14 feet 6 inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is 0.5 feet. So 14.5 feet. To convert to yards, divide by 3. 14.5 / 3 is approximately 4.8333 yards.

The second dimension is 11 feet 3 inches. 3 inches is a quarter of a foot, so 0.25 feet. So 11.25 feet. Divided by 3 gives 3.75 yards.

So the area is 4.8333 yd * 3.75 yd. Let me calculate that. 4.8333 * 3.75. 4 times 3.75 is 15, and 0.8333 times 3.75 is about 3.125. So total is approximately 18.125 square yards. Wait, but maybe I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the area in square feet first and then convert to square yards. Oh right, because 1 yard squared is 9 square feet (since 3x3). So perhaps that's easier.

So the room is 14.5 feet by 11.25 feet. Multiply those to get square feet. 14.5 * 11.25. Let me compute that.

14 * 11 is 154. 14 * 0.25 is 3.5. 0.5 * 11 is 5.5. 0.5 * 0.25 is 0.125. So adding all up: 154 +3.5=157.5 +5.5=163 +0.125=163.125 square feet.

Now, to convert to square yards, divide by 9. 163.125 / 9 = ?

Let me do that division. 9*18=162, so 18.125 square yards. So that matches my earlier calculation. So the area is 18.125 sq yd.

Wait, but wait, you can't buy a fraction of a yard in carpet, right? Because carpet is sold by the square yard, but you have to buy whole yards. Or wait, no, actually, when you buy carpet, you buy it by the linear yard, but the width is fixed. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the price is $11.95 per square yard. So that's the cost per square yard of carpet. But when you buy carpet, it's usually sold by the square yard, but you have to consider the width. Because the width of the carpet affects how much you need to buy. For example, if the carpet is 15 feet wide, each linear foot you buy gives you 15 sq ft of carpet. Whereas 12 feet wide would give 12 sq ft per linear foot.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by figuring out how much carpet I need to buy in terms of square yards, considering the width available.

Wait, the room's area is 18.125 square yards. But when buying, you have to buy in terms of the width, so you're buying rolls of 15 or 12 feet wide. So perhaps I should calculate the linear yards needed for each width.

Wait, let me clarify. The area of the room is 18.125 square yards. The carpet is sold by the square yard, but when you buy, you have to buy in rolls of certain widths. So, for each width, you calculate how much you need to cover the area.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the carpet is available in 15-foot and 12-foot widths. So for each width, I need to calculate how much length I need to buy, then compute the total area and cost.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of square yards needed for each option, considering the width.

Wait, but the area is 18.125 square yards. So regardless of the width, you need at least that area, but you might have to buy more because you can't buy partial yards in length. Or maybe you can, but perhaps the width affects how much you buy beyond the exact area.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me take a step back.

The area is 18.125 square yards. So the total cost would be 18.125 * $11.95. But wait, that can't be right because the options have varying costs, so perhaps the available widths affect the total area you have to buy, which depends on how the room's dimensions fit into the carpet's width.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about how the carpet is cut. For example, if the carpet is 15 feet wide, and the room is 14.5 feet in one dimension, then the width of the carpet is more than enough, so you can cut a piece that covers that dimension. But if the room is longer than the width, you might have to buy more.

Wait, the room's dimensions are 14'6" by 11'3". So the first thought is, when you lay the carpet, you can choose which way to run it. But the carpet's width is fixed, so the length you need depends on the other dimension.

Wait, perhaps the width of the carpet (15' or 12') needs to be at least as long as one of the room's dimensions. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the carpet's width as covering one dimension of the room, and then the length needed is the other dimension.

Wait, let me think. Let's say I have a carpet that's 15 feet wide. So the width of the carpet will cover the 11'3" dimension of the room. Because 11'3" is 11.25 feet, which is less than 15 feet. So the length needed would be 14.5 feet (since the other dimension is 14'6"), but wait, 14.5 feet is more than 15 feet? No, wait, 14.5 is less than 15. So I think I need to buy a piece that's 14.5 feet long (in the direction of the other dimension) and 15 feet wide. But wait, the room's area is 14.5 * 11.25, so the carpet would cover 15 feet (width) by 14.5 feet (length), but that's more than needed in the width. So the area would be 15 *14.5 = 217.5 square feet, which is 24.1667 square yards. Because 217.5 /9 = 24.1667.

Wait, but the room only needs 18.125 square yards. So why are we getting 24 square yards? That seems like a lot of waste. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to calculate it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the carpet is sold in linear yards, but with a fixed width. So each linear yard of carpet gives you a certain area. For example, if the carpet is 15 feet wide, each linear yard (3 feet) would give 15 *3 = 45 square feet, which is 5 square yards (since 45/9=5). Wait, no, 45 square feet is 5 square yards. So each linear yard of 15-foot wide carpet is 5 square yards.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach it is to calculate how many linear yards you need to buy based on the dimensions of the room and the width of the carpet.

So, for the 15-foot width option:

The room's area is 18.125 square yards. But how much carpet do you need to buy?

Wait, the room is 14.5 feet by 11.25 feet. So if the carpet is 15 feet wide, which is more than enough for the 11.25-foot dimension, then the length needed would be the 14.5-foot dimension. But wait, 14.5 feet is 4.8333 yards (since 14.5 /3 = 4.8333).

So the length needed is 4.8333 yards. Each yard of this width gives 15 feet (5 yards?) Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the area you can get with each width and then see how much you need to buy.

Wait, the 15-foot wide carpet: each linear yard is 3 feet long, so each linear yard gives 15ft *3ft = 45 sq ft, which is 5 square yards (since 45/9=5). So each linear yard of 15' wide carpet is 5 square yards.

Now, the room needs 18.125 square yards. So, how many linear yards of 15' wide carpet are needed? Divide 18.125 by 5, which gives 3.625 linear yards. But you can't buy a fraction of a yard, so you have to round up to 4 linear yards. So 4 *5=20 square yards. So the cost would be 20 * $11.95 = $239.

Wait, but the options don't have $239. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the required dimensions. For the 15-foot width, the length needed would be the other dimension, which is 14.5 feet. So 14.5 feet is 4.8333 yards. So the area would be 15ft *14.5ft = 217.5 sq ft, which is 24.1667 sq yd. Then cost is 24.1667 *11.95. Let me calculate that.

24.1667 * 11.95. Let's approximate. 24 *12 is 288, but it's a bit less. 24 *11.95 = 286.8, and 0.1667*11.95≈2. So total is about 288.8, approximately $288.80.

But the options have 15' width options like $250, $275.95, etc. So maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate how much carpet to buy for each width, considering how the room's dimensions fit.

Wait, another approach: the carpet is sold in rolls of certain widths. So when you buy, you have to decide which dimension of the room is covered by the width of the carpet, then buy enough length to cover the other dimension.

So, for example, if I choose the 15-foot width, the other dimension of the room is 14.5 feet. So I need a piece of carpet that's 15 ft wide and 14.5 ft long. That's 15*14.5 = 217.5 sq ft, which is 24.1667 sq yd. So the cost would be 24.1667 *11.95 ≈ let's compute that exactly.

24.1667 *11.95: 24 *11.95 is 286.8, 0.1667 *11.95 is approx 2 (exactly, 0.1667 *12 is 2, so 0.1667 *11.95 is about 1.9916). So total is 286.8 +1.9916≈288.79. So about $288.79. But none of the options for 15' width are close to that. The options are A:199.99, E:300, F:250, G:275.95, I:224.06.

Hmm, maybe I'm not considering that the carpet can be cut to fit, so perhaps I can buy exactly the needed area without extra, but I don't think that's possible because the width is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the 15-foot width is more than the room's 11.25-foot dimension, so I can run the carpet in the other direction. Wait, the room is 14.5' by 11.25'. If I use the 15-foot width to cover the 14.5-foot dimension, then the length needed would be 11.25 feet. So the area would be 15 *11.25 =168.75 sq ft, which is 18.75 sq yd. Then the cost would be 18.75 *11.95.

Calculating that: 18 *11.95 is 215.1, 0.75 *11.95 is 8.9625. So total is 215.1 +8.9625=224.0625, which is approximately $224.06.

Wait, that's option I:15' width, $224.06. But wait, the question is which is more economical, 15' or 12' width.

So I have to do the same calculation for the 12-foot width.

For the 12-foot width, how much carpet do I need to buy?

Again, the room is 14.5' by 11.25'. If I choose the 12-foot width, I can see if 12 feet is enough for one of the dimensions.

Wait, 12 feet is 12'0", which is greater than 11'3" (11.25'). So if I use the 12-foot width to cover the 11.25-foot dimension, then the length needed would be 14.5 feet. So the area would be 12 *14.5 =174 sq ft, which is 19.3333 sq yd. So the cost is 19.3333 *11.95.

Calculating that: 19 *11.95 is 227.05, 0.3333 *11.95≈4 (since 0.3333 *12=4, so 0.3333 *11.95≈3.983). So total is 227.05 +3.983≈231.03.

But wait, maybe that's not the most efficient way. Alternatively, maybe I can lay the carpet the other way. Let me see. If I use the 12-foot width to cover the longer dimension, 14.5 feet. But 14.5 is longer than 12 feet, so that doesn't work. So I have to have the width cover the shorter dimension, 11.25 feet, and then the length is 14.5 feet.

Wait, but 12-foot width is more than enough for 11.25 feet, so that's acceptable. So the area is 12 *14.5=174 sq ft, which is 19.3333 sq yd, as before.

So cost is 19.3333 *11.95≈231.03.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I can buy less by matching the dimensions better. Let me think again.

For the 15-foot width option, when I lay it so that the 15-foot width covers the 14.5-foot dimension, the length needed is 11.25 feet. So the area is 15*11.25=168.75 sq ft (18.75 sq yd), costing $224.06.

For the 12-foot width, the area is 12*14.5=174 sq ft (19.3333 sq yd), costing about $231.03.

So the 15-foot width requires less area (18.75 vs 19.3333), so it's cheaper. So the more economical option is 15-foot width, costing approximately $224.06.

Looking at the options, which one matches that? Option I is 15' width, $224.06. Option A is 15' for $199.99, which is cheaper, but my calculation says 224.06. Option I seems to be the correct one.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the area for the 15-foot width. Let me check that again.

So, when using the 15-foot width, the room's 14.5-foot dimension is covered by the length of the carpet. So the carpet piece is 15ft (width) by 11.25ft (length, since the room's other dimension is 11.25ft).

Wait, wait a second. No, wait. The room is 14.5ft by 11.25ft. So when I lay the carpet with 15ft width covering the 14.5ft dimension, the length needed is 11.25ft. So the area is 15 *11.25 = 168.75 sq ft. Which is 18.75 sq yd.

But wait, 15ft is the width, and the length is 11.25ft, so yes, that's correct.

So the cost is 18.75 *11.95, which is 18 *11.95=215.1, plus 0.75 *11.95=8.9625, totaling 224.0625, which is $224.06, as I calculated earlier.

So the 15-foot width option costs $224.06, which is option I.

Now, checking the 12-foot width option again. If I lay the 12-foot width along the 11.25-foot dimension, then the length needed is 14.5ft. So the area is 12*14.5=174 sq ft, which is 19.3333 sq yd. The cost is 19.3333 *11.95. Let me compute that accurately.

19.3333 *11.95: 19 *11.95 is 227.05. 0.3333 *11.95 is approximately 3.9833. So total is 227.05 +3.9833≈231.03.

So the 12-foot width would cost approximately $231.03, which is more expensive than the 15-foot width's $224.06.

Wait, but let me check if there's a way to buy less for the 12-foot width. Suppose instead of using the 12-foot width to cover the 11.25-foot dimension, can I use it to cover the 14.5-foot dimension? But 14.5 feet is longer than 12 feet, so that's not possible. Therefore, the 12-foot width must cover the shorter 11.25-foot dimension, requiring 14.5 feet in length.

So the 15-foot width is more economical, costing $224.06, which is option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says 15' width is more economical, $224.06. So that
