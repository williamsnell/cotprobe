Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Wherever I go—the street, the shop, the house, or the steamboat—I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they are yet unable to conceive of the Negro as possessing any rights at all. Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'
"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate."
—Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question. Let me break it down step by step. The question is about identifying which historical development contributed to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15. 

First, I remember that the Federalist Papers were written to support the ratification of the US Constitution. Each paper addresses specific issues. Federalist #15, I think, deals with the problems of the Articles of Confederation and the need for a stronger central government. It probably discusses issues like national security, foreign policy, and economic stability.

Now, looking at the quote provided, it's about the mistreatment of African Americans post-Civil War, but that's not directly related to the Federalist Papers. The question is about the sentiment in Federalist #15, so I should focus on events from the time when the Federalist Papers were written, around 1787-1788.

The options given are from A to J, each describing a different historical event. I need to pick the one that relates to the issues discussed in Federalist #15. Let me think about what each option refers to.

Option A: Dutch traders forcing tribute. I think the Barbary Wars were about tribute, but that was later. Maybe not relevant here.

Option B: Russian explorers in the Pacific Northwest. That's more about westward expansion and might relate to later events, not the immediate concerns of the Federalist era.

Option C: Portugal trade restrictions. I'm not sure about Portugal's role around that time. Maybe it's about trade issues, which could affect the economy, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Spain denying access to the Mississippi River. Oh, right! The Mississippi River was crucial for trade, especially for western settlers. Spain controlled it during the Confederation period, and this caused problems because the US couldn't effectively manage trade without access. This could lead to economic issues and national security concerns, which the Federalist Papers would address.

Option E: Italian mercenaries seizing the Mississippi. I don't recall any such event around that time. It sounds unlikely.

Option F: Great Britain refusing to evacuate forts. Yes, after the Revolutionary War, the British kept forts in the Northwest Territory, which is now the Great Lakes region. They supported Native American resistance against American settlers, which was a big issue. This would relate to national security and the government's inability to protect its citizens under the Articles of Confederation.

Option G: French and Spanish skirmishes with settlers. I think France had ceded a lot of territory by then, so maybe Spain was more active. But I'm not sure how this directly ties to the main issues in Federalist #15.

Option H: British supporting Indian raids. This sounds similar to option F. The British were indeed supporting Native Americans, which caused frontier conflicts. This would highlight the weakness of the central government under the Articles.

Option I: French aiding Indians in New England. France had already lost control of most of North America by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, so this might not be the case. Maybe it's about earlier times.

Option J: Spain retaking Florida. Florida was controlled by Spain, but I don't think they retook it from the US because the US didn't have it yet. After the Revolution, Florida was still Spanish until 1819 or so.

Now, considering Federalist #15, which I believe discusses the weaknesses of the Confederation in dealing with foreign powers and internal security. The specific issues would include foreign powers meddling with Native Americans to attack settlers and the inability to control strategic trade routes.

Between options D and F, which one is more relevant. Option D is about the Mississippi River, which was a significant trade issue. The Spanish closure of the Mississippi (though I think it was more about the right of deposit at New Orleans) was a problem because it affected trade for western settlers. However, the immediate issue in Federalist #15, if I recall, was more about national defense and foreign influence on Native Americans.

So option H: British forces supporting Indian tribes in raids. This directly relates to the inability of the Confederation government to protect its citizens, which was a key point in the Federalist Papers arguing for a stronger central government.

Wait, looking back, option F is about the British not evacuating forts. That's part of the same issue—British presence and support for Native Americans. So option F is about the forts, which is a foreign policy issue, while option H is about the support for raids.

In the Federalist Papers, both issues were discussed, but I think Federalist #15 specifically talks about the general inability to handle foreign affairs, including the British not leaving forts and inciting Native American attacks.

So which option is more directly connected? The question is about which development contributed to the sentiment in Federalist #15. The sentiment is about the inability of the Confederation to handle national security and foreign relations, leading to a need for a stronger central government.

Therefore, the correct answer would be F: Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Option H is about supporting the raids, which is a consequence of not evacuating the forts. So the forts issue (F) is the cause, which led to the support of the Indian raids (H). So which one is the specific development that contributed to the sentiment?

The question asks which specific development contributed. So it's about the event itself, not just the consequence.

So, the refusal to evacuate the forts (option F) was a direct challenge to US sovereignty, which the Confederation couldn't address effectively. This would have been a key point in Federalist #15 to argue for a stronger federal government to handle foreign affairs and national defense.

Therefore, the answer should be F.

The question asks which specific development contributed to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, which was written to highlight the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation and the need for a stronger central government. Federalist #15 addresses issues such as national security, foreign policy, and the government's inability to protect its citizens and manage foreign relations effectively.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** refers to Dutch traders forcing tribute payments, which is more related to later events like the Barbary Wars and not relevant to the Federalist era.
- **Option B** involves Russian explorers in the Pacific Northwest, which pertains to later westward expansion and is not directly connected to the issues of the 1780s.
- **Option C** mentions Portugal imposing trade restrictions, but there is no significant evidence linking this to the specific concerns of Federalist #15.
- **Option D** discusses Spain denying access to the Mississippi River, which was a critical trade issue. However, the more immediate concern in Federalist #15 was national security and foreign influence.
- **Option E** refers to Italian mercenaries seizing the Mississippi River, which is historically unlikely and not relevant.
- **Option F** highlights Great Britain refusing to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region after the Revolutionary War. This was a significant issue, as British presence in these forts supported Native American resistance against American settlers, directly exposing the weaknesses of the Confederation in handling foreign affairs and national security.
- **Option G** involves French and Spanish skirmishes with settlers, but France had ceded most of its North American territory by this time, making this less relevant.
- **Option H** refers to British forces supporting Native American raids, which was a consequence of the British not evacuating the forts (as in Option F). While related, the specific development causing this issue was the British refusal to leave the forts.
- **Option I** mentions French aid to Native Americans in New England, but France had already lost control of most of North America by 1783.
- **Option J** refers to Spain retaking Florida, which did not occur during this period as Florida remained under Spanish control until 1819.

The key issue in Federalist #15 was the Confederation's inability to address foreign policy failures, such as the British refusal to evacuate forts, which symbolized the weakness of the central government. This specific development directly contributed to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15.

**Answer: F**
