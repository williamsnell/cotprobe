Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to evaluate a line integral using Green's Theorem. Hmm, I remember Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve to a double integral over the region it encloses. The theorem is something like the integral of P dx + Q dy equals the double integral of (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA, right?

The problem gives the integral ∮ y³ dx + x³ dy, and C is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. The circle is positively oriented, which I think means it's counterclockwise. So, I can apply Green's Theorem here since the conditions are met (the region is simply connected, and the functions are nice enough).

Let me identify P and Q. In this case, P is y³ because it's multiplied by dx, and Q is x³ because it's multiplied by dy. So, P = y³ and Q = x³.

Now, according to Green's Theorem, I need to compute the partial derivatives ∂Q/∂x and ∂P/∂y. Let me calculate each:

∂Q/∂x is the derivative of x³ with respect to x. The derivative of x³ is 3x².

∂P/∂y is the derivative of y³ with respect to y. That's 3y².

So, the integrand for the double integral becomes (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) = 3x² - 3y².

Now, the double integral is over the region D enclosed by the circle of radius 2. So, it's a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2. To compute this, it's probably easier to switch to polar coordinates because the region is a circle.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dA = r dr dθ. The limits for r would be from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

Substituting into the integrand: 3x² - 3y² becomes 3(r cosθ)^2 - 3(r sinθ)^2. Let's factor out the 3r²:

3r² (cos²θ - sin²θ).

Wait, cos²θ - sin²θ is cos(2θ). So the integrand simplifies to 3r² cos(2θ).

So the double integral becomes the integral over θ from 0 to 2π and r from 0 to 2 of 3r² cos(2θ) * r dr dθ. Wait, because dA is r dr dθ, so the integrand is multiplied by r. Let me write that correctly.

Wait, the integrand is 3r² cos(2θ), and then multiplied by r dr dθ, so overall: 3r³ cos(2θ) dr dθ.

So the integral is ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) 3 r³ cos(2θ) dr dθ.

Hmm, I can separate this into two integrals since the variables are independent. So, the integral becomes 3 [ ∫ r³ dr from 0 to 2 ] * [ ∫ cos(2θ) dθ from 0 to 2π ].

Wait, wait. Let me think again. No, wait, the integrand is 3 r³ cos(2θ), which is 3 cos(2θ) * r³. So the integral over r and θ is ∫∫ 3 r³ cos(2θ) dr dθ. So I can separate the integrals into (3∫r³ dr from 0 to2) multiplied by (∫cos(2θ) dθ from 0 to 2π).

Yes, that makes sense because the integrand factors into functions of r and θ separately.

So let's compute each integral.

First, the radial integral: ∫ from 0 to 2 of r³ dr.

The integral of r³ dr is (r^4)/4. Evaluated from 0 to 2: (2^4)/4 - 0 = 16/4 = 4.

So the radial part is 3 * 4 = 12.

Now, the angular integral: ∫ from 0 to 2π of cos(2θ) dθ.

The integral of cos(2θ) with respect to θ is (1/2) sin(2θ). Evaluated from 0 to 2π.

So, (1/2) [sin(4π) - sin(0)] = (1/2)(0 - 0) = 0.

Wait, that's zero. So the entire double integral becomes 12 * 0 = 0.

So the value of the line integral is zero.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because if the angular integral is zero, then regardless of the radial part, the whole thing is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me re-examine the integrand. The Green's Theorem integrand was 3x² - 3y². So when I converted to polar, that's 3r² cos^2θ - 3r² sin^2θ = 3r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = 3 r² cos(2θ). Then multiplied by dA = r dr dθ, giving 3 r^3 cos(2θ) dr dθ. So that part seems correct.

Then, when integrating, the radial part is ∫0 to2 of r^3 dr = 4, multiplied by 3 gives 12.

The angular part is ∫0 to2π cos(2θ) dθ. Let me compute that again. The integral is [ (sin(2θ) ) / 2 ] from 0 to 2π. At θ=2π, sin(4π)=0. At θ=0, sin(0)=0. So yes, the integral is zero.

So the whole integral is 12 * 0 = 0.

Looking at the options, option F is 0. So the answer should be F.

To evaluate the line integral $\oiint_{C} y^3 dx + x^3 dy$ using Green's Theorem, we first identify $P = y^3$ and $Q = x^3$. Green's Theorem states:

\[
\oiint_{C} P dx + Q dy = \iint_{D} \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) dA,
\]

where $D$ is the region enclosed by the positively oriented circle $C$ of radius 2 centered at the origin.

1. **Compute the partial derivatives**:
   - $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^3) = 3x^2$
   - $\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(y^3) = 3y^2$

   Thus, the integrand for the double integral becomes:
   \[
   \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = 3x^2 - 3y^2.
   \]

2. **Convert to polar coordinates**:
   Since $D$ is a circle of radius 2, we switch to polar coordinates where $x = r\cos\theta$, $y = r\sin\theta$, and $dA = r dr d\theta$. The limits are $r \in [0, 2]$ and $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$. Substituting into the integrand:
   \[
   3x^2 - 3y^2 = 3r^2(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta) = 3r^2\cos(2\theta).
   \]

   The double integral becomes:
   \[
   \iint_{D} 3r^2\cos(2\theta) \cdot r dr d\theta = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} 3r^3\cos(2\theta) dr d\theta.
   \]

3. **Separate and evaluate the integrals**:
   The integral can be factored into radial and angular parts:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos(2\theta) d\theta \cdot \int_{0}^{2} 3r^3 dr.
   \]

   - **Radial integral**:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{2} 3r^3 dr = 3 \cdot \frac{r^4}{4} \Big|_{0}^{2} = 3 \cdot \frac{16}{4} = 12.
     \]

   - **Angular integral**:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos(2\theta) d\theta = \frac{\sin(2\theta)}{2} \Big|_{0}^{2\pi} = \frac{\sin(4\pi) - \sin(0)}{2} = 0.
     \]

4. **Combine results**:
   The double integral is the product of the radial and angular integrals:
   \[
   12 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

Thus, the value of the line integral is $0$. From the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: 0**
