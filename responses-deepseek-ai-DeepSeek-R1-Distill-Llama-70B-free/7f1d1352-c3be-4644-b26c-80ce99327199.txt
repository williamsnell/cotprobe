Okay, so I need to figure out the loss per share and the total loss for Mr. Darnell's stock transaction. Let's start by understanding the problem.

Mr. Darnell bought 20 shares of AT&T common stock at $182.50 per share. Then, two months later, he sold each share for $168.75. I need to calculate how much loss he incurred per share and the total loss overall.

Hmm, loss per share should be the difference between the purchase price and the selling price, right? So for each share, he bought it for $182.50 and sold it for $168.75. So subtracting the selling price from the purchase price gives the loss per share.

Let me do that math: 182.50 minus 168.75. Let me calculate that. 182.50 - 168.75. Hmm, 182 minus 168 is 14, and the cents part: 0.50 - 0.75 would be negative 0.25. So wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Alternatively, think of 182.50 as 180 + 2.50, and 168.75 as 160 + 8.75. Wait, maybe it's easier to subtract directly:

182.50
-168.75
---------
Let me subtract the dollars first: 182 - 168 = 14. Then the cents: 0.50 - 0.75. Oh wait, I can't subtract 0.75 from 0.50 because it's smaller. So I'll need to borrow a dollar, making it 13 dollars and 114.50 cents? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should subtract 168.75 from 182.50 step by step.

Wait, 168.75 is the selling price. So loss per share is (purchase price - selling price) when it's a loss, which it is here because he sold lower than he bought.

So 182.50 - 168.75.

Let me compute this:

182.50
-168.75
= ?

Starting from the right, 0 -5 in the hundredths place. Can't do that, so borrow from the tenths. So 0 becomes 10, but tenths place is 5, so borrow from there. Tenths place is 5, so becomes 4, and the hundredths become 10. Then 10 -5 is 5.

Tenths place: 4 -7. Wait, 4 is in tenths place. Oh wait, no, after borrowing, the tenths place is 4 (since we took one tenth to make a hundredth). So 4 -7 can't be done. So borrow again from the units place.

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to convert to fractions or decimals.

Alternatively, compute 182.50 - 168.75. Let's see:

= (182 -168) + (0.50 - 0.75)
= 14 + (-0.25)
= 13.75.

Wait, that makes sense. So per share loss is $13.75.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, 182.50 minus 168.75 is 13.75? Let me check with another approach.

Another way: 168.75 + 13.75 = 182.50? Let me add 168.75 +13.75.

168.75 +13.75: 168 +13=181, 0.75+0.75=1.50. So 181 +1.50=182.50. Yes, correct. So per share loss is $13.75. 

So per share loss is $13.75. Now, the total loss would be per share loss multiplied by the number of shares, which is 20.

So 13.75 * 20 = ?

Let me compute that. 13 * 20 is 260, and 0.75 *20 is 15, so 260 +15=275.

So total loss is $275.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option has $13.75 per share loss and total loss $275.

Looking at the options:

Option J: $13.75 per share, total loss $275.00.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To determine Mr. Darnell's loss per share and total loss, we start by calculating the difference between the purchase price and the selling price per share. The purchase price is $182.50, and the selling price is $168.75. 

### Loss Per Share:
\[
\text{Loss Per Share} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price} = 182.50 - 168.75 = 13.75
\]

### Total Loss:
Mr. Darnell purchased 20 shares, so the total loss is the loss per share multiplied by the number of shares:
\[
\text{Total Loss} = \text{Loss Per Share} \times \text{Number of Shares} = 13.75 \times 20 = 275.00
\]

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **J: $13.75 per share, total loss $275.00**.
