Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about goods and their characteristics. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is asking which type of goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk.

Hmm, I remember that goods can be classified into different categories based on factors like purchase frequency, usage, and risk involved. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Staple goods. These are everyday items that people buy regularly, like food and toiletries. They're bought frequently, so that doesn't fit the "infrequently" part. So probably not A.

Option B: Specialty goods. These are unique or specific items that consumers are willing to make an effort to purchase. They might be bought less often, but I'm not sure about the risk part. Maybe, but I need to think more.

Option C: Luxury goods. These are high-end items, like designer clothes or expensive jewelry. They're bought infrequently because they're pricey. But do they involve high consumer risk? Maybe, because they're expensive and if they don't meet expectations, it's a big loss. But I'm not certain if this is the best fit.

Option D: Perishable goods. These are items that spoil quickly, like fruits and vegetables. They're bought often, so that doesn't align with being bought infrequently. So D is out.

Option E: Impulse goods. These are items bought on a whim without much planning, like candy at the checkout counter. They're bought frequently, maybe, but not sure about the risk. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: Durable goods. These are items that last a long time, like cars or appliances. They're bought infrequently because they don't need to be replaced often. They're used repeatedly, which fits. Also, buying a car or fridge involves high risk because they're expensive and important, so there's a high level of consumer risk. This seems to match all the criteria.

Option G: Non-durable goods. These are consumed quickly, like clothing or food. They're bought more frequently, so G doesn't fit.

Option H: Services. Services are intangible, like a haircut or a consultation. They might be purchased at varying frequencies, but the question is about goods, so H is probably not the answer.

Option I: Unsought goods. These are items that people don't think about buying until they need them, like insurance or funeral services. They might be bought infrequently, but I'm not sure about the high risk part. Maybe, but I'm leaning more towards F.

Option J: Complementary goods. These are items that go together with another product, like a phone and its accessories. They might be bought when the main product is purchased, but the risk factor doesn't seem as high as with durables.

Wait, putting it all together: the goods in question are bought infrequently (so not staples, perishables, etc.), used repeatedly (so durable makes sense), and high consumer risk (like expensive, long-lasting items). So F: Durable goods seems to fit best.

The goods described are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a high level of consumer risk. Durable goods, such as cars or appliances, fit these criteria as they are purchased less often, last a long time, and carry significant financial and decision-making risks.

Answer: F
