Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read it carefully. The homeowner conveyed his property for a dollar, and the deed has a bunch of conditions. The question is about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime.

Alright, let's break down the conveyance. The deed says: "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt, then..." Hmm, okay, so first, the daughter gets a life estate. Then, it goes to the aunt for life, but there's a condition: if the aunt moves, it goes to the sister instead. After that, there's some stuff about heirs, but maybe that's not the main point right now.

I'm focusing on the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime. So currently, the daughter is alive, so her life estate is active. The next in line is the aunt, but if the aunt moves, it goes to the sister for the aunt's life. So what kind of interest does the aunt have?

I remember that remainders can be vested or contingent. A vested remainder is when the right to the property is certain, but it's just waiting for some event (like someone dying) to take effect. Contingent remainders depend on some condition happening in the future.

So looking at the aunt's interest, it's a life estate that might be taken away if she moves. So her interest is only if she doesn't move. If she does move, then the sister gets it. So is the aunt's interest vested or contingent?

Wait, the aunt's interest is given, but it's subject to a condition subsequent. Because if she moves, the interest shifts. So it's like she has a vested remainder, but it's subject to being divested if she moves.

Another thing is that there's an executory interest involved because if the condition is met (aunt moves), the property goes to the sister. So perhaps the sister has an executory interest. But the question is about the aunt's interest.

Vested remainders can be subject to open or closed. Wait, no, that's more about whether more people can be added. Or maybe it's about partial or complete divestiture. So the aunt's interest is a vested remainder that might be taken away if she moves. So it's a vested remainder subject to divestiture.

Looking at the options, option I is "vested remainder subject to partial divestiture," and J is "vested remainder subject to complete divestiture." So which is it?

Wait, if the aunt moves, does she lose her entire interest, or just part of it? The deed says if she moves, it goes to the sister for the aunt's life. So the aunt's life estate is replaced by the sister's life estate. So the aunt's interest is completely taken away if she moves. So it's a complete divestiture.

So the aunt's interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture. So that would be option J.

Another angle: the aunt's interest is a future interest that's vested because it's not subject to a condition precedent; it's only subject to a condition subsequent. Because the aunt is already alive, and the only condition is her moving, which is a condition that could happen or not. So the interest is vested but subject to being taken away if she moves. So it's a vested remainder subject to divestiture.

Yes, I think J is the correct answer.

The homeowner's deed conveys the property as follows: "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt." The question focuses on the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime. 

The daughter currently holds a life estate, and the aunt's interest is next in line. The aunt's interest is a life estate, but it is subject to a condition subsequent: if the aunt moves to another state, her interest is divested, and the sister receives a life estate instead. This makes the aunt's interest a vested remainder because it is not subject to a condition precedent (it is already granted), but it is subject to being taken away if the condition (moving to another state) occurs. Since the aunt's entire interest would be replaced by the sister's interest if the condition is met, this is a case of complete divestiture.

Among the options provided:

- **A: vested remainder subject to open** — Incorrect, as the issue is not about whether additional interests can be added.
- **B: contingent remainder** — Incorrect, as the aunt's interest is not contingent on a condition precedent.
- **C: fee simple subject to executory limitation** — Incorrect, as this describes a fee simple interest, not a life estate.
- **D: reversionary interest** — Incorrect, as this refers to an interest that reverts to the grantor, which is not the case here.
- **E: life estate pur autre vie** — Incorrect, as this describes a life estate measured by someone else's life, which is not relevant to the aunt's interest.
- **F: shifting executory interest** — Incorrect, as this describes an interest that shifts to another upon a condition, which applies to the sister, not the aunt.
- **G: fee simple determinable** — Incorrect, as this describes a fee simple interest subject to a condition, not a life estate.
- **H: fee simple subject to condition subsequent** — Incorrect, as this again describes a fee simple interest, not a life estate.
- **I: vested remainder subject to partial divestiture** — Incorrect, as the aunt's entire interest would be divested, not partially.
- **J: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture** — Correct, as the aunt's vested remainder is subject to being entirely taken away if she moves to another state.

Thus, the aunt's interest is best described as a **vested remainder subject to complete divestiture**.
