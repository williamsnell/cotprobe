Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about binary solutions and activity coefficients. Hmm, activity is given for component 1, and I need to find the expression for component 2. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the problem states that R ln a₁ equals R ln x₁ plus A x₂² plus B x₂³. So, R ln a₁ = R ln x₁ + A x₂² + B x₂³. And I need to find R ln a₂.

Wait, I remember that in a binary solution, the sum of the mole fractions x₁ and x₂ is 1. So x₂ = 1 - x₁. Maybe that will come in handy later.

Also, there's the Gibbs-Duhem equation, which relates the changes in the chemical potentials (or activities) of the components in a solution. Since the activity a is related to the chemical potential by μ = μ° + RT ln a, the Gibbs-Duhem equation would tie the activities of the two components together.

The Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of activity coefficients (since a_i = γ_i x_i for each component) is: x₁ d ln a₁ + x₂ d ln a₂ = 0. Or wait, maybe it's in terms of the differentials of the logarithms. Let me get that right. Oh, right, for an ideal solution, the activity is just the mole fraction, but here it's non-ideal.

Wait, another approach: I think the Gibbs-Duhem equation can be written as x₁ d(ln a₁) + x₂ d(ln a₂) = 0. So integrating this might give me the relationship between a₁ and a₂.

Given that, let me try to find ln a₂ in terms of ln a₁ and the given expression.

Wait, but the given equation is for a₁. So maybe I can express ln a₂ in terms of x₂, using the Gibbs-Duhem equation.

Alternatively, I remember that for binary solutions, the activity expressions must satisfy certain conditions, especially when x approaches 0 or 1.

Wait, another thought: the Gibbs-Duhem equation can be expressed as:

x₁ (dμ₁) + x₂ (dμ₂) = 0

But since μ = μ° + RT ln a, then dμ = RT d(ln a). So,

RT [x₁ d(ln a₁) + x₂ d(ln a₂)] = 0

Dividing both sides by RT:

x₁ d(ln a₁) + x₂ d(ln a₂) = 0

So, d(ln a₂) = - (x₁/x₂) d(ln a₁)

Hmm, but integrating this might be complicated. Maybe another approach is better.

Wait, I think there's another relation that comes from the Gibbs free energy of mixing. Maybe I can integrate the given equation for a₁ and then find a₂.

Wait, let's consider that the solution is symmetric in some way. So, when you switch components 1 and 2, the expressions should adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, let me think about the given expression for a₁. 

Given R ln a₁ = R ln x₁ + A x₂² + B x₂³.

I can write this as ln a₁ = ln x₁ + (A/R) x₂² + (B/R) x₂³.

Wait, but I think the Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of the activity coefficients (γ) is:

x₁ d ln γ₁ + x₂ d ln γ₂ = 0.

Because a = γ x, so ln a = ln γ + ln x.

So, substituting into the Gibbs-Duhem equation:

x₁ (d ln γ₁ + d ln x₁) + x₂ (d ln γ₂ + d ln x₂) ) = 0.

Wait, but since x₂ = 1 - x₁, the differential d x₂ = - d x₁. So d ln x₂ = ( - d x₁ ) / x₂.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let me try a different approach.

I have ln a₁ = ln x₁ + (A/R) x₂² + (B/R) x₂³.

So ln γ₁ = (A/R) x₂² + (B/R) x₂³.

Similarly, for component 2, ln γ₂ would be expressed in terms of x₁² and x₁³ terms because when you switch the components, x₂ becomes x₁.

Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe I can express everything in terms of x₁.

Since x₂ = 1 - x₁, I can write x₂² = (1 - x₁)^2 = 1 - 2x₁ + x₁², and x₂³ = (1 - x₁)^3 = 1 - 3x₁ + 3x₁² - x₁³.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Gibbs-Duhem equation to integrate and find ln γ₂.

The Gibbs-Duhem equation is x₁ d ln γ₁ + x₂ d ln γ₂ = 0.

So, d ln γ₂ = - (x₁ / x₂) d ln γ₁.

Let me substitute d ln γ₁, which is the derivative of (A/R x₂² + B/R x₂³) with respect to x₂ (since x₂ is the variable here, or perhaps x₁ is the variable because x₂ = 1 - x₁).

Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of x₁, since x₂ = 1 - x₁.

So, let's let x = x₁. Then x₂ = 1 - x.

So, ln γ₁ = (A/R)(1 - x)^2 + (B/R)(1 - x)^3.

Now, the Gibbs-Duhem equation is x d ln γ₁ + (1 - x) d ln γ₂ = 0.

Wait, but we need to take the differentials with respect to x. Let me compute d ln γ₁/dx first.

So, d ln γ₁/dx = (A/R)(2(1 - x)(-1)) + (B/R)(3(1 - x)^2 (-1)).

Simplifying:

= (A/R)(-2)(1 - x) + (B/R)(-3)(1 - x)^2.

So,

d ln γ₁/dx = - (2A/R)(1 - x) - (3B/R)(1 - x)^2.

Now, from Gibbs-Duhem:

x [d ln γ₁/dx] + (1 - x) [d ln γ₂/dx] = 0.

So,

(1 - x) [d ln γ₂/dx] = -x [d ln γ₁/dx].

So,

d ln γ₂/dx = -x/(1 - x) * [d ln γ₁/dx].

Substituting d ln γ₁/dx:

d ln γ₂/dx = -x/(1 - x) [ -2A/R (1 - x) - 3B/R (1 - x)^2 ]

Simplify the negatives:

= x/(1 - x) [ 2A/R (1 - x) + 3B/R (1 - x)^2 ]

Factor out (1 - x):

= x/(1 - x) * (1 - x) [ 2A/R + 3B/R (1 - x) ) ]

The (1 - x) terms cancel out:

= x [ 2A/R + 3B/R (1 - x) ]

= (2A x)/R + (3B x (1 - x))/R.

Now, this is the derivative of ln γ₂ with respect to x. So, to find ln γ₂, we integrate this expression with respect to x.

So,

ln γ₂ = ∫ [ (2A x)/R + (3B x (1 - x))/R ] dx + C,

where C is the constant of integration.

Let's compute the integral term by term.

First term: (2A/R) ∫ x dx = (2A/R)(x²/2) = (A/R) x².

Second term: (3B/R) ∫ x (1 - x) dx = (3B/R) ∫ (x - x²) dx = (3B/R) [ x²/2 - x³/3 ].

So,

ln γ₂ = (A/R) x² + (3B/R)(x²/2 - x³/3) + C.

Simplify the terms:

= (A/R) x² + (3B/R)( (3x² - 2x³)/6 )

Wait, alternatively, (x²/2 - x³/3) can be written as (3x² - 2x³)/6.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The second term is (3B/R) [ x²/2 - x³/3 ].

So,

= (3B/R)(x²/2) - (3B/R)(x³/3)
= (3B x²)/(2R) - (B x³)/R.

So, combining all terms:

ln γ₂ = (A/R) x² + (3B x²)/(2R) - (B x³)/R + C.

Now, combine like terms:

The x² terms are (A/R) x² + (3B)/(2R) x² = [ (2A + 3B) / (2R) ) ] x².

Wait, no, wait: (A/R) is A/R, and (3B)/(2R) is 3B/(2R), so together:

= ( (2A + 3B) )/(2R) ) x².

Wait, let me compute (A/R) + (3B)/(2R) ) as (2A + 3B)/(2R).

So,

ln γ₂ = [ (2A + 3B) / (2R) ) ] x² - (B/R) x³ + C.

Now, we need to determine the constant C. To find C, consider the limit as x approaches 0. When x approaches 0, x₂ approaches 1, so the solution is almost pure component 2. In this case, the activity a₂ should approach 1 (since pure substances have activity 1). So, as x → 0, ln γ₂ → 0.

Wait, wait: when x → 0 (x₁ → 0, so x₂ → 1), the activity a₂ should tend to x₂ times γ₂. But when x₂ =1, a₂ = γ₂ (since x₂=1). But for pure component, a₂=1, so γ₂ must be 1 when x₂=1 (x=0). So, ln γ₂ must be 0 when x=0.

Wait, but when x=0, our expression becomes:

ln γ₂ = 0 + 0 + C = C.

So C must be 0.

So, ln γ₂ = [ (2A + 3B) / (2R) ) ] x² - (B/R) x³.

Wait, but let me check the limits again. When x=1 (x₂=0), the activity a₁ should be 1, so γ₁=1. Let's see what our expression for ln γ₁ gives when x₂=0 (x=1):

ln γ₁ = (A/R) x₂² + (B/R) x₂³ → 0. So that's correct.

So, now, putting it all together, ln γ₂ is:

ln γ₂ = (A x²)/(R) + (3B x²)/(2R) - (B x³)/R.

Wait, perhaps we can factor this differently:

= (A/R) x² + (3B)/(2R) x² - (B/R) x³.

Combine the x² terms:

= [ (2A + 3B) / (2R) ] x² - (B/R) x³.

Now, the activity a₂ is γ₂ x₂.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. a₂ = γ₂ x₂. So,

ln a₂ = ln γ₂ + ln x₂.

But in our case, x₂ = 1 - x. So,

ln a₂ = ln γ₂ + ln (1 - x).

But wait, in the given problem, the equation for a₁ is R ln a₁ = R ln x₁ + A x₂² + B x₂³. So,

R ln a₁ = R ln x₁ + A x₂² + B x₂³.

So, for a₂, R ln a₂ = R ln x₂ + [terms involving x₁].

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me re-express everything.

Wait, earlier, I wrote ln γ₂ as:

ln γ₂ = (A/R) x² + (3B x²)/(2R) - (B x³)/R.

But x is x₁. So, x² is x₁².

Alternatively, let me factor this expression:

ln γ₂ = [ (A x₁²) + (3B x₁²)/2 - B x₁³ ] / R.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor x₁²:

= x₁² (A + (3B/2) - B x₁) / R.

So,

ln γ₂ = (x₁² (A + (3B/2) - B x₁ )) / R.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to directly match any of the options I'm seeing. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, all the options for a₂ are expressed in terms of x₂ or x₁. Let's see:

Option B: R ln a₂ = R ln x₂ + A x₁² + B [ (3/2)x₁² - x₁³ ]

Which would be R ln a₂ = R ln x₂ + A x₁² + (3B/2) x₁² - B x₁³.

So, ln a₂ = ln x₂ + (A x₁² + (3B/2)x₁² - B x₁³ ) / R.

Wait, but in our expression, ln a₂ = ln x₂ + ln γ₂.

Which is ln a₂ = ln x₂ + [A x₁²/(R) + 3B x₁²/(2R) - B x₁³/R ].

Which is the same as:

ln a₂ = ln x₂ + (A x₁² + (3B/2) x₁² - B x₁³) / R.

Which matches option B when you factor R.

Wait, but let me check the option B again.

Option B: R ln a₂ = R ln x₂ + A x₁² + B [ (3/2) x₁² - x₁³ ]

So, R ln a₂ = R ln x₂ + A x₁² + (3B/2) x₁² - B x₁³.

Yes, so the terms after R ln x₂ are A x₁² + (3B/2) x₁² - B x₁³.

Which is exactly what we have in our expression.

So, our derived expression matches option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me check if any other option matches.

Option F: R ln a₂ = R ln x₂ + A x₁² + B [x₁² - x₁³ ].

Hmm, that would be A x₁² + B x₁² - B x₁³. Not matching our terms.

Option E: R ln a₂ = R ln x₂ + A x₁² - B [ (3/2)x₁² - x₁³ ]

Which would give A x₁² - (3B/2)x₁² + B x₁³. No, that's not what we have.

Option B seems to match correctly.

To solve the problem, we start with the given equation for the activity of component 1:

\[
R \ln a_1 = R \ln x_1 + A x_2^2 + B x_2^3
\]

Here, \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are the mole fractions of components 1 and 2, respectively, and \(A\) and \(B\) are constants. The goal is to derive an expression for \(R \ln a_2\), the activity of component 2, using the Gibbs-Duhem equation, which relates the activities of the two components in a binary solution:

\[
x_1 \frac{d \ln a_1}{dx_1} + x_2 \frac{d \ln a_2}{dx_2} = 0
\]

### Step 1: Express \(x_2\) in terms of \(x_1\)
Since \(x_1 + x_2 = 1\), we can write \(x_2 = 1 - x_1\). Substituting this into the given equation for \(R \ln a_1\), we get:

\[
R \ln a_1 = R \ln x_1 + A (1 - x_1)^2 + B (1 - x_1)^3
\]

Expanding \((1 - x_1)^2\) and \((1 - x_1)^3\):

\[
(1 - x_1)^2 = 1 - 2x_1 + x_1^2, \quad (1 - x_1)^3 = 1 - 3x_1 + 3x_1^2 - x_1^3
\]

Substituting these expansions:

\[
R \ln a_1 = R \ln x_1 + A (1 - 2x_1 + x_1^2) + B (1 - 3x_1 + 3x_1^2 - x_1^3)
\]

Simplify:

\[
R \ln a_1 = R \ln x_1 + A - 2A x_1 + A x_1^2 + B - 3B x_1 + 3B x_1^2 - B x_1^3
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
R \ln a_1 = R \ln x_1 + (A + B) - (2A + 3B)x_1 + (A + 3B)x_1^2 - B x_1^3
\]

### Step 2: Differentiate \(R \ln a_1\) with respect to \(x_1\)
To use the Gibbs-Duhem equation, we need \(\frac{d \ln a_1}{dx_1}\). Divide through by \(R\):

\[
\ln a_1 = \ln x_1 + \frac{A + B}{R} - \frac{(2A + 3B)}
