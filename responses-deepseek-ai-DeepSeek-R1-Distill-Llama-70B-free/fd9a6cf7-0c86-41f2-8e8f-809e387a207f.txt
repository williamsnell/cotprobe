Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Catharine MacKinnon's arguments. I'm a bit rusty on feminist theory, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The question says that MacKinnon argues that since men dominate women, the issue is ultimately about power. So, the question is asking which proposition is most inconsistent with her argument.

First, I need to recall what MacKinnon's main points are. From what I remember, she's a radical feminist who believes that society is deeply patriarchal, and that this structure perpetuates the oppression of women. She argues that the law and social structures are created by men and for men, which maintains their dominance over women. So her focus is on the systemic power imbalance between genders.

The question is about which option contradicts this. So I need to look for an option that either denies the existence of such a power imbalance, or suggests that power isn't gender-based.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The power dynamic is determined by individual strength and not gender.

Hmm, this is saying that power comes from individual strength, not gender. That would go against MacKinnon's argument, which is that it's gender-based. So this could be a candidate for the answer.

Option B: The idea of 'woman' needs to be redefined.

I think MacKinnon might agree with this. She discusses how societal constructs shape gender roles, so redefining 'woman' in a way that's empowering could align with her views. So this isn't inconsistent.

Option C: Women inherently possess more power than men.

Wait, MacKinnon's argument is that men dominate, so if someone says women have more power, that's the opposite. But does she say anything about inherent power? I think she's more about social structures than inherent abilities. But if someone claims women are more powerful, that's contradictory. So this could be a contender.

Option D: Gender-based inequality is a myth.

MacKinnon definitely argues that gender-based inequality exists, so saying it's a myth would directly contradict her. So this is a strong candidate.

Option E: Men and women share equal power in society.

Again, this is the opposite of her argument. She says men dominate, so equal power would contradict her.

Option F: Equality is impossible because men define women as different.

Wait, MacKinnon might agree that as long as men define women as 'other' or different in a way that justifies inequality, equality is hard. So this might not be inconsistent. It's more of a supportive statement.

Option G: Women can achieve equality through political pressure.

I'm not sure. MacKinnon does talk about the need for change, so maybe she believes in political action. So this might not be inconsistent. Or maybe she's more pessimistic about it, but I'm not certain. I'll have to think more on this.

Option H: Men and women are inherently equal in all aspects.

This is tricky because MacKinnon's argument is about systemic inequality, not necessarily about inherent equality. She might agree that men and women are equal in worth but not in power. So this might not directly contradict her, unless she argues against inherent equality, which I don't think she does. So maybe this isn't the best option.

Option I: The concept of power is subjective and varies from person to person.

This seems to downplay the systemic aspect. MacKinnon is talking about systemic, structural power, not individual feelings about power. So if someone says power is just subjective, that would contradict her structural analysis. So this could be a contender.

Option J: The world is phallocentric and oppressive.

This aligns with her views, as phallocentric means male-centered, which she argues is the case. So this wouldn't be inconsistent.

Now, I need to pick the most inconsistent option. Let's review.

The question is about which is most inconsistent with MacKinnon's argument that the issue is about power dynamics based on gender.

Option C says women have more power, which is opposite to her point, but does she discuss inherent power, or just systemic? I think she's more about systemic, so maybe C isn't the best fit.

Option D says gender-based inequality is a myth, which directly opposes her argument. So D seems like a strong candidate.

Option E says men and women share equal power, which is also a direct contradiction.

Wait, but MacKinnon's argument is that men dominate, so both D and E are contradictions. But which one is more inconsistent? Because D is denying that inequality exists, while E is asserting equality exists.

I think both D and E are contradictory, but perhaps E is more directly about power dynamics. Because D is about inequality being a myth, implying that there's no issue, which is a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, E is saying that power is equal, which is the opposite of MacKinnon's power imbalance.

Wait, the question is about power. So if someone says power is equal, that's directly against her argument that men have more power. So E is a direct contradiction.

But wait, what about D: gender-based inequality is a myth. That's also a contradiction because MacKinnon is saying that inequality exists and is based on gender.

So which is more inconsistent? The question is about power, so E is more about power dynamics. D is about inequality in general.

But in MacKinnon's argument, the issue is power, so E directly opposes her stance on power imbalance. So maybe E is the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The options are about which is most inconsistent. So I need to decide between D and E, and maybe others.

Alternatively, Option C says women have more power. That's the opposite of her argument, so that's also a contradiction.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list each option's inconsistency.

Option A: Power from individual strength, not gender. This is inconsistent because MacKinnon says it's gender-based.

Option C: Women have more power. Opposite, so inconsistent.

Option D: Inequality is a myth. Directly opposes existence of gender-based inequality, which MacKinnon argues exists.

Option E: Equal power now. Directly contradicts her argument of male dominance.

So, which of these is the most inconsistent? The question is which is most inconsistent.

I think E is more directly about power, which is the focus of her argument. So E would be the most inconsistent.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the answer choices are from A to J. So in the options, E is "Men and women share equal power in society." That's a direct contradiction because MacKinnon's argument is that men dominate women, so unequal power.

So the most inconsistent proposition would be E.

Alternatively, Option C says women have more power, which is also a contradiction, but perhaps less direct because it's not about equality but a reversal.

Alternatively, Option D says inequality is a myth. That's a strong contradiction too.

I'm a bit stuck between D and E. Let me think: MacKinnon's argument is that men dominate women in terms of power. So E says they share equal power, which is a direct contradiction.

D says gender-based inequality is a myth, which also contradicts her, but perhaps E is more about power, which is the focus.

Wait, the question is about power. So the most inconsistent would be the one that directly opposes the power dynamic argument.

So between E and D, I think E is more about power dynamics, so E is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: MacKinnon says the issue is about power, so the most inconsistent would be a proposition that either denies power imbalance or attributes it to something else.

Option A says power is from individual strength, not gender. So that's inconsistent.

Option C says women have more power, so that's inconsistent.

Option D says inequality is a myth, which is inconsistent.

Option E says equal power, which is inconsistent.

So which is more inconsistent? The question asks which is most inconsistent.

I think Option C is saying women have more power, which is a direct opposite, but perhaps more extreme than E, which says equal. So C would be more inconsistent.

Wait, but MacKinnon's argument isn't just about unequal power, but about men having more. So if someone says women have more, that's a direct contradiction, making C more inconsistent than E.

Wait, but I'm getting confused now. Let me try to approach this differently.

The question is about which proposition is most inconsistent with MacKinnon's argument that the issue is one of power (men dominating women). So the propositions that either deny power imbalance, or say the opposite.

Options:

A: Power based on strength, not gender. So denies gender-based power, which is inconsistent.

B: Redefine 'woman.' Not necessarily inconsistent.

C: Women have more power. Opposite, so inconsistent.

D: Inequality is a myth. Inconsistent.

E: Equal power. Inconsistent.

F: Equality impossible because men define women as different. This could align with MacKinnon, as she talks about how women are defined by men.

G: Women can achieve equality through politics. She might agree, so not inconsistent.

H: Men and women are inherently equal. She might agree on equality, but her focus is on systemic power, so maybe this isn't inconsistent.

I: Power is subjective. Inconsistent, as she's talking about systemic power.

J: World is phallocentric. She agrees, so not inconsistent.

So among A, C, D, E, I.

Which is the most inconsistent? The question is about power. So the ones that directly oppose her power argument.

C says women have more power. That's a direct contradiction.

E says men and women share equal power, which is also a contradiction.

D says inequality is a myth, which is also a contradiction.

I think the most inconsistent would be the one that directly opposes her power argument. So between C, D, E.

Option C is a reversal: women have more power. That's a direct opposite.

Option E says power is equal.

Option D says inequality doesn't exist.

I think Option C is more inconsistent because it's not just denying the inequality but asserting the opposite hierarchy.

Wait, but MacKinnon's argument is that men have more power. So saying women have more power is the opposite, making it more inconsistent than saying there's equality or no inequality.

So I think Option C is the most inconsistent.

But wait, another thought: MacKinnon's point is that power is based on gender, not individual strength. So Option A is also inconsistent.

But the question is about which is most inconsistent.

Alternatively, Option E says men and women share equal power, which directly contradicts MacKinnon's assertion of male dominance.

So I'm torn between C and E.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because it's a direct contradiction on power dynamics, while C is a reversal but perhaps less likely.

Alternatively, let me think about what each option is stating.

Option C: Women inherently possess more power than men.

This is a claim about inherent power, which may not directly relate to MacKinnon's argument about systemic power structures. She might not necessarily argue that women have less inherent power, but rather that the system gives men more power.

So perhaps Option C is less inconsistent because it's about inherent power, which isn't her focus.

In contrast, Option E is about the current state of power in society, which directly contradicts her argument that men dominate.

So maybe E is more inconsistent.

Similarly, Option D says gender-based inequality is a myth, which is a strong contradiction because MacKinnon is arguing that such inequality exists.

So between D and E, which is more inconsistent? The question is about power, so E is about power equality, which directly opposes her power argument.

Wait, but D is about inequality in general, not specifically power. So perhaps E is more directly inconsistent.

Alternatively, another angle: the question asks which is most inconsistent. So the propositions that deny any gender-based power imbalance would be the most inconsistent.

Option E says men and women share equal power, so no imbalance. That's a direct contradiction.

Option D says inequality is a myth, which also denies the imbalance.

So which is more inconsistent? I think both are strong, but perhaps E is more about power, which is the specific focus.

So I'm leaning towards E as the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way.

If someone says that men and women have equal power, that would mean that there's no domination, which is exactly what MacKinnon is arguing against. So E would be the most inconsistent.

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer is E.

Catharine MacKinnon's argument focuses on the power imbalance between men and women, asserting that men dominate women due to systemic, structural factors. The question asks which proposition is most inconsistent with this argument. 

To analyze the options:

- **Option A**: Suggests power is based on individual strength, not gender. This contradicts MacKinnon's gender-based power argument but does not directly address the systemic power imbalance she emphasizes.
- **Option B**: Proposes redefining "woman," which could align with MacKinnon's critique of societal constructs and is not inconsistent.
- **Option C**: Claims women inherently possess more power than men. This is a direct contradiction of MacKinnon's argument that men dominate, but it focuses on inherent power rather than systemic structures.
- **Option D**: States that gender-based inequality is a myth. This directly opposes MacKinnon's assertion that inequality exists and is systemic.
- **Option E**: Asserts that men and women share equal power in society. This directly contradicts MacKinnon's argument about male dominance and the power imbalance, making it highly inconsistent.
- **Option F**: Suggests equality is impossible because men define women as different. This could align with MacKinnon's views on systemic oppression and is not inconsistent.
- **Option G**: Proposes that women can achieve equality through political pressure. This might align with MacKinnon's belief in the need for systemic change and is not inconsistent.
- **Option H**: Claims men and women are inherently equal in all aspects. While this focuses on inherent equality, MacKinnon's argument is about systemic inequality, so this is less directly inconsistent.
- **Option I**: Suggests power is subjective and varies individually. This downplays systemic power dynamics, making it inconsistent but less directly than others.
- **Option J**: States the world is phallocentric and oppressive, which aligns with MacKinnon's views and is not inconsistent.

The most inconsistent proposition is **Option E**, as it directly contradicts MacKinnon's argument about the power imbalance by asserting that men and women share equal power in society. This opposition is more direct and relevant to her focus on systemic power dynamics than other options.

Answer: E
