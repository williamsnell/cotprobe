Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychology, specifically related to personality traits and their effects later in life. The question is asking about what an increase in neuroticism later in life predicts. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different outcome.

First, I need to understand what neuroticism is. From what I remember, neuroticism is one of the Big Five personality traits. It's characterized by feelings of anxiety, anger, envy, depression, and vulnerability. People high in neuroticism are more sensitive to stress and prone to negative emotions.

The question is about an increase in neuroticism later in life. So, if someone becomes more neurotic as they age, what does that predict? I know that higher levels of neuroticism are generally linked to worse mental health outcomes, like depression and anxiety disorders. But how does that translate to other areas like mortality, social support, or cognitive functions?

Looking at the options:

A: Decreased stress levels. That doesn't make sense because neuroticism is associated with increased stress sensitivity, so stress would likely increase, not decrease.

B: Increased social activity. I don't think so. Neuroticism might lead to social withdrawal because people might avoid social interactions if they're anxious or depressed.

C: Mortality. There's some research linking higher neuroticism to various health issues, possibly leading to higher mortality rates. Stress and anxiety can have physical effects, so this could be a possibility.

D: Independence. Probably not. Neuroticism might lead to more dependence, as individuals might struggle with coping mechanisms.

E: Increase in creativity. I'm not sure about this. I don't recall a direct link between neuroticism and creativity, though some studies suggest that certain traits might correlate, but it's not a strong predictor here.

F: Cognitive decline. Maybe. Stress and negative emotions can impact cognitive functions, so this is a possibility. But I'm not certain if it's the strongest link.

G: Better decision making. Unlikely, since higher neuroticism might impair decision-making due to increased anxiety and emotional instability.

H: Loss of social support. This seems plausible. If someone becomes more neurotic, they might have more interpersonal issues, leading others to withdraw support.

I: Improved memory. That doesn't fit. High neuroticism is more likely to be linked to cognitive issues rather than improvements.

J: Physical strength. Not really related. Neuroticism is more about emotional states than physical capabilities.

Now, trying to weigh the options. I think both C (mortality) and H (loss of social support) are strong candidates. Also, F (cognitive decline) could be related, but I'm not as sure about that.

I remember reading that high neuroticism is associated with worse health outcomes, including higher mortality. This could be because chronic stress from neuroticism can affect the immune system and cardiovascular health. So option C is a strong contender.

Option H, loss of social support, also makes sense because people high in neuroticism may have more conflicts or be less pleasant to be around, causing others to pull away. But is this a stronger predictor than mortality? I'm not sure.

Another point to consider: the question says it's a "strong predictor." I think the link between neuroticism and mortality is well-established in psychological research. For example, studies have shown that higher neuroticism is associated with increased risk of death, possibly due to factors like poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol) and the physiological effects of chronic stress.

So, putting it together, the answer is likely C: Mortality.

The question asks about the strong predictor of an increase in neuroticism later in life. Neuroticism, a Big Five personality trait, is characterized by anxiety, vulnerability, and sensitivity to stress. Higher levels of neuroticism are linked to negative mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety, and can impact physical health and social interactions.

Analyzing the options:

- **A (Decreased stress levels):** Incorrect, as neuroticism increases stress sensitivity.
- **B (Increased social activity):** Unlikely, as neuroticism may lead to social withdrawal.
- **C (Mortality):** Plausible, as chronic stress and health issues linked to neuroticism can increase mortality risk.
- **D (Independence):** Unlikely, as neuroticism may lead to dependence.
- **E (Increase in creativity):** No strong evidence supports this link.
- **F (Cognitive decline):** Possible, but less certain compared to mortality.
- **G (Better decision making):** Unlikely, as anxiety impairs decision-making.
- **H (Loss of social support):** Possible, as neuroticism can strain relationships.
- **I (Improved memory):** Unlikely, as neuroticism is linked to cognitive issues.
- **J (Physical strength):** Unrelated to neuroticism.

The strongest predictor is **C (Mortality)**, supported by research linking neuroticism to higher mortality due to chronic stress and poor health behaviors.

Answer: C
