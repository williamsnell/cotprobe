To solve the problem of writing \(1 \frac{1}{11}\) as a whole number or mixed number in simplest form, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Mixed Number**: The expression \(1 \frac{1}{11}\) represents a whole number (1) combined with a fractional part (\(\frac{1}{11}\)).

2. **Convert to an Improper Fraction**:
   - Multiply the whole number (1) by the denominator of the fractional part (11): \(1 \times 11 = 11\).
   - Add the numerator of the fractional part (1) to this product: \(11 + 1 = 12\).
   - Place this sum over the original denominator (11): \(\frac{12}{11}\).

3. **Simplify if Possible**: The fraction \(\frac{12}{11}\) cannot be simplified further because 12 and 11 share no common divisors other than 1.

4. **Express as a Mixed Number**: If desired, \(\frac{12}{11}\) can be expressed as a mixed number:
   - Divide the numerator (12) by the denominator (11): \(12 \div 11 = 1\) with a remainder of 1.
   - The mixed number is \(1 \frac{1}{11}\).

5. **Compare with the Options**: Among the given options, the correct representation of \(1 \frac{1}{11}\) in simplest form is **H: 12 over 11**.

Answer: H
