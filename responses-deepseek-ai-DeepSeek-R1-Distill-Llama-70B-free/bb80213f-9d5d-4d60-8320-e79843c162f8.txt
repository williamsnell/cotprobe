Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron moving between two charged plates. Hmm, let me read it again. The setup is that there's a uniform electric field between two oppositely charged plates. An electron is released from rest at the surface of the negatively charged plate and then it hits the opposite plate. The distance between the plates is 2.0 cm, and the time it takes is 1.5e-8 seconds. The question is asking for the speed of the electron when it strikes the second plate.

Wait, so the electron starts from rest and moves because of the electric field. Since the plates are oppositely charged, the electric field must be directing the electron towards the positively charged plate. Because electrons are negatively charged, the electric force will push them towards the positive plate.

I remember that in a uniform electric field, the force on the electron is F = eE, where e is the elementary charge. This force will cause the electron to accelerate. So the acceleration a is F/m, where m is the mass of the electron. Oh right, since F = ma, so a = (eE)/(m_e).

But wait, I don't know the electric field E here. Hmm. Maybe I don't need to find E directly. Let's think about the motion. The electron starts from rest, so initial velocity u = 0. It travels a distance d in time t, and I need to find the final velocity v.

I remember the kinematic equations. One of them is s = ut + (1/2) a t². Since u is zero, this simplifies to s = (1/2) a t². So I can solve for the acceleration a.

Wait, but I don't know a yet. Or do I? Because a is (eE)/(m_e), but I still don't know E. But maybe I can find another equation involving E and a.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the final velocity using another kinematic equation. Like v = u + a t. Since u is zero, v = a t. If I can find a, then I can find v.

So with s = 0.5 a t², I can solve for a. Let me plug in the numbers. s is 2.0 cm which is 0.02 meters. t is 1.5e-8 seconds.

So s = (1/2) a t² → a = (2 s)/(t²). Let me compute that.

s = 0.02 m, t = 1.5e-8 s.

a = (2 * 0.02) / ( (1.5e-8)^2 )

Calculating denominator: (1.5e-8)^2 = 2.25e-16.

So numerator: 0.04.

a = 0.04 / 2.25e-16

Let me compute that. 0.04 / 2.25e-16 = (4e-2) / (2.25e-16) = (4/(2.25))e( -2 +16 ) = (1.777...)e14 m/s².

Wait, that's a huge acceleration. I think that's correct because electric fields can cause strong accelerations on electrons.

Now, once I have a, I can find v using v = a t.

So v = a * t = (1.777e14 m/s²) * (1.5e-8 s) = 1.777e14 * 1.5e-8.

Multiplying the numbers: 1.777 *1.5 ≈ 2.666, and exponents: 1e14 *1e-8=1e6.

So v ≈ 2.666e6 m/s.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 3.2e6 m/s.

Option D is 2.2e6.

Option G is 2.0e6.

Hmm, 2.666e6 is approximately 2.67e6. So the closest option is I think option I is 2.7e6, but wait looking back at the options.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 3.0e6

B: 1.5e6

C: 3.2e6

D: 2.2e6

E:1.3e6

F:1.8e6

G:2.0e6

H:2.5e6

I:2.7e6

J:3.5e6

So option I is 2.7e6, which is pretty close to my calculated 2.67e6.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake with exponents.

Wait, let me compute a more precisely. Let's compute a = (2s)/(t²).

s = 0.02 m.

t = 1.5e-8 s.

t squared is (1.5)^2 * 1e-16 → 2.25e-16.

So a = (2 * 0.02) / (2.25e-16) → (0.04) / 2.25e-16 = 0.04/(2.25e-16) = 0.017777... / 1e-16 → 1.77777e14 m/s².

Yes, then a is 1.777e14 m/s².

v = a * t = 1.777e14 * 1.5e-8 = (1.777 *1.5) * 1e6.

1.777 * 1.5 = 2.6655 ≈ 2.666e6 m/s.

So v is approximately 2.666e6 m/s, which is about 2.67e6 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 2.7e6 m/s.

Wait, but wait another thought. Oh man, did I mix up the acceleration and velocity correctly?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the equation of motion considering the electric field.

The electric field E is the force per unit charge, so E = F/e. But F = ma, so E = (ma)/e.

So E = (m a)/e.

But from kinematics, a = 2s/(t²), as I found before.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find E from the time taken.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Let me think if there's another way.

Alternatively, I can calculate the speed using the average velocity.

The electron starts at rest and ends with velocity v. The average velocity is (u + v)/2 = v/2.

Distance is average velocity multiplied by time: s = (v/2) * t → v = 2s/t.

Oh wait, that's a different approach. Let me try that.

s = 0.02 m, t = 1.5e-8 s.

v = (2 * 0.02) / (1.5e-8) = 0.04 / 1.5e-8 = (0.04)/(1.5) * 1e8.

0.04 /1.5 is 0.026666..., so 0.026666... * 1e8 = 2.666e6 m/s.

Same result as before. So I'm confident that's correct.

So the speed is 2.67e6 m/s, which is closest to option I (2.7e6). But let me check the options again.

Wait, option I says 2.7e6, which is exactly 2.7 million. My calculation is about 2.666, which is 2.67 million. So the closest is option I.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure I didn't make any error in the calculation. Let me compute 0.04/(1.5e-8) again.

Wait, 0.04 is 4e-2. So 4e-2 / 1.5e-8 = (4/1.5) * 1e( -2 +8 ) = 2.666... * 1e6 = 2.666e6.

Yes, so 2.666e6 m/s.

Looking back at the options, option I is 2.7e6, which is right. But wait, let me check if any other option is closer.

Wait, option D is 2.2e6, which is 0.46e6 less. Option H is 2.5e6, which is 0.166e6 less than 2.666e6. Option I is 2.7, which is 0.033e6 higher. So option I is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again about what the problem is asking.

Wait, the distance is 2.0 cm, which is 0.02 m, correct. The time is 1.5e-8 seconds.

Wait another thing: the electric field direction. The electron is moving from the negative to the positive plate. The electric field E is pointing from positive to negative? Or the other way around?

Wait, the electric field points away from positive and towards negative. So between two oppositely charged plates, the field would go from positive to negative plate. So the force on the electron would be opposite the field direction, because electron is negative.

Wait, but in any case, the magnitude of the acceleration would be eE/m. But since I'm solving for speed, signs don't matter here, just magnitude.

Wait, but in the problem, the speed is asked, so it's a scalar quantity.

So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps an alternative approach using energy.

The electric potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The work done by the electric field is q E d, where d is the distance between the plates. For the electron, q is -e.

So the work done is W = q E d = (-e) E (0.02 m). This work equals the kinetic energy gained.

Kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

So setting them equal: (-e) E (0.02) = (1/2) m_e v².

But without knowing E, this approach seems to require more steps. Whereas the earlier kinematic approach gives the answer directly.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 2.67e6 m/s, so the closest option is I: 2.7e6 m/s.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Is there any option that exactly matches 2.67e6? No, the options go up in increments of 0.2 or 0.3. So option I is the closest.

To determine the speed of the electron as it strikes the second plate, we analyze the motion using kinematic equations. The electron starts from rest, so its initial velocity \( u = 0 \). The distance traveled is \( s = 2.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.02 \, \text{m} \), and the time taken is \( t = 1.5 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).

Using the kinematic equation for distance under constant acceleration:

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Since \( u = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Rearranging for acceleration \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{2s}{t^2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
a = \frac{2 \cdot 0.02}{(1.5 \times 10^{-8})^2} = \frac{0.04}{2.25 \times 10^{-16}} = 1.777 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Next, using the equation for final velocity \( v \):

\[
v = u + at
\]

Since \( u = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
v = at
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
v = (1.777 \times 10^{14}) \cdot (1.5 \times 10^{-8}) = 2.666 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the speed of the electron as it strikes the second plate is approximately \( 2.67 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \). Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is:

**I: \( 2.7 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \)**.
