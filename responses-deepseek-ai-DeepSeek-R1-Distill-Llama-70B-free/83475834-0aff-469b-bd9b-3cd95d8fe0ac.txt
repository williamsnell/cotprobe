Okay, so I have a rocket problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that rockets involve some equations from physics, probably related to motion and propulsion.

The question gives me several parameters:

- Initial mass (m_initial) is 2 × 10^4 kg. That's 20,000 kg.
- Mass ratio is 3. Wait, what's the mass ratio? Oh right, mass ratio (MR) is the ratio of the initial mass to the final mass. So MR = m_initial / m_final. So if MR is 3, then m_final would be m_initial / 3. Let me calculate that. 20,000 / 3 is approximately 6,666.67 kg. So the final mass is about 6,666.67 kg.

- Burning rate is 100 kg/sec. Burning rate is the rate at which the fuel is consumed, so that's dm/dt, right? So dm/dt = 100 kg/s, but wait, I think in the rocket equation it's the mass flow rate, which is the same as the burning rate here.

- Exhaust velocity (v_e) is 980 m/s. Exhaust velocity is a key parameter in the rocket equation.

The question is asking how long after ignition the rocket will leave the ground. Oh, wait, wait. I think this is about the burn time, the time the engine is firing until the fuel runs out. Because the rocket can't leave the ground until the thrust is greater than the weight. But wait, if the engine is burning, then it's producing thrust. So maybe the question is simply asking for the burn time, the time until the fuel is exhausted.

Wait, no, the rocket is fired from the ground. So maybe it's about when lift-off happens. Wait, but lift-off occurs when the thrust exceeds the weight. So perhaps the rocket begins to move upward when the engine's thrust is greater than the rocket's weight.

But wait, the problem is phrased as "how long after ignition... will the rocket leave the ground?" So maybe it's the time until the rocket starts moving, which would be when the thrust equals the weight. Or perhaps the time until the rocket has enough thrust to overcome gravity. Or maybe it's the burn time, the time until all the fuel is burned.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The rocket's engine is ignited, and it starts burning fuel. The thrust is calculated as (mass flow rate) * (exhaust velocity) + (pressure term, but if we're assuming it's fired in atmosphere and the pressure is same, maybe it's negligible). So the basic thrust equation is F = v_e * dm/dt. But I think at the initial moment, when the rocket is on the launchpad, the thrust must overcome the weight.

Wait, but the problem says the rocket is fired vertically. So when the engine is ignited, it starts producing thrust. But the rocket needs to have enough thrust to lift off. So if the thrust is greater than the initial weight, it'll start moving upward immediately. Wait, but the problem doesn't state any external forces except gravity. So let me think: the thrust at any time is F = v_e * (dm/dt). The weight is m(t) * g, where m(t) is the mass of the rocket at time t.

So the rocket will leave the ground when F > m(t) * g. So I need to find when the thrust (which is constant during burning, since dm/dt is given as 100 kg/s and v_e is 980 m/s, which is constant) is greater than the weight.

Wait, wait, the thrust F is v_e * dm/dt. So F = 980 m/s * 100 kg/s = 98,000 N. Because dm/dt is 100 kg/s, which is the mass flow rate. So F is 98,000 N.

The initial weight is m_initial * g. m_initial is 20,000 kg. So initial weight is 20,000 * 9.8 = 196,000 N. So thrust is 98,000 N, which is less than the initial weight. So the rocket can't lift off immediately. So the rocket will start to ascend when its mass decreases enough that m(t)*g <= F.

So the condition for lift-off is when m(t) <= F / g.

Wait, let's compute F first. F = 98,000 N. So F/g is 98,000 / 9.8 = 10,000 kg. So when the mass of the rocket is 10,000 kg or less, the thrust will be sufficient to lift it.

Wait, but the initial mass is 20,000 kg. So the mass decreases as fuel is burned. The mass at any time t is m(t) = m_initial - (dm/dt)*t. Because dm/dt is the burning rate, which is 100 kg/s. So m(t) = 20000 - 100t.

We need m(t) <= 10000 kg. So set m(t) = 10000 = 20000 - 100t. Solving for t:

100t = 20000 - 10000 → 100t = 10,000 → t = 100 seconds.

So after 100 seconds, the mass is 10,000 kg, at which point the thrust equals the weight. So the rocket will start to leave the ground at that point.

Wait, but wait. The question is how long after ignition will the rocket leave the ground. So the time taken is 100 seconds. So the correct answer would be option C: 100 sec.

But let me double-check. Wait, the mass ratio is 3, which is m_initial/m_final. So m_final is 20000/3 ≈ 6666.67 kg. So the total fuel burned is 20000 - 6666.67 = 13333.33 kg. The burning rate is 100 kg/s, so total burn time is 13333.33 / 100 = 133.33 seconds. So the rocket will burn for approximately 133 seconds before fuel runs out. But the question is about when it leaves the ground, which is when F > m(t) g. That happens at 100 seconds, which is before the fuel is exhausted. So the rocket leaves the ground at 100 seconds, which is option C.

Wait, but some sources say that the time to leave the ground is when the rocket can start moving, which is when the net force becomes positive. That would be when F = v_e * (dm/dt) > m(t) g. So solving for t when 980*100 = (20000 - 100t)*9.8.

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So t = 100 seconds. So the correct answer is C.

To determine how long after ignition the rocket will leave the ground, we analyze the conditions under which the rocket can lift off. The rocket will leave the ground when the thrust produced by the engines exceeds the rocket's weight. The thrust is constant during firing and is given by:

\[
F = v_e \cdot \dot{m}
\]

where \(v_e = 980 \, \text{m/s}\) is the exhaust velocity and \(\dot{m} = 100 \, \text{kg/s}\) is the burning rate. Substituting these values:

\[
F = 980 \cdot 100 = 98,000 \, \text{N}
\]

The weight of the rocket at any time \(t\) is given by:

\[
W(t) = m(t) \cdot g
\]

where \(m(t)\) is the mass of the rocket at time \(t\) and \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) is the acceleration due to gravity. The mass decreases over time as fuel is burned:

\[
m(t) = m_{\text{initial}} - \dot{m} \cdot t
\]

where \(m_{\text{initial}} = 20,000 \, \text{kg}\). Substituting this into the weight equation:

\[
W(t) = (20,000 - 100t) \cdot 9.8
\]

The rocket will leave the ground when \(F > W(t)\). Setting \(F = W(t)\) to find the exact time when lift-off begins:

\[
98,000 = (20,000 - 100t) \cdot 9.8
\]

Dividing through by \(9.8\):

\[
10,000 = 20,000 - 100t
\]

Rearranging for \(t\):

\[
100t = 20,000 - 10,000
\]

\[
t = 100 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Thus, the rocket will leave the ground 100 seconds after ignition. This is earlier than the total burn time, which is determined by the total fuel mass divided by the burning rate. The total fuel mass is:

\[
m_{\text{fuel}} = m_{\text{initial}} - m_{\text{final}}
\]

where \(m_{\text{final}} = \frac{m_{\text{initial}}}{\text{mass ratio}} = \frac{20,000}{3} \approx 6,666.67 \, \text{kg}\). Therefore:

\[
m_{\text{fuel}} = 20,000 - 6,666.67 = 13,333.33 \, \text{kg}
\]

The total burn time is:

\[
t_{\text{burn}} = \frac{m_{\text{fuel}}}{\dot{m}} = \frac{13,333.33}{100} \approx 133.33 \, \text{seconds}
\]

However, the question specifically asks for the time when the rocket leaves the ground, which occurs at \(t = 100 \, \text{seconds}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 100 sec**
