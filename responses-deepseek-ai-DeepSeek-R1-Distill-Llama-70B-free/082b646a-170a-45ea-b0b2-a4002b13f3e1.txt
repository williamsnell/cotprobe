Okay, so I've got this question about branched chain amino acids and what happens to the ammonia when they're deaminated in muscle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Wait, branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are leucine, isoleucine, and valine, right? And I remember that they're metabolized primarily in the muscle, not the liver. Deamination means removing an amino group. So when BCAAs undergo deamination, ammonia is produced as a byproduct.

Now, what happens to that ammonia? I think the body has ways to handle excess ammonia because it's toxic. In the liver, ammonia is usually converted into urea through the urea cycle, but the question is about muscle, so maybe it's different there.

Wait, the muscle doesn't have the full urea cycle enzymes, I believe. So they can't convert ammonia into urea. So the muscle must have another way to deal with the ammonia. Oh right, I think they might convert it into other amino acids or something that can be transported elsewhere.

I remember something about alanine. Oh yes, in muscle cells, when amino acids are broken down, the ammonia can be transferred to pyruvate to form alanine via transamination. Alanine is then transported to the liver. In the liver, it can be converted into glucose (via gluconeogenesis) or urea.

Alternatively, I think glutamine might also be involved. Glutamine synthetase in the muscle can combine glutamate with ammonia to form glutamine. So both alanine and glutamine are possibilities.

Looking at the options, option D says "converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle." That sounds right because both are ways muscle cells handle ammonia.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option A mentions citrulline. I think citrulline is part of the urea cycle, but that's in the liver, not muscle. Option B is urea, but muscle can't make urea. Option C is purines and pyrimidines, but that's more about nucleotide synthesis, which I don't think is directly related. Option D seems correct. Option E is glycine, which I don't think is the main pathway. Option F is arginine, which again is part of the urea cycle, probably in the liver. G is creatine, which is related to energy storage, not ammonia. H is fatty acids, no connection. I is aspartic acid, maybe but not the main. J is proteins, but that's synthesis, not ammonia handling.

When branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine are deaminated in muscle, ammonia is produced as a byproduct. Unlike the liver, muscle cells lack the full urea cycle enzymes to convert ammonia into urea. Instead, muscle cells handle ammonia by converting it into other compounds that can be safely released and processed elsewhere.

One key pathway involves the synthesis of alanine. Through transamination, ammonia is transferred to pyruvate, forming alanine. This alanine is then transported to the liver, where it can be used for gluconeogenesis or further processed into urea. Another pathway involves the synthesis of glutamine, where glutamine synthetase combines glutamate with ammonia to form glutamine, which is also released from the muscle.

Among the given options, the correct answer is that ammonia is mostly converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle. Other options, such as citrulline, urea, or arginine, are not relevant to ammonia metabolism in muscle, as these processes primarily occur in the liver. Similarly, options involving purines, pyrimidines, glycine, aspartic acid, fatty acids, proteins, or creatine are not directly related to the handling of ammonia in this context.
