Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about a firm that produces three products, A, B, and C. Each product has its own total cost function, and I need to figure out whether each product's productivity is constant, increasing, or decreasing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that in economics, productivity trends relate to how costs change as output increases. So, when we talk about increasing or decreasing productivity, it's really about the cost structure as production scales up.

The total cost function for each product is given. Let's write them down:

- Product A: Total Cost (TC) = $56 + 2X
- Product B: TC = $56 + 2X + 4X²
- Product C: TC = $56 + 2X - 4X²

Wait, but wait—the user wrote that Product C's equation is "$56 + 2X -4X^2 4X^2". That seems like a typo. Oh, maybe it's a mistake, perhaps it should be "-4X²" without the extra "4X²" at the end. I'll proceed under that assumption, so Product C is $56 + 2X - 4X².

Now, productivity is related to marginal cost and how it behaves as output increases. Marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost with respect to X. So I need to find the marginal cost (MC) for each product and see if it's increasing, decreasing, or constant.

Starting with Product A. The total cost is a linear function, 56 + 2X. The derivative of this is just 2, because the derivative of X is 1, multiplied by 2. So MC for A is 2, which is constant. That means as X increases, the marginal cost doesn't change. So Product A has constant productivity. Wait, but wait—am I confusing terms here? Because in production theory, increasing or decreasing returns are about how marginal product behaves, but here it's about the cost.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of cost curves. So, if the marginal cost is increasing, decreasing, or constant, that relates to whether the firm is experiencing increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

In production, when marginal cost decreases as output increases, the firm is experiencing increasing returns to scale (or increasing productivity), because each additional unit is cheaper to produce. When marginal cost increases with output, the firm is experiencing decreasing returns to scale (or decreasing productivity). If marginal cost is constant, then productivity is constant.

So, for each product, I'll compute the marginal cost function and see if it's increasing, decreasing, or constant as X increases.

Product A's MC is 2, which is constant. So Product A's productivity is constant.

Product B's TC is 56 + 2X + 4X². The derivative of this is 2 + 8X. So MC = 2 + 8X. As X increases, MC increases because 8X is positive and grows with X. So marginal cost is rising. So Product B has increasing marginal cost, which implies decreasing returns to scale, so productivity is decreasing? Wait no—if MC is increasing, that would mean each additional unit is more costly. So that suggests that the firm is experiencing decreasing productivity as more is produced. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, in terms of returns to scale, if marginal cost is increasing, that's a sign of decreasing returns to scale. Because as you produce more, each additional unit adds more to cost than the previous. So, Product B's marginal cost is increasing, so productivity is decreasing.

Wait, but wait, the question is about whether productivity is constant, increasing, or decreasing. So, increasing productivity would mean that marginal cost is decreasing as X increases. If marginal cost is increasing, then productivity is decreasing.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Let me correct this. Productivity is about output per unit input. If you have increasing returns, output increases more than proportionally with inputs. So, when marginal cost is decreasing (as X increases), that would mean each additional unit adds less cost, implying higher productivity. So, if MC is decreasing, productivity is increasing.

So, Product B's MC is 2 + 8X. As X increases, MC increases. So, each additional unit costs more to produce. So, this would imply decreasing productivity. So Product B's productivity is decreasing.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me think about this again. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. If MC is rising as X increases, that suggests that it's becoming harder or more expensive to produce each additional unit. So that's a sign of decreasing returns to scale, which in terms of productivity would mean decreasing productivity.

Wait, but some sources might frame it differently. Let me double-check the definitions.

In economics, when a firm's marginal cost increases as output increases, it's a sign of decreasing returns to scale. So, the more you produce, the higher the cost per additional unit, which implies that each additional unit is contributing less to total output relative to previous units. So yes, Product B has increasing MC, so productivity is decreasing.

Now Product C's total cost is $56 + 2X -4X². Taking the derivative, the MC is 2 - 8X.

So, as X increases, what happens to MC? Let's see: when X is low, say X=1, MC is 2-8(1)= -6. That doesn't make much sense because marginal cost can't be negative. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps X is in a range where MC is positive. Wait, maybe the model is only valid for X up to a certain point. Let's ignore that issue for now.

The derivative is 2 - 8X. So as X increases, MC decreases. Because each additional unit of X makes MC smaller. For example, at X=0, MC is 2. At X=1, MC is -6 (but that's negative, which is odd). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the behavior in the region where X is positive and where MC is positive. Let's set MC =0: 2 -8X =0 → X=2/8=0.25. So for X<0.25, MC is positive, and for X>0.25, MC becomes negative, which is impossible. So in reality, the model is only valid up to X=0.25, beyond which the firm wouldn't produce more because MC becomes negative, implying that selling more units would actually reduce total cost, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the cost function is only applicable for X up to 0.25. But that's a very low number of units, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the Product C's cost function was intended to be a quadratic with a negative coefficient on X², so it's a concave function. So, the MC starts at 2 when X=0 and decreases as X increases. Wait, but in the valid range, for X up to 0.25, MC is positive and decreasing. So in that range, as X increases, MC decreases. So, that implies that the firm is experiencing increasing returns to scale, meaning productivity is increasing because each additional unit is cheaper than the last. Wait, but only up to a point. Beyond that, MC becomes negative, which doesn't make sense, so maybe the function is only defined where X is less than 0.25.

So, Product C's productivity is increasing because MC is decreasing as X increases.

Wait, but that's confusing. Let me try to summarize each product:

Product A: MC is constant at 2. So productivity is constant.

Product B: MC is 2 + 8X, which increases with X. So productivity is decreasing.

Product C: MC is 2 -8X, which decreases as X increases, implying productivity is increasing.

Wait, but the options will have to match this.

Wait, the options are about each product's productivity: A, B, C.

So, for Product A, productivity is constant.

Product B's productivity is decreasing.

Product C's productivity is increasing.

So, looking at the options:

Looking at the options:

Option H: Product A: constant, Product B: increasing, Product C: decreasing. No, that's not what we have here.

Option G: Product A: constant, Product B: decreasing, Product C: increasing. Yes, that's what we have.

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the options are presented as A, B, C, D,..., J.

Looking for the option where:

Product A: constant.

Product B: decreasing.

Product C: increasing.

Looking at the options:

Option G: Product A: constant, Product B: decreasing, Product C: increasing.

Yes, that's option G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up B and C.

Wait, Product B has increasing MC (so decreasing productivity), Product C has decreasing MC (so increasing productivity).

So, the correct option would be: A: constant, B: decreasing, C: increasing.

Which is option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: A: decreasing, B: increasing, C: constant.

B: A: increasing, B: constant, C: decreasing.

C: A: increasing, B: decreasing, C: constant.

D: A: decreasing, B: decreasing, C: constant.

E: A: constant, B: constant, C: decreasing.

F: A: increasing, B: increasing, C: decreasing.

G: A: constant, B: decreasing, C: increasing.

H: A: constant, B: increasing, C: decreasing.

I: A: decreasing, B: increasing, C: increasing.

J: A: decreasing, B: constant, C: increasing.

Yes, option G matches what we determined: A constant, B decreasing, C increasing.

So the answer is G.
</think>

To determine whether the productivity of each product is constant, increasing, or decreasing, we analyze the total cost functions provided for Products A, B, and C. Productivity trends are inferred from the behavior of marginal cost (MC), which is the derivative of the total cost function with respect to the number of units produced (\(X\)).

### Product A: Total Cost = $56 + 2X
- The total cost function is linear, and the derivative (marginal cost) is constant:  
  \[
  MC = \frac{d(\text{Total Cost})}{dX} = 2
  \]
- Since marginal cost is constant as \(X\) increases, Product A experiences **constant productivity**.

### Product B: Total Cost = $56 + 2X + 4X^2
- The total cost function is quadratic, and the derivative (marginal cost) is:  
  \[
  MC = \frac{d(\text{Total Cost})}{dX} = 2 + 8X
  \]
- As \(X\) increases, \(MC\) increases because the term \(8X\) grows. This indicates that the cost of producing additional units rises, implying **decreasing productivity**.

### Product C: Total Cost = $56 + 2X - 4X^2
- The total cost function is quadratic with a negative coefficient on \(X^2\), and the derivative (marginal cost) is:  
  \[
  MC = \frac{d(\text{Total Cost})}{dX} = 2 - 8X
  \]
- As \(X\) increases, \(MC\) decreases because the term \(-8X\) reduces the marginal cost. This indicates that the cost of producing additional units falls, implying **increasing productivity**.

### Summary of Results:
- **Product A**: Constant productivity.
- **Product B**: Decreasing productivity.
- **Product C**: Increasing productivity.

### Matching with Options:
The correct option is **G**, which states:  
- Product A: constant, Product B: decreasing, Product C: increasing.
