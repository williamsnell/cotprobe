Question:

Describe the development of seed.

Options:

A: The seed evolves from the transformation of the flower's nectar, which solidifies and encases the embryo
B: The seed is formed from the stamens
C: The seed is a combination of multiple petals that harden over time after the flower has been pollinated
D: The seed develops from the petals and sepals
E: The ovule with its contained embryo and endosperm becomes the seed; its wall, or integument, thickens to form the tough outer covering of the seed.
F: Seeds are formed directly from the pollen grains that land on the stigma of the flower
G: The seed develops from the accumulation of nutrients in the pistil without fertilization
H: The seed is a result of the withering and falling off of the stigma and style after fertilization
I: The seed is produced from the calyx, which encloses the rest of the flower and eventually forms the seed coat
J: The seed originates from the fusion of two ovules within the flower after pollination

Okay, so I've got this question about the development of seeds, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about plant reproduction.

Seeds come from flowers, right? Flowers have different parts, like petals, sepals, stamens, and pistils. The pistil is the female part, which has the stigma, style, and ovary. The stamens are the male parts, with anthers that produce pollen.

When pollination happens, pollen lands on the stigma. Then, the pollen germinates, sending a pollen tube down through the style to the ovary. Inside the ovary, there are ovules. Fertilization occurs when the sperm from the pollen meets the egg in the ovule, resulting in a zygote. 

After fertilization, the ovary starts to develop into a fruit, and each ovule becomes a seed. The ovule has an embryo, which is the developing plant, and the endosperm, which provides nutrients. The outer layer of the ovule, called the integument, becomes the seed coat or testa, which is the hard outer covering of the seed.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says the seed comes from nectar. That doesn't sound right because nectar is related to attracting pollinators, not seed development.

Option B suggests seeds form from stamens. No, stamens produce pollen, but the seeds are in the pistil.

Option C says seeds are from petals hardening. I don't think so; petals are the colorful parts that attract pollinators, not involved in seed formation.

Option D mentions petals and sepals. Sepals are the green parts that protect the flower bud. Not involved in seeds.

Option E states the ovule with embryo and endosperm becomes the seed, with the integument thickening into the seed coat. This matches what I was thinking earlier. Ovule becomes seed, integument becomes the coat.

Option F says seeds come from pollen grains on the stigma. That's part of the process, but the seed is formed from the ovule, not directly from pollen.

Option G talks about nutrients in the pistil without fertilization. I don't think so; seeds develop after fertilization.

Option H says seed is from withering stigma and style. No, that's more about the flower parts after they've done their job.

Option I says calyx forms the seed coat. The calyx is the sepals, which protect the flower, not directly involved in seed coat formation.

Option J says seed from fusion of two ovules. I haven't heard that before; each ovule becomes a seed individually.

So the correct answer should be E. It correctly describes the ovule developing into a seed with the embryo, endosperm, and the integument becoming the seed coat.

The development of a seed begins with the ovule in the flower's pistil. After pollination and fertilization, the ovule transforms into a seed. The fertilized ovule contains an embryo, which is the developing plant, and endosperm, which provides nutrients. The outer layer of the ovule, known as the integument, thickens to form the tough outer covering of the seed, called the seed coat. This process accurately describes how seeds form.

The correct answer is E because it correctly identifies that the seed develops from the ovule, including the embryo and endosperm, with the integument forming the seed coat.

Answer: E
