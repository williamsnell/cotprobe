Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the transition from food gathering to relying entirely on agriculture. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the shift from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one that's based on farming. I remember that this transition is a significant event in human history, often referred to as the Neolithic Revolution. 

First, let's look at the options one by one.

Option A says it was driven solely by population growth. Wait, I'm not sure about that. I think population growth might have played a role, but was it the only reason? I recall that factors like climate change, the availability of plants and animals that could be domesticated, and maybe social factors also contributed. So maybe A is not entirely correct because it's not the sole driver.

Option B claims it only occurred in Europe and Asia. That doesn't sound right. I remember that agriculture developed independently in different parts of the world, like in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, but also in places like Mesoamerica (Mexico/Guatemala area) for maize, and in East Asia with rice. So B is incorrect because it happened in other continents too.

Option C states it took hundreds of thousands of years. That seems too long. The Neolithic Revolution, as I understand it, happened around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Hundreds of thousands would stretch it way back, which doesn't fit with what I know. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says it always required careful planning. Well, early agriculture might have been more trial and error. People probably observed plants and animals over time and gradually developed practices. But does that mean it always needed careful planning? Maybe not. Some groups might have started without much planning. So D might not be the right answer.

Option E: happened everywhere except South America. No, that's not true. South America did have agriculture, like the Inca and other civilizations growing potatoes, maize, etc. So E is incorrect.

Option F claims it wasn't possible without domesticated animals. I'm not sure. Some early farming systems might have focused on plants first, like wheat and barley, before animals were domesticated. So maybe it's possible to have agriculture without domesticated animals initially. So F is probably not correct.

Option G suggests it was a direct result of technological advancements. Technology did play a role, like the development of tools for farming. But I think it's more about the shift in subsistence strategies and perhaps environmental factors. So G might not be the main reason, making it an incorrect option.

Option H says it happened overnight. That's definitely not right. Such a massive change in how people live and obtain food would take a long time, not just a short period. So H is wrong.

Option I: only took place in societies with a written language. I don't think so. Writing came much later than the initial agricultural practices. Early farming societies didn't have writing yet, so I is incorrect.

Option J: took thousands of years. This sounds more accurate. The transition from gathering to full agriculture was a gradual process that spanned many generations. It wasn't something that happened quickly but over millennia. So J seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. The Neolithic Revolution is believed to have started around 10,000 years ago, but the process of transitioning from a nomadic to an agricultural society wasn't instantaneous. It took time for people to domesticate plants and animals, develop tools, and adjust their social structures. So yes, it took thousands of years, which aligns with option J.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be J.

The transition from food gathering to a reliance on agriculture, known as the Neolithic Revolution, was a gradual process that occurred independently in various parts of the world, including the Fertile Crescent, Mesoamerica, and East Asia. This shift was not solely driven by population growth, nor was it limited to Europe and Asia. It took thousands of years, as people gradually domesticated plants and animals, developed farming tools, and adapted their social structures. The process was not instantaneous but unfolded over millennia.

A: Incorrect. Population growth was a factor but not the sole driver.  
B: Incorrect. Agriculture developed in multiple regions beyond Europe and Asia.  
C: Incorrect. The transition took thousands of years, not hundreds of thousands.  
D: Incorrect. Early agriculture likely involved trial and error rather than always requiring careful planning.  
E: Incorrect. South America had its own agricultural developments.  
F: Incorrect. Early agriculture could focus on plants before domesticating animals.  
G: Incorrect. While technology played a role, it was not the sole driver.  
H: Incorrect. The transition was gradual, not instantaneous.  
I: Incorrect. Writing emerged later than the initial agricultural practices.  
J: Correct. The transition took thousands of years.
