Okay, so I've got this calculus problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem says:

For p(x) = f(x)g(x), if f(2)=3, f'(2)=-4, g(2)=1, and g'(2)=6, what is p'(2)?

Hmm, right. So p(x) is the product of two functions f and g. I remember that when you have a product of two functions, you need to use the product rule to find the derivative. The product rule, if I recall correctly, says that the derivative p'(x) is f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x). Oh wait, yeah, that's right. So when evaluating at a specific point, like x=2, I just plug in those values.

Okay, let's break this down. I need to find p'(2). According to the product rule, that's f'(2)*g(2) plus f(2)*g'(2). So I can substitute the given values here.

Wait, let me make sure I have all the given data correct. So f at 2 is 3, f' at 2 is -4. g at 2 is 1, and g' at 2 is 6. Got it.

So plugging these into the product rule formula: p'(2) = (f'(2) * g(2)) + (f(2) * g'(2)). Substituting the numbers, that's (-4 * 1) + (3 * 6). Let's compute that.

First part: -4 * 1 is -4. Second part: 3 * 6 is 18. Adding them together: -4 + 18 equals 14. So p'(2) should be 14.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. So f(2)=3, correct. f'(2)=-4, yes. g(2)=1, right, and g'(2)=6, yes. So the terms are -4*1 = -4 and 3*6=18. Adding them gives 14. That seems correct.

Oh, wait, looking at the options, E is 14. So the answer should be E.

I think that's all there is to it. The product rule applied to the given functions at x=2 gives 14 as the derivative.

To determine \( p'(2) \) for \( p(x) = f(x)g(x) \), we apply the product rule, which states:

\[
p'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x).
\]

Substituting the given values at \( x = 2 \):

- \( f(2) = 3 \),
- \( f'(2) = -4 \),
- \( g(2) = 1 \),
- \( g'(2) = 6 \),

we calculate:

\[
p'(2) = f'(2)g(2) + f(2)g'(2) = (-4)(1) + (3)(6) = -4 + 18 = 14.
\]

Thus, the value of \( p'(2) \) is 14, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
