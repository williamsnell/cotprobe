Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about calculating total wealth based on expected annual income and an interest rate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that my expected annual income is $20,000, and the rate of interest is 9.8%. I need to find the total wealth from the given options. Wait, total wealth in this context... I'm trying to remember what formula to use here. Oh right, I think it's the concept of the present value of a perpetual annuity. Because when you have a steady income year after year, it's like an annuity that goes on forever.

So the formula for the present value (PV) of a perpetual annuity is PV = C / r, where C is the annual payment and r is the interest rate. Oh wait, but wait, is that right? Or is it something else. Let me double-check. Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure that's correct. So the present value is just the annual amount divided by the interest rate.

Given that, let me plug in the numbers. The annual income C is $20,000, and the interest rate r is 9.8%. So that would be 20,000 divided by 0.098. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 20,000 divided by 0.098... Let me do the division. 20,000 รท 0.098. Hmm, 0.098 is almost 0.1, right? So 20,000 divided by 0.1 is 200,000. But since 0.098 is a bit less than 0.1, the result will be a bit higher than 200,000. How much higher?

Let me compute it more accurately. 0.098 times 200,000 is 19,600. Wait, because 0.098 * 200,000 = 19,600. But we have 20,000 as the numerator. So 20,000 - 19,600 = 400 left. So 400 รท 0.098 is approximately 4081.63. So adding that to 200,000 gives 204,081.63. Hmm, that's about $204,082 when rounded.

Looking at the options, option G is $204,082. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait another way to calculate 20,000 / 0.098: Let's set it up as 20,000 รท 0.098. Let me write it as (20,000 * 100) / 98. So that's 2,000,000 / 98. Dividing 2,000,000 by 98. Let's see, 98*20,000 is 1,960,000. So subtract that from 2,000,000, which leaves 40,000. Then 40,000 /98 is approximately 408.16. So adding that to 20,000 gives 20,408.16. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, I think I messed up the decimal places.

Wait no, wait. 2,000,000 divided by 98 equals approximately 20,408.163... So that's 20,408.16, which when considering the original units would be $204,081.63, which aligns with what I had before. So yeah, about $204,082.

So looking at the options, G is $204,082. So the answer should be G.

To calculate the total wealth based on the given annual income and interest rate, we use the formula for the present value of a perpetual annuity:

\[
PV = \frac{C}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( C = \$20,000 \) (annual income)
- \( r = 9.8\% = 0.098 \) (interest rate)

Substituting the values:

\[
PV = \frac{20,000}{0.098} \approx 204,081.63
\]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the total wealth is approximately \$204,082. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: $204,082**

Answer: G
