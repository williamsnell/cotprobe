Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because exponents can be tricky sometimes. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: Which number written in exponential notation is equivalent to 343? And there are several options to choose from, labeled A to I. 

First, I remember that 343 is a number I might have encountered before in math problems. I think it's a cube of some number because 3^3 is 27, but wait, 3^3 is 27, and 343 is much bigger. Oh right, 7 times 7 is 49, and 7 times 49 is 343. So 7^3 is 343, right? Because 7*7=49, 49*7=343. Yep, that makes sense.

So now I look at the options. Option B is 7^3, which would be 343. That seems like the correct answer, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A is 7^49. That's a huge number, way bigger than 343. So no, that's not it.

Option C is 49^3. Wait, 49 is 7 squared, so 49^3 would be (7^2)^3, which is 7^(2*3) = 7^6. And 7^6 is 117649, which is way larger than 343. So C isn't correct.

Option D is 294^49. Oh wow, that's an astronomically large number. Definitely not 343, so D is out.

Option E is 49^7. Again, 49 is 7^2, so 49^7 is 7^(2*7) = 7^14. That's 678223072849, which is way bigger than 343. So E is not it.

Option F is 3^7. Let's calculate that. 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, and 3^7 is 2187. That's bigger than 343, so F isn't the right choice.

Option G is 1^343. Well, any number to any power is 1, so G is 1, which is not 343. So G is incorrect.

Option H is 7^7. Let me think, 7^3 is 343, so 7^7 is 7^(3+4) = 7^3 * 7^4. I know 7^4 is 2401, so 343 * 2401 is way larger than 343. So H isn't correct.

Option I is 3^49. That's a huge number as well. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^49 is way beyond 343. So I is not the answer.

So after checking all the options, the only one that matches 343 is option B, which is 7^3. So I think that's the correct answer.

The number 343 can be expressed in exponential notation as \(7^3\), since \(7 \times 7 \times 7 = 343\). Among the given options, only option B matches this. All other options either represent numbers far larger than 343 or are incorrect calculations. 

Answer: B
