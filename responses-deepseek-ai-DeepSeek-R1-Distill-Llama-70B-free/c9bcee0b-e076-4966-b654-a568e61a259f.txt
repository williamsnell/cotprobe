Okay, so I need to figure out what K_f is for the function f: U_5 → U_5 given by f(x) = x². Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts.

First, U_5 is the set of integers modulo 5, right? So U_5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The function f is defined as squaring each element. So f(x) = x² mod 5.

Wait, K_f... Oh, right! K_f is the kernel of the homomorphism f. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity element in the codomain. Since we're dealing with addition modulo 5, the identity element is 0. So the kernel K_f is all x in U_5 such that f(x) = 0.

So I need to find all x in U_5 where x² ≡ 0 mod 5.

Let me square each element of U_5 and see which ones give 0 mod 5.

Let's list them out:

x | x² | x² mod 5
---|-----|---
0 | 0   | 0
1 | 1   | 1
2 | 4   | 4
3 | 9   | 4 (because 9 mod5 is 4)
4 | 16  | 1 (since 16 mod5 is 1)

So looking at the results, only x=0 gives x² ≡ 0 mod5. So the kernel K_f is {0}.

Wait, but the options provided are pairs. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding K_f. Let me think again. Oh wait, the kernel in group theory is the set of elements mapping to the identity. But the options are presented as [a, b], which seems like pairs rather than sets. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the kernel in terms of the function's behavior, but I'm not sure.

Wait another thought: Maybe K_f refers to something else here, like the kernel in terms of linear algebra or another structure. But in group theory, the kernel is a subgroup. So for U_5 under addition, the kernel should be a subgroup. The subgroups of U_5 are of orders dividing 5, but 5 is prime, so the only subgroups are the trivial group and U_5 itself. Since only 0 is in the kernel, K_f is the trivial subgroup {0}.

But looking at the options, none of them show {0}. The options are pairs. Wait, perhaps the notation here is different. Maybe K_f represents the image of the kernel or something else. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the notation.

Alternatively, maybe I've misread the question. The function is f: U_5 → U_5, but perhaps it's a ring homomorphism? Because in rings, the kernel is an ideal, which could be more than just {0}.

Wait, in ring theory, the kernel of a ring homomorphism is a two-sided ideal. Since U_5 is a ring (a field, actually, since 5 is prime), the kernel would be an ideal. The only ideals in a field are {0} and the field itself. But since f is not the zero map (because f(1)=1, etc.), the kernel must be {0}.

But again, the options don't have a single element. So perhaps the question is referring to something else.

Wait, the question says f is a homomorphism. So maybe it's a group homomorphism under addition? Because in that case, the kernel is the set of elements x where f(x) = 0. As I calculated earlier, that's only 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is talking about a permutation. No, because f is a function from U_5 to itself, but squaring each element. Wait, but squaring can cause collisions, so it's not necessarily injective.

Wait, perhaps K_f is the set of elements where f(x) = x? No, that would be the fixed points, not the kernel. Or maybe it's the image of f?

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to think of f as a linear transformation, but since U_5 is a field, and f is x→x², which isn't linear. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The kernel K_f is {x | f(x) = 0}. From earlier, that's only x=0.

But the options are given as [a, b], which are two numbers. So perhaps the question is not about the kernel in the group theory sense, but in some other context. Or perhaps the question is actually about the image of the function, which is f(U_5).

Looking at the function f(x) = x² mod5, the images are 0,1,4.

Wait, but in that case, the image would be {0,1,4}, which has size 3. But the options don't have a 3. Alternatively, maybe it's the size of the kernel or the image.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the kernel of the function when considering multiplication, but that doesn't make much sense because in U_5, multiplication isn't a group for all elements (only the units form a group). So f as a multiplicative homomorphism would have kernel {1}, since f(1)=1, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the function f is a permutation, but that's not the case because f(2)=4 and f(3)=4, so it's not injective. So it's not a permutation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of elements in the kernel. But the kernel only has one element, so that would be 1. Looking at the options, option C is [4,2], which seems unrelated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what K_f refers to. Is it possible that K_f is the set of elements x where f(x) = f(y) for some y? No, that would be the relation induced by f, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the graph of the function or the image. Let me think about the image. The image of f is the set of squares in U_5.

As calculated earlier, the squares are 0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9≡4, 4²=16≡1. So the image is {0,1,4}. So the image has size 3.

But the options don't have 3. Alternatively, the kernel has size 1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kernel and the image, presented as a pair [kernel size, image size]. But the kernel size is 1, image size is 3. Looking at the options, none of them have [1,3].

Wait, the options are:

A: [1,2]
B: [2,5]
C: [4,2]
D: [5,2]
E: [3,5]
F: [0,1]
G: [3,4]
H: [4,1]
I: [1,5]
J: [2,3]

So none of these match [1,3], which would be the kernel size and image size. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the set of elements that are fixed by f, i.e., f(x) = x. Let's compute f(x) for each x and see if any satisfy x² ≡ x mod5.

So x² ≡x mod5 → x² -x ≡0 →x(x-1) ≡0 mod5.

So x ≡0 or x≡1 mod5. So the solutions are x=0 and x=1. So the set of fixed points is {0,1}.

So K_f would be {0,1}, which corresponds to [0,1], which is option F.

But wait, earlier I thought kernel is {0}, but if K_f is the set of fixed points (where f(x)=x), then it's {0,1}.

So perhaps the question is using K_f to denote the set of fixed points, not the kernel in the group theory sense. That would make sense if K_f stands for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the terminology wrong. Let me think again: in group theory, the kernel is a specific concept. If the question refers to K_f as the kernel, then it's {0}, but that's not among the options as a pair. So maybe the question is using K_f to mean something else, like the image or the set of fixed points.

Given that none of the kernel-related possibilities match the options, perhaps K_f refers to the image of f. So the image is {0,1,4}. But the options don't directly represent sets, but perhaps as [0,1,4], but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is using K_f to denote the image of the function, and the image has size 3. But again, the options don't have 3 as the second element in a pair except for E: [3,5], which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the number of elements in the kernel and the image. Kernel size is 1, image size is 3. But the options don't have [1,3].

Wait, maybe K_f refers to the number of elements in the kernel and the function's order? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the kernel as a subgroup, but since it's trivial, maybe it's represented by [0], but again, the options are pairs.

Alternatively, maybe K_f is the number of elements mapped to each element in the codomain. Let's think: the function f: U_5 → U_5, f(x)=x².

The possible outputs are 0,1,4.

So for 0: only x=0 maps to it.

For 1: x=1 and x=4 map to it.

For 4: x=2 and x=3 map to it.

So the preimages are:

- 0: size 1

- 1: size 2

-4: size 2

So perhaps K_f is the sizes of the kernel and the fibers. But the kernel is only for 0, which is size 1. The other fibers have size 2.

But I'm not sure how this would translate to the options given.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the kernel and the image, but in terms of the orders. So kernel has order 1, image has order 3. So the pair would be [1,3], which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, maybe K_f is something else, like the set of elements x where f(x) is in a particular subset. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The kernel is the set of x where f(x)=0, which is only x=0. So K_f is {0}.

But the options don't have a single-element set, so perhaps the question is using a different notation. Maybe the options represent the elements of K_f as a list, but in the options, each is a pair of numbers. So perhaps [0,1], but that would mean including 0 and 1, which is incorrect because only 0 is in the kernel.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using K_f as the image, which is {0,1,4}. So the image would have elements 0,1,4. But the options don't have that as a pair.

Wait, another approach: the function f is a ring homomorphism. So in ring theory, the kernel is an ideal. The only ideals in U_5 are {0} and U_5 itself. Since f isn't the zero map, the kernel is {0}.

But again, the options don't reflect this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering K_f as the set of elements that are idempotent under f, but that would be where f(f(x))=x. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the graph of the function, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the set of elements that are fixed points, as I thought earlier. So {0,1}, which would correspond to [0,1], option F.

But earlier I thought the kernel is {0}, but maybe the question is using K_f differently.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the image of the function, which is {0,1,4}. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option F is [0,1], which are the fixed points. Option A is [1,2], which I don't know.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another angle. Maybe K_f is the number of elements in the kernel and the image. So kernel has 1 element, image has 3. But none of the options match [1,3].

Wait, perhaps the kernel is considered as a subgroup, and the question is referring to the order of the kernel and the order of the image. So kernel order is 1, image order is 3. But the options don't have [1,3].

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is {0}, and the image is {0,1,4}, so the pair of their sizes is [1,3]. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the question.

The question says f: U_5 → U_5 is given by f(x)=x² and is a homomorphism. What is K_f?

Wait, perhaps K_f refers to the kernel in the sense of linear transformations, but U_5 isn't a vector space over itself, but over a field. Wait, U_5 is a field, so perhaps f is a linear transformation, but f(x)=x² isn't linear because f(x+y) = (x+y)² = x² + 2xy + y², which isn't equal to f(x)+f(y) unless the characteristic is 2, which 5 isn't. So f isn't a linear transformation, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f refers to the set of elements that are not in the image. So the image is {0,1,4}, so the complement is {2,3}. So K_f would be {2,3}, which would correspond to [2,3], option J.

But that doesn't make much sense in standard terminology. Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the cokernel, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the set of elements that are sent to zero, which is the kernel {0}, but the options don't include that.

Wait, maybe the question is using K_f as the image of the function f. The image has elements {0,1,4}, but none of the options directly represent this set.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is [4,2]. Wait, 4 and 2. Hmm, perhaps it's the image size and something else. But image size is 3, not 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of elements in the kernel and the number of elements not in the kernel. Kernel size is 1, so non-kernel is 4. So [1,4], but that's option G: [3,4], no.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the image of f composed with some other function, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: in some contexts, K_f could refer to the graph of f, but I don't know how that would translate to the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of elements that f maps to each element. So for 0, there's 1 preimage (only 0). For 1, there are two preimages (1 and 4). For 4, there are two preimages (2 and 3). So the fiber sizes are 1, 2, 2. But how does that relate to the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the size of the kernel and the image. Kernel size is 1, image size is 3. So [1,3], but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the kernel as a subgroup, which is {0}, and the image as a subgroup, which is {0,1,4}. But how to represent this as a pair. Maybe the number of elements in each? Kernel is 1, image is 3, so [1,3]. No option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is considered as the trivial subgroup, so its order is 1, and the image's order is 3. But again, no option matches.

Wait, another angle: maybe the function f is a group homomorphism under multiplication. Wait, but U_5 under multiplication is a group of units, which are {1,2,3,4}. So the multiplicative group has order 4. So f(x)=x² is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group to itself. The kernel would be elements x where x² = 1. Because in multiplicative group, the identity is 1.

So in multiplicative group U_5^* = {1,2,3,4}, f(x)=x². So find x where x² ≡1 mod5.

x=1: 1²=1 → yes.

x=4: 4²=16≡1 → yes.

So kernel is {1,4}, which has size 2. The image would be the set of squares: 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=4, 4²=1. So image is {1,4}, size 2.

So in this case, kernel size is 2, image size is 2. So the pair would be [2,2], but that's not an option. Looking at the options, option C is [4,2], which is close but the first element is 4.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the additive group. Earlier, the kernel in additive group is {0}, size 1. The image under f is {0,1,4}, size 3. So [1,3] again.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to K_f as the set of elements x where f(x) is in the kernel. But that would be x where x² is in the kernel, which is x²=0 → x=0.

So K_f would be {0}, which again isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps K_f is the set of elements related by the kernel, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the options are. The options are pairs of numbers from 0 to5. Perhaps each pair represents the number of elements in kernel and image.

But earlier, kernel has 1
