Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a car battery and charge. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says a car battery supplies a current of 50 amps to the starter motor, and I need to find out how much charge passes through in half a minute. Oh right, charge is measured in coulombs, right?

Wait, I remember that current is the rate of flow of charge. So the formula I think is Q = I * t, where Q is the charge, I is current, and t is time. But wait, I have to make sure the units are correct because sometimes that's where mistakes happen.

The current is given in amps, which are coulombs per second. So 1 amp is 1 coulomb per second. The time here is half a minute, which is 30 seconds. Oh right, because one minute is 60 seconds, so half is 30.

So plugging the values into the formula, Q = 50 A * 30 s. Let me calculate that: 50 times 30 is 1500. So the charge would be 1500 coulombs. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option D is 1500 coul. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check. Did I convert the time correctly? Yes, half a minute is 30 seconds. And 50 times 30 is definitely 1500. Yeah, that makes sense. So I think the answer is D.

The problem involves calculating the charge passing through a starter motor using the formula \( Q = I \times t \). The current \( I \) is 50 A, and the time \( t \) is 30 seconds (since half a minute equals 30 seconds). Substituting these values gives \( Q = 50 \times 30 = 1500 \) coulombs. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

D: 1500 coul

Answer: D
