Okay, so I have this problem about Kepler's third law, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about the orbital periods of two moons around Saturn, Titan and Hyperion. I remember that Kepler's laws apply here because they're moons orbiting a planet.

Alright, the problem says Titan has a mean orbital radius of 1.22e9 meters and an orbital period of 15.95 days. Hyperion's orbital radius is 1.48e9 meters, and I need to find its period. 

I think Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, since both moons are orbiting the same planet, Saturn, the proportionality constant would be the same for both. So I can set up a ratio where (T1^2)/(r1^3) = (T2^2)/(r2^3). 

Let me write that down. T1 is 15.95 days, r1 is 1.22e9 m, and r2 is 1.48e9 m. I need to find T2. 

So the formula would be (T2^2) / (T1^2) = (r2^3) / (r1^3). Taking the square root of both sides, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (r2/r1)^3 ). 

Wait, another way to write it: T2 = T1 * (r2/r1)^(3/2). That makes sense because as the radius increases, the period increases more than linearly. 

So plugging in the numbers. Let's compute the ratio r2/r1 first. 

r2 = 1.48e9, r1 = 1.22e9. So 1.48 / 1.22 is approximately what? Let me calculate that. 1.48 divided by 1.22. Hmm, 1.22 times 1.2 is 1.464, which is a bit less than 1.48. So maybe around 1.21? Let me do it more accurately. 1.48 / 1.22 equals approximately 1.2131. Let me check: 1.22 * 1.21 is 1.22 * 1.2 = 1.464, plus 1.22 * 0.01 =0.0122, so 1.4762. Oh wait, that's higher than 1.48. Wait, so 1.22 * 1.21 is 1.4762, which is a bit more than 1.48. So maybe 1.48 /1.22 is about 1.213. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's see: 

1.48 /1.22. Let me do this division step by step. 

1.22 goes into 1.48 once (1.22), which leaves 0.26. Bring down a zero: 2.60. 1.22 goes into 2.60 twice (2.44), leaving 0.16. Bring down a zero: 1.60. 1.22 goes once (1.22), leaving 0.38. Bring down a zero: 3.80. 1.22 goes into that 3 times (3.66), leaving 0.14. So the division is approximately 1.213... So about 1.2131.

So r2/r1 ≈ 1.2131.

Now, I need to cube that. So (1.2131)^3. Let's compute that. Hmm, (1.2)^3 is 1.728. But 1.213 is a bit more than 1.2. Alternatively, compute step by step.

1.2131 * 1.2131 = ? Let me compute 1.21 *1.21 first. 1.21 squared is 1.4641. Then, 1.2131 is a bit more. Let me compute it as (1.21 +0.0031)^2 = 1.21^2 + 2*(1.21)(0.0031) + 0.0031^2 ≈ 1.4641 + 0.007522 + 0.00000961 ≈ 1.47163.

Then, multiply that by 1.2131 again to get the cube. So 1.47163 * 1.2131.

Let me approximate that. 1.47163 * 1.2 is 1.7659. 1.47163 * 0.0131 is approximately 0.01928. So total is about 1.7659 + 0.01928 ≈ 1.78518.

Wait, more accurately, perhaps 1.47163 *1.2131.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe a better approach is to compute (r2/r1)^3.

Wait, let me see if I can use exponents in another way. Because maybe I can compute the cube as (1.48/1.22)^3.

Another approach is to compute the cube of each number, then take the ratio.

Wait, no, that's the same as (r2^3)/(r1^3), which is (r2/r1)^3.

So, let me try another approach. Let me compute (1.48/1.22)^3 = (148/122)^3. Let me compute that as a fraction. 148/122 can be simplified? Let me see, both divided by 2: 74/61. So 74/61 ≈ 1.2131 as before.

So I'll compute (74/61)^3. 

74^3 is 74*74*74. Let's compute that step by step.

74 *74 = 5476. Then 5476 *74. Hmm, 5476 *70=383320, 5476*4=21904; adding them gives 405,224.

Wait, wait: 5476 *74:

=5476 * (70 +4) = (5476*70) + (5476*4)
5476 *70 = 5476 *7 *10. 5476 *7: 5000*7=35,000; 476*7=3,332. So 35,000 +3,332=38,332. Multiply by 10: 383,320.
5476 *4 =21,904.
Adding together: 383,320 +21,904=405,224. So 74^3=405,224.

61^3: 61 *61=3721. 3721 *61. Let's compute that: 3721*60=223,260; 3721*1=3,721. Sum is 223,260 +3,721=226,981.

So (74/61)^3 =405224 / 226981 ≈ let's compute that division.

405224 ÷ 226,981. Let me see, 226,981 *1.8 = approx 408,565 (because 226,981 *2=453,962; subtract 226,981*0.2=45,396.2; 453,962 -45,396.2=408,565.8). Wait, but 226,981 *1.8 is 408,565.8, which is a bit larger than 405,224. So let me compute 1.78.

So 1.78 *226,981 =?

Compute 1.7 *226,981 = 385,971.7; 0.08 *226,981 = 18,158.48. So 385,971.7 +18,158.48 =404,130.18. So 1.78 gives 404,130.18, which is less than 405,224.

The difference is 405,224 -404,130.18=1,093.82. Each 0.001 increase in the multiplier adds 226.981 to the product. So 1093.82 /226.981≈ approx 4.82 (since 226.981 *4=907.924; 226.981*4.8= approx 907.9 + (226.981 *0.8)=181.5848. Total 907.9 +181.58≈1089.48). So about 4.82. So the total multiplier is 1.78 +0.00482≈1.7848. So the ratio (74/61)^3≈1.7848.

Wait, but wait, that's (r2/r1)^3. Then, the square root of that would be (r2/r1)^(3/2). Alternatively, T2 = T1 * (r2/r1)^(3/2).

Wait, no, the equation is T2 = T1 * (r2/r1)^(3/2). Because T^2 is proportional to r^3, so T is proportional to r^(3/2). So, (T2/T1) = (r2/r1)^(3/2).

So, (r2/r1) is 1.2131, so (1.2131)^(3/2). Hmm, the square root of 1.2131 is approximately 1.1016, and then raise that to the 3rd power.

Wait, alternatively, (1.2131)^1.5 = sqrt(1.2131)^3.

Wait, sqrt(1.2131) is about 1.1016. Then, 1.1016^3.

Compute 1.1 *1.1 =1.21, then *1.1=1.331. But wait, 1.1016 is a bit more than 1.1, so 1.1016^3 would be a bit more than 1.331.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1.1016^3.

First, 1.1016 *1.1016: 

1.1 *1.1 is 1.21. The exact calculation: 

(1 + 0.1 + 0.0016)^2. Hmm, maybe better to do it step by step.

1.1016 *1.1016:

Multiply 1.1016 by 1.1016:

1 *1.1016 =1.1016
0.1 *1.1016=0.11016
0.0016 *1.1016=0.00176256
Now sum them:

But wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly.

Wait, no, I think I confused the method. The standard way to multiply 1.1016 × 1.1016 is:

1.1016
× 1.1016
------------
Let me compute this multiplication.

But perhaps it's easier to approximate. Let's note that 1.1016^2 ≈ (1.1)^2 + 2*(1.1)*(0.0016) + (0.0016)^2 ) = 1.21 + 0.00352 + 0.00000256 ≈1.21352256.

Then, multiplying 1.21352256 by 1.1016 to get the cube.

So, 1.21352256 *1.1016 ≈ ?

Let me break this down:

1.21352256 *1 =1.21352256
1.21352256 *0.1=0.121352256
1.21352256 *0.0016= approx 0.001942037.

Adding these together: 1.21352256 +0.121352256 =1.334874816 +0.001942037=1.336816853.

So approximately 1.3368.

So (r2/r1)^(3/2) ≈1.3368.

Wait, but earlier I had (r2/r1)^3 ≈1.7848, which would make (r2/r1)^(3/2) the square root of 1.7848, which is about 1.336. So that matches.

So T2 = T1 * 1.3368. 

T1 is 15.95 days. So 15.95 *1.3368. Let me compute that.

15.95 *1 =15.95
15.95 *0.3=4.785
15.95 *0.03=0.4785
15.95 *0.0068= approx 0.10846 (0.01*15.95=0.1595; so 0.0068 is about 0.68 of that, so 0.1595*0.68= approx 0.1085).

Adding all parts:

15.95 +4.785 =20.735
+0.4785 → 21.2135
+0.1085 →21.322.

So approximately 21.32 days.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

1.3368 multiplied by 15.95.

Let me compute 15.95 * 1.3368.

Breakdown:

15.95 × 1 =15.95
15.95 × 0.3=4.785
15.95 × 0.03=0.4785
15.95 × 0.0068=0.10846
Wait, but wait, 1.3368 is equal to 1 +0.3 +0.03 +0.0068.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

15.95 *1.3368 = ?

Another approach: 15.95 *1.3368 =15.95 * (1 + 0.3 +0.03 +0.006 +0.0008).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 15.95 ×1.3368.

Alternatively, compute 15.95 × 1.3368:

15.95 ×1 =15.95

15.95 ×0.3 = 4.785

15.95 ×0.03 = 0.4785

15.95 ×0.0068= Let's compute 15.95 ×0.006 =0.0957; 15.95 ×0.0008=0.01276. So total 0.10846.

Adding all these together:

15.95 +4.785 =20.735

+0.4785 →21.2135

+0.10846 →21.32196.

So about 21.322 days. 

Looking at the options, option B is 21.3 days, option D is 22.6, option E is 20.1, etc. So the closest is option B: 21.3 days.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait another approach: using the formula T2 = T1 * (r2/r1)^1.5.

So r2/r1 is 1.48/1.22 = approximately 1.2131.

So 1.2131^1.5 = sqrt(1.2131^3) = sqrt(1.7848) ≈1.3368, as before.

So 15.95 *1.3368= approx 21.32 days.

Looking back at the options, option B is 21.3 days, which matches.

But wait, the options have option B as 21.3, which is the closest.

Wait, but wait, let me check the exact calculation because sometimes approximations can introduce errors. Let me compute (1.48/1.22) more accurately.

1.48 /1.22 = ?

Let me compute 1.48 divided by 1.22.

1.22 × 1.21 = 1.22 ×1 =1.22; 1.22 ×0.2=0.244; 1.22×0.01=0.0122. So 1.22 +0.244=1.464; +0.0122=1.4762. That's larger than 1.48, so 1.21 is too high. So 1.48 is between 1.22 ×1.21 and 1.22 ×1.20.

Wait, 1.22 ×1.20=1.464. 1.48-1.464=0.016. So how much more than 1.20 do we need to get 0.016 more?

Since 1.22 × x =0.016, x=0.016/1.22≈0.0131.

So the ratio is 1.20 +0.0131=1.2131, as before.

So the cube is 1.2131^3= approx 1.7848.

Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.2131 ×1.2131 ×1.2131.

First, compute 1.2131 squared.

1.2131 ×1.2131:

= (1.2 +0.0131)^2 =1.2^2 + 2*(1.2)*(0.0131) +0.0131^2.

=1.44 + 0.03144 +0.00017161=1.44+0.03144=1.47144 +0.00017161≈1.471611.

Now multiply by 1.2131 again:

1.471611 ×1.2131.

Let me compute 1.471611 ×1 =1.471611.

1.471611 ×0.2=0.2943222.

1.471611 ×0.01=0.01471611.

1.471611 ×0.003=0.004414833.

1.471611 ×0.0001=0.0001471611.

Wait, but 1.2131 is 1 +0.2 +0.01 +0.003 +0.0001.

So adding all the parts:

1.471611 (from ×1)
+0.2943222 (from ×0.2) →1.7659332
+0.01471611 (from ×0.01) →1.78064931
+0.004414833 (from ×0.003) →1.78506414
+0.0001471611 (from ×0.0001) →1.7852113.

So 1.2131^3≈1.7852.

Then the square root of 1.7852 is approximately sqrt(1.7852). Let me compute that. 

We know that 1.33^2=1.7689, and 1.34^
