Okay, so I have this math problem here about a custom operation called #. It seems a bit tricky at first, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The operation # is defined for all real numbers r and s. There are three conditions given:

1. r # 0 = r. So when the right operand is zero, the result is just the left operand.
2. r # s = s # r. That means the operation is commutative. The order of the operands doesn't matter.
3. (r + 1) # s = (r # s) + s + 1. Hmm, this looks like a recursive formula. It relates the operation when the first operand is incremented by 1.

And the question is asking for the value of 11 # 5. The options are given from A to J.

I think I need to find a general formula for r # s based on these conditions. Let me try to work it out.

First, let's look at condition 3. It says that when you increase r by 1, the result of (r+1)#s is equal to (r#s) plus s plus 1. This seems like a pattern that could help me express r#s in terms of r and s.

Let me try to expand this for a few values. Let's start with r = 0.

When r = 0, condition 1 tells me that 0 # s = 0 # s, but wait, condition 1 says r # 0 = r. So 0 # s isn't directly given, but maybe we can find it using the other conditions.

Wait, condition 2 says the operation is commutative, so 0 # s = s # 0. But from condition 1, s # 0 = s. So 0 # s must equal s. So 0 # s = s.

Wait, that's interesting. So 0 # s = s, and r # 0 = r. Hmm.

Now, let's try to use condition 3 recursively. Suppose I know r # s, then (r + 1) # s = (r # s) + s + 1.

Let me try to find a general expression. Let's consider what happens when I increment r from 0 upwards.

Letâ€™s consider r as an integer, but the problem says for all real numbers, so maybe it's better to think in terms of variables.

Wait, maybe I can express r # s in terms of r and s. Let me think about it.

Starting with r = 0: 0 # s = s (from earlier reasoning).

Now, for r = 1: 1 # s = (0 # s) + s + 1. Since 0 # s is s, this becomes s + s +1 = 2s +1.

Similarly, for r = 2: 2 # s = (1 # s) + s +1. We know 1 # s is 2s +1, so 2s +1 + s +1 = 3s + 2.

Wait, that's 3s +2. Hmm. Let me see the pattern.

r=0: 0 # s = s = 1*s +0
r=1: 1*s = 2s +1
r=2: 3s +2
Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me compute again.

Wait, for r=0: 0 # s = s.

r=1: (0+1) # s = (0 # s) + s +1. So 1 # s = s + s +1 = 2s +1.

r=2: (1+1) # s = (1 # s) + s +1. So 2 # s = (2s +1) + s +1 = 3s + 2.

r=3: (2+1) # s = (2 # s) + s +1. So 3 # s = (3s +2) + s +1 = 4s +3.

Wait a minute, I see a pattern here. For each increment in r, the coefficient of s increases by 1, and the constant term increases by 1 as well.

So, r=0: 1*s +0
r=1: 2*s +1
r=2: 3*s +2
r=3: 4*s +3
...
So for a general integer r, it seems that r # s = (r +1)*s + r.

Wait, let me check that. For r=0: (0+1)*s +0 = s, which matches.

r=1: (1+1)*s +1 = 2s +1. Correct.

r=2: 3s +2. Correct. So this formula seems to work when r is a non-negative integer.

But wait, the problem says for all real numbers r and s. So maybe this formula applies generally, not just for integers.

Wait, but let me think. If r is a real number, then perhaps the formula would still hold? Let me test with a fractional r. Suppose r=0.5.

Wait, but maybe I can find a general formula using these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the operation # can be expressed as r # s = r*s + r + s. Let's test this.

Wait, let's test with r=0. 0 # s = 0*s +0 +s = s. Which matches condition 1.

What about r=1 and s=5? Let's compute 1 # 5. According to the formula I thought, it's 1*5 +1 +5 =5+1+5=11. But earlier, when I calculated 1 #5, I got 2*5+1=11. So that matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me check 2 #5. According to the formula, 2*5 +2 +5=10+2+5=17. But earlier, when I calculated 2 #5 as 3*5 +2=17, which matches. So perhaps the formula is r # s = r*s + r + s.

Wait, but another thought: the formula seems to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps r # s = (r+1)(s+1) -1. Let me check.

(r+1)(s+1) = r*s + r + s +1. So subtracting 1 gives r*s + r + s. So yes, r # s = (r+1)(s+1) -1.

Let me test this.

For r=0, (0+1)(s+1) -1 = (1)(s+1) -1 = s +1 -1 = s. Correct.

For r=1, (2)(s+1) -1 = 2s +2 -1=2s+1. Correct.

For r=2, (3)(s+1)-1=3s+3 -1=3s+2. Correct.

So the formula is r # s = (r+1)(s+1) -1.

Alternatively, expanding that, it's r*s + r + s +1 -1, which is r*s + r + s.

So the operation can be expressed as r # s = r*s + r + s.

Alternatively, factoring, r # s = (r+1)(s+1) -1.

This seems consistent.

So now, to compute 11 #5, using this formula.

Compute (11 +1)(5 +1) -1 = 12 *6 -1 =72 -1=71.

Wait, that's 71. Let me check the answer options.

Looking back, the options are A:11, B:55, C:12, D:64, E:81, F:56, G:71, H:16, I:66, J:76.

So 71 is option G.

Wait, but let me double-check my formula, because sometimes I might make a mistake in the reasoning.

Let me go back. The conditions given are:

1. r # 0 = r.

From my formula, r #0 = (r+1)(0+1) -1 = (r+1)(1) -1= r+1 -1 = r. Correct.

2. Commutative: r # s = s # r.

Since multiplication is commutative, and addition is commutative, the formula holds. So (r+1)(s+1) -1 is the same as (s+1)(r+1) -1. Correct.

3. (r+1) # s = (r # s) + s +1.

Let's test this with the formula.

Left side: (r+1) # s = (r+2)(s+1) -1.

Right side: r # s + s +1 = [ (r+1)(s+1)-1 ] + s +1.

Expand right side: (r+1)(s+1) -1 + s +1 = (r+1)(s+1) + s.

Now, left side: (r+2)(s+1) -1 = (r+1 +1)(s+1) -1 = (r+1)(s+1) + (s+1) -1 = (r+1)(s+1) + s +1 -1 = (r+1)(s+1) + s.

Which matches the right side. So the formula holds.

Therefore, the formula is correct.

Thus, 11 #5 = (11+1)(5+1) -1 =12*6 -1=72-1=71.

So the correct answer is G:71.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of $11 \# 5$ based on the given conditions for the custom operation $\#$. The conditions are:

1. $r \# 0 = r$.
2. $r \# s = s \# r$ (commutative property).
3. $(r + 1) \# s = (r \# s) + s + 1$.

### Step 1: Derive the general formula for $r \# s$
Using condition 3 recursively, we can derive the general formula for $r \# s$:

- Start with $r = 0$: $0 \# s = s$ (from condition 1).
- For $r = 1$: $(0 + 1) \# s = (0 \# s) + s + 1 = s + s + 1 = 2s + 1$.
- For $r = 2$: $(1 + 1) \# s = (1 \# s) + s + 1 = (2s + 1) + s + 1 = 3s + 2$.
- For $r = 3$: $(2 + 1) \# s = (2 \# s) + s + 1 = (3s + 2) + s + 1 = 4s + 3$.

From this pattern, we observe that for a general $r$, the operation can be expressed as:
\[
r \# s = (r + 1)(s + 1) - 1
\]

### Step 2: Verify the formula
The derived formula satisfies all the given conditions:
1. $r \# 0 = (r + 1)(0 + 1) - 1 = r + 1 - 1 = r$.
2. $r \# s = (r + 1)(s + 1) - 1 = (s + 1)(r + 1) - 1 = s \# r$.
3. $(r + 1) \# s = (r + 2)(s + 1) - 1$, and $(r \# s) + s + 1 = [(r + 1)(s + 1) - 1] + s + 1 = (r + 1)(s + 1) + s$. Expanding $(r + 2)(s + 1) - 1$ gives $(r + 1)(s + 1) + s + 1 - 1 = (r + 1)(s + 1) + s$, which matches.

Thus, the formula is correct.

### Step 3: Compute $11 \# 5$
Using the formula:
\[
11 \# 5 = (11 + 1)(5 + 1) - 1 = 12 \cdot 6 - 1 = 72 - 1 = 71
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of $11 \# 5$ is **71**, which corresponds to option **G**.
