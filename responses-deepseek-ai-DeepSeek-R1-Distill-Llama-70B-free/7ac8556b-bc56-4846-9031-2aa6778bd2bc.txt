Question:

 Which of the following statements best describes Gill's response to the argument that the Oregon physician-assisted law falsely assumes that doctors are qualified to judge whether a life is worth living?

Options:

A: Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.
B: The law is in line with the doctors' Hippocratic oath of doing no harm.
C: Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living.
D: The law doesn't require doctors to judge the worth of a life, but rather to provide a professional opinion on the patient's condition.
E: The argument is valid because doctors should not be the ones to decide whether a life is worth living.
F: The law is justified as doctors are inherently equipped to make such judgements due to their profession.
G: The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.
H: The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.
I: The argument is irrelevant as the law is about patient autonomy and not about doctors' judgement on life's worth.
J: The law is flawed because it puts too much pressure on the doctors to make such decisions.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about Gill's response to the argument regarding the Oregon physician-assisted law. So, the question is about which statement best describes Gill's stance on the claim that the law falsely assumes doctors are qualified to judge if a life is worth living.

First, I need to understand the argument. The argument says that the Oregon law is flawed because it assumes doctors can judge whether a life is worth living. So, someone is arguing that doctors aren't qualified to make that kind of value judgment.

Now, looking at the options from A to J, I need to find which one aligns with how Gill would respond. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of Gill's position, but I remember that he has written about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. From what I recall, Gill argues that the role of doctors is to provide medical expertise, not to make moral judgments about the worth of a patient's life.

So, if the argument is that doctors shouldn't judge the worth of a life, Gill might respond by saying that the law doesn't actually require doctors to make that judgment. Instead, doctors are supposed to provide a professional assessment of the patient's medical condition, like whether they're terminally ill and have less than six months to live. The decision about whether life is worth living is left up to the patient, respecting their autonomy.

Looking at the options, option D says: "The law doesn't require doctors to judge the worth of a life, but rather to provide a professional opinion on the patient's condition." That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. The doctors give medical opinions, not value judgments.

Another option that caught my eye is option I: "The argument is irrelevant as the law is about patient autonomy and not about doctors' judgement on life's worth." This also makes sense because the law focuses on the patient's right to choose, not the doctor's evaluation of life's worth. But I think option D is more precise because it directly addresses the role of the doctor's professional opinion, which is about medical facts, not the value of life.

Option C suggests doctors are as qualified as any mature adult, but that doesn't seem right because the argument is about whether they should be making that judgment at all, not their relative qualifications. Option E validates the argument, which I don't think Gill does. Option G says the law requires doctors to make decisions about life expectancy, which is true, but maybe not as directly addressing the worth aspect as D does.

So I think the best answer is D. It clarifies that doctors provide medical opinions, not judgments on the worth of life, which directly counters the argument that the law wrongly assumes doctors can make such judgments.

The best answer is D. 

The law doesn't require doctors to judge the worth of a life, but rather to provide a professional opinion on the patient's condition. This directly addresses the argument by clarifying the role of doctors as providers of medical assessments, not moral judgments.

Answer: D
