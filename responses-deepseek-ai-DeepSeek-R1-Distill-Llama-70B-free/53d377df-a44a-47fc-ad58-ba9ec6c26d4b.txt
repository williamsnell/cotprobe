Question:

A musician owned a summer cottage on the lake. A neighbor, an adjoining land owner, started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling of sand, rocks, dirt, and other materials on his property. The neighbor's excessive excavating in the course of conducting his sand removal business causes the collapse of a large storage building on the musician's property. If the musician brings an action to recover damages for the collapse of his storage building, the musician will probably

Options:

A: be successful, because the neighbor would be strictly liable for his removal of lateral support.
B: not be successful, because an adjacent land owner is under no affirmative duty to laterally support his neighbor's land.
C: not be successful, because the neighbor's property rights include the right to excavate.
D: not be successful, unless the neighbor's activities violated a local zoning ordinance.
E: be successful, if he can prove that the neighbor failed to take reasonable precautions to prevent damage.
F: be successful, because the neighbor's business activities constitute a nuisance.
G: not be successful, unless he can prove that the neighbor intentionally caused the collapse.
H: not be successful, because the neighbor could not be held liable for damage to an artificial structure such as a storage building.
I: be successful, if he can prove that the neighbor was operating his business without proper permits.
J: be successful if he can prove that the neighbor was negligent in his excavations.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with lateral support and excavations. Hmm, I remember that lateral support has to do with neighboring landowners and the duty to support each other's land. Let me think.

The scenario is that a musician owns a summer cottage, and the neighbor starts a sand business that involves heavy hauling. The neighbor's excavations cause the collapse of the musician's storage building. The question is whether the musician can recover damages.

I think the key issue here is the doctrine of lateral support. From what I remember, a landowner has the right to lateral support from neighboring land. If someone removes support and causes subsidence or collapse, they might be liable. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules.

I recall that there's a distinction between natural and artificial structures. Oh right, the traditional rule is that a landowner is not liable for the removal of lateral support if it's done in a way that's not negligent. Wait, no, maybe it's that a landowner has a duty not to withdraw support in a way that causes injury. Or is it that the landowner is strictly liable for removing lateral support, regardless of negligence?

Wait, no, I think it's not strict liability. Because strict liability would mean liability without fault, like for certain activities considered abnormally dangerous. But lateral support is more about negligence. So if the neighbor excavates in a way that's negligent, causing the collapse, then they could be liable.

Let me look at the options. Option A says the neighbor is strictly liable. If that's the case, then maybe A is wrong because it's not strict liability. Option E says the musician would be successful if he can prove the neighbor failed to take reasonable precautions. That sounds like negligence. Option B says the neighbor has no duty to provide lateral support. Wait, I thought there was a duty.

Wait, no, perhaps the duty is not to remove support in a way that causes damage. So if the neighbor removes support and the musician's land collapses, the neighbor is liable only if they acted negligently. So in other words, the musician would need to prove negligence. That would point towards option E or J.

Wait, option J says successful if the neighbor was negligent in excavations. Option E is about failing to take reasonable precautions. So both E and J are about negligence.

Wait, but I think the rule is that a landowner can make any use of their land, including excavating, but if they do so negligently and cause damage, they are liable. So if the neighbor's excavation was done negligently, the musician can recover.

So looking at the options, option E is about failing to take reasonable precautions, which is a negligence standard. Option J is about negligence in the excavations. So both E and J are possible.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is that the landowner is not strictly liable for lateral support, but can be held liable for negligence. So if the neighbor's excavation was done negligently, the musician can recover. So the correct answer would be either E or J.

Looking back, the question is whether the musician will probably be successful. So if the neighbor's actions were negligent, then yes. So the answer would depend on whether the neighbor's actions constituted negligence.

So the options: A is strict liability, which I think is incorrect. B says no duty, which is also incorrect because there is a duty not to cause harm through negligent excavation. C says property rights include right to excavate, which is true, but if done negligently, they can still be liable. So C is incorrect because it's not an absolute right without liability.

D says unless zoning ordinance, which is not the issue here. F is about nuisance. I'm not sure if this is a nuisance; it's more about negligence in causing damage. G is about intent, which is higher than negligence. H says can't be liable for artificial structures, but I think that's not correct because the duty applies regardless of whether the structure is natural or artificial. Wait, wait. Wait, I think the duty to provide lateral support applies to the land itself, not to structures. So if the neighbor's excavation causes the land to subside, leading to damage to the building, then liability may arise. But I'm a bit confused on that.

Wait, I think the traditional rule is that a landowner is liable for injury caused by the withdrawal of lateral support to the land, but not to structures. Or is it the opposite? No, I think the duty is to the land, so if the land subsides, the structure built on it is damaged, but the duty is about the land's support. So in that case, the neighbor could be liable for damage to the building because it's a result of the land subsidence.

So going back, the key is whether the duty exists and what standard applies. So the correct answer is that the musician must prove negligence, so either E or J. Now, looking at the options, J says "if he can prove the neighbor was negligent in his excavations." So that's the negligence standard.

Therefore, the correct answer is J. Because without proving negligence, the neighbor isn't strictly liable, so A is out. B is wrong because there is a duty not to cause harm through negligence. So the correct choice is J.

The question revolves around the doctrine of lateral support and whether the musician can recover damages for the collapse of his storage building caused by the neighbor's excavations. The key issue is the standard of liabilityâ€”whether it is strict liability, negligence, or something else.

Under the doctrine of lateral support, a landowner has the right to lateral support from neighboring land. However, this duty is not absolute. A landowner is not strictly liable for the removal of lateral support unless it is done negligently. If the excavations are conducted in a negligent manner, causing damage to the neighboring property, the landowner can be held liable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Strict liability does not apply here; the neighbor is not automatically liable for removing lateral support unless negligence is proven.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While there is no absolute duty to provide lateral support, a landowner can be held liable if their actions are negligent and cause harm.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Property rights do include the right to excavate, but this right is not absolute. Liability arises if the excavation is conducted negligently.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The question does not involve zoning ordinances, so this is irrelevant.
- **Option E**: Plausible. This option focuses on the failure to take reasonable precautions, which aligns with a negligence standard.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The situation does not necessarily constitute a nuisance; it is more about negligence in causing damage.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Intent is a higher standard than required here; negligence is sufficient.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Liability can extend to damage caused to artificial structures like the storage building if the damage results from negligent excavations.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The absence of proper permits is not the central issue here; the focus is on negligence.
- **Option J**: Correct. This option directly addresses negligence in the excavations, which is the applicable standard in this case.

The correct answer is **J**, as the musician must prove that the neighbor was negligent in their excavations to recover damages. 

Answer: J
