Okay, so I've got this probability question here about throwing dice. Hmm, I remember that when you throw two dice, each die has 6 faces, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes in total. That's the denominator for all probabilities here.

The question is asking for the probability of throwing at least one of the totals: 5, 6, or 7 in a single throw. They've defined events A, B, and C as getting 5, 6, or 7 respectively. So I need to find P(A or B or C).

Wait, but in probability, when events are mutually exclusive, the probability of any one happening is just the sum of their individual probabilities. Are A, B, and C mutually exclusive here? Let me think. Well, you can't get a total of 5 and 6 on the same throw, right? Because each throw only gives one total. So yes, these events are mutually exclusive. That means I can just add their probabilities together.

So I'll calculate each probability separately and then sum them up.

First, for event A (total of 5). The possible dice combinations are (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). That's 4 outcomes. So P(A) = 4/36.

Next, event B (total of 6). The combinations are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1). That's 5 outcomes. So P(B) =5/36.

Then, event C (total of 7). Hmm, I think this has the most combinations. Let's see: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). That's 6 outcomes. So P(C) =6/36.

Now, since these are mutually exclusive, I can add them up: P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = (4 +5 +6)/36 = 15/36. Wait, that's 15 over 36. Can I simplify that? Yeah, 15 divided by 3 is 5, 36 divided by 3 is 12. So 5/12.

Looking at the options, option E is 5/12. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, I might have miscounted the combinations. Let me recount each:

For 5: 1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1. Yep, 4. That's correct.

For 6: 1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1. 5. Correct.

For 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1. 6. Right.

So 4+5+6=15. 15/36=5/12. So yeah, option E is correct.

To determine the probability of throwing at least one of the totals 5, 6, or 7 on a single throw of a pair of dice, we define the events as follows:

- **Event A**: A total of 5 is thrown.  
- **Event B**: A total of 6 is thrown.  
- **Event C**: A total of 7 is thrown.  

Since these events are mutually exclusive (a single throw can only result in one total), the probability of at least one of these events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.

### Step 1: Calculate individual probabilities
1. **Event A (total of 5)**: The possible outcomes are (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), giving 4 outcomes.  
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{4}{36}
   \]

2. **Event B (total of 6)**: The possible outcomes are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), giving 5 outcomes.  
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{5}{36}
   \]

3. **Event C (total of 7)**: The possible outcomes are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), giving 6 outcomes.  
   \[
   P(C) = \frac{6}{36}
   \]

### Step 2: Add the probabilities
Since the events are mutually exclusive, we add their probabilities:  
\[
P(A \text{ or } B \text{ or } C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = \frac{4}{36} + \frac{5}{36} + \frac{6}{36} = \frac{15}{36}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the fraction
\[
\frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of throwing at least one of the totals 5, 6, or 7 is **5/12**, which corresponds to **option E**.
