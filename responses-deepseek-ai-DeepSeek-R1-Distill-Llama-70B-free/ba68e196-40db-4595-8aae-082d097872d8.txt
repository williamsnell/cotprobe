Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

Options:

A: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.
B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.
C: grant the motion, because the city attorney is using the same witness.
D: grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.
E: deny the motion, because the city's anti-smoking ordinance is separate from the state statute.
F: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
G: deny the motion, because the city has its own jurisdiction.
H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.
I: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about double jeopardy, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, double jeopardy is a concept I remember from my studies, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a defendant who was tried in state court for violating an anti-smoking statute. During the prosecution's case, a witness mentioned a prior conviction that had been excluded in a pretrial hearing. The judge granted a mistrial and excused the jury. Then, the state prosecutor appealed and won, but decided not to retry. Now, the city attorney wants to prosecute the same incident under a city ordinance that's identical to the state statute. The defendant is arguing double jeopardy.

So, the key issues here are double jeopardy and the concept of separate sovereigns. I remember that the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But wait, there's also the idea that state and local governments (like a city) are separate sovereigns, so they can each prosecute for the same conduct without violating double jeopardy. 

Wait, but in this case, the city ordinance is identical to the state statute. Does that make a difference? I think the separate sovereign doctrine says that each sovereign (state and city) can prosecute without it being double jeopardy. So even if the same incident is involved, each can bring their own case.

But what about the mistrial? When does jeopardy attach? I think jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn in a trial, or when the first witness is sworn in a bench trial. Here, the judge granted a mistrial because of the prosecution's error. I remember that if a mistrial is granted without the defendant's consent and it's not due to manifest necessity, then double jeopardy might bar a retrial. But in this case, the state prosecutor appealed, won, and then chose not to retry. So the state's case ended with a mistrial, but the state isn't pursuing it further.

Now, the city is bringing a separate prosecution. Since the city is a separate sovereign from the state, they can prosecute even if the state couldn't. So even though both are prosecuting the same incident, as long as they're different sovereigns, it's allowed. 

Wait, but what if the city and state are not separate sovereigns? Like, if the city ordinance is being enforced under state authority or something. But I think in general, municipalities are considered separate sovereigns for double jeopardy purposes, especially when they have their own power to enact ordinances. Unless the ordinance is just mirroring state law in a way that they're not separate, but I don't think that matters here.

So the defendant's motion is to dismiss based on double jeopardy. The court should decide whether the city's prosecution violates this. Since the city is a separate sovereign, the answer would be that double jeopardy doesn't apply, so the court should deny the motion.

Looking at the options:

Option I says to deny because the city and state are separate sovereigns. That fits with what I was thinking.

Option E says to deny because the city's ordinance is separate. That's somewhat similar but maybe less precise because the reason is the separate sovereign, not just the ordinance being separate.

Option A talks about the mistrial. The mistrial was in the state case, but the city is a different prosecution, so the mistrial doesn't directly affect the city's ability to prosecute.

Option F says jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. But since the city is a different sovereign, even if jeopardy attached in the state case, the city can still prosecute.

So the correct answer should be I.

The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. However, the "separate sovereigns doctrine" allows state and local governments to prosecute the same conduct without violating double jeopardy. In this case, the state and the city are separate sovereigns, and the city's anti-smoking ordinance, though identical to the state statute, is enforced under the city's independent authority. The mistrial in the state prosecution does not bar the city from prosecuting the same incident because the city is a distinct jurisdiction. Therefore, the court should deny the motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.

The correct answer is:

I: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Answer: I
