Okay, so I need to figure out how many states FDR didn't carry in the 1932 presidential election. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned. 

First, I know that FDR, Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the election in 1932 against Herbert Hoover. That was a significant election because it was during the Great Depression, and Hoover was the incumbent. So, FDR won, but by how much in terms of states?

I remember that the 1932 election was a landslide for Roosevelt. He carried a lot of states, especially considering the economic situation. But the question is about how many he didn't carry. So, I need to find out how many states went to Hoover.

Wait, how many states are there in total? Oh right, there are 50 states, but I think that's a fact from later because I remember that Alaska and Hawaii became states in 1959. So in 1932, there were 48 states. Yeah, that's correct. So the total was 48.

So if I can find out how many states FDR won, I can subtract that from 48 to find the number he didn't carry. Alternatively, I can directly find the number that Hoover carried.

I think FDR won a lot. From what I recall, he won 472 electoral votes. But wait, the total electoral votes depend on the number of states. Each state has a certain number based on population. But maybe I don't need that detail.

Wait, I remember that in 1932, FDR won 42 states. Because I think he lost a few in the Northeast. Let me think: Maine, Vermont, maybe New Hampshire and some others? Or was it just a couple?

Wait, no, I think he lost six states. Let me try to remember. So if he won 42, and there are 48, then 48-42=6. So he didn't carry six states. So the answer would be six, which is option G.

But wait, I'm not 100% sure. I might be mixing up the numbers. Let me try another angle. Hoover was the incumbent president, and the economy was terrible. So he was likely to lose, but some states stayed Republican.

I think the states Hoover carried were mainly in the Northeast. So probably New England states like Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, and perhaps some others. How many is that? Let's see, New England has six states: ME, NH, VT, MA, RI, CT. But maybe not all of them went to Hoover.

Wait, I think in 1932, FDR carried most of the New England states except for maybe two or four. Wait, no, I think he actually carried all of New England except for two. Or was it four?

Alternatively, maybe Hoover carried six states. I've heard that before. So if there were 48 states, and FDR won 42, then 6 didn't go to him. So six states.

So the answer would be G: six.

To determine how many states FDR did not carry in the 1932 presidential election, it's important to note that the United States had 48 states at the time. FDR won the election in a landslide, securing 42 states. Therefore, the number of states he did not carry is calculated by subtracting the states he won from the total number of states: 48 - 42 = 6. Thus, FDR did not carry six states.

Answer: G
