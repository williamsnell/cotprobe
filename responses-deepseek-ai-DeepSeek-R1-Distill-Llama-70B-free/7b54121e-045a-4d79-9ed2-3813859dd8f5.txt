Question:

A patient in a hospital was placed in a wheelchair with his broken leg extended straight out in front of him. As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because the patient has not provided any evidence to prove that the hospital was responsible for the malfunctioning doors.
B: No, because the hospital has a duty to ensure the safety of all its patients and failed to do so in this case.
C: Yes, because the hospital was not aware of any defects in the doors.
D: Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.
E: Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. 
F: No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.
G: No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.

Okay, so I have this question about a legal case where a patient is suing a hospital. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is that a patient with a broken leg is in a wheelchair, which the nurse is pushing through automatic doors. The doors close on the patient's foot, causing injury. When the nurse tries to pull back, the doors close tighter, making it worse.

The patient is suing the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. But here's the thing: the patient hasn't provided any specific evidence of neglect or misconduct by the hospital. The hospital is moving for summary judgment, and the question is whether the court should grant that motion.

Hmm, summary judgment is when one side asks the court to decide the case without a trial because there's no genuine issue of material fact. So the court would only grant it if, looking at the evidence, a reasonable jury couldn't find in favor of the other party.

In this case, the patient's claim is about the hospital's maintenance. But they haven't shown any specific actions or omissions by the hospital that caused the doors to malfunction. So the hospital's argument is probably that without such evidence, the case should be dismissed.

I remember that in tort law, to prove negligence, the plaintiff needs to show duty, breach, causation, and damages. Here, the breach would be the improper maintenance. Without evidence of that breach, like specific neglect, the claim might fail.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because no evidence of hospital's responsibility. That sounds plausible. But I need to think about whether the lack of specific evidence is enough for summary judgment.

Option D says yes because proof of an accident alone doesn't establish negligence. That rings a bell. Just because something went wrong doesn't automatically mean someone was negligent. The plaintiff needs more than that.

Option E suggests the nurse's action was a superseding cause. But the initial injury was from the doors closing, and the nurse pulling back made it worse. I'm not sure if that's a superseding cause because the nurse's action was a reaction to the initial problem, which might still be the hospital's responsibility if the doors were malfunctioning.

Option F says no because a jury could find a latent defect. But without evidence, can the jury infer that? I think courts usually require some evidence, not just speculation.

Option G mentions res ipsa loquitur. That doctrine applies when the injury is of a type that usually doesn't happen without negligence, and the defendant is in control. But I'm not sure if it applies here. The doors malfunctioning—maybe, but res ipsa requires that the plaintiff show that the accident wouldn't normally happen without negligence. If the doors are automatic and just closed on someone, maybe, but the hospital could argue proper maintenance would prevent that, so without evidence, res ipsa might not apply.

So considering that, the hospital's motion is based on the lack of evidence showing their breach. The patient hasn't provided any specific proof of neglect. Therefore, the court should grant summary judgment because the patient hasn't met their burden.

Looking at the options, D seems correct. Proof of an accident alone doesn't establish negligence. So the answer would be D.

The court should grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment because the patient has not provided any evidence of specific conduct or neglect by the hospital that caused the automatic doors to malfunction. To establish negligence, the plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages. Here, the patient failed to provide evidence of a breach, such as improper maintenance. Without such evidence, the claim cannot proceed. 

While res ipsa loquitur might seem applicable, it requires the plaintiff to show that the injury typically results from negligence and that the defendant controls the instrumentality. However, the patient has not met this burden. Additionally, the mere occurrence of an accident does not, by itself, establish negligence. Therefore, the hospital is entitled to summary judgment.
