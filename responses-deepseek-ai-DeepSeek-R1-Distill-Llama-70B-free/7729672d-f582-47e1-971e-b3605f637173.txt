Alright, so I've got this question about Darwin's theories and which statement he would have rejected. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking which option is something Darwin would have rejected. The options are A, B, and C. Let me read each one carefully.

Option A says, "Environmental change plays a role in evolution." Hmm, I remember that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection does involve the environment. Like, the environment presents challenges, and organisms with traits better suited to that environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. So environmental change would definitely play a role. So A is probably something Darwin would agree with, not reject.

Option B: "The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism." Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think in modern evolutionary theory, evolution occurs at the population level, not individual. So the smallest unit is the population because evolution is about changes in allele frequencies in a population over time. An individual can't evolve on its own because evolution is about heritable changes passed to offspring. So if B says the smallest is an individual, that's probably incorrect. But wait, did Darwin think that way? I recall that Darwin's original ideas were a bit different from the modern synthesis. Darwin focused more on individuals and their variations, but I'm not sure if he considered populations as the unit. Wait, no, I think he believed that species could change over time, so maybe he didn't think in terms of populations as the smallest unit. Or perhaps he didn't have the same understanding as we do now with the population genetics perspective. So if B says the smallest is an individual, that would be incorrect according to modern theory, but what about Darwin's view?

Option C: "Inherited variation in a population is a necessary precondition for natural selection to operate." Yes, Darwin's theory definitely requires variation. Natural selection can only act on existing heritable variation. Without it, there's nothing for selection to work on. So C is definitely something he would agree with, not reject.

So the question is which statement Darwin would reject. Let me think again about each option.

Option B says the smallest entity is the individual. Modern evolutionary theory would say it's the population because natural selection acts on variation within populations, leading to changes in population gene pools. So the smallest unit of evolution is the population, not the individual. But what about Darwin? Did he see individuals as evolving, or populations?

From what I remember, Darwin's On the Origin of Species talks about species changing, but he didn't have the concept of population genetics. He might have thought in terms of individual variation leading to species change. So he might have agreed that individuals are the units, but I think in reality, evolution doesn't happen to individuals; it's populations that evolve. So the statement in B would be incorrect, and perhaps Darwin would have rejected it if he agreed with the idea that it's the population, but wait, no—Darwin's time didn't have that understanding. So maybe he would have accepted B as correct, thinking that individual variation leads to change.

Wait, but the question is about what Darwin would reject. So if B is an incorrect statement, and Darwin would have agreed with it, then that's not the answer. Alternatively, if B is correct, then the answer would be something else.

Wait, let me clarify. The modern view is that the smallest unit of evolution is the population, not the individual. So statement B is incorrect. But the question is whether Darwin would have rejected it. If Darwin believed that individuals are the units (which I'm not certain about), then he would have accepted B, and thus the statement that he would reject is not B. Alternatively, if B is a correct statement, then perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is about whether selection acts on individuals. Natural selection does act on individuals, but the changes occur in the population. So the smallest unit that evolves is the population. So B is incorrect; the smallest is the population, not the individual. So if B is incorrect, then the answer would be B, because the statement is wrong, and Darwin would have rejected it if he thought the population is the unit. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up concepts. The unit of selection is the individual—natural selection acts on individuals because they have varying traits. But the unit of evolution (i.e., where evolutionary change occurs) is the population. So the smallest entity that can evolve is the population, not the individual. So statement B is incorrect. So if the question is which statement would Darwin have rejected, and B is incorrect, then Darwin would have rejected B.

But wait, did Darwin think in terms of populations? I think he didn't have that concept clearly. He focused more on species and individual variations, so perhaps he would have agreed that individuals are the smallest entities that evolve. So B would be a correct statement from his perspective, but in reality, it's incorrect. So the question is which statement would he have rejected. So if the statement is incorrect, he would have rejected it. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me approach this differently. Let's recall each statement:

A: Environmental change plays a role. Darwin definitely agreed, as environment is key in natural selection.

B: Smallest entity is individual. Modern theory says population, but Darwin might have thought individual.

C: Inherited variation is necessary. Definitely true, as without variation, no selection.

So the incorrect statement is B, which claims individual is the smallest unit. Since modern theory says population, but the question is about Darwin's view. If Darwin thought that individuals are the units, then B would be correct in his view, so he wouldn't reject it. Alternatively, if B is incorrect, then the answer is B.

Wait, but the question is which statement he would have rejected. So if B is incorrect, he would have rejected it. Alternatively, if he agreed with B, then the answer is not B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again.

Which statement would Darwin have rejected?

Option B: The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism.

Wait, I think that in Darwin's time, the idea of 'evolving' was more about species changing over time, but he didn't have the population genetics perspective. So in his view, perhaps he thought that species evolve, and individuals are just part of that process. But he might not have considered that individuals themselves evolve. Alternatively, natural selection acts on individuals, but the evolution occurs in populations. So the smallest unit is the population, so B is incorrect. So the statement in B is false, which means that Darwin would have rejected it if he agreed that populations are the units, but I don't think he did. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because the statement is incorrect, and the question is which statement Darwin would have rejected. So the incorrect statement is B, so the answer is B.

To determine which statement Darwin would have rejected, let's analyze each option:

**Option A:** "Environmental change plays a role in evolution."  
Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection emphasizes the role of the environment in driving evolutionary change. The environment presents challenges, and individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Therefore, Darwin would have agreed with this statement.

**Option B:** "The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism."  
Modern evolutionary theory states that the smallest unit of evolution is the population, as evolution is defined by changes in allele frequencies within populations over time. However, Darwin's understanding of evolution was less precise and did not explicitly recognize populations as the fundamental unit of evolution. Instead, he focused on individual variation and species-level changes. From Darwin's perspective, he might have accepted the idea that individuals are the smallest entities that evolve, even though this is incorrect according to modern theory. Thus, Darwin would not have rejected this statement.

**Option C:** "Inherited variation in a population is a necessary precondition for natural selection to operate."  
Darwin's theory of natural selection requires heritable variation as the raw material for selection. Without inherited variation, natural selection cannot act. Therefore, Darwin would have agreed with this statement.

The question asks which statement Darwin would have rejected. Since Option B is incorrect according to modern evolutionary theory and Darwin might have accepted it based on his understanding, the correct answer is **B**.
