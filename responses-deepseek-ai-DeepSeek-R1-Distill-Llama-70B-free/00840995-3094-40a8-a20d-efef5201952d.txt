Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the area of a polygon formed by connecting the x- and y-intercepts of the function f(x) = [(x-2)^2 - 9]/3. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that to find the intercepts of a graph, I need to find where it crosses the x-axis and y-axis. For the x-intercepts, that's where y=0, so I set f(x) to zero and solve for x. For the y-intercept, that's where x=0, so I plug in x=0 into the function.

So starting with the x-intercepts. The function is f(x) = [(x-2)^2 - 9]/3. Setting that equal to zero:

0 = [(x-2)^2 - 9]/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives (x-2)^2 - 9 = 0. So (x-2)^2 = 9. Taking square roots, x-2 = ±3. That means x = 2 + 3 = 5 and x = 2 - 3 = -1. So the x-intercepts are at (5, 0) and (-1, 0).

Wait, but wait a second. The equation is quadratic, so I expect two x-intercepts, which I found, 5 and -1. Got it.

Now for the y-intercept. That's when x=0. Plugging x=0 into f(x):

f(0) = [(0-2)^2 - 9]/3 = [(4) -9]/3 = (-5)/3 ≈ -1.666... So the y-intercept is at (0, -5/3).

Wait, but the problem says that the x and y intercepts are connected to form a polygon. Wait, intercepts are points. So how many points do we have? Well, the x-intercepts are two points: (5,0) and (-1,0). And the y-intercept is one point: (0, -5/3). So connecting these three points would form a triangle.

So the polygon is a triangle with vertices at (5,0), (-1,0), and (0, -5/3). I need to find the area of this triangle.

Hmm, how do I find the area of a triangle given three points? I think there are a couple of methods. One is using the formula for the area with coordinates, maybe the shoelace formula. Or, since two points are on the x-axis, perhaps I can treat the base as the distance between them and then find the height from the y-intercept.

Let me think. The two x-intercepts are on the x-axis, so the base is between (5,0) and (-1,0). The distance between them is 5 - (-1) = 6 units. So the base is 6 units. Now, the height would be the vertical distance from the y-intercept to the x-axis. Since the y-intercept is at (0, -5/3), the vertical distance is | -5/3 | = 5/3 units.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height)/2. So plugging in, (6 * 5/3)/2. Let's compute that: 6 times 5 is 30; divided by 3 is 10; divided by 2 is 5. So the area would be 5.

But wait, the options have 5 as option B. Or wait, did I make a mistake here? Because I thought the base is between (5,0) and (-1,0), which is 6 units. The height is the distance from the y-intercept to the x-axis, which is 5/3. So 6 * 5/3 is 10, then divided by 2 is 5. So that would be answer B.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check using the shoelace formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The shoelace formula is given by for points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), the area is |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|.

Let me list the points: let's take them in order as (5,0), (-1,0), (0,-5/3).

Plugging into the formula:

Area = | (5*(0 - (-5/3)) + (-1)*(-5/3 - 0) + 0*(0 - 0) ) / 2 |

Compute each term:

First term: 5*(0 +5/3) = 5*(5/3) = 25/3

Second term: (-1)*(-5/3 -0) = (-1)*(-5/3) = 5/3

Third term: 0*(0-0)=0

Add them up: 25/3 +5/3 +0 = 30/3 =10

Take absolute value (which is still 10) and divide by 2: 10/2=5.

So that's the same result. So the area is 5, which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I possibly mix up the points? Because the shoelace formula depends on the order of the points. Let me try a different order, maybe (5,0), (0,-5/3), (-1,0).

Compute again:

First term:5*( (-5/3 - 0) )=5*(-5/3)= -25/3

Second term: 0*(0 - 0)=0

Third term: (-1)*(0 - (-5/3))= (-1)*(5/3)= -5/3

Sum: -25/3 +0 + (-5/3) = (-30/3) = -10

Absolute value is 10, divided by 2 is 5. Same result.

Alternatively, maybe I should visualize the triangle. The two points on the x-axis are 6 units apart, so the base is 6. The height is from (0,-5/3) to the x-axis, which is 5/3 units. So area (1/2)*6*(5/3)= (1/2)*(30/3)= (1/2)*10=5. Yep, same answer.

So I think the correct answer is B:5.

To determine the area of the polygon formed by connecting the intercepts of the function \( f(x) = \frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3} \), we first find the intercepts:

1. **X-intercepts**: Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   0 = \frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3}
   \]
   Multiply through by 3:
   \[
   (x-2)^2 - 9 = 0 \implies (x-2)^2 = 9 \implies x-2 = \pm 3 \implies x = 5 \text{ or } x = -1
   \]
   Thus, the x-intercepts are at \( (5, 0) \) and \( (-1, 0) \).

2. **Y-intercept**: Set \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   f(0) = \frac{(0-2)^2 - 9}{3} = \frac{4 - 9}{3} = \frac{-5}{3}
   \]
   Thus, the y-intercept is at \( (0, -\frac{5}{3}) \).

The intercepts form a triangle with vertices at \( (5, 0) \), \( (-1, 0) \), and \( (0, -\frac{5}{3}) \). To find the area of this triangle:

- The base is the distance between the x-intercepts \( (5, 0) \) and \( (-1, 0) \):
  \[
  \text{Base} = 5 - (-1) = 6
  \]

- The height is the vertical distance from the y-intercept \( (0, -\frac{5}{3}) \) to the x-axis:
  \[
  \text{Height} = \left| -\frac{5}{3} \right| = \frac{5}{3}
  \]

- The area of the triangle is given by:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Base} \cdot \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 = 5
  \]

Thus, the area of the polygon is \( 5 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
