Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Ashford's article. The question is asking what particular paralysis Ashford is addressing. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Ashford wrote an article, probably in response to someone else's arguments. I think it's related to Peter Singer, who often discusses ethical obligations to help others, especially in global poverty. Singer's arguments usually emphasize that individuals in wealthier nations should give more to help those in need, sometimes to the point of sacrificing their own wealth.

So, Ashford is addressing a paralysis, which I take to mean a kind of inability to act or a dilemma. The options that stand out to me are C, D, and maybe B or F. Let me think through each.

Option C says: having to give up so much of our own wealth in light of Singer's arguments. That makes sense because Singer does argue that people should give until it's no longer a significant sacrifice. But is Ashford addressing the difficulty of giving up wealth, or something else?

Option D is about choosing between addressing immediate harm and structural injustice. That rings a bell. I think Ashford's argument is more about the trade-offs between different types of actions. Like, should we focus on immediate needs, such as feeding the hungry, or work on long-term structural changes to prevent poverty? This seems like a paralysis because it's a tough choice between two important goals.

Option B says the impossibility of meeting everyone's basic needs. That doesn't sound quite right. It's more about whether it's possible, but Ashford's point is more about the choice between different approaches rather than the possibility.

Option F is about prioritizing multiple global issues. That's a bit broader, but the question is about a specific paralysis, so maybe not.

So, putting it together, I think Ashford is addressing the paralysis that comes from having to choose between immediate help (like saving lives) and working on structural changes that address the root causes. This is a common ethical dilemma in global aid and development.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.
