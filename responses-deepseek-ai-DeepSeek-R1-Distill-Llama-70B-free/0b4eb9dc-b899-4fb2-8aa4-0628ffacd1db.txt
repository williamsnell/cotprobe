Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about two partners, Boy Alcott and Jon Buxton, who are in a steel company. They share the net income based on their average investments during the year. The net profit is $8,736, and I need to find each partner's share.

Hmm, I remember that when partners share profits based on their investments, it's usually about their capital contributions. Since they're sharing in proportion to their average investments, I think I need to calculate the average amount each partner had invested throughout the year.

Let me break down the timeline of their investments and withdrawals:

- On January 1:
  - Alcott invests $4,000.
  - Buxton invests $5,000.

- On May 1 (which is the 5th month):
  - Alcott adds $2,000.
  - Buxton adds $1,750.

- On September 1 (the 9th month):
  - Alcott withdraws $500.

- On November 1 (the 11th month):
  - Both invest an additional $2,000 each.

Wait, I think I should calculate each partner's investment on each date and then figure out the average.

I think the way to approach this is to calculate the total investment each partner has made during each period and then find the weighted average based on the time each amount was active during the year. Because the investments change at different times, I need to compute the duration each contribution was present.

So, let's start by listing the dates and what happens each time, then compute the duration in months each investment amount applies.

Starting with Boy Alcott:

1. Jan 1: Invests $4,000. This stays until May 1 when he adds more.
   - So from Jan 1 to April 30: 4 months at $4,000.

2. May 1: He adds $2,000, so now his total investment is $6,000 ($4k + $2k). This continues until September 1 when he withdraws some.

   - May to August: 4 months (May, June, July, August) at $6,000.

3. September 1: He withdraws $500, so his investment becomes $5,500 ($6k - $500). This remains until November 1.

   - September 1 to October 31: 2 months at $5,500.

4. November 1: He invests another $2,000, making his total $7,500. This lasts from November to December, which is 2 months.

So Alcott's investments and periods are:

- $4,000 for 4 months
- $6,000 for 4 months
- $5,500 for 2 months
- $7,500 for 2 months.

Wait, let me double-check the months:

From Jan 1 to May 1 is 4 months (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr) because May 1 is the start of the next period.

Similarly, May 1 to September 1 is 4 months (May, June, July, Aug).

September 1 to November 1 is 2 months (Sept, Oct).

November 1 to Dec 31 is 2 months (Nov, Dec). That adds up to 12 months, so that seems correct.

Now, let's compute the average investment for Alcott.

The formula for average investment is the sum of (investment amount * duration) divided by total duration (12 months).

So for Alcott:

(4,000 * 4) + (6,000 * 4) + (5,500 * 2) + (7,500 * 2) all divided by 12.

Let me calculate each part:

4,000 *4 = 16,000
6,000 *4=24,000
5,500 *2=11,000
7,500 *2=15,000

Summing these: 16,000 +24,000 =40,000; 40,000+11,000=51,000; 51,000+15,000=66,000.

So 66,000 divided by 12 months is $5,500 average investment for Alcott.

Wait, wait, that seems a bit high, but let's proceed.

Now for Jon Buxton:

1. Jan 1: Invests $5,000. This stays until May 1, so 4 months at $5k.

2. May 1: He adds $1,750, making it $6,750. This continues until November 1.

Wait, no, until November 1. Wait, let me see the timeline again. The next change is on September 1, but that's only Alcott. So Buxton's next change is November 1.

So from May 1 to October 31: that's 6 months (May, June, July, Aug, Sept, Oct).

But wait, let me recount.

From May 1 to August is 4 months (May, June, July, August). Then September 1 is another change for Alcott but not Buxton. So Buxton's $6,750 continues until November 1.

So from May 1 to October 31 is 6 months (May, June, July, August, September, October). Then on November 1, he adds another $2,000, making his total $8,750.

So Buxton's investment periods are:

- $5,000 for 4 months (Jan to Apr)
- $6,750 for 6 months (May to Oct)
- $8,750 for 2 months (Nov and Dec)

Now compute Buxton's average investment:

(5,000 *4) + (6,750 *6) + (8,750 *2) all divided by 12.

Calculating each part:

5,000 *4=20,000
6,750 *6=40,500
8,750 *2=17,500

Summing these: 20,000 +40,500=60,500; 60,500 +17,500=78,000.

78,000 divided by 12 is $6,500 average for Buxton.

Wait, so Alcott's average is $5,500 and Buxton's is $6,500. Let me check if I did that correctly.

Wait, wait, for Buxton, from May 1 to November 1 is 6 months? Let me recount.

May is the 5th month, so May 1 to May 31 is 1 month. Then June, July, August, September, October: that's 6 months in total, yes.

So 4 (Jan-Apr) +6 (May-Oct) +2 (Nov-Dec)=12, correct.

So the average investments are Alcott $5,500 and Buxton $6,500.

Wait, but let me check the average calculation again for Alcott. 

Alcott's calculation:

4,000 *4=16,000

6,000 *4=24,000

5,500 *2=11,000

7,500 *2=15,000

Total: 16+24=40; 40+11=51; 51+15=66. So 66,000/12=5,500.

Yes. And Buxton's 78,000/12=6,500.

So the total average investment is 5,500 +6,500=12,000. The ratio of their investments is 5,500 :6,500, which can be simplified. Let's see, both divided by 100: 55:65. Then, 5:6.25? Wait, 55/5=11, 65/5=13. So 11:13.

Wait, wait no. Let me compute the ratio correctly.

Alcott's average:5,500.

Buxton's:6,500.

Total average investment: 12,000.

So the profit is $8,736, which is to be divided in proportion to their average investments.

So each partner's share would be (their average / total average) * total profit.

So for Alcott: (5,500 / 12,000) *8,736.

Similarly for Buxton: (6,500 /12,000)*8,736.

Let me compute these.

First, 5,500 /12,000 = 11/24.

Because 5,500 is 11*500, 12,000 is 24*500. So 11/24.

Similarly, 6,500/12,000=13/24.

So Alcott's share is 11/24 of 8,736.

Let me compute 8,736 * (11/24).

Divide 8,736 by 24 first.

24 * 364 = 8,736 (because 24*300=7,200; 24*64=1,536; 7,200+1,536=8,736).

So 8,736 /24=364.

Then 364 *11=4,004.

So Alcott gets $4,004.

Buxton's share would be 13/24 of 8,736.

Which is 364 *13.

Calculate 364 *10=3,640; 364*3=1,092. So 3,640 +1,092=4,732.

So Buxton gets $4,732.

Looking at the options, option B is Alcott:4,004 and Buxton:4,732.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine each partner's share of the profit, we first calculate the average investment for Boy Alcott and Jon Buxton over the year. The profit is shared in proportion to their average investments.

### Boy Alcott's Investments:
1. **January 1 to April 30**: $4,000 for 4 months.
2. **May 1 to August 31**: $6,000 for 4 months.
3. **September 1 to October 31**: $5,500 for 2 months.
4. **November 1 to December 31**: $7,500 for 2 months.

The average investment is calculated as:

\[
\text{Average Investment (Alcott)} = \frac{(4,000 \times 4) + (6,000 \times 4) + (5,500 \times 2) + (7,500 \times 2)}{12}
\]

\[
= \frac{16,000 + 24,000 + 11,000 + 15,000}{12} = \frac{66,000}{12} = 5,500
\]

### Jon Buxton's Investments:
1. **January 1 to April 30**: $5,000 for 4 months.
2. **May 1 to October 31**: $6,750 for 6 months.
3. **November 1 to December 31**: $8,750 for 2 months.

The average investment is calculated as:

\[
\text{Average Investment (Buxton)} = \frac{(5,000 \times 4) + (6,750 \times 6) + (8,750 \times 2)}{12}
\]

\[
= \frac{20,000 + 40,500 + 17,500}{12} = \frac{78,000}{12} = 6,500
\]

### Profit Sharing:
The total average investment is:

\[
\text{Total Average Investment} = 5,500 + 6,500 = 12,000
\]

The profit is shared in proportion to their average investments:

\[
\text{Alcott's Share} = \frac{5,500}{12,000} \times 8,736 = \frac{11}{24} \times 8,736 = 4,004
\]

\[
\text{Buxton's Share} = \frac{6,500}{12,000} \times 8,736 = \frac{13}{24} \times 8,736 = 4,732
\]

### Final Answer:
- **Alcott's Share**: $4,004  
- **Buxton's Share**: $4,732  

The correct option is **B**.
