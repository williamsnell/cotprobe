Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: If 4 daps equal 7 yaps, and 5 yaps equal 3 baps, how many daps equal 42 baps? The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, so this seems like a unit conversion problem where I have to convert baps to daps using yaps as an intermediate step. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to relate daps to yaps. The problem states that 4 daps = 7 yaps. So, I can write this as a ratio: 4 daps / 7 yaps. This means that 1 dap is equal to 7/4 yaps, but wait, actually, to get daps in terms of yaps, it's better to think in terms of conversion factors.

So, if I have daps and I want to convert them to yaps, I can multiply by 7 yaps per 4 daps. But in this problem, I think I need to go from baps to yaps to daps, so maybe I should find out how many yaps are in baps first.

The second part says 5 yaps equal 3 baps. So, 5 yaps = 3 baps. So, the ratio here would be 5 yaps / 3 baps, meaning that 1 bap is equal to 5/3 yaps. Alternatively, to get yaps from baps, I can multiply by (5 yaps / 3 baps).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If 5 yaps = 3 baps, then 1 bap is equal to 5/3 yaps. So, to convert baps to yaps, I multiply by 5/3. So, 42 baps times (5 yaps / 3 baps) would give me the number of yaps.

Let me calculate that first. 42 baps * (5 yaps / 3 baps) = (42 *5)/3 yaps. 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 14 *5 is 70. So, 42 baps equal 70 yaps.

Now that I have 70 yaps, I need to convert that into daps using the first ratio, which is 4 daps =7 yaps. So, how many daps are in 70 yaps?

So, the ratio is 4 daps /7 yaps. So, to find out how many daps 70 yaps are, I can set up the equation: daps = yaps * (4 daps /7 yaps). The yaps unit cancels out.

So, plugging in the numbers: daps = 70 yaps * (4 daps /7 yaps) = (70 *4)/7 daps. 70 divided by 7 is 10, so 10 *4 is 40. So, 40 daps.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, converting baps to yaps: 42 * (5/3) = 70 yaps. Then, converting yaps to daps: 70 * (4/7) = 40 daps. That makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of it as setting up a chain of conversion factors. So, 42 baps * (5 yaps /3 baps) * (4 daps /7 yaps). The baps and yaps units should cancel out, leaving daps. Let's compute this:

42 *5 *4 divided by (3 *7) = (42*5*4)/(21) = (840)/(21) = 40. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be 40 daps. Looking at the options, option B is 40. So I think B is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we need to convert baps to daps using yaps as an intermediate unit.

1. **Convert baps to yaps**:  
   Given that \(5 \, \text{yaps} = 3 \, \text{baps}\), the conversion factor is \(\frac{5 \, \text{yaps}}{3 \, \text{baps}}\).  
   For \(42 \, \text{baps}\):  
   \[
   42 \, \text{baps} \times \frac{5 \, \text{yaps}}{3 \, \text{baps}} = \frac{42 \times 5}{3} \, \text{yaps} = 70 \, \text{yaps}.
   \]

2. **Convert yaps to daps**:  
   Given that \(4 \, \text{daps} = 7 \, \text{yaps}\), the conversion factor is \(\frac{4 \, \text{daps}}{7 \, \text{yaps}}\).  
   For \(70 \, \text{yaps}\):  
   \[
   70 \, \text{yaps} \times \frac{4 \, \text{daps}}{7 \, \text{yaps}} = \frac{70 \times 4}{7} \, \text{daps} = 40 \, \text{daps}.
   \]

Thus, \(42 \, \text{baps} = 40 \, \text{daps}\). The correct answer is **B**.
