Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the gypsy moth and the diffusion of a natural attractant. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that the attractant is C18H34O3. A female moth is trapped behind a cellophane screen with a pinhole. The carbon dioxide she produces diffuses through the pinhole at a rate of 1 millimicromole per 90 seconds. The question is asking what quantity of the attractant will diffuse through the orifice in the same time, 90 seconds. And there are multiple choice options from A to J.

Wait, I remember something about Graham's Law of Effusion. Oh right, Graham's Law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. So the lighter the gas, the faster it effuses. 

So, the formula is Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where M is molar mass. Because here, the rates are given in terms of millimicromoles per time, so I think the rates can be compared directly.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The rate of diffusion is proportional to the molar concentration gradient and inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. But in this case, since both gases are diffusing through the same orifice, perhaps under similar conditions, the main factor is the molar mass.

So, let's compute the molar masses of CO2 and the attractant.

Carbon dioxide is CO2: Carbon is about 12 g/mol, oxygen is 16 each. So 12 + 2*16 = 44 g/mol.

The attractant is C18H34O3. Let's calculate that. Carbon: 18 *12 = 216. Hydrogen: 34 *1 =34. Oxygen: 3 *16=48. So total is 216 +34 +48 = 298 g/mol.

So M1 (CO2) is 44, M2 (attractant) is 298.

Wait, but wait, wait. The problem says that the CO2 is diffusing at a certain rate, and we need to find the rate of the attractant. So we can set up the ratio of their rates.

Let me write it out. Rate_CO2 / Rate_Attractant = sqrt( M_Attractant / M_CO2 )

Because Rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So the heavier the molecule, the slower it diffuses.

Given that Rate_CO2 is 1 millimicromole per 90 seconds, and we're looking for Rate_Attractant.

So plugging in the numbers:

1 / Rate_Attractant = sqrt(298 /44)

Wait, let me compute that. 298 divided by 44. Let me calculate:

44 times 6 is 264, 44*6.77 is around 44*(6.77) = let's see, 6*44=264, 0.77*44=33.88, so 264+33.88=297.88, which is about 298. So approximately 6.77.

So sqrt(6.77) is around 2.6, because 2.6 squared is 6.76, which is close.

So 1/Rate_Attractant ≈ 2.6 → Rate_Attractant ≈ 1 / 2.6 ≈ 0.3846 millimicromoles per 90 seconds.

Wait, but let me do a more accurate calculation for the square root.

Compute sqrt(298/44) = sqrt(6.7727). Let me see, 2.6^2 is 6.76, 2.6 squared is 6.76. 2.6^2 = 6.76 exactly. So 6.7727 is a bit more. Let's see, 2.6 * 2.6 =6.76, 2.6005^2= (approx) 2.6^2 + 2*2.6*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2. So about 6.76 + 0.0026 + 0.00000025 ≈6.7626, which is less than 6.7727. Hmm, perhaps it's about 2.602.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute sqrt(6.7727) more accurately. Let's approximate it.

We know 2.6^2=6.76. 2.605^2 = ?

2.605 * 2.605: Let's compute step by step.

2.6 * 2.6 = 6.76.

0.005 * 2.605 = 0.013025.

But wait, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Let a=2.6, b=0.005.

So (2.6+0.005)^2 = (2.6)^2 + 2*(2.6)*(0.005) + (0.005)^2 = 6.76 + 0.026 + 0.000025 = 6.786025.

But wait, 6.7727 is between 6.76 and 6.786. So, let's find x where (2.6 + x)^2 =6.7727.

Expanding, 2.6^2 + 2*2.6*x + x^2 =6.7727.

6.76 + 5.2 x + x² =6.7727.

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible.

So 5.2 x ≈ 6.7727-6.76=0.0127.

x≈0.0127/5.2 ≈0.00244.

So sqrt(6.7727) ≈2.6 + 0.00244≈2.6024.

So approximately 2.6024.

So 1/Rate_Attractant=2.6024 → Rate_Attractant=1/2.6024≈ 0.3843.

So about 0.3843 millimicromoles per 90 seconds.

Looking at the options, let's see what's available.

Options are:

A: 0.25 

B:0.45 

C:0.40 

D:0.48 

E:0.42 

F:0.30 

G:0.35 

H:0.34 

I:0.38 

J:0.50.

So 0.3843 is approximately 0.38, which is option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the molar masses.

CO2: C is 12, O is 16. So 12 + 2*16=44. Correct.

Attractant: C18H34O3.

C: 18 *12=216.

H:34 *1=34.

O:3 *16=48.

Total: 216+34=250; 250+48=298. Correct.

So the molar masses are right.

Graham's law says Rate ∝ 1/√M.

So Rate CO2 / Rate Attractant = sqrt( M_Attractant / M_CO2 )

So Rate Attractant = Rate CO2 * sqrt( M_CO2 / M_Attractant )

Wait, wait a minute! Did I get that inverted before?

Because Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where M1 and M2 are the molar masses.

Wait, let me get that straight. The rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1).

So if gas 1 is CO2 (M1=44), and gas 2 is the attractant (M2=298), then Rate_CO2 / Rate_Attractant = sqrt(298/44) → which was what I did earlier. So Rate_Attractant = Rate_CO2 / sqrt(298/44) → which is Rate_CO2 * sqrt(44/298).

Wait, but that's the same as 1 * sqrt(44/298) → since Rate_CO2 is 1.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(44/298). 44/298 ≈ 0.1477. sqrt(0.1477)≈0.384. So yes, same as before.

So yes, the Rate_Attractant is about 0.384, which is option I: 0.38.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use Graham's Law of Effusion, which states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. The formula is:

\[
\frac{\text{Rate}_1}{\text{Rate}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}
\]

Here:
- \( M_1 \) is the molar mass of CO\(_2\) (44 g/mol),
- \( M_2 \) is the molar mass of the attractant (C\(_{18}\)H\(_{34}\)O\(_3\), calculated as 298 g/mol),
- \(\text{Rate}_1\) is the rate of CO\(_2\) diffusion (1 millimicromole per 90 seconds),
- \(\text{Rate}_2\) is the rate of the attractant diffusion, which we need to find.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(\text{Rate}_2\):

\[
\text{Rate}_2 = \text{Rate}_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{M_1}{M_2}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Rate}_2 = 1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{44}{298}}
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{44}{298} \approx 0.1477
\]

Then, take the square root:

\[
\sqrt{0.1477} \approx 0.384
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Rate}_2 \approx 0.384 \, \text{millimicromoles per 90 seconds}
\]

From the given options, the closest value to 0.384 is **0.38 millimicromoles**, which corresponds to option **I**.
