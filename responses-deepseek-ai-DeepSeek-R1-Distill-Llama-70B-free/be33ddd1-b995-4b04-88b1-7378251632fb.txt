Okay, so I have this accounting problem here about calculating ending inventory using the gross profit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully. The Alfors Company's beginning inventory is $30,000 as of January 1, 1974. During the year, they made purchases totaling $87,500, and their net sales were $102,000. The gross profit rate is given as 40% of net sales. I need to find the ending inventory using the gross profit method.

Wait, what's the gross profit method again? I think it's a way to estimate ending inventory when the actual figure isn't known. It's based on the relationship between sales, cost of goods sold, and gross profit.

So, the formula I remember is: Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold. But wait, how do I find the Cost of Goods Sold?

Oh right, the gross profit is calculated as a percentage of net sales. Since the gross profit rate is 40%, that means Gross Profit = 40% of Net Sales. So first, I'll calculate the gross profit.

Net sales are $102,000. So 40% of that is 0.4 * 102,000 = $40,800. That's the gross profit.

Now, I know that Gross Profit = Net Sales - Cost of Goods Sold. So rearranging that, Cost of Goods Sold = Net Sales - Gross Profit. Let me plug in the numbers.

COGS = 102,000 - 40,800 = $61,200. Okay, so the cost of goods sold for the year is $61,200.

Now, the formula for ending inventory is Beginning Inventory + Purchases - COGS. So let me add up the beginning inventory and purchases.

Beginning Inventory is $30,000 and Purchases are $87,500. So 30,000 + 87,500 = $117,500.

Subtracting COGS from that, 117,500 - 61,200 = $56,300. So the ending inventory should be $56,300.

Looking at the options, option D is $56,300. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake in calculations. Let me recalculate the COGS again. Net sales 102,000 minus gross profit 40,800 gives 61,200. Yes. Then 30k +87.5k is 117.5k, minus 61.2k gives 56.3k. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the ending inventory using the gross profit method, we start by calculating the cost of goods sold (COGS). The gross profit rate is 40% of net sales, so:

\[
\text{Gross Profit} = 0.4 \times 102,000 = 40,800
\]

Next, COGS is calculated as:

\[
\text{COGS} = \text{Net Sales} - \text{Gross Profit} = 102,000 - 40,800 = 61,200
\]

The formula for ending inventory is:

\[
\text{Ending Inventory} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{COGS}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Ending Inventory} = 30,000 + 87,500 - 61,200 = 56,300
\]

Thus, the ending inventory is $56,300, which corresponds to option D.
