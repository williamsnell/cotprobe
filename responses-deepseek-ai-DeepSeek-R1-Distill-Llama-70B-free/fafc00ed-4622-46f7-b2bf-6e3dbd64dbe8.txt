Question:

This question refers to the following information.
One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.… It is always the people who toil that pay.
—Calvin Coolidge, "Economy in the Interest of All," June 30, 1924

Okay, so I've got this question about Calvin Coolidge and which president would share his sentiments. Let me think through this step by step.

The question provides a quote from Coolidge's speech where he talks about taxation and property rights. He's really emphasizing the importance of limiting taxes because the power to tax is the power to destroy. He says that when the government taxes without urgent necessity, it becomes tyrannical and takes away people's liberty. He also mentions that economy is imperative and that it's the people who toil who end up paying the taxes.

So, Coolidge here is advocating for low taxes, limited government intervention in the economy, and strong protection of property rights. He's against excessive taxation and believes in fiscal conservatism.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which president is known for similar views. Let's go through each option:

A: Dwight D. Eisenhower - He was a Republican, but I think he wasn't as much of a tax cutter as others. He maintained some New Deal policies, so maybe not the best fit.

B: John F. Kennedy - He actually cut taxes, but his approach was more about stimulating the economy. I'm not sure if he was as focused on the philosophical aspect of taxation as Coolidge was.

C: Lyndon B. Johnson - He's known for the Great Society programs, which involved a lot of government spending and social policies. That seems opposite to Coolidge's views.

D: George W. Bush - He did cut taxes, especially with the Bush tax cuts. But his policies also involved significant spending, like on the military and the War on Terror. So maybe part of his approach aligns, but not entirely.

E: Ronald Reagan - Reagan is famous for his tax cuts and his belief in limited government. He often spoke about reducing government spending and lowering taxes to stimulate economic growth. His philosophy aligns closely with Coolidge's sentiments about protecting property rights and being cautious about taxation.

F: Bill Clinton - He raised taxes early in his presidency, though he also reformed welfare. Doesn't seem to match Coolidge's low-tax stance.

G: Barack Obama - He increased taxes, especially on higher incomes, and expanded government programs like Obamacare. Definitely not aligned with Coolidge.

H: Franklin D. Roosevelt - He implemented the New Deal, which involved heavy government intervention and taxation. Opposite of Coolidge's views.

I: Jimmy Carter - His economic policies were more about regulation and he faced stagflation. Not a tax cutter.

J: Richard Nixon - While he did some economic policies like price controls, he's not known for being a staunch advocate of low taxes and limited government in the way Coolidge was.

So, putting it all together, Ronald Reagan (option E) is the most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments because he championed tax cuts, limited government, and protected property rights, closely mirroring Coolidge's philosophy.

The correct answer is E: Ronald Reagan. Coolidge's emphasis on limited taxation, protection of property rights, and fiscal conservatism aligns closely with Reagan's policies and philosophy, which included significant tax cuts and a commitment to reducing government intervention.
