Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. Then, nine days later, at noon again, only 45 grams remain. The question is asking, to the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams left?

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential model. The formula I think is something like N(t) = N0 * e^(-kt), where N0 is the initial amount, N(t) is the amount at time t, and k is the decay constant. But wait, sometimes I've seen it written as N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / half-life). Maybe I can use either approach.

Wait, but the problem gives me two data points: at t=0, N=50g, and at t=9 days, N=45g. I need to find the time when N=20g. So first, I think I need to find the decay constant k.

Let me write down the formula again. N(t) = N0 * e^(-kt). So plugging in the values I have:

At t=9 days, N=45g, N0=50g.

So 45 = 50 * e^(-k*9). I can divide both sides by 50 to get 0.9 = e^(-9k). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, ln(0.9) = -9k. So k = -ln(0.9)/9.

Let me calculate that. ln(0.9) is approximately... I think ln(1) is 0, ln(0.9) is negative. Let me get exact value. Using a calculator, ln(0.9) ≈ -0.1053605. So -ln(0.9) is 0.1053605. Divide that by 9 gives k ≈ 0.0117134 per day.

Wait, that seems right. So k is approximately 0.0117 per day.

Now, I need to find the time t when N(t) = 20 grams. So using the same formula:

20 = 50 * e^(-0.0117134 * t).

Divide both sides by 50: 0.4 = e^(-0.0117134 t).

Take natural log of both sides: ln(0.4) = -0.0117134 * t.

So t = - ln(0.4) / 0.0117134.

Calculate ln(0.4). Hmm, ln(0.4) is about -0.916291. So negative of that is 0.916291.

So t ≈ 0.916291 / 0.0117134 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.916291 divided by 0.0117134.

Let me compute this. Let's see, 0.0117134 * 78 is approximately how much? 0.0117134 *70 is about 0.81938, 0.0117134*8=0.0937072, so 0.81938 + 0.0937072≈0.913087. Oh, that's close to 0.91629. So 70 + 8 =78 gives around 0.913087, which is a bit less than 0.91629. The difference is about 0.0032. So how much more time is needed?

Each day adds approximately 0.0117134 to the denominator's product. So 0.0032 /0.0117134 ≈ 0.273 days, about a quarter of a day. So t is approximately 78.27 days.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me do the exact division. 0.916291 / 0.0117134.

Let me compute 0.916291 ÷ 0.0117134.

First, 0.0117134 * 78 = 0.9130872 as before.

Subtracting that from 0.916291 gives 0.0032038 remaining.

So 0.0032038 / 0.0117134 ≈ 0.2735 days. So t ≈78.27 days, which would be about 78 days when rounded to the nearest day.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options like 78 (G) or 75 (J), etc. So 78 is an option, choice G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding can cause issues.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the half-life formula to find the decay constant. Let me see if that approach works.

Wait, the half-life formula is T_1/2 = ln(2)/k. So from the decay constant k we found earlier, which was approximately 0.0117134 per day, the half-life would be 0.693147 / 0.0117134.

Calculating that: 0.693147 / 0.0117134 ≈ let's see, 0.0117134 *59 ≈ 0.0117134 *60=0.70284, but 59 would be 0.70284 - 0.0117134 ≈ 0.6911266. So 59 days gives approximately 0.6911, which is close to 0.693147. So the half-life is approximately 59 days. So that would make sense because every 59 days, the material reduces by half.

Wait, but in the problem, after 9 days, it's reduced from 50g to 45g, which is a loss of 5g. So over 9 days, it loses 10% of its mass. That seems faster than a 59-day half-life, which would be about a 50% loss. Hmm, wait perhaps I made a mistake in the half-life calculation.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate the half-life. If k is 0.0117134 per day, then T_1/2 = ln(2)/k ≈ 0.693147 / 0.0117134.

0.693147 / 0.0117134 = let's compute that.

Let me compute 0.693147 ÷ 0.0117134.

Well, 0.0117134 * 59 = 0.691126 as before, which is very close to 0.693147. So the half-life is approximately 59 days. So that makes sense because if after 9 days, it's 45g, which is a 10% loss. So that's much less than a half-life, as expected.

Now, if the half-life is about 59 days, then each half-life reduces it by half. Starting from 50g:

After 1 half-life (59 days): 25g.

But wait, the problem is asking for 20g, which is less than half of 50g, which is 25g. So we need to go beyond one half-life.

Wait, but wait, 50 to 25 is one half-life, 25 to 12.5 is another. So to get to 20g, it's between the first and second half-life.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula is more accurate.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is to find t when N(t)=20g.

We have N(t)=50 e^(-kt).

We already found k ≈ 0.0117134 per day.

So, 20 =50 e^(-0.0117134 t)

So, e^(-0.0117134 t) = 0.4

Taking natural log: -0.0117134 t = ln(0.4) ≈ -0.916291

So t = 0.916291 / 0.0117134 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

Compute 0.916291 ÷ 0.0117134.

Let me compute this division step by step.

0.0117134 × 78 = 0.9130872

As before. Subtract that from 0.916291: 0.916291 -0.9130872=0.0032038.

So now, 0.0032038 ÷ 0.0117134 = approximately 0.2735 days.

So total t ≈78.2735 days, which is about 78.27 days. Rounded to the nearest day, that's 78 days, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check if I made any errors in calculation. Let me compute 0.916291 / 0.0117134 with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula in terms of half-life.

Wait, another approach is to use the decay formula with half-life.

We have T_1/2 = 59 days.

So N(t) = 50 * (1/2)^(t /59).

We want N(t)=20g.

So, 20 =50*(1/2)^(t/59).

Divide both sides by 50: 0.4 = (1/2)^(t/59).

Take natural log: ln(0.4) = (t/59)*ln(0.5).

So t= [ ln(0.4)/ln(0.5) ] *59.

Compute ln(0.4)= -0.916291, ln(0.5)= -0.693147.

So t= (-0.916291 / -0.693147) *59 ≈ (1.323) *59.

Compute 1.323 *59: 1.3 *59=76.7, 0.023*59≈1.357, so total about 76.7 +1.357≈78.057 days, which is approximately 78.06 days. Rounded to nearest day is 78 days, so option G.

But wait, when I calculated using the decay constant, I got 78.27 days, which is about the same as 78.06 here. So both methods point to around 78 days.

Looking at the options, option G is 78. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Because the problem says at 9 days, it's 45g. So let me confirm the decay constant.

From t=9 days, N=45g.

So 45 =50 e^(-9k).

Divide by 50: 0.9= e^(-9k).

Take ln: ln(0.9)= -9k.

So k= -ln(0.9)/9 = ln(10/9)/9 ≈ (0.10536)/9 ≈ 0.011713 per day, as before.

Then, when finding t for N=20:

20=50 e^(-0.011713 t).

So 0.4= e^(-0.011713 t).

ln(0.4)= -0.011713 t → t= ln(0.4)/ (-0.011713) ≈ 0.916291 /0.011713 ≈ about 78.26 days.

So 78.26 rounds to 78 days, so option G.

Another way, perhaps using the rule of thumb for exponential decay, but I think the calculation is solid.

So I think the correct answer is G:78.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay formula:

\[
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}
\]

where \(N_0 = 50 \, \text{g}\) (initial amount), \(N(t)\) is the amount at time \(t\), and \(k\) is the decay constant. The problem provides two data points: at \(t = 0\), \(N(0) = 50 \, \text{g}\), and at \(t = 9 \, \text{days}\), \(N(9) = 45 \, \text{g}\). Using these, we calculate \(k\).

### Step 1: Calculate the decay constant \(k\)
From the formula:

\[
45 = 50 e^{-9k}
\]

Divide through by 50:

\[
0.9 = e^{-9k}
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.9) = -9k
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
k = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9}
\]

Using \(\ln(0.9) \approx -0.1053605\):

\[
k \approx -\frac{-0.1053605}{9} \approx 0.0117134 \, \text{per day}
\]

### Step 2: Find the time \(t\) when \(N(t) = 20 \, \text{g}\)
Using the decay formula again:

\[
20 = 50 e^{-0.0117134t}
\]

Divide through by 50:

\[
0.4 = e^{-0.0117134t}
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.4) = -0.0117134t
\]

Solve for \(t\):

\[
t = -\frac{\ln(0.4)}{0.0117134}
\]

Using \(\ln(0.4) \approx -0.916291\):

\[
t \approx -\frac{-0.916291}{0.0117134} \approx 78.27 \, \text{days}
\]

### Step 3: Round to the nearest day
The calculated time is approximately \(78.27 \, \text{days}\), which rounds to \(78 \, \text{days}\).

### Final Answer:
The time when there will be 20 grams of the isotope is approximately **78 days**.
