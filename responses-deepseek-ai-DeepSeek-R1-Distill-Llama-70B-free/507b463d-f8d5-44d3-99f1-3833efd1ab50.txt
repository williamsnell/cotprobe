Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to compute the kinetic energy of a molecule moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from my classes.

Alright, the question says that air is made of gas molecules moving around, and I need to find the kinetic energy of one such molecule. The speed given is 500 m/s, and the mass is 4.6 × 10^-26 kg. I think kinetic energy is calculated using a specific formula. Oh right, the kinetic energy (K) is equal to (1/2)mv², where m is mass and v is velocity.

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. Yes, K = 0.5 * m * v squared. That makes sense because kinetic energy depends on both mass and the square of speed.

So plugging in the numbers, m is 4.6e-26 kg and v is 500 m/s. Let me calculate v squared first. 500 squared is 250,000. Or in scientific notation, that's 2.5e5.

Now, multiply that by the mass. 4.6e-26 kg * 2.5e5 m²/s². Let me do the exponents first. 1e-26 * 1e5 is 1e-21. Then 4.6 * 2.5 is... let's compute that. 4 times 2.5 is 10, and 0.6 times 2.5 is 1.5, so total 11.5. So combining, it's 11.5e-21.

But wait, that's before the 0.5 factor. So I need to multiply by 0.5. 11.5e-21 * 0.5 is 5.75e-21 J. 

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches 5.75 × 10^-21 J.

Let me scan through the options:

Option I is 5.75 × 10^-21 J. That looks like the correct choice.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to be sure. Did I make any mistakes in the exponents?

So 500 squared is 250,000, which is 2.5e5. Mass is 4.6e-26. Multiplying 4.6e-26 by 2.5e5 gives me 4.6 * 2.5 = 11.5, and exponents are 1e-26 * 1e5 = 1e-21. So yes, 11.5e-21 before multiplying by 0.5. 0.5 of 11.5 is 5.75, so 5.75e-21. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option I.

To compute the kinetic energy \( K \) of a molecule moving with a speed of 500 m/s and a mass of \( 4.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \), we use the formula:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

1. Calculate \( v^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2 = (500)^2 = 250,000 = 2.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]

2. Multiply \( m \) and \( v^2 \):  
   \[
   m \cdot v^2 = (4.6 \times 10^{-26}) \cdot (2.5 \times 10^5) = (4.6 \cdot 2.5) \times 10^{-26+5} = 11.5 \times 10^{-21}
   \]

3. Apply the \( \frac{1}{2} \) factor:  
   \[
   K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 11.5 \times 10^{-21} = 5.75 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}
   \]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: \( 5.75 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J} \)**.
