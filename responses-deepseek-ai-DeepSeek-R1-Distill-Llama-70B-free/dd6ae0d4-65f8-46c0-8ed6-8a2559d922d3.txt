Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that an atom emits a photon of green light with a wavelength of 5200 Angstroms, and the emission time is 2e-10 seconds. I need to estimate the spread of wavelengths in the photon. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. But wait, how does that apply here? I think it has to do with the uncertainty in energy and time. Oh, right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but I'm dealing with wavelength spread, not energy. So maybe I need to relate the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in wavelength.

Let me think. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

If there's an uncertainty in energy, ΔE, that would correspond to an uncertainty in wavelength, Δλ. So I need to find Δλ using the uncertainty principle.

First, I should calculate ΔE using the uncertainty principle. Since Δt is given as 2e-10 seconds, I can plug that into the equation.

Wait, but the formula I remember is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty would be when ΔE Δt equals ħ/2. So, Δt is 2e-10 s. Let me write down the values.

Δt = 2e-10 s.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) ?

Wait wait, let me get that right. The formula is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so solving for ΔE gives ΔE = ħ/(2 Δt).

Wait no, actually, the equation is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So if I have Δt, then ΔE = ħ/(2 Δt). Because if Δt is the uncertainty in time, the energy uncertainty would be inversely proportional to the time uncertainty.

So let me compute ΔE.

h_bar = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ΔE = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 2e-10) )

Wait, denominator is 2 * 2e-10 = 4e-10. So,

ΔE = 1.0545718e-34 / 4e-10 = approx 2.636e-25 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.0545718e-34 divided by 4e-10 is (1.0545718 /4) * 1e-34+10 = 0.26364295e-24 = 2.636e-25 J.

Wait, wait, exponents: 1e-34 / 1e-10 is 1e-24, right? Because 34 - (-10) = 44? No, wait, 1e-34 / 1e-10 = 1e-24. Oh right, because 10^-34 divided by 10^-10 is 10^(-34+10) )= 1e-24. So yeah, 1.05e-34 /4e-10 is (1.05/4)*1e-24 = approximately 0.2625e-24 J, which is 2.625e-25 J. So ΔE is about 2.63e-25 J.

Now, I need to relate this energy uncertainty to wavelength uncertainty. Hmm.

We know E = hc/λ, so ΔE would relate to dλ, the change in wavelength. Let me think about differentials. So, E = hc/λ → dE = -hc (dλ)/λ².

So, dE = hc (dλ)/λ² → wait, no, differential of E with respect to λ is dE/dλ = -hc/λ². So, dE = (-hc/λ²) * dλ. But since we're dealing with magnitudes (uncertainties), we can ignore the negative sign.

So, ΔE ≈ (hc / λ²) * Δλ.

Wait, solving for Δλ, we get Δλ ≈ (ΔE * λ²) / (hc).

Yes, that makes sense. So, I can plug in the values.

I need to compute Δλ.

Given:
λ = 5200 Angstroms. Oh, wait, I need to convert that to meters. 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 5200 Angstroms = 5200e-10 m = 5.2e-7 m.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

Δλ ≈ (ΔE * λ²) / (h c)

We have ΔE = 2.636e-25 J.

So,

Δλ = (2.636e-25 J * (5.2e-7 m)^2) / (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s)

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

First, numerator: 2.636e-25 * (5.2e-7)^2.

Compute (5.2e-7)^2: 5.2 squared is 27.04, and (e-7)^2 is e-14. So 27.04e-14 m².

So, numerator: 2.636e-25 * 27.04e-14 = 2.636 *27.04 = let's compute that.

2.636 *27 = 71.172, 2.636 *0.04=0.10544. So total 71.27744. Then exponents: 1e-25 *1e-14 = 1e-39. So numerator is 71.27744e-39 = 7.127744e-38.

Denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25.

So, Δλ = numerator / denominator = (7.127744e-38) / (1.9878e-25 )

Compute that.

7.127744e-38 / 1.9878e-25 = (7.127744 / 1.9878) * 1e-13.

Compute 7.127744 /1.9878.

Let me approximate: 7.1277 / 1.9878. Let's see, 1.9878 *3=5.9634, 1.9878*3.6= 7.16. So 3.6.

Because 1.9878 *3.6 = 1.9878*3 + 1.9878*0.6 = 5.9634 + 1.19268 = 7.156. That's a bit higher than 7.1277. So maybe 3.59.

So approximately 3.59 * 1e-13 meters.

Wait, 3.59e-13 m. Hmm.

Looking at the options, let's see which one is close.

Looking through options, option I is 7.17e-13 m, which is like twice what I have. Option F is 9.3e-13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait wait. Let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, let's double-check the computation of Δλ.

Δλ ≈ (ΔE * λ²) / (h c)

ΔE is 2.636e-25 J.

λ is 5.2e-7 m.

h is 6.626e-34.

c is 3e8.

So, numerator is (2.636e-25) * (5.2e-7)^2.

(5.2e-7)^2: 5.2 squared is 27.04, squared and multiplied by 1e-14.

So 27.04e-14 m².

So 2.636e-25 * 27.04e-14 = 2.636 *27.04 = 71.18 as before. And exponents: 1e-25 * 1e-14 = 1e-39.

So numerator is 71.18e-39 J·m².

Wait no, wait, the units. Because ΔE is in J, which is kg·m²/s². So (kg·m²/s²) * (m²) → kg·m^4/s².

Denominator is h*c, which is (J·s) * (m/s) → J = kg·m²/s², so (kg·m²/s² * s) ) * (m/s) = kg·m^3/s. Wait, perhaps better to compute numerically.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: use the relation between energy and wavelength uncertainty.

Alternatively, I remember that the uncertainty in wavelength can be approximated by the formula Δλ/λ ≈ ΔE/E.

Because E = hc/λ, so ΔE = hc Δλ / λ² → ΔE / E = (hc Δλ / λ²) / (hc/λ) ) = Δλ / λ.

So, Δλ = λ (ΔE / E).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, since I have ΔE and E, I can compute ΔE/E and multiply by λ to get Δλ.

E is the energy of the photon, which is hc/λ.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (5.2e-7 m) )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, 1.9878e-25 / 5.2e-7 = approx 3.8265e-19 J.

So E ≈ 3.8265e-19 J.

Now, ΔE is 2.636e-25 J. So ΔE/E is (2.636e-25) / (3.8265e-19) = approx 6.89e-7.

So, Δλ = λ * (ΔE/E) = 5.2e-7 m * 6.89e-7.

Multiply 5.2e-7 by 6.89e-7:

5.2 *6.89 is approx 35.828. And 1e-7 *1e-7 =1e-14. So 35.828e-14 m, which is 3.5828e-13 m.

Wait, that's about 3.58e-13 meters.

Looking back at the options, option F is 9.3e-13, option I is 7.17e-13, and option B is 4.8e-13, option H is 1e-12.

Wait, but I thought I had 3.58e-13 m, which is 3.58e-13. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 8.5e-13

B:4.8e-13

C:5.2e-7

D:1.5e-12

E:2.6e-7

F:9.3e-13

G:6e-14

H:1.0e-12

I:7.17e-13

J:3e-14

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 3.58e-13. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me redo the computation.

Let me recompute using the first approach.

Δλ = (ΔE * λ²) / (h c )

We have:

ΔE = 2.636e-25 J

λ =5.2e-7 m

h=6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

So, λ squared is (5.2e-7)^2 = (5.2)^2 * (1e-7)^2 = 27.04 * 1e-14 = 2.704e-13 m².

Wait wait, 5.2e-7 squared is 27.04e-14, which is 2.704e-13 m². Okay.

So, numerator: 2.636e-25 J * 2.704e-13 m² = ?

Multiply 2.636e-25 * 2.704e-13.

2.636 *2.704 = let's compute that.

2 *2.704 =5.408.

0.636 *2.704 = approx 1.720.

So total is approx 5.408 +1.720=7.128.

Exponents: 1e-25 *1e-13 =1e-38.

So numerator is 7.128e-38 J·m².

Denominator: 6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So, denominator is 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So, Δλ = (7.128e-38) / (1.9878e-25 )

Which is 7.128 /1.9878 = approx 3.587.

And exponents: 1e-38 /1e-25 = 1e-13.

So, Δλ≈3.587e-13 m.

Wait, so about 3.587e-13 meters. Now, looking at the options, the closest one is option I:7.17e-13, which is about twice as much. Option B is 4.8e-13, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the numbers.

Let me recalculate the numerator and denominator precisely.

Numerator: 2.636e-25 * (5.2e-7)^2.

5.2e-7 squared is 27.04e-14 = 2.704e-13 m².

So 2.636e-25 * 2.704e-13 = let's compute 2.636 *2.704.

2.636 *2.704:

Let me compute 2.636 * 2.7 = 7.1172.

But 2.704 is 2.7 +0.004.

So 2.636 *0.004=0.010544.

So total is 7.1172 + 0.010544=7.127744.

Exponent: 1e-25 *1e-13 =1e-38.

So numerator is 7.127744e-38.

Denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

So 7.127744e-38 /1.9878e-25 = (7.127744 / 1.9878 ) * 1e-13.

7.127744 ÷1.9878.

Let me compute this division accurately.

Compute 1.9878 *3.6 = 7.16, which is a bit more than 7.1277.

So 3.6 would give 7.16, which is 0.032 higher than 7.1277.

So, 3.6 - (0.032 /1.9878) ≈ 3.6 - 0.016 ≈3.584.

So, approximately 3.584.

So, 3.584e-13 meters.

But looking at the options, the closest is option I:7.17e-13, which is roughly twice as much. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the natural line width formula. Oh wait, another approach is using the Fourier transform relation between time and frequency, which relates to the energy-time uncertainty.

Wait, another formula I recall is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt), which I used earlier. But perhaps I should have used Δν * Δt ≈ 1, where Δν is the frequency bandwidth.

Wait, since E = h ν, so ΔE = h Δν. So, Δν ≈ ΔE / h.

But from the uncertainty principle, ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2 → Δν Δt ≈ (ΔE)/(h) * Δt ≈ (ħ/(2Δt)) ) / h * Δt ) → simplifies to Δν Δt ≈ (ħ/(2 h)) ), but h = 2π ħ, so ħ/h = 1/(2π). So, Δν Δt ≈ 1/(2π). So, Δν ≈ 1/(2π Δt )

Then, Δλ can be found from Δν.

But let me think. The frequency ν is related to wavelength by c = λ ν → ν = c/λ. So, Δν = c Δλ / λ².

So, Δν = (c / λ²) Δλ → Δλ = (Δν λ² ) / c.

But since Δν ≈ 1/(2π Δt ), substituting gives Δλ ≈ ( (1/(2π Δt )) * λ² ) / c.

So,

Δλ ≈ λ² / ( 2 π c Δt )

Let me compute this.

λ is 5.2e-7 m.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Δt is 2e-10 s.

So,

Δλ = (5.2e-7 )^2 / ( 2 * π * 3e8 * 2e-10 )

Compute denominator and numerator.

Numerator: (5.2e-7)^2 = 27.04e-14 = 2.704e-13 m².

Denominator: 2 * π *3e8 *2e-10.

Compute 2 * π ≈6.2832.

6.2832 *3e8 =1.88496e9.

1.88496e9 *2e-10=3.76992e-1.

So denominator is approximately 0.376992.

So,

Δλ = 2.704e-13 / 0.376992 ≈ 7.17e-13 m.

Oh wait, that's different from the previous approach. Which one
