Question:

A 36-year-old man comes to the office because of headaches that began 2 weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Refer him for consultation with an ophthalmologist
B: Begin a trial of a β-blocking medication
C: Begin a trial of an anti-inflammatory medication
D: Refer him for consultation with a psychiatrist
E: Prescribe over-the-counter analgesics for long term use
F: Refer him for consultation with a neurologist
G: Order CT scan of the head
H: Advise him to reduce stress and monitor symptoms
I: Order MRI of the head
J: Order EEG

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's break it down step by step. So, the patient is a 36-year-old man with headaches that started two weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, happen in the morning, and are relieved by over-the-counter analgesics. He has no history of headaches before. He was promoted and relocated about eight months ago. On physical exam, the only finding is blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I'm thinking is, what causes blurred optic disc margins? I remember that papilledema is swelling of the optic disc, which can indicate increased intracranial pressure (ICP). So, if the optic disc margins are blurred, that might suggest papilledema. But wait, I thought papilledema is associated with conditions like brain tumors, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or other causes of elevated ICP.

The patient's headaches are worse in the morning. Morning headaches can be a sign of increased ICP because lying down overnight can cause fluid to accumulate, increasing pressure. Also, the headaches being present upon waking and relieved by analgesics—though that relief doesn't necessarily rule out serious conditions.

He doesn't have a history of headaches, so it's not likely migraines or tension headaches, which usually have a longer history. His recent promotion and relocation could be stressors, but the physical finding is key here. Stress can cause tension headaches, but again, the optic disc changes are concerning.

Physical exam shows no other abnormalities except the blurred optic discs. So, no signs of focal neurologic deficits, which might suggest a mass lesion. But without other findings, it's still something to consider.

What are the options? The choices include various referrals and diagnostic tests. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Refer to ophthalmologist. Well, the finding is about the optic disc, so an ophthalmologist could evaluate for papilledema. But the root cause might be neurological, so maybe a neurologist would be better.

Option B: Beta-blockers are used for migraines, but he doesn't have a history of migraines, so maybe not the first choice.

Option C: Anti-inflammatory meds—could be for something like sinusitis, but his symptoms don't point to that. Plus, the optic disc issue is more concerning.

Option D: Psychiatrist—maybe for stress-related issues, but the physical finding needs to be addressed first.

Option E: Long-term OTC analgesics—probably not advisable without knowing the cause, and it's not treating the underlying issue.

Option F: Refer to neurologist. That makes sense because of possible increased ICP or other neurological issues.

Option G: CT scan of the head. That's a good idea because it can show structural abnormalities like tumors, hemorrhages, or signs of increased ICP.

Option H: Advise stress reduction. While stress might contribute, the optic disc finding needs to be evaluated.

Option I: MRI of the head. MRI is more detailed but maybe more appropriate after initial assessment or if CT is inconclusive.

Option J: EEG. That's for seizures, which he doesn't have symptoms of.

So, the key is that the patient presents with signs of possible increased intracranial pressure (morning headaches, papilledema). Therefore, the next step is to investigate the cause. A CT scan is a quick and effective way to rule out structural issues like a tumor or bleeding.

Wait, but what about the fact that he doesn't have other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances beyond blurring? Papilledema can sometimes be asymptomatic except for headache, especially in IIH. But IIH is more common in women of childbearing age, so maybe less likely here.

Given that, the next step would be imaging. So, options G or I. CT is usually the first line because it's faster and more available. MRI provides more detail but is often used if CT is inconclusive or if more detail is needed.

So, the most appropriate next step is to order a CT scan of the head. That would be option G.

Alternatively, if the CT is negative, then maybe refer to a neurologist. But given the acute presentation, imaging is the immediate next step.

The patient is a 36-year-old man with a 2-week history of moderately severe morning headaches relieved by over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches but recently experienced stress from a promotion and relocation. Physical examination reveals blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally, suggestive of papilledema, which is often associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Morning headaches and papilledema are concerning for conditions such as brain tumors, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or other causes of elevated ICP.

Given the acute onset and physical findings, the most appropriate next step is to investigate the cause of the suspected increased ICP. A CT scan of the head is the most appropriate initial imaging modality because it is quick, widely available, and effective in identifying structural abnormalities such as tumors or hemorrhages. While referral to a neurologist (Option F) may be necessary later, immediate imaging is critical to rule out life-threatening conditions.

Options A (ophthalmologist referral) and I (MRI) may be considered later if the CT scan is inconclusive or if further detail is needed. Other options, such as starting medications (B, C, E) or referring to a psychiatrist (D), do not address the urgent need to evaluate for increased ICP. Advising stress reduction (H) or ordering an EEG (J) is not appropriate given the clinical findings.
