Question:

The weight of an object on the moon, m, is about q of the object’s weight on Earth, e. Which equation represents the approximate weight of an object on the moon in terms of the object's weight on Earth?

Options:

A: m = e - 1/6
B: m = 6+e
C: m = 1/6e
D: m = 6e
E: m = 1/6 + e
F: m = e + 6
G: m = e - 6
H: m = e/6
I: m = 6 - e

Okay, so I've got this question here about the weight of an object on the moon compared to Earth. Hmm, I remember that the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. Like, I think it's about a sixth. So if something weighs, say, 60 pounds on Earth, it would be about 10 pounds on the moon. That makes sense because the moon is smaller and has less mass, so its gravity isn't as strong.

The question says the weight on the moon is m and on Earth it's e. And m is approximately q of e. Oh wait, maybe I misread that. Wait, the question says m is about q of e. Or did they mean m is a quarter? No, wait, the question probably states that m is about 1/6 of e.

So the equation should relate m to e with 1/6. Let me look at the options. Option C says m = (1/6)e. Option H says m = e/6, which is the same as C, right? Because dividing by 6 is the same as multiplying by 1/6. So both C and H look correct, but wait, no—wait, looking back, C is 1/6 times e, and H is e divided by 6. Oh, same thing. So why are there two options? Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again. Option C is (1/6)e, H is e/6. Oh, right, they're the same. So either could be correct. But wait, looking at the options, perhaps I should pick one. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased as m is approximately one sixth, so the equation would be m equals one sixth e. So that's option C or H. Wait, but in the options, C is m = 1/6 e, and H is m = e/6. Oh, same thing. So either would work.

Wait, but looking at the options, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see:

Option A: m = e - 1/6 → Subtracting 1/6 from e, which doesn't make sense because m should be less than e but not e minus a fraction. Because 1/6 is about 0.166, so e would be the Earth weight, which is larger.

Option B: m=6+e → That would make m larger than e, which is wrong.

Option C: m=1/6 e → Correct.

Option D: m=6e → That's six times e, which is wrong.

Option E: m=1/6 + e → Adding, which would make m larger, which is wrong.

Option F: m=e +6 → Also adding, wrong.

Option G: m=e-6 → Subtracting 6, which may not be correct unless e is in some unit where 6 makes sense, but generally, m is a fraction of e.

Option H: m=e/6 → Same as C.

Option I: m=6-e → Again, subtraction, not correct.

Wait, so both C and H look correct. But in the options, I need to choose between them. Wait, perhaps I should read the question again to see exactly what it says.

The question states that the weight on the moon is m, and it's about q of e. Wait, perhaps I misread the variable. Oh, perhaps the question says m is q times e, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says, "m is about q of the object’s weight on Earth, e." So m ≈ q * e. So if q is 1/6, then m is (1/6)e, which is option C. Alternatively, e divided by 6 is also the same.

Wait, but why are both C and H present? Oh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. So if q is 1/6, then m = (1/6) * e → option C. So the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, if it's written as m = e/6, then H is correct. But wait, looking at the options, C is m=1/6 e, which is same as e*(1/6). H is m =e/6, same thing.

So which one is the correct option? The question asks for the equation in terms of e. Both C and H are same mathematically. But in the options, perhaps the correct one is C or H. Wait, but looking at the answer options, I'm only supposed to choose one. Wait, maybe I should recheck the initial understanding.

Wait, the question says that q is about 1/6. So m is q times e, which is 1/6 e. So that would be option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me think: m = q * e. If q is 1/6, then m = (1/6)e → which is option C.

Alternatively, if the equation is m = e/6, which is also correct. So both C and H are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is present. Wait, no—looking at the options again, options C and H are both present. So perhaps the question is designed so that only one is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think of an example. Suppose on Earth, an object weighs 6 kg. On the moon, it would weigh 1 kg. So m=1, e=6. So 1 = (1/6)*6 → yes, that's C. Or 1=6/6 → which is H.

So both equations give the correct result. So why are both options present? Maybe I'm missing something in the question. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Oh, wait, the question says "m is about q of the object’s weight on Earth, e." So m = q*e. So if q is 1/6, then m = (1/6)e, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, the option could be H if the equation is m = e/6, but that's the same thing. So I'm a bit confused, but I think in the options, C is correct.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option C: m = (1/6)e

Option H: m = e/6

They are the same. So why are both options present? Maybe that's a mistake in the question. But perhaps the correct way to write it is m = (1/6)e, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the question states that m is about q of e. So q would be 1/6, so m = (1/6) * e → option C.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The question asks for the equation that represents the approximate weight of an object on the moon, \( m \), in terms of its weight on Earth, \( e \). It is stated that \( m \) is about \( \frac{1}{6} \) of \( e \). This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
m = \frac{1}{6}e
\]

Among the given options, both \( m = \frac{1}{6}e \) (Option C) and \( m = \frac{e}{6} \) (Option H) are mathematically equivalent, as dividing by 6 is the same as multiplying by \( \frac{1}{6} \). However, the question specifies that \( m \) is about \( q \) of \( e \), where \( q = \frac{1}{6} \), which aligns more directly with the form \( m = \frac{1}{6}e \) (Option C).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
