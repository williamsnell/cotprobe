Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about discrete random variables. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is asking which statement isn't true for all discrete random variables. So I need to find the exception here.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the 95% rule from the empirical rule in statistics. It applies to normal distributions, but does it apply to all discrete random variables? Well, the empirical rule is specifically for data that's approximately normally distributed. So if the distribution isn't normal, this might not hold. But the question is about all discrete variables. Hmm, maybe A isn't necessarily true for all. But I'm not sure yet. Let's hold onto that thought.

Option B: The possible outcomes must all be numerical. Wait, do they? Discrete random variables represent outcomes that can take on distinct values, like counts. For example, the number of heads in coin flips. But what if the outcomes are labels instead of numbers? Wait, no, because a random variable assigns a numerical value to each outcome. So even if the experiment's outcomes are non-numerical, like colors or categories, the random variable would map them to numbers. So the possible outcomes (as in the variable's outcomes) must be numerical. So B seems correct. So B is true for all, so it's not the exception.

Option C: The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive. Yes, because in probability, each outcome must be distinct and can't overlap. For a discrete variable, each outcome is a separate event. So C is true. Not the exception.

Option D: Sum of all probabilities is 1. That's a basic axiom of probability. For any random variable, all possible outcomes must cover all possibilities, so their probabilities sum to 1. So D is true, so it's not the exception.

Option E: Mean equals sum of each value times its probability. Yes, that's the definition of expected value. So E is always true. So it's not the exception.

Wait, so the question is which is NOT true. So the exception is the statement that's false.

Going back to option A. The 95% within two SDs is from the normal distribution. But discrete variables might not follow that. For example, a binomial distribution with n=1 is a discrete variable. Its mean is 0.5, and SD is about 0.707. Two SDs would be about 2.121. But the possible outcomes are 0 and 1. So all outcomes are within 0 and 1, which is way less than 2.121. So in this case, 100% of outcomes are within two SDs, not 95%. So the statement in A isn't true for all discrete variables because it's specific to the normal distribution. Therefore, A is the incorrect statement.

To determine which statement is not true for all discrete random variables, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: This statement refers to the 95% rule, which is derived from the empirical rule and applies specifically to approximately normal distributions. However, not all discrete random variables follow a normal distribution. For example, a binomial distribution with \( n = 1 \) has outcomes 0 and 1, and 100% of outcomes fall within two standard deviations, not 95%. Thus, this statement is not universally true for all discrete random variables.

- **Option B**: Discrete random variables assign numerical values to outcomes, even if the original experiment involves non-numerical events. Therefore, this statement is true for all discrete random variables.

- **Option C**: By definition, outcomes for discrete random variables are mutually exclusive. This statement is true.

- **Option D**: The sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes of a random variable is always 1, as per the axioms of probability. This statement is true.

- **Option E**: The mean (expected value) of a discrete random variable is defined as the sum of each value multiplied by its corresponding probability. This statement is true.

The exception is **Option A**, as the 95% rule does not apply universally to all discrete random variables.
