Okay, so I've got this question about Mill and his views on censoring speech that's possibly true. Hmm, I remember that Mill was a big advocate for freedom of speech. Let me think. His book On Liberty, right? In there, he argues against censorship, especially when the speech might be true.

Wait, the question is about censoring speech that is possibly true. So what does Mill say about that? Oh right, he believed that even if an opinion is wrong, suppressing it could prevent the truth from being known. Because if the suppressed opinion is true, then we lose the chance to exchange false ideas for true ones. Or if it's partly true, it could lead to a more complete truth when discussed.

So Mill's argument is that censoring such speech is bad because it hampers intellectual growth. If we don't allow the exchange of ideas, even if some are wrong, we can't progress. So the correct answer should relate to that idea.

Looking at the options, option C says "diminishes intellectual growth." That sounds right. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option E says it's a violation of freedom of expression, which is also something Mill would agree with. But the question is specifically about possibly true speech. Mill's main point is that silencing even possibly true speech is harmful because it stops the pursuit of truth. So E is a correct statement about freedom but maybe not the most precise answer here.

Option I says it's like saying you're infallible. Oh, right! Mill argues that suppressing an opinion because you think it's false is like claiming you're infallible. Because only an infallible being can be certain that an opinion is false and thus justified in silencing it. So I is another possible correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about the consequence of censoring possibly true speech. So the focus is on the effect, not the assumption behind the action. So option C is more about the effect on intellectual growth, while I is more about the assumption of infallibility.

The question asks, according to Mill, what does censoring possibly true speech do? So the options are about the implications. So both C and I could be correct, but I think the primary argument is that it assumes infallibility, which is option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. Mill's main points are that if you suppress an opinion, you might be suppressing a true one. If you do that, you're preventing the truth from being known, which hinders intellectual growth. Also, by silencing the opinion, you're asserting that your belief is certain, without allowing it to be tested, which is a sign of intellectual laziness or arrogance.

So the act of censoring possibly true speech implies that you think your belief can't be wrong, hence assuming infallibility. So I think the correct answer is I.

But wait, the question is about what happens when you censor. The options are about the consequences or the nature of the act. So option C is about the consequence on intellectual growth, which is definitely a point Mill makes. Option I is about the assumption made by the censor, which is also a key point.

Hmm, the question is phrased as "censoring speech that is possibly true" and what that does. So according to Mill, doing so would mean that you're asserting you're infallible because you're preventing others from expressing what might be true. So option I is correct.

Alternatively, option C is about the outcome, which is also correct. But the question is asking what Mill says about the act of censoring, not just the outcome. So I think the correct answer is I.

The question concerns Mill's views on censoring speech that is possibly true. Mill, in *On Liberty*, argues against censorship, emphasizing that suppressing speech, even if it is potentially false, stifles intellectual growth and assumes infallibility. Specifically, censoring possibly true speech prevents the exchange of ideas, which is crucial for uncovering truth. Additionally, Mill contends that silencing such speech implies a claim to infallibility, as it assumes the censors know the truth with absolute certainty. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option C** highlights the consequence of diminished intellectual growth, which aligns with Mill's argument about the importance of free exchange for progress.
- **Option I** addresses the assumption of infallibility, which Mill critiques as a flawed and arrogant stance.

While both C and I are relevant, the question focuses on the nature of the act of censorship. Mill's central critique is that censoring possibly true speech reflects an assumption of infallibility, making **Option I** the most precise answer.

Answer: I
