Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these optics concepts. The question is about finding the refractive index of a piece of glass when light is plane-polarized upon reflection. Hmm, I remember something about Brewster's angle from my notes. Let me think.

Wait, right! Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence at which light becomes completely polarized when it reflects off a surface. And the formula I remember is tan(theta) equals the refractive index of the second medium divided by the first. But wait, which one is which here? Oh right, when light goes from a medium with a lower refractive index to a higher one, so in this case, air to glass. Air has a refractive index of about 1, and glass is higher.

So the formula should be tan(theta) = n2 / n1, but wait no, wait. Wait, I think it's n1 times sin(theta) equals n2 times sin(theta_b), but no, that's Snell's law for reflection. Oh wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Brewster's angle is when the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular. So for Brewster's angle, the condition is that the sum of the angles (theta_i and theta_t) equals 90 degrees. 

Wait, maybe I should write down the correct formula. Oh right, at Brewster's angle, the reflected and transmitted rays are at 90 degrees, so theta_i + theta_t = 90. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way to approach it. Alternatively, the formula I think is n1 sin(theta_B) = n2 sin(theta_t), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, the correct formula for Brewster's angle is tan(theta_B) = n2 / n1, where theta_B is Brewster's angle, and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium. So if the light is going from air (n1≈1) to glass (n2), then tan(theta_B) = n2 / 1, so n2 = tan(theta_B). 

Wait, but wait, I think I might have that backwards. Because when light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, Brewster's angle occurs. So when going from lower n to higher n, the formula is tan(theta_B) = n2/n1. So in this case, since it's air (n1=1) to glass (n2), tan(theta) = n2. So n2 = tan(theta). Oh wait, but what's the angle given here?

The problem states that the angle is 57 degrees and 47 minutes. Hmm, I need to convert that into decimal degrees. Oh right, 47 minutes is 47/60 of a degree. Let me calculate that. 47 divided by 60 is approximately 0.7833 degrees. So the total angle theta is 57.7833 degrees.

Now, I need to find the tangent of 57.7833 degrees. Let me think about how to calculate that. I remember that tan(60 degrees) is about 1.732, and 57.78 is a bit less than 60. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator. Wait, but since I'm just thinking, I'll proceed as if I can calculate it.

Wait, wait. 57 degrees 47 minutes is 57 + (47/60) = 57.7833 degrees.

The tangent of 57.7833 degrees is approximately... Hmm, let me think. I know that tan(55) is about 1.428, tan(60)=1.732. 57.78 is about 58 degrees. Let me think, perhaps using a calculator would be more accurate, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the calculation.

Alternatively, if I have to compute it, perhaps I can use a linear approximation or know that for 57.7 degrees, tan is around 1.60, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of known angles. Wait, I think tan(57.7) is around 1.60 something. Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps I can proceed.

Wait, but let's think again. The formula is n = tan(theta). So if the angle is 57.78 degrees, then n is tan(57.78). Let me get a better approximation. Let me think about a calculator approach.

I remember that tan(45) is 1, tan(60)=1.732. So 57.78 is about 57.78 degrees.

I think that tan(57.5) is approximately 1.56, tan(58) is about 1.6003. Wait, perhaps I should remember more precisely. Let me think about the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because the options are given, and I can compute tan(57.7833) and match it to the options.

Wait, let me try to compute tan(57.7833) accurately. Hmm, but without a calculator, it's tricky. Alternatively, I can think of it as 57.78°, which is 57°47'. Let me try to compute the tangent.

Wait, another approach: I can use the formula for tan(A + B) where A is 57 degrees and B is 47 minutes, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 57.7833 as approximately 57.78 degrees.

Wait, I can use a Taylor expansion around 57 degrees, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can use known values.

Wait, I think that tan(57°) is approximately 1.5399. Let me confirm:

Wait, I recall that tan(55) ≈ 1.4281, tan(56)=1.4826, tan(57)=1.5399, tan(58)=1.6003, tan(59)=1.6643, tan(60)=1.732.

So, for 57.78 degrees, which is 57 + 47/60 = 57.7833 degrees.

The difference between 57 and 57.7833 is 0.7833 degrees. So, between 57 and 58 degrees, the tan increases from approximately 1.5399 to 1.6003. That's an increase of about 0.0604 per degree.

Wait, 0.0604 per degree is 0.0604 per 1 degree. So for 0.7833 degrees, the increase would be 0.0604 * 0.7833 ≈ 0.0473. So adding that to 1.5399 gives approximately 1.5872.

Wait, but wait, that's a linear approximation, which might not be entirely accurate because the tangent function isn't linear, but it's a rough estimate.

So, my approximation gives n ≈ 1.587. Now, looking at the options:

A:1.6421, B:1.5461, C:1.5, D:1.5307, E:1.5747, F:1.6234, G:1.56, H:1.6057, I:1.6789, J:1.5869.

Hmm, option J is 1.5869, which is very close to my approximation. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but wait—am I sure about the formula? Because I might have it the wrong way around. Let me double-check.

Brewster's angle condition is when the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular. So, the formula derived from that is tan(theta_B) = n2/n1, where n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (glass here), and n1 is the first medium (air, n=1). So yes, the formula is correct.

So, n2 = tan(theta_B) = tan(57.7833) ≈ 1.587, which matches option J:1.5869.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure the angle given is correct. The problem says the light is plane-polarized when reflected at an angle of 57° 47'. So that angle is the angle of incidence, right? Because Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence where polarization occurs. So yes, theta_B is 57.7833 degrees, and n2 = tan(theta_B).

So, yeah, I think option J is correct.

To determine the refractive index of the glass, we use the concept of Brewster's angle. Brewster's angle, denoted as \( \theta_B \), is the angle of incidence at which light becomes completely plane-polarized upon reflection. The formula relating Brewster's angle to the refractive indices of the two media is:

\[
\tan(\theta_B) = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
\]

Here:
- \( n_1 \) is the refractive index of the first medium (air, \( n_1 \approx 1 \)),
- \( n_2 \) is the refractive index of the second medium (glass),
- \( \theta_B \) is Brewster's angle.

The problem states that the angle of reflection is \( 57^\circ 47' \). To convert this to decimal degrees:
\[
57^\circ 47' = 57 + \frac{47}{60} \approx 57.7833^\circ
\]

Using the formula \( n_2 = \tan(\theta_B) \), we calculate:
\[
n_2 = \tan(57.7833^\circ)
\]

From known values of the tangent function:
- \( \tan(57^\circ) \approx 1.5399 \),
- \( \tan(58^\circ) \approx 1.6003 \).

Since \( 57.7833^\circ \) is closer to \( 58^\circ \), we use a linear approximation to estimate \( \tan(57.7833^\circ) \). The increase in \( \tan(\theta) \) between \( 57^\circ \) and \( 58^\circ \) is approximately \( 1.6003 - 1.5399 = 0.0604 \) per degree. For \( 0.7833^\circ \), the increase is:
\[
0.0604 \times 0.7833 \approx 0.0473
\]

Adding this to \( \tan(57^\circ) \):
\[
\tan(57.7833^\circ) \approx 1.5399 + 0.0473 = 1.5872
\]

This matches closely with option \( J: 1.5869 \). Thus, the refractive index of the glass is approximately \( 1.5869 \).

**Final Answer: J**
