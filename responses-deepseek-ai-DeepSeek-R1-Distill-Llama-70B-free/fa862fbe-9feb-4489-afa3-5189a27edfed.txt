Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Hmm. The question is about a resistor and the current when the potential difference changes. 

Alright, the problem states: The difference of potential V1 between the terminals of a resistor is 120 volts when the current I1 is 8.00 amps. Then, they're asking what current will flow when the potential increases to 180 volts. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember Ohm's Law. Oh right, Ohm's Law is V = I * R. So voltage equals current times resistance. That makes sense. So if I know two of the variables, I can find the third.

In this case, first, they give me V1 = 120 V and I1 = 8 A. I can use these to find the resistance R of the resistor. Because the resistor is the same in both situations, right? So R remains constant.

So using V1 = I1 * R, I can solve for R. Let's plug in the numbers. R = V1 / I1 = 120 V / 8 A. Let me calculate that: 120 divided by 8 is 15. Oh, so R is 15 ohms. Got it.

Now, the second part is when the potential difference increases to V2 = 180 V. They want to find the new current I2. Using Ohm's Law again, V2 = I2 * R. Since R is 15, we can rearrange to find I2: I2 = V2 / R.

Plugging in the numbers: I2 = 180 V / 15 ohms. Let me do that division. 180 divided by 15 is 12. So I2 should be 12 amps. 

Looking at the options, option C is 12.0 amp. So that's the answer. Hmm, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. 

120/8 is 15, yes. 180/15 is 12. Yep, that's right. So the current increases when the voltage increases, which makes sense because with a higher voltage across the same resistor, more current flows. 

I think that's all. I don't see any other factors here. The resistor's value doesn't change, so Ohm's Law applies directly.

To solve the problem, we use Ohm's Law, which states:

\[
V = I \cdot R
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the resistance \( R \)
The first situation gives \( V_1 = 120 \, \text{V} \) and \( I_1 = 8.00 \, \text{A} \). Using \( R = \frac{V_1}{I_1} \):

\[
R = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \, \Omega
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new current \( I_2 \)
When the potential difference increases to \( V_2 = 180 \, \text{V} \), we use \( I_2 = \frac{V_2}{R} \):

\[
I_2 = \frac{180}{15} = 12 \, \text{A}
\]

### Final Answer
The current in the resistor when the potential difference is 180 volts is **12.0 A**, which corresponds to option **C**.
