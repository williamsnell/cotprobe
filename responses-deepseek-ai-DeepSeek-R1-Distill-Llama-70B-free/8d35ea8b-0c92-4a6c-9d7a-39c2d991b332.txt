Question:

Describe Sherman's and Key's (1932) study of the Hollow Children. What do their findings indicate about the effect of environment on intellectual development?

Options:

A: The study found no significant findings
B: Environment has no effect on intellectual development
C: The study shows that a deprived environment only affects intellectual development until a certain age
D: The study concluded that intellectual development is solely determined by genetics, not environment
E: The findings indicate that a stimulating environment has no impact on intellectual development
F: Sherman and Key's study indicates that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development
G: The research indicates that changes in the environment can reverse any prior intellectual development deficits
H: A deprived environment enhances intellectual development
I: Sherman and Key's research suggests that intellectual development is primarily influenced by peer interactions, not environment
J: Sherman and Key found that intellectual development is equally impacted by both deprived and enriched environments

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Sherman's and Key's 1932 study on the Hollow Children. Hmm, I remember that the term "Hollow Children" refers to a group of children studied in some psychological research. I think it's related to environment and its effects on intellectual development.

Wait, I recall that the study involved twins. Oh right, they studied twins to see how the environment affects their development. Since twins are genetically similar, comparing them could show the impact of environmental factors.

So, in the study, they found that children from deprived environments had lower IQs than those from more stimulating environments. Or was it the other way around? No, I think it was that the deprived environment led to lower intellectual performance. Because the idea is that without proper stimulation, children's cognitive abilities don't develop as well.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option F says that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development. That sounds right based on what I remember. The study would support that environment plays a significant role in shaping intellectual abilities.

Option C suggests it only affects up to a certain age, but I don't think the study specified an age limit. It was more about the general effect. Option G talks about reversing deficits, but I'm not sure if the study addressed that. Their findings were more about the negative impact rather than recovery.

Other options like B and D say environment has no effect or it's all genetics, which contradicts what I remember. Options E and H are the opposite of what the study found. Option I is about peer interactions, which I don't think was the focus. Option J says both environments have equal impact, which doesn't fit because the study pointed out deprivation as harmful.

So the correct answer should be F. It aligns with the conclusion that a deprived environment negatively affects intellectual development.

The correct answer is F. Sherman and Key's study on the Hollow Children demonstrated that a deprived environment can have a detrimental effect on intellectual development, highlighting the importance of environmental factors in shaping cognitive abilities.

Answer: F
