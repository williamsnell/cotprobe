Question:

Evans and King are partners in a copying service. Evans invested $8,500 and King invested $6,500. The profits for the year were $9,600. If the partners agreed to divide profits and losses according to their initial investments, how were the profits divided?

Options:

A: Evans' share is $5,440 and King's share is $4,160

C: Evans' share is $7,200 and King's share is $2,400
D: Evans' share is $5,200 and King's share is $4,400
E: Evans' share is $4,160 and King's share is $5,440
F: Evans' share is $4,800 and King's share is $4,800
G: Evans' share is $6,000 and King's share is $3,600
H: Evans' share is $5,000 and King's share is $4,600
I: Both Evans and King receive equal shares
J: Evans' share is $6,500 and King's share is $3,100

Okay, I have this problem about Evans and King being partners in a copying service. They each invested different amounts, and I need to figure out how the profits are divided. Let me think through this step by step.

So, Evans invested $8,500 and King invested $6,500. The total profit for the year is $9,600. The question says that profits and losses are divided according to their initial investments. Hmm, okay, so it's based on the proportion each partner put in.

First, I should find the total investment. Let me add Evans' and King's investments. $8,500 plus $6,500 is $15,000. That makes sense because 8.5k plus 6.5k is 15k.

Now, the profits are $9,600. I need to split this between them based on their investment ratio. So each partner's share is their investment divided by the total investment, multiplied by the total profit.

Evans' share would be (8,500 / 15,000) * 9,600. Let me calculate that. 8,500 divided by 15,000 is the same as 17/30 because 8.5 divided by 15 is 0.566666..., which is 17/30. Then multiply that by 9,600.

Wait, maybe another way to think about it is to find the ratio of their investments. Evans: $8,500 and King: $6,500. Let me write that as a ratio. 8,500:6,500. I can simplify this by dividing both by 100. So 85:65. Then, divide both by 5: 17:13. Oh, so the ratio is 17:13.

That means for every 17 parts Evans gets, King gets 13. The total parts are 17 +13 =30. So the profit is split into 30 parts.

Each part is $9,600 divided by 30. Let me compute that. 9,600 divided by 30 is 320. So each part is $320.

Then, Evans gets 17 parts: 17 *320 = let's see, 17*300 is 5,100, and 17*20 is 340, so total 5,100 +340 =5,440.

King gets 13 parts: 13 *320. Hmm, 10*320=3,200 and 3*320=960, so 3,200 +960=4,160.

So Evans gets $5,440 and King gets $4,160. Now I need to look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Evans $5,440, King $4,160. That's exactly what I got.

Option B: Evans $5,600, which would be if it were split 60:40 perhaps? Because 9600 *0.6 is 5,760, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I should double-check my calculation. Let me recalculate Evans' share. 8,500 is his investment. The total is 15,000. So 8,500/15,000 is 0.566666... Multiply by 9,600: 0.566666 *9,600.

Let me compute 9,600 * 0.566666. 9,600 * 0.5 is 4,800. 9,600 * 0.066666 is about 9,600 * (2/30) = 640. So 4,800 +640=5,440. Yep, same as before.

So the correct option is A. Let me check the other options quickly. Option E is the reverse, giving King more, which doesn't fit the ratio. Option B would be if the split was 8,500:6,500 as 60:40? Wait, 8.5k is more than half of 15k, so 60% would be 5,760, but that's not matching any option. So no, the correct split is A.

The total investment by Evans and King is $15,000 ($8,500 + $6,500). The profits of $9,600 are to be divided in the ratio of their investments, which simplifies to 17:13. This means the total profit is split into 30 parts (17 + 13), and each part is worth $320 ($9,600 ÷ 30). 

- **Evans' share**: 17 parts × $320 = $5,440  
- **King's share**: 13 parts × $320 = $4,160  

Among the options, only **Option A** matches these calculations: Evans receives $5,440 and King receives $4,160.

**Answer: A**
