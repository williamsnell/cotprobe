Question:

One of the two most important uses of ammonia is as a reagent in the first step of theOsfwaldprocess, a synthetic route for the production of nitric acid. This first step proceeds according to the equation 4NH_3(g) + 50_2(g) \rightleftarrows 4N0(g) + 6H_20(g) . What is the expression for the equilibrium constant of this reaction?

Options:

A: K = {[NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5} / {[NO]^4 [H_2O]^6 }
B: K = {[O_2]^5} / { [NO]^4 [NH_3]^4 [H_2O]^6}
C: K = {[NO]^4 [H_2O]^6 } / { [NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5}
D: K = {[NO]^6 [H_2O]^4} / { [NH_3]^5 [O_2]^4}
E: K = {[NO]^4 [H_2O]^6 [NH_3]^4} / {[O_2]^5}
F: K = {[NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5 [H_2O]^6} / {[NO]^4}
G: K = {[NO]^4 [NH_3]^4} / { [H_2O]^6 [O_2]^5}
H: K = {[NH_3]^5 [O_2]^4} / { [NO]^6 [H_2O]^4}
I: K = {[NO]^4} / { [NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5}
J: K = {[NO]^4} / { [NH_3]^4 [H_2O]^6}

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium constants, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with this topic. But I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the Ostwald process, specifically the first step which produces nitric acid. The reaction given is 4NH3(g) + 50₂(g) ⇌ 4NO(g) + 6H₂O(g). I need to find the correct expression for the equilibrium constant K from the options provided.

I remember that the equilibrium constant expression K is based on the concentrations of the products and reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. The general form is K = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients.

So let's break down the reaction. On the reactant side, we have NH3 and O2. The products are NO and H2O. The coefficients are 4 for NH3, 5 for O2, 4 for NO, and 6 for H2O.

Wait, wait. The reaction is written as 4NH3 + 50₂ → 4NO + 6H2O. Oh wait, actually looking again, the equation is 4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) ⇌ 4NO(g) + 6H2O(g). My mistake earlier, the O2 coefficient is 5, not 50. Because 50₂ would mean 50 molecules, but that's not the case here. It's 5 O2 molecules, so the formula is 4NH3 + 5O2 ⇌ products.

So the expression for K should have the products in the numerator and the reactants in the denominator. Each concentration is raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

So the products are NO and H2O. So their terms will be [NO]^4 and [H2O]^6. The reactants are NH3 and O2, so their terms will be [NH3]^4 and [O2]^5, but since they're in the denominator, they'll be multiplied together there.

Putting it all together, K should equal ([NO]^4 [H2O]^6) divided by ([NH3]^4 [O2]^5).

Now I look at the options. Option C is K = [NO]^4 [H2O]^6 / [NH3]^4 [O2]^5. That matches what I came up with. Let me double-check the other options to be sure I'm not mixing anything up.

Option A has [NH3]^4 [O2]^5 in the numerator, which would be the reactants, so that's the reciprocal of what K should be. So A is the inverse of the correct expression, which would actually be 1/K.

Option B has [O2]^5 in the numerator, which doesn't make sense because O2 is a reactant. So B can't be right.

Option C, as I thought, is correct. Let me glance at the others quickly. Option D has different exponents, like 6 and 4, which don't match the reaction. Option E seems to have an extra [NH3] term in the numerator, which is wrong. Option F flips the denominator and numerator, putting products in the denominator. Option G also has some swapped terms. Option I and J have only some parts, missing H2O or others. 

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The equilibrium constant expression \( K \) for a chemical reaction is determined by placing the concentrations of the products in the numerator and the concentrations of the reactants in the denominator, each raised to the power of their respective stoichiometric coefficients. For the reaction:

\[
4NH_3(g) + 5O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 4NO(g) + 6H_2O(g),
\]

the products are \( NO \) and \( H_2O \), and the reactants are \( NH_3 \) and \( O_2 \). The equilibrium constant expression is therefore:

\[
K = \frac{[NO]^4 [H_2O]^6}{[NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5}.
\]

Among the given options, this matches **Option C**. Other options either incorrectly place reactants in the numerator, omit terms, or use incorrect stoichiometric coefficients. 

**Answer: C**
