Okay, so I've got this question about mitochondria and chloroplasts, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, right? They generate ATP through cellular respiration. And chloroplasts are where photosynthesis happens, so they're found in plant cells and some algae. Oh wait, and chloroplasts are only in plants, not animals or fungi.

Wait, do all plants have both? Well, plants make their own food via photosynthesis, so they definitely have chloroplasts. And since they're eukaryotic cells, they also have mitochondria for energy production. So plant cells have both.

What about animals? Animals can't do photosynthesis, so they don't have chloroplasts. But they do need energy, so they have mitochondria. So animals have only mitochondria.

Fungi are interesting. I think fungi are heterotrophic like animals, so they can't make their own food. That means they don't have chloroplasts. But they still need energy, so they must have mitochondria. So fungi have mitochondria only.

Now let me look at the options. The question asks which statement is generally true.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Plants, animals, and fungi all have both chloroplasts and mitochondria. Wait, no, because animals and fungi don't have chloroplasts. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have only mitochondria. Hmm, plants do have mitochondria, so B is wrong because it says plants have no mitochondria.

Option C: Animals have both; plants and fungi have only chloroplasts. No, that's not right. Animals don't have chloroplasts, and plants definitely have mitochondria, so C is wrong.

Option D: Plants and animals have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have only mitochondria. No, because plants have mitochondria, and animals don't have chloroplasts. D is incorrect.

Option E: Plants and animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts; fungi have only chloroplasts. Wait, no. Fungi don't have chloroplasts, so E is wrong.

Option F: Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. Wait, plants do have mitochondria, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. Again, plants do have mitochondria, so G is wrong.

Option H: Animals and fungi have both; plants have only mitochondria. No, because plants have both, and animals don't have chloroplasts. So H is wrong.

Option I: Plants have both; animals and fungi have only mitochondria. Yes, that sounds right. Because plants have chloroplasts (for photosynthesis) and mitochondria (for energy), while animals and fungi don't photosynthesize, so only mitochondria.

Option J: Plants and fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts; animals have only chloroplasts. Wait, no, animals don't have chloroplasts. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The correct answer is determined by analyzing the presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants, animals, and fungi:

- **Plants**: They have both chloroplasts (for photosynthesis) and mitochondria (for energy production).
- **Animals**: They do not have chloroplasts (as they cannot perform photosynthesis) but have mitochondria for energy.
- **Fungi**: Like animals, fungi do not have chloroplasts but rely on mitochondria for energy.

Evaluating the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Animals and fungi do not have chloroplasts.
- **B**: Incorrect. Plants have mitochondria, so this is false.
- **C**: Incorrect. Animals do not have chloroplasts, and plants have mitochondria.
- **D**: Incorrect. Plants have mitochondria, and animals do not have chloroplasts.
- **E**: Incorrect. Fungi do not have chloroplasts.
- **F**: Incorrect. Plants have mitochondria.
- **G**: Incorrect. Plants have mitochondria.
- **H**: Incorrect. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria.
- **I**: Correct. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.
- **J**: Incorrect. Animals do not have chloroplasts.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.

Answer: I
