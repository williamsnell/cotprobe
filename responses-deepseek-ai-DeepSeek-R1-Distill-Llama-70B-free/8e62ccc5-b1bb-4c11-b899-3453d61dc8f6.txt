Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about net ionic equations when two solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that when you mix ionic compounds, sometimes a precipitation reaction happens. But I'm a bit rusty, so let me think this through.

The question is mixing NH4Br and AgNO3. I think NH4Br is ammonium bromide and AgNO3 is silver nitrate. Both are soluble in water, right? So when they're in solution, they should dissociate into their ions.

Let me write down the dissociation. NH4Br would break into NH4+ and Br^- ions. And AgNO3 would break into Ag+ and NO3^- ions. So the solution would have NH4+, Br^-, Ag+, and NO3^- all floating around.

Now, the question is about the net ionic equation. I remember that the net ionic equation shows only the species that actually participate in the reaction. So I need to see if any of the ions form a precipitate, gas, or something that isn't aqueous.

Looking at the possible combinations. NH4+ and NO3^- could form NH4NO3, but I think that's soluble. Ag+ and Br^- might form AgBr. I remember silver compounds—like silver chloride, bromide, carbonate—are often insoluble. Oh right, silver bromide is a common precipitate.

So when Ag+ and Br^- meet, they should form AgBr solid. The other ions, NH4+ and NO3^-, would remain in solution because they don't react.

So the net ionic equation should be Ag+ (aq) plus Br^- (aq) forming AgBr (s). Let me look at the options.

Option I says Ag+ + Br^- → AgBr(s). That looks right. Let me double-check the other options quickly.

Option A: Br- and NO3- making NO3Br. Doesn't sound right. Those are both anions; they wouldn't combine. Option B: NH4+ and NO3- making NH4NO3(aq), which is correct in the complete equation but in the net ionic, spectator ions are excluded. So B is part of the complete equation but not the net. Option C is NH4+ and Br^- forming NH4Br, but those are the ions from the original compounds, so they're spectators. So C is not the net equation.

Option D is a bit confusing, but I think it's a complete equation mixing the compounds, not the net. Option E has Br- and Ag+ forming AgBr2^-? I've never heard of that. Silver bromide is AgBr, so E is wrong.

Option F: NH4+ and Ag+ forming something. I don't think so; they're both cations and wouldn't react. G is a combination of three ions forming a compound, but that doesn't align with what I know. H is AgNO3 and Br- producing AgBr and NO3^-; that's the complete equation, not net. Option J has NH4+ and Ag+ forming a complex. I don't think that's what's happening here.

So the correct option is I: Ag+ + Br^- → AgBr(s).
</think>

When solutions of NH4Br and AgNO3 are mixed, both compounds dissociate into their respective ions: NH4+ and Br^- from NH4Br, and Ag+ and NO3^- from AgNO3. The key is to identify if any combination of these ions forms an insoluble product, which would be the basis of the net ionic equation.

Ag+ and Br^- combine to form AgBr, which is a well-known insoluble compound that precipitates out of the solution. The other ions, NH4+ and NO3^-, do not react and remain as spectator ions in the solution. Therefore, the net ionic equation is:

\[
\text{Ag}^+(aq) + \text{Br}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgBr}(s)
\]

Analyzing the options:
- **A, B, C, D, F, G, J**: These options involve incorrect combinations or spectator ions and do not represent the net ionic equation.
- **E**: Suggests the formation of AgBr2^-, which is incorrect as the correct precipitate is AgBr.
- **H**: Represents the complete ionic equation, not the net ionic equation.
- **I**: Correctly shows the reaction between Ag+ and Br^- to form AgBr(s), which is the net ionic equation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I**

Answer: I
