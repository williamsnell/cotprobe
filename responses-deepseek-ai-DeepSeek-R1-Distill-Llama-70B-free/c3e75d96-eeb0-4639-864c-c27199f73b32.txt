Okay, so I need to convert the decimal 0.1 repeating 7 into a common fraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that repeating decimals can be converted by using algebra. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, I'll let x equal the decimal. So, x = 0.17777..., right? The bar is over the 7, so only the 7 is repeating. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the decimal is written as 0.1\overline{7}, which means the 7 is repeating. So it's 0.1777..., not 0.1177... Oh, okay, that makes sense.

So, x = 0.17777... and so on. Now, I need to find a way to eliminate the repeating part. Since only one digit (7) is repeating, I can multiply x by 10 to shift the decimal point so that the repeating part lines up. Let me try that.

Multiplying x by 10 gives me 10x = 1.7777... Now, the repeating part is after the decimal point. But wait, the original x is 0.1777..., so maybe I should adjust this. Alternatively, maybe I can subtract x from this equation to eliminate the repeating part.

Wait, let's see. If I have 10x = 1.7777..., and x = 0.1777..., subtracting x from 10x would give 9x = 1.6, because 1.7777... minus 0.1777... is 1.6. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the subtraction.

Wait, 10x is 1.7777... and x is 0.1777..., so subtracting x from 10x is 1.7777... minus 0.1777..., which equals 1.6. So 9x = 1.6. Then, solving for x would give x = 1.6 / 9. But 1.6 is a decimal, so I can convert that to a fraction. 1.6 is the same as 16/10, which simplifies to 8/5. So, 1.6 is 8/5.

So, substituting back, x = (8/5) / 9 = 8/(5*9) = 8/45. Wait, so x is 8/45. Let me check that.

Wait, 8 divided by 45. Let me do that division. 8 ÷ 45. 45 goes into 8 zero times. Add a decimal point, 45 into 80 once (because 45*1=45), subtract 45 from 80, you get 35. Bring down a zero, 350. 45 goes into 350 seven times (45*7=315), subtract 315 from 350, you get 35. So it's 0.1777..., which matches the original number. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 8/45, which seems to be the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps.

So, x = 0.1777..., 10x = 1.7777..., subtracting x gives 9x = 1.6. 1.6 is 8/5, so 9x = 8/5 → x = 8/(5*9) = 8/45. Yep, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can try another method to confirm. For a decimal like 0.a\overline{b}, where a is the non-repeating part and b is the repeating part, the fraction can be found using a formula. But I'm not sure I remember it exactly.

Wait, the general formula for converting a repeating decimal to a fraction is to take the non-repeating part and the repeating part and set it up as (non-repeating + repeating) divided by (as many 9s as repeating digits followed by as many 0s as non-repeating digits after the decimal). Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for 0.abcd..., where some digits repeat, the approach is to use algebra as I did before.

So, in this case, I think my first method is correct, giving me 8/45 as the fraction, which is option A. So I'll go with that.

To convert \( 0.1\overline{7} \) into a common fraction, let \( x = 0.1\overline{7} \), which means \( x = 0.1777\ldots \). To eliminate the repeating part, multiply \( x \) by 10:

\[
10x = 1.7777\ldots
\]

Now, subtract \( x \) from \( 10x \):

\[
10x - x = 1.7777\ldots - 0.1777\ldots
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
9x = 1.6
\]

Solving for \( x \), divide both sides by 9:

\[
x = \frac{1.6}{9}
\]

Convert \( 1.6 \) to a fraction:

\[
1.6 = \frac{16}{10} = \frac{8}{5}
\]

Thus:

\[
x = \frac{\frac{8}{5}}{9} = \frac{8}{5 \times 9} = \frac{8}{45}
\]

Therefore, \( 0.1\overline{7} \) as a common fraction is \( \frac{8}{45} \).

The correct answer is **A**.
