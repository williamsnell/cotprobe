Okay, so I've got this question about psychology, specifically related to memory and how information is processed. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a class listened to a list of words. Half the group was told to listen for sounds, and the other half was asked to gauge the emotional impact of the words. The group that focused on the emotional impact remembered more words. The question is asking what this result indicates about retention and attention.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that there are different levels of processing when it comes to memory. I think there's something called the levels of processing theory. From what I recall, this theory was proposed by Craik and Lockhart. The idea is that the way information is processed affects how well it's retained in memory.

So, there are different types of processing: structural (or physical), phonetic (sound-based), and semantic (meaning-based). Structural processing would involve noticing the physical features of a word, like how it's written. Phonetic is about the sounds, so maybe like how the word is pronounced. Semantic processing is about the meaning or emotional impact of the word.

In the question, one group was listening for sounds. That sounds like phonetic processing. The other group was evaluating the emotional impact, which would be semantic processing because emotions are tied to meaning. The group that did the semantic processing remembered more words. So that supports the idea that deeper, more meaningful processing leads to better retention.

Wait, but the options don't just include semantic features. Let me look at the options again. The options are A to J. Option J is deep processing. I think deep processing refers to semantic processing, where you process the meaning of the information. Shallow processing would be more about the physical or sensory aspects, like sounds or visuals.

So in the experiment, the group that did the emotional impact (semantic) remembered more, which means they used deeper processing. The other group was doing more surface-level, like just the sounds, which is shallow.

The question is about what kind of attention leads to better retention. So the answer should relate to deeper processing. Looking back, option J is deep processing, and option F is semantic features. Wait, are those the same thing?

Wait, the levels of processing theory categorizes processing into shallow (like physical features) and deep (like semantic meaning). So the emotional impact group did deep processing, leading to better retention.

So the correct answer would be J: deep processing. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other options. Option F is semantic features, which is part of deep processing. But the question is about the type of processing, so J is more about the level (deep) rather than the specific feature (semantic). So the answer is J.

The experiment described in the question demonstrates that the group focusing on the emotional impact of words (semantic processing) remembered more words than the group focusing on sounds (phonetic processing). This aligns with the levels of processing theory, which states that deeper, more meaningful processing (semantic) leads to better retention compared to shallow processing (e.g., focusing on physical or sensory aspects). The correct answer reflects the type of processing that enhances retention, which is deep processing.

Answer: J
