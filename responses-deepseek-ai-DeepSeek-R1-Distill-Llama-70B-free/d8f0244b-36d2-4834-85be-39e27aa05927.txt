Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about international law sources. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the sources of international law are outlined in the Statute of the International Court of Justice. Let me think... Article 38, right? It lists the sources as treaties, international custom, general principles of law, judicial decisions, and the teachings of publicists. 

The question is about the relationship between these formal sources. I think the formal sources are treaties, custom, and general principles. Judicial decisions and teachings are considered subsidiary means, so they help interpret but aren't primary sources.

So the options are about how these formal sources relate. The question is asking if one supersedes another, or if they're equal, or if there's no hierarchy.

I remember learning that there's no strict hierarchy among the formal sources. It's more about what's applicable in a given situation. For example, a treaty might take precedence in a specific case, but sometimes custom can be more important, especially peremptory norms (jus cogens) which can't be derogated by treaties. But wait, jus cogens is a specific type of customary law, so maybe that's an exception.

Wait, but the question isn't about exceptions like jus cogens. It's about the general relationship. So generally, are treaties above custom, or vice versa? Or are they equal?

From what I recall, the ICJ statute doesn't establish a hierarchy. So when a dispute arises, the court would look at which source is most relevant. Treaties are considered more specific, so when there's a treaty that applies, it's used. But if there's no treaty, custom steps in. So they're not necessarily in a hierarchy but are used based on applicability.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Treaties supersede custom. I don't think that's right because custom can sometimes override treaties, especially with jus cogens. But generally, maybe not.

Option B: Treaties and General Principles are equal, both above custom. Not sure about that. I think treaties and custom are primary, but general principles are more like a fallback.

Option C: General Principles supersede both. Doesn't sound right; they're probably the least direct.

Option D: Judicial decisions and teachings are the only sources. No, that's wrong because those are subsidiary.

Option E: Same as D, they supersede others. Definitely wrong.

Option F: Custom and General Principles equal, above treaties. I don't think so.

Option G: Hierarchy varies case to case. Maybe, but I thought there's no hierarchy.

Option H: Custom supersedes treaties. No, because sometimes treaties are more specific.

Option I: Treaties and custom equal, General Principles above. Doesn't sound right.

Option J: No hierarchy between formal sources. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The formal sources (treaties, custom, general principles) are on equal footing, and the court decides based on relevance.

So the correct answer should be J. Wait, but looking back, I thought earlier that some sources might take precedence, but according to the ICJ statute, they are listed in order but that doesn't imply hierarchy. So the correct answer is J.

The formal sources of international law, as outlined in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, include treaties, international custom, and general principles of law. Judicial decisions and the teachings of publicists are considered subsidiary means of interpretation rather than formal sources. The question asks about the relationship between these formal sources.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Treaties supersede custom. This is incorrect because custom, especially peremptory norms (jus cogens), can override treaties in specific cases.
- **Option B**: Treaties and General Principles of Law are equal but supersede custom. This is inaccurate as treaties and custom are generally considered primary sources, while general principles are a fallback.
- **Option C**: General Principles supersede both custom and treaties. This is incorrect because general principles are not considered superior to treaties or custom.
- **Option D**: Judicial decisions and teachings are the only sources. This is wrong because judicial decisions and teachings are subsidiary means, not formal sources.
- **Option E**: Judicial decisions and teachings supersede custom and treaties. This is also incorrect for the same reason as D.
- **Option F**: Custom and General Principles are equal but supersede treaties. This is incorrect because treaties are often more specific and relevant in disputes.
- **Option G**: Hierarchy varies case to case. While the court may prioritize sources based on relevance, there is no established hierarchy among the formal sources.
- **Option H**: Custom supersedes treaties. This is incorrect because treaties are often more specific and applicable in disputes.
- **Option I**: Treaties and custom are equal, but General Principles supersede both. This is incorrect because General Principles are not superior to treaties or custom.
- **Option J**: No hierarchy between the formal sources. This is correct because the ICJ Statute does not establish a hierarchy among treaties, custom, and general principles. They are used based on their applicability and relevance in a given case.

The correct answer is **J**.
