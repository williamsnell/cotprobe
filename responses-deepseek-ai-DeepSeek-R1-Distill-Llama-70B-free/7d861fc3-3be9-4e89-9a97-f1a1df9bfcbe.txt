Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about springs and work. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. So, there are two springs involved. The first spring has a force constant k. It's stretched a certain distance, let's call that distance x. Then, there's a second spring that's stretched by half this distance, so that's x/2. The question says that it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring compared to the first. I'm supposed to find the force constant of the second spring.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the work done on a spring when you stretch it is given by the formula for elastic potential energy, right? So work done, W, is equal to (1/2)kx². Because when you stretch a spring, you're storing potential energy in it, and that's the formula.

So for the first spring, the work done is W1 = (1/2)k x². Got that. Now, the second spring is stretched by x/2, and the work done on it is W2 = (1/2)k2 (x/2)². But according to the problem, W2 is twice as much as W1. So W2 = 2 * W1.

Let me write that out:

W2 = 2 * W1
(1/2)k2 (x/2)^2 = 2*(1/2 k x²)

Simplify both sides. Let's do the left side first: (1/2) * k2 * (x²/4) because (x/2)^2 is x²/4. So that's (k2 x²) / 8.

Right side: 2 times (1/2 k x²) is (2)*(1/2) which is 1, so k x².

Now the equation is:

(k2 x²)/8 = k x²

Wait, I can cancel x² from both sides since they're non-zero. So:

k2 /8 = k

Then, solving for k2:

k2 = 8k

Wait, does that make sense? So the second spring has a force constant 8 times larger than the first. Let me think again. Because if the second spring is stiffer (higher k), then stretching it by a smaller distance would require more work. But in this case, the second spring is stretched half the distance but requires twice the work. So if k2 is 8k, that would mean it's much stiffer. Let me plug the numbers to check.

Suppose k is, say, 10 N/m. Then k2 would be 80 N/m. The first work is (1/2)(10)(x²) =5x². The second work is (1/2)(80)(x/2)^2 = 40*(x²/4)=10 x². So 10 x² is indeed twice 5x². Oh, wait, that's correct. So the work done on the second spring is twice that of the first. So yeah, k2 is 8k.

Looking at the options, option A is 8k. So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the work done to stretch a spring, which is given by the elastic potential energy:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\]

For the first spring with force constant \(k\) stretched a distance \(x\), the work done is:

\[
W_1 = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\]

For the second spring with force constant \(k_2\), stretched a distance \(\frac{x}{2}\), the work done is:

\[
W_2 = \frac{1}{2}k_2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}k_2\frac{x^2}{4} = \frac{k_2x^2}{8}
\]

The problem states that \(W_2 = 2W_1\). Substituting the expressions for \(W_1\) and \(W_2\):

\[
\frac{k_2x^2}{8} = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}kx^2\right)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{k_2x^2}{8} = kx^2
\]

Cancel \(x^2\) from both sides (assuming \(x \neq 0\)):

\[
\frac{k_2}{8} = k
\]

Solve for \(k_2\):

\[
k_2 = 8k
\]

Thus, the force constant of the second spring is \(8k\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: 8k**
