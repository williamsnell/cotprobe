Alright, so I've got this question about the Internal-External Control Scale. Hmm, I remember that this scale is about locus of control, right? Locus of control refers to whether people believe their outcomes are due to their own efforts or due to external factors.

Okay, the question is asking about someone who scores high on internality. Wait, wait. Wait, I think high internality means they believe they have control over their outcomes. So internal locus of control. They think their successes and failures are because of their own actions, not luck or fate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: High internality believes success is due to external factors. No, that's the opposite. High internal people think success is due to their own efforts.

Option B: Likely to be dependent and influenced easily. No, I think high internals are more independent. They don't rely much on others because they think their own actions matter.

Option C: Achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, prefer tasks based on skills. That sounds right because if you think your efforts matter, you'd focus on skills and achievements.

Option D: More passive and waits for others. That doesn't fit. High internals are proactive, not passive.

Option E: Unsuccessful and lacking ambition. No, high internals are usually more successful because they take control of their actions.

Option F: Feels they have little influence. That's external locus, so no.

Option G: Prefers luck over skills. No, high internals like tasks where skill matters, not chance.

Option H: Blames others. Maybe externals do that because they don't take responsibility. Internals would take responsibility.

Option I: More anxiety due to external events. Hmm, maybe. But I'm not sure. If you believe you control your outcomes, you might be less anxious about external things because you focus on what you can control.

So putting it together. The correct answer should describe someone who takes control, is independent, and prefers tasks based on skill. That's option C.

The correct answer is the option that describes a person with high internality as someone who believes they control their outcomes through their own efforts, is independent, achievement-oriented, and prefers tasks based on skill rather than chance.
