Okay, so I have this question about Christopher Heath Wellman's position on nation-states and immigration. Hmm, I remember Wellman is a philosopher who writes about political philosophy, especially topics related to justice, borders, and immigration. I think his stance is often discussed in debates about open borders versus state sovereignty.

The question gives me options from A to J, and I need to figure out which one correctly states Wellman's position. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants. I seem to recall that Wellman argues that states have a right to control their borders, but I'm not sure if it's a presumptive right or if there are exceptions. I think he might argue that states have a right to close borders based on self-determination or protecting the common good, but perhaps not absolutely.

Option B suggests that nation-states have an obligation to close borders to protect citizens. That sounds a bit too strong. I don't think Wellman says they must always close bordersâ€”maybe that they can, but not that they're obligated to.

Option C claims closing borders is inherently racist. I don't think Wellman would agree with that. He probably doesn't frame border control as racist but rather as a matter of state sovereignty.

Option D says anti-egalitarianism is incompatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. I'm not sure about this. I think Wellman might argue that you can be anti-egalitarian in a way that's compatible with cosmopolitanism, maybe that's what he's saying. Or perhaps the opposite.

Option E is the opposite of D. So if I'm correct about D, E would be correct. But I need to think more.

Option F states that nation-states must open borders to the least well-off. That sounds more like a cosmopolitan argument, perhaps from someone like Joseph Carens. Wellman, on the other hand, is more skeptical of open borders, I believe.

Option G is about entirely open borders, which I don't think Wellman supports. He's more for state sovereignty, so he probably doesn't think borders should be completely open.

Option H suggests abolishing nation-states for a global government. That sounds too extreme for Wellman. He's more about justifying the state's authority, not eliminating it.

Option I says potential immigrants have a right to cross any border. That's the open borders view, which I don't think Wellman supports. He argues for state's rights over that.

Option J states that nation-states should prioritize their citizens' needs over immigrants. I think this aligns with Wellman's stance. He emphasizes the importance of states fulfilling their obligations to their own citizens, which might mean prioritizing them.

Wait, but what about the first option? Option A says a presumptive right to close borders to all potential immigrants. So Wellman might argue that states have a right to control immigration, but perhaps not that they can close borders to everyone. It's more about having the authority to decide who can enter, not necessarily to close completely.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: Wellman's work often centers on the idea of "self-determination" and the moral legitimacy of states enforcing their borders. He argues that states have a right to control immigration because they have a duty to their own citizens, which might tie into option J.

So, putting this together, I think Wellman's position is that nation-states should prioritize their citizens' needs over potential immigrants. That would make option J the correct answer.

Christopher Heath Wellman's philosophical stance on immigration and nation-states emphasizes the moral legitimacy of state sovereignty and the importance of nations fulfilling their obligations to their own citizens. He argues that states have a right to control their borders based on principles of self-determination and the common good. While he acknowledges the complexities of immigration, his position does not support entirely open borders or the abolition of nation-states. Instead, he advocates for prioritizing the needs of a nation's citizens over potential immigrants. This aligns with the idea that nation-states should prioritize their own citizens' needs, making option J the correct choice.

Answer: J
