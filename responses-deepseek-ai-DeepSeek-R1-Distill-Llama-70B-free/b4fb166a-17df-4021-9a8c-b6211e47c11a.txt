Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the history of marketing, and I need to figure out when the production period ended. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about marketing eras.

From what I remember, marketing has gone through several distinct periods or eras, each with different focuses. The first one I think is the production period. I believe this was when the focus was mainly on producing as much as possible because the supply was limited. The idea was that if you made a lot, people would buy it because there wasn't enough to go around.

So when did this production period end? I think it was towards the end of the 19th century. Wait, maybe the late 1800s. I remember something about this being the time when the Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and production capabilities were increasing. But the production period is supposed to be when production was the main concern, so perhaps it ended when other factors like sales and marketing became more important.

I think the next period after production was the sales period. That probably started when companies realized that just producing a lot wasn't enough; they needed to persuade people to buy their products. So when did that shift happen? I'm pretty sure it was in the late 1800s, so the production period would have ended around then.

Looking at the options, option F is "In the late 1800s." That seems to fit. Let me double-check. The production era is often cited as ending in the late 19th century, moving into the sales era in the early 20th century. So yes, I think F is correct.

The production period in marketing history ended in the late 1800s, transitioning into the sales era as companies began to focus more on persuading consumers to buy their products.
