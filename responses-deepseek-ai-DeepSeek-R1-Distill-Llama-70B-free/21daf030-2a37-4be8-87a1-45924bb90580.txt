Okay, so I need to find the digit in the 1001st place after the decimal point for the fraction 9/28. Hmm, I remember that to find the decimal expansion of a fraction, I can perform long division. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll try dividing 9 by 28. Since 28 is larger than 9, the division will start with a decimal point. So, I'll add a decimal and zeros to 9 to make it 9.000000... and start dividing.

28 goes into 90 three times because 28*3 is 84. Subtracting 84 from 90 gives 6. Bring down the next 0, making it 60. 28 goes into 60 twice (28*2=56). Subtract 56 from 60, that leaves 4. Bring down another 0, making it 40. 28 goes into 40 once (28*1=28), subtracting gives 12. Bring down a 0, making it 120. 28 goes into 120 four times (28*4=112), subtract 112 from 120 leaves 8. Bring down a 0, making it 80. 28 goes into 80 twice (28*2=56), subtract 56 from 80 gives 24. Bring down a 0, making it 240. 28 goes into 240 eight times (28*8=224), subtract that leaves 16. Bring down a 0, making it 160. 28 goes into 160 five times (28*5=140), subtract 140 leaves 20. Bring down a 0, making it 200. 28 goes into 200 seven times (28*7=196), subtracting gives 4. Oh wait, I've seen a remainder of 4 before. That was after the first division step. So this means the decimal is starting to repeat.

Let me recap the steps:
- 9 divided by 28 is 0., and the division process gives the remainders as 6, 4, 12, 8, 24, 16, 20, and then back to 4. So the repeating cycle starts after the first digit.

Wait, let me list out the decimals I've got so far. The quotient after each step is:
3 (from 90/28), then 2 (60/28), 1 (40/28), 4 (120/28), 2 (80/28), 8 (240/28), 5 (160/28), 7 (200/28), and then it would repeat because we're back to remainder 4.

So putting it all together, the decimal expansion is 0.32142857142857..., right? Wait no, let me double-check. Wait, the first digit after decimal is 3, then 2, 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7, and then repeats. So the repeating part starts from the first digit after the decimal?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sequence. Let me recount the remainders:

After 9 divided by 28, we have the first remainder of 9 mod 28 is 9, but wait no, 9 is less than 28. So when we do 9 divided by 28, it's 0. and then we proceed.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to perform the long division step by step.

So 9 divided by 28:

- 28 goes into 9 zero times. So we write 0., and bring a 0 making it 90.
- 28 into 90: 3 times (3*28=84), subtract 84 from 90 → remainder 6.
- Bring down a 0 → 60.
- 28 into 60: 2 times (2*28=56), remainder 4.
- Bring down a 0 →40.
- 28 into 40:1 time (1*28=28), remainder 12.
- Bring down a 0 →120.
- 28 into 120:4 times (4*28=112), rem 8.
- Bring down a 0 →80.
- 28 into 80:2 times (2*28=56), rem 24.
- Bring down a 0 →240.
- 28 into 240:8 times (8*28=224), rem 16.
- Bring down a 0 →160.
- 28 into 160:5 times (5*28=140), rem 20.
- Bring down a 0 →200.
- 28 into 200:7 times (7*28=196), rem 4.
- Now, the remainder is 4, which we've seen before after the second step. So the cycle repeats from here.

So the decimal expansion is 0.3214285714285714285..., so the repeating sequence is "32142857" and then repeats again? Wait, but wait, when the remainder 4 reappears, which was after the first division step where we had remainder 6, then 4, then 12, etc. So the repeating part starts perhaps after the first digit.

Wait, perhaps the decimal is 0.32142857142857..., meaning the repeating cycle is 8 digits long. Because from the remainder 4, the next digits are 2,1,4,2,8,5,7, and then back to 3? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the decimal repeats every 6 digits, but I'm not sure. Let me write the decimal digits as I get them:

From the division, the digits after the decimal are:

3 (from 90/28),
2 (60/28),
1 (40/28),
4 (120/28),
2 (80/28),
8 (240/28),
5 (160/28),
7 (200/28),
and then back to 3 (because the remainder is 4 again, leading to 40/28=1, which would give 1 as the next digit, but wait, earlier we had 4 as the remainder after the first step where we got 2.

Wait, maybe I should list all the digits I've got from each division step:

1st digit: 3 → rem 6
2nd: 2 → rem 4
3rd:1 → rem 12
4th:4 → rem 8
5th:2 → rem24
6th:8 → rem16
7th:5 → rem20
8th:7 → rem4

Now, the 9th digit: back to rem4, which was after the second digit (2). So the next digits would be the same as starting from the third digit.

Wait, let's see:

After rem4, the next division step is:

Bring down 0 →40.

28 into 40 is 1, so 1, rem12.

Then 120 →4, etc.

So the sequence after rem4 is 1,4,2,8,5,7, and then back to rem4 again. So the cycle is 1,4,2,8,5,7, and then repeats.

Wait, but that's 6 digits? Let me count:

From rem4, the next digits are 1 (3rd digit), 4 (4th), 2 (5th), 8 (6th), 5 (7th), 7 (8th), and then rem4 again. So the cycle is 6 digits: 1,4,2,8,5,7.

Wait, but that would make the cycle length 6. So the decimal expansion is 0.3(214285) repeating. So the initial 3 is not part of the repeating cycle. The cycle starts after the first decimal digit.

So the decimal is 0.3214285714285714285..., where "214285" repeats indefinitely.

So the structure is:

Position 1: 3

Then positions 2-7: 2 1 4 2 8 5

Positions 8-13: 7 2 1 4 2 8

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the cycle wrong. Let me think again. After the first digit (3), the cycle is 214285, which is 6 digits. So the repeating part is 6 digits long.

So the decimal expansion is 0.3(214285)(214285)(214285)...

So, the first digit after decimal is 3, then starting from the second digit, the cycle of 6 digits 2,1,4,2,8,5 repeats.

Wait, is that correct? Because when I did the division steps, after the first digit 3, the next digits were 2,1,4,2,8,5,7, and then back to 3? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the sequence.

Wait, the division steps gave me after 3: 2,1,4,2,8,5,7, then back to 3. So maybe the cycle is longer. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps the correct cycle is 3214285, but that's 7 digits. Because the remainders cycle is 9 →6→4→12→8→24→16→20→4... So from 4, the cycle starts again. So how many digits are in the cycle?

Wait, let me list the remainders in order:

Start with 9.

After first step: rem 6.

Second step: rem4.

Third: rem12.

Fourth: rem8.

Fifth: rem24.

Sixth: rem16.

Seventh: rem20.

Eighth: rem4.

So when rem4 appears again at the eighth step, the cycle is from rem4 back to rem4. So the cycle length is 6 steps (from 4 to 4 again, which is 6 remainders: 4,12,8,24,16,20). So the cycle is 6 digits. So the repeating part is 6 digits.

So the decimal is 0.3 followed by the repeating cycle 214285.

Wait, because the first digit after decimal is 3, then the next digits are from the cycle.

So the decimal expansion is 0.3214285714285714285...

So positions:

1:3

2:2

3:1

4:4

5:2

6:8

7:5

8:7

Wait, but 7 is the 7th digit, and then the cycle repeats from 2 at position 8? No, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the cycle starts after the first digit, making the cycle 214285, which is 6 digits.

So position 1:3.

Positions 2-7:2 1 4 2 8 5.

Then positions 8-13:7 2 1 4 2 8.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because position 7 would be 5, and position 8 would be 7 again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me write out more of the decimal to see the pattern.

From the division steps, the digits after the decimal are:

3 (position 1), then 2 (2), 1 (3), 4 (4), 2 (5), 8 (6), 5 (7), 7 (8), then back to 2 (position9?), wait no.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me write the digits in order as per the remainders.

The first digit:3 (from 90/28).

Then:

Remainder 6 → 60/28→2, rem4.

Remainder4 →40/28→1, rem12.

Remainder12→120/28→4, rem8.

Remainder8→80/28→2, rem24.

Remainder24→240/28→8, rem16.

Remainder16→160/28→5, rem20.

Remainder20→200/28→7, rem4.

Now, rem4 is back, which was after the first 2. So the next digit would be 1 again, but wait, no. Because the next step is to take rem4 and bring down a 0, making 40, which is where we were after the first 2.

So the next digits after 7 would be 1,4,2,8,5,7, etc.

Wait, so the digits after the decimal are:

Position 1:3.

Then positions 2-8:2,1,4,2,8,5,7.

Then positions 9-14:1,4,2,8,5,7.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the cycle should repeat the same digits.

Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is 214285, which is 6 digits, and it starts from position2.

So the decimal is 0.3(214285)(214285)...

So positions 2-7:2,1,4,2,8,5.

Then positions8-13:7,2,1,4,2,8.

Wait, but that doesn't fit. Because 7 is the 7th digit, then 2 is 8th, 1 is 9th, and so on.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the cycle as 6 digits: the digits from position2 onwards repeat every 6 digits.

So the cycle is 214285, and it repeats every 6 digits.

So the decimal expansion is 0.3214285714285714285...

So the positions are:

1:3

2:2

3:1

4:4

5:2

6:8

7:5

8:7

9:1

10:4

11:2

12:8

13:5

14:7

... and so on.

Wait, but position7 is 5, position8 is7, position9 is1, etc.

So the cycle is 214285, which is 6 digits, starting from position2.

So to find the 1001st digit after decimal, I need to see where it falls in this cycle.

But wait, the first digit after decimal is position1:3.

The cycle starts from position2, so positions2-7: first cycle (digits2,1,4,2,8,5).

Then positions8-13: second cycle (7,1,4,2,8,5?) No, that doesn't seem right because from the division, after 5 comes7, then1, etc.

Wait, perhaps the cycle is actually 214285, which is 6 digits, starting from position2.

So each cycle is 6 digits.

So the positions after decimal:

1:3

2:2

3:1

4:4

5:2

6:8

7:5

8:7

9:1

10:4

11:2

12:8

13:5

14:7

15:1

16:4

... and so on.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because after 5 (position7), the next digit is7 (position8), then1 (9),4(10),2(11),8(12),5(13), etc.

So the cycle is 6 digits: 2,1,4,2,8,5. So positions2-7:2,1,4,2,8,5.

Then positions8-13:2,1,4,2,8,5 again? No, because in reality, after 5 comes7, then1,4, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the cycle. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the repeating cycle starts after the first digit, and the cycle is 6 digits: 2,1,4,2,8,5.

But then, position8 would be the next 2, but according to the division steps, after 5 comes7, not 2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to write out the decimal expansion up to, say, 15 digits to see the pattern.

From the division steps, the digits after decimal are:

3 (1st digit),

then 2 (2),1 (3),4 (4),2 (5),8 (6),5 (7),

then7 (8),1 (9),4 (10),2 (11),8 (12),5 (13),

then7 (14),1 (15),4 (16), etc.

Wait, so after the 7th digit (5), the 8th is7, 9th is1, 10th is4, etc.

So the pattern seems to be that after the initial 3, the cycle is 214285, but that's 6 digits. So the digits from position2 onwards are 2,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,...

Wait, that doesn't fit because 7 isn't part of the cycle I thought. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is longer. Let me list the digits again:

After 3, the digits are 2,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8,5,...

So the sequence from position2 is 2,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,...

Wait, that suggests that the cycle is 2142857, which is 7 digits. But earlier, the remainders suggested a cycle of 6. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the remainders.

Wait, when I did the division steps, after the first 3, I had:

2 (rem4),1 (rem12),4 (rem8),2 (rem24),8 (rem16),5 (rem20),7 (rem4).

Ah, so after 7, the remainder is4 again, which was the same as after the second digit (2). So the cycle starts from 2,1,4,2,8,5,7, and then back to 2,1,4, etc.

Wait, that would make the cycle 2142857, which is 7 digits. So the cycle length is 7 digits.

So the decimal expansion is 0.32142857142857142857..., so after the initial 3, the cycle is 2142857, repeating every 7 digits.

So positions:

1:3

2:2

3:1

4:4

5:2

6:8

7:5

8:7

9:2

10:1

11:4

12:2

13:8

14:5

15:7

16:2

... and so on.

Wait, but that would mean the cycle is 7 digits: 2,
