Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Coulomb's law. Hmm, I remember that Coulomb's law has something to do with the force between two charged particles. Let me think. Oh right, Coulomb's law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. So the formula is F = k * (q1 * q2) / r², where k is Coulomb's constant.

The question says the particles are placed twice as close to each other. So if they were originally separated by distance r, now they're at distance r/2. Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, no, the question says they are placed twice as close. So if the initial distance was d, now it's d/2. Because twice as close means the distance is halved. Oh wait, no, wait. Twice as close would be when the distance is reduced by half. Like, if you're 2 meters apart and then you're twice as close, you're 1 meter apart. Yeah, so the new distance is half the original.

So the original force F is proportional to 1/r². Let's plug in the numbers. Let's say the initial distance is r. Then the force is F = k q1 q2 / r². Now the new distance is r/2. So the new force F' would be k q1 q2 / (r/2)². 

Let me compute that denominator. (r/2) squared is r²/4. So F' = k q1 q2 / (r²/4) ) which is the same as 4 * k q1 q2 / r². So F' is 4 times F. So the force becomes four times as strong as before.

Wait, but the options are about how the force changes when they're placed twice as close. So the initial scenario is at some distance, and moving them to half that distance increases the force by a factor of 4. So the force is four times stronger.

Looking at the options, option A is four times as strong. Option F is sixteen times, which would be if the distance was a quarter, because (1/(1/4)^2) is 16. But we're only halving the distance, so 4 times. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says "placed twice as close to each other experience a force..." So when you're twice as close, that means the distance is half. So the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. So when distance is halved, force increases by 2²=4. So yes, four times as strong. So answer A is correct.

Coulomb's law states that the force between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, expressed as \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \( r \) is the distance. If the particles are placed twice as close to each other, the distance becomes half of the original value (\( r/2 \)). Substituting this into the formula, the new force \( F' \) becomes:

\[
F' = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{(r/2)^2} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2/4} = 4 \cdot k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} = 4F
\]

Thus, the force becomes four times as strong when the particles are placed twice as close to each other. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

A: four times as strong

Answer: A
