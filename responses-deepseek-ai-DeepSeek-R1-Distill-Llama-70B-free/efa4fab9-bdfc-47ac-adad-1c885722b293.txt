Okay, so I have this question about unemployment insurance taxes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says an employer has a total taxable payroll of $100,000. They need to pay both federal and state unemployment insurance taxes. The rates given are 0.4% for federal and 2.7% for state.

Alright, so I guess I need to calculate each tax separately and then see which option matches.

First, let's tackle the federal part. The rate is 0.4%, so I multiply $100,000 by 0.4%. Wait, how do I calculate percentages? Oh right, percentage means per hundred, so 0.4% is 0.004 in decimal.

So federal tax would be 100,000 * 0.004. Let me do that math. 100,000 times 0.004 is 400. So that's $400.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, no. Because sometimes I get confused between the employer's part and the employee's part, but wait, no, in unemployment insurance, I think it's only the employer who pays, right? So yeah, the employer pays both the federal and state portions.

So federal is 0.4% of 100k, which is 400. Then the state is 2.7%. Let me calculate that. 100,000 * 0.027. Hmm, 0.027 is 2.7%, so 100k times 0.027.

Let me compute that. 100,000 * 0.027. Well, 100,000 * 0.02 is 2,000. 100,000 * 0.007 is 700. So adding those together, 2,000 + 700 equals 2,700. So state tax is $2,700.

So the employer pays $400 to the federal government and $2,700 to the state.

Looking at the options:

Option C says $400 and $2,700. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 300 and 2800

B: 300 and 2700

C: 400 and 2700

D: 450 and 2750

E: 500 and 2600

F: 350 and 2650

G: 600 and 2400

H: 450 and 2550

I: 500 and 2500

J: 400 and 2600

So option C matches my calculations. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine how much the employer pays in unemployment insurance taxes, we calculate the federal and state taxes separately based on the given rates and the total taxable payroll of $100,000.

1. **Federal Tax Calculation**:  
   The federal unemployment tax rate is 0.4%. Converting this to a decimal gives 0.004.  
   \[
   \text{Federal Tax} = \$100,000 \times 0.004 = \$400
   \]

2. **State Tax Calculation**:  
   The state unemployment tax rate is 2.7%. Converting this to a decimal gives 0.027.  
   \[
   \text{State Tax} = \$100,000 \times 0.027 = \$2,700
   \]

Thus, the employer pays \$400 to the federal government and \$2,700 to the state government. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**C: \$400 and \$2,700**

C
