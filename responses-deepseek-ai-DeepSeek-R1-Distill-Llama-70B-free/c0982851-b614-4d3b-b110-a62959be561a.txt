Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of azomethane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says it's a first-order reaction, and that at 600°K, it takes 30 minutes for the concentration to decrease to half its original value. They're asking what percentage remains after 60 minutes. Right, so first-order reactions have a specific way they behave over time.

Wait, for a first-order reaction, the rate depends on the concentration of one reactant. The key formula I remember is the half-life formula, which is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k, where k is the rate constant. Oh right, because for first-order, the half-life is independent of the initial concentration.

So the problem gives me that the half-life is 30 minutes. That makes sense because it takes 30 minutes for the concentration to drop to half. So I can find the rate constant k from this.

Calculating k: t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k → k = ln(2)/t₁/₂. Plugging in the numbers: ln(2) is approximately 0.693, and t is 30 minutes. So k = 0.693 / 30 ≈ 0.0231 per minute.

Wait, but the question asks about 60 minutes. So I need to find the concentration after that time. For a first-order reaction, the concentration over time is given by [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt). Alternatively, since we know the half-life, maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many half-lives have passed.

Oh right, because each half-life reduces the concentration by half, regardless of the starting point. So 60 minutes is two half-lives. Because 30 minutes is one, so 60 is two.

So starting at 100% concentration, after one half-life (30 min), it's 50% left. After another half-life (60 min total), it's 25% left, which is 1/4 of the original concentration. So the remaining percentage is 25%, which is 1/4.

Looking at the options, option E is 1/4. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check using the formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute it more directly.

Using [A] = [A]₀ * (1/2)^(t / t₁/₂). So t is 60, t₁/₂ is 30. So t/t₁/₂ is 2. So (1/2)^2 is 1/4. Yep, same result. So 25% remains, which is 1/4, option E.

For the first-order decomposition of azomethane, the half-life is given as 30 minutes. In a first-order reaction, the concentration decreases by half with each half-life. After 60 minutes, two half-lives have elapsed. 

Starting with 100% of the initial concentration:
- After the first half-life (30 minutes), 50% of the concentration remains.
- After the second half-life (60 minutes), 25% of the concentration remains.

Thus, 25% of the azomethane originally present remains after 60 minutes, which corresponds to **1/4**. 

The correct answer is **E: 1/4**.

Answer: E
