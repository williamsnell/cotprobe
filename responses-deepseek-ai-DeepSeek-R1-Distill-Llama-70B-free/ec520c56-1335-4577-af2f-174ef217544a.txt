Question:

A debtor owed a creditor $750 on an old debt. On July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor "is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. " Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?

Options:

A: There was no mutuality of obligation.
B: The creditor's claim was based on hearsay.
C: The promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation.
D: It was violative of the statute of frauds.
E: The debtor was under duress when he made the promise.
F: The debtor had no legal capacity to enter into the agreement.
G: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.
H: The promise was not made in a formal legal setting.
I: It was not supported by new consideration.
J: The debtor did not provide a written agreement for the promise.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with the statute of limitations and whether an oral promise to pay a debt is enforceable. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The scenario is that a debtor owed a creditor $750, but the debt was barred by the statute of limitations on July 1. Then, on August 1, the debtor overheard the creditor calling him a deadbeat at a party. Feeling guilty, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay the $750 by September 1. But when September 1st came, the debtor refused to pay. Now, the creditor is suing, and we need to determine the strongest ground for the debtor to argue that the oral promise isn't enforceable.

The options are from A to J, each pointing to a different legal principle. I remember that when a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, it means the creditor can no longer sue to recover it. But sometimes, debtors can revive the debt if they make a new promise. I think the key here is whether that new promise is enforceable.

So, what makes a promise to pay a barred debt enforceable? I recall something about consideration. In contract law, for a promise to be binding, there usually needs to be considerationâ€”something of value exchanged. But when it comes to an existing debt, if the debt is already barred, the creditor can't enforce it. If the debtor promises to pay it again, that promise might not be enforceable unless there's new consideration.

Wait, but I also remember something about "past consideration." If the consideration for the promise is something that's already been done, like the original debt, that's not sufficient. So, if the debtor's promise is based on the old debt, which is past consideration, the promise wouldn't be supported by new consideration, making it unenforceable.

Looking at the options, option I says "It was not supported by new consideration." That seems relevant. Because the original debt was already barred, the creditor can't enforce it. The debtor's promise to pay it again without anything new (like a discount or some other benefit) wouldn't have consideration, so the promise isn't binding.

Let me think about other options. Option G says the debt was already barred by the statute of limitations. But I think that alone might not be enough because the debtor made a new promise. The creditor could argue that the promise restarted the clock, but only if the promise was valid. So G might not be the strongest ground because the issue is the enforceability of the new promise.

Option D is about the statute of frauds. I don't think this applies here because the statute of frauds typically requires certain contracts to be in writing, like contracts involving land or those that can't be performed within a year. A promise to pay a debt doesn't fall under that, so D is probably not correct.

Option A is about mutuality of obligation. I'm not sure how that applies here. The debtor made a promise, but if there's no consideration, then it's a unilateral promise without a contract.

Option C says the promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation. While that's true, the enforceability doesn't depend on the debtor's motivations but on the legal elements. So C is probably not the strongest argument.

Option E suggests duress, but there's no indication the debtor was forced or threatened. He just felt guilty after overhearing the creditor's comment, so E doesn't apply.

Option F talks about legal capacity. There's nothing in the scenario indicating the debtor couldn't enter into a contract, so F is out.

Option J is about a written agreement. Again, unless the statute of frauds applies, oral promises are generally acceptable. Since the debt isn't covered by the statute of frauds, J isn't the issue.

Option B is about hearsay, which relates to evidence, not the enforceability of the contract itself. So B isn't the right reason.

Option H says it wasn't made in a formal setting. I don't think that matters because contracts can be made anywhere. So H is irrelevant.

So, circling back, the main issue is the lack of new consideration. The original debt is past consideration, so the new promise to pay it isn't supported by anything new. Therefore, the promise isn't enforceable. So the strongest ground is option I.

The question revolves around whether an oral promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations is enforceable. The key issue is the enforceability of the debtor's oral promise, which hinges on the presence of consideration. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration, meaning something of value must be exchanged. In this case, the debt was already barred by the statute of limitations, so the creditor could no longer enforce it. When the debtor made a new oral promise to pay, the question arises whether this promise is supported by new consideration.

The original debt constitutes past consideration, which is insufficient to make the new promise enforceable. Without new consideration, the promise to pay the barred debt lacks the necessary legal foundation to be binding. This makes the absence of new consideration the strongest ground for arguing that the oral promise is unenforceable.

Other options are less relevant. The statute of limitations (Option G) alone does not invalidate the new promise, as the issue is the enforceability of the promise itself. The statute of frauds (Option D) does not apply because the promise to pay a debt does not fall under the categories requiring a written agreement. Likewise, guilt (Option C) and the informal setting (Option H) do not affect the enforceability of the promise. Duress (Option E) and lack of legal capacity (Option F) are not supported by the facts. Hearsay (Option B) pertains to evidence, not the enforceability of the contract, and the absence of a written agreement (Option J) is irrelevant since the statute of frauds does not apply. Mutuality of obligation (Option A) is also not the central issue here.

Thus, the strongest ground is that the promise was not supported by new consideration.
