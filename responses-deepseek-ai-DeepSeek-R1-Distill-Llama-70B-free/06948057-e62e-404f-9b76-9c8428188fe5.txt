Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?

Options:

A: The gun discharged accidentally.
B: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.
C: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.
D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.
E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.
F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.
G: He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.
H: He did not know the daughter was present.
I: He intended only to wound the friend.
J: He was unaware of the elements of malice.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with murder charges and possible defenses. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a defendant was angry at his friend because the friend married the defendant's ex-girlfriend. One afternoon, while the friend is painting his house, the defendant shoots at him. The shot misses the friend but hits and kills the friend's daughter. Now, the defendant is charged with first-degree murder of the daughter.

Looking at the statutes provided: Section 169 defines first-degree murder as an unlawful and intentional killing with malice aforethought. Section 170 says malice is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take another's life.

The question is asking which established fact would provide the defendant's best defense. So I need to figure out what each option means in terms of the legal elements here.

Let me start by recalling what murder in the first degree requires. It's intentional killing with malice aforethought. Malice can be express or implied. Express malice is when the intent to kill is deliberate, like aiming and shooting someone. Implied malice might come into play in other situations, like during felony murder or when acting with extreme disregard for human life.

In this case, the defendant shot at his friend with the intent to kill him. But he missed and killed the daughter instead. So, the key here is whether the defendant had malice aforethought towards the daughter. Because if he intended to kill the friend but the bullet hit the daughter, does that transfer the malice?

I remember something called the "doctrine of transferred intent." This is when the intent to kill one person is transferred to another who is actually harmed. So if the defendant intended to kill the friend, but killed the daughter instead, the malice is transferred, making him guilty of murdering the daughter.

So the defendant's intent was to kill the friend, which would satisfy the malice requirement for first-degree murder of the daughter under transferred intent.

Now, looking at the options, which one could serve as a defense against this charge.

Option A: The gun discharged accidentally. If the discharge was accidental, maybe the shooting wasn't intentional. But the question says he fired a shot at the friend, so it seems intentional. But if it was accidental, then perhaps there was no intent, so no malice. But I'm not sure if this is the best option because the facts say he fired the shot, implying intent.

Option B: The killing was due to negligence in missing. Negligence would relate more to manslaughter, not murder. But first-degree murder requires intent, so if it's just negligence, maybe it reduces the charge. But the defendant's intent was to kill the friend, so transferred intent would still apply for the daughter's murder.

Option C: Under the influence of alcohol. Voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent. But first-degree murder requires malice, which is an intent to kill. If he was drunk, maybe he couldn't form that intent. However, in many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense to malice murder because it's considered a general intent crime, but I'm not sure. This could be a possible defense, but I'm not certain it's the best option.

Option D: Bullet was deflected. So the bullet didn't hit the intended target. That's about how the killing happened, but the intent was still there. Transferred intent would still apply because he intended to kill the friend, so the deflection doesn't matter. So this doesn't help.

Option E: Acting out of anger without deliberate intention. If he acted in the heat of passion, that might reduce it to second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter. But the statute here defines malice as deliberate intention. So if he wasn't deliberate, maybe no malice. But he fired a gun, which seems deliberate. So this might not work because the action itself shows intention.

Option F: Intended to scare, not kill. If he didn't intend to kill, but only scare, then maybe no express malice. But if he fired a gun at someone, that's a deadly force. Intent to kill is inferred from the act. So this might not hold up, but if he can prove he didn't intend to kill, maybe it's a defense. But given the scenario, he shot at the friend, which seems like intent to kill.

Option G: Intended to kill the friend, not the daughter. This is about transferred intent. The law says that the intent transfers, so he's still guilty of the daughter's murder. So this doesn't help his defense.

Option H: Didn't know the daughter was present. If he didn't know she was there, maybe he couldn't have intended to kill her. But under transferred intent, it doesn't matter. His intent towards the friend is transferred. So this might not be a defense.

Option I: Intended only to wound the friend. If he only wanted to hurt, not kill, then maybe malice isn't present. But if he used a deadly weapon like a gun, intent to kill can be inferred. So this could be a possible defense, but again, using a gun might negate that.

Option J: Unaware of the elements of malice. Ignorance of the law isn't a defense. So this doesn't help.

Wait, so the question is about the best defense. The defendant's best chance is to argue that he didn't have malice towards the daughter, but under transferred intent, his intent to kill the friend makes him guilty of the daughter's murder.

So which option could negate the malice? If he didn't have the intent to kill anyone, perhaps. Let's look at options F and I.

Option F says he intended to scare, not kill. So if he only wanted to scare the friend, maybe he didn't have express malice. But firing a gun at someone could be considered an intent to kill. However, if he can show he didn't intend to kill, that might negate malice.

Similarly, option I says he intended only to wound the friend. So, if he intended to shoot the friend but not kill him, maybe that reduces the charge. But again, using a gun might imply intent to kill.

Wait, the statute says malice is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take another's life. So, if he intended to kill, malice is express. But if he didn't intend to kill, but only to wound, then maybe no express malice. But is that possible when using a gun?

In some cases, intent to wound can be sufficient for murder if the wound is fatal, but I think that's more about transferred intent. Alternatively, if the defendant only intended to wound the friend, but the bullet killed the daughter, then maybe the intent to kill the daughter isn't there, but the intent to wound the friend is transferred. But I'm not sure if transferred intent applies in that case.

Wait, transferred intent usually applies when the intended harm towards one person results in harm to another. So if he intended to kill the friend, the intent transfers to the daughter, making him guilty of her murder. But if he intended only to wound the friend, does that intent transfer? Or does it only transfer the same level of intent. So if he intended to wound the friend, and the wound kills the daughter, does that make him guilty of murdering the daughter with the intent to wound? That doesn't make sense because murder requires intent to kill.

Alternatively, the transferred intent would transfer the specific intent, so if he intended to wound, but the act resulted in death, maybe it's manslaughter, not murder.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. So, if the defendant intended to wound the friend, and as a result, the daughter is killed, then under transferred intent, does that make him guilty of murder? Or would it be a different charge?

I think transferred intent applies to the same type of crime. So if he intended to kill the friend, then the killing of the daughter is murder. If he intended to wound the friend, then the wounding transfers, but since the daughter was killed, perhaps it's considered murder as well because the act was done with intent to commit a violent felony (like assault), leading to felony murder. But felony murder is a different concept and may not apply here.

Wait, but the original charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation and deliberation. So if the defendant didn't intend to kill the daughter, but only to wound the friend, maybe he didn't have the specific intent required for first-degree murder of the daughter.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Another angle: the best defense would be to show that he didn't have malice towards the daughter. So if he didn't intend to kill her, but the intent is transferred from the friend, then he's guilty. So maybe the only way to avoid that is to show that he didn't have intent to kill the friend either.

Wait, but in the scenario, he fired a shot at the friend. So that shows he intended to kill the friend. So under transferred intent, he's guilty of the daughter's murder.

So what options are left? Looking at the options, the best defense would be to negate the malice, either by showing no intent to kill or that the killing was accidental.

Option A says the gun discharged accidentally. If it was an accident, then there was no intent to kill, so no malice. But the question says he fired a shot at the friend, so it's intentional. So maybe this isn't applicable unless the discharge was accidental beyond his control, like a mishap. But the fact that he aimed and fired suggests intent.

Option F says he intended to scare, not kill. If he can prove that, then he didn't have the intent to kill, so no malice. But is that plausible when he fired a gun? Courts might infer intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon.

Option I says he intended only to wound the friend. Maybe that's a way to show he didn't have intent to kill, so no express malice. But again, shooting someone could be seen as intent to kill, unless it's a non-vital area.

Hmm. So which is the best option? If he didn't intend to kill, but only to scare or wound, that would negate express malice. But under the doctrine of transferred intent, if he intended to kill the friend, he's guilty of the daughter's murder. So the only way to avoid that is to show that he didn't intend to kill the friend either, which would negate the transferred intent.

Wait, but the question states that he fired a shot at the friend. So he did intend to kill the friend. So if that's the case, transferred intent applies, and he's guilty of the daughter's murder.

So perhaps the only way to avoid this is to show that the shooting was accidental, which would negate the intent. So option A might be the best defense. But I thought earlier that the facts say he fired a shot, implying intent.

Alternatively, if he was too intoxicated to form the intent, that could negate malice. Option C. But voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense to murder unless it negates specific intent. Some jurisdictions allow it to reduce murder to manslaughter.

Wait, but in this case, if he was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the deliberate intention to kill, that might negate the malice. So that's another possible defense.

So between options A, C, F, I.

Option A: Gun discharged accidentally. If true, no intent, so no malice. But the scenario says he fired a shot at the friend, which is intentional.

Option C: Under influence of alcohol. If he was too drunk to form intent, maybe no malice. But voluntary intoxication isn't always a defense, and some courts don't accept it for malice murder.

Option F: Intended to scare. So no intent to kill, thus no malice. But again, firing a gun might imply intent to kill.

Option I: Intended only to wound. So no intent to kill, thus no malice. But again, using a deadly force might imply intent to kill.

So which is better? The best defense would likely be to show that the shooting was accidental, thereby negating intent. So option A. But the scenario says he fired a shot, so maybe it's intentional.

Alternatively, if he intended to wound, option I, but the use of a gun might mean intent to kill.

Wait, maybe the answer is option F. If he intended to scare, not kill, then no malice. But a gun is a deadly weapon; intent to kill is inferred. So maybe the court wouldn't buy it. But if he can establish that he only intended to scare, maybe it works.

Alternatively, option I: intended only to wound. So, even if he used a gun, if he aimed somewhere non-lethal, like a leg, maybe intent to wound suffices. But then the bullet hit the daughter, killing her. So, under transferred intent, does that make him guilty of murder? Because the intent was to wound the friend, but the result was killing the daughter. So the transferred intent would be to wound the daughter, which isn't enough for murder. So maybe that's a way to avoid murder.

Wait, but murder requires intent to kill. So if he only intended to wound the friend, and the act resulted in the daughter's death, perhaps he's guilty of manslaughter, not murder. So option I could be a good defense because it negates the specific intent to kill, thus no malice for murder.

So comparing options A and I: If the gun discharged accidentally (A), then no intent. If he intended to wound (I), then no intent to kill, so no malice.

Which is better? I think option I is better because it directly addresses the intent to kill, which is a key element of murder. If he only intended to wound, then he didn't have express malice, so first-degree murder doesn't apply. But transferred intent might still make him guilty of murder if the intent to wound is considered sufficient. Wait, no, because murder requires intent to kill. So if he only intended to wound, then the transferred intent would be to wound the daughter, not kill her, so he wouldn't have the malice required for murder. Therefore, the charge would be reduced.

So the best defense would be option I: He intended only to wound the friend.

Wait, but let me think again. The statutes say that malice is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. So if he intended to wound, not kill, then no express malice. Therefore, murder in the first degree isn't applicable. But could he still be guilty of murder under implied malice? Or maybe manslaughter.

In that case, if the killing was intentional but without intent to kill, it might be voluntary manslaughter. But since the question is about first-degree murder, if he can show no express malice, then he's not guilty of first-degree murder.

So among the options, I think option F and I are possibilities. But I'm a bit torn between them.

Alternatively, option G: He intended to kill the friend, not the daughter. But the doctrine of transferred intent would still make him guilty of the daughter's murder. So option G doesn't help.

Wait, the question is about the best defense. So which option negates malice? If he didn't intend to kill anyone (F) or only intended to wound (I), both negate express malice.

But in the scenario, he fired a shot at the friend, which likely shows intent to kill. So if he claims he only intended to wound, maybe that's a stretch but possible.

Alternatively, if the gun discharged accidentally (A), but the scenario says he fired a shot, which is intentional. So A might not apply unless it's an accidental discharge beyond his control, but that's not indicated.

So I think the best option is I: He intended only to wound the friend. That would negate the express malice required for first-degree murder.
</think>

To determine the defendant's best defense against the charge of first-degree murder, we must analyze the legal elements of the crime and how the options provided could negate those elements. Under the statutes, first-degree murder requires an unlawful and intentional killing with malice aforethought, which is defined as a deliberate intention to take away the life of another.

The defendant fired a shot at his friend, missing him but killing the friend's daughter. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, the defendant's intent to kill the friend is transferred to the daughter, making him guilty of her murder unless a valid defense can negate the required malice.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: The gun discharged accidentally.**  
   If the gun discharged accidentally, there would be no intent to kill, and thus no malice. However, the scenario states that the defendant "fired a shot," which implies intentional action. Therefore, this option is unlikely to apply.

2. **Option B: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.**  
   Negligence could reduce the charge to manslaughter, but it does not negate the intent to kill the friend, which would still transfer to the daughter under the doctrine of transferred intent. This does not provide a strong defense.

3. **Option C: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.**  
   Voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent, but it is generally not a defense to malice murder. Courts often reject this as a valid defense, making it a weak option.

4. **Option D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.**  
   The deflection of the bullet does not negate the defendant's intent to kill the friend, which transfers to the daughter. This option does not provide a valid defense.

5. **Option E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.**  
   Acting out of anger might reduce the charge to second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, but the deliberate act of firing a gun suggests intentional conduct. This option is unlikely to succeed.

6. **Option F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.**  
   If the defendant only intended to scare the friend, he lacked the intent to kill, which would negate malice. However, firing a gun at someone is inherently dangerous and could be interpreted as intent to kill, making this defense difficult to establish.

7. **Option G: He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.**  
   The doctrine of transferred intent applies here, transferring the defendant's intent to kill the friend to the daughter. This option does not negate malice and does not provide a defense.

8. **Option H: He did not know the daughter was present.**  
   The defendant's lack of knowledge about the daughter's presence does not negate his intent to kill the friend, which transfers to the daughter. This option does not provide a defense.

9. **Option I: He intended only to wound the friend.**  
   If the defendant only intended to wound the friend, he lacked the intent to kill, which would negate malice. While the use of a gun might imply intent to kill, this option directly challenges the requirement of deliberate intention to take a life, making it a strong defense.

10. **Option J: He was unaware of the elements of malice.**  
    Ignorance of the law is not a defense. This option does not provide a valid defense.

### Conclusion:
The defendant's best defense is to argue that he intended only to
