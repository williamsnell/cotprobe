Question:

From laboratory measurements we know that a particular spectral line formed by hydrogen appears at a wavelength of 486.1 nanometers (nm). The spectrum of a particular star shows the same hydrogen line appearing at a wavelength of 485.9 nm. What can we conclude?

Options:

A: The star's brightness is fluctuating.
B: The star's size is increasing.
C: The star's size is decreasing.
D: The star's temperature is constant.
E: The star is getting hotter.
F: The star is not moving.
G: The star is rotating on its axis.
H: The star is getting colder.
I: The star is moving away from us.
J: The star is moving toward us.

Okay, so I've got this question about spectral lines and stars. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my science classes that when spectral lines shift in wavelength, it has to do with the Doppler effect. Wait, the Doppler effect is when waves change in wavelength because the source is moving relative to the observer. Like when a car passes by and the pitch of the horn changes.

The question says that a hydrogen line is at 486.1 nm in the lab. But in the star's spectrum, it's at 485.9 nm. So the star's line is a bit shorter in wavelength. Oh right, shorter wavelength means it's shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum, which is called blueshift. And blueshift happens when the source is moving towards the observer. So if the star's line is blueshifted, the star must be moving towards us.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. When a star moves towards us, the light waves get compressed, so the wavelength decreases. That's blueshift. Conversely, if it moves away, the waves stretch out, longer wavelength, which is redshift. So in this case, the star's line is at a shorter wavelength than the lab measurement, so it's blueshifted. So the star is moving toward us.

Looking at the options, option J says the star is moving toward us, which would be correct. Let me just make sure none of the other options fit. The other options talk about size, temperature, brightness, rotation. But the question is about the shift in spectral lines, which is about motion. So the only relevant options are I and J, and it's J because the wavelength is shorter.

The question involves the shift in wavelength of a spectral line, which is related to the Doppler effect. In the laboratory, the hydrogen line is measured at 486.1 nm, but in the star's spectrum, it appears at 485.9 nm. Since the star's wavelength is shorter, it indicates a blueshift, meaning the star is moving toward the observer. Among the options, only J aligns with this conclusion.
