Question:

A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho

Options:

A: Development of polycythemia
B: Formation of antibodies to RhB
C: Development of lymphocytosis
D: Formation of antibodies to RhO
E: immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother?
F: Development of leukocytosis
G: Formation of antibodies to RhD
H: Development of anemia
I: Formation of antibodies to RhC
J: Development of natural killer cells

Okay, so I've got this question here about a pregnant woman and Rho immune globulin. Hmm, I remember that Rho immune globulin is related to preventing Rh incompatibility issues. Let me think through this step by step.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman who's gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1. So that means she's pregnant for the second time, hasn't had any live births yet, and had one miscarriage before. She's at 28 weeks now, and the visit is routine. Her vital signs are normal, and the exam shows a uterus size matching 28 weeks. The ultrasound shows a male fetus without abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative, and the father's is B, Rh-positive.

Okay, so the main point here is her blood type. She's Rh-negative, and the baby's father is Rh-positive. That means the baby could inherit the Rh-positive trait. Now, I remember that when an Rh-negative mother is pregnant with an Rh-positive baby, there's a risk of Rh incompatibility. This can cause the mother's immune system to react as if the baby's blood is a foreign substance, leading to the production of antibodies against the Rh factor.

Wait, but why does this matter? Oh right, these antibodies can cross the placenta in future pregnancies and attack the baby's red blood cells, leading to a condition called erythroblastosis fetalis. But wait, that's more of a problem in subsequent pregnancies. So in this case, the mother is in her second pregnancy. Wait, but she's in her 28th week now. What's the usual timing for giving Rho immune globulin?

I think Rho immune globulin is given to prevent the mother's immune system from making these Rh antibodies in the first place. It's usually administered around 28 weeks of gestation and again postpartum if the baby is Rh-positive. Oh, right, because the first exposure during delivery might cause the mother to start producing antibodies, so the RhoGAM is meant to prevent that sensitization.

So the question is, what does this treatment prevent? Let me look at the options. The options are A through J, each with a different outcome.

Option E says "immune globulin to the patient." Oh, that's just part of the question stem, not an option, I think. Wait, the stem says the physician recommends administration of Rho... and then the options are what it's meant to prevent.

Looking at the options, they're about what the treatment prevents. The key is that Rho immune globulin prevents the formation of antibodies against Rh factors.

Wait, the mother is Rh-negative. The baby could be Rh-positive. So her immune system might make antibodies against the Rh factor in the baby's blood. Which specific Rh factor? Well, the father is B, Rh-positive, so the baby could have B or O blood, but Rh-wise, if the father is Rh-positive, the baby could be Rh-positive or maybe Rh-negative, but more likely positive unless the father has a different setup.

Wait, but the main point is that Rho immune globulin is given to prevent the mother from developing antibodies against RhD antigen. Because the most common issue is with RhD incompatibility.

Looking at the options, option G is "Formation of antibodies to RhD." So the treatment is preventing the mother from forming these antibodies, which could threaten future pregnancies.

Wait, but let me make sure. What's the difference between the options? Let's see.

Option B: Formation of antibodies to RhB. No, the immune globulin is about RhD, not RhB.

Option D: Formation of antibodies to RhO. No, because RhO isn't a thing in the same way. The ABO system is separate from the Rh system. The mother's blood type is O, but the issue is Rh incompatibility.

Option G is about RhD. That seems right because Rh incompatibility typically refers to RhD antigen issues. Rho immune globulin contains antibodies against the RhD antigen, so it's given to prevent the mother's immune system from reacting.

So the correct answer should be option G.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation. She is Rh-negative, and the father is Rh-positive, meaning the baby could inherit the Rh-positive trait. This creates a risk of Rh incompatibility, where the mother's immune system might produce antibodies against the baby's Rh-positive red blood cells. These antibodies could cross the placenta in future pregnancies, leading to complications such as erythroblastosis fetalis. To prevent this, Rho immune globulin is administered at 28 weeks' gestation and postpartum if the baby is Rh-positive. This treatment works by preventing the mother's immune system from forming antibodies against the RhD antigen, which is the primary antigen involved in Rh incompatibility.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is the one that identifies the prevention of antibody formation against the RhD antigen.

G: Formation of antibodies to RhD

Answer: G
