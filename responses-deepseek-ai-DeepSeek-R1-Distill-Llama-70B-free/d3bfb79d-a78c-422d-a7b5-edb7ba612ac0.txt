Question:

One evening, a defendant set fire to an occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second count. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will be

Options:

A: denied, because the jury's decision in a criminal trial is final.
B: denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.
C: denied, because the defendant can be found guilty of felony murder without being found guilty of arson.
D: granted, because the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other.
E: denied, because the felony murder charge stands independent of the arson charge.
F: granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.
G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.
H: granted, because the defendant was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
I: granted, as the defendant's attorney presented new evidence that could potentially change the verdict.
J: denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with felony murder and arson charges. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the scenario is that a defendant set fire to an occupied house in the evening. Because of the fire, the homeowner's daughter died. The defendant is charged with two counts: felony murder in the first count and arson in the second. The jury found him guilty on the first count but not guilty on the second. Now, the defense attorney is moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. The question is about what will happen to that motion.

I remember that felony murder is a doctrine where a person can be held liable for murder if it occurs during the commission of a felony. The underlying felony here would be arson, because setting fire to an occupied building is arson. So, if the defendant is charged with felony murder based on arson, then the key is whether the jury's verdicts make sense.

Wait, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. That seems odd because, typically, to convict for felony murder, the underlying felony must be proven. If the defendant wasn't found guilty of arson, how can he be guilty of felony murder based on that arson?

I think this is about whether the verdicts are inconsistent. Sometimes juries can return verdicts that seem contradictory, but legally, they're allowed as long as each charge is considered separately. But in this case, felony murder is directly tied to the underlying felony. So if he's acquitted of the arson, can he still be convicted of felony murder?

I'm trying to recall. I think that in some jurisdictions, felony murder requires that the defendant is guilty of the underlying felony. So if the jury acquitted him of arson, that might mean that the felony murder conviction can't stand. Because without the underlying felony, the felony murder charge isn't valid.

But wait, is that always the case? Or can the jury's decision stand even if it seems inconsistent? I remember something about the jury being able to return inconsistent verdicts in some situations, especially when the charges are different. Like, maybe the jury believed that a killing happened during a felony but didn't fully convict on the felony itself, perhaps because of some legal technicality.

But no, in felony murder, the underlying felony needs to be proven. So if the defendant is acquitted of the arson charge, maybe the felony murder conviction is invalid. Because the basis for the felony murder charge (the arson) wasn't proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

So the defense is arguing that the guilty verdict on felony murder should be set aside because the defendant was acquitted of the underlying felony. The question is whether the court will grant that motion.

Looking at the options, option C says the motion is denied because the defendant can be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of arson. Is that correct?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In some cases, like when the underlying felony is a lesser included offense, maybe the jury can convict on the felony murder without convicting on the underlying offense. Or is that not possible?

I think that felony murder requires the commission of a felony. If the defendant isn't convicted of that felony, then the felony murder charge should fail. So the two verdicts would be inconsistent. But I've heard that juries can sometimes return inconsistent verdicts, and courts usually don't disturb them unless there's a legal reason.

Wait, the key point is whether the charges are the same or not. Arson is a separate charge from felony murder. But felony murder is predicated on the commission of a felony, which in this case is arson. So if the defendant is not guilty of arson, can he be guilty of felony murder based on that same arson?

I think the answer is no, because the underlying felony must be proven. So without being convicted of arson, the felony murder charge can't stand. Therefore, the verdicts are inconsistent and the guilty verdict on felony murder should be set aside.

But looking at the options, let's see. Option C says the motion is denied because you can be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of arson. That would suggest that the verdicts are possible. But I thought that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Another possibility is that the jury could have found that the defendant committed another felony that wasn't charged, but that's not the situation here. The charges are specifically felony murder based on arson and arson as a separate charge.

So if the jury found the defendant not guilty of arson, but guilty of felony murder based on that same arson, that's inconsistent. Because to commit felony murder, the underlying felony must be proven.

Therefore, the court should grant the motion to set aside the guilty verdict because the two verdicts are inconsistent. So looking at the options, option D says the motion is granted because the verdicts are contradictory and nullify each other. Option G says granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to acquittal of both charges.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant was found guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second. So the motion is about setting aside the first count's guilty verdict. If the court agrees, then the guilty verdict on the first count would be set aside, perhaps leading to a new trial or acquittal.

So the question is whether the court can have inconsistent verdicts. I think in some cases, the court allows it, but when the charges are based on the same underlying conduct, perhaps not.

Wait, I remember a case where a defendant was convicted of felony murder but acquitted of the underlying felony. The court held that the felony murder conviction couldn't stand because the underlying felony wasn't proven. So the guilty verdict on felony murder would be reversed.

So in that case, the motion to set aside would be granted. So looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option D says granted because the verdicts are contradictory and nullify each other. But I'm not sure if "contradictory" is the right term, or if it's about legal consistency.

Option G says granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges. But in this case, the defendant is only asking about the first count, not both. So maybe G is too broad.

Wait, no, the defendant's motion is to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So the court would have to decide whether the guilty verdict on count one can stand when the defendant was acquitted on count two.

In this situation, the felony murder charge is based on the commission of the arson. Since he was acquitted of arson, the basis for the felony murder is gone. So the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge cannot stand. Therefore, the motion should be granted.

Looking at the options, option C says the motion is denied because the defendant can be guilty of felony murder without the arson. But that's incorrect because the underlying felony is required.

Option E says the motion is denied because the felony murder stands independently. That's also wrong for the same reason.

Option D says the verdicts are contradictory, which I think is correct because you can't have felony murder without the underlying felony. So the guilty on felony murder and not guilty on arson are contradictory.

Therefore, the correct answer would be either D or G.

Wait, what's the difference between D and G? D says the verdicts are contradictory and nullify each other. G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to both being acquitted.

Hmm, if the court sets aside the guilty verdict on the first count, does that mean both counts are affected? Or just the first?

In this case, the defendant's motion is only about the first count. So the court would set aside the guilty verdict on count one because it's based on the arson that he was acquitted of. So the verdict on count one is invalid. The not guilty on count two stands.

So the motion would be granted, but only as to the first count. So which option reflects that?

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Denied, because can be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of arson.—No, I think that's wrong.

Option D: Granted, because the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other.—So the guilty on count one is nullified.

Option G: Granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.—No, because the defendant wasn't acquitted on both; he was acquitted on count two.

Wait, but the question is whether the guilty verdict on count one should stand. So the court would set aside the guilty on count one because the underlying felony wasn't proven (he was acquitted on count two). So the motion is granted, and the guilty verdict is set aside.

Therefore, the correct option is either D or G. But what's the exact reasoning?

I think the correct reasoning is that the verdicts are legally inconsistent because felony murder requires the underlying felony to be proven. So without the felony, the felony murder conviction can't stand. Thus, the guilty verdict on count one is invalid.

Looking at the options, option C says the motion is denied because the defendant can be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of arson. That's incorrect because the underlying felony must be proven.

Option E says the felony murder stands independent of the arson. That's wrong because it's based on the same act.

Looking again, option C is incorrect, so the motion should be granted. So the correct options are D or G.

Wait, option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges. But the defendant was found guilty on count one and not guilty on count two. If the court grants the motion, the guilty on count one is set aside. It doesn't necessarily affect count two because he was already acquitted there.

So perhaps the better option is D, which says the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other. So the guilty on count one is nullified because of the not guilty on count two.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm pretty sure that's not right.

Wait, no. Let me think of it another way. In the case where a defendant is charged with both the underlying felony and felony murder, if the jury acquits on the underlying felony, the felony murder conviction must be reversed because the necessary element is missing.

So the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on count one should be granted. Therefore, the answer is either D or G.

Looking at the options, option C is incorrect because you can't have felony murder without the underlying felony.

So between D and G. Option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges. But the defendant was already acquitted on count two, so perhaps only count one is affected.

Wait, but the motion is only regarding count one. So the court would set aside the guilty verdict on count one, but count two's not guilty stands. So the correct answer is D, because the verdicts are contradictory, leading to the guilty verdict being nullified.

Alternatively, maybe option C is the correct answer. Wait, no. Option C says the defendant can be guilty of felony murder without the arson. I don't think that's correct because the underlying felony has to be proven.

So I think the correct answer is option C is wrong, and the motion should be granted. So the correct options are D or G.

Wait, another angle. Maybe the answer is C. Because in some jurisdictions, a defendant can be convicted of felony murder even if the underlying felony is not charged or the defendant is acquitted of it. Is that possible?

Wait, no. The felony murder rule requires that the defendant committed the underlying felony. So if the defendant is acquitted of the underlying felony, then the felony murder conviction can't stand.

Therefore, the answer should be that the motion is granted because the verdicts are inconsistent. So option D or G.

But looking at the options, the only one that says granted based on inconsistency is D and G.

Option D: granted because the verdicts are contradictory and nullify each other.

Option G: granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.

Wait, but the defendant wasn't acquitted of both. He was found guilty on one and not guilty on the other.

So which option is correct? I think the correct answer is C is wrong, so among the options, the correct one is C is denied, but wait, the options are:

A: denied because the decision is final.

B: denied because no reversible error.

C: denied, because can be guilty without being guilty of arson.

D: granted, verdicts are contradictory.

E: denied, because felony murder is independent.

So according to what I think, the defendant's motion should be granted because the verdicts are inconsistent—convicted of felony murder but acquitted of the underlying felony.

So which option aligns with that? Option D or G.

Wait, what's the difference between D and G? D says the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other. G says they're legally inconsistent leading to both being acquitted.

In this case, the defendant is only moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So the court would vacate that conviction because it can't stand without the underlying felony.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: granted, because the verdicts are contradictory.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that in some cases, juries can return inconsistent verdicts, and courts usually don't disturb them unless there's a legal reason. But in this case, the legal reason is that the felony murder requires the underlying felony.

So perhaps the answer is D. Alternatively, option C is wrong, so the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of a real case. I recall the case of People v. Jones, where the defendant was convicted of felony murder but acquitted of the underlying felony. The court held that the felony murder conviction must be reversed because the underlying felony wasn't proven.

So in that case, the court would grant the motion to set aside the guilty verdict because the two are inconsistent.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D or G.

Looking at the options again:

D: granted, because the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other.

G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.

In the scenario, the defendant is only challenging the first count. So setting aside the guilty verdict on the first count (felony murder) would mean that the first count is acquitted, but the second count's not guilty stands.

So the correct answer would be D, because the verdicts are contradictory, leading to the nullification of the guilty verdict on the first count.

Wait, but option G says both charges should be acquitted. That's not necessary because the defendant was already acquitted on the second count. So perhaps the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but I think that's incorrect.

So I'm going to go with option C being incorrect, and the correct answer being D.

The question involves a defendant charged with felony murder (based on arson) and arson as separate counts. The jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. The issue is whether the guilty verdict on felony murder can stand when the defendant was acquitted of the underlying felony (arson).

Felony murder requires the commission of a felony (in this case, arson). If the defendant is acquitted of the underlying felony, the basis for the felony murder conviction is undermined because the necessary element of the felony is missing. Therefore, the guilty verdict on felony murder cannot stand if the defendant is not guilty of the underlying felony.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The jury's decision is not final if it leads to a legally inconsistent outcome.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The inconsistency between the verdicts constitutes a reversible error.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A defendant cannot be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of the underlying felony (arson in this case).
- **Option D**: Correct. The verdicts are contradictory because felony murder requires proof of the underlying felony. The guilty verdict on felony murder is nullified by the acquittal on arson.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Felony murder is not independent of the underlying felony; it requires proof of the felony.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. This option refers to "plain error," which is not the issue here.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the verdicts are legally inconsistent, the motion only seeks to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count (felony murder), not both counts.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The issue is not whether the defendant was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but the legal inconsistency between the verdicts.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. There is no mention of new evidence in the question.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The issue is a legal inconsistency, not a non-constitutional error.

The correct answer is **Option D**, as the verdicts are contradictory, and the guilty verdict on felony murder cannot stand without proof of the underlying felony (arson).

**Answer: D**
