Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is asking which of the given compounds should be named using Roman numerals after the cation. The options are A through I, each being a different compound.

Hmm, I remember that Roman numerals are used in the names of compounds to indicate the charge of the cation, especially when the cation can have multiple charges. Like, for transition metals. So, the key here is to identify which of these compounds have cations that can have different charges, meaning those cations are typically shown with Roman numerals in their names.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: AlBr3. Aluminum bromide. Aluminum usually has a +3 charge. Since it's a fixed charge, I don't think we use Roman numerals here. So the name would just be aluminum bromide, no numerals needed.

Option B: Na2O. Sodium oxide. Sodium has a +1 charge, which is fixed. So again, no need for Roman numerals. The name is sodium oxide.

Option C: K2Cr2O7. Potassium dichromate. Chromium here is in Cr2O7^2- ion. The cation is K+, which is +1. Since potassium has a fixed charge, no Roman numerals are needed. So the name would be potassium dichromate.

Option D: CaCl2. Calcium chloride. Calcium has a +2 charge, which is fixed. So no Roman numerals needed. It's calcium chloride.

Option E: NH4Cl. Ammonium chloride. Ammonium ion is +1. Fixed charge, so no Roman numerals. Name is ammonium chloride.

Option F: H2SO4. Sulfuric acid. Acids are a bit different; they're usually named without Roman numerals because they follow a different nomenclature. The cation here is H+, but since it's part of an acid, I don't think Roman numerals apply. The name is sulfuric acid.

Option G: MgSO4. Magnesium sulfate. Magnesium has a +2 charge. Fixed, so no Roman numerals. Name is magnesium sulfate.

Option H: CuCl2. Copper(II) chloride. Copper can have different charges—like +1 (Cu+) and +2 (Cu^2+). So in the name, we use Roman numerals to indicate the charge. CuCl2 would be copper(II) chloride. So this one uses Roman numerals.

Option I: Zn(NO3)2. Zinc nitrate. Zinc typically has a +2 charge. Since it's fixed, I don't think Roman numerals are needed. The name is zinc nitrate.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, some sources might always use Roman numerals for certain metals regardless of fixed charge, but I think the rule is that Roman numerals are used when the cation can have multiple charges. So for example, iron can be Fe^2+ or Fe^3+, so Fe would need a Roman numeral. For zinc, it's usually always +2, so no numeral needed.

So the only option that fits is option H: CuCl2. Because copper can have multiple charges, so the Roman numeral II is needed to specify it's Cu^2+.

To determine which compound should be named using Roman numerals after the cation, we need to identify compounds where the cation can have multiple possible charges. Roman numerals are used to clarify the specific charge of the cation in such cases. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A: AlBr₃**  
  Aluminum bromide. Aluminum has a fixed +3 charge, so no Roman numerals are needed.  

- **B: Na₂O**  
  Sodium oxide. Sodium has a fixed +1 charge, so no Roman numerals are needed.  

- **C: K₂Cr₂O₇**  
  Potassium dichromate. Potassium has a fixed +1 charge, so no Roman numerals are needed.  

- **D: CaCl₂**  
  Calcium chloride. Calcium has a fixed +2 charge, so no Roman numerals are needed.  

- **E: NH₄Cl**  
  Ammonium chloride. The ammonium ion has a fixed +1 charge, so no Roman numerals are needed.  

- **F: H₂SO₄**  
  Sulfuric acid. Acids follow a different naming convention and do not use Roman numerals.  

- **G: MgSO₄**  
  Magnesium sulfate. Magnesium has a fixed +2 charge, so no Roman numerals are needed.  

- **H: CuCl₂**  
  Copper(II) chloride. Copper can have multiple charges (+1 or +2), so Roman numerals are used to specify the charge.  

- **I: Zn(NO₃)₂**  
  Zinc nitrate. Zinc typically has a fixed +2 charge, so no Roman numerals are needed.  

The only compound that requires Roman numerals in its name is **H: CuCl₂**, as copper can have multiple charges, and the Roman numeral II indicates the +2 charge of the copper cation.  

**Answer: H**
