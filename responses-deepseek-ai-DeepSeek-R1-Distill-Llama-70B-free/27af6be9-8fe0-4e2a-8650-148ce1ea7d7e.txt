Question:

A defendant, a nurse at a nursing home, is charged with murdering a resident at the home by adding an allegedly lethal substance to the resident's food. At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?

Options:

A: Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.
B: Yes, because the treatise is a public document and therefore exempt from the hearsay rule.
C: No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.
D: Yes, because the prosecutor is allowed to introduce evidence without calling witnesses.
E: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.
F: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.
G: Yes, because the prosecution is merely providing evidence that supports their claim.
H: No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.
I: No, because the substance's lethal nature is not relevant to the case.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a criminal trial where the defendant, a nurse, is accused of murdering a resident by adding a lethal substance to the food. The prosecutor wants to read pages from a standard medical treatise to prove that the substance is lethal. They're doing this without calling any witnesses. The question is whether this evidence is admissible.

Hmm, so the issue here is about hearsay exceptions. I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

The prosecutor is offering excerpts from a medical treatise. I think there's a specific exception for learned treatises. Let me recall: under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(18) covers learned treatises. They are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if they're called to the attention of the expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert during testimony. But wait, in this case, the prosecutor isn't calling any witnesses, so there's no expert on the stand to refer to the treatise.

Wait, but I think the rule might allow the treatise to be admitted without an expert if it's a reliable authority and used in a way that's helpful. Or maybe it's only admissible when an expert is testifying and can be questioned about it. Because if the treatise is just read into evidence without any expert, that might not fit the exception.

Looking at the options:

Option E says it's hearsay and no exception applies. Option F says yes under the learned treatise exception. Option H says no because it wasn't offered during an expert's examination.

Wait, so under Rule 803(18), the treatise must be called to the attention of the expert during cross, or the expert must have relied on it. So if the prosecutor just reads it without an expert witness, then it wouldn't qualify under that exception. Because the exception requires that the treatise be used in connection with expert testimony.

In this scenario, the prosecutor isn't calling any witnesses. So they can't use the learned treatise exception because there's no expert to vouch for it or refer to it. Therefore, the treatise would be hearsay and inadmissible.

So looking at the options again. Option E says it's hearsay, no exception, so not admissible. Option H says no because not offered during expert's examination, which also points to the same conclusion.

Wait, but waitâ€”what about if the treatise is a public document? Option B says it's a public document, so exempt. But no, public documents are under a different exception, like Rule 803(8), which includes records of public agencies, but a medical treatise isn't a public document. So B is incorrect.

Option F says yes under the learned treatise exception, but I think that's only when an expert is involved. So F would be incorrect in this case because there's no expert.

So the correct answer must be either E or H. The question is whether the treatise is hearsay and not within any exception.

But wait, is a treatise considered hearsay? Yes, because it's a statement (written) made out of court, offered for the truth. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Since the exception for learned treatises requires an expert witness, and the prosecutor isn't calling any, the treatise can't be admitted. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible because it's hearsay without an applicable exception.

So looking at the options, E says it's hearsay and no exception. H says no because not offered during expert's examination.

Wait, but another thought: is there another exception? Maybe under the rule of judicial notice? Because the lethal nature could be something the court can take judicial notice of. But usually, judicial notice is for facts that are commonly known or can be accurately determined. If the substance's lethality is not common knowledge, the court can't take judicial notice without evidence. So the prosecutor would need to present evidence, which is what they're trying to do with the treatise.

Alternatively, perhaps the treatise could be admitted as a business record? Unlikely, because a medical treatise isn't a business record. It's more of an authoritative text.

So, the only possible exception is the learned treatise exception, which isn't applicable here because there's no expert witness.

Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible because it's hearsay, and no exception applies. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another point: can the prosecutor use the treatise without an expert? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I remember that the treatise can be admitted if it's called to the attention of an expert during cross, but if the treatise is offered through an expert, then it's admissible. But in this case, the prosecutor isn't calling any expert. So they can't use the treatise as substantive evidence on their own.

So, the answer should be E: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.

The question revolves around the admissibility of excerpts from a medical treatise offered by the prosecutor to prove the lethal nature of a substance in a murder trial. The key issue is whether the treatise qualifies as admissible evidence under the hearsay rule and its exceptions.

Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies. The prosecutor is relying on the learned treatise exception under Rule 803(18) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. This exception allows admission of a learned treatise if it is called to the attention of an expert witness during cross-examination or if the expert relies on it during testimony. However, in this case, the prosecutor is not calling any witnesses, including an expert, to vouch for or refer to the treatise. Without an expert witness, the treatise cannot be admitted under the learned treatise exception.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The relevance of the substance's lethal nature to the defendant's intent does not resolve the hearsay issue.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. A medical treatise is not a public document under Rule 803(8).
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The issue is not whether the treatise must be introduced as an exhibit but whether it qualifies as hearsay.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The admissibility of evidence does not depend on whether witnesses are called but on whether it is hearsay.
- **Option E**: Correct. The treatise is hearsay, and no exception applies because there is no expert witness to invoke the learned treatise exception.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The learned treatise exception requires an expert witness, which is absent here.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The treatise's relevance does not override the hearsay rule.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While the absence of an expert is a valid concern, the primary issue is that the treatise is hearsay without an applicable exception.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The lethal nature of the substance is highly relevant to the case.

Since the treatise is hearsay and no exception applies due to the absence of an expert witness, the evidence is inadmissible.
