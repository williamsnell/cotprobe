Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a sample of 2.0 mol of CO₂ in a fixed volume of 15.0 dm³. The initial temperature is 300 K, and when 2.35 kJ of heat is supplied, the temperature increases to 341 K. We're supposed to calculate the work done, w, under the assumption that CO₂ behaves according to the van der Waals equation of state. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that the first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = q + w, but wait, sometimes I get confused about the sign conventions. I think the formula is ΔU = q - PΔV when work is done by the system, but in some conventions, it might be ΔU = q + w where w is work done on the system. I'll need to clarify that.

Wait, the standard convention is that work done by the system is considered negative. So, if the system does work on the surroundings, w is negative. So, the first law is ΔU = q - PΔV, or sometimes written as ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So, if the system does work, w is negative.

But in this problem, the volume is fixed. Oh, right! Because the problem says it's a fixed volume, so the system isn't doing any expansion work. So, ΔV is zero, which means no work is done (w = 0). But wait, is that the only kind of work? Or is there other work, like if the volume is fixed but the pressure changes, but no, expansion work is the only kind considered here, I think.

Wait, but wait. Because the volume is fixed, the system can't expand or contract, so PΔV would be zero. Therefore, the work done, w, would be zero. So in the first law, ΔU = q + w. But since w is zero, ΔU = q. So the change in internal energy is equal to the heat supplied.

Wait, but the heat supplied is 2.35 kJ. So q is +2.35 kJ because heat is added to the system. So ΔU should be +2.35 kJ. But the problem doesn't directly ask for ΔU, it asks for w, which we thought is zero. So the answer should be option C, which is 0.

Wait, but why is the van der Waals equation mentioned? If the volume is fixed, maybe the pressure changes, but does that affect the work? Hmm, no, because work is PΔV. If ΔV is zero, no work is done regardless of pressure. So the van der Waals equation probably isn't necessary here because it's about internal energy or something else, but in this case, since work is zero, maybe it's a red herring.

Wait, but wait again. Maybe I'm missing something about the van der Waals equation. Because for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. But for a van der Waals gas, the internal energy might depend on pressure or volume as well, so maybe the heat at constant volume isn't just n Cv ΔT.

Wait, yes, that's a point. For an ideal gas, at constant volume, q_v is equal to ΔU, which is n Cv ΔT. But for a real gas described by van der Waals, maybe the calculation of ΔU isn't as straightforward. But wait, the problem gives us that q is 2.35 kJ, so regardless of whether it's ideal or not, the heat added is q, and at constant volume, for any substance, ΔU = q (since w = 0). So the internal energy change is 2.35 kJ. But the question is about work done, which is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to make us think about other aspects, but I think the key point is that the volume is fixed, so no work is done. Therefore, w is zero, so the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves a sample of 2.0 mol of CO₂ occupying a fixed volume of 15.0 dm³. Initially, the temperature is 300 K, and when 2.35 kJ of heat is supplied, the temperature increases to 341 K. The task is to calculate the work done, \( w \), assuming CO₂ behaves according to the van der Waals equation of state.

Key points of analysis:

1. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: The first law is expressed as \( \Delta U = q + w \), where \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, \( q \) is the heat supplied, and \( w \) is the work done on the system. If the system does work on the surroundings, \( w \) is negative.

2. **Fixed Volume**: Since the volume is fixed, there is no expansion or contraction (\( \Delta V = 0 \)). Therefore, no expansion work is done (\( w = 0 \)).

3. **Heat and Internal Energy**: At constant volume, all the heat supplied (\( q = +2.35 \, \text{kJ} \)) goes into changing the internal energy of the system (\( \Delta U = q \)). However, the question specifically asks for \( w \), which remains zero regardless of the internal energy change.

4. **Van der Waals Equation**: While the van der Waals equation describes the behavior of real gases, it is not directly relevant here because the calculation of \( w \) depends only on \( \Delta V \), which is zero in this case.

Thus, the work done, \( w \), is zero, and the correct answer is:

C: 0
