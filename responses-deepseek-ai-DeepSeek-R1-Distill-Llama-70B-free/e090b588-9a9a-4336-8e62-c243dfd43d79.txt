Question:

A married couple sued a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract in failing to live up to promises he made regarding the couple's purchase of a residence. They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn't pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is admissible  even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.
B: The testimony is admissible because the agent's statement is considered a present sense impression.
C: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered hearsay within hearsay.
D: The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.
E: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by the broker's employee during the course and within the scope of employment.
F: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is not an exception to the hearsay rule.
G: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by a co-conspirator during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.
I: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.
J: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered a past recollection recorded.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about hearsay and whether certain testimony is admissible. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.

So, there's a married couple suing a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract. The main issue is about a promise the broker allegedly made. The couple claims the broker promised them a $15,000 rebate at closing if they bought the home immediately. But at closing, the sellers didn't pay, saying they knew nothing about it. 

Now, in the trial against the broker, the couple subpoenas one of the broker's agents. This agent testifies that he was in a meeting where he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objects, saying it's hearsay. The question is whether the court will admit this testimony.

Hmm, hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the agent is testifying about what the broker said in a meeting. The broker is the defendant here, so the statement is being offered against him.

Wait, I remember that admissions by a party-opponent are exceptions to the hearsay rule. Specifically, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed.

So in this case, the broker is the party, and the agent is his employee. The agent's testimony is about a statement the broker made during their employment and within the scope of his duties. Therefore, that statement should be admissible as a party admission.

Looking at the options, option D says it's admissible because it's a party admission made through an authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of employment. That sounds right.

Wait, what about option E? It says it's admissible because it's a statement made by the broker's employee during the course and within the scope of employment. Isn't that similar to D? Oh, right, because party admissions cover statements made by employees in the scope of employment, so both D and E seem relevant. But wait, I think the key here is that the agent's own statement isn't the issue; it's the broker's statement that's the hearsay. So the agent is testifying about what the broker said, which is the party-opponent's own statement. So D would apply because it's the broker's statement, which is an admission.

Alternatively, E is talking about the agent's statement as a statement during employment, but the agent's testimony is about the broker's statement. So E might not be the right fit because it's about the agent's own statement, not the broker's.

Wait, no, the agent is testifying about what the broker said, so the hearsay is the broker's statement. Since the broker is the party, his statement is an admission. So yes, D applies.

Other options: option C says it's hearsay within hearsay. But that's when there's a statement within a statement. Here, it's just the broker's statement, so only one level of hearsay. So C is incorrect.

Option B talks about present sense impression, which requires the statement to be made while perceiving an event or immediately after. There's no indication that the agent made the statement right after the event, so B is probably not applicable.

Option E says it's a statement during employment. Wait, E is about the agent's statement, but actually, the agent is testifying about the broker's statement, not making a statement themselves. So E might not fit because E refers to statements made by the employee, not the employer.

So the correct answer should be D. The testimony is admissible because it's a party admission made through an authorized agent within the scope of employment.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony regarding a statement made by the broker, which the agent overheard and testified about. The broker objected, claiming hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2), a statement is not considered hearsay if it is an admission by a party-opponent, made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed.

In this case, the broker is the party, and the agent is his employee. The agent testified about a statement the broker made during their employment and within the scope of his duties. This qualifies as a party admission, making the testimony admissible. 

Option D correctly identifies this as a party admission made through an authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of employment. Other options, such as E, are less precise because they focus on the agent's statement rather than the broker's statement, which is the key issue here. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D**

Answer: D
