Okay, so I've got this problem here where Paul Murphy wants to have $10,000 in his account after 10 years, and the interest is compounded annually at 4%. I need to figure out how much he should invest now. Hmm, I remember this is a present value problem. 

Wait, present value... right, the formula for present value when dealing with compound interest is something like PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Oh yeah, FV is the future value, which is $10,000 in this case. The rate r is 4%, so that's 0.04 as a decimal. And n is the number of years, which is 10 here.

So plugging in the numbers, PV = 10000 / (1 + 0.04)^10. Let me calculate the denominator first. 1 + 0.04 is 1.04. Now, I need to raise that to the power of 10. I'm a bit rusty on exponentials, but I think 1.04^10 is approximately... wait, I remember that the rule of 72 says that at 4%, money doubles in about 18 years (72/4=18). So in 10 years, it's less than double. Maybe around 1.48 times? Wait, let me think more accurately. 

Alternatively, I could calculate it step by step. Let's see, 1.04^1 is 1.04. 1.04^2 is 1.0816. 1.04^3 is about 1.124864. 1.04^4 would be around 1.16985856. 1.04^5 is approximately 1.2166529. Hmm, but wait, that's getting tedious. Maybe I should remember that 1.04^10 is a standard value. Oh right, I think it's about 1.480244. So the denominator is approximately 1.480244.

So PV = 10000 / 1.480244. Let me do that division. 10000 divided by 1.480244. Let me approximate. 1.48 times 6756 is roughly 10,000. Because 1.48 * 6756 = 10,000? Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me do 10000 / 1.48. 

1.48 * 6756 = 1.48 * 6756. Let's see, 6756 * 1.48. 6756 * 1 is 6756, 6756 * 0.48 is, let me calculate: 6756 * 0.4 is 2702.4, 6756 * 0.08 is 540.48. So 2702.4 +540.48=3242.88. So total is 6756 + 3242.88 = 9998.88. Oh, that's very close to 10,000. So PV is approximately $6756. So looking at the options, option F is $6,756.00. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should double-check using a calculator approach. Let's see, 1.04^10. Let me compute it step by step more accurately. 

Year 1: 1.04
Year 2: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816
Year 3: 1.0816 * 1.04 = 1.124864
Year 4: 1.124864 *1.04 ≈ 1.16985856
Year 5: 1.16985856 *1.04 ≈ 1.2166529024
Year 6: 1.2166529024 *1.04 ≈ 1.265319018
Year 7: 1.265319018 *1.04 ≈ 1.315931779
Year 8: 1.315931779 *1.04 ≈ 1.368569761
Year 9: 1.368569761 *1.04 ≈ 1.423312812
Year 10: 1.423312812 *1.04 ≈ 1.480244285

So 1.04^10 is approximately 1.480244. So 10000 / 1.480244 = let me compute that precisely. 

Dividing 10000 by 1.480244:

First, 1.480244 * 6756 = ?

Let me compute 1.480244 * 6756.

Compute 6756 * 1.48.

Wait, I think I did this earlier, but maybe I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute 10000 / 1.480244.

Let me approximate. Let's say 1.480244 = approx 1.4802.

I'll set up the division: 10000 ÷ 1.4802.

Let me write this as 10000 ÷ 1.4802 ≈ ?

Perhaps I can use the reciprocal. 1/1.4802 is approximately 0.675564.

So 10000 * 0.675564 ≈ 6755.64.

So approximately $6,755.64, which rounds to $6,756. So option F is the correct answer.

To determine how much Paul Murphy should invest now to have $10,000 in his account after 10 years with annual compound interest at 4%, we use the present value formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Here:
- \( FV = \$10,000 \) (future value),
- \( r = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 10 \) (number of years).

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
(1 + 0.04)^{10} = 1.04^{10} \approx 1.480244
\]

Now, compute the present value:

\[
PV = \frac{10,000}{1.480244} \approx 6,756.00
\]

Thus, Mr. Murphy should invest approximately **$6,756.00** now. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**F: $6,756.00**

Answer: F
