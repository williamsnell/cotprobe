Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 2x³ + e^x = 10. And I'm supposed to use the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm, I remember that Newton-Raphson is a numerical method used to find roots of equations, right? It's an iterative method, so I'll need to start with an initial guess and then improve that guess step by step.

First, I think I should write the equation in the form f(x) = 0. So, subtracting 10 from both sides, it becomes 2x³ + e^x -10 = 0. So f(x) = 2x³ + e^x -10.

The Newton-Raphson formula is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). That means I need to compute f(x) and its derivative f'(x) at each step.

Let me compute f'(x). The derivative of 2x³ is 6x², the derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of -10 is zero. So f'(x) = 6x² + e^x.

Now, I need an initial guess, x_0. I'm not given one, so I'll have to pick a reasonable number. Let me think about where the root might lie. If x is 2, then 2*(8) =16, and e² is about 7.38, so 16+7.38=23.38, which is way larger than 10. So maybe a smaller x.

What about x=1? Then 2*(1)=2, e^1 is about 2.718, so total is 4.718, which is less than 10. So between x=1 and x=2, the function moves from 4.718 to 23.38, crossing 10 somewhere in between. So the root is between 1 and 2.

Wait, let me try x=1.5. 2*(3.375)=6.75, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. So 6.75 +4.4817=11.2317, which is a bit over 10. So the root is between 1 and 1.5.

Wait, no, wait. At x=1, f(x)=4.718, which is less than 10. At x=1.5, f(x)=11.23, which is more than 10. So the root is between 1 and 1.5. Alternatively, maybe a better initial guess is around 1.3 or so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should start with x=1. Let's try x_0=1.5 as the initial guess. Let's see.

Wait, but wait, using x=1.5 gives f(x)=11.23 which is higher than 10, so the function is increasing, so the root is between 1 and 1.5.

Alternatively, maybe x=1.3. Let's compute f(1.3):

2*(1.3)^3 = 2*(2.197)=4.394.

e^1.3 is approximately e^1=2.718, e^0.3 is about 1.349, so e^1.3=2.718 * 1.349 ≈ 3.669.

So f(1.3)=4.394 +3.669=8.063, which is less than 10. So f(1.3)=8.063, which is still below 10. So the root is between 1.3 and 1.5.

Wait, wait, no: f(1.3)=8.063, which is less than 10. f(1.5)=11.23, so the root is between 1.3 and 1.5.

Alternatively, maybe I should pick x_0=1.4. Let's compute f(1.4):

x=1.4: 2*(1.4)^3 = 2*(2.744)=5.488.

e^1.4 is e^1 * e^0.4. e^0.4 is approx 1.4918, so e^1.4≈2.718*1.4918≈4.055.

So f(1.4)=5.488 +4.055=9.543, which is still less than 10. So the root is between 1.4 and 1.5.

At x=1.45: f(x) = 2*(1.45)^3 + e^1.45.

1.45^3: 1.45*1.45=2.1025; 2.1025 *1.45≈3.0486. So 2*3.0486≈6.0972.

e^1.45: Let's see, e^1=2.718, e^0.45≈1.5683 (since e^0.4≈1.4918, e^0.05≈1.0513; 1.4918*1.0513≈1.568). So e^1.45≈2.718 *1.568≈4.263.

So f(1.45)=6.0972 +4.263≈10.36, which is just above 10. So the root is between 1.4 and 1.45.

So let's pick x_0=1.45 as the initial guess. Wait, but maybe I should start with x_0=1.4, because f(1.4)=9.543 and f(1.45)=10.36. So the function crosses 10 between 1.4 and 1.45.

Wait, but Newton-Raphson might be better with an initial guess close to the root. So maybe x_0=1.4 is better, but let's see.

Alternatively, since f(1.4)=9.543 and f(1.45)=10.36, which is pretty close. The exact root is around 1.42 perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should start with x_0=1.4.

But let's proceed with the method.

So, the first step is to compute x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f'(x_0).

So, let's compute f(x_0) and f'(x_0).

x_0=1.4.

f(x_0)=9.543 as calculated.

f'(x)=6x² +e^x.

So, f'(1.4)=6*(1.4)^2 + e^1.4.

1.4^2=1.96, so 6*1.96=11.76.

e^1.4≈4.055 as before.

So f'(1.4)=11.76 +4.055=15.815.

So, x_1 = 1.4 - (9.543)/15.815.

Compute 9.543/15.815 ≈ 0.603.

So x_1=1.4 - 0.603=0.797? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no: wait, f(x_0) is 9.543, which is less than 10, but wait the function is f(x)=2x³ +e^x -10, so f(x_0)=9.543-10= -0.457? Wait, wait a second, I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify this. The original equation is 2x³ +e^x =10, which I rewrote as f(x)=2x³ +e^x -10=0. So f(x)=0 when 2x³ +e^x=10.

So when I calculated f(1.4), it's 2*(1.4)^3 +e^1.4 -10 = 5.488 +4.055 -10= (5.488+4.055)=9.543 -10= -0.457.

Ah, I see! I made a mistake earlier. So f(1.4)= -0.457, not positive. That changes things.

Similarly, f(1.45)=2*(1.45)^3 +e^1.45 -10=6.0972 +4.263=10.36 -10=0.36.

So, f(1.4)= -0.457, f(1.45)=0.36. So the root is between 1.4 and 1.45.

So, initial guess x_0=1.4.

f(x_0)= -0.457.

f'(x_0)=6*(1.4)^2 +e^1.4=6*(1.96) +4.055=11.76 +4.055=15.815.

So x_1= x_0 - f(x_0)/f'(x_0) = 1.4 - (-0.457)/15.815.

Compute (-0.457)/15.815 ≈ -0.0289.

So 1.4 - (-0.0289)=1.4 +0.0289=1.4289.

So x_1≈1.4289.

Now compute f(x_1)=2*(1.4289)^3 +e^1.4289 -10.

First, 1.4289^3: 1.4289 *1.4289= approx 2.041, then *1.4289: 2.041*1.4289≈2.920.

So 2*2.920≈5.840.

e^1.4289: e^1=2.718, e^0.4289≈e^0.4=1.4918, e^0.0289≈1.0293. So e^1.4289≈2.718 *1.4918 *1.0293.

Compute 2.718 *1.4918: 2.718*1.4=3.805, 2.718*0.0918≈0.25, so total ≈4.055. Then multiply by 1.0293: 4.055*1.0293≈4.177.

So f(x_1)=5.840 +4.177 -10≈10.017 -10=0.017.

So f(x_1)=0.017, which is very close to zero. Now compute f'(x_1).

f'(x_1)=6*(x_1)^2 +e^{x_1}.

x_1=1.4289, so x_1^2= approx 2.041. 6*2.041≈12.246.

e^{x_1}=4.177 as calculated.

So f'(x_1)=12.246 +4.177≈16.423.

Now compute x_2 = x_1 - f(x_1)/f'(x_1).

f(x_1)=0.017, so 0.017/16.423≈0.001035.

So x_2=1.4289 -0.001035≈1.4279.

Now compute f(x_2)=2*(1.4279)^3 +e^{1.4279} -10.

1.4279^3: Let's compute 1.4279^2=2.039. Then 2.039 *1.4279≈2.039*1.4≈2.8546, plus 2.039*0.0279≈0.0569. So total≈2.9115.

2*2.9115≈5.823.

e^{1.4279}= e^1.4279. Let me calculate more accurately. Let's compute 1.4279.

I know that ln(4.177)=1.4289, wait, no, that's for x_1. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps with the Taylor series around x=1.4.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute e^1.4279 as e^{1.4279}=e^{1.4} * e^{0.0279}.

e^{0.0279}≈1 +0.0279 + (0.0279^2)/2 + (0.0279^3)/6.

0.0279^2≈0.000778, 0.000778/2=0.000389.

0.0279^3≈0.0000216, divided by 6≈0.0000036.

So e^{0.0279}≈1 +0.0279 +0.000389 +0.0000036≈1.0282926.

So e^{1.4279}=e^{1.4} *1.0282926≈4.055 *1.0282926≈4.055 *1.0283.

Compute 4 *1.0283=4.1132, 0.055 *1.0283≈0.0566. So total≈4.1132+0.0566≈4.1698.

So f(x_2)=5.823 +4.1698 -10≈9.9928 -10≈-0.0072.

So f(x_2)= -0.0072.

Now compute f'(x_2)=6*(x_2)^2 +e^{x_2}.

x_2≈1.4279, so x_2^2≈2.039.

6*2.039≈12.234.

e^{x_2}=4.1698 as calculated.

So f'(x_2)=12.234 +4.1698≈16.4038.

Now compute x_3 = x_2 - f(x_2)/f'(x_2).

f(x_2)= -0.0072.

So -0.0072 /16.4038≈-0.0004389.

So x_3≈1.4279 - (-0.0004389)=1.4279 +0.0004389≈1.4283.

Compute f(x_3)=2*(1.4283)^3 + e^{1.4283} -10.

1.4283^3: 1.4283^2=2.040, then 2.040 *1.4283≈2.040*1.4=2.856, 2.040*0.0283≈0.0578, total≈2.9138.

2*2.9138≈5.8276.

e^{1.4283}≈ same as e^{1.4279}, maybe a bit higher. Let's approximate it as 4.17.

So f(x_3)=5.8276 +4.17≈9.9976 -10≈-0.0024.

Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use linear approximation for e^{x} around x=1.4279.

But maybe it's getting too detailed. Let me proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that after a couple of iterations, the value is approaching 1.428.

Looking back at the options, the choices are:

A: 3.14

B:2.05

C:2.89

D:-1.23

E:2.56

F:1.42

G:0.98

H:0.75

I:1.85

J:3.67

Looking at the options, F is 1.42, which is close to our approximate solution of around 1.428. So perhaps the correct answer is F:1.42.

Wait, but wait, let me check with x=1.42.

Compute f(1.42)=2*(1.42)^3 +e^{1.42} -10.

1.42^3: 1.42*1.42=2.0164, then *1.42≈2.863.

2*2.863≈5.726.

e^1.42: Let's compute e^1.42.

We know e^1.4≈4.055, e^0.02≈1.0202. So e^1.42= e^1.4 * e^0.02 ≈4.055 *1.0202≈4.138.

So f(1.42)=5.726 +4.138 -10≈9.864 -10≈-0.136.

Wait, that's f(1.42)≈-0.136.

Wait, but earlier when we computed x=1.4289, f(x) was about 0.017. So perhaps the correct root is between 1.42 and 1.43.

Wait, but according to the options, the closest is F:1.42. But our iterations gave us about 1.428, which is 1.43 when rounded to two decimal places, but the options don't have 1.43. So perhaps the answer is F:1.42.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me re-calculate f(1.4) correctly.

f(x)=2x³ +e^x -10.

At x=1.4: 2*(2.744) =5.488. e^1.4≈4.055. So 5.488 +4.055=9.543. So 9.543-10= -0.457. So f(1.4)= -0.457.

At x=1.42: 2*(1.42)^3=2*(2.863)=5.726. e^1.42≈4.138. So 5.726+4.138=9.864. 9.864-10= -0.136. So f(1.42)= -0.136.

At x=1.4289: 2*(1.4289)^3≈5.840, e^1.4289≈4.177, so total≈9.017, which is 9.017-10= -0.983? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.4289 cubed: 1.4289^3≈2.9115. So 2*2.9115≈5.823. e^1.4289≈4.1698. So 5.823
