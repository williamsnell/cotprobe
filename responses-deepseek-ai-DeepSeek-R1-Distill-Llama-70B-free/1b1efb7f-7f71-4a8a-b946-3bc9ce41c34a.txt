Okay, I've got this question about Mayan art and iconography. Hmm, I remember that the Maya were an ancient civilization known for their art, which often depicted various themes. Let me think about what they typically featured.

The options are A through I, each suggesting different themes. So, I need to recall what Mayan art is famous for. From what I remember, Mayan art often includes depictions of their gods, rituals, and sometimes violent scenes. Oh right, I think they had a lot of imagery related to religion and power.

Option A is mutilation and violence. I've heard that some Mesoamerican cultures, like the Aztecs, had a lot of sacrificial practices, but the Maya as well. Their art might show human sacrifice or self-mutilation, like priests cutting themselves. So that's a possibility.

Option B is stars and comets. The Maya were known for their astronomy, so maybe they depicted celestial bodies. I'm not sure if that's a prominent feature of their art or more in their writings and calendars.

Option C is infants and children. I don't recall seeing much of that in Mayan art. It might be more common in other cultures, like ancient Greek or Roman art where children are often depicted.

Option D is modern technologies. That doesn't make sense because the Maya were ancient, so they wouldn't have modern tech.

Option E is domesticated animals. The Maya did have animals like dogs, turkeys, maybe even jaguars, but were these a prominent feature in their art? I'm not too sure. I think animals were more part of their symbolic imagery, like jaguars representing power.

Option F is love and sex. I don't think that's a major theme in their art. It's more about religious and political themes.

Option G is landscapes and sceneries. Maybe, but I don't remember seeing a lot of landscape scenes. Their art tends to be more figurative, showing people and deities rather than backgrounds.

Option H is everyday household activities. Perhaps in some pottery or murals, but again, I think the focus was more on rituals and gods rather than daily life.

Option I is abstract geometric shapes. The Maya did have some geometric patterns, but I think their art is more known for its realistic and symbolic figures rather than purely abstract shapes.

So, putting it all together, the Mayan art I've seen often includes images of rulers, gods, and rituals, which sometimes involved violence. For example, the murals at Bonampak show battle scenes and sacrifices. Also, there's the practice of bloodletting, where elites would mutilate themselves to communicate with the gods. So option A, mutilation and violence, seems like a correct choice.
