Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this DC motor efficiency problem. Hmm, let's see. The question says the motor requires 10 kilowatts to supply its full capacity of 10 horsepower. And I need to find the full-load efficiency.

Wait, efficiency is usually the output power divided by the input power, right? So efficiency = output / input. But wait, I need to make sure the units match. Because the input is in kilowatts (which is a unit of power) and the output is given in horsepower. Oh right, I remember that 1 horsepower is equal to about 745.7 watts, or 0.7457 kilowatts.

So the motor's output is 10 horsepower. Let me convert that to kilowatts. 10 HP * 0.7457 kW/HP. Let me calculate that. 10 times 0.7457 is 7.457 kilowatts. So the output power is 7.457 kW.

The input power is given as 10 kW. So the efficiency is output divided by input. That would be 7.457 kW / 10 kW. Let me do that division. 7.457 divided by 10 is 0.7457. To convert that to a percentage, I multiply by 100, so that's 74.57%.

Looking at the options, option A is 74.6%, which looks really close. Option J is 78.2%, which is a bit higher. Hmm, did I do the conversion right? Let me double-check.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, efficiency can be expressed in terms of horsepower. Oh wait, no, because the input is in kilowatts. So the units must be consistent. So I definitely have to convert HP to kW.

Wait another thing, perhaps I should check the exact conversion factor. 1 HP is exactly 745.6998715822702 watts, which is approximately 745.7 W. So 10 HP is 10 * 745.7 = 7457 watts, which is 7.457 kW. So that's correct.

Then, efficiency is 7.457 / 10 = 0.7457, so 74.57%. The closest option is A: 74.6%. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up input and output.

Efficiency is output over input. The motor's input is the electrical power (10 kW), and the output is the mechanical power it delivers (10 HP converted to kW). So yeah, output is 7.457, input is 10. So 74.57%, option A.
</think>

To determine the full-load efficiency of the DC motor, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}} \times 100
\]

The input power is given as 10 kW. The output power is given as 10 horsepower, which needs to be converted to kilowatts. Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{HP} = 0.7457 \, \text{kW}\), the output power is:

\[
10 \, \text{HP} \times 0.7457 \, \text{kW/HP} = 7.457 \, \text{kW}
\]

Now, substitute the values into the efficiency formula:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{7.457 \, \text{kW}}{10 \, \text{kW}} \times 100 = 74.57\%
\]

The closest option to this value is **74.6%**, which corresponds to option A.
