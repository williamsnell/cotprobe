Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about photomicrography and resolving power. Hmm, I remember that the resolving power of a microscope is related to the wavelength of light and the numerical aperture. Let me think about the formula.

Oh right, the resolving limit, which is the smallest distance between two points that can still be seen as separate, is given by the formula d = λ/(2NA), where λ is the wavelength and NA is the numerical aperture. Wait, wait, no, I think I might be mixing something up. Or does it have a factor of 1.22? Because I remember something about diffraction limits and stuff.

Wait wait, no, the Rayleigh criterion uses 1.22λ/(2NA) for the resolving power. Or was it 0.61λ/(NA)? Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight.

The formula for the resolving limit (also called the diffraction limit) in microscopy is d = (λ) / (2 * NA), but wait, maybe that's for something else. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is d = 1.22 * λ / (2 * NA). No, wait, no, the 1.22 comes into play for telescopes and the Abbe limit for microscopes. Wait, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the Abbe limit for the resolving power of a microscope is given by d = λ/(2n sinθ), where n is the refractive index, and θ is the half-angle of the cone of light entering the lens. But the numerical aperture NA is defined as n sinθ. So substituting, d becomes λ/(2 NA). Oh, so the formula is d = λ/(2 NA). So that factor is 1/(2 NA), not multiplied by 1.22. So I don't need the 1.22 here. That 1.22 factor is for something else, maybe the airy disk in telescopes.

So the problem gives me the wavelength as 2750 Angstroms. Oh wait, because 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2750 A is 2750e-10 m, which is 2.75e-7 meters.

The numerical aperture is 0.85. So plugging into the formula: d = λ/(2 * NA) = (2.75e-7 m) / (2 * 0.85). Let's calculate that denominator: 2 * 0.85 is 1.7. So 2.75e-7 / 1.7.

Let me compute 2.75 / 1.7. Let's see, 1.7 times 1.6 is 2.72. So 2.75 / 1.7 ≈ 1.6176. So approximately 1.6176e-7 meters.

Looking at the options, which one is closest to 1.6176e-7 m? Let's see:

Option A: 2.50e-7 → too big.

Option B: 1.85e-7 → 1.85 is bigger than 1.6, so no.

Option C: 2.15e-7 → no.

Option D: 2.07e-7 → nope.

Option E: 2.30e-7 → no.

Option F: 1.90e-7 → no, higher than 1.6.

Option G: 1.97e-7 → nope.

Option H: 2.75e-7 → that's the wavelength, so maybe if I messed up the formula, but no, the calculation seems right.

Option I: 1.79e-7 → that's 1.79, which is a bit higher than 1.6176.

Option J: 1.65e-7 → that's 1.65, which is a bit lower than 1.6176? Wait, wait, 1.65 is bigger than 1.6176. Wait, 1.65 is 165e-8, and 1.6176 is about 161e-8. So 1.65 is a bit higher than the calculated value.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 1.6176e-7. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate 2.75e-7 divided by 1.7.

Wait, 2.75 / 1.7. Let's do that more accurately.

1.7 * 1.6 = 2.72 → 2.75 is 0.03 more than 2.72. So 0.03 / 1.7 = 0.017647. So 1.6 + 0.017647 ≈ 1.617647. So approximately 1.6176e-7 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option G? No, wait. Let me check all the options again.

Option A: 2.50e-7 → 2.5e-7 is bigger.

Option B: 1.85e-7 → 1.85e-7 is 1.85e-7, which is larger than 1.6176e-7.

Option I: 1.79e-7 → 1.79 is 0.17e-7 higher than 1.61.

Option G: 1.97e-7 → higher.

Option F: 1.90e-7 → 1.9 is higher.

Option H: 2.75e-7 → that's the wavelength.

Option D: 2.07e-7 → no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the formula is d = λ/(2 NA) or d = (λ/2)/NA? Wait no, the formula is d = λ/(2 NA). So that's correct.

Alternative approach: Maybe I have the formula wrong. Wait, what if the formula is d = (λ)/(2 NA) or (λ)/(NA)?

Wait, the Abbe limit formula is d = λ/(2 n sinθ), which is the same as λ/(2 NA), because NA = n sinθ. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, but looking at the options, there's no option exactly at 1.6176e-7. So which is the closest? Let me check all options.

Option G is 1.97e-7, which is higher.

Option I is 1.79e-7, which is 1.79e-7.

Wait, 1.79 is 0.17e-7 higher than 1.61, which is a difference of about 10% (0.17 /1.61 ~ 10.5%). But perhaps none match exactly, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute 2.75 / 1.7.

2.75 ÷ 1.7. Let's compute:

1.7 * 1 = 1.7 → 2.75-1.7=1.05.

Bring down a zero: 10.5 ÷ 1.7.

1.7 *6 =10.2 → 10.5-10.2=0.3.

Bring down a zero: 3.0 → 1.7*1=1.7 → 3-1.7=1.3.

Bring down a zero: 13 → 1.7 *7 = 11.9 → 13-11.9=1.1.

Bring down a zero: 11 → 1.7*6=10.2 → 11-10.2=0.8.

And so on. So 2.75 / 1.7 = 1.6176470588... So 1.6176e-7 meters.

Looking for the closest option, which is 1.6176e-7 m. The options are:

Looking again, option G is 1.97e-7 → no.

Option I is 1.79e-7 → 1.79 is 0.172e-7 higher, which is about a 10.6% difference.

Option F: 1.90e-7 → 0.28e-7 higher.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Wait, another thought: Oh wait, maybe I should have multiplied by something else. Oh no, wait, I think another formula exists where the resolution is λ/(4 NA) or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The Abbe limit is d = λ/(2 NA) when considering the limit of diffraction. So that's correct.

Wait, the problem states that it's photomicrography using quartz lenses. Does that affect anything? Well, quartz is used because it's transparent to UV light. But the formula remains the same as the Abbe limit equation. So no, that doesn't change the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. The wavelength is given as 2750 Angstroms. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2750 A = 2750e-10 m = 2.75e-7 m. So that's correct.

So the calculation is correct. But the options don't have exactly 1.6176e-7 m. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking carefully:

Option D: 2.07e-7 m → no.

Option G: 1.97e-7 → 1.97 is larger.

Option I: 1.79e-7 → 1.79 is 0.17 higher than 1.61.

Option F: 1.90e-7.

Option B: 1.85e-7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh! Wait, the formula might be d = (lambda) / (2 * NA) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm forgetting a factor of 2, or perhaps the factor is 1.22.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula used here is d = (lambda) / (NA), which would give 2.75e-7 / 0.85 = approximately 3.23e-7 m, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, if the formula is d = 0.61 lambda / (NA), which is another version I've heard before. Let's try that. 0.61 * 2.75e-7 / 0.85.

So 0.61 * 2.75e-7 = approx 1.6775e-7. Divided by 0.85: 1.6775e-7 / 0.85 ≈ 1.973e-7 m. That's approximately 1.97e-7 m. Looking at the options, option G is 1.97e-7. So that's a possible answer. But wait, when is that formula used?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. The 0.61 factor comes into play in the Rayleigh criterion for telescopes, where d = 1.22 lambda / (Diameter), or d = 0.61 lambda / (radius). But in microscopy, the formula is Abbe's limit, which is d = lambda/(2 NA). So perhaps in this case, the correct formula is the one without the 0.61 factor. But then, why am I getting an answer that's not among the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 0.5 instead of 0.61. Let me think. No, Abbe's formula is definitely d = lambda/(2 NA).

Wait, but perhaps the wavelength was in air, and when it enters the medium (like the quartz), the effective wavelength changes. Oh, wait, the wavelength inside the medium would be lambda_medium = lambda_vacuum / n, where n is the refractive index of the medium. But in the Abbe formula, the lambda is the wavelength in the medium. Wait, but if the light is propagating through a medium with refractive index n, then the effective wavelength is lambda/n.

Wait, in the Abbe limit, the formula is d = lambda/(2 n sin theta) = lambda/(2 NA). So the lambda used is the wavelength in vacuum, and NA is n sin theta, so the formula correctly uses lambda/(2 NA).

Wait, but if the medium is quartz, which has a refractive index higher than air, then the wavelength inside the quartz would be lambda_quartz = lambda_air / n. But the formula uses the wavelength in the medium (quartz), so the formula becomes d = (lambda_medium) / (2 NA), but since NA is n sin theta, which already accounts for the refractive index, perhaps I don't need to adjust the wavelength.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Abbe limit formula is d = lambda/(2 NA), where lambda is the wavelength in the medium. If the wavelength in vacuum is lambda_0, then lambda_medium is lambda_0 / n, where n is the refractive index of the medium (quartz, here). So substituting, d = (lambda_0)/(n * 2 NA). But wait, NA is n sin theta, so substituting NA:

d = (lambda_0) / (2 * n sin theta * n) ) → ?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = lambda/(2 NA), where lambda is the wavelength in the medium. So the correct approach is to take the wavelength in the medium. But the given wavelength is 2750 A in vacuum, I think. Because the problem states "ultraviolet light of wavelength 2750 A", which is presumably in air or vacuum.

So if the medium is quartz, which has a higher refractive index, then the wavelength inside would be lambda_medium = lambda_air / n_quartz.

Wait, but without knowing the refractive index of quartz at this wavelength, perhaps it's assumed that the wavelength given is the effective wavelength in the medium. Or perhaps the problem assumes that the wavelength remains the same, which is incorrect, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that you don't need to account for the refractive index of the medium beyond what's included in the NA. Because NA already includes the refractive index of the medium. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the answer is approximately 1.6176e-7 m, which isn't exactly an option. But looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate 2.75e-7 divided by 1.7.

Let me compute 2.75 / 1.7.

1.7 * 1.6 = 2.72, as I did before. 2.75 -2.72 = 0.03. So 0.03 /1.7 = 0.017647. So total is 1.617647e-7 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 1.79e-7, which is 1.79e-7, but that's 0.172e-7 higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = lambda/(NA), which would be 2.75e-7 / 0.85 ≈ 3.23e-7 m, which is option H: 2.75e-7 is 2.75e-7, but no, that's 3.23, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is d = (0.61 lambda) / (NA), which I thought was for telescopes. Let me try that.

0.61 * 2.75e-7 = 1.6775e-7. Divided by 0.85: 1.6775e-7 / 0.85 ≈ 1.973e-7 m. Which matches option G: 1.97e-7 m.

But wait, why would that be the case? Because in microscopy, the Abbe limit uses d = lambda/(2 NA), whereas in telescope resolution, it's 1.22 lambda / (D), which for a microscope's aperture would be something else.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of 0.61 lambda/(NA). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula the problem expects is d = lambda/(2 NA), which gives 1.6176e-7, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again: 2.75e-7 m is 0.275e-6 m. Divided by 1.7 (since 2*0.85=1.7):

0.275e-6 / 1.7 → let's compute 275e-9 /1.7.

275 ÷1.7 → same as before, 161.76e-9 → 1.6176e-7 m.

Looking again at the options, none exactly match. So perhaps the closest option is I: 1.79e-7, but that's 0.17e-7 higher than our result. Alternatively, perhaps the problem used lambda in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (lambda)/(4 NA). Let me try that: 2.75e-7 / (4 * 0.85) = 2.75e-7 / 3.4 ≈ 8.08e-8 m. But that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = lambda/(NA). So 2.75e-7 /0.85 ≈3.23e-7, which is option H:2.75e-7 is not 3.23e-7. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula d = (lambda)/(2 NA) * (1/√2) or something else. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial unit conversion.

Wait, the wavelength is 2750 Angstroms, which is 2750e-10 meters, which is 2.75e-7 m. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the division.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the division: 2.75e-7 /1.7.

Wait, 1.7 * 1.6 = 2.72 → 2.75 is 0.03 more than 2.72. So 0.03/1.7 is 0.017647. So 1.6 + 0.017647 = 1.617647.

So 1.617647e-7 m, which is approximately 1.618e-
