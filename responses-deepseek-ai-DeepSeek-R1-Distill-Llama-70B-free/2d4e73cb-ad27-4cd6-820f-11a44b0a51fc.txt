Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about two spheres: one nonconducting with a charge +Q, and the other a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. They're brought close to each other, and I have to determine what happens from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when a charged object is brought near a conductor, it induces charges on the conductor. But wait, the first sphere is nonconducting. Oh wait, no, the nonconducting sphere is charged, and the other is conducting. So let me think about how charges redistribute in this scenario.

So the nonconducting sphere has a net charge +Q. Since it's nonconducting, the charges can't move freely, right? So the charge stays put—it can't move around. Now, bringing this charged sphere close to the neutral conducting sphere must cause some induction.

When a charged object is near a conductor, the conductor's free charges redistribute. In this case, the conducting sphere is neutral initially. So the positive charges in the conductor would be repelled by the +Q charge on the nonconducting sphere. They would move to the far side of the conducting sphere, creating a negative charge on the near side. Wait, no—wait, the positive charges would move away. So the side of the conductor closest to the +Q sphere would have negative charges induced because the positive charges are moving to the opposite side.

So the conducting sphere will have an induced negative charge on the side near the nonconducting sphere and a positive charge on the opposite side. But since the conducting sphere is neutral overall, the total charge remains zero. So the induced charges are such that the negative is on one side and positive on the other, but they cancel each other out.

Now, the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge. The induced negative charges on the conducting sphere near it would attract the positive charges. So the two spheres would experience an electrostatic attraction. That makes sense because opposite charges attract.

Looking at the options, option B says the spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction. Option J says repulsion. So I can eliminate J because like charges would repel, but here it's opposite charges.

What about the other options? Option A: Electric field induced within the conducting sphere. Well, in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside is zero. Oh wait, but this is a static situation. So when the conducting sphere is placed near the charged nonconducting sphere, the conductor's interior would have an electric field due to the external charge. Or wait, no—wait, in the conducting material, the charges rearrange to cancel any internal fields. But the external field would induce charges on the conductor's surface. So inside the conducting sphere's material, the field is zero. But the field within the sphere as a whole? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the conducting sphere is neutral, so the field inside (like in the center) would depend on external charges. But the conducting material itself would have zero field. Not sure about option A yet.

Option B seems correct. So about the force, yes, it's attraction. 

Option C says the nonconducting sphere loses all its charge. No, because it's nonconducting, charges can't move. So the charge stays on it.

Option D: No electrostatic force. No, because there's an attraction, so D is wrong.

Option E: Force but not significant. I don't think so; the force should be significant if they are close. But I'm not certain, but the presence is more important than the magnitude. So B is better.

Option F: Conducting sphere gets +Q. No, because it's neutral and inducing charges. The net charge on the conductor remains zero. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Conducting sphere remains neutral. Well, yes, because it's induced charges are equal and opposite. So the net charge is still zero. So G is correct in that sense, but the question is about what will be true.

Option H: Conducting sphere has –Q. No, because net charge is zero. So H is wrong.

Option I: Electric field within nonconducting sphere. The nonconducting sphere has its own charge, so there's an electric field inside it, yes. But wait, nonconductors can have charges, but the field inside depends on the charge distribution. Since it's a sphere, the field inside a uniformly charged nonconducting sphere would behave in a certain way. But wait, the nonconducting sphere's charge is fixed. So option I says an electric field is induced within the nonconducting sphere. Hmm, but if the nonconducting sphere has a charge, there's already an electric field inside. The presence of the conducting sphere might cause some redistribution, but since it's nonconducting, the charges can't move. So the field inside the nonconducting sphere is already present. So I think option I is correct, but wait, the question is about what's induced. Oh wait, the nonconducting sphere's own charge creates the field, but the conducting sphere induces a field in it? Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the nonconducting sphere's charges are fixed. So when the conducting sphere induces charges, does that cause any change in the nonconducting sphere's charge distribution? Since it's nonconducting, the charges can't move much. So the field inside the nonconducting sphere is due to its own charge. So option I is correct? Because the nonconducting sphere has a charge, so it has an internal field. But was that field induced by the conducting sphere? Or was it already present.

Wait, the problem says the nonconducting sphere is given a charge and then brought near. So the field within it is due to its own charge, not induced by the conducting sphere. So option I might not be correct, because the field isn't induced by the conducting sphere. It's already there.

So perhaps option A is about the conducting sphere. The conducting sphere's interior (as a material) would have zero field, but if considering the entire sphere, there's an external field. Or perhaps, with the induced charges, there's an internal field within the conducting material?

Wait, no. In a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conducting material is zero. But the field inside the sphere (the space), like in the cavity, if any, would have fields. But in this case, the conducting sphere is solid, I suppose. So the conducting sphere's material has zero electric field. So option A says an electric field is induced within the conducting sphere. That's referring to the material. So the field is zero. So option A is incorrect.

So going back, option B is correct. The spheres attract each other.

So the correct answer should be option B.

When a nonconducting sphere with a net charge \( +Q \) is brought near a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius, the following occurs:

1. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**: The charged nonconducting sphere induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. The side of the conducting sphere closer to the \( +Q \) charge will develop a negative charge due to the repulsion of positive charges, while the opposite side will develop a positive charge. However, since the conducting sphere is initially neutral, the total charge remains zero.

2. **Electrostatic Force**: The induced negative charge on the conducting sphere near the \( +Q \) charge results in an attractive force between the two spheres. This is consistent with the principle that opposite charges attract.

3. **Charge on the Nonconducting Sphere**: The nonconducting sphere retains its charge \( +Q \) because it is nonconducting, and its charges cannot move or be transferred.

4. **Electric Field Within the Conducting Sphere**: In a conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field within the conducting material is zero. The induced charges on the surface of the conducting sphere ensure this condition.

5. **Electric Field Within the Nonconducting Sphere**: The nonconducting sphere has its own charge \( +Q \), which creates an electric field within it. However, this field is not induced by the conducting sphere; it is already present due to the nonconducting sphere's charge.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The electric field within the conducting sphere's material is zero at electrostatic equilibrium.
- **B**: Correct. The spheres experience an electrostatic attraction due to the induced charges on the conducting sphere.
- **C**: Incorrect. The nonconducting sphere does not lose its charge because it is nonconducting.
- **D**: Incorrect. The spheres do experience an electrostatic force.
- **E**: Incorrect. The electrostatic force is significant when the spheres are close.
- **F**: Incorrect. The conducting sphere remains neutral overall.
- **G**: Incorrect. While the conducting sphere remains neutral overall, this does not fully describe the situation.
- **H**: Incorrect. The conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of \( -Q \); it remains neutral.
- **I**: Incorrect. The electric field within the nonconducting sphere is not induced by the conducting sphere; it is due to the nonconducting sphere's own charge.
- **J**: Incorrect. The spheres experience attraction, not repulsion.

### Final Answer:
B
