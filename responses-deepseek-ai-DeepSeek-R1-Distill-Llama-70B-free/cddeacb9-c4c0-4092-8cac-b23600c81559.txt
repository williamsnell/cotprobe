Question:

A vehicle operator was driving on a highway at night. His girlfriend was in the passenger seat. They were returning from a college night class. She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by "smoking weed" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?

Options:

A: No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.
B: Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.
C: No, because the driver has the right to file a counterclaim and it should be considered by the court.
D: No, because the passenger was aware of the driver's state and should have taken steps to prevent the accident.
E: No, because the passenger was acting irresponsibly and put both herself and the driver at risk.
F: Yes, because the law does not recognize the effects of secondhand marijuana smoke as a valid cause of accidents.
G: No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me break it down step by step.

The situation is about a car accident where the driver fell asleep at the wheel, causing the car to crash. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. The passenger is suing the driver for negligence. Then, the driver countersues the passenger, claiming she was negligent by smoking marijuana, which he says caused him to fall asleep.

Hmm, I need to determine whether the court would grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the driver's counterclaim. So, the question is about whether the counterclaim has legal merit.

First, I should recall what negligence means. Negligence typically involves four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. The driver is arguing that the passenger's actions (smoking marijuana and blowing it out the window) caused him to fall asleep, leading to the accident.

Wait, but did the passenger's actions directly cause the driver's drowsiness? I'm not sure. I mean, if the passenger was smoking, maybe the driver inhaled some secondhand smoke. But how much would that affect him? I don't know if secondhand marijuana smoke is enough to make someone fall asleep, especially if the window was open. Maybe it's more about the driver's own actions.

Also, the passenger wasn't sharing the marijuana with the driver, so the driver wasn't using it. So, the driver's falling asleep might not be directly because of the secondhand smoke. Maybe there's another reason, like he was tired from the night class.

So, the driver is claiming the passenger was negligent. But for negligence, the passenger's action must have been the proximate cause of the accident. If the driver can't prove that the secondhand smoke caused his drowsiness, then the claim might fail.

Looking at the options, option B says the passenger wasn't part of a joint enterprise and didn't contribute enough. That sounds possible because there's no indication they were jointly doing something risky together, like both driving or something. The passenger's smoking might not be a direct cause.

Option F suggests that the law doesn't recognize secondhand marijuana smoke as a valid cause. I don't know if that's a legal precedent, but it's possible courts might not find that connection without evidence.

Option A says the passenger was negligent per se because she was breaking the law. Well, smoking marijuana might be illegal depending on the state, but if it's legal, then she's not necessarily negligent per se. Also, even if it's illegal, the act of smoking in the car might not directly cause the accident unless it's a contributing factor.

Option G talks about joint enterprise. Joint enterprise is when both parties are working together on an activity, and each can be liable for the other's negligence. But here, they were just passenger and driver. Unless they were doing something together that's risky, like street racing, which they aren't, so joint enterprise might not apply.

So, putting it together: the driver's counterclaim is based on the idea that the passenger's smoking caused him to fall asleep. But without evidence that the smoke actually affected him enough to fall asleep, especially with the window open, this might not hold. The court might find that the passenger's actions weren't a direct cause, so the counterclaim gets dismissed.

Therefore, the passenger's motion to dismiss would likely be granted because the passenger's actions didn't actively contribute to the accident in a legally recognizable way.

The court is likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim. The driver's argument hinges on the claim that the passenger's smoking of marijuana caused him to fall asleep. However, for negligence to be established, there must be a clear causal link between the passenger's actions and the accident. The passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise, and there is no strong evidence that secondhand marijuana smoke, especially with the window open, directly caused the driver's drowsiness. Without a direct and proximate cause, the passenger's actions do not meet the legal standard for negligence in this context.
