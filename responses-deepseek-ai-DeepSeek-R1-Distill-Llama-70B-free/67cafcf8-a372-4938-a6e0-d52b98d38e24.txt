Question:

Explain the 'END OF FILE Condition' method of ending a Explain the 'END OF FILE Condition' method of ending a programin PL/I.

Options:

A: The end-file condition occurs when a special end-of-file character is encountered within the file's data.
B: The end-file condition occurs when the file is not found
C: The end-file condition occurs when the operating system signals the end of a file due to a timeout.
D: The end-file condition occurs when the file is manually closed by the user during the execution of the program.
E: The end-file condition occurs when an attempt is made to acquire data from the input file after the last data from the file has already been read.
F: The end-file condition occurs when the file reaches a certain size limit during data writing.
G: The end-file condition occurs when the file is corrupted
H: The end-file condition occurs when the file's read permission is revoked while the program is running.
I: The end-file condition is triggered by a specific keyword written into the file.

Alright, so I need to figure out the correct answer for this PL/I question about the 'END OF FILE Condition' method. Okay, let me start by recalling what I know about PL/I and file handling.

I remember that in programming, especially when dealing with files, there's a concept called end-of-file, which indicates that there's no more data left to read in a file. So the question is specifically about how this condition is determined in PL/I.

Looking at the options, I need to understand each one. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's when a special end-of-file character is encountered. Hmm, I think some systems might use a specific character to mark the end, like EOF in some contexts. But wait, I'm not sure if PL/I uses a specific character or relies on the operating system's signal.

Option B is when the file isn't found. That doesn't sound right. If the file isn't found, I think that would trigger a different error, maybe a file not found exception, not an end-of-file condition.

Option C mentions a timeout. I haven't heard of PL/I ending a file because of a timeout. That sounds more like a network issue or something else, not a normal end of file scenario.

Option D says the file is manually closed by the user during execution. That doesn't seem right either. If the user closes the file, the program might crash or throw an error, but it's not the normal end-of-file condition.

Option E states it's when trying to read after the last data. That makes sense because once you've read all the data, any further read attempts would hit the end. So PL/I probably triggers an end-of-file condition here.

Option F talks about a file size limit. I don't think hitting a size limit during writing would cause an end-of-file condition. That's more about file system limits or writing errors.

Option G is about a corrupted file. If a file is corrupted, the program might not read it correctly, but that's not the same as a normal end-of-file. It would probably cause a different kind of error.

Option H mentions read permission being revoked. If permissions change while running, that's a security issue and would likely cause an access denied error, not an end-of-file.

Option I suggests a specific keyword in the file. I don't recall PL/I looking for a keyword to end the file. It's more about the operating system signaling the end.

So, putting it all together, the end-of-file condition happens when the program tries to read past the last piece of data in the file. The operating system signals that there's no more data, which would trigger this condition. That aligns with option E.

The end-of-file condition in PL/I occurs when an attempt is made to read data from a file after all the data has already been read. This happens when the program tries to access data beyond the last available data in the file, and the operating system signals that there is no more data to read. This is accurately described by option E.
