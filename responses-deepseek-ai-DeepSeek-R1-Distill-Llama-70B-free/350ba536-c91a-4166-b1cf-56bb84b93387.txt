Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve. Hmm, I need to find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) at 1000 K for the reaction CO(g) + H₂O(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂(g). The given ΔH at 298 K is -10 kcal. Oh right, the question gives me the heat capacities for each substance, so I think I need to use those to calculate the change in ΔH with temperature.

Wait, I remember that the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) is used in calculations involving enthalpy changes with temperature. The formula I think I need is the Kirchhoff's law equation, which relates the change in ΔH with temperature. The equation might look something like ΔH2 = ΔH1 + ∫(ΔCp) dT from T1 to T2. Oh wait, right, it's ΔH = ΔH° + ∫(ΔCp) dT from T_initial to T_final.

So first, I should calculate ΔCp for the reaction. ΔCp is the sum of Cp of the products minus the sum of Cp of the reactants. Let's list out the Cp expressions:

CO: 6.60 + 0.001*T
H2O: 7.30 + 0.002*T
CO2:7.30 + 0.003*T
H2:6.60 + 0.001*T

Wait, the reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. So the reactants are CO and H2O, products are CO2 and H2. So ΔCp = [Cp(CO2) + Cp(H2)] - [Cp(CO) + Cp(H2O)].

Let me plug in the expressions:

ΔCp = [ (7.30 + 0.003T) + (6.60 + 0.001T) ] - [ (6.60 + 0.001T) + (7.30 + 0.002T) ]

Simplify each part:

Products: 7.30 + 6.60 = 13.90; 0.003T + 0.001T = 0.004T. So products sum to 13.90 + 0.004T.

Reactants: 6.60 +7.30 =13.90; 0.001T + 0.002T =0.003T. So reactants sum to 13.90 + 0.003T.

So ΔCp = (13.90 +0.004T) - (13.90 +0.003T) = (0.004T -0.003T) = 0.001T.

Oh, so ΔCp is 0.001*T. That's a small positive value. So the integral of ΔCp from T1 to T2 will be the change in enthalpy.

Wait, wait a second. So the formula is ΔH = ΔH° + ∫(ΔCp) dT from T_initial to T_final. Since ΔCp is positive, as temperature increases, the ΔH will increase. But wait, the original ΔH was negative (-10 kcal), so if ΔCp is positive, increasing T will make ΔH more positive or less negative?

Wait, let's think carefully. The equation is:

ΔH(T2) = ΔH° + ∫(from T1 to T2) ΔCp dT.

But wait, I'm not sure if the formula is correct. Oh right, the correct formula is:

ΔH(T2) = ΔH(T1) + ∫(T1 to T2) ΔCp(T) dT.

Yes, that's right. So here, T1 is 298 K, T2 is 1000 K. So I need to calculate the integral of ΔCp from 298 to 1000.

Since ΔCp is 0.001*T, the integral is ∫0.001*T dT from 298 to 1000.

The integral of T is (1/2)T². So ∫0.001*T dT = 0.001 * ( (T2² - T1²)/2 ).

Let me compute that.

First, T1 = 298 K, T2 = 1000 K.

T1 squared: 298^2 = let's calculate. 300^2 is 90,000. 298 is 2 less, so (300-2)^2 = 90000 - 2*300*2 +4= 90000 - 1200 +4= 88804.

Similarly, T2^2 is 1,000,000.

So T2^2 - T1^2 = 1,000,000 - 88,804 = 911,196.

Multiply by 0.001/2: 0.0005 * 911,196.

Calculating that:

0.0005 *911,196 = 455.598.

Wait, because 911,196 * 0.0005 = 911,196 * 5e-4 = (5 * 911196) / 10000.

Wait 5 * 911,196 = 4,555,980. Divide by 10,000 gives 455.598.

So the integral is 455.598. But wait, the units? Since Cp is in kcal/(mol·K), the integral would be in kcal/mol.

Wait, wait, the problem says the heat capacities are given, but it's not clear if they are molar heat capacities. Oh, but in the context of the reaction, it's the molar heat capacities.

So the integral is 455.598 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait—what about the sign? Because ΔCp is positive, the integral from T1 to T2 (which is an increase) adds a positive value to ΔH. So the overall ΔH will be -10 kcal + 455.598 kcal? That can't be right. Wait that would make ΔH positive, but wait, the options are all negative. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Because 455 kcal is way too large compared to the initial ΔH of -10 kcal. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ΔCp calculation. Let me recheck.

ΔCp = [CO2 + H2] - [CO + H2O].

CO2: 7.3 +0.003T.

H2:6.6 +0.001T.

CO:6.6 +0.001T.

H2O:7.3 +0.002T.

So products sum: 7.3 +6.6 =13.9; 0.003T +0.001T=0.004T. So 13.9 +0.004T.

Reactants sum:6.6 +7.3=13.9; 0.001T +0.002T=0.003T. So 13.9 +0.003T.

ΔCp = (13.9 +0.004T) - (13.9 +0.003T) = (0.004T -0.003T)=0.001T. So yes, correct.

So the integral is 0.001 * ∫T dT from 298 to 1000.

Wait, ∫T dT is 0.5*(T2² - T1²) = 0.5*(1e6 - 88804) = 0.5*(911196) = 455598. Multiply by 0.001: 455.598.

But that's a lot. So adding this to the initial ΔH, which is -10 kcal, gives us -10 + 455.598 = 445.598 kcal. But all the options are negative. So this suggests I did something wrong.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the reaction is exothermic at 298 K, and if ΔCp is positive, then as T increases, the enthalpy change becomes less exothermic. Because ΔH = q_p at constant pressure, so if ΔCp is positive, higher T makes the reaction less exothermic.

Wait, but if the initial ΔH is negative and the integral is positive, then adding them would make the new ΔH less negative. So, for example, if the initial was -10 and the integral is +X, then ΔH at T2 is (-10 + X). So if X is positive, it becomes less negative.

Wait, but in my calculation X is 455 kcal, which is way too big. That would make ΔH = 445 kcal, which is positive, way beyond any options given. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Because the heat capacities are given in terms of T, but perhaps they're per mole and the problem is in kcal. Alternatively, perhaps the Cp values are in cal/(mol·K), not kcal. Because if the Cp were in cal/(mol·K), then the integral would be in cal/mol, which would convert to 455.598 cal, which is 0.455598 kcal. That would make more sense.

Wait the problem states the ΔH is in kcal, and the options are in kcal. So I think the Cp must be in cal/(mol·K). Because if they were in kcal/(mol·K), then the change would be huge. So perhaps I need to convert from cal to kcal.

So let's reevaluate.

The ΔCp is 0.001*T cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but the problem states the Cp in terms like 6.60 +1.0e-3 T, but doesn't specify units. But given that the ΔH is in kcal, perhaps the Cp are in cal/(mol·K).

Wait, that makes sense because 1 cal is much smaller than 1 kcal. So let's proceed under that assumption.

So ΔCp is 0.001*T cal/(mol·K).

So the integral from 298 to 1000 K is:

∫ (0.001 T) dT from 298 to 1000.

Which is 0.001 * [0.5*(T2^2 - T1^2)] = 0.0005*(T2² - T1²).

Calculating T2²=1e6, T1²=88804.

So T2² - T1² = 1e6 -88804 = 911,196.

Multiply by 0.0005: 911,196 *0.0005 = 455.598 cal/mol.

Convert to kcal: 455.598 cal = 0.455598 kcal.

So the change in ΔH is +0.455598 kcal.

So the new ΔH is ΔH° + (0.455598) = (-10) + 0.4556 ≈ -9.544 kcal.

Looking at the options, option I is -9.54 kcal, which is very close. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the integration. Because I might have missed a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, the reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

The Cp for products: CO2 and H2.

The Cp for reactants: CO and H2O.

So ΔCp = (CO2 + H2) - (CO + H2O).

Which we calculated as 0.001*T.

So the integral is positive, meaning that as T increases, the enthalpy change becomes more positive (less negative). So the initial ΔH is -10 kcal, and adding the positive 0.4556 gives -9.544, which matches option I: -9.54 kcal.

To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) at 1000 K for the reaction:

**CO(g) + H₂O(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂(g)**  

given that ΔH at 298 K is -10 kcal, we use Kirchhoff's law:

\[
\Delta H(T_2) = \Delta H(T_1) + \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \Delta C_p \, dT
\]

### Step 1: Calculate ΔCp
The heat capacities are given as:
- \( C_p(\text{CO}) = 6.60 + 0.001T \)
- \( C_p(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = 7.30 + 0.002T \)
- \( C_p(\text{CO}_2) = 7.30 + 0.003T \)
- \( C_p(\text{H}_2) = 6.60 + 0.001T \)

For the reaction, \( \Delta C_p \) is:

\[
\Delta C_p = [C_p(\text{CO}_2) + C_p(\text{H}_2)] - [C_p(\text{CO}) + C_p(\text{H}_2\text{O})]
\]

Substituting the expressions:

\[
\Delta C_p = [(7.30 + 0.003T) + (6.60 + 0.001T)] - [(6.60 + 0.001T) + (7.30 + 0.002T)]
\]

Simplify:

\[
\Delta C_p = (13.90 + 0.004T) - (13.90 + 0.003T) = 0.001T
\]

Thus, \( \Delta C_p = 0.001T \).

---

### Step 2: Integrate ΔCp
The integral of \( \Delta C_p \) from \( T_1 = 298 \, \text{K} \) to \( T_2 = 1000 \, \text{K} \) is:

\[
\int_{298}^{1000} \Delta C_p \, dT = \int_{298}^{1000} 0.001T \, dT
\]

The integral of \( T \) is:

\[
\int T \, dT = \frac{1}{2}T^2
\]

Thus:

\[
\int_{298}^{1000} 0.001T \, dT = 0.001 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left[T_2^2 - T_1^2\right]
\]

Calculate \( T_1^2 \) and \( T_2^2 \):
- \( T_1^2 = 298^2 = 88804 \)
- \( T_2^2 = 1000^2 = 1,000,000 \)

\[
T_2^2 - T_1^2 = 1,000,000 - 88804 = 911,196
\]

\[
\int_{298}^{1000} 0.001T \, dT = 0.001 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 911,196 = 0.455598 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate ΔH at 1000 K
The change in enthalpy is:

\[
\Delta H(1000) = \Delta H(298) + \int_{298}^{1000} \Delta C_p \, dT
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta H(1000) = -10 + 0.455598 = -9.544 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

---

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated value of \( -9.544 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) is **-9.54 kcal**, which corresponds to option **I**.
