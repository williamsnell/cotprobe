Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a nanostructure modeled by an electron confined in a rectangular region. Hmm, I remember that when particles are confined in quantum systems, their energy levels become quantized. The problem is asking about the temperature at which thermal energy (kT) is comparable to the zero-point energy. Zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical system may have, right?

So I think the zero-point energy is the ground state energy. For a particle in a 2D box, the energy levels are given by something like E_n1_n2 = (n1²/L1² + n2²/L2²) multiplied by some constants. Oh wait, the exact formula is E = (n1² h1² + n2² h2²) / (8m), where h1 and h2 are related to the lengths of the sides, right? Or wait, maybe it's (h²/(8m)) multiplied by (n1²/L1² + n2²/L2²). Yeah, that sounds familiar.

Since we're talking about the zero-point energy, that's the ground state, so n1 and n2 are both 1. So E_11 would be (h²/(8m)) * (1/L1² + 1/L2²). But wait, the problem mentions that the thermal energy is comparable to this. So we need to set kT approximately equal to E_11.

Wait, but wait—what's the formula again? Let me think. The energy levels for a 2D box are E = (h²/(8m)) * [(n1²)/(L1²) + (n2²)/(L2²)]. So in the ground state, both n1 and n2 are 1. So E_zero_point = (h²/(8m)) [1/L1² + 1/L2²].

Now, the thermal energy is kT, and we're to find T such that kT ≈ E_zero_point.

So solving for T: T = E_zero_point / k.

I need to compute E_zero_point first. Let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, I need the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The mass m of the electron is about 9.109 x 10^-31 kg. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K.

Given L1 is 1.0 nm, which is 1e-9 meters. L2 is 2.0 nm, which is 2e-9 meters.

So plugging into E_zero_point:

E = (h²/(8m)) * [1/(1e-9)^2 + 1/(2e-9)^2] 

Wait, wait, no. Because L1 is 1 nm, L2 is 2 nm. So the terms are 1/(L1²) and 1/(L2²), so 1/(1e-9)^2 and 1/(2e-9)^2.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute h squared: h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ (6.626)^2 x 1e-68. 6.626 squared is approximately 43.9. So h² ≈ 43.9e-68 (J²·s²).

Now, denominator 8m: 8 * 9.109e-31 kg = 7.287e-30 kg.

So h²/(8m) = (43.9e-68) / (7.287e-30) ≈ (approx 43.9 / 7.287) * 1e-38. 43.9/7.287 is about 6.025. So h²/(8m) ≈6.025e-38 J·m².

Wait, because the units: h²/(8m) has units of (J² s²)/(kg) )? Wait, no, let's think. h has units J·s, so h² is J² s². 8m has units kg. So h²/(8m) has units J² s²/kg. Hmm, but maybe I should think in terms of J·m², because when multiplied by (1/m²) [from 1/L² terms], you get J.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it numerically without worrying about units for now.

So h²/(8m) ≈ 6.025e-38 J·m².

Now, the term in brackets: [1/(1e-9)^2 + 1/(2e-9)^2 ].

Calculate each term:

1/(1e-9)^2 = 1/(1e-18) = 1e18 m^-2.

1/(2e-9)^2 = 1/(4e-18) = 0.25e18 = 2.5e17 m^-2.

So the sum is 1e18 + 2.5e17 = 1.25e18 m^-2.

So E_zero_point = (6.025e-38 J·m²) * (1.25e18 m^-2) = 6.025e-38 * 1.25e18.

Multiplying 6.025 * 1.25 gives about 7.53125. And 1e-38 * 1e18 is 1e-20. So E_zero_point ≈ 7.53e-20 J.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation:

6.025e-38 *1.25e18 = (6.025 *1.25) * 1e(-38+18) )= 7.53125e-20 J.

Yes, correct.

Now, kT should be equal to this energy. So kT ≈7.53e-20 J.

Solving for T: T = (7.53e-20 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (7.53 /1.38) * 1e3 K.

7.53 / 1.38 is approximately 5.46. So T ≈5.46e3 K.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option J is 3.0e3 K.

Option C: 2.5e3 K.

Option I: 8e3.

Wait, my calculation gives about 5.46e3. Let me see the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A: 2e2 K

B:5.5e3 K

C:2.5e3 K

D:7e3 K

E:1.2e4 K

F:6.5e3 K

G:9.5e3 K

H:1.5e4 K

I:8e3 K

J:3e3 K.

So 5.46e3 is closest to option B (5.5e3) or F (6.5e3). Hmm. Let me check my calculation again to see if I made any errors.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of h^2/(8m).

Let me recompute h²/(8m).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = let's compute that.

6.626^2 = approx 43.9, so 43.9e-68.

8m: 8 * 9.109e-31 kg = 72.87e-31 kg = 7.287e-30 kg.

So h²/(8m) = 43.9e-68 / 7.287e-30.

43.9 /7.287 is approximately 6.025.

So 6.025e-38 (since 1e-68 / 1e-30 = 1e-38).

Yes, so that part was correct.

Then 1/L1² =1/(1e-9)^2 = 1e18 m^-2.

1/L2² =1/(2e-9)^2 = 1/(4e-18) = 0.25e18 =2.5e17 m^-2.

Sum: 1e18 + 0.25e18 = 1.25e18 m^-2.

So E_zero_point =6.025e-38 *1.25e18 = (6.025 *1.25)*1e-20 =7.53125e-20 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So T= (7.53e-20) / (1.38e-23) = (7.53/1.38) * 1e3.

7.53/1.38 is approximately 5.46, so 5.46e3 K.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.5e3 K, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the units and calculations once more to be sure.

Wait, when I calculate h²/(8m), the units are (J² s²)/(kg). Wait, J is kg m²/s², so J² s² is kg² m^4 / s². Dividing by kg gives kg m^4 / s². Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, the term (h²/(8m)) * (1/L^2) would have units of (J s^2/kg) * (1/m² * m²) since L is in meters. Wait, perhaps it's better to rely on the numerical calculation since the units are consistent.

Another point: for a 2D box, the ground state energy is E = (h^2/(8m)) [ (n1²/L1²) + (n2²/L2²) ). So for n1=1, n2=1, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes I've seen the formula written in terms of pi, but I think that's when the potential is infinite and the wavefunction nodes are at the boundaries. So I think the approach is correct.

So to recap: E_zero_point ≈7.53e-20 J.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

T ≈7.53e-20 / 1.38e-23 = approx (7.53 /1.38) * 1e3 ≈5.46e3.

So closest option is B:5.5e3 K.

To determine the temperature at which the thermal energy \( kT \) is comparable to the zero-point energy of an electron confined in a 2D rectangular box, we start by calculating the zero-point energy. For a particle in a 2D box, the energy levels are given by:

\[
E = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{n_1^2}{L_1^2} + \frac{n_2^2}{L_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the electron, \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are the lengths of the sides of the box, and \( n_1, n_2 \) are quantum numbers. For the ground state (\( n_1 = n_2 = 1 \)), the zero-point energy is:

\[
E_{\text{zero-point}} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{1}{L_1^2} + \frac{1}{L_2^2} \right).
\]

### Step 1: Constants and Parameters
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( L_1 = 1.0 \, \text{nm} = 1.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( L_2 = 2.0 \, \text{nm} = 2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( \frac{h^2}{8m} \)
\[
h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2,
\]
\[
8m = 8 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} = 7.287 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg}.
\]
\[
\frac{h^2}{8m} = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{7.287 \times 10^{-30}} = 6.025 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{J·m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \frac{1}{L_1^2} + \frac{1}{L_2^2} \)
\[
\frac{1}{L_1^2} = \frac{1}{(1.0 \times 10^{-9})^2} = 1.0 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{L_2^2} = \frac{1}{(2.0 \times 10^{-9})^2} = 2.5 \times 10^{17} \, \text{m}^{-2}.
\]
\[
\frac{1}{L_1^2} + \frac{1}{L_2^2} = 1.0 \times 10^{18} + 2.5 \times 10^{17} = 1.25 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Zero-Point Energy
\[
E_{\text{zero-point}} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{1}{L_1^2} + \frac{1}{L_2^2} \right) = (6.025 \times 10^{-38}) \times (1.25 \times 10^{18}) = 7.53 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 5: Relate Thermal Energy to Temperature
The thermal energy is \( kT \), and we set \( kT \approx E_{\text{zero-point}} \). Solving for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{E_{\text{zero-point}}}{k} = \frac{7.53 \times 10^{-20}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 5.46 \times 10^3 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with Options
The closest option to \( T = 5.46 \times 10^3 \, \text{K} \) is **B: \( 5.5 \times 10^3 \, \text{K} \)**.
