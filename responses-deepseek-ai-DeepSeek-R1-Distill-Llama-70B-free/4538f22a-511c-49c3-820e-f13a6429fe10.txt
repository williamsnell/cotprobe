Okay, so I have this question about bootstrapping versus pure simulation, and I need to figure out under which situations bootstrapping is preferred. Hmm, I remember that bootstrapping is a resampling method used in statistics. Let me think.

The question lists four situations, i to iv. The options are combinations of these. I need to determine in which cases bootstrapping is better than pure simulation.

Bootstrapping, as far as I recall, involves creating multiple samples by drawing with replacement from the original sample. It's used when you want to estimate the distribution of a statistic without knowing the underlying distribution of the data. So it's particularly useful when the data's distribution is unknown or when you don't have a lot of data.

Looking at the options:

i) If the distributional properties are the same as actual data. Wait, bootstrapping uses the empirical distribution of the sample, so it's good when you want your experiments to have the same distribution as the actual data. Because pure simulation might assume a theoretical distribution, like normal or something. So for i), bootstrapping would be preferred because it maintains the data's actual distribution.

ii) If the distributional properties are known exactly. Hmm, if we know the distribution exactly, why not use pure simulation? Because then you can just simulate from that known distribution. Bootstrapping is more useful when you don't know the distribution. So for ii), pure simulation might be better, so bootstrapping isn't preferred here. So situations where ii) is true would not prefer bootstrapping.

iii) If the distributional properties are unknown. Oh yeah, that's when bootstrapping shines. Because you can't simulate from an unknown distribution, so bootstrapping uses the data itself to estimate the distribution. So iii) is a case where bootstrapping is preferred.

iv) If the sample of actual data is very small. Oh right, when your sample size is small, you might not have enough data to do meaningful simulations otherwise. Bootstrapping can help because it resamples from the existing data, allowing you to generate many samples even if the original is small. So iv) is another situation where bootstrapping is preferred.

So putting it together: which situations prefer bootstrapping?

i) Yes.

ii) No, because pure simulation is better when you know the distribution.

iii) Yes.

iv) Yes.

So the correct situations are i, iii, and iv.

Looking at the options:

Options are combinations:

A: i and ii → No, because ii is excluded.

B: ii and iii → No.

C: i and iii → No, because iv is also included.

D: i and iv → No, misses iii.

E: ii and iv → No.

F: iii and iv → Yes, but wait, what about i?

Wait, I thought i is also correct. So the correct situations are i, iii, iv. Now, looking at the options.

Looking at all options, option H is (i), (iii), (iv) only. Option H is labeled as H: (i), (iii), and (iv) only.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is, under which situations would bootstrapping be preferred over pure simulation.

So when the data's distribution is same as actual (i), or when it's unknown (iii), or the sample is small (iv), bootstrapping is better. So the correct answer should include i, iii, iv.

Looking through the options, option H is the one that includes i, iii, iv. So the answer must be H.

Bootstrapping is a resampling method that is particularly useful in situations where the underlying distribution of the data is unknown or when the sample size is small. It is preferred over pure simulation in the following cases:

1. **Situation (i):** When the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are the same as those of actual data. Bootstrapping is ideal here because it uses the empirical distribution of the sample, preserving the actual data's distributional properties.

2. **Situation (iii):** When the distributional properties of the actual data are unknown. Bootstrapping is advantageous because it does not require knowledge of the underlying distribution, instead relying on the data itself to estimate the distribution.

3. **Situation (iv):** When the sample of actual data available is very small. Bootstrapping is preferred in this scenario because it allows for the generation of many samples through resampling, even with limited data.

Situation (ii), where the distributional properties are known exactly, does not favor bootstrapping because pure simulation can directly use the known distribution.

Thus, bootstrapping is preferred in situations (i), (iii), and (iv). The correct answer is:

H: (i), (iii), and (iv) only.
