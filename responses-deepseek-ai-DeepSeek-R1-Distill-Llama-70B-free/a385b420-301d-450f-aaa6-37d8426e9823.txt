Question:

Explain the types and effects of competition.

Options:

A: Competition is the active demand of two or more organisms for a common vital resource. It can be categorized into Contest competition and Scramble competition.
B: Competition is a cooperative interaction where organisms work together to maximize resource use.
C: Competition only involves physical confrontation.
D: Competition is solely determined by the availability of water resources.
E: Competition is an interaction that only occurs within a species, known as Intraspecific competition.
F: Competition can be categorized into Predation competition and Mutualism competition.
G: Competition is a natural process that always results in the extinction of one species.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about competition in biology. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about competition.

Competition, as I remember, is when organisms compete for resources. It's not just about fighting; it's more about the resources they need to survive. So the first thing I should think about is the types of competition. I think there are two main types: contest competition and scramble competition. Contest competition is where organisms directly compete, maybe through fights or other direct interactions. Scramble competition is more about who can get the resource first, without direct confrontation. So that might match option A, which says competition is the active demand for a common vital resource and is categorized into contest and scramble. 

Looking at the other options. Option B says competition is cooperative, which doesn't make sense. Competition is the opposite of cooperation, so B is wrong. Option C says it's only physical confrontation. No, because scramble competition doesn't involve that, so C is incorrect. 

Option D claims it's solely about water. That's too narrow because competition can be about food, space, mates, etc., not just water. So D is out. Option E says competition is only within the same species, called intraspecific. Wait, no, I think there's also interspecific competition, which is between different species. So E is wrong because competition isn't only intraspecific. 

Option F mentions predation and mutualism as types of competition. That doesn't sound right. Predation is when one species hunts another, which is different from competition. Mutualism is a cooperative interaction, so F is mixing things up and is incorrect. 

Option G states that competition always causes extinction. That's too absolute. While competition can lead to one species being outcompeted, it doesn't always result in extinction. Sometimes they might coexist by using resources differently. So G is wrong.

So the correct answer should be A. It correctly describes competition as the active demand for resources and categorizes it into contest and scramble types.

The correct answer is:

**A: Competition is the active demand of two or more organisms for a common vital resource. It can be categorized into Contest competition and Scramble competition.**

This option accurately describes competition and its types. Competition involves the demand for shared resources and is divided into contest (direct competition) and scramble (indirect competition). Other options either misrepresent competition or conflate it with other ecological interactions. 

Answer: A
