Okay, so I've got this problem here about inventory valuation methods. Hmm, I need to figure out the value of the ending inventory using three different methods: average cost, FIFO, and LIFO. Let's see what the question says.

The company is Pinson's Wholesale Hardware, and they're taking a year-end inventory on December 31. They have 44,000 steel bolts on hand. The purchase and inventory records show:

- January 1 beginning inventory: 27,000 units at $6.00 each.
- March 12 purchase: 50,000 units at $6.50.
- September 11 purchase: 35,000 units at $7.00.
- December 3 purchase: 40,000 units at $7.50.

Wait, so the beginning inventory is 27,000. Then they bought more throughout the year. I think I need to calculate the total units available for sale and then see how much was sold to find out the ending inventory, but wait, the ending inventory is given as 44,000. Oh, right, because the question says the actual count on Dec 31 is 44,000. So I don't need to calculate units sold or anything; the ending inventory is 44k.

But wait, the beginning inventory plus purchases are the total goods available. Let me check:

Total available = 27,000 + 50,000 + 35,000 +40,000 = 152,000. But the ending inventory is 44,000. So units sold would be 152k -44k = 108,000. But I think for the methods, I don't need to focus on units sold, just on the ending inventory value.

So I need to find the value of the 44,000 units using each method.

Let me start with the average cost method.

Average cost: This method takes the total cost of all goods available for sale and divides by the total units, then multiplies by the ending units.

Total cost would be sum of each purchase's quantity * cost per unit.

So:

Beginning inventory: 27,000 * $6 = $162,000.

March 12: 50k *6.5= 325,000.

Sep 11:35k *7=245,000.

Dec3:40k *7.5=300,000.

Total cost = 162k + 325k +245k +300k.

Let me add these up.

162 + 325 = 487; 487+245=732; 732+300=1032. So total cost is $1,032,000.

Total units available = 27k +50k+35k+40k=152,000.

Average cost per unit = 1,032,000 / 152,000.

Let me compute that. 152k is 152,000.

1,032,000 รท 152,000 = let's see, 152 *6=912, which is less than 1032. 152*6.8=1033.6, because 152*6=912, 152*.8=121.6; 912+121.6=1033.6. So 1,032,000 is 1032, so 1032/152 is approximately 6.8. So 6.794 approximately. Let me compute it more accurately.

152,000 * 6 = 912,000.

1,032,000 -912,000 = 120,000.

Then, 120,000 /152,000 = 0.78947.

So average cost is about 6.78947, approximately $6.79 per unit.

But wait, let me compute it exactly: 1,032,000 รท152,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 1,032,000 รท8=129,000; 152,000 รท8=19,000.

So 129,000 /19,000.

Hmm, 19 * 6 = 114, so 129-114=15. So 6 and 15/19, which is about 6.789.

So each unit is about $6.79. So ending inventory is 44,000 *6.79.

Let me compute that: 44,000 *6 =264,000. 44,000 *0.79= 34,760. So total is 298,760. So approximately $298,760. So the average cost value is around $298,760.

Wait, but looking at the options, the average cost is in the options as options A through J, but the numbers are much smaller. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the units are 44,000, which is 44k units. So 44k * average cost per unit.

Wait, but in the options, the average cost is given as a value in the hundreds, like option G is 298.76. Wait, but wait, 44k times 6.79 is 298,760, which would be in the hundreds of thousands. But the options are like 298.76. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, looking at the options again, the numbers are way smaller, like $300, $400. Wait, maybe the units are 440 instead of 44,000? No, the question says 44,000. Alternatively, perhaps the options are in terms of per unit? No, the question asks for the value of the inventory, which would be in dollars, so 44,000 units times the cost per unit.

Wait, perhaps the options are in terms of per unit cost. But the question says "value of the December 31 inventory", which would be the total dollar amount. So the average cost method would be 44,000 * average cost per unit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average cost calculation. Let me recompute.

Total cost = 27k *6 = 162,000.

50k *6.5= 325,000.

35k *7=245,000.

40k *7.5=300,000.

Total cost: 162+325=487; 487+245=732; 732+300=1032. So $1,032,000.

Total units available: 27+50+35+40 = 152,000.

Average cost per unit: 1,032,000 /152,000 = 6.78947 dollars.

So ending inventory is 44,000 *6.78947 = let's compute this more accurately.

Compute 44,000 *6 = 264,000.

44,000 *0.78947 = ?

Compute 44,000 *0.7 = 30,800.

44,000 *0.08 = 3,520.

44,000 *0.00947 = approx 44,000 *0.01=440, so 0.947% less, so about 416.52.

So 30,800 +3,520=34,320 +416.52=34,736.52.

Total average cost: 264,000 +34,736.52=298,736.52.

Approximately $298,736.52. So the average cost method gives about $298,737.

Looking at the options, option G says average cost $298.76. Hmm, but that's way smaller than 298k. So perhaps the question is asking for the cost per unit? No, the question says "value of the December 31 inventory", so it's the total amount, which is in the hundreds of thousands. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the total cost. Let me check again.

27,000 *6 = 162,000.

50,000 *6.5 = 325,000.

35,000 *7 = 245,000.

40,000 *7.5=300,000.

Adding them up: 162 + 325 = 487; 487 +245=732; 732 +300=1032. So total is $1,032,000.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the options are in terms of the value per unit, not the total. But the options list FIFO, LIFO, etc., and the numbers are in the hundreds. So perhaps the question is asking for the cost per unit under each method, and then multiplied by the ending quantity. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the units are 44, not 44,000. But the question says 44,000. Unless I misread it. Let me check the question again.

"44,000 of these bolts on hand by actual count on December 31."

So yes, 44,000 units. So the value should be 44,000 multiplied by the cost per unit under each method.

Wait, perhaps the options are for the value in thousands of dollars? Let me see.

For example, option G: Average cost $298.76, FIFO $328, LIFO $272.50.

If that's the case, then 298.76 thousand would be $298,760, which matches my average cost calculation.

Similarly, FIFO would be $328,000, and LIFO $272,500.

Looking at the options, option G matches that.

Wait, but let me proceed to calculate FIFO and LIFO to be sure.

FIFO method: the earliest units are sold first, so the ending inventory is composed of the most recent purchases.

So to find the cost of the 44,000 units in ending inventory, we need to see which purchases they came from.

The total units available for sale are 152,000. Ending inventory is 44,000, so units sold are 108,000.

Under FIFO, the first units sold are the earliest purchases. So the 108,000 units sold would come first from beginning inventory, then March 12, then Sep 11, etc.

So let's see how much is sold:

Beginning inventory: 27,000. So sold all 27k.

Then, March 12 purchase: 50k. So sold 50k.

Then Sep 11: 35k. So sold all 35k.

Then Dec 3 purchase: 40k. So of the 108k sold, 27+50+35=112k, but wait, that's more than 108k. Wait, 27+50=77, plus 35 is 112. So 108k would be 27 +50 + (108-77)=31 from Sep 11.

Wait, let me retrace:

Total units sold: 152k -44k =108k.

So:

First, the beginning inventory: 27k are sold.

Remaining to sell: 108k -27k =81k.

Next, March 12 purchase: 50k sold.

Remaining:81k -50k=31k.

Next, Sep 11 purchase: 35k available, but only 31k needed.

So sold 31k from Sep 11.

Thus, the units sold are:

27k (beginning) +50k (Mar) +31k (Sep).

So the remaining inventory, which is 44k, comes from:

Sep 11 purchase:35k -31k sold=4k left.

Plus Dec 3 purchase:40k (none sold, since we only needed 31k from Sep 11).

So 4k +40k=44k.

Thus, the ending inventory consists of 4,000 units from Sep 11 at $7.00 each, and 40,000 units from Dec 3 at $7.50 each.

So FIFO cost is (4,000 *7) + (40,000 *7.5).

Compute that:

4k *7=28,000.

40k *7.5=300,000.

Total FIFO value: 328,000.

Now LIFO method: the most recent units are sold first. So the ending inventory would consist of the earliest units.

Wait, no, in LIFO, the cost of the most recent units are expensed first. So the ending inventory would consist of the oldest units.

Wait, no, wait. LIFO stands for Last In, First Out. So the last units purchased are the first ones sold. So when calculating ending inventory, we take the earliest units available.

Wait, no, let me think again. Under LIFO, the units sold are the most recent ones. So when calculating the cost of goods sold, we take from the latest purchases first. Therefore, the ending inventory would consist of the earliest units that were not sold.

So let's see. The total units available are 152k. Units sold:108k.

Under LIFO, the 108k sold would be taken from the most recent purchases first.

So the order would be:

Dec 3 purchase:40k.

Sep 11 purchase:35k.

March 12:50k.

Beginning inventory:27k.

So to get 108k units sold:

First, take all 40k from Dec 3.

Then 35k from Sep 11.

Then 50k from March 12: but 40+35=75k; 108-75=33k left to sell.

So take 33k from March 12.

So units sold are 40k (Dec3) +35k (Sep11) +33k (Mar12).

Thus, the remaining inventory (44k) would consist of:

Mar 12:50k -33k=17k left.

Plus beginning inventory:27k (none sold, since we took from later purchases first).

Wait, wait, no. Because in LIFO, the sold units are taken from the most recent first, so the remaining inventory would be the oldest units.

Wait, after selling 40k (Dec3) +35k (Sep11) +33k (Mar12) =108k.

So what's left is:

Mar 12:50k -33k=17k.

Sep11:35k -35k=0.

Dec3:40k -40k=0.

And the beginning inventory:27k.

So total remaining:17k +27k=44k.

So the ending inventory consists of 27k from beginning inventory at $6.00, and 17k from March 12 at $6.50.

Thus, LIFO value is (27k *6) + (17k *6.5).

Compute this:

27k *6=162,000.

17k *6.5=17,000 *6.5=110,500.

Total LIFO value: 162,000 +110,500=272,500.

So summarizing:

Average cost: ~$298,760.

FIFO: $328,000.

LIFO: $272,500.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option G: Average cost $298.76, FIFO $328, LIFO $272.50.

But wait, the numbers in the options are in the hundreds, but our calculations are in the thousands. Oh wait, perhaps the options are in thousands of dollars. So $298,760 would be $298.76 thousand, which is option G.

Wait, but the options list each method's value with a decimal, like $298.76. So perhaps it's presented as the value in thousands, but with the decimal as is.

So yes, option G matches exactly.
</think>

To determine the value of the December 31 inventory using the average cost, FIFO, and LIFO methods, the following calculations were performed:

### Average Cost Method
1. **Total Cost of Goods Available**:  
   - Beginning inventory: \( 27,000 \times 6 = 162,000 \)  
   - March 12 purchase: \( 50,000 \times 6.5 = 325,000 \)  
   - September 11 purchase: \( 35,000 \times 7 = 245,000 \)  
   - December 3 purchase: \( 40,000 \times 7.5 = 300,000 \)  
   - **Total Cost**: \( 162,000 + 325,000 + 245,000 + 300,000 = 1,032,000 \).  

2. **Total Units Available**: \( 27,000 + 50,000 + 35,000 + 40,000 = 152,000 \).  

3. **Average Cost Per Unit**:  
   \[
   \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Total Units}} = \frac{1,032,000}{152,000} \approx 6.79.
   \]

4. **Value of Ending Inventory**:  
   \[
   \text{Value} = \text{Ending Units} \times \text{Average Cost} = 44,000 \times 6.79 \approx 298,760.
   \]

### FIFO Method
1. **Units Sold**:  
   - Total units available: \( 152,000 \).  
   - Ending inventory: \( 44,000 \).  
   - Units sold: \( 152,000 - 44,000 = 108,000 \).  

2. **Cost of Ending Inventory**:  
   - The earliest units are sold first. After selling \( 108,000 \), the remaining \( 44,000 \) units in inventory are:  
     - \( 4,000 \) units from the September 11 purchase (\( 35,000 - 31,000 \)) at \( 7.00 \).  
     - \( 40,000 \) units from the December 3 purchase at \( 7.50 \).  

   - **Value of Ending Inventory**:  
     \[
     \text{Value} = (4,000 \times 7) + (40,000 \times 7.5) = 28,000 + 300,000 = 328,000.
     \]

### LIFO Method
1. **Units Sold**:  
   - Total units available: \( 152,000 \).  
   - Ending inventory: \( 44,000 \).  
   - Units sold: \( 152,000 - 44,000 = 108,000 \).  

2. **Cost of Ending Inventory**:  
   - The most recent units are sold first. After selling \( 108,000 \), the remaining \( 44,000 \) units in inventory are:  
     - \( 27,000 \) units from the beginning inventory at \( 6.00 \).  
     - \( 17,000 \) units from the March 12 purchase (\( 50,000 - 33,000 \)) at \( 6.50 \).  

   - **Value of Ending Inventory**:  
     \[
     \text{Value} = (27,000 \times 6) + (17,000 \times 6.5) = 162,000 + 110,500 = 272,500.
     \]

### Final Answer
- **Average Cost**: \( 298,760 \) (approx \( 298.76 \) thousand
