Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about nonverbal and primarily nonculturally biased abilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which term refers to abilities that are nonverbal and not heavily influenced by cultural factors. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that intelligence is often categorized in different ways. I think there's something called fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. Oh right, that's from Cattell and Horn. Fluid intelligence is about problem-solving in new situations, using logic and reasoning. It's not dependent on learned knowledge, so it's less culturally biased. Crystallized intelligence is about the knowledge you've acquired over time, like facts and skills, which is more culturally influenced because it's learned.

So the question is about nonverbal and less culturally biased. Fluid intelligence fits because it's more about abstract thinking and doesn't rely on verbal skills or cultural knowledge. It's the kind of intelligence you use when you're faced with novel problems and need to figure them out on the spot.

Let me look at the options. The options are A to J. Option H is fluid intelligence. That sounds right.

Wait, what's the other options? Let's see. Option B is crystallized intelligence, which I think is the oppositeâ€”more culturally based. Option C is abstract reasoning, which might be a part of fluid intelligence, but I'm not sure if that's one of the standard terms. Option H is fluid intelligence, which I think is the correct answer.

So I'll go with H.

The question asks about nonverbal and primarily nonculturally biased abilities. Fluid intelligence, which refers to the ability to solve novel problems using logic and reasoning without relying on learned knowledge, fits this description. It is less influenced by cultural factors compared to crystallized intelligence. Among the options, fluid intelligence corresponds to option H.
