Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Thomas buying a lawn mower on an installment plan. Hmm, I need to figure out the monthly payment and the true interest rate. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the lawn mower costs $190, and he's paying in 6 equal monthly payments. There's a service charge of 8% per year, which is a flat fee. Wait, so the service charge is an annual rate, but he's paying monthly. I think I need to calculate the interest rate per month or something like that.

Wait, no. The 8% is a flat fee per year as a service charge. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how that works. So, the service charge is probably the interest. So the total interest he's being charged is 8% of $190? Let me think. Or is it the annual rate, and the payments are monthly, so I have to calculate the effective interest rate?

Wait, maybe I should approach this as an installment loan problem. So the present value is $190, and he's paying it back over 6 months with a certain interest rate. The service charge is 8% annually, but since the payments are monthly, I probably need to adjust the interest rate to a monthly rate.

Wait, but the service charge is a flat fee. So maybe it's a simple interest calculation. Let me think. Simple interest is calculated as principal × rate × time. So the interest would be 190 × 8% × time. But wait, the time here is 6 months, which is 0.5 years. So that would be 190 * 0.08 * 0.5 = 190 * 0.04 = $7.6. So the total amount he has to pay is 190 + 7.6 = $197.6. Then each monthly payment would be 197.6 divided by 6. Let me calculate that: 197.6 /6 ≈ 32.933... So approximately $32.93 per month.

But wait, the options have $32.93 in option F, which says 13.7% as the true interest rate. But wait, what's the true interest rate? The 8% is the service charge, which I used as the annual rate. But since he's paying over 6 months, maybe the true interest rate is higher because the payments are made each month, so the principal decreases each month.

Wait, maybe I should use the concept of the annual percentage rate (APR) and the effective annual rate (EAR). Oh, right, because when you have payments more frequent than annually, the effective rate can be higher.

Wait, but in this case, the service charge is 8% per annum, but the payments are monthly. So perhaps the 8% is the nominal annual rate, and we need to find the effective annual rate, which would be higher. Alternatively, maybe the 8% is already the effective rate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a loan with monthly payments, using the present value of an annuity formula.

The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) on an installment loan is:

PMT = PV * [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1 ]

Where PV is the present value (loan amount), i is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

But wait, we don't know the monthly interest rate yet. The service charge is 8% annually, but is that the nominal rate or the effective rate?

Wait, the problem says he was charged a flat fee of 8% per year as a service charge. So I think that 8% is the annual interest rate, and since he's paying monthly, I can find the monthly interest rate by dividing 8% by 12. So i = 0.08 / 12 ≈ 0.0066667 per month.

Then, using the present value formula, I can calculate each monthly payment.

So PV is $190, i is 0.08/12, and n is 6.

So plugging into the formula:

PMT = 190 * [ (0.0066667)(1 + 0.0066667)^6 ] / [ (1 + 0.0066667)^6 - 1 ]

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute (1 + 0.0066667)^6. 0.0066667 is approximately 1/150, but let me compute it accurately.

0.0066667 is 0.0066666667 → 2/300 = 1/150.

Wait, 0.08 /12 is 0.006666..., yes.

So (1 + 0.0066667) = 1.0066667.

Now, raising this to the 6th power. Let me compute 1.0066667^6.

Alternatively, since it's 6 months, perhaps it's easier to compute as (1 + i)^n.

Wait, 1.0066667^6.

Let me compute it step by step:

1.0066667^1 = 1.0066667

^2 = 1.0066667 * 1.0066667 ≈ let's see, 1.0066667 * 1.0066667. Let me compute it:

1.0066667 * 1.0066667 = (1 + 0.0066667)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0066667 + (0.0066667)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0133334 + 0.0000444 ≈ 1.0133778.

^3: 1.0133778 * 1.0066667 ≈ Let's compute this.

1.0133778 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.0133778 + (1.0133778 * 0.0066667).

1.0133778 * 0.0066667 ≈ approx 0.00676. So total ≈ 1.0201378.

Wait, but more accurately, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for (1 + i)^n where i=0.08/12=0.0066667 and n=6.

So, (1.0066667)^6 ≈ e^(6*0.0066667) → But that's an approximation. Alternatively, using binomial expansion or just computing step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for calculating the monthly payment. But maybe I can think of this as simple interest.

Wait, wait a minute. The problem says it's a flat fee of 8% per year. So maybe it's a simple interest calculation. So the interest for the entire period would be 8% per annum, but since he's paying over 6 months, maybe the interest is 4% of the principal, because it's half a year.

So total amount = principal + interest = 190 + (190 * 0.08 * 0.5) → 190 + (190 * 0.04) = 190 + 7.6 = 197.6.

So each payment is 197.6 /6 = approx 32.9333, so $32.93 per month.

But what's the true interest rate? Because the question also asks for the true interest rate he was charged.

Wait, the true interest rate would be the effective annual rate (EAR), considering that he's paying the interest over 6 months. So the effective rate is calculated based on the monthly payments.

Alternatively, maybe the 8% is the annual rate, and the effective rate is higher because the interest is compounded more frequently.

Wait, no, in this case, the service charge is a flat fee, so it's probably simple interest, not compound interest. So the interest is 8% annually, but since he's paying over 6 months, the interest charged is 4% (because it's half a year). So total interest is $7.60.

But the question asks for the true interest rate. Hmm. The true interest rate could be calculated as the rate that would equate the present value of the payments to the loan amount.

So, the present value (PV) is 190, and each payment is PMT at the end of each month for 6 months.

So, PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-6 ) / r ]

We can solve for r, the monthly interest rate, and then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.

Wait, but earlier I calculated PMT as approximately $32.93. Let's plug that into the formula.

190 = 32.93 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-6 ) / r ]

We can rearrange this to find r.

But solving for r here might be a bit tricky without a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps using approximation methods or knowing that option F is 13.7%, which would be the EAR.

Wait, the 8% is the nominal annual rate, compounded monthly. So the EAR would be (1 + 0.08/12)^12 - 1 ≈ (1.0066667)^12 -1 ≈ 1.083, so about 8.3%? No, wait, that's the EAR for the nominal rate of 8% compounded monthly. But in this case, the service charge is 8% per annum, but the way the interest is applied is as a flat fee. So perhaps the true interest rate is higher because he's paying off the loan in installments.

Wait, perhaps the true interest rate is the rate that, when applied to the declining balance, results in the total interest paid being $7.60.

Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is calculated based on the monthly payments. Let me think again.

Wait, the monthly payment is $32.93, as calculated using simple interest. Now, to find the true interest rate, perhaps we can compute the internal rate of return (IRR) of the payments.

So the loan is $190, and each month he pays $32.93. So we can model this as a series of 6 cash flows of $32.93 at the end of each month, and the present value is $190. We need to find the interest rate r that makes the present value of the payments equal to $190.

So, the formula is:

190 = 32.93/(1 + r) + 32.93/(1 + r)^2 + ... + 32.93/(1 + r)^6

This is a geometric series, so the present value factor is [1 - (1 + r)^-6 ] / r.

So,

190 = 32.93 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-6 ) / r ]

We can rearrange to:

[ (1 - (1 + r)^-6 ) / r ] = 190 / 32.93 ≈ 5.766

So, find r such that (1 - (1 + r)^-6 ) / r ≈ 5.766.

This is trial and error without a calculator, but perhaps we can estimate r.

Let me try r = 1% per month (0.01):

(1 - 1.01^-6 ) / 0.01 = (1 - approx 0.9419 ) / 0.01 = (0.0581)/0.01 ≈ 5.81. Close to 5.766.

At r=1%, we get 5.81. We need 5.766, which is slightly less, so the rate is a bit less than 1% per month.

Wait, let's try r=0.99% (0.0099):

(1 - (1.0099)^-6 ) / 0.0099.

Compute 1.0099^6 ≈ using binomial approx: 1 + 6*0.0099 + (6*5)/2*(0.0099)^2 + ... ≈ 1 + 0.0594 + 0.000297 = 1.0597.

So 1.0099^6 ≈ 1.0597, so 1/(1.0597) ≈ 0.944.

So 1 - 0.944 = 0.056.

0.056 / 0.0099 ≈ 5.656, which is lower than 5.766.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach. Let me compute for r=0.008 (0.8% per month):

(1 - (1.008)^-6 ) / 0.008.

Calculate (1.008)^6: 1.008^6 ≈ 1 + 6*0.008 + (6*5/2)*(0.008)^2 + ... ≈ 1 + 0.048 + 0.00096 = 1.04896.

Wait, more accurately, 1.008^6:

1.008^1 = 1.008

^2 = 1.016064

^3 ≈ 1.024192 (approx)

Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step:

1.008^2 = 1.016064

^3 = 1.016064 * 1.008 ≈ 1.024193

^4 ≈ 1.024193 * 1.008 ≈ 1.032319

^5 ≈ 1.032319 * 1.008 ≈ 1.040734

^6 ≈ 1.040734 * 1.008 ≈ 1.049119.

So (1.008)^6 ≈ 1.049119. So 1/(1.049119) ≈ 0.9531.

So 1 - 0.9531 ≈ 0.0469.

0.0469 / 0.008 ≈ 5.8625.

Hmm, that's higher than 5.766.

Wait, we're looking for a value where (1 - (1 + r)^-6 ) / r = 5.766.

Between r=0.008 (5.8625) and r=0.009 (5.81? Wait, no, let me compute r=0.009.

r=0.009 (0.9% per month):

(1 - (1.009)^-6 ) / 0.009.

Compute (1.009)^6:

1.009^1 = 1.009

^2 = 1.018081

^3 ≈ 1.02737

^4 ≈ 1.03694

^5 ≈ 1.04689

^6 ≈ 1.05703.

So 1/(1.05703) ≈ 0.9457.

1 - 0.9457 = 0.0543.

0.0543 / 0.009 ≈ 6.033. That's higher than 5.766. Wait, this can't be right because as r increases, the denominator increases, and the numerator (1 - (1 + r)^-6) increases as well, but perhaps the overall factor decreases.

Wait, maybe I should try r=1.2% per month (0.012):

(1 - (1.012)^-6 ) / 0.012.

Compute (1.012)^6: 1.012^6 ≈ 1.0753.

So 1/1.0753 ≈ 0.9307.

1 - 0.9307 = 0.0693.

0.0693 / 0.012 ≈ 5.775, which is very close to 5.766.

So r ≈ 1.2% per month. So the monthly rate is approximately 1.2%, so the annual rate would be 1.2% * 12 = 14.4%. But wait, that's the nominal annual rate. The effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.012)^12 - 1 ≈ 1.1268 - 1 = 0.1268 or 12.68%.

Wait, but our calculation here is using the monthly rate to find the present value. So the true interest rate is the effective annual rate, which would be higher than the nominal rate.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is the rate that when applied monthly, the present value of the monthly payments equals $190.

So, in our case, we found that the monthly rate is approximately 1.2%, which when annualized would be 14.4% as the nominal rate, but the effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.012)^12 -1 ≈ 12.68%.

Wait, but the options don't have 12.68%. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 14.5% → that's higher than 12.68%.

Option F: 13.7% → which is close to our calculated 12.68%, but not exact.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the estimation. Let me try r=1.15% per month.

So, for r=0.0115:

Compute (1 - (1.0115)^-6 ) / 0.0115.

First, compute (1.0115)^6:

1.0115^2 ≈ 1.0230.

^3: 1.0230 * 1.0115 ≈ 1.0349.

^4: 1.0349 * 1.0115 ≈ 1.0469.

^5: 1.0469 * 1.0115 ≈ 1.0592.

^6: 1.0592 * 1.0115 ≈ 1.0713.

So (1.0115)^6 ≈ 1.0713 → 1/1.0713 ≈ 0.9336.

So 1 - 0.9336 = 0.0664.

0.0664 / 0.0115 ≈ 5.7826, which is very close to our target of 5.766. So r≈1.15% per month.

So the monthly rate is approximately 1.15%, so the nominal annual rate is 1.15% *12=13.8%. The effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.0115)^12 -1.

Calculate that:

(1.0115)^12 ≈ Let me compute step by step.

1.0115^2 ≈ 1.0230

^4 ≈ (1.0230)^2 ≈ 1.0461

^8 ≈ (1.0461)^2 ≈ 1.0945

^12: 1.0945 * 1.0461 * 1.0230 → Hmm, perhaps better to compute as (1.0115)^12.

Alternatively, using the rule of 72, but perhaps it's easier to approximate. But for a more accurate calculation, perhaps using a Taylor expansion or a better method.

Alternatively, using the formula (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) when r is small, but 0.0115 is 1.15%, which is small.

So, ln
