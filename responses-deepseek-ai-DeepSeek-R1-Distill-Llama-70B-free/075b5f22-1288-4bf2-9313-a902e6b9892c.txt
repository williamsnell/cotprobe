Alright, so I've got this question about a political movement based on some song lyrics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the song is called "The Hayseed," and the lyrics talk about being a tool of oppression and being as green as a sucker. The song mentions railroads and old party bosses banding together against a poor hayseed. So, I'm thinking this is about someone feeling oppressed by big businesses and political machines.

The question is asking about the accomplishment of the political movement that shares similar sentiments. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Okay, let's think about the historical context. The song seems to be talking about issues related to railroads and political bosses. That makes me think of the Populist movement in the late 19th century. Populists were mainly farmers and laborers who were against big businesses, especially railroads, and wanted political reforms.

Looking at the options:

A: Enactment of laws regulating railroads. That sounds familiar. Populists were big on railroad regulation because they felt the railroads were charging unfair rates. The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was one of the first federal regulations on railroads, so this might be it.

B: Institution of the Federal Reserve System. I think that was more from the Progressive era and the Federal Reserve was established in 1913. Populists were earlier and had pushed for free silver and other monetary reforms, but the Fed is a bit later.

C: Creation of the National Park Service. That's more about conservation, which was a Progressive movement thing, especially under Teddy Roosevelt. Not sure it ties directly to the Populists.

D: Creation of a price-support system for small-scale farmers. That sounds more like something from the New Deal era, maybe the Agricultural Adjustment Administration? But earlier movements like Populists might have wanted similar things, but I'm not certain.

E: Establishment of the social security system. That's definitely New Deal, so not related here.

F: Abolition of child labor. That's Progressive reforms, maybe around the 1910s.

G: Establishment of the minimum wage law. Also Progressive era, I think.

H: Introduction of the direct election of U.S. Senators. Oh wait, that's the 17th Amendment, which was ratified in 1913. Populists and Progressives pushed for that because they wanted to reduce the power of political bosses who controlled the state legislatures that previously elected senators.

I: Passage of the 19th Amendment, women's suffrage. That's 1920, so later than the Populist movement.

J: Shift in currency to silver standard. Populists were big on free silver, which was about using silver as a backing for the currency to inflate the money supply and help farmers. So this could be relevant.

Wait, the question is about an accomplishment. The Populists managed to get some of their demands into law. The direct election of senators was one, and railroad regulation was another. The song specifically mentions railroads, so option A might be the one.

Alternatively, the Populists also supported the free silver movement, but I'm not sure if that was accomplished. The Federal Reserve was later, so J might not be correct.

So between A and H. The song's lyrics talk about railroads, so A seems directly related. Also, the Interstate Commerce Act was a result of Populist pressure.

So I think the answer is A: Enactment of laws regulating railroads.

The song lyrics reflect sentiments associated with the Populist movement of the late 19th century, which focused on issues like railroad regulation and opposition to political bosses. Among the options provided, the enactment of laws regulating railroads aligns directly with the Populists' goals, as they advocated for fair railroad rates and were instrumental in the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. This makes option A the most appropriate answer.

Answer: A
