The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Two co-defendants were investment brokers at a bank. They had been employed by the bank for ten years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the bank's new manager. Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. If the co-defendants are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
B: Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
C: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.
D: Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
E: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
F: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, and only one is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
G: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
H: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
I: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, and only one is guilty of murder.
J: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with murder and conspiracy charges. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this involves concepts like felony murder and conspiracy. Let me try to break it down.

So, the scenario is about two co-defendants who used to work as investment brokers at a bank. They were fired, which upset them, and they decided to get revenge. Their plan was to plant a bomb in the bank, demand $2 million, and then reveal the bomb's location to defuse it. They wanted to avoid hurting anyone, so they gave a 24-hour warning. They built the bomb from internet instructions, placed it in a supply closet, called the bank to make the demand, but the bank refused. When they tried to defuse it, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. Now they're charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

The question is asking which statement among the options is correct regarding their guilt.

First, I need to figure out the elements of the charges. Conspiracy to commit murder would require an agreement between the two to commit murder. They did agree to plant the bomb and make the threat, so that's a conspiracy. But wait, their plan was to demand money and then defuse it, so they didn't intend to kill anyone. But they still caused death, so does that affect the conspiracy charge?

Murder usually requires malice aforethought, which can be express (intent to kill) or implied (intent to cause serious bodily harm, or acting with reckless disregard for human life). But in this case, their intention was to extort money, not to kill. However, they were planting a bomb, which is an inherently dangerous act. So maybe felony murder applies here.

Felony murder is when a death occurs during the commission of a felony. The underlying felony here could be extortion or maybe even the act of planting the bomb. So if the bomb exploded during the commission of that felony, felony murder charges would apply. But wait, felony murder doesn't require intent to kill, just the intent to commit the underlying felony.

So, the co-defendants might be guilty of felony murder because they were committing a felony (like planting a bomb with the intent to extort), and the bomb caused deaths. Both participated in the crime, so both could be liable under felony murder.

As for conspiracy, they did agree to commit a crime. Their plan was to plant the bomb and make the threat. But what was the specific intent? They intended to extort money, not to kill. Conspiracy to commit murder requires the intent to kill. If their plan was to just place the bomb as a threat without intending it to explode, maybe the conspiracy wasn't for murder but for another crime like extortion or making a bomb threat.

But wait, the bomb did explode, so maybe under the felony murder rule, the underlying felony (like the illegal use of explosives or the act of planting the bomb with intent to terrorize) would make them guilty of felony murder. But for conspiracy, the agreement must be to commit the specific crime. If they agreed to plant a bomb to extort money, not to kill, then the conspiracy would be to commit the felony of planting a destructive device or extortion, not murder.

Wait, but the question says they are charged with conspiracy to commit murder. So if their agreement was to place a bomb and make a threat, but without the intent to kill, then the conspiracy charge might not hold because they didn't agree to murder. Unless the act of planting the bomb with the intent to cause fear is enough, but I think conspiracy to murder requires the specific intent to kill.

So, considering that, they might not be guilty of conspiracy to commit murder because their intent wasn't to kill but to extort. However, they could be guilty of another conspiracy charge, like conspiracy to commit extortion or using a destructive device. But the question specifically asks about conspiracy to commit murder.

Wait, but the possible answers include options where both are guilty of conspiracy and murder, or one is guilty, etc.

Alternatively, maybe their planting of the bomb with the intent to extort constitutes an act that a reasonable person would know could cause death, so perhaps the mens rea for murder could be implied. But I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions require that the defendant have a reckless disregard for human life, which might apply here because planting a bomb is dangerous. So maybe they could be charged with murder under a theory of depraved heart murder.

But felony murder is more straightforward. If the underlying felony is a forcible felony (like planting a bomb), then any death during that felony would make them guilty of felony murder.

So if both co-defendants were part of the plan, they could both be guilty of felony murder. But what about conspiracy? If their agreement was to commit the felony (like planting the bomb for extortion), then they're guilty of conspiracy to commit that felony, but not necessarily conspiracy to commit murder unless their intent was to kill.

So, looking at the options:

Option B says both are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Option E says both guilty of felony murder, but not conspiracy.

Option C says both guilty of conspiracy to commit murder but not murder. But I don't think they conspired to murder; they conspired to plant a bomb for extortion.

Option B would require that they conspired to commit murder, which might not be the case.

Wait, the key here is that conspiracy to commit murder requires the intent to kill. They intended to extort, not to kill. So the conspiracy was to commit a different crime. Thus, they are not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. But they could be guilty of conspiracy to commit another felony, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question says they are charged with conspiracy to commit murder. So the question is whether their actions meet the elements of that charge.

So, if the conspiracy was to plant a bomb and make threats to extort money, but without intending to kill, then they didn't conspire to commit murder. Therefore, they wouldn't be guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. However, because they committed a felony (like unlawful use of explosives) and a death occurred, they could be guilty of felony murder.

Looking back at the options, option E says both are guilty of felony murder, but neither guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. Option B says both guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Wait, but if they're guilty of felony murder, that's murder. So option B would say they are guilty of murder (yes, via felony murder) and conspiracy to commit murder (no, because their conspiracy was for another crime).

Wait, no, conspiracy to commit murder is a separate charge. So the murder charge would be under felony murder, and the conspiracy charge would be about whether they agreed to commit murder. Since their agreement was to plant a bomb for extortion, not to kill, the conspiracy to commit murder charge wouldn't stick.

So, the correct charges would be murder (under felony murder) but not conspiracy to commit murder.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Option B: Both guilty of murder and conspiracy.

But wait, the question asks if they are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. So, are they guilty of both? I think they are guilty of murder via felony murder, but not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder because their agreement wasn't to kill.

So the correct option would be that both are guilty of murder (felony murder) but only guilty of conspiracy to commit the underlying felony, not murder.

Wait, but the options don't all separate this. Looking again:

Option B: Both guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Option E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Wait, the question says they are charged with conspiracy to commit murder. So if they didn't conspire to murder, then they are not guilty of that charge.

So, for murder, they are guilty under felony murder. For conspiracy to commit murder, they are not guilty because their intent was to extort, not to kill.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option E says both are guilty of felony murder and neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. So that would mean they are guilty of murder (as felony murder) but not of the conspiracy charge.

But the options don't have an option where they are guilty of murder but not conspiracy. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: Both guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Option E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

So, if they are guilty of felony murder, that's murder, and not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, then the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the question says if they are charged with both. So the charges are murder and conspiracy to commit murder. So, are they guilty of both charges?

I think they are guilty of murder (felony murder) but not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. So in the options, that would correspond to E, which says both guilty of felony murder and neither guilty of conspiracy. But wait, option E says "neither guilty of conspiracy to commit murder." So yes, that would fit.

Alternatively, if the conspiracy was to plant a bomb with intent to extort, that's a different conspiracy. But the question is about conspiracy to commit murder, so they wouldn't be guilty of that.

So the correct answer is E: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Wait, but option B says both guilty of murder and conspiracy. I thought conspiracy to commit murder wasn't applicable. So I think E is correct.

Wait, but another angle: when they placed the bomb, did they have the intent to kill? No, they intended to extort. So their mens rea for murder isn't present unless it's felony murder. So for murder, it's felony murder. For conspiracy, they conspired to commit the felony (extortion or placing a bomb), but not murder.

So the answer should be E.
</think>

The scenario involves two co-defendants who planted a bomb in a bank as part of a revenge plan to extort $2,000,000. Although their intent was not to kill but to threaten, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. The question asks whether they are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Murder Charge**:  
   Murder requires malice aforethought, which can be express (intent to kill) or implied (reckless disregard for human life). Here, the co-defendants did not intend to kill but planted a bomb, an inherently dangerous act. Under the **felony murder rule**, any death occurring during the commission of a felony (e.g., planting a bomb or extortion) makes them guilty of murder, regardless of intent to kill. Thus, both co-defendants are guilty of **felony murder**.

2. **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**:  
   Conspiracy to commit murder requires an agreement to kill. The co-defendants' plan was to extort money, not to kill. Their agreement was to plant a bomb and make threats, but they did not intend for the bomb to explode or for anyone to die. Therefore, they did not conspire to commit murder. They may have conspired to commit other crimes (e.g., extortion or using a destructive device), but not murder.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While both are guilty of murder (via felony murder), they are not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder because their agreement was not to kill.  
   - **Option E**: Correct. Both are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.  
   - Other options (e.g., A, C, D, F, G, H, I, J) are inconsistent with the analysis above.

### Conclusion:
The co-defendants are guilty of **felony murder** because the bomb caused deaths during the commission of a felony, but they are not guilty of **conspiracy to commit murder** because their agreement was to extort money, not to kill.
