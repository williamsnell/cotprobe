Question:

Write 7 over 33 as a decimal.

Options:

A: 0.021 repeating
B: 0.3333
C: 0.23 Repeating
D: 0.21 Repeating
E: 0.07 Repeating
F: 0.22 Repeating
G: 0.31 Repeating
H: 0.2121
I: 0.22
J: 0.2133

Answer:
    <think>


To convert the fraction \( \frac{7}{33} \) into a decimal, we perform the division \( 7 \div 33 \).

1. **Set up the division**: Divide 7 by 33. Since 33 is larger than 7, we add a decimal point and append zeros to 7, making it 7.000000.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - 33 goes into 70 twice (2 × 33 = 66), subtracting 66 from 70 leaves a remainder of 4.
   - Bring down the next 0, making it 40. 33 goes into 40 once (1 × 33 = 33), subtracting 33 leaves a remainder of 7.
   - Bring down the next 0, making it 70 again.

3. **Identify the repeating pattern**: The remainder 70 repeats, indicating that the decimal repeats from this point.

4. **Result**: The decimal representation of \( \frac{7}{33} \) is \( 0.\overline{21} \), where "21" repeats indefinitely.

From the given options, the correct choice is **D: 0.21 Repeating**.
