Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about a free particle that's initially at rest. They give the mass, the force applied, and the time for which the force is applied. I need to find the kinetic energy acquired after that time.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when a force is applied to an object, it accelerates the object according to Newton's second law. Newton's second law is F = ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.

Wait, the mass is given in grams. Oh right, 20 grams. I think I need to convert that to kilograms or maybe just keep it in grams since the force is in dynes. Oh, because in the CGS system, mass is in grams, force in dynes, and acceleration comes out in cm/s². Yeah, that makes sense.

So the force F is 100 dynes, mass m is 20 grams. Let me write that down: F = 100 dynes, m = 20 g.

Using F = ma, I can solve for acceleration a. So a = F/m. That would be 100 dynes divided by 20 grams. Let me calculate that: 100/20 is 5. So a is 5 cm/s². Wait, because in CGS units, 1 dyne = 1 g·cm/s². So yeah, the units work out.

Now, the force is applied for a time of 10 seconds. So the time t is 10 s. I think I can find the velocity after this time using the equation of motion. Since the particle starts from rest, the initial velocity u is 0.

The equation I remember is v = u + at. Since u is zero, v = a*t. So v = 5 cm/s² * 10 s = 50 cm/s. That's 50 cm/s.

Wait, but I need to find the kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So I have the mass and velocity now.

But wait, the mass is in grams and velocity in cm/s. Let me make sure about the units. In CGS, 1 erg is the unit of energy, which is 1 g·cm²/s². So when I compute (1/2)mv², it should give me ergs.

So plugging in the numbers: (1/2) * 20 g * (50 cm/s)^2. Let's compute that step by step.

First, 50 squared is 2500. Then 20 * 2500 is 50,000. Multiply by 1/2 gives 25,000. So the kinetic energy is 25,000 ergs.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 25,000 ergs. So that's the answer.

But wait a second, did I make any mistake in calculations? Let me double-check. Mass is 20g, force 100 dynes. a=F/m=5 cm/s². Time 10s gives v=50 cm/s. KE = 0.5 *20*(50)^2=0.5*20*2500=0.5*50,000=25,000 ergs. Yep, that's correct.

To determine the kinetic energy acquired by the particle, we start by analyzing the given data:

- Mass of the particle: \( m = 20 \, \text{g} \)
- Force applied: \( F = 100 \, \text{dynes} \)
- Time of force application: \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \)

Using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), the acceleration \( a \) can be calculated as:

\[
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{100 \, \text{dynes}}{20 \, \text{g}} = 5 \, \text{cm/s}^2
\]

Next, the final velocity \( v \) of the particle after 10 seconds can be found using the equation of motion:

\[
v = u + at
\]

Since the particle starts from rest (\( u = 0 \)), this simplifies to:

\[
v = a \cdot t = 5 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \cdot 10 \, \text{s} = 50 \, \text{cm/s}
\]

The kinetic energy \( KE \) is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \, \text{g} \cdot (50 \, \text{cm/s})^2
\]

First, calculate \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = 50^2 = 2500 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Then, calculate \( m \cdot v^2 \):

\[
m \cdot v^2 = 20 \cdot 2500 = 50,000 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 50,000 = 25,000 \, \text{ergs}
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy acquired by the particle is \( 25,000 \, \text{ergs} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
