Okay, so I've got this gas problem here. Let's see... The question is about a gaseous sample of neon. It says that it's maintained at a constant temperature, so I remember that when temperature is constant, the pressure and volume of a gas are related by Boyle's Law. Boyle's Law is PV = k, where P is pressure and V is volume, and k is a constant.

The initial conditions given are a volume of 500 ml at a pressure of 2.00 atm. Wait, but I should probably convert milliliters to liters because the answer options are in liters. So 500 ml is 0.5 liters, right?

So initially, P1 is 2.00 atm and V1 is 0.5 L. Now, the question asks what the volume will be under three different new pressures. Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a), where the pressure changes to 4.00 atm. Since temperature is constant, I can set up the equation using Boyle's Law:

P1 * V1 = P2 * V2

Plugging in the numbers:
2.00 atm * 0.5 L = 4.00 atm * V2

Let me calculate that. 2 times 0.5 is 1, and that equals 4 times V2. So V2 = 1 / 4 = 0.25 L. So the new volume is 0.25 liters.

Moving on to part (b), the pressure is 760 torr. Hmm, I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr. So 760 torr is equal to 1 atm. So P2 is 1 atm.

Again using Boyle's Law:

P1 * V1 = P2 * V2

So 2.00 atm * 0.5 L = 1 atm * V2.

Calculating that, 2 * 0.5 is 1. So 1 = V2. So V2 is 1 liter.

Wait, but let me double-check the units. Since the initial pressure is in atm and the new pressure is in torr, but since they're the same in value (760 torr = 1 atm), the units cancel out correctly. So yes, that seems right.

Now part (c) is a bit trickier. The pressure is 1.8 × 10^-3 torr. I need to convert that to atm to keep the units consistent because the initial pressure is in atm.

I know that 1 atm = 760 torr. So to convert torr to atm, I divide by 760.

So P2 = 1.8e-3 torr / 760 torr/atm.

Let me compute that. 1.8e-3 divided by 760. Let's see, 1.8 / 760 is approximately 0.002368, then times 1e-3, so 2.368e-6 atm.

Now, using Boyle's Law again:

P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

So 2.00 atm * 0.5 L = (1.8e-3 /760) atm * V2.

Let me compute P2 first. 1.8e-3 /760 = approximately 2.368e-6 atm.

So the equation becomes: 1 atm*L = 2.368e-6 atm * V2.

Wait, 2.00 * 0.5 is 1. So 1 = (2.368e-6) * V2.

Solving for V2: V2 = 1 / (2.368e-6) liters.

Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 2.368e-6 is approximately 422,222 liters? Wait, that seems too big. Let me double-check.

Wait, 2.368e-6 is 0.000002368. So 1 divided by that is 1 / 0.000002368 = 422,222 liters? Hmm. Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are in the range of 1e5 to 1e6 liters.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate.

Compute 1.8e-3 /760.

1.8e-3 is 0.0018. 0.0018 /760 = 0.0018 / 7.6e2 = (1.8 / 760) )e-3.

Wait, 1.8 divided by 760: 760 is 7.6e2, so 1.8 /7.6e2 = (1.8/7.6) *1e-2.

1.8 /7.6 is approximately 0.2368. So 0.2368e-2 which is 2.368e-3 atm? Wait, no: 0.2368e-2 is 2.368e-3. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe better to compute 1.8e-3 divided by 760.

1.8e-3 is 0.0018. 0.0018 /760 = ?

Let me compute 0.0018 /760.

760 is 7.6e2. 0.0018 /7.6e2 = (0.0018 /7.6) ) *1e-2.

0.0018 /7.6 = approximately 0.0002368.

Multiply by 1e-2 gives 0.000002368, which is 2.368e-6 atm.

So P2 is 2.368e-6 atm.

So P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So 2.00 atm * 0.5 L = (2.368e-6 atm) * V2.

So 1.00 = 2.368e-6 * V2.

V2 = 1 / (2.368e-6) liters.

1 divided by 2.368e-6 is approximately 422,222 liters, which is 4.222e5 liters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none have 4.2e5. Let's see:

Looking through the options:

Option A: (c) 1.11e6 l

Option B: (c) 2.17e5 l

Option C: (c) 1.09e6 l

Option E: (c) 4.35e5 l

Option I: (c) 2.17e5 l

Wait, my calculation is approximately 4.22e5 liters, which is 422,222 liters. But none of the options exactly match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1/(1.8e-3 /760) * (P1 V1)/(P2) ?

Wait, no. Let me reapproach.

From P1V1 = P2 V2.

V2= (P1 / P2) * V1.

So P1 is 2.00 atm, P2 is 1.8e-3 torr = 1.8e-3 /760 atm.

So P1/P2 = 2 / (1.8e-3 /760 ) = 2 * 760 / 1.8e-3.

Calculate that:

2 *760 = 1520.

1520 / 1.8e-3 = 1520 / 0.0018.

Hmm, 1520 divided by 0.0018.

Well, 0.0018 is 1.8e-3, so 1520 / 1.8e-3 = 1520 * (1 / 1.8e-3) ) = 1520 * (5.555e2) ) approximately.

Wait, 1/1.8 is about 0.5555, so 1/1.8e-3 is 0.5555e3 = 555.555... So 1520 * 555.555 ≈ Let's compute 1520 * 555.555.

Wait, that's a big number. Let's see:

1520 * 500 is 760,000.

1520 * 55.555 is approximately 1520 * 55 = 83,600 (since 55 is 55.555 rounded down). So total is 760,000 +83,600 = 843,600. So approximately 8.436e5 liters.

Wait, that's 843,600 liters. But I thought earlier it was ~422,222. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

V2 = (P1 * V1) / P2.

P1 is 2 atm, V1 is 0.5 L.

P2 is 1.8e-3 torr. So in atm, that's 1.8e-3 /760 atm.

So:

V2 = (2 atm * 0.5 L) / ( (1.8e-3 torr) /760 torr/atm ) )

The torr units cancel, so:

V2 = (1 L atm) / (1.8e-3 /760 atm) )

The atm units cancel, so:

V2 = 1 / (1.8e-3 /760) liters.

Which is 760 / 1.8e-3 liters.

760 / 1.8 is approximately 422.222, and 1e-3 is 0.001, so 422.222 / 0.001 = 422222 liters.

So V2 is approximately 422,222 liters, which is 4.222e5 liters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E, which for part (c) is 4.35e5 l. Hmm. But why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I should calculate the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 760 / 1.8e-3.

Wait, 760 divided by 1.8e-3.

760 / 1.8 = 422.222..., so 422.222... / 1e-3 = 422.222... * 1e3 = 422,222.222 liters.

Which is 4.222e5 liters.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: (c) 4.35 × 10^5 l.

That's 435,000 liters. Hmm, but I got approximately 422,222.

None of the options match that exactly. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, the initial calculation: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

P1 =2 atm, V1=0.5 L.

P2= 1.8e-3 torr = 1.8e-3 /760 atm.

So V2 = (2 * 0.5) / (1.8e-3 /760 ) = 1 / (2.368e-6) = approx 422,222 L.

Looking at the options, option E's part (c) is 4.35e5, which is 435,000. Difference of about 13,000. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me make sure.

1.8e-3 torr to atm: 1 torr = 1/760 atm. So 1.8e-3 torr = 1.8e-3 * (1/760) atm.

Which is 1.8e-3 /760 = 2.368e-6 atm.

So V2 = (2 * 0.5) / (2.368e-6 ) = 1 / 2.368e-6 ≈ 422,222 L.

Which is 4.222e5 L.

Looking at the options, the only one close is option E's 4.35e5.

Wait, but why is there a difference? Maybe I should compute 1/(1.8e-3 /760) exactly.

Compute P2 in atm: 1.8e-3 /760 = 0.002368421 atm.

Wait, wait, no. 1.8e-3 is 0.0018. 0.0018 /760 is 0.000002368421.

So P2 is 0.000002368421 atm.

So V2 = (2 * 0.5) / 0.000002368421 = 1 / 0.000002368421 ≈ 422222 liters.

So 422,222 liters is 4.222e5 liters. So none of the options exactly match. The closest is option E, which is 4.35e5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation intended to use different rounding.

Wait, let me compute 1.8e-3 /760 more accurately.

1.8e-3 is 0.0018.

0.0018 divided by 760: 0.0018 / 760 = approximately 0.000002368421.

Then 1 / 0.000002368421 = approx 422222.222 liters.

Now, looking at the options:

Option E: (c) 4.35 × 10^5 l.

Wait, 4.35e5 is 435,000, which is about 13,000 more than our calculated value. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial pressure is 2.00 atm, and the volume is 500 ml, but I converted that to 0.5 liters correctly. Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute 1.8 ÷ 760.

1.8 /760 = 0.0023684210526.

So 1.8e-3 /760 = 0.0023684210526e-3 = 2.3684210526e-6 atm.

So 1 / 2.3684210526e-6 = 422222.222 liters.

So 422,222 liters. Now, looking at the options, none of them have exactly that.

Looking again at the options:

Option C's part (c) is 1.09e6 l.

Option I's part (c) is 2.17e5 l.

Option E's part (c) is 4.35e5 l.

Hmm. 4.35e5 is 435,000, which is off by about 12,778 liters.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, the pressure is changing to 1.8e-3 torr. Since the gas is expanding when pressure decreases, the volume should be larger. So in our calculation, the volume is much larger than the initial 0.5 liters.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: (a) 0.25 l, (b) 1.00 l, (c) 4.35e5 l.

That would fit parts a and b correctly as 0.25 and 1.00 l.

So if part (c) is 4.35e5, but our calculation gives 4.22e5, which is close but not exact. Maybe it's due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute using exact fractional values.

Let me compute P2 as 1.8e-3 torr = 1.8e-3 /760 atm.

So 1.8e-3 /760 = 1.8/(760 * 1e3) ) atm.

Wait, 1.8e-3 is 1.8 * 1e-3. So 1.8/(760 * 1e3) is 1.8/(760000) = 0.000002368421.

Then V2 = (2.00 atm * 0.5 L) / 0.000002368421 atm.

So V2 = (1) / 0.000002368421 = 422222.222 liters.

So 4.222e5 liters.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. But option E's part (c) is 4.35e5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation used 1.8e-3 /760 = approximately 2.3e-6 instead. Let me see.

If I approximate 1.8e-3 /760 as roughly 2.3e-6, then V2 would be 1/(2.3e-6) ≈ 434782.61 liters, which is approximately 4.35e5 liters. That would match option E.

Ah, I see. So perhaps the intended solution rounded 1.8e-3 /760 to 2.3e-6, leading to 4.35e5 liters. So perhaps the correct answer is option E.

But let me check the other parts again to see which options fit.

In part (a), option E's (a) is 0.25 L, which matches our calculation.

In part (b), option E's (b) is 1.00 L, which also matches.

So if part (c) is 4.35e5, which is option E, that would make sense.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recompute the exact value without rounding.

Compute 1.8e-3 torr to atm:

1.8e-3 /760 = 0.002368421 atm.

Wait, no, wait. 1.8e-3 is 0.0018, so 0.0018 /760 is 0.000002368421.

So 1/0.000002368421 = 422222.222 liters.

Hmm, but when I compute 1.8e-3 /760 exactly:

1.8e-3 = 0.0018.

0.0018 / 760 = 0.000002368421052631578947.

So the reciprocal is 1/0.000002368421052631578947 ≈ 422222.222 liters.

So that's 4.222e5 liters.

But none of the options have that. The closest is option E's 4.35e5.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to keep more precise numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pressure is given in torr, and the initial pressure in atm. So perhaps I should convert the initial pressure to torr as well.

Wait, let me try that.

Initial pressure P1 is 2.00 atm. Converted to torr, that's 2.00 * 760 = 1520 torr.

So P1 = 1520 torr, V1=0.5 L.

Then, for part (c),
