Question:

A 17-year-old boy was jostling with his 12-year-old brother. A pedestrian witnessed the boy shoving his brother and mistakenly believed that they were fighting. Acting as a Good Samaritan, the pedestrian approached the boys and tried to intercede. The boy stumbled and accidentally fell into the pedestrian, knocking him to the ground. The pedestrian broke his arm as a result of the fall. If the pedestrian sues the boy to recover damages for his injury, he should

Options:

A: prevail, because the pedestrian reasonably believed that the boy was about to injure his brother.
B: prevail, based upon the doctrine of transferred intent.
C: not prevail, because the pedestrian assumed the risk.
D: not prevail, unless the boy was negligent.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about tort law, specifically negligence and possibly other doctrines like transferred intent or assumption of risk. 

The scenario is this: a 17-year-old boy is jostling with his 12-year-old brother. A pedestrian sees this and thinks they're fighting, so he tries to intercede. The boy stumbles, accidentally falls into the pedestrian, and the pedestrian breaks his arm.

The pedestrian is suing the boy for damages. So, the question is whether the pedestrian will prevail.

First, I need to think about what the possible causes of action here are. The pedestrian is likely suing for some form of tort. The main ones could be negligence, battery, or maybe something else.

Let's consider negligence first. For negligence, the pedestrian must prove that the boy owed him a duty of care, breached that duty, which caused his injury, and actual damages. So, did the boy act unreasonably? He was jostling with his brother, which seems like horseplay. Then when the pedestrian approached, he stumbled and fell into him. So, the boy's movement was accidental. The question is whether this action constitutes negligence.

I think that in this case, the boy didn't intend to harm the pedestrian. It was an accident. So, the boy might not have been negligent. Unless his action of shoving his brother was so reckless that it created a foreseeable risk to others nearby. But the facts don't specify that the boy was acting in a way that a reasonable person would foresee a risk to a third party. It was just jostling with his brother, which is pretty common among siblings. So, maybe the boy wasn't negligent.

Alternatively, could this be a case of transferred intent? Transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to commit a tort against one person, but the act affects a different person. For example, if person A throws a rock at B, but misses and hits C, then A is liable to C under transferred intent for battery. But in this case, the boy didn't intend any harm towards the pedestrian. The contact with the pedestrian was accidental. So, transferred intent doesn't apply here because there was no intent to harm anyone. The boy wasn't trying to push the pedestrian; it was an accident.

What about assumption of risk? The pedestrian voluntarily approached the situation, thinking the boys were fighting. He tried to intercede, which is a voluntary act. By inserting himself into a situation he perceived as a fight, he might have assumed the risk of potential harm. Assumption of risk can be a defense if the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily assumed the risk of injury. So, the pedestrian knew that intervening in a fight could be dangerous, so he might have assumed that risk.

Wait, but assumption of risk is more about the plaintiff's knowledge and voluntary assumption. Did the pedestrian here assume the risk? He thought they were fighting and tried to help. So, perhaps he did assume some risk. But I'm not entirely sure how strong that defense is here.

Let me think again about negligence. If the boy was not negligent, then even if the pedestrian was injured, there's no liability. The question is whether the boy breached a duty of care. If the boy's actions were not unreasonable, then no breach, so no negligence.

So, in this case, the boy was just horsing around with his brother, not acting with any intent to harm the pedestrian. The collision was accidental. So, unless the boy was acting recklessly, which I don't think is the case here, he wasn't negligent.

So, the pedestrian's claim would likely fail because the boy wasn't negligent. Therefore, the pedestrian wouldn't prevail unless the boy was negligent, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Looking at the options:

A: Prevail because pedestrian reasonably believed they were fighting. But reasonable belief doesn't make the boy liable unless the boy was actually negligent or committing a tort.

B: Prevail based on transferred intent. But no intent here, so B is wrong.

C: Not prevail because pedestrian assumed the risk. This could be a possible answer, but I'm not sure if assumption of risk applies here as a complete defense.

D: Not prevail unless the boy was negligent. So, if the boy wasn't negligent, pedestrian doesn't win. So, D seems correct.

Wait, but I thought C could also be a consideration. So, maybe the correct answer is D because the boy wasn't negligent, so the pedestrian can't recover unless negligence is shown. Alternatively, if the pedestrian assumed the risk, that would also prevent recovery.

But I think the primary issue is whether the boy was negligent. If he wasn't, then the pedestrian can't recover. So, D is the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the pedestrian can recover damages from the 17-year-old boy after accidentally being knocked down during an attempted intervention in a perceived fight. The key legal issues are negligence, transferred intent, and assumption of risk.

1. **Negligence**: For the pedestrian to prevail, they must show that the boy breached a duty of care, causing the injury. The boy was jostling with his brother, which is typical sibling behavior, and the collision with the pedestrian was accidental. There is no indication that the boy acted recklessly or in a way that a reasonable person would foresee harm to a third party. Therefore, the boy likely was not negligent.

2. **Transferred Intent**: This doctrine applies when the defendant intends to harm one person but inadvertently harms another. Here, the boy had no intent to harm the pedestrian, so transferred intent does not apply.

3. **Assumption of Risk**: The pedestrian voluntarily intervened in a situation they perceived as a fight, which carries inherent risks. By doing so, they might have assumed the risk of harm. While this could be a defense, the stronger argument is that the boy was not negligent in the first place.

Since the boy's actions do not constitute negligence, the pedestrian cannot recover damages unless negligence is proven. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: not prevail, unless the boy was negligent.**
