Okay, so I have this economics problem here about supply and demand. Let's see, the question is about what happens when both the demand for grapes increases and the supply of grapes increases at the same time. Hmm, I remember that changes in demand and supply can affect the equilibrium point, which is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

So, I think I need to draw a graph or at least visualize it in my head. Demand increasing would shift the demand curve to the right, right? Because at every price point, people want to buy more grapes. Supply increasing means the supply curve shifts to the right as well, because producers are willing to supply more grapes at each price.

Wait, but how do these shifts affect the equilibrium quantity and price? I remember that if only demand increases, the equilibrium quantity increases and price might rise because more people want the product. But if only supply increases, the equilibrium quantity increases and the price might fall because there's more supply than before, so sellers might lower prices to sell more.

But here, both are increasing. So the two shifts are happening in the same direction. I think the key here is to figure out which factor is stronger. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the shifts are equal or not. So maybe that's why the answer is ambiguous in some way.

Wait, in this case, both shifts are to the right. So the new equilibrium would depend on how much each curve shifts. For example, if demand increases by a lot and supply increases by a little, the equilibrium price might rise, and quantity definitely increases. Conversely, if supply increases by a lot and demand only a little, the price might fall, but quantity would still increase.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. If both demand and supply increase, the quantity will definitely increase because both shifts lead to more being supplied and demanded. But the effect on price isn't clear because it depends on which shift is bigger.

So, the equilibrium quantity definitely rises because both shifts push it up. But what about the price? If the supply increases more than demand, prices might fall. If demand increases more than supply, prices might rise. Since the question states that both are increasing, but doesn't say by how much, the price could go either way. So the change in price is ambiguous.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where quantity rises but price is ambiguous. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Quantity rises, price rises. No, because price might not rise.
Option B: Quantity rises, price change ambiguous. That sounds right.
Option C: Quantity same, price rises. No, because quantity should increase.
Option H: Quantity rises, price falls. No, because it could go either way.
Other options don't fit as well.

So the correct answer must be option B: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.

When both the demand for grapes and the supply of grapes increase, the equilibrium quantity will rise because both shifts in the curves lead to an increase in the quantity exchanged. However, the effect on the equilibrium price is ambiguous. This ambiguity arises because the direction of the price change depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts in demand and supply. If demand increases more significantly than supply, the price may rise. Conversely, if supply increases more than demand, the price may fall. Since the problem does not specify the extent of these shifts, the price change cannot be definitively determined.

The correct answer is:

B: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.

Answer: B
