Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through carefully.

So the question is about finding the maximum effective aperture of a short dipole. The given radiation resistance is R_r = sqrt(μ0/ε0) * (βl)^2 / (6π) ohms. Hmm, I remember that radiation resistance is the resistance that a dipole antenna presents to the transmitter, and it's related to how much power it radiates.

Wait, I think the radiation resistance for a short dipole (where the length is much smaller than the wavelength) is usually given by R_r = (η * (k l)^2) / (6π), where η is the intrinsic impedance of free space, and k is the wave number. Oh right, because η is sqrt(μ0/ε0), so that matches the given formula. So β is probably the wave number, which is 2π/λ. So β l would be (2π l)/λ. Squaring that gives (4π² l²)/λ². So substituting back, R_r would be η * (4π² l²)/(λ² * 6π) ) = (η * (2 π l²) )/(3 λ²).

But wait, the question isn't about R_r, it's about the maximum effective aperture. Right, effective aperture is the measure of how well an antenna can capture the power from an incoming wave. The maximum effective aperture (A_em) is related to the gain (G) of the antenna by the formula A_em = (λ² G)/(4π). 

Wait, no, isn't it A_em = (G * λ²)/(4π)? Yes, that sounds right. So I need to find the gain of the dipole antenna to compute the effective aperture.

For a short dipole, the gain is typically around 1.5 or 3/2. I think that's correct because a dipole has a gain of about 1.5 compared to an isotropic radiator. So G ≈ 1.5.

Putting it together, A_em = (1.5 * λ²) / (4π) = (3/2) * λ²/(4π) ) = (3 λ²) / (8 π). Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, 3/(8π) is approximately 3/(25.1327) ≈ 0.1194. So A_em ≈ 0.1194 λ². Looking at the options, option C is 0.119 λ², which matches this.

Wait a second, but I want to make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Another approach could be using the relation between radiation resistance and antenna gain. I think there's a formula that relates the effective aperture to the radiation resistance. Let me think.

The effective aperture A_em is also related to the radiation resistance R_r by the formula A_em = (R_r * λ²)/(4π). Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Because I know that the maximum effective aperture for a dipole is about 0.119 λ², which matches option C. But let me confirm the correct formula.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the effective aperture A_e is related to the directivity D by A_e = (D λ²)/(4π). Since for a dipole, D is 1.5, then A_e would be (1.5 * λ²)/(4π) which is approximately 0.119 λ². That's consistent with what I found before.

So I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is option C: 0.119 λ² square meters.

To determine the maximum effective aperture \( A_{\text{em}} \) of a short dipole, we start by recalling the relationship between the effective aperture and the gain \( G \) of the antenna. The formula is:

\[
A_{\text{em}} = \frac{G \lambda^2}{4\pi}
\]

For a short dipole, the gain \( G \) is approximately \( 1.5 \) (or \( 3/2 \)). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
A_{\text{em}} = \frac{1.5 \lambda^2}{4\pi}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
A_{\text{em}} = \frac{3 \lambda^2}{8\pi}
\]

Now, compute the numerical value of \( \frac{3}{8\pi} \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \), we find:

\[
\frac{3}{8\pi} \approx \frac{3}{25.1328} \approx 0.1194
\]

Thus, the maximum effective aperture is approximately:

\[
A_{\text{em}} \approx 0.119 \lambda^2 \, \text{square meters}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 0.119 \( \lambda^2 \) square meters**
