Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the endurance limit for a steel rod. Hmm, endurance limit is the stress that a material can withstand for a certain number of cycles without failing, right? I remember that for steels, the endurance limit is usually a key factor in fatigue design.

The question gives me a 1.75-inch diameter AISI-C1030 steel rod, and it's as rolled. They want the endurance limit for 95% reliability. Oh wait, I think the endurance limit varies based on factors like material condition, size, and reliability.

I remember there's a standard endurance limit for certain materials. For steels, if the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is known, the endurance limit can be estimated. I think for steels with UTS below 140,000 psi (around 965 MPa), the endurance limit is about half the UTS. But wait, for higher UTS, it's lower than half. Oh right, the endurance limit for steels is typically around 0.5 * UTS when UTS is below 140,000 psi, and it's lower beyond that.

Wait, but I'm not sure of the exact UTS for AISI C1030. Oh wait, C1030 is a type of steel. Let me think. C1030 is a medium-carbon steel, and I think its UTS is around 75,000 to 90,000 psi. Oh wait, maybe it's about 85,000 psi? Or wait, I might have that mixed up. Another approach: maybe the standard endurance limit is provided in some formula or table.

Alternatively, I remember a formula where the endurance limit (S_e) can be calculated using the equation S_e = S_e' * (K_a) * (K_b) * (K_c) * (K_d) * (K_e), where these K factors are for different conditions like reliability, size, surface finish, temperature, and others.

Wait, but for this problem, maybe we're supposed to use the standard endurance limit for the material and then adjust it with the modifying factors.

The standard endurance limit (S_e') is the value for a polished specimen under rotating bending. For steels, if the UTS is known, S_e' is roughly 0.5 * UTS for UTS ≤ 200,000 psi. Wait, no, I think the endurance limit is 0.5 * UTS for UTS up to 140,000 psi, but for higher UTS, it's lower. Wait, maybe I should look up the values. Alternatively, I think that for C1030 steel, the endurance limit is around 30,000 psi, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options provided are in the 16k to 35k psi range. Hmm, let me try to work through this.

First, determine the standard endurance limit for the material. If UTS is 75,000 psi, then Se' would be 0.5 * 75,000 = 37,500 psi. But wait, that's over 35k, which is one of the options. But wait, the actual Se would be adjusted by factors like size, surface finish, etc.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: The endurance limit for steels is sometimes given as 1/4 of the UTS for certain conditions, but that might be for different factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard endurance limit for AISI C1030 as rolled is known. I think as rolled materials have lower endurance limits than when they're polished. For example, the surface finish can reduce the endurance limit because as-rolled surfaces have more imperfections which act as stress concentrators.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the process step by step.

1. Find the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of AISI C1030.
2. Determine the standard endurance limit (unnotched, rotating bending) based on UTS.
3. Apply the modifying factors for size, surface finish, reliability, etc.

I think for AISI C1030 steel, the UTS is about 75,000 psi. So S_e' (standard endurance limit) would be 0.5 * UTS = 37,500 psi. But that's for a polished specimen, which is better than as-rolled.

Wait, but the as-rolled surface finish is rougher, so the surface factor (K_a) would be less than 1. I remember that surface finish can lower the endurance limit. For example, a machined surface might have a K_a of 0.8, whereas as-rolled might be lower, like 0.7 or so.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the factors:

- Surface finish factor (K_a): depends on the condition. For a polished surface, K_a is 1. For as-rolled, maybe it's 0.3 or something else? Wait, no, I think for as-rolled, the factor is around 0.3, but that might be for specific cases.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the standard factors. Let me try to remember them. The surface finish factor K_a is determined based on the material's surface roughness. For example, if the material is as-forged or as-cast, K_a is lower than for a polished or machined surface.

An alternative approach is to use the formula for the endurance limit:

S_e = S_e' * K_a * K_b * K_c * K_d * K_e

Where:
- S_e' = unnotched endurance limit (for polished, rotating bending)
- K_a = surface factor (depends on surface roughness)
- K_b = size factor (depends on the part's diameter)
- K_c = reliability factor (for 95% reliability)
- K_d = temperature factor (assuming room temp here)
- K_e = other factors (like stress concentration), maybe ignored here.

So let's break it down.

First, find S_e' for C1030.

If UTS is 75,000 psi, then S_e' is 0.5 * UTS = 37,500 psi.

Wait, but if UTS is higher than 140,000 psi, the endurance limit is lower than 0.5. But 75,000 is below 140,000, so 0.5 applies.

Next, surface factor (K_a). As-rolled surface finish: I think for a machined surface, K_a is about 0.8, but as-rolled is rougher. I'm a bit unsure, but I think the surface factor for as-rolled is 0.3. Wait, that seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps K_a is 0.58 for as-rolled. Maybe I'm mixing up the factors. Alternatively, I might have to refer to a table.

I think the surface factor K_a depends on the material's condition. From memory, for steels:

- Mirror-like polished: K_a = 1.0
- Machined: K_a = 0.9
- Hot rolled: K_a = 0.58
- As-forged: K_a = 0.35
- As-cast: K_a = 0.3

Wait, I'm not certain, but perhaps hot rolled (as-rolled) has K_a around 0.6 or 0.58.

Then, size factor (K_b). The formula for size factor is K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.127) where d is diameter in inches, for d > 0.3 inches. Wait, no, another formula. Or perhaps, for rotating bending, the size factor is given by K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.3). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the size factor is based on the diameter. For a rod with diameter d, if d is less than 0.3 inches, K_b is 1. For d between 0.3 and 2.0 inches, K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.3 + 0.006*(d in inches)) )? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula is K_b = 1.0 for d ≤ 0.3 in, and for d > 0.3 in, K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.3 + 0.006 d). Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the size factor K_b is calculated as:

For d ≤ 0.3 in: K_b = 1.0

For 0.3 < d ≤ 2.0 in: K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.3 + 0.006 d)

Wait, no, perhaps it's K_b = 1.0 for d ≤ 0.3 inches, and K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.3) for d between 0.3 and 2.0 inches.

Wait, another approach: for bending or torsion, the size factor is given by:

For d ≤ 0.3 in: K_b = 1.0

For d > 0.3 in: K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.3)

So for d in inches, our rod is 1.75 inches.

So K_b = (1.75/0.3)^(-0.3) = (5.833)^(-0.3)

Let me calculate that. 5.833^0.3 is about e^(0.3 * ln(5.833)).

ln(5.833) is about 1.7627. Multiply by 0.3: 0.5288.

So e^0.5288 is about 1.697.

So 5.833^0.3 is approximately 1.697, so 1/K_b is 1.697, thus K_b is 1/1.697 ≈ 0.589.

So K_b ≈ 0.589.

Next, reliability factor (K_c). For 95% reliability, K_c is 0.87. Because, if I recall, the reliability factor varies: for 50% reliability, K_c is 1.0; for 90%, it's 0.95; for 95%, 0.87; 99%, 0.75. Wait, but I might have those numbers mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the factors are as follows: 100% R is K_c=1, 99% is 0.97, 95% is 0.87, 90% is 0.84, and 50% is 0.7. I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe for 95% reliability, K_c is 0.87.

Wait, another source I recall says that for 95% reliability, K_c is 0.87. So I'll go with that for now.

Temperature factor (K_d): assuming room temperature, K_d=1.0. So that doesn't affect the calculation.

Other factors (K_e): perhaps we can ignore them as per the problem statement, so K_e=1.0.

Putting it all together:

S_e = S_e' * K_a * K_b * K_c * K_d * K_e

We have:

S_e' = 37,500 psi
K_a = 0.58 (as-rolled)
K_b = 0.589
K_c = 0.87
K_d = 1.0
K_e = 1.0

Calculating:

S_e = 37,500 * 0.58 * 0.589 * 0.87

Let me compute step by step.

First, 37,500 * 0.58 = 21,750 psi

Then, 21,750 * 0.589 = let's compute 21,750 * 0.5 =10,875; 21,750 * 0.08=1,740; 21,750 *0.009=195.75. Adding together: 10,875 + 1,740 = 12,615 +195.75=12,810.75 psi.

Then, 12,810.75 * 0.87: compute 12,810.75 *0.8 =10,248.6, 12,810.75 *0.07= 896.75. Sum: 10,248.6 + 896.75=11,145.35 psi.

Wait, but this gives S_e as about 11,145 psi. Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 16.3 ×10^3 psi, but 11k is not among the options. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the factors.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the surface factor. Because as-rolled might have a higher K_a than I thought. Let me reevaluate. Maybe the surface factor K_a for as-rolled is 0.3? Wait, that would make the Se even lower, which would make it even less likely to match any of the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface factor for as-rolled is higher than 0.58. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing surface factors for bending versus axial loading. Wait, in the formulas, the surface factors can vary based on the type of loading. For example, rotating bending versus axial loading. Maybe the K_a for axial loading is different.

Wait, but the standard endurance limit S_e' is for rotating bending. So when applying factors, perhaps the surface factor is applied based on the loading type.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the axial loading factors. Let me think. Hmm, maybe I should look up the surface factor for axial loading. Oh wait, I'm getting stuck because I can't recall the exact factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong UTS. If the UTS for C1030 is lower, say around 60,000 psi, then S_e' would be 30,000 psi.

Wait, let me double-check the UTS for C1030. I think C1030 has a UTS of about 75,000 to 85,000 psi. Let's say 75,000 psi. Then S_e' is 37,500 psi.

Wait, but in that case, with the same factors, I got 11,145 psi, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the size factor. Let me recalculate K_b.

Wait, another approach: the size factor for bending is given by K_b = (d/0.3)^(-0.3). So for d=1.75 in, K_b = (1.75/0.3)^(-0.3).

1.75 /0.3 ≈5.8333.

5.8333^(0.3) is approximately e^(0.3 * ln(5.8333)).

ln(5.8333)=1.76274.

0.3 * 1.76274=0.5288.

e^0.5288≈1.697.

So 5.8333^0.3≈1.697, so K_b=1/1.697≈0.589.

That part seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is with the surface factor. Maybe for as-rolled, K_a is 0.3.

Wait, let me think again. I might have the surface factors wrong. I think for a machined surface, K_a is around 0.8. For as-rolled, perhaps it's lower. Let's say K_a=0.3.

Then S_e would be 37,500 *0.3*0.589*0.87.

Compute step by step:

37,500 *0.3=11,250.

11,250 *0.589 ≈6,636.75.

6,636.75 *0.87≈5,774 psi. That's even lower, so it's worse.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the endurance limit is given by a different formula. Oh wait, another formula I've heard is the endurance limit Se = 0.5 * UTS * (for 95% reliability), but that doesn't account for size or surface finish.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the basic endurance limit is 30,000 psi for C1030 as-rolled, and then adjusted for reliability.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 22.8e3, option B is 27.9e3, option F is 30.2e3.

If I take Se' as 37,500 psi, and apply K_a=0.6, K_b=0.589, K_c=0.87.

Then:

37,500 *0.6=22,500.

22,500 *0.589≈13,252.5.

13,252.5 *0.87≈11,530 psi.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the surface factor is higher. Suppose K_a=0.7.

Then:

37,500 *0.7=26,250.

26,250 *0.589≈15,486.25.

15,486.25 *0.87≈13,450 psi.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the surface factor for as-rolled is 0.58, which I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I should try K_a=0.58.

So 37,500 *0.58=21,750.

21,750 *0.589≈12,810.75.

12,810.75 *0.87≈11,145 psi.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the UTS is lower. Suppose the UTS is 60,000 psi. Then Se'=30,000 psi.

Now, with K_a=0.58, K_b=0.589, K_c=0.87.

30,000 *0.58=17,400.

17,400 *0.589≈10,236.

10,236 *0.87≈8,900 psi. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the endurance limit isn't based on 0.5 * UTS. Maybe for C1030 as-rolled, the endurance limit is given differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the endurance limit is Se= (UTS * K_a * K_b * K_c) / something.

Wait, maybe I should look up a different approach. Oh, I remember that the endurance limit can be calculated using the formula Se = (UTS * (K_a) * (K_b) * (K_c)).

Wait, but that's similar to what I did earlier. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the standard endurance limit is given as Se' = 0.5 UTS, but for as-rolled, it's Se' = 0.4 UTS. Or perhaps it's lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the AISC or another standard for endurance limits. But without that, I'm stuck.

Wait, another thought: the endurance limit for AISI 1030 (
