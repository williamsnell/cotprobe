Okay, so I've got this problem about silyl radicals and their ESR splitting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says that a silyl radical has a g value of 2.0033, and there's a pair of lines separated by 15.5 MHz. I need to express this splitting in mT, Gauss, and cm^-1. The options are A through J, each listing these three units.

Wait, from what I remember, in ESR spectroscopy, the splitting between lines is related to the hyperfine coupling constant. Oh right, the separation is given in terms of frequency, but we often convert it to magnetic field units. Oh, right, because the energy levels depend on the magnetic field.

So the formula I think involves the relationship between the frequency separation and the magnetic field. The basic equation is ΔE = g * μ_B * B, where ΔE is the energy difference, g is the g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and B is the magnetic field.

Wait, but wait. The energy can also be expressed as ΔE = h * ν, where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency. So setting these equal: hν = g μ_B B. So solving for B gives B = hν / (g μ_B).

Hmm, yeah, that sounds right. So I can use that to find B in Tesla, then convert to mT or Gauss.

Let me jot down the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T. The g value given is 2.0033.

The frequency ν is 15.5 MHz. Oh wait, MHz is megahertz, so 15.5e6 Hz.

So plugging the numbers in:

B = (h * ν) / (g * μ_B)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate h * ν: 6.626e-34 J·s * 15.5e6 Hz = 6.626e-34 * 1.55e7 = let's see, 6.626 *1.55 is approximately 10.2841, so 10.2841e-27 J·T^-1? Wait, no, J is energy, and T is tesla, so units would be J/T.

Wait, but then denominator is g * μ_B. Let's compute that: 2.0033 * 9.274e-24 J/T. 2.0033 *9.274 is approximately 18.59, so 18.59e-24 J/T.

So now B is (6.626e-34 * 15.5e6) / (2.0033 * 9.274e-24)

Wait, wait, let me compute each part numerically.

Compute numerator:

6.626e-34 * 15.5e6 = 6.626 *15.5 * 1e-34+6 = 102.843 * 1e-28 = 1.02843e-26 J·s·Hz? Wait, no, Hz is 1/s, so 6.626e-34 * 15.5e6 = 6.626e-34 * 1.55e7 = 6.626 *1.55 = approx 10.28, and 1e-34+7 is 1e-27. So 10.28e-27 J·T^-1? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the value numerically.

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 15.5e6 = 6.626 *15.5 = let's compute 6 *15.5=93, 0.626*15.5≈9.7, total approx 102.7. So 102.7e-34+6 = 102.7e-28 = 1.027e-26 J·s * Hz? Wait, Hz is s^-1, so J·s * s^-1 = J. So numerator is 1.027e-26 J.

Denominator: g * μ_B = 2.0033 *9.274e-24 = let's compute 2 *9.274e-24 = 1.8548e-23, and 0.0033 *9.274e-24 ≈ 3.06e-26. So total is approx 1.8548e-23 +3.06e-26 ≈ 1.85786e-23 J/T.

So B ≈ (1.027e-26 J) / (1.85786e-23 J/T) ) → in Tesla.

Compute 1.027e-26 / 1.85786e-23 = (1.027 / 1.85786 ) * 1e-3 → approx 0.553 * 1e-3 → 5.53e-4 Tesla.

Wait, because 1.027 / 1.85786 is about 0.553. So B ≈ 0.553e-3 T, which is 0.553 mT.

Wait, because 1 T = 1000 mT, so 0.553e-3 T is 0.553 mT.

But wait, let me do the calculation more accurately.

Numerator: hν = 6.62607015e-34 * 15.5e6 → 6.62607015e-34 * 1.55e7 = 6.62607015 * 1.55 = let's compute.

6 *1.55 =9.3, 0.62607015 *1.55 ≈ 0.626 *1.5 is 0.939, plus 0.626 *0.05=0.0313, so total 0.939+0.0313=0.9703. So 9.3 +0.9703=10.2703. So 10.2703e-34+7 =10.2703e-27 J·s * Hz → but Hz is 1/s, so unit is J.

So numerator is 1.02703e-26 J.

Denominator: g * μ_B = 2.0033 *9.274e-24 J/T → 2.0033 *9.274 = let's compute.

2 *9.274 = 18.548.

0.0033 *9.274 ≈ 0.0306. So total is 18.548 +0.0306 =18.5786.

So denominator is 18.5786e-24 J/T → 1.85786e-23 J/T.

So B= (1.02703e-26 J) / (1.85786e-23 J/T ) → 1.02703e-26 /1.85786e-23 = (1.02703/1857.86 ) * 1e-3 → Wait, no, wait, 1e-26 /1e-23 is 1e-3. So 1.02703/(1.85786) ) *1e3 *1e-3? No, no, wait:

Wait, 1.02703e-26 / 1.85786e-23 = (1.02703 / 1.85786 ) * 1e(-26 - (-23)) ) → 1e-3. So 1.02703 /1.85786 ≈ 0.553 → 0.553 * 1e-3 → 5.53e-4 T → 0.553 mT.

So B is approximately 0.553 mT.

Wait, but let me check another approach. I've heard of a formula where the splitting in Gauss can be found using the formula: ΔB (in Gauss) = (hν)/(gμ_B) * (1/(1e4)) because μ_B is in Gauss units? Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that 1 mT equals 10 Gauss, since 1 T = 10^4 Gauss, so 1 mT = 10 Gauss.

Wait, 1 Tesla = 10^4 Gauss, right? So 1 mT is 1e-3 T = 10 Gauss. So if B is 0.553 mT, that's 5.53 Gauss.

Wait, let me check the calculation without approximations.

Compute B in Tesla:

B = (hν) / (g μ_B) = (6.626e-34 * 15.5e6) / (2.0033 * 9.274e-24)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *15.5e6 = 6.626 *15.5 *1e-34+6 → 102.  6.626*15.5 is about 102.815, so 102.815e-28 → 1.02815e-26 J.

Denominator: 2.0033 *9.274e-24 = 2.0033 *9.274 → as before, about 18.579e-24 → 1.8579e-23 J/T.

So B = (1.02815e-26) / (1.8579e-23) → 1.02815 / 1857.9 → wait, no, 1e-26 / 1e-23 is 1e-3. So 1.02815e-26 /1.8579e-23 = (1.02815 / 1857.9 ) → Wait, no, because 1e-26 /1e-23 = 1e-3, so it's 1.02815e-26 /1.8579e-23 = (1.02815 / 1.8579) ) * 1e-3.

So 1.02815 / 1.8579 ≈ 0.553. So 0.553 *1e-3 → 5.53e-4 T → 0.553 mT.

So in mT, it's 0.553 mT. Since 1 mT is 10 Gauss, 0.553 mT is 5.53 Gauss.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1 mT is 10 Gauss. So 0.553 mT * (10 Gauss/mT) = 5.53 Gauss.

Now, the third unit is cm^-1. To find that, I think we use the relation between frequency and wavenumbers.

Wait, wavenumbers (cm^-1) are related to frequency by ν (in Hz) = c * (wavenumber), where c is speed of light in cm/s.

So wavenumber = ν / c.

ν is 15.5 MHz = 15.5e6 Hz.

c is approx 3e10 cm/s.

So wavenumber = 15.5e6 / 3e10 → 15.5 /3e4 → approximately 5.166e-5 cm^-1 → 5.17e-4 cm^-1.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

15.5e6 Hz /3e10 cm/s = (15.5e6) / (3e10) ) cm^-1 = (15.5 /3 ) *1e6/1e10 → 5.166666... * 1e-4 → 5.1666e-4 cm^-1 → approx 5.17e-4 cm^-1.

So putting it all together: 15.5 MHz corresponds to 0.553 mT, 5.53 Gauss, and 5.17e-4 cm^-1.

Looking at the options, option A says 15.5 MHz = 0.553 mT =5.530 Gauss=5.17e-4 cm^-1.

Yes, that matches. So the correct answer should be option A.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start with the given frequency separation of 15.5 MHz and the g-value of 2.0033. The goal is to express this splitting in mT, Gauss, and cm⁻¹.

### Step 1: Convert frequency to magnetic field (mT and Gauss)
The relationship between energy and magnetic field is given by:

\[
\Delta E = g \mu_B B
\]

where \( g \) is the g-value, \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton (\( 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \)), and \( B \) is the magnetic field. The energy difference can also be expressed as:

\[
\Delta E = h \nu
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \nu \) is the frequency in Hz. Equating the two expressions for \( \Delta E \), we get:

\[
B = \frac{h \nu}{g \mu_B}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- \( \nu = 15.5 \, \text{MHz} = 15.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( g = 2.0033 \),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \),

we calculate:

\[
B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (15.5 \times 10^6)}{(2.0033) (9.274 \times 10^{-24})}
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
h \nu = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 15.5 \times 10^6 = 1.027 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

Next, compute the denominator:

\[
g \mu_B = 2.0033 \times 9.274 \times 10^{-24} = 1.858 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/T}
\]

Now, divide the two:

\[
B = \frac{1.027 \times 10^{-26}}{1.858 \times 10^{-23}} = 5.53 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{T}
\]

Convert to mT:

\[
B = 0.553 \, \text{mT}
\]

Convert to Gauss (1 mT = 10 Gauss):

\[
B = 5.53 \, \text{Gauss}
\]

### Step 2: Convert frequency to wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)
The relationship between frequency and wavenumbers is:

\[
\tilde{\nu} = \frac{\nu}{c}
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.0 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \)). Substituting \( \nu = 15.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \):

\[
\tilde{\nu} = \frac{15.5 \times 10^6}{3.0 \times 10^{10}} = 5.17 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Match the results to the options
From the calculations:
- \( B = 0.553 \, \text{mT} \),
- \( B = 5.53 \, \text{Gauss} \),
- \( \tilde{\nu} = 5.17 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}^{-1} \).

These values match **Option A**.

### Final Answer:
A
