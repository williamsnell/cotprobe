Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see... The question is about constructing a truth table for an argument and then determining if the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the given options.

The argument given is:

~S ∨ T
~S · U
~T ∨ U
-----------
T · U

Wait, I think those are the premises and the conclusion. So, the premises are three propositions, and the conclusion is T ∧ U. So I need to see if whenever all the premises are true, does the conclusion necessarily follow?

Alright, to approach this, I should construct a truth table for all the variables involved. The variables here are S, T, U. So there are three variables, meaning 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. I'll need to evaluate each premise and the conclusion for each combination.

Let me list the variables:

S | T | U

Now, the premises are:

1. ~S ∨ T
2. ~S ∧ U
3. ~T ∨ U

And the conclusion is T ∧ U.

I need to check for each row where all three premises are true. If in that case, the conclusion is also true, then the argument is valid. If there's any row where all premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that row is a counterexample.

Let me start by writing out all the possible truth values for S, T, U.

1. S=T, T=T, U=T
2. S=T, T=T, U=F
3. S=T, T=F, U=T
4. S=T, T=F, U=F
5. S=F, T=T, U=T
6. S=F, T=T, U=F
7. S=F, T=F, U=T
8. S=F, T=F, U=F

Now, for each row, evaluate the premises and the conclusion.

Let's do row by row.

Row 1: S=T, T=T, U=T

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T → F ∨ T → T
Premise 2: ~S ∧ U → F ∧ T → F
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U → F ∨ T → T
Conclusion: T ∧ U → T ∧ T → T

So in this row, premise 2 is false. So all premises are not true here. So this row doesn't make all premises true.

Row 2: S=T, T=T, U=F

Premise 1: F∨T → T
Premise 2: F ∧ F → F
Premise 3: F∨F → F
Conclusion: T ∧ F → F

Here, premise 2 and 3 are false, so not all premises are true.

Row 3: S=T, T=F, U=T

Premise 1: F ∨ F → F
Premise 2: F ∧ T → F
Premise 3: T ∨ T → T
Conclusion: F ∧ T → F

Premise 1 is false, so premises not all true.

Row 4: S=T, T=F, U=F

Premise1: F∨F → F
Premise2: F∧F → F
Premise3: T∨F → T
Conclusion: F∧F → F

Premise1 and 2 are false, so no.

Row5: S=F, T=T, U=T

Premise1: T∨T → T
Premise2: T ∧ T → T
Premise3: F∨T → T
Conclusion: T ∧ T → T

All premises are true, and conclusion is true. So this is a case where all premises are true and conclusion is true.

Row6: S=F, T=T, U=F

Premise1: T∨T → T
Premise2: T ∧ F → F
Premise3: F∨F → F
Conclusion: T ∧ F → F

Here, premise2 and 3 are false, so not all premises are true.

Row7: S=F, T=F, U=T

Premise1: T∨F → T
Premise2: T ∧ T → T
Premise3: T∨T → T
Conclusion: F ∧ T → F

So all premises are true here, but the conclusion is false. Wait, that's a problem. Because if all premises are true, but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid. Because in this case, the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So this would be a counterexample.

Row8: S=F, T=F, U=F

Premise1: T∨F → T
Premise2: T ∧ F → F
Premise3: T∨F → T
Conclusion: F ∧ F → F

Premise 2 is false, so not all premises are true.

So looking through the rows, only rows 5 and 7 have all premises true. In row 5, the conclusion is true; in row 7, the conclusion is false.

Since in row7, all premises are true but conclusion is false, the argument is invalid. So the answer should be that the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when S is false, T is false, and U is true.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when S and U are true and T is false. Wait, no, in row7, S is false, T is false, U is true.

Looking at the options:

A: T true, S and U false. No, that's row 2, which doesn't have all premises true.

B: U true, S and T false. That would be S=F, T=F, U=T. Which is exactly row7. So option B would be correct.

Wait, let me check option B.

Option B says: Invalid. Counterexample when U is true and S and T are false. Yes, that's S=F, T=F, U=T.

So yes, that's a counterexample. Therefore, the answer should be option B.

To determine the validity of the argument, we construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion:

**Premises:**
1. \( \neg S \lor T \)
2. \( \neg S \land U \)
3. \( \neg T \lor U \)

**Conclusion:**
\( T \land U \)

We evaluate all possible truth values for \( S, T, U \) (8 combinations). The argument is valid if, in every row where all premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there is any row where all premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row provides a counterexample.

### Truth Table Analysis:
1. **Row 1:** \( S=T, T=T, U=T \)  
   - Premises: \( T, F, T \)  
   - Conclusion: \( T \)  
   - Not all premises are true.

2. **Row 2:** \( S=T, T=T, U=F \)  
   - Premises: \( T, F, F \)  
   - Conclusion: \( F \)  
   - Not all premises are true.

3. **Row 3:** \( S=T, T=F, U=T \)  
   - Premises: \( F, F, T \)  
   - Conclusion: \( F \)  
   - Not all premises are true.

4. **Row 4:** \( S=T, T=F, U=F \)  
   - Premises: \( F, F, T \)  
   - Conclusion: \( F \)  
   - Not all premises are true.

5. **Row 5:** \( S=F, T=T, U=T \)  
   - Premises: \( T, T, T \)  
   - Conclusion: \( T \)  
   - All premises are true, and the conclusion is true.

6. **Row 6:** \( S=F, T=T, U=F \)  
   - Premises: \( T, F, F \)  
   - Conclusion: \( F \)  
   - Not all premises are true.

7. **Row 7:** \( S=F, T=F, U=T \)  
   - Premises: \( T, T, T \)  
   - Conclusion: \( F \)  
   - All premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This is a counterexample.

8. **Row 8:** \( S=F, T=F, U=F \)  
   - Premises: \( T, F, T \)  
   - Conclusion: \( F \)  
   - Not all premises are true.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **invalid** because there is a counterexample in Row 7, where \( S=F, T=F, U=T \). This matches **Option B**.
