Okay, so I've got this question about the WISC test scores and what percentage of the population falls within a certain range. Hmm. I remember that WISC stands for Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. It's an IQ test used to measure intelligence in kids. 

The question is asking about the percentage of people who score between 70 and 130. Wait, I think the WISC, like other IQ tests, is standardized so that the average score is 100. And the standard deviation, I believe, is 15. So that means most people's scores cluster around 100, right?

In a normal distribution, about 68% of the population scores within one standard deviation of the mean. That would be from 85 to 115, I think. Because 100 minus 15 is 85, and 100 plus 15 is 115. So that's about 68% of people. 

But the question is asking about a wider range, from 70 to 130. That's a larger window. Let me think about how much that extends beyond one standard deviation. Wait, 70 is 30 points below 100, and 130 is 30 points above. But since the standard deviation is 15, 70 is two standard deviations below the mean (100 - 2*15=70), and 130 is two standard deviations above (100 + 2*15=130). 

In a normal distribution, about 95% of the population falls within two standard deviations of the mean. So that's from 70 to 130. Wait, no, wait. Two standard deviations cover a larger range, but I think that includes about 95% of the population. So the percentage of people scoring between 70 and 130 should be approximately 95%.

Looking at the options, option E is 95. So the answer should be E.

Wait, let me double-check. The empirical rule says that in a normal distribution:
- 68% within 1 SD (so 85-115),
- 95% within 2 SDs (70-130),
- 99.7% within 3 SDs.

Yes, so between 70 and 130 would capture about 95% of the population. So the correct answer is E: 95.

The WISC (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children) is a standardized IQ test with a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. In a normal distribution, about 95% of the population scores within two standard deviations of the mean. Since two standard deviations below 100 is 70 and two standard deviations above is 130, approximately 95% of the population scores between 70 and 130. 

From the given options, the correct answer is E: 95.
