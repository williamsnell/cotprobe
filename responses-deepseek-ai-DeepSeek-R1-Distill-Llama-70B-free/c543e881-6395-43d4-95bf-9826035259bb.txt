Okay, so I've got this FRET question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me remember what FRET is about. FRET stands for Förster Resonance Energy Transfer, right? It's a mechanism describing energy transfer between two chromophores. It's used to measure distances at the nanoscale, typically between 1-10 nm, which is perfect for seeing if two parts of a protein are close to each other or changing their conformation.

The question is about a FRET experiment monitoring conformational changes in T4 lysozyme. Fluorescence intensity fluctuates between 5000 and 10,000 counts per second. Oh wait, but the key data is that 7500 counts represent a FRET efficiency of 0.5. So the assumption is that when the intensity is 7500, efficiency is 50%. 

They're asking about the change in distance between the FRET pair during the reaction. The FRET pair used is tetramethylrhodamine and Texas Red, with an r0 of 50 Å. Oh, r0 is the Förster radius, the distance at which the efficiency is 50%.

Hmm, how does FRET efficiency relate to the distance? I remember the formula for FRET efficiency (E) is E = 1 / [1 + (r/r0)^6], where r is the distance between the two fluorophores. Or wait, is it E = (r0/(r0 + r))^6? No, wait, no, the correct formula is E = 1 / [1 + (r/r0)^6]. Right, that's the equation.

So when E is 0.5, r equals r0. Because plugging E=0.5 into the equation: 0.5 = 1/(1 + (r/50)^6). Let's solve that. Multiply both sides by denominator: 0.5*(1 + (r/50)^6) = 1. So 1 + (r/50)^6 = 2. Therefore, (r/50)^6 = 1 → r/50 = 1 → r=50 Å. So at 7500 counts, the distance is 50 Å.

Wait, but how does the fluorescence intensity relate to FRET efficiency? Oh right, when FRET occurs, the donor fluorescence decreases because the energy is being transferred to the acceptor. So higher FRET efficiency means lower donor fluorescence, I think. Or wait, no, wait. The donor's fluorescence is quenched when FRET is efficient. So when FRET is active, the donor's emission goes down, and the acceptor's goes up. But in this question, the counts are fluctuating. So when the FRET is happening, the intensity would be lower than when it's not. Or maybe not? Wait, maybe the counts here are of the donor, or maybe they're something else. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that 7500 counts represents E=0.5. So when the intensity is higher, maybe E is lower. Because if the FRET efficiency is lower, then the donor doesn't lose as much energy, so it fluoresces more. So lower E → higher donor intensity, higher E → lower donor intensity.

So the possible scenarios: when E is 0.5, the distance is 50 Å. When the intensity is higher than 7500, say 10,000, that means lower E, so r is larger than 50. When the intensity is lower, like 5000, E is higher than 0.5, so r is smaller than 50.

Wait, but the question is asking for the change in distance during the reaction. So it's the difference between the two states. So we need to find the distances at both 5000 and 10,000 counts and subtract them to find the change.

Wait, but first, let's clarify the relationship between intensity and FRET efficiency. Let me think. When FRET occurs, the donor's fluorescence is quenched. So higher FRET efficiency (E) leads to lower donor fluorescence intensity.

So when E is higher, intensity is lower. So at 5000 counts, E is higher than 0.5, and at 10,000 counts, E is lower than 0.5.

So, at 5000 counts, E= ?

Wait, the given is that at 7500 counts, E=0.5. So 5000 is lower than 7500, which implies higher E. 10,000 is higher than 7500, implying lower E.

So first, find E at 5000 and 10,000. Then, find r for each E, and compute the difference.

Wait, but wait, maybe the assumption is that the maximum and minimum counts correspond to E=0 and E=1? Or not. Because the question doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm, but the problem gives E=0.5 at 7500 counts. So perhaps 7500 is the midpoint between 5000 and 10,000.

Wait, 5000 is lower than 7500, which would imply higher E. So, let's think about E when the counts are 5000 and 10,000.

Wait, but how to compute E from the counts? Because the counts are from the donor intensity. So when E is 0, donor intensity is maximum, right? Because no energy transfer. As E increases, donor intensity decreases.

So, the donor intensity (I) is related to E as I = I_max (1 - E), where I_max is the intensity when E=0. Or is it? Or perhaps I = I_max * (1 - E) / (1 - E_0), where E_0 is some baseline. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of I = I_max * (1 - E) / (1 - E_0), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The donor fluorescence intensity in the presence of acceptor (I_DA) is related to the intensity without acceptor (I_D) by I_DA = I_D * (1 - E). So when E=0, I_DA = I_D; when E=1, I_DA=0.

So if I_D is the maximum possible intensity (without any FRET), then I_DA = I_D (1-E). So the maximum intensity would be when E=0, which is I_D.

In the experiment, when the intensity is 10,000, that's presumably the highest count, which would correspond to E=0 because no FRET → maximum donor emission. Similarly, the lowest count (5000) would correspond to E=1, as maximum FRET, donor emission is lowest.

Wait, but that might not be the case because the given is that 7500 corresponds to E=0.5. So perhaps that's the scenario where the conformational change brings the pair to 50 Å, and the fluctuation is between higher and lower E.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

The problem says that the fluorescence intensity fluctuates between 5000 and 10,000 counts. So perhaps the maximum intensity is 10,000 when E is 0 (no FRET, donor emits fully), and the minimum is 5000 when E is 1 (maximum FRET, donor emission is quenched the most). So then, 7500 is in between, which is E=0.5. That makes sense.

If that's the case, then:

At 10,000 counts → E=0 → r is infinity (but more practically, r >> r0, so E approaches 0).

At 5000 counts → E=1 → r=0 (but realistically, when r approaches 0, E approaches 1).

But wait, that can't be right, because in reality, E=1 would require the fluorophores to be at zero distance, which is impossible. So perhaps the 5000 and 10,000 counts are not the extremes of E=1 and E=0, but just two points where E is 0.5 plus some delta. But the problem states that 7500 is E=0.5, so perhaps 5000 and 10,000 are two different E values on either side of 0.5.

Wait, another approach: let's model the data. Let's assume that the donor intensity I is given by I = I_max (1 - E). So when E=0, I = I_max. When E=1, I=0.

But in the problem, the counts are between 5000 and 10,000. So perhaps 10,000 is I_max (E=0), and 5000 is I_min (E=1). So the FRET efficiency at 5000 counts is 1, and at 10,000 counts is 0.

But given that 7500 is E=0.5, let's check if that fits.

So if I_max is 10,000, then I = I_max (1 - E). At I=7500, 7500 = 10000*(1 - 0.5), which is correct.

Similarly, at I=5000: 5000 = 10000*(1 - E) → 0.5 = 1 - E → E=0.5. Wait, that's not right. Because then E would be 0.5 at both 5000 and 7500. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me clarify.

If FRET efficiency E is 0.5 when I=7500, and I can vary between 5000 and 10,000, then I think the correct model is that when E=0, I would be higher than 7500, and when E=1, I would be lower than 7500. But in the problem, the maximum I is 10,000 and the minimum is 5000. So perhaps 10,000 is when E=0, and 5000 is when E=1.

Wait, let me compute E at 5000 and 10,000, given that at 7500, E=0.5.

Assuming that the maximum possible I is 10,000 (E=0) and the minimum I is 5000 (E=1), then:

At I=10,000 → E=0 → r = infinity (so FRET efficiency is zero).

At I=5000 → E=1 → r=0 ( fluorophores are very close, so maximum energy transfer).

But the given is that at I=7500, E=0.5.

Wait, let's calculate E for 5000 and 10,000 using I = I_max (1 - E).

At I=10,000 → 10,000 = I_max (1 - 0) → I_max=10,000.

At I=5000 → 5000 = 10000 (1 - E1) → 0.5 = 1 - E1 → E1=0.5.

Wait, but that's the same E as at 7500. That can't be, because then both 5000 and 7500 would have E=0.5.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe the maximum I isn't 10,000. Alternatively, perhaps I don't reach E=0 or E=1 in the experiment.

Wait, perhaps the 7500 count is the midpoint between the maximum and minimum possible. If the maximum is 10,000 and minimum is 5000, then 7500 is the midpoint, which would correspond to E=0.5. That makes sense.

So, when I is 10,000 → E=0.

When I is 5000 → E=1.

So, E is (I_max - I) / (I_max - I_min).

Wait, another formula for E is E = (I_max - I) / (I_max - I_min). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, E could be calculated as (I_D - I_DA) / I_D, where I_DA is the donor intensity in presence of acceptor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between intensity and E.

Assuming that when E increases, the donor intensity decreases. So, when E is 0, I = I_max (10,000). When E is 1, I=I_min (5000). So, the FRET efficiency E can be calculated as:

E = (I_max - I) / (I_max - I_min)

So, at I=7500:

E = (10000 - 7500) / (10000 - 5000) = (2500)/(5000) = 0.5. Which matches the given data.

So, that formula makes sense.

So, now, for the two intensity values, 5000 and 10,000:

At 10,000 counts: E=0.

At 5000 counts: E=1.

So, we need to find the FRET distances for E=0 and E=1, then find the change in distance.

Wait, but wait, when E=0, the distance is r → infinity (but realistically, much larger than r0). But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can think of E=0 as r being much larger than r0 (like, say, r approaches infinity, but in reality, for the calculation, when r >> r0, E approaches 0).

Similarly, when E=1, r approaches zero.

But wait, that can't be right because r can't be zero. So perhaps in this experimental setup, the minimum and maximum FRET efficiencies are E_min and E_max, but the problem states that 7500 is E=0.5, and the counts fluctuate between 5000 and 10,000. So using the formula E = (I_max - I)/(I_max - I_min), we can find E for each I.

Wait, but we already have E values for 5000 and 10,000.

At 10,000 counts → E=0.

At 5000 counts → E=1.

So, the distances at E=0 and E=1 would be r= infinity (but let's think of it as r approaches infinity, but for calculation purposes, perhaps E=0 implies r is much larger than r0, so E approaches 0. So FRET is negligible. So the actual distance is not really infinity, but perhaps we can consider r for E=0 as being very large.

Wait, but when E=0, r is infinity, which would make FRET zero. Similarly, when E=1, r=0, but that's not possible. So perhaps, in reality, E=1 is r=0 (the fluorophores are as close as possible), but in reality, you can't reach E=1 unless the distance is zero.

But in the problem, the counts go down to 5000, which would imply E=1. So perhaps the actual minimum distance is when the fluorophores are as close as possible, but that's probably not zero. So let's proceed.

So, to find the change in distance, we need to compute r when E=0 and when E=1, and find the difference.

Wait, no. Because the question says the counts fluctuate between 5000 and 10,000, meaning that the FRET efficiency varies between E=1 and E=0.

Wait, wait, no. Because when I=10,000, E=0; when I=5000, E=1. So the distance changes between r=∞ (or very large) and r=0 (or very small). But that can't be, because the distance can't be zero. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum and minimum counts are not corresponding to E=0 and E=1, but somewhere else. Because in reality, E can't reach 1 or 0. So perhaps the maximum possible E in the experiment is E_max, and I_min is higher than zero.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The question says that the counts fluctuate between 5000 and 10,000, and 7500 is E=0.5. So, 7500 is the midpoint between 5000 and 10,000, which suggests that E=0.5 occurs at this midpoint. So, perhaps the maximum E in the system is when I=5000, and the minimum E is when I=10,000.

So, let's compute E for 5000 and 10,000 counts.

Using the formula E = (I_max - I) / (I_max - I_min).

Given I_max =10,000 and I_min=5000, so:

At I=5000: E = (10,000 -5000)/(10,000-5000) = 5000/5000 = 1.

At I=10,000: E= (10,000 -10,000)/(10,000-5000) = 0/5000=0.

So yes, at 5000 counts, E=1; at 10,000, E=0.

So, the FRET pair's separation distance varies between r=0 (E=1) and r=∞ (E=0). But that's not possible, so perhaps the actual maximum and minimum E are less than 1 and greater than 0. But the problem tells us that 7500 counts correspond to E=0.5, so maybe the actual E does range from 0 to 1.

Wait, but in reality, E can't be 1 unless the fluorophores are at zero distance. So perhaps in this problem, for the purpose of calculation, we can take E=1 as r=0, and E=0 as r approaching infinity, but for the change in distance, perhaps we can compute the distances at E=0.5 and then find the change between the two states.

Wait, no, because the question is about the fluctuation between 5000 and 10,000 counts, which correspond to E=1 and E=0.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distances at E=0.5, which is 50 Å, and then when E is higher or lower than that.

Wait, but the question is about the change during the reaction, so when the intensity is 5000 counts (E=1) and 10,000 counts (E=0), the distance changes from 0 to infinity? That doesn't make sense, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distances at E=0 and E=1, but in reality, E can't be exactly 1 or 0. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the two states: when the intensity is 5000 and 10,000, what's the change in r.

Wait, perhaps the intensity fluctuates between 5000 (E=1) and 10,000 (E=0). So, the distance changes from close (r=0) to far apart (r=infinity), but that's not possible, so perhaps the actual distances are when E=1 and E=0,
