Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mr. Smith bought a car for $4250. He gave a down payment of $500 by trading in his old car, so the balance he needs to pay is 4250 minus 500, which is $3750. He's paying this off in 25 equal monthly payments of $180 each. I need to find the interest rate, and the options are given from A to J, with each being a percentage.

Hmm, I remember that this kind of problem involves the concept of simple interest or maybe the amortization of a loan. But wait, the question mentions using the constant ratio formula, which I think is related to the Rule of 78 or maybe the N-ratio method. Wait, no, the constant ratio formula is also called the add-on method, where the interest is calculated once at the beginning of the loan.

Wait, let me think. The constant ratio formula is used to calculate the interest rate for installment loans. The formula I remember is that the interest rate per period (like monthly) can be found by using the formula:

r = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n + 1))

Wait, no, maybe it's different. Alternatively, for the constant payment loans, the interest calculation might be based on the average balance. Or perhaps I should use the present value of an annuity formula because the payments are monthly and equal.

Wait, but the question says to use the constant ratio formula. Oh right, the constant ratio formula is sometimes used in the context of the add-on method where the interest is calculated on the initial principal and added to the principal to get the total amount due. Then that total is divided into installments. But wait, that might not be the case here because the payments are equal, so perhaps it's an annuity.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline the problem again. The loan amount after down payment is $3750. He's paying 25 monthly payments of $180 each. So total paid is 25*180 = $4500. So the total interest paid is 4500 - 3750 = $750. So the interest is $750 over 2 years.

Wait, but how do I find the interest rate? If I were using simple interest, I could calculate I = P * r * t. Here, I is $750, P is $3750, and t is 25 months, which is 25/12 years.

But wait, simple interest might not be the right approach here because the payments are made monthly, so the principal decreases each month. So the simple interest calculation would be incorrect because of the changing balance. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the time value of money concepts, specifically the present value of an ordinary annuity.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r

Where PV is the present value (loan amount), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this problem, PV is $3750, PMT is $180, n is 25. We need to solve for r, which is the monthly interest rate. Then, we can multiply by 12 to get the annual rate and then adjust to the nearest tenth of a percent.

But wait, solving this equation for r isn't straightforward algebraically. I need to use an iterative method or perhaps a financial calculator. Alternatively, maybe I can estimate it using trial and error.

Let me set up the equation:

3750 = 180 * [1 - (1 + r)^-25] / r

I can rearrange this to solve for r. Let's try plugging in some values for r and see which gets me close to 3750.

Let me try r = 1% per month. Then (1 + 0.01)^-25 is approximately 0.781 (using the formula 1/(1.01)^25 ≈ 0.781). So [1 - 0.781] = 0.219. Then 0.219 / 0.01 = 21.9. Multiply by 180: 180 * 21.9 ≈ 3934. So 3934 is higher than 3750. So the PV is higher than needed, meaning the interest rate is higher than 1% per month.

Wait, but wait a minute: If r is 1%, the PV is higher than 3750, meaning that the actual rate is higher than 1% because at higher rates, the PV would be lower.

Wait, no, let me think again. If the interest rate is higher, the denominator in the PV formula would be smaller. Let me clarify: The present value decreases as the interest rate increases. So when I tried r=1%, I got a PV of ~3934, which is higher than 3750. Since I need a lower PV, the interest rate must be higher than 1% per month.

Let me try r=1.5% per month.

(1.015)^25: Let's compute that. Alternatively, I can compute (1.015)^-25. Let me compute 1.015^25 first. Let me approximate:

ln(1.015) ≈ 0.0148. Multiply by 25: 0.0148 * 25 ≈ 0.37. So exp(0.37) ≈ 1.447. So (1.015)^25 ≈ 1.447, so (1.015)^-25 ≈ 1/1.447 ≈ 0.691.

Then [1 - 0.691] = 0.309. 0.309 / 0.015 ≈ 20.6. So 180 * 20.6 ≈ 3716. That's lower than 3750. So at 1.5% monthly, PV is ~3716, which is less than 3750. So the actual rate is between 1% and 1.5%.

Wait, let's find the exact value where PV=3750. Let me set up variables:

At r=1%: PV=3934
At r=1.5%: PV=3716

We need r where PV=3750. So the difference between 3750 and 3934 is 184, and between 3934 and 3716 is 218. So 184/218 ≈ 0.844, so 84.4% of the way from 1% to 1.5%. So r ≈ 1% + 0.844*(0.5%) = 1% + 0.422% = 1.422% per month.

Wait, but that's a rough approximation. Alternatively, let me use linear interpolation.

Let me denote:

At r1=0.01, PV1=3934
At r2=0.015, PV2=3716

We need PV=3750.

The difference between PV1 and PV2 is 3934-3716=218.
The target PV is 3750, which is 3934 - 184 = 3750.

So the fraction is 184 / 218 ≈ 0.844.

So the interest rate r is between 0.01 and 0.015. So r = 0.01 + 0.844*(0.015-0.01) = 0.01 + 0.844*0.005 = 0.01 + 0.00422 = 0.01422 or 1.422% per month.

To check, let's compute PV at r=0.01422.

Compute [1 - (1.01422)^-25] / 0.01422.

First, (1.01422)^25. Let me compute this.

Alternatively, I can compute the denominator factor:

Let me compute (1 + r)^-n.

r=0.01422, n=25. So ln(1.01422) ≈ 0.01412. Multiply by 25: 0.353. So exp(-0.353) ≈ 0.702.

So (1.01422)^-25 ≈ 0.702.

So [1 - 0.702] = 0.298.

0.298 / 0.01422 ≈ 20.96.

So 180 * 20.96 ≈ 3773. That's a bit higher than 3750. So perhaps our initial approximation was a bit off. Maybe we need a slightly higher r.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation method. Alternatively, perhaps I can try r=1.4% and see.

At r=1.4%:

(1.014)^25: Let's compute 1.014^25.

Alternatively, compute (1.014)^-25.

ln(1.014)=0.01397. Multiply by 25: 0.3493. exp(-0.3493)= ~0.704.

So [1 - 0.704] = 0.296. 0.296 / 0.014 ≈ 21.14. So 180 *21.14≈ 3805.6. That's higher than 3750. So r needs to be higher.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because at r=1.5%, we got PV=3716, which is lower than 3750, so the correct r should be between 1.4% and 1.5%.

Let me try r=1.45% (0.0145).

Compute (1.0145)^25.

ln(1.0145)= approx 0.01438. Multiply by 25: 0.3595. exp(-0.3595)= ~0.698.

So [1 - 0.698] = 0.302. 0.302 / 0.0145 ≈ 20.827. So 180 * 20.827 ≈ 3750.86. Oh, that's very close to 3750. So r≈1.45% per month.

Wait, but 1.45% per month times 12 would be 17.4% annually. But looking at the options, 17.5% is option H, 18.5 is C, 19.5 J, etc.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a better method. The formula is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r

We have PV=3750, PMT=180, n=25. So:

3750 = 180 * [1 - (1 + r)^-25 ] / r

Let me rearrange this:

[1 - (1 + r)^-25 ] / r = 3750 / 180 ≈ 20.8333.

Let me define f(r) = [1 - (1 + r)^-25 ] / r - 20.8333 = 0.

We need to find r that makes f(r)=0.

Using trial and error:

At r=0.0145 (1.45%):

[1 - (1.0145)^-25 ] / 0.0145 ≈ [1 - 0.698] / 0.0145 ≈ 0.302 / 0.0145 ≈ 20.827, which is very close to 20.8333. So r≈1.45% per month.

So the annual rate would be 1.45% *12 = 17.4%. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 17.4%, which is 17.4%, so option H is 17.5%, which is the closest.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation because the approximation might have been a bit off. Let me compute (1.0145)^25 more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute (1.0145)^25 step by step.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, using a calculator for better precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that 1.45% per month gives an annual rate of 17.4%, which would round to 17.4%, so 17.4% is 17.4%. The options don't have 17.4, but option H is 17.5%. So the answer would be H:17.5%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me see. Did I correctly calculate the present value at 1.45%?

At r=1.45%, PV=180 * [1 - (1.0145)^-25]/0.0145

Compute (1.0145)^25:

Using a calculator, let's compute it more accurately.

First, compute ln(1.0145) = 0.01438.

Multiply by 25: 0.3595.

exp(-0.3595) ≈ e^-0.3595 ≈ 0.6983.

So 1 - 0.6983 = 0.3017.

Divide by 0.0145: 0.3017 / 0.0145 ≈ 20.827.

Multiply by 180: 20.827 * 180 ≈ 3750.86, which is just slightly above 3750. So perhaps the exact rate is a little higher than 1.45%.

Let me try r=1.453% (0.01453).

Compute (1.01453)^-25.

ln(1.01453)=approx 0.01441.

Multiply by 25: 0.01441 *25=0.36025.

exp(-0.36025) ≈ 0.6977.

1 - 0.6977=0.3023.

0.3023 / 0.01453 ≈ 20.83.

So 180 *20.83≈3750. So it's very close. Therefore, the monthly rate is approximately 1.453%, so annual is 1.453% *12≈17.436%, which is 17.4% when rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. So 17.4% is the rate, but the options don't have 17.4; the closest is H:17.5%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me consider that maybe I should use a more precise calculation method, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approximation.

Wait, but let me think again. If the monthly rate is approximately 1.45%, then the annual rate is 1.45 *12=17.4%. Since the question asks for the nearest tenth of a percent, 17.4% would round to 17.4%, but the option H is 17.5%. So perhaps due to more precise calculations, it's 17.5%. Alternatively, maybe I missed a decimal point earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the constant ratio method. Wait, what's the constant ratio formula exactly?

The constant ratio formula, I think, is used in the add-on method where the interest is calculated as a percentage of the original principal and added on, then divided into installments. The formula for the interest rate under this method is:

Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time)

But the payments are made in installments, so the average time the money is owed is (n + 1)/2 months. So the interest would be Principal * Rate * (n+1)/(2*12).

Wait, perhaps that's another approach. Let me try that.

Total interest paid is $750 as calculated before (4500 -3750=750). The principal is $3750.

The average period is (25 +1)/2 = 13 months, which is 13/12 years ≈ 1.0833 years.

So using simple interest formula:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

750 = 3750 * Rate * (13/12)

So Rate = 750 / (3750 * (13/12)) = 750 / (3750 * 1.0833)

Calculate denominator: 3750 * 1.0833 ≈ 3750 * 1.0833 ≈ 4062.5

So Rate ≈ 750 / 4062.5 ≈ 0.1846 or 18.46%.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation gave around 17.4%. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps this method is the add-on method, which is different from the time value of money approach. But the question says to use the constant ratio formula, which I'm not entirely sure about. Maybe I should stick with the present value approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the simple interest method with the average balance. Let me compute that.

The average balance would be (initial principal + final principal)/2. But since it's being paid off in monthly installments, the final principal is zero. So average balance is 3750/2 = 1875.

Time is 25 months, which is 25/12 years ≈ 2.0833 years.

Interest = 750.

So using simple interest formula:

I = P_avg * R * T

750 = 1875 * R * 2.0833

So R = 750 / (1875 * 2.0833) = 750 / (3906.25) ≈ 0.192 or 19.2%.

Hmm, that's close to 19.2%, so option J is 19.5%. But this method doesn't consider the exact time value of money properly, as each payment reduces the principal.

Wait, but the question specifies to use the constant ratio formula. I'm getting confused now because I'm getting different results with different methods.

Alternatively, perhaps I should stick with the present value of annuity approach, which is the correct method for installment loans with equal payments. So that approach gave me approximately 17.4%, which would round to 17.4%, but the closest option is H:17.5%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the present value calculation earlier, and the actual rate is higher. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the interest rate in an installment loan, which is:

r = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n + 1))

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formula for the N-ratio method, which is used in the constant ratio method.

Alternatively, the formula might be:

r = (2 * PMT) / (P * (n + 1))

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Total interest = P * r * (n + 1)/2

Where n is the number of payments.

Wait, in that case, total interest is 750 = 3750 * r * (25 + 1)/2 /12

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the constant ratio formula.

Wait, perhaps the constant ratio formula is the same as the add-on method, where the interest is calculated as Principal * rate * time, and time is (n +1)/(2*12
