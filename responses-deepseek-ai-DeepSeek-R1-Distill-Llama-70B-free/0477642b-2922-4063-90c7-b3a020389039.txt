Alright, so I have this question about the traditional 20th wedding anniversary gift. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that each anniversary has a traditional material associated with it. Like, I think the first anniversary is paper, and the 25th is silver. Wait, no, maybe silver is for 25 years? Or was it gold? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the 50th anniversary is gold, right? Yeah, I think that's correct. So then, what comes before that? Like, maybe the 25th is silver. So if 25 is silver, then what's the 20th?

I've heard that some anniversaries have a specific gemstone or material. Let me think: 10th is tin, 15th is crystal, 20th... I'm not sure. Maybe pearls? Because pearls are often associated with weddings, like 30th anniversary? No, wait, I think pearls are for 30 years.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to list them out in order. 

1st: Paper
5th: Wood
10th: Tin
15th: Crystal
20th: China
25th: Silver
30th: Pearl
35th: Coral
40th: Ruby
45th: Sapphire
50th: Gold

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Maybe the 20th is china. So, the traditional gift would be china.

Looking back at the options, option I is china. So the answer should be I.
