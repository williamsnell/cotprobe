Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a parachutist in free fall. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says the parachutist has a mass m of 80 kg. He's undergoing free fall, and the drag force is given by F_D = k v², where k is 0.27 Ns²/m². I need to find the distance h he travels until his velocity v is 0.95 times the terminal velocity v_t.

Wait, right, terminal velocity is when the net force on the object is zero. So at that point, the drag force equals the weight of the parachutist. So F_D = m g. Because weight is mass times gravity, and drag is k v_t squared.

So first, I should calculate the terminal velocity v_t. Let me write that down:

F_D = m g → k v_t² = m g

Solving for v_t: v_t = sqrt( (m g) / k )

I know m is 80 kg, g is approximately 9.8 m/s², and k is 0.27.

Let me plug in the numbers:

v_t = sqrt( (80 * 9.8) / 0.27 )

Calculating numerator first: 80 *9.8 = 784.

Then 784 / 0.27 ≈ 784 / 0.27. Let me compute that. 784 divided by 0.27. Hmm, 0.27 * 2900 is 783, so approximately 2900. So 784/0.27 ≈ 2903.7.

So v_t is sqrt(2903.7) ≈ 53.86 m/s. Let me double-check that square root. 53 squared is 2809, 54 squared is 2916. So yeah, around 53.86 m/s.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit high for terminal velocity, but I think parachutists can reach speeds around that. Okay, moving on.

Now, the problem asks for the distance h traveled until v = 0.95 v_t. So v is 0.95 * 53.86 ≈ 51.17 m/s.

I remember that in free fall with air resistance, the velocity as a function of time can be found by integrating the equations of motion. Oh wait, but this might get a bit involved. Let me think about the equation.

The parachutist's motion is influenced by two forces: gravity (mg downward) and drag (F_D upward, which is kv²). So the net force is mg - kv² = ma. So acceleration a = (mg - kv²)/m = g - (k/m) v².

This is a differential equation because acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. So the equation is dv/dt = g - (k/m) v².

Hmm, solving this differential equation would give me v as a function of time, and then I can integrate velocity to get distance. But that seems complicated, especially without knowing time. Alternatively, maybe I can use the relation between distance and velocity in terms of energy or by substitution.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the equation can be rewritten in terms of dv/dt. Maybe I can use substitution variables. Let me see.

Let me write the equation again:

dv/dt = g - (k/m) v²

This looks like a separable equation. So I can write dt = dv / [g - (k/m) v² ]

Integrating both sides would give me t as a function of v, but that's not directly helpful for finding h. I need to find the distance traveled as a function of velocity. So perhaps I can express dt in terms of dv and velocity, and then multiply by velocity to get dh.

Wait, because dh = v dt, so if I have dt from the equation, I can write dh = v [dv / (g - (k/m) v² ) ]

So integrating h from v=0 to v=0.95 v_t would give the distance h.

So, h = ∫ (v dv) / (g - (k/m) v² ) from 0 to 0.95 v_t

Hmm, that integral seems a bit tricky, but maybe a substitution can help. Let me think about substituting u = g - (k/m) v². Then du/dv = -2 (k/m) v. Hmm, that's not directly matching the numerator, which is v dv.

Wait, so let's try:

u = g - (k/m)v² → du = - (2k/m) v dv.

So, v dv = -(m/(2k)) du.

So substituting into the integral:

h = ∫ v dv / (g - (k/m) v² ) = ∫ [ (v dv) ] / u = ∫ ( -m/(2k) du ) / u

So that's -m/(2k) ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -m/(2k) * ln |u| + C.

Now, substituting back, u is g - (k/m) v².

So the integral from v=0 to v= v_ (which is 0.95 v_t):

h = [ -m/(2k) ln( g - (k/m) v² ) ] evaluated from 0 to v.

Wait, let me check that.

Wait, the integral of 1/u du is ln|u|, so with the substitution, we have:

h = [ -m/(2k) * ln(g - (k/m) v^2) ] from 0 to v.

So evaluating from 0 to v, which is 0.95 v_t:

h = [ -m/(2k) ( ln(g - (k/m) v^2) - ln(g - (k/m)(0)^2) ) ]

Because at v=0, the term is ln(g).

Wait, but wait: when v = v_t, we have g - (k/m) v_t^2 = 0. Because at terminal velocity, the acceleration is zero, so F_D = mg → k v_t^2 /m =g → g = (k/m) v_t².

So for v =0.95 v_t, let's compute (k/m) v^2.

v = 0.95 v_t → v^2 = 0.9025 v_t².

So (k/m) v^2 = 0.9025 * (k/m v_t²) ) = 0.9025 g, since (k/m) v_t² =g.

So g - (k/m) v^2 = g - 0.9025 g = 0.0975 g.

Similarly, at v=0, (k/m) v^2 is zero, so g -0 =g.

So plugging into the expression for h:

h = [ -m/(2k) ( ln(0.0975 g) - ln(g) ) ]

Wait, but 0.0975 g is just 0.0975 times g, but the g's inside the log would cancel out, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out g. Let me write 0.0975 g as g * 0.0975.

So,

ln(0.0975 g ) = ln(g) + ln(0.0975)

So,

h = [ -m/(2k) ( [ln(g) + ln(0.0975) ] - ln(g) ) ]

The ln(g) terms cancel out, so:

h = [ -m/(2k) ( ln(0.0975) ) ]

But ln(0.0975) is negative because 0.0975 is less than 1. So:

h = [ -m/(2k) * (negative number) ) ] → positive value.

Let me compute ln(0.0975). Let me see, 0.0975 is approximately 1/10.26. Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

ln(0.0975) ≈ ln(0.1) is about -2.3026. Let me compute 0.0975: it's 0.1 minus 0.0025, so a bit less than 0.1.

Using a calculator (well, I don't have one, but I can approximate). Let's see, 0.0975 is 39/400, but that's perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that ln(0.09) is about -2.4079, and ln(0.1)= -2.3026. 0.0975 is between 0.09 and 0.1, closer to 0.1. Let me approximate it as about -2.35.

But perhaps a better approach is to just compute it.

Wait, 0.0975 is e^x, find x.

Let me think: e^-2 is about 0.1353, e^-2.3 is about 0.1003. Oh, wait, that's close to 0.0975.

Wait, e^-2.3 ≈ 0.1003. So 0.0975 is a bit lower than that. So x would be a bit more than 2.3, say 2.31.

Wait, compute e^-2.31:

e^2.31 ≈ e^2 * e^0.31. e^2 ≈7.389, e^0.31≈1.364. So 7.389 *1.364≈10.07. So e^-2.31 ≈1/10.07≈0.0993. Wait, that's higher than 0.0975.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try another method.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Taylor expansion around x=0.1.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation symbolically and plug in the numbers.

So, let's proceed.

h = [ -m/(2k) * ln(0.0975) ]

But wait, 0.0975 is equal to 1 - 0.9025, but perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another substitution. Let me think again.

Wait, but maybe I can express everything in terms of v_t.

Wait, because we have v_t = sqrt( (m g)/k )

So, (k/m) v_t² = g.

So, when I have (k/m) v^2 = (v^2)/(v_t^2) * g.

Hmm, perhaps that can help in substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me proceed numerically.

So, let me plug in the numbers.

We have:

m =80 kg,

k=0.27 Ns²/m²,

g=9.8 m/s².

v_t = sqrt( (80 *9.8)/0.27 ) ≈ sqrt(784/0.27 )≈ sqrt(2900)≈53.85 m/s.

So, 0.95 v_t ≈51.17 m/s.

Now, compute the term (k/m) v^2 when v=51.17 m/s.

(k/m) v² = (0.27 /80) * (51.17)^2.

Compute 51.17 squared: 51.17^2 ≈ (50)^2 + 2*50*1.17 + (1.17)^2 → 2500 + 117 + 1.3689 ≈ 2618.3689.

So (0.27/80)*2618.3689 = (0.27 *2618.3689)/80.

0.27 *2618.3689 ≈ 707.23.

Divided by 80: 707.23/80 ≈8.84 m/s².

But wait, wait, no, because (k/m) v^2 has units of (Ns²/m² * m²/s²) ) → N/m = kg/s² = acceleration.

Wait, but no, (k/m) v^2 = (kg·m/s² ), because F_D =k v² is in Newtons, and F_D/m is acceleration.

Wait, no, F_D is (kg)(m/s²), so F_D/m would be m/s², which is acceleration.

Wait, but (k/m) v² would be (kg·m/s²)/kg → m/s².

So, (k/m) v² = 8.84 m/s². So, the net acceleration is g - (k/m) v^2 = 9.8 -8.84 =1.0 m/s².

Wait, that's interesting. So at v=51.17 m/s, the acceleration is 1.0 m/s².

But that's a side point. Let's get back to the integral.

So, h = [ -m/(2k) * ln( (g - (k/m)v²)/g ) ]

Because g - (k/m)v² = (g - (k/m)v² ) = g * [1 - ( (k/m) v² )/g ]

But since (k/m) v_t² =g, so (k/m) v² = (v²/v_t²)*g.

So,

h = [ -m/(2k) * ln( (g - (k/m) v² ) / g ) ]

= [ -m/(2k) * ln(1 - (v²)/(v_t²) ) ]

Wait, that might be a better way to express it, since v_t is known.

So,

h = [ -m/(2k) * ln(1 - (v^2)/(v_t^2) ) ]

But our v is 0.95 v_t, so v^2 = 0.9025 v_t^2.

So,

h = [ -m/(2k) * ln(1 - 0.9025 ) ]

= [ -m/(2k) * ln(0.0975) ]

As before.

Now, let me compute the value of ln(0.0975).

Using a calculator would help, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll approximate.

I know that ln(0.1) ≈ -2.302585.

0.0975 is 0.1 * 0.975. So,

ln(0.0975) = ln(0.1 * 0.975 ) = ln(0.1) + ln(0.975 )

≈ (-2.302585) + ln(0.975)

Now, ln(0.975) can be approximated.

The Taylor series expansion for ln(1 - x) around x=0 is -x -x²/2 -x³/3 - ... So for x=0.025,

ln(0.975) = ln(1 - 0.025) ≈ -0.025 - (0.025)^2/2 - (0.025)^3/3

Compute each term:

-0.025 = -0.025

(0.025)^2=0.000625 → 0.000625/2=0.0003125 → second term is -0.0003125

(0.025)^3 = 0.000015625 → divided by 3 is ≈0.0000052083 → third term is -0.0000052083.

Adding these up: -0.025 -0.0003125 -0.0000052 ≈ -0.0253177.

So ln(0.975) ≈ -0.0253177.

So ln(0.0975) ≈ (-2.302585) + (-0.0253177) ≈ -2.3279.

Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Because ln(0.0975) is ln(0.1) + ln(0.975), so that's (-2.302585) + (-0.0253177) ≈ -2.3279.

So, ln(0.0975) ≈ -2.3279.

So, going back to h:

h = [ -m/(2k) ] * ( -2.3279 )

Which is [ (m/(2k)) * 2.3279 ]

So,

h = (80 / (2 * 0.27 )) * 2.3279

Compute denominator: 2 *0.27=0.54.

So,

80 / 0.54 ≈ 148.148.

Then multiply by 2.3279:

148.148 * 2.3279 ≈ ?

Let me compute 148 *2.3279.

Compute 100*2.3279=232.79

40*2.3279=93.116

8*2.3279≈18.6232

Adding them up: 232.79 +93.116=325.906 +18.6232≈344.5292.

So approximately 344.53 meters.

Wait, but that's the value of h.

Looking back at the options, option D is 345.0, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my approximation for ln(0.0975). Earlier, I estimated ln(0.0975) as approximately -2.3279. But maybe I should check that again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more accurate method to compute ln(0.0975).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 0.0975 = 39/400, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the approximate value leads to h≈344.5 m, which is very close to option D:345.0.

So the correct answer would be D:345.0.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the terminal velocity \( v_t \) using the equation:

\[
v_t = \sqrt{\frac{m g}{k}}
\]

where \( m = 80 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( k = 0.27 \, \text{Ns}^2/\text{m}^2 \). Substituting the values:

\[
v_t = \sqrt{\frac{80 \cdot 9.8}{0.27}} = \sqrt{\frac{784}{0.27}} \approx \sqrt{2900} \approx 53.86 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Next, the parachutist's velocity is \( v = 0.95 v_t \), so:

\[
v = 0.95 \cdot 53.86 \approx 51.17 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

To find the distance \( h \) traveled until \( v = 0.95 v_t \
