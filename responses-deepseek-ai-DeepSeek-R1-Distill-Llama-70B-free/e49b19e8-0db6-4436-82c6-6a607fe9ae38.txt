Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative. Hmm, I remember that Kant has different formulations of the categorical imperative, and the one mentioned here is the Humanity formulation. From what I've studied, that formulation is something like treating humanity as an end in itself and not just a means to an end.

The question is about the two general goals we're obligated to adopt. The first part says promoting the morally permissible ends of others. So, I think that's about helping others achieve their goals as long as those goals are morally acceptable. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the second part.

Wait, I remember that Kant talked about two main duties in this context. One was about promoting others' ends, which is like being benevolent and helping others. The other duty was about self-perfection. Oh right, self-perfection is about developing your own talents and abilities. Because if we treat humanity as an end, we should also work on ourselves to be the best version we can be, morally and in our abilities.

So looking at the options, the second part of the question is asking for the other goal alongside promoting others' ends. Let me go through the options:

A: increasing social status. That doesn't sound right. Kant's more about moral duties, not social standing.

B: self-perfection. Yeah, that rings a bell. It's about improving oneself.

C: achieving inner peace. Not sure, maybe more of a personal thing rather than a moral duty.

D: achieving personal goals. That's too vague and could include non-moral things.

E: promoting social harmony. That's more of a Utilitarian approach, maybe, but I'm not certain.

F: self-sacrifice. That's more of a virtue, but not exactly one of the two main goals.

G: maximizing personal benefits. No, that's more like egoism, which isn't Kantian.

H: producing happiness. Again, sounds Utilitarian, focusing on overall happiness.

I: attaining moral superiority. Doesn't sound right because Kant's about duty, not necessarily superiority.

So, the correct answer should be B: self-perfection. Because the two goals are promoting others' permissible ends and self-perfection.

The correct answer is based on Kant's Humanity formulation, which obligates us to treat humanity as an end in itself. This involves two main duties: promoting the morally permissible ends of others and pursuing self-perfection. Self-perfection refers to the development of one's talents and moral character.

Answer: B
