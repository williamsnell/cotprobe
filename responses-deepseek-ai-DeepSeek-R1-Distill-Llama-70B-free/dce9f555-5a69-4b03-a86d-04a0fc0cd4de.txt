Okay, so I've got this question about Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard and his definition of postmodernism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking what Lyotard's dictum means. The quote given is, "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives." I remember that meta-narratives are like big, overarching stories or theories that explain everything. Like, examples might be things like the Enlightenment's idea of progress, Marxism's class struggle leading to a communist utopia, or even religious narratives that explain the world.

So, Lyotard is saying that postmodernism is characterized by a skepticism or distrust of these grand narratives. That makes sense because postmodernism is all about questioning universals and embracing diversity and fragmentation instead.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Postmodernism disregards individual stories. Hmm, I don't think so. If anything, postmodernism focuses more on individual or local narratives rather than the big ones. So this might be the opposite.

B: Universal values are meaningless. Well, if meta-narratives are about universal values, then skepticism toward them would imply that those universals aren't accepted. So this seems possible. But let me think more.

C: Literature reproduces repression. I'm not sure where this comes from. Maybe some Marxist or feminist theory, but I don't recall this being directly tied to Lyotard's definition. Probably not the right choice.

D: The concept of truth is objective and undeniable. No, that sounds more like a modernist or Enlightenment view. Postmodernism is more about questioning objective truth, so this is the opposite.

E: The law is static. Not sure about this one. Law being static doesn't directly relate to meta-narratives. Maybe it's about grand theories of law, but I don't think this is the best fit.

F: Individual stories are suspect. Wait, if meta-narratives are big stories, then postmodernism is skeptical of them, but does that mean individual stories are suspect? Or does it mean that individual stories are now more emphasized? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the point is that without the big stories, individual ones are what's left, but the question is about the definition. So maybe F is not correct.

G: Postmodernism promotes the acceptance of all narratives. That doesn't sound right. If you're incredulous toward the big ones, it doesn't mean you accept all small ones. It's more about rejecting the big ones but maybe being critical of all, not necessarily accepting all.

H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. That might be too broad. While it does reject grand narratives which are authoritative, it might not reject all forms of authority entirely. Maybe some authorities are still accepted, but the big, universal ones aren't.

Wait, going back to option B: Universal values are meaningless. If meta-narratives are the big stories that underpin universal values, then being skeptical of them would mean those universal values lose their credibility. So B makes sense.

But let me think again. Lyotard's point is more about the decline of grand narratives, not necessarily that all universal values are meaningless. It's more that people no longer believe in these overarching stories, so the universal explanations don't hold. So B seems correct.

Alternatively, option F says individual stories are suspect. Wait, no. The quote is about meta-narratives, which are the big stories, not the individual ones. So the incredulity is toward the big ones, not the small ones. So F is the opposite; the individual stories aren't the target of suspicion, but rather the meta-narratives are.

So, to recap: the correct meaning is that universal meta-narratives are doubted, so the answer is B: Universal values are meaningless.

Wait, but another angle: does it mean that all universal values are meaningless, or just that the big stories that claim universality are no longer believed? So maybe it's more about the narratives rather than the values themselves. But the option B says universal values are meaningless, which aligns with the idea that if the narratives supporting them are distrusted, the values lose their foundation.

Alternatively, maybe option G is about accepting all narratives, but that doesn't fit because the incredulity is toward the meta, not necessarily accepting everything else.

I think I'm going to go with option B as the correct answer.

Lyotard's statement defines postmodernism as a skepticism toward meta-narratives, which are large, overarching explanations or theories that claim universality, such as the Enlightenment's idea of progress or Marxist class struggle. Postmodernism questions these grand narratives, implying that they are no longer credible. This skepticism suggests that the universal values these narratives support lose their foundation and become meaningless. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because postmodernism does not disregard individual stories; it focuses on them instead of grand narratives.
- **B** aligns with the idea that universal values, supported by meta-narratives, are no longer meaningful due to postmodern skepticism.
- **C** is unrelated to Lyotard's definition and more tied to other critical theories.
- **D** contradicts postmodernism, as it questions objective truth rather than affirming it.
- **E** is irrelevant to the definition of postmodernism.
- **F** is incorrect because postmodernism does not make individual stories suspect; it emphasizes them over meta-narratives.
- **G** is incorrect because postmodernism does not promote the acceptance of all narratives; it critically examines them.
- **H** is too broad, as postmodernism rejects grand narratives but not all forms of authority.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: Universal values are meaningless**.
