Question:

A shopper suffered injuries to her back and legs when she slipped on a loose piece of carpeting in a hallway connecting a department store and a cafeteria. The shopper brought suit against the owner of the entire building. The owner claimed that since he leased the cafeteria, he no longer retained any control over the connecting hallway. If the shopper offers into evidence the fact that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid, the court should rule that the evidence is

Options:

A: admissible, because it shows the owner's responsibility for maintaining safe conditions.
B: inadmissible, because the owner's actions after the accident do not pertain to the conditions at the time of the accident.
C: inadmissible, because it is evidence of a good deed by the owner after the accident.
D: inadmissible, because it is speculation about the owner's control over the hallway.
E: admissible, because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway.
F: admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.
G: admissible, because it demonstrates the owner's negligence in not maintaining the hallway previously.
H: admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.
I: inadmissible, because the evidence is irrelevant to the accident.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of certain actions taken after an accident. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a shopper was injured when she slipped on a loose piece of carpet in a hallway connecting a department store and a cafeteria. She's suing the owner of the building. The owner claims he leased the cafeteria and no longer controls the hallway. Now, the shopper wants to introduce evidence that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid.

The question is whether this evidence is admissible, and the options are from A to I.

Hmm, I remember that when it comes to evidence, subsequent remedial measures are generally not admissible to prove negligence. There's a rule about this. I think it's Federal Rule of Evidence 407. Let me recall what that says.

Rule 407 states that evidence of measures taken after an event is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. But there are exceptions. For example, the measures can be admissible for other purposes, like showing ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures if that's at issue.

In this case, the owner is claiming he didn't control the hallway because he leased the cafeteria. So the shopper is probably trying to show that the owner did have control, hence the evidence that the owner re-laid the carpet. If the owner took action on the hallway after the accident, that might indicate he had control over it, which would make him responsible for its maintenance.

So the evidence about the carpet being re-laid isn't being offered to show that the owner was negligent (like, "they fixed it so they must have been at fault"), but rather to show that the owner had control over the area, which is a key issue here.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's admissible because it shows responsibility for maintenance. But I think that's more about negligence, which might be excluded under 407.

Option B says inadmissible because it's after the accident. But wait, 407 allows for some exceptions, so just being after doesn't automatically make it inadmissible.

Option C says it's a good deed, so inadmissible. But I don't think that's the right reasoning. Good deeds isn't the main issue; it's about the purpose for which the evidence is offered.

Option D says it's speculation about control. Maybe, but if the owner did the work, it's more than speculationâ€”it's evidence of control.

Option E says admissible because it proves owner had the power to change the hallway. That sounds right. It's about control, not about negligence.

Option F says admissible because it shows ownership and control. Also seems relevant.

Option G says it shows negligence. That would be barred under 407, I think.

Option H says it's about the owner's knowledge. Not sure, but I don't see how re-laying the carpet shows prior knowledge of the condition.

Option I says it's irrelevant. But the control issue is definitely relevant.

So, the main point is whether the evidence is being used to show control, which is permissible. So looking back, the rule allows use for purposes like proving ownership or control.

Therefore, the correct options are either E or F. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: admissible because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway. That's about control.

Option F: admissible because it shows ownership and control. Both seem similar, but F mentions ownership and control, while E is about power to make changes.

Wait, the owner owns the building, so ownership isn't in question. The issue is control. So perhaps E is more precise. Or maybe F is correct because it's about both ownership and control.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E or F, but looking at the options again, the question is whether the evidence is admissible. So the reasoning is that it shows the owner had control, which is relevant. So the correct answer would be E or F.

Wait, the options:

E: admissible, because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway.

F: admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.

The owner is the owner of the entire building, so ownership isn't the issue. The issue is control over the hallway despite leasing the cafeteria. So the fact that he re-laid the carpet shows he had control over the hallway, which relates to his responsibility for maintenance.

So E is about the power to make changes, which indicates control. So E seems correct.

Alternatively, F says it shows retained ownership and control. Ownership is already established because he's the owner of the building. So maybe F is correct because it's about control.

I'm a bit torn between E and F.

Wait, the question is whether the evidence is admissible. So the reasoning is that the evidence is relevant to show that the owner had control over the hallway, which is a disputed issue. So F's reasoning is about ownership and control. But since ownership isn't the issue, perhaps the better answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct because it's about control, and the owner did have ownership. So the answer could be F.

Wait, the rule in 407 allows evidence of subsequent measures for certain purposes, like proving control or ownership. So the fact that the owner made the change shows he had control, which is relevant. So the evidence is admissible for that purpose.

Looking at the options again:

E: admissible because it proves the owner had the power to make changes (control).

F: admissible because it shows retained ownership and control.

So which is the better option? The key is that the owner's action shows he had control. So E seems to focus on the power to make changes, which is about control. F adds ownership, which is already established.

Therefore, the better answer is E.

Wait, but the options are:

A: admissible, because it shows the owner's responsibility for maintaining safe conditions. (This would be about negligence, so inadmissible under 407 unless for another purpose.)

E: admissible, because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway.

So E is correct because it's about control, which is a permissible use under FRE 407.

So the answer should be E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding subsequent remedial measures under Federal Rule of Evidence 407. The rule generally bars evidence of measures taken after an event to prove negligence or culpable conduct but allows such evidence for other purposes, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures.

In this case, the shopper seeks to admit evidence that the owner re-laid the hallway carpet two days after the accident. The owner claims he no longer controlled the hallway after leasing the cafeteria. The evidence is not being offered to prove negligence but rather to show that the owner retained control over the hallway, which is a key issue in determining responsibility.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the evidence might suggest responsibility for maintenance, its primary purpose here is to show control, not negligence.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The timing of the evidence (after the accident) does not automatically make it inadmissible; FRE 407 allows exceptions.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The evidence is not barred simply because it might be seen as a "good deed."
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The owner's action of re-laying the carpet is not mere speculation; it directly indicates control.
- **Option E**: Correct. The evidence is admissible because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway, which demonstrates control.
- **Option F**: Close but less precise. While it mentions ownership and control, ownership is already established, and the key issue is control.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The evidence is not being used to prove negligence, so this option misapplies the purpose of the evidence.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The evidence does not speak to the owner's prior knowledge of the unsafe condition.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The evidence is highly relevant to the issue of control, which is central to the case.

The best answer is **E**, as it focuses on the permissible purpose of proving the owner's control over the hallway.
