Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Thereupon it was declared by the above-mentioned representatives of the aforesaid King and Queen of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, etc., and of the aforesaid King of Portugal and the Algarves, etc.:
[I.] That, whereas a certain controversy exists between the said lords, their constituents, as to what lands, of all those discovered in the ocean sea up to the present day, the date of this treaty, pertain to each one of the said parts respectively; therefore, for the sake of peace and concord, and for the preservation of the relationship and love of the said King of Portugal for the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., it being the pleasure of their Highnesses, they, their said representatives, acting in their name and by virtue of their powers herein described, covenanted and agreed that a boundary or straight line be determined and drawn north and south, from pole to pole, on the said ocean sea, from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole. This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors. And all other lands, both islands and mainlands, found or to be found hereafter, discovered or to be discovered hereafter, which have been discovered or shall be discovered by the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., and by their vessels, on the western side of the said bound, determined as above, after having passed the said bound toward the west, in either its north or south latitude, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King and Queen of Castile, Leon, etc., and to their successors."
Treaty of Tordesillas, 1494
Which of the following inferences best explains the reason the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line?

Options:

A: The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism.
B: The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World.
C: The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.
D: The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Treaty of Tordesillas. Let me start by recalling what I know about this treaty. From what I remember, the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in 1494 between Spain and Portugal. It was about dividing the New World discoveries between the two powers. The key point was a demarcation line that split the world into two halves, with Spain getting the west and Portugal the east.

The question is asking why the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon (which I think refers to Spain) insisted on controlling the territory west of this line. The options are A through D, and I need to choose the best inference.

Looking at the provided text, it says that the treaty was made to resolve a controversy over which lands belonged to whom. The line was drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. Lands to the east (Portugal's side) and west (Spain's side) were each to be controlled by their respective countries.

So why did Spain want the west? Well, I remember that Spain sponsored Columbus's voyage, which led to the discovery of the Caribbean islands and the opening of the Americas. Spain was probably eager to claim these new lands for themselves, thinking they were rich in resources. They might have believed that the west held more promise for wealth, like gold, silver, and new trade routes.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The Spanish wanted to convert Barbary states to Catholicism. Barbary refers to North Africa, I think. That doesn't directly relate to the New World, so probably not the reason for the demarcation line in the west.

Option B: Spain thought Portugal didn't know about their New World discovery. That doesn't make much sense because the treaty itself was a reaction to both countries' explorations. Portugal had already made discoveries in Africa and the Atlantic, so Spain wouldn't assume they were unaware.

Option C: Spain wanted to preserve Native independence as a buffer. That seems unlikely. European powers at the time were more interested in colonization and resource extraction than in preserving native states. Plus, the treaty was about dividing claims, not about native policies.

Option D: Spain thought India was harder to conquer. Hmm, that's interesting. I know that the initial goal of Columbus was to reach Asia by a western route, thinking it would be easier than going around Africa, which the Portuguese were doing. If Spain believed that India (Asia) was harder to reach or conquer, they might focus on the New World instead. But wait, the Treaty of Tordesillas was after Columbus's first voyage in 1492. Spain had already started exploring the Caribbean and saw the potential there. So maybe they thought the west offered easier pickings than trying to go all the way to Asia. Or perhaps they thought that Portugal was focusing on the eastern route to Asia, so Spain would take the west for the Americas.

Wait, but the question is about why Spain insisted on the west. The treaty was a division to avoid conflict. So perhaps Spain knew that the west had new lands (the Americas) which Portugal might also try to claim. Alternatively, Spain might have thought that the west had more valuable territories than the eastern route, which was more about trade with Asia.

But looking at the options, D says they thought India would be harder to conquer. I'm not sure if that's the reason for wanting the west. Maybe Spain wanted the west because they had already found the Caribbean and saw the potential for riches there, whereas the eastern route was longer and more contested with Portugal's existing claims.

Wait, another angle: the Treaty of Tordesillas was a result of the competition between Spain and Portugal. Portugal had been exploring the African coast and had established trade routes there. Spain, after Columbus's voyage, wanted to secure the new lands in the west. So the reason Spain wanted the west was to claim the New World, which they had just discovered. But the options don't directly state that.

Looking at the options again, maybe D is the best fit. If Spain thought India was harder, they might focus on the New World instead. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Spanish believed that the west offered new lands that were easier to colonize than trying to reach and conquer India, which was further and already under various rulers.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is not D. Let me think again. The question is about the inference from the treaty text. The treaty says that the lands west of the line go to Spain. So why would Spain insist on that? It's because they wanted those lands, probably because they had discovered or expected to discover valuable territories there. Since Columbus had already found the Caribbean, Spain wanted to ensure they controlled those areas. But none of the options directly say that.

Looking at the options, perhaps D suggests that India was harder, so Spain focused on the west. But in reality, Spain's interest was in the New World, not avoiding India. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The Treaty of Tordesillas was an attempt to divide the newly discovered lands to prevent conflict. Spain wanted the west because they had already sent Columbus and were exploring there, while Portugal was focusing on Africa and the eastern route to Asia. So Spain wanted to protect their claims in the west. But the options don't directly mention Columbus or the New World.

The question is about the inference from the text. The text says that the treaty was made to settle the controversy over which lands belong to whom. So the inference is that Spain wanted the west because they had found something valuable there, but the options don't explicitly say that.

Alternatively, perhaps the Spanish thought that the west would give them easier access to Asia, but that doesn't seem right because Columbus thought he was near Asia.

Wait, maybe the answer is D. Because if Spain thought India was harder, they would focus on the west, which they saw as easier to colonize. So the inference is that Spain preferred the west because they believed the New World was easier to settle and exploit than trying to reach India, which was their original goal.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to eliminate the other options. Option A is about Barbary states, which are in Africa, not related to the New World. Option B is about Portugal not knowing, which doesn't make sense because the treaty was between both knowing parties. Option C is about preserving Native states, which doesn't fit the context of the treaty, which was about dividing territories between European powers. So the only plausible option left is D.

The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, divided the world into two hemispheres, with Spain controlling the west and Portugal the east. The question asks why the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon (Spain) insisted on controlling the territory west of the demarcation line. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This refers to converting Barbary states (North Africa) to Catholicism, which is unrelated to the New World or the treaty's purpose.  
- **Option B**: The idea that Spain thought Portugal was unaware of their discoveries is implausible, as the treaty itself was a response to both nations' explorations.  
- **Option C**: Preserving Native independence as a buffer against Portuguese expansion is unlikely, as European powers at the time were focused on colonization and resource extraction, not preserving native states.  
- **Option D**: This suggests Spain thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World. Given that Columbus's voyages had already revealed the Caribbean, Spain likely saw the west as easier to colonize and more promising for wealth compared to the challenges of reaching and conquering India via the eastern route.

The best inference is that Spain focused on the west because they believed it offered easier opportunities for colonization and resource extraction compared to the difficulties of conquering India. 

Answer: D
