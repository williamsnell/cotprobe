Okay, I'm presented with a multiple-choice question about psychology, specifically related to persuasion and attitude change. The question is about what happens when individuals are exposed to arguments against their views, which are then strongly refuted. I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given.

Let me break it down. The scenario is that someone's views are challenged with counterarguments, but then those arguments are refuted. So, the person hears opposing points but then sees those points being countered effectively. I remember something about this from my psychology classes. It was related to inoculation theory, I think.

Inoculation theory suggests that exposing people to a weakened form of opposing arguments and then refuting them can strengthen their resistance to future persuasion attempts. It's like giving them a vaccine against persuasion. So, if someone's beliefs are challenged but then they see those challenges being effectively countered, they become more resilient against future attempts to change their minds.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this concept. Let's go through them:

A: Make them more argumentative. That doesn't seem right. Being exposed to counterarguments doesn't necessarily make someone more argumentative in general. It might make them think more, but not necessarily more argumentative.

B: Make them more susceptible to opposing views. No, because the counterarguments were refuted. If anything, this would make them less susceptible, not more.

C: Weaken their resistance to later persuasive appeals. That's the opposite of what inoculation theory says. Inoculation should strengthen resistance, not weaken it.

D: Increase their attitudinal ambivalence. Ambivalence means having mixed feelings. If the counterarguments are refuted, maybe they become more confident, so ambivalence might decrease, not increase.

E: Strengthen their existing views. This sounds possible. If you refute opposing arguments, people might feel more confident in their original views. This could be correct, but I thought inoculation was more about resistance than strengthening.

F: Lead them to develop new, unrelated opinions. I don't see the connection here. The question is about their existing views, not developing new ones.

G: Render them indifferent. If their views are strengthened, they'd be less indifferent, not more.

H: Inoculate them against later persuasive appeals. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Inoculation makes them resistant to future persuasion.

I: Confuse them about their original beliefs. Refuting the arguments should clarify, not confuse. So probably not this.

J: Cause them to reject all future arguments. That's too extreme. Inoculation makes them resistant, but not to the point of rejecting all arguments without consideration.

So, the correct answer should be either E or H. Wait, the question says "arguments that are then strongly refuted." So, the process is exposure plus refutation. Inoculation is about exposing to weak counterarguments and then refuting them, which makes the person better equipped to handle stronger counterarguments in the future. So, the effect is to inoculate them against future persuasive appeals. That would make H the correct answer.

Alternatively, E is about strengthening their existing views. Both H and E could make sense, but I think H is more specific to the concept here. So, the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: inoculate them against later persuasive appeals. This is based on inoculation theory, which states that exposing individuals to counterarguments and then refuting them strengthens their resistance to future persuasion attempts.

Answer: H
