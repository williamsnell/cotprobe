Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the hydrogenation of ethylene, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The reaction is C2H4 + H2 → C2H6, and it's done in the presence of mercury vapor. The problem gives me a series of steps and asks me to determine the rate of formation of C2H6 in terms of the rate constants and concentrations of Hg, H2, and C2H4.

Let me look at the steps again:

1. Hg + H2 → Hg + 2H, with rate constant k1.
2. H + C2H4 → C2H5, with rate constant k2.
3. C2H5 + H2 → C2H6 + H, with rate constant k3.
4. H + H → H2, with rate constant k4.

The question says that H and C2H5 attain equilibrium. Hmm. So I think that means their concentrations are determined by an equilibrium between their formation and consumption.

Wait, but in reaction 2, H is being consumed to form C2H5. And reaction 3 is C2H5 reacting with H2 to form C2H6 and H. Also, reaction 4 is H combining to form H2. 

I guess I need to write the rate expressions for each step and then figure out the overall rate of C2H6 formation.

The overall rate of formation of C2H6 would be the rate of the third step, because that's where C2H6 is produced. So the rate for that step is rate = k3 [C2H5][H2]. Because the third step is C2H5 + H2 → C2H6 + H.

But wait, the question is about the overall rate in terms of the given concentrations [Hg], [H2], and [C2H4]. So I can't leave it in terms of [C2H5], because that's an intermediate. I need to express [C2H5] in terms of the other concentrations.

Since H and C2H5 are at equilibrium, maybe I should find their concentrations using the equilibrium approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the steady-state approximation, but the question says equilibrium, so I think it's an equilibrium situation.

Wait, but in the steps, H is produced in steps 1 and 3, consumed in steps 2 and 4. So for H, the rates of formation and consumption must balance.

Wait, but if H and C2H5 are at equilibrium, perhaps their formation equals their consumption.

Let me think about each species:

For H:
Formation comes from step 1 (Hg + H2 → 2H) and step 3 (C2H5 + H2 → C2H6 + H). So formation rate is k1 [Hg][H2] + k3 [C2H5][H2].

Consumption is from step 2 (H + C2H4 → C2H5) and step 4 (H + H → H2). So consumption rate is k2 [H][C2H4] + 2 k4 [H]^2. Wait, wait. Because step 4 is H + H → H2, so the rate is k4 [H]^2. So consumption for each H is k2 [H][C2H4] + 2 k4 [H]^2? Or wait, no—the rate of step 4 is k4 [H]^2, which consumes 2 H molecules. So when considering the rate of H consumption, step 4 contributes 2k4 [H]^2. Or perhaps I should think in terms of the rate of change of [H].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set the formation rate equal to the consumption rate for [H], assuming it's at equilibrium.

Formation rate of H:
From step 1: the reaction produces 2 H per reaction, so the rate for H formation is 2 k1 [Hg][H2].
From step 3: each reaction produces 1 H, so rate is k3 [C2H5][H2].

Consumption rate of H:
Step 2 consumes H at a rate of k2 [H][C2H4].
Step 4 consumes H at rate 2 k4 [H]^2 (because each reaction consumes 2 H's). Or wait, step 4 is H + H → H2, so the rate of H consumption is 2 times k4 [H]^2? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the rate of reaction 4 is k4 [H]^2, which tells us how fast H2 is formed. Each reaction 4 consumes two H atoms. So the rate of H consumption in step 4 is 2 * (k4 [H]^2) because each reaction uses two H's. So for each step 4 reaction, two H's are consumed. So the consumption rate of H is 2 k4 [H]^2.

Similarly, the consumption of H in step 2 is k2 [H][C2H4], since each reaction consumes one H.

Putting it together:

Formation rate = 2 k1 [Hg][H2] + k3 [C2H5][H2]
Consumption rate = k2 [H][C2H4] + 2 k4 [H]^2

At equilibrium, formation = consumption:
2 k1 [Hg][H2] + k3 [C2H5][H2] = k2 [H][C2H4] + 2 k4 [H]^2.

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can find [H] in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can also consider the equilibrium for C2H5. Wait, the problem says H and C2H5 attain equilibrium. So perhaps their concentrations are determined by the equilibrium between their formation and consumption.

Wait, but for C2H5, the formation is from step 2: H + C2H4 → C2H5, so the rate is k2 [H][C2H4].

The consumption of C2H5 is from step 3: C2H5 + H2 → C2H6 + H, so the rate is k3 [C2H5][H2].

So for C2H5, at equilibrium, the rate of formation equals rate of consumption:

k2 [H][C2H4] = k3 [C2H5][H2]

So I can solve for [C2H5] as:

[C2H5] = (k2 [H][C2H4]) / (k3 [H2])

That's useful because earlier, the rate of C2H6 formation is k3 [C2H5][H2], and substituting [C2H5] from this equation would give:

rate = k3 * (k2 [H][C2H4]/k3 [H2]) ) * [H2] = k2 [H][C2H4]

Wait, that's interesting. So the rate of C2H6 formation would then be k2 [H][C2H4]. But wait, that leaves the rate in terms of [H], which is an intermediate. I need to express it in terms of [Hg], [H2], and [C2H4].

So I need to find [H] in terms of the given concentrations.

Going back to the equilibrium for H. Earlier, I had:

2 k1 [Hg][H2] + k3 [C2H5][H2] = k2 [H][C2H4] + 2 k4 [H]^2.

But from the C2H5 equilibrium, [C2H5] = (k2 [H][C2H4])/(k3 [H2])

Substituting that back into the H equation:

2 k1 [Hg][H2] + k3 * (k2 [H][C2H4]/(k3 [H2])) * [H2] = k2 [H][C2H4] + 2 k4 [H]^2.

Simplify this equation.

The second term in the left side: k3 multiplied by [C2H5] which is (k2 [H][C2H4]/(k3 [H2])) and multiplied by [H2], so:

k3 * (k2 [H][C2H4]/(k3 [H2])) ) * [H2] = k3 * (k2 [H][C2H4] [H2])/(k3 [H2])) ) 

The [H2] cancels out, and k3 cancels with denominator, leaving k2 [H][C2H4].

So the entire left side becomes:

2 k1 [Hg][H2] + k2 [H][C2H4] = right side: k2 [H][C2H4] + 2 k4 [H]^2.

Subtracting k2 [H][C2H4] from both sides:

2 k1 [Hg][H2] = 2 k4 [H]^2.

Divide both sides by 2:

k1 [Hg][H2] = k4 [H]^2.

So solving for [H]^2:

[H]^2 = (k1 [Hg][H2]) / k4.

Take square root:

[H] = sqrt( (k1 [Hg][H2]) / k4 )

So [H] = sqrt( (k1 [Hg][H2]) / k4 ).

Now, going back to the rate of C2H6 formation, which earlier was found to be k2 [H][C2H4].

Substituting [H] into this:

rate = k2 * sqrt( (k1 [Hg][H2]) / k4 ) * [C2H4]

Which can be written as:

rate = k2 [C2H4] * sqrt( (k1 [Hg][H2]) / k4 )

Which is the same as:

k2 [C2H4] * sqrt( (k1 [Hg][H2]) / k4 ) = k2 [C2H4] * sqrt( k1 [Hg][H2] / k4 )

Hmm, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this expression.

Looking at options:

A: k3 [C2H6] [...] → No, because rate shouldn't involve [C2H6], which is a product.

B: k3 [C2H4] [...] → Wait, our rate expression has k2, not k3.

C: k3 [C2H5] [...] → No, because we substituted [C2H5].

D: k2 [C2H4] [(k1[Hg][H2]) /k4 ]^1/2 → Yes! Because that's exactly what I have.

E: k2 [C2H4] [(k1[Hg][H2])^2 /k4 ]^1/2 → That would be same as (k1[Hg][H2]) / sqrt(k4), but our expression is sqrt(k1[Hg][H2]/k4), so same as (k1[Hg][H2]/k4)^1/2. So E would have [k1^2 ...]^1/2, which is k1. So E is k2 [C2H4] * (k1 [Hg][H2]^2 /k4 )^1/2 → No, that's different.

Wait, let me check:

Option D is [ (k1 [Hg][H2])/k4 ]^0.5, multiplied by k2 [C2H4].

Which is exactly what I have. So option D is the correct one.

But wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, in the H equilibrium equation, I had:

2k1 [Hg][H2] + k3 [C2H5][H2] = k2 [H][C2H4] + 2k4 [H]^2.

Then I substituted [C2H5] = (k2 [H][C2H4])/(k3 [H2]).

Plugging that in:

2k1 [Hg][H2] + k3 * (k2 [H][C2H4]/(k3 [H2])) * [H2] = ... 

Which simplifies to 2k1 [Hg][H2] + k2 [H][C2H4] = k2 [H][C2H4] + 2k4 [H]^2.

Yes, that's correct. Then subtracting gives 2k1 [Hg][H2] = 2k4 [H]^2 → [H]^2 = (k1 [Hg][H2])/k4. So [H] = sqrt( k1 [Hg][H2]/k4 )

Then, the rate of C2H6 is k3 [C2H5][H2], but [C2H5] is from equilibrium: [C2H5] = (k2 [H][C2H4])/(k3 [H2]).

So substituting into rate:

k3 * (k2 [H][C2H4]/(k3 [H2])) ) * [H2] = k2 [H][C2H4].

Yes, that's correct. Then substituting [H], we get k2 [C2H4] * sqrt( k1 [Hg][H2]/k4 )

Which is exactly option D: k2 [C2H4] * sqrt( (k1 [Hg][H2])/k4 )

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the rate of formation of C₂H₆ in terms of the given concentrations [Hg], [H₂], and [C₂H₄], we analyze the reaction steps and equilibria:

1. **Step 1**: Hg + H₂ → Hg + 2H, with rate constant \(k_1\).  
2. **Step 2**: H + C₂H₄ → C₂H₅, with rate constant \(k_2\).  
3. **Step 3**: C₂H₅ + H₂ → C₂H₆ + H, with rate constant \(k_3\).  
4. **Step 4**: H + H → H₂, with rate constant \(k_4\).

The problem specifies that H and C₂H₅ are at equilibrium. This means their rates of formation and consumption are balanced.

### Step 1: Rate of C₂H₆ formation
The rate of C₂H₆ formation occurs in Step 3:  
\[
\text{Rate of C₂H₆ formation} = k_3 [C₂H₅][H₂].
\]  
However, [C₂H₅] is an intermediate and must be expressed in terms of the given concentrations.

### Step 2: Equilibrium for C₂H₅
From Step 2, the formation of C₂H₅ is:  
\[
\text{Formation of C₂H₅} = k_2 [H][C₂H₄].
\]  
From Step 3, the consumption of C₂H₅ is:  
\[
\text{Consumption of C₂H₅} = k_3 [C₂H₅][H₂].
\]  
At equilibrium:  
\[
k_2 [H][C₂H₄] = k_3 [C₂H₅][H₂].
\]  
Solving for [C₂H₅]:  
\[
[C₂H₅] = \frac{k_2 [H][C₂H₄]}{k_3 [H₂]}.
\]

### Step 3: Substituting [C₂H₅] into the rate of C₂H₆ formation
Substitute [C₂H₅] into the rate expression for C₂H₆:  
\[
\text{Rate of C₂H₆ formation} = k_3 \left(\frac{k_2 [H][C₂H₄]}{k_3 [H₂]}\right)[H₂].
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
\text{Rate of C₂H₆ formation} = k_2 [H][C₂H₄].
\]

### Step 4: Equilibrium for H
From Step 1, H is formed at a rate:  
\[
\text{Formation of H} = 2k_1 [Hg][H₂].
\]  
From Step 2, H is consumed at a rate:  
\[
\text{Consumption of H} = k_2 [H][C₂H₄].
\]  
From Step 4, H is consumed at a rate:  
\[
\text{Consumption of H} = 2k_4 [H]^2.
\]  
At equilibrium:  
\[
2k_1 [Hg][H₂] = k_2 [H][C₂H₄] + 2k_4 [H]^2.
\]  
Rearrange to solve for [H]:  
\[
[H]^2 = \frac{k_1 [Hg][H₂]}{k_4}.
\]  
\[
[H] = \sqrt{\frac{k_1 [Hg][H₂]}{k_4}}.
\]

### Step 5: Substituting [H] into the rate of C₂H₆ formation
Substitute [H] into the rate expression for C₂H₆:  
\[
\text{Rate of C₂H₆ formation} = k_2 [C₂H₄] \sqrt{\frac{k_1 [Hg][H₂]}{k_4}}.
\]

### Final Expression
The rate of C₂H₆ formation is:  
\[
\text{Rate} = k_2 [C₂H₄] \sqrt{\frac{k_1 [Hg][H₂]}{k_4}}.
\]

### Matching with Options
This matches **Option D**:  
\[
k_2 [C₂H₄] \left(\frac{k_1 [Hg][H₂]}{k_4}\right)^{1/2}.
\]

ANSWER: D
