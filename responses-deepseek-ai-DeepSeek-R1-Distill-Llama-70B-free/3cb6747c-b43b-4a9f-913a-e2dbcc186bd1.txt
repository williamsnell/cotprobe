Okay, so I've got this accounting problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about preparing a balance sheet for Silvertown Office Supplies. The owner is C.H. Walters, and the date is April 30th of the current year. They've given me a list of account balances, and I need to find the total assets from the options provided.

First, I remember that a balance sheet has three main parts: assets, liabilities, and equity. The formula is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. But since the question only asks for total assets, I might not need to worry about liabilities and equity unless they factor into calculating the assets.

Looking at the information provided, I see a list of items which I think are all assets and some liabilities. Let me list them out:

- Cash: $3,390
- Notes Receivable: $2,905
- Accounts Receivable: $8,215
- Merchandise Inventory: $23,600
- Store Supplies: $720
- Store Fixtures: $2,895
- Furniture and Equipment: $5,600
- Notes Payable: $5,250
- Accounts Payable: $4,800

Wait, but Notes Payable and Accounts Payable are liabilities, right? Because they represent what the company owes. So when calculating total assets, I should only sum up the asset accounts.

Let me separate them. The asset accounts here are:

1. Cash
2. Notes Receivable
3. Accounts Receivable
4. Merchandise Inventory
5. Store Supplies
6. Store Fixtures
7. Furniture and Equipment

The liabilities are Notes Payable and Accounts Payable, so I can ignore those for the total assets calculation.

Now, I need to add up all the asset values:

Let me list the numbers:

- Cash: 3,390
- Notes Receivable: 2,905
- Accounts Receivable: 8,215
- Merchandise Inventory: 23,600
- Store Supplies: 720
- Store Fixtures: 2,895
- Furniture and Equipment: 5,600

I'll add them step by step.

Start with Cash and Notes Receivable: 3,390 + 2,905 = 6,295.

Next, add Accounts Receivable: 6,295 + 8,215 = 14,510.

Then Merchandise Inventory: 14,510 + 23,600 = 38,110.

Add Store Supplies: 38,110 + 720 = 38,830.

Store Fixtures: 38,830 + 2,895 = 41,725.

Furniture and Equipment: 41,725 + 5,600 = 47,325.

Wait, so the total assets sum up to $47,325. Let me double-check in case I made a mistake in adding.

Let me add them again:

3,390 (Cash)
+2,905 = 6,295
+8,215 = 14,510
+23,600 = 38,110
+720 = 38,830
+2,895 = 41,725
+5,600 = 47,325.

Yes, that seems correct. So the total assets are $47,325.

Looking at the options, I see option H says "Total assets 47,325." So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the total assets for Silvertown Office Supplies as of April 30, we sum all the asset accounts provided:

1. **Cash**: $3,390  
2. **Notes Receivable**: $2,905  
3. **Accounts Receivable**: $8,215  
4. **Merchandise Inventory**: $23,600  
5. **Store Supplies**: $720  
6. **Store Fixtures**: $2,895  
7. **Furniture and Equipment**: $5,600  

Adding these together:  
$3,390 + $2,905 = $6,295  
$6,295 + $8,215 = $14,510  
$14,510 + $23,600 = $38,110  
$38,110 + $720 = $38,830  
$38,830 + $2,895 = $41,725  
$41,725 + $5,600 = $47,325  

Thus, the total assets amount to **$47,325**. The correct option is **H**.

Answer: H
