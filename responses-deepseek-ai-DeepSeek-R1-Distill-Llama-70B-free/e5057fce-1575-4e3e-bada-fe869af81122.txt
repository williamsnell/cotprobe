Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Paley's argument. Hmm, Paley is known for the watchmaker analogy, right? I remember he compared the complexity of a watch to the complexity of nature, arguing that just as a watch implies a watchmaker, the complexity in nature implies a designer, like God.

The question is about the key difference between the "contrivance" of a watch and that of nature according to Paley. The options are A to J. Let me think about what Paley actually said.

In Paley's argument, he uses the watch as an example of something that clearly shows design because it's man-made. Nature, on the other hand, is more complex and grand. So the main difference he points out isn't about complexity or size, but rather the origin. The watch is made by humans, while natural things are not—they're made by a divine being.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Dependent on human intervention. That might not be the main point. Watches are made by humans, but nature isn't. So maybe, but let me check others.

Option B: More natural. That seems vague. Nature is natural, but that's not the key difference he's emphasizing.

Option C: Smaller and less complex. No, Paley argues that nature is more complex, so this is the opposite.

Option D: Simpler. No, nature is more complex.

Option E: More easily understood. I don't think that's it. Watches are understandable because we make them, but nature is more complex, so maybe harder.

Option F: Greater and grander. Yes, Paley does say that natural contrivances are greater and more complex than human-made ones. But is that the key difference he's pointing out in terms of their origin?

Wait, the question is about the "key difference" in their contrivance. Paley's main point is that both show evidence of design, but the difference is in their origin. So the watch is made by humans, while nature is made by a higher being.

So looking back, option H says "not created by human hands." That fits because the watch is created by humans, while natural contrivances are not. So the key difference Paley points out is that nature's contrivances are not human-made, implying a divine designer.

So the answer should be H.

The question asks about the key difference Paley identifies between the contrivance of a watch and that of nature. Paley's argument hinges on the idea that both the watch and natural phenomena exhibit design, but the origin differs. The watch is a human-made object, while natural contrivances are not created by human hands, implying a divine designer. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While watches depend on human intervention, Paley's focus is on the origin, not dependency.
- **B**: Incorrect. "More natural" is vague and not the key difference Paley emphasizes.
- **C**: Incorrect. Nature is not smaller or less complex; Paley argues the opposite.
- **D**: Incorrect. Nature is not simpler; it is more complex.
- **E**: Incorrect. Nature is not more easily understood; it is more complex.
- **F**: Partially correct but not the key difference. Paley notes nature's grandeur but emphasizes its non-human origin.
- **G**: Incorrect. Paley does not suggest nature is less functional.
- **H**: Correct. The key difference is that nature's contrivances are not created by human hands, implying a divine designer.
- **I**: Incorrect. While nature changes, this is not the key difference Paley highlights.
- **J**: Incorrect. Age is not the key difference.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: not created by human hands**.

Answer: H
