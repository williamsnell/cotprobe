Okay, so I've got this question here about which person is likely to live the longest based on their race and gender, assuming all other factors are equal. Hmm, I remember that life expectancy can vary among different demographic groups, so I need to think about what the general trends are.

I think I've heard that, on average, women tend to live longer than men. So that might narrow it down. Looking at the options, the choices with women are A, C, G, H, J. The rest are men, so probably one of the women is the answer.

Now, considering race. I'm not entirely sure about all the specifics, but I recall that Asian populations often have higher life expectancies. Like, countries such as Japan and Singapore have some of the highest life expectancies in the world. So an Asian woman might be the one here.

Looking at the options again, J is an Asian woman. So maybe that's the answer. But wait, I should consider other factors. I think Hispanic people sometimes have a longer life expectancy than other groups, a phenomenon sometimes called the "Hispanic paradox." But I'm not sure if that applies more to men or women. Also, I remember that Black women might have lower life expectancies compared to white women, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: in the US, I think the highest life expectancy is among Asian women. White women would be next, then Hispanic, then Black. But I might be mixing things up. Wait, I think the order from highest to lowest for women is Asian, Hispanic, White, Native American, Black? Or is it different? Also, I should remember that these are general statistics and can vary based on many factors like socioeconomic status, lifestyle, etc., but the question states all other things are equal, so it's purely based on race and gender.

So putting it together, if J is an Asian woman, that's probably the top. Let me check the options again. The choices are A (Black woman), C (White woman), G (Hispanic woman), H (Native American woman), J (Asian woman). So yes, I think J is the correct answer.

The question asks which person is likely to live the longest based on race and gender, assuming all other factors are equal. Life expectancy generally varies by demographic groups, with women typically living longer than men. Among women, Asian women often have the highest life expectancy, as seen in countries like Japan and Singapore. Considering the options provided, the highest life expectancy is likely for an Asian woman.

Answer: J
