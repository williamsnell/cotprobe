Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about correlations, and I'm a bit rusty on my understanding. Let's see what it's asking.

The problem says that the correlation between two variables is r = 0.19. Then, we make some changes: add 0.23 to all x-values, double every y-value, and interchange the variables. I need to find the new correlation.

Hmm, I remember that correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The formula for Pearson's r comes into play here. I think Pearson's r is scale-invariant, meaning that adding a constant or multiplying by a constant doesn't change the correlation. Wait, but wait—is that right?

Wait, when you add a constant to all x-values (like adding 0.23 to every x), that shifts the data but doesn't affect the relative distances between the data points. So, the standard deviation of x should stay the same because it's just a shift. The same goes for the y-values being doubled—multiplying by a constant would change the standard deviation, but since both variables are involved in the correlation, maybe that scaling cancels out. Oh wait, no. Wait, the formula for Pearson's r is based on the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations. 

So, let's think about each change. 

First, adding a constant (like 0.23) to each x. Adding a constant doesn't change the standard deviation of x because it's just shifting all points equally. So, the variability in x remains the same. Also, since it's a shift, the covariance between x and y might change? Or not? Wait, no, because covariance is based on how x and y vary together. Adding a constant to x would actually not affect the covariance because covariance measures the joint variability. Let me think again. The covariance formula is E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]. If I add a constant 'a' to X, then X becomes X + a. So, E[X + a] = E[X] + a. So (X + a - (E[X] + a)) = X - E[X]. So the term (X - E[X]) doesn't change. So covariance remains the same. Therefore, adding a constant to x doesn't affect covariance. Similarly, scaling x by a constant would affect covariance. So, in this case, adding 0.23 to x doesn't change the covariance, so it doesn't affect the correlation.

Wait, but what about scaling the y variable. If every y is doubled, then the standard deviation of y would double. But since Pearson's r is covariance(X,Y) divided by (std(X)*std(Y)), if std(Y) doubles, and covariance(X,Y) doubles (because Y is doubled), then the ratio would stay the same. Let me check: suppose original covariance is Cov(X,Y), and after scaling Y by 2, covariance becomes Cov(X, 2Y) = 2 Cov(X,Y). Std(Y) becomes 2 std(Y). So the new r would be [2 Cov(X,Y)] / [std(X) * 2 std(Y)] = same as before. So scaling Y doesn't change r either.

Wait, but in this problem, after adding 0.23 to x and doubling y, we interchange the variables. So the new X becomes the old Y (after scaling), and the new Y becomes the old X (after adding 0.23). So the variables are swapped.

So, what's the correlation between X' and Y'? Well, originally, r was between X and Y, which is 0.19. After swapping, the correlation becomes the same as the original because correlation is symmetric. So r(X', Y') = r(Y, X) = same as r(X,Y) because correlation is symmetric. So it would still be 0.19.

Wait, but that's only if the transformations don't affect the correlation. Because adding a constant and scaling doesn't change the correlation. So the swapping wouldn't change it either. So the new correlation should be the same as the old one, 0.19.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.19. So the answer should be J.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's go through each step again.

1. Adding 0.23 to all x: doesn't affect correlation.
2. Multiplying all y by 2: doesn't affect correlation.
3. Swapping x and y: correlation remains same because r is symmetric.

So yes, the new correlation is still 0.19.
</think>

The problem involves analyzing how specific transformations affect the correlation between two variables. Initially, the correlation is given as \( r = 0.19 \). The transformations include:

1. **Adding 0.23 to all \( x \)-values**: Adding a constant to a variable does not change its standard deviation or the covariance between the variables. Therefore, this transformation does not affect the correlation.

2. **Doubling all \( y \)-values**: Multiplying a variable by a constant scales its standard deviation by that constant. However, since Pearson's correlation coefficient (\( r \)) is the ratio of covariance to the product of standard deviations, doubling \( y \) doubles both the covariance and the standard deviation of \( y \), leaving \( r \) unchanged.

3. **Interchanging the variables**: Correlation is symmetric, meaning \( r(X, Y) = r(Y, X) \). Swapping the variables does not alter the correlation.

Since none of these transformations affect the correlation, the new correlation remains the same as the original, \( r = 0.19 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 0.19**
