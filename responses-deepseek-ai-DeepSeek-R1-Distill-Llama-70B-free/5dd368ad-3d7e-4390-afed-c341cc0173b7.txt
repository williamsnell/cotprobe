Okay, so I've got this problem here about hikers moving from Salt Flats to Talon Bluff, and I need to find the difference in elevation between these two points. Hmm, let's see. The elevation at Salt Flats is −55 feet, and Talon Bluff is at 620 feet. I'm a bit confused about how to calculate the difference when one is negative and the other is positive. Wait, elevation difference is just the absolute change, right? So I think I should subtract the lower elevation from the higher one.

Wait, but subtraction with negative numbers can be tricky. Let me think. If I have a starting point at -55 and go up to 620, the total climb would be the sum of the absolute values because I'm going from below sea level to above. So that's like adding 55 feet to get back to sea level and then adding 620 feet on top of that. Oh wait, no, because the change is from -55 to 620. So the difference would be 620 minus (-55), which is the same as 620 +55. Let me do the math: 620 +55 is 675. So the difference should be 675 feet.

Now looking at the options, option C is 675, so that's probably the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes elevation differences can be a bit confusing. So if you start at -55 and go up to 620, the total elevation gained is 620 - (-55) = 675. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.

The difference in elevation is calculated by subtracting the lower elevation from the higher elevation. Starting at -55 feet and moving to 620 feet, the total elevation gain is 620 - (-55) = 675 feet.

C: 675 feet

Answer: C
