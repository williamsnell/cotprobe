Question:

A woman sued her former employer in state court, asserting age and sex discrimination claims under both state and federal law. The woman's attorney had recently been embarrassed in court by the judge to whom the case was assigned. Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?

Options:

A: Retain the case, because the employer's attorney did not provide sufficient reasons for remand.
B: Remand the entire case.
C: Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.
D: Retain the case, because the woman's attorney has a valid concern about possible bias in state court.
E: Retain the case, as federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims.
F: Retain the case, as the employer's attorney has not objected to the removal.
G: Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.
H: Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about federal court jurisdiction and removal. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a woman who sued her employer in state court, claiming age and sex discrimination under both state and federal laws. The woman's attorney wants to remove the case to federal court because he was embarrassed by the judge assigned to the case. He wants to avoid difficulties with that judge. So he removes the case promptly, and the employer's attorney moves for remand. The question is how the federal court will proceed.

First, I need to recall the rules about removal. Removal is a procedure where a defendant can move a case from state court to federal court if certain conditions are met. The main reasons for removal are diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction.

In this case, the attorney is using federal-question jurisdiction as the basis. Federal question jurisdiction applies when the case involves a question of federal law. Since the woman is asserting claims under federal law (age and sex discrimination), that seems to fit.

But wait, I remember that for removal, there's a 30-day deadline. The plaintiff's attorney removed the case promptly, so the timing is okay. But another point is whether the case was initially removable. The initial complaint was in state court, and I think that state courts can also hear federal claims, right? So the defendant can remove it if it's a federal question case.

So the employer's attorney moves to remand. The federal court has to decide whether to keep the case or send it back.

I also recall that when a case is removed, the federal court can remand it back if it lacks subject matter jurisdiction or if the removal was improper. The key here is whether the case was properly removed. The attorney's reason for removal was to avoid a difficult judge. But is that a valid reason? Or does it not matter why they removed it, as long as the jurisdictional basis is correct?

Wait, but the jurisdictional basis is federal question. So if the complaint includes federal claims, the defendant can remove it. But there's another consideration: whether the state court is a proper forum. But I think that the reason for removal doesn't affect the jurisdiction; the court looks at whether the case meets the criteria, not the motivations behind the removal.

So in this case, since the case involves federal claims, the federal court has jurisdiction. Therefore, the federal court would retain the case. But wait, is there any exception?

I remember something about the "well-pleaded complaint rule." The federal issue must be presented in the plaintiff's complaint. Since the woman is asserting federal claims, that's a basis for federal jurisdiction.

Another point: when a case is removed, the federal court can hear both the federal claims and any state law claims that are part of the same case or controversy under supplemental jurisdiction. So the entire case would stay in federal court.

Wait, but the employer is moving to remand. Why would they do that? Maybe the employer thinks removal wasn't proper. But if the case was removable, then the federal court should retain it.

Looking at the options:

Option B says remand the entire case. Why? Maybe because the removal was done for an improper purpose, but I don't think the reason for removal affects jurisdiction. The court doesn't consider the attorney's motivations, just whether the case is removable.

Option C suggests retaining the case to avoid bias, but I think federal courts don't consider that as a basis to retain the case. The reason for removal is separate from the jurisdictional decision.

Option D says retain because the attorney has a valid concern about bias. Again, I don't think the federal court's decision is based on the attorney's fears; it's based on whether the case was properly removed.

Option E says retain because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims. Wait, no, federal courts don't have exclusive jurisdiction over all federal claims. Many can be heard in state courts as well. So this might not be correct.

Option G: retain because it was timely removed and federal claims are alleged. That sounds right because the case was properly removed within the time limit and involves federal questions.

Option H: remand the state claims but keep the federal. But I think once removed, the entire case comes to federal court, including state claims under supplemental jurisdiction. So the court wouldn't split the claims unless there's a reason, but the employer is moving to remand the whole case.

Option A: retain because employer didn't give reasons. The employer's motion to remand would have to state reasons, but if they didn't, but in this case, I suppose the employer would argue that removal was improper. But if the case was removable, then the court would retain it regardless.

So the correct answer is likely B or G. Wait, no, if it was properly removed, the federal court retains it. So G says retain because timely and federal claims. So option G would be correct. But wait, another point: when a case is removed, the federal court can only remand if it doesn't have jurisdiction or the removal was procedurally defective.

In this scenario, the case was timely removed and based on federal question. So the court has jurisdiction and should retain it.

Looking back at the options, G says retain because it was timely removed and federal claims. So G seems correct.

Wait, but another consideration: the plaintiff's attorney is trying to avoid a biased judge. But if the state court has a biased judge, that's a different issue. The federal court can't take the case just because of that; they have to look at jurisdiction.

So the correct answer is G. So the federal court retains the case because it has jurisdiction over the federal claims and the removal was timely.

But wait, let me think about whether the fact that the state court also has jurisdiction over the federal claims affects this. Since both federal and state courts can hear the claims, the defendant can choose to remove. So the federal court has jurisdiction and the case was properly removed.

So the answer should be G.

The question revolves around whether a federal court will retain a case removed from state court based on federal-question jurisdiction. The woman's attorney removed the case to avoid a potentially biased judge, and the employer's attorney has moved to remand. The key issue is whether the federal court has jurisdiction and whether the removal was proper.

Under federal law, removal is proper if the case involves a federal question, and the removal is timely. Here, the woman alleged federal claims (age and sex discrimination), providing a basis for federal-question jurisdiction. The removal was also prompt, satisfying the procedural requirements. While the attorney's motivation to avoid a biased judge is not a jurisdictional issue, the federal court's decision to retain the case depends on whether it has jurisdiction, not the reason for removal.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B**: Remanding the entire case would only occur if the federal court lacked jurisdiction or the removal was procedurally defective. Since the case was timely removed and involves federal claims, this is incorrect.
- **Option C and D**: Retaining the case to avoid bias or because of the attorney's concerns is not a valid jurisdictional reason. The court does not consider the attorney's motivations in its jurisdictional decision.
- **Option E**: Federal courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over all federal claims; state courts can also hear them. Thus, this is incorrect.
- **Option G**: This is correct because the case was timely removed and involves federal claims, giving the federal court jurisdiction.
- **Option H**: The federal court would not split the case by remanding state claims and retaining federal claims unless there was a specific reason, which is not indicated here.

Since the removal was proper and the federal court has jurisdiction, the correct answer is:

**G: Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.**

Answer: G
