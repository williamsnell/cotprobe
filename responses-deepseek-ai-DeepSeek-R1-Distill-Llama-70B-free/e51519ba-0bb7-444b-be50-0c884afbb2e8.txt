Okay, so I have this problem about insurance costs, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Montgomery's Department Store insured a building for $30,000 at a rate of $2.50 per $1,000. The questions are: what's the cost for three consecutive one-year policies, what's the cost for a three-year policy, and what's the difference between the two.

Hmm, I think I should break it down. First, calculate the annual premium for one year, then see what three years of one-year policies would cost, then see if a three-year policy is cheaper or different, and find the difference.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify if the three-year policy has a different rate. Maybe the rate stays the same, so a three-year policy would just be three times the annual premium. But wait, sometimes longer policies might have discounts. Oh, but the problem doesn't mention any discount, so I think I shouldn't assume that. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the rate is the same each year.

So, the insured amount is $30,000. The rate is $2.50 per $1,000. So per $1,000, the cost is $2.50. So for $30,000, how many thousands are there in 30,000? Well, 30,000 divided by 1,000 is 30. So the annual premium is 30 times $2.50.

Let me calculate that. 30 * 2.50. Hmm, 30 times 2 is 60, and 30 times 0.5 is 15, so together 75. So each year's premium is $75.

Now, for three consecutive one-year policies, that would be 3 times $75. So 3 * 75 equals $225. So the cost for three one-year policies is $225.

What about a three-year policy? If the rate is the same each year, then it's also 3 times $75. So that would also be $225. Wait, but that would make the difference zero, but looking at the options, I don't see zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe the three-year policy is calculated differently. Oh, perhaps the rate is applied once for the total coverage over three years. Or maybe the rate is per year, so the three-year policy's total cost is 3 times the annual rate. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think again. The rate is $2.50 per $1,000 per year. So each year, the cost is $75, as I calculated. So whether it's a one-year or three-year policy, the total cost would be the same if the rate doesn't change. So for three years, that's 3 * 75 = $225 either way. So the difference between the two would be zero.

But that's not among the options. The options are from A to J, and I don't see a zero. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.

Wait, the question says "three consecutive one-year policies." So that's three separate one-year policies, each costing $75. So total is $225.

Then, what about a single three-year policy? Maybe the way the rate is applied is different. Wait, perhaps the rate is a one-time fee for three years. No, that doesn't make sense because the rate is per $1,000 per year. So maybe the three-year policy is also $2.50 per $1,000 each year. So same as before, 3 * (30,000/1,000 * 2.50) = same $225.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is calculated as 2.5 per 1000 for the entire three years, but that would be 2.5*3 = 7.5 per 1000. So for 30,000, that's 30 *7.5 = 225. So same result.

Hmm, but then the difference would be zero. But the options don't include zero. So perhaps I'm missing a detail here. Maybe the three-year policy has a different rate. But the problem states the rate is $2.50 per $1,000. It doesn't mention any change for longer terms. So perhaps the cost is the same, making the difference zero, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options: A is 100, B 67.50, C 202.50, D 225, E 90, F 250, G 22.50, H 150, I 270, J 75.

Wait, the options are for each of the questions. The first part is three one-year policies, which we calculated as $225, which is option D. The second part is the cost for a three-year policy, which I thought is also $225, but that's the same as D. But that can't be, because the question asks for the difference. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is cheaper because it's a longer term. But the problem doesn't state that. So maybe the three-year policy is calculated as a single payment, but the rate applies per year. So for each year, it's $75, so three years would be $225. Same as the three one-year policies.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate.

The insured amount is $30,000. The rate is $2.50 per $1,000. So per $1,000, the annual premium is $2.50. So 30,000 is 30 times 1,000, so 30 * 2.50 = 75. So each year is $75. Three years would be 75 *3 = 225. So three one-year policies would cost $225, and a three-year policy would also cost $225. So the difference is zero.

But the options don't have zero. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is at a different rate, maybe a discounted rate. But the problem states that the rate is $2.50 per $1,000. So no discount mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is a single payment, so the calculation is 30,000 * 2.50 /1000, but multiplied by 3? No, that would be 75*3=225 again.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is calculated as 2.5 per 1000 per year, so 30 * 2.5 *3 = 225. Still the same.

Wait, maybe the three-year policy is calculated as a flat rate for three years, so 2.5 *3 = 7.5 per 1000. So 30,000 is 30*1000, so 30 *7.5 = 225. So still same.

Hmm, I'm stuck because according to my calculations, both options cost $225, making the difference zero, but that's not an option. So perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, what is the cost for three consecutive one-year policies? Then, what is the cost for a three-year policy? Then, what is the difference between the two?

Wait, maybe the three-year policy is more expensive because it's for a longer term. But no, the rate is per year, so it should be the same. Unless I'm missing a detail in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy's rate is applied once, not per year. So for example, 2.5 per 1000 for three years would be 7.5 per 1000, so 30*7.5=225. So same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is calculated as a single 2.5 per 1000, meaning 30*2.5=75 total for three years. But that would make the three-year policy cost $75, and the three one-year policies cost 225, so the difference would be 150. But that seems unlikely because the rate is per year.

Wait, the problem says the rate is $2.50 per $1,000, which I assume is annually. So for each year, the cost is 2.5 per 1000, so 75 per year. So three years would be 225 regardless of whether it's one-year policies or a three-year policy.

So the difference would be zero, but that's not among the options. So I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, looking at the options, D is $225. So perhaps the first part's answer is D. The second part, maybe it's a different calculation. Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is 30,000 * 2.50 /1000 *3. Wait, that's 30*2.5*3. Wait, 30*2.5 is 75, times 3 is 225. So same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is calculated as 30,000 * (2.50 *3)/1000. Which is also 30*7.5=225.

Wait, maybe the three-year policy isn't three times the annual rate. Maybe it's a different calculation. For example, perhaps the three-year policy is 2.5 per 1000 multiplied by 3, so 7.5 per 1000, but that's the same as annual 2.5.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me think about the options given. The possible answers for the first part (three one-year policies) is D: $225. The three-year policy would be the same, so the difference is zero, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the rate is per $1,000 for the entire policy, not per year. So for a one-year policy, it's 30,000/1000 *2.5=75. For a three-year policy, maybe it's 30,000/1000 *2.5 *3=225. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options given. The problem has three questions:

1. Cost for three one-year policies: 3 * $75 = $225 (option D).

2. Cost for a three-year policy: Let's see, if it's the same rate per year, then $225. So same as D. But that would make the difference zero, which isn't an option. So perhaps the three-year policy is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the three-year policy is calculated as a single 2.5 per 1000, meaning 30*2.5=75 total for three years. So then the three-year policy would be $75 (option J). Then the difference between three one-year policies (225) and the three-year (75) would be 150, which is option H.

But that would mean that the three-year policy is cheaper, but the problem doesn't say that the rate changes for longer terms. So I think that approach is incorrect because the rate is given as per year.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rate. The problem says "$2.50 per $1,000". Maybe that's the total for three years. So per year, it's 2.50/3 â‰ˆ 0.833 per year. But that doesn't make sense because the rate is usually given per year unless stated otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $1,000, and that's for a three-year policy. So for three years, it's 2.50 per 1,000, so 30*2.50=75. But then, for one-year policies, each year would be 2.50 per 1,000, so 75 per year, so three years would be 225. Then the three-year policy is 75, and the difference is 150 (225-75=150).

But the problem states the rate is $2.50 per $1,000. It doesn't specify the term, but usually, such rates are annual unless stated otherwise. So I think that approach is incorrect.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to find the correct approach based on standard insurance calculations. Typically, the premium is calculated per year. So a three-year policy would have the same annual rate, so the total would be three times the annual premium.

So, three one-year policies: 3 *75 =225 (option D).

A three-year policy: 225 (same as D).

Difference: 0, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is intended to have a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $1,000, but for a three-year policy, it's 2.5 per 1000 multiplied by 3, meaning 7.5 per 1000, so 30 *7.5=225. So same as before.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that I'm considering the same cost for both, but perhaps the three-year policy is cheaper because it's a longer commitment. But without information, I can't assume that. So perhaps the intended answer is that both are 225, but since that's not possible, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the rate is $2.50 per $1,000, regardless of the term. So for a one-year policy, it's 30 *2.50=75. For a three-year policy, it's the same 75. So three one-year policies would be 225, and one three-year would be 75. Then the difference is 150, which is option H.

But that would imply that the three-year policy is cheaper, which doesn't make sense unless the rate is discounted, which the problem doesn't state. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is a single payment, so the rate is applied once. Wait, that would make the three-year policy cost 75, while three one-year policies would be 225. So the difference is 150, which is option H.

But again, that's assuming the rate is per policy, not per year, which contradicts the usual meaning.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the difference between the two costs. So if three one-year policies cost 225, and the three-year policy costs 75, the difference is 150. But why would the three-year policy cost 75? That would mean the rate is 2.5 per 1,000 for three years, which is not the usual practice.

I think the correct approach is that the rate is per year, so both options cost 225, making the difference zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D is 225, which matches the three one-year policies. Option I is 270, which is 3*90. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the initial premium.

Wait, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $100 instead of $1,000. No, the question says per $1,000. So 30,000 is 30*1,000.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the three-year policy is calculated as 30,000 * (2.50/1000) *3. So 30,000 * 2.5% *3. That would be 750 *3=2250, which is way higher than any option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate is 2.50% per $1,000. So 2.5% of 1,000 is $25. So for 30,000, it's 30 *25=750 per year. So three years would be 2,250, which is not among the options.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $1,000, so 0.25%? No, that would be 2.5 per 1,000, which is $2.50 per $1,000, which is 0.25%.

Wait, but 0.25% of 30,000 is 75, which matches my initial calculation. So that's correct.

So I think the correct answer is that both three one-year and three-year policies cost $225, making the difference zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question intended the three-year policy to be cheaper, perhaps by applying a different rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is considered as a single policy, so the rate is 2.5 per 1,000 for the entire term, making the cost 30*2.5=75. Then, three one-year policies would be 3*75=225, so the difference is 150, which is option H.

In that case, the three-year policy's cost is $75 (option J), and the difference is $150 (option H).

So the answers would be:

Three one-year policies: $225 (D).

Three-year policy: $75 (J).

Difference: $150 (H).

Looking at the options, this fits.

So the first part's cost is D:225, the three-year is J:75, difference H:150.

Wait, but the question asks for the difference between the two. So the difference would be 225-75=150, which is option H.

So the answers to the three parts are:

First part: D.

Second part: J.

Difference: H.

But the question asks for the difference, so the answer would be H.

Wait, but the initial question presents multiple choices, but the way it's written, perhaps all three are considered. But the user instruction is to select one option from A-J, so perhaps the question is only about the difference. Let me re-read the question.

The question asks: What would the cost be for three consecutive one-year policies? What would the cost be for a 3-year policy? What is the difference between the two?

But the options are single letters, so perhaps the question is asking for the difference, which is 150, option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the difference, making the answer H.

So, to recap:

- Three one-year policies: 3 *75=225 (D).

- Three-year policy: 75 (J).

- Difference: 225-75=150 (H).

Therefore, the difference is 150, which is option H.

The problem involves calculating the cost of insurance for Montgomery's Department Store under two scenarios: three consecutive one-year policies and a single three-year policy. The insured amount is $30,000, and the rate is $2.50 per $1,000. The rate is assumed to be annual unless otherwise specified.

1. **Cost for three consecutive one-year policies**:  
   Each year's premium is calculated as:
