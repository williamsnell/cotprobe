Okay, so I've got this question about banking, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a commercial bank's deposits, loans, investments, and required reserve ratio. They're asking for the amount of excess reserves the bank has. Hmm, I remember that reserves are the funds that banks are required to hold and not lend out. There's something about required reserves and excess reserves.

So, the bank has deposits of $400,000. Deposits are a key part of a bank's liabilities. The bank uses these deposits to make loans and investments. Here, they've made loans and investments totaling $315,000. Oh, wait, deposits are their only source of reserves. So all the reserves must come from these $400k deposits.

The required reserve ratio is 20%. I think that means the bank has to keep 20% of its deposits as reserves. So first, I need to calculate the required reserves. That's 20% of $400,000. Let me do that math. 20% is 0.2, so 0.2 * 400,000 equals $80,000. So the bank must hold at least $80,000 in reserves.

Now, the question is about excess reserves. I remember that excess reserves are the amount of reserves a bank holds beyond what is required. So I need to figure out how much the bank is actually holding in reserves and then subtract the required amount from that.

Wait, but how do I find the actual reserves? Oh right, the total deposits are $400k, and the bank has made loans and investments of $315k. So, I think the bank's assets are the loans and investments plus the reserves. Because reserves are an asset for the bankâ€”cash they keep on hand or at the central bank.

So the total assets would be the sum of loans/investments and reserves. But wait, the total deposits equal the total assets minus the reserves, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The basic equation for a bank's balance sheet is: Assets = Liabilities. The main assets are loans, investments, and reserves. The main liability is deposits. So:

Loans + Investments + Reserves = Deposits

We have Loans + Investments = $315,000, Deposits = $400,000. So, 315,000 + Reserves = 400,000. Solving for Reserves gives Reserves = 400,000 - 315,000 = $85,000.

Wait, that makes sense. So the bank has $85,000 in reserves.

Now, the required reserves are $80,000. So excess reserves are actual reserves minus required reserves. That's 85,000 - 80,000 = $5,000.

Looking at the options, option C is $5,000. So the answer should be C.

I think that's right, but let me double-check. So deposits $400k, required reserve ratio 20% means required reserves are $80k. The bank's total reserves are $85k because their loans and investments are $315k, so 400k - 315k gives the reserves. Excess is 85k-80k=5k. Yep, that's correct.
</think>

To determine the bank's excess reserves, we start by calculating the required reserves. The required reserve ratio is 20%, so:

\[
\text{Required Reserves} = 20\% \times \text{Deposits} = 0.2 \times 400,000 = \$80,000
\]

Next, we calculate the bank's actual reserves. The bank's total deposits are $400,000, and it has made loans and investments totaling $315,000. Since deposits are the only source of reserves, the actual reserves can be found by subtracting the loans and investments from the total deposits:

\[
\text{Actual Reserves} = \text{Deposits} - \text{Loans and Investments} = 400,000 - 315,000 = \$85,000
\]

Excess reserves are the amount of reserves held beyond the required reserves:

\[
\text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Actual Reserves} - \text{Required Reserves} = 85,000 - 80,000 = \$5,000
\]

Thus, the bank's excess reserves are \$5,000.
