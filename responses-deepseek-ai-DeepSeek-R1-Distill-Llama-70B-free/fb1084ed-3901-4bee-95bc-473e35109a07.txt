Okay, so I have this physics problem here about impact stress in a steel rod. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The problem says a block weighing 45 lbs hits a steel rod. The block's speed is 40 inches per second. The rod is 18 inches long and has a diameter of 1 1/4 inches. I need to compute the impact stress. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, impact stress... I remember that's related to the force applied over a very short time, causing stress in the material. Stress is force per unit area, but maybe I need to consider the energy here too? Or perhaps it's about the force exerted on the rod when the block hits it.

Let me think. When the block hits the rod, it's a collision, so maybe I should calculate the force of impact. But how? Oh wait, maybe I should use the concept of strain energy or something like that.

Wait, another approach: impact stress can be calculated using the formula σ = (2 * m * v^2) / (A * L), where m is mass, v is velocity, A is cross-sectional area, and L is length of the rod. I think I've seen something like that before. Or maybe it's derived from the conservation of energy, where the kinetic energy of the block is absorbed by the rod.

Wait, that makes sense. The kinetic energy (KE) of the block is (1/2)mv². When it hits the rod, that KE is converted into strain energy in the rod, which is (σ² * A * L) / (2E), where E is the modulus of elasticity. So setting KE equal to strain energy would give me σ.

But wait, I don't know the modulus of elasticity for steel. Oh wait, maybe the question expects me to use a specific value. Let me recall, the modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) for steel is about 29,000,000 psi, or 29e6 psi. That's a standard value.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Convert the weight of the block to mass. Since weight W = m * g, so m = W / g.
   But wait, the weight is given in pounds, which is a force. So in the English system, mass is in slugs. Oh right, because pounds are force, so mass in slugs is W (lb) divided by g (32.174 ft/s², but since we're using inches, perhaps it's better to use 386 in/s² as g).

2. Calculate the kinetic energy of the block before impact. KE = 0.5 * m * v².

3. Set KE equal to the strain energy of the rod. Strain energy U = (σ² * A * L) / (2E), so solving for σ gives σ = sqrt( (2E * KE) / (A * L) ) )

Wait, let me check the units. KE is in ft-lbs or in-lbs? Since the velocity is in in/s, I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Wait, let me get the steps right:

First, convert the weight of the block to mass. Weight is 45 lbs (force). So m = 45 lb / (g in in/s²). Wait, g is 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²) or 386 in/s² when using lb units. Let me think: in the English system, using lb mass and lb force, g is approximately 386 in/s². So m = 45 lb / (386 in/s²) = 45 / 386 slugs?

Wait, no, weight W = m * g, so m = W/g. But W is 45 lb, and g is 386 in/s². So m = 45 / 386 ≈ 0.1165 slugs.

Next, velocity v is given as 40 in/s.

KE = 0.5 * m * v² → 0.5 * 0.1165 * (40)^2.

Let me compute that:

40^2 = 1600.

0.5 * 0.1165 = 0.05825.

0.05825 * 1600 = 93.2 in-lbs (or ft-lbs? Wait, in/s² times in gives velocity, so the KE would be in slug*(in/s)^2? Hmm, maybe I need to double-check the units to make sure everything lines up.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's better to work in consistent units. Let's see: 1 slug is 1 lb·s²/ft. So when using inches, perhaps I should convert everything to feet? Because if I don't, the units might get messy.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's use the formula for impact stress:

σ = (2 * m * v²) / (A * L)

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, perhaps I should derive it.

Strain energy U = (σ² * A * L) / (2E)

Kinetic energy KE = (1/2) m v²

At impact, KE is converted to U, so:

(1/2) m v² = (σ² A L) / (2E)

Multiply both sides by 2: m v² = (σ² A L) / E

Then, solving for σ: σ² = (m v² E) / (A L)

So σ = sqrt( (m v² E) / (A L) )

Wait, but that seems high. Let me see.

Wait, no, the correct formula is σ = sqrt( (2 E KE ) / (A L) )

Because KE is (1/2 m v²), so substituting that:

σ = sqrt( (2 E (1/2 m v²) ) / (A L) ) → sqrt( E m v² / (A L) )

Which is the same as sqrt( (m v² E ) / (A L) )

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula was (2 m v^2)/(A L), but that seems to be without considering E. So maybe I should proceed with this formula.

So, let's compute m, A, L.

m = 45 lbs / 386 in/s² → m ≈ 0.1165 slugs.

v = 40 in/s.

E for steel is 29,000,000 psi.

A is the cross-sectional area of the rod. The diameter is 1 1/4 inches, which is 1.25 inches. Radius is 0.625 inches.

Area A = π r² = π * (0.625)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.390625 ≈ 1.227 in².

Wait, 0.625 squared is 0.390625. Multiply by π gives ≈ 1.227 in².

Length L is 18 inches.

Now plug into the formula:

σ = sqrt( (m v² E) / (A L) )

Plugging in the numbers:

m = 0.1165 slugs

v =40 in/s → v^2=1600 in²/s²

E=29e6 psi

A=1.227 in²

L=18 in.

So compute numerator: m v² E = 0.1165 * 1600 * 29e6.

Let me compute that step by step.

0.1165 * 1600 = 186.4

186.4 * 29e6 → 186.4 * 29 = let's compute 186 *29: 186*30=5580, minus 186 → 5394. 0.4*29=11.6 → total 5405.6 → so 5405.6e6? Or wait, 29e6 is 29,000,000. So 186.4 * 29,000,000 = ?

Wait, 0.1165 slugs * (40 in/s)^2 = 0.1165 * 1600 = 186.4 slug·in²/s².

Wait, then multiplied by E (29e6 psi) → 186.4 * 29e6 = 5,405,600,000 psi·slug·in²/s².

Wait, but the denominator is A*L = 1.227 in² * 18 in = 22.086 in³.

So σ = sqrt( 5,405,600,000 / 22.086 )

Compute 5,405,600,000 / 22.086 ≈ 244,665,000.

So sqrt(244,665,000) → Let's see, sqrt(244,665,000) → Well, 15,000^2 is 225e6, 16,000^2 is 256e6. So it's between 15k and 16k.

Compute 15,646^2 = ?

Wait, 15,646 * 15,646: Hmm, 15,000^2=225,000,000. 646^2=416, 736. The cross term is 2*15,000*646= 19,380,000. So total would be 225e6 +19.38e6 +0.416e6 → 244.796e6. Wait, that's very close to 244,665,000.

So σ ≈ 15,646 psi. But wait, wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, 0.1165 * 1600 = 186.4 (slug·in²/s²)

186.4 * 29e6 psi → 186.4 *29e6 = 5,405,600,000 psi·slug·in²/s².

Denominator: A*L = 1.227 * 18 = 22.086 in³.

So 5,405,600,000 / 22.086 → let's compute:

5,405,600,000 ÷22.086 ≈ 5,405,600,000 ÷22 = around 245,472,727. But more accurately:

22.086 * 244,665,000 = 22.086 *244,665,000.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5,405,600,000 / 22.086.

Wait, 22.086 is approximately 22. So 5.4e9 / 22 = approx 245e6.

So inside the square root, it's 245e6 psi squared? Wait, no, the units.

Wait, let me think about the units again. Because the modulus E is in psi, which is pounds per square inch. So the formula's units need to work out to psi.

Wait, let me check all the units:

m is in slugs (lb·s²/ft). But wait, in this case, since v is in in/s, and area in in², length in inches, perhaps the units won't directly give psi. Maybe I should have converted to consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula I should be using is σ = (force) / (area). But what's the force?

The force during impact can be calculated using the change in momentum. F = Δp/Δt. But without knowing Δt (the impact time), that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps using the energy approach is better. So equate the kinetic energy to the strain energy.

Wait, let's try that.

KE = (1/2) m v^2.

Strain energy U = (σ² * A * L) / (2 E).

Set KE = U:

(1/2) m v² = (σ² A L) / (2 E )

Multiply both sides by 2:

m v² = (σ² A L) / E

Then, σ² = (m v² E) / (A L)

So σ = sqrt( (m v² E) / (A L) )

So, let's compute this again.

Compute m: 45 lb / 386 in/s² ≈ 0.1165 slugs.

v=40 in/s → v²=1600 in²/s².

E = 29e6 psi.

A = π*(1.25/2)^2 = π*(0.625)^2 ≈ 1.227 in².

L =18 in.

So compute numerator: m v² E = 0.1165 * 1600 *29e6.

Compute 0.1165 *1600 = 186.4.

186.4 *29e6 = 5,405,600,000.

Denominator: A L =1.227 *18 =22.086.

So (m v² E)/(A L) =5,405,600,000 /22.086 ≈ 244,665,000.

Take square root: sqrt(244,665,000) ≈ 15,646 psi.

Wait, but looking at the options: The options are A: 8,762.3; B:4,321; C:25,678.9; E:30,000; F:22,628.7; G:15,601.8; H:18,500; I:12,345.6; J:5,947.5.

Hmm, 15,646 is close to option G, which is 15,601.8. But wait, perhaps I made a calculation error somewhere.

Let me recalculate the numbers more precisely.

First, compute m:

Weight W =45 lb. So m= W/g. g=386 in/s².

m=45/386 = approximately 0.116538 slugs.

v=40 in/s → v²=1600.

E=29,000,000 psi.

A=pi*(1.25/2)^2. 1.25/2=0.625. 0.625^2=0.390625. A=pi*0.390625 ≈3.14159265 *0.390625 ≈1.2270207 in².

L=18 in.

So numerator: m v² E = 0.116538 * 1600 *29e6.

0.116538 *1600= 0.116538 *1600= (0.1*1600)=160, 0.016538*1600≈26.46 → total ≈186.46.

186.46 *29e6 → 186.46 *29 = let's compute 180*29=5220, 6.46*29≈187.34 → total≈5407.34 → so 5407.34e6 →5,407,340,000.

Denominator: A*L =1.2270207 *18= 22.0863726 in³.

So (m v² E)/(A L) =5,407,340,000 /22.0863726 ≈ let's compute this division.

5,407,340,000 ÷22.0863726 ≈ ?

Let me approximate:

22.086e0 =22.086.

5,407,340,000 ÷22.086 → let's compute 5.40734e9 /22.086 ≈ 5.40734e9 /2.2086e1 = (5.40734 /2.2086) *1e8.

5.40734 /2.2086 ≈?

Let me compute 2.2086 * 2.45 = 2.2086 *2=4.4172, 2.2086 *0.45=0.994. So 4.4172+0.994≈5.4112. So 2.45 gives about 5.4112, which is just a bit higher than 5.40734.

So 2.45 *2.2086=5.411→ so 5.40734 is about 2.45 - (5.411 -5.40734)/2.2086.

Wait, maybe it's easier to just do 5.40734 /2.2086 ≈2.446.

So approximately 2.446 *1e8 → 2.446e8 → 244,600,000.

So sqrt(244,600,000) → let's compute square of 15,600: 15,600^2=243,360,000.

15,601^2 = (15,600 +1)^2=15,600² +2*15,600*1 +1=243,360,000 +31,200 +1=243,391,201.

Wait, but 15,601^2=243,391,201. Our value is 244,600,000, which is bigger.

So compute 15,630^2= (15,600+30)^2=15,600² +2*15,600*30 +30²=243,360,000 +936,000 +900=244,296,900.

Still less than 244,600,000.

15,650^2= (15,600+50)^2=15,600² +2*15,600*50 +50²=243,360,000 +1,560,000 +2,500=244,922,500.

Wait, our target is 244,600,000. So between 15,630 and 15,650.

At 15,630: 244,296,900.

At 15,640: 15,630 +10 → difference increases by 2*15,630*10 +10^2= 312,600 +100= 312,700. So 244,296,900 +312,700=244,609,600.

Which is very close to 244,600,000. So 15,640^2=244,609,600.

So our σ is sqrt(244,600,000)= approx 15,640 psi.

Looking back at the options, option G is 15,601.8 psi, which is close but a bit lower than 15,640. Hmmm. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me check the calculation of the numerator again.

Wait, m =45/386=0.116538 slugs.

v=40 in/s → v^2=1600.

So m v^2=0.116538 *1600= 186.46.

Then, 186.46 *29e6= 186.46 *29=5407.34 → so 5407.34e6.

Wait, no, 29e6 is 29,000,000. So 186.46 *29,000,000 = 5,407,340,000.

Denominator: A=1.2270207 in²; L=18 in → A*L=22.08637 in³.

So 5,407,340,000 /22.08637= 244,600,000
