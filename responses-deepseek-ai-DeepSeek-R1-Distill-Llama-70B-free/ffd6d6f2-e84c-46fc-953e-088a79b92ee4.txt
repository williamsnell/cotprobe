Okay, so I've got this question about glucose and its roles in cell metabolism. I'm a bit rusty on my biochemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks what roles glucose plays. The options are A to J. Let me go through each one, but I'll start by recalling what I know about glucose.

Glucose is a simple sugar, right? I remember it's a primary energy source for cells. I think most cells, especially in humans, rely heavily on glucose. So, it's definitely involved in energy production. But what else?

I've heard about glycogen. Glycogen is like a stored form of glucose, especially in the liver and muscles. So the body can convert glucose into glycogen when there's excess and store it for later use. That makes sense because when you eat, your blood glucose goes up, and some of it gets stored.

Then there's fat. I remember that when there's an overabundance of glucose, the body can convert it into fat. So glucose isn't just stored as glycogen; it can also be turned into fat for longer-term storage. That process probably happens in the liver or adipose tissue.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says glucose is the primary energy source, can be converted to glycogen, and into fat. That matches what I was thinking. But wait, is it the primary source for all cells? I think red blood cells rely solely on glucose, but other cells can use other fuels like fatty acids or ketones. So 'all cells' might not be accurate. Hmm, but maybe in general, it's the primary source.

Option B says only converted into fat. No, that's too narrow. We know it does more than that, like energy and glycogen.

Option C says it's only for amino acids. No, that's not right. Glucose is more about energy and storage, not protein synthesis directly.

Option D says stored only as starch in humans. Wait, humans don't store starch. Starch is in plants. Humans store glycogen. So D is incorrect.

Option E says only for energy production. No, because we can store it as glycogen and fat.

Option F says directly into protein. I don't think so. Glucose is a carbohydrate, and proteins are made from amino acids. They might be connected through intermediates, but not a direct conversion.

Option G says can't be stored. No, because glycogen is a storage form.

Option H says only for nucleic acids. No, glucose is more about energy. Nucleic acids are made of nucleotides, which require different components.

Option I says only structural. No, glucose is mainly for energy.

Option J says not involved in metabolism, only dietary fiber. No, dietary fiber is more like cellulose, which humans don't digest much. Glucose is definitely a key player in metabolism.

So the correct answer must be A. But wait, does every cell use glucose as primary? Like, some cells prefer other fuels, but under normal circumstances, glucose is the main energy source. So the statement in A seems correct.

Glucose plays multiple roles in cell metabolism. It is the primary source of energy for cells, particularly in humans, where it is heavily relied upon for energy production. Additionally, glucose can be stored in the form of glycogen, which is found in the liver and muscles, allowing for energy reserves when needed. Furthermore, when there is an excess of glucose, it can be converted into fat for longer-term energy storage. This makes glucose a versatile molecule in metabolism, serving not only as an energy source but also as a storage molecule.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. Glucose is the primary energy source, can be stored as glycogen, and can be converted into fat.
- **B**: Incorrect. Glucose is not only converted into fat; it also serves as an energy source and can be stored as glycogen.
- **C**: Incorrect. Glucose is not exclusively used for amino acid synthesis.
- **D**: Incorrect. Humans store glucose as glycogen, not starch.
- **E**: Incorrect. Glucose is not only used for energy production; it can also be stored.
- **F**: Incorrect. Glucose is not directly converted into protein.
- **G**: Incorrect. Glucose can be stored as glycogen.
- **H**: Incorrect. Glucose is not exclusively used for nucleic acid production.
- **I**: Incorrect. Glucose is primarily for energy, not structural purposes.
- **J**: Incorrect. Glucose is heavily involved in metabolism and is not merely a dietary fiber.

The correct answer is **A**. 

Answer: A
