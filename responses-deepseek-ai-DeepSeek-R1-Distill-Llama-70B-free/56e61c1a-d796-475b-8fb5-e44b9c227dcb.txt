The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man and a woman conspired together to rob a bank. As they were exiting the bank after the robbery they were confronted by armed tactical police officers. The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?

Options:

A: Yes, because the felony murder rule only applies when the defendant is the one who directly causes the death.
B: Yes, because the police officer who shot the woman should be the one charged with murder, not the man.
C: No, because felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot as long as a death occurred during the commission of the felony.
D: No, because the man's decision to raise his gun at the officers instigated the shooting, making him responsible for the woman's death.
E: No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.
F: Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.
G: Yes, because the woman was a co-conspirator, not a victim of the crime, and therefore her death does not qualify as a felony murder.
H: No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.
I: Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.
J: No, because the man was part of the crime and his actions led directly to the woman's death.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this felony murder question. Let me start by recalling what I know about felony murder. From what I remember, felony murder is a rule that holds a defendant responsible for a murder that occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of whether the defendant intended to kill or not. It's often called the "felony murder rule."

In this case, a man and a woman conspired to rob a bank. After robbing it, they were confronted by police. The man raised his gun, shots were exchanged, and the woman was killed by a police bullet. The man was charged with felony murder for her death.

The question is whether the appellate court will reverse his conviction under the modern view of felony murder.

I think the key here is understanding who can be held liable under the felony murder rule when a co-conspirator is killed by a third party, like the police in this scenario.

I remember that traditionally, felony murder applies when a death occurs during a felony, even if it's committed by someone else, including a co-felon or a police officer. But I also recall that some jurisdictions have moved away from this, especially in cases where the killing is done by the police.

Wait, there's the idea of the "merger rule," which might not apply here, but I'm not sure. Another point is the concept of "transferred intent," but that's more about when the defendant intends to kill one person but kills another.

In some cases, courts have held that if a co-felon is killed by police during the commission of the felony, the other felon can still be held liable for felony murder. However, I think there's a modern trend where this is being questioned. Some jurisdictions have ruled that using felony murder when the victim is a co-felon killed by police violates due process because the defendant didn't cause the death and the police action was an intervening cause.

Wait, I think the majority view might still support the felony murder charge, but there's a split. The traditional view holds that any death during the felony, regardless of who causes it, makes the felon liable. But the modern view, especially in cases where the police shoot the co-felon, might be more restrictive.

I'm trying to remember if there's a specific rule about this. I think some courts have ruled that when a police officer kills a co-felon, the other felon isn't guilty of felony murder because the police action is an independent event breaking the chain of causation. But other courts might still hold them liable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says felony murder applies regardless of who fires the shot. That's the traditional view. Option I says the majority view is that it doesn't apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person. So which is correct under the modern view?

I think the modern trend is moving away from holding felons liable when the death is caused by a third party, especially law enforcement. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the majority view yet.

Wait, some Supreme Court cases... I think there was a case where the court held that felony murder couldn't be applied when the killing was done by the police because it would violate the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, I remember that in People v. Knoller, the California Supreme Court allowed felony murder when the death was caused by a co-felon, but not sure about third parties.

Wait, another angle: The felony murder rule under the Model Penal Code (MPC) requires that the death be caused by someone other than the defendant, but maybe it's more nuanced.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down. The key issue is whether the man can be held liable for the woman's death when she was killed by the police during the commission of the robbery.

Under the traditional felony murder rule, yes, because the death occurred during the commission of the felony. But modern approaches, especially considering the cause and whether the police action is a superseding cause, might say no.

So, option I says yes, the majority view is that felony murder doesn't apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person. So the appellate court would reverse the conviction.

But I'm not sure if that's the majority view. I think more courts are starting to say that when the killing is by the police, it's a foreseeable consequence, so the defendant is still liable. Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, I think in some recent cases, like when a co-felon is killed by police, courts have started to overturn felony murder convictions, reasoning that the police response is an independent intervening cause, breaking the causal chain. So the modern view might be leaning towards not holding the defendant liable in such cases.

So looking at the options, option I says yes, the majority view is that felony murder doesn't apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person. So the conviction would be reversed.

Alternatively, option C says it applies regardless, which would mean the conviction stands.

I think the correct answer is that the appellate court would reverse because the modern view holds that when a co-conspirator is killed by a third party (like police), the felony murder rule doesn't apply. So the answer would be option I.

Under the modern view of felony murder, the appellate court is likely to reverse the conviction because the majority view holds that felony murder does not apply when a co-conspirator is killed by a third party, such as a police officer, during the commission of the crime. This shift reflects an increasing recognition that the causal chain is broken when the death is caused by an intervening third party, particularly law enforcement, rather than the defendant or another co-felon. Therefore, the conviction under the felony murder rule would likely be overturned.
