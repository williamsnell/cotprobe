Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, there's a doorman at a hotel trying to get three taxicabs for three different couples. The arrival of empty cabs follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 2 minutes. We're supposed to find the probability that all three couples are taken care of within 6 minutes. The options given are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the exponential distribution is memoryless and often used for waiting times. The key here is that the arrival of cabs is exponential with a mean of 2 minutes, which means the rate parameter λ is 1/2 per minute since λ = 1/mean.

Wait, but the problem is about three cabs arriving within 6 minutes. I think I need to model the arrival times. Since each cab's arrival is independent, maybe I can model this as the maximum of three exponential variables. Because the doorman needs all three cabs to arrive by 6 minutes, so the latest cab must arrive by 6.

Right, so if I have three independent exponential random variables X1, X2, X3 with rate λ=1/2, I need to find the probability that the maximum of these three is less than or equal to 6. So P(max(X1,X2,X3) ≤6).

I remember that for the maximum of exponential variables, the CDF can be derived. The CDF of the maximum is the probability that all three are ≤6. So that would be [CDF of X1(6)]^3, because all three need to be ≤6.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh no, wait. The maximum being ≤6 means all three are ≤6. So the probability is indeed the product of each being ≤6. Because for independent variables, the joint probability is the product.

So the CDF for a single exponential variable X at time t is 1 - e^(-λt). So for each X_i, P(X_i ≤6) is 1 - e^(- (1/2)*6 ) = 1 - e^(-3).

So each X_i has a probability of 1 - e^(-3) of being ≤6. Since the three are independent, the joint probability is [1 - e^(-3)]^3.

Wait a second, that doesn't sound right. Because the maximum is ≤6 when all are ≤6, yes. So the probability is [1 - e^(-3)]^3.

But wait, what's the value of 1 - e^(-3)? Let me compute that. e^3 is about 20.0855, so e^(-3) is about 0.0498. So 1 - 0.0498 is approximately 0.9502. So (0.9502)^3 is about 0.8573. But looking at the options, the highest I see is option G: 0.9142, H: 0.8413. Hmm, but 0.8573 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is about the time until all three cabs have arrived, so maybe it's a different approach. Because each couple needs a cab, so the doorman is waiting for three cabs to arrive, regardless of order. So perhaps it's the sum of three arrivals, but no, the sum is for when you're waiting for all events to happen in sequence. Wait, no. Actually, the time until all three have arrived is the maximum of the three arrival times. So the approach I took earlier should be correct. So why isn't the answer matching any of the options close to 0.85?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck. The CDF for the maximum of n independent exponentials. Oh, wait, another way to think about it: the probability that the maximum is less than t is the probability that all are less than t, which is indeed [P(X ≤ t)]^n, because of independence. So in this case, n=3, t=6.

So [1 - e^(-λ t)]^n. λ is 1/2, so λ t = 3. So [1 - e^(-3)]^3.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately. Let's compute 1 - e^(-3) first. e^3 is about 20.0855, so e^(-3) is 1/20.0855 ≈ 0.049787. So 1 - 0.049787 = 0.950213. Now, cube that: 0.950213^3.

Calculating 0.95^3: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025, then * 0.95: 0.857375. So approximately 0.8574. But the options don't have that. The closest is option G: 0.9142, H: 0.8413, and F: 0.6981. Hmm. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the maximum, but about the sum? No, that doesn't make sense because each cab arrives independently, and the doorman just needs all three to arrive by 6 minutes. So the maximum is correct.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem is not using the maximum, but using the minimum of three variables. No, that doesn't make sense either. Wait, perhaps it's the sum of three variables? No, that's when you're waiting for three arrivals, but the sum would be the time for three arrivals in sequence, but in this case, the cabs are arriving independently; the doorman just needs three cabs to arrive, regardless of the order. Wait, no, each cab arrives as a separate event. So the time until the third cab arrives is what we're looking for. So maximum is correct.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the gamma distribution. Because the sum of n exponentials is a gamma distribution. But wait, the maximum isn't a gamma, the sum is. Wait, perhaps the approach I took is correct, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the time until three arrivals occur, which would be a gamma with shape parameter 3. Let me think: The arrival process is a Poisson process with rate λ=1/2 per minute. The time until the nth arrival in a Poisson process follows a gamma distribution with shape n and rate λ. So the time until the third arrival would be gamma(3, 1/2). So the probability that this time is ≤6 minutes is the integral from 0 to 6 of the gamma PDF.

Wait, that might be a better way to model it. Because each arrival is a Poisson process, and the time until the third arrival is when all three couples have their cabs. So yes, the doorman needs the third cab to arrive by 6 minutes. So the CDF of the gamma distribution at t=6 would be the probability.

So the gamma CDF for shape k=3 and rate λ=1/2 at t=6 is the answer.

The gamma CDF can be calculated using the incomplete gamma function. The formula is:

P(X ≤ t) = γ(k, λ t) / Γ(k)

Where γ is the lower incomplete gamma function.

So for k=3 and λ=1/2, t=6, so λ t = 3.

So P(X ≤6) = γ(3,3) / Γ(3)

Γ(3) is 2! = 2.

Now, the incomplete gamma function γ(3,3) can be expressed as:

γ(3,3) = ∫ from 0 to 3 of x^2 e^{-x} dx

Wait, because the lower incomplete gamma function is γ(s,x) = ∫0^x t^{s-1} e^{-t} dt. So s=3, so t^{2} e^{-t} dt from 0 to 3.

Alternatively, I can use the relation between the incomplete gamma function and the gamma function.

Wait, another approach: the sum of n exponential variables with rate λ is a gamma(n, λ) distribution. So in this case, the sum of three exponentials (each with rate 1/2) would have a gamma(3, 1/2) distribution. Wait, but in our case, each arrival is independent, but the time until the third arrival is the maximum, not the sum. Wait, no, the sum would be the total time for three arrivals in sequence, but in reality, the arrivals are concurrent. So perhaps the sum approach is incorrect. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the time until the third arrival is the maximum of three exponentials. But that doesn't seem right. No, the maximum is when all three have arrived by time t. But the sum is when you have three arrivals happening one after another, so the total time is the sum of three waiting times.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing two different models. Let me clarify.

In a Poisson process, the arrivals happen at times which are sums of exponential variables. So the time between arrivals is exponential, and the time until the nth arrival is the sum of n exponential variables, each with rate λ. So that's the gamma distribution approach.

So for example, the time until the first arrival is exponential(λ). The time until the second arrival is the sum of two independent exponentials, so gamma(2, λ). The time until the third arrival is gamma(3, λ).

So in this problem, the doorman is waiting for three cabs to arrive, so the time until the third cab arrives is gamma(3, 1/2). So the probability that this time is ≤6 is the CDF of gamma(3, 1/2) evaluated at 6.

So the CDF is P(X ≤6) = γ(3, (1/2)*6) / Γ(3) = γ(3,3)/2!.

Now, I can compute γ(3,3). The integral of x² e^{-x} from 0 to 3.

Alternatively, I can use the relation that γ(n, x) = (n-1)! [1 - e^{-x} ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k /k! ] when n is an integer.

Yes, because for integer n, the lower incomplete gamma function can be expressed using the exponential function and a sum. So for n=3:

γ(3,3) = 2! [1 - e^{-3} (1 + 3 + 9/2) ) ]

Wait, let me compute this correctly. The formula is:

γ(n, x) = (n-1)! [1 - e^{-x} ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k /k! ]

So for n=3, it's 2! [1 - e^{-3} ( (3^0)/0! + (3^1)/1! + (3^2)/2! ) ) ]

Compute each term:

3^0 /0! = 1/1 =1

3^1 /1! =3/1=3

3^2 /2! =9/2=4.5

Sum is 1 +3 +4.5=8.5

So:

γ(3,3) = 2 [1 - e^{-3} *8.5 ]

So the CDF is γ(3,3)/Γ(3) = [2 (1 -8.5 e^{-3}) ] / 2! = [2 (1 -8.5 e^{-3}) ] / 2 = (1 -8.5 e^{-3} )

Wait, wait, no. Because Γ(3) is 2! =2. So γ(3,3)/Γ(3) would be [2 (1 -8.5 e^{-3}) ] / 2 = (1 -8.5 e^{-3} )

Wait, no, no. The formula is γ(3,3)=2! [1 - e^{-3} (sum) ]

sum is 8.5 as above.

So γ(3,3)=2 [1 -8.5 e^{-3} ]

Then, the CDF is γ(3,3)/Γ(3) = [2 (1 -8.5 e^{-3}) ] / 2 = (1 -8.5 e^{-3} )

Wait, that can't be right. Because if e^{-3} is about 0.049787, then 8.5 *0.049787≈0.4227.

So 1 - 0.4227 ≈ 0.5773.

Hmm, but 0.5773 is close to option B, which is 0.5768. That's very close. So perhaps that's the correct approach.

Wait, so this suggests that the probability is approximately 0.5768, which is option B.

But wait, earlier I thought the maximum approach gave me around 0.8573, but that wasn't in the options. So I think I must have made a mistake in that approach. The correct approach is using the gamma distribution, modeling the time until the third arrival, which is the sum of three exponential variables, hence gamma(3,1/2), and calculating the CDF at 6.

So the process is: the doorman needs three cabs, each arriving according to a Poisson process. The time until the third cab arrives is gamma(3,1/2). The probability that this time is ≤6 is the CDF at 6, which is γ(3,3)/2! ≈ 0.5768.

So the correct answer should be option B: 0.5768.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the doorman will get all three couples taken care of within 6 minutes. The arrival of empty cabs follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 2 minutes, which corresponds to a rate parameter \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \) per minute. 

The key insight is that the time until the third cab arrives is modeled by the gamma distribution, as it represents the sum of three independent exponential random variables. Specifically, the time until the third arrival in a Poisson process follows a gamma distribution with shape parameter \( k = 3 \) and rate \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \). 

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the gamma distribution is given by:

\[
P(X \leq t) = \frac{\gamma(k, \lambda t)}{\Gamma(k)}
\]

Here, \( \gamma(k, \lambda t) \) is the lower incomplete gamma function, and \( \Gamma(k) \) is the complete gamma function. For \( k = 3 \), \( \Gamma(3) = 2! = 2 \). The lower incomplete gamma function can be expressed as:

\[
\gamma(3, \lambda t) = 2! \left[ 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \sum_{k=0}^{2} \frac{(\lambda t)^k}{k!} \right]
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = 6 \), we compute \( \lambda t = 3 \). The sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{2} \frac{3^k}{k!} = \frac{3^0}{0!} + \frac{3^1}{1!} + \frac{3^2}{2!} = 1 + 3 + \frac{9}{2} = 8.5
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma(3, 3) = 2 \left[ 1 - e^{-3} \cdot 8.5 \right]
\]

The CDF is then:

\[
P(X \leq 6) = \frac{\gamma(3, 3)}{\Gamma(3)} = \frac{2 \left[ 1 - e^{-3} \cdot 8.5 \right]}{2} = 1 - 8.5 e^{-3}
\]

Using \( e^{-3} \approx 0.049787 \), we calculate:

\[
P(X \leq 6) \approx 1 - 8.5 \cdot 0.049787 \approx 1 - 0.4227 = 0.5773
\]

This value is very close to option B, \( 0.5768 \), which is the correct answer.
