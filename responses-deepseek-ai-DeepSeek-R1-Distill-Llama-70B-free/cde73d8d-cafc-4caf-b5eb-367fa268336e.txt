Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Papadaki's arguments on sexual objectification. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to break it down carefully.

First, I remember that sexual objectification is a concept often discussed in feminist philosophy. It generally refers to treating a person as an object for sexual gratification rather than as a whole person with dignity and autonomy. Now, the question is about what Papadaki specifically argues regarding this concept.

The options are A through D. Let me consider each one.

Option A says "sexual objectification is not always wrong." I think some philosophers argue that not all forms of objectification are inherently wrong. Maybe in contexts where all parties consent and there's mutual respect, it might be acceptable. But I'm not sure if Papadaki takes this stance. I'll have to think more about this.

Option B states that "sexual objectification involves the total reduction of a person to an object." This sounds a bit extreme. I remember reading that objectification doesn't necessarily mean the person is seen as nothing more than an object in all aspects. It's more about being treated as a means to an end in a specific context, not a complete reduction. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C claims that "sexual objectification is not explainable in Kantian terms." Kant's philosophy emphasizes treating people as ends in themselves and not merely as means. If objectification involves using someone as a means for sexual pleasure, then Kantian ethics would likely condemn it. So I don't think C is right because it can be explained using Kantian ideas.

Option D: "sexual objectification involves the denial of a person's humanity." Denying humanity sounds a bit strong, but I think objectification does involve not fully recognizing the person's autonomy and dignity, which are aspects of their humanity. So D might be a correct point.

Wait, going back to option A. I recall that some argue that sexual objectification can sometimes be benign or even positive, like in consensual relationships where both parties enjoy it. So if that's the case, then option A would be correct. But I'm not sure if Papadaki makes that argument.

I think Papadaki's view is that objectification isn't always wrong. She might argue that it's context-dependent. For example, in some situations, like consensual sexual interactions where both parties agree to be objectified in a way that's pleasurable for both, it might not be morally wrong. So option A would fit that.

But wait, another thought: does objectification inherently involve treating someone as a means? If so, Kant would say that's wrong because it's using someone without their consent or without respect for their autonomy. But if consent is involved, maybe it's permissible in some cases.

So, putting it all together, I think Papadaki's argument is that sexual objectification isn't always wrong. So the answer would be option A.

The question concerns Papadaki's argument about sexual objectification. To analyze the options:

- **Option A**: Sexual objectification is not always wrong. This aligns with the idea that in consensual contexts, objectification can be benign or even positive, suggesting context matters.
- **Option B**: Sexual objectification involves total reduction to an object. This seems extreme, as objectification typically involves treating someone as a means in a specific context, not a complete reduction.
- **Option C**: Sexual objectification is not explainable in Kantian terms. Kant's ethics, which emphasize treating people as ends, can explain objectification as using someone as a means, so this is likely incorrect.
- **Option D**: Sexual objectification denies a person's humanity. While objectification involves not fully recognizing autonomy, it may not necessarily deny humanity entirely.

Given Papadaki's context-dependent view, where objectification can be permissible in consensual situations, **Option A** is the most accurate.

Answer: A
