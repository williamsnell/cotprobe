Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer in a pipe, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question states that we have a pipe with an inner diameter of 2 inches. Wait, inches? Oh right, sometimes these problems mix units, so I need to make sure I convert everything properly. The pipe is maintained at a constant temperature of 90°F. Water flows through it at an average temperature of 80°F, and the velocity is 7 ft/sec. The pipe is smooth, so I guess that affects the friction factor or something. The length of the pipe section is 15 feet, and we're supposed to find the rate of heat transfer to the water.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for heat transfer in pipes, the basic formula is Q = U * A * ΔT, where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference. But wait, in this case, since the pipe is at a constant temperature and the water is flowing, maybe we should use the convection equation.

Wait, right, Newton's Law of Cooling: Q = h * A * (T_s - T_f), where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, T_s is the surface temperature, and T_f is the fluid temperature. But wait, actually, the correct formula is Q = h * A * (T_s - T_b), where T_b is the bulk temperature of the fluid. Oh wait, in this case, the water's average temperature is 80°F, so T_b is 80°F, and the pipe surface is at 90°F? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Because sometimes the fluid's temperature is changing, but in this problem, the pipe is maintained at a higher temperature, so heat is transferred to the water. So the temperature difference is 90 - 80 = 10°F.

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute the heat transfer rate over 15 feet of the pipe. So I need to find h, the convection coefficient. To find h for water flowing in a pipe, I think I can use the Dittus-Boelter equation or maybe the Sieder-Tate equation. Let me recall: Dittus-Boelter is for when the surface is in fully developed flow and the fluid properties are evaluated at the bulk temperature, I think. Sieder-Tate is when the surface temperature is different, but in this case, the pipe is smooth and the flow is fully developed. So maybe Dittus-Boelter applies here.

The Dittus-Boelter equation is: Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33. Where Nu is Nusselt number, Re is Reynolds number, Pr is Prandtl number.

Wait, but wait. Another point: when the surface is at a different temperature than the fluid, I read that the property evaluation might be different. Oh, but I think for the Dittus-Boelter equation, the properties are evaluated at the bulk (fluid) temperature. Alternatively, maybe in this case, since the pipe is smooth, it's more about the flow, so perhaps that's correct.

So first, I need to compute the Reynolds number, Re.

Re is (V * D) / ν, where V is velocity, D is diameter, and ν is kinematic viscosity.

Wait, the units. The diameter is 2 inches, which is 2/12 feet = 0.1667 feet. Velocity is 7 ft/s. The kinematic viscosity of water at 80°F—wait, I think the temperature is around 80°F, so let me get the properties of water at 80°F.

Wait, I might need to find the viscosity and other properties at the average temperature of the water, which is 80°F. From memory, water at around 80°F has a kinematic viscosity ν around 0.00001 ft²/s or something similar? Wait, let me get the exact value. Or maybe I should look up the properties.

Wait, I think at 80°F, the properties of water are approximately:

- Viscosity (dynamic), μ = about 2.1 x 10^-5 lb-sec/ft²

Wait, no, wait. Wait, kinematic viscosity ν is μ/ρ, where ρ is density. So for water at 80°F, let me see. I think the density ρ is about 62.3 lb/ft³? Or wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of consistent units.

Wait, the density of water at 80°F is roughly 62 lb/ft³. The dynamic viscosity μ is about 2.1 x 10^-5 lb-sec/ft². So kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ = (2.1e-5) / (62) ≈ 3.387e-7 ft²/s.

Wait, but wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I should use ν at 80°F as approximately 0.0000129 ft²/s. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should note that the kinematic viscosity for water at 80°F is around 1.06 x 10^-5 m²/s, but I need to convert that to ft²/s. Oh wait, 1 m²/s is 10.7639 ft²/s, so 1.06e-5 m²/s is 1.06e-5 * 10.7639 ≈ 0.000114 ft²/s. Hmm, that's about 1.14e-4 ft²/s. But I'm not sure, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, another approach: using standard values. Let me think. At 60°F, water has a kinematic viscosity of about 0.000013 ft²/s. At 80°F, it's a bit lower. Let's say maybe 0.0000105 ft²/s. Wait, that's just a rough guess. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact value, but since I can't access references, I have to go with approximation.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me see, at 80°F, which is 26.67°C, the kinematic viscosity ν is approximately 0.95 x 10^-6 m²/s. Wait, 0.95e-6 m²/s. To convert to ft²/s, 1 m²/s is (3.28084 ft)^2 = 10.7639 ft². So 0.95e-6 m²/s * 10.7639 ft²/(m²) = 0.95e-6 * 10.7639 ≈ 1.025e-5 ft²/s. So ν ≈ 1.025e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers. Let me think again. Another approach: I recall that at 20°C (68°F), ν for water is about 1.004 x 10^-6 m²/s. At higher temperatures, ν decreases. So at 80°F (about 27°C), ν would be lower than at 20°C. So perhaps around 0.8 x 10^-6 m²/s. So 0.8e-6 m²/s is 0.8e-6 * 10.7639 ≈ 8.611e-6 ft²/s, which is 8.611e-6 ft²/s. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the known values for water at 80°F.

Wait, let me try to get more precise. The kinematic viscosity of water at 80°F (coefficient of viscosity μ):

At 80°F, μ is about 0.00002042 lb·s/ft². Wait, wait, no, I think I'm mixing units. Let me clarify: dynamic viscosity μ is in lb·s/ft², and kinematic viscosity ν is μ/ρ, where ρ is density in lb/ft³.

So for water at 80°F:

- Density ρ is about 62.3 lb/ft³.

- Dynamic viscosity μ is about 0.00002042 lb·s/ft².

So ν = μ / ρ = 0.00002042 / 62.3 ≈ 0.0000003278 ft²/s, which is 3.278e-7 ft²/s.

Wait, that's 3.278e-7 ft²/s. So that's about 3.28e-7.

Now, Re = (V * D) / ν

V is 7 ft/s.

D is 2 inches, which is 0.1667 feet.

So Re = (7 * 0.1667) / (3.28e-7) 

Let me compute numerator: 7 * 0.1667 ≈ 1.1669.

So Re = 1.1669 / 3.28e-7 ≈ 1.1669 / 0.000000328 ≈ let's compute this.

Wait, 1.1669 divided by 3.28e-7 is approximately 3,550,000. Hmm, let me calculate:

3.28e-7 = 0.000000328.

So 1.1669 / 0.000000328 = ?

Well, 1 / 0.000000328 ≈ 3,048,780.

So 1.1669 * 3,048,780 ≈ let's see:

3,048,780 * 1 = 3,048,780.

3,048,780 * 0.1669 ≈ Let me compute it as 3,048,780 * 0.1 = 304,878; 3,048,780 * 0.06 = 182,926.8; 3,048,780 * 0.0069 ≈ ~21,  (approx 3,048,780 * 0.006 = 18,292.68; 0.0009 gives about 2,743.5; so total about 18,292.68 + 2,743.5 = 21,036.18). So total for 0.1669 is about 304,878 + 182,926.8 + 21,036.18 ≈ 508,840. So total Re is approx 3,048,780 + 508,840 = 3,557,620. So Re ≈ 3.56 x 10^6.

Wait, but that's a very high Reynolds number. Is that correct? Because for pipe flow, turbulent flow starts at Re around 4000, so 3.5 million is definitely turbulent. So that makes sense since the velocity is 7 ft/s, which is pretty high.

Now, using the Dittus-Boelter equation for turbulent flow (since Re > 4000), which is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33.

But wait, we also need the Prandtl number Pr at the bulk temperature (80°F).

Pr for water at 80°F: I think it's around 7.0, but I'm not sure. Let me think: at 20°C, Pr is about 7.0, so at 80°F (27°C), it's a bit lower, maybe around 6 or so. Alternatively, I think for water at 80°F, Pr is approximately 6.0.

Wait, but I might need to get more accurate. Alternatively, I can recall that for water at 80°F, the Prandtl number is about 6. So I'll go with Pr = 6.

So plugging into Dittus-Boelter:

Nu = 0.023 * (3.56e6)^0.8 * (6)^0.33

Let me compute each term.

First, (3.56e6)^0.8: Let me compute log(3.56e6) = log(3,560,000) = approx 6.5512 (since 10^6 is 6, and 3.56e6 is 3.56*10^6, log10(3.56)≈0.5512).

So 0.8 * 6.5512 = 5.24096.

10^5.24096 ≈ 10^5 * 10^0.24096. 10^0.24 is approx 1.7378. So 10^5.24096 ≈ 173,780.

Wait, but that's the value of (3.56e6)^0.8. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using exponents.

Alternatively, 3.56e6 is 3,560,000. Let me compute (3,560,000)^0.8. Let me compute ln(3,560,000) = ln(3.56e6) ≈ ln(3.56) + 6 ln(10) ≈ 1.2684 + 6*2.3026 ≈ 1.2684 + 13.8156 = 15.084. Multiply by 0.8: 15.084 * 0.8 = 12.0672. Now, e^12.0672: e^12 is about 162754, and e^0.0672 is about 1.0695, so approx 162754 * 1.0695 ≈ 174,000. So (3.56e6)^0.8 ≈ 174,000.

Wait, that's a rough approximation, but let's go with that.

Next term: 6^0.33. Let's compute that.

6^0.33 is the same as e^(0.33 * ln6). Ln6 ≈ 1.7918. So 0.33 * 1.7918 ≈ 0.5922. e^0.5922 ≈ 1.807.

So now, Nu = 0.023 * 174,000 * 1.807.

Compute 0.023 * 174,000 first: 0.023 * 174,000 = approx 4,002.

Wait, 0.023 * 174,000: 174,000 * 0.02 = 3,480. 174,000 * 0.003 = 522. So total 3,480 + 522 = 4,002.

Then multiply by 1.807: 4,002 * 1.807 ≈ Let's compute 4,000 * 1.807 = 7,228. Plus 2 * 1.807 = 3.614. So total approx 7,231.614.

So Nu ≈ 7,232.

Now, Nusselt number Nu = h * D / k. So h = (Nu * k) / D.

We need the thermal conductivity of water at 80°F. Let me recall that k for water at 80°F is about 0.379 W/m·K, but we need to convert that to English units. Alternatively, in English units, k is about 0.379 * 0.5778 ≈ 0.219 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, because 1 W/m·K = 0.57782 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So 0.379 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.219 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that conversion factor. Because 1 W/(m·K) is equal to 0.57782 (BTU·in)/(hr·ft²·°F). So yes, so 0.379 W/m·K is 0.379 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.219 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the value in English units. I think the thermal conductivity of water at 80°F is about 0.38 W/m·K, which as per the conversion is 0.219 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

So k ≈ 0.219 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but wait, the units for h would be BTU/(hr·ft²·°F). Because h is defined as Q/(A ΔT), and Q is in BTU/hr, A is in ft², ΔT in °F. So h is BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but the formula using Nu is h = (Nu * k) / D. But we have to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, D is in feet, right? Wait, because our diameter is 0.1667 feet. So D is in ft. So let's compute h.

h = (Nu * k) / D.

But wait, k is in BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F), and D is in ft. So the units would be (Nu * (BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F))) / ft.

Wait, that would give h in (BTU·in)/(hr·ft³·°F). Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert D to inches. Because k is in BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So D is 2 inches.

So let's recompute h using D in inches.

So D = 2 inches.

h = (Nu * k) / D.

So Nu is 7,232.

k is 0.219 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

D is 2 inches.

So h = (7232 * 0.219) / 2.

Compute numerator: 7232 * 0.219. Let's see: 7000 * 0.219 = 1,533. 232 * 0.219 ≈ 50.8. So total approx 1,533 + 50.8 = 1,583.8.

So h ≈ 1,583.8 / 2 ≈ 791.9 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but let me check the units again: (Nu * k) / D.

Nu is dimensionless.

k is BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

D is in inches.

So (BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F)) / in = BTU/(hr·ft²·°F). Which matches the desired units for h.

So h ≈ 791.9 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit high. Let me see, for water, h can be in the hundreds or thousands. So maybe 791 is reasonable.

Now, the heat transfer rate Q is h * A * (T_s - T_b).

A is the surface area of the pipe over 15 feet.

Surface area of a pipe is
