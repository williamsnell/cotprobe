Okay, so I've got this complex integral to solve: the integral of z squared times sine(1/z) around the circle where the absolute value of z is 1. Hmm, that's ∫_{|z|=1} z² sin(1/z) dz. And the question says the answer is Ai, where i is the imaginary unit, and I need to find A.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with contour integrals, especially around the unit circle, sometimes we can use Cauchy's theorem or the residue theorem. But wait, the function inside the integral has a sin(1/z) term, which makes me think about the Laurent series expansion because 1/z is involved. 

So sin(1/z) can be expanded as a Taylor series around infinity, but since we're integrating around the unit circle, it's probably better to express sin(1/z) as a Laurent series in terms of 1/z. The general expansion for sin(w) is sum from n=0 to infinity of (-1)^n w^(2n+1)/(2n+1)! So substituting w with 1/z, we get sin(1/z) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (1/z)^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!.

So sin(1/z) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / ( (2n+1)! ) * z^{ - (2n+1) }.

Now the integrand is z² times this series. So z² * sin(1/z) becomes z² times the sum, which is sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / ( (2n+1)! ) * z^{2 - (2n+1)} = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / ( (2n+1)! ) * z^{1 - 2n}.

So the integrand is a Laurent series: sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1)! ) ] * z^{1-2n}.

Now, when integrating around the unit circle, according to the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the residue of the function at z=0. The residue is the coefficient of z^{-1} in the Laurent expansion.

So I need to find the term where the exponent is -1 because that's z^{-1}. Looking at z^{1-2n}, setting 1-2n = -1. So 1 - 2n = -1 → 2n = 2 → n=1.

So the coefficient for n=1 is (-1)^1 / (2*1 +1)! ) → (-1)/3! = -1/6.

So the residue is -1/6. Then the integral should be 2πi times (-1/6) → (-πi/3). Wait, but the answer is given as Ai, so A would be (-π/3)?

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are given as numbers. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: -1.047, which is approximately -π/3 because π is about 3.1416, so π/3 is about 1.047. So negative of that would be option A.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. So the residue is the coefficient of z^{-1}, which comes from n=1. So the coefficient is (-1)^1/(3!) = -1/6. Then 2πi * (-1/6) is -πi/3. So the integral would be -πi/3, so A is -π/3. But the options don't explicitly have π; they have numbers. So -π/3 is approximately -1.047, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the expansion. Let me double-check sin(1/z). The expansion should be correct: sin(w) = w - w^3/3! + w^5/5! - ... So substituting w=1/z: sin(1/z)=1/z - 1/(3! z^3) + 1/(5! z^5) - ... So when I multiply by z², each term becomes z²*(1/z^{2n+1}) = z^{2 - (2n+1)} = z^{1-2n}.

So for each n, the exponent is 1-2n. So when 1-2n = -1 → 2n=2 →n=1. So the coefficient is (-1)^1/(3!) = -1/6. So residue is -1/6. Integral: 2πi*(-1/6) = -πi/3. So A is -π/3, which is approximately -1.047, option A.

To evaluate the integral $\int_{|z|=1} z^2 \sin(1/z) \, dz$, we use the residue theorem. The function $\sin(1/z)$ can be expanded as a Laurent series:

\[
\sin(1/z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} z^{-(2n+1)}.
\]

Multiplying this series by $z^2$, the integrand becomes:

\[
z^2 \sin(1/z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} z^{1-2n}.
\]

The residue of a function is the coefficient of $z^{-1}$ in its Laurent expansion. To find this, we set the exponent $1-2n = -1$, which gives $n=1$. The corresponding coefficient is:

\[
\frac{(-1)^1}{(2(1)+1)!} = \frac{-1}{3!} = -\frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the residue of the function at $z=0$ is $-\frac{1}{6}$. According to the residue theorem, the integral is $2\pi i$ times the residue:

\[
\int_{|z|=1} z^2 \sin(1/z) \, dz = 2\pi i \left(-\frac{1}{6}\right) = -\frac{\pi i}{3}.
\]

The problem states that the answer is $Ai$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit. Comparing, we find $A = -\frac{\pi}{3}$. Numerically, $-\frac{\pi}{3} \approx -1.047$, which corresponds to option A.
