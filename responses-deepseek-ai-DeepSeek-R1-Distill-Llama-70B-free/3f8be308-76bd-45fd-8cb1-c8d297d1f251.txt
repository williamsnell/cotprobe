Okay, so I've got this problem here about hydrogen bombs and gasoline combustion. Hmm, I need to figure out how many liters of gasoline are needed to produce the same energy as 1 liter of water when used in a hydrogen bomb. Let's see.

Wait, the hydrogen bomb uses deuterium, right? And deuterium is a form of hydrogen. The question says that 1/7000 of natural hydrogen is deuterium. So, first, I need to find out how much deuterium is in 1 liter of water.

Wait, water is H2O. So each molecule has two hydrogen atoms. But I'm dealing with deuterium here, which is a heavy isotope of hydrogen. So for each liter of water, how many moles of hydrogen are there, and then how much of that is deuterium?

But wait, water's density is about 1 kg per liter, right? So 1 liter of water is 1000 grams. Water's molar mass is 18 g/mol (H2O: 2*1 + 16 = 18). So moles of water in 1 liter is 1000 / 18 ≈ 55.56 moles.

Each mole of water has 2 moles of hydrogen, so total hydrogen is 2 * 55.56 ≈ 111.11 moles. But since hydrogen in natural abundance is about 1/7000 being deuterium, the moles of deuterium would be 111.11 / 7000 ≈ 0.01587 moles of D.

Wait, but wait a second. Each deuterium nucleus (D) is a hydrogen isotope. And in the fusion reaction, each deuterium nucleus fuses with another to form a helium nucleus. So, the reaction is D + D → He + energy.

Wait, but the question says each deuterium releases 5 MeV. Oh wait, per deuterium? Or per reaction? Hmm, the wording is: "5 MeV of energy is released per deuterium." So each D gives 5 MeV. But wait, that doesn't make sense because each reaction uses two D's. So perhaps each reaction releases 5 MeV per D, but that would be 10 MeV per reaction. Hmm, maybe I should think about it as each D contributes 5 MeV, so each reaction (which uses two Ds) releases 10 MeV. Or perhaps the energy per reaction is 5 MeV. The wording is a bit unclear.

Wait, let's re-read that part: "5MeV of energy is released per deuterium." So each D gives 5 MeV. So for each D nucleus that undergoes fusion, 5 MeV is released. So in a reaction where two Ds fuse, you get 2 * 5 MeV = 10 MeV per reaction? Or is it that each reaction releases 5 MeV, meaning each D contributes 2.5 MeV? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. I think the intended interpretation is that each D contributes 5 MeV, so each fusion releases 10 MeV total. So for each D, 5 MeV is released.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

So, in 1 liter of water, I have 0.01587 moles of D. Each mole of D has Avogadro's number of nuclei, which is about 6.022e23. So number of D nuclei is 0.01587 mol * 6.022e23 ≈ approx 9.56e21 nuclei.

Each D nucleus releases 5 MeV. So total energy is 9.56e21 * 5 MeV.

Wait, converting MeV to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 1.602e-13 J. So 5 MeV is 5 * 1.602e-13 J = 8.01e-13 J per D nucleus.

So total energy from all D nuclei is 9.56e21 * 8.01e-13 J ≈ let's calculate that.

9.56e21 * 8.01e-13 = (9.56 * 8.01) * 1e(21-13) ) = approx 76.56 * 1e8 = 7.656e9 J, which is about 7.656e9 Joules.

Wait, that's per liter of water, right? So that's the energy released from fusion.

Now, the gasoline part. I need to find out how much gasoline needs to be burned to produce the same energy. So I need to find the energy per mole of gasoline combusted, then find how many moles I need to get to 7.656e9 J, then find the volume.

The heat of combustion of gasoline is given as 5100 KJ per mole. Gasoline is C8H18, so its molar mass is (8*12) + (18*1) )= 96 + 18 = 114 g/mol.

Density is 0.703 g/cm³. So 1 liter is 1000 cm³, which is 1000 * 0.703 g = 703 grams per liter. Moles per liter are 703 g / 114 g/mol ≈ 6.17 mol per liter.

Wait, no, wait. That's the moles per liter of gasoline. The heat of combustion is per mole, so per mole of gasoline, it's 5100 KJ.

So energy per liter of gasoline is 6.17 mol * 5100 KJ/mol = 6.17 * 5100 = let's see, 6 * 5100 is 30,600, and 0.17*5100 is 867, so total 31,467 KJ per liter, which is 31,467,000 J per liter.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking how many liters of gasoline need to be burned to produce the same energy as 1 liter of water's deuterium. So from the fusion, we got 7.656e9 J per liter of water. So we need to get that much energy from gasoline.

Each liter of gasoline gives 31,467,000 J (since 5100 KJ is 5,100,000 J, right?). Wait, no! Wait, 5100 KJ per mole. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong.

Wait, let me recalculate gasoline's energy per liter.

The heat of combustion is 5100 KJ per mole of gasoline (C8H18). So one mole releases 5100 KJ when burned.

The molar mass is 114 g/mol, as I calculated earlier. The density is 0.703 g/cm³. So 1 liter (1000 cm³) is 703 grams.

So the number of moles in 703 grams is 703 / 114 ≈ 6.1667 mol.

So energy per liter is 6.1667 mol * 5100 KJ/mol = let's compute that.

5100 * 6.1667 ≈ 5100 * 6 = 30,600 plus 5100 * 0.1667 ≈ 850. So total around 31,450 KJ per liter. Convert that to J: 31,450 KJ = 31,450,000 J per liter.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because gasoline's energy per liter is 31,450,000 J (31.45e6 J).

Wait, but the energy from the fusion is 7.656e9 J. So how many liters of gasoline are needed?

You need energy from gasoline = 7.656e9 J.

Each liter gives 3.145e7 J (because 31,450 KJ is 31,450,000 J, which is 3.145e7 J).

So the number of liters is (7.656e9 J) / (3.145e7 J/L) ≈ 243.3 liters.

Looking at the options, option E is 243 liters. So the answer would be E.

To determine how many liters of gasoline are needed to produce the same amount of energy as 1 liter of water when used in a hydrogen bomb, we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy Released from 1 Liter of Water**:  
   - 1 liter of water contains 1000 grams of water (density of water = 1 g/cm³).  
   - The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18 g/mol, so the number of moles of water in 1 liter is:  
     \[
     \frac{1000}{18} \approx 55.56 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - Each mole of water contains 2 moles of hydrogen, so the total moles of hydrogen are:  
     \[
     55.56 \times 2 \approx 111.11 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - Natural hydrogen contains 1/7000 deuterium (D), so the moles of deuterium are:  
     \[
     \frac{111.11}{7000} \approx 0.01587 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - Each deuterium nucleus releases 5 MeV of energy. Converting MeV to joules (\(1 \, \text{MeV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}\)), the total energy released is:  
     \[
     0.01587 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{nuclei/mol} \times 5 \, \text{MeV/nucleus} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J/MeV}.
     \]  
     Simplifying:  
     \[
     9.56 \times 10^{21} \, \text{nuclei} \times 8.01 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \approx 7.656 \times 10^{9} \, \text{J}.
     \]  

2. **Energy Released from Gasoline**:  
   - The heat of combustion of gasoline (C₈H₁₈) is \(5100 \, \text{KJ/mol}\), and its molar mass is:  
     \[
     8 \times 12 + 18 \times 1 = 114 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]  
   - The density of gasoline is \(0.703 \, \text{g/cm³}\), so 1 liter (\(1000 \, \text{cm³}\)) contains:  
     \[
     1000 \times 0.703 = 703 \, \text{g}.
     \]  
   - The number of moles of gasoline in 1 liter is:  
     \[
     \frac{703}{114} \approx 6.17 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - The energy released per liter of gasoline is:  
     \[
     6.17 \, \text{mol} \times 5100 \, \text{KJ/mol} = 31,450 \, \text{KJ} = 31,450,000 \, \text{J}.
     \]  

3. **Liters of Gasoline Needed**:  
   - To produce the same energy as 1 liter of water (\(7.656 \times 10^{9} \, \text{J}\)), the number of liters of gasoline required is:  
     \[
     \frac{7.656 \times 10^{9}}{31,450,000} \approx 243.3 \, \text{liters}.
     \]  

Thus, the closest option is **243 liters of gasoline**.  

**Answer: E**
