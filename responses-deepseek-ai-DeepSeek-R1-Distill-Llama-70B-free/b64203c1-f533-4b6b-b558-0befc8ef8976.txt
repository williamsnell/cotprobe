Okay, so I've got this problem here about mountain climbers and boiling points, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of two rate constants, k_100°C and k_90°C. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the climbers are at a 3 km altitude where the barometric pressure is 0.69 atm. They notice that pure water boils at 90°C there, which makes sense because lower pressure lowers the boiling point. Normally, water boils at 100°C at 1 atm. So the boiling point is lower because the atmospheric pressure is lower.

They also found that it takes 300 minutes to cook a "three-minute" egg. Wait, that's a big difference. So normally, an egg takes three minutes to cook at 100°C, but at 90°C, it takes 300 minutes. So the cooking time is 100 times longer (since 300 is 100 times 3). Because the reaction rate is much slower at the lower temperature.

I remember that reaction rates are temperature dependent. The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction. So the rate constant k depends on temperature. Oh right, the Arrhenius equation! Which is k = A * exp(-Ea/(RT)), where Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

But wait, I think there's an approximation method when comparing two rate constants at two different temperatures. Maybe the Arrhenius equation can be used in a two-point form. So if I have two rate constants k1 and k2 at temperatures T1 and T2, the ratio k1/k2 can be found using the equation ln(k1/k2) = (Ea/R) [1/T2 - 1/T1].

But wait, in this case, the problem is about the cooking time. Cooking time is inversely related to the rate constant. Because if the rate is faster, the time taken for the reaction (like cooking the egg) is less. So if the time increases, the rate decreases.

So, the cooking time is inversely proportional to the rate constant. So if t1 is the time at T1 and t2 at T2, then (t1/t2) = (k2/k1). Because if k2 is smaller than k1, the time t2 will be longer. Let me think: the rate is k, so the time taken for a certain amount of reaction (like cooking the egg) would be inversely proportional to k. So t ∝ 1/k.

So, in this case, the normal time is 3 minutes at 100°C, and the time at 90°C is 300 minutes. So (t2)/(t1) = 300/3 = 100 = (k1)/(k2), where k1 is at 100°C and k2 at 90°C. Wait, wait. Wait, the time is longer when the rate is slower. So if the rate is slower, the time is longer. So, k2 is less than k1, so t2 = 300 is longer than t1 =3. So t2/t1 = 100 = k1/k2. So k1/k2 = 100. So the ratio of k_100 to k_90 is 100:1.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the rate at 100°C is k1, and at 90°C is k2. The time is inversely proportional to the rate. So the time ratio t1/t2 = (1/k1)/(1/k2) )= k2/k1. Wait, no. If the reaction takes time t, then for the same extent of reaction, t is proportional to 1/k. So t1 = c/k1, t2=c/k2. So t1/t2 = (c/k1)/(c/k2) )= k2/k1.

In this problem, t1 is at 100°C (3 min), t2 is at 90°C (300 min). So t1/t2 = 3/300 = 1/100 = k2/k1. So k1/k2 = 100. So the ratio is 100, which is option G.

But wait, let me think again. Because the Arrhenius equation might come into play here, but I'm not given any activation energy or other constants. Oh wait, but the problem is more about the relation between the cooking times and the rate constants, so maybe using the ratio is sufficient without needing to calculate using Ea.

Alternatively, if I think about the Arrhenius equation, but I don't have Ea. So perhaps the problem is making an approximation that the activation energy is much larger than RT, or perhaps using the ratio directly.

Wait, but the problem just asks for the ratio of the rate constants. If the cooking time is 300 minutes vs 3, the rate is 1/100th. So the rate at 90°C is 1/100 of the rate at 100°C. So k1 (100°C) is 100 times k2 (90°C). So the ratio k100/k90 is 100. So the answer should be G: 100.

But let me think if there's any other factor, like pressure. Oh, the pressure is given as 0.69 atm. But wait, that affects the boiling point, which we already accounted for (water boils at 90°C there), so maybe that doesn't directly affect the rate constants beyond the temperature. Because the rate constant depends on temperature, not pressure. So once the temperature is set, pressure's effect is already in the boiling point.

So yeah, I think the ratio is 100, so option G.

To determine the ratio of the rate constants \( k_{100^\circ \text{C}} \) and \( k_{90^\circ \text{C}} \), we analyze the relationship between cooking time and reaction rate. The problem states that at 100°C, a "three-minute" egg takes 3 minutes to cook, while at 90°C, it takes 300 minutes. Cooking time is inversely proportional to the reaction rate constant, meaning:

\[
\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \frac{k_2}{k_1}
\]

Here, \( t_1 = 3 \, \text{minutes} \) (at 100°C) and \( t_2 = 300 \, \text{minutes} \) (at 90°C). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \frac{3}{300} = \frac{1}{100}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \frac{1}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{k_{100^\circ \text{C}}}{k_{90^\circ \text{C}}} = 100
\]

Thus, the ratio of the rate constants is \( k_{100^\circ \text{C}} : k_{90^\circ \text{C}} = 100 : 1 \).

The given pressure (0.69 atm) affects the boiling point of water but does not directly influence the ratio of rate constants, as the rate constants depend only on temperature. Therefore, the ratio is determined solely by the temperature difference and the corresponding cooking times.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{G}
\]
