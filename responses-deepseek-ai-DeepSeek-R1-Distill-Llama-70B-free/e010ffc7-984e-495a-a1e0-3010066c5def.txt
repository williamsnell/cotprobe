Question:

Describe shadowing. How is it used in studies ofattention ?

Options:

A: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to memorize a series of words.
B: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a series of words is read to the subject, and the subject is asked to repeat everything she hears out loud.
C: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to observe a person's behavior and mimic their actions.
D: 'Shadowing' is a process where a subject is exposed to visual stimuli and must identify the objects casting shadows.
E: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject hears two different conversations in each ear and must focus on one to report back.
F: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a series of words is read to the subject, and the subject is asked to write everything she hears.
G: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to translate a series of words.
H: 'Shadowing' is a cognitive task where a subject is presented with shapes and must draw the corresponding shadows.
I: 'Shadowing' is a method where a subject is asked to listen to a conversation and then provide a summary afterward.
J: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to recognize patterns in shadows to test perceptual abilities.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about shadowing and its use in attention studies. Hmm, I remember hearing about shadowing in the context of psychology experiments, probably related to how we focus our attention.

Shadowing... I think it's a technique where participants have to pay attention to one thing while ignoring others. Like, maybe they're given two different auditory inputs and they have to focus on one. Wait, I've heard of something called the dichotic listening task. Oh right, in those studies, participants wear headphones and hear different messages in each ear. They might be asked to shadow, which means repeating what they hear in one ear while ignoring the other. That must test their ability to selectively attend to one source and filter out the other.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says shadowing is memorizing a series of words. Doesn't sound right because I don't recall memory being the main focus here; it's more about attention.

Option B is about repeating everything heard. That might be part of it, but if they're hearing two conversations, they can't repeat both. So B might not be the best fit unless it's a single conversation.

Option C talks about observing and mimicking behavior. That sounds more like a social psychology concept, maybe like the Stanford prison experiment or something else, not attention studies.

Option D is about visual stimuli and identifying shadow objects. That seems unrelated to attention in the auditory sense.

Option E mentions hearing two conversations in each ear and focusing on one. That rings a bell. This setup would require the participant to attend to one conversation and ignore the other, which is exactly what I was thinking about with dichotic listening and shadowing.

Option F is about writing what's heard. That might be part of some tasks, but shadowing is more about speaking out loud, I think.

Option G is translating words, which doesn't fit with the attention concept.

Option H is about drawing shadows from shapes, which is more visual perception, not attention.

Option I is listening and summarizing. That's a bit different because shadowing is more immediate, not waiting to summarize after.

Option J is about recognizing shadow patterns, again more perception than attention.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. It describes the scenario where a subject hears two different conversations, each in one ear, and must focus on one to report back. This tests their ability to selectively attend, which is a key aspect of attention studies.

Shadowing is a technique used in studies of attention where a subject hears two different conversations, one in each ear, and must focus on one to report back. This tests selective attention by requiring the subject to attend to one conversation while ignoring the other.
