Okay, so I need to find the mode of this sample data. Let me think about what the mode means. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. If no number repeats, then there's no mode, right?

Looking at the numbers given: 14, 16, 21, 19, 18, 24, and 17. Let me list them out again to check for duplicates. 

14 appears once. 16 is next, also once. Then 21, once again. 19, once. 18, once. 24, once. 17, once. Wait, so all these numbers occur just once each. That means there are no repeats in this dataset.

So if every number only appears once, there isn't a mode because the mode is the most frequent one. Since they're all equally frequent (once each), none stands out as the mode.

Looking at the options, option A is "no mode". That should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any duplicates. Scanning the list again: 14,16,21,19,18,24,17. Yep, all unique. So definitely no mode.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. In this case, all the numbers (14, 16, 21, 19, 18, 24, 17) appear exactly once. Since there are no duplicates, there is no mode.

A: no mode

Answer: A
