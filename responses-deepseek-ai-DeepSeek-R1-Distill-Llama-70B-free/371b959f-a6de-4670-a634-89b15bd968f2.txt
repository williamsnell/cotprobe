Okay, so I've got this question about how crowding affects men and women differently. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is true regarding the effects of crowding. The options are from A to I. I remember that crowding can lead to stress and certain behaviors, but I'm not exactly sure about the gender differences.

Wait, I think that research has shown that men and women react differently to crowded environments. Men are more likely to experience stress when in crowded conditions compared to women. Or was it the other way around? I'm a bit confused here.

I remember reading somewhere that men tend to have higher levels of stress hormones like cortisol in crowded spaces. This might be because of the way men perceive a lack of control in such situations. Women might cope differently, perhaps through social support or other mechanisms, which could reduce their stress levels.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says men and women react aggressively to the same degree. I'm not sure about that. Some studies suggest men might be more aggressive when crowded.

Option B says both are equally likely to react negatively. I'm not certain, but I think the reactions might differ.

Option C says both equally act aggressively. Again, I think men might be more aggressive.

Option D: Men are less stressed. No, I think they're more stressed.

Option E: Women are less stressed. If that's the case, then perhaps D is wrong. But I'm not sure.

Option F: Women more aggressive. I don't think so; I think men are.

Option G: Both unaffected. No, that can't be right because crowding does affect people.

Option H: Men more stressed. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Option I: Women more aggressive. Doesn't fit with what I recall.

So putting it together, if men are more likely to be stressed in crowded conditions, then option H is correct. Alternatively, if the question is about acting aggressively, perhaps that's a different aspect.

Wait, the question is about the effects of crowding in general. So the correct statement would be about stress reactions. So option H says "Men react to crowded conditions with stress more than women." That sounds right.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people say that women might experience more stress in certain social situations. Or maybe it's the opposite. Another angle: the study I'm recalling said that in crowded situations, men's stress levels are higher. So option H would be the correct answer.

The question concerns the effects of crowding on men and women, specifically focusing on stress reactions. Research suggests that men tend to experience higher levels of stress in crowded conditions compared to women. This is often linked to differences in how each gender perceives and copes with crowded environments. Men may feel a greater sense of a lack of control, leading to increased stress, while women might employ coping mechanisms like social support to mitigate stress. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, F, I**: These options focus on aggression or equal reactions, which are not directly supported by the context provided.
- **D, E**: These contradict the idea that men are more stressed in crowded conditions.
- **G**: Incorrect, as crowding does affect people.
- **H**: Aligns with the understanding that men react to crowded conditions with more stress than women.

Thus, the correct answer is **H**.

Answer: H
