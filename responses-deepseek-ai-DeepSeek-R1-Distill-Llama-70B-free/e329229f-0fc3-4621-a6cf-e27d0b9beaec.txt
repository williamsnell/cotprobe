Question:

Describe the structure and function of the nuclear membrane.

Options:

A: The nuclear membrane is a single layer structure
B: The nuclear membrane has no connection with the endoplasmic reticulum
C: The nuclear pores facilitate the movement of large particles only, such as whole organelles
D: The nuclear membrane dissolves during interphase and reforms during mitosis
E: The nuclear membrane is a continuous extension of the plasma membrane
F: The nuclear pores are closed structures
G: The nuclear membrane is composed of a single phospholipid bilayer with no associated proteins
H: The nuclear membrane contains no pores, instead relying on transport proteins embedded in the membrane for substance exchange
I: The nuclear membrane consists of two leaflets of membrane, one facing the nucleus and the other facing the cytoplasm, and has many nuclear pores which provide a means for nuclear-cytoplasmic communication.
J: The nuclear membrane is completely impermeable, blocking all substances from entering or exiting the nucleus

Okay, so I have this question about the nuclear membrane, and I'm supposed to pick the correct description from the options A to J. Hmm, I remember that the nuclear membrane, also called the nuclear envelope, is a double-layered structure around the nucleus. Let me think about each part.

The question asks about both structure and function. From what I recall, the nuclear membrane is composed of two phospholipid bilayers, so that's two layers. Wait, so it's a double membrane structure. That might help eliminate some options.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a single layer. That can't be right because I remember it's double. So A is incorrect.

Option B claims no connection with the ER. Oh wait, the nuclear membrane is actually connected to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ER is attached to it, so B is wrong.

Option C says nuclear pores only allow large particles like organelles. No, that's not right. I think the nuclear pores allow transport of molecules like mRNA out and proteins in, but they're selective. Also, whole organelles can't pass through the pores, so C is incorrect.

Option D says the membrane dissolves during interphase and reforms in mitosis. Wait, no, I think the opposite. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down (dissolves) so that the chromosomes can be accessed. So during interphase, it's intact. So D is wrong because it says it dissolves during interphase, which is incorrect.

Option E says it's a continuous extension of the plasma membrane. I don't think so. The nuclear membrane is separate from the plasma membrane, though the ER is connected to both. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: nuclear pores are closed structures. No, the pores are open channels that allow certain molecules to pass through. So F is incorrect.

Option G: single bilayer with no proteins. No, the nuclear membrane has proteins, and it's two bilayers. So G is wrong.

Option H: no pores, uses transport proteins. No, the nuclear membrane has pores, so H is wrong.

Option I: two leaflets, facing nucleus and cytoplasm, with pores. Yes, this sounds right. It describes the structure as two membranes (two leaflets) and mentions the pores facilitating communication.

Option J: completely impermeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selectively permeable, allowing some substances through the pores. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option I.

The nuclear membrane, also known as the nuclear envelope, is a double-layered structure consisting of two phospholipid bilayers. It is not a single layer (eliminating option A) and is connected to the endoplasmic reticulum, so option B is incorrect. The nuclear pores do not allow whole organelles to pass (eliminating option C) and are not closed structures (eliminating option F). The nuclear membrane does not dissolve during interphase but rather during mitosis, so option D is incorrect. It is not a continuous extension of the plasma membrane (eliminating option E) and is not completely impermeable (eliminating option J). Option G is incorrect because the nuclear membrane contains proteins, and option H is wrong because it does have nuclear pores. 

Option I correctly describes the nuclear membrane as consisting of two leaflets of membrane, one facing the nucleus and the other the cytoplasm, with nuclear pores facilitating nuclear-cytoplasmic communication.

Answer: I
