Okay, so I have this problem about a draft that Ralph accepted, and I need to find the proceeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. Ralph accepted a draft for $620 on October 25. The draft is dated October 10 and is due 3 months after sight. It was discounted on November 16 at a rate of 4 and a half percent. There's also a bank collection fee of 1/8 percent. I need to find the proceeds of the draft.

Wait, okay, so a draft is like a bill of exchange. When it's accepted, it becomes a promise to pay. Since it's dated October 10 and due 3 months after sight, I think that means the due date is three months from when it was accepted. Oh wait, no, wait: Ralph accepted it on October 25. So the due date is three months after that date, right? Because 'after sight' usually means after the draft is accepted. So the due date would be January 25, because October has 31 days. Let me check that.

October 25 plus three months would be January 25. Because October 25 to November 25 is one month, November 25 to December 25 is the second, and December 25 to January 25 is the third. Yeah, that makes sense. So the due date is January 25.

Now, the draft was discounted on November 16. So the bank is discounting it before it's due. That means the bank is essentially buying the draft and paying the holder the present value. The discount rate is 4.5%, and there's a collection fee of 1/8 percent. Hmm, so I need to calculate the discount and the fee.

Wait, but when a draft is discounted, the proceeds are calculated by subtracting the discount and any fees from the face value. So the formula might be something like:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Discount + Fees)

Alternatively, the present value is calculated using the discount rate over the time period.

First, I need to find the number of days from November 16 to the due date, January 25. Because the discount is based on the time until maturity.

Wait, let me think: November 16 to November 30 is 14 days (since 30-16=14). December has 31 days, so adding that gives 14 + 31 = 45 days. Then from January 1 to January 25 is 25 days. So total is 14 +31 +25 = 70 days. Wait, 14+31 is 45, plus 25 is 70. So 70 days.

Wait wait, but sometimes in these calculations, do they count the discount period as days or months? Oh wait, the discount is usually calculated using the exact days. So 70 days.

Now, the discount rate is 4.5%, and the collection fee is 1/8 percent. So the discount would be based on the face value, the time in days, and the rate. But wait, I think the discounting uses the formula for simple interest, which is I = P * r * t. Where t is in years.

So first, I need to calculate the time in years. 70 days is how many years? Well, 70 divided by 365 is approximately 0.1918 years.

So the discount would be 620 * 4.5% * (70/365). Then the collection fee is 620 * (1/8)%, same time period? Or is the fee a flat fee? Hmm, the problem says a collection fee of (1/8)%, but I'm not entirely sure if that's a percentage per annum or a flat fee. Wait, usually, the collection fee is a flat fee, but sometimes it's also based on time. Hmm, the problem states it's a collection fee of (1/8)%, so I think that's an annual rate as well.

Wait, but sometimes the collection fee is a one-time fee, not based on time. I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again: "bank charges (1/8)% collection fee." Hmm, the phrasing is a bit unclear. It could mean 1/8 percent per annum, or maybe a flat 1/8 of a percent of the face value regardless of time. I think in this context, it's a flat fee based on the face value. Because the discount is already being calculated with the time factor. So maybe the collection fee is (1/8)% of $620, without considering the time.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. If the collection fee were a flat fee, then it would be a one-time deduction. So for example, if the fee is 1/8 of a percent of the face value, that's 620 * 0.00125. Alternatively, if it's a fee based on time, like the discount, then it would be 620 * 0.00125 * (70/365). But I think it's more likely that the collection fee is a flat fee, as it's a service charge for handling the collection, not based on time.

So proceeding with that assumption, the discount is 620 * 4.5% * (70/365), and the collection fee is 620 * (1/8)%. Then the proceeds are face value minus discount minus fee.

Wait, alternatively, in some cases, the discount might be calculated as the sum of the interest and the fees, but I'm not certain. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the discount on the draft.
2. Calculate the collection fee.
3. Subtract both from the face value to get the proceeds.

Okay, so let's compute each part.

First, the discount:

Discount = Face Value * Rate * Time

Face Value = $620

Rate = 4.5% per annum = 0.045

Time = 70 days / 365 ≈ 0.1918 years

So discount = 620 * 0.045 * 0.1918 ≈ Let me compute that.

First, 620 * 0.045 = 27.9.

Then, 27.9 * 0.1918 ≈ Let's see. 27.9 * 0.2 is 5.58, but since it's 0.1918, which is a bit less. Let's compute 27.9 * 0.1918:

0.1918 * 27.9:

Compute 27.9 * 0.1 = 2.79

27.9 * 0.09 = 2.511

27.9 * 0.0018 = approximately 0.05022

Adding them up: 2.79 + 2.511 = 5.301 + 0.05022 ≈ 5.35122

So discount ≈ $5.35.

Wait, wait, let me use a calculator approach:

620 * 0.045 = 27.9.

27.9 * (70/365) = 27.9 * (0.1917818) ≈ Let me compute 27.9 * 0.1917818:

27.9 * 0.1 = 2.79

27.9 * 0.09 = 2.511

27.9 * 0.0017818 ≈ 0.0498.

Adding those together: 2.79 + 2.511 = 5.301 + 0.0498 ≈ 5.3508. So approximately $5.35.

Now, the collection fee. Assuming it's a flat fee of 1/8 percent on the face value.

1/8 percent is 0.125%, so 0.00125.

So collection fee = 620 * 0.00125 = 0.775.

So $0.775.

Wait, 620 * 0.00125: 620 * 0.001 = 0.62, 620 * 0.00025=0.155. So total 0.62 + 0.155 = 0.775.

So the total deductions are discount ($5.35) and fee ($0.775), totaling approximately $6.125.

So the proceeds would be 620 - 6.125 = $613.875.

Looking at the options, option C is $613.79. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discount. Let me recalculate.

Alternative approach: compute the exact days.

From November 16 to January 25.

November: 30 days. So from Nov 16 to Nov 30 is 14 days.

December: 31 days.

January: 25 days.

Total: 14 +31 +25 =70 days.

So 70 days is correct.

So discount is 620 * 4.5% * (70/365).

Compute 70/365 = 0.1917818.

So 620 * 0.045 = 27.9.

27.9 * 0.1917818 ≈ Let me compute this accurately.

27.9 * 0.1917818:

Break it down:

0.1 * 27.9 = 2.79

0.09 *27.9 = 2.511

0.0017818 *27.9≈ 0.0497.

Adding all: 2.79 + 2.511=5.301 +0.0497=5.3507.

So discount is approximately $5.3507.

Fee is $0.775.

Total deductions: 5.3507 + 0.775 = 6.1257.

Proceeds: 620 - 6.1257 = 613.8743, which rounds to 613.87. The options have C as $613.79. Hmm, that's a bit off. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the discount and fee more precisely.

Let me compute the discount:

620 * 0.045 = 27.9.

27.9 * (70/365) = ?

70 divided by 365 is exactly 0.191781818...

So 27.9 * 0.191781818.

Let me compute this:

27.9 * 0.191781818 = ?

I can compute this as:

0.191781818 = approx 0.19178182.

Compute 27.9 * 0.19178182.

Let me do it step by step:

27.9 * 0.1 = 2.79

27.9 * 0.09 = 2.511

27.9 * 0.00178182 ≈ Let's compute 27.9 * 0.001 = 0.0279, 27.9 * 0.00078182 ≈ 0.0218.

So add those parts: 0.0279 + 0.0218 ≈ 0.0497.

So total discount: 2.79 + 2.511 + 0.0497 = 5.3507.

So discount is $5.3507.

Fee is $0.775.

Total deduction: 5.3507 + 0.775 = 6.1257.

Proceeds = 620 - 6.1257 = 613.8743 ≈ $613.87.

But the options have C as $613.79. Hmm, that's a 0.08 difference. Maybe I made a mistake in the fee calculation.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is also based on the time, so it's (1/8)% per annum multiplied by the time. Let me try that.

So collection fee would be 620 * (1/8)% * (70/365).

(1/8)% is 0.125%, so 0.00125.

So fee = 620 * 0.00125 * (70/365).

Compute 620 * 0.00125 = 0.775.

0.775 * (70/365) = 0.775 * 0.1917818 ≈ Let me compute:

0.775 * 0.1917818.

0.7 * 0.1917818 ≈ 0.134347.

0.075 * 0.1917818 ≈ 0.014384.

Adding them: 0.134347 + 0.014384 ≈ 0.14873.

So fee ≈ $0.14873.

So total deductions now are discount ($5.3507) plus fee ($0.14873), totaling 5.3507 + 0.14873 = 5.49943.

Proceeds = 620 - 5.49943 ≈ 614.50057. Hmm, that's around $614.50, which doesn't match any of the options. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is a flat fee, so it's just 0.775 as I first thought, and the discrepancy is due to rounding differences. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discount more accurately.

Compute 620 * 0.045 = 27.9.

27.9 * (70/365) = ?

70/365 = 0.191781818.

So 27.9 * 0.191781818.

Let me compute this precisely:

27.9 * 0.1 = 2.79

27.9 * 0.09 = 2.511

27.9 * 0.001781818 = ?

Compute 27.9 * 0.001 = 0.0279

27.9 * 0.000781818 ≈ 0.02183.

So 0.0279 + 0.02183 ≈ 0.04973.

So total discount: 2.79 + 2.511 + 0.04973 = 5.35073.

So discount is $5.35073.

Fee is $0.775.

Total deductions: 5.35073 + 0.775 = 6.12573.

Proceeds: 620 - 6.12573 = 613.87427.

Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $613.87. But the option C is $613.79, which is 8 cents less.

Hmmm, maybe I made a mistake in the days calculation. Let me double-check the days. November 16 to January 25.

Wait, November has 30 days, so November 16 to November 30 is 14 days (including the 16th or not?). Wait, when counting days for discounting, usually, the day of discounting is not included. So from November 16 (the day of discounting) to November 30 is 14 days (since 30-16=14, but if you include the 16th, it's 15 days). Wait, no, the formula is usually (date of maturity - date of discounting) in days. So November 16 to November 30 is 14 days (since 30-16=14). Then December is 31, and January 25 is 25 days. So total 14+31+25=70 days. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the time period is computed in months instead of days, but that seems unlikely because the discount is usually calculated with exact days.

Another thought: perhaps the collection fee is 1/8% of the discounted amount, not the face value. Wait, that would make it a bit more complicated.

Wait, if the collection fee is 1/8% on the discounted value, then the fee would be based on (face value - discount). But that's probably not the case. Usually, fees are on the face value.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the proceeds as the present value minus the fee.

Wait, another approach: the present value is face value minus discount. Then the proceeds are present value minus the collection fee.

But that doesn't make much sense because the fee is a charge by the bank, so it's usually subtracted before the discount, or included in the discount.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The bank buys the draft at a discount, and charges a collection fee. So the proceeds would be the present value minus the fee.

So first, compute the present value: FV / (1 + r*t). Or using simple interest, present value = FV - (FV * r * t).

Then subtract the fee.

Wait, let's try that.

FV is $620.

r is 4.5% per annum.

t is 70/365 years.

Simple interest: Interest = 620 * 0.045 * (70/365) = $5.35073.

So present value = 620 - 5.35073 = 614.64927.

Then, subtract the collection fee, which is 1/8% of FV: 0.775.

So proceeds = 614.64927 - 0.775 = 613.87427, same as before.

So that gives $613.87, but the option is $613.79. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is calculated on the discounted amount instead of the face value.

So collection fee = (present value) * (1/8)%.

So present value is 614.64927.

Fee = 614.64927 * 0.00125 ≈ 0.76831.

So proceeds = 614.64927 - 0.76831 ≈ 613.88096, which rounds to $613.88. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the fee as (1/8)% per annum on the face value and time. So fee = 620 * 0.00125 * (70/365).

Let me compute that.

620 * 0.00125 = 0.775.

0.775 * (70/365) ≈ 0.775 * 0.19178 ≈ 0.1487.

So fee is $0.1487.

Then, discount is $5.3507.

Total deductions: 5.3507 + 0.1487 = 5.4994.

Proceeds = 620 - 5.4994 = 614.5006, which is approximately $614.50. But none of the options match that either.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is $610.33, which is lower, and option H is $618.47, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the discount is calculated differently, perhaps using 360 days instead of 365. Let me try that.

So time in years would be 70/360 ≈ 0.194444 years.

Discount = 620 * 0.045 * 0.194444 ≈ Let's compute that.

620 * 0.045 = 27.9.

27.9 * 0.194444 ≈ 5.420.

So discount ≈ $5.42.

Fee is still $0.775.

Proceeds = 620 -5.42 -0.775 = 620 -6.195 = 613.805.

Rounded
