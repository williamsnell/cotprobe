Okay, so I have this question here about a 2008 survey regarding corporate responsibility reporting among the world's largest companies. The question is asking what percentage of these companies were reporting their corporate responsibility at that time. The options are from A to J, each representing different percentages.

First, I need to think about what I know about corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting trends. I remember that in the mid to late 2000s, there was an increasing focus on sustainability and transparency among large corporations. More companies were starting to publish reports on their environmental and social impacts. 

I think the percentage has been rising over the years. For example, I recall that by 2010 or so, a significant majority of the largest companies were doing this. But since the question is about 2008, maybe the number was a bit lower than that. 

Wait, but I also remember reading somewhere that by 2008, a large proportion of big companies were already reporting. Maybe around 80% or so? Or was it lower? Let me try to piece this together.

I think the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was already established by then, and more companies were adopting these guidelines. Also, stock exchanges and investors were starting to pay more attention to CSR, which would encourage companies to report. 

But wait, if I remember correctly, the percentage was actually quite high. I think in 2008, it was around 80%. But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: perhaps it was 70%? Or maybe even higher, like 90%? 

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the years. I know that by 2011 or so, over 90% of the top companies were reporting, but that's after 2008. So maybe in 2008, the number was lower, like 70% or 80%. 

Wait, another angle: I think the KPMG surveys on CSR reporting have some historical data. From what I recall, KPMG's surveys showed that in 2008, around 80% of the world's largest companies were publishing CSR reports. That seems familiar. 

So looking at the options, E is 80%, F is 70%. So if my memory is right, the answer would be E:80%. But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes these figures can vary based on the sample size or the survey's criteria.

Alternatively, maybe it's 70%? I'm not 100% sure. But leaning towards 80% because I think that was a key finding around that time.

The question asks about the percentage of the world's largest companies reporting their corporate responsibility in 2008. Considering the increasing focus on sustainability and transparency during the mid to late 2000s, and the influence of initiatives like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), it is reasonable to infer that a significant proportion of large companies were already adopting CSR reporting practices by 2008. 

Recalling historical data, particularly from KPMG's surveys on CSR reporting, it is suggested that around 80% of the world's largest companies were publishing CSR reports by 2008. This aligns with the growing emphasis on transparency and accountability among corporations during that period.

Answer: E
