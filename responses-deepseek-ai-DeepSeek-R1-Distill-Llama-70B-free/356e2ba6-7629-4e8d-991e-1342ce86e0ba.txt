Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Sun Ra and where he claimed he was born. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Sun Ra was a jazz musician, but he was also known for his really out-there personality and beliefs. I think he had some kind of cosmic or space-themed persona. I've heard that he made some pretty wild claims about his origins.

Wait, I think he claimed he was from another planet. Saturn rings a bell. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall. I remember reading somewhere that he said he came from Saturn, which is a pretty bold statement. But I should double-check my memory.

Looking at the options, A is Saturn, which seems to fit. But there are other options like Mars, Venus, the Moon, etc. Did he maybe say another planet? I don't think so. I think Saturn was his go-to because of the association with the rings and maybe some mythological connections.

Alternatively, I've heard of people claiming Atlantis, which is option B. But that's more of a mythical place on Earth, right? Sun Ra's thing was more about space, so Saturn makes more sense.

I'm trying to remember any specific songs or albums. Oh, wait, he had an album called "Space is the Place," which definitely leans into the space theme. So Saturn would fit that narrative.

Another thought: I think he also claimed to have been born on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, but he later rejected that, saying he was actually from Saturn. So he had a real Earth birthplace but claimed a cosmic origin for his persona.

So putting it all together, the answer should be A: Saturn.

Sun Ra claimed he was born on Saturn. This aligns with his cosmic persona and themes in his music, such as the album "Space is the Place." While he was born in Birmingham, Alabama, he rejected that origin story in favor of a more otherworldly narrative.

Answer: A
