Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about human cells. Let me see what it's asking. The question is about what's typically not found in normal somatic cells of a human male. The options are A through D. 

Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic biology. Somatic cells are the regular body cells, right? Not the reproductive ones like sperm or eggs. And human males have their cells as diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes. 

So, the options:

Option A: The entire genetic information from the original zygote. Well, the zygote is the fertilized egg, which has all the genetic info. Somatic cells are diploid and should have the same genetic info as the zygote, except for some possible mutations. So I think A would be found in somatic cells. Unless... Oh wait, no, because during development, cells differentiate and express different genes, but the genetic info is still all there. So A is present.

Option B: An inactivated X chromosome. Wait, males have XY as their sex chromosomes. So in females, one X is inactivated (like in Barr bodies), but males have only one X. So would a somatic cell in males have an inactive X? No, because they don't have two Xs. So B shouldn't be present. Hmm. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. In males, their sex chromosomes are XY. Each cell has one X and one Y. The X isn't inactivated because they only have one. So B is not found in male somatic cells. So B is the correct answer? Or wait, wait. Looking back at the options, the question is about what's NOT found. So if the question is asking what's not present, then B would be the answer because males don't have an inactivated X. 

Option C: Forty-four autosomes. Wait, the human genome has 46 chromosomes total. For males, 44 autosomes plus XY. So each somatic cell has 44 autosomes. So C is present in the cells. So C is not the answer.

Option D: A diploid nucleus. Somatic cells are diploid, so yes, D is present. So D is not the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. So the question is which is typically NOT found. So the correct answer would be B, because males don't inactivate X chromosomes; females do because they have two Xs. So in a male, each cell has one X and one Y. So no inactivated X. 

Wait, but if it's a somatic cell, in males, the X is active, right? Because each cell has an X and a Y. So B is an inactivated X, which is not present. So B is the answer.

In normal somatic cells of a human male, the following can be analyzed:

- **Option A**: The entire genetic information from the original zygote is present in somatic cells, as they are diploid and retain the same genetic material as the zygote. Therefore, this is found in somatic cells.  

- **Option B**: An inactivated X chromosome is typically found in female somatic cells due to X-chromosome inactivation (e.g., Barr body). However, males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome), so there is no need for inactivation. Thus, an inactivated X chromosome is not found in male somatic cells.  

- **Option C**: Forty-four autosomes are present in human males, as the total chromosome count is 46 (44 autosomes + XY). This is found in somatic cells.  

- **Option D**: A diploid nucleus is characteristic of somatic cells, which contain two complete sets of chromosomes. This is found in somatic cells.  

The correct answer is **B**, as an inactivated X chromosome is not typically found in normal somatic cells of a human male.  

Answer: B
