Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about when a psychologist can inform an employee's supervisor that the employee is receiving treatment through the company's EAP. I'm a bit rusty on confidentiality laws, but I'll try to work through this.

First, I remember that psychologists have a duty of confidentiality. They can't just disclose someone's treatment to others without consent. But there are exceptions, like if there's a risk of harm to self or others. But this question is about informing the supervisor, so I need to think about the specific rules here.

The question gives a scenario where the employee is using the company's EAP. I think EAPs are usually confidential, meaning the employer doesn't get detailed information about the employee's treatment. The purpose of EAPs is to help employees with personal or work-related issues, and confidentiality is key so employees feel safe using them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Only if the treatment plan involves the workplace. I'm not sure about this. The psychologist might need to coordinate with the workplace, but would they inform the supervisor without consent? Maybe, but I don't think it's that broad.

Option B: If the supervisor is also a client. That seems like a conflict of interest. I don't think the psychologist can disclose just because the supervisor is also a client. Confidentiality should still apply.

Option C: Treatment related to a workplace incident. Maybe, but again, without consent, I'm not sure the psychologist can disclose that. Unless it's a mandatory report, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option D: If insurance requires it. Wait, but the EAP is usually separate from insurance. EAP sessions might not even go through the employee's health insurance. So I'm doubting this one.

Option E: As long as no other info is given. So they can just say the employee is in treatment, but nothing else. I'm not sure if that's allowed. I think even acknowledging that the employee is in treatment might be a breach without consent.

Option F: Only if the employee gives explicit permission. This sounds right. Confidentiality usually requires consent unless there's an emergency. So the psychologist would need the employee's explicit permission to tell the supervisor.

Option G: Supervisor signs a waiver. Not sure about this. It depends on the policies, but generally, the employee's consent is what's needed, not the supervisor's waiver.

Option H: Only if treatment affects job performance. If the treatment is affecting work, maybe the supervisor needs to know, but still, without consent, I think the psychologist can't disclose. Unless it's an imminent danger, but that's not mentioned here.

Option I: Under no circumstance. That seems too strict. There might be exceptions, like if the employee consents.

Option J: Only if referred by the supervisor. I don't think that matters. The referral source doesn't change the confidentiality.

So putting it all together, the psychologist can inform the supervisor only if the employee gives explicit permission. That would be option F.

The psychologist can inform the supervisor only if the employee gives explicit permission. This adheres to confidentiality requirements unless consent is provided.

Answer: F
