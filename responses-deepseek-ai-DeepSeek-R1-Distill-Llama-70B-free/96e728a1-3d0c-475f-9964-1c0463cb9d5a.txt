Okay, so I've got this problem here about John Cowan and his family paying for their meals with sales tax involved. Hmm, let's see what I need to do here.

Alright, the question says they spent four amounts: $6.75, $5.50, $2.35, and $1.95. All of these are put on one check, and the sales tax is 3%. I need to find out how much they paid in total when everything's on one check. Then, I also need to figure out how much they would have paid if each meal was on a separate check. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to calculate both scenarios and match my answers to the options.

First, let's tackle the first part: when all the purchases are on a single check. I think I should add up all the meal amounts first before applying the sales tax. So, adding $6.75 + $5.50 + $2.35 + $1.95.

Wait, let me do that step by step. 6.75 plus 5.50... that's 12.25. Then add 2.35: 12.25 + 2.35 is 14.60. Then add 1.95: 14.60 + 1.95 = 16.55. So the total before tax is $16.55.

Now, applying the 3% sales tax. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Oh right, you take the total and multiply by the tax rate. So 16.55 * 0.03. Let me compute that. 0.03 times 16 is 0.48, and 0.03 times 0.55 is 0.0165. Adding those together: 0.48 + 0.0165 is 0.4965. So the tax is $0.4965. But since we're dealing with money, we round to the nearest cent, which would be $0.50.

So the total amount they paid is the sum plus tax: 16.55 + 0.50 = $17.05. Wait, but let me double-check that calculation to be sure. 16.55 times 0.03. Let me compute it another way: 16.55 * 3 = 49.65, then divide by 100 to get 0.4965, which is 0.50 when rounded. Yep, that's correct.

Okay, that's the first part. Now, the second part: if each meal was on a separate check, how much would they have paid? So each meal's amount would be taxed individually, and then summed up.

That means I need to calculate the tax for each individual amount and then add all the totals together.

Let me list each amount and compute the tax for each:

1. $6.75 meal: tax is 6.75 * 0.03 = 0.2025 → $0.20 (rounded to nearest cent)
   Total for this meal: 6.75 + 0.20 = $6.95

2. $5.50 meal: tax is 5.50 * 0.03 = 0.165 → $0.17
   Total: 5.50 + 0.17 = $5.67

3. $2.35 meal: tax is 2.35 * 0.03 = 0.0705 → $0.07
   Total: 2.35 + 0.07 = $2.42

4. $1.95 meal: tax is 1.95 * 0.03 = 0.0585 → $0.06
   Total: 1.95 + 0.06 = $2.01

Now, add all these totals together: 6.95 + 5.67 + 2.42 + 2.01.

Let me add them step by step:

6.95 + 5.67 = 12.62

12.62 + 2.42 = 15.04

15.04 + 2.01 = 17.05

Wait, that's the same total as when everything was on one check? Hmm, that's interesting. But wait, I thought when you calculate tax on individual items, sometimes the rounding can make a difference. Did I do that right?

Let me check each tax calculation again to make sure.

First meal: 6.75 * 0.03. Well, 6 * 0.03 is 0.18, 0.75 *0.03 is 0.0225. So 0.18 + 0.0225 = 0.2025, which is 0.20 when rounded. Correct.

Second: 5.50 * 0.03 = 0.165 → 0.17. Correct.

Third: 2.35 * 0.03 = 0.0705 → 0.07. Correct.

Fourth: 1.95 * 0.03 = 0.0585 → 0.06. Because 0.0585 rounds up to 0.06. Correct.

So when I add the totals, yes, it comes to $17.05 for both scenarios. Wait, but that can't be right because sometimes when you tax each item individually, the total tax might be a bit different due to rounding. But in this case, it's the same.

Wait, let me check the total tax in both cases. When all items are on one check, the total is $16.55, tax is 0.4965 (~0.50). So total paid is 17.05.

When each is taxed separately, the total tax is 0.20 + 0.17 + 0.07 + 0.06 = 0.50. So same total tax. So the total amount paid is same in both cases, $17.05.

Wait, but the question asks two things: first, how much they paid when put on one check, which is $17.05. Second, how much they would have paid if separate checks. But in this case, it's the same. So both amounts would be $17.05.

Looking at the options, option G is $17.05. So the answer would be G for both parts. But wait, the question is phrased as two separate questions, but the options are single letters, so I think the options are for the total in each scenario. Wait, no, the question says "how much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?" So the first part is one amount, the second part another. Wait, but in this case, both are same. So the total for both scenarios would be same, $17.05 each.

Wait, but the options given only have single letters, so perhaps the question is asking for the total in each case. So the first answer is $17.05, the second is also $17.05. But looking at the options, G is $17.05, which is one of the choices.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, when they put everything on one check, the total before tax is 16.55. Tax is 3% of that, 0.4965, rounded to 0.50. So total is 17.05.

When each is separate, each item's tax is added, then summed. As I did, each tax is 0.20, 0.17, 0.07, 0.06. Total tax is 0.50. So total is 16.55 +0.50 = 17.05. So same as the first case.

So both totals are 17.05. So the answer for both parts is 17.05. But the options only have single letters, so perhaps the question is asking for each scenario, but the options are for the combined total. Wait, the question says, "how much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?" So the first part is 17.05, the second part is also 17.05. But looking at the options, only G is 17.05.

So the answers to both questions would be G. But wait, the options are labeled A to J, each a single amount. So perhaps the intended answer is that both are the same, so the correct option is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the individual totals. Let me sum the individual totals again.

6.95 (first meal) +5.67= 12.62. 12.62 +2.42=15.04. 15.04 +2.01=17.05. Yep, correct.

So the answer for both is 17.05. So the correct option is G.

To determine how much John Cowan and his family paid, we analyze two scenarios: when all purchases are on one check and when each purchase is on a separate check.

### Scenario 1: All purchases on one check
1. **Total before tax**:  
   Add the amounts spent on meals:  
   \[
   6.75 + 5.50 + 2.35 + 1.95 = 16.55
   \]  
2. **Sales tax**:  
   Calculate 3% of $16.55:  
   \[
   16.55 \times 0.03 = 0.4965
   \]  
   Rounded to the nearest cent, the tax is $0.50.  
3. **Total amount paid**:  
   \[
   16.55 + 0.50 = 17.05
   \]

### Scenario 2: Separate checks for each purchase
1. **Calculate tax for each meal individually**:  
   - For $6.75:  
     \[
     6.75 \times 0.03 = 0.2025 \rightarrow 0.20 \quad \text{(rounded to nearest cent)}
     \]  
     Total for this meal:  
     \[
     6.75 + 0.20 = 6.95
     \]  
   - For $5.50:  
     \[
     5.50 \times 0.03 = 0.165 \rightarrow 0.17 \quad \text{(rounded to nearest cent)}
     \]  
     Total for this meal:  
     \[
     5.50 + 0.17 = 5.67
     \]  
   - For $2.35:  
     \[
     2.35 \times 0.03 = 0.0705 \rightarrow 0.07 \quad \text{(rounded to nearest cent)}
     \]  
     Total for this meal:  
     \[
     2.35 + 0.07 = 2.42
     \]  
   - For $1.95:  
     \[
     1.95 \times 0.03 = 0.0585 \rightarrow 0.06 \quad \text{(rounded to nearest cent)}
     \]  
     Total for this meal:  
     \[
     1.95 + 0.06 = 2.01
     \]  

2. **Total amount paid**:  
   Add the totals for all meals:  
   \[
   6.95 + 5.67 + 2.42 + 2.01 = 17.05
   \]  

### Conclusion
In both scenarios, the total amount paid is **$17.05**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: $17.05**
