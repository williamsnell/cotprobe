Question:

Cooper is suing March for money damages. Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial. What is the court's likely ruling?

Options:

A: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only if he can prove that March's statements are unreliable.
B: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only if March's attorney is present during the reading.
C: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as it is considered hearsay.
D: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.
E: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but must read the entire deposition, not just selected parts.
F: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as it would violate March's right to confrontation.
G: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.
H: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.
I: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, unless March is unavailable to testify.
J: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.

Okay, so I have this question about using a deposition at trial, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me think about what I know about depositions and evidence rules.

So, Cooper is suing March for money damages. Cooper's attorney wants to use parts of March's deposition at trial instead of calling March as a witness. March objects. The question is whether the court will allow this.

From what I remember, depositions can be used at trial under certain circumstances. Depositions are sworn testimony taken outside of court, right? They're usually used for discovery, but sometimes they can be used at trial.

I think the key here is whether March is available to testify. If a witness is available, the general rule is that you can't just use their deposition unless certain exceptions apply. Like, if the witness is unavailable, then their deposition can be used as prior testimony. But if the witness is available, the party might choose to use the deposition instead of having the witness testify in court. Wait, but is that allowed?

Wait, another angle: when a party's own witness is involved. If Cooper is the plaintiff, and March is the defendant, then March isn't Cooper's witness. So Cooper can't just call March as his own witness unless he's a hostile witness or something. But in this case, Cooper's attorney is choosing to use the deposition instead of calling March. 

I think there's a rule about using depositions at trial. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 32, I believe that a deposition can be used if it's being offered by a party-opponent. So if March is the defendant, and Cooper is using March's deposition, that would be a party-opponent situation. So Cooper can use it without March being unavailable.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Another thought: there's something about whether the witness is available or not. If March is available to testify, Cooper might still use the deposition if it's used for impeachment purposes or if the court allows it for some other reason.

Wait, but there's another rule—Rule 32(a)—which says that a deposition may be used by any party for any purpose if all the parties to the deposition have been given notice, etc., but I think that's more about when the deposition is taken. Then, Rule 32(b) talks about when a deposition can be used at trial. It says that any part or all of a deposition may be offered by a party-opponent, but I'm not sure if the witness's availability matters here.

Wait, but I think under Rule 32(b), if the witness is available, you can still use the deposition as a prior statement by a party-opponent. Because a party admission is an exception to hearsay. So in this case, March's deposition statements would be admissible as a party admission, regardless of availability.

So Cooper's attorney can read parts of the deposition at trial because March is the opposing party. But wait, there's another consideration. When using a deposition, you have to read the parts that are relevant, but you might have to include other parts if they're necessary for fairness. Like, you can't just cherry-pick parts that help your case without including context.

Looking at the options, option H says Cooper may use the deposition but must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered. That sounds familiar. I think that's part of the rule—when you introduce part of a deposition, you have to include other parts that are necessary to give the statement context and avoid misleading the jury.

So, putting it together: Cooper can use the deposition because March is a party-opponent, so it's a hearsay exception. But he can't just read selected parts; he has to include any parts that are necessary for a fair understanding. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options. Option I says Cooper can't use it unless March is unavailable. But I thought availability isn't the issue when it's a party-opponent. So I is incorrect.

Option C says it's hearsay, but as a party admission, it's not hearsay, so C is wrong.

Option E says must read the entire deposition, but no, you can read relevant parts as long as you include necessary context, so E is incorrect.

Option G is about using it to impeach, but Cooper isn't using it to impeach March's testimony because he's not calling March. He's using it as substantive evidence, so G might not apply here.

Option H seems right. So I think the answer is H.

The question revolves around whether Cooper can use March's deposition at trial over March's objection. Cooper's attorney intends to read selected parts of the deposition instead of calling March as a witness. The key issue is the admissibility of the deposition under the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 32.

Depositions are sworn testimony taken outside of court and can be used at trial under certain conditions. Rule 32(b) allows a party-opponent to use a deposition for any purpose, including as substantive evidence, without requiring the witness to be unavailable. Since March is the opposing party, Cooper can use the deposition as a party admission, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. This means Cooper does not need to demonstrate that March is unavailable to testify.

However, when using a deposition, the court requires that any parts introduced must be accompanied by other parts necessary for a fair understanding of the testimony. This prevents the selective use of deposition testimony in a misleading or incomplete manner. Therefore, Cooper may use the deposition but must read all parts that, in fairness, ought to be considered with the introduced sections.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, F, I, J**: These options are incorrect because they either misstate the rules regarding hearsay, availability, or the use of depositions.
- **C**: Incorrect because a party admission is not hearsay.
- **E**: Incorrect because Cooper is not required to read the entire deposition, only the parts necessary for fairness.
- **G**: Incorrect because the deposition is being used as substantive evidence, not solely for impeachment.
- **H**: Correct because it aligns with the rule requiring fairness in the use of deposition testimony.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.**

Answer: H
