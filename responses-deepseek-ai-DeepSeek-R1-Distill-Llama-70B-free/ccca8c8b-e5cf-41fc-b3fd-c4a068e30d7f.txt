Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

According to usual practice, a long-time regular customer left her car at an auto mechanic's shop with written instructions to "check and tune up the engine; make sure the brakes are good and working; examine the tires; also, check and repair all major systems because I am driving cross country next week." She did not see the mechanic or discuss with him the price or other details. When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?

Options:

A: No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.
B: No, because there was no written agreement specifying the cost of the services.
C: Yes, because she left written instructions, which can be considered a contract.
D: Yes, because she had a history of leaving her car for service without discussing price or details.
E: Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.
F: No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.
G: Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.
H: No, because the mechanic did not provide an estimate before performing the services.
I: No, because she did not explicitly agree to the price of the services.
J: Yes, because the quality of the work was satisfactory and pertained to the areas in the instructions.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's break it down step by step. So, the situation is a customer left her car with a mechanic, gave written instructions for several things—like checking the engine, brakes, tires, and major systems because she's driving cross country. She didn't discuss the price or details with the mechanic and when she picked up the car, there was a $5,000 bill. She's refusing to pay, saying there was no agreement and the mechanic should have called for approval first.

Hmm, the question is whether she can be held responsible for the services performed. So, the issue here is about contract formation, specifically whether there was an agreement between the customer and the mechanic.

In contract law, generally, for a contract to be enforceable, there must be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, sometimes contracts can be implied based on the circumstances. Let's think about the types of contracts here.

She gave written instructions, which could be considered as an offer. The mechanic, by performing the services, would be accepting that offer. So, that could form a contract. But wait, sometimes when you take your car to a mechanic, there's an implied agreement that they'll do the necessary work, and you'll pay for it. But how about the price?

I remember that in some cases, if a customer doesn't specify a price and the work is done, the customer is liable to pay a reasonable amount. So, even if she didn't agree to the price beforehand, as long as the charges are reasonable, she might still have to pay. But the question says all services were workmanlike and pertained to the areas she instructed, but she's arguing no agreement.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A says no because there's an implication that the provider must get permission for unapproved work. But her instructions were broad—like check and repair all major systems. So any work within that scope might be covered. I'm not sure if A is correct because she gave a general instruction, so the mechanic might not need to call for approval for each part as long as it's within the scope.

Option B says no because there's no written agreement on cost. But contracts can be oral or implied, so the lack of a written cost agreement might not negate the contract.

Option C says yes because the written instructions are a contract. That makes sense because the instructions could serve as the terms, and the mechanic's performance as acceptance.

Option D says yes because of prior history. She's a long-time customer and maybe they've done business without discussing prices before. This suggests an implied agreement based on past dealings, which could be a factor.

Option E says yes because circumstances, including prior practice, show intent and meeting of minds. That sounds like an implied contract, where the parties' actions and prior dealings imply agreement.

Option F says no because contracts can't be based on implications. But that's not true; implied contracts are a thing.

Option G says yes because it's an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent. Wait, implied-in-law contracts are usually about restitution when there's no actual agreement but it's unfair not to pay. But mutual assent is more about actual contracts, so G might be mixing terms.

Option H says no because no estimate was provided. Some places require estimates, but I'm not sure if it's a legal requirement everywhere. It might depend on local laws, but the question doesn't specify that, so maybe it's not the main issue.

Option I says no because she didn't agree to the price. But as I thought earlier, if the price is reasonable, she might still be liable without explicit agreement.

Option J says yes because the work was satisfactory and related. But the quality isn't the main issue here—it's the agreement to pay.

So, the key points are whether there was an implied contract and whether the mechanic needed to get approval for each service. She gave broad written instructions, which the mechanic followed. Also, she's a regular customer, so there's a course of dealing. 

In such cases, courts often find that there's an implied agreement to pay for services rendered based on the customer's instructions and the provider's performance. The fact that she didn't discuss the price doesn't necessarily negate the contract because the price can be implied as reasonable.

So, looking at the options, E and D seem relevant. E mentions circumstances including prior practice showing intent and meeting of minds. D is about prior history without discussing prices. Both could apply, but E is broader, including all circumstances. The prior practice (D) would be part of those circumstances.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.

The question revolves around whether a customer can be held responsible for contractual services performed by a mechanic when she left her car with written instructions but did not discuss the price or details beforehand. The key issue is whether a contract was formed, which requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. Additionally, contracts can be implied based on the circumstances, including prior dealings and the reasonableness of the services performed.

The customer provided written instructions, which could be interpreted as an offer, and the mechanic accepted by performing the work. Although there was no explicit agreement on the price, the work was reasonable, workmanlike, and within the scope of the instructions. The customer's status as a long-time regular customer suggests a course of dealing, where prior interactions imply an understanding of the terms, including payment for services rendered.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect because the broad instructions likely covered the work performed, so the mechanic did not need to seek approval for every detail.
- **B**: Incorrect because contracts do not always require written agreements on cost; implied contracts are valid.
- **C**: Partially correct but incomplete, as it focuses only on the written instructions without considering the broader context of prior dealings.
- **D**: Relevant but narrower, focusing solely on prior history without addressing the full circumstances.
- **E**: Correct because it encompasses the circumstances, including prior practice, to establish intent and mutual assent.
- **F**: Incorrect because implied contracts are recognized in law.
- **G**: Incorrect because it conflates implied-in-law contracts (based on restitution) with mutual assent (implied-in-fact contracts).
- **H**: Incorrect because the absence of an estimate is not necessarily determinative.
- **I**: Incorrect because explicit agreement to the price is not required if the charges are reasonable.
- **J**: Incorrect because the quality of work, while relevant, does not address the contractual issue.

The correct answer is **E**, as it best captures the formation of an implied contract based on the circumstances, including prior practice, which demonstrates intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.

**Answer: E**
