Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the entropy change for a system at 298 K. The reaction given is Ti(s) + 2Cl2(g) → TiCl4(l). And I have the standard entropy values for each substance at 25°C, which is 298 K. 

Hmm, I remember that the entropy change of the system (ΔS°) is calculated using the formula: ΔS° = Σ S°(products) - Σ S°(reactants). Right, so I need to sum the entropy of the products and subtract the sum of the reactants.

Looking at the reaction, the products are TiCl4(l), and the reactants are Ti(s) and Cl2(g). The stoichiometric coefficients matter here. So for the reactants, Ti has a coefficient of 1, and Cl2 has 2. 

So let me jot down the values:

- Ti(s): 7.2 eu/mol
- Cl2(g): 53.3 eu/mol
- TiCl4(l): 60.4 eu/mol

Wait, so for the reactants, I have 1 mole of Ti(s) and 2 moles of Cl2(g). So the total S° for reactants is 7.2 + (2 * 53.3). Let me compute that. 2 times 53.3 is 106.6. Adding 7.2 gives 113.8 eu total for reactants.

On the product side, it's just 1 mole of TiCl4(l), so that's 60.4 eu.

Now, subtracting reactants from products: 60.4 (products) - 113.8 (reactants) = -53.4 eu.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the sign make sense here? Because the system's entropy is decreasing when the entropy change is negative. So the system is losing entropy. Let me think again. The reaction is Ti(s) and Cl2(g) forming TiCl4(l). Gases have higher entropy, so if we're going from a gas to a liquid, entropy should decrease. 

Yes, because Cl2 is a gas, which has higher entropy than the liquid product. So the system's entropy should decrease, which means a negative ΔS°. So the calculation I did makes sense.

Looking at the options, the choices are A to J. Let me look through them. Option F is -53.4 eu. Option E is -107.4, which is much more negative. Did I make a calculation error?

Wait, let me recalculate. Products: 60.4. Reactants: 7.2 + (2 *53.3). 2*53.3 is 106.6, plus 7.2 is 113.8. So 60.4 - 113.8 is indeed -53.4. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Let's see the options:

A: 107.4
B: 0
C:53.4
D:60.4
E:-107.4
F:-53.4
G:-60.4
H:-7.2
I:-10.2
J:10.2

Yes, F is -53.4. So the correct answer should be F.

To calculate the entropy change for the system at 298 K, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S^\circ = \sum S^\circ(\text{products}) - \sum S^\circ(\text{reactants})
\]

From the given data:
- \( S^\circ(\text{Ti(s)}) = 7.2 \, \text{eu/mol} \)
- \( S^\circ(\text{Cl}_2(\text{g})) = 53.3 \, \text{eu/mol} \)
- \( S^\circ(\text{TiCl}_4(\text{l})) = 60.4 \, \text{eu/mol} \)

The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ti(s)} + 2\text{Cl}_2(\text{g}) \rightarrow \text{TiCl}_4(\text{l})
\]

1. **Entropy of reactants**:
   - For \( \text{Ti(s)} \): \( 1 \times 7.2 = 7.2 \, \text{eu} \)
   - For \( 2\text{Cl}_2(\text{g}) \): \( 2 \times 53.3 = 106.6 \, \text{eu} \)
   - Total: \( 7.2 + 106.6 = 113.8 \, \text{eu} \)

2. **Entropy of products**:
   - For \( \text{TiCl}_4(\text{l}) \): \( 1 \times 60.4 = 60.4 \, \text{eu} \)

3. **Entropy change**:
   \[
   \Delta S^\circ = 60.4 - 113.8 = -53.4 \, \text{eu}
   \]

The negative value indicates a decrease in the system's entropy, which makes sense because the reaction involves converting a gas (\( \text{Cl}_2 \)) into a liquid (\( \text{TiCl}_4 \)), and gases generally have higher entropy than liquids.

From the given options:
- \( \text{F: -53.4 eu} \) matches the calculated value.

Answer: F
