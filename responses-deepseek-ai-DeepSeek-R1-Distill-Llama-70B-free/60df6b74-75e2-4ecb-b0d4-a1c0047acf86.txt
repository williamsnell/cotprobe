Question:

A student eats 3 slices of pizza while studying for his Economics exam. The marginal utility of the first slice of pizza is 10 utils, the second slice is 7 utils, and the third slice is 3 utils. Which of the statements below holds true with the above data?

Options:

A: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is less than 20 utils.
B: The student would not eat any more pizza.
C: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils.
D: The marginal utility of each slice of pizza is equal.
E: The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.
F: The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0.
G: The student should have only eaten one slice of pizza.
H: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 30 utils.
I: The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be negative.
J: The student should have stopped eating pizza after the first slice.

Okay, so I've got this question about marginal utility and total utility. Hmm, I remember that utility is a concept in economics that measures the satisfaction a consumer gets from a good or service. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good. Oh right, and the law of diminishing marginal utility says that as you consume more of a good, the marginal utility decreases.

The question says a student ate 3 slices of pizza. The marginal utilities are 10 for the first slice, 7 for the second, and 3 for the third. I need to figure out which of the options A to J is correct based on this data.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Total utility is less than 20 utils. Wait, total utility is the sum of marginal utilities. So 10 +7 is 17, plus 3 makes 20. So total is exactly 20. So A says less than 20, which would be wrong because it's exactly 20.

Option B: Student wouldn't eat more pizza. Well, the data only shows up to the third slice. But we don't know about the fourth. We can't assume unless we have info about the next slice's marginal utility. So maybe not B.

Option C: Total utility is 20 utils. That aligns with my calculation. 10+7+3=20. So C is correct? But wait, let me check other options.

Option D: Marginal utility is equal for each slice. No, because the first is 10, second 7, third 3. They're decreasing, so D is wrong.

Option E: Student should have stopped after 2 slices. Why? Because the third slice gave 3 utils. If the question is about maximizing utility, maybe if the next slice's marginal utility is less than the cost or something, but the question doesn't mention cost. Oh wait, maybe it's about when marginal utility becomes zero or negative. But the third is still positive. So stopping after 2 would mean total utility of 17, but he actually ate 3, so I'm not sure E is correct.

Option F: Marginal utility of 4th is zero. If the pattern continues diminishing, maybe it could be zero, but it's not certain. Or maybe it's negative. We don't have data about the 4th slice, so can't confirm F.

Option G: Should have eaten only one. That would be if he stopped when marginal utility was highest, but that doesn't make sense because each additional slice adds to total utility. So G is not correct.

Option H: Total utility is 30. Wait, 10+7+3 is 20, so H is wrong.

Option I: Marginal utility of 4th is negative. Hmm, possible. The marginal utilities are 10,7,3. If it continues diminishing, the next could be, say, -2 or something. But without knowing, can we assume? The question doesn't provide data, so I can't be sure. It's possible, but the correct answer might be about what is definitely true from the data, not assumptions.

Option J: Should have stopped after first slice. No, because adding the second and third still gave positive utility, increasing total. So J is wrong.

So going back, the total utility is 20, which is option C. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, option E says he should have stopped after 2 slices. Why? Maybe if the third slice's marginal utility was lower than the cost. But since no cost is given, perhaps from a utility maximization standpoint, he should stop when marginal utility turns negative. But since the third is positive, he should have eaten it. So E is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the question is about when marginal utility becomes zero or negative. Since the third is 3, he's still getting utility. So he should continue until marginal utility is zero or negative. So he ate three, but perhaps if the next (fourth) would be negative, he should stop at three. So option I is about the fourth being negative. But we don't know that for sure.

So among the options, the only one that's definitely true is C: Total utility is 20 utils. Let me check the options again. Option C says 20. So that's correct.

But wait, I just thought, sometimes in economics, total utility is calculated as the sum of marginal utilities. So yes, 10+7+3 is 20. So C is correct. But let me make sure none of the other options are also correct.

Option E says he should have stopped after two. But since the third gave 3 utils, he gains more utility by eating it. So E is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option C. But wait, I just re-read the options. Option H says total is 30. That can't be, because 10+7+3=20. So H is wrong.

So the correct option is C.

The question involves analyzing the total utility and marginal utility of pizza slices consumed by a student. The marginal utilities for the first, second, and third slices are 10, 7, and 3 utils, respectively. Total utility is calculated as the sum of marginal utilities, which equals 20 utils (10 + 7 + 3). 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Total utility is exactly 20 utils, not less than 20.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The data does not provide information about whether the student would eat more pizza beyond the third slice.  
- **Option C**: Correct. Total utility is 20 utils, as calculated from the sum of marginal utilities.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Marginal utilities are not equal; they are 10, 7, and 3 utils for the three slices.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The student should not have stopped after two slices because the third slice still provided positive marginal utility (3 utils).  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The marginal utility of the fourth slice is not provided, so it cannot be assumed to be zero.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The student should not have stopped after one slice, as additional slices contributed positively to total utility.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Total utility is 20 utils, not 30.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The marginal utility of the fourth slice is not provided, so it cannot be assumed to be negative.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The student should not have stopped after the first slice, as subsequent slices added to total utility.  

The correct answer is **C**, as total utility is indeed 20 utils. 

Answer: C
