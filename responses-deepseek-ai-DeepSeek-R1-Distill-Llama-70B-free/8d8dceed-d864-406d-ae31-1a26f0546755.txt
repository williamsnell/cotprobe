Okay, so I've got this logic problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about determining the validity of an argument using indirect truth tables. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The argument given is:

H ≡ (~I ∨ J)
H ∨ ~J
---------
~I

So, the premises are H ≡ (~I ∨ J) and H ∨ ~J, and the conclusion is ~I. We need to check if this argument is valid. If it's not, we have to find a counterexample from the given options.

I remember that an argument is valid if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If I can find any situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid. That situation would be my counterexample.

Since the question suggests using an indirect truth table, I think that method involves assuming the opposite of the conclusion and seeing if it leads to a contradiction with the premises. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, an indirect truth table for an argument's validity would list all possible truth values for the propositional variables and check each row to see if there's a row where all premises are true but the conclusion is false.

But considering there are three variables here (H, I, J), the truth table would have 8 rows. That might take a while, but perhaps I can reason through it without writing all of them out.

Let me break down each premise and the conclusion.

1. The first premise is H ≡ (~I ∨ J). This is a biconditional, which means it's true when both sides have the same truth value. So, H is true if and only if (~I ∨ J) is true.

2. The second premise is H ∨ ~J. So, either H is true or J is false (or both).

3. The conclusion is ~I, which is the negation of I.

I need to see if whenever the two premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Alternatively, I can look for a scenario where premises are true but the conclusion is false. If such a scenario exists, the argument is invalid.

Let me think about the possible scenarios. Let's consider the case where the conclusion ~I is false. That would mean I is true. So, if I is true, can the premises both be true?

If I is true, then ~I is false. Looking at the first premise, H ≡ (false ∨ J). So that becomes H ≡ J. So H and J must have the same truth value.

Now, the second premise is H ∨ ~J. Let's substitute H with J (from the first premise when I is true): J ∨ ~J. Wait, J ∨ ~J is a tautology, it's always true. So whenever I is true, the second premise is always true because H would be equivalent to J, making H ∨ ~J equivalent to J ∨ ~J, which is true.

So, in this case, when I is true (making ~I false), the premises are both true. Wait, that's exactly the scenario I was looking for—premises true, conclusion (~I) false. So that would make the argument invalid because there's at least one case where premises are true but the conclusion is false.

So now, I need to find which option presents such a counterexample. The counterexample would be when I is true, and H and J are such that H ≡ J (because I is true, so H must equal J). Let's pick H and J both true, for example.

Wait, but let me think again. If I is true, then from the first premise, H ≡ J. Let's say H is true, then J must be true. The second premise is H ∨ ~J, which would be true ∨ false, so true. So all premises are true, but ~I is false because I is true. So this is a counterexample.

So the counterexample occurs when I is true, and H and J are both true. Let me check the options to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and H and I are false. Hmm, in this case, I is false, so ~I is true. So the conclusion would be true. But we need a case where the conclusion is false, so this isn't the counterexample.

B: Valid. No counterexample exists. But we just found one, so B is incorrect.

C: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and J are false. If I is false, then ~I is true, so conclusion is true. So this isn't a counterexample.

D: Invalid. Counterexample when H and J are true and I is false. Again, I is false, so conclusion is true. So this isn't a counterexample.

E: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true, I and J are false. Let's see: H true, I false, J false. First premise: H ≡ (~I ∨ J) → true ≡ (true ∨ false) → true ≡ true, so true. Second premise: H ∨ ~J → true ∨ true → true. So premises are true. Conclusion ~I is true (since I is false). So conclusion holds. Not a counterexample.

F: Valid. But we found a counterexample, so F is wrong.

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false. Let's check. If I is true, then H must equal J (from first premise). So if H is false and J is false, that's okay. Now, second premise: H ∨ ~J → false ∨ true (since J is false, ~J is true) → true. So premises are true. Conclusion is ~I, which is false because I is true. So this is a valid counterexample. So option G is a valid counterexample.

Wait, earlier I thought of H and J being true when I is true. So there are multiple possible counterexamples. Option G is one, and perhaps option H is another. Let's check option H.

H: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and H and J are true. Wait, if I is false, then conclusion ~I is true, so this isn't a counterexample. Because we're looking for cases where the conclusion is false, i.e., I is true.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine option G: I is true, H and J are false. So H is false, J is false. From the first premise, H should equal J, which they do (both false). So first premise holds. Second premise: H ∨ ~J → false ∨ true (since J is false, ~J is true) → true. So premises are true. Conclusion is ~I, which is false because I is true. So yes, this is a valid counterexample.

Alternatively, another counterexample could be when I is true, H is true, J is true. Let's check if that's an option. Looking back, option H says I is false, so that's not it. Option D says H and J are true, I is false. So in that case, conclusion ~I is true, so not a counterexample.

So the correct counterexample is when I is true, and H and J are false. So option G is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought when I is true and H and J are true, that's a counterexample. Let me check that scenario again.

If I is true, H is true, J is true.

First premise: H ≡ (~I ∨ J) → true ≡ (false ∨ true) → true ≡ true → true.

Second premise: H ∨ ~J → true ∨ false → true.

Conclusion: ~I → false.

So that's also a counterexample. So this scenario would also work, but does any option present this?

Looking at the options again:

Option G: I is true, H and J are false.

Option H: I is false, H and J are true.

Option A: J is true, H and I are false.

So, the scenario I just thought of (I true, H true, J true) isn't directly listed in any option except perhaps none of them. Because looking at the options, only option G matches a scenario where I is true and H and J are false.

Wait, but in the scenario I just considered, H and J are both true when I is true. So in that case, is that a valid counterexample? Yes, because in that case, all premises are true, but conclusion is false.

So, perhaps the answer should be option G, but wait, let me check all options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all possible combinations where I is true (since that's when the conclusion is false).

When I is true:

From first premise: H ≡ (~I ∨ J) → H ≡ (false ∨ J) → H ≡ J.

So H and J must be the same.

Possible cases:

1. H = true, J = true.

Check second premise: H ∨ ~J → true ∨ false → true. So premises are true.

Conclusion: ~I → false. So this is a counterexample.

2. H = false, J = false.

Second premise: H ∨ ~J → false ∨ true → true. So premises are true.

Conclusion: ~I → false. Another counterexample.

So both scenarios where I is true, and H and J are either both true or both false are counterexamples.

Now, looking at the options:

Option G says: I is true, H and J are false. That's one of the counterexamples.

Is there an option that corresponds to I being true, H and J being true? Looking at the options, I don't see any. The options are A through H, and none of them present I as true and H and J as true except perhaps none. So the correct counterexample must be when I is true, regardless of H and J, as long as they're equal.

So, the correct answer is option G. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the options are:

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false.

H: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and H and J are true.

So, the correct counterexamples are when I is true, and H and J are either both true or both false. Among the options, only G presents a scenario where I is true, so that's the correct choice.

Therefore, the answer should be option G.

To determine the validity of the argument, we analyze the premises and conclusion:

1. **Premises**:
   - \( H \equiv (\neg I \lor J) \): This biconditional means \( H \) is true if and only if \( \neg I \lor J \) is true.
   - \( H \lor \neg J \): This disjunction means either \( H \) is true or \( J \) is false (or both).

2. **Conclusion**:
   - \( \neg I \): The negation of \( I \).

An argument is valid if, in all scenarios where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. To invalidate the argument, we need a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

### Key Analysis:
- The conclusion \( \neg I \) is false when \( I \) is true. Thus, we focus on scenarios where \( I \) is true and check if the premises can still be true.
- From the first premise \( H \equiv (\neg I \lor J) \), if \( I \) is true, \( \neg I \) is false, so \( H \equiv J \). This means \( H \) and \( J \) must have the same truth value.
- The second premise \( H \lor \neg J \) must also be true. Substituting \( H \equiv J \), this becomes \( J \lor \neg J \), which is always true (tautology).

Thus, when \( I \) is true, \( H \) and \( J \) can be either both true or both false, and the premises will still hold. However, in these cases, the conclusion \( \neg I \) is false, making the argument invalid.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: Invalid. Counterexample when \( J \) is true and \( H \) and \( I \) are false.  
  - If \( I \) is false, \( \neg I \) is true, so this is not a counterexample.
  
- **B**: Valid. No counterexample exists.  
  - Incorrect, as we have identified counterexamples.

- **C**: Invalid. Counterexample when \( H \), \( I \), and \( J \) are false.  
  - If \( I \) is false, \( \neg I \) is true, so this is not a counterexample.

- **D**: Invalid. Counterexample when \( H \) and \( J \) are true and \( I \) is false.  
  - If \( I \) is false, \( \neg I \) is true, so this is not a counterexample.

- **E**: Invalid. Counterexample when \( H \) is true, \( I \) and \( J \) are false.  
  - If \( I \) is false, \( \neg I \) is true, so this is not a counterexample.

- **F**: Valid.  
  - Incorrect, as we have identified counterexamples.

- **G**: Invalid. Counterexample when \( I \) is true and \( H \) and \( J \) are false.  
  - If \( I \) is true, \( H \) and \( J \) are both false, the premises are true, but \( \neg I \) is false. This is a valid counterexample.

- **H**: Invalid. Counterexample when \( I \) is false and \( H \) and \( J \) are true.  
  - If \( I \) is false, \( \neg I \) is true, so this is not a counterexample.

### Conclusion:
The correct counterexample occurs when \( I \) is true, and \( H \) and \( J \) are false. This corresponds to **Option G**.
