Okay, so I've got this problem here about using the divergence theorem to evaluate a surface integral over a box. Hmm, I remember that the divergence theorem relates the flux through a closed surface to the divergence of the vector field in the enclosed volume. So the theorem says that the integral of F dot dS over the surface S is equal to the integral of the divergence of F over the volume enclosed by S. That should make things easier because calculating the surface integral directly for all six sides of the box seems complicated.

Alright, so the vector field is given as F = sin(πx)i + (zy³)j + (z² +4x)k. I need to find the divergence of F first. The divergence is the sum of the partial derivatives of each component with respect to the corresponding variable.

So let's compute the divergence:

div F = ∂(sin(πx))/∂x + ∂(zy³)/∂y + ∂(z² +4x)/∂z.

Calculating each term:

First term: derivative of sin(πx) with respect to x is π cos(πx).

Second term: derivative of z y³ with respect to y is 3 z y².

Third term: derivative of (z² +4x) with respect to z is 2z.

So putting it all together, div F = π cos(πx) + 3 z y² + 2 z.

Now, the next step is to integrate this divergence over the volume of the box. The box has ranges -1 ≤ x ≤ 2, 0 ≤ y ≤1, and 1 ≤ z ≤4.

So the triple integral becomes:

∫ (z from 1 to4) ∫ (y from 0 to1) ∫ (x from -1 to2) [π cos(πx) + 3 z y² + 2 z] dx dy dz.

I can split this integral into three separate parts because the integrand is a sum of three terms. That should simplify things.

Let me write them as:

Integral = ∫∫∫ π cos(πx) dx dy dz + ∫∫∫ 3 z y² dx dy dz + ∫∫∫ 2 z dx dy dz.

Let's tackle each integral one by one.

First integral: I1 = π ∫ (z=1 to4) ∫ (y=0 to1) ∫ (x=-1 to2) cos(πx) dx dy dz.

The innermost integral with respect to x is straightforward. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx). Evaluated from x = -1 to 2.

So, integral from x=-1 to 2 of cos(πx) dx = [ (1/π) sin(π*2) ) - (1/π) sin(π*(-1)) ) ]

But sin(2π) is 0, and sin(-π) is also 0. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2π is 360 degrees, sin is zero. Similarly, sin(-π) is zero. So this entire integral becomes zero. So I1 = 0. That's convenient, no need to compute further for this part.

Second integral: I2 = 3 ∫ (z=1 to4) ∫ (y=0 to1) ∫ (x=-1 to2) z y² dx dy dz.

Let me see. The integrand is 3 z y². Now, variables are x, y, z. The integration is with respect to x first. Since the integrand doesn't depend on x, integrating with respect to x just multiplies by the length in x.

So ∫ (x=-1 to2) dx = (2 - (-1)) = 3. So I2 becomes 3 * 3 ∫ (z=1 to4) ∫ (y=0 to1) z y² * 3 dy dz ?

Wait, wait. Let me write it step by step.

I2 = 3 ∫_{z=1 to4} [ ∫_{y=0 to1} [ ∫_{x=-1 to2} z y² dx ] dy ] dz.

The innermost integral ∫_{x=-1}^2 z y² dx = z y² * (2 - (-1)) ) = z y² * 3.

So now, I2 becomes 3 ∫_{z=1 to4} [ ∫_{y=0 to1} (3 z y² ) dy ] dz.

The 3 comes from the front, and the 3 from the x integral. So 3 * 3 z y² = 9 z y².

Wait, no. Wait the 3 is outside, so it's 3 * [ integral over x which gives 3 z y² ].

Wait, no. Let me correct.

Wait, I2 is 3 times the triple integral. Let me recompute.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write each step.

I2 = 3 ∫_{z=1 to4} [ ∫_{y=0 to1} [ ∫_{x=-1 to2} z y² dx ] dy ] dz.

Compute innermost integral: ∫ x from -1 to 2 of z y² dx.

Since z y² is independent of x, the integral over x is (2 - (-1)) * z y² = 3 z y².

So the integral becomes 3 z y².

Now, I2 becomes 3 ∫_{z=1 to4} [ ∫_{y=0 to1} 3 z y² dy ] dz.

Compute the inner integral ∫ y=0 to1 of 3 z y² dy.

3 z is constant with respect to y. So integral is 3 z * [ y^3 /3 ] from 0 to1 = 3 z * (1/3 - 0) )= z.

So now I2 becomes 3 ∫_{z=1 to4} (z) dz.

Compute ∫ z dz from 1 to4 = [ (z²)/2 ] from 1 to4 = (16/2) - (1/2) = 8 - 0.5 = 7.5.

So I2 = 3 * 7.5 = 22.5.

Wait, wait, let me check again. Because each step seems a bit confusing.

Wait, the original I2 is 3 * ∫ [ ∫ [ ∫ ... ] ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to factor the integrals.

Since the integrand in I2 is 3 z y², and the variables are x, y, z.

We can write I2 as 3 * (∫x) (∫y) (∫z) z y² dx dy dz.

Wait, no, because the order is dx dy dz. So I need to integrate each variable step by step.

Alternatively, the triple integral can be written as the product of the integrals if variables are separable. But in this case, the integrand is 3 z y², which doesn't involve x. So the x integral is just the length, which is 3.

So I2 = 3 * [ ∫_{z=1 to4} ∫_{y=0 to1} ∫_{x=-1 to2} z y² dx dy dz ].

So, ∫x= -1 to 2 dx =3. So I2 = 3 * [3 ∫_{z=1 to4} ∫_{y=0 to1} z y² dy dz ].

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the constants. Let's do it correctly.

I2 = 3 times the triple integral.

The triple integral is ∫ (all) z y² dx dy dz.

Which is (∫x) * (∫y) * (∫z) z y²? No, because it's over the box, so each variable is integrated over its range, but the integrand is z y², independent of x.

So the triple integral is (∫x from -1 to2 dx) * (∫y from0 to1 y² dy ) * (∫z from1 to4 z dz).

Wait, no, that's not correct because the integrand is z y², and each integral is over different variables. So the triple integral can be written as the product of the individual integrals if the integrand is a product of functions each of a single variable.

Wait, perhaps yes. Because z is z, y² is y, and the x part is 1 (since integrand doesn't depend on x, so the x integral is just multiplying by the length in x).

So I can write the triple integral as:

(∫x from -1 to2 dx) * (∫y from0 to1 y² dy) * (∫z from1 to4 z dz).

Yes, because the integrand z y² = (z) * (y²) * (1), and the variables are independent. So the triple integral becomes product of each integral.

So:

∫x dx from -1 to2 is 3.

∫y² dy from 0 to1 is [ y³/3 ] from 0 to1, which is 1/3.

∫z dz from1 to4 is [ z²/2 ] from1 to4 = (16/2) - (1/2) = 8 - 0.5 =7.5.

So the triple integral is 3 * (1/3) *7.5 = 3 * (1/3) =1; 1 *7.5=7.5.

But wait, I2 is 3 times this triple integral, so I2=3 *7.5=22.5.

Okay, that's correct.

Third integral: I3 = ∫∫∫ 2 z dx dy dz.

Again, the integrand is 2z, which doesn't depend on x or y. So the integral over x and y would just give the area in x and y, multiplied by the integral over z.

So, I3 = 2 ∫ (z=1 to4) z [ ∫ (y=0 to1) dy ] [ ∫ (x=-1 to2) dx ] dz.

Compute each part:

∫x from -1 to2 dx =3.

∫y from0 to1 dy=1.

So the integrand becomes 2 * z * (3) * (1) )= 6 z.

Now, integrating 6 z from z=1 to4: ∫6 z dz =6 [ z²/2 ] from1 to4= 6*( (16/2)-(1/2) )=6*(8 -0.5)=6*(7.5)=45.

So I3=45.

So the total integral is I1 + I2 + I3= 0 +22.5 +45=67.5.

Looking at the options, option I is 67.5.

To evaluate the surface integral $\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{S}$ using the divergence theorem, we first compute the divergence of the vector field $\vec{F} = \sin(\pi x) \vec{i} + (z y^3) \vec{j} + (z^2 + 4x) \vec{k}$. The divergence is given by:

\[
\text{div} \, \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \sin(\pi x) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (z y^3) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z} (z^2 + 4x).
\]

Calculating each term:

1. $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \sin(\pi x) = \pi \cos(\pi x)$,
2. $\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (z y^3) = 3 z y^2$,
3. $\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (z^2 + 4x) = 2 z$.

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\text{div} \, \vec{F} = \pi \cos(\pi x) + 3 z y^2 + 2 z.
\]

Next, we use the divergence theorem to convert the surface integral into a volume integral over the box $-1 \leq x \leq 2$, $0 \leq y \leq 1$, and $1 \leq z \leq 4$:

\[
\iiint_V \text{div} \, \vec{F} \, dV = \int_{z=1}^4 \int_{y=0}^1 \int_{x=-1}^2 \left( \pi \cos(\pi x) + 3 z y^2 + 2 z \right) dx \, dy \, dz.
\]

We split this into three separate integrals:

\[
I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3,
\]

where:

1. $I_1 = \pi \int_{z=1}^4 \int_{y=0}^1 \int_{x=-1}^2 \cos(\pi x) dx \, dy \, dz$,
2. $I_2 = 3 \int_{z=1}^4 \int_{y=0}^1 \int_{x=-1}^2 z y^2 dx \, dy \, dz$,
3. $I_3 = 2 \int_{z=1}^4 \int_{y=0}^1 \int_{x=-1}^2 z dx \, dy \, dz$.

### Evaluation of $I_1$
The integral of $\cos(\pi x)$ over $x$ is:

\[
\int_{x=-1}^2 \cos(\pi x) dx = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \Big|_{x=-1}^2 = \frac{\sin(2\pi) - \sin(-\pi)}{\pi} = 0.
\]

Thus, $I_1 = 0$.

### Evaluation of $I_2$
The integrand $3 z y^2$ does not depend on $x$, so the integral over $x$ gives the length of the interval $x \in [-1, 2]$, which is $3$. Therefore:

\[
I_2 = 3 \cdot 3 \int_{z=1}^4 \int_{y=0}^1 z y^2 dy \, dz.
\]

First, integrate over $y$:

\[
\int_{y=0}^1 y^2 dy = \frac{y^3}{3} \Big|_{y=0}^1 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus:

\[
I_2 = 3 \cdot 3 \int_{z=1}^4 z \, dz = 9 \int_{z=1}^4 z \, dz = 9 \cdot \frac{z^2}{2} \Big|_{z=1}^4 = 9 \cdot \left( \frac{16}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) = 9 \cdot 7.5 = 67.5.
\]

Wait, correcting the earlier step: The correct computation gives $I_2 = 22.5$.

### Evaluation of $I_3$
The integrand $2 z$ does not depend on $x$ or $y$, so the integral over $x$ and $y$ gives the area of the box in the $x$-$y$ plane, which is $3 \cdot 1 = 3$. Therefore:

\[
I_3 = 2 \cdot 3 \int_{z=1}^4 z \, dz = 6 \int_{z=1}^4 z \, dz = 6 \cdot \frac{z^2}{2} \Big|_{z=1}^4 = 6 \cdot \left( \frac{16}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) = 6 \cdot 7.5 = 45.
\]

### Total Integral
Adding the results:

\[
I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 0 + 22.5 + 45 = 67.5.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

**I: 67.5**
