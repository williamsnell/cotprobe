Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine the total collisional frequency for CO₂ at 1 atm and 298 K. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my gas kinetics, but let me try to work through this.

From what I remember, collisional frequency has something to do with how often gas molecules collide with each other. Oh right, the formula for collisional frequency (Z) is Z = n * σ * sqrt(4πkT/(m)), where n is the number density, σ is the collision diameter, and m is the molar mass. Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing a few terms here. Maybe it's better to recall the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the collisional frequency per unit volume per unit time. Oh, right, the formula is Z = sqrt(2) * π * d² * n * sqrt( (3kT)/(m) ) ). Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean speed. Alternatively, the collision frequency can be expressed as Z = n * π * d² * v_avg, where v_avg is the average speed and d is the collision diameter.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The collisional frequency (often denoted as Z) can be calculated using kinetic theory. The formula I think is Z = (n * σ * v_rel), where σ is the collision cross-section, and v_rel is the relative velocity.

Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: Z = sqrt(2) * π * d² * n * ( (8kT)/(πm) )^(1/2) ). This seems familiar. Let me break it down.

Wait, the collisional frequency per unit volume is given by Z = n² π d² sqrt( (8kT)/(π m) ) ), but wait, maybe that's per pair of molecules. Or perhaps it's Z = n π d² sqrt( (8kT)/(π m) ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct formula in my notes. Oh wait, I can't do that right now. I need to proceed from memory.

Another approach: the mean free path is related to collision frequency. But perhaps I should use the formula for collision rate.

Wait, for a single molecule, the collision rate (how many collisions per second) is given by Z₁ = n * π d² * v_avg * sqrt(2), where v_avg is the average speed of the molecules.

Wait, but wait, the average relative speed between two molecules is sqrt(2) times the average speed of a single molecule. So the collision rate for a single molecule would be Z₁ = n π d² v_rel, where v_rel is the relative speed, which is sqrt(2) times the average speed.

Wait, the average speed v_avg is sqrt(8kT/(π m)). So the relative speed would be sqrt(2) times that. So Z₁ = n π d² * sqrt(2) * v_avg.

But wait, that would be Z₁ = n π d² * sqrt(2) * sqrt(8kT/(π m)).

Alternatively, let's compute it step by step. Let me define the variables:

- Pressure P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa
- Temperature T = 298 K
- Molar mass of CO₂: M = 44 g/mol = 0.044 kg/mol
- Gas constant R = 8.314 J/mol·K
- Avogadro's number N_A = 6.022e23 mol⁻¹
- Boltzmann constant k = R / N_A = 1.380649e-23 J/K
- Collision diameter d: I think for CO₂, it's around 3.3e-10 m or so. Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but maybe I can look for typical values. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the root mean square speed or another approach.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the ideal gas law to find the number density n first.

n = P/(k T). Wait, no, n is number per volume, so in terms of ideal gas law, PV = n_total R T, so n = n_total / V = P/(R T). Wait, but wait, no, n is n = (P N_A)/(R T), because n is in molecules per m³.

Wait, let me compute that. P is 1 atm = 101325 Pa. R is 8.314 J/mol·K. T is 298 K.

So n = (101325 Pa) * (6.022e23 mol⁻¹) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K).

Calculating the denominator first: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.772 J/mol.

n = (101325 * 6.022e23) / 2477.772 ≈ (6.10265e28) / 2477.772 ≈ 2.463e25 molecules/m³.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

101325 * 6.022e23 = 101325 * 6.022e23 = Let's compute 1e5 * 6e23 = 6e28, but more accurately:

101325 = approx 1.01325e5.

So 1.01325e5 * 6.022e23 = (1.01325 * 6.022) * 1e5 * 1e23 = approx 6.10265e28. Then divide by 2477.772.

So 6.10265e28 / 2.477772e3 ≈ 2.463e25 m⁻³.

So n ≈ 2.463e25 m⁻³.

Now, the collisional frequency per unit volume is Z = n * sqrt(2) * π * d² * v_avg.

Wait, but I need to know d, the collision diameter for CO₂.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the value, but I think CO₂ has a collision diameter around 3.3 angstroms, which is 3.3e-10 m. Let me confirm. Maybe I'm mixing it up with another molecule, like O2 or N2. Alternatively, perhaps it's about 3.64e-10 m. Wait, maybe I can use a table of collision diameters. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with an approximate value, say d = 3.64e-10 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Lennard-Jones parameters, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed with d = 3.3e-10 m as an estimate.

Next, calculate the average speed v_avg. The formula is sqrt(8 k T / (π m)), where m is the mass of a single molecule.

The molar mass M of CO₂ is 44 g/mol, which is 0.044 kg/mol. So the mass of a single molecule is m = M / N_A = 0.044 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ ≈ 7.3e-26 kg.

So m = 0.044/(6.022e23) = let's compute: 0.044 / 6.022e23 ≈ 7.3e-26 kg.

Now, compute v_avg = sqrt(8 k T / (π m)).

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.

T is 298 K.

So let's compute 8 * k * T = 8 * 1.380649e-23 * 298.

8 * 298 = 2384, so 2384 * 1.380649e-23 ≈ (approx 2384 * 1.38e-23) = Let's compute 2384 * 1.38 = approx 2384 * 1 = 2384, 2384 * 0.38 = 905.92; total ≈ 3289.92 → 3.28992e3 → 3.28992e3 * 1e-23 = 3.28992e-20.

Now, divide by π * m: π * 7.3e-26 ≈ 2.3e-25.

So 8kT/(π m) = 3.28992e-20 / 2.3e-25 ≈ (3.28992 / 2.3) * 1e5 ≈ 1.4288 * 1e5 ≈ 1.4288e5.

So v_avg = sqrt(1.4288e5) = approx 378 m/s.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

sqrt(142880) = sqrt(1.4288e5) → let's compute the square root of 142880.

Well, 378^2 = (380 - 2)^2 = 380^2 - 2*380*2 + 2^2 = 144400 - 1520 +4 = 142884. Oh, that's very close to 1.4288e5, which is 142880. So v_avg is approximately 378 m/s.

So now, putting it all together.

Collisional frequency Z = n * π * d² * v_rel. Wait, wait, no, I think the formula for the collision frequency is Z = n * π d² * v_rel, but the relative speed v_rel is sqrt(2) times the average speed because when two molecules are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the vector sum. So v_rel = sqrt(2) * v_avg.

Wait, no, the average relative speed between two molecules is sqrt(2) times the average speed of a single molecule. So that's correct.

So Z = n * π d² * v_rel = n * π d² * sqrt(2) * v_avg.

Wait, no, wait, the formula I think is Z = n π d² v_avg * sqrt(2), but let me make sure.

Alternatively, the exact formula for the collision rate is Z = sqrt(2) π d² n v_avg, where v_avg is the average speed.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the collisional frequency Z per unit volume is given by Z = n² π d² sqrt(8 k T/(π m)) * sqrt(2)}. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for collision frequency, which is:

Z = (n * π * d²) * (sqrt(8 k T / (π m))) ) * sqrt(2)

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is Z = n * π d² * sqrt( (8 k T) / (π m) ) ) * sqrt(2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula Z = sqrt(2) * π d² n^2 sqrt( (k T) / (m) ) * (8 / π)^(1/2) }, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, I've found in some sources that the collision frequency Z (per unit volume) is given by:

Z = (8 n² π d^5 sqrt( (k T) / (π m) )) )^(1/2) * ... No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the mean free path λ is (1)/(sqrt(2) π d² n). Then, the mean speed is v_avg, so the collision frequency would be v_avg / λ = v_avg * sqrt(2) π d² n.

So Z = v_avg * sqrt(2) π d² n.

Yes, that seems correct. Because λ = 1/(sqrt(2) π d² n), so Z = v_avg / λ = v_avg * sqrt(2) π d² n.

So, using that, Z = v_avg * sqrt(2) * π * d² * n.

So now, let's plug in the numbers.

v_avg ≈ 378 m/s.

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142.

π ≈ 3.1416.

d = 3.3e-10 m.

n = 2.463e25 m⁻³.

So compute each part step by step.

Compute d²: (3.3e-10)^2 = 10.89e-20 m².

Multiply by π: 10.89e-20 * 3.1416 ≈ 34.2e-20 m².

Multiply by sqrt(2): 34.2e-20 * 1.4142 ≈ 48.4e-20 m².

Now multiply by v_avg: 378 m/s * 48.4e-20 m² ≈ 378 * 48.4e-20 = Let's compute 378 *48.4 = ?

378 * 40 = 15120, 378 *8.4 = 3175.2 → total ≈ 15120 + 3175.2 = 18295.2. So 18,295.2e-20 m³/s.

Now multiply by n: 18,295.2e-20 m³/s * 2.463e25 m⁻³.

Multiply 18,295.2 by 2.463 → approx 18,295 * 2.463 ≈ let me compute:

18,000 * 2.463 = 44,334.

295 * 2.463 ≈ 726. So total ≈ 45,060.

So 45,060e-20 * 1e25 = 45,060e5 → 4.506e9 * 1e5 → Wait, wait, that can't be. Wait, let's compute exponents correctly.

Wait, 18,295.2e-20 * 2.463e25 = (18,295.2 * 2.463) * (1e-20 * 1e25) = approx 45,060 * 1e5 = 4.506e9.

Wait, but wait, 1e-20 * 1e25 = 1e5. So yes, 45,060e5 = 4.506e9 s⁻¹ m⁻³.

Wait, but that seems low. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 18,295.2e-20 m³/s multiplied by 2.463e25 m⁻³ → the exponents are 1e-20 * 1e25 = 1e5.

So 18,295.2 * 2.463 = let's compute accurately.

18,295.2 * 2 = 36,590.4

18,295.2 * 0.463 = let's compute 18,295.2 * 0.4 = 7,318.08

18,295.2 * 0.063 ≈ 1,154.6

So 7,318.08 + 1,154.6 = 8,472.68

So total 36,590.4 + 8,472.68 ≈ 45,063.08.

Multiply by 1e5 → 45,063.08e5 → 4.5063e9 s⁻¹ m⁻³.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are all on the order of 1e34, so I must have missed some factors.

Wait, wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think: the formula Z = n * π d² v_avg * sqrt(2) gives units of per volume per time, so m⁻³ s⁻¹.

But wait, in my calculation, I have Z ≈4.5e9 m⁻³ s⁻¹, which is way lower than the options given. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me try another approach.

Wait, another formula I've seen is Z = (P/(k_B T)) * sqrt( (8 k_B T)/(π m) ) * π d^2 * sqrt(2).

Wait, but maybe I should use the more precise formula:

The collision frequency per unit volume is given by:

Z = n^2 π d^2 sqrt(8 k T/(π m)) * sqrt(2)

Wait, but that's per unit volume. Let me try that.

n is 2.463e25 m⁻³.

So n squared is (2.463e25)^2 = approx 6.07e50 m⁻⁶.

Multiply by π d²: π*(3.3e-10)^2 = π * 1.089e-19 = 3.42e-19 m².

Multiply by sqrt(8kT/(π m)):

8kT = 8 * 1.38e-23 * 298 ≈ 3.28e-20 J.

Divide by π m: m is 7.3e-26 kg, so π m ≈ 2.29e-25 kg.

So 8kT/(π m) = 3.28e-20 / 2.29e-25 ≈ 1.43e5.

sqrt(1.43e5) ≈ 378 m/s, as before.

Multiply by sqrt(2): 378 * 1.414 ≈ 534.9 m/s.

Putting it all together:

Z = (6.07e50 m⁻⁶) * (3.42e-19 m²) * 534.9 m/s.

Wait, let's compute each step.

First, 6.07e50 * 3.42e-19 = 6.07 * 3.42 = approx 20.75; and 1e50 * 1e-19 = 1e31. So 20.75e31 = 2.075e32.

Then multiply by 534.9 m/s: 2.075e32 * 534.9 ≈ approx 1.11e35 m⁻³ s⁻¹.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e34. Hmm, perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Another source says that the collision rate Z is given by:

Z = (n * π d^2) * ( sqrt(8kT/(π m)) ) * sqrt(2)

So Z = n * π d^2 * sqrt(8kT/(π m)) * sqrt(2).

Let me compute that.

n = 2.463e25 m⁻³.

π d² = 3.1416 * (3.3e-10)^2 = 3.1416 * 1.089e-19 ≈ 3.42e-19 m².

sqrt(8kT/(π m)) = v_avg = 378 m/s.

Multiply all together:

2.463e25 * 3.42e-19 * 378 * sqrt(2).
