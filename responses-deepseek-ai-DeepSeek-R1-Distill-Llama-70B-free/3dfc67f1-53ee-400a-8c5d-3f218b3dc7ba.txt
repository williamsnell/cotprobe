Okay, so I have this problem about water flowing through a pipe, and I need to find the diameter. Let's see what the question says.

The water is at 70°F, flowing through an RCC pipe. The volumetric flow rate is 15 ft³/s. The pressure loss must not exceed 4.8 ft in a length of 1000 ft. I need to find the diameter from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that pressure loss in pipes is usually calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation or maybe the Hazen-Williams equation. Since the pipe is RCC, which is concrete, I think the Hazen-Williams might be more appropriate because it's commonly used for water distribution systems and gives the head loss.

Wait, but wait. The Darcy-Weisbach equation is more general. The formula is h_f = f*(L/D)*(v²/2g), where f is the friction factor. But sometimes, for certain materials and flow regimes, Hazen-Williams is used which relates head loss to velocity.

The Hazen-Williams equation is h_f = (10.67 * L * v^0.85)/(C*(D)^1.17), but I'm not 100% sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember it as h_f = (4.73 * L * (Q/C)^1.85 ) / D^4.73, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait another approach: maybe the problem expects me to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Let me think. I need to find D, the diameter. I know the flow rate Q, which is 15 ft³/s. So velocity v = Q/A. A is the area, which is πD²/4. So v = (4Q)/(π D²).

The head loss h_f is given as 4.8 ft over 1000 ft of pipe. So h_f = 4.8 ft.

Using Darcy-Weisbach: h_f = f*(L/D)*(v²/(2g)). So I can rearrange to solve for f, but I don't know f yet. Oh right, f is the friction factor, which depends on the Reynolds number and the pipe roughness.

Wait, I need the value of f. For that, I need to know if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Since it's water and likely a high flow rate, it's probably turbulent. So I'll have to use the Colebrook-White equation or the Moody diagram to find f. But without knowing the roughness, I can't directly compute f.

Wait, but I think for RCC (reinforced concrete) pipes, the roughness coefficient is known. I recall that for concrete pipes, the roughness height ε is about 0.0003 feet or maybe 0.001 feet. Alternatively, the Hazen-Williams C value for concrete is around 130 or so. Oh, maybe using the Hazen-Williams equation would be easier here because it directly uses the C factor which accounts for roughness and other factors.

The Hazen-Williams formula is h_f = (10.67 L (v)^0.85 ) / ( C ( D )^1.17 ). Or wait, another version is h_f = (4.73 L (Q/C)^1.85 ) / D^4.73. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to get it right.

Hazen-Williams head loss formula is typically written as:

h_f = (4.73 * L * (Q)^1.85) / (C * D^4.73)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another form is:

h_f = (10.67 * L * (v)^0.85 ) / ( C * D^0.17 )

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't right now. Alternatively, perhaps using the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the appropriate f.

Let me outline the steps I'd take:

1. Calculate velocity v = Q/A. Q is given as 15 ft³/s. A = π D²/4. So v = (4*15)/(π D²) = 60/(π D²).

2. Compute Reynolds number Re = (v D)/ν. For water at 70°F, ν (kinematic viscosity) is about 1.06e-5 ft²/s. So Re = (v D)/(1.06e-5).

3. Determine the friction factor f. For turbulent flow, which it probably is, f can be found using the Colebrook-White equation, which is 1/√f = log(ε/(3.7 D) + 5.74/Re²). But without knowing ε, perhaps I can use the Hazen-Williams approach, which already factors in the roughness via the C value.

So for RCC pipes, the Hazen-Williams C is around 130. Let me confirm that. I think concrete pipes have a C of about 120-140. Let's assume C=130.

The Hazen-Williams equation is:

h_f = (4.73 * L * (Q/C)^1.85 ) / D^4.73

Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

h_f = (10.67 * L * v^0.85 ) / (C * D^0.17 )

Wait, but the exponents don't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

h_f = (P L) / (1000 C) where P is some function of velocity and diameter? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

h_f = (10.67 * L * v^1.85 ) / (C * D^0.15 )

No, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Another approach is to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation, but I need to find f.

Let me try the Darcy-Weisbach approach.

Given:
h_f = 4.8 ft (head loss)
L = 1000 ft
Q = 15 ft³/s
Water at 70°F: kinematic viscosity ν ≈ 1.06e-5 ft²/s
Density of water, ρ = 62.4 lb/ft³, but maybe I don't need that here.

v = Q/(A) = Q/(π D²/4) = (4 Q) / (π D²) = (4*15)/(π D²) = 60/(π D²) ft/s.

The Reynolds number Re = v D / ν = (60/(π D²)) * D / (1.06e-5) ) = (60/(π D)) / (1.06e-5) ) = (60) / ( π D * 1.06e-5 )

Simplify: 60 / (3.332e-6 * D) ) = approx 1.8e7 / D.

Wait, let's calculate it more accurately:

Re = (v D) / ν = [ (60/(π D²)) * D ] / (1.06e-5) ) = (60/(π D)) / (1.06e-5) = (60) / (π * D * 1.06e-5 )

Compute denominator: π * 1.06e-5 ≈ 3.34e-5.

So Re ≈ 60/(3.34e-5 * D) ) = 60/(3.34e-5 D) ) = (60 / 3.34e-5 ) / D ≈ 1.8e6 / D.

Wait, 60 / 3.34e-5 is 60 / 0.0000334 ≈ 1,797,600, so Re ≈ 1.7976e6 / D.

Hmm, that's a high Reynolds number, so flow is turbulent.

Now, to find the friction factor f. For turbulent flow in pipes, f depends on the relative roughness ε/D, where ε is the roughness height.

For RCC pipes, ε is about 0.0003 ft. So ε/D is 0.0003/D.

The Colebrook-White equation is 1/√f = log(ε/(3.7 D) + (5.74)/(Re √f)).

But since Re is large, the term 5.74/(Re √f) becomes negligible, so 1/√f ≈ log( ε/(3.7 D) )

Wait, that would only be the case if the flow is fully rough, where viscous effects are negligible. But for transitional roughness, we have to use the full Colebrook equation.

Alternatively, we can use the approximation for f in different regimes:

- Laminar: f = 64/Re (but Re is high, so not applicable)
- Turbulent smooth: f ≈ 0.316 Re^(-1/4) (Blasius)
- Turbulent rough: f ≈ (1/ ( (ε/(3.7 D) + 0.077 ) )^0.5 ) )

Wait, another approach is to use the Moody diagram. For a given ε/D and Re, find f.

But perhaps it's easier to use an iterative approach. Let me outline the steps:

We can write the Darcy equation as:

h_f = f (L/D) (v²)/(2g)

We have h_f =4.8 ft, L=1000 ft, v=60/(π D²), g=32.2 ft/s².

So plugging in:

4.8 = f * (1000/D) * [ (60/(π D²))^2 ] / (2 * 32.2 )

Let me compute the right-hand side step by step.

First, calculate v²: (60/(π D²))² = 3600/(π² D^4 )

Then, v²/(2g) = 3600/(π² D^4 * 2*32.2 ) = 3600/( 2*32.2 π² D^4 ) ≈ 3600/(201.76 * π² D^4 )

Wait, let me compute 2*32.2 = 64.4.

So v²/(2g) = 3600/(64.4 * π² D^4 )

So putting it all together:

4.8 = f * (1000/D) * [ 3600/(64.4 π² D^4) ) ]

Simplify:

4.8 = f * (1000/D) * (3600) / (64.4 π² D^4 )

Multiply the terms:

= f * (1000 * 3600) / (64.4 π² D^5 )

Compute 1000*3600 = 3.6e6.

So,

4.8 = f * 3.6e6 / (64.4 π² D^5 )

Compute denominator 64.4 * π² ≈ 64.4 * 9.8696 ≈ 636.

So,

4.8 ≈ f * (3.6e6) / (636 D^5 )

Simplify 3.6e6 /636 ≈ 5655.2.

So,

4.8 ≈ f * 5655.2 / D^5

Rearranged:

f ≈ (4.8 D^5) / 5655.2 ≈ (4.8/5655.2) D^5 ≈ 8.48e-4 D^5.

So f = 0.000848 D^5.

But I also know that f is a function of Re and ε/D. From earlier, Re ≈ 1.8e6 / D.

And ε/D = 0.0003 / D.

So, let's consider the Moody diagram. For a given Re and ε/D, f can be found.

Alternatively, use the approximation for f in terms of ε and Re.

The Colebrook equation is:

1/√f = log( ε/(3.7 D) ) + 1.74/√f

Wait, no, the correct Colebrook-White equation is:

1/√f = log( (ε/D)/(3.7) + (5.74)/(Re √f) )

But solving this requires iteration. Alternatively, I can make an initial guess for f and iterate.

But perhaps since I have f expressed in terms of D, I can substitute.

Wait, from earlier, f ≈ 0.000848 D^5.

But that comes from the Darcy equation, which depends on f, which I'm trying to express in terms of D. It's a bit circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an initial estimate for f and solve for D.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the Hazen-Williams equation instead. Let me try that.

The Hazen-Williams equation is:

h_f = (4.73 * L * (Q/C)^1.85 ) / D^4.73

Wait, let me confirm the formula. I think the correct form is:

h_f = (4.73 L (Q/C)^1.85 ) / D^4.73

Where C is the Hazen-Williams coefficient. For concrete pipes, C is about 130.

So:

h_f = 4.8 ft,

L = 1000 ft,

Q = 15 ft³/s,

C=130.

Plugging into the equation:

4.8 = (4.73 * 1000 * (15/130)^1.85 ) / D^4.73

Let me compute the numerator first.

Compute (15/130) = 0.11538.

Now, (0.11538)^1.85. Hmm, that's a bit tricky without a calculator. Let me approximate.

Natural logarithm of 0.11538 is about ln(0.115) ≈ -2.156.

Multiply by 1.85: -2.156 *1.85≈-4.0.

Exponential of that is e^(-4)≈0.0183.

So (0.11538)^1.85 ≈ 0.0183.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using logarithms:

log10(0.11538) ≈ -0.939.

Multiply by 1.85: -1.738.

So 10^(-1.738) ≈ 1.83e-2 → 0.0183.

So, (15/130)^1.85 ≈ 0.0183.

Now, compute 4.73 * 1000 * 0.0183.

4.73 * 1000 = 4730.

4730 * 0.0183 ≈ 4730 * 0.018 = let's compute 4730 * 0.01=47.3, 4730 *0.008=37.84 → total 85.14, plus 4730 *0.0003=1.419 → total ≈86.559.

So numerator ≈86.56.

So equation becomes:

4.8 = 86.56 / D^4.73

Multiply both sides by D^4.73:

4.8 D^4.73 =86.56

Divide both sides by 4.8:

D^4.73 = 86.56 /4.8 ≈18.05

Now, solve for D.

Take both sides to the power of 1/4.73:

D = (18.05)^(1/4.73)

Compute 1/4.73 ≈0.2115.

So D ≈ 18.05^0.2115.

What's 18.05^0.2 approximately? Let's see:

Since 10^0.2 ≈ 1.5849.

18 is about 10 *1.8, so 18^0.2 = (10^0.2)*(1.8^0.2) ≈1.5849 * 1.23 ≈1.948.

Wait, but 18.05^0.2115 is a bit higher.

Alternatively, using natural logs:

ln(18.05)=2.89.

Multiply by 0.2115: 2.89 *0.2115≈0.611.

e^0.611 ≈1.841.

So D≈1.841 ft.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.8 ft, option E is 1.75, option J is 1.90, option D is 2.04, and option C is 2.20.

Wait, my approximate calculation gives around 1.84 ft, which is close to option I (1.8) or J (1.9).

But perhaps my approximation was rough. Let me do a better approximation.

Wait, maybe I should compute (15/130)^1.85 more accurately.

15/130 = 0.115384615.

Taking natural log: ln(0.11538)=−2.15668.

Multiply by 1.85: −2.15668 *1.85 ≈−4.0.

Wait, more accurately: 2.15668 * 1.85.

Let me compute 2*1.85=3.7, 0.15668*1.85≈0.290. So total ≈3.99, so about -3.99.

e^{-3.99} ≈0.0183.

So the previous calculation holds. So numerator ≈86.56.

Then, D^4.73=18.05.

Take natural logs: ln(D) = (ln(18.05))/4.73.

ln(18.05)=2.894.

So ln(D)=2.894 /4.73 ≈0.6119.

e^0.6119 ≈1.843.

So D≈1.843 ft.

Looking at the options, option J is 1.90 ft, which is close. Option I is 1.8 ft.

But wait, maybe my approximation of C=130 is incorrect. Let me check: for concrete pipes, the C value is around 120-140. Let's try C=120 and see.

Using C=120:

(15/120)=0.125.

(0.125)^1.85: ln(0.125)=−2.079, *1.85=−3.846, e^-3.846≈0.0216.

So numerator would be 4.73 *1000 *0.0216=4.73 *21.6≈102.2.

So 4.8 =102.2 / D^4.73 → D^4.73=102.2/4.8≈21.29.

D = 21.29^(1/4.73) → compute 1/4.73≈0.2115.

21.29^0.2115.

ln(21.29)=3.05, multiply by 0.2115→0.645.

e^0.645≈1.906
