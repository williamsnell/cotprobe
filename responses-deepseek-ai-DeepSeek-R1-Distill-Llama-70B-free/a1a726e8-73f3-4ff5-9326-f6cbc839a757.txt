Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Little arguing regarding the norms of creation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that Little's arguments probably relate to the philosophy of abortion. The question is about the norms of creation, so maybe it's about the ethics of creating life or the respect due to potential life.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's respectful to terminate a pregnancy if certain background conditions, like a loving family, aren't met. That sounds a bit like situational ethics, where the circumstances determine the morality. So if the environment isn't right, ending the pregnancy is respectful. I'm not sure if that's what Little argues.

Option B states it's never respectful to terminate because we should hold creation sacred. That's a more absolutist view, like considering abortion always wrong because life is sacred. I think some philosophers argue this, but I'm not certain about Little's stance.

Option C suggests the abortion issue is about the mother's personal preferences. That seems more like a pro-choice stance, emphasizing individual choice. But I'm not sure if that's tied to the norms of creation specifically.

Option D is none of the above, which would be correct if none of the other options match Little's argument.

Wait, I think Little's argument is about the norm of respect for human life. She might argue against the idea that it's merely about the potential of the fetus. Instead, she could be saying that even potential persons should be treated with respect, not necessarily that they have the same rights as actual persons.

So, if that's the case, then terminating a pregnancy might be justifiable under certain conditions, but not just based on personal preference. So option A might be more in line with her reasoning because it's about specific background conditions, not just personal choice.

Alternatively, if Little's argument is that we should respect the potential of life, then maybe option B is more accurate. But I think she allows for some exceptions, so B's absolute stance might not fit.

Wait, another angle: Little talks about the "procreative asymmetry." She argues that the moral reasons to avoid creating a person with a poor life are stronger than the reasons to avoid bringing a happy person into existence. So, if the background conditions are bad, like not a loving family, it's morally justifiable to prevent the suffering by not creating. But in the case of abortion, it's about a fetus already existing, so termination could be respectful in such cases.

So option A seems to align with that. It's respectful to terminate if conditions aren't met. Therefore, the answer would be A.

But wait, let me make sure. If Little's point is that we should avoid creating beings who would have a bad life, then in the context of abortion, which is about ending a potential life, perhaps her stance would support terminating under such conditions as a sign of respect. So yes, option A makes sense.

I think the answer is A.

The question revolves around Little's arguments concerning the norms of creation, particularly in the context of abortion ethics. Little's philosophy emphasizes respect for potential human life but acknowledges that this respect does not equate to absolute rights for the fetus. She introduces the concept of "procreative asymmetry," suggesting that the moral imperative to avoid creating a being who would suffer outweighs the imperative to create a being who would thrive. This reasoning implies that terminating a pregnancy could be a respectful decision under certain conditions, such as when the necessary background conditions for a flourishing life (e.g., a loving family) are absent.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** aligns with Little's reasoning, as it suggests that termination can be respectful under specific circumstances, reflecting her nuanced view of respecting potential life while considering situational ethics.
- **Option B** presents an absolutist stance, which does not fit Little's position, as she allows for exceptions based on background conditions.
- **Option C** reduces the issue to personal preference, which oversimplifies Little's argument and does not capture her emphasis on respect for potential life.
- **Option D** would only be correct if none of the options matched Little's arguments, but Option A does align with her reasoning.

Thus, the correct answer is:

A
