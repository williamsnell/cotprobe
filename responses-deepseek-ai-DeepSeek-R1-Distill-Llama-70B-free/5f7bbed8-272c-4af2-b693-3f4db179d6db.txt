Okay, so I have this question about determining a dog's hearing sensitivity using conditioning. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how one can determine the sensitivity of a dog's hearing to different frequencies. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one. 

First, I remember that sensitivity here refers to how well the dog can hear sounds at various frequencies. So, the method should test the dog's response to different sound frequencies.

Conditioning comes into play here. Conditioning typically involves training an animal to respond to a stimulus. There are two main types: classical and operant conditioning. Classical is like Pavlov's dogs, where a bell rings before food, and they start salivating at the bell. Operant is more about rewards or punishments for actions, like pressing a lever for food.

So, the idea is to condition the dog to react when it hears a sound. For example, when a certain sound is played, the dog does something, like sitting or pressing a button, and gets a treat. By testing different frequencies, you can see which ones the dog responds to.

Looking at the options:

A: Ultrasound exam - That's for imaging, like checking organs, not hearing.

B: Blood sample - Blood tests are for things like diseases or toxins, not hearing.

C: Direct observation – Maybe, but how would that specifically test frequency sensitivity without some conditioning?

D: Brain wave activity – That could work, but it's more invasive and might require electrodes attached, which isn't really conditioning-based.

E: Operant conditioning – Oh, this fits. Using rewards to get the dog to respond to sounds. So you play a sound and if the dog reacts (like pressing a button), you give a treat. By varying the frequency, you can see which ones they detect.

F: X-ray – Again, imaging, not related to hearing function.

G: ABR testing – I think that's a neurologic test that measures the brain's response to sound, but it's not conditioning. It's more of a physiological test, maybe used in audiology for animals.

H: Genetic testing – That's for DNA, not for hearing ability directly.

I: Controlled environment listening test – Sounds like it could involve some form of response, but without conditioning, maybe just observing if the dog reacts. But conditioning makes it more precise because the dog is trained to indicate when it hears.

J: Behavioral observation in natural settings – That's more about observing the dog's natural reactions without any training, which might be less controlled and precise for different frequencies.

So the best option seems to be E: Through operant conditioning. Because you can train the dog to indicate when it hears a sound, allowing you to test various frequencies and determine the sensitivity across the range.

To determine the sensitivity of a dog's hearing to sounds of different frequencies using conditioning, the most effective method involves operant conditioning. This approach trains the dog to perform a specific action (like pressing a button) in response to a sound, rewarding the behavior with treats or other positive reinforcement. By systematically testing various frequencies, one can identify which sounds the dog can detect, thereby assessing its hearing sensitivity.

The correct answer is E: Through operant conditioning.

Answer: E
